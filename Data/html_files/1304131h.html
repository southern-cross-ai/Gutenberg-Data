<h2><a name="ch-01" id="ch-01"></a>Chapter 1. Lady Lochmore</h2>
<p>In this twentieth century the Earl of Lochmore would probably be
described as a permanent adolescent. In his own more direct and
less sophisticated age he was quite simply called a fool, and so
dismissed by men of sense and sensibility.</p>
<p>There is little to be said in his favour. At forty years of age
he was callow, obstinate, rather vicious, and imbued with more than
an ordinary amount of the self-assertion in which a stupid man will
endeavour to swaddle his stupidity.</p>
<p>You conceive that to the high-spirited daughter of that
high-spirited chieftain, Macdonald of Invernaion, Lochmore was
hardly the husband of her romantic dreams. But it was only after
marriage that she discovered how far he failed to realize them.</p>
<p>In the brief season of his courtship she had perceived no more
than the surface of the man.</p>
<p>And on the surface of him there was a certain deceptive glitter.
He had travelled a good deal, and in his travels he had acquired a
certain veneer, impressive to a child whose age was not half his
own and who had been reared in the stern environment of Invernaion.
For although her father's domain was wide&mdash;second only among
the Macdonalds to that of Keppoch&mdash;and although he could bring
a thousand claymores into the field, as, indeed, he had done at
Killiecrankie, yet in the Castle of Invernaion life was uncouthly
lived. The pale reflection of southern graces in which Lochmore
arrayed himself lent him almost an effulgence against such a
background. His powerful, stocky figure, in itself inelegant,
gathered a spurious elegance from his satin coat, his laces and
silk stockings. His self-assertiveness she mistook for strength of
character. Moreover she did not see it at its most flagrant in
those days when his chief concern was to render himself pleasing.
And so, notwithstanding the disparity in their ages, she had
suffered herself without undue reluctance to be married to him,
whereafter she had gone south with him to reap completest
disillusion.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate for her that his qualities were such as to
exclude him from the friendship of his peers. Men of birth and
culture, the very men whose society he desired, were aloof with
him. Because he found them so, he increased in self-assertiveness,
and as a result found himself so shunned that to avoid isolation he
was driven to low company. By nature crudely jealous, his jealousy
was nourished into a singular malevolence by the fact that the
persons of quality who found him repellent discovered attractions
in his wife. Had it not been for her, his fine house in the Strand
would have seen little of the company it was equipped to receive.
As it was, this house became, in spite of him, a resort of men and
women of that courtly society by which his lordship would have
sought in vain to surround himself. But because in his heart he was
not deceived, their presence brought him less satisfaction than
secret resentment.</p>
<p>And there were jealousies of another, less general kind,
resulting more or less directly out of this.</p>
<p>So recklessly, in his fundamental boorishness, did Lochmore
manifest the bad relations which had come to prevail between
himself and his wife, that more than one of those professors of
gallantry who perceive their opportunity in marital discord, became
of a particular assiduity in attentions to her ladyship.</p>
<p>Of these the most enterprising was Lady Lochmore's kinsman, the
elegant, courtly Viscount Glenleven. He made use of his kinship so
as to mask his approach, and assumed towards her ladyship a
fraternal manner, which Lochmore, whilst observing it with
suspicion, felt that he could not openly resent without rendering
himself ridiculous. My Lord Glenleven, moreover, enjoyed a
reputation as a swordsman considerable enough to be almost
sinister. And this made men slow to affront him.</p>
<p>Slightly above the middle height, and of a figure which whilst
slender gave signs of exceptional vigour, the young Viscount was
possessed of a singularly pleasant, melodious voice, which had
often served to correct the harsh impression made by his narrow
face, with its hard blue eyes, long, straight nose and obstinate
mouth. In age he was barely thirty and looked even younger as a
result of the care he bestowed on his appearance. He was gifted,
moreover, with a ready tongue, and could, when he cared to do so,
display a peculiar charm of manner. He displayed it in full to her
ladyship; but he displayed it in vain. Glenleven was an avowed
Whig, enjoying a measure of favour at the court of the Dutch
usurper; and this in a Macdonald was, from her ladyship's point of
view, to be a renegade.</p>
<p>So utterly was her own romantic loyalty given to the exiled King
James that she was incapable of understanding that any Macdonald
should hold different sentiments; and since sooner or later the
tongue must touch where the tooth aches, she gave vehement and
downright expression one day, at last, to the contempt with which
Glenleven's politics inspired her. She chose to do so in the
presence of her husband, perhaps so that, obliquely, she might
reprove him also for the complacency with which he accepted the
usurpation.</p>
<p>Whilst Lochmore scowled and bit his fingernails, Glenleven
smiled with a singularly sweet wistfulness.</p>
<p>"Dear Ailsa, there are times when it is possible to be right
without being just. This is one of those rare occasions. Consider
my shrunken means, so inadequate to my station. Active loyalty is a
luxury beyond them. Our kinsmen in the Highlands may be as staunch
as they please. They are safe in their fastnesses. But a Macdonald
here in London must tread warily."</p>
<p>"A man may tread too warily for honour," said her downright
ladyship.</p>
<p>This brought Lochmore into the discussion. "And a woman may talk
too much for safety. My God, girl, have you never heard of treason
and its consequences? Let me have no more of this Jacobite cant
from you. Busy yourself with the concerns that are proper to a
woman."</p>
<p>"You see," said Glenleven, with his gentle smile, "that I am not
the only Scot who prizes prudence."</p>
<p>"Lochmore is not a Macdonald."</p>
<p>She spoke at once with pride of her race and scorn of those who
were not of it. It was as if she said: "Lochmore is just a poor
blind earthworm of whom nothing is to be expected."</p>
<p>His lordship, perfectly understanding, empurpled. "I thank God
for't. You seem to think, girl, that all the virtues are resident
in the offspring of that Highland dunghill. God a' mercy! Did you
ever hear tell of the Campbells?"</p>
<p>"I seem to be hearing one now," said her fiery ladyship. "Only a
vile son of Diarmid would speak as you do."</p>
<p>Here was a chance for the astute Glenleven; and he took it
promptly, suddenly severe of manner.</p>
<p>"Indeed, Lochmore, you push insult a little far. You seem to
forget that I, too, am a Macdonald."</p>
<p>"My wife's reproof to you is that you've forgotten it,
yourself." With that jeer and a malevolent glance at her ladyship,
Lochmore stamped boorishly out of the room without so much as a
leave-taking.</p>
<p>Glenleven, standing over his seated kinswoman, sighed.</p>
<p>"Just now you uttered a veiled reproach of my prudence,
Ailsa."</p>
<p>"I did not mean to veil it," said she.</p>
<p>"The more reason then why, if you need it, I should give you a
proof of my courage." He touched his sword-hilt caressingly with
his long delicate fingers. "Shall I prove it on that lowland boor?
You have but to say the word, and I'll deliver you."</p>
<p>She sat quite still, with hands folded in her lap, a woman of an
arresting beauty. Her neck and shoulders and finely chiselled face
were of the warm pallor of ivory under a cloud of blackest hair
above. Slender black eyebrows were level above liquid eyes so
deeply blue as to seem black in any but the clearest daylight. The
lips of her delicately sensitive mouth grew faintly scornful now as
she considered his proposal.</p>
<p>"Let be," she said at last. "My deliverance is not your
concern."</p>
<p>"If I were so to make it?" He was eager. "That oaf has said
enough to justify me. I am a Macdonald, as I reminded him."</p>
<p>"And as I reminded you. He said so." Her scorn became more
marked. "You are too good a Whig, Jamie, to have retained anything
of the Macdonald but the name."</p>
<p>He hung his head. "Is that what stands between us, Ailsa?"</p>
<p>"It certainly stands between us."</p>
<p>"You know what I mean. Is that what prevents you loving me?"</p>
<p>"To be sure you have all else to command the passion."</p>
<p>"Why will you rally me, Ailsa? I am so earnest. So deeply
sincere."</p>
<p>"But still so ignorant of what it means to be a Macdonald,
though you profess yourself one. When were our women wantons,
Jamie?"</p>
<p>"Love is not wantonness."</p>
<p>"So says gallantry. And the same of the betrayal of the marriage
vows."</p>
<p>"Is Lochmore true to them?"</p>
<p>"We are not talking of Lochmore, but of you and me, Jamie."</p>
<p>"Yet Lochmore may not be left out. If he were what a
husband&mdash;what your husband&mdash;should be, we should not be
talking so at all."</p>
<p>She looked up at him, and her dark eyes smiled serenely. The
habitual serenity and self-command of one reared in an environment
that to Glenleven was nothing short of barbarous, had long been a
source of amazement to him. Himself born and reared at a distance
from those Highlands to which his family belonged, he knew nothing
of that innate dignity and self-assurance with which those who
sprang from its princely houses were naturally imbued. As
reasonably might he have marvelled at those accepted marks of
breeding displayed in her lofty countenance, in the proud carriage
of her small head, in the fine shapeliness of her hands, and in her
clean-limbed grace.</p>
<p>Slowly she shook her dark head. "This will not serve. You lose
your time and destroy the little regard I retain for you. I do not
love you, Jamie. Perhaps that is the reason. Anyway, let us leave
it there, since that, at least, you must understand, whatever else
may elude you."</p>
<p>"You do not love me," he said slowly, a touch of the tragic in
his manner. "Is it because I am not a hare-brained Jacobite?"</p>
<p>"What a man! Does it matter why?"</p>
<p>"More than life. Show me the reason; and, if it lie in human
power, I will amend it. If you cannot love me because you hate all
Whigs, why then I'll cease to be a Whig tomorrow, whatever the
cost."</p>
<p>"Vanity deludes you, Jamie. I do not love you because I do not
love you, Whig or Tory."</p>
<p>He stood awhile silent, with bowed head. Then, since the heroic
part was the only one which would permit him to retreat in good
order, he played it bravely. He drew himself up, grave and
calm.</p>
<p>"After all, to deserve your love was more than I should have
ventured to hope. All that I ask is to be allowed to love you, who
are of all women the most adorable. All that matters is that you
should remember it against your need. If this boor to whom they
have married you should strain your endurance beyond its strength,
or if in anything else it should ever lie in my power to serve you,
a word is all that I require. So that you remember that, Ailsa, I
am, if not happy, at least resigned."</p>

<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>Chapter 2. Glencoe</h2>
<p>Glenleven departed with confidence that for all her fortitude
and respect for the marriage-tie, the day could not be far distant
when Lochmore by his oafishness would destroy the one and the
other.</p>
<p>And so, indeed, it might have fallen out but for a dark event in
the distant Highlands at about that time, and its curious
repercussion in the politically indifferent bosom of the Earl of
Lochmore.</p>
<p>There were rumours in London that spring of an affair in the
North, in which some Macdonalds had perished. But to London the
Highlands were as remote as the American colonies, and there was as
much, or as little, knowledge of and interest in their affairs.
Even those whose acquaintance with Scottish matters was a little
wider than that of the general, and who troubled to repeat the
rumours, described the matter vaguely as an affray between
Campbells and Macdonalds.</p>
<p>It was in vain that Lady Lochmore sought the detailed truth of
these disquieting stories. Some accounted that the affair had its
source in the eternal feud between the two clans concerned; others
asserted that the source was political, a punishment upon some
stiff-necked Jacobites who had refused to take the oath of
allegiance and so profit by King William's offer of amnesty. But
none could tell her what particular Macdonalds were involved. Few
indeed among her London friends could even understand what such a
question meant.</p>
<p>In those uneasy days she leaned more than usual upon Glenleven,
departing from the prudent coolness she had practised towards him
ever since he had so boldly wooed her. The anxiety which she
conceived that he must share, since he was of the same blood, set
up a bond between them. In his anxiety to please her, Glenleven
ransacked every likely quarter for news. But he could discover
little. Trouble there had certainly been in the Highlands, and
Macdonalds had been the sufferers by it; but what branch of that
great clan was concerned could not be ascertained. The further one
investigated, the more was one confused by the conflict of
assertions. One day the tale would be that the Macdonalds of
Keppoch had been the victims; on the next the Macdonalds of
Glengarry would be named. Macdonald of Sleat was mentioned once,
and once Macdonald of Invernaion. Not to add to her ladyship's
distress Glenleven withheld this last rumour from his
kinswoman.</p>
<p>Since her father had died at the end of the previous year, her
brother Ian was now the head of the sept, and to Glenleven it
seemed far from improbable that in whatever might have occurred Ian
Macdonald should have been involved. He was of a wild, impulsive
nature, as romantic and unpractical as his sister, and governed by
two great passions: love of the House of Stuart and abhorrence of
the House of Argyll. Consequently, thought Glenleven, who in all
Scotland likelier than his cousin Ian to have refused the oath of
allegiance to King William, and, thereby, to have provoked the
vengeance of the Campbells?</p>
<p>And then, when conjecture could go no further, the whole truth
was brought to Lady Lochmore by Ian Macdonald himself.</p>
<p>Attended by two grooms, who though breeched like Sassenachs,
came bonneted and wrapped in their plaids, he rode in the dusk of
an April evening into the courtyard of Lochmore's little mansion in
the Strand.</p>
<p>The earl and his wife had dined, but were still at table when
Ian, booted and spurred and dusty, strode into their presence.</p>
<p>Like his sister he was tall&mdash;a half-head taller than
she&mdash;and like her he was black-haired and pallid, with the
same dark-blue eyes and the same sensitive mouth.</p>
<p>"I come," he announced to Lochmore, "to beg shelter for the
night. That and to embrace you, Ailsa. I am for France."</p>
<p>"For France?" the earl and his countess made echo together.</p>
<p>"To carry my sword to King James. To join the army that is
mustering for the invasion of England. To lend a hand in sending
this knavish Dutchman back to his cheese and his schnapps."</p>
<p>Lochmore was flung into a panic, for there was a servant
present. "In God's name!" he cried.</p>
<p>The servant, however, was a Macdonald, who had followed her
ladyship from Scotland. He had been staring at his chieftain
goggle-eyed in incredulity. He was grinning broadly now at his
chieftain's outspokenness. Nevertheless Lochmore was not
reassured.</p>
<p>"I'll not have such words uttered in my house Ian. Are you mad?
You're not in the Highlands now, where treason may be bawled to the
winds."</p>
<p>Holding his sister to him with one encircling arm, Invernaion's
face grew dark with scorn.</p>
<p>"Ye may be naught but a Lowland Scot, Lochmore; yet a Scot ye
still are, and there'll be blood in your veins. Has it not curdled
at what's happened yonder?"</p>
<p>"And where may yonder be?"</p>
<p>"Man!" Invernaion stared at him, and then at his sister. The
blankness of her countenance, the question in her glance informed
and amazed him. It was to her he spoke. "Is it possible ye've not
heard what happened at Glencoe two months since?"</p>
<p>She shook her dark head. "There have been rumours, vague tales
of an affray between Campbells and Macdonalds. But we do not even
know what Macdonalds are concerned, and this although in my anxiety
I have sought news everywhere. Nothing is known in London of the
trouble."</p>
<p>Macdonald smiled without mirth. "It'll be known at Kensington,
no doubt, whence the vile order came for that massacre. It failed
to be as complete as was intended only because the scoundrel
Campbells who did the Dutchman's bloody work happened to be
blundering fools as well as cut-throats. But it's complete enough
to cry to Heaven for vengeance. Not a hamlet, not a house has been
left standing in Glencoe. There are some heaps of charred ruins
there, as a monument to the false-hearted villainy of William of
Orange. The Glen of Weeping has justified its name.</p>
<p>"You'll not say now, Lochmore, that I am to be dainty in picking
my words when I speak of such a man?"</p>
<p>"You must be," his sister answered him. "Not for Dutch William's
sake, but for your own, and for as long as you tread the soil where
he is master."</p>
<p>"I give thanks that I shall not tread it long. Had it not been
for the need to see you again and to tell you all, so that you may
understand what moves me, I should have taken ship from
Scotland."</p>
<p>He held her at arm's length, and looked with a fond, sad smile
into eyes that were so like his own. "But it's a long tale and an
ugly, lassie; and I am a weary, hungry man. And so are the lads who
ride with me. Maybe ye'll give orders for their comfort."</p>
<p>Order for their comfort was given, and order was instantly taken
for his own.</p>
<p>When, at last, refreshed with meat and wine, he sat back, it was
to give them the full tale for which they waited. And it was a tale
of horrors magnified by the treachery in which those horrors had
been perpetrated.</p>
<p>He spoke as an eye-witness of the actual facts. For it had
happened by an odd chance that on the 12th February he was on his
way to the house of a friend on Loch Leven, to whose new-born child
he was to stand godfather. He travelled accompanied, as now, by
only a couple of his lads.</p>
<p>Delayed on the road by foul weather, they had reached the head
of the defile of Glencoe as night was falling. And as it was a
wild, stormy night of wind and blinding snow, he decided to call a
halt and seek until morning the hospitality of the old chieftain
Mac Ian.</p>
<p>Welcomed as a brother by that patriarchal Macdonald, he
discovered that he was not that night the only guest. He was
surprised to find two redcoat officers at Mac Ian's hospitable
board, and none too pleased to discover a Campbell in the senior of
these, Captain Campbell of Glenlyon.</p>
<p>It was explained to him that the captain and his lieutenant, a
man named Lindsay, were in command of a company of a hundred and
twenty redcoats of Argyll's Regiment, who for twelve days now had
been quartered upon Macdonald hospitality in the glen. He had never
quite understood by what pretence they had imposed themselves upon
Mac Ian; but he had vaguely heard that they were marching against
some of Glengarry's people who had been harrying the country. He
had heard nothing of any such harrying, and the mere fact that
these men were Campbells should have rendered them suspect. It may
be, however, that any uneasiness Mac Ian might have felt was
allayed by the fact that their captain's niece was married to the
chieftain's younger son, Alexander Macdonald. The kinship thus
established may, moreover, have been accounted to supply a reason
why Glenlyon should quarter there himself and his men.</p>
<p>"That night," Invernaion continued, "after the two officers had
departed to their quarters, which were at Inveriggan's, old Mac Ian
and I sat long in talk over a bottle of old French brandy. He was
in high spirits, relieved by the presence of these troops from
anxieties that had been weighing upon him in connection with the
manner in which he had taken the oath of allegiance. Never was
bitterer deception, bitterer irony than that of his relief. You'll
know the facts of the oath?"</p>
<p>They did not, and he, therefore, proceeded to relate them.
Enthralled by his narrative, and the sense of tragedy which his
tone and manner brought to it, they sat watching him with eyes that
glittered in the candlelight.</p>
<p>"You'll know at least, maybe, that proclamation was made in
Scotland of a general amnesty to all so-called rebels who should by
the thirty-first of December last have sworn allegiance to the
Dutchman.</p>
<p>"I know now that this was a trap in which the Campbell dog,
Breadalbane, working through his knavish tool, the Master of Stair,
hoped to take the Camerons and the Macdonalds. For it was added to
the proclamation that after that date any who had not taken the
oath would be pursued as enemies and traitors.</p>
<p>"Breadalbane's malice and covetousness built hopes upon our
staunch loyalty to the rightful King. What he did not know was that
we had represented to King James our inability to hold out, and
that his majesty had intimated to us that he would not take it
amiss that we should submit to the usurping dynasty provided that
we held ourselves in readiness to rise against it when the time
should come.</p>
<p>"So, one by one, we took the oath, until all save only Mac Ian
had made that enforced profession of loyalty. Since our course was
resolved, I don't know what delayed his submission. Maybe the
postponement was prompted by repugnance, maybe merely by vanity to
show himself more stiff-necked than his peers. We shall never
know.</p>
<p>"Anyway, postpone he did until the last moment.</p>
<p>"On the thirty-first of December, accompanied by his principal
vassals, old Mac Ian presented himself at Fort William to take the
oath. To his dismay he was told that there was no one there
competent to administer it. The nearest magistrate was at Inverary.
In panic, as he told me, and cursing now a procrastination which
might come to cost him his life and his estates, he made off in all
haste for Inverary. But that is no light journey in the depths of
winter. He was six days in performing it. Still, he carried a
letter to the sheriff from the Governor of Fort William, which did
bear witness to the fact that he had presented himself to take the
oath on the thirty-first. The sheriff, although a Campbell, took a
lenient view, administered the oath, and promised to send a letter
of explanation to Edinburgh together with the certificates.</p>
<p>"Mac Ian returned home relieved, but in a relief that needed
confirmation, for he knew the malice that was astir. This
confirmation the old man thought that he possessed at last. This
quartering of troops upon his people, he took to be a sign of the
government's confidence in him; and it was stressed by the
friendliness towards him and his of these troopers and their
officers, who for twelve days now had been enjoying his bounteous
hospitality."</p>
<p>He paused there a moment, his young face set and grim.</p>
<p>"I doubt," he said, slowly and sadly, "if in the history of the
human race, with all the cruelty and the treachery that disgrace
it, there is an instance of a blacker, fouler treachery than this.
Compared with Glenlyon and the vile masters who sent him to the
work, Judas, himself, becomes almost a saintly figure."</p>
<p>Then, with a sigh, he resumed his narrative.</p>
<p>"I was awakened, in the middle of the night as I thought, but
actually, as I afterwards learnt, at five o'clock in the morning,
by a shot in the room below.</p>
<p>"As I sat up in bed, listening, I caught distinctly above the
howling of the wind, the sound of other shots in the open.</p>
<p>"With a sense of evil heavy upon me I jumped from the bed,
hastily pulled on some garments, and with my plaid wrapped about
me, went below. As I descended the stairs a woman's scream came to
me from outside, then another shot, and a long wail that ended
abruptly.</p>
<p>"I flung open the door of the main room below, and stood horror
stricken on the threshold. The chamber was in disorder. Chairs were
overturned, and some shards of broken earthenware littered the
floor. In a corner two redcoats were besetting a woman who defended
herself feebly. It was Mac Ian's wife. Mac Ian himself lay, limp as
a sack, prone across the table at which he and I had sat the night
before; the table at which the officers had dined with us. He was
dead; and just within the open doorway stood Lindsay still grasping
the pistol with which he had shot him. Afterwards I was to learn
that he had pistolled him even as Mac Ian was bidding him welcome
to a morning draught, and calling his servants to come and minister
to the soldier's needs.</p>
<p>"I was without weapons; but I advanced into the room.</p>
<p>"'What is this?' I cried. 'What is happening here?'</p>
<p>"Lindsay stared at me. 'Invernaion!' he said, and laughed.
'Faith, I'd forgotten you. After all, you're a Macdonald, and our
orders are that by daylight there shall not be one of that damned
name left alive in Glencoe!'</p>
<p>"He called over his shoulder, and in prompt answer to it, three
redcoats with firelocks emerged from the darkness into the
lamplight.</p>
<p>"'Here, my lads!' A wave of the ruffian's arm pointed me out to
his men. 'Here's another of the damned brood.'</p>
<p>"That was all the command he gave them; all the command they
needed; for they had those general orders that not a Macdonald,
man, woman or bairn, was to live to see that day's light in
Glencoe. They ranged themselves, and they were already raising
their muskets.</p>
<p>"There was no reflection in what I did. Action anticipated
thought. Before I even realized what I was doing, the room was in
darkness. I had seized a chair that stood near me, and at a blow I
had swept the lamp in fragments from the table. I leapt at the
place where I had last seen the soldiers standing. The chair, used
like a flail, met a yielding resistance, and I knew that one of
them had gone down before me. I bounded through the gap left by his
fall. Another bound, and I was in the open, where it was pitch dark
and snowing hard. Curses followed me; then shots; then the
blundering footsteps of those murderers.</p>
<p>"I turned to my right, whereabouts I knew of a ravine up which I
proposed to make my way. I was not followed. In that darkness and
with the hard-driven snow to render blindness absolute, the
redcoats must have realized not merely the fruitlessness, but even
the danger of pursuit.</p>
<p>"I stumbled upwards for perhaps a half-mile, and I came at last,
bruised and with torn legs and hands, to a shallow cave, into which
I was glad enough to creep for shelter from the pitiless weather.
There at peep of day, I was joined by three other fugitives, one of
whom was John Macdonald, Mac Ian's elder son.</p>
<p>"Glenlyon, you see, was a fool as well as a butcher. The plan of
which he was given the execution, failed&mdash;God be
thanked!&mdash;through his blundering. Had he kept to cold steel
not a Macdonald would have escaped, and his orders would have been
fulfilled to the letter. It was the shots that gave the alarm, and
enabled three-fourths of the dwellers in the glen to take to the
hills.</p>
<p>"The direct victims of that butchery numbered in men, women and
children, something over thirty. But what may have been the total
indirect number had not been ascertained when I departed. Scantily
clad as most of them would be when they fled through the snow, many
must have perished of exposure. Their lot is even more pitiful than
that of the slaughtered.</p>
<p>"Late on the following day, by when the redcoats had departed,
we crept down to the ruined glen. All that was to be seen of its
prosperous hamlets were the smoking ruins of the houses the
soldiers had fired. Nothing had they left behind them save the
corpses on the dunghills. The whole glen had been laid waste; the
cattle, sheep and goats had been herded away.</p>
<p>"A heap of ashes was all that remained of the domain of Glencoe,
and the unfortunates who crept back, returned to find themselves
without means of subsistence, face to face with famine."</p>
<p>He paused again wearily in that long narrative, paused as if
overcome with the horror of it.</p>
<p>He poured himself a glass of claret, and slowly drank it under
the sombre eyes of his silent audience before continuing. He spoke
very quietly and slowly now.</p>
<p>"That evening in Glencoe I swore an oath upon the charred
remains of old Mac Ian that I would take no rest nor thought for my
own concerns until the authors of that abomination should have been
brought to account; that I would spend myself without stint to
accomplish this, and shrink from nothing that should forward that
sacred task&mdash;sacred, indeed, to every man who bears the name
of Macdonald.</p>
<p>"Of what I was constrained to suffer I will not speak. That is
of no moment. I went to Edinburgh, there to ascertain precisely who
might be responsible. And there, by cautious investigation, I
gradually pieced the vile thing together, learnt of the parts
played by Breadalbane and Stair. Their evil spite would not suffer
them to receive the tardy oath of the Macdonalds of Glencoe.
Enraged that so many whom they had hoped to enmesh in their pride
and so ruin, should have escaped by stifling that pride, they
vented all their evil fury upon the few whom a legal technicality
left at their mercy Vile as this was, viler still was the method
adopted to execute their will, the treachery, the abuse of
hospitality imposed upon their instruments, so that the massacre of
the Macdonalds of Glencoe should be complete.</p>
<p>"But just as Breadalbane and Stair stand in responsibility above
Glenlyon and Lindsay, so the usurper William stands above
Breadalbane and Stair. For whilst either of these, or both jointly,
conceived the order for the massacre, this William of Orange signed
it. Oh, I know what I am saying, Lochmore. In Edinburgh my
investigations were very complete. If things were not as I have
said, if King William had not set his signature to that terrible
order, justice could be moved against those malefactors.</p>
<p>"And so, the oath I swore not merely includes King William, but
aims first of all at him as the master criminal in this."</p>
<p>Again he paused, and when next he spoke he had again reduced to
a quiet note a voice into which vehemence had gradually crept.</p>
<p>"Listen, Lochmore, and you, too, Ailsa. This may surprise you.
When I took my oath of allegiance to King William, I took it, as I
believe that Lochiel took it, without any mental reservations.
Lochiel announced the intention of coming to London to kiss his
majesty's hands; and it was in my mind to do the like. All that is
over now. In my eyes that have looked on the horrors of Glencoe,
William of Orange is once more a usurper, to be removed from the
throne of England by whatever means may present themselves.</p>
<p>"That is why I am on my way to France. And not merely to swell
by one negligible sword the forces gathering to support King James.
But to place myself unreservedly at his majesty's disposal, to be
used in any way that he may account will help forward his
restoration, as the necessary preliminary to retribution upon all
those responsible in whatsoever degree for this odious crime
against the Macdonalds."</p>
<p>He rose now, white-faced and fanatical of eye.</p>
<p>"For what you are, Lochmore, you owe thanks to his majesty's
grandfather. What you have, came to you from his bounty. As a man
of honour you will own the debt. As a man of honour I adjure you to
seize every chance of repaying it."</p>
<p>Lochmore, from being deeply moved, deeply shocked by what he had
heard, was now deeply startled. He grumbled dully that God was his
witness that he owed little to King William or King William's
friends. But this, he protested, did not help him to perceive what
it might lie in his power to do. Invernaion told him, and what
Invernaion left unsaid was added by his sister, with a fervour even
deeper than her brother's.</p>
<p>There was public opinion to be influenced, faltering loyalties
to be sustained, slothful negligence to be put to shame. All this
could be done here in London, and in this she was
prepared&mdash;nay, eager&mdash;to do her part if Lochmore would
either lead her or second her.</p>
<p>Thus for the first time in that full year of their unhappy
marriage did a point of contact between them offer itself, did a
matter present itself of which they could make a common interest,
and so perhaps be yet drawn together, notwithstanding disparities.
Instead, however, it was destined to lead to their final
severance.</p>
<p>In the mention of what was to do, Lochmore perceived merely what
his wife might do, influences which she might wield. For him there
would be no such opportunities. Friendless as he perceived himself
among her friends, he was not to be duped by her treasonable
enthusiasm. He commanded none of the sympathy necessary to make his
seditious proposals heeded. And from the resentful consideration of
this and of his position among the Tories who were her principal
courtiers, he passed to a no less resentful review of his position
among the Whigs to whom he had so fruitlessly paid court.</p>
<p>He grew, perhaps, more deeply and sullenly conscious of his
isolation than he had ever been before. He perceived the
hopelessness of his case. Vaguely it was borne in upon him that at
some point in his career he had moved in the wrong direction, and
that his only chance of redemption lay now in an entirely fresh
start. And just as he perceived this, so he perceived, too, that
his brother-in-law offered him tonight the chance of making this
fresh start in an arresting, even dazzling, manner. Let him range
himself with Invernaion actively and militantly under the banner of
King James; and when the King came to his own again Lochmore's
would be a position of eminence, whence he could deal as cavalierly
as he pleased with both Whig and Tory who had dealt so cavalierly
with him. They should realize in bitterness the error of their
sneers when they found him sneering down upon them in his turn,
with a sneer that should have power to ostracize.</p>
<p>At least that is how Lady Lochmore more or less, and
tentatively, explained afterwards to her brother the phenomenon of
which they were now the witnesses, the sudden tempestuous impulse
upon which Lochmore announced the unexpected intention of going to
Saint Germains with his brother-in-law.</p>
<p>"It need not be publicly announced," he said. "Indeed, that
would be rank folly. Ailsa will give it out that I have gone on the
grand tour." And to this after a moment's thought he added with a
little laugh of bitterness: "Considering what my relations with my
dear wife are supposed to be, none will be incredulous, or even
astonished."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>Chapter 3. Invernaion</h2>
<p>The mention of Glenleven by Invernaion, at breakfast on the
following morning, came to give Lochmore pause in his impulsive
resolve of the previous night.</p>
<p>It reminded him of all that to which his absence would leave his
honour, in the person of her ladyship, exposed, and so reawakened
the jealousy that had momentarily slumbered.</p>
<p>The Earl of Lochmore was of those who fail to perceive that a
man who can do nothing to deserve his wife's affection, can do
nothing to command his own married happiness, and, therefore, for
his own sake, were better out of the chafing ties of that
association. All that his lordship considered was that at law his
countess was his property, and his jealous anxiety to protect her
was precisely that which he would have brought to the protection of
any other of his chattels.</p>
<p>This feeling, now fully aroused, might well have turned him from
his purpose but for the connection in which Glenleven was
mentioned. What Invernaion said was that the matter concerned
Glenleven as closely as any other Macdonald, and that he should be
informed so as to be given the opportunity of collaborating.</p>
<p>"Although he may have faltered in his adherence to King James,
it will surprise me if when he hears the truth of this affair he
will not be impatient to shake the dust of England from his shoes,
and cross the Channel with us."</p>
<p>This made a difference to Lochmore. If Glenleven were to be of
the party, he need not go back on his intentions and his word;
there would no longer be the need to stay to defend his preserves
from the one poacher he seriously feared.</p>
<p>Glenleven was sent for and came promptly. With horror and
indignation he heard the true facts of Glencoe, as must any man who
possessed a heart at all. In that horror and indignation he shed
most of the Whig sympathies which out of expediency he had
embraced. But he did not shed them quite all.</p>
<p>Not only was he a Macdonald of Invernaion, but he stood next to
Ian in the succession to the chieftainship of the clan. It must
seem to follow&mdash;and it certainly so seemed to the sluggish
wits of Lochmore&mdash;that a matter so closely concerning Ian must
as closely concern Glenleven.</p>
<p>What Glenleven's shrewd mind first saw was that directly the
matter did not concern Ian at all. Vengeance was the business, in
the first place, of the survivors of Glencoe, and, in the second
place, of some of those Macdonalds who stood closer to Glencoe than
did Invernaion. Ian Macdonald's assumption of the mantle of the
avenger was fortuitous and emotional: a surrender to the passions
aroused in him by what he had witnessed.</p>
<p>He moved Invernaion's indignant amazement by some such
observation.</p>
<p>"Does it not concern every man who bears the name of Macdonald?
It may move me more hotly because I saw with my own eyes what
others have learnt merely from report. But to all Macdonalds alike
it must be a clear duty to pull down the man of blood who ordered
that infamy."</p>
<p>"You should not need it to be repeated to you, Jamie," said her
ladyship in a voice of cold displeasure.</p>
<p>"I did not need it," he was quick to answer. For he coveted her
favour above all things, and he instantly realized that for him to
remain a Whig in the face of these events was to forfeit all chance
of that favour forever. "You mistake me. I commented rather upon
the oddness of the circumstances that this should fall on us. For I
am with you, Ian, body and soul, brain and arm. It would have
needed less than this to have aroused my duty to King James."</p>
<p>"Then you are really with us?" said her ladyship, melting a
little from her coolness before this announcement of a sudden
conversion.</p>
<p>"Could you doubt it?"</p>
<p>It was Invernaion who answered him.</p>
<p>"No," he said. "For then I must believe you at once without
heart and without ambition. Your fortunes, Jamie, stand, I know,
none so high. Here is the chance to mend them. It is those who
range themselves at His Majesty's side now, in the hour of his
need, who will sit beside him in the high places when he returns to
his own."</p>
<p>There was a crooked smile on Glenleven's narrow face. "You
believe in the gratitude of princes? Well, well! I, who do not, am
in this for conscience' sake."</p>
<p>Her ladyship's glance approved him with sudden warmth.</p>
<p>He was brisk and eager. He would accompany them to Saint
Germains. He would seek a place in the great army that was
preparing to invade England, or he would serve in any capacity
which might be discerned for him.</p>
<p>Thus was Lochmore's uneasiness set at rest.</p>
<p>When, however, Invernaion announced that he was for the Romney
Marsh that very night, and that he would sail so soon as he could
find a boat to put him across, Glenleven was not unnaturally
checked. He could not, thus, at a moment's notice pack and quit.
Some days would be necessary for the dispositions he would have to
make. Either they must wait for him, or else leave him to follow in
a few days' time, so soon as his arrangements could be completed.
Besides, in those few days he might enlist others: men of substance
and position in the country.</p>
<p>"It is not," he explained, "that these few swords can materially
strengthen the invading army. But the men who bear them will be of
inestimable support to the cause. Their example is one that will
have many followers." He mentioned several titled Tories, such as
the Earl of Claybourne and Viscount Preston, and insisted upon the
effect upon the country of beholding such men in the ranks of the
army to be landed. He mentioned even Russell and Marlborough, whom
he knew for Jacobites at heart, and who might possibly be brought
over definitely now.</p>
<p>Both Invernaion and Lochmore were impressed by his fervour and
her ladyship's eyes sparkled at the prospect Glenleven's words
unfolded.</p>
<p>"Woe me!" she cried. "That I may not wield a sword beside you;
that I am but a woman."</p>
<p>Thus reminded of her womanhood and its troublesome
contingencies, Lochmore swung back to his fears, and would have had
them wait for Glenleven. But Invernaion would not hear of it. He
was all impatience to be gone; and Lochmore, having now committed
himself, could not withstand the heat and imperious will of his
brother-in-law.</p>
<p>So that very day the twain set out for Sussex and the sea.</p>
<p>Her ladyship's parting kiss to her lord was perhaps the first
kiss of real affection that had passed between them since their
wedding. He was magnified in her eyes by the mission upon which he
went. For the first time she saw him engaged in something that was
not concerned with self-indulgence, something that commanded her
respect.</p>
<p>To her brother she clung passionately for a moment, thrilled by
an alarm for him which had been entirely absent from her embrace of
her lord.</p>
<p>"God guard you, Ian," was her fervent whisper. "I shall pray for
you, and I shall work for you here. You can depend upon me for
that, and for all else. You have but to send me your commands."</p>
<p>He knew that he could so depend upon her. He had a high regard
for her intelligence, and he was aware of the strength of her
romantic attachment to the Stuart cause. He could desire no better
agent in England.</p>
<p>Another agent, nevertheless, he was soon to possess in
Glenleven. The Viscount gradually discovered that he had underrated
the time necessary for those dispositions that were to be made, and
particularly for the proselytizing work which he had announced that
he would take in hand. Days grew to weeks, and still his departure
was postponed. Finally, by the month of June, he found himself so
deeply enmeshed in the business of stimulating active Jacobitism in
England that he abandoned altogether&mdash;and entirely with
Invernaion's concurrence&mdash;the notion of crossing to France. He
could be far more valuable to King James at home, marshalling the
friends of His Majesty, kindling loyalty in some and fanning into a
blaze the smouldering embers of loyalty in others, by diligently
spreading the true story of Glencoe. He would have, he announced,
the nucleus of an army under his hand by the time His Majesty
landed in England.</p>
<p>Ailsa Lochmore, observing his diligence, approved him, and,
negligent of risks, turned her house into a meeting-place for the
malcontents whom Glenleven was industriously assembling and
stimulating.</p>
<p>Invernaion, informed of this in the course of the steady if
discreet correspondence which he maintained in cipher with his
sister, desired her to convey to Glenleven that His Majesty,
sensible of the Viscount's diligence on his behalf, commanded him
to remain at the post which he had created in London and to pursue
the valuable work that he was performing there.</p>
<p>The only one who was not quite satisfied was Lochmore. He was
pervaded&mdash;and probably not without reason&mdash;by a sense
that he had been tricked, that Glenleven had never been sincere in
the avowed intentions of following them to France. But there were
compensations for him. He received civilities at the dour,
priest-ridden court of Saint Germains such as had never yet fallen
to his lot. He was happy in them because he failed to perceive that
he owed them not to any merit discerned in himself, but to the fact
that he was Invernaion's brother-in-law.</p>
<p>For Invernaion there had been the warmest welcome. There were
too few Scots of eminence in the following of King James that he
could afford to treat lightly the services offered by an
influential young chieftain whose call would raise a thousand
claymores in the day of battle, and who was, moreover, aflame with
a holy ardour that would stop at nothing.</p>
<p>Such a man seemed almost sent by Heaven at such a moment.
Louvois, that great statesman of Louis XIV, had devised the
simplest of all schemes for definitely delivering his master from
the anxieties caused him by the pestilential Prince of Orange. It
was this William of Orange who held together the coalition that
opposed the megalomania of Louis XIV, which would have rendered
France the despot of Europe. Even to the genius of William of
Orange such a task was not easy. Without him the coalition would
fall to pieces, and its component members would lie severally at
France's mercy. All that was necessary, then, to achieve this
desirable end was William's removal, an entirely justifiable
homicide in the eyes of Louvois.</p>
<p>Louvois, however, died before he could arrange for the execution
of the scheme. But he bequeathed it, among other treasures, to his
son, Barbesieux, who worked it out in detail.</p>
<p>The moment was propitious. William of Orange was in the
Netherlands, at the head of the allied army, and at these
headquarters would be fairly accessible.</p>
<p>King James was aware of and approved the simple expedient which
was not merely to serve the ends of Louis XIV, but at the same time
was to open wide, as he supposed, the door for his own return to
his throne.</p>
<p>All that was lacking when Invernaion presented himself at Saint
Germains was the instrument.</p>
<p>Now considering the risk to be run, indeed the practical
certainty, whether successful or not, of being taken and of
suffering the horrible fate of Ravaillac, an instrument was not
easy to find. No brutal professional murderer or bravo for hire
would serve. The task demanded some fanatical zealot on grounds be
it of religion, be it of patriotism, who would be prepared to
suffer martyrdom; and aspirants to martyrdom have not been common
in any age.</p>
<p>Therefore the sudden but timely appearance at Saint Germains of
this young Scot, his soul steeped in righteous abhorrence of
William of Orange, aflame with the desire to avenge the blood of
his kin so mercilessly and treacherously shed at Glencoe, appeared
to King James to be a definite sign that Heaven favoured the
enterprise.</p>
<p>"On my knees, sire, I beg you to let the task be mine."</p>
<p>A flame flickered in the eyes of the pallid, hatchet-faced
monarch, who would, himself, gladly have gone on his knees to
Invernaion to beg the service which Invernaion so fervently begged
to be allowed to perform.</p>
<p>"Benedictus sis," he murmured, feeling that no lesser language
than Latin was worthy of so sacred an occasion. "Accomplish this
and rest forever in the certainty of my favour."</p>
<p>Invernaion smiled. "When it is accomplished, sire, I shall be
beyond the reach of any favour but God's. I shall look to be
remembered in your majesty's prayers."</p>
<p>King James glanced quickly down on him from the high chair in
which he sat, a funereal figure, all in black save only for the
bright blue ribbon of the Garter. He was about to speak, to rebut
the assumption of such complete self-sacrifice. But the calm,
smiling intrepidity of the handsome countenance into which he
looked gave him pause. This was not one with whom it was necessary
or desirable to prevaricate.</p>
<p>The cold, harsh face of the exiled monarch softened in its
expression. For once perhaps that selfish marble heart was touched
by pity that one so young and eager must be immolated in his sacred
cause. But because his cause was sacred there could be no
hesitations. He spoke softly.</p>
<p>"For those whose devotion makes for such sacrifice is the
Kingdom of Heaven." Having added this to the Beatitudes, he fetched
a sigh. "Go now, my friend. Tomorrow you shall have a letter from
my Lord Marquis of Barbesieux, who will instruct you." He turned to
his minister, Lord Melfort, who, behind his master's chair, was the
only witness of the scene. "Go with him, Melfort. See him cared
for."</p>
<p>Early on the morrow, however, before the King had written to
Barbesieux there came from Barbesieux a letter by the hand of a
French officer, named Grandval, which announced to James that the
bearer was the instrument sought. He was sent to Saint Germains to
receive His Majesty's benediction before setting out for Uden,
whence he was to repair to the headquarters of the allies, where
William of Orange was to be found.</p>
<p>The dull-witted King was in a quandary. He took counsel alone
with Melfort. He was almost peevish.</p>
<p>"Voil un embarras de richesses," he complained.</p>
<p>Melfort perceived no embarrassment: "A sign," he declared it. "A
sign of the favour of Heaven, wearied, sire, by the iniquities of
Your Majesty's heretical son-in-law."</p>
<p>The gloomy face of the monarch lighted a little. "It was to have
been expected. Yes. I am a man of little faith when all is said,
Melfort. But what is to be done? This Frenchman has already
received his commission from Barbesieux, and I have promised mine
to Macdonald of Invernaion."</p>
<p>"It is plain, sire. Should Grandval fail, you have Invernaion in
reserve for another attempt. Should Invernaion go now and fail, you
do not know that Grandval will again be available. That clearly
indicates the solution."</p>
<p>Thus it was decided; and the French officer was brought back to
the royal presence. James proffered his hand to the lips of
Grandval. The letter had announced that the officer would have two
associates in the enterprise.</p>
<p>"Go with God," James said to him. "If you and your companions do
me this service you shall never want."</p>
<p>To Invernaion His Majesty was almost apologetic. But
Invernaion's answer relieved the royal distress at disappointing
the Scot of the crown of martyrdom. It was an answer that fully
confirmed Melfort, and confirmed it almost in Melfort's own
words.</p>
<p>"So that it is done, it matters little, sire, whose the hand.
Should your present messenger have the mischance to fail, I still
remain for this or any other service Your Majesty may command."</p>
<p>His Majesty was pleased with the answer, and thereafter
Invernaion was honoured as an aspirant for martyrdom should be
honoured by those on whose behalf he is to suffer it. The sun of
the royal favour blazed upon him, and lesser mortals in the royal
following courted and caressed him. On the other hand, it is
eminently possible that jealousy was aroused against him for the
favour shown him by a prince usually stingy in the matter. It is
also certain that there were traitors at Saint Germains who kept
the Government at home informed of what was happening at the court
of the exiled king.</p>
<p>Be all that as it may, the fact is that when Grandval failed,
betrayed by his coadjutors, and was taken, tried and executed, to
the names of his associates published in England was added that of
Ian Macdonald of Invernaion.</p>
<p>Thus for the first time did the name of that young Scottish
chieftain leap into questionable fame in England. It was to be
heard again a few months later, after Steinkirk had been fought and
after King William had returned to England, when James Whitney, the
highwayman, was caught and put upon his trial.</p>
<p>In an attempt to save his life, the ruffian announced himself
privy to a plot to assassinate the King. Some eminent Jacobites had
offered him, he swore, a great price to murder the King whilst he
was hunting in Windsor Forest. He boldly named some great names,
and amongst them was that of Ian Macdonald of Invernaion, who, he
affirmed, had crossed from France to make him a specious
proposal.</p>
<p>No credit was attached to his word, and no measures were taken
against any of those he accused. But it was remembered, and was
matter for comment, that Macdonald of Invernaion had been named
also in connection with the Grandval attempt.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-04" id="ch-04"></a>Chapter 4. The End of
Lochmore</h2>
<p>Macdonald of Invernaion was in close attendance upon King James.
He accompanied him to La Hogue, and was with him there, waiting to
embark for England with the army of invasion supplied by King
Louis. There he witnessed the raid by the British fleet, under
Russel, which destroyed at the very outset the hopes of that
embarkation. He returned in the following of the dejected monarch
to Saint Germains, sharing his dejection.</p>
<p>With Invernaion went Lochmore, shining in the glory which his
brother-in-law reflected, and persuaded ever that he owed the
favour in which he stood to the amiable parts discovered in himself
by this discerning court. He was completely happy for perhaps the
first time in his foolish life. He wrote vainglorious letters to
his countess. So as to impress her with the consequence into which
he was come at last, he packed these letters with accounts of what
His Majesty had said to him upon this occasion or upon that, and
with what answers he had dazzled Majesty in return. He gave the
clear impression that Majesty hung upon his utterances.</p>
<p>At first his letters may have departed none too widely from the
truth. But, little by little, his dull, contentious, unlovable
nature coming to be perceived, men began to fall away from him here
as all his life they had fallen away from him elsewhere. Because he
could not brook this neglect, he met the growing indifference by an
aggressive intrusiveness. Thus it follows that he made matters
worse. He became the object of slights and sarcasms which,
offending his vanity, stirred into full activity an evil, ugly
temper, which had never required much stirring. It needed all the
tact of Invernaion, supported by the respect in which he was held,
to prevent an open rupture between his troublesome brother-in-law
and one or another of the hotheads of whom there were plenty in the
composition of that court.</p>
<p>In these efforts Invernaion was humanely seconded by a soldier
of distinction, whose qualities had earned him a universal esteem
at Saint Germains.</p>
<p>Colonel Dudley Walton had seen a great deal of French service,
and had learned more than soldiering in the course of it. He was
one of the very few who had the discernment, wit, and humanity to
be sorry for Lochmore. He perceived the man's besetting trouble to
be the loneliness to which he was doomed by the attributes inherent
in him. Gross and coarse he might be. But underneath these
qualities Colonel Walton caught glimpses of the man's passionate,
pathetic desire for esteem and popularity such as he lacked the
natural means to command. It was from this that his worst
blundering resulted.</p>
<p>Colonel Walton befriended him when he was growing most
friendless, and by his humour, tact, and skill kept the aggressive
fellow safe for a season. But it was a wasted endeavour. Eventually
the inevitable happened when Colonel Walton was not at hand to
avert it.</p>
<p>The Earl of Lochmore occupied, as did so many other of the
followers of King James, lodgings in the town of Saint Germains.
These lodgings he shared with an Irishman named Burke. One night
when his lordship had been drinking heavily he replied to a
taunting jest of Burke's with a blow. From childhood he had been
too ready with his hands.</p>
<p>A challenge followed.</p>
<p>Lochmore, in need of a friend to act for him, but afraid to meet
the anger of his brother-in-law by telling him what had occurred,
sought Colonel Walton.</p>
<p>The Colonel used every endeavour to compose the quarrel. He
dealt with the two men separately; reasoned with each of them, more
in the manner of a parson than of a soldier of fortune such as he
was; and eventually he succeeded in bringing them to a peace-making
meeting.</p>
<p>In this confrontation the Earl of Lochmore was his most sullen
self, and Burke, a mere youngster, airily impudent. The Colonel
delivered himself to them of a little homily upon the duty of
keeping their lives at the disposal of their King who sorely needed
them.</p>
<p>In age Colonel Walton stood between the two, a man in the early
thirties, but in experience and worldly wisdom he was old enough to
be the grandfather of either. And the calm suavity of his manner
conveyed a sense of this. He was a tall man, straight, spare and
vigorous, and of an exceptional elegance in all his appointments,
from his black periwig to his Spanish shoes. His face was long,
lean and olive-tinted, very square in the chin and firm in the
mouth. His calm grey eyes were set at a downward slant, which lent
the attractive countenance an air of gentle melancholy that served
to increase its distinction.</p>
<p>If in all that court there was a man who commanded the gentle
authority necessary to bring a couple of quarrelsome idiots to
their senses, that man was Colonel Walton. But the present task was
to prove beyond him. As he brought his little homily to a close, he
seemed to direct his appeal more directly to Burke, or so Burke
fancied.</p>
<p>He protested plaintively</p>
<p>"Och now, hasn't there been a blow struck, Colonel darling? And
would ye honour a man who could take a blow?"</p>
<p>"I would if he had provoked it," said the Colonel.</p>
<p>"It's the nice judge in a matter of honour ye are, to be sure,
Colonel. And I'll take your judgment. If his lordship will
apologize for the blow, I'll apologize for any provocation I may
have given him."</p>
<p>"You hear, Lochmore," said Colonel Walton hopefully</p>
<p>But Lochmore stood squarely planted on his thick legs, the very
incarnation of obstinacy.</p>
<p>"I hear conditions," he grumbled. "Captain Burke called me a
drunken heretic. I can take that from no man."</p>
<p>"Setting aside the matter of heresy, ye'll admit that ye were
drunk," said Burke.</p>
<p>"I don't admit it, sir. I was not."</p>
<p>"Then more shame on ye for calling me a damned rapparee. I ask
ye, Colonel, is that a thing a man can leave unanswered, now? If he
insisted that he was sober when he said it, then it's devil an
apology I'll accept from him at all."</p>
<p>"It's not been offered," snapped Lochmore. "If there are going
to be apologies, you'll begin them."</p>
<p>"Not at all. If, as ye say, there are going to be apologies
we'll have them in their proper order. Sure it's only to please the
Colonel that I consent to this at all."</p>
<p>Colonel Walton intervened with a laugh, in the desperate
endeavour to keep the matter light. "Come, come! Ye're both
behaving like schoolboys. So that ye both apologize, what does it
matter who begins it? Here!" He caught each by an arm, and pulled
them forward. "Make it simultaneous by just shaking hands, and
forget a folly done when ye were both the worse for liquor."</p>
<p>Burke let himself be drawn forward willingly. He was grinning
his satisfaction of the compromise the Colonel had discovered. But
Lochmore employed his weight to resist the Colonel's physical
suasion. Observing this the volatile young Irishman, who had been
ready to jettison all rancour, took sudden fire.</p>
<p>"Just look at the omadhaun's reluctance, Colonel. Sure it's the
fight he wants, and, begad, that's an inclination I've never
baulked in any man. To Hell with apologies." He wrenched his arm
free of Colonel Walton's grasp. "I've none to offer now, first or
last."</p>
<p>"I'm relieved," said his lordship. "I've never apologized to a
man in my life."</p>
<p>The Colonel vented a sigh of despair. "I shouldn't make a boast
of it, Lochmore."</p>
<p>"You are pleased to instruct me, Colonel Walton," said the
quarrelsome fellow, climbing on to his dignity.</p>
<p>But the Colonel laughed, and clapped his shoulder. "Not I.
Advice is not instruction."</p>
<p>"It is sometimes presumption."</p>
<p>The Colonel ceased to laugh.</p>
<p>"So it is. I'll presume no more."</p>
<p>The meeting took place next morning in the magnificent park of
Saint Germains. On the way to it Lochmore, walking with a strut and
a forward thrust of his incipient paunch, talked of what he would
do to that damned Irish rapparee. The Colonel silent and dejected,
regretting that he should have allowed himself to be drawn into an
affair in which he could perceive only folly, let his lordship talk
on uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Lochmore never came back from that morning walk under the
dappled shade of those great elms that rose like the pillars of a
cathedral to support the green roof above. The powerful, but heavy
and sluggish earl, was no match for the light, quick Irishman, nor
had he Burke's obvious experience in arms.</p>
<p>The fight was over almost as soon as it began, and Lochmore, his
throat transfixed, lay on the turf and yielded up his foolish,
obstinate, lonely soul.</p>
<p>Almost the only tears that were shed for him were those of
Burke, who in an emotional storm of contrition called God and the
Colonel to witness that he had never meant to do his lordship any
mortal hurt.</p>
<p>Colonel Walton had a bad quarter of an hour with King James when
he went, as was necessary, to render an account of the affair.
Burke, on his advice, had gone off to report himself to Sarsfield,
under whom he served, and to invoke that great soldier's
protection. He was helped, too, by the testimony Colonel Walton
gave of the young Irishman's willingness at one time to make the
peace although he had received a blow. But Colonel Walton, who had
enjoyed the King's confidence, bore now the brunt of the royal ill
humour and left the presence with a sense of being in disgrace.</p>
<p>He sought Invernaion. Deeply shocked though he was by the event,
Invernaion was not so shocked as not to be able to recognize
Colonel Walton's good offices, however vainly employed. Warmly he
expressed his gratitude to him for his endeavours and also for
having stood by the unfortunate Lochmore in that disastrous
meeting.</p>
<p>The only good that resulted from the deplorable affair was the
bond which it set up between Invernaion and Colonel Walton, who
became firm friends from that hour.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-05" id="ch-05"></a>Chapter 5. Rejection</h2>
<p>The news of the Earl of Lochmore's death was conveyed to his
Countess by her kinsman, Glenleven, who, with great tact, came
dressed in mourning for the occasion. Also he was aware that black
became his slight supple figure and contrasted effectively with his
fifty-guinea blond periwig.</p>
<p>He came prepared to offer consolation, but the young widow
evinced no immediate overwhelming need of it. True, she went white
and limp, and sat down abruptly under the shock of the tragic news.
True, she shed a tear or two. But they were of a grief less
passionate than had been Burke's. Her pity was chiefly concerned
with the futility of her lord's end. Had he fallen in battle, or
had his life otherwise been given to profit the cause, her sorrow
would have been of a different order, full of reverence, and
Lochmore's memory would have remained sacred to her. But he had
died as he had lived, in no loftier cause than that of his
blundering vanity and aggressiveness. Since he had never learnt,
and never could have learnt, how to conduct his life, such a man
was better at rest.</p>
<p>The news came at a time that was full of other preoccupations
for one who was as stout and enterprising a champion as her
ladyship of the exiled King. The disaster to the French Fleet that
was to have convoyed the transports bringing over the army of
invasion, and the brilliant affair of La Hogue had inflicted a
cruel disappointment upon those Jacobites who, secretly armed, had
been awaiting the signal for the insurrection. Despair had stilled
their rising insolence. They made haste to bury their weapons and
to hold their tongues. Further to repress them there had been some
arrests, and these by a broadminded government that practised
lenity as a matter of policy.</p>
<p>There remained, however, a gallant band which rejected
pessimism, maintained a patient fortitude and kept its eyes
confidently upon the future. Glenleven, so newly converted from his
Whig sympathies had, after the fashion of converts, flung himself
so passionately into Jacobitism that he was perhaps the most
prominent in this band. His stout courage in that autumn of '92,
his constant assertion that steadfastness of purpose must in the
end prevail, was an inestimable source of strength to her ladyship.
It enheartened her to persevere in spite of set-backs in the work
of political sapping and mining which she had made her own.</p>
<p>Nor was it only on political grounds that she and Glenleven were
associated. When the period of mourning retirement which the
decencies dictated was at an end, she availed herself of the
offices of her kinsman and was to be seen with him in public, at
court, at the playhouse, in the park, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Despite their close kinship Glenleven wooed her with a devotion
obvious to all but herself. A man who hitherto had led something of
a gay life, who was accounted, in fact, something of a rake, and
classed by the puritanical with that elegant, accomplished
profligate, Tom Wharton, he became suddenly a model of sobriety and
circumspection in his habits, confined his gambling within harmless
limits and forsook gallantry entirely.</p>
<p>Common report perceived calculation in this. But to the malice
of the world of fashion that was inevitable. Because Glenleven's
past bold play and general libertinism was known sorely to have
reduced his never very considerable fortune, and because the
beautiful and stately young widow was known to have been left
handsomely endowed, it was assumed that his present circumspection
was strategic. To confirm this it was erroneously assumed by some
that Ian Macdonald's life was all that stood between his sister
Ailsa and the possession of the broad acres of Invernaion. And Ian
Macdonald's life did not promise to be a very long one, considering
that already there was a price of two thousand pounds placed by the
government upon information that would lead to his arrest.</p>
<p>They were not aware, those malevolent gossips, that Glenleven
had wooed his kinswoman with the infinitely greater directness of
an avowed ardour in Lochmore's lifetime, when there could have been
no mercenary ends to serve. But then, had they known it, they would
have said that this was no more than in harmony with habits which
left the daughter, sister or wife of no friend immune from his
pursuit. From the world's irresponsibly malicious tongues there is
no security.</p>
<p>Nothing of all this, however, reached the ears of Glenleven.
Again like that Tom Wharton, between whom and himself so many
parallels were drawn, Glenleven could take care of himself too well
sword in hand to make men careless of words uttered in his hearing.
Serenely, then, he went his devoted, reformed ways, always at hand
when her ladyship might need him, be it as escort, as counsellor,
or as political confederate. In addition his presence did her the
inestimable if unperceived service of holding aloof those other
gallants who had been assiduous in her husband's lifetime, and, but
for Glenleven, would have been more assiduous now.</p>
<p>At last, towards the end of the year, Glenleven opined that he
had long enough practised reserve, and that the time had come to
claim the reward of so much self-denying devotion.</p>
<p>He had supped with her ladyship on the eve of Christmas, and
they had passed into the library, which was ever her favourite
room. It was a spacious chamber, panelled in rich, dark walnut, in
hue akin to that of the tooled calf bindings that along one side of
it completely filled the shelves. For Lochmore's father had been
possessed of an affectation of scholarship, and he had assembled
and displayed here the outward signs of an inwardly absent grace of
mind. His portrait by Lely, the only picture in the room, gazed
down from its place above the overmantel, a dour, dark, puritanical
visage, with the prominent nose and obstinate chin which his son
had inherited. Tall windows, now concealed behind heavy velvet
curtains of a golden brown, overlooked the garden and the
water-gate, giving access to the river.</p>
<p>The room that night was at once warm and fragrant, from the
cedar logs blazing on the wide hearth. These provided also, by her
ladyship's wish, the only present light. It was snug and pleasant
thus in that mellow chamber of which the leaping flames revealing
much, left more in mysterious shadow. Its sheltering luxury was
stressed by the moaning of the snow-laden wind outside.</p>
<p>Lady Lochmore in the depths of a winged armchair directly faced
the blaze. Glenleven stood beside and a little behind her, leaning
on the edge of the chair's tall back. The mellow setting and the
mellow moment seemed to him appropriate. This, he felt, was his
hour.</p>
<p>Bending over her, he broke, abruptly but softly, that spell of
languorous silence.</p>
<p>"Ailsa, my dear! How long now has it been within your knowledge
that I worship you?"</p>
<p>She did not stir, and from where he stood he could not see her
face. But when presently she answered him, her tone held little
promise of any responsive tenderness.</p>
<p>"I remember that you used to distress me with the avowal."</p>
<p>"At least, it need not distress you now. Now that you are free
to listen."</p>
<p>"If you had waited until now to say it, I might listen less
unwillingly."</p>
<p>"Can the torrent wait when the snows above are melting in the
sun?"</p>
<p>"We are poetical."</p>
<p>"Why should we not be? It is the proper language of deep
emotion, and&mdash;God knows&mdash;not inconsistent with deep
sincerity."</p>
<p>She laughed a little, very softly "How often has that sentence
done duty already, Jamie? The melting snow, the torrent and the
sun? How often have you rehearsed it?"</p>
<p>"Cruel! Why will you mock me?"</p>
<p>"It is not mockery to ask a plain question."</p>
<p>"If you so ask it, I must disdain to answer. I have said that I
love you."</p>
<p>"You do not understand, Jamie. Had you not said it at a time
when to say it approached insult..."</p>
<p>"Insult!" he cried out in horror, interrupting her.</p>
<p>"To an honest woman who has a husband, and who has made no sign
to invite such an avowal, the assumption that it could be welcome
is an assumption of her frailty. Is there no insult in that?"</p>
<p>He sighed. "Shall we leave the past?"</p>
<p>"It will not leave us, Jamie. It remains always, to be a part of
the present. Had you not made love to me then, when to hope that I
would listen was to hope that I was a wanton, I should hear you
less mistrustfully now."</p>
<p>"You overstate that past," he complained, in distressed
impatience. "You forget that you were a woman unhappily
married."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, Jamie. I don't forget it. Nor that you were famed as a
consoler of unhappy wives. You regarded them as your legitimate
prey. No doubt you still do. We do not readily forsake our habits,
and I should know little peace or happiness with a husband who had
those."</p>
<p>"Ailsa, your words are killing me. Since I have known you, I
have lived for you. No other woman has been in my dreams."</p>
<p>"Not in your dreams, perhaps. But dare you tell me how many
there have been in your waking hours?"</p>
<p>He let his arms fall heavily to his sides in an expression of
despair. "It is the eve of Christmas..." he was beginning, when
again with laughter in her voice she cut him short.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I know. The season of goodwill." She rose, and turned
fully to face him, a slim graceful silhouette against the
firelight, her face provokingly in shadow. She held out her hands
to him. "Let there be goodwill between us, Jamie. But no more talk
of love, save such as should link two cousins. I have been married
once, and God knows it was a dismal experience. Then I could not
help myself. Now that I am free again I prize my freedom. I will
never barter it except for the utter certainty of happiness. That
certainty, Jamie, you do not offer me."</p>
<p>He had taken the hands she proffered, and he tightened now his
grip of them.</p>
<p>"What can I do to prove you wrong?"</p>
<p>"Nothing, Jamie. For nothing would prevail against my knowledge
of you."</p>
<p>"Ailsa!" His melodious voice trembled with emotion. The
firelight flickering on his narrow face revealed in it an anguish
of supplication. "Ailsa!" He sought to draw her to him, but she
resisted, laughing ever a little in her determination not to allow
the scene to assume too serious a note. Fearing to annoy her, he
abandoned the attempt; but he still clung to her hands. He was very
humble. "Ailsa, I understand. I see the prejudice against me. I
have only the folly of my past to blame. But do not doom me to
suffer all my life for that. Remember that a man needs inspiration
to rise above the nature with which he is endowed. In you, my dear,
I have found that inspiration, and since I found it my life has
been ordered as you would have it. I will not press you now. But I
want you to know that I shall continue so to order it. And this
whether I am ultimately to win you or not. This because I cannot
now hold myself. You are so much to me, my Ailsa, that I could not
do otherwise."</p>
<p>The deep sincerity of his tone, and that musical moving voice,
touched her senses if not her reason. Long afterwards she admitted
that he had won with her in that moment an advantage which, if he
had pressed it, might have broached the ramparts she had reared
about herself. But his experience, although wide, did not run along
these lines, and the sincerity that at last had entered into him
made him falter.</p>
<p>She was so desirable as she stood before him there, so much a
woman whose possession must fill a man with pride that he could
take where she was concerned none of the gamester's risks, over
which in the case of another he would never have hesitated.</p>
<p>Having spoken, he stood there, silent and still, like one who
for the moment has no more to say. This silence endured some little
time.</p>
<p>It became almost unnatural. Then, still without speaking, she
gently disengaged her hands from his grasp, uttered a little sigh,
and resumed her seat.</p>
<p>"Ring for light, Jamie," she said, in her even, friendly voice.
"And bid Angus bring the punch."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-06" id="ch-06"></a>Chapter 6. The Assassination
Plot</h2>
<p>Certain it is that the orderly circumspection of Glenleven's
life continued very fully to be maintained, and that the town's
worst tongue could find no grounds upon which to impute to him the
slightest irregularity. His public reward for this was that the
backbiters now sneeringly alluded to him as the reformed rake. His
private reward lay in the fact that Lady Lochmore, hearing these
sneers on one or two occasions, was moved by them to a greater
kindness for him.</p>
<p>Apart from what concerned his hopes of ultimately winning her,
their association in those days had become more close and constant
than ever. Considering that its real source was Jacobitic, it was
perhaps as well that in the eyes of court and town it should wear
the veil of a tender motive.</p>
<p>As yet, however, there was nothing in their actions to draw upon
themselves the eyes of a tolerant government. Lochmore House, it is
true, had become a meeting-place for such avowed friends of King
James as Lord Claybourne, Sir Hamish Stuart of Meorach, Major Denis
O'Grady, Sir John Fenwick and that Sir John Friend who so lavishly
spent on sedition the great fortune he had amassed from brewing.
But so long as they came there to discuss the long-drawn war with
France and the grievances to which it was giving rise, the abject
state of the currency and the ever-increasing confusion resulting
from it; to express the faith born of hope that soon the entire
country, weary of the usurper's misgovernment, would be ready to
rise and to drink to the health of the King over the Water; so long
they attracted no attention. Nor for some time did they, nor, for
that matter, did any other of the numerous groups of Jacobites
astir in the country, do more than talk.</p>
<p>Not until the comparatively sudden death of the gentle and
amiable Queen Mary did the season for activity appear to have
arrived.</p>
<p>Whilst the interminable war dragged on, it was necessary for
King William to spend half the year in camp, out of England.
Hitherto in his absences the ship of state had been steered safely
and shrewdly by the Queen. Who, it was asked, would steer it
now?</p>
<p>The position of this Dutchman who governed England, always
precarious, appeared all at once to have become impossible. And
King William, crushed under the burden of his sorrow at the loss of
one so truly dear to him, seemed by the numbness of his spirit to
improve the opportunity of his enemies.</p>
<p>No time was lost in seizing it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, unheralded, reckless of the price upon his head,
Invernaion arrived in London. He came straight to his sister's
house, which he knew would offer him a safe asylum; for nowadays
she employed no single servant, male or female, who was not a
Macdonald. For the same reason he announced to her, as soon as a
fond greeting, spiced on her side by a tender alarm, had passed
between them, and when she came to question him upon the motives of
his presence, that he had given appointment there to two loyal
friends of King James who were to co-operate with him in what he
came to do.</p>
<p>The gladness of her welcome to him was quickened rather than
diminished by his news, all eager and zealous as she was to serve
the cause of the rightful King.</p>
<p>That these two loyal friends of exiled Majesty when on the
morrow they punctually presented themselves, were anything but
prepossessing nowise reduced her enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The first of them was Robert Charnock, a pompous, middle-aged
gentleman, unctuous of manner and booming of voice, who had been
Vice-President of Magdalen College, Oxford, in the late reign. The
other was George Porter, a slim, saturnine man of easy manners, who
assumed almost from the outset an attitude of gallantry towards her
ladyship. He was accompanied by a Frenchman, named de la Rue, a
raffish fellow, who enjoyed a certain unsavoury reputation as a
gambler, and bully, and who, even more outrageously than his
sponsor, glowed and smirked and peacocked before his hostess.</p>
<p>They were, it will be seen, plotters of a very different type
from the courtly dilettanti in treason whom her ladyship was in the
habit of entertaining at her seditious gatherings. Nevertheless,
for the sake of what her brother had told her that they were
prepared to do for the cause, she made them welcome and steeled
herself to endure them.</p>
<p>Glenleven, Fenwick and Friend, who had been hastily summoned,
were also present; and they served to supply a certain leaven of
decency to the gathering. Assembled in the library, that group of
conspirators heard from Invernaion what it was that he had crossed
the Channel to propose.</p>
<p>It was a simple plot, in all but the execution. Now that Queen
Mary was dead and buried, the sudden removal of the usurper before
he could appoint a regent to represent him in his absences must
result in chaos. Of this that vast majority of Englishmen who were
faithful to King James could not fail to take advantage.</p>
<p>The aim, then&mdash;and Ian Macdonald displayed to them his
commission from the exiled King&mdash;was to seize the person of
William of Orange. He was to be carried to France, where King Louis
would find a lodging for him whence he would never again emerge to
disturb the world.</p>
<p>Invernaion explained that Charnock and Porter had been indicated
to him as resolute, enterprising men, who would know how to assist
him in the execution of this design, and he invited not only these
but also the others present to put forward suggestions of ways and
means by which the kidnapping might best be accomplished.</p>
<p>Porter promptly gave the enterprise his benediction, and
swaggeringly announced himself at the orders of Invernaion.
Charnock, with less swagger, went further. He professed an
eagerness himself to plot the details when he should have
considered exactly the time and place most suitable, and he
expressed a solid confidence in his ability to do so with
advantage. Also he boasted himself prepared and able to find the
considerable body of men which would be necessary for the execution
of a scheme at once so bold and so difficult.</p>
<p>De la Rue, in a sense, went further still.</p>
<p>"I ask myself&mdash;nom de Dieu!&mdash;what for all this plaguey
trouble of kidnapping him, when a bullet will do the affair so much
more simply."</p>
<p>Porter, equally bloodthirsty gave the Frenchman his prompt
support.</p>
<p>"In God's name, why not? It's cleaner and quicker, and it will
need fewer hands. Therefore the risk will be less."</p>
<p>Invernaion's grave dark eyes looked from one to the other of
them.</p>
<p>"For my own part, I have no arguments to oppose to you, save
that killing is not in my orders. These are definite. So, by your
leave, sirs, we will keep to them."</p>
<p>"I am relieved to hear it," put in Sir John Fenwick. "For I tell
you roundly that murder is not at all to my taste."</p>
<p>Sir John Friend solemnly nodded his support of Fenwick. "Myself,
I could even wish that your orders did not go as far as they do. I
am ready to spend my last crown in promoting a rising and in
mounting and equipping men, but I have little stomach for schemes
of violence against one man."</p>
<p>Glenleven's melodious voice interposed.</p>
<p>"We should hardly allow squeamishness to dictate our course in
dealing with one who, himself, has never shrunk from violence. Even
if murder were the proposal, I, for one, should remember that we
would be paying the murderer of Glencoe in his own coin."</p>
<p>"That," said Invernaion, "was my own argument at Saint Germains.
But I was overborne."</p>
<p>"Thank God you were," said Friend, with fervour. "For it was an
argument upon a false premise. The news may not have reached you in
France, sir, that the business of Glencoe has lately been the
subject of a commission of inquiry."</p>
<p>He addressed himself to Invernaion, but it was Glenleven who
answered him.</p>
<p>"Whether Invernaion has heard of it or not, I have certainly
heard of it. You will conceive my interest. But you will not fail
to weigh, Sir John, that the commission pronounced the affair an
act of murder."</p>
<p>The portly little man swung to him, with some heat. He was
emphatic. "But not against King William," he declared. "It came out
in the inquiry that the order signed by him could not be construed
as a warrant for the butchery that was perpetrated."</p>
<p>"Then why," asked Glenleven, "are not those prosecuted who
maliciously so construed it?"</p>
<p>"You know that they are," Fenwick intervened. "Hamilton,
Glenlyon, and Lindsay will be hanged when taken."</p>
<p>"And the Master of Stair?" asked her ladyship in a cold, hard
voice. "And Breadalbane?"</p>
<p>Fenwick looked at her in surprise, and read in her pinched lips
and pallid cheeks the depth of emotion stirring in her.</p>
<p>"The Master of Stair," he gently reminded her, "has been
disgraced by the King."</p>
<p>She laughed without mirth. "That contents you, Sir John? The
officers who executed the explicit orders of the Master of Stair
are being hunted as murderers. But the man who issued the order,
the huntsman who unleashed those dogs upon the quarry, is merely
disgraced. Does that look as if he has misconstrued the order he
received in his turn from above? Is not the conclusion that those
poor tools of his who are being pursued for murder, are mere
scapegoats, sacrifices offered up to the indignation that has been
aroused in every humane heart?"</p>
<p>Sir John was continuing to stare at her, surprised at once by
her vehemence and her lucidity. Invernaion, who had been silently
attentive, explained her.</p>
<p>"We are Macdonalds, Sir John: my sister and I. To us this is a
family affair. The blood so remorselessly shed was the blood of our
kin."</p>
<p>Fenwick bowed his fine head in understanding. Not so, however,
Sir John Friend. He took up the argument. "Do not, I beg you, allow
that circumstance to obscure your judgment, as it so easily may.
Where is King William's motive for ordering that massacre? What
possible object could he hope to serve? Can you suppose that this
Dutchman, who has never even been in Scotland, could have been
concerned to order a slaughter of Macdonalds. Isn't it plain that
it was he who was a tool? That he was misled by those of his
advisers who had a grudge against the men of your clan?"</p>
<p>"It might be plain," said Invernaion, "if he had hanged Stair
and Breadalbane."</p>
<p>And again her ladyship laughed, this time at the readiness of
her brother's retort. She leaned across the table about which they
were grouped. "Ay! Answer that, Sir John," she challenged the
brewer-knight.</p>
<p>"It is easily answered, my lady," he was beginning, when
Charnock, out of patience, interrupted him in his booming
voice.</p>
<p>"My dear Sir John, I begin to suspect that you are well-named
Friend. King William's friend."</p>
<p>De la Rue smacked the dust out of his breeches to the
accompaniment of a horse-laugh at the gibe. Porter grinned broadly,
whilst the others gravely considered the little brewer's
spluttering confusion.</p>
<p>"You are me-merry, sir," he protested. "None knows be-better
than yourself how far that is untrue. I'm a non-juror, as all the
world knows. Just as all the world knows that Sir John Fenwick,
there, who is laughing at me, took the oath."</p>
<p>Fenwick, a passionate man, flushed darkly "It looks as if we
might both be liars, then."</p>
<p>This brought Friend in anger to his feet. "I take that ill, Sir
John." By the look of him he would have added a good deal more had
not her ladyship rapped the table with her knuckles and called them
both to order.</p>
<p>"Are you not wasting time and tempers, sirs? It is a way of your
sex to reproach mine with inconclusive wordiness. But whither are
you straying now?"</p>
<p>Fenwick was instantly submissive. He bowed his head to her until
his face was in the shadow of his periwig. "We deserve the rebuke.
Do we not, Sir John?"</p>
<p>Friend gave a grumbling agreement, and then begged to be allowed
to take his leave. King James, he protested, had no more loyal
subject than himself. For what concerned a rising, the provision of
arms, the equipping and mounting of men, and the like, they could
call upon him to disburse his last shilling. But since his
conscience was opposed to any other ways of over-setting the
throne, there could be no profit to themselves or to him in his
remaining now.</p>
<p>He was allowed to go, and his departure became the signal for
the breaking-up of that meeting, since nothing further was to be
done by talking until ways and means had been devised, or, at
least, until some practical suggestion could be tabled. Charnock
and his associates were to communicate with Invernaion again as
soon as they should have a settled plan to lay before him.</p>
<p>But although there were further meetings in the days that
followed, and in spite of Charnock's confidence in his invention,
of practical suggestions there were none. And this because it was
realized by all of them when they came to grips with the question
that the difficulties of kidnapping King William were almost
insuperable.</p>
<p>Once these difficulties were recognized by Invernaion, Charnock
put forward, indeed, a plan. But it was simply a plan of
assassination.</p>
<p>As before, Invernaion acknowledged that he did not shrink from
such an act, but reminded them again that his hands were tied by
his commission, which did not permit him to authorize murder.</p>
<p>In this deadlock he was urged by Charnock and Porter to return
to Saint Germains, to expound there the situation as he now
understood it, and to endeavour to prevail upon King James to widen
the scope of the commission.</p>
<p>So back to France went Invernaion, whilst the conspirators in
London held themselves in readiness against his return, and in the
meantime were busy recruiting further Jacobites to the
enterprise.</p>
<p>But weeks passed without Invernaion's reappearance, the reason
being that at Saint Germains and Versailles wider measures were
being concerted than at first had been contemplated, and time was
necessary for these.</p>
<p>Finally, the spring being well advanced, King William sailed for
the Netherlands to resume the campaign, thus rendering impossible
the execution of any plot against his person until his army should
once more have gone into winter quarters.</p>
<p>But by the time he came back in the autumn, increased in credit
by his victory at Namur, not only was everything ready, but King
James, himself, was now a very active participant in what was to
do. The Duke of Berwick was secretly in England, accompanied by
Colonel Walton, to organize a Jacobite rising in strength. King
James was on his way to Calais to place himself at the head of
twelve thousand French troops lent to him by Louis XIV, with which
to come to the support of his loyal subjects so soon as the rising
took place.</p>
<p>The moment for this rising should be that of the confusion
resulting from the death of William of Orange, a death which
consequently was now an integral part of the great plan.</p>
<p>To direct this initial step, Invernaion returned at last,
accompanied by Sir George Barclay, who seems in many ways to have
been employed as a mask for him. This time Ian Macdonald came
fortified by a commission from King James widened to the point of
authorizing him to "undertake against the Prince of Orange such
acts of hostility as should most conduce to the service of the
King."</p>
<p>A few specially selected officers followed, and these and others
who desired to communicate with the royal agent were informed that
he was to be found on Mondays and Thursdays after nightfall walking
in the Piazza at Covent Garden with a white handkerchief hanging
from his pocket.</p>
<p>This agent was sometimes Ian Macdonald himself, but more
commonly Sir George Barclay, who would pass on these applicants and
recruits to Invernaion.</p>
<p>Invernaion meanwhile had resumed communication with those
leaders, Charnock, Porter, de la Rue, and yet another named Cardell
Goodman, and through them he made the acquaintance of many more
bold, resolute fellows whom they were gradually bringing into the
affair. For it had been decided that no less than forty men would
be necessary for the undertaking as now planned if they were to
make sure of succeeding in it.</p>
<p>There were, however, no meetings this time at the house in the
Strand. Although the young Countess of Lochmore in her eagerness to
serve the cause urged her brother freely to use her house, he
refused to involve her in a matter so dangerous. Instead, he
assembled his plotters, now at the Old King's Head in Leadenhall
Street, now at the Blue Posts in Spring Gardens, now in other
similar resorts.</p>
<p>Whilst new recruits were daily being brought to these meetings,
there was one important secession. Sir John Fenwick had withdrawn
as soon as it had been made clear to him that the assassination of
the Prince of Orange was to be the prelude of the projected
revolution.</p>
<p>He would shed, he announced, the last drop of his own blood to
bring back King James, but he would be no party to the shedding of
the blood of King William. He would keep their secret; but he would
associate with them no further.</p>
<p>They let him go, too well aware of the stoutness of his
Jacobitism, of which he had already given overwhelming proof, to
fear betrayal by him.</p>
<p>The tale of that great Assassination Plot has been told so often
that no more than the briefest summary need here be rehearsed.</p>
<p>It failed because of that which is ever to be apprehended when
great numbers share a secret.</p>
<p>All was ready and each of the men participating was assigned to
his post in an attack to be made upon the royal coach at Turnham
Green on Saturday, the 15th February, when the King would be on his
way to hunt in Richmond Park.</p>
<p>Some two or three days before, Porter had brought in a young
Catholic gentleman from Hampshire who owed him great favours. This
gentleman, William Prendergass, an ardent Jacobite, was, like Sir
John Fenwick, ready enough to bear a hand in a rising but would
have no part in murder. Going further than Sir John, not only would
he have no part in it, but it appalled him to stand passively aside
and let this thing be done.</p>
<p>Prendergass was torn between his Christian duty to avert the
crime, and his duty to Porter, imposed by gratitude for past
kindnesses, which made it impossible to betray him to the gallows.
In his quandary, he finally attempted to be loyal at once to both
these duties.</p>
<p>He went on Friday, the 14th, to Kensington, obtained an audience
of the Earl of Portland, and adjured him as he valued the life of
the King not to permit His Majesty to hunt upon the morrow.</p>
<p>He was as explicit as he dared to be, more explicit even than he
need have been.</p>
<p>"King William," he said, "is the enemy of my religion, yet my
religion constrains me to give you this caution."</p>
<p>Naturally, this was not enough for William Bentinck. He desired
to know more; a great deal more. But Prendergass had no more to
tell him.</p>
<p>"Ask me no questions, my lord; because I cannot answer them.
Many of those in the plot are my friends, and one of them is my
benefactor. Neither threats nor promises will induce me to betray
their names."</p>
<p>At last Portland suffered him to depart, and King William did
not hunt upon that Saturday, giving out that he was indisposed.</p>
<p>It was vexatious to the plotters who had everything prepared
down to the minutest detail. Delays, Invernaion knew, were
dangerous. Still, what had not been done on that day would be done
upon the following Saturday.</p>
<p>But on the evening of the following Friday Prendergass was sent
for by Portland, and by Portland introduced to the presence of the
King.</p>
<p>Little Hooknose was very gentle with him, and used great
tact.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the disclosure made was enough to lead him
to suspect every man about him, enough to embitter his life, but
not to preserve it. He confessed his obligations to Prendergass,
but represented strongly to him that having said so much, he must,
perforce, say more.</p>
<p>The Hampshire gentleman, in deepest distress, spoke of his
benefactor who was one of the leading spirits in this plot, and of
the impossibility of betraying him to his death. At last, when
further pressed, he demanded a promise from the King that the
information he could give would be used only to prevent the crime
and not to destroy the criminals. King William passed him his word
of honour that the information should not be used against the life
of any man without the consent of Prendergass.</p>
<p>Then, at last, the Hampshire gentleman spoke freely. He named
the plotters, and claimed, under the royal promise, the safety of
Porter.</p>
<p>On the morrow, as on the previous Saturday, all was again
prepared, each man assigned to his post in the attack. Prendergass,
himself, was appointed to be one of the eight who were to fire into
the coach after the Lifeguards had been surprised and routed.</p>
<p>But, also as on the previous Saturday, again the King did not
hunt, and this time there was panic among the conspirators, for a
trooper in the Blues, who was, actually privy to the plot, warned
one of them, named Keyes, that there were queer rumours afloat. On
the heels of this warning came news that the guards at the Palace
had been doubled.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Invernaion sought to rally their fainting courage.
He urged them to stand fast, and, supported by Charnock, proposed
that they should fall upon the King next morning as he drove out of
Hyde Park on his way to chapel.</p>
<p>But in the early hours of that Sunday morning Charnock was
arrested. Other arrests followed fast. Before noon seventeen of the
conspirators were in custody, and the remainder were hunted so hard
and diligently that within a few days all were taken with the
exception of Invernaion and Barclay. These two, with a heavy price
upon the head of each as a reward for his apprehension, had
successfully eluded capture.</p>
<p>How they could have got away during those days when such was the
vigilance that it was, almost impossible to perform a journey
without a passport or to procure post-horses without the authority
of a justice of the peace, remained a vexatious mystery to the
government. That the authorities were in no doubt as to
Invernaion's presence and share in the business was shown by a
military invasion of Lochmore House. It was searched from cellar to
garret. But beyond this her ladyship was not molested.</p>
<p>That the fugitives had got clear away was soon plain. For the
government heard from their spies across the water that Invernaion
and Barclay were at Calais with King James and the army mustered
there, which&mdash;now that the plot had failed&mdash;would no
longer embark to attempt the invasion of England.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-07" id="ch-07"></a>Chapter 7. The Aftermath.</h2>
<p>A lenient government, expressing the will of a lenient monarch,
was content with the execution of eight from all those conspirators
who had been rounded up.</p>
<p>Charnock, that sometime Vice-President of Magdalen College, was
among the first of these. Porter, who deserved death more than any
of them, went free on the stipulation of Prendergass, and further
paid for that freedom by giving evidence for the Crown against his
associates. De la Rue and Cardell Goodman, following Porter's wise
but unsavoury example, also saved their necks by turning
informers.</p>
<p>The testimony of these men, among others, enabled the government
to proceed vigorously against those Jacobites who whilst not
directly concerned in the Assassination Plot, had nevertheless
either tacitly given it their countenance or had otherwise
conspired against the King de facto.</p>
<p>In this, the country was solidly behind the government. Out of
the general horror which a plot so abominable inspired, had sprung
a reaction of such popularity for King William as he had not known
since he landed at Torbay in the hour of the country's need of a
champion to defend it from the tyranny of James.</p>
<p>Among those so arrested in that aftermath were Sir John Friend
and Sir John Fenwick, neither of whom had given the plot his
countenance. Glenleven, suspecting that the evidence which had sent
them to the Tower might also have incriminated him, had practically
determined to join Invernaion across the Channel, when his own
arrest took place.</p>
<p>It happened at the house of his kinswoman Lady Lochmore one
April evening, and added to the dejection under which that
misguided lady already lay in those unhappy days, a dejection which
she had been bitterly expressing to him.</p>
<p>In her view the cause seemed definitely ruined, not only because
the blow had failed, but because in failing it had actually gone to
swell the credit of the usurper.</p>
<p>Glenleven, however, and despite anxieties on his own account,
was not disposed to take so gloomy a view.</p>
<p>"My dear, you leave out of your reckoning the volatile
inconstancy of the mob. The people are swayed emotionally at the
moment; that is all. When this wave of sentiment passes, and they
are face to face with stark realities again, we shall hear fewer
shouts of 'long live King William.' The higher this wave of
emotionalism lifts the popular mind, the deeper the trough into
which it will presently sink. Be sure that this will follow When it
does, then will be our opportunity."</p>
<p>With a resolute smile on his thin, firm lips, he stood before
her, an incarnation of virile grace, an inspiration of courage.</p>
<p>"I would I had your confidence," she sighed. "Meanwhile the only
thing I hear are these horrible execrations of Ian's name. What do
they know, who execrate him so bitterly, of the selfless devotion
by which he is inspired?"</p>
<p>He shrugged. "That, too, will pass. Heed it no more than you
heed the wind that howls under the eaves. The one is as fickle as
the other."</p>
<p>She looked at him, and there was a kindling of admiration in her
glance.</p>
<p>"You have no fear for yourself, Jamie, while this hunt is
up?"</p>
<p>"Fear? No. Not fear." He spread his elegant hands. "But I have
misgivings. Who enters upon a gamble must set a stake upon the
board, and must be prepared to lose it."</p>
<p>"You are very brave."</p>
<p>He laughed, almost ingenuously, as if covering his pleasure in
that flattering speech of one from whom he coveted flattery but
seldom earned it.</p>
<p>"No. Not brave. Merely clear-sighted. So is King William's
government. And it is to this that you may attribute such clemency
as it has displayed. It will not take the risk of nauseating the
public with too much blood. For that same reason it is unlikely
that they will make any more victims."</p>
<p>He was about to add that, nevertheless, his preparations were
made to go abroad for a while, that on the morrow he would be
setting out, and that this was really a leave-taking visit, when
her next words arrested him.</p>
<p>She had fetched a sigh. "I would I could be as confident as
you."</p>
<p>He drew nearer by a step, an awakening excitement in his glance.
If his peril rendered him glorious in her eyes, then in peril he
would remain. As he had just observed, who gambles must set a stake
upon the board, and in a game for such a prize as he accounted her,
he was ready to stake all.</p>
<p>Not since that stormy night, now long ago, when snug in this
same room the lover had peremptorily been bidden to withdraw into
the kinsman, had Glenleven ventured again to suffer the lover to
come forth. But though unobtrusive, that lover had ever been
patiently alert, watching for an opportunity to re-emerge. That
opportunity he seemed now to perceive, and he was prompt to its
call.</p>
<p>"Why so?" he asked. "What have you to fear?"</p>
<p>"Your impeachment," she answered frankly</p>
<p>"It gives you concern?" He was wistful.</p>
<p>"Do you need to ask? What should I be, Jamie, if it did
not?"</p>
<p>He looked deep into her eyes. His wistful smile expanded,
softening the harshness of his countenance. "How sweet is peril
that will arouse such tender fears."</p>
<p>And then a knock fell upon the door, and her butler Angus
entered the room. Glenleven cursed the inopportuneness of the
interruption until he perceived the scared expression on the
servant's face, and something more. Angus did not come alone. An
officer in a red coat was on his heels. This officer came forward,
brushing past the butler, whilst two troopers surged upon the
threshold.</p>
<p>Glenleven understood, and his heart sank like a stone through
water. He had delayed too long.</p>
<p>Her ladyship had risen in alarm, a hand at her bosom. The
officer, hat in hand, was bowing low before her.</p>
<p>"What is this, sir?" she asked him.</p>
<p>"I crave your ladyship's indulgence." He straightened himself,
and looked gently at Glenleven. "I have a writ for your attachment,
my lord. I was told to seek you here if you were not at your own
lodgings."</p>
<p>Glenleven had drawn himself up. He had lost a little colour;
but, at least, he had recovered his momentarily shaken
self-possession. There was a whimsical smile on his lips as he made
an answer whose full meaning was for her ladyship alone.</p>
<p>"Though on such an errand you could never have been opportune,
yet you could hardly arrive more inopportunely than you do. What is
the charge against me, sir?"</p>
<p>"High treason, my lord."</p>
<p>"No less? Ah, well. To protest to you would be to waste your
time, captain. Such things are to be borne. My sword is below, sir,
at your disposal. Will you give me a moment in which to take my
leave of her ladyship?"</p>
<p>The officer looked at him shrewdly "You give me your word, my
lord, that you will make no attempt to escape?"</p>
<p>"My word of honour. Why should I escape? I shall be as well
lodged in the Tower as elsewhere, and I can assure you that I have
nothing to apprehend beyond that."</p>
<p>"I trust so, indeed, my lord." The officer bowed. His tone
changed to curtness. "Make the most of five minutes."</p>
<p>He withdrew with Angus; the door closed; and Glenleven and her
ladyship were left alone together.</p>
<p>She flew to him at once, and set her hands on his shoulders.</p>
<p>"Jamie!" she cried. The consternation which had blanched her
cheek and dilated those deep blue eyes left her no words beyond
that piteous ejaculation of his name.</p>
<p>His voice and manner were very soft and tender.</p>
<p>"Nay, sweet!" Soothingly his fingers stroked her lustrous black
hair. "Nay! I am not on Tower Hill yet. And by God's help and yours
I never shall be."</p>
<p>"By my help? By mine?" She seemed to ask him did he mock
her.</p>
<p>His fingers paused in their caress. He gripped both her wrists
and held them, her hands still upon his shoulders.</p>
<p>"Listen," he bade her sharply, in a sudden excitement. "Listen
carefully. The thought has only just occurred to me:
providentially, perhaps, before it is too late. The law requires
two witnesses before it can convict a man of treason. If I had but
thought of it sooner I might have provided. Of all those who could
have witnessed against me only two remain alive, saving Fenwick,
who is himself under arrest and moreover quite dependable. Those
two witnesses, however, are both informers: that blackguard Porter,
and that other blackguard de la Rue. If by bribery or otherwise
either of them could be induced to leave the country, the
government would be powerless to proceed with my impeachment.
Porter dare not go. That arch-Judas knows that his life would not
be worth a moment's purchase out of England. But with de la Rue it
is different. He is French, and at a price he might be glad to
repatriate himself. Will you send for him and see what you can do?
He is commonly to be found at the Blue Posts. If you can induce him
to leave England, I am safe. Whatever you find it necessary to
spend I will refund as soon as..."</p>
<p>"Leave that," she interrupted sharply "Whatever the cost, Jamie,
it shall be done, if it can be done. And it will be money spent for
the cause."</p>
<p>"Ah, no!"</p>
<p>"Ah, yes! I can afford it. You cannot. No need for pretences
between us, Jamie."</p>
<p>"We'll talk of this again. I may not stay now. Have courage, my
dear. Fear nothing. God keep you safe."</p>
<p>He kissed her for the first time. And considering in what case
he stood, and how soon, in spite of all that she could do, those
lips might be cold, she did not refuse him hers.</p>
<p>His eyes were very tender, his smile very gentle. "Thus I am
made strong," he said, and loosed her wrists.</p>
<p>When he was gone she lost no time. Not only did she send one of
her trusty Macdonald footmen to the Blue Posts in Spring Gardens
with a note requesting Monsieur de la Rue to wait upon her at the
earliest moment, but she sent another riding down to Romney Marsh,
to the sequestered house of the smuggler Hunt, who was always ready
to handle Jacobite contraband. The servant bore a letter for
Invernaion, which Hunt was to smuggle across the Channel with the
utmost dispatch. It conveyed to her brother, in the cipher that she
used with him, the bare fact of Glenleven's arrest.</p>
<p>That done, she sat down to wait for Monsieur de la Rue.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a>Chapter 8. Monsieur de fa
Rue</h2>
<p>Monsieur de la Rue kept her ladyship waiting for three days.</p>
<p>By the time he appeared she was almost distracted by impatience
and anxiety.</p>
<p>He came with a swagger, a man of forty, of middle height, lean
everywhere save at the waist, where he exhibited the beginnings of
a paunch. His dress with its tarnished lace displayed a tawdry
attempt at modishness. His cheap brown wig looked as if it had come
from a tub in Rosemary Lane. His mean eyes were bleary, his face
mottled, save where the razor had left his cheeks blue-black.</p>
<p>On being introduced, and finding himself alone with her
ladyship, he simpered and made a very elaborate leg, sweeping the
floor with the limp feather in his black castor. In her memory he
had already been unprepossessing; in actual fact she found him now,
at these close quarters, grotesquely repulsive.</p>
<p>"Madame!" He bowed. "Ma reine!" He bowed again. "To serve you.
Your most humble obedient." He bowed yet a third time, more
profoundly than ever. "You send for me. Oh, but I am so honoured. I
come like the wind. I am here."</p>
<p>"God knows you are," said her ladyship, with the suspicion of a
sniff. "But nothing like the wind, save in your wordiness." Sharply
she added: "It is three days since I sent for you."</p>
<p>"You conceive that I delayed? Oh!" His tone conveyed the pain he
suffered under such an imputation. Then he laughed it to utter
scorn. "Oh, that! Three days! Que Dieu me damne! You think I make
you wait three days? You think my own impatience wait so long? Not
three minutes, milady, from the instant your command is in my
hands. I come at once."</p>
<p>She liked neither his leer, nor the ardour in his little
eyes.</p>
<p>"Sit down," she said, and her tone was one of command rather
than of invitation.</p>
<p>"Madame permits?" He hitched his sword forward, and sank into a
chair, placing his hat on the floor beside him.</p>
<p>"There is a service I require of you, Monsieur de la Rue."</p>
<p>"I am the most fortunate of men. It will be a happiness to serve
milady."</p>
<p>"It will also be profitable."</p>
<p>"Oh, that!" De la Rue waved a scornful hand. "I listen."</p>
<p>"What interest keeps you in England, Monsieur?"</p>
<p>Surprise at the question was reflected in his blotchy face. He
took time to answer, and in that time his eyes considered her from
head to foot with an appraising glance that turned her hot with
shame. In self-defence she increased the haughty peremptoriness of
her manner. She tapped the floor with her foot. "Well, sir? Is the
question difficult to answer?"</p>
<p>"It is not so easy," he said, and smirked. "It is not nice to
kiss and tell. No? Oh, but I will be frank with you. Enfin! I am of
a susceptibility, milady. Romantic! It is my weakness. And so,
while I love France, I am kept here by this so tender heart." He
placed in the region of it a hand that was none too clean. "First
there was Madame la Duchesse de Cleveland. Beautiful woman, oh, but
so exigent, that one. Then there was Milady Belcastle." He was
ticking them off on his fingers. "Next come..."</p>
<p>She cut him short, angrily contemptuous. "Lord, man! Do I want a
catalogue of your good fortunes?"</p>
<p>He opened his mouth in surprise, to show a row of sound if
yellowish teeth. His tone was aggrieved.</p>
<p>"But it is the explanation that madame requested. The
explanation of why I continue in exile."</p>
<p>"I see," she answered tartly "I hope that such strong reasons as
these are now all in the past, and that you have no such bond to
hold you here at present."</p>
<p>"Oho! But have I not, milady? Never so strong a bond as
now."</p>
<p>Mastering her repugnance she made an effort to look into that
sly, leering face. She concluded that his low cunning had guessed
her aim and that he was making difficulties so as to increase the
price.</p>
<p>"Faugh! Will a thousand pounds break the bond?"</p>
<p>Watching him as she spoke, she perceived that she had startled
him. Some of the fire perished in his countenance. He meditatively
stroked his chin, then left his hand to screen his mouth. Between
the blotches his cheeks had turned ashen.</p>
<p>From these signs she knew that she had offered too much; that by
the magnitude of the sum offered she had betrayed the magnitude of
her need.</p>
<p>"A thousand pounds, milady!" he said in a sepulchral voice. "But
a thousand pounds for what?"</p>
<p>"To take yourself off to France at once, and stay there."</p>
<p>He continued to stare for some seconds. At last he uncovered his
mouth and disclosed the grin that curled it. He was himself
again.</p>
<p>"I understand, I think." He slowly winked at her. "There are
things I could tell. Inconvenient things, is it not? Things which
might cost some lives. Oh yes. And for this a thousand pounds?"</p>
<p>"Five hundred down, and five hundred to be paid to you by my
brother in France when you are there."</p>
<p>He hunched his shoulders. "It might be. Yes, it might be." His
tone was reflective. "But it is dangerous in France for me. Very
dangerous. You see, I am here because in France I kill a man once.
Oh, but in a duel. In honour. I am a great swordsman. So all was
fair. But this man's family is noble, and they complain to the
King. They will move my process. Perhaps it is not yet forgot. You
see the danger, milady?"</p>
<p>"You need not stay in France. You need not even go there. There
are other countries where a man of your enterprise should prosper.
All that I really require of you is that you leave England."</p>
<p>"But where shall I go if not to France? Must I live expatriate
all my life? Here in England I am habituated now, and I can live.
But where else? In Italy?" His grimace repudiated the idea. "In
Spain? Oh, that!"</p>
<p>Again she perceived here no more than tactics to advance the
price of his consent. And from extreme anxiety fell, herself, into
the worst of tactical errors.</p>
<p>"To compensate you I would raise the figure. See: I will double
it. What do you say now?"</p>
<p>His eyes were smouldering as they pondered her again. He sighed
and the fawning note in his voice increased when he replied.</p>
<p>"Milady, no man could resist to do your pleasure. I least of all
men, ma reine. What is it to me that I put my life in peril, so
that I serve you?"</p>
<p>She strove with her nausea. "You agree, then?"</p>
<p>"Oh! But should I not agree?" He leaned towards her, his eyes
hideously liquid, his voice softened, pleading and oily "I only
ask, ma reine, that you add a mark of your favour."</p>
<p>"Of my favour?" she frowned. "What better mark than this two
thousand pounds?"</p>
<p>He continued to ogle her, leering, for a long moment before he
spoke. It was almost as if in the silence he would communicate his
thought, by the force of it, directly to her mind. Then, as she
made no sign, he gave it utterance.</p>
<p>"Something the sweet memory of which would give me strength and
courage in my last hours if I have to pay with my life for having
done your pleasure."</p>
<p>The fixed stare of her eyes in that white face were a sufficient
evidence of her suspicion and her horror. Yet in a toneless voice
she said: "I do not understand."</p>
<p>He shifted on his chair. He sat further forward, so that by
leaning over he might just have touched her. "Is it so difficult
then, to understand? Oh, I am poor yes. I am misfortunate. And so I
cannot make the big gesture and refuse your two thousand pounds.
Yet not for two thousand, not for twenty thousand pounds alone
would I do this thing. But for love... For love, ah yes, my
queen."</p>
<p>He propelled himself still further, and suddenly was down on one
knee at her feet, reaching out hands to paw her.</p>
<p>She sprang up instantly, less in anger than in such a feeling as
must have been hers if in the public street someone had bespattered
her with ordures.</p>
<p>"God!" she choked, as she thrust her chair backwards to make
room for her recoil.</p>
<p>But Monsieur de la Rue continued to kneel before her, with bowed
head and outflung arms. "What do I ask that should so affright
you?"</p>
<p>"You do not frighten me, monsieur. That is not at all the
word."</p>
<p>"Not the word? What word, then?" But he did not await her
answer. He ran torrentially on. "I pay perhaps with my life for
what is to do. And I am glad to pay. Oh, yes. If I give that, I
give all. Don't you understand? Will you not, then, be generous,
too, with me?"</p>
<p>"Get up, man. Go!"</p>
<p>But he merely looked up from his knees in hurt surprise. He saw
her standing erect there, forbidding, majestic, all cold and
self-contained, save that the tumult in her alluring breast
betrayed her inward agitation.</p>
<p>He shrugged and flung out his arms again, clicking his tongue
against the roof of his mouth. "Bien!" He got slowly to his
feet.</p>
<p>But his resignation was by no means that of despair. She had
betrayed her need to be so terribly compelling that no price within
her means could be too high. Thus, at least, the rascal read her.
"I see. I am abrupt, is it not? I take you by surprise. It was to
have been foreseen." He sighed. "I go now. Yes. But I come again.
Perhaps tomorrow. You will think of what I say. No? You will come
to see that if I risk my life..."</p>
<p>"Oh, go," she angrily exploded, and stepping past him to the
fireplace pulled the bell-cord.</p>
<p>From the threshold, when Angus held the door for him, he threw
her a cong, and the leer on his face was of unabated
confidence.</p>
<p>"A bientt, ma reine!"</p>
<p>He waited three whole days before presenting himself again. In
this his patience was that of calculation. He accounted himself
very experienced in the operations of the human heart; and his
experience told him that to ensure himself a welcome he must bring
this lady, whose need of him he had gauged to be so obviously and
desperately urgent, to the point of fearing that he might not come
again. The fear that a chance has been lost is a seed of bitter
regret from which future wisdom may spring.</p>
<p>The promptitude with which he was admitted confirmed him. The
austerity with which the lady received him he supposed to be
assumed.</p>
<p>He bowed, fantastically as ever, when they were alone.</p>
<p>"Me voici, ma reine. I said I should return. I am here to do
your service."</p>
<p>"At my price, Monsieur de la Rue?"</p>
<p>"At your price. Oh, yes. Assuredly at your price. And also at
mine."</p>
<p>She had remained seated to receive him, and intended so to
remain, with the fellow standing before her throughout the
interview. Thus she would mark the difference in their stations,
and of that difference make a barrier against his ineffable
impertinences. But at his last words her resolve was forgotten. She
sprang to her feet, quivering with indignation. She spoke in a
choking voice.</p>
<p>"Insolent dog! I will have you whipped from my door."</p>
<p>He laughed. He shrugged. He flourished himself. He set a hand on
his pummel and his head on one side to regard her. "Words, and a
woman's. We have a proverb in France that a woman's tongue does no
dishonour. So I am not angry. No, no. I understand. But you waste
time. Consider, my queen, that you have no choice. Oh, yes. A
choice: to let this poor milord Glenleven be convicted of high
treason, and then..." He drew a hand edgewise across his throat.
"Bon son! He is dear to you, this good milord Glenleven. Because he
is dear to you I will risk my life to save him. Does not that
deserve all that a woman, a great lady, can give? Oh, madame! You
think perhaps, because I am like this, that we are not equals.
Because you see me poor, you think that I am a roturier. Ah that!
Look at me. Yes, look at me well." He drew himself up, and threw
back his head in its cheap, ill-kempt wig. "Me, I am noble. That
jumps to the eye. The beautiful Madame la Duchesse de
Cleveland..."</p>
<p>He was allowed to get no further. She had been looking at him as
he invited her, but with eyes that held only disgust. She had
mastered, not her anger, but the heat of it.</p>
<p>"Noble! De la Rue in name, and de la rue, in fact. A nobleman of
the streets, of the kennels. It is finished! Go! I do not need your
service."</p>
<p>"You do not..." His mouth opened in astonishment. Then it closed
with a snap. "Peste! You play comedy with me. You want to laugh.
Why, you never needed a man's service more."</p>
<p>"Angus!"</p>
<p>The call was answered with a promptitude that startled the
Frenchman.</p>
<p>"The door! Monsieur de la Rue to the door!"</p>
<p>Monsieur de la Rue made a great display of dignity. He drew
himself almost on to his toes. His left hand pressing on his hilt,
thrust the sword horizontally behind him. He was white with
rage.</p>
<p>"To the door, eh? Monsieur de la Rue to the door, eh? It is as
you would say, madame, milord Glenleven to the scaffold."</p>
<p>In her changed expression he thought he saw that at last he had
really touched her; thought that she had caught, as indeed she had,
in his mocking tone the threat that he would precipitate the doom
she sought to bribe him to avert.</p>
<p>"Stay," she said. She put a hand to her brow. Then she waved
Angus out again. "Wait, Angus."</p>
<p>The servant withdrew, wooden of face, but alert of eye.</p>
<p>"Listen, Monsieur de la Rue, I am sorry for what I said."</p>
<p>Instantly he melted. "Not another word, madame. The regret mends
all. We are going to talk reasonably. Like two good friends.
Yes?"</p>
<p>"I am going to offer you," she said slowly, "three thousand
pounds to do as I require. It is a fortune, Monsieur de la Rue. You
will accept?"</p>
<p>He thought her almost piteous in her eagerness. He bowed a
little.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. I will accept. I had already accepted less. But could
I be so ungallant as to forgo what I prize above all the gold of
Peru? Ah, fi donc! What should I be then, eh?"</p>
<p>Involuntarily the words broke from her. "What should I be?"</p>
<p>"You, milady? Oh! The Duchess of Cleveland."</p>
<p>"Silence, man. Have you no decency at all?"</p>
<p>"Decency!" He was momentarily lost in amazement. Then he thought
he understood. "Ah! You fear I talk. Because I tell you of the
beautiful Barbara, and of Milady Belcastle, and so on, you think I
talk too much. You think..."</p>
<p>"Silence, you foul coxcomb! Be silent, do you hear?" She was
suddenly all imperiousness: a great lady speaking to an impertinent
lackey. Her tone and mien dominated him in spite of himself.</p>
<p>"If you dare to speak again except to say yes or no, I'll have
you whipped till the blood runs from your back. Keep your hands
from that sword, fool. It won't avail you against the whips of my
grooms, and they are within call. I'll have no heroics from you, my
man. Now then. I have offered you a sum of money upon certain
terms. Do you accept or not?"</p>
<p>He stood silent, ashen-faced, his eyes that had ogled so
adoringly holding now only malevolence. Thus for a long moment
before he spoke.</p>
<p>"If I accept, you pay me the half at once, you said?"</p>
<p>"I said so. Yes. That was before I understood with what a rat I
am dealing. You shall be paid when the service is rendered, when
you are safely abroad; and you shall be paid in instalments to keep
you honest for the necessary time; in instalments of five hundred
pounds a year."</p>
<p>He was surprised and indignant. "Oh that! How do I answer that?"
he was beginning, with a resumption of his earlier insolence.</p>
<p>But she checked him instantly "You will answer it just yes or
no. That's all."</p>
<p>He broke out violently, snarling like a threatened cur. "Then
no, no, no, mille fois. Goddam! No."</p>
<p>"Angus!" was her instant call, and instantly again Angus
appeared.</p>
<p>She waved an eloquent hand, turned her back upon Monsieur de la
Rue, and moved down the room with a leisurely grace, as if
concerned no further.</p>
<p>"Milady!" said the Frenchman.</p>
<p>But she took no heed. It was Angus who spoke next, peremptorily,
from the door, which he was holding. "Come, mossoo. Out of
here!"</p>
<p>To Monsieur de la Rue this was the end of the world. He could
not believe that it was real. He showed his teeth in a livid grin.
Even his blotches had paled. He did not actually spit, but he made
a sound that simulated the act, and on that turned and moved
heavy-footed to the door.</p>
<p>He crossed the threshold, and disappeared into the dimly lighted
hall. Uproar followed instantly.</p>
<p>Within the room her ladyship stood tense, listening, a smile,
faintly mocking, on her white face.</p>
<p>Monsieur de la Rue's bellowing voice came charged with wild
rage.</p>
<p>"Trahison! Sacre canaille! Trahison!"</p>
<p>The outcry was followed by sounds of panting, of grunting, of a
smothered laugh or two, of slither of receding feet, and then a
distant muttering.</p>
<p>After a moment Angus re-entered. He wore a half-repressed
grin.</p>
<p>"The carle craves word wi' your ladyship."</p>
<p>She nodded. "Bring him in."</p>
<p>He came, propelled by two stalwart Macdonalds, a sorry
spectacle. He was without hat or wig or sword; his coat was torn
from shoulder to waist; his neckcloth was in disorder and his face
inflamed; his hands were tied behind him, and his ankles so hobbled
that he could little more than stand. He foamed at the lips as he
addressed her ladyship.</p>
<p>"You think this will serve, milady? You think I am such a fool
as to come into this danger without my little precautions? Ha!" He
laughed savagely "Ah that! Not me. I give you warning. If I do not
return to my friends they will know where to find me."</p>
<p>She smiled upon him, exasperatingly tranquil.</p>
<p>"If that were true," she said, "you would be safe only so long
as you did not warn me of it. Then your friends would have a chance
of finding you. You are a fool, de la Rue. But not such a fool as
not to realize that. If it were true you would not dare to take the
risk of your friends not finding you when they came. You would
reflect, and reflecting you would remember that the river runs at
the bottom of my garden. It is only a poor cozener who would be so
rashly foolish as to threaten. Be thankful that I perceive it.</p>
<p>"Take him away Angus, and bestow him in the cellar, to cool. His
humours are a little ardent."</p>
<p>They dragged him unceremoniously out, spitting threats and
blasphemies.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a>Chapter 9. Invernaion's
Raids</h2>
<p>It was four days after that safe bestowal of Monsieur de la Rue
in the cellar of Lochmore House when Ian Macdonald arrived in
London in answer to his sister's appeal. Her messenger had made
good speed, and he, himself, had made even better, spurred by
generous anxiety for his kinsman.</p>
<p>He came accompanied by a young Irish officer, named O'Brien, who
had been at the Boyne and at Limerick and who had elected at the
end to go overseas with Sarsfield.</p>
<p>Never was Ian more welcome to his sister, whose anxieties
increased with every day that the amorous Frenchman spent in her
cellar.</p>
<p>She informed both Ian and his companion of Glenleven's situation
and his need: how he could be made safe by the elimination of one
of the only two witnesses against him. But it was to Ian alone that
she related the full circumstances in which she came to hold de la
Rue a captive.</p>
<p>He was inflamed with anger at the monstrous story.</p>
<p>"I marvel you could have practised such self-restraint; that you
did not bid them tie a stone to his neck and cast him into the
river. It is done every day with curs less foul."</p>
<p>Gradually, however, his seething rage gave way to mirth at the
picture his mind evoked of the Frenchman's ultimate discomfiture.
O'Brien was brought in and informed, with certain omissions, that
de la Rue was here under their hand.</p>
<p>The young Irishman chuckled his delight and regarded the slim,
stately Countess with eyes of adoring wonder.</p>
<p>"Ye've contrived it finely. Faith, it's a man's heart your
ladyship carries in that lovely breast. It's behind the fair we
are, Macdonald. The thing is done already."</p>
<p>"Not quite," said Invernaion. "He can't be left here."</p>
<p>"To be sure not." The young Irishman was standing by the window
whence he could view the sloping garden and the river. "And isn't
the water handy. The tide'll carry the blackguard comfortably to
sea."</p>
<p>Invernaion shook his head. "No," he said. "We'll have to take
him back with us over the water."</p>
<p>"Sure, now, wouldn't he be safer under it? But as ye please.
Since we have him here to our hand we need lose no time about
it."</p>
<p>But again Invernaion did not agree. "There's Ailsa," he
objected. "I'll not have her needlessly compromised. If it were to
become known..."</p>
<p>"How should it?" she interrupted. "And what matter if it
did?"</p>
<p>"Setting aside that you're my sister, and that I love you,
you're too valuable to us. And no suspicion must fall on you that
would diminish that value. It's bad enough that you should have a
marked man like me for a brother." He slipped an arm about her
waist, drew her to him and kissed her cheek.</p>
<p>"My use here is the only reason against which I will not argue.
But if you don't take him from here, where he is helpless, what
then?"</p>
<p>"I'll take him elsewhere, never fear. And I shall see that it's
known that I've taken him. That will make you safe. Meanwhile be
sure that I shall not let him out of my sight when he leaves your
house."</p>
<p>"Aren't you taking an unnecessary risk, Ian?"</p>
<p>"Risk? I hope I may never face a worse."</p>
<p>They dined in comfort as the day was fading. At dusk they took
their leave.</p>
<p>"In five minutes' time you may let this Frenchman loose," said
Ian.</p>
<p>No sooner had they departed than she sent Angus to fetch the
prisoner.</p>
<p>De la Rue, fierce as a newly caged hawk, reared himself on his
pallet to glare at them.</p>
<p>"Well, my Scots jackals? Has the she-cat come to her
senses?"</p>
<p>"Come out of that," said Angus. "I'm to show you the door."</p>
<p>"The door?" Monsieur de la Rue almost feared that he was being
mocked.</p>
<p>"Ay, we're sick o' the sight of your blotchy face. So be
stirring now."</p>
<p>De la Rue came to his feet. "Am I to see milady?"</p>
<p>"Ye're not. Her ladyship's seen too much of you already. Come
on."</p>
<p>"Listen, my friend. You will tell her ladyship that it will be
good for her friend that she see me again. And bad&mdash;very
bad&mdash;for him if she do not."</p>
<p>"My orders," said the stolid Angus, "are to show you the
door."</p>
<p>"But, my friend..."</p>
<p>"I am not your friend. To Hell with your impudence. Here, my
lads, help him out."</p>
<p>Protesting to the last, they dragged him above and thrust him
ignominiously from the door.</p>
<p>When it had closed upon him he shook his fist at it, and cursed,
virulently and profusely, all whom it sheltered.</p>
<p>Then, with dragging feet, he went raging down the steps, across
the flagged courtyard, to the tall wrought-iron gate that opened
upon the Strand. He passed out and clanged the gate furiously after
him. Then he stood, in the dusk, undecided which way to turn his
steps.</p>
<p>There were few wayfarers about at that hour, and most of these
were moving briskly. But near the eastern end of the railings that
enclosed her ladyship's courtyard, two men, who might have met by
chance, stood idly chatting and laughing together.</p>
<p>De la Rue took at last his decision. He turned to the right, and
went off quickly, brushing past those loiterers. He never looked
behind him as he made off. But even had he done so it is unlikely
that they would have allowed him to perceive that they were
following.</p>
<p>He made his way towards the Fleet. A little beyond Temple Bar he
dived into an alley on the right that ran down towards the river.
Midway in this an open doorway flung a rhomb of yellow light across
the narrow way in which night had already fallen. De la Rue's
figure was for a moment a black silhouette in this patch of light.
Then he had vanished through the open doorway of the Crowing
Cock.</p>
<p>A full five minutes later two gentlemen of a quality rarely seen
in that haunt stood in the inn's flagged passage, and the taller of
the twain beckoned the vintner from the tap-room.</p>
<p>"Have you a room at hand where we can be private?" The speaker
displayed a guinea.</p>
<p>The vintner blinked, received with bowed back that golden token
of good will, and ushered them at once into a small room beyond the
tap.</p>
<p>"Your worships'll be private in here, and cosy. What may I serve
you?"</p>
<p>The tall dark stranger assumed a confidential manner. "I have
cause to believe that a Monsieur de la Rue is in your house. I have
a word of particular importance for him. Will you ask him to wait
on me here?"</p>
<p>The vintner, a lanky, evil-looking fellow, whose proper place
seemed to be within the Liberties of Whitefriars, rather than just
without them, looked searchingly at his visitor.</p>
<p>"I am not sure as there's anyone here o' that name. What was it,
did ye say?"</p>
<p>"De la Rue. And I know that he is here, because I chanced to see
him enter. A very fortunate chance for him and for me. I'll be
obliged to you, landlord."</p>
<p>The vintner went out, closing the door. There was a pause, and
then, at last, steps on the flags of the passage, which came to a
halt at the door. Another pause, and abruptly the door was flung
open.</p>
<p>Monsieur de la Rue stood on the threshold, raking the room with
a mistrustful eye. He saw only O'Brien, who directly confronted
him. Invernaion had taken up such a position that the door as it
opened made a screen for him.</p>
<p>O'Brien advanced a step with an inviting smile.</p>
<p>"Come in with you, Monsieur de la Rue. Sure it's the luckiest
chance now for both of us that I should light upon you in this way
Just as I was after wondering where I could be finding ye. Come you
in, then. Come in, and close the door."</p>
<p>Seeing only one man, be his disarming amiability genuine or not,
the mystified de la Rue did as he was bidden, and turned to close
the door. In the act of doing so he uncovered the man whom it
concealed. He started violently, checked, looked closely, and
loosed a panic-stricken outcry.</p>
<p>"Invernaion!"</p>
<p>That name; which recent events had rendered famous, reverberated
through the mean house, followed almost at once by the bang of the
door, as Ian Macdonald thrust his weight against it to close it
completely.</p>
<p>Before de la Rue could move, the muzzle of a pistol was rammed
hard into his stomach, and the young Scot was mildly warning
him.</p>
<p>"Another sound, my poodle, and I'll drill a hole in your guts
that will ruin your digestion for ever." He paused there, smiling
cruelly into that villainous, scared face. "Be sensible, and no
harm shall come to you beyond a little jaunt with me and my
friend."</p>
<p>De la Rue, watchful of eye, passed a tongue over his lips to
moisten them.</p>
<p>"What do you want with me?" His tone was defiant.</p>
<p>"Superfluous question! Search your memory of recent events.
You'll find the answer there. You were offered as much as three
thousand pounds to take a journey. You would not accept. You will
take that journey now for the sheer love of your life, and so as to
preserve it. All I desire, de la Rue, is your elimination, and I'll
not hesitate to eliminate you finally. If you want to avoid that,
you can do it by un-resisting obedience." Without turning his head
he spoke to O'Brien. "Philip! The door, if you please. And lead the
way."</p>
<p>They went out processionally, O'Brien leading, de la Rue
following and Ian Macdonald coming last, thrusting the Frenchman
onward with the muzzle of the pistol, pressed now into his
back.</p>
<p>In the passage they met the gaping landlord and a tapster.</p>
<p>"Give way there if you would be avoiding trouble," said the
Irishman.</p>
<p>The vintner, seeing no reason to risk a bullet, was so prudent
as to obey, and offered no obstacle to their departure. But as soon
as he judged it safe to do so, he ran off to inform the nearest
justice that that Jacobite traitor Invernaion had raided his house
and carried off Monsieur de la Rue under threats of violence.</p>
<p>There was a fine stir that very night. Whitehall was in
consternation. Even sedate Kensington was agitated. Order was
promptly taken. The ports were closed. But too late. Invernaion had
an ample start. The cutter that had brought him over waited at
Greenwich, and he was well out at sea before the messengers were
galloping with orders to stop him.</p>
<p>For a fortnight Invernaion's Raid, as the affair was called, was
the talk of the town. It was discussed with anger at such
coffee-houses as the Rose and Garraway's, and with laughter at the
Old King's Head in Leadenhall Street. That infant newspaper, the
English Courant, contained in four successive issues little more
than indignant leading articles on the subject. By the last of
these its readers were informed of intelligence from France
according to which Monsieur de la Rue had been handed over by the
audacious Invernaion to French justice, which had long been seeking
him for an affair which he described as a duel, but which the
French authorities regarded as a murder. This man whose testimony
on certain Jacobite matters was so valuable to King William's
government had been cast into the Bastille and would probably never
be heard of again.</p>
<p>As the matter was, at last, beginning to grow stale, interest in
it was revived by the reappearance in public of my Lord Glenleven.
He had been restored to liberty by a government which realized that
the effective suppression of one of the only two witnesses against
him made it impossible to bring him to trial.</p>
<p>On the day after his release he waited upon Lady Lochmore. He
came, of course, to return thanks. But he came also, and with
confidence, for something more. He came to resume that conversation
so inopportunely interrupted. He was to learn, however, how
different are the emotions excited by the case of a man who stands
in peril of death from those aroused by one who is secure.</p>
<p>He went with gay confidence into her ladyship's presence,
looking his best, his slight elegant figure set off by a coat of
royal blue that was richly laced with gold. He almost ran to her,
with a deep-throated cry of "Ailsa!"</p>
<p>Having kissed her at parting, it seemed to him proper that a
kiss should mark this happy reunion. In some such state of mind
she, too, may have suffered that warm salute.</p>
<p>Then he held her by the shoulders, at arm's length, and out of a
radiant countenance surveyed her.</p>
<p>"I owe you so much, my Ailsa," he cried. "My life, no less."</p>
<p>"You owe it to Ian."</p>
<p>The quick disclaimer and something chilly in her voice and
manner momentarily dimmed his radiance.</p>
<p>"To you and Ian, if you will," he insisted. "God knows I do not
forget his part in this. But neither can I permit you to diminish
your own. I owe my life to you both. To you I will repay the debt,
my Ailsa, by a life of such devotion as you have never dreamed
of."</p>
<p>Quietly she disengaged her shoulder from his fond grip. She drew
away a little. "You make too much of it, Jamie. There is no debt.
To a kinsman it was no more than a duty that we performed. And
certainly we claim no payment."</p>
<p>He strove with her coyness, as he supposed it. "Though you may
not claim it, it shall be made, my dear."</p>
<p>He approached her again. Again she drew back.</p>
<p>"If you would really pay, you will pay best by never alluding to
it."</p>
<p>Perceiving and interpreting his discomfited air, she judged it
proper to leave him in no doubt whatever of her frame of mind.
"That is my wish, Jamie. My definite wish. You understand. You will
save me, I hope, the need of saying more."</p>
<p>He understood, and discomfiture deepened to utter misery in his
countenance. "You bring me back to life only to deal me death."</p>
<p>She smiled wanly "Jamie! Jamie! Why will you talk so, as if you
lived in a romance?"</p>
<p>"I thought I did. It was life to me. Oh, Ailsa!"</p>
<p>She shook her head. "I know my mind. I doubt if I shall ever wed
again."</p>
<p>He looked at her dejectedly "I would make you so happy,
Ailsa."</p>
<p>"So Lochmore promised."</p>
<p>That stung him. "You compare me with him?"</p>
<p>"No, Jamie. No. I mean that it would need more than a promise to
persuade me into marriage."</p>
<p>"Do you find no more in me?"</p>
<p>"No more, Jamie."</p>
<p>"You may in time."</p>
<p>"Do not waste your hopes on that. Let us talk of other things.
Sit. And tell me how you have fared."</p>
<p>He surrendered at last, his will beaten down by her quiet
firmness. But he was dull on the subject of his captivity and of
this release of his which just then was supplying a subject for so
much gossip.</p>
<p>If, however, the matter of his escape had ceased, as he
romantically pretended to Lady Lochmore, to be of interest to him,
it was of interest to many others, and to none more than to Sir
John Fenwick, still languishing in the Tower. To him it was an
inspiration. As Glenleven had saved himself, so might he.</p>
<p>It arose out of this, that a few days later Lady Lochmore was
sought by Lady Mary Fenwick, Sir John's wife. Already that poor
distressed lady had flung herself at the feet of King William and
had presented a petition for her husband's life. His Majesty had
gently replied that it should be considered, but that the matter
was one of public concern; an answer which did not seem to her to
hold much promise.</p>
<p>If she did not cast herself at the feet of Lady Lochmore, she
flung her arms about her ladyship's neck and with tears implored
her to invoke Invernaion's help for Sir John as he had so nobly and
ably given it to Glenleven.</p>
<p>"We have tried," said the comely afflicted wife, "to help
ourselves. I employed a man to bribe Porter. Porter, that false
scoundrel, took the money I offered&mdash;three hundred
pounds&mdash;and then cheated me by handing my agent over to the
justices. There remains Goodman, who is the other witness against
Sir John. I dare not run the risk of a like failure with him. For
then all hope would be lost. But if he were served as de la Rue was
served, that would make Sir John as safe as my Lord Glenleven now
is."</p>
<p>"Why, then, don't you so serve him?"</p>
<p>"Whom can I find in England to undertake it? Don't you see,
Ailsa dear, that it needs someone from overseas, someone who
already dare not live in England while William of Orange is
King."</p>
<p>"You mean, in short, Invernaion?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Ailsa, I'ld not importune you so if I could look
elsewhere." Ailsa Lochmore was torn between distress for her friend
and concern for her brother.</p>
<p>"You realize the peril that Ian incurs every time he enters
England. You realize that this peril grows more and more acute;
that there is a heavy reward offered for his arrest, and that if he
is taken nothing in the world can save him. My dear, I grieve for
you, oh so deeply. But Ian is my brother, and I..." She made a
little helpless gesture with her hands.</p>
<p>They were instantly caught by Lady Mary "I know, dear Ailsa. I
know. But Ian is bold and clever and resourceful. And it is for the
cause, dear. Sir John is a valued servant of King James. His life
is of consequence to England. Oh what else can I say? If you fail
me, Ailsa, he is lost. And I love him so, my dear. It will kill me
if he perishes."</p>
<p>Lady Lochmore melted to the wife's distress. She took her to her
bosom. "Comfort you. I will send word to Ian. I do not say that he
will come. It will be for him to decide. But if I know Ian, I know
what his decision will be."</p>
<p>"I will pray God to watch over him in this enterprise," was the
fervent answer. "And I will pray God to bless you, too, Ailsa. I
will pray. It is all a woman is fit for at such times. Prayers and
tears."</p>
<p>And so it befell. Whilst still his last exploit was vividly in
the memory of the town, whilst the placards were still everywhere
to be seen offering two thousand pounds reward for information that
would lead to the capture of Ian Macdonald of Invernaion, he
reappeared again abruptly in London, accompanied as before by
Philip O'Brien. And almost as abruptly as he came did he depart
again, carrying off Cardell Goodman much as he had carried off de
la Rue, but with less violence. Goodman accepted a bribe to depart.
At the same time, so as to make sure that he earned the money,
Invernaion insisted that the fellow should go with him, and so got
him safely out of England and across the Channel.</p>
<p>This time the popular uproar and the indignation of the
government were loud indeed. It was intolerable that authority
should be flouted and the ends of justice thwarted in this
contemptuous manner by an insolent Jacobite.</p>
<p>This indignation expressed itself most eloquently in the sudden
raising to five thousand pounds of the reward for the apprehension
of Ian Macdonald of Invernaion.</p>
<p>Safe across the Channel, Invernaion could laugh at this. In the
Tower Sir John Fenwick, too, could laugh, and did, accounting that
the government had once again been effectively checkmated, and that
his enlargement was assured, impeachment being now impossible for
lack of evidence. Lady Mary laughed and cried at once when she came
to thank Lady Lochmore for the great service her brother had
rendered.</p>
<p>But they rejoiced too soon.</p>
<p>The government could not tolerate that it should be continually
cheated in this manner of the power to deal justice upon men whose
guilt admitted of no doubt. Soon, in connection with Sir John, the
ominous words Bill of Attainder began to be heard. That bill was
moved and passed in spite of all that his friends in Parliament and
out of it could do; and the end of that story is that Sir John
suffered for his treason on Tower Hill.</p>
<p>The event shook my Lord Glenleven's sense of security. It thrust
him out of his romantic pretence that life had ceased to interest
him. So far did he forget the tragic role of the hopeless lover
sighing for death that it was actually to Lady Lochmore that he
went to confide his fears. She sought to give him courage.</p>
<p>"Your case is not as Sir John's. Your treasons were never as
open and flagrant. Against him, too, there was the memory of a
public insult to Queen Mary, which William of Orange would not be
likely ever to forget or forgive. That may be why the law was so
violently strained against him. It is not to be supposed that it
would be so violently strained against you even had you not already
been set at liberty."</p>
<p>"My being at liberty need not count for much. The question is,
should I use this liberty to cross the Channel while there is
time?"</p>
<p>"If you are uneasy, you might so purchase peace of mind. You
have little to risk by contumacy."</p>
<p>He laughed sourly "Little? Faith, I have nothing, as you should
know. I don't own very much more at any time than the clothes I
stand in. Yet I should detest to be forced to leave England."</p>
<p>His eloquent hungry eyes, intently upon her, gave her the reason
plainly. Her utter unresponsiveness may have led him to add: "But
I'll consider it."</p>
<p>He was still considering when a message reached him ordering him
at once to wait upon Lord Portland at Kensington. To Sir Hamish
Stuart, of Meorach, who was with him when he received the command,
he expressed the melancholy opinion that once again he had waited
too long. Go to Kensington now he must. There was no help for it.
Although it was very likely, he dolefully opined, that from
Kensington he would journey back to the Tower.</p>
<p>This, his gloomy prognostic, however, was not realized. It was
known that at Kensington Palace he was closeted for two full hours
by the clock with my Lord of Portland. But he afterwards boasted
that although questioned and cross-questioned to weariness in that
time, he had successfully baffled that Dutch creature of King
William's.</p>
<p>And this would appear to be the truth, since he quitted
Kensington Palace a free man.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a>Chapter 10. Colonel Walton's
Leave-taking</h2>
<p>Colonel Dudley Walton sauntered with Invernaion on the noble
terrace of Saint Germains.</p>
<p>Although March was scarcely in, the sun shone with warmth from a
cloudless sky, and so clear was the air that the distant spires of
Paris were plainly visible from those heights.</p>
<p>In the years of waiting for the hour to strike in which he might
actively serve his King, the Colonel had retained in the French
army the commission, the duties of which he had discharged with
such distinction at Namur, at Steinkirk and elsewhere. Although a
well known figure at Saint Germains, it was only in the intervals
of that service, and chiefly when the army was in winter quarters,
that he had been seen there.</p>
<p>But all this was now at an end. The long-drawn war was over.
Colonel Walton had resigned the commission which he had lately held
under Villeroy, that feeble successor to the great Luxembourg, and
he had come to Saint Germains this time to resign something more.
He was really there on a visit of valediction.</p>
<p>His uncle, a fox-hunting Wiltshire squire, had lately died, and
Dudley Walton had inherited an estate which if small and partly
encumbered, sufficed, he announced, for his comparatively modest
needs. He, therefore, proposed to cross to England, make his peace
with King William's government, and abandoning the roving life of a
soldier of fortune, settle down peacefully to the cultivation of
his acres.</p>
<p>"I admire," said Invernaion, "the loyal frankness that brings
you to confess your intentions to His Majesty. That is what I
should expect in you, Dudley, once you have taken this resolve.
What I should not have expected is the resolve itself."</p>
<p>"I disappoint you," said the Colonel.</p>
<p>"To be frank, and because you are my friend, you do. You not
only disappoint, you bewilder me. I don't understand."</p>
<p>The Colonel halted, and Invernaion halted with him. They leaned
upon the parapet by which they had been sauntering. Fifty paces
away a lady and a gentleman were moving briskly towards them.</p>
<p>"Do you understand, Ian, that few things happen here that are
not reported at Kensington; that every coming and going is observed
by spying eyes, and communicated at once to King William's
government?"</p>
<p>"You ask me that? Me?" Invernaion laughed without joy "Does any
man understand it better? It is only here at Saint Germains that I
account myself safe nowadays from the agents of the Prince of
Orange. When I leave here I have to go under an assumed name, so as
to escape the attentions of those who are on the watch for me from
the moment that I am out of this." He spoke so, as if reproachfully
to stress the difference between Dudley Walton's case and his own.
"But what is that to the matter?"</p>
<p>"Something, if you consider it." The Colonel was smiling. "Damn
your enigmas, Dudley. Be plain."</p>
<p>"On some other occasion. Here is Sir Percy Lawrence with his
lady; to reproach me, I think."</p>
<p>Sir Percy who was frowning upon the Colonel was near enough to
have overheard.</p>
<p>"I'ld not venture quite so much, Colonel Walton. But I confess
to amazement at the news I hear of you."</p>
<p>He was a fleshy, pompous, florid man in the forties, by much the
senior of the dark, attractive lady who hung upon his arm.</p>
<p>The Colonel doffed his hat to them, and remained uncovered.</p>
<p>"Yet what matter is there for amazement? I have had ten
years&mdash;ten hard years&mdash;of soldiering. I grow old..."</p>
<p>"Oh, Colonel! Old!" simpered the lady</p>
<p>"Old enough, at least, to settle in life, now that fate gives me
the opportunity. Inheritance has its duties, ma'am."</p>
<p>"And your duty to the King, then?" quoth Sir Percy, tartly</p>
<p>"This is desertion, Colonel," the lady added, but without
tartness.</p>
<p>"What do I desert? What prospects really remain of a
restoration?" He shrugged and sighed, the natural melancholy of his
countenance deepening. "When last year's hopes failed, it seemed,
indeed, that the end was reached. Nothing since encourages
belief&mdash;alas!&mdash;that King James will need my sword. In
France, now that the war is ended, I can find no employment. Shall
I, then, stay to eat King James' bread in idleness?"</p>
<p>Sir Percy blew out his florid cheeks. "I protest, sir, that you
have no cause for such lack of faith."</p>
<p>"A matter of opinion, sir."</p>
<p>The knight's bulging eyes considered him without affection. "Do
you propose to take the oath?" he asked, almost offensively.</p>
<p>But the Colonel was unruffled. "It is a prudently lenient
government, King William's. I trust it will not press me."</p>
<p>"But if it should?" her ladyship insisted.</p>
<p>"I shall be in a difficulty. I do not know how I shall resolve
it."</p>
<p>"You'll know, I suppose, how honour should resolve it for you,"
said rude Sir Percy.</p>
<p>"With submission, Sir Percy, in what concerns my honour I shall
remain the only arbiter."</p>
<p>"Oh, to be sure." Sir Percy was now frankly contemptuous. "Well,
I thank God that my opinions are not as yours."</p>
<p>"Quoth the Pharisee," said Colonel Walton, smiling.</p>
<p>Sir Percy glared at him. "Come, my dear," he ordered his wife.
They bowed stiffly, and resumed their walk.</p>
<p>The Colonel put on his hat. He turned to lean once more upon the
parapet, his eyes on the placid river in the valley below, his lips
pensively smiling.</p>
<p>Invernaion, who had flushed for his friend at the tone Sir Percy
took with him, displayed now an angry frown. He waited until the
knight and his lady were out of earshot.</p>
<p>"It is not your way, Dudley, to receive insults with such
urbanity."</p>
<p>The Colonel's smile grew broader and more enigmatic. "That is
because it is not my way to deserve insults."</p>
<p>Invernaion's amazement increased. "Is that a confession that you
deserved these?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it plain? Only your friendship for me prevents you from
uttering words similar to Sir Percy's. They are in your
thoughts."</p>
<p>"But then... If you realize it, Dudley? If you, yourself,
perceive what is the only opinion: that what you do is unworthy...
Why?"</p>
<p>"I will tell you, Ian. It will explain something else that I
have said, but from which you could not extract the kernel of my
meaning."</p>
<p>And leaning there upon the parapet, Colonel Walton talked at
length, and so persuasively that when he had done Invernaion had
not a single argument to advance, a single adverse criticism to
offer.</p>
<p>The tale being told, Colonel Walton announced that it was time
for him to return to the palace, for the leave-taking audience he
had requested of the King. Invernaion linked arms with him as they
walked back, and so remained even when they had reached the
antechamber, and stood under the disapproving glances of those who
were already aware of the Colonel's intentions.</p>
<p>Knowing Invernaion's ardour of loyalty, it was supposed by some
that he could not yet be informed of the spirit in which the
Colonel was departing. One of these ventured to enlighten him,
after the Colonel had passed in to his momentous audience.
Invernaion's reply astonished all who heard it.</p>
<p>"What then? Dudley Walton is my friend. He remains none the less
my friend because his views in this do not happen to be mine."</p>
<p>The Colonel's interview with the King, at which none but Melfort
was present, proved a long one. At first this seemed odd to those
who marvelled that he should have the audacity to seek an audience
at all for the purpose of begging leave to depart to the care of
his paltry inheritance. Then it was remembered how high stood the
Colonel's reputation as a soldier; that such men were rare in the
following of King James, and consequently precious; and that
perhaps on this account His Majesty was stifling his pride in an
endeavour to persuade him to remain. That opinion persisted among
them even after the Colonel had departed at the end of an audience
that lasted fully an hour. In his departure, nevertheless, they saw
evidence of a hardness of heart which had remained impervious to
royal remonstrances.</p>
<p>This widespread assumption was confirmed by one or two
contemptuous expressions that Melfort let fall on the subject of
Colonel Walton, after his departure.</p>
<p>And such was the suggestion in those words from King James'
minister that before the Colonel had reached Calais to embark for
England, the members of the Court of Saint Germains had scornfully
dismissed so mean a fellow from their minds.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a>Chapter 11. The Beggar on
Horseback</h2>
<p>It would be fully twelve months after the discovery and failure
of the Assassination Plot, that is to say in the spring of 1697,
when after an absence of many years Colonel Dudley Walton made his
appearance in London.</p>
<p>By that time the calm that had settled on the life of England
was more complete than had been known since William of Orange had
landed at Torbay. Never had King William's seat upon the throne
been more secure. Never had he been so firmly established in the
public esteem.</p>
<p>That there were still in England Jacobites in plenty no one
doubted. But it was a thing assumed rather than perceived, for they
now hid their diminished heads and kept their politics prudently to
themselves.</p>
<p>Colonel Walton, then, seemed fully justified of his desertion of
a cause which no longer had any prospects.</p>
<p>His fame as a soldier and the knowledge of his long and close
adherence to King James were such that it was impossible that he
should be long in London without attracting the attention of the
government. Far, however, from seeking to elude this attention, the
Colonel actually, and at once, invited it. Immediately upon his
arrival he wrote a letter to William Bentinck, Earl of Portland, in
which he announced his presence to that diligent minister and
friend of King William. He wrote to inform his lordship that he had
inherited a small estate in Wiltshire, and that, so that he might
come home to administer it, he had resigned a commission which for
some years he had held in the French army. He went on to add that
since this did not mean that he was content to exchange the sword
for the ploughshare, nor that he had reason to suppose that the
inheritance would suffice for his needs, however modest, he had the
honour humbly to offer his services to King William.</p>
<p>This was a very different story from that which he had told at
Saint Germains, where he had announced himself as weary of
soldiering, had represented the inherited estate as abundant for
his needs, and had expressed the hope that King William's tolerant
government would ignore him.</p>
<p>He sat down to wait for an answer, keeping close meanwhile in
lodgings which he had taken in Covent Garden, over whose Piazza
that Barclay and Invernaion had rendered so famous to Jacobites in
the early part of the previous year. He was not kept waiting long
before Lord Portland sent for him. He had fully expected this. It
was not to be supposed that a communication such as his, from a man
such as himself, would be suffered to lie uninvestigated.</p>
<p>In a lofty room of the palace at Kensington sat Portland, to
receive him, at a large ormolu-encrusted writing-table with the
bowed legs which Dutch influences were introducing into English
furniture. The tall windows behind his lordship looked out upon a
sweep of emerald lawn to the paler green of burgeoning trees into
which the April sunshine brought a touch of gold.</p>
<p>The lean Dutchman, his sallow face, already set in shadow by the
fact that the windows were behind him, further obscured by his
heavy periwig, took time gravely to ponder his visitor. He had not
troubled to rise to receive him, and the nod with which he had
acknowledged the suitor's bow was scarcely perceptible.</p>
<p>Colonel Walton understood at once that no courtesies were to be
wasted upon him. As he had not been expecting them, he was not put
out of countenance. He stood entirely at ease, tall, straight, and
very elegant in his burnt-red soldierly coat that was heavy with
bullion, set off by the foam of Mechlin lace at throat and
wrists.</p>
<p>At the end of his long, searching stare, Portland cleared his
throat and spoke. His voice was deep and guttural, proclaiming his
origin. His words were hardly encouraging. To Colonel Walton they
sorted well with the voice.</p>
<p>"Considering your well-known antecedents," said his lordship,
slowly, picking his words with care, "I should scarcely exaggerate
if I described your application as impudent."</p>
<p>"You might do so. But you will not," said the Colonel dryly, and
set his lordship staring harder than ever.</p>
<p>"Parbleu! And why not?"</p>
<p>"Because you should be wise enough to know the folly of
unnecessary offensiveness."</p>
<p>The sallow face was further darkened by a scowl. But the Colonel
bore that expression of hostility without departing from his
composure. There was, indeed, about him an air of calm that was in
itself dominating. Instinctively it must be felt that a man who
could so command himself must exercise great power over others. It
is possible that my Lord Portland experienced something of this;
for gradually the hostility faded from his eyes, and at last these
slid away from the soldier's level glance. He uttered a dry little
laugh that sounded like a cough.</p>
<p>"Ah, parbleu! You account it offensive for a man in my position
to describe the past of a man in yours?"</p>
<p>"I had not remarked that your lordship was about to describe my
past. To save you that trouble let me declare at once the worst
that is known of me. I have ever been loyal to the hand that paid
me."</p>
<p>William Bentinck shrugged. "You have remained abroad until it
suits your interest to return to England. Both abroad and at home
you have borne arms against His Majesty. It is well known that you
were at the Boyne; that you were at Namur; that you were at
Steinkirk." He flung out a hand, to point scornfully to the
Colonel's loosely knotted lace cravat. "Tenez! You wear the very
neck-tie that the Maison du Roi made fashionable there." He smiled
sourly, with tight lips. "I am curious&mdash;and this is why I have
sent for you&mdash;to know upon what grounds you can found hopes of
being entrusted with a command."</p>
<p>"Your lordship's curiosity is soon gratified. My hopes rest upon
my ability as a soldier and your lordship's knowledge of it."</p>
<p>Lord Portland's smile lost nothing of its acidity "You have a
high opinion of yourself, Colonel Walton."</p>
<p>"I reflect the opinion in which I am held by others who are
competent to judge. I have here a letter from Monsieur de
Villeroy..."</p>
<p>He was carrying his fine hand to the breast of his coat. But his
lordship checked the intent, interrupting him. "Let be. Let be. I
care nothing for the opinions of Monsieur de Villeroy. Nor do I
need them where you are concerned. I know all that Monsieur de
Villeroy could tell me. Have you no other basis for these your so
extravagant hopes?"</p>
<p>"I could hardly possess any more solid."</p>
<p>"Tenez!" Portland considered him in some surprise. "Ah! Then my
curiosity is gratified." He took up a little silver bell and
tinkled it. "I shall inform His Majesty of your petition, Colonel
Walton. But my advice to you is that you cultivate your acres. It
is the only way to make sure that your antecedents will not trouble
you."</p>
<p>A servant in the scarlet royal livery made his appearance.
Colonel Walton understood. He bowed, ever impassive. If he was
disappointed by this dismissal or affronted by the cavalier manner
of it, he permitted no shadow to overcast his countenance.</p>
<p>"Your lordship's obliged servant."</p>
<p>He went out briskly, followed, as long as he was in sight, by
the dark eyes of the Dutchman, narrowed and speculating.</p>
<p>On the morrow he set out for Wiltshire.</p>
<p>It may have been a natural impatience to survey his heritage
that urged him to remove himself so speedily from the capital, or
it may have been a prudent desire to avoid the risks of a
compromising association with anyone suspected of Jacobite
sympathies. The latter explanation is to be preferred, because
there is hardly any other that will account for the fact that he
should even have neglected to wait upon Lady Lochmore. It might
certainly have been expected that he would have sought her,
considering the friendship that bound him to her brother, and the
fact that he had stood by her late husband in that unfortunate
nobleman's inglorious last moments. From nothing so much as from
this was it to be argued that Colonel Walton's divorcement from the
cause of King James was sincere and absolute.</p>
<p>He took up his residence in the modest country mansion at
Avonholme, and let it be known in the county, with a certain
emphasis, that he was there. After that he more or less disappears
for a season, by which I mean that records are lacking of his
activities, and that such scanty knowledge as we actually possess
is gleaned retrospectively from meagre particulars transpiring
after his re-emergence from country retirement. These, in spite of
the exiguity of detail, enable us to construct a fairly complete,
if tenuous, chain of events.</p>
<p>It would appear that within a week of establishing himself at
Avonholme he gave a house-warming party on a scale that supplied a
topic of conversation in Wiltshire for months thereafter. It seems
to have been of a prodigality not to be justified by his means or
his position in the county, or reconciled with his known habits of
sober restraint.</p>
<p>His repute as a soldier and his erstwhile notoriety as a
Jacobite combined to render him an interesting figure in all eyes
and a romantic one in some. Consequently that house-warming of his
was attended by all persons of quality in the county of Wiltshire
whom actual distance did not debar from the journey.</p>
<p>Not content with this initial display of munificence, Colonel
Walton continued thereafter to dispense at Avonholme a princely
hospitality similarly out of all proportion to his position and his
estate. On this account, whilst, courtly, suave and gracious, he
won the hearts of many, he provoked the sneers of more. His
contemners were chiefly the Whigs, who very soon, having satisfied
their curiosity, fell away from him. On the other hand, every Tory
in the county continued to seek his house and to entertain him in
return.</p>
<p>When all is said, there was little in this to excite unfriendly
comment. A man of his history could hardly be expected to find his
friends in the ranks of the Whigs.</p>
<p>Among the means adopted by county society to dissipate the
tedium of existence, high play was prominent. But it is to be
doubted if anywhere in Wiltshire play had ever run as high as it
did in those days at Avonholme.</p>
<p>Those who had known Colonel Walton abroad might have perceived
in this an instance of how a sudden accession of fortune may create
such a change in a man's habits as to involve a change in his very
nature. For until now cards and the dice-box had found no place in
the Colonel's equipment. Having adopted them, however, he seemed
unable to keep their use within reasonable bounds.</p>
<p>Before many months had elapsed, the Wiltshire Whigs were
justified of their sneering prognostications of what must be the
speedy end of this beggar on horseback. The Colonel
confessed&mdash;to the general surprise, however, of his Tory
associates, for fortune had seemed to favour him&mdash;that he was
so heavy a loser as to be under the necessity of liquidating his
estate so that he might clear himself of debt. He received the
county's expressions of commiseration with the unruffled suavity
and smiling calm which all had come to assume that nothing could
disturb.</p>
<p>After all, he opined, the necessity was perhaps a blessing in
disguise. His sojourn at Avonholme, whilst in other ways
delightful, had abundantly proved to him that his tastes and
talents were not agrarian. He supposed that he was too old to
change his habits; an assertion which, coming from a man in the
early thirties, was received as a jest. Upon the residue of his
fortune after the payment of his debts he would take a look at
England; and when this residue was spent he would return to France
to live once more by his sword like the soldier of fortune that at
heart he had remained.</p>
<p>The attractive little estate of Avonholme was readily sold to a
neighbouring landowner.</p>
<p>The Colonel paid his debts almost with ostentation, and
engagingly frank and open about his concerns, he allowed it be
known that he had saved some two thousand guineas from the wreck of
his affairs. Bewailed by Wiltshire society, he disappeared from it
completely after having so engagingly graced it. If his life as a
country squire had been brief, at least it had been splendid.</p>
<p>He appears to have spent the ensuing five or six months upon a
sort of grand tour of England, in the course of which he passed
from Tory household to Tory household. Again this was no great
matter for comment, save that it was a little in the manner of the
adventurer. In his present comparatively restricted circumstances
it was not surprising that he should seek to take advantage of the
hospitality which all good Tories would be prepared to offer a man
who in the past had so stoutly served interests akin to their
own.</p>
<p>By the following May he was back in London, accompanied only by
the French valet, Lavernis, who had come out of France with
him.</p>
<p>He occupied again that lodging in Covent Garden, and he moved
freely in society, and always in Tory circles. If he should ever be
reproached with this he would not be at a loss for a reply, as
presently he was to show.</p>
<p>He was much at Gascoigne's, that famous coffee-house by Spring
Gardens, which was notoriously a resort of Tories, and here he
became acquainted with many who nowadays scarcely made a secret of
their Jacobite sympathies. For by now, as Colonel Walton observed,
the bolder adherents of King James were at last beginning to
recover from the palsy into which they had been cast by the events
immediately following the discovery of the Assassination Plot.
Unrepressed by a King who dictated lenity as a policy to his
government, they began to rear their heads once more and grew
insolently careless of where and when they drank to the King Over
the Water.</p>
<p>It was at Gascoigne's that Colonel Walton was first presented by
Lord Claybourne, whose house he frequented, to James Macdonald,
Viscount Glenleven.</p>
<p>The Viscount's manner remained as coldly courteous as was normal
with him.</p>
<p>"I have heard of you, sir, from my kinsman, Ian Macdonald of
Ivernaion." Instinctively he lowered his voice in uttering the
name. Invernaion's fame was of a kind to make a man lower his voice
in claiming him for a kinsman.</p>
<p>The Colonel's slow-moving and rather melancholy grey eyes seemed
to quicken and harden as they searched the countenance of this
slight, elegant gentleman.</p>
<p>"Then you are not likely to have heard anything to my
advantage," said he.</p>
<p>Glenleven returned the glance with an eye that was certainly not
friendly "Not of late," he admitted. "But it was not always so.
Once, sir, you had no more fervent friend than my cousin Ian. But I
am presumptuous. No doubt, Colonel Walton, you are a competent
judge of your own actions and of the compensations you will have
found for forfeiting so many friendships."</p>
<p>"I endeavour, my lord, to reconcile it with my conscience." The
tone was so light, that Glenleven wondered was he mocked.</p>
<p>"You endeavour? That, I think, implies an effort."</p>
<p>"Ha, Colonel," murmured Claybourne, "Glenleven has touched you
there."</p>
<p>A large, handsome man this Claybourne, who for all his size was
gentle as a woman in his ways. Soft-eyed, soft-voiced, and of a
sweet and winning courtesy of manner, he contrasted oddly with the
hard brightness of the slight Glenleven.</p>
<p>The Colonel smiled and shrugged without answering, but the smile
and the shrug were in themselves eloquent. It was as if he had
said: "Perhaps he has. What then?"</p>
<p>Claybourne was encouraged to go further. He turned to Glenleven,
bending from his great height.</p>
<p>"Colonel Walton, I think, is a subject for your kinswoman. She
will show him the way to make peace with his conscience."</p>
<p>Glenleven's cold eyes were upon the Colonel. "But is that, I
wonder, what Colonel Walton wishes? I do not forget that he came to
England to offer his sword to King William's government."</p>
<p>"You are well informed, sir," said the Colonel, with an unusual
edge to his tone.</p>
<p>Glenleven's brows were raised in surprise. "On a matter of
public knowledge? Oh, sir!"</p>
<p>"It is not so public that I should have heard of it," grumbled
Claybourne, whose glance had darkened wistfully "Still, sir,
however you may have erred, Lady Lochmore might save your soul for
you."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a>Chapter 12. Colonel Walton
Unpacks</h2>
<p>Whatever views may have been held by others on the subject of
the saving of Colonel Walton's soul, his own view was that he would
attend to its salvation in his own fashion.</p>
<p>The immediate step contemplated towards this desirable end was,
to the deep thankfulness of his homesick valet Lavernis, once more
to cross the Channel, since here in England he discovered now
nothing to detain him.</p>
<p>This course undoubtedly he would have followed&mdash;in which
case I should have had no tale to tell&mdash;but for the
intervention of Fate in the massive shape of my Lord
Claybourne.</p>
<p>That Lancashire Catholic peer was, like most noblemen of his
creed, deeply sincere in his loyalty to the exiled Catholic
monarch. His most fervent, if at present secret, hopes were founded
upon the restoration of King James. It follows that he could not
look on indifferently whilst a man of parts so valuable to the
cause as those of Colonel Walton remained in the position of
neutrality or uncertainty in which he now supposed him to
stand.</p>
<p>The intention to bring back this stray lamb to the fold was in
his lordship's mind when he contrived that Colonel Walton should be
bidden to a rout given by Lady Claybourne.</p>
<p>The Colonel, with all arrangements secretly made for leaving
England, suffered himself to be persuaded. He attended the rout on
the very eve of his intended departure, and it was here that he
made, at last, the acquaintance of Ailsa Lochmore.</p>
<p>Claybourne, himself, presented him, and in doing so began to
speak of his qualities. But the young Countess checked him.</p>
<p>"Colonel Walton's name is all the passport he needs here."</p>
<p>The soldier bowed low over the long white hand she proffered. "I
was never prouder, ma'am, to bear it than at this moment."</p>
<p>She made a place for him beside her on the settle, and he sank
to it gratefully. He told Claybourne later that night that he
accounted her more beautiful than any woman that he had ever seen.
From her stiff gown of cloth of gold, surmounted by a froth of
Valenciennes, arose those shoulders, neck and finely chiselled face
that were of the tint of ivory, intensified by the lustrous black
of her luxuriant hair. Black too, in the candlelight seemed to him,
those liquid dark-blue eyes of hers under the slender black
eyebrows.</p>
<p>Ebony and ivory and gold, he pronounced her in his inmost
thoughts. She was to him, in her golden gown, like a lovely image
wrought by some amazing craftsman, and infinitely more fit for
worship.</p>
<p>"What do you in London, Colonel Walton?"</p>
<p>"Until now, madam, I have trifled," said he.</p>
<p>"And now?"</p>
<p>"And now I have seen you."</p>
<p>Gently she moved her fan. Between her eyes a frown appeared. But
her lips smiled. "I am a gorgon, then, that the sight of me should
change a man?"</p>
<p>He shook his head. "You do not change him into stone."</p>
<p>"Faith, sir, you are almost as placid."</p>
<p>"The placidity of deep waters, ma'am."</p>
<p>"Pray do not drown me in them, or in the subtlety of your
flattery. Shall we be serious, sir? Do you think the time is one in
which Colonel Walton should be trifling?"</p>
<p>"I have said, madam, that that is ended."</p>
<p>Her dark eyes were intently studying him over the edge of her
fan, which screened now the lower half of her face. "But you leave
me in doubt of your true meaning."</p>
<p>"I dare do no more whilst standing thus upon the threshold of
acquaintance."</p>
<p>"You may enter, and improve it. At my house you will meet old
friends."</p>
<p>"By your ladyship's gracious leave, I shall come in the hope of
making a new one."</p>
<p>Again she frowned a little whilst she continued to search his
baffling countenance. "You will regard me as that?"</p>
<p>"I have some small claim to do so. Your brother honoured me with
his friendship."</p>
<p>"I know. I know."</p>
<p>"And your husband died in my arms."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes. I remember that, too." She looked him squarely in the
face, with a frank directness. "It is as if Fate had somehow
already linked us."</p>
<p>"It is not often that Fate has dealt so kindly by me."</p>
<p>Yet again the frown appeared between the eyes, and this time
there was no smile upon the lips to mitigate it. "You said that you
had done with trifling."</p>
<p>"Must I repeat it before you will believe me?"</p>
<p>"I should prefer that you give proof of it. In spite of the
claims you have discerned to my acquaintance, you have been at no
pains to establish them. Yet you have been some time in
England."</p>
<p>"Something over a year," he said, confining his reply to
that.</p>
<p>"You came from France. From Saint Germain."</p>
<p>He inclined his head in silent assent.</p>
<p>"And you were with His Majesty? He does not lose heart I
hope."</p>
<p>He took time to answer her. When at last he did so, he lowered
his voice. "I speak, of course, from the standpoint of a year ago
when I say that his hopes are higher than their justification here
in England."</p>
<p>He saw the dark liquid eyes dilate as if with pain. He had
startled her.</p>
<p>"How can you say that?" There was sharp repudiation in her
tone.</p>
<p>"I speak as I have found."</p>
<p>"You have not known where to look."</p>
<p>He smiled gently in silence, and then felt her hand cool upon
his wrist, and quivered at the touch of her. "Let me help you."</p>
<p>"I could conceive," said he very solemnly, "no greater
happiness."</p>
<p>"You choose to be oracularly ambiguous. But I will not suppose
your meaning to be personal to myself."</p>
<p>Because her tone held a reproof he made haste to satisfy her
doubt.</p>
<p>"That were an audacity of which I could not yet be guilty."</p>
<p>"Not yet?" She raised her brows again. Then she laughed, and her
countenance cleared. "You relieve me at least in part. Seek me
soon, Colonel Walton, and I will prove to you that things in
England are not as somnolent as the surface may have led you to
fear."</p>
<p>"Did I say 'fear,' madam?"</p>
<p>"If you did not say it, I must hope that it was in your
mind."</p>
<p>Much later he was to tell Invernaion how her deep, almost tragic
earnestness had filled him with a vague alarm, which remained
unaccountable until later reflection made him realize its nature.
It was impossible to mistake her meaning or the object of the
invitation she extended.</p>
<p>Whilst Invernaion welcomed his sister's secret and very useful
co-operation, yet, as we know, he had ever been at pains to keep
her out of all enterprises by which she might come to be
compromised. So far had he carried this that not in his most
intimate moments had he given Colonel Walton a hint which might
have prepared him for the state of things her words disclosed. Not
only did she more than imply the existence of Jacobite activity,
but she made it plain that she was deep in whatever plot was being
hatched. The little that she had said sufficed to clear up the
obscurity of Lord Claybourne's assertion that Lady Lochmore might
save the Colonel's soul for him.</p>
<p>Now Dudley Walton was instinctively fearful of plots in which
women were included. Yet here his alarm was of quite another kind.
It was personal. Its roots were in concern for this lady, so young,
so lovely, and so desirable in body and in mind, this lady whom
yesterday he had not known, but who, nevertheless, was the sister
of his friend.</p>
<p>Was it possible that Invernaion could be aware of the activities
in which her ladyship was engaged, activities which, despite the
government's lenity, had never in Colonel Walton's view been more
dangerous than they now were? He had been prepared, of course, to
find her sympathies frankly Jacobite. No man was more fully aware
than he of the justification which the Macdonalds believed they
possessed for this. But he was far from prepared to find her, as
her words all but avowed, concerned in some business whose aim was
the subversion of the existing government. So appalled was he that
he was actually considering the framing of some warning, of some
remonstrance, when he grew conscious that they were being
observed.</p>
<p>Across the room he met the watching eyes of Major O'Grady, an
associate of Claybourne's and Glenleven's, whose acquaintance the
Colonel had made at Gascoigne's, and of whom all that he knew was
that the man had fought for King James and had been severely
wounded in the second siege of Limerick, and that he was now living
quietly in London, ignored by a government which did not believe in
making martyrs.</p>
<p>The observer, upon perceiving that he was, himself, observed,
advanced at once, a tall, spare man with a nut-cracker face, an
ugly, curving mouth, and dark, close-set eyes.</p>
<p>"Gracious lady, your fervent worshipper." He bowed over the hand
which with friendly readiness she extended. "Colonel Walton, your
humble obedient."</p>
<p>The Colonel was frigid. Major O'Grady's intrusion could not have
been more untimely. Yet, having joined them, the Irishman lingered,
insensible to the Colonel's frigidity, which so plainly invited him
to depart again.</p>
<p>With what patience he could command the Colonel waited for the
opportunity to probe this matter further, as he was urged to do
both out of his affection for Invernaion and out of the interest
which Invernaion's sister, herself, aroused in him. He was reduced
to despair when presently Lady Claybourne came irresistibly to bear
him off.</p>
<p>Those who subsequently met him that evening accounted him
taciturn and dull.</p>
<p>He was still lost in the thoughts accountable for this when he
reached home at midnight. There he was greeted by the soft-footed,
quiet-mannered Lavernis with the assurance that all their packages
were made, and that in the morning they could go aboard the cutter
that waited at Blackwall.</p>
<p>"You can unpack again, Lavernis."</p>
<p>"Comment?" Lavernis was horrified. "We do not, then,
depart?"</p>
<p>"Not yet, tomorrow," said the Colonel.</p>
<p>The valet sighed dolefully. His first thought was for himself.
"Now that is a thing that is sad." His second thought was for his
master. Instinctively he lowered his voice. "Is Monsieur le Colonel
prudent to remain?"</p>
<p>"Damned imprudent, Lavernis. Nevertheless, departure is for the
moment postponed. The cutter can wait. We are not at war, now, and
Dubois' papers are in order. I'll resolve in a day or two."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a>Chapter 13. The Tempter</h2>
<p>Colonel Walton kept his lodging until the evening of the morrow.
The dejected Lavernis, furtively observing him, was concerned to
the point of alarm by his master's gloomy pensiveness.</p>
<p>When at last the Colonel went forth at dusk, it was to take his
way to Gascoigne's. It is to be suspected that he was deliberately
putting himself in the way of those whom he judged to be Lady
Lochmore's associates in treason. At Gascoigne's he found Glenleven
in the company of Major O'Grady, who of late had become as close
and constant as a shadow in his attendance upon the Viscount. He
found there also another acquaintance in that notorious gamester,
Sir Anthony Cliffe, who, lacking at the moment an opponent, hailed
him effusively.</p>
<p>Consistent with the reputation he had earned, he yielded to the
newly conceived passion for play, which, as all the world knew by
now, was supposed to have lost him his Wiltshire estate. He sat
down to hazard with Sir Anthony, and rose at four o'clock in the
morning the poorer by some two hundred guineas.</p>
<p>Sir Anthony would still have continued the game on the pretext
of affording the Colonel an opportunity of retrieving his losses.
But the Colonel, stifling a yawn behind his fine hand, objected
coolly that the loss of necessary sleep would hardly compensate him
for the recovery of his guineas.</p>
<p>O'Grady, who with Glenleven had lingered, and who had now for
some time been watching the game, drew his lordship aside, and held
him closely in muttered talk whilst the Colonel was settling
accounts with Sir Anthony. This was something that the Colonel was
later to remember, as also that whenever he had turned his eyes in
their direction, he had found their glances furtively upon him, as
if he were supplying the subject of their talk.</p>
<p>On the threshold, in the pearly dawn, the soldier found
Glenleven at his elbow.</p>
<p>"Will you walk, Colonel? Our ways lie together for some
distance."</p>
<p>Something indefinable in that musical voice made the Colonel
suspect the purpose behind his lordship's proposal. For this
reason, rather than because the invitation was not one that without
offence he could have refused, he readily assented.</p>
<p>They set out, and walked some little way towards Charing Cross
in a silence that was odd. Colonel Walton did not choose to break
it. Deliberately he waited for his companion to fulfil the purpose
which he supposed him to have in mind. If Glenleven also preserved
silence it was, the Colonel surmised, because he was finding a
difficulty in discovering a starting point for what he had to say.
At last, however, he let fall an observation.</p>
<p>"Do not take it amiss if I commend the spirit in which you bear
your losses, Colonel."</p>
<p>"It honours me that your lordship should commend anything of
mine." Colonel Walton spoke in that dry tone that often left men
wondering whether he laughed at them when he was most pleasant.</p>
<p>If his lordship was troubled by any such doubt he put it
aside.</p>
<p>"I rate a good loser highly, because the man who knows how to
lose without repining, will always prove the winner in the end, no
matter what the game."</p>
<p>"It is evident, then, that I have not yet reached the end," said
the Colonel in the same dry voice. It was no part of his intent to
further his lordship's purpose; a purpose towards which he rightly
sensed that these generalities were mere preambles.</p>
<p>"Yet you may be nearer to it than you suppose."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I may. They say in Italy that all ills are not sent to
harm us. My losses at play drive me back to find employment for my
sword, which, after all, is the fittest employment for a
gentleman."</p>
<p>Here was the opening for which Glenleven played. Into it he
flashed his retort. "Provided the sword is worthily employed." And
without pause he added the question: "You have employment for
it?"</p>
<p>The Colonel smiled. The question was ingenuous. "Your lordship
knows where it was last offered."</p>
<p>"Oh yes. But that was a year ago. That is in the past. My
concern is for your future."</p>
<p>"The concern flatters me. I can return to French service, since
in England no service offers, and King William's government looks
askance on me."</p>
<p>"And have you, sir, cause to look otherwise upon King
William?"</p>
<p>The Colonel shrugged. "When I became an English landowner,
expediency suggested that I should make my peace." And then, almost
by way of apology, as it seemed, he added: "After all, my lord, you
are to remember that I am a soldier first and last. A soldier of
fortune, you might call me. I should not take offence at the
appellation."</p>
<p>Glenleven made him no reply. The Colonel's words appeared to
have sunk his lordship into thought. In silence they paced on until
they had come by the cross of Queen Eleanor into the Strand, and
there met a patrol of the watch, whose lanterns gleamed as
ineffectually yellow as painted lights in the increasing
daylight.</p>
<p>The constable surveyed them, and gave them good morrow
respectfully, since their cloaks and laced hats announced a quality
to command respect.</p>
<p>Presently, when they had walked a little way farther, his
lordship fulfilled the Colonel's expectations by returning to the
attack.</p>
<p>"And so, the members of King William's government look askance
on you?"</p>
<p>"I do not blame them."</p>
<p>"And they have ignored your applications."</p>
<p>"I am neither surprised nor plaintive."</p>
<p>"Ah! Not even when this indifference to your undoubted talents
drives you to seek employment overseas?"</p>
<p>The Colonel shrugged again. "What profit lies in repining?"
Glenleven was almost impatient. "Sir, you would have me suppose
that you enjoy being ruined."</p>
<p>They had walked some little way before the Colonel answered him.
"What is your lordship's interest to thwart me in my
self-deception?"</p>
<p>"The interest, sir, to serve you, if you will be served."</p>
<p>"To serve me!" Colonel Walton's voice rose in surprise. He
checked in his stride. Glenleven halted with him, and they stood in
the middle of the street, facing each other. "How, my lord, have I
deserved your favour?"</p>
<p>"By your antecedents. You were once in the service of King
James, and like so many others you followed him to France. Whilst
you awaited his call, you entered French service because France was
sheltering him. That makes you a Jacobite. You'll not trouble to
deny it."</p>
<p>"Your lordship goes too fast and perhaps too far. Nor is my
history quite as you suppose it. It is true that I was at the
Boyne. But, when all is said, I am neither a Scot nor a Papist. As
I have told you, sir, and as I told my Lord of Portland, I am a
soldier of fortune, and I serve the hand that pays."</p>
<p>"Why, then, since you put it no higher, it might be mine to show
you where the best pay awaits you."</p>
<p>They were moving on again by now. "I suspect, my lord, that you
are proposing to talk treason."</p>
<p>"On a privileged occasion, and to a man of honour. Besides, what
is treason? Is it treason to invite you to serve your lawful King
against a foreign usurper? Those who serve a King in his need are
those who prosper when the King comes into his own again. Thus,
Colonel Walton, duty and profit go hand in hand for you."</p>
<p>"A comfortable condition. It is such that might suit me, I
confess. What is involved, my lord?"</p>
<p>The direct question left his lordship thoughtful for some
moments. "Come with me one day soon to my Lady Lochmore's, and you
shall learn."</p>
<p>"I should prefer," said the Colonel, "to know before I go. What
is the plot you hatch there, my lord?"</p>
<p>"Plot?" His lordship was startled. "Did I speak of a plot?"</p>
<p>"You did not use the word. But I am not a child; and even a
child could assume nothing else." And again, almost sternly, almost
as if with authority, the soldier asked: "What is the nature of
this plot? Its aim?"</p>
<p>It was Glenleven's turn to halt and face his companion. Save for
themselves the street was utterly empty, although it was now broad
daylight.</p>
<p>"Are you with us?" his lordship demanded. "Are you, or are you
not?"</p>
<p>"That is an odd question to set a man before informing him of
what's to do."</p>
<p>The Viscount's narrow young face became a mask. But his blue
eyes were hard and stern. "You have reminded me, sir, that you are
not a child. You know more than enough upon which to make your
decision. The rest you shall learn when the decision is made."</p>
<p>The Colonel fingered his lip, considering. "If you will come..."
he was slowly beginning, and there broke off, like a man who
changes his mind. Abruptly, "Let me sleep on it, my lord," he
said.</p>
<p>"With all my heart. I could not wish you to enter upon such a
matter until after full consideration. If you decide that you are
with us, seek me again at Gascoigne's." And abruptly his lordship
loosened his cloak and held out his hand in leave-taking.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>Chapter 14. Employment</h2>
<p>Apparently sleep brought the Colonel no counsel. For at noon on
the morrow when he sat up in bed over the chocolate which his
servant brought him, he had only misgivings to express.</p>
<p>"To pack, or not to pack, Lavernis. That is the question. If I
distress you longer by continuing in this cold afflicted land of
fogs which it seems you can never learn to love, I am likely myself
to be distressed. My Lord Argus of Portland's many eyes will be
suspiciously upon me now that I am seen to have no honest reason
for remaining; now that according to the appearances, necessity,
that most peremptory of mistresses, should be driving me away.</p>
<p>"What view do you take of all this, Lavernis?"</p>
<p>The sleek young valet inclined himself a little.</p>
<p>"Dubois waits at Blackwall with the cutter, my colonel."</p>
<p>"That is an answer. Yes. But you are an egotist, Lavernis. You
reply out of your own desires, instead of out of my necessities.
Dubois shall continue to wait, even as I must, until I can resolve
myself. And my Lord of Portland's many eyes must be dusted. The
stage is set. The corroborative evidence is already provided.
Behold me a ruined man, Lavernis. Bring me my bed-gown, pen, ink
and paper."</p>
<p>So the Colonel wrote once more to King William's friend and
minister, to solicit employment, and he couched his letter in most
urgent terms.</p>
<p>He confessed that the modest fortune inherited a year ago had
been entirely dissipated; that between himself and want stood
little more than the means to pay his journey back to France, where
his long sojourn in England might bring him now under suspicion and
exclude him from a return to the service which he had quitted.</p>
<p>Thus his lingering in England would, he conceived, be
satisfactorily explained to Portland. His lordship must assume him
so foolish as to continue in hopes of being employed by the
government of King William, and detained by nothing more than this
hope.</p>
<p>The result of his letter, however, exceeded by far all that
Colonel Walton was expecting.</p>
<p>Having kept his lodgings for two days, dreaming troubled dreams
about the lady of ivory and ebony and gold, but without apparently
coming to any definite resolve, he was startled on the morning of
Monday by a curt note commanding him to wait again upon my Lord
Portland.</p>
<p>Within a couple of hours of the receipt of that command, you see
Colonel Walton once more closeted with his lordship in that
handsome room in the Palace at Kensington. Again, as a year ago,
the Dutchman sat at the ormolu-encrusted writing-table, with his
back to the light from the tall windows. Again the Colonel stood
straight and tall and very elegant, in blue velvet this time, with
that same light full upon his vigorously handsome, uncannily calm
features.</p>
<p>So much as he could discern of Portland's countenance was
forbidding. His lordship's eyes considered him at length before
breaking the silence. Then, when at last his harsh, guttural voice
was heard in the fluent and rather precise English that he
employed, his opening expressions were far from promising.</p>
<p>"In the time that you have spent in England," said his lordship,
"you have added to what was formerly known of you nothing that
might commend you to His Majesty."</p>
<p>"One thing, I think," said the imperturbable Colonel.
"Necessity."</p>
<p>"There is a proverb to the effect that it knows no laws."</p>
<p>"Save those which are imposed upon it. The proverb-maker should
have added that."</p>
<p>"I do not think I understand."</p>
<p>"Then I'll add another proverb that will perhaps explain.
'Beggars may not be choosers'."</p>
<p>"I do not perceive the elucidation. I am dull, perhaps."</p>
<p>"I mean, my lord, that the necessity which drives me so
pertinaciously to seek the King's service will compel me to study
zealously to retain it. In some sort that is a guarantee of good
faith."</p>
<p>"If so, it is the only one you have yet supplied."</p>
<p>"At least, I trust, I have not had the misfortune to supply any
to the contrary."</p>
<p>"Have you not, sir? Have you not? Ah, parbleu! Do you conceive
His Majesty's government to be blind? Do you imagine, sir, that we
know nothing of your activities in this past year?"</p>
<p>"Activities!" The Colonel smiled. "It is the last word I should
apply to the idle drifting in which I have consumed a modest
fortune."</p>
<p>"So! So! Yes. But whither have you drifted? From one Jacobite
household to another. A man herds by instinct with his kind. Is it
not?"</p>
<p>"If your lordship will substitute Tory for Jacobite, I'll accept
the impeachment. But as for Jacobites&mdash;faith!&mdash;I found
none in my wanderings."</p>
<p>"Were you looking for them?" flashed Portland, like a swordsman
whirling his point into a sudden opening. And as he spoke, he
leaned forward sharply to observe the effect of his thrust.</p>
<p>It was parried by a melancholy smile. "If I had been, I must now
have every reason to conclude that the cause of King James lies
under a blight in the country."</p>
<p>Portland sank back again in his tall chair. His eyes were veiled
by lowered lids. "Is that the conclusion that brings you back here
to seek employment at the hands of King William?"</p>
<p>"I protest your lordship is not very generous."</p>
<p>"You lay claim to my generosity? That is amusing."</p>
<p>"Since your lordship's assumption appears to agree with my own
that there are no Jacobites left in England, it must follow that I
cannot have consorted with any."</p>
<p>"Parbleu! You reason like an attorney. But you'll not dispel
facts by a cheap illusion of logic. I say to you plainly that you
have not been discreet in your associations; that your conduct
inspires no confidence."</p>
<p>Now it would have been plain to wits much duller than those of
Colonel Walton that the Earl of Portland had not commanded him to
Kensington just to tell him this. It followed that there must be
some purpose behind it, and one which the minister was approaching
tortuously. The Colonel became vaguely uneasy. But he kept to the
matter.</p>
<p>"Do you blame me, my lord, for accepting the only hospitality
that was offered to me? Your lordship knows how vainly I should
have sought admission to the households of the Whigs."</p>
<p>Bentinck's glance became charged with scorn. It sounded, too, in
his voice. "You commend yourself vastly, by my faith! You confess
yourself a broken gamester. You confess to sponging upon men's
hospitality. You are not concerned to avoid contempt, Monsieur
l'escroc."</p>
<p>Beyond a darkening of colour in the Colonel's face, its calm
remained.</p>
<p>"It is not every man who is in your lordship's fortunate
position of being able to manifest it with impunity. I console
myself with that reflection."</p>
<p>"Ah, bah! Let us keep to the business."</p>
<p>"It would be more amiable, my lord."</p>
<p>"Leave we the country. Come we now to town. I find you
consorting here with such men as my Lord Glenleven, my Lord
Claybourne, Harry Dalkeith, and many more of the kind. Will you
pretend to ignorance that these men are avowed Jacobites? Will you
describe them as merely Tories? You have dined more than once at
Dalkeith's with men of his own traitorous kidney. You were at a
rout at my Lady Claybourne's, some few nights ago, where every man
and most of the women are of those who daily toast the King Over
the Water."</p>
<p>The Colonel answered in a tone of mild surprise, "If your
lordship is so well informed of their treason, why do you suffer
them at large?"</p>
<p>His lordship bridled. He smote the table irritably with his open
hand.</p>
<p>"Sirrah, you are not here to set me questions; but to answer
mine. I am waiting."</p>
<p>"I heard no question. But I will infer it. My answer is the same
as before. Until His Majesty's government accredits me with
employment I can find no friend save those of Tory sympathies."</p>
<p>"Tory sympathies! I thought we should have that euphemism. And
therefore you sit in long and intimate talk with that Jacobite
firebrand, Lady Lochmore."</p>
<p>To the Colonel this was a blow between the eyes. He quivered
where he stood. He was conscious of cold along his spine, and for a
fraction of time was almost shaken out of his imperturbable
demeanour. But he made an instantaneous recovery. He inclined his
head a little. A deprecatory little smile took shape upon his
lips.</p>
<p>"Her ladyship is a very beautiful woman."</p>
<p>Portland sneered at him audibly "You answer everything, do you
not? Well, well! I have yet another question for you. Let me hear
you answer that. What proposals has my Lord Glenleven made to you?
You are not so ready, eh? You stare?"</p>
<p>The Colonel stared, indeed. But only for a moment. At the end of
it, his melancholy, wistful smile appeared. "It took me by surprise
a little that your lordship should resort to the hoary trick of
pretending knowledge so as to entrap admissions."</p>
<p>"Pretending! I pretend? I?" Portland betrayed heat. A flush
glowed through the sallow surface of his lean, bony face. "If I
were to tell you..." he began, and abruptly checked, like a man who
suddenly perceives that he is about to say too much.</p>
<p>The Colonel's impassivity never allowed his lordship to suspect
that he had said too much already.</p>
<p>He resumed more smoothly: "Will you deny that you were bidden by
Glenleven to Lady Lochmore's?"</p>
<p>"But why should I deny it?"</p>
<p>"So. Did you accept the invitation?"</p>
<p>"No, my lord."</p>
<p>"No? Did you refuse it?"</p>
<p>"I was vague, my lord. Her ladyship, as I have had the honour to
mention, is a very beautiful woman. I do not easily resist the
invitations of a beautiful woman. I was tempted."</p>
<p>The sallow countenance before him became utterly inscrutable. A
silence followed and for some moments the only sound in that
spacious, lofty room was the ticking of the Dutch clock upon the
overmantel.</p>
<p>Then, at last, the Earl of Portland spoke. In an odd voice,
pregnant with significance, he said slowly: "You may yield to that
temptation, Colonel Walton, in the service of His Majesty."</p>
<p>The words being spoken, the silence was resumed and continued
for a spell. The Colonel was frowning. "I hardly apprehend," he
said at last.</p>
<p>Watching him keenly, an acid smile on his lips, Portland
explained himself.</p>
<p>"Necessity makes you importunate for employment. You have
reminded me that beggars cannot be choosers. So that you have
employment, then, you will be indifferent to its nature?"</p>
<p>"Provided that it is honourable employment."</p>
<p>"In the King's service, sir, there is no other."</p>
<p>"Ah! And yet I seem to have heard of the common hangman."</p>
<p>Lord Portland clucked irritably "I have said that you answer
everything. You talk too much. You are pert and tiresome. Let us
come straight to the matter, and have done. No need for many
words.</p>
<p>"At Lady Lochmore's, when you go there, you will find yourself
in a nest of treason in which another assassination plot is being
hatched. I can supply you with the names of all the plotters you
will meet there, and of one whom you will not meet.</p>
<p>"This one is Ian Macdonald of Invernaion, Lady Lochmore's
brother. He keeps prudently abroad; and even there, of late, he has
a trick of disappearing; he is as elusive as he is dangerous; and
in this plot he is at once the brain to conceive and the arm to
execute.</p>
<p>"It will be best that I am entirely frank with you, so that you
will understand.</p>
<p>"If I do not put my foot at once upon this wasp's nest, it is
because to do so would be to warn this knave Macdonald. And so," he
added very slowly, "the only one of them who really matters to me
would escape, to begin again as soon as opportunity serves. And I
do not mean him to escape. I do not intend that my rest shall be
forever disturbed and my mind constantly preoccupied by this
rogue's desperate activities. J'en ai assez! I mean to make an end
of him. The other plotting fools...Pish! They are nothing.
Invernaion, that is a man to fear, I confess it; a man who already
has given us incalculable trouble and done incalculable harm; a
bold, resolute, enterprising villain. But there! Let me but have
word, definite word, of this Invernaion's whereabouts, and,
wherever he may be, my agents shall find him for me."</p>
<p>He paused there, and his eyes which whilst he had been speaking
had never for a moment left the Colonel's face, seemed to grow yet
more fixed in their regard. "Sooner or later this so precious
information must be obtainable at Lady Lochmore's."</p>
<p>So! The murder was out at last, and the reason why he had been
summoned to the Palace was at last clear to the Colonel. Under his
icy front a volcano of indignation was raging. For the sake of his
self-respect he must affect, he felt, not yet to understand that
anyone should dare to insult him by such a proposal.</p>
<p>"If all is as your lordship is informed, that would seem to
follow. But how does it concern me?"</p>
<p>"Are you dull? Or do you pretend to be? At the hands of her
ladyship a welcome awaits you. Are you not a distinguished soldier,
esteemed of Monsieur de Villeroy, and of proven loyalty in the past
to King James? And are you not, therefore, of value in the councils
of these traitors, and no doubt in the actions that are to follow
out of them?</p>
<p>"You will accept the invitation you have received. You will
procure me this information. You will also discover for me in what
circumstances, on what occasion, the blow they intend is to be
struck.</p>
<p>"I will have you take no risk of failure. Therefore, you will
not attempt to communicate with me, until you can bring me the
complete information I require."</p>
<p>The Colonel stood like a statue. Lord Portland's dark eyes
searching that lofty countenance on which the light beat fully,
found it of a masklike impassivity. The voice, when presently it
came, was toneless.</p>
<p>"This is the service your lordship offers to a gentleman?"</p>
<p>"It is the service I offer to a man whose antecedents make it
necessary that he should be tested. That I offer it at all, is
already a proof of goodwill. If you succeed in this task, and thus
prove yourself, be sure that employment better suited to your
acknowledged talents will await you. And in the meantime it is work
that will be well recompensed. His Majesty's government has raised
to five thousand pounds the reward it is now offering for
information that will lead to the arrest of Ian Macdonald."</p>
<p>"My lord, this is unworthy."</p>
<p>"Unworthy?" The dark brows arched themselves. "Peste! Unworthy a
broken gamester who confesses himself an escroc? Tiens!"</p>
<p>"Oh, a broken gamester, if you please; and an escroc as well, to
put it brutally. But a spy... A spy upon those who are to take me
trustingly into their confidence! A Judas to entrap and betray to
you a man, so that you may deliver him to the hangman! That is too
much, my lord, even for a broken gamester and an escroc."</p>
<p>Portland drummed with his fingers impatiently upon the polished
surface of his table.</p>
<p>"You boggle at a word. What need to call yourself by an ugly
name? You will be an agent of the government, working to avoid a
national calamity and to thwart an assassin. Is that
dishonourable?"</p>
<p>"Descriptions do not change the nature of things."</p>
<p>Bentinck shrugged. "Bien! A pity you so regard it. You decline,
then?"</p>
<p>Had the question come three heartbeats earlier, the answer would
have been prompt. But in that fraction of time, even whilst his
lordship had been speaking, the Colonel had caught a fleeting
glimpse of something that showed itself elusive and fugitive on the
horizon of his mind. Because of this he now stood silent, his
square chin buried in his fine cravat, a man considering; and
considering infinitely more than the astute Dutchman who observed
him even began to suspect. His mind was galloping through an
analysis of the knowledge of which Lord Portland had shown himself
possessed.</p>
<p>To obtain this knowledge, Colonel Walton's travels through
England need not have been followed step by step by government
spies. From odd scraps of information upon the course of those
travels the rest might easily have been inferred.</p>
<p>Knowledge of his presence at Lady Claybourne's rout was readily
explained. No doubt Portland had been supplied with a list of the
guests at that assembly in the house of so suspect a person. The
Colonel's close talk with Lady Lochmore would not have wanted for
observers. Even as the thought occurred to him, he had a fleeting
mental vision of the dark nut-cracker face of Major O'Grady so
intently watching them. What O'Grady had seen would have been seen
by others.</p>
<p>Nothing mysterious so far.</p>
<p>Even Lord Portland's acquaintance with the business that brought
that bunch of plotters together at Lady Lochmore's was not beyond
explanation. These Jacobites living under a government which was
tolerant from policy, because it did not believe in making martyrs,
were emboldened to push indiscretion to the point of recklessness.
Lady Claybourne's rout had been an instance of this. Government
agents quietly listening&mdash;men perhaps as much above suspicion
as himself, and similarly enlisted&mdash;would pick up scraps here
and there, which when assembled might make up a fairly complete
tale.</p>
<p>But Portland's knowledge of Glenleven's unwitnessed talk with
Colonel Walton on that early morning walk from Gascoigne's was in
another class altogether. It must remain fraught with mystery
unless to be explained by the assumption that Portland, informed
that they had left Gascoigne's together in the hours of daybreak,
had drawn a bow at a venture on the subject of the uses Glenleven
might have made of such an opportunity.</p>
<p>There was, however, no assumption discernible to him that would
explain the deeper mystery of Lord Portland's motives for
entrusting this particular piece of espionage to Colonel
Walton.</p>
<p>His lordship pretended that it was to be a test of loyalty.
That, however, was to reverse the logical order of things. The task
was one that could be entrusted only to a man whose loyalty was
already firmly established. The Colonel's antecedents, as Portland
rightly said, inspired no confidence. What assurance could Portland
possess that Colonel Walton would not employ the knowledge gained
so as to warn the plotters and disperse them? Was that the aim? To
employ him as a sort of scarecrow? It might be. But the explanation
did not satisfy him, because he knew, of his own knowledge, that
Portland by no means overstated the case when he represented the
suppression of Invernaion as urgently necessary to his peace of
mind.</p>
<p>Was this shrewd Dutchman really acting upon the conviction that
a man who did not deny that he was a broken gamester and an escroc,
would, upon being faced with dire necessity, desperately stifle the
last scruple? That to a man in his case the temptation to earn five
thousand pounds with an assurance of honourable employment to
follow must prove irresistible? Did Portland really regard Colonel
Walton as a drowning man who would clutch at any straw, no matter
how dirty?</p>
<p>It was possible. Consequently, considering how singularly
adapted was the Colonel's history to win him the confidence of Lady
Lochmore's circle, Lord Portland might well regard him as a tool so
opportune to his needs as to be employed even at some risk.</p>
<p>After all, where else should Portland find a man in Colonel
Walton's circumstances, for whom a welcome was assured in that
assembly of plotters?</p>
<p>Where else?</p>
<p>And then, promptly, in answer to this question, came a suspicion
that turned him cold. Was it possible that such an agent had been
found already, and could this be the explanation of Portland's
intimate acquaintance with the plot?</p>
<p>For an instant Colonel Walton thought that he had resolved the
problem, only to perceive in the next how absurd was the solution.
In such a case Lord Portland would certainly not now be requiring
Colonel Walton, or disposed to make the gambler's throw which
employing him entailed.</p>
<p>Thus far into that queer maze had his thoughts travelled when
his lordship's voice came harshly to recall him to the decision to
be made.</p>
<p>"Well, sir? Well? Do you decline, or do you accept?"</p>
<p>Colonel Walton emerged from his absorption. Expression dawned on
his blank countenance. Slowly, his features relaxed into a
deprecating smile. At last, he gave a little shrug with an air of
recklessness.</p>
<p>"As your lordship so wisely perceives, a man in my circumstances
cannot afford a high stomach. I will not pretend to eagerness. I
will not... Oh! But there! What use are words? I accept the task,
my lord, as an earnest of better things to follow."</p>
<p>His lordship continued to ponder him searchingly. At length, as
if satisfied, he spoke, and his tone was less harsh.</p>
<p>"Serve the King diligently in this, Colonel Walton, and be sure
that better things will follow. Your military talents shall be
given scope. Fail me, play me false in the least degree, and be
equally sure that you will have destroyed yourself. I have a long
arm, Colonel Walton, as I count upon you to enable me to
demonstrate to Macdonald of Invernaion. You will have perceived, I
think, from what I have told you, that His Majesty's government is
well equipped with eyes."</p>
<p>Colonel Walton had, indeed, perceived it. It was this
perception, the very thing that it might be supposed would have
deterred him, which had&mdash;although Lord Portland, for all his
shrewdness was far from suspecting it&mdash;been the force that had
urged him into this contemptible undertaking.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a>Chapter 15. The Plot</h2>
<p>To Lochmore House, Lady Lochmore's small mansion in the Strand,
came Colonel Walton to dine on a day of that week which had opened
with his interview with the Earl of Portland.</p>
<p>He was conducted by my Lord Glenleven, to whose proposals he had
hastened immediately to return the answer which the government
service rendered necessary.</p>
<p>He was very graciously welcomed by his lovely hostess, and
received with manifest warmth by the company. This was made up
entirely of men; the handsome, portly Lord Claybourne; young Sir
Hamish Stuart of Meorach, tall, plump, florid, and frog-eyed;
little Geoffrey Howard, pallid and effete; long, fair, willowy
Harry Dalkeith; and the saturnine Major O'Grady.</p>
<p>When the cloth had been raised, the comfits and sweet wines were
circulating, and the servants had withdrawn, her ladyship rapped
the table to impose silence, and then stood before them with the
solemnity of a priestess. She rose to give them the toast of the
King.</p>
<p>Which King she meant was made plain by the ritual that
accompanied her words. With a sweeping, dramatic gesture, she
brought her glass over a silver bowl of water on which some lilies
floated, and held it so whilst she pledged His Majesty.</p>
<p>The company, as solemnly responsive, came to its feet. Eight
wine-glasses met in a cluster above that same bowl; and in unison
came the cry: "The King!"</p>
<p>The Colonel, as the guest of honour on her ladyship's immediate
right, bore his part in this mummery, no trace of the scornful
humour with which he witnessed it, reflected on his face.</p>
<p>When it was over, and they had resumed their seats, Lord
Claybourne came abruptly to business, earnestly addressing their
latest recruit. His lordship understood that the Colonel held
certain definite views on affairs in France and on the attitude
towards England of King Louis, and he invited him to communicate
them freely to the company.</p>
<p>In expectant silence the company's eyes were turned upon the
Colonel. He did not strain the expectancy.</p>
<p>"You will remember," he said slowly, "that for the past year I
have been in England."</p>
<p>"Lotus-eating," her ladyship reproved him, tapping his knuckles
with her fan.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the reproof by a smile, but did not directly
answer it at the moment.</p>
<p>"When I left France there was certainly no lukewarmness on the
part of King Louis in the matter of lending his support to the
cause of King James."</p>
<p>"Ay!" interjected the croaking voice of O'Grady "The orange is
not a fruit they cultivate in France. But ye'll not be implying,
now, that King Louis may have changed since then?"</p>
<p>"Alas! No."</p>
<p>That set them staring at him.</p>
<p>"Do you say 'alas'?" cried her ladyship.</p>
<p>"You'll give me reason when you have heard me. King Louis'
sympathies are fixed. Any change, therefore, must have been from
sympathy to action. It is of this that I perceive no sign or
chance."</p>
<p>"No chance?" said Dalkeith, impatiently. And then Stuart of
Meorach took up the argument. He was glib of speech and forceful of
manner.</p>
<p>"How can you venture to assert so much? With what authority can
you speak to what may have happened in the year of your absence
from France?"</p>
<p>"With the authority, Sir Hamish, of what I find in England." The
Colonel turned his calm grey eyes upon her ladyship. "Oh, I have
not entirely been lotus-eating, although I have allowed it to be
supposed. In my travels through the country I have been observing;
observing closely."</p>
<p>"And you have found?" she asked him, her white face eager.</p>
<p>"A deadlock. Here is the situation, as I should by now have
reported it at Saint Germains if my departure had not been
postponed by the representations of my Lord Glenleven and his
invitation to join you. The country will rise if King Louis sends
an army."</p>
<p>"Ah!" ejaculated Claybourne.</p>
<p>And the others were all suddenly leaning forward, their eager
glances on the Colonel's face.</p>
<p>The Colonel continued.</p>
<p>"But King Louis will send an army only if the country rises.
Each waits upon the other. Neither will hazard the first move. From
this stalemate I perceive no issue."</p>
<p>Their eagerness perished in disappointment. But from this her
ladyship was quick to rally.</p>
<p>"We may be able to supply one," she said, and an emphatically
assenting murmur supported the assertion.</p>
<p>Colonel Walton looked round the table, an obvious question in
his glance. Sir Hamish answered it.</p>
<p>"If the deadlock is as bad as your pessimism supposes, it can
endure only while William of Orange lives. Once he's out of the
way, that deadlock is broken. There will not then even be the need
for troops from France."</p>
<p>"Very true," the Colonel agreed. "But, meanwhile, King William's
health whilst not of the best is far from affording grounds for
your hopes. Asthmatical men often contrive to live on."</p>
<p>They looked at one another with significance, yet with doubt and
question in their glances. Then her ladyship, with a gesture as of
brushing something aside, urged frankness. The Colonel, she
protested, was entirely to be trusted. Despite a certain
lukewarmness for a season, dictated by personal policy, he had just
made it clear that he had never wavered in his sympathy towards a
King whom he had so signally served. The fact that he was now
amongst them, the intention he had disclosed of returning to Saint
Germains to make his report and all his past record supplied the
completest guarantees of his loyalty.</p>
<p>That confident assurance made an end of reticences. The
existence of a plot well advanced in the hatching, and the full aim
of it, were now revealed to him, precisely as the well-informed
Lord Portland had revealed it to him already.</p>
<p>William of Orange was to be killed.</p>
<p>In addition he was informed by Stuart of Meorach&mdash;and it
was obviously news also to one or two others among those
present&mdash;that the occasion would be supplied when William
presently went over to the Hague to open the States, a matter which
he must perform before the end of the month.</p>
<p>Thus, at the very outset, Colonel Walton became possessed of one
of the facts which Portland desired to ascertain.</p>
<p>To this her ladyship added, speaking with obvious pride in her
brother, that Invernaion was ready. He but awaited the signal,
which would be given him by those now present at this board. Their
own chief function was to ascertain and communicate to him the
precise date of William's journey.</p>
<p>The Colonel listened with a countenance from which he did not
trouble to dissemble gravity. By the time their explanations came
to an end his expression was forbidding.</p>
<p>"But this," he said slowly, like a man appalled, "is murder.
Murder!"</p>
<p>For a moment his word and tone seemed to knock the breath out of
them all. Her ladyship, beside him, at the table's head, shrank
into her tall chair, as if away from him, staring at him the while
with startled eyes.</p>
<p>Then from one or two came half-angry interjections. O'Grady
laughed his harsh laugh in fierce derision, but said nothing. It
was Lord Claybourne at last, his handsome countenance preserving
its gentle air, who leaned across the board to reason in mildest
accents with the Colonel.</p>
<p>"If King James were to return at the head of an army and were to
prevail, would not the life of the Prince of Orange be forfeit for
his usurpation? In the battles that would follow the King's
landing, thousands of men might come to perish. Could that be
called murder? We&mdash;too small a group to deliver battle to an
army&mdash;must snatch our victory by aiming directly at the
battle's ultimate object."</p>
<p>Stuart of Meorach took up the argument with greater heat.</p>
<p>"Wherein lies the difference between the two operations? If
there is any, it is that we prevail by gentler means. We avert an
ocean of bloodshed. We sacrifice one life only so as to accomplish
that for which every loyal heart must pray. And we take the view
that what we do is an act of war. Upon what sane grounds are we to
be gainsaid? is it to be pretended that the difference between war
and murder lies in the number of the slain? Is murder to become
dignified by the name of war simply because there are a thousand
dead instead of one? Is that what you would say, Colonel
Walton?"</p>
<p>The Colonel's gesture, almost contemptuous, brushed aside the
arguments.</p>
<p>"These are the usual hoary sophistries of regicides. Words,
sirs, cannot change the nature of a deed."</p>
<p>Her ladyship leaned towards him again. "No. But they can bring
us to a proper vision of what that nature is. Murder, Colonel, is a
killing done for personal, selfish ends. This is a killing for the
general good, and to the end that right may triumph over wrong, and
triumph, as my Lord Claybourne has said, without the unnecessary
shedding of innocent blood. Can you deny the truth of that?"</p>
<p>"Ay! Can you?" demanded Dalkeith fiercely, at the Colonel's
other elbow.</p>
<p>"To be sure, he can't," O'Grady asserted from across the table.
"Nobody can. The lawfulness of assassination is not to be
questioned when it's after promoting the interest of Church or
State. Didn't the Holy Father, himself, head a thanksgiving
procession, and weren't the guns of Sant' Angelo fired in honour of
the massacre of St Bartholomew?"</p>
<p>"That is not an argument that will win you sympathy in England
for this deed."</p>
<p>"Sure it's the deed itself will win us all the sympathy we'll be
needing."</p>
<p>Colonel Walton leaned back in his chair, with half-closed eyes,
his face now impassive again. He was aware that he had aroused
hostility, mistrust, even dread. He saw these emotions reflected on
every face about him. He was aware of the steady hardness of the
eyes with which Glenleven from the table's foot was watching
him.</p>
<p>Upon that heat of repressed anger his voice fell cold and
quietly</p>
<p>"It is not worth while to pursue an argument that has become
concerned with terms. Do not let us be deceived by quibbles. Call
this thing by what name you will, the fact remains that we have
here an assassination plot; just such a plot as that which failed
two years ago, and for which some poor devils were hanged."</p>
<p>"Damme!" Sir Hamish fiercely interrupted him. "It is not at all
the same."</p>
<p>"In aim and in essentials it is, and because it is what it is, I
tell you that it is foredoomed. Oh, have patience, sirs. Plots to
assassinate kings have been as numerous almost as there have been
kings in history. Yet very few kings have ever been assassinated.
That is because, sooner or later, wittingly or unwittingly, there
has been someone to betray the plot; and this again because sooner
or later some one person's conscience has been aroused to revolt
against the projected deed. Prendergass, who betrayed the last
plot, was as stout a Jacobite as any of you. He loved King James
and hated the Prince of Orange as deeply as any of you..."</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a sudden, sharp challenge from
Glenleven.</p>
<p>"Are you not in this?"</p>
<p>"Oh, well&mdash;as any of us, then. Yet Prendergass was so
appalled by the thought of murder that so as to avert it he
betrayed his friends to his enemies."</p>
<p>"At least we've no Prendergass here," protested O'Grady, and
added: "Glory be!"</p>
<p>"Unless you be one, Colonel Walton," came sternly from
Glenleven. As the person who had introduced the Colonel, he would
naturally be labouring under a sense of his responsibility.</p>
<p>The expression brought from the others an almost instant
challenge to Colonel Walton to declare himself. Only Lady Lochmore
held aloof, watching him ever with her dark eyes, which now were
faintly wistful.</p>
<p>The Colonel's glance never faltered. He tossed back the lace
from his fine hand, and again raised it in an appeal for
patience.</p>
<p>"I am a professional soldier," he began. "Professional soldiers
by concerning themselves ever with the practical and excluding the
emotional, are vouchsafed a vision unclouded by such enthusiasms as
very naturally are yours. If I am to serve you at all, I beg that
you will hear me patiently. You know that I have spent some months
on my travels through this England. Had I made the same tour two
years ago, I should have found weapons collected, men assembled and
sometimes even secretly drilling; everywhere an air of preparation,
of expectancy, of readiness for a general rising the moment the
signal should be given. Then came the discovery of the
Assassination Plot; and of how effectively that blow quelled the
Jacobite ardour it has been mine in these months to realize. Here
in London, it is not to be denied that a certain Jacobite spirit is
astir, although I do not believe that it touches the masses. But
even if it did, it would be folly to be deceived by it. London is
not England. Let me tell you what I found everywhere in the shires.
The weapons are buried or hidden, the men disbanded, the expectancy
dead. Anything done now would take the country by surprise, find it
unprepared. Presently, let us hope, that which is in all loyal
hearts will begin to stir again: the desire to restore the rightful
king. But any premature action such as you contemplate may scatter
a fresh panic, and quench, perhaps for all time, the spirit that
may be only just beginning to revive."</p>
<p>"Say, rather," cried Dalkeith, "that it will prove a spark to
fire the train and explode the mine."</p>
<p>"But if it fail?"</p>
<p>"It cannot fail," Sir Hamish answered him impetuously "In the
last plot there were too many. In this there are only a chosen few.
Last time it was the extent of the preparations that defeated the
aim. This time we prepare nothing but the cardinal deed, and leave
the rest to happen in the way of nature, inevitably as it
must."</p>
<p>"And when the rotten orange has been squeezed," added O'Grady,
"events will follow of themselves to bring the King to his own
again."</p>
<p>Her ladyship leaned towards the Colonel. "Are you convinced? Are
we to count upon you?"</p>
<p>He looked at her, and smiled with his lips. His steady eyes
remained grave.</p>
<p>"You may count upon me, convinced or not."</p>
<p>But Glenleven was not satisfied. "There is no counting upon any
man who is without conviction."</p>
<p>O'Grady cut in as if to mitigate the hostility of his lordship's
tone. "Faith, now, Colonel, Glenleven's right in that, so he is.
Glory be, what more conviction will you be needing? This time the
sword'll fall truly and without any kind of warning."</p>
<p>"Even as their sword fell at Glencoe, yet not as treacherously,"
said her ladyship, and her mouth grew hard.</p>
<p>Colonel Walton was under no necessity to ask for an explanation.
Too well he knew from Invernaion the significance of that
allusion.</p>
<p>If he had startled them by his frankly avowed hostility to the
business that linked them, he had reassured them at least in part
by showing that the real basis of his hostility was the persuasion
that it could not forward the interests of King James. It remained
to render that reassurance complete, and to this he addressed
himself.</p>
<p>He began by asserting clearly that since the business upon which
they were engaged, rightly or wrongly, was the business of King
James, he would not refrain from joining hands with them if they
could show him in what his association was necessary to the
prosperity of their cause.</p>
<p>It was Claybourne, who in his quiet, gentle way seemed in some
sort the dominant spirit there, who answered him.</p>
<p>Once the blow fell, and the expected rising logically followed,
a man of strong character and wide military experience would be
necessary to combine, co-ordinate and generally order the forces
that would lie at their disposal. Such a man they accounted Colonel
Walton; and it was chiefly because of this that they had invited
him to join them. Claybourne went on to speak of the recompense
that would await the Colonel from the restored King, the high
office in the State to which he might reasonably aspire, and to
which he would not aspire in vain; such an office as that which
Marlborough had forfeited by his treachery.</p>
<p>Being launched upon this side of the question, his lordship had
that to say to the others which was of a similar nature. Perhaps it
was to counteract any doubt which the Colonel's criticisms might
have sown, that he now reminded each of those men of the great
reward awaiting him when the King should come to his own again.
Thus was it gradually revealed to Colonel Walton how self-interest
was with them the spur to a loyalty whose roots were firmly set in
personal ambition.</p>
<p>Veiling his contempt, he permitted them to assume that he shared
their enthusiasm, so as to allay the last doubt concerning his
attitude and to restore some confidence in him even to the
perturbed Glenleven.</p>
<p>The initiation of Colonel Walton having been thus satisfactorily
completed, and this being the only business for which they had
assembled on that occasion, they pledged the King Over the Water
once more by way of a closing ritual, and on that departed.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-16" id="ch-16"></a>Chapter 16. Vain
Remonstrances</h2>
<p>Those eight conspirators&mdash;in which number Colonel Walton is
now included&mdash;held meetings almost daily thereafter at
Lochmore House. This frequency they accounted necessary because
daily now it was expected that announcement would be made of the
definite date of King William's departure for Holland.</p>
<p>The meetings, however, were productive of nothing but talk, all
of it very high-sounding, but none of it in any way constructive.
For what was to follow after the assassination, no sort of
provision appeared to be made. They seemed to rest in the faith
that once King William were dead the country would rise of itself
to demand the recall of the rightful, exiled monarch, and that it
would be time enough then to marshal the forces that were to spring
as if by magic into view.</p>
<p>Whilst Colonel Walton would have been prepared to admit that
some such consummation was not entirely impossible, yet he would
have expected such a group of men as this to be concerned with the
preparation of detailed plans for dealing with the situation when
and if it arose, and the assignment to each of a definite post with
predetermined duties.</p>
<p>That no attempt was made to do anything of the kind, that no
thought of it even appeared to exist, increased the disdain in
which he held them as conspirators.</p>
<p>Meanwhile their sterile meetings continued, and continued to be
sterile, because from Court came no such precise word of King
William's journey as they were eagerly awaiting.</p>
<p>When word did at length come, in the last days of May, it was of
a character to throw the plotters into a flurry of
consternation.</p>
<p>It was Geoffrey Howard who brought it, straight from Court. The
little weasel-faced man came amongst them as pale as the lace at
his throat. He trembled and stammered in his excitement.</p>
<p>"Bad news," he announced to them. "The worst, in fact. I've just
learnt at Kensington that the Prince of Orange's departure for the
Hague is postponed. Indefinitely postponed."</p>
<p>His first two words had led them to fear something worse than
this. Perceiving now the relief on their countenances, and the
supercilious smiles of one or two, the peppery little man became
angry.</p>
<p>"Damme! Don't you realize what it means?"</p>
<p>"It means what you say," said Claybourne. "Postponement."</p>
<p>"Ha! And you think that's a matter to be taken coolly? What,
pray, does postponement mean at a time when he is so urgently
required by the Dutch States? Is it a trifling matter, or has it
some significance?"</p>
<p>This made them reflect. With reflection their faces lengthened,
and presently they were looking at one another with uneasy
eyes.</p>
<p>O'Grady chose to question the accuracy of Howard's information,
and thereby put Howard in another passion. Did they suppose that he
would bring them news of such gravity without first assuring
himself beyond doubt that it was correct? He had obtained the
information at the Palace directly from Cutts.</p>
<p>At this their uneasiness increased. Speculations began to be
voiced about the table at which they sat in that panelled
dining-room.</p>
<p>Was it possible that in spite of all their precautions, their
project was discovered? That King William was informed not only of
the existence of the plot, but of the occasion chosen for its
execution?</p>
<p>Why else should he postpone a journey of such vital importance
to him?</p>
<p>These were amongst the speculative questions they asked one
another in varying terms.</p>
<p>Colonel Walton took no part in this jejune discussion. He sat
back, with eyelids drooping sleepily over very watchful eyes. He
dissembled in an air of gloomy thoughtfulness an alertness that
missed not only no word, but no inflexion.</p>
<p>Of all those present the ever-reckless, volatile O'Grady was the
only one, he observed, who refused to be intimidated.</p>
<p>"Och, now, are we to start at shadows?" he demanded, to steady
the increasing disquiet. "There may be a dozen reasons of which we
know nothing for the postponement. So there may. And as for
discovery, faith, unless there's a traitor here amongst us, how
could that be possible at all?"</p>
<p>"But is a traitor impossible?" wondered Glenleven darkly "After
all, there was Prendergass in the last plot, and..."</p>
<p>Stuart of Meorach interrupted him impatiently "What are ye
saying, man?"</p>
<p>"What, indeed?" murmured the gentle Claybourne, his countenance
shocked.</p>
<p>"It's just blathering he is," said O'Grady, a sneer on his
nut-cracker face. "Child's talk! Would ye be after looking for a
traitor here? There's never a man among us whose loyalty hasn't
been put to the test, Glenleven. And it's not myself is the only
one to bear the scars of wounds taken in the service of King
James."</p>
<p>Glenleven inclined his head, partly convinced. "My suspicions
were perhaps too ready," he admitted. "But it is possible that
there may have been an imprudence."</p>
<p>Lady Lochmore looked round with eyes of intercession.</p>
<p>"If any here is conscious of it, let him frankly admit it now,
so that we may take our measures."</p>
<p>None answered her until Colonel Walton broke the silence he had
hitherto preserved. He addressed them generally "Measures should be
taken in any event. At least such measures as will remove her
ladyship from danger." Then he turned to her. "Would it not be
prudent if you were to leave town for the present? Withdraw into
the country, and dissociate yourself from us?"</p>
<p>O'Grady's hard stare seemed to be questioning him. But although
conscious of it, he continued: "If there are risks to be
run..."</p>
<p>And then her ladyship, herself, interrupted him. "I'll run them,
if you please, Colonel. My presence here is necessary."</p>
<p>"Necessary?" His question was an expostulation. "To receive
messages from your brother? Surely that is a function any one of us
may discharge equally well. If your cousin Glenleven were to
remain, and..."</p>
<p>"It is not enough, as Glenleven knows." She was firm. "My place
is here, Colonel, and nothing will move me from it. Certainly not
an alarm for which there may be no real grounds."</p>
<p>"That's what I say," O'Grady supported her. "There can be no
real grounds for all this panic. No grounds at all."</p>
<p>To the Irishman, Colonel Walton paid little heed. His whole
attention was given to her ladyship. And so determined and final
was her tone that he realized the idleness of saying more at the
moment, and in the presence of those others. He contrived, however,
that day to linger on, after the company had departed, and her
ladyship seemed nowise reluctant that he should do so. If she did
not invite, at least she did not discourage it.</p>
<p>Alone with him in that panelled chamber, where the chairs stood
awry about the table from which the conspirators had risen, he
renewed and elaborated his arguments for her withdrawal from town
until they should be assured that no real danger existed.</p>
<p>She went to occupy a window-seat whence she could overlook the
garden and the river and the green fields of the Southwark shore
beyond, all bright in the late May sunshine. She looked up at him
standing tall, elegant and earnest beside her. A faintly quizzical
smile played over her ivory-tinted face.</p>
<p>"I thought that I had already answered all this. I am touched,
sir, by your concern. But it is perhaps less flattering than you
suppose it."</p>
<p>"Flattery, madam, is a coarse incense to be burnt by cheap
gallants on the altar of vulgar divinities."</p>
<p>"Lord, sir! You are didactic," she mocked him.</p>
<p>"It is my desire to be plain."</p>
<p>"You scarcely succeed in it."</p>
<p>"That is to come. My aim, madam, is not to flatter; but to
save."</p>
<p>"To save? To save, do you say? That is vastly kind. But I am in
no need of saving."</p>
<p>"Madam, you are in urgent need of it. You may be in gravest
peril. Do not be deceived by the assumption that there may be no
real grounds for alarm. This postponement of the departure of the
Prince of Orange is a sure sign that the government has come by
knowledge of the plot against him."</p>
<p>She looked at him gravely "You are very positive. Why? Surely it
is just your fears that direct your conclusions. How can you
possibly be so certain that there are no other reasons? But I will
not attempt to persuade you. If you see nothing but danger and
discovery ahead, you are not obliged to linger. The way is open for
you to depart."</p>
<p>He shrugged. "I am committed," he said, which was pure truth.
"Besides, it is not my possible fate we are considering; but yours.
This is no woman's work."</p>
<p>She looked up again, in irritation now, a flush creeping into
her cheeks. But at sight of the gravity and kindliness in his grey
eyes, the emotion partly melted.</p>
<p>"I am a Macdonald," she said quietly</p>
<p>"Does that make you less than a woman?"</p>
<p>"It makes me something more than many a man."</p>
<p>He stared at her white fierceness. "Compassionate my dullness;
my ignorance. I am not a Scot and have never been in Scotland. To
be a Macdonald...? What is it, then?"</p>
<p>She rose to answer him, and her voice vibrated. "It is to be of
the blood of those who were foully, cruelly, treacherously
massacred at Glencoe by order of this Dutch usurper."</p>
<p>Breathlessly, in a few words, she told a tale that he already
knew; the tale of that foul deed, whose real authors were Stair and
Breadalbane and Argyll, performed in the name of a King,
who&mdash;as the Colonel believed&mdash;probably knew the truth of
it as little as any man in England.</p>
<p>"You speak of what we plan as murder. How, I wonder, would you
speak of that? For that was murder, indeed; ruthless, wholesale
butchery, foul and treacherous."</p>
<p>Her eyes seemed to blaze upon him from her white face.</p>
<p>Suddenly on a gust of emotion she swept past him to a buffet on
which stood a bowl of oranges. She snatched one up, and held it out
in her enveloping hand. "To this, sir, am I pledged. This do I
desire to see accomplished. In this must I lend my aid." And so
violently did she clench her hand upon the fruit that it burst
within her grasp and the juice of it squirted in all directions.
With a gesture of disdain and disgust, she flung the yellow pulp
into the empty fireplace, and sought a napkin for her hand.</p>
<p>Colonel Walton was touched, despite himself, by a display of
emotion as sincere and powerful as its expression was histrionic.
He bowed his head a little.</p>
<p>"Madam, you help me to understand yourself."</p>
<p>"You thought I plotted for the love of plotting, or so that I
might derive importance from it, or profit by it afterwards."</p>
<p>"Like your associates? No, no. I knew there was this nobler spur
for you."</p>
<p>"A spur, indeed. A goad. Glencoe! That was the foulness that
proved the man; the foulness that calls for vengeance to every
surviving Macdonald in the world."</p>
<p>The Colonel fetched a sigh. The moment was not one in which to
present his beliefs that King William was no conscious author of
that crime.</p>
<p>"Your anger may be righteous, and righteous the desire to see so
great a wrong avenged. Righteous, too, your zeal to see the lawful
king restored. But it still remains that you are a woman, and that
it is not for a woman to have active part in these things."</p>
<p>"There were women at Glencoe."</p>
<p>"And King William's butchers did not discriminate. Be that your
warning. They will not discriminate here if we are discovered. You
know the fate of regicides, in fact or in intent? It is common to
quarter them, and to exhibit the quarters in conspicuous places. A
head on Temple Bar, a leg or so at Aldgate..."</p>
<p>"Oh, this is brave of you! This is gallant!" Her sudden scorn
was fierce and withering. "You would make a coward of me by such
images..."</p>
<p>"None could do that," he broke in. "I but ask you to leave men's
work to men. The risk for you is now too grave. The consequence of
discovery too horrible. Nor are you really necessary for the
success of this enterprise, as those others know." He grew suddenly
hot and vehement, a rare thing with him, whose cold self-command
had passed, in France, into a byword. "I implore you not to suffer
yourself further to be used."</p>
<p>There was a moment's silence in which she continued in the
stricken astonishment his words had brought her. "Used?" she said
slowly, frowning, "I am being used?"</p>
<p>"By those who permitted you to enter into this, so that your
house might serve them for a rallying ground, so that your brother
might be a tool for the accomplishment of their own ambitions. For
that is the truth, the only truth I have gleaned from all their
talk at these meetings. It is all wrong. Most wrong of Glenleven,
who is your kinsman, allied to you by blood; and of Claybourne, who
offers to me the command of an army, to Dalkeith a secretaryship of
State, and something else to each of these self-seekers all of
whom, like himself, serve the King that they may serve themselves.
That they should imperil themselves for the chance of profit I can
condone. But not that they should recklessly imperil you in their
desperate gamble."</p>
<p>She stared at him wide-eyed.</p>
<p>"Are you mad?" she asked him.</p>
<p>He recovered his calm, and answered her: "It happens, madam,
that I reverence you; and I would have you reverenced by others;
and not used by any; still less imperilled by any."</p>
<p>"I thank you, sir." She was ironical. "I am flesh and blood. I
do not live in an altar-niche. And I am in no need of
champions."</p>
<p>"Neither is the Virgin Mary. But there are those who champion
her none the less."</p>
<p>She moved past him, straight and lissom, to the window again,
with a quickened heave of the breast to betray the perturbation he
had stirred.</p>
<p>"When do you reach your conclusion, sir? For I must suppose
there is a conclusion to all this." There was a hardness in her
voice.</p>
<p>He addressed himself to the graceful back she had turned upon
him. "I conclude, madam, where I began; by imploring you to depart
at once into the country; or, better still, cross to France, and
leave us men to confront the peril that already may be nearer than
you suspect."</p>
<p>"You do not hesitate to ask me to forsake these friends who
trust me?"</p>
<p>The strength of his feelings betrayed him into heat again.</p>
<p>"Say rather these men who play upon the sense of wrong under
which you labour, so as to make you a party to their schemes; who
use you; you, and Invernaion who is to strike the blow that will
open for them the door of opportunity; these men who would have you
continue to stake your own and your brother's life upon their
gamble, for their profit, even when discovery already shows how the
dice must fall against you."</p>
<p>"You speak of discovery as a fact, when it is still no more than
a possibility."</p>
<p>"Even as a possibility only, their manhood should take shame to
imperil you, as they shall hear from me perhaps when this adventure
is ended. For, however it ends, if they and I escape the
consequences, I shall have that to tell them which may help them to
a better understanding of themselves."</p>
<p>She wheeled sharply to face him. "You do not want for faith in
yourself."</p>
<p>"I do not, madam. Will you think over what I have said?"</p>
<p>"Not an instant. I forgive you the impertinence because of the
mistaken concern in which I perceive it to have been
practised."</p>
<p>He took a step towards her, then her gesture checked him. "No
more on this subject, Colonel Walton. I am tired. I beg that you
will leave me."</p>
<p>He hesitated yet a moment, then fetched an audible sigh, brought
his heels together, and bowed.</p>
<p>"Your ladyship's obliged servant," he said, and obediently
departed.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a>Chapter 17. The Wrath of
Glenleven</h2>
<p>Late that same night Glenleven came to Lochmore House. Her
ladyship had already retired. Nevertheless, upon hearing of his
presence, she rose again, and wrapped in a bed-gown, her lustrous
black hair confined in a lace coif, she descended to the library,
where he waited.</p>
<p>"You are very opportune, Jamie, in spite of the hour. I had
thought tonight of sending for you."</p>
<p>His eyes, very grave and searching, pondered the signs of
trouble which were obvious in her countenance.</p>
<p>"I was, myself, uneasy on your account," he said. "So uneasy
that I could not sleep until I had seen you." He made a pause
before adding: "Colonel Walton remained here with you today after
all had left."</p>
<p>She raised her brows. "You are well informed."</p>
<p>"I have seen Claybourne since," he explained. "Saving Colonel
Walton, he was the last to go. He told me that he had left the
Colonel with you."</p>
<p>Something quizzical in her glance drew a faint flush to that
narrow face of his.</p>
<p>"Do not suppose me jealous," he cried out. "All that is over.
You have seen, I hope, that I am not one of those tiresome men who
cannot take 'no' for an answer."</p>
<p>"I am not supposing it."</p>
<p>Indeed, she had little cause to do so. Glenleven's pursuit of
her, so ardent while it lasted, had ceased completely over a year
ago. The rebuff he had received when he hastened to her so
confidently after his release from the Tower had been the last that
he had courted. On the heels of that, his fear of being dealt with
by act of attainder had come to preoccupy him. But even when his
fear had been laid to rest, after that visit of his to Kensington
and his long interview with Portland, of which he could never bear
to speak, he had not again attempted to resume the wooing of Ailsa
Lochmore.</p>
<p>It was evident to her, and she was relieved by it, that he had
at last accepted her refusal as definite and final.</p>
<p>For months thereafter he had been at no pains to seek her, and
she had seen him merely at rare intervals, when he had been
strictly cousinly. It was only of late that they had been brought
once more into close relations by this plot of which Glenleven was
really the chief architect.</p>
<p>Because of what the plot owed to his invention and energy, and
because it opened the way to the accomplishment of what to her, as
to her brother, seemed almost a sacred duty, she had shown
Glenleven a greater warmth than ever before. Nor had he curtailed
it by any attempt to take advantage of it and reach for more than
was plainly offered. He had earned her increased esteem by his
circumspection, and also because, as it seemed to her, he had
thrown himself into these labours and these fresh perils out of a
selfless devotion which looked for no reward. In a similar warm
esteem had she held each of those whom he had associated with
himself.</p>
<p>Colonel Walton's words to her that day, pondered at leisure
after her cool dismissal of him, had come to disturb that good
opinion. However loftily, almost disdainfully, she might have
listened to the Colonel, what he had said was, nevertheless, a seed
which had since thrust roots into her mind.</p>
<p>The more she considered, the more confirmation did she discern
in the facts, themselves, for Colonel Walton's strictures upon the
motives actuating her fellow-conspirators.</p>
<p>The genial, courtly Claybourne, who secretly held from King
James a commission, which entitled him to regard himself as his
exiled majesty's ambassador to the Jacobites in England, saw
himself already as a kingmaker. When the King should come to his
own again Claybourne confidently counted upon holding under him a
position of such power and influence as that which Bentinck held
under King William. And as with Claybourne, so with each of the
others. Each was intent upon the rich morsel that should fall to
him from the restoration banquet.</p>
<p>She recalled having heard them come to the verge of altercation
over the great offices of State they considered should be
distributed amongst them when the restoration should be
accomplished.</p>
<p>Particularly, and naturally, did her thoughts dwell upon
Glenleven, both as her kinsman and as the real author of the plot,
the man who had suggested to Invernaion when and how the blow might
be struck. She remembered the reduced state of Glenleven's
fortunes; she recalled the venal arguments by which, after Glencoe,
her brother had re-awakened loyalty in this kinsman who had taken,
from venal motives, the oath of allegiance to the usurper. A doubt
entered her mind whether he, whom she had regarded as so selfless
in his devotion, were in reality as self-seeking as Colonel Walton
asserted.</p>
<p>Nor was it on the score of venality alone that in her mind she
began to reprobate him and those others. They would, after all,
scarcely have been human had they been so far removed from
worldliness as to look for no recompense from the King they were to
restore. But Colonel Walton had charged them with something more.
He had accused them of using her and Invernaion for their own
ambitious ends. Had he accused them of using her alone, she would
have let the accusation pass, even though she might perceive the
truth of it. But that they should use Invernaion, that they should
employ him as their tool, that they should imperil his life, so
that they might climb, making perhaps of his dead body a
stepping-stone to the eminences they coveted; this was an
intolerable, torturing thought to that loving sister.</p>
<p>It was the profound trouble into which this thought had cast her
which prompted the notion of sending for Glenleven, and made her
welcome now his coming.</p>
<p>At the same time, the anxiety that obviously must be urging him
when he sought her at this hour was mystifying. It was the more
mystifying since he disavowed&mdash;and truthfully, in her
view&mdash;all notion that jealousy was his spur.</p>
<p>"You had thought of sending for me," he was slowly saying, and
asked her bluntly: "Why?"</p>
<p>She waved him to a chair, and herself sank to another, drawing
the rich, fur-trimmed robe about her. But instead of answering, she
counter-questioned him.</p>
<p>"You were uneasy on my account. So uneasy that you could not
sleep. Why?"</p>
<p>He stared at her. "My God! Are we to fence with each other?" Her
dark brows met in a frown. Her glance was very straight and
level.</p>
<p>"That's an odd question, Jamie. Does your conscience make you
perceive a reason why we should? You seek me at an unconscionable
hour. I am entitled to an explanation, and I am waiting for it so
that I may return to bed."</p>
<p>For a moment he seemed nonplussed. Then leaning forward, his
elbow on his knee, he spoke quickly.</p>
<p>"Since you are in haste, then, I must be blunt, out of concern
for you. What had Colonel Walton to say to you when he hung behind
today?"</p>
<p>She continued to look at him straightly for a moment or two.
"What do you fear, Jamie?" she asked at last.</p>
<p>He straightened himself abruptly. It was a movement of
exasperation. "Will you answer no question of mine?" he broke
out.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. When you ask me one in which I can perceive your
concern."</p>
<p>"I see," he said. He was oddly sharp and irritable. "If you tell
me that Colonel Walton stayed behind to make love to you, then it
is not my concern; and that is the end of the matter. I may go
sleep in peace."</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed angrily. Her lips parted to speak. Then, as if
the thought to be uttered were checked and changed, they curled a
little. In a voice of obvious restraint she answered him. "That was
not Colonel Walton's purpose. He stayed to represent to me again my
danger."</p>
<p>"Danger!" He snorted, contemptuously angry. "What danger?"</p>
<p>"The danger of being hanged, drawn and quartered, of course. The
quarters conspicuously exhibited. A head on Temple Bar, a leg or so
on Aldgate."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Why do you cry out? You'll not deny that this danger
exists?"</p>
<p>"If it exists at all, it exists for every one of us."</p>
<p>"But more particularly for Ian who is your catspaw."</p>
<p>"Was that Colonel Walton's suggestion?" Glenleven was suddenly
livid.</p>
<p>"I do not think he used that word. But it contains the truth.
Does it not? For every one of you there will be great profit if
restoration follows upon the death of William of Orange. Claybourne
looks to play the part of Monk, and already apportions among you
the high offices you are to fill. I do not know what is to be your
office, Jamie; but I do know the dilapidated state of your fortunes
and how richly a King's gratitude will repair them. It is Ian,
however, who is to strike the blow devised by you; and Ian may well
leave his own life in the business so as to make the fortunes of
you others who sit snugly here at home. That is the real end to
which Ian's righteous desire to avenge Macdonald blood is being
used."</p>
<p>Glenleven got up, shaking with passion. "As God's my life, this
knave has schooled you famously."</p>
<p>"No, no," she said. "He merely pointed the way. The rest I have
since perceived for myself."</p>
<p>"And you intend?" He was peremptory.</p>
<p>She made a little gesture of helplessness. "I have no
intentions... yet. I have told you that it was in my mind to send
for you. But now I ask myself why."</p>
<p>He stood looking down at her in silence, and gradually now his
manner changed. The fury faded out of him, until he had become once
more his coldly courteous self. Not until then did he permit
himself to speak.</p>
<p>"I think that I can supply the answer," he said with comparative
quiet. "You desired to test on me these doubts that have been sown
in you."</p>
<p>"It may have been that," she admitted. "I scarcely know."</p>
<p>"Of course it was that. What else could it be? I think I
understand. This fellow Walton has the presumption to be in love
with you."</p>
<p>She would have interrupted him, but he held up a hand to check
her. "I have read it in his eyes each time they look on you." His
smile was quietly scornful. "That emotion makes him fearful where
you are concerned. And fear magnifies and distorts all things.</p>
<p>"Listen," he said, and in that musical, persuasive voice, from
which he excluded now all harshness of passion, he set himself to
combat these new-born prejudices, to expose the error and injustice
that lurked in them.</p>
<p>For those who actively laboured for the restoration of King
James there might well be rewards. That was what usually happened
in such cases. Neither more nor less. Was it, then, to be pretended
that because of those rewards men were not to labour to restore a
rightful king? If they were venal, then every man who had ever set
his hand to the righting of a wrong such as existed now in England
was also venal. She saw, he hoped, the puerility of such a
contention.</p>
<p>To accuse them of making a tool of Invernaion for the
gratification of their own ambitions, and to imply that they did
not share the risks Invernaion ran in this undertaking was
fantastically unjust. Did she forget how he, himself, had gone to
the Tower, and very nearly to the headsman, for conspiring in a
degree no deeper than the present? And if the plot should fail, as
plots were always liable to fail, especially when doubts such as
Walton had sown came to weaken resolve, did she suppose that he
would again escape? Whatever the fate of the others, his doom would
not lie in doubt.</p>
<p>That argument shook her a little.</p>
<p>But Glenleven had not yet done. He could trace these slanders
uttered by Walton to their very source. The Colonel's military
experience and acknowledged talents made him valuable to them.
Walton, however, was a soldier by trade, a self-confessed mercenary
who made no secret of the fact that his loyalty was to the hand
that paid him. Had she forgotten how this had been discussed when
it was first proposed to bring Walton into their enterprise?
Glenleven had enlisted him by holding out to him the prospect of
the great reward that would await his labours.</p>
<p>Because Walton had been persuaded by venal arguments, he defamed
them all by the assumption that they were all in like case, that
venality was their only incentive. And now at the first negligible
shadow of danger, because of his feelings for her ladyship, Colonel
Walton used that assumption as an argument to detach her from the
undertaking.</p>
<p>This specious reasoning lightened her doubts still further.</p>
<p>To set a crown to his persuasive advocacy, Glenleven made an
appeal to her emotions. He spoke of Glencoe and of the sacred duty
it placed upon every living Macdonald. In the fulfilment of that
duty, he, for one, would flinch before no risk. He spoke of
Invernaion as an avenging angel, an incarnation of overdue
Macdonald vengeance upon the chief dastardly author of that
massacre of Macdonalds. The real danger to Invernaion lay in any
faltering here, in their failure to support him with timely and
accurate information. The very opportunity now chosen was one that
reduced the risk to an almost negligible point. And Invernaion, he
reminded her, was not alone over there. He was well supported, his
measures would be well and cautiously taken, and he would be given
every assistance.</p>
<p>He was still talking in this strain when she made an end of
argument.</p>
<p>"It is enough, Jamie. I have been, perhaps, too ready to listen
to the voice of fear."</p>
<p>"You mean the voice of Walton."</p>
<p>"If you will. It may well be that regard for me has made him
magnify the dangers. You have supplied me with answers for him if
he should renew his arguments."</p>
<p>"Of that," said Glenleven, "he shall have no opportunity."</p>
<p>She looked up quickly, moved by the sinister note in his voice.
"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Just that. I owe a duty to you in the absence of your brother.
This man's presumption must be punished."</p>
<p>"You've changed your views since you arrived," she said, and
grew severe. "I am in no need of champions, Jamie. I can punish
presumption for myself."</p>
<p>He bowed coldly "So be it. But I still owe a duty to myself.
This man has defamed me."</p>
<p>"That is an overstatement. It is something for which no word of
mine gives you authority."</p>
<p>"This is frivolous." His patience was slipping from him again.
"And anyway, I do not intend that he shall recommence; that he
shall again attempt to..."</p>
<p>She was on her feet, alarm plain in her face. "What do you
intend to do?"</p>
<p>"What does a gentleman do to a slanderer?"</p>
<p>She advanced upon him. She gripped his arm with a strength he
had never suspected in her slim white hand.</p>
<p>"Jamie, you shall not! I forbid it. You must not make a quarrel
of it. This matter is to go no further."</p>
<p>He held himself very straight as he gave her back glance for
glance. His eyes were hard to the point of cruelty, and there was a
cruel set to his mouth. "Your concern for this adventurer supplies
an added reason why I should kill him."</p>
<p>"Kill him!" she echoed. "Kill him!"</p>
<p>"Oh, but in proper form." A wicked little smile broke on his
white face. "For murder I stoop to nothing less than a king. A
friend of mine shall wait upon Colonel Walton in the morning."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-18" id="ch-18"></a>Chapter 18. The Encounter</h2>
<p>Major O'Grady sought Colonel Walton in his Covent Garden
lodging, and found him at breakfast in bed-gown of flowered silk
over frilled shirt and satin breeches, his cropped head swathed in
a kerchief of blue silk, with Lavernis in attendance.</p>
<p>"Ye're early astir, Major."</p>
<p>The Irishman's dark face looked more sinister than ever. "Needs
must when the devil drives. What's your quarrel, now, with
Glenleven?"</p>
<p>The Colonel showed surprise at the question. "I am aware of
none."</p>
<p>"Faith, then, ye soon will be. For, bedad, he's on his way to
you now to settle it. And since he don't choose that the town
should be after knowing the details, he proposed to me that I
should be with you against your need of a friend. Hence the
intrusion at such an hour."</p>
<p>The Colonel stared for a moment. "I am honoured by your support,
sir," he said with cold formality. He liked O'Grady rather less
than any of his fellow-conspirators, which is to say that he
disliked him considerably.</p>
<p>"A glass of hock, Major?"</p>
<p>"And why not, faith?" The Major brimmed himself a bumper.</p>
<p>The Colonel waved Lavernis from the room, and went on with his
breakfast.</p>
<p>O'Grady sat down. "It's ill done of Glenleven, so it is. And I'm
hoping you'll reason him out of his humour."</p>
<p>"If the gentleman is within easy reach of reason."</p>
<p>"I've never known a swordsman to be that. Usually he accounts it
cowardly; being sure to kill his man."</p>
<p>"And Glenleven comes in that conviction, does he?"</p>
<p>"That's his assertion. Bad cess to it!"</p>
<p>The Colonel sighed. "I hope you esteem me well enough, Major, to
send a handsome wreath to my funeral."</p>
<p>The Irishman scowled at him. "It's wrong ye are to treat the
matter lightly. I wouldn't in your place."</p>
<p>"But, then, ye're not in my place. Be thankful."</p>
<p>Lord Glenleven came in briskly, ushered by Lavernis and followed
closely by Stuart of Meorach.</p>
<p>The Colonel flung down his napkin, and rose to receive them. His
lordship was direct, abrupt and frosty.</p>
<p>"Colonel Walton, it has come to my knowledge that you have said
that which hurts my honour. Need I be more particular?"</p>
<p>The Colonel was urbane. "Why no. Nor yet so anxious to meet
trouble."</p>
<p>"It's a characteristic of my race."</p>
<p>"But are you sure that it is prudent?"</p>
<p>"More so than backbiting, Colonel Walton."</p>
<p>"Backbiting, my lord? Do you impute that to me?"</p>
<p>"You don't like the imputation?"</p>
<p>"I find it harsh. But no matter. And I forget my manners. A
glass of wine, Glenleven?"</p>
<p>"Curse your wine."</p>
<p>The Colonel looked at him, sadly pensive. "Ye're determined not
to be civil?"</p>
<p>Glenleven exploded. "Damme! D'ye suppose I'm here to be
civil?"</p>
<p>"It would be prudent."</p>
<p>"Prudent? Oh, aye!" He sneered. "Ye're in love with prudence on
a sudden. Had you practised it in your criticisms of me yesterday
there'd be less need for it now."</p>
<p>"There is always need for it, my lord, believe me."</p>
<p>"Ay, for cowards," said his lordship, and waited to see the
colour rise in the Colonel's pale face. But he waited in vain. The
Colonel remained unruffled, looking down from his fine height upon
the shorter man.</p>
<p>"Not only for cowards, I assure you. Shall we be sensible,
Glenleven? Whatever your quarrel with me, is it not your duty and
mine to declare an armistice until the matter demanding our
alliance is concluded?"</p>
<p>"Faith, now, that's a sensible suggestion," put in O'Grady.</p>
<p>But Glenleven, clearly, was not of the same opinion. "To be
frank, I am none so comfortable in this alliance; and we might not,
ourselves, survive it. That, I believe, was the opinion you
expressed. You spoke of quarterings, too. Most delicate."</p>
<p>"If we do not survive, will this our difference matter?"</p>
<p>Glenleven showed exasperation. "You're cursedly reluctant. Will
this quicken you?" And he swept his feathered hat across the
Colonel's face.</p>
<p>The Colonel fell back a pace to save his eyes. He remained
straight and stiff, but showed no sign of intimidation. Glenleven
did not know that it was said in France of Colonel Walton that he
had never refused a challenge, and never killed an adversary. He
sighed. "You're too hot, Glenleven, for a good plotter. But have
with you. Give me leave to get my coat."</p>
<p>Imperturbable he bowed and went out, calling Lavernis to attend
him. When he returned, in coat and periwig and wearing a sword, he
found an altercation in progress and O'Grady clamorous.</p>
<p>"I tell you it's ill done, Glenleven, so it is. Sure if one of
ye's killed, the other is arrested and the devil knows where the
inquiries will end or what may be ferreted out."</p>
<p>"Spare yourself, O'Grady," said the Colonel. "No one will be
killed this morning."</p>
<p>Glenleven turned sharply to look down his nose at him, Stuart of
Meorach, drawing a rash conclusion, expressed it in contempt: "Are
ye not coming, then?"</p>
<p>The Colonel bowed, and waved them on. "I follow, if you will
lead, sirs."</p>
<p>They paused to stare at him. Then Glenleven and Sir Hamish went
out. The Colonel followed with O'Grady.</p>
<p>They came out of the shadow of the Piazza into the sunshine, and
made their way by a pleasant lane to the fields behind Lincoln's
Inn.</p>
<p>"The Devil fly away with me if I understand you," the Major
grumbled, as he walked with the Colonel a few paces behind the
others.</p>
<p>"In what am I mysterious?"</p>
<p>"This concern, now, for Ailsa Lochmore. Pure sentimentality, so
it is; and there's no room for that when you're engaged in such
business as ours."</p>
<p>Colonel Walton disdained to argue. The Major grumbled on. "It's
mighty ill ye're behaving. Both you and Glenleven."</p>
<p>"It distresses me not to merit your approval, Major."</p>
<p>"Oh, curse your sneers."</p>
<p>They came by a gate into a field where sheep had grazed the turf
to a serviceable surface. They found a smooth space behind a screen
of shrubs, and made ready swiftly and almost without words.</p>
<p>The Colonel removed his baldrick, stripped off his coat, and
bound up the long black curls of his periwig. Then, sword in hand,
he studied the ground and the light until Glenleven approached, and
they got to work.</p>
<p>His lordship attacked vigorously, revealing a skill, speed and
experience that more than compensated for the comparative shortness
of his reach. It was plain also from the outset that he meant
mischief. There was a grim, vicious purposefulness in his repeated
lunges in carte following upon feintes in the low lines, and aiming
straight at his opponent's heart.</p>
<p>But Glenleven, so easily victorious in so many encounters,
neither knew nor yet realized with whom he had to deal. He
construed into signs of timidity and conscious inferiority the fact
that the Colonel fenced entirely on the defensive, and to this
alone did he ascribe it that he found the opposing guard so firm
and close. He was not disillusioned until he had attempted that
high lunge of his once too often. The Colonel, expecting it,
side-stepped to avoid the point, and so brought himself
effortlessly within his adversary's guard. There, without apparent
haste, he transfixed Glenleven's sword-arm.</p>
<p>The blade fell from his lordship's suddenly powerless hand. Sir
Hamish, goggle-eyed, was instantly at his side.</p>
<p>The Colonel stepped back, lowered his recovered point, and, with
head slightly inclined, stood watching his disabled opponent, his
breathing as easy as when the combat started.</p>
<p>"I promised you that no one should be killed this morning. I
keep my promises. All of them. I think it was perhaps a doubt of
that which made you put this quarrel upon me. Perhaps you will
perceive proof of it in my moderation." His manner was entirely
deferential.</p>
<p>Glenleven, wincing with pain, looked into the Colonel's steady
eyes.</p>
<p>And then, in the view of the onlookers, an odd thing happened.
The expression of baffled fury gradually passed from his lordship's
face. In the end he was smiling weakly.</p>
<p>"You are generous, damme! You might as easily have put your
sword through my body."</p>
<p>"And sheltered myself afterwards by disclosing the grounds of
our quarrel, or so much of them as would have ensured me the favour
of Monsieur Bentinck. You perceive what a passport to his
consideration that would have been; what profitable employment
might then have awaited me. I hope your lordship perceives it."</p>
<p>The portent of Glenleven's conciliatory expression was
momentarily lost in a stare of amazement instantly suppressed.</p>
<p>"Stab me!" he cried. "I do perceive it. I took you for a coward,
Walton."</p>
<p>"Appearances are proverbially deceptive. Particularly mine."</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>Glenleven, a little bewildered, was scowling now, and gnawing
his lip. Abruptly he put out his sound left hand. "I beg your
pardon, Colonel Walton."</p>
<p>It was the Colonel's turn to frown and hesitate. But only for a
moment. He took the proffered hand.</p>
<p>"You are generous in your turn," he said. "Oddly generous." And
he went on quickly: "I regret the inconvenience caused you. But in
a week all will be well again."</p>
<p>He assisted the clumsy Stuart to bandage the arm with a
kerchief. Then he resumed his garments, took courteous leave, and
departed with O'Grady.</p>
<p>The Irishman was still grumbling. "Faith, here's much ado about
nothing. Glenleven might have begun where he ended, and saved
himself a blood-letting."</p>
<p>"It's good for the humours," said the Colonel. "His lordship is
a trifle hot for a Scotsman. And it'll be salutary for him to
depend a little less in future upon his swordsmanship."</p>
<p>"Will somebody tell me why he wanted to quarrel with you at
all?" quoth the intrigued O'Grady.</p>
<p>"You heard what he alleged. But I suspect that what you opined
of me may be true of him: he is moved to sentimentality where Lady
Lochmore is concerned."</p>
<p>"Arrah, now, that shaft's wide of the mark. It might ha' found
it once. But that was long since. Anyway, over a year ago: before
Glenleven's committal to the Tower. All the town knew then that he
hoped to marry Ailsa Lochmore, and all the town was sure that in
the end he would. But her ladyship disappointed both the town and
Glenleven; for after his release from the Tower, which was thanks
to what Ian Macdonald did, there was a sudden end of his pursuit of
her. And that must have been by her ladyship's wish, for Glenleven
would never have turned his back on the fortune she'ld ha' brought
him. Not he, very near beggared as he is. Maybe she had scruples on
the score of consanguinity; for they're over-kin to wed."</p>
<p>The Colonel nodded thoughtfully, and his chin remained sunk in
his Steinkirk. The Irishman babbled on.</p>
<p>"Faith, it must have been like the torment of Tantalus to a man
in his case, to see a fortune dangling before him and just out of
reach. And faith it's not the only fortune that's near him and yet
not near enough to grasp." O'Grady chuckled maliciously "Isn't he
heir to all the broad acres of Invernaion, and aren't they just as
far from him?"</p>
<p>The Colonel checked in his stride to face the Irishman, his eyes
solemn. "Heir to Invernaion! Of course he is. I had not realized
it." For a moment, lost in thought, he continued to stare vacantly
at the Major. Then he shrugged, and moved on, O'Grady stepping
beside him. "Invernaion is no formidable obstacle to that
inheritance, considering the mission in life he has made his own."
He spoke almost sadly.</p>
<p>"Arrah, now! Aren't they linked together in it? If Invernaion
falls, he certainly pulls Glenleven down, whoever else falls with
him."</p>
<p>"None of which," said the Colonel, "explains why Glenleven
having been in such anxiety to kill me, should afterwards be in a
like anxiety to be friends again."</p>
<p>"To be sure, now, it's all just blathering nonsense, as I said
from the first. Glenleven is just the devil himself on a point of
honour. It's this being a swordsman makes him so. But honour being
satisfied, there's a gentlemanly end to bad blood. Ye'll own his
apology was a gracious one considering ye'd skewered his arm."</p>
<p>"So unnaturally gracious that I'm still seeking the reason for
it." "But haven't I just supplied it?"</p>
<p>"To your own satisfaction, Major. Not to mine." And he quoted:
"<i>Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes</i>."</p>
<p>"Now isn't it hard to please ye are, Colonel darling?" the
Irishman grumbled, but himself fell silently thoughtful, and so
remained until they parted in the neighbourhood of Covent
Garden.</p>
<p>Coming alone into the Piazza, the Colonel found a hackney-coach
drawn up before his lodging, and in his room, to his vast
amazement, my Lady Lochmore, in cloak and wimple, awaiting him.</p>
<p>"Faith, it's a morning of surprises," was his rueful
comment.</p>
<p>She had sprung up as he entered, her white face anxious. "Are
you hurt?" she greeted him.</p>
<p>"Hurt, madam?" His dark brows went up in inquiry. But he lost
some colour, and for once his breathing was quickened.</p>
<p>"Where is Jamie?"</p>
<p>"At the moment I could not answer with precision."</p>
<p>"You know what I am asking." She was fiercely impatient. She
fluttered hither and thither in her agitation. "Your servant told
me you went out together&mdash;four of you." She came up to him,
and seized his arms. "What have you done with him?"</p>
<p>"Done with him?" The Colonel smiled. "We took a friendly walk in
the fields. Glenleven had the misfortune to scratch his arm. Oh,
but a trifling matter. What did you fear?"</p>
<p>Her dark eyes searched that quietly smiling countenance. Then
becoming conscious of her tight grip of his arms, she loosed it,
and stepped back.</p>
<p>"My God! How calm you are! Are you always so?"</p>
<p>"It is my endeavour. But I do not always succeed. Just now when
I discovered you, I was alarmed. I am still. Under my calm I
tremble for you. It is vastly indiscreet of Lady Lochmore to seek
me here. Her good name..."</p>
<p>"Jamie had sworn that he would kill you."</p>
<p>"Men are so rash in the promises they will make a lady."</p>
<p>"You mock. But Jamie has a dangerous repute."</p>
<p>"Yet you were concerned for him?"</p>
<p>"For him!" she cried, and instantly checked. Conscious that her
tone had betrayed the truth, the colour deepened in her face. She
sought to retract, to cover her disclosure. "It was, sir, that I
was distraught that my indiscretion should have been a source of
quarrel between two men so precious to the cause."</p>
<p>"Your indiscretion? It was no more than that?" said he, although
already in her bearing he held proof of what he asked.</p>
<p>"What else were you supposing?"</p>
<p>"It might have been a complaint of me to your kinsman."</p>
<p>She shook her head. "No. It was not that. Nor could Glenleven
suppose it. I pondered your misgivings yesterday after you had
gone. I saw the peril to the cause if they were well-founded. Jamie
came to me, and in my heat I used some of the expressions you had
used. He concluded that you had sown thoughts in me which never
could have been my own. He knew that you had remained with me
yesterday after the others had gone. He drew conclusions, and
departed with the threat to kill you for defaming him. I think,
too, he was uneasy about you in other ways; mistrustful of your
loyalty. This morning my alarm had grown so that it gave me no
peace. I came to warn you, and found I had hesitated too long and
arrived too late."</p>
<p>He smiled upon the confusion of this high-spirited lady</p>
<p>"I thank God it was just so," he said. "I would not for all the
world have had it otherwise. I feared at first... But no matter
what I feared. All that is over now. Glenleven and I are friends
again."</p>
<p>She smiled at him in frank wonder. "You make all things
possible."</p>
<p>"What I ask myself," he said, "is what part I had in this that
could accomplish it. An odd fellow, your kinsman."</p>
<p>"In your hands, perhaps. You are one who succeeds with all and
in all."</p>
<p>His eyes grew wistful. "Believe me, that is not my history at
all. If it were, I should now..." He broke off and shrugged to
imply that the thought was not worth uttering.</p>
<p>"You would what?"</p>
<p>He considered her, so slim and graceful, so proud of carriage,
so black and white and so desirable. Her glowing eyes seemed
clearly to invite him to confidences. For an instant he was in
danger of succumbing to the temptation that assailed him. Then
remembrance set a check upon him. Remembrance of several
things.</p>
<p>She saw his face darken into gravity</p>
<p>"Madam! I was forgetting. If your ladyship were found here!"</p>
<p>"Oh, what then? What then? Who cares?"</p>
<p>"Suffer me to care." He proffered his hand. "I will conduct you
to your carriage."</p>
<p>Her eyes pondered him a moment, almost in sombre resentment,
then, without another word, she took the proffered hand, and they
went below in silence.</p>
<p>Bareheaded he stood at the door of her carriage to take his
leave of her, "I am deeply touched, madam, by your solicitude," he
said. "Deeply grateful for your explanation, and comforted by
it."</p>
<p>"It was no more than due," she answered him, a sudden coolness
in her voice.</p>
<p>The memory of that coolness abode with him when he had returned
above and sat recalling her every spoken word. His long, handsome
countenance was illumined by a wistful smile.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-19" id="ch-19"></a>Chapter 19. The Avowal</h2>
<p>By no means the least surprising feature of the affair between
Colonel Walton and my Lord Glenleven was that it left upon the
surface of things no trace of its passage. If their fellow plotters
were aware of the quarrel and the meeting&mdash;and it is
impossible to suppose on the part of O'Grady and Sir Hamish Stuart
such discreetness as would leave them in ignorance&mdash;they made
no allusion to it, and generally behaved as if nothing of the kind
had occurred.</p>
<p>Glenleven, of course, bore upon his person the signs of the
encounter. It was impossible for him to conceal a wound which
compelled him to carry his arm in a sling. But the injury sustained
by his pride, the pride of a man who had brought himself to be
regarded as an invincible swordsman, he did tolerably succeed in
dissembling. He may have winced a little under the scarcely
suppressed, humorously scornful glance with which Lady Lochmore
received him when next day he presented himself; but he let it pass
in silence. Beyond a certain surliness there was no change
perceptible in his demeanour when the plotters met some three days
later at Lochmore House, in response to an urgent summons from her
ladyship. Towards Colonel Walton, who was also present, his
lordship observed a cool courtesy that scarcely differed from his
normal chilly manner.</p>
<p>They assembled about a long table in the library, under the
sombre painted eyes of the late Earl of Lochmore's puritanical
sire.</p>
<p>The occasion of the summons proved to be the arrival from France
of Mr Richard Hay, whom her ladyship presented to the company as
the bearer of important tidings.</p>
<p>They beheld a young gentleman, tall and shapely, in an
exaggeratedly curled red periwig, which went ill with his sallow
complexion. He was very fine in green velvet, with shoulder-knots
and gold-laced rosettes at his knees and on his high-heeled shoes,
and he wore the ridiculous little moustache that was becoming
fashionable with fops in France. He moved from the hips with the
step of a dancing-master, and gesticulated and postured like a
play-actor.</p>
<p>He was, Colonel Walton reflected with secret scorn, a figure to
take the eye.</p>
<p>Mr Hay announced to them, with outrageous self-sufficiency of
manner and tone, that he came from Saint Germains and Versailles,
and that he was charged with messages to them from King James, King
Louis, and Ian Macdonald of Invernaion. He made it clear that he
regarded himself, and desired them to regard him, as a
plenipotentiary, and there was more than a hint in his mincing,
affected opening address to them that he expected them henceforth
to submit to his direction the enterprise which they had in
hand.</p>
<p>From King Louis he brought them a definite promise of troops
once the country should have risen to restore its rightful King. To
Colonel Walton at least there was nothing very novel in this. King
Louis had been saying, quite sincerely, the same thing for a year
and more.</p>
<p>From King James Mr Hay was the bearer of a lengthy message,
which, when reduced to plain terms, amounted to little more than a
blessing upon the labours they were putting forth on his behalf and
a promise to reward those labours liberally once he should be back
in his Palace at Whitehall.</p>
<p>Lastly the envoy came to the real business of his journey. He
had brought a letter from Ian Macdonald, which whilst addressed to
Lady Lochmore was in fact intended for them all, since it contained
information and instructions which concerned every person
present.</p>
<p>This letter, Mr Hay announced, her ladyship would read to them;
and with that announcement he at last sat down.</p>
<p>There was a stir of interest as her ladyship took up the sheet,
and then an expectant silence. Upon that silence arose the quiet,
level voice of Colonel Walton.</p>
<p>"Is it necessary or even desirable that your ladyship should
read this letter to us?"</p>
<p>The frown with which she looked at him was one of inquiry. He
was similarly considered by the others.</p>
<p>"Surely," said Claybourne, "we must hear it. How else are we to
know its contents?"</p>
<p>"But is it necessary that we should?" the Colonel insisted. "Mr
Hay speaks of information and instructions. I agree that we should
all hear the instructions. But without knowing what the information
is, I cannot judge the expediency of publishing it even here. I
would suggest, with submission, that her ladyship should impart to
us no more of the information than may be necessary for an
understanding of the instructions."</p>
<p>The impatience about him was obvious and general. It was O'Grady
who gave it expression.</p>
<p>"I don't know what may be in your mind, Colonel. But ye've heard
Mr Hay. And what he said was that this letter is intended for us
all, as of course it should be."</p>
<p>"I am not concerned with what Mr Hay has said. But with the fact
itself."</p>
<p>"How, sir?" Mr Hay was purple. "Do you imply that I would say
anything that is not in accord with the facts."</p>
<p>"Mr Hay, it is not my way to make implications. I am at pains to
be plain. This letter is addressed to Lady Lochmore. That is the
fact. In all the circumstances I must regard the letter itself as
an indiscretion; a dangerous indiscretion. If it should have fallen
into hostile hands..."</p>
<p>Her ladyship interrupted him.</p>
<p>"You are under a misconception, Colonel Walton. The letter is in
cipher. It is a cipher devised by Ian, and employed between him and
me."</p>
<p>Someone laughed at what he imagined to be the Colonel's
discomfiture. But the Colonel was not discomfited.</p>
<p>"That merely lessens the imprudence. It does not extinguish it.
I never yet saw a cipher that with a little trouble could not be
deciphered. And the very employment of cipher can in itself be
incriminating. But let that pass. Let us assume that the cipher
covers the indiscretion of the actual letter. It is still for your
ladyship to consider whether the information it contains is such as
might be published here without peril to your brother."</p>
<p>"The devil fly away with me if I know what ye mean," said
O'Grady, so hotly that it was plain he had no doubt at all of what
was in the Colonel's mind.</p>
<p>Glenleven added in his most acid tone: "But that we have your
assurance, Colonel Walton, that it is not your way to make
implications, your meaning would be clear enough to me."</p>
<p>And then her ladyship intervened, and so averted the storm that
seemed likely to break about the Colonel's head.</p>
<p>"Whatever may be in Colonel Walton's mind, sirs," she said, with
quiet dignity, "I am satisfied that his intentions are of the
worthiest. But the matter is one for my decision. Even Colonel
Walton has admitted that. Now in my view the letter is not personal
to myself, as you will, I think, agree when you have heard it. It
is addressed personally to me merely for convenience and because
the cipher employed renders this necessary. But it is clearly
intended for you all. So that it but remains for me to read
it."</p>
<p>Colonel Walton sank back in his chair with an air of
resignation, indifferent to the mockingly triumphant sneers of one
or two of his fellow-plotters. He had done his best to check what
he feared might be the publication of a vital secret. To insist
further would be merely to raise an unprofitable garboil.</p>
<p>Her ladyship in clear level tones began to read. As she
proceeded the terms of the letter confirmed the Colonel's worst
fears.</p>
<p>The instructions came first, and these were innocuous enough.
Apparently they answered a question sent him by her ladyship on
behalf of her associates. They amounted to little more than a
strong recommendation to those who were in the plot, to employ the
time of waiting in such measures among their Jacobite friends as
would ensure that, once the blow were struck, leaders would be
everywhere at hand, to encourage and promote a general rising.
Invernaion entered into some details as to how they should proceed,
so that preparation starting from themselves should spread in
ever-widening circles throughout England.</p>
<p>Then Invernaion passed on to give that information about himself
and his movements which Colonel Walton dreaded and would have
suppressed. He announced that as the time for action must now be
imminent, he was taking up his quarters at the Auberge du Soleil at
Calais, under the assumed name of Richard Jerningham, and that he
would wait there until he received from them the definite news of
the sailing of the Prince of Orange for the Hague. Once he
possessed this information, he would cross the frontier to join a
group of loyal gentlemen who awaited him, to share with him the
enterprise and to do what must be done in memory of Glencoe and so
as to bring the rightful King to his own.</p>
<p>He closed with a strong recommendation to them not to lose a
moment in informing him of the settled date of the sailing of
William of Orange.</p>
<p>By the time her ladyship had come to the end of the letter,
Colonel Walton's attitude towards the reading of it had been
forgotten by his fellow-plotters in the excitement of seeing
themselves at last confronted with the necessity of passing from
words to deeds. Yet for the moment it was in words that they
continued to deal.</p>
<p>Glenleven made an inflammatory speech, not one syllable of which
was necessary or useful. Others followed more briefly, until all
save only Colonel Walton had contributed something to this Jacobite
symposium.</p>
<p>The Colonel was gloomily contemptuous of them, and in his heart
appalled. The last and most important of the facts which Lord
Portland desired to learn, the principal fact which Colonel Walton
had been commissioned by him to ascertain, was now disclosed. Once
armed with this knowledge the heavy hand of the law would no longer
pause in its descent upon these plotters. This was not mere
conjecture. Lord Portland, himself, had clearly stated, as Colonel
Walton now remembered, that he waited only to make sure that the
really troublesome and really dangerous Ian Macdonald of Invernaion
could be laid by the heels before, in his own words, putting his
foot on this wasp's nest of treason.</p>
<p>Sitting a little apart and very pensive, the Colonel became
conscious some moments after O'Grady had ceased his brief final
contribution to that unnecessary oratory that her ladyship's eyes
were upon him, inviting him.</p>
<p>He looked round and found himself regarded by them all in
expectant silence. He shook his head. "We have had too many words
already." His ill-humoured tone was in itself a reproof. "Fewer
would have been more prudent."</p>
<p>The self-sufficient, histrionic Mr Hay permitted himself to
smile unpleasantly.</p>
<p>"In such a business as this, courage is of more account than
prudence."</p>
<p>"They are not incompatible, sir," he was coldly answered. "With
his own fortunes a man may be as reckless as lies within his
humour. Not so with the fortunes of another, and particularly with
the fortunes of a king, with which are bound up the fortunes of a
people." He rose abruptly. "Since there's no more to say, I'll take
the air, by your leave." And he went out alone by the open French
window into the garden.</p>
<p>Their surprised, resentful glances followed him. Mr Hay, who
accounted himself cavalierly used, was the first to speak. He was
breathing hard, and there was a dark flush upon his
countenance.</p>
<p>"But that man!" he cried, in the Gallic phraseology he affected.
"Is he mad, then?" He heaved himself up impetuously, and moved to
follow him. But Claybourne, rising, too, put himself in his
way.</p>
<p>"Let be, sir! Let be!" He murmured, conciliatory</p>
<p>"Let be? You can't have heard him. An explanation is necessary.
Very necessary."</p>
<p>"Och, it's not necessary at all," drawled O'Grady "Sure it's a
man with notions of his own, and we may leave him to them. Anything
else would scarcely, as he would say, be prudent. We'll not be
wanting to attract attention."</p>
<p>The others by similar arguments prevailed upon Mr Hay; they
wanted no disturbance such as that impetuous emissary seemed intent
upon provoking. Thus Colonel Walton was left to pace the garden
undisturbed. He was still pacing it, deep in thought, when, after
they had all departed, her ladyship went to seek him there.</p>
<p>She was disposed to be distant with him.</p>
<p>"I have to reproach you with being less than civil. What was
your reason? Was it even prudent in one who sets such store by
prudence?" Thus uncompromisingly she challenged him.</p>
<p>"I could not trust myself to have patience with them. Is a king
to be brought to his own again by vapourings? They're all of them
greedy for office and rewards when the King comes back. But what
will their indiscretions accomplish meanwhile? And then that
mincing fellow Hay, tricked out like a Frenchman, to take the eye
and advertise whence he comes at a time when every man from France
is regarded with suspicion. That such a messenger was chosen is of
a piece with the rest."</p>
<p>"And now you seem to be reproaching Ian. Surely you forget that
men are not readily found to carry dangerous messages. Mr Hay is an
old and valued friend of my brother's."</p>
<p>"Valued he may be: though, having seen and heard him, I can't
imagine on what grounds. But as for old, I'll take leave to assert
that when I left Saint Germains a year ago, this consequential
fribble had not been heard of. And whatever the age or value of the
friendship, where was the need to carry such a letter? So utterly
unnecessary a letter?"</p>
<p>The Colonel's irritation bewildered her by its apparent lack of
reason. It wore the aspect of petulance, the last fault she would
have suspected in him.</p>
<p>"It is necessary that we should know my brother's whereabouts.
How else are we to communicate with him?"</p>
<p>"The information could have come by word of mouth, like the
royal messages."</p>
<p>She began to lose patience. "But don't you see that the letter
served as an evidence of good faith to accredit the messenger."</p>
<p>Grudgingly he conceded the point; but he did not on that account
depart from his main contention. "In that case, it should have been
for yourself alone."</p>
<p>"The others have as good a title as Ito guarantees."</p>
<p>And now it was he who manifested impatience, vehemently "It is
too grave a secret to be held by so many."</p>
<p>"They are all loyal hearts, sir."</p>
<p>"Too cursed loyal!" He was bitter, to her further astonishment.
"Too notoriously loyal. All, saving perhaps Howard, are marked
Jacobites, and they come here day after day, for no better purpose
than to squeeze oranges, toast the King Over the Water, and rant
like barnstormers. Not even the significant postponement of King
William's sailing can restrain them. Do they suppose that this
government is asleep or besotted? Do they really imagine that these
constant comings and goings at Lochmore House have not brought you
under observation? Has Bentinck no spies? Do you suppose that he is
ignorant of the arrival in London of Mr Hay? Of whence he comes,
and whom he visits?"</p>
<p>"Mr Hay has been allowed to pass freely."</p>
<p>"Which proves the opposite of what you all so complacently
imagine. I tell you this, and no one has better cause to know it:
every arrival at, and departure from, Saint Germains is known to
Monsieur Bentinck almost as soon as it has taken place. Every man
who leaves there for England is marked and watched. Let that help
you to understand why the arrest of Mr Hay would have caused me
less uneasiness than the liberty he enjoys."</p>
<p>"You do not apply this argument to your own case. You came from
Saint Germains and do not seem to have been troubled by Monsieur
Bentinck."</p>
<p>"You forget, ma'am, that it was well known at the time why I
left France. I came home to take up a heritage, and so that I might
be free to enjoy it I moved with a circumspection unknown to these
hare-brains of yours. There is Claybourne proposing to send letters
into Wiltshire, which may well be intercepted. There is Howard
proposing to proselytize in the coffee-houses, as if all but
Jacobites are deaf. There was Glenleven picking a quarrel with me
whilst joined with me in such a task as this. If either of us had
been killed, whither would inquiry have led?" He made a gesture of
impatience. "I see no hope, no hope at all, for any undertaking
conducted in such folly. And is there nothing more than folly to be
feared? Loyal hearts, you say. Are you so sure that all are loyal?
Are you so sure that amongst the seven of us there is not a
betrayer?"</p>
<p>She recoiled in horrified amazement. "This is too much!" she
protested. "What are you saying?"</p>
<p>"I remind you of a possibility never absent from such
enterprises. Remember Prendergass."</p>
<p>"We have no Prendergass here."</p>
<p>"Can you be sure? Observe how history may be repeating itself.
Because of Prendergass&mdash;at heart a very staunch and loyal
adherent of King James&mdash;King William postponed his hunting. Is
it so remotely improbable that it is because of another
Prendergass, here amongst your friends, that King William has now
postponed his sailing? Postponed it indefinitely, although it is
something urgently necessary to his interests."</p>
<p>She laughed at this with undisguised scorn, and looked at him
almost with compassion. "I accounted you brave," she said
reproachfully.</p>
<p>"Do you know the difference, ma'am between courage and
rashness?"</p>
<p>But she let her thought pursue its course. "I accounted you so
brave. And you start at every shadow. You conjure ghosts out of
your fears. As I've said before, there may have been a dozen
reasons for postponement."</p>
<p>"Or there may have been just one: the one you will not admit.
You did not remark, I suppose, an odd coincidence; that the
postponement followed closely upon its being divulged here at your
house, that King William's going over to the Hague would be the
occasion for the attempt?"</p>
<p>"Oh yes. You always feared that. But if you are right, if we are
betrayed, how do we come to be still at large? Can you explain
that?"</p>
<p>"I can. Because Bentinck still lacked the information that would
enable him to lay hands upon your brother. Now, this precious piece
of information, so needlessly divulged, may be in his possession
to-morrow if one of us is faithless."</p>
<p>"Aye! If! But reassure yourself."</p>
<p>"By what? It is my settled view that the game is up; the risk
too great to be continued." And having shed now the last vestige of
his imperturbability, he fell to pleading passionately with her to
disband her associates and make her escape while it was yet time.
"When last I urged it, the danger, believe me, was nothing to what
it has now become."</p>
<p>Her face grew white as she listened, her eyes almost fierce.
"Yet you urged it passionately then. And nothing followed. Oh! This
is a coward's counsel."</p>
<p>"It may be." He strove to recover his calm. "It may be. But any
other leads to martyrdom. I suppose I have a vulgar mind. The
prospect of martyrdom does not exalt me."</p>
<p>She stared at him, her bosom heaving.</p>
<p>"I accounted you brave," she said again, on that same deeply
reproachful note. "You are the last living man from whom I should
have expected this."</p>
<p>"Because you know that I love you."</p>
<p>The sheer abruptness of that declaration at such a moment, in
the midst of an altercation, robbed her of breath, of colour, and
of speech.</p>
<p>He swept on.</p>
<p>"Because you think that a lover must express himself in terms of
knight-errantry, must talk and posture like a character in a
romance, making in his exaltation a mock of life and death. Well,
my lady, I am not such a lover. I have a vulgar mind, as I have
said. A practical mind. I blow no iridescent bubbles to fascinate
the eye and to be shivered against the first solid fact they touch.
I am real, my dear; real man and real lover."</p>
<p>His hand sought hers; and in her half-palsied state, her senses
dazed by the torrent of his oddly couched avowal, she made no
attempt to deny him. He leaned over her from his fine height.</p>
<p>"Will you trust me, Ailsa? Will you be guided by me?"</p>
<p>She swayed towards him, as if drawn by some magnetic force
within him. His arm went round her shoulders. Deeply stirred, an
unusual excitement trembling in his voice, he added yet another
question; "Will you come away with me? At once?"</p>
<p>That broke the spell he was weaving about her senses. "You are
resolved, then, to go?"</p>
<p>"Only if you come with me."</p>
<p>She drew her hand from his clasp, her self from his lightly
encircling arm. "You are mad to think it," she said, in a low, sad
voice.</p>
<p>"Not unless I am also mad to think that you love me."</p>
<p>"Ian waits at Calais. Have you forgot?" It was as if she had not
heard him.</p>
<p>"It is in my intentions that we go to him. It may be the best
way to serve him now."</p>
<p>"And he would thank us for that service?" She shook her head, a
bitter little smile on her sensitive lips. "If you know Ian at all,
you know what he would say; and I know how right he would be to say
it. No, no. Depart if your heart fails you. I remain with those who
trust me, and for him who trusts me."</p>
<p>He looked at her with gloomy eyes for a long moment, reading the
resolve that made her white face so stern. Then he sighed, and on
that sigh the clouds lifted from his brow, and a faint smile broke
from his lips. They were signs of relief, she thought, to her
infinite surprise.</p>
<p>"Be it so," he said. "Perhaps it is better thus. For your sake,
and out of my fears for you I was prepared to decamp, and so
neglect what is scarcely less than a duty. But since you will not
yield, it follows that I must stay for what remains to be
accomplished."</p>
<p>They parted without further word of love between them, and
Colonel Walton, leaving her bewildered and confused, went home to
his lodging in Covent Garden.</p>
<p>To the sleek valet whom he found dutifully awaiting him, his
first words brought hope.</p>
<p>"Dubois is still at Blackwall with the cutter?"</p>
<p>Lavernis' countenance brightened. "But, of course, my Colonel.
We depart then? We go to France?"</p>
<p>"You do," said the Colonel dryly. "Be ready to set out in half
an hour."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-20" id="ch-20"></a>Chapter 20. Betrayal</h2>
<p>Five days later, on the following Sunday, the 8th of June, the
plotters were again assembled in the library at Lochmore House, and
more than ever disposed, in view of their continued immunity from
arrest, to be scornful of Colonel Walton and his prognostications
of a thunderbolt which had failed to fall.</p>
<p>In that dark-panelled and book-lined room, whose windows looked
out over the garden and the river beyond it, they waited for Mr
Hay, at whose urgent request they had hurriedly been brought
together.</p>
<p>He arrived at last. He came in with the abrupt violence of a
breaking hurricane. He was out of breath, very pale, and rather
wild of eye. Having made his gusty entrance, he paused on the
threshold, glaring at the company.</p>
<p>"We are all present, I see," he said at last. "That, at least,
is something."</p>
<p>On that he swung about, slammed the door, turned the key in the
lock, withdrew it, swung about again, and struck an attitude.</p>
<p>"Who laughed?" he demanded fiercely</p>
<p>"Faith, I did," said Colonel Walton, who sat with his back to
the light beside Lady Lochmore, at the head of the long table of
dark oak.</p>
<p>"And at what, if you please?"</p>
<p>"From pure relish. I delight in the grand manner, the broad
gesture."</p>
<p>Someone else laughed with him now. Richard Hay grew pale with
anger.</p>
<p>"Sirs, it is not the time for buffoonery, and I have little hope
of being able to continue to amuse you." Dramatically, with an arm
outflung, he cast his news at them.</p>
<p>"There is a spy amongst us. Someone here is a spy."</p>
<p>"Fiddlesticks!" said O'Grady, with a cackling laugh of
contempt.</p>
<p>But he laughed alone. The assertion was too grave even for
sarcasm.</p>
<p>"Damn your play-acting, Hay." The exclamation came from the
matter-of-fact Howard. "Such a thing is unimaginable."</p>
<p>"As unimaginable as you please. But, nevertheless, true. So true
that no one leaves the room until this spy is discovered."</p>
<p>"Damme!" swore Dalkeith. "You take a deal upon yourself, Mr
Hay."</p>
<p>Stuart of Meorach turned irritably upon the speaker. He was a
shrewd, practical man. "He's in the right of it, by God! If he has
evidence of what he says."</p>
<p>"Aye! If he has evidence," sneered the sinister O'Grady.</p>
<p>Mr Hay snorted. "Oh, all the evidence you'll need, sirs."</p>
<p>Glenleven, who had sat very still and watchful of the company,
stirred now impatiently "Well, well! What is this evidence?"</p>
<p>"This," said Mr Hay "Two nights ago the Auberge du Soleil at
Calais was raided by a party of six English bullies, who demanded
the person of Mr Richard Jerningham..."</p>
<p>He was interrupted there by an outcry of alarm from Lady
Lochmore. The announcement had brought her suddenly to her
feet.</p>
<p>"No, no, madam," Mr Hay made haste to reassure her. "They did
not find him. By incredible luck, he had gone. By a miracle, as it
seems to me&mdash;for I see no explanation for it&mdash;he had left
Calais six hours before."</p>
<p>Still trembling she sank down again into her chair, and sat
tensely attentive.</p>
<p>Mr Hay resumed, his manner one of suppressed fury</p>
<p>"But that they sought him is enough. No one in England knew that
he was there, or by what name he called himself, save only you
seven and her ladyship, to whom I made it known a week ago."</p>
<p>Colonel Walton made an interpolation. "You may judge now, sirs,
and you, my lady, whether you were justified of your resentment
when I condemned that communication as unnecessary and unwise."</p>
<p>Glenleven brushed the interpolation aside. There was a sudden
feverishness in his manner. "Yes, yes. But what's that to the
matter now. Your tale, Hay? What is your tale? What do you know of
these men? These bullies?"</p>
<p>"What I've told you. Isn't that enough? Do their damned names
matter? They were English; they landed at Calais from an English
ship&mdash;a swift cutter, I am informed, that waited to take them
off again."</p>
<p>"That'll be conclusive," said Sir Hamish in the tone of one who
is about to engage. He looked round, as if seeking for someone upon
whom to fasten his challenge.</p>
<p>Her ladyship, however, was less easily satisfied.</p>
<p>"Whence is your information, Mr Hay?"</p>
<p>"Two hours ago I received a message from a friend whom I left to
watch in Calais, to act as a messenger in case of need. In the
present circumstances," he added with elaborate scorn, "ye'll not
account it odd in me to withhold his name."</p>
<p>He advanced, at last, from his station by the door, his dark
eyes raking the company from under the thundercloud on his brow.
"Our necks, gentlemen, are not safe until we find this spy."</p>
<p>"Will they be safe then?" wondered the Colonel.</p>
<p>"Maybe not," snapped Hay. "Most probably we are already betrayed
and doomed."</p>
<p>Little Howard sighed audibly "Indeed, he who could tell the
government so much, would be likely to tell enough to hang us
all."</p>
<p>Colonel Walton looked wistfully into her ladyship's sad eyes.
"You see," he said softly.</p>
<p>Glenleven, overhearing the two words, suddenly reared his head.
"See what, sir? To what do you allude?"</p>
<p>"To my warning of this to her ladyship on Tuesday last."</p>
<p>Glenleven leaned forward, his face grey, his eyes gleaming with
a stern malevolence. "Ah, yes," he said. "To be sure!" Then, with
singular slow emphasis, he asked: "What was the knowledge that made
you a prophet, sir?"</p>
<p>His tone, so heavily laden with suspicion that already it
sounded like an accusation, startled her ladyship into intervening.
"What are you implying, Jamie?"</p>
<p>"Colonel Walton understands me, I think. Let him answer my
question."</p>
<p>The Colonel was not the only one who understood. He found all
eyes suddenly and darkly upon him. He shrugged, indifferent. "I
gave her ladyship at the time my reasons for the assumption. They
were much as I had given earlier to you all. I pointed to the
indiscretions that must sooner or later betray this foolery."</p>
<p>That brought Glenleven to his feet in anger, whilst Sir Hamish
roared out: "Is foolery the best you can call this sacred
enterprise of ours?"</p>
<p>"What I call it I told you when first I came amongst you. I call
it murder. The foolery lies in the manner in which you go about
it."</p>
<p>Mr Hay's impatience created a momentary diversion. "You talk and
talk," he protested. "But nothing to the point."</p>
<p>"Aye. That's usual here," said Colonel Walton.</p>
<p>"Something to the point, I think," was Glenleven's dark reply,
which ignored the sarcasm. He looked about him significantly, a
plain invitation in his glance. "Need we seek further for our
spy?"</p>
<p>There was a pause. The company sat aghast until her ladyship
rose again, one hand on the chair-back to steady her, the other
mechanically repressing the tumult of her bosom.</p>
<p>"Where do you find him, Jamie?"</p>
<p>"Where I should have sought him sooner had I obeyed my
instincts. Oh, I own my simplicity, my guilt. Partly he fooled me
by his pretence of generosity, and partly I fooled myself by my
reluctance to admit that I had brought a traitor amongst us."</p>
<p>"Does the malice you bear him make you mad, Jamie?" she asked,
her glance going to the arm he still carried in a sling.</p>
<p>A smile of disdain crossed his pallid face. "It is natural that
you should have faith in your lover."</p>
<p>"My lover!" She threw up her head sharply, defiant of the
general stir.</p>
<p>"Do you deny what we have all perceived? That he is your lover?
That he has made love to you?"</p>
<p>She had no thought of denying it. "And that proves him a spy?"
Her scorn was withering. "You reason nobly, Jamie."</p>
<p>"No. Not nobly. Shrewdly. Because he is your lover, he warns
you, as he says: he seeks to abstract you from an enterprise which
he knows is doomed. Does not that convict him? Whence came his
knowledge?"</p>
<p>"Whence?" She paused, at a loss, suddenly stricken by the
terrible logic of Glenleven's reasoning. She turned to Colonel
Walton, who sat there so quietly, the only one who retained his
calm, the ghost of a smile even hovering upon his lips.</p>
<p>"Answer him. Oh answer him!"</p>
<p>He knew from the blend of pain and fear in her voice that she
was asking him not only to answer his accuser, but to answer the
sudden, dreadful doubt the accusation had sown in her own mind.</p>
<p>"Was the knowledge so far to seek?" he asked. "Would not the
simplest reasoning discover it? I knew the thing was doomed because
I knew that which you have only just discovered: that there is a
betrayer amongst us."</p>
<p>"And, by God," cried Dalkeith, "you had cause to know it."</p>
<p>"Here's brazen impudence," thundered Sir Hamish in fury.</p>
<p>And then Mr Hay, almost sinister, despite his fripperies, and
very grim of tone, intervened curtly "It is enough for me. The
garden, I think." He tapped his sword-hilt significantly "Let the
honour be mine."</p>
<p>Glenleven shook his head, and with his sound hand caught Mr</p>
<p>Hay by the arm. He had experience of the Colonel's skill. "We'll
have no sword-play. We give no chances to spies. But the garden
certainly."</p>
<p>Lord Claybourne, however, checked the beginnings of a general
movement of aggression towards the Colonel. "Sirs, sirs! Let us
consider well what we do." His normal urbanity was almost turned to
dolefulness.</p>
<p>"What's left to consider?" wondered the stormy Dalkeith.</p>
<p>And but for the cool intrepidity of the Colonel's bearing, which
acted as a more potent check upon them than the intervention of
Lord Claybourne, it is probable that the attack would not have been
stayed. He had made no shift even to rise. He sat back in his
chair, without so much as troubling to uncross his legs, and the
disdain in his glance, and in his tone now as he spoke, were as a
rampart about his person.</p>
<p>"You are consistent, sirs, at least in your rashness. What's to
consider, asks Harry Dalkeith. You might consider, for instance,
whether some form of trial should not precede execution. Or is it
that you are so in love with assassination that you must recklessly
be practising it on every opportunity?"</p>
<p>He paused there, unabashed under the angry eyes of those men,
whose impetuosity he curbed, momentarily, at least, by his cold
contemptuous questions. He turned now more particularly to
Glenleven.</p>
<p>"You build a specious accusation, sir, upon hollow suspicion,
ill-digested assumption, and blundering inferences, which could
carry conviction to none but a pack of fools turned craven by the
fear of discovery."</p>
<p>They growled at him for this. But he went on undeterred.</p>
<p>"Ask yourselves before it is too late whether this light and
easy assumption of my guilt may not, indeed, consummate your ruin,
by leaving the real traitor amongst you undiscovered."</p>
<p>That made a perceptible impression. It left them hesitating,
looking at one another now with such doubt in their glances as to
show the Colonel how fully he had been understood; how in asking
them, for their own sakes, to review their conviction of his guilt,
he had made each man suspicious of his neighbour.</p>
<p>And then Claybourne, who so far had said little, and whose voice
carried weight, having, in their view, royal authority behind it,
expressed the doubt that had suddenly been planted in the minds of
all.</p>
<p>"It is possible that we are being hasty. After all, appearances
can be deceptive. It is possible&mdash;just possible&mdash;that, as
Colonel Walton says, by too lightly fastening the guilt upon him,
we may allow the real culprit to escape."</p>
<p>As if accepting the hint in Lord Claybourne's words, Dalkeith
assumed a forensic manner.</p>
<p>"You have said, Colonel Walton, that you knew five days ago that
there was a spy amongst us."</p>
<p>"I should perhaps have said that I suspected it," the Colonel
corrected himself.</p>
<p>"You had grounds for that suspicion?"</p>
<p>"Is it usual to suspect without grounds?"</p>
<p>"What were your grounds?" came sharply from Glenleven.</p>
<p>The Colonel did not immediately answer. He appeared to be
considering and his grey eyes played over the company before him
like points of steel.</p>
<p>"I should prefer to withhold them yet awhile," he said, at last.
"I am still too much in the position of an accused to turn
accuser."</p>
<p>"A poor subterfuge," said Sir Hamish.</p>
<p>The Colonel pondered him gravely "Oh, yes, admittedly a
subterfuge. But not quite the kind you deem it."</p>
<p>"On my soul," cried the impetuous Mr Hay from the foot of the
table, "you'll let the fellow talk you out of your wits."</p>
<p>"Och, now, and hasn't he done it already?" cried O'Grady "Ye're
easily bubbled, gentlemen, if you let such balderdash impose upon
you."</p>
<p>"And so far, you will observe," Glenleven coldly pointed out,
"nothing that he has said denies the accusation."</p>
<p>This brought again an impatient almost an anguished remonstrance
from her ladyship. "Oh, why don't you give them the plain lie,
Colonel Walton?"</p>
<p>"Have patience," he begged her. "Patience and a little
faith."</p>
<p>"The patience will come easier than the faith," sneered
Glenleven. "Come, sir! You trifle with us."</p>
<p>The exclamation must have found a ready echo in those rash
minds, for now the storm that had momentarily been stayed, broke
forth again, led by the histrionic Mr Hay.</p>
<p>"To the garden with him! Let us have done."</p>
<p>Stuart of Meorach, his gooseberry eyes protruding beyond their
wont on his plump face, laid a hand upon his hilt. "You're entirely
right, Hay. There has been enough of this. Too much, indeed.
Outside, sir, if you please."</p>
<p>Howard added something to the same effect, whilst young Dalkeith
strode across to fling open the French windows; and they might have
swept matters there and then to a conclusion, despite her
ladyship's almost frantic attempt to restrain them, if it had not
still been for the dominating calm of the Colonel's own
demeanour.</p>
<p>He rose without haste or visible perturbation.</p>
<p>"Give me a little moment yet before you murder me," he
requested, so courteously that he seemed to mock them. "There is
still something I can tell you that may completely change your
opinion of me. Hear me an instant."</p>
<p>He dominated them by that incredible composure, almost
formidable in the face of such a situation.</p>
<p>"Be brief, then," Sir Hamish admonished him. "Our patience is at
an end."</p>
<p>"It shall not be tried much further. Mr Hay spoke of the
incredible luck of Ian Macdonald in having been away from Calais at
the time of the raid. He described it as a miracle, I think. If I
could show you, prove to you, that this miracle was of my
contriving, would you account it evidence that I am no
traitor?"</p>
<p>Upon the utter silence of amazement following this question beat
her ladyship's voice, strained and incredulous. And incredulous,
too, was her frowning glance.</p>
<p>"You contrived it? You?"</p>
<p>And from Glenleven came another question, incisively pertinent.
"How did you contrive it?"</p>
<p>"I sent word to Invernaion that an attempt would be made to
seize him."</p>
<p>"You sent him word?" cried her ladyship, her voice slow with
unbelief. And again there was Glenleven, his white face distorted
by anger, savagely following up her question. "Why should you have
sent him word? How did you know, how could you know that this
attempt would be made?"</p>
<p>Dalkeith laughed scornfully, and O'Grady, grim and sardonic,
interjected: "Aye! Answer that, now."</p>
<p>"Haven't I told you that I had concluded there was a spy amongst
you? And wouldn't his object here, next to the discovery of the
plot itself, be to discover and betray the whereabouts of
Invernaion?"</p>
<p>Claybourne took up the questioning. "You say you sent him word."
This time, however, his usual suavity failed him. He spoke in the
harshly contemptuous tone of one who for the sake of form pursues a
trail that he knows to be false. "How did you send it?"</p>
<p>"By my servant Lavernis. I dispatched him to Calais on Tuesday
night, as soon as I had left here, after hearing Mr Hay's message.
Lavernis arrived in Calais twenty-four hours ahead of the
government agents. He carried a letter from me which contained the
warning that sent Invernaion on his travels. By my instructions
Lavernis stayed to see what might happen. He witnessed the raid on
the Auberge du Soleil by Monsieur Bentinck's men&mdash;there were
six of them, landed from an English vessel, as Mr Hay has told
you&mdash;and he arrived back here last night."</p>
<p>"That was prompt travelling." Claybourne spoke in the same tone
of scornful unbelief. "How did he come to accomplish it? By what
resources?"</p>
<p>"I have a cutter at my orders, a little way down the river, with
a mixed crew, most of them smugglers ordinarily, but at present in
my pay."</p>
<p>It seemed to them all then that he was recklessly piling
falsehood upon falsehood in the desperate hope of duping them. But
of all the incredible things he had told them in the last few
minutes, this tale of a ship and crew in his pay was quite the most
incredible.</p>
<p>They stood in gaping silence under those cold eyes of his, which
shifted from face to face in constant, watchful scrutiny. That
Colonel Walton, in the circumstances to which it was known that
gaming had reduced him, should assert that he kept a cutter at his
charges was fantastic. It was to push mendacity beyond all
plausible limits.</p>
<p>"By God!" said O'Grady in sheer wonder, "if ye suppose we'll be
swallowing that, then, saving her ladyship's presence, ye're as big
a fool as Muldoon's calf, that ran a mile to suck a bull."</p>
<p>"That expresses it," Glenleven agreed. "The knave is lying.
Lying impudently."</p>
<p>The Colonel's glance, passing over the Major, came to settle
upon his lordship.</p>
<p>"Knave, eh?" he said. "Knave and liar. We'll leave the knave for
the moment. But as for the liar, it happens that I have evidence
under my hand to prove my words."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-21" id="ch-21"></a>Chapter 21. The Trap</h2>
<p>Under the wondering eyes of the company Colonel Walton ripped
away the bullion which edged his baldrick and served to hold
together the two strips of fine leather that composed it. As these
now gaped apart, he took from between them a folded sheet of paper.
This paper he unfolded, and then paused, considering the faces
before him, like a man who is making choice.</p>
<p>At last, speaking slowly, "Whoever here is dishonest," he said,
"it cannot, I think, be you, Lord Claybourne."</p>
<p>"I am obliged to you, sir, for the compliment," said his
lordship, not without suspicion of sarcasm.</p>
<p>"Also you hold in this company a position which gives you the
right to my preference." He leaned forward, and proffered the
unfolded sheet. "This should help you, my lord, to attach faith to
my word."</p>
<p>Frowning his perplexity, Claybourne advanced a step, and took
the paper slowly. Glenleven and Dalkeith moved forward also, to
scan it with him, but suddenly found a barrier in Walton's
outstretched arm.</p>
<p>"For the moment, if you please, it is for Lord Claybourne's eyes
alone." The Colonel's tone was peremptory.</p>
<p>Dalkeith shrugged.</p>
<p>"Why this?" asked her ladyship. And Glenleven, his eyes hard,
looked as if he would use insistence, when a sudden exclamation
from Lord Claybourne drew the attention of them all.</p>
<p>His lordship held the sheet in a hand that had begun to tremble,
and there was a deep frown of perplexity between eyes that in their
intentness seemed to bulge as they read. He walked away towards the
window, as if to scan the writing in the stronger light. When,
presently, he turned again, his face was blank with amazement,
almost with awe; and he addressed Colonel Walton on a note that was
entirely new, a note unmistakably of deference.</p>
<p>"But why, sir, did you not..."</p>
<p>Colonel Walton interrupted him. And into his voice, too, a
change had come. It was invested now with a clear tone of
authority.</p>
<p>"No more on that at the moment, sir." Quietly but with a firm
assurance, he recovered the paper from his lordship's hands, folded
it, put it into his pocket.</p>
<p>"If you are now, my lord, as I hope you are, persuaded that what
I have said is true, and that whoever is the spy&mdash;and a spy is
certainly present&mdash;I am not likely to be the man, perhaps you
will give the company that assurance, so that no more precious time
may be wasted."</p>
<p>"I do so. Unhesitatingly." His lordship was emphatic. "I will
beg you, sirs, to take my word for that." His manner suggested that
he flung down a gage of battle to any man who still questioned
Colonel Walton's probity.</p>
<p>Glenleven was the only one who declined to be impressed. He
stood scowling, irritated by the exclusion from this secret of a
person so important as himself.</p>
<p>"What's this?" he demanded. "Where is the need for mystery? If
that paper is evidence of anything, isn't it evidence for us
all?"</p>
<p>Colonel Walton considered him with an exasperating calm.</p>
<p>"Why so it shall be. Presently. First, however, I have other
evidence for you, free to you all; that of my servant Lavernis. I
have brought him with me. He waits here, in the servants' hall, to
give you his own account of his voyage to Calais, and to be
questioned by you, so that you may test the truth of what he tells
you, and of what I have told you."</p>
<p>Her ladyship intervened. "But is so much still necessary since
my Lord Claybourne..."</p>
<p>"Most necessary," snapped Glenleven with a discourtesy that set
them staring. "I take no man's word, no man's judgment of evidence
that I have not examined for myself." It was plain from his glance
and gesture that he alluded to the paper Claybourne had
scrutinized. It was plain also how deeply anger moved him. The hand
he had flung out was seen to shake.</p>
<p>Colonel Walton observing him closely, if with apparent languor,
smiled faintly upon this white heat.</p>
<p>"I cannot blame you, my lord, for practising, in some respects
at least, the virtue of prudence. But you shall be satisfied. Rest
assured of that. Fully satisfied." He turned to the company
generally "When you shall have questioned my servant and heard his
answers, you will have learnt all that you could desire to know."
He made a slight pause, and then added: "Not only will the
particular treachery that has been practised here be clear to you
beyond all doubt, but you should be assisted in the discovery of
the identity of our betrayer&mdash;of the man who must not be
suffered to leave this house alive. It has been said, I think, that
there is no Prendergass here. And that, at least remains true,
unless I am greatly at fault. Prendergass was an honest man who
betrayed from motives of conscience. Our betrayer will be found, I
believe, to be just a Judas who sells his master. At least, that is
my surmise. But you should be able to form your own conclusions
after you have questioned Lavernis." He paused there again, and his
eyes, hard and stern, passed slowly from one to another of those
startled faces. Then he resumed his seat.</p>
<p>"Let someone fetch my servant."</p>
<p>Glenleven was the only one who offered to run that errand; and
he offered promptly.</p>
<p>"I'll go, myself," he announced, and on the words was turning
towards the door. In his haste he almost stumbled. It was an
unnecessary haste, for, as the Colonel observed, none of the others
sought to dispute with him the office he assumed.</p>
<p>Finding the door locked, he turned impatiently "The key, Mr
Hay."</p>
<p>He held out a hand that still trembled visibly from the fury
shaking him.</p>
<p>Hay, who, like the others, had been reduced to limp
bewilderment, fumbled a moment in his pocket for the key, produced
it, and surrendered it. Irritably Glenleven snatched it from him.
Using his left hand, he blundered with it a moment at the lock;
then, having succeeded in turning it, was gone, slamming the door
after him.</p>
<p>"So!" said the Colonel, and laughed very softly "So!"</p>
<p>He was instantly to his feet and moving swiftly down the room to
the French windows that opened upon the garden. He flung them wide;
then he turned again, and spoke with brisk authority.</p>
<p>"Sirs, if you are to assure the safety of your necks, I have a
shrewd notion that your presence is very urgently required in the
courtyard. It is life or death for you, gentlemen. I beg that you
will follow me." And he added more lightly, "I think that I shall
have something interesting to show you."</p>
<p>Claybourne in promptest obedience was at his side almost before
he had finished speaking. Thence, to confirm him, his lordship
flung a sharp word of command over his shoulder that brought the
pack after him in blind alacrity.</p>
<p>To her ladyship's startled eyes they seemed to tumble from the
room in their precipitancy.</p>
<p>She followed to the window; but no farther. Thence she saw them
racing at the Colonel's heels along the flank of the house, to
vanish round the angle of its facade.</p>
<p>They were no more than in time to behold what Colonel Walton
counted upon finding there.</p>
<p>As they swung into the flagged courtyard before the mansion,
they had a view of my Lord Glenleven, hatless, taking the six steps
from the door at a single, perilous leap, and racing for the
gateway.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the first thoughts of those gentlemen at
sight of this portent, to O'Grady it seems to have presented no
riddle. This at least is the conclusion to be drawn from the
view-holloa he loosed after an instant's gasping pause.</p>
<p>"Tally-ho!" He charged forward furiously at the Colonel's heels.
"Yoicks! Yoicks! Tally-ho!"</p>
<p>Had not the tall wrought-iron gates been closed, Glenleven must
have gained the Strand before they could reach him, and things
might have been more difficult. As it was, whilst his left hand
fumbled clumsily with the latch, the Colonel was upon him, pulling
him back, so that the others might surround him.</p>
<p>Wayfarers in the Strand paused to peer through the railings,
wondering what novel madcap game was this that was being played in
the courtyard of Lochmore House by gentlemen in laced coats and
periwigs.</p>
<p>"It's meat for hounds ye are, ye mangy fox!" O'Grady saluted the
Viscount with his ugly laugh.</p>
<p>"Whither away in such haste, Glenleven?" was Stuart's fierce
demand, his powerful hand on the captive's shoulder.</p>
<p>Colonel Walton, squarely before him, was smiling grimly into his
lordship's eyes. "Faith, I'm much obliged to you, my lord. Will you
come back with us?"</p>
<p>"And explain yourself?" Claybourne added sternly.</p>
<p>There was a snarl of despair on Glenleven's grey face; his eyes
glared like those of a trapped beast into the incredulously angry
countenances about him. Instinct drove him to attempt to draw his
sword with his left hand. But the press about him was too close to
give him elbowroom; and whilst he struggled someone deprived him of
sword and sword-belt.</p>
<p>It may have been in his mind to call to those inquisitive
passersby in the Strand for assistance, to raise a cry of treason
and murder that might bring a rescue. But the Colonel was too
prompt and expert. Glenleven's periwig was pulled over his face to
blind and half-choke him. Lifted helplessly off his feet he was
borne swiftly up the steps, across the hall, down a corridor to the
rear of the house, and so back into the room he had so lately
quitted, where her bewildered ladyship waited.</p>
<p>Seeing him brought in forcibly, and in such disarray, she cried
out to know the reason.</p>
<p>Colonel Walton explained to her that which already had explained
itself to all those who had shared the swift brief hunt with
him.</p>
<p>"It's just that his lordship must have misunderstood me. He
can't have heard me say that Lavernis was in the servants' hall, or
else he knew that I was lying when I said it, as, indeed, I was.
That was a little trap I set. It occurred to me that our traitor,
perceiving that the game was lost, would disclose himself by his
eagerness to respond to my request that someone should fetch my
servant. It would supply him with the pretext he so urgently needed
to escape from a house that had suddenly become very dangerous to
him.</p>
<p>"My Lord Glenleven, ma'am, had no thought for my servant. We
only just caught him at the gate, going in such haste that he had
not even stayed to get his hat."</p>
<p>She understood, as those had understood who had witnessed that
self-betraying flight, and understanding she stood there, a pale
incarnation of conflicting horror and unbelief. When at last she
could find words, it was only to express the unbelief which had
conquered horror. "Oh, but this is mad! Impossible!
Impossible!"</p>
<p>"Merely incredible," said the Colonel, and as she looked at the
set faces of the other five, she saw that every man of them shared
the Colonel's conviction.</p>
<p>Nor was there in Glenleven's aspect anything to contradict them.
They had pulled the blond wig from his face, and thrust him into a
chair, where he sat now, limp and panting, his face mottled, terror
in his eyes, disorder in his clothes from the rough handling he had
received.</p>
<p>The young Countess drew a step nearer to him. "Jamie! What does
it mean?" There was anguish in her voice.</p>
<p>The instinct to bluster asserted itself in him. "Do I know what
it means? Best ask these fools. Best warn them, too, to have a care
how far they carry their damned idiocy."</p>
<p>Major O'Grady standing over him laughed grimly at the threat.
Sir Hamish on the other side heaped contumely upon him.</p>
<p>"You villain! You damned, smooth, slimy villain! And you a
Macdonald!"</p>
<p>This inspired O'Grady to emulation. His nut-cracker face
inflamed, he leaned over, shaking a fist within an inch of his
lordship's nose.</p>
<p>"Ye foul spawn of Iscariot! I can scarce believe it even now, ye
white-faced omadhaun. I'ld as soon have believed it of myself, so I
would."</p>
<p>"It's just incredible, stab me!" said the willowy Dalkeith, and
sighed dejectedly.</p>
<p>And then Glenleven roused himself to a fiercer passion. "If it's
incredible, you numskulls, why do you credit it? Don't you see that
this rogue..."</p>
<p>Claybourne interrupted him sternly "Tell us whither you were
going in such hot haste. If you don't want us to believe you a
villain, tell us that."</p>
<p>"I'll tell you something else that is to the point. This man
here, this rogue who is leading you all by the nose, so as to avert
suspicion from himself, has been petitioning Lord Portland for
employment ever since he came to England, over a year ago, and to
my certain knowledge Portland has given him employment. Employment
to come here and spy upon us and betray us. There's our betrayer.
There's Portland's spy. There! Ask him. Let him deny that, if he
can. You ask me where I went. I went to fetch you the proof of that
before it was too late."</p>
<p>"Again I am much obliged to your lordship," said the Colonel
quietly "You make things clear and easy." He looked round with the
utmost composure. "It is quite true that he says: that I am so
employed by Monsieur Bentinck. I will explain that presently.
Meanwhile, let him now tell you how he knows it."</p>
<p>"How I know it?" screamed Glenleven. "I know it..." He caught
his breath. "I know it," he ended doggedly.</p>
<p>"So much is plain, since you stated it. What I am asking you is
how you know it," the Colonel insisted, his glittering eye upon the
Viscount's white, tortured face.</p>
<p>"My God! Am I to be questioned by you? By a spy! You've all
heard him admit it. Because he knows it would be futile to deny it.
You've heard him admit it. That he is Bentinck's jackal. And you do
nothing!"</p>
<p>Claybourne interposed his large figure. "Enough of this ranting,
Glenleven. Whither were you going in such haste? Answer that."</p>
<p>"I've answered it. Be damned to you!"</p>
<p>But Claybourne insisted.</p>
<p>"You said something of fetching proofs. What proofs,
Glenleven?"</p>
<p>The trapped man glared impotent fury and impotent fear.
Invention failed him. Again bluster was his only resource.</p>
<p>"I deny your right to question me. I am not on my trial. You may
assume what you please, you fools. You fools!"</p>
<p>Lady Lochmore advanced again until she came to stand immediately
before him.</p>
<p>"Will you tell me, Jamie, why you did this?" she asked him in a
voice of ice. "Why should you, of all men, have been our
betrayer?"</p>
<p>In the silence that was held for him he just scowled at her
without answering. At last his eyes fell away, under her clear,
stern gaze.</p>
<p>"Lord in Heaven!" she cried. "Have you nothing to say? Nothing?
Ian saved your life. At his own great peril, with a price upon his
head, he came here to London to rescue you. It cannot have been his
ruin that you sought. Was it mine, Jamie? Was this your revenge on
me?"</p>
<p>She questioned him on something she could understand and even
perhaps forgive. So much was to be read in her tone, which suddenly
had become almost pleading. But he sat there sullenly silent now, a
figure half-tragic, half-ridiculous, with his periwig awry above
his white, narrow face.</p>
<p>Colonel Walton undertook to answer for him. At her ladyship's
elbow, he spoke quietly.</p>
<p>"He did it, I think, for the same reason that he conceived this
plot against the life of William of Orange. So that he might entrap
your brother and deliver him to a government that has placed a
price upon his head."</p>
<p>"That's a foul invention," cried Glenleven, and would have
risen, but that O'Grady and Stuart between them forced him down
again into his chair.</p>
<p>Lady Lochmore paid no heed to his denial. She had swung round to
stare at Colonel Walton, a wildness in her dark blue eyes, an
anguish disordering her white beauty.</p>
<p>Her voice choked a little as she challenged him.</p>
<p>"Colonel Walton, who are you? What are you? What is your part in
this?"</p>
<p>The Colonel bowed his head. "I think it is time I told you," he
said.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a>Chapter 22. The Accredited
Agent</h2>
<p>At Colonel Walton's request, all were seated save O'Grady and
Sir Hamish Stuart, who remained on guard over the limp, huddled
figure of Glenleven. Her ladyship had gone back to her chair at the
head of the table, and she sat there, stiff and straight, her white
hands gripping the arms of it. The others had disposed themselves
about one side of it so as to face the Colonel, who from the hearth
commanded the assembly.</p>
<p>A sustained and absolute calm of manner can in itself be
negatively and very effectively offensive, by the utter lack of
deference which it implies. This, as you know, had been the
demeanour that had marked the Colonel in his dealings with these
plotters in the past. Now it was subtly changed. And the change was
for the worse.</p>
<p>As he stood there, tall and commanding, his aspect was stern to
the point of being forbidding.</p>
<p>"First," he said, "my Lord Claybourne shall answer your
ladyship's question as to what I am."</p>
<p>Claybourne, inclining his head as if in acknowledgment of a
command, was prompt to obey "Colonel Walton," he said, "is the
accredited agent of King James to his loyal subjects in England.
The paper which you saw him show me is a letter to him in His
Majesty's own hand. It is virtually Colonel Walton's commission to
represent His Majesty here, and it exhorts all those who are still
His Majesty's loyal subjects and whose assistance Colonel Walton
may require on His Majesty's behalf, to render it as they would
render it to the King himself."</p>
<p>He ceased. Round eyes of men whose very breathing seemed
suspended in astonishment, stared at him, and from him, almost in
awe, to the impassive Colonel, whom an hour ago they had clamoured
to put to death as a spy.</p>
<p>Dudley Walton came forward, drew the letter from his pocket, and
laid it on the table.</p>
<p>"You will all understand now why this could not be disclosed
until I had sprung my little trap to catch the traitor. The letter
is there for your inspection."</p>
<p>Whilst they conned it with respect and interest, he returned to
the hearth, and once more put his shoulders to the overmantel.</p>
<p>"That accounts for me, but not entirely. I owe this commission
partly to the confidence His Majesty does me the honour to repose
in me; but quite as much to the fact that at a time when His
Majesty urgently required an agent here to investigate the feeling
of the country, I very opportunely inherited a small estate in
Wiltshire.</p>
<p>"You may or you may not know, sirs, that Monsieur Bentinck is so
well served by spies at Saint Germains that every arrival and
departure there is promptly reported here. In my own case, my
Wiltshire inheritance supplied a plausible reason for my return to
England; and the natural desire to enjoy the inheritance supplied a
no less plausible reason for an anxiety on my part to make my peace
with King William's government. To make quite sure that no
suspicion should attach to me, I departed from Saint Germains
universally despised as a venal deserter of the cause. This would
not fail to be reported to Bentinck.</p>
<p>"To consolidate my position I offered, immediately on arrival,
my services to the existing government, well knowing that they
would not be accepted. That was not the only fraud I practised.
That I speedily broke myself at play was another pretence,
necessary so as to explain the early sale of my little heritage and
my subsequent wanderings.</p>
<p>"On my return to London, six weeks ago, I renewed my offer of
services to King William, so as to provide myself, in the certain
event of refusal, with such a pretext for departure from England as
should leave no obstacle to my coming back again if it became
necessary.</p>
<p>"I shall return to this.</p>
<p>"The presence of an agent here at the time, to make the tour of
England which I made, was rendered necessary by the failure of the
enterprise which has come to be known as the Assassination Plot,
but in the assassination part of which, I, for one, am not to be
persuaded that His Majesty had any hand or wish.</p>
<p>"To shelter themselves from the consternation and horror
following upon the discovery of that plot, all Jacobites had gone
to ground. It was become impossible to compute how many of these
could be depended upon to come forth again when and if King Louis
should send over an army. My task was the difficult one of
investigating this at close quarters. Hence all the elaborate
precautions which I took.</p>
<p>"I will say only that the hopes in which I came found no
smallest encouragement. Loyalty I discovered in plenty; but the
courage to express it, to stake all upon a throw, in short, to take
up arms against the usurper is, as I told you when first I came
amongst you, everywhere absent at this present time, utterly
stifled by the discovery of the plot of two years ago. Later on I
do not doubt that this courage will revive; especially if the
present government should give rise to discontent, and provided
that in the meantime there are no more assassination plots to
discredit King James and arouse even Tory sympathy for King
William."</p>
<p>He paused again, to allow those last, sternly-spoken words to
sink into the hearts of his audience.</p>
<p>"My task here was done. I was on the point of returning to
France to make my disheartening report to His Majesty when Lord
Glenleven informed me of the existence of this plot of yours, and
invited me to join it."</p>
<p>His delivery became now more slow and distinct than ever.</p>
<p>"If I had done my duty, I should at once have disclosed my
commission to Glenleven and used my authority under it to exact
from him the nature and details of the plot. Upon learning
these&mdash;and in spite of whatever may meanwhile have taken place
in France, or of whatever authority Invernaion may conceive that he
possesses&mdash;I must have commanded the immediate abandonment of
this undertaking, as being inopportune and likely at this present
time lastingly to injure His Majesty's cause. That was my clear
duty.</p>
<p>"For reasons which I do not propose to state, I temporized. I
was considering how to act in such a way as to serve not only His
Majesty's interests, but also certain sudden interests of my own.
Whilst I was so considering, the unexpected happened. It was then
that so as to account for my lingering in England and so as to
provide for my probable return, I had again communicated with
Monsieur Bentinck. To my surprise, Bentinck sent for me. Believing
me as hard driven by circumstances as I had represented, that
impudent Dutchman had the effrontery to offer me employment as a
spy.</p>
<p>"He showed himself acquainted with the fact that I had received
from Glenleven an invitation to join your conspiracy, and his
instructions to me were that I should accept the invitation. I was
to join you so that I might discover for him the only two facts of
which Monsieur Bentinck appeared to be still in ignorance: the
occasion when the attack on the Prince of Orange was to be made and
the whereabouts of the elusive and dangerous Ian Macdonald of
Invernaion, so that his troublesome person might be seized by
Bentinck's agents.</p>
<p>"In my indignation at the insult of such an offer, and at
whatever ultimate cost to myself, I was about to return the only
answer which it demanded when I was checked by the perception of
what you must be perceiving: something very odd, very mysterious in
the proposal.</p>
<p>"Monsieur Bentinck had used an almost excessive frankness: not
only did he reveal himself fully aware of the nature and aim of
this plot of yours, not only did he assert that he knew the names
of all engaged in it, but he knew also&mdash;as I have already
said&mdash;that Lord Glenleven had already invited me to join
it.</p>
<p>"At first I took this for pure assumption. But when I came to
consider further, to add it to the rest of his knowledge, I began
to persuade myself that there must be already a spy amongst you.
But if this were so, why should Bentinck employ me to ascertain
that which the existing spy could ascertain so easily? And why
should he be so recklessly frank in betraying to me the wide
knowledge he already possessed? I might in my turn betray it to
you, and thus frustrate the government's chief aim, which was to
seize the person of Ian Macdonald.</p>
<p>"These were bewildering questions; and I could answer them only
by assumptions. The first was that perhaps Bentinck did not fully
trust the spy he was already employing. The second was that
Bentinck's faith that I would not betray him must rest upon the
conviction that I was a needy and venal scoundrel unable to resist
the seduction of the high reward offered for information that would
lead to Invernaion's capture. He certainly had some grounds for
this. I had been known for a Jacobite, and I was petitioning King
William's government for employment; that in itself did not make me
respected. I proclaimed that my only fidelity was to the hand that
paid me; I allowed it to appear that I was not only a broken
gamester, but a man who did not scruple to trade upon his
antecedents so as to exploit the generosity of Jacobites.</p>
<p>"Was it difficult, then, to suppose that Bentinck should be
acting upon those contemptuous assumptions?</p>
<p>"Certain it is that if I had refused his offer, I should never
have been suffered to leave the Palace. This, however, was not my
reason for accepting.</p>
<p>"For I did accept, as Glenleven has informed you. This to his
own further undoing, since he cannot tell you how he comes by that
knowledge without confessing himself what I now know him to
be."</p>
<p>Glenleven stirred convulsively. He attempted to rear himself as
if to answer. But his guards repressed him, and this with a
roughness which showed how little they desired interruptions at
this moment.</p>
<p>"I accepted," the Colonel resumed, "so that I might probe this
mystery and discover and deliver you from the betrayer of whose
existence I was persuaded.</p>
<p>"At first Bentinck's knowledge of what had passed between
Glenleven and myself in the course of an early morning walk from
Gascoigne's seemed&mdash;if he had not drawn a bow at a
venture&mdash;to circumscribe the field of my search. Only one man
knew of that besides Glenleven himself, and to suspect Glenleven
then was out of the question. That man was Major O'Grady, who had
been with us that night at Gascoigne's until we set out together,
and who had been close in talk with Glenleven just before.</p>
<p>"Subsequent reflection showed me, however, that Glenleven's
intention to draw me into the plot must have been known to you all,
and so I sought confirmation of my assumption.</p>
<p>"Now it is common knowledge that there is no man so vulnerable
to the corrupting influence of gold as he who is in need. I sought
amongst you the man whose circumstances were most straitened, and
again the path led straight to Major O'Grady. It began to seem to
me that I need look no further."</p>
<p>"It's much obliged to you I am, on my soul!" O'Grady grumbled.
"A sweet flattery."</p>
<p>The Colonel acknowledged the interruption by a fleeting smile,
and went on.</p>
<p>"But whilst hunting with the hounds, I attempted also to run
with the hare. It was my duty to King James to stifle this
conspiracy, and my concern for Lady Lochmore urged me to remove her
from it. My attempt in this direction brought a quarrel on my
hands, very odd and reckless at such a time, followed by a
reconciliation even more odd in its abruptness.</p>
<p>"I sought an explanation of that in Lord Glenleven's relations
with Lady Lochmore. I confess that my first conjecture was that he
had been moved to his recklessness by perceiving in me a possible
rival to her ladyship's affections. But my investigations revealed
that he was not only her next of kin, but, of course, Ian
Macdonald's, and that he was heir to the very considerable dominion
of Invernaion. They also revealed that Glenleven's gambling father
had left him a very restricted patrimony. Then I discovered that
hopes entertained by Glenleven of mending his fortunes by marrying
Lady Lochmore had been definitely and finally quenched by her
ladyship.</p>
<p>"Gradually the nasty truth began to emerge. If Ian Macdonald
perished, James Macdonald, Viscount Glenleven, would succeed to
lands which, out of consideration for services to King William,
might be spared from confiscation."</p>
<p>He was interrupted there by a general stir, and an outburst of
incredulous anger from Dalkeith, who fiercely protested that the
Colonel went too far in his conclusions.</p>
<p>Encouraged by this, Glenleven roused himself. "It's all lies! A
mass of wicked, reckless assumptions, as you shall discover."</p>
<p>"Ifs an explanation," the Colonel amended sternly "The only
explanation that fits all the facts."</p>
<p>Their bewildered looks showed him how far it still was from
explaining matters to them.</p>
<p>"You don't yet understand?" He smiled a little wearily "Let me
explain.</p>
<p>"Such a game as Glenleven played is fraught with peril. First
there is such peril as that which has now overtaken him. Then, if
successful, there is peril as great afterwards to the enjoyment of
the fruits of his treachery.</p>
<p>"What would men have said at Invernaion when they found
Glenleven lord of estates inherited from one who had perished in a
treason that Glenleven had shared? Could he have escaped suspicion
of being what he is? Would the clansmen have allowed him to survive
that suspicion?</p>
<p>"To avoid this it became necessary that he should provide
himself with a stalking-horse; a stalking-horse to be sacrificed
when the hunt was ended and the kill was made.</p>
<p>"That was the condition he made with Bentinck. It is not to be
supposed that it would be difficult to make. Monsieur Bentinck out
of fear and love for his master William of Orange, would be
prepared to agree almost to anything so that he might lay by the
heels an enemy so resolute, bold, fanatical and elusive as
Invernaion had proved himself to be. What, after all, to Bentinck
was the lordship of some acres in the Highlands of Scotland
compared with the peace of mind to be gained from the suppression
of Ian Macdonald?</p>
<p>"Anyway, that, I concluded, was the bargain that had been
made."</p>
<p>The admission that these were but conclusions was Glenleven's
cue wildly to interrupt him.</p>
<p>"You concluded! You admit that all this is just what you
concluded. My God! are your rash conclusions to convict a man of
the things of which you accuse me? Am I to be constrained here to
listen to these infamous lies? Is this your sense of justice, you
cowards? Seven of you against one man! And not a proof, not a
pennyworth of proof of anything he says. I made a bargain with my
Lord of Portland, he glibly tells you. When did I make this
bargain? When? What was the occasion?"</p>
<p>"I think I can tell you that," the Colonel quietly answered him.
"You bring me to the very starting-point of my conclusions."</p>
<p>He had turned half-aside, and was addressing himself now
directly to Glenleven.</p>
<p>"After Invernaion at the risk of his life had rescued you from
the gallows by kidnapping de la Rue, he was induced to do a like
heroic service for Sir John Fenwick. But the government, outraged
at seeing its justice cheated in this manner, took the course of
dealing with Sir John by bill of attainder. That course having been
once discovered, there was no reason why it should not also have
been applied to your case.</p>
<p>"Why, I asked myself, had this not been done? I made inquiries,
and I discovered that at the time when you dreaded re-arrest, you
were actually summoned by Lord Portland to Kensington Palace. What
passed between you at that interview? What undertakings did
Portland extract from you, that you did not go from Kensington
Palace to the Tower? At what price did you obtain that no bill of
attainder should be moved against you, whilst Sir John Fenwick paid
with his head for a treason notoriously less black than yours?</p>
<p>"The answer is because it was in your power to betray, and it
proved also in your nature to betray, one whose activities the
government really feared. You would give the government
Invernaion's life as the price of your own. To accomplish it, and
so that you might draw him into a trap, you conceived and set on
foot this conspiracy modelled upon the Assassination Plot. But so
that your part in its subsequent betrayal should never appear, so
that you might be free to enjoy the blood-wealth you were to earn,
you brought me in to be your stalking-horse, and afterwards the
chief witness against Invernaion at his trial." His cold, accusing
glance, which had been fixed upon Glenleven, came back to the
company about the table. "Now you understand why I was employed.
Thus publicly disclosed at the trial as the betrayer, I made
Glenleven safe from any suspicion that might disturb his enjoyment
of the fruits of his treachery."</p>
<p>He ceased, and silence followed. Out of set, forbidding
countenances eyes of loathing were turned upon Glenleven where he
sat, limp and pallid, the fear of death before him. As if those
condemning eyes acted upon him like so many goads, he rallied under
them. He leaned forward, cunning and fury surmounting the fear in
him.</p>
<p>"You have heard him, eh?" His lips were twisted into a leer.
"You have listened to his tissue of falsehood, and you are
convinced by it, you fools. Yet at a breath I can demolish it, like
the cobweb that it is." His voice, usually so musical, came harsh
and shrill. "If what this man says is true, if I needed him for a
stalking-horse, if he was so valuable to me, so precious to me,
should I have put a duel upon him and sought his life? Should I?
Ask yourselves, sirs!"</p>
<p>Stuart of Meorach replied before Colonel Walton could do so. I
have said that, for all his heat, he was a man of shrewd
perceptions.</p>
<p>"I, for one, have asked myself that already. But the answer
doesn't help you, you villain. That was an action of panic on your
part when you discovered Colonel Walton making efforts to detach
her ladyship and her brother from the plot. If he were to succeed
in that design, your foul scheme would be mined; your victim would
escape; and your chance of fortune would be lost to you. So you
chose what you conceived to be the lesser evil. Does any doubt that
explanation? Isn't it plain enough?" His prominent eyes swept
fiercely round the board, only to meet conviction on every
countenance.</p>
<p>The Colonel gravely nodded. "It was his unnatural haste to be
reconciled with me after he had failed in that encounter which
first aroused my suspicions. He had then no alternative but to
accept the risk he would have avoided, and it only remained for him
to rest his hopes entirely upon prevailing in spite of me. It was
in this that he overreached himself."</p>
<p>He paused there, thoughtfully. Then he fetched a sigh. "That, I
think, is all that I can tell you of this nasty matter."</p>
<p>"And more than enough, as God's my life!" said Geoffrey Howard,
adding with terrible significance: "We know what remains to be
done."</p>
<p>There was the commencement of a general stir at this, and
suddenly Glenleven was struggling with those who guarded him. He
broke into blasphemy and protestations.</p>
<p>"Damn you for a pack of fools," he cried at the end of them.
"You'll never endanger your silly necks by believing this string of
lies."</p>
<p>"Och, of course not," O'Grady mocked him, a broad grin on his
nut-cracker face. "Why should we when ye can so easily be
dispelling them? Just tell us, now, where ye were going in such a
hurry when we caught you at the gate."</p>
<p>Glenleven glared at him in anguish.</p>
<p>Colonel Walton looked wistful. "But that I scared him into that
act of self-betrayal, you might indeed require more proof than I
can furnish."</p>
<p>"Not even then," said Sir Hamish. "Let us have done."</p>
<p>"Ah, no, no! In mercy not... not his life!" her ladyship begged.
Mr Hay heaved himself up with an oath. "My lady, it is our lives or
his. It remains to find Haceldama for this Judas."</p>
<p>But Colonel Walton intervened.</p>
<p>"Let him find it for himself, like the other Judas," he said,
and so provoked an uproar of dissension. He raised his hand, to
repress it. "You have yourselves to consider sirs. You will derive
no security from putting Glenleven to death, because he can add
nothing to the information he has already given Bentinck. The
government would know upon whom to avenge him, if it desired to do
so.</p>
<p>"But he may with advantage be trussed up, and bestowed in the
cellar for the next four-and-twenty hours, so as to give you so
much start in scattering to your respective homes.</p>
<p>"Your safety lies in the fact that King William desires no
martyrs. Therefore I will venture to prophesy with some confidence
that provided you depart at once, and remain absent, you are not
likely to be troubled."</p>
<p>More solemnly he added: "And this, in His Majesty's name, is
what I now command you all to do."</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="ch-23" id="ch-23"></a>Chapter 23. The Sod of Dudley
Walton</h2>
<p>That command issued in the name of the King Over the Water, was
accepted by those misguided gentlemen as the last word. It brought
matters to a speedy conclusion.</p>
<p>O'Grady and Sir Hamish, assisted by Mr Hay, trussed up Glenleven
with perhaps unnecessary rigour, and under a running snarl of
taunts from the Irishman the while. With a blow across the mouth,
he had silenced the Viscount's last fierce blasphemous protest.</p>
<p>Whilst they were about this unpleasant business her ladyship,
who had moved away to the window, without a single word spoken,
stood there with her back to the room. Only the droop of her
shoulders which normally were so proudly carried, gave an
indication of the dejection into which she had been plunged.</p>
<p>There at the window she remained after Glenleven had been
carried out; and she was still in that attitude after each of those
sorely disheartened conspirators had briefly and feelingly taken
leave of Colonel Walton, the representative of majesty.</p>
<p>She did not even turn when Lord Claybourne approached her to
offer her his services, to place himself at her commands. It was in
a stifled voice that she thanked him and declined his aid.</p>
<p>"Give yourself no thought for me, my lord," she ended, and
without moving she made a gesture of gentle dismissal.</p>
<p>Claybourne caught the hand she so extended, and bending from his
stately height, kissed it in valediction.</p>
<p>The others followed, one by one, each taking the hand which she
yielded without turning, and each, with a murmured word, thereafter
departing.</p>
<p>At last, when she heard the door close and all was still, she
uttered a little moan, and faced about to discover that in the room
there was still another tenant beside herself.</p>
<p>Colonel Walton, straight, self-contained, and very elegant in
his rust-red, gold-laced coat, was standing quietly at the foot of
the long table.</p>
<p>Startled, her tear-stained eyes considered him out of a
countenance upon which grief and shame had set their heavy
stamp.</p>
<p>"Why do you stay?" she asked him, and in her voice there was an
undertone that was almost fierce.</p>
<p>"Did you truly think I had gone? That I had left you here alone
with your sorrow?" His smile was sweetly wistful.</p>
<p>"Why not? Why should you remain? I was of those who doubted
you."</p>
<p>"But your doubts were justified. I did take service with
Monsieur Bentinck as a spy."</p>
<p>"So you have stayed to mock me? Is that generous? But, to be
sure, I deserve no generosity where I displayed none."</p>
<p>"That is why I stayed. So that you may make amends by displaying
it now." He advanced upon her. He took her hands, which she
surrendered without protest, almost as one in fear. "There was one
thing I withheld from them: the reason why I failed in my duty when
I did not disclose my commission at once to Glenleven. That is for
your ear alone. Will you hear it now?"</p>
<p>The tone he used, rather than his words, was responsible for the
sudden tumult of her breast. "That...that must be a matter for your
judgment, sir."</p>
<p>"Ah, no. Not judgment. Judgment shall be yours. You shall
pronounce it when you have heard. I neglected my duty because had I
performed it I should have been afforded, perhaps, no chance of
ever seeing you again."</p>
<p>"You had seen me but once," she protested.</p>
<p>"And nothing else thereafter. As things have fallen out, it is
perhaps fortunate for you all that I did neglect my duty; it is
most fortunate for Invernaion; fortunate above all for the cause of
King James. But is it fortunate for me?"</p>
<p>"For you?" And now as she looked at him wide-eyed, he perceived
the dawn of a sudden alarm on her sweet, white face. The
explanation of it followed: "Ah, yes. What of you? How will you
escape Bentinck's anger for your breach of faith with him?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that!" He laughed softly, suddenly warmed by her concern.
"That is far, indeed, from my preoccupations. My preparations are
made. The cutter that brought Lavernis over stays for me at
Blackwall. Lavernis, himself, waits here; not in your servants'
hall, as I pretended, but at your water-gate there, with a boat in
which to convey me straight to the cutter. For it should be plain
to you that I came in the knowledge that this would be our last
assembly."</p>
<p>"Why, then?" she said. "Then?"</p>
<p>"I still wait to learn if my neglect of duty, so fortunate to so
many, is to be fortunate to me."</p>
<p>She understood him now The tenderness of his down-slanting,
melancholy eyes left nothing to be guessed.</p>
<p>The colour stirred in her white cheeks. She faltered a little as
she asked him with instinctive feminine pretence: "What...what
would make it so?"</p>
<p>He was blunt in his reply "Your coming with me to France, my
dear."</p>
<p>She faced him in sweetest frankness of surrender.</p>
<p>"You still wish it after my doubtings of you?"</p>
<p>He laughed, softly but very joyously, and boldly took her into
his arms.</p>
<p>"It was Claybourne's opinion that you might save my soul for me.
And now I am of that opinion, too."</p>
<p>"You impose a hard task upon me," she sighed. But the sigh was
of content.</p>
<p>And that is how Colonel Dudley Walton returning empty-handed to
Saint Germains in so far as the cause of King James was concerned,
went neither empty-handed nor empty-hearted in so far as he was
concerned himself.</p>
