Poinsettias</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;A  remarkable man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was not my husband speaking, but some passerby. However, I looked up at George  with a smile, and found him looking down at me with much the same humour. We  had often spoken of the odd phrases one hears in the street, and how  interesting it would be sometimes to hear a little more of the conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a case in point,&rdquo; he laughed, as he guided me through the crowd of  theatre-goers which invariably block this part of Broadway at the hour of  eight. &ldquo;We shall never know whose eulogy we have just heard. &lsquo;A remarkable  man!&rsquo; There are not many of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  was my somewhat indifferent reply. It was a keen winter night and snow was  packed upon the walks in a way to throw into sharp relief the figures of such  pedestrians as happened to be walking alone. &ldquo;But it seems to me that, so far  as general appearance goes, the one in front answers your description most  admirably.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  pointed to a man hurrying around the corner just ahead of us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he&rsquo;s remarkably well built. I noticed him when he came out of the Clermont.&rdquo;  This was a hotel we had just passed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s not only that. It&rsquo;s his height, his very striking features, his  expression&mdash;&rdquo; I stopped suddenly, gripping George&rsquo;s arm convulsively in a  surprise he appeared to share. We had turned the corner immediately behind the  man of whom we were speaking and so had him still in full view.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  he doing?&rdquo; I asked, in a low whisper. We were only a few feet behind. &ldquo;Look!  look! don&rsquo;t you call that curious?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  husband stared, then uttered a low, &ldquo;Rather.&rdquo; The man ahead of us, presenting  in every respect the appearance of a gentleman, had suddenly stooped to the kerb  and was washing his hands in the snow, furtively, but with a vigour and purpose  which could not fail to arouse the strangest conjectures in any chance  onlooker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pilate!&rdquo;  escaped my lips, in a sort of nervous chuckle. But George shook his head at me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  like it,&rdquo; he muttered, with unusual gravity. &ldquo;Did you see his face?&rdquo; Then as  the man rose and hurried away from us down the street, &ldquo;I should like to follow  him. I do believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  here we became aware of a quick rush and sudden clamour around the corner we  had just left, and turning quickly, saw that something had occurred on Broadway  which was fast causing a tumult.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;What can have happened? Let&rsquo;s go see, George. Perhaps it  has something to do with our man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  husband, with a final glance down the street at the fast disappearing figure,  yielded to my importunity, and possibly to some new curiosity of his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  like to stop that man first,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But what excuse have I? He may be  nothing but a crank, with some crack-brained idea in his head. We&rsquo;ll soon know;  for there&rsquo;s certainly something wrong there on Broadway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>He</i>  came out of the Clermont,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know. If the excitement isn&rsquo;t there, what we&rsquo;ve just seen is simply a  coincidence.&rdquo; Then, as we retraced our steps to the corner &ldquo;Whatever we hear or  see, don&rsquo;t say anything about this man. It&rsquo;s after eight, remember, and we  promised Adela that we would be at the house before nine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  be quiet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was the last word he had time to speak before we found ourselves in the midst  of a crowd of men and women, jostling one another in curiosity or in the  consternation following a quick alarm. All were looking one way, and, as this  was towards the entrance of the Clermont, it was evident enough to us that the  alarm had indeed had its origin in the very place we had anticipated. I felt my  husband&rsquo;s arm press me closer to his side as we worked our way towards the  entrance, and presently caught a warning sound from his lips as the oaths and  confused cries everywhere surrounding us were broken here and there by  articulate words and we heard:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  beautiful Miss Challoner!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  millionairess in her own right!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Killed,  they say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! suddenly dead; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;George,  what shall we do?&rdquo; I managed to cry into my husband&rsquo;s ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get  out of this. There is no chance of our reaching that door, and I can&rsquo;t have you  standing round any longer in this icy slush.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but  is it right?&rdquo; I urged, in an importunate whisper. &ldquo;Should we go home while he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  My first duty is to you. We will go make our visit; but to-morrow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t wait till to-morrow,&rdquo; I pleaded, wild to satisfy my curiosity in regard  to an event in which I naturally felt a keen personal interest.</p>
  <p>He  drew me as near to the edge of the crowd as he could. There were new murmurs  all about us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it&rsquo;s a case of heart-failure, why send for the police?&rdquo; asked one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is better to have an officer or two here,&rdquo; grumbled another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  comes a cop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;m going to vamoose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; whispered George, who, for all his bluster was as  curious as myself. &ldquo;We will try the rear door where there are fewer persons.  Possibly we can make our way in there, and if we can, Slater will tell us all  we want to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Slater  was the assistant manager of the Clermont, and one of George&rsquo;s oldest friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  hurry,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I am being crushed here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>George  did hurry, and in a few minutes we were before the rear entrance of the great  hotel. There was a mob gathered here also, but it was neither so large nor so  rough as the one on Broadway. Yet I doubt if we should have been able to work  our way through it if Slater had not, at that very instant, shown himself in  the doorway, in company with an officer to whom he was giving some final  instructions. George caught his eye as soon as he was through with the man, and  ventured on what I thought a rather uncalled for plea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us in, Slater,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;My wife feels a little faint; she has been knocked  about so by the crowd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  manager glanced at my face, and shouted to the people around us to make room. I  felt myself lifted up, and that is all I remember of this part of our  adventure. For, affected more than I realised by the excitement of the event, I  no sooner saw the way cleared for our entrance than I made good my husband&rsquo;s  words by fainting away in earnest.</p>
  <p>When  I came to, it was suddenly and with perfect recognition of my surroundings. The  small reception room to which I had been taken was one I had often visited, and  its familiar features did not hold my attention for a moment. What I did see  and welcome was my husband&rsquo;s face bending close over me, and to him I spoke  first. My words must have sounded oddly to those about. &ldquo;Have they told you  anything about it?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Did he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  quick pressure on my arm silenced me, and then I noticed that we were not  alone. Two or three ladies stood near, watching me, and one had evidently been  using some restorative, for she held a small vinaigrette in her hand. To this  lady, George made haste to introduce me, and from her I presently learned the  cause of the disturbance in the hotel.</p>
  <p>It  was of a somewhat different nature from what I expected, and during the  recital, I could not prevent myself from casting furtive and inquiring glances  at George.</p>
  <p>Edith,  the well-known daughter of Moses Challoner, had fallen suddenly dead on the  floor of the mezzanine. She was not known to have been in poor health, still  less in danger of a fatal attack, and the shock was consequently great to her  friends, several of whom were in the building. Indeed, it was likely to prove a  shock to the whole community, for she had great claims to general admiration,  and her death must be regarded as a calamity to persons in all stations of  life.</p>
  <p>I  realised this myself, for I had heard much of the young lady&rsquo;s private virtues,  as well as of her great beauty and distinguished manner. A heavy loss, indeed,  but&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  she alone when she fell?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Virtually  alone. Some persons sat on the other side of the room, reading at the big round  table. They did not even hear her fall. They say that the band was playing  unusually loud in the musicians&rsquo; gallery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you feeling quite well, now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  myself,&rdquo; I gratefully replied as I rose slowly from the sofa. Then, as my kind  informer stepped aside, I turned to George with the proposal we should go now.</p>
  <p>He  seemed as anxious as myself to leave and together we moved towards the door,  while the hum of excited comment which the intrusion of a fainting woman had  undoubtedly interrupted, recommenced behind us till the whole room buzzed.</p>
  <p>In  the hall we encountered Mr. Slater, whom I have before mentioned. He was trying  to maintain order while himself in a state of great agitation. Seeing us, he  could not refrain from whispering a few words into my husband&rsquo;s ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  doctor has just gone up&mdash;her doctor, I mean. He&rsquo;s simply dumbfounded. Says that  she was the healthiest woman in New York yesterday&mdash;I think&mdash;don&rsquo;t mention it,  that he suspects something quite different from heart failure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; asked George, following the assistant manager down the broad  flight of steps leading to the office. Then, as I pressed up close to Mr.  Slater&rsquo;s other side, &ldquo;She was by herself, wasn&rsquo;t she, in the half floor above?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and had been writing a letter. She fell with it still in her hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  they carried her to her room?&rdquo; I eagerly inquired, glancing fearfully up at the  large semi-circular openings overlooking us from the place where she had  fallen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet. Mr. Hammond insists upon waiting for the coroner.&rdquo; (Mr. Hammond was the  proprietor of the hotel.) &ldquo;She is lying on one of the big couches near which  she fell. If you like, I can give you a glimpse of her. She looks beautiful.  It&rsquo;s terrible to think that she is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  don&rsquo;t know why we consented. We were under a spell, I think. At all events, we  accepted his offer and followed him up a narrow staircase open to very few that  night. At the top, he turned upon us with a warning gesture which I hardly  think we needed, and led us down a narrow hall flanked by openings  corresponding to those we had noted from below. At the furthest one he paused  and, beckoning us to his side, pointed across the lobby into the large  writing-room which occupied the better part of the mezzanine floor.</p>
  <p>We  saw people standing in various attitudes of grief and dismay about a couch, one  end of which only was visible to us at the moment. The doctor had just joined  them, and every head was turned towards him and every body bent forward in  anxious expectation. I remember the face of one grey haired old man. I shall  never forget it. He was probably her father. Later, I knew him to be so. Her  face, even her form, was entirely hidden from us, but as we watched (I have  often thought with what heartless curiosity) a sudden movement took place in  the whole group&mdash;and for one instant a startling picture presented itself to our  gaze. Miss Challoner was stretched out upon the couch. She was dressed as she  came from dinner, in a gown of ivory-tinted satin, relieved at the breast by a  large bouquet of scarlet poinsettias. I mention this adornment, because it was  what first met and drew our eyes and the eyes of every one about her, though  the face, now quite revealed, would seem to have the greater attraction. But  the cause was evident and one not to be resisted. The doctor was pointing at  these poinsettias in horror and with awful meaning, and though we could not  hear his words, we knew almost instinctively, both from his attitude and the  cries which burst from the lips of those about him, that something more than  broken petals and disordered laces had met his eyes; that blood was  there&mdash;slowly oozing drops from the heart&mdash;which for some reason had escaped all  eyes till now.</p>
  <p>Miss  Challoner was dead, not from unsuspected disease, but from the violent attack  of some murderous weapon; As the realisation of this brought fresh panic and  bowed the old father&rsquo;s head with emotions even more bitter than those of grief,  I turned a questioning look up at George&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>It  was fixed with a purpose I had no trouble in understanding.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_2"></a><b>Chapter 2<br>
  &ldquo;I Know The Man&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Yet  he made no effort to detain Mr. Slater, when that gentleman, under this renewed  excitement, hastily left us. He was not the man to rush into anything  impulsively, and not even the presence of murder could change his ways.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to feel sure of myself,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Can you bear the strain of waiting  around a little longer, Laura? I mustn&rsquo;t forget that you fainted just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I can bear it; much better than I could bear going to Adela&rsquo;s in my present  state of mind. Don&rsquo;t you think the man we saw had something to do with this?  Don&rsquo;t you believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  Let us listen rather than talk. What are they saying over there? Can you hear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  And I cannot bear to look. Yet I don&rsquo;t want to go away. It&rsquo;s all so dreadful.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  devilish. Such a beautiful girl! Laura, I must leave you for a moment. Do you  mind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no; yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  did mind; but he was gone before I could take back my word. Alone, I felt the  tragedy much more than when he was with me. Instead of watching, as I had  hitherto done, every movement in the room opposite, I drew back against the  wall and hid my eyes, waiting feverishly for George&rsquo;s return.</p>
  <p>He  came, when he did come, in some haste and with certain marks of increased  agitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laura,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;Slater says that we may possibly be wanted and proposes that we stay  here all night. I have telephoned Adela and have made it all right at home.  Will you come to your room? This is no place for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nothing  could have pleased me better; to be near and yet not the direct observer of  proceedings in which we took so secret an interest! I showed my gratitude by  following George immediately. But I could not go without casting another glance  at the tragic scene I was leaving. A stir was perceptible there, and I was just  in time to see its cause. A tall, angular gentleman was approaching from the  direction of the musicians&rsquo; gallery, and from the manner of all present, as  well as from the whispered comment of my husband, I recognised in him the  special official for whom all had been waiting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you going to tell <i>him?</i>&rdquo; was my question to George as we made our way down to  the lobby.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  depends. First, I am going to see you settled in a room quite remote from this  business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall not like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, my dear, but it is best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  could not gainsay this.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless,  after the first few minutes of relief, I found it very lonesome upstairs. The  pictures which crowded upon me of the various groups of excited and wildly  gesticulating men and women through which we had passed on our way up, mingled  themselves with the solemn horror of the scene in the writing-room, with its  fleeting vision of youth and beauty lying pulseless in sudden death. I could  not escape the one without feeling the immediate impress of the other, and if  by chance they both yielded for an instant to that earlier scene of a desolate  street, with its solitary lamp shining down on the crouched figure of a man  washing his shaking hands in a drift of freshly fallen snow, they immediately  rushed back with a force and clearness all the greater for the momentary lapse.</p>
  <p>I  was still struggling with these fancies when the door opened, and George came  in. There was news in his face as I rushed to meet him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me&mdash;tell,&rdquo; I begged.</p>
  <p>He  tried to smile at my eagerness, but the attempt was ghastly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  been listening and looking,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and this is all I have learned. Miss  Challoner died, not from a stroke or from disease of any kind, but from a wound  reaching the heart. No one saw the attack, or even the approach or departure of  the person inflicting this wound. If she was killed by a pistol-shot, it was at  a distance, and almost over the heads of the persons sitting at the table we  saw there. But the doctors shake their heads at the word <i>pistol-shot</i>, though  they refuse to explain themselves or to express any opinion till the wound has  been probed. This they are going to do at once, and when that question is  decided, I may feel it my duty to speak and may ask you to support my story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will tell what I saw,&rdquo; said I.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. That is all that will be required. We are strangers to the parties  concerned, and only speak from a sense of justice. It may be that our story  will make no impression, and that we shall be dismissed with but few thanks.  But that is nothing to us. If the woman has been murdered, he is the murderer.  With such a conviction in my mind, there can be no doubt as to my duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  can never make them understand how he looked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I don&rsquo;t expect to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  his manner as he fled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  that either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  can only describe what we saw him do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  what an adventure for quiet people like us! George, I don&rsquo;t believe he shot  her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  must have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  they would have seen&mdash;have heard&mdash;the people around, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  they say; but I have a theory&mdash;but no matter about that now. I&rsquo;m going down  again to see how things have progressed. I&rsquo;ll be back for you later. Only be  ready.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Be  ready! I almost laughed,&mdash;a hysterical laugh, of course, when I recalled the  injunction. Be ready! This lonely sitting by myself, with nothing to do but  think was a fine preparation for a sudden appearance before those men&mdash;some of  them police-officers, no doubt.</p>
  <p>But  that&rsquo;s enough about myself; I&rsquo;m not the heroine of this story. In a half hour  or an hour&mdash;I never knew which&mdash;George reappeared only to tell me that no  conclusions had as yet been reached; an element of great mystery involved the  whole affair, and the most astute detectives on the force had been sent for.  Her father, who had been her constant companion all winter, had not the least  suggestion to offer in way of its solution. So far as he knew&mdash;and he believed  himself to have been in perfect accord with his daughter&mdash;she had injured no  one. She had just lived the even, happy and useful life of a young woman of  means, who sees duties beyond those of her own household and immediate  surroundings. If, in the fulfillment of those duties, she had encountered any  obstacle to content, he did not know it; nor could he mention a friend of  hers&mdash;he would even say lovers, since that was what he meant&mdash;who to his  knowledge could be accused of harbouring any such passion of revenge as was  manifested in this secret and diabolical attack. They were all gentlemen and  respected her as heartily as they appeared to admire her. To no living being,  man or woman, could he point as possessing any motive for such a deed. She had  been the victim of some mistake, his lovely and ever kindly disposed daughter,  and while the loss was irreparable he would never make it unendurable by thinking  otherwise.</p>
  <p>Such  was the father&rsquo;s way of looking at the matter, and I own that it made our duty  a trifle hard. But George&rsquo;s mind, when once made up, was persistent to the  point of obstinacy, and while he was yet talking he led me out of the room and  down the hall to the elevator.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Slater knows we have something to say, and will manage the interview before us  in the very best manner,&rdquo; he confided to me now with an encouraging air. &ldquo;We  are to go to the blue reception room on the parlour floor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I nodded,  and nothing more was said till we entered the place mentioned. Here we came  upon several gentlemen, standing about, of a more or less professional  appearance. This was not very agreeable to one of my retiring disposition, but  a look from George brought back my courage, and I found myself waiting rather  anxiously for the questions I expected to hear put.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Slater was there according to his promise, and after introducing us, briefly  stated that we had some evidence to give regarding the terrible occurrence  which had just taken place in the house.</p>
  <p>George  bowed, and the chief spokesman&mdash;I am sure he was a police-officer of some  kind&mdash;asked him to tell what it was.</p>
  <p>George  drew himself up&mdash;George is not one of your tall men, but he makes a very good  appearance at times. Then he seemed suddenly to collapse. The sight of their  expectation made him feel how flat and childish his story would sound. I, who  had shared his adventure, understood his embarrassment, but the others were  evidently at a loss to do so, for they glanced askance at each other as he  hesitated, and only looked back when I ventured to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the peculiarity of the occurrence which affects my husband. The thing we saw  may mean nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us hear what it was and we will judge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  my husband spoke up, and related our little experience. If it did not create a  sensation, it was because these men were well accustomed to surprises of all  kinds.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Washed  his hands&mdash;a gentleman&mdash;out there in the snow&mdash;just after the alarm was raised  here?&rdquo; repeated one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you saw him come out of this house?&rdquo; another put in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir; we noticed him particularly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you describe him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Mr. Slater who put this question; he had less control over himself, and  considerable eagerness could be heard in his voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was a very fine-looking man; unusually tall and unusually striking both in his  dress and appearance. What I could see of his face was bare of beard, and very  expressive. He walked with the swing of an athlete, and only looked mean and  small when he was stooping and dabbling in the snow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  clothes. Describe his clothes.&rdquo; There was an odd sound in Mr. Slater&rsquo;s voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  wore a silk hat and there was fur on his overcoat. I think the fur was black.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Slater stepped back, then moved forward again with a determined air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know the man,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_3"></a><b>Chapter 3<br>
    The Man</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do; or rather, I know a man who answers to this description. He comes here once  in a while. I do not know whether or not he was in the building to-night, but  Clausen can tell you; no one escapes Clausen&rsquo;s eye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brotherson.  A very uncommon person in many respects; quite capable of such an eccentricity,  but incapable, I should say, of crime. He&rsquo;s a gifted talker and so well read  that he can hold one&rsquo;s attention for hours. Of his tastes, I can only say that  they appear to be mainly scientific. But he is not averse to society, and is  always very well dressed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  taste for science and for fine clothing do not often go together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  man is an exception to all rules. The one I&rsquo;m speaking of, I mean. I don&rsquo;t say  that he&rsquo;s the fellow seen pottering in the snow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call  up Clausen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  manager stepped to the telephone.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  George had advanced to speak to a man who had beckoned to him from the other  side of the room, and with whom in another moment I saw him step out. Thus  deserted, I sank into a chair near one of the windows. Never had I felt more  uncomfortable. To attribute guilt to a totally unknown person&mdash;a person who is  little more to you than a shadowy silhouette against a background of snow&mdash;is  easy enough and not very disturbing to the conscience. But to hear that person  named; given positive attributes; lifted from the indefinite into a living,  breathing actuality, with a man&rsquo;s hopes, purposes and responsibilities, is an  entirely different proposition. This Brotherson might be the most innocent  person alive; and, if so, what had we done? Nothing to congratulate ourselves  upon, certainly. And George was not present to comfort and encourage me. He was&mdash;</p>
  <p>Where  was he? The man who had carried him off was the youngest in the group. What had  he wanted of George? Those who remained showed no interest in the matter. They  had enough to say among themselves. But I was interested&mdash;naturally so, and, in  my uneasiness, glanced restlessly from the window, the shade of which was up.  The outlook was a very peaceful one. This room faced a side street, and, as my  eyes fell upon the whitened pavements, I received an answer to one, and that  the most anxious, of my queries. This was the street into which we had turned,  in the wake of the handsome stranger they were trying at this very moment to  identify with Brotherson. George had evidently been asked to point out the  exact spot where the man had stopped, for I could see from my vantage point two  figures bending near the kerb, and even pawing at the snow which lay there. It  gave me a slight turn when one of them&mdash;I do not think it was George&mdash;began to  rub his hands together in much the way the unknown gentleman had done, and, in my  excitement, I probably uttered some sort of an ejaculation, for I was suddenly  conscious of a silence in the room, and when I turned saw all the men about me  looking my way.</p>
  <p>I  attempted to smile, but instead, shuddered painfully, as I raised my hand and  pointed down at the street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are imitating the man,&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;my husband and&mdash;and the person he went out  with. It looked dreadful to me; that is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One  of the gentlemen immediately said some kind words to me, and another smiled in  a very encouraging way. But their attention was soon diverted, and so was mine  by the entrance of a man in semi-uniform, who was immediately addressed as  Clausen.</p>
  <p>I  knew his face. He was one of the doorkeepers; the oldest employee about the  hotel, and the one best liked. I had often exchanged words with him myself.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Slater at once put his question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  Mr. Brotherson passed your door at any time to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Brotherson! I don&rsquo;t remember, really I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the unexpected reply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not often I forget. But so many people came rushing in during those few  minutes, and all so excited&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before  the excitement, Clausen. A little while before, possibly just before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  now I recall him! Yes, Mr. Brotherson went out of my door not many minutes  before the cry upstairs. I forgot because I had stepped back from the door to  hand a lady the muff she had dropped, and it was at that minute he went out. I  just got a glimpse of his back as he passed into the street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you are sure of that back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know another like it, when he wears that big coat of his. But Jim can  tell you, sir. He was in the cafe up to that minute, and that&rsquo;s where Mr.  Brotherson usually goes first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well; send up Jim. Tell him I have some orders to give him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old man bowed and went out.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  Mr. Slater had exchanged some words with the two officials, and now approached  me with an expression of extreme consideration. They were about to excuse me  from further participation in this informal inquiry. This I saw before he  spoke. Of course they were right. But I should greatly have preferred to stay  where I was till George came back.</p>
  <p>However,  I met him for an instant in the hall before I took the elevator, and later I  heard in a round-about way what Jim and some others about the house had to say  of Mr. Brotherson.</p>
  <p>He  was an habitue of the hotel, to the extent of dining once or twice a week in  the cafe, and smoking, afterwards, in the public lobby. When he was in the mood  for talk, he would draw an ever-enlarging group about him, but at other times  he would be seen sitting quite alone and morosely indifferent to all who  approached him. There was no mystery about his business. He was an inventor,  with one or two valuable patents already on the market. But this was not his  only interest. He was an all round sort of man, moody but brilliant in many  ways&mdash;a character which at once attracted and repelled, odd in that he seemed to  set little store by his good looks, yet was most careful to dress himself in a  way to show them off to advantage. If he had means beyond the ordinary no one  knew it, nor could any man say that he had not. On all personal matters he was  very close-mouthed, though he would talk about other men&rsquo;s riches in a way to  show that he cherished some very extreme views.</p>
  <p>This  was all which could be learned about him off-hand, and at so late an hour. I  was greatly interested, of course, and had plenty to think of till I saw George  again and learned the result of the latest investigations.</p>
  <p>Miss  Challoner had been shot, not stabbed. No other deduction was possible from such  facts as were now known, though the physicians had not yet handed in their  report, or even intimated what that report would be. No assailant could have  approached or left her, without attracting the notice of some one, if not all  of the persons seated at a table in the same room. She could only have been  reached by a bullet sent from a point near the head of a small winding  staircase connecting the mezzanine floor with a coat-room adjacent to the front  door. This has already been insisted on, as you will remember, and if you will  glance at the diagram which George hastily scrawled for me, you will see why.</p>
  <p>A.  B., as well as C. D., are half circular openings into the office lobby. E. F.  are windows giving upon Broadway, and G. the party wall, necessarily unbroken  by window, door or any other opening.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700511h-images/page022.png" width="613" height="750"></p>
  <p>It  follows then that the only possible means of approach to this room lies through  the archway H., or from the elevator door. But the elevator made no stop at the  mezzanine on or near the time of the attack upon Miss Challoner; nor did any  one leave the table or pass by it in either direction till after the alarm  given by her fall.</p>
  <p>But  a bullet calls for no approach. A man at X. might raise and fire his pistol  without attracting any attention to himself. The music, which all acknowledge  was at its full climax at this moment, would drown the noise of the explosion,  and the staircase, out of view of all but the victim, afford the same means of  immediate escape, which it must have given of secret and unseen approach. The  coat-room into which it descended communicated with the lobby very near the  main entrance, and if Mr. Brotherson were the man, his sudden appearance there  would thus be accounted for.</p>
  <p>To  be sure, this gentleman had not been noticed in the coatroom by the man then in  charge, but if the latter had been engaged at that instant, as he often was, in  hanging up or taking down a coat from the rack, a person might easily pass by  him and disappear into the lobby without attracting his attention. So many  people passed that way from the dining-room beyond, and so many of these were  tall, fine-looking and well-dressed.</p>
  <p>It  began to look bad for this man, if indeed he were the one we had seen under the  street-lamp; and, as George and I reviewed the situation, we felt our position  to be serious enough for us severally to set down our impressions of this man  before we lost our first vivid idea. I do not know what George wrote, for he  sealed his words up as soon as he had finished writing, but this is what I put  on paper while my memory was still fresh and my excitement unabated:</p>
  <p class="note">He had the look of a man of powerful intellect and  determined will, who shudders while he triumphs; who outwardly washes his hands  of a deed over which he inwardly gloats. This was when he first rose from the  snow. Afterwards he had a moment of fear; plain, human, everyday fear. But this  was evanescent. Before he had turned to go, he showed the self-possession of  one who feels himself so secure, or is so well-satisfied with himself, that he  is no longer conscious of other emotions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  fellow,&rdquo; I commented aloud, as I folded up these words; &ldquo;he reckoned without  you, George. By to-morrow he will be in the hands of the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  fellow?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Better say &lsquo;Poor Miss Challoner!&rsquo; They tell me she was  one of those perfect women who reconcile even the pessimist to humanity and the  age we live in. Why any one should want to kill her is a mystery; but why this  man should&mdash;There! no one professes to explain it. They simply go by the facts.  To-morrow surely must bring strange revelations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  with this sentence ringing in my mind, I lay down and endeavoured to sleep. But  it was not till very late that rest came. The noise of passing feet, though  muffled beyond their wont, roused me in spite of myself. These footsteps might  be those of some late arrival, or they might be those of some wary detective  intent on business far removed from the usual routine of life in this great  hotel.</p>
  <p>I  recalled the glimpse I had had of the writing-room in the early evening, and  imagined it as it was with Miss Challoner&rsquo;s body removed and the incongruous  flitting of strange and busy figures across its fatal floors, measuring  distances and peering into corners, while hundreds slept above and about them  in undisturbed repose.</p>
  <p>Then  I thought of <i>him</i>, the suspected and possibly guilty one. In visions over which  I had little if any control, I saw him in all the restlessness of a slowly  dying down excitement&mdash;the surroundings strange and unknown to me, the figure  not&mdash;seeking for quiet; facing the past; facing the future; knowing, perhaps,  for the first time in his life what it was for crime and remorse to murder  sleep. I could not think of him as lying still&mdash;slumbering like the rest of  mankind, in the hope and expectation of a busy morrow. Crime perpetrated looms  so large in the soul, and this man had a soul as big as his body; of that I was  assured. That its instincts were cruel and inherently evil, did not lessen its  capacity for suffering. And he was suffering now; I could not doubt it,  remembering the lovely face and fragrant memory of the noble woman he had,  under some unknown impulse, sent to an unmerited doom.</p>
  <p>At  last I slept, but it was only to rouse again with the same quick realisation of  my surroundings, which I had experienced on my recovery from my fainting fit of  hours before. Someone had stopped at our door before hurrying by down the hall.  Who was that someone? I rose on my elbow, and endeavoured to peer through the  dark. Of course, I could see nothing. But when I woke a second time, there was  enough light in the room, early as it undoubtedly was, for me to detect a  letter lying on the carpet just inside the door.</p>
  <p>Instantly  I was on my feet. Catching the letter up, I carried it to the window. Our two  names were on it&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. George Anderson: the writing, Mr. Slater&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>I  glanced over at George. He was sleeping peacefully. It was too early to wake  him, but I could not lay that letter down unread; was not my name on it?  Tearing it open, I devoured its contents,&mdash;the exclamation I made on reading it,  waking George.</p>
  <p>The  writing was in Mr. Slater&rsquo;s hand, and the words were:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I must request, at the instance of Coroner Heath and  such of the police as listened to your adventure, that you make no further  mention of what you saw in the street under our windows last night. The doctors  find no bullet in the wound. This clears Mr. Brotherson.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
    Sweet Little Miss Clarke</b></h2>
  <p>When  we took our seats at the breakfast-table, it was with the feeling of being no  longer looked upon as connected in any way with this case. Yet our interest in  it was, if anything, increased, and when I saw George casting furtive glances  at a certain table behind me, I leaned over and asked him the reason, being  sure that the people whose faces I saw reflected in the mirror directly before  us had something to do with the great matter then engrossing us. His answer  conveyed the somewhat exciting information that the four persons seated in my  rear were the same four who had been reading at the round table in the  mezzanine at the time of Miss Challoner&rsquo;s death.</p>
  <p>Instantly  they absorbed all my attention, though I dared not give them a direct look, and  continued to observe them only in the glass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it one family?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and a very respectable one. Transients, of course, but very well known in  Denver. The lady is not the mother of the boys, but their aunt. The boys belong  to the gentleman, who is a widower.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Their  word ought to be good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>George  nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  boys look wide-awake enough if the father does not. As for the aunt, she is  sweetness itself. Do they still insist that Miss Challoner was the only person  in the room with them at this time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  did last night. I don&rsquo;t know how they will meet this statement of the  doctor&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;George?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  leaned nearer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you ever thought that she might have been a suicide? That she stabbed herself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  for in that case a weapon would have been found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  are you sure that none was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Positive.  Such a fact could not have been kept quiet. If a weapon had been picked up  there would be no mystery, and no necessity for further police investigation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the detectives are still here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  just saw one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;George?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  his head came nearer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  they searched the lobby? I believe she had a weapon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Laura!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it sounds foolish, but the alternative is so improbable. A family like  that cannot be leagued together in a conspiracy to hide the truth concerning a  matter so serious. To be sure, they may all be short-sighted, or so little  given to observation that they didn&rsquo;t see what passed before their eyes. The  boys look wide-awake enough, but who can tell? I would sooner believe that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  stopped short so suddenly that George looked startled. My attention had been  caught by something new I saw in the mirror upon which my attention was fixed.  A man was looking in from the corridor behind, at the four persons we were just  discussing. He was watching them intently, and I thought I knew his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  kind of a looking person was the man who took you outside last night?&rdquo; I  inquired of George, with my eyes still on this furtive watcher.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  fellow to make you laugh. A perfect character, Laura; hideously homely but  agreeable enough. I took quite a fancy to him. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am looking at him now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  likely. He&rsquo;s deep in this affair. Just an everyday detective, but ambitious, I  suppose, and quite alive to the importance of being thorough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is watching those people. No, he isn&rsquo;t. How quickly he disappeared!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he&rsquo;s mercurial in all his movements. Laura, we must get out of this. There  happens to be something else in the world for me to do than to sit around and  follow up murder clews.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  we began to doubt if others agreed with him, when on passing out we were  stopped in the lobby by this same detective, who had something to say to  George, and drew him quickly aside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does he want?&rdquo; I asked, as soon as George had returned to my side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  wants me to stand ready to obey any summons the police may send me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  they still suspect Brotherson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  must.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  head rose a trifle as I glanced up at George.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we are <i>not</i> altogether out of it?&rdquo; I emphasised, complacently.</p>
  <p>He  smiled which hardly seemed <i>&agrave; propos</i>. Why does George sometimes smile when I am  in my most serious moods.</p>
  <p>As  we stepped out of the hotel, George gave my arm a quiet pinch which served to  direct my attention to an elderly gentleman who, was just alighting from a  taxicab at the kerb. He moved heavily and with some appearance of pain, but  from the crowd collected on the sidewalk many of whom nudged each other as he  passed, he was evidently a person of some importance, and as he disappeared  within the hotel entrance, I asked George who this kind-faced, bright-eyed old  gentleman could be.</p>
  <p>He  appeared to know, for he told me at once that he was Detective Gryce; a man who  had grown old in solving just such baffling problems as these.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  gave up work some time ago, I have been told,&rdquo; my husband went on; &ldquo;but  evidently a great case still has its allurement for him. The trail here must be  a very blind one for them to call him in. I wish we had not left so soon. It  would have been quite an experience to see him at work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt if you would have been given the opportunity. I noticed that we were  slightly <i>de trop</i> towards the last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t have minded that; not on my own account, that is. It might not have  been pleasant for you. However, the office is waiting. Come, let me put you on  the car.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  night I bided his coming with an impatience I could not control. He was late,  of course, but when he did appear, I almost forgot our usual greeting in my  hurry to ask him if he had seen the evening papers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  he grumbled, as he hung up his overcoat. &ldquo;Been pushed about all day. No time  for anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  let me tell you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  he would have dinner first.</p>
  <p>However,  a little later we had a comfortable chat. Mr. Gryce had made a discovery, and  the papers were full of it. It was one which gave me a small triumph over  George. The suggestion he had laughed at was not so entirely foolish as he had  been pleased to consider it. But let me tell the story of that day, without any  further reference to myself.</p>
  <p>The  opinion had become quite general with those best acquainted with the details of  this affair, that the mystery was one of those abnormal ones for which no  solution would ever be found, when the aged detective showed himself in the  building and was taken to the room, where an Inspector of Police awaited him.  Their greeting was cordial, and the lines on the latter&rsquo;s face relaxed a little  as he met the still bright eye of the man upon whose instinct and judgment so  much reliance had always been placed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is very good of you,&rdquo; he began, glancing down at the aged detective&rsquo;s bundled  up legs, and gently pushing a chair towards him. &ldquo;I know that it was a great  deal to ask, but we&rsquo;re at our wits&rsquo; end, and so I telephoned. It&rsquo;s the most  inexplicable&mdash;There! you have heard that phrase before. But clews&mdash;there are  absolutely none. That is, we have not been able to find any. Perhaps you can.  At least, that is what we hope. I&rsquo;ve known you more than once to succeed where  others have failed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  elderly man thus addressed, glanced down at his legs, now propped up on a stool  which someone had brought him, and smiled, with the pathos of the old who sees  the interests of a lifetime slipping gradually away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not what I was. I can no longer get down on my hands and knees to pick up  threads from the nap of a rug, or spy out a spot of blood in the crimson woof  of a carpet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall have Sweetwater here to do the active work for you. What we want of you  is the directing mind&mdash;the infallible instinct. It&rsquo;s a case in a thousand,  Gryce. We&rsquo;ve never had anything just like it. <i>You&rsquo;ve</i> never had anything at all  like it. It will make you young again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old man&rsquo;s eyes shot fire and unconsciously one foot slipped to the floor. Then  he bethought himself and painfully lifted it back again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are the points? What&rsquo;s the difficulty?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;A woman has been shot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  not shot, stabbed. We thought she had been shot, for that was intelligible and  involved no impossibilities. But Drs. Heath and Webster, under the eye of the  Challoners&rsquo; own physician, have made an examination of the wound&mdash;an official  one, thorough and quite final so far as they are concerned, and they declare  that no bullet is to be found in the body. As the wound extends no further than  the heart, this settles one great point, at least.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Heath is a reliable man and one of our ablest coroners.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  There can be no question as to the truth of his report. You know the victim?  Her name, I mean, and the character she bore?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  so much was told me on my way down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  fine girl unspoiled by riches and seeming independence. Happy, too, to all  appearance, or we should be more ready to consider the possibility of suicide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suicide  by stabbing calls for a weapon. Yet none has been found, I hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  she was killed that way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly,  and by a long and very narrow blade, larger than a needle but not so large as  the ordinary stiletto.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stabbed  while by herself, or what you may call by herself? She had no companion near  her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None,  if we can believe the four members of the Parrish family who were seated at the  other end of the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you do believe them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  a whole family lie&mdash;and needlessly? They never knew the woman&mdash;father, maiden  aunt and two boys, clear-eyed, jolly young chaps whom even the horror of this  tragedy, perpetrated as it were under their very nose, cannot make serious for  more than a passing moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wouldn&rsquo;t seem so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  they swear up and down that nobody crossed the room towards Miss Challoner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  they tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  fell just a few feet from the desk where she had been writing. No word, no cry,  just a collapse and sudden fall. In olden days they would have said, struck by  a bolt from heaven. But it was a bolt which drew blood; not much blood, I hear,  but sufficient to end life almost instantly. She never looked up or spoke  again. What do you make of it, Gryce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a tough one, and I&rsquo;m not ready to venture an opinion yet. I should like to see  the desk you speak of, and the spot where she fell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  young fellow who had been hovering in the background at once stepped forward.  He was the plain-faced detective who had spoken to George.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you take my arm, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce&rsquo;s whole face brightened. This Sweetwater, as they called him, was, I have  since understood, one of his proteges and more or less of a favourite.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you had a chance at this thing?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Been over the ground&mdash;studied the  affair carefully?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir; they were good enough to allow it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, then, you&rsquo;re in a position to pioneer me. You&rsquo;ve seen it all and won&rsquo;t be  in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I&rsquo;m at the end of my rope. I haven&rsquo;t an idea, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  well, that&rsquo;s honest at all events.&rdquo; Then, as he slowly rose with the other&rsquo;s  careful assistance, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s <i>no</i> crime without its clew. The thing is to  recognise that clew when seen. But I&rsquo;m in no position, to make promises. Old  days don&rsquo;t return for the asking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nevertheless,  he looked ten years younger than when he came in, or so thought those who knew  him.</p>
  <p>The  mezzanine was guarded from all visitors save such as had official sanction.  Consequently, the two remained quite uninterrupted while they moved about the  place in quiet consultation. Others had preceded them; had examined the plain  little desk and found nothing; had paced off the distances; had looked with  longing and inquiring eyes at the elevator cage and the open archway leading to  the little staircase and the musicians&rsquo; gallery. But this was nothing to the  old detective. The locale was what he wanted, and he got it. Whether he got  anything else it would be impossible to say from his manner as he finally sank  into a chair by one of the openings, and looked down on the lobby below. It was  full of people coming and going on all sorts of business, and presently he drew  back, and, leaning on Sweetwater&rsquo;s arm, asked him a few questions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  were the first to rush in here after the Parrishes gave the alarm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  or two of the musicians from the end of the hall. They had just finished their  programme and were preparing to leave the gallery. Naturally they reached her  first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  their names?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mark  Sowerby and Claus Hennerberg. Honest Germans&mdash;men who have played here for  years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  who followed them? Who came next on the scene?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  people from the lobby. They heard the disturbance and rushed up pell-mell. But  not one of these touched her. Later her father came.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  did touch her? Anybody, before the father came in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  Miss Clarke, the middle-aged lady with the Parrishes. She had run towards Miss  Challoner as soon as she heard her fall, and was sitting there with the dead  girl&rsquo;s head in her lap when the musicians showed themselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose she has been carefully questioned?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very,  I should say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she speaks of no weapon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Neither she nor any one else at that moment suspected murder or even a violent  death. All thought it a natural one&mdash;sudden, but the result of some secret  disease.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father  and all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the blood? Surely there must have been some show of blood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  say not. No one noticed any. Not till the doctor came&mdash;her doctor who was  happily in his office in this very building. He saw the drops, and uttered the  first suggestion of murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  long after was this? Is there any one who has ventured to make an estimate of  the number of minutes which elapsed from the time she fell, to the moment when  the doctor first raised the cry of murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Mr. Slater, the assistant manager, who was in the lobby at the time, says that  ten minutes at least must have elapsed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten  minutes and no blood! The weapon must still have been there. Some weapon with a  short and inconspicuous handle. I think they said there were flowers over and  around the place where it struck?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  great big scarlet ones. Nobody noticed&mdash;nobody looked. A panic like that seems  to paralyse people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten  minutes! I must see every one who approached her during those ten minutes.  Every one, Sweetwater, and I must myself talk with Miss Clarke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will like her. You will believe every word she says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt. All the more reason why I must see her. Sweetwater, someone drew that  weapon out. Effects still have their causes, notwithstanding the new cult. The  question is who? We must leave no stone unturned to find that out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  stones have all been turned over once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  altogether by me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  they will bear being turned over again. I want to be witness of the operation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  will you see Miss Clarke?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wherever  she pleases&mdash;only I can&rsquo;t walk far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I know the place. You shall have the use of this elevator. It has not  been running since last night or it would be full of curious people all the time,  hustling to get a glimpse of this place. But they&rsquo;ll put a man on for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good; manage it as you will. I&rsquo;ll wait here till you&rsquo;re ready. Explain yourself  to the lady. Tell her I&rsquo;m an old and rheumatic invalid who has been used to  asking his own questions. I&rsquo;ll not trouble her much. But there is one point she  must make clear to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  did not presume to ask what point, but he hoped to be fully enlightened when  the time came.</p>
  <p>And  he was. Mr. Gryce had undertaken to educate him for this work, and never missed  the opportunity of giving him a lesson. The three met in a private sitting-room  on an upper floor, the detectives entering first and the lady coming in soon  after. As her quiet figure appeared in the doorway, Sweetwater stole a glance  at Mr. Gryce. He was not looking her way, of course; he never looked directly  at anybody; but he formed his impressions for all that, and Sweetwater was  anxious to make sure of these impressions. There was no doubting them in this  instance. Miss Clarke was not a woman to rouse an unfavourable opinion in any  man&rsquo;s mind. Of slight, almost frail build, she had that peculiar animation  which goes with a speaking eye and a widely sympathetic nature. Without any  substantial claims to beauty, her expression was so womanly and so sweet that  she was invariably called lovely.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce was engaged at the moment in shifting his cane from the right hand to the  left, but his manner was never more encouraging or his smile more benevolent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me,&rdquo; he apologised, with one of his old-fashioned bows, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to trouble  you after all the distress you must have been under this morning. But there is  something I wish especially to ask you in regard to the dreadful occurrence in  which you played so kind a part. You were the first to reach the prostrate  woman, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  The boys jumped up and ran towards her, but they were frightened by her looks  and left it for me to put my hands under her and try to lift her up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you manage it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  succeeded in getting her head into my lap, nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  sat so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  some little time. That is, it seemed long, though I believe it was not more  than a minute before two men came running from the musicians&rsquo; gallery. One  thinks so fast at such a time&mdash;and feels so much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  knew she was dead, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  felt her to be so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  felt?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was sure&mdash;I never questioned it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have seen women in a faint?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  many times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  made the difference? Why should you believe Miss Challoner dead simply because  she lay still and apparently lifeless?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot tell you. Possibly, death tells its own story. I only know how I felt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  there was another reason? Perhaps, that, consciously or unconsciously, you laid  your palm upon her heart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Clarke started, and her sweet face showed a moment&rsquo;s perplexity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I?&rdquo; she queried, musingly. Then with a sudden access of feeling, &ldquo;I may have  done so, indeed, I believe I did. My arms were around her; it would not have  been an unnatural action.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  a very natural one, I should say. Cannot you tell me positively whether you did  this or not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I did. I had forgotten it, but I remember now.&rdquo; And the glance she cast him  while not meeting his eye showed that she understood the importance of the  admission. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what you are going to ask me now. Did I feel  anything there but the flowers and the tulle? No, Mr. Gryce, I did not. There  was no poniard in the wound.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce felt around, found a chair and sank into it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a truthful woman,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And,&rdquo; he added more slowly, &ldquo;composed enough  in character I should judge not to have made any mistake on this very vital  point.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so, Mr. Gryce. I was in a state of excitement, of course; but the woman  was a stranger to me, and my feelings were not unduly agitated.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sweetwater,  we can let my suggestion go in regard to those ten minutes I spoke of. The time  is narrowed down to one, and in that one, Miss Clarke was the only person to  touch her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  only one,&rdquo; echoed the lady, catching perhaps the slight rising sound of query  in his voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will trouble you no further.&rdquo; So said the old detective, thoughtfully.  &ldquo;Sweetwater, help me out of this.&rdquo; His eye was dull and his manner betrayed  exhaustion. But vigour returned to him before he had well reached the door, and  he showed some of his old spirit as he thanked Miss Clarke and turned to take  the elevator.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  one possibility remains,&rdquo; he confided to Sweetwater, as they stood waiting at  the elevator door. &ldquo;Miss Challoner died from a stab. The next minute she was in  this lady&rsquo;s arms. No weapon protruded from the wound, nor was any found on or  near her in the mezzanine. What follows? She struck the blow herself, and the  strength of purpose which led her to do this, gave her the additional force to  pull the weapon out and fling it from her. It did not fall upon the floor  around her; therefore, it flew through one of those openings into the lobby,  and there it either will be, or has been found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was this statement, otherwise worded, which gave me my triumph over George.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_5"></a><b>Chapter 5<br>
    The Red Cloak</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;What  results? Speak up, Sweetwater.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None.  Every man, woman and boy connected with the hotel has been questioned; many of  them routed out of their beds for the purpose, but not one of them picked up  anything from the floor of the lobby, or knows of any one who did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  now remain the guests.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  after them&mdash;(pardon me, Mr. Gryce) the general public which rushed in rather  promiscuously last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it; it&rsquo;s a task, but it must be carried through. Put up bulletins, publish  your wants in the papers;&mdash;do anything, only gain your end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  bulletin was put up.</p>
  <p>Some  hours later, Sweetwater re-entered the room, and, approaching Mr. Gryce with a  smile, blurted out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  bulletin is a great go. I think&mdash;of course, I cannot be sure&mdash;that it&rsquo;s going to  do the business. I&rsquo;ve watched every one who stopped to read it. Many showed  interest and many, emotion; she seems to have had a troop of friends. But  embarrassment! only one showed that. I thought you would like to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Embarrassment?  Humph! a man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  a woman; a lady, sir; one of the transients. I found out in a jiffy all they  could tell me about her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  woman! We didn&rsquo;t expect that. Where is she? Still in the lobby?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir. She took the elevator while I was talking with the clerk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  nothing in it. You mistook her expression.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so. I had noticed her when she first came into the lobby. She was  talking to her daughter who was with her, and looked natural and happy. But no  sooner had she seen and read that bulletin, than the blood shot up into her  face and her manner became furtive and hasty. There was no mistaking the  difference, sir. Almost before I could point her out, she had seized her  daughter by the arm and hurried her towards the elevator. I wanted to follow  her, but you may prefer to make your own inquiries. Her room is on the seventh  floor, number 712, and her name is Watkins. Mrs. Horace Watkins of Nashville.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce nodded thoughtfully, but made no immediate effort to rise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that all you know about her?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  this is the first time she has stopped at this hotel. She came yesterday. Took  a room indefinitely. Seems all right; but she did blush, sir. I ever saw its  beat in a young girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call  the desk. Say that I&rsquo;m to be told if Mrs. Watkins of Nashville rings up during  the next ten minutes. We&rsquo;ll give her that long to take some action. If she  fails to make any move, I&rsquo;ll make my own approaches.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  did as he was bid, then went back to his place in the lobby.</p>
  <p>But  he returned almost instantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Watkins has just telephoned down that she is going to&mdash;to<i> leave</i>, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>To  leave?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old man struggled to his feet. &ldquo;No. 712, do you say? Seven stories,&rdquo; he sighed.  But as he turned with a hobble, he stopped. &ldquo;There are difficulties in the way  of this interview,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;A blush is not much to go upon. I&rsquo;m afraid we  shall have to resort to the shadow business and that is your work, not mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  here the door opened and a boy brought in a line which had been left at the  desk. It related to the very matter then engaging them, and ran thus:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I see that information is desired as to whether any  person was seen to stoop to the lobby floor last night at or shortly after the  critical moment of Miss Challoner&rsquo;s fall in the half story above. I can give  such information. I was in the lobby at the time, and in the height of the  confusion following this alarming incident, I remember seeing a lady,&mdash;one of  the new arrivals (there were several coming in at the time)&mdash;stoop quickly down and  pick up something from the floor. I thought nothing of it at the time, and so  paid little attention to her appearance. I can only recall the suddenness with  which she stooped and the colour of the cloak she wore. It was red, and the  whole garment was voluminous. If you wish further particulars, though in truth,  I have no more to give, you can find me in 356.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;HENRY A. MCELROY.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  This should simplify our task,&rdquo; was Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s comment, as he handed the note  over to Sweetwater. &ldquo;You can easily find out if the lady, now on the point of  departure, can be identified with the one described by Mr. McElroy. If she can,  I am ready to meet her anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  goes then!&rdquo; cried Sweetwater, and quickly left the room.</p>
  <p>When  he returned, it was not with his most hopeful air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  cloak doesn&rsquo;t help,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;No one remembers the cloak. But the time of  Mrs. Watkins&rsquo; arrival was all right. She came in directly on the heels of this  catastrophe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did! Sweetwater, I will see her. Manage it for me at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  clerk says that it had better be upstairs. She is a very sensitive woman. There  might be a scene, if she were intercepted on her way out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well.&rdquo; But the look which the old detective threw at his bandaged legs was not  without its pathos.</p>
  <p>And  so it happened that just as Mrs. Watkins was watching the wheeling out of her  trunks, there appeared in the doorway before her, an elderly gentleman, whose  expression, always benevolent, save at moments when benevolence would be quite  out of keeping with the situation, had for some reason, so marked an effect  upon her, that she coloured under his eye, and, indeed, showed such  embarrassment, that all doubt of the propriety of his intrusion vanished from  the old man&rsquo;s mind, and with the ease of one only too well accustomed to such  scenes, he kindly remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am  I speaking to Mrs. Watkins of Nashville?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are,&rdquo; she faltered, with another rapid change of colour. &ldquo;I&mdash;I am just leaving.  I hope you will excuse me. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I could,&rdquo; he smiled, hobbling in and confronting her quietly in her own  room. &ldquo;But circumstances make it quite imperative that I should have a few  words with you on a topic which need not be disagreeable to you, and probably  will not be. My name is Gryce. This will probably convey nothing to you, but I  am not unknown to the management below, and my years must certainly give you  confidence in the propriety of my errand. A beautiful and charming young woman  died here last night. May I ask if you knew her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo;  She was trembling violently now, but whether with indignation or some other  more subtle emotion, it would be difficult to say. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m from the South. I  never saw the young lady. Why do you ask? I do not recognise your right. I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Certainly  her emotion must be that of simple indignation. Mr. Gryce made one of his low  bows, and propping himself against the table he stood before, remarked  civilly:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had rather not force my rights. The matter is so very ordinary. I did not  suppose you knew Miss Challoner, but one must begin somehow, and as you came in  at the very moment when the alarm was raised in the lobby, I thought perhaps  you could tell me something which would aid me in my effort to elicit the real  facts of the case. You were crossing the lobby at the time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  She raised her head. &ldquo;So were a dozen others&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo;&mdash;the  interruption was made in his kindliest tones, but in a way which nevertheless  suggested authority. &ldquo;Something was picked up from the floor at that moment. If  the dozen you mention were witnesses to this act we do not know it. But we do  know that it did not pass unobserved by you. Am I not correct? Didn&rsquo;t you see a  certain person&mdash;I will mention no names&mdash;stoop and pick up something from the  lobby floor?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;  The word came out with startling violence. &ldquo;I was conscious of nothing but the  confusion.&rdquo; She was facing him with determination and her eyes were fixed  boldly on his face. But her lips quivered, and her cheeks were white, too white  now for simple indignation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I have made a big mistake,&rdquo; apologised the ever-courteous detective. &ldquo;Will you  pardon me? It would have settled a very serious question if it could be found  that the object thus picked up was the weapon which killed Miss Challoner. That  is my excuse for the trouble I have given you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was not looking at her; he was looking at her hand which rested on the table  before which he himself stood. Did the fingers tighten a little and dig into  the palm they concealed? He thought so, and was very slow in turning limpingly  about towards the door. Meanwhile, would she speak? No. The silence was so  marked, he felt it an excuse for stealing another glance in her direction. She  was not looking his way but at a door in the partition wall on her right; and  the look was one very akin to anxious fear. The next moment he understood it. The  door burst open, and a young girl bounded into the room, with the merry cry:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  ready, mother. I&rsquo;m glad we are going to the Clarendon. I hate hotels where  people die almost before your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  the mother said at this outburst is immaterial. What the detective did is not.  Keeping on his way, he reached the door, but not to open it wider; rather to  close it softly but with unmistakable decision. The cloak which enveloped the  girl was red, and full enough to be called voluminous.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is this?&rdquo; demanded the girl, her indignant glances flashing from one to the  other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; faltered the mother in very evident distress. &ldquo;He says he has a  right to ask us questions and he has been asking questions about&mdash;about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  about me,&rdquo; laughed the girl, with a toss of her head Mr. Gryce would have  corrected in one of his grandchildren. &ldquo;He can have nothing to say about me.&rdquo;  And she began to move about the room in an aimless, half-insolent way.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce stared hard at the few remaining belongings of the two women, lying in a  heap on the table, and half musingly, half deprecatingly, remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  person who stooped wore a long red cloak. Probably you preceded your daughter,  Mrs. Watkins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  lady thus brought to the point made a quick gesture towards the girl who  suddenly stood still, and, with a rising colour in her cheeks, answered, with  some show of resolution on her own part:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  say your name is Gryce and that you have a right to address me thus pointedly  on a subject which you evidently regard as serious. That is not exact enough  for me. Who are you, sir? What is your business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you have guessed it. I am a detective from Headquarters. What I want of  you I have already stated. Perhaps this young lady can tell me what you cannot.  I shall be pleased if this is so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Caroline&rdquo;&mdash;Then  the mother broke down. &ldquo;Show the gentleman what you picked up from the lobby  floor last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl laughed again, loudly and with evident bravado, before she threw the cloak  back and showed what she had evidently been holding in her hand from the first,  a sharp-pointed, gold-handled paper-cutter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was lying there and I picked it up. I don&rsquo;t see any harm in that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  probably meant none. You couldn&rsquo;t have known the part it had just played in  this tragic drama,&rdquo; said the old detective looking carefully at the cutter  which he had taken in his hand, but not so carefully that he failed to note  that the look of distress was not lifted from the mother&rsquo;s face either by her  daughter&rsquo;s words or manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have washed this?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Why should I wash it? It was clean enough. I was just going down to give it in  at the desk. I wasn&rsquo;t going to carry it away.&rdquo; And she turned aside to the  window and began to hum, as though done with the whole matter.</p>
  <p>The  old detective rubbed his chin, glanced again at the paper-cutter, then at the  girl in the window, and lastly at the mother, who had lifted her head again and  was facing him bravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is very important,&rdquo; he observed to the latter, &ldquo;that your daughter should be  correct in her statement as to the condition of this article when she picked it  up. Are you sure she did not wash it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think she did. But I&rsquo;m sure she will tell you the truth about that.  Caroline, this is a police matter. Any mistake about it may involve us in a  world of trouble and keep you from getting back home in time for your  coming-out party. Did you&mdash;did you wash this cutter when you got upstairs,  or&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo; she added, with a propitiatory glance at Mr. Gryce&mdash;&ldquo;wipe it off at any  time between then and now? Don&rsquo;t answer hastily. Be sure. No one can blame you  for that act. Any girl, as thoughtless as you, might do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother,  how can I tell what I did?&rdquo; flashed out the girl, wheeling round on her heel  till she faced them both. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember doing a thing to it. I just brought  it up. A thing found like that belongs to the finder. You needn&rsquo;t hold it out  towards me like that. I don&rsquo;t want it now; I&rsquo;m sick of it. Such a lot of talk  about a paltry thing which couldn&rsquo;t have cost ten dollars.&rdquo; And she wheeled  back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t the value.&rdquo; Mr. Gryce could be very patient. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fact that we  believe it to have been answerable for Miss Challoner&rsquo;s death&mdash;that is, if there  was any blood on it when you picked it up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blood!&rdquo;  The girl was facing them again, astonishment struggling with disgust on her  plain but mobile features. &ldquo;Blood! is that what you mean. No wonder I hate it.  Take it away,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  mother, I&rsquo;ll never pick up anything again which doesn&rsquo;t belong to me! Blood!&rdquo;  she repeated in horror, flinging herself into her mother&rsquo;s arms.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce thought he understood the situation. Here was a little kleptomaniac whose  weakness the mother was struggling to hide. Light was pouring in. He felt his  body&rsquo;s weight less on that miserable foot of his.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  that frighten you? Are you so affected by the thought of blood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  ask me. And I put the thing under my pillow! I thought it was so&mdash;so pretty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Watkins,&rdquo; Mr. Gryce from that moment ignored the daughter, &ldquo;did you see it  there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but I didn&rsquo;t know where it came from. I had not seen my daughter stoop. I  didn&rsquo;t know where she got it till I read that bulletin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind that. The question agitating me is whether any stain was left under that  pillow. We want to be sure of the connection between this possible weapon and  the death by stabbing which we all deplore&mdash;if there is a connection.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t see any stain, but you can look for yourself. The bed has been made up,  but there was no change of linen. We expected to remain here; I see no good to  be gained by hiding any of the facts now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  whatever, Madam.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  then. Caroline, sit down and stop crying. Mr. Gryce believes that your only  fault was in not taking this object at once to the desk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; acquiesced the detective after a short study of the shaking figure  and distorted features of the girl. &ldquo;You had no idea, I&rsquo;m sure, where this  weapon came from, or for what it had been used. That&rsquo;s evident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  shudder, as she seated herself, was very convincing. She was too young to  simulate so successfully emotions of this character.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad of that,&rdquo; she responded, half fretfully, half gratefully, as Mr. Gryce  followed her mother into the adjoining room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a bad enough time of it  without being blamed for what I didn&rsquo;t know and didn&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce laid little stress upon these words, but much upon the lack of curiosity  she showed in the minute and careful examination he now made of her room. There  was no stain on the pillow-cover and none on the bureau-spread where she might  very naturally have laid the cutter down on first coming into her room. The  blade was so polished that it must have been rubbed off somewhere, either  purposely or by accident. Where then, since not here? He asked to see her  gloves&mdash;the ones she had worn the previous night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are the same she is wearing now,&rdquo; the anxious mother assured him. &ldquo;Wait, and I  will get them for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  need. Let her hold out her hands in token of amity. I shall soon see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  returned to where the girl still sat, wrapped in her cloak, sobbing still, but  not so violently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Caroline,  you may take off your things,&rdquo; said the mother, drawing the pins from her own  hat. &ldquo;We shall not go to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  child shot her mother one disappointed look, then proceeded to follow suit.  When her hat was off, she began to take off her gloves. As soon as they were on  the table, the mother pushed them over to Mr. Gryce. As he looked at them, the  girl lifted off her cloak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will&mdash;will  he tell?&rdquo; she whispered behind its ample folds into her mother&rsquo;s ear.</p>
  <p>The  answer came quickly, but not in the mother&rsquo;s tones. Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s ears had lost  none of their ancient acuteness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not see that I should gain much by doing so. The one discovery which would  link this find of yours indissolubly with Miss Challoner&rsquo;s death, I have failed  to make. If I am equally unsuccessful below&mdash;if I can establish no closer  connection there than here between this cutter and the weapon which killed Miss  Challoner, I shall have no cause to mention the matter. It will be too extraneous  to the case. Do you remember the exact spot where you stooped, Miss Watkins?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no. Somewhere near those big chairs; I didn&rsquo;t have to step out of my way; I  really didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce&rsquo;s answering smile was a study. It seemed to convey a two-fold message,  one for the mother and one for the child, and both were comforting. But he went  away, disappointed. The clew which promised so much was, to all appearance, a  false one.</p>
  <p>He  could soon tell.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_6"></a><b>Chapter 6<br>
    Integrity</b></h2>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce&rsquo;s fears were only too well founded. Though Mr. McElroy was kind enough to  point out the exact spot where he saw Miss Watkins stoop, no trace of blood was  found upon the rug which had lain there, nor had anything of the kind been  washed up by the very careful man who scrubbed the lobby floor in the early  morning. This was disappointing, as its presence would have settled the whole  question. When, these efforts all exhausted, the two detectives faced each  other again in the small room given up to their use, Mr. Gryce showed his  discouragement. To be certain of a fact you cannot prove has not the same  alluring quality for the old that it has for the young. Sweetwater watched him  in some concern, then with the persistence which was one of his strong points,  ventured finally to remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have but one idea left on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what is that?&rdquo; Old as he was, Mr. Gryce was alert in a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  girl wore a red cloak. If I mistake not, the lining was also red. A spot on it  might not show to the casual observer. Yet it would mean much to us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sweetwater!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  faint blush rose to the old man&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I request the privilege of looking that garment over?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young fellow ducked and left the room. When he returned, it was with a downcast  air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  doing,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>And  then there was silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  only need to find out now that this cutter was not even Miss Challoner&rsquo;s  property,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Gryce, at last, with a gesture towards the object  named, lying openly on the table before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  should be easy. Shall I take it to their rooms and show it to her maid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you can do so without disturbing the old gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  here they were themselves disturbed. A knock at the door was followed by the  immediate entrance of the very person just mentioned. Mr. Challoner had come in  search of the inspector, and showed some surprise to find his place occupied by  an unknown old man.</p>
  <p>But  Mr. Gryce, who discerned tidings in the bereaved father&rsquo;s face, was all  alacrity in an instant. Greeting his visitor with a smile which few could see  without trusting the man, he explained the inspector&rsquo;s absence and introduced  himself in his own capacity.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Challoner had heard of him. Nevertheless, he did not seem inclined to speak.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce motioned Sweetwater from the room. With a woeful look the young detective  withdrew, his last glance cast at the cutter still lying in full view on the  table.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce, not unmindful himself of this object, took it up, then laid it down  again, with an air of seeming abstraction.</p>
  <p>The  father&rsquo;s attention was caught.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is that?&rdquo; he cried, advancing a step and bestowing more than an ordinary glance  at the object thus brought casually, as it were, to his notice. &ldquo;I surely  recognise this cutter. Does it belong here or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce, observing the other&rsquo;s emotion, motioned him to a chair. As his visitor  sank into it, he remarked, with all the consideration exacted by the situation:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is unknown property, Mr. Challoner. But we have some reason to think it  belonged to your daughter. Are we correct in this surmise?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have seen it, or one like it, often in her hand.&rdquo; Here his eyes suddenly  dilated and the hand stretched forth to grasp it quickly drew back.  &ldquo;Where&mdash;where was it found?&rdquo; he hoarsely demanded. &ldquo;O God! am I to be crushed to  the very earth by sorrow!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce hastened to give him such relief as was consistent with the truth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was picked up&mdash;last night&mdash;from the lobby floor. There is seemingly nothing to  connect it with her death. Yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  pause was eloquent. Mr. Challoner gave the detective an agonised look and turned  white to the lips. Then gradually, as the silence continued, his head fell  forward, and he muttered almost unintelligibly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  honestly believe her the victim of some heartless stranger. I do now; but&mdash;but I  cannot mislead the police. At any cost I must retract a statement I made under  false impressions and with no desire to deceive. I said that I knew all of the  gentlemen who admired her and aspired to her hand, and that they were all  reputable men and above committing a crime of this or any other kind. But it  seems that I did not know her secret heart as thoroughly as I had supposed.  Among her effects I have just come upon a batch of letters&mdash;love letters I am  forced to acknowledge&mdash;signed by initials totally strange to me. The letters are  manly in tone&mdash;most of them&mdash;but one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  about the one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shows  that the writer was displeased. It may mean nothing, but I could not let the  matter go without setting myself right with the authorities. If it might be  allowed to rest here&mdash;if those letters can remain sacred, it would save me the  additional pang of seeing her inmost concerns&mdash;the secret and holiest recesses  of a woman&rsquo;s heart, laid open to the public. For, from the tenor of most of  these letters, she&mdash;she was not averse to the writer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce moved a little restlessly in his chair and stared hard at the cutter so  conveniently placed under his eye. Then his manner softened and he remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will do what we can. But you must understand that the matter is not a simple  one. That, in fact, it contains mysteries which demand police investigation. We  do not dare to trifle with any of the facts. The inspector, and, if not he, the  coroner, will have to be told about these letters and will probably ask to see  them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are the letters of a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  the one exception.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that is understood.&rdquo; Then in a sudden heat and with an almost sublime trust in  his daughter notwithstanding the duplicity he had just discovered:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing&mdash;not  the story told by these letters, or the sight of that sturdy paper-cutter with  its long and very slender blade, will make me believe that she willingly took  her own life. You do not know, cannot know, the rare delicacy of her nature.  She was a lady through and through. If she had meditated death&mdash;if the breach  suggested by the one letter I have mentioned, should have so preyed upon her  spirits as to lead her to break her old father&rsquo;s heart and outrage the feelings  of all who knew her, she could not, being the woman she was, choose a public  place for such an act&mdash;an hotel writing-room&mdash;in face of a lobby full of hurrying  men. It was out of nature. Every one who knows her will tell you so. The deed  was an accident&mdash;incredible&mdash;but still an accident.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce had respect for this outburst. Making no attempt to answer it, he  suggested, with some hesitation, that Miss Challoner had been seen writing a  letter previous to taking those fatal steps from the desk which ended so  tragically. Was this letter to one of her lady friends, as reported, and was it  as far from suggesting the awful tragedy which followed, as he had been told?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a cheerful letter. Such a one as she often wrote to her little protegees  here and there. I judge that this was written to some girl like that, for the  person addressed was not known to her maid, any more than she was to me. It  expressed an affectionate interest, and it breathed  encouragement&mdash;<i>encouragement! and she meditating her own death at the moment!</i>  Impossible! That letter should exonerate her if nothing else does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce recalled the incongruities, the inconsistencies and even the surprising  contradictions which had often marked the conduct of men and women, in his  lengthy experience with the strange, the sudden, and the tragic things of life,  and slightly shook his head. He pitied Mr. Challoner, and admired even more his  courage in face of the appalling grief which had overwhelmed him, but he dared  not encourage a false hope. The girl had killed herself and with this weapon.  They might not be able to prove it absolutely, but it was nevertheless true, and  this broken old man would some day be obliged to acknowledge it. But the  detective said nothing of this, and was very patient with the further arguments  the other advanced to prove his point and the lofty character of the girl to  whom, misled by appearance, the police seemed inclined to attribute the awful  sin of self-destruction.</p>
  <p>But  when, this topic exhausted, Mr. Challoner rose to leave the room, Mr. Gryce  showed where his own thoughts still centred, by asking him the date of the  correspondence discovered between his daughter and her unknown admirer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  of the letters were dated last summer, some this fall. The one you are most  anxious to hear about only a month back,&rdquo; he added, with unconquerable devotion  to what he considered his duty.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce would like to have carried his inquiries further, but desisted. His heart  was full of compassion for this childless old man, doomed to have his choicest  memories disturbed by cruel doubts which possibly would never be removed to his  own complete satisfaction.</p>
  <p>But  when he was gone, and Sweetwater had returned, Mr. Gryce made it his first duty  to communicate to his superiors the hitherto unsuspected fact of a secret  romance in Miss Challoner&rsquo;s seemingly calm and well-guarded life. She had loved  and been loved by one of whom her family knew nothing. And the two had  quarrelled, as certain letters lately found could be made to show.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_7"></a><b>Chapter 7<br>
    The Letters</b></h2>
  <p>Before  a table strewn with papers, in the room we have already mentioned as given over  to the use of the police, sat Dr. Heath in a mood too thoughtful to notice the  entrance of Mr. Gryce and Sweetwater from the dining-room where they had been  having dinner.</p>
  <p>However  as the former&rsquo;s tread was somewhat lumbering, the coroner&rsquo;s attention was  caught before they had quite crossed the room, and Sweetwater, with his quick  eye, noted how his arm and hand immediately fell so as to cover up a portion of  the papers lying nearest to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  Gryce, this is a dark case,&rdquo; he observed, as at his bidding the two detectives  took their seats.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce nodded; so did Sweetwater.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  darkest that has ever come to my knowledge,&rdquo; pursued the coroner.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce again nodded; but not so, Sweetwater. For some reason this simple  expression of opinion seemed to have given him a mental start.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was not shot. She was not struck by any other hand; yet she lies dead from a  mortal wound in the breast. Though there is no tangible proof of her having  inflicted this wound upon herself, the jury will have no alternative, I fear,  than to pronounce the case one of suicide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry that I&rsquo;ve been able to do so little,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Gryce.</p>
  <p>The  coroner darted him a quick look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not satisfied? You have some different idea?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>The  detective frowned at his hands crossed over the top of his cane, then shaking  his head, replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  verdict you mention is the only natural one, of course. I see that you have  been talking with Miss Challoner&rsquo;s former maid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and she has settled an important point for us. There was a possibility, of course,  that the paper-cutter which you brought to my notice had never gone with her  into the mezzanine. That she, or some other person, had dropped it in passing  through the lobby. But this girl assures me that her mistress did not enter the  lobby that night. That she accompanied her down in the elevator, and saw her  step off at the mezzanine. She can also swear that the cutter was in a book she  carried&mdash;the book we found lying on the desk. The girl remembers distinctly  seeing its peculiarly chased handle projecting from its pages. Could anything  be more satisfactory if&mdash;I was going to say, if the young lady had been of the  impulsive type and the provocation greater. But Miss Challoner&rsquo;s nature was  calm, and were it not for these letters&mdash;&rdquo; here his arm shifted a little&mdash;&ldquo;I  should not be so sure of my jury&rsquo;s future verdict. Love&mdash;&rdquo; he went on, after a  moment of silent consideration of a letter he had chosen from those before him,  &ldquo;disturbs the most equable natures. When it enters as a factor, we can expect  anything&mdash;as you know. And Miss Challoner evidently was much attached to her  correspondent, and naturally felt the reproach conveyed in these lines.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  Dr. Heath read:</p>
  <p class="note"><i>&ldquo;Dear Miss Challoner:</i></p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Only a man of small spirit could endure what I  endured from you the other day. Love such as mine would be respectable in a clod-hopper,  and I think that even you will acknowledge that I stand somewhat higher than  that. Though I was silent under your disapprobation, you shall yet have your  answer. It will not lack point because of its necessary delay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  threat!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  words sprang from Sweetwater, and were evidently involuntary. Dr. Heath paid no  notice, but Mr. Gryce, in shifting his hands on his cane top, gave them a  sidelong look which was not without a hint of fresh interest in a case  concerning which he had believed himself to have said his last word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the only letter of them all which conveys anything like a reproach,&rdquo;  proceeded the coroner. &ldquo;The rest are ardent enough and, I must acknowledge  that, so far as I have allowed myself to look into them, sufficiently  respectful. Her surprise must consequently have been great at receiving these  lines, and her resentment equally so. If the two met afterwards&mdash;But I have not  shown you the signature. To the poor father it conveyed nothing&mdash;some facts have  been kept from him&mdash;but to us&mdash;&rdquo; here he whirled the letter about so that  Sweetwater, at least, could see the name, &ldquo;it conveys a hope that we may yet  understand Miss Challoner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brotherson!&rdquo;  exclaimed the young detective in loud surprise. &ldquo;Brotherson! The man who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man who left this building just before or simultaneously with the alarm caused  by Miss Challoner&rsquo;s fall. It clears away some of the clouds befogging us. She  probably caught sight of him in the lobby, and in the passion of the moment  forgot her usual instincts and drove the sharp-pointed weapon into her heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brotherson!&rdquo;  The word came softly now, and with a thoughtful intonation. &ldquo;He saw her die.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you say that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  he have washed his hands in the snow if he had been in ignorance of the  occurrence? He was the real, if not active, cause of her death and he knew it.  Either he&mdash;Excuse me, Dr. Heath and Mr. Gryce, it is not for me to obtrude my  opinion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you settled it beyond dispute that Brotherson is really the man who was seen  doing this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir. I have not had a minute for that job, but I&rsquo;m ready for the business any  time you see fit to spare me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  it be to-morrow, or, if you can manage it, to-night. We want the man even if he  is not the hero of that romantic episode. He wrote these letters, and he must  explain the last one. His initials, as you see, are not ordinary ones, and you  will find them at the bottom of all these sheets. He was brave enough or  arrogant enough to sign the questionable one with his full name. This may speak  well for him, and it may not. It is for you to decide that. Where will you look  for him, Sweetwater? No one here knows his address.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  Miss Challoner&rsquo;s maid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  the name is a new one to her. But she made it very evident that she was not  surprised to hear that her mistress was in secret correspondence with a member  of the male sex. Much can be hidden from servants, but not that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  find the man; I have a double reason for doing that now; he shall not escape  me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Heath expressed his satisfaction, and gave some orders. Meanwhile, Mr. Gryce  had not uttered a word.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_8"></a><b>Chapter 8<br>
    Strange Doings For George</b></h2>
  <p>That  evening George sat so long over the newspapers that in spite of my absorbing  interest in the topic engrossing me, I fell asleep in my cozy little rocking  chair. I was awakened by what seemed like a kiss falling very softly on my  forehead, though, to be sure, it may have been only the flap of George&rsquo;s coat  sleeve as he stooped over me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wake  up, little woman,&rdquo; I heard, &ldquo;and trot away to bed. I&rsquo;m going out and may not be  in till daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You!  going out! at ten o&rsquo;clock at night, tired as you are&mdash;as we both are! What has  happened&mdash;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  broken exclamation escaped me as I perceived in the dim background by the sitting-room  door, the figure of a man who called up recent, but very thrilling experiences.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Sweetwater,&rdquo; explained George. &ldquo;We are going out together. It is necessary, or  you may be sure I should not leave you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was quite wide awake enough by now to understand. &ldquo;Oh, I know. You are going to  hunt up the man. How I wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  George did not wait for me to express my wishes. He gave me a little good  advice as to how I had better employ my time in his absence, and was off before  I could find words to answer.</p>
  <p>This  ends all I have to say about myself; but the events of that night carefully  related to me by George are important enough for me to describe them, with all  the detail which is their rightful due. I shall tell the story as I have  already been led to do in other portions of this narrative, as though I were  present and shared the adventure.</p>
  <p>As  soon as the two were in the street, the detective turned towards George and  said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Anderson, I have a great deal to ask of you. The business before us is not a  simple one, and I fear that I shall have to subject you to more inconvenience  than is customary in matters like this. Mr. Brotherson has vanished; that is,  in his own proper person, but I have an idea that I am on the track of one who  will lead us very directly to him if we manage the affair carefully. What I  want of you, of course, is mere identification. You saw the face of the man who  washed his hands in the snow, and would know it again, you say. Do you think  you could be quite sure of yourself, if the man were differently dressed and  differently occupied?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so. There&rsquo;s his height and a certain strong look in his face. I cannot  describe it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t need to. Come! we&rsquo;re all right. You don&rsquo;t mind making a night of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  if it is necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  we can&rsquo;t tell <i>yet</i>.&rdquo; And with a characteristic shrug and smile, the detective  led the way to a taxicab which stood in waiting at the corner.</p>
  <p>A  quarter of an hour of rather fast riding brought them into a tangle of streets  on the East side. As George noticed the swarming sidewalks and listened to the  noises incident to an over-populated quarter, he could not forbear, despite the  injunction he had received, to express his surprise at the direction of their  search.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;the gentleman I have described can have no friends here.&rdquo; Then,  bethinking himself, he added: &ldquo;But if he has reasons to fear the law, naturally  he would seek to lose himself in a place as different as possible from his  usual haunts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that would be some men&rsquo;s way,&rdquo; was the curt, almost indifferent, answer he  received. Sweetwater was looking this way and that from the window beside him,  and now, leaning out gave some directions to the driver which altered their  course.</p>
  <p>When  they stopped, which was in a few minutes, he said to George:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  shall have to walk now for a block or two. I&rsquo;m anxious to attract no attention,  nor is it desirable for you to do so. If you can manage to act as if you were  accustomed to the place and just leave all the talking to me, we ought to get along  first-rate. Don&rsquo;t be astonished at anything you see, and trust me for the rest;  that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  alighted, and he dismissed the taxicab. Some clock in the neighbourhood struck  the hour of ten. &ldquo;Good! we shall be in time,&rdquo; muttered the detective, and led  the way down the street and round a corner or so, till they came to a block  darker than the rest, and much less noisy.</p>
  <p>It  had a sinister look, and George, who is brave enough under all ordinary  circumstances, was glad that his companion wore a badge and carried a whistle.  He was also relieved when he caught sight of the burly form of a policeman in  the shadow of one of the doorways. Yet the houses he saw before him were not so  very different from those they had already passed. His uneasiness could not have  sprung from them. They had even an air of positive respectability, as though  inhabited by industrious workmen. Then, what was it which made the close  companionship of a member of the police so uncommonly welcome? Was it a certain  aspect of solitariness which clung to the block, or was it the sudden  appearance here and there of strangely gliding figures, which no sooner loomed  up against the snowy perspective, than they disappeared again in some unseen  doorway?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a meeting on to-night, of the Associated Brotherhood of the Awl, the Plane and  the Trowel (whatever that means), and it is the speaker we want to see; the man  who is to address them promptly at ten o&rsquo;clock. Do you object to meetings?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this a secret one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wasn&rsquo;t advertised.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  we carpenters or masons that we can count on admittance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a carpenter. Don&rsquo;t you think you can be a mason for the occasion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt it, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  I must speak to this man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>George  stood back, and a few words passed between Sweetwater and a shadowy figure  which seemed to have sprung up out of the sidewalk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Balked  at the outset,&rdquo; were the encouraging words with which the detective rejoined  George. &ldquo;It seems that a pass-word is necessary, and my friend has been unable  to get it. Will the speaker pass out this way?&rdquo; he inquired of the shadowy  figure still lingering in their rear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  didn&rsquo;t go in by it; yet I believe he&rsquo;s safe enough inside,&rdquo; was the muttered  answer.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  had no relish for disappointments of this character, but it was not long before  he straightened up and allowed himself to exchange a few more words with this  mysterious person. These appeared to be of a more encouraging nature than the  last, for it was not long before the detective returned with renewed alacrity  to George, and, wheeling him about, began to retrace his steps to the corner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  we going back? Are you going to give up the job?&rdquo; George asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  we&rsquo;re going to take him from the rear. There&rsquo;s a break in the fence&mdash;Oh, we&rsquo;ll  do very well. Trust me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>George  laughed. He was growing excited, but not altogether agreeably so. He says that  he has seen moments of more pleasant anticipation. Evidently, my good husband  is not cut out for detective work.</p>
  <p>Where  they went under this officer&rsquo;s guidance, he cannot tell. The tortuous tangle of  alleys through which he now felt himself led was dark as the nether regions to  his unaccustomed eyes. There was snow under his feet and now and then he  brushed against some obtruding object, or stumbled against a low fence; but  beyond these slight miscalculations on his own part, he was a mere automaton in  the hands of his eager guide, and only became his own man again when they  suddenly stepped into an open yard and he could discern plainly before him the  dark walls of a building pointed out by Sweetwater as their probable  destination. Yet even here they encountered some impediment which prohibited a  close approach. A wall or shed cut off their view of the building&rsquo;s lower  storey; and though somewhat startled at being left unceremoniously alone after  just a whispered word of encouragement from the ever ready detective, George  could quite understand the necessity which that person must feel for a quiet  reconnoitering of the surroundings before the two of them ventured further  forward in their possibly hazardous undertaking. Yet the experience was none  too pleasing to George, and he was very glad to hear Sweetwater&rsquo;s whisper again  at his ear, and to feel himself rescued from the pool of slush in which he had  been left to stand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  approach is not all that can be desired,&rdquo; remarked the detective as they  entered what appeared to be a low shed. &ldquo;The broken board has been put back and  securely nailed in place, and if I am not very much mistaken there is a fellow  stationed in the yard who will want the pass-word too. Looks shady to me. I&rsquo;ll  have something to tell the chief when I get back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  we! What are we going to do if we cannot get in front or rear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  going to wait right here in the hopes of catching a glimpse of our man as he  comes out,&rdquo; returned the detective, drawing George towards a low window  overlooking the yard he had described as sentinelled. &ldquo;He will have to pass  directly under this window on his way to the alley,&rdquo; Sweetwater went on to  explain, &ldquo;and if I can only raise it&mdash;but the noise would give us away. I can&rsquo;t  do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  it swings on hinges,&rdquo; suggested George. &ldquo;It looks like that sort of a window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it should&mdash;well! it does. We&rsquo;re in great luck, sir. But before I pull it open,  remember that from the moment I unlatch it, everything said or done here can be  heard in the adjoining yard. So no whispers and no unnecessary movements. When  you hear him coming, as sooner or later you certainly will, fall carefully to  your knees and lean out just far enough to catch a glimpse of him before he  steps down from the porch. If he stops to light his cigar or to pass a few  words with some of the men he will leave behind, you may get a plain enough  view of his face or figure to identify him. The light is burning low in that  rear hall, but it will do. If it does not,&mdash;if you can&rsquo;t see him or if you do,  don&rsquo;t hang out of the window more than a second. Duck after your first look. I  don&rsquo;t want to be caught at this job with no better opportunity for escape than  we have here. Can you remember all that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>George  pinched his arm encouragingly, and Sweetwater, with an amused grunt, softly  unlatched the window and pulled it wide open.</p>
  <p>A  fine sleet flew in, imperceptible save for the sensation of damp it gave, and  the slight haze it diffused through the air. Enlarged by this haze, the  building they were set to watch rose in magnified proportions at their left.  The yard between, piled high in the centre with snow-heaps or other heaps  covered with snow, could not have been more than forty feet square. The window  from which they peered, was half-way down this yard, so that a comparatively  short distance separated them from the porch where George had been told to look  for the man he was expected to identify. All was dark there at present, but he  could hear from time to time some sounds of restless movement, as the guard  posted inside shifted in his narrow quarters, or struck his benumbed feet  softly together.</p>
  <p>But  what came to them from above was more interesting than anything to be heard or  seen below. A man&rsquo;s voice, raised to a wonderful pitch by the passion of  oratory, had burst the barriers of the closed hall in that towering third  storey and was carrying its tale to other ears than those within. Had it been  summer and the windows open, both George and Sweetwater might have heard every  word; for the tones were exceptionally rich and penetrating, and the speaker  intent only on the impression he was endeavouring to make upon his audience.  That he had not mistaken his power in this direction was evinced by the applause  which rose from time to time from innumerable hands and feet. But this uproar  would be speedily silenced, and the mellow voice ring out again, clear and  commanding. What could the subject be to rouse such enthusiasm in the  Associated Brotherhood of the Awl, the Plane and the Trowel? There was a moment  when our listening friends expected to be enlightened. A shutter was thrown  back in one of those upper windows, and the window hurriedly raised, during  which words took the place of sounds and they heard enough to whet their  appetite for more. But only that. The shutter was speedily restored to place,  and the window again closed. A wise precaution, or so thought George if they  wished to keep their doubtful proceedings secret.</p>
  <p>A  tirade against the rich and a loud call to battle could be gleaned from the few  sentences they had heard. But its virulence and pointed attack was not that of  the second-rate demagogue or business agent, but of a man whose intellect and  culture rang in every tone, and informed each sentence.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  in whom satisfaction was fast taking the place of impatience and regret, pushed  the window to before asking George this question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you hear the voice of the man whose action attracted, your attention outside  the Clermont?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you note just now the large shadow dancing on the ceiling over the speaker&rsquo;s  head?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but I could judge nothing from that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  he&rsquo;s a rum one. I shan&rsquo;t open this window again till he gives signs of reaching  the end of his speech. It&rsquo;s too cold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  almost immediately he gave a start and, pressing George&rsquo;s arm, appeared to  listen, not to the speech which was no longer audible, but to something much  nearer&mdash;a step or movement in the adjoining yard. At least, so George  interpreted the quick turn which this impetuous detective made, and the pains  he took to direct George&rsquo;s attention to the walk running under the window  beneath which they crouched. Someone was stealing down upon the house at their  left, from the alley beyond. A big man, whose shoulder brushed the window as he  went by. George felt his hand seized again and pressed as this happened, and  before he had recovered from this excitement, experienced another quick  pressure and still another as one, two, three additional figures went slipping by.  Then his hand was suddenly dropped, for a cry had shot up from the door where  the sentinel stood guard, followed by a sudden loud slam, and the noise of a  shooting bolt, which, proclaiming as it did that the invaders were not friends  but enemies to the cause which was being vaunted above, so excited Sweetwater  that he pulled the window wide open and took a bold look out. George followed  his example and this was what they saw:</p>
  <p>Three  men were standing flat against the fence leading from the shed directly to the  porch. The fourth was crouching within the latter, and in another moment they  heard his fist descend upon the door inside in a way to rouse the echoes.  Meantime, the voice in the audience hall above had ceased, and there could be  heard instead the scramble of hurrying feet and the noise of overturning  benches. Then a window flew up and a voice called down:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s  that? What do you want down there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  before an answer could be shouted back, this man was drawn fiercely inside, and  the scramble was renewed, amid which George heard Sweetwater&rsquo;s whisper at his  ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the police. The chief has got ahead of me. Was that the man we&rsquo;re after&mdash;the one  who shouted down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Neither was he the speaker. The voices are very different.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  want the speaker. If the boys get him, we&rsquo;re all right; but if they don&rsquo;t&mdash;wait,  I must make the matter sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  with a bound he vaulted through the window, whistling in a peculiar way.  George, thus left quite alone, had the pleasure of seeing his sole protector  mix with the boys, as he called them, and ultimately crowd in with them through  the door which had finally been opened for their admittance. Then came a wait,  and then the quiet re-appearance of the detective alone and in no very, amiable  mood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  inquired George, somewhat breathlessly. &ldquo;Do you want me? They don&rsquo;t seem to be  coming out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  they&rsquo;ve gone the other way. It was a red hot anarchist meeting, and no mistake.  They have arrested one of the speakers, but the other escaped. How, we have not  yet found out; but I think there&rsquo;s a way out somewhere by which he got the  start of us. He was the man I wanted you to see. Bad luck, Mr. Anderson, but  I&rsquo;m not at the end of my resources. If you&rsquo;ll have patience with me and  accompany me a little further, I promise you that I&rsquo;ll only risk one more  failure. Will you be so good, sir?&rdquo;</p>

    The Incident Of The Partly Lifted Shade</b></h2>
  <p>The  fellow had a way with him, hard to resist. Cold as George was and exhausted by  an excitement of a kind to which he was wholly unaccustomed, he found himself  acceding to the detective&rsquo;s request; and after a quick lunch and a huge cup of  coffee in a restaurant which I wish I had time to describe, the two took a car  which eventually brought them into one of the oldest quarters of the Borough of  Brooklyn. The sleet which had stung their faces in the streets of New York had  been left behind them somewhere on the bridge, but the chill was not gone from  the air, and George felt greatly relieved when Sweetwater paused in the middle  of a long block before a lofty tenement house of mean appearance, and signified  that here they were to stop, and that from now on, <i>mum</i> was to be their  watchword.</p>
  <p>George  was relieved I say, but he was also more astonished than ever. What kind of  haunts were these for the cultured gentleman who spent his evenings at the  Clermont? It was easy enough in these days of extravagant sympathies, to  understand such a man addressing the uneasy spirits of lower New York&mdash;he had  been called an enthusiast, and an enthusiast is very often a social  agitator&mdash;but to trace him afterwards to a place like this was certainly a  surprise. A tenement&mdash;such a tenement as this&mdash;meant home&mdash;home for himself or for  those he counted his friends, and such a supposition seemed inconceivable to my  poor husband, with the memory of the gorgeous parlour of the Clermont in his  mind. Indeed, he hinted something of the kind to his affable but strangely  reticent companion, but all the answer he got was a peculiar smile whose  humorous twist he could barely discern in the semi-darkness of the open doorway  into which they had just plunged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  adventure! certainly an adventure!&rdquo; flashed through poor George&rsquo;s mind, as he  peered, in great curiosity down the long hall before him, into a dismal rear,  opening into a still more dismal court. It was truly a novel experience for a  business man whose philanthropy was carried on entirely by proxy&mdash;that is, by  his wife. Should he be expected to penetrate into those dark, ill-smelling  recesses, or would he be led up the long flights of naked stairs, so feebly  illuminated that they gave the impression of extending indefinitely into dimmer  and dimmer heights of decay and desolation?</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  seemed to decide for the rear, for leaving George, he stepped down the hall  into the court beyond, where George could see him casting inquiring glances up  at the walls above him. Another tenement, similar to the one whose rear end he  was contemplating, towered behind but he paid no attention to that. He was  satisfied with the look he had given and came quickly back, joining George at  the foot of the staircase, up which he silently led the way.</p>
  <p>It  was a rude, none-too-well-cared-for building, but it seemed respectable enough  and very quiet, considering the mass of people it accommodated. There were marks  of poverty everywhere, but no squalor. One flight&mdash;two flights&mdash;three&mdash;and then  George&rsquo;s guide stopped, and, looking back at him, made a gesture. It appeared  to be one of caution, but when the two came together at the top of the  staircase, Sweetwater spoke quite naturally as he pointed out a door in their  rear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the room. We&rsquo;ll keep a sharp watch and when any man, no matter what his dress  or appearance comes up these stairs and turns that way, give him a sharp look.  You understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but-&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he hasn&rsquo;t come in yet. I took pains to find that out. You saw me go into the  court and look up. That was to see if his window was lighted. Well, it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>George  felt non-plussed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  surely,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the gentleman named Brotherson doesn&rsquo;t live here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  <i>inventor</i> does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&mdash;but  I will explain later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  suppressed excitement contained in these words made George stare. Indeed, he  had been wondering for some time at the manner of the detective which showed a  curious mixture of several opposing emotions. Now, the fellow was actually in a  tremble of hope or impatience;&mdash;and, not content with listening, he peered every  few minutes down the well of the staircase, and when he was not doing that,  tramped from end to end of the narrow passage-way separating the head of the  stairs from the door he had pointed out, like one to whom minutes were hours.  All this time he seemed to forget George who certainly had as much reason as  himself for finding the time long. But when, after some half hour of this tedium  and suspense, there rose from below the faint clatter of ascending footsteps,  he remembered his meek companion and beckoning him to one side, began a studied  conversation with him, showing him a note-book in which he had written such  phrases as these:</p>
  <p class="letter">Don&rsquo;t  look up till he is fairly in range with the light.<br>
  There&rsquo;s  nothing to fear; he doesn&rsquo;t know either of us.<br>
  If  it is a face you have seen before;&mdash;if it is the one we are expecting to see,  pull your necktie straight. It&rsquo;s a little on one side.</p>
  <p>These  rather startling injunctions were read by George, with no very perceptible  diminution of the uneasiness which it was only natural for him to feel at the  oddity of his position. But only the demand last made produced any impression  on him. The man they were waiting for was no further up than the second floor,  but instinctively George&rsquo;s hand had flown to his necktie, and he was only  stopped from its premature re-arrangement by a warning look from Sweetwater.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  unless you know him,&rdquo; whispered the detective; and immediately launched out  into an easy talk about some totally different business which George neither  understood, nor was expected to, I dare say.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  the steps below paused, and George heard Sweetwater draw in his breath in  irrepressible dismay. But they were immediately resumed, and presently the head  and shoulders of a workingman of uncommon proportions appeared in sight on the  stairway.</p>
  <p>George  cast him a keen look, and his hand rose doubtfully to his neck and then fell  back again. The approaching man was tall, very well-proportioned and easy of  carriage; but the face&mdash;such of it as could be seen between his cap and the high  collar he had pulled up about his ears, conveyed no exact impression to  George&rsquo;s mind, and he did not dare to give the signal Sweetwater expected from  him. Yet as the man went by with a dark and sidelong glance at them both, he  felt his hand rise again, though he did not complete the action, much to his  own disgust and to the evident disappointment of the watchful detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  not sure?&rdquo; he now heard, oddly interpolated in the stream of half-whispered  talk with which the other endeavoured to carry off the situation.</p>
  <p>George  shook his head. He could not rid himself of the old impression he had formed of  the man in the snow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Dunn, a word with you,&rdquo; suddenly spoke up Sweetwater, to the man who had just  passed them. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your name, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that is my name,&rdquo; was the quiet response, in a voice which was at once rich and  resonant; a voice which George knew&mdash;the voice of the impassioned speaker he had  heard resounding through the sleet as he cowered within hearing in the shed  behind the Avenue A tenement. &ldquo;Who are you who wish to speak to me at so late  an hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was returning to them from the door he had unlocked and left slightly ajar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we are&mdash;You know what,&rdquo; smiled the ready detective, advancing half-way to greet  him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not members of the Associated Brotherhood, but possibly have hopes  of being so. At all events, we should like to talk the matter over, if, as you  say, it&rsquo;s not too late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have nothing to do with the club&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you spoke before it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you can give us some sort of an idea how we are to apply for membership.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Dunn met the concentrated gaze of his two evidently unwelcome visitors with a  frankness which dashed George&rsquo;s confidence in himself, but made little visible  impression upon his daring companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should rather see you at another time,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; his hesitation was  inappreciable save to the nicest ear&mdash;&ldquo;if you will allow me to be brief, I will  tell you what I know&mdash;which is very little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  was greatly taken aback. All he had looked for, as he was careful to tell my  husband later, was a sufficiently prolonged conversation to enable George to  mark and study the workings of the face he was not yet sure of. Nor did the  detective feel quite easy at the readiness of his reception; nor any too well  pleased to accept the invitation which this man now gave them to enter his  room.</p>
  <p>But  he suffered no betrayal of his misgivings to escape him, though he was careful  to intimate to George, as they waited in the doorway for the other to light up,  that he should not be displeased at his refusal to accompany him further in  this adventure, and even advised him to remain in the hall till he received his  summons to enter.</p>
  <p>But  George had not come as far as this to back out now, and as soon as he saw  Sweetwater advance into the now well-lighted interior, he advanced too and  began to look around him.</p>
  <p>The  room, like many others in these old-fashioned tenements, had a jog just where  the door was, so that on entering they had to take several steps before they  could get a full glimpse of its four walls. When they did, both showed  surprise. Comfort, if not elegance, confronted them, which impression, however,  was immediately lost in the evidences of work, manual, as well as intellectual,  which were everywhere scattered about.</p>
  <p>The  man who lived here was not only a student, as was evinced by a long wall full  of books, but he was an art-lover, a musician, an inventor and an athlete.</p>
  <p>So  much could be learned from the most cursory glance. A more careful one picked  up other facts fully as startling and impressive. The books were choice; the  invention to all appearance a practical one; the art of a high order and the  music, such as was in view, of a character of which the nicest taste need not  be ashamed. George began to feel quite conscious of the intrusion of which they  had been guilty, and was amazed at the ease with which the detective carried  himself in the presence of such manifestations of culture and good, hard work.  He was trying to recall the exact appearance of the figure he had seen stooping  in the snowy street two nights before, when he found himself staring at the  occupant of the room, who had taken up his stand before them and was regarding  them while they were regarding the room.</p>
  <p>He  had thrown aside his hat and rid himself of his overcoat, and the fearlessness  of his aspect seemed to daunt the hitherto dauntless Sweetwater, who, for the  first time in his life, perhaps, hunted in vain for words with which to start  conversation.</p>
  <p>Had  he made an awful mistake? Was this Mr. Dunn what he seemed an unknown and  careful genius, battling with great odds in his honest struggle to give the  world something of value in return for what it had given him? The quick, almost  deprecatory glance he darted at George betrayed his dismay; a dismay which  George had begun to share, notwithstanding his growing belief that the man&rsquo;s  face was not wholly unknown to him even if he could not recognise it as the one  he had seen outside the Clermont.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to have forgotten your errand,&rdquo; came in quiet, if not good-natured,  sarcasm from their patiently waiting host.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  the room,&rdquo; muttered Sweetwater, with an attempt at his old-time ease which was  not as fully successful as usual. &ldquo;What an all-fired genius you must be. I  never saw the like. And in a tenement house too! You ought to be in one of  those big new studio buildings in New York where artists be and everything you  see is beautiful. You&rsquo;d appreciate it, you would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective started, George started, at the gleam which answered him from a very  uncommon eye. It was a temporary flash, however, and quickly veiled, and the  tone in which this Dunn now spoke was anything but an encouraging one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you were desirous of joining a socialistic fraternity,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;a  true aspirant for such honours don&rsquo;t care for beautiful things unless all can  have them. I prefer my tenement. How is it with you, friends?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  found some sort of a reply, though the thing which this man now did must have  startled him, as it certainly did George. They were so grouped that a table  quite full of anomalous objects stood at the back of their host, and  consequently quite beyond their own reach. As Sweetwater began to speak, he  whom he had addressed by the name of Dunn, drew a pistol from his breast pocket  and laid it down barrel towards them on this table top. Then he looked up  courteously enough, and listened till Sweetwater was done. A very handsome man,  but one not to be trifled with in the slightest degree. Both recognised this  fact, and George, for one, began to edge towards the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  I feel easier,&rdquo; remarked the giant, swelling out his chest. He was unusually  tall, as well as unusually muscular. &ldquo;I never like to carry arms; but sometimes  it is unavoidable. Damn it, what hands!&rdquo; He was looking at his own, which  certainly showed soil. &ldquo;Will you pardon me?&rdquo; he pleasantly apologised, stepping  towards a washstand and plunging his hands into the basin. &ldquo;I cannot think with  dirt on me like that. Humph, hey! did you speak?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  turned quickly on George who had certainly uttered an ejaculation, but  receiving no reply, went on with his task, completing it with a care and a  disregard of their presence which showed him up in still another light.</p>
  <p>But  even his hardihood showed shock, when, upon turning round with a brisk, &ldquo;Now  I&rsquo;m ready to talk,&rdquo; he encountered again the clear eye of Sweetwater. For, in  the person of this none too welcome intruder, he saw a very different man from  the one upon whom he had just turned his back with so little ceremony; and  there appeared to be no good reason for the change. He had not noted in his  preoccupation, how George, at sight of his stooping figure, had made a sudden  significant movement, and if he had, the pulling of a necktie straight, would  have meant nothing to him. But to Sweetwater it meant every thing, and it was  in the tone of one fully at ease with himself that he now dryly remarked: &ldquo;Mr.  Brotherson, if you feel quite clean; and if you have sufficiently warmed  yourself, I would suggest that we start out at once, unless you prefer to have  me share this room with you till the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was silence. Mr. Dunn thus addressed attempted no answer; not for a full  minute. The two men were measuring each other&mdash;George felt that he did not count  at all&mdash;and <i>they</i> were quite too much occupied with this task to heed the passage  of time. To George, who knew little, if anything, of what this silent struggle  meant to either, it seemed that the detective stood no show before this Samson  of physical strength and intellectual power, backed by a pistol just within  reach of his hand. But as George continued to look and saw the figure of the  smaller man gradually dilate, while that of the larger, the more potent and the  better guarded, gave unmistakable signs of secret wavering, he slowly changed  his mind and, ranging himself with the detective, waited for the word or words  which should explain this situation and render intelligible the triumph  gradually becoming visible in the young detective&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
  <p>But  he was not destined to have his curiosity satisfied so far. He might witness  and hear, but it was long before he understood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brotherson?&rdquo;  repeated their host, after the silence had lasted to the breaking-point. &ldquo;Why  do you call me that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  it is your name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  called me Dunn a minute ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  Dunn if Brotherson is my name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you spoke under the name of Dunn at the meeting to-night, and if I don&rsquo;t  mistake, that is the name by which you are known here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you? By what name are you known?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is late to ask, isn&rsquo;t it? But I&rsquo;m willing to speak it now, and I might not have  been so a little earlier in our conversation. I am Detective Sweetwater of the  New York Department of Police, and my errand here is a very simple one. Some  letters signed by you have been found among the papers of the lady whose  mysterious death at the hotel Clermont is just now occupying the attention of  the New York authorities. If you have any information to give which will in any  way explain that death, your presence will be welcome at Coroner Heath&rsquo;s office  in New York. If you have not, your presence will still be welcome. At all  events, I was told to bring you. You will be on hand to accompany me in the  morning, I am quite sure, pardoning the unconventional means I have taken to  make sure of my man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  humour with which this was said seemed to rob it of anything like attack, and  Mr. Brotherson, as we shall hereafter call him, smiled with an odd acceptance  of the same, as he responded:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will go before the police certainly. I haven&rsquo;t much to tell, but what I have is  at their service. It will not help you, but I have no secrets. What are you  doing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  bounded towards Sweetwater, who had simply stepped to the window, lifted the  shade and looked across at the opposing tenement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wanted to see if it was still snowing,&rdquo; explained the detective, with a smile,  which seemed to strike the other like a blow. &ldquo;If it was a liberty, please  pardon it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Brotherson drew back. The cold air of self-possession which he now assumed,  presented such a contrast to the unwarranted heat of the moment before that  George wondered greatly over it, and later, when he recapitulated to me the  whole story of this night, it was this incident of the lifted shade, together  with the emotion it had caused, which he acknowledged as being for him the most  inexplicable event of the evening and the one he was most anxious to hear  explained.</p>
  <p>As  this ends our connection with this affair, I will bid you my personal farewell.  I have often wished that circumstances had made it possible for me to accompany  you through the remaining intricacies of this remarkable case.</p>
  <p>But  you will not lack a suitable guide.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_10"></a><b>Chapter 10<br>
    A Difference Of Opinion</b></h2>
  <p>At  an early hour the next morning, Sweetwater stood before the coroner&rsquo;s desk,  urging a plea he feared to hear refused. He wished to be present at the  interview soon to be held with Mr. Brotherson, and he had no good reason to  advance why such a privilege should be allotted him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not curiosity,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a question I hope to see settled. I can&rsquo;t  communicate it&mdash;you would laugh at me; but it&rsquo;s an important one, a very  important one, and I beg that you will let me sit in one of the corners and  hear what he says. I won&rsquo;t bother and I&rsquo;ll be very still, so still that he&rsquo;ll  hardly notice me. Do grant me this favour, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  coroner, who had had some little experience with this man, surveyed him with a  smile less forbidding than the poor fellow expected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to lay great store by it,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;if you want to sort those papers over  there, you may.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you. I don&rsquo;t understand the job, but I promise you not to increase the  confusion. If I do; if I rattle the leaves too loudly, it will mean, &lsquo;Press him  further on this exact point,&rsquo; but I doubt if I rattle them, sir. No such luck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  last three words were uttered sotto voce, but the coroner heard him, and  followed his ungainly figure with a glance of some curiosity, as he settled  himself at the desk on the other side of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  the man&mdash;&rdquo; he began, but at this moment the man entered, and Dr. Heath forgot  the young detective, in his interest in the new arrival.</p>
  <p>Neither  dressed with the elegance known to the habitues of the Clermont, nor yet in the  workman&rsquo;s outfit in which he had thought best to appear before the Associated  Brotherhood, the newcomer advanced, with an aspect of open respect which could  not fail to make a favourable impression upon the critical eye of the official  awaiting him. So favourable, indeed, was this impression that that gentleman  half rose, infusing a little more consideration into his greeting than he was  accustomed to show to his prospective witnesses. Such a fearless eye he had seldom  encountered, nor was it often his pleasure to confront so conspicuous a  specimen of physical and intellectual manhood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Brotherson, I believe,&rdquo; said he, as he motioned his visitor to sit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is my name, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Orlando  Brotherson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  same, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad we have made no mistake,&rdquo; smiled the doctor. &ldquo;Mr. Brotherson, I have sent  for you under the supposition that you were a friend of the unhappy lady lately  dead at the Hotel Clermont.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Challoner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly;  Miss Challoner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew the lady. But&mdash;&rdquo; here the speaker&rsquo;s eye took on a look as questioning as  that of his interlocutor&mdash;&ldquo;but in a way so devoid of all publicity that I cannot  but feel surprised that the fact should be known.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this, the listening Sweetwater hoped that Dr. Heath would ignore the suggestion  thus conveyed and decline the explanation it apparently demanded. But the  impression made by the gentleman&rsquo;s good looks had been too strong for this  coroner&rsquo;s proverbial caution, and, handing over the slip of a note which had  been found among Miss Challoner&rsquo;s effects by her father, he quietly asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you recognise the signature?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it is mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you acknowledge yourself the author of these lines?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  certainly. Have I not said that this is my signature?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you remember the words of this note, Mr. Brotherson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly.  I recollect its tenor, but not the exact words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read  them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse  me, I had rather not. I am aware that they were bitter and should be the cause  of great regret. I was angry when I wrote them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is evident. But the cause of your anger is not so clear, Mr. Brotherson. Miss  Challoner was a woman of lofty character, or such was the universal opinion of  her friends. What could she have done to a gentleman like yourself to draw  forth such a tirade?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  ask that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am obliged to. There is mystery surrounding her death;&mdash;the kind of mystery  which demands perfect frankness on the part of all who were near her on that  evening, or whose relations to her were in any way peculiar. You acknowledge  that your friendship was of such a guarded nature that it surprised you greatly  to hear it recognised. Yet you could write her a letter of this nature. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;&rdquo;  the word came glibly; but the next one was long in following. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he  repeated, letting the fire of some strong feeling disturb for a moment his  dignified reserve, &ldquo;I offered myself to Miss Challoner, and she dismissed me  with great disdain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  and so you thought a threat was due her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  threat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These  words contain a threat, do they not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  may. I was hardly master of myself at the time. I may have expressed myself in  an unfortunate manner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read  the words, Mr. Brotherson. I really must insist that you do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no hesitancy now. Rising, he leaned over the table and read the few words  the other had spread out for his perusal. Then he slowly rose to his full  height, as he answered, with some slight display of compunction:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  remember it perfectly now. It is not a letter to be proud of. I hope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray  finish, Mr. Brotherson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you are not seeking to establish a connection between this letter and her  violent death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Letters  of this sort are often very mischievous, Mr. Brotherson. The harshness with  which this is written might easily rouse emotions of a most unhappy nature in  the breast of a woman as sensitive as Miss Challoner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me, Dr. Heath; I cannot flatter myself so far. You overrate my influence with  the lady you name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  believe, then, that she was sincere in her rejection of your addresses?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  start, too slight to be noted by any one but the watchful Sweetwater, showed  that this question had gone home. But the self-poise and mental control of this  man were perfect, and in an instant he was facing the coroner again, with a  dignity which gave no clew to the disturbance into which his thoughts had just  been thrown. Nor was this disturbance apparent in his tones when he made his  reply:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have never allowed myself to think otherwise. I have seen no reason why I  should. The suggestion you would convey by such a question is hardly welcome,  <i>now</i>. I pray you to be careful in your judgment of such a woman&rsquo;s impulses. They  often spring from sources not to be sounded even by her dearest friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just;  but how cold! Dr. Heath, eyeing him with admiration rather than sympathy,  hesitated how to proceed; while Sweetwater, peering up from his papers, sought  in vain for some evidence of the bereaved lover in the impressive but wholly  dispassionate figure of him who had just spoken. Had pride got the better of  his heart? or had that organ always been subordinate to the will in this man of  instincts so varying, that at one time he impressed you simply as a typical  gentleman of leisure; at another, as no more than a fiery agitator with powers  absorbed by, if not limited to the one cause he advocated; and again&mdash;and this  seemed the most contradictory of all&mdash;just the ardent inventor, living in a  tenement, with Science for his goddess and work always under his hand? As the  young detective weighed these possibilities and marvelled over the  contradictions they offered, he forgot the papers now lying quiet under his  hand. He was too interested to remember his own part&mdash;something which could not  often be said of Sweetwater.</p>
  <p>Meantime,  the coroner had collected his thoughts. With an apology for the extremely  personal nature of his inquiry, he asked Mr. Brotherson if he would object to  giving him some further details of his acquaintanceship with Miss Challoner;  where he first met her and under what circumstances their friendship had  developed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all,&rdquo; was the ready reply. &ldquo;I have nothing to conceal in the matter. I only  wish that her father were present that he might listen to the recital of my  acquaintanceship with his daughter. He might possibly understand her better and  regard with more leniency the presumption into which I was led by my ignorance  of the pride inherent in great families.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  wish can very easily be gratified,&rdquo; returned the official, pressing an electric  button on his desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Challoner is in the adjoining room.&rdquo; Then, as the door communicating with the  room he had mentioned swung ajar and stood so, Dr. Heath added, without  apparent consciousness of the dramatic character of this episode, &ldquo;You will not  need to raise your voice beyond its natural pitch. He can hear perfectly from  where he sits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you. I am glad to speak in his presence,&rdquo; came in undisturbed self-possession  from this not easily surprised witness. &ldquo;I shall relate the facts exactly as  they occurred, adding nothing and concealing nothing. If I mistook my position,  or Miss Challoner&rsquo;s position, it is not for me to apologise. I never hid my  business from her, nor the moderate extent of my fortune. If she knew me at  all, she knew me for what I am; a man of the people who glories in work and who  has risen by it to a position somewhat unique in this city. I feel no lack of  equality even with such a woman as Miss Challoner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  most unnecessary preamble, no doubt, and of doubtful efficacy in smoothing his  way to a correct understanding with the deeply bereaved father. But he looked  so handsome as he thus asserted himself and made so much of his inches and the  noble poise of his head&mdash;though cold of eye and always cold of manner&mdash;that those  who saw, as well as heard him, forgave this display of egotism in consideration  of its honesty and the dignity it imparted to his person.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  first met Miss Challoner in the Berkshires,&rdquo; he began, after a moment of quiet  listening for any possible sound from the other room. &ldquo;I had been on the tramp,  and had stopped at one of the great hotels for a seven days&rsquo; rest. I will  acknowledge that I chose this spot at the instigation of a relative who knew my  tastes and how perfectly they might be gratified there. That I should mingle  with the guests may not have been in his thought, any more than it was in mine  at the beginning of my stay. The panorama of beauty spread out before me on  every side was sufficient in itself for my enjoyment, and might have continued  so to the end if my attention had not been very forcibly drawn on one memorable  morning to a young lady&mdash;Miss Challoner&mdash;by the very earnest look she gave me as  I was crossing the office from one verandah to another. I must insist on this  look, even if it shock the delicacy of my listeners, for without the interest  it awakened in me, I might not have noticed the blush with which she turned  aside to join her friends on the verandah. It was an overwhelming blush which  could not have sprung from any slight embarrassment, and, though I hate the  pretensions of those egotists who see in a woman&rsquo;s smile more than it by right  conveys, I could not help being moved by this display of feeling in one so  gifted with every grace and attribute of the perfect woman. With less caution  than I usually display, I approached the desk where she had been standing and,  meeting the eyes of the clerk, asked the young lady&rsquo;s name. He gave it, and  waited for me to express the surprise he expected it to evoke. But I felt none  and showed none. Other feelings had seized me. I had heard of this gracious  woman from many sources, in my life among the suffering masses of New York, and  now that I had seen her and found her to be not only my ideal of personal  loveliness but seemingly approachable and not uninterested in myself, I allowed  my fancy to soar and my heart to become touched. A fact which the clerk now  confided to me naturally deepened the impression. Miss Challoner had seen my  name in the guest-book and asked to have me pointed out to her. Perhaps she had  heard my name spoken in the same quarter where I had heard hers. We have never  exchanged confidences on the subject, and I cannot say. I can only give you my  reason for the interest I felt in Miss Challoner and why I forgot, in the  glamour of this episode, the aims and purposes of a not unambitious life and  the distance which the world and the so-called aristocratic class put between a  woman of her wealth and standing and a simple worker like myself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must be pardoned. She had smiled upon me once, and she smiled again. Days  before we were formally presented, I caught her softened look turned my way, as  we passed each other in hall or corridor. We were friends, or so it appeared to  me, before ever a word passed between us, and when fortune favoured us and we  were duly introduced, our minds met in a strange sympathy which made this one  interview a memorable one to me. Unhappily, as I then considered it, this was  my last day at the hotel, and our conversation, interrupted frequently by  passing acquaintances, was never resumed. I exchanged a few words with her by  way of good-bye but nothing more. I came to New York, and she remained in  Lenox. A month after and she too came to New York.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  good-bye&mdash;do you remember it? The exact language, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do; it made a great impression on me. &lsquo;I shall hope for our further acquaintance,&rsquo;  she said. &lsquo;We have one very strong interest in common.&rsquo; And if ever a human  face spoke eloquently, it was hers at that moment. The interest, as I  understood it, was our mutual sympathy for our toiling, half-starved,  down-trodden brothers and sisters in the lower streets of this city; but the  eloquence&mdash;that I probably mistook. I thought it sprang from personal interest,  and it gave me courage to pursue the intention which had taken the place of  every other feeling and ambition by which I had hitherto been moved. Here was a  woman in a thousand; one who could make a man of me indeed. If she could ignore  the social gulf between us, I felt free to take the leap. Cowardice had never  been a fault of mine. But I was no fool even then. I realised that I must first  let her see the manner of man I was and what life meant to me and must mean to  her if the union I contemplated should become an actual fact. I wrote letters  to her, but I did not give her my address or even request a reply. I was not  ready for any word from her. I am not like other men and I could wait. And I  did, for weeks, then I suddenly appeared at her hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  change of voice&mdash;the bitterness which he infused into this final sentence made  every one look up. Hitherto he had spoken calmly, almost monotonously, as if no  present heart-beat responded to this tale of vanished love; but with the words,  &ldquo;Then I suddenly appeared at her hotel,&rdquo; he showed himself human again, and  betrayed a passion which though curbed was of the fiery quality, befitting his  extraordinary attributes of mind and person.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  was when?&rdquo; put in Dr. Heath, anxious to bridge the pause which must have been  very painful to the listening father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  week after Thanksgiving. I did not see her the first day, and only casually the  second. But she knew I was in the building, and when I came upon her one  evening seated at the very desk in the mezzanine which we all have such bitter  cause to remember, I could not forbear expressing myself in a way she could not  misunderstand. The result was of a kind to drive a man like myself to an  extremity of self-condemnation and rage. She rose up as if insulted, and flung  me one sentence and one sentence only before she hailed the elevator and left  my presence. A cur could not have been dismissed with less ceremony.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is not like my daughter. What was the sentence you allude to? Let me hear the  very words.&rdquo; Mr. Challoner had come forward and now stood awaiting his reply, a  dignified but pathetic figure, which all must view with respect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hate the memory of them, but since you demand it, I will repeat them just as  they fell from her lips,&rdquo; was Mr. Brotherson&rsquo;s bitter retort. &ldquo;She said, &lsquo;You  of all men should recognise the unseemliness of these proposals. Had your  letters given me any hint of the feelings you have just expressed, you would  never have had this opportunity of approaching me.&rsquo; That was all; but her  indignation was scathing. Ladies who have supped exclusively off silver, show a  fine scorn for the common ware of the cottager.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Challoner bowed. &ldquo;There is some mistake,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;My daughter might be averse  to your addresses, but she would never show indignation to any aspirant for her  hand, simply on account of extraneous conditions. She had wide sympathies&mdash;wider  than I often approved. Something in your conduct or the confidence you showed  shocked her nicer sense; not your lack of the luxuries she often misprised.  This much I feel obliged to say, out of justice to her character, which was  uniformly considerate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have seen her with men of her own world and yours,&rdquo; was the harsh response.  &ldquo;She had another side to her nature for the man of a different sphere. And it  killed my love&mdash;that you can see&mdash;and led to my sending her the injudicious  letter with which you have confronted me. The hurt bull utters one bellow  before he dies. I bellowed, and bellowed loudly, but I did not die. I&rsquo;m my own  man still and mean to remain so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  assertive boldness&mdash;some would call it bravado&mdash;with which he thus finished the  story of his relations with the dead heiress, seemed to be more than Mr.  Challoner could stand. With a look of extreme pain and perplexity he vanished  from the doorway, and it fell to Dr. Heath to inquire:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this letter&mdash;a letter of threat you will remember&mdash;the only communication which  passed between you and Miss Challoner after this unfortunate passage of arms at  the Clermont?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I had no wish to address her again. I had exhausted in this one outburst  whatever humiliation I felt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she? Did she give no sign, make you no answer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  whatever.&rdquo; Then, as if he found it impossible to hide this hurt to his pride,  &ldquo;She did not even seem to consider me worthy the honour of an added rebuke.  Such arrogance is, no doubt, commendable in a Challoner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  time his bitterness did not pass unrebuked by the coroner:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember  the grey hairs of the only Challoner who can hear you, and respect his grief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Brotherson bowed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have finished,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I shall have nothing more to say on the subject.&rdquo; And  he drew himself up in expectation of the dismissal he evidently thought  pending.</p>
  <p>But  the coroner was not done with him by any means. He had a theory in regard to  this lamentable suicide which he hoped to establish by this man&rsquo;s testimony,  and, in pursuit of this plan, he not only motioned to Mr. Brotherson to reseat  himself, but began at once to open a fresh line of examination by saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will pardon me, if I press this matter. I have been given to understand that  notwithstanding your break with Miss Challoner, you have kept up your visits to  the Clermont and were even on the spot at the time of her death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the <i>spot?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the hotel, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  you are right; I was in the hotel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  the time of her death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  near the time. I remember hearing some disturbance in the lobby behind me, just  as I was passing out at the Broadway entrance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did, and did not return?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I return? I am not a man of much curiosity. There was no reason why I  should connect a sudden alarm in the lobby of the Clermont with any cause of  special interest to myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was so true and the look which accompanied the words was so frank that the  coroner hesitated a moment before he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not, unless&mdash;well, to be direct, unless you had just seen Miss Challoner and  knew her state of mind and what was likely to follow your abrupt departure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had no interview with Miss Challoner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you saw her? Saw her that evening and just before the accident?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater&rsquo;s  papers rattled; it was the only sound to be heard in that moment of silence.  Then&mdash;&ldquo;What do you mean by those words?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Brotherson, with studied  composure. &ldquo;I have said that I had no interview with Miss Challoner. Why do you  ask me then, if I saw her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I believe that you did. From a distance possibly, but yet directly and with no  possibility of mistake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you put that as a question?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do. Did you see her figure or face that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Nothing&mdash;not  even the rattling of Sweetwater&rsquo;s papers&mdash;disturbed the silence which followed  this admission.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  where?&rdquo; Dr. Heath asked at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  a point far enough away to make any communication between us impossible. I do  not think you will require me to recall the exact spot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  it were one which made it possible for her to see you as clearly as you could  see her, I think it would be very advisable for you to say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was&mdash;such&mdash;a spot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I think I can locate it for you, or do you prefer to locate it yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will locate it myself. I had hoped not to be called upon to mention what I  cannot but consider a most unfortunate coincidence. As a gentleman you will  understand my reticence and also why it is a matter of regret to me that with  an acumen worthy of your position, you should have discovered a fact which,  while it cannot explain Miss Challoner&rsquo;s death, will drag our little affair  before the public, and possibly give it a prominence in some minds which I am  sure does not belong to it. I met Miss Challoner&rsquo;s eye for one instant from the  top of the little staircase running up to the mezzanine. I had yielded thus far  to an impulse I had frequently combated, to seek by another interview to  retrieve the bad effect which must have been made upon her by my angry note. I  knew that she frequently wrote letters in the mezzanine at this hour, and got  as far as the top of the staircase in my effort to join her. But got no  further. When I saw her on her feet, with her face turned my way, I remembered  the scorn with which she had received my former heart-felt proposals and,  without taking another step forward, I turned away from her and fled down the  steps and so out of the building by the main entrance. She saw me, for her hand  flew up with a startled gesture, but I cannot think that my presence on the  same floor with her could have caused her to strike the blow which terminated  her life. Why should I? No woman sacrifices her life out of mere regret for the  disdain she has shown a man she has taken no pains to understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  tone and his attitude seemed to invite the concurrence of Dr. Heath in this  statement. But the richness of the one and the grace of the other showed the  handsome speaker off to such advantage that the coroner was rather inclined to  consider how a woman, even of Miss Challoner&rsquo;s fine taste and careful breeding,  might see in such a situation much for regret, if not for active despair and  the suicidal act. He gave no evidence of his thought, however, but followed up  the one admission made by Mr. Brotherson which he and others must naturally  view as of the first importance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  saw Miss Challoner lift her hand, you say. Which hand, and what was in it?  Anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  lifted her right hand, but it would be impossible for me to tell you whether  there was anything in it or not. I simply saw the movement before I turned  away. It looked like one of alarm to me. I felt that she had some reason for  this. She could not know that it was in repentance I came rather than in  fulfilment of my threat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  sigh from the adjoining room. Mr. Brotherson rose, as he heard it, and in doing  so met the clear eye of Sweetwater fixed upon his own. Its language was, no  doubt, peculiar and it seemed to fascinate him for a moment, for he started as  if to approach the detective, but forsook this intention almost immediately,  and addressing the coroner, gravely remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  death following so quickly upon this abortive attempt of mine at an interview  startled me by its coincidence as much as it does you. If in the weakness of  her woman&rsquo;s nature, it was more than this&mdash;if the scorn she had previously shown  me was a cloak she instinctively assumed to hide what she was not ready to  disclose, my remorse will be as great as any one here could wish. But the proof  of all this will have to be very convincing before my present convictions will  yield to it. Some other and more poignant source will have to be found for that  instant&rsquo;s impulsive act than is supplied by this story of my unfortunate  attachment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Heath was convinced, but he was willing to concede something to the secret  demand made upon him by Sweetwater, who was bundling up his papers with much  clatter.</p>
  <p>Looking  up with a smile which had elements in it he was hardly conscious of perhaps  himself, he asked in an off-hand way:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why did you take such pains to wash your hands of the affair the moment you had  left the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  passed around the corner into&mdash;street, did you not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  likely. I could go that way as well as another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  stopped at the first lamp-post?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I see. Someone saw that childish action of mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did you mean by it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  what you have suggested. I did go through the pantomime of washing my hands of  an affair I considered definitely ended. I had resisted an irrepressible  impulse to see and talk with Miss Challoner again, and was pleased with my  firmness. Unaware of the tragic blow which had just fallen, I was full of  self-congratulations at my escape from the charm which had lured me back to  this hotel again and again in spite of my better judgment, and I wished to  symbolise my relief by an act of which I was, in another moment, ashamed.  Strange that there should have been a witness to it. (Here he stole a look at  Sweetwater.) Stranger still, that circumstances by the most extraordinary of  coincidences, should have given so unforeseen a point to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right, Mr. Brotherson. The whole occurrence is startling and most strange.  But life is made up of the unexpected, as none know better than we physicians,  whether our practice be of a public or private character.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Mr. Brotherson left the room, the curiosity to which he had yielded once  before, led him to cast a glance of penetrating inquiry behind him full at  Sweetwater, and if either felt embarrassment, it was not the hunted but the  hunter.</p>
  <p>But  the feeling did not last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  simply met the strongest man I&rsquo;ve ever encountered,&rdquo; was Sweetwater&rsquo;s  encouraging comment to himself. &ldquo;All the more glory if I can find a joint in  his armour or a hidden passage to his cold, secretive heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_11"></a><b>Chapter 11<br>
    Alike In Essentials</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Gryce, I am either a fool or the luckiest fellow going. You must decide which.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  aged detective, thus addressed, laid down his evening paper and endeavoured to  make out the dim form he could just faintly discern standing between him and  the library door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sweetwater,  is that you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one else. Sweetwater, the fool, or Sweetwater, much too wise for his own good.  I don&rsquo;t know which. Perhaps you can find out and tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  grunt from the region of the library table, then the sarcastic remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  just in the mood to settle that question. This last failure to my account ought  to make me an excellent judge of another&rsquo;s folly. I&rsquo;ve meddled with the old  business for the last time, Sweetwater. You&rsquo;ll have to go it lone from now on.  The Department has no more work for Ebenezar Gryce, or rather Ebenezar Gryce  will make no more fool attempts to please them. Strange that a man don&rsquo;t know  when his time has come to quit. I remember how I once scored Yeardsley for  hanging on after he had lost his grip; and here am I doing the same thing. But  what&rsquo;s the matter with you? Speak out, my boy. Something new in the wind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Mr. Gryce; nothing new. It&rsquo;s the same old business. But, if what I suspect is  true, this same old business offers opportunities for some very interesting and  unusual effort. You&rsquo;re not satisfied with the coroner&rsquo;s verdict in the  Challoner case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I&rsquo;m satisfied with nothing that leaves all ends dangling. Suicide was not  proved. It seemed the only presumption possible, but it was not proved. There  was no blood-stain on that cutter-point.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  any evidence that it had ever been there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I&rsquo;m not proud of the chain which lacks a link where it should be strongest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  shall never supply that link.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  quite agree with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  chain we must throw away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  forge another?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  approached and sat down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I believe we can do it; yet I have only one indisputable fact for a starter.  That is why I want you to tell me whether I&rsquo;m growing daft or simply  adventurous. Mr. Gryce, I don&rsquo;t trust Brotherson. He has pulled the wool over  Dr. Heath&rsquo;s eyes and almost over those of Mr. Challoner. But he can&rsquo;t pull it  over mine. Though he should tell a story ten times more plausible than the one  with which he has satisfied the coroner&rsquo;s jury, I would still listen to him  with more misgiving than confidence. Yet I have caught him in no misstatement,  and his eye is steadier than my own. Perhaps it is simply a deeply rooted  antipathy on my part, or the rage one feels at finding he has placed his finger  on the wrong man. Again it may be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  Sweetwater?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  well-founded distrust. Mr. Gryce, I&rsquo;m going to ask you a question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask  away. Ask fifty if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  the one may involve fifty, but it is big enough in itself to hold our attention  for a while. Did you ever hear of a case before, that in some of its details  was similar to this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it stands alone. That&rsquo;s why it is so puzzling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  forget. The wealth, beauty and social consequence of the present victim has  blinded you to the strong resemblance which her case bears to one you know, in  which the sufferer had none of the worldly advantages of Miss Challoner. I  allude to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!  the washerwoman in Hicks Street! Sweetwater, what have you got up your sleeve?  You do mean that Brooklyn washerwoman, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  same. The Department may have forgotten it, but I haven&rsquo;t. Mr. Gryce, there&rsquo;s a  startling similarity in the two cases if you study the essential features only.  Startling, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you are right there. But what if there is? We were no more successful in  solving that case than we have been in solving this. Yet you look and act like  a hound which has struck a hot scent.&rdquo; The young man smoothed his features with  an embarrassed laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall never learn,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;not to give tongue till the hunt is fairly  started. If you will excuse me we&rsquo;ll first make sure of the similarity I have  mentioned. Then I&rsquo;ll explain myself. I have some notes here, made at the time  it was decided to drop the Hicks Street case as a wholly inexplicable one. As  you know, I never can bear to say &lsquo;die,&rsquo; and I sometimes keep such notes as a  possible help in case any such unfinished matter should come up again. Shall I  read them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do.  Twenty years ago it would not have been necessary. I should have remembered  every detail of an affair so puzzling. But my memory is no longer entirely  reliable. So fire away, my boy, though I hardly see your purpose or what real  bearing the affair in Hicks Street has upon the Clermont one. A poor  washerwoman and the wealthy Miss Challoner! True, they were not unlike in their  end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  connection will come later,&rdquo; smiled the young detective, with that strange  softening of his features which made one at times forget his extreme plainness.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you will not consider the time lost if I ask you to consider the  comparison I am about to make, if only as a curiosity in criminal annals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  he read:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;On  the afternoon of December Fourth, 1910, the strong and persistent screaming of  a young child in one of the rooms of a rear tenement in Hicks Street, Brooklyn,  drew the attention of some of the inmates and led them, after several  ineffectual efforts to gain an entrance, to the breaking in of the door which  had been fastened on the inside by an old-fashioned door-button.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The  tenant whom all knew for an honest, hard-working woman, had not infrequently  fastened her door in this manner, in order to safeguard her child who was  abnormally active and had a way of rattling the door open when it was not thus  secured. But she had never refused to open before, and the child&rsquo;s cries were  pitiful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This  was no longer a matter of wonder, when, the door having been wrenched from its  hinges, they all rushed in. Across a tub of steaming clothes lifted upon a  bench in the open window, they saw the body of this good woman, lying inert and  seemingly dead; the frightened child tugging at her skirts. She was of a robust  make, fleshy and fair, and had always been considered a model of health and  energy, but at the sight of her helpless figure, thus stricken while at work,  the one cry was &lsquo;A stroke&rsquo;! till she had been lifted off and laid upon the  floor. Then some discoloration in the water at the bottom of the tub led to a  closer examination of her body, and the discovery of a bullet-hole in her  breast directly over the heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As  she had been standing with face towards the window, all crowded that way to see  where the shot had come from. As they were on the fourth storey it could not  have come from the court upon which the room looked. It could only have come  from the front tenement, towering up before them some twenty feet away. A  single window of the innumerable ones confronting them stood open, and this was  the one directly opposite.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nobody  was to be seen there or in the room beyond, but during the excitement, one man  ran off to call the police and another to hunt up the janitor and ask who  occupied this room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;His  reply threw them all into confusion. The tenant of that room was the best, the  quietest and most respectable man in either building.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then  he must be simply careless and the shot an accidental one. A rush was made for  the stairs and soon the whole building was in an uproar. But when this especial  room was reached, it was found locked and on the door a paper pinned up, on  which these words were written: <i>Gone to New York. Will be back at 6:30!</i> Words  that recalled a circumstance to the janitor. He had seen the gentleman go out  an hour before. This terminated all inquiry in this direction, though some few  of the excited throng were for battering down this door just as they had the  other one. But they were overruled by the janitor, who saw no use in such  wholesale destruction, and presently the arrival of the police restored order  and limited the inquiry to the rear building, where it undoubtedly belonged.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Gryce,&rdquo; (here Sweetwater laid by his notes that he might address the old  gentleman more directly), &ldquo;I was with the boys when they made their first  official investigation. This is why you can rely upon the facts as here given.  I followed the investigation closely and missed nothing which could in any way  throw light on the case. It was a mysterious one from the first, and lost  nothing by further inquiry into the details.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  first fact to startle us as we made our way up through the crowd which blocked  halls and staircases was this:&mdash;A doctor had been found and, though he had been  forbidden to make more than a cursory examination of the body till the coroner  came, he had not hesitated to declare after his first look, that the wound had  not been made by a bullet but by some sharp and slender weapon thrust home by a  powerful hand. (You mark that, Mr. Gryce.) As this seemed impossible in face of  the fact that the door had been found buttoned on the inside, we did not give  much credit to his opinion and began our work under the obvious theory of an  accidental discharge of some gun from one of the windows across the court. But  the doctor was nearer right than we supposed. When the coroner came to look  into the matter, he discovered that the wound was not only too small to have  been made by the ordinary bullet, but that there was no bullet to be found in  the woman&rsquo;s body or anywhere else. Her heart had been reached by a thrust and  not by a shot from a gun. Mr. Gryce, have you not heard a startling repetition  of this report in a case nearer at hand?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  to go back. This discovery, so important if true, was as yet&mdash;that is, at the  time of our entering the room,&mdash;limited to the off-hand declaration of an  irresponsible physician, but the possibility it involved was of so astonishing  a nature that it influenced us unconsciously in our investigation and led us  almost immediately into a consideration of the difficulties attending an  entrance into, as well as an escape from, a room situated as this was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Up  three flights from the court, with no communication with the adjoining rooms  save through a door guarded on both sides by heavy pieces of furniture no one  person could handle, the hall door buttoned on the inside, and the fire-escape  some fifteen feet to the left, this room of death appeared to be as removed  from the approach of a murderous outsider as the spot in the writing-room of  the Clermont where Miss Challoner fell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Otherwise,  the place presented the greatest contrast possible to that scene of splendour  and comfort. I had not entered the Clermont at that time, and no, such  comparison could have struck my mind. But I have thought of it since, and you,  with your experience, will not find it difficult to picture the room where this  poor woman lived and worked. Bare walls, with just a newspaper illustration  pinned up here and there, a bed&mdash;tragically occupied at this moment&mdash;a kitchen  stove on which a boiler, half-filled with steaming clothes still bubbled and  foamed,&mdash;an old bureau,&mdash;a large pine wardrobe against an inner door which we  later found to have been locked for months, and the key lost,&mdash;some chairs&mdash;and  most pronounced of all, because of its position directly before the window, a  pine bench supporting a wash-tub of the old sort.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  it was here the woman fell, this tub naturally received the closest  examination. A board projected from its further side, whither it had evidently  been pushed by the weight of her falling body; and from its top hung a wet  cloth, marking with its lugubrious drip on the boards beneath the first heavy  moments of silence which is the natural accompaniment of so serious a survey.  On the floor to the right lay a half-used cake of soap just as it had slipped  from her hand. The window was closed, for the temperature was at the  freezing-point, but it had been found up, and it was put up now to show the  height at which it had then stood. As we all took our look at the house wall  opposite, a sound of shouting came up from below. A dozen children were sliding  on barrel staves down a slope of heaped-up snow. They had been engaged in this  sport all the afternoon and were our witnesses later that no one had made a  hazardous escape by means of the ladder of the fire-escape, running, as I have  said, at an almost unattainable distance towards the left.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  her own child, whose cries had roused the neighbours, nothing was to be seen.  The woman in the extreme rear had carried it off to her room; but when we came  to see it later, no doubt was felt by any of us that this child was too young  to talk connectedly, nor did I ever hear that it ever said anything which could  in any way guide investigation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that is as far as we ever got. The coroner&rsquo;s jury brought in a verdict of death  by means of a stab from some unknown weapon in the hand of a person also  unknown, but no weapon was ever found, nor was it ever settled how the attack  could have been made or the murderer escape under the conditions described. The  woman was poor, her friends few, and the case seemingly inexplicable. So after  creating some excitement by its peculiarities, it fell of its own weight. But I  remembered it, and in many a spare hour have tried to see my way through the  no-thoroughfare it presented. But quite in vain. To-day, the road is as blind  as ever, but&mdash;&rdquo; here Sweetwater&rsquo;s face sharpened and his eyes burned as he  leaned closer and closer to the older detective&mdash;&ldquo;<i>but</i> this second case, so  unlike the first in non-essentials but so exactly like it in just those points  which make the mystery, has dropped a thread from its tangled skein into my  hand, which may yet lead us to the heart of both. Can you guess&mdash;have you  guessed&mdash;what this thread is? But how could you without the one clew I have not  given you? Mr. Gryce, the tenement where this occurred is the same I visited  the other night in search of Mr. Brotherson. And the man characterised at that  time by the janitor as the best, the quietest and most respectable tenant in  the whole building, and the one you remember whose window opened directly  opposite the spot where this woman lay dead, was Mr. Dunn himself, or, in other  words, our late redoubtable witness, Mr. Orlando Brotherson.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_12"></a><b>Chapter 12<br>
    Mr. Gryce Finds An Antidote For Old Age</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought I should make you sit up. I really calculated upon doing so, sir. Yes,  I have established the plain fact that this Brotherson was near to, if not in  the exact line of the scene of crime in each of these extraordinary and  baffling cases. A very odd coincidence, is it not?&rdquo; was the dry conclusion of  our eager young detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Odd  enough if you are correct in your statement. But I thought it was conceded that  the man Brotherson was not personally near,&mdash;was not even in the building at the  time of the woman&rsquo;s death in Hicks Street; that he was out and had been out for  hours, according to the janitor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so the janitor thought, but he didn&rsquo;t quite know his man. I&rsquo;m not sure that I  do. But I mean to make his acquaintance and make it thoroughly before I let him  go. The hero&mdash;well, I will say the possible hero of two such adventures&mdash;deserves  some attention from one so interested in the abnormal as myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sweetwater,  how came you to discover that Mr. Dunn of this ramshackle tenement in Hicks  Street was identical with the elegantly equipped admirer of Miss Challoner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  this way. The night before Miss Challoner&rsquo;s death I was brooding very deeply  over the Hicks Street case. It had so possessed me that I had taken this street  in on my way from Flatbush; as if staring at the house and its swarming  courtyard was going to settle any such question as that! I walked by the place  and I looked up at the windows. No inspiration. Then I sauntered back and  entered the house with the fool intention of crossing the courtyard and  wandering into the rear building where the crime had occurred. But my attention  was diverted and my mind changed by seeing a man coming down the stairs before  me, of so fine a figure that I involuntarily stopped to look at him. Had he  moved a little less carelessly, had he worn his workman&rsquo;s clothes a little less  naturally, I should have thought him some college bred man out on a slumming  expedition. But he was entirely too much at home where he was, and too  unconscious of his jeans for any such conclusion on my part, and when he had  passed out I had enough curiosity to ask who he was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  interest, you may believe, was in no wise abated when I learned that he was  that highly respectable tenant whose window had been open at the time when half  the inmates of the two buildings had rushed up to his door, only to find a  paper on it displaying these words: <i>Gone to New York; will be back at 6:30</i>. Had  he returned at that hour? I don&rsquo;t think anybody had ever asked; and what reason  had I for such interference now? But an idea once planted in my brain sticks  tight, and I kept thinking of this man all the way to the Bridge. Instinctively  and quite against my will, I found myself connecting him with some previous  remembrance in which I seemed to see his tall form and strong features under  the stress of some great excitement. But there my memory stopped, till suddenly  as I was entering the subway, it all came back to me. I had met him the day I  went with the boys to investigate the case in Hicks Street. He was coming down  the staircase of the rear tenement then, very much as I had just seen him  coming down the one in front. Only the Dunn of to-day seemed to have all his  wits about him, while the huge fellow who brushed so rudely by me on that  occasion had the peculiar look of a man struggling with horror or some other  grave agitation. This was not surprising, of course, under the circumstances. I  had met more than one man and woman in those halls who had worn the same look;  but none of them had put up a sign on his door that he had left for New York  and would not be back till 6:30, and then changed his mind so suddenly that he  was back in the tenement at three, sharing the curiosity and the terrors of its  horrified inmates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the discovery, while possibly suggestive, was not of so pressing a nature as to  demand instant action; and more immediate duties coming up, I let the matter  slip from my mind, to be brought up again the next day, you may well believe,  when all the circumstances of the death at the Clermont came to light and I  found myself confronted by a problem very nearly the counterpart of the one  then occupying me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I did not see any real connection between the two cases, until, in my hunt for  Mr. Brotherson, I came upon the following facts: that he was not always the  gentleman he appeared: that the apartment in which he was supposed to live was  not his own but a friend&rsquo;s; and that he was only there by spells. When he was  there, he dressed like a prince and it was while so clothed he ate his meals in  the cafe of the Hotel Clermont.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  there were times when he had been seen to leave this apartment in a very  different garb, and while there was no one to insinuate that he was slack in  paying his debts or was given to dissipation or any overt vice, it was  generally conceded by such as casually knew him, that there was a mysterious  side to his life which no one understood. His friend&mdash;a seemingly candid and  open-minded gentleman&mdash;explained these contradictions by saying that Mr.  Brotherson was a humanitarian and spent much of his time in the slums. That  while so engaged he naturally dressed to suit the occasion, and if he was to be  criticised at all, it was for his zeal which often led him to extremes and kept  him to his task for days, during which time none of his up-town friends saw  him. Then this enthusiastic gentleman called him the great intellectual light  of the day, and&mdash;well, if ever I want a character I shall take pains to  insinuate myself into the good graces of this Mr. Conway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  Brotherson himself I saw nothing. He had come to Mr. Conway&rsquo;s apartment the  night before&mdash;the night of Miss Challoner&rsquo;s death, you understand but had  remained only long enough to change his clothes. Where he went afterwards is  unknown to Mr. Conway, nor can he tell us when to look for his return. When he  does show up, my message will be given him, etc., etc. I have no fault to find  with Mr. Conway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I had an idea in regard to this elusive Brotherson. I had heard enough about  him to be mighty sure that together with his other accomplishments he possessed  the golden tongue and easy speech of an orator. Also, that his tendencies were  revolutionary and that for all his fine clothes and hankering after table  luxuries and the like, he cherished a spite against wealth which made his words  under certain moods cut like a knife. But there was another man, known to us of  the &mdash; Precinct, who had very nearly these same gifts, and this man was going to  speak at a secret meeting that very evening. This we had been told by a  disgruntled member of the Associated Brotherhood. Suspecting Brotherson, I had  this prospective speaker described, and thought I recognised my man. But I  wanted to be positive in my identification, so I took Anderson with me, and&mdash;but  I&rsquo;ll cut that short. We didn&rsquo;t see the orator and that &lsquo;go&rsquo; went for nothing;  but I had another string to my bow in the shape of the workman Dunn who also  answered to the description which had been given me; so I lugged poor Anderson  over into Hicks Street.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was late for the visit I proposed, but not too late, if Dunn was also the  orator who, surprised by a raid I had not been let into, would be making for  his home, if only to establish an alibi. The subway was near, and I calculated  on his using it, but we took a taxicab and so arrived in Hicks Street some few  minutes before him. The result you know. Anderson recognised the man as the one  whom he saw washing his hands in the snow outside of the Clermont, and the man,  seeing himself discovered, owned himself to be Brotherson and made no  difficulty about accompanying us the next day to the coroner&rsquo;s office.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have heard how he bore himself; what his explanations were and how completely  they fitted in with the preconceived notions of the Inspector and the District  Attorney. In consequence, Miss Challoner&rsquo;s death is looked upon as a  suicide&mdash;the impulsive act of a woman who sees the man she may have scouted but  whom she secretly loves, turn away from her in all probability forever. A  weapon was in her hand&mdash;she impulsively used it, and another deplorable suicide  was added to the melancholy list. Had I put in my oar at the conference held in  the coroner&rsquo;s office; had I recalled to Dr. Heath the curious case of Mrs.  Spotts, and then identified Brotherson as the man whose window fronted hers  from the opposite tenement, a diversion might have been created and the outcome  been different. But I feared the experiment. I&rsquo;m not sufficiently in with the  Chief as yet, nor yet with the Inspector. They might not have called me a  fool&mdash;you may; but that&rsquo;s different&mdash;and they might have listened, but it would  doubtless have been with an air I could not have held up against, with that  fellow&rsquo;s eyes fixed mockingly on mine. For he and I are pitted for a struggle,  and I do not want to give him the advantage of even a momentary triumph. He&rsquo;s  the most complete master of himself of any man I ever met, and it will take the  united brain and resolution of the whole force to bring him to book&mdash;if he ever  is brought to book, which I doubt. What do you think about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  you have given me an antidote against old age,&rdquo; was the ringing and unexpected  reply, as the thoughtful, half-puzzled aspect of the old man yielded  impulsively to a burst of his early enthusiasm. &ldquo;If we can get a good grip on  the thread you speak of, and can work ourselves along by it, though it be by no  more than an inch at a time, we shall yet make our way through this labyrinth  of undoubted crime and earn for ourselves a triumph which will make some of  these raw and inexperienced young fellows about us stare. Sweetwater,  coincidences are possible. We run upon them every day. But coincidence in  crime! that should make work for a detective, and we are not afraid of work. There&rsquo;s  my hand for my end of the business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  here&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Next  minute the two heads were closer than ever together, and the business had  begun.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_13"></a><b>Chapter 13<br>
Time, Circumstance, And A Villain&rsquo;s Heart</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  first difficulty is this. We must prove motive. Now, I do not think it will be  so very hard to show that this Brotherson cherished feelings of revenge towards  Miss Challoner. But I have to acknowledge right here and now that the most  skillful and vigourous pumping of the janitor and such other tenants of the  Hicks Street tenement as I have dared to approach, fails to show that he has  ever held any communication with Mrs. Spotts, or even knew of her existence  until her remarkable death attracted his attention. I have spent all the  afternoon over this, and with no result. A complete break in the chain at the  very start.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  we will set that down, then, as so much against us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  next, and this is a bitter pill too, is the almost insurmountable difficulty  already recognised of determining how a man, without approaching his victim,  could manage to inflict a mortal stab in her breast. No cloak of complete  invisibility has yet been found, even by the cleverest criminals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True.  The problem is such as a nightmare offers. For years my dreams have been haunted  by a gnome who proposes just such puzzles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  there&rsquo;s an answer to everything, and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s an answer to this.  Remember his business. He&rsquo;s an inventor, with startling ideas. So much I&rsquo;ve  seen for myself. You may stretch probabilities a little in his case; and with  this conceded, we may add by way of off-set to the difficulties you mention,  coincidences of time and circumstance, and his villainous heart. Oh, I know  that I am prejudiced; but wait and see! Miss Challoner was well rid of him even  at the cost of her life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  loved him. Even her father believes that now. Some lately discovered letters  have come to light to prove that she was by no means so heart free as he  supposed. One of her friends, it seems, has also confided to him that once,  while she and Miss Challoner were sitting together, she caught Miss Challoner  in the act of scribbling capitals over a sheet of paper. They were all B&rsquo;s with  the exception of here and there a neatly turned O, and when her friend twitted  her with her fondness for these two letters, and suggested a pleasing monogram,  Miss Challoner answered, &lsquo;O. B. (transferring the letters, as you see) are the  initials of the finest man in the world.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gosh!  has he heard this story?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  gentleman in question.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Brotherson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so. It was told me in confidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Told  you, Mr. Gryce? Pardon my curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By  Mr. Challoner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  by Mr. Challoner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is greatly distressed at having the disgraceful suggestion of suicide attached  to his daughter&rsquo;s name. Notwithstanding the circumstances,&mdash;notwithstanding his  full recognition of her secret predilection for a man of whom he had never  heard till the night of her death, he cannot believe that she struck the blow  she did, intentionally. He sent for me in order to inquire if anything could be  done to reinstate her in public opinion. He dared not insist that another had  wielded the weapon which laid her low so suddenly, but he asked if, in my  experience, it had never been known that a woman, hyper-sensitive to some  strong man&rsquo;s magnetic influence, should so follow his thought as to commit an  act which never could have arisen in her own mind, uninfluenced. He evidently  does not like Brotherson either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what&mdash;what did you&mdash;say?&rdquo; asked Sweetwater, with a halting utterance and his face  full of thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  simply quoted the latest authority on hypnotism that no person even in hypnotic  sleep could be influenced by another to do what was antagonistic to his natural  instincts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Latest  authority. That doesn&rsquo;t mean a final one. Supposing that it was hypnotism! But  that wouldn&rsquo;t account for Mrs. Spotts&rsquo; death. Her wound certainly was not a  self-inflicted one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  can you be sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was no weapon found in the room, or in the court. The snow was searched and the  children too. No weapon, Mr. Gryce, not even a paper-cutter. Besides&mdash;but how  did Mr. Challoner take what you said? Was he satisfied with this assurance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  had to be. I didn&rsquo;t dare to hold out any hope based on so unsubstantial a  theory. But the interview had this effect upon me. If the possibility remains  of fixing guilt elsewhere than on Miss Challoner&rsquo;s inconsiderate impulse, I am  ready to devote any amount of time and strength to the work. To see this  grieving father relieved from the worst part of his burden is worth some effort  and now you know why I have listened so eagerly to you. Sweetwater, I will go  with you to the Superintendent. We may not gain his attention and again we may.  If we don&rsquo;t&mdash;but we won&rsquo;t cross that bridge prematurely. When will you be ready  for this business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must be at Headquarters to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good,  then let it be to-morrow. A taxicab, Sweetwater. The subway for the young. I  can no longer manage the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_14"></a><b>Chapter 14<br>
    A Concession</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true; there seems to be something extraordinary in the coincidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus  Mr. Brotherson, in the presence of the Inspector.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that is all there is to it,&rdquo; he easily proceeded. &ldquo;I knew Miss Challoner and I  have already said how much and how little I had to do with her death. The other  woman I did not know at all; I did not even know her name. A prosecution based  on grounds so flimsy as those you advance would savour of persecution, would it  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Inspector, surprised by this unexpected attack, regarded the speaker with an  interest rather augmented than diminished by his boldness. The smile with which  he had uttered these concluding words yet lingered on his lips, lighting up  features of a mould too suggestive of command to be associated readily with  guilt. That the impression thus produced was favourable, was evident from the  tone of the Inspector&rsquo;s reply:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have said nothing about prosecution, Mr. Brotherson. We hope to avoid any such  extreme measures, and that we may the more readily do so, we have given you  this opportunity to make such explanations as the situation, which you yourself  have characterised as remarkable, seems to call for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am ready. But what am I called upon to explain? I really cannot see, sir.  Knowing nothing more about either case than you do, I fear that I shall not add  much to your enlightenment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can tell us why with your seeming culture and obvious means, you choose to  spend so much time in a second-rate tenement like the one in Hicks Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  that chill smile preceding the quiet answer:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you seen my room there? It is piled to the ceiling with books. When I was a  poor man, I chose the abode suited to my purse and my passion for first-rate  reading. As I grew better off, my time became daily more valuable. I have never  seen the hour when I felt like moving that precious collection. Besides, I am a  man of the people. I like the working class, and am willing to be thought one  of them. I can find time to talk to a hard-pushed mechanic as easily as to such  members of the moneyed class as I encounter on stray evenings at the Hotel  Clermont. I have led&mdash;I may say that I am leading&mdash;a double life; but of neither  am I ashamed, nor have I cause to be. Love drove me to ape the gentleman in the  halls of the Clermont; a broad human interest in the work of the world, to live  as a fellow among the mechanics of Hicks Street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why make use of one name as a gentleman of leisure and quite a different one as  the honest workman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  there you touch upon my real secret. I have a reason for keeping my identity quiet  till my invention is completed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  reason connected with your anarchistic tendencies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;  But the word was uttered in a way to carry little conviction. &ldquo;I am not much of  an anarchist,&rdquo; he now took the trouble to declare, with a careless lift of his  shoulders. &ldquo;I like fair play, but I shall never give you much trouble by my  manner of insuring it. I have too much at stake. My invention is dearer to me  than the overthrow of present institutions. Nothing must stand in the way of  its success, not even the satisfaction of inspiring terror in minds shut to  every other species of argument. I have uttered my last speech; you can rely on  me for that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are glad to hear it, Mr. Dunn. Physical overthrow carries more than the  immediate sufferer with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>If  this were meant as an irritant, it did not act successfully. The social  agitator, the political demagogue, the orator whose honeyed tones had rung with  biting invective in the ears of the United Brotherhood of the Awl, the Plane  and the Trowel, simply bowed and calmly waited for the next attack.</p>
  <p>Perhaps  it was of a nature to surprise even him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have no wish,&rdquo; continued the Inspector, &ldquo;to probe too closely into concerns  seemingly quite removed from the main issue. You say that you are ready, nay  more, are even eager to answer all questions. You will probably be anxious then  to explain away a discrepancy between your word and your conduct, which has  come to our attention. You were known to have expressed the intention of  spending the afternoon of Mrs. Spotts&rsquo; death in New York and were supposed to  have done so, yet you were certainly seen in the crowd which invaded that rear  building at the first alarm. Are you conscious of possessing a double, or did  you fail to cross the river as you expected to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am  glad this has come up.&rdquo; The tone was one of self-congratulation which would  have shaken Sweetwater sorely had he been admitted to this unofficial  examination. &ldquo;I have never confided to any one the story of my doings on that  unhappy afternoon, because I knew of no one who would take any interest in  them. But this is what occurred. I did mean to go to New York and I even  started on my walk to the Bridge at the hour mentioned. But I got into a small  crowd on the corner of Fulton Street, in which a poor devil who had robbed a  vendor&rsquo;s cart of a few oranges, was being hustled about. There was no policeman  within sight, and so I busied myself there for a minute paying for the oranges  and dragging the poor wretch away into an alley, where I could have the pleasure  of seeing him eat them. When I came out of the alley the small crowd had  vanished, but a big one was collecting up the street very near my home. I  always think of my books when I see anything suggesting fire, and naturally I  returned, and equally naturally, when I heard what had happened, followed the  crowd into the court and so up to the poor woman&rsquo;s doorway. But my curiosity  satisfied, I returned at once to the street and went to New York as I had  planned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mind telling us where you went in New York?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. I went shopping. I wanted a certain very fine wire, for an experiment I  had on hand, and I found it in a little shop in Fourth Avenue. If I remember  rightly, the name over the door was Grippus. Its oddity struck me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was nothing left to the Inspector but to dismiss him. He had answered all  questions willingly, and with a countenance inexpressive of guile. He even  indulged in a parting shot on his own account, as full of frank acceptance of  the situation as it was fearless in its attack. As he halted in the doorway  before turning his back upon the room, he smiled for the third time as he  quietly said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have ceased visiting my friend&rsquo;s apartment in upper New York. If you ever want  me again, you will find me amongst my books. If my invention halts and other  interests stale, you have furnished me this day with a problem which cannot  fail to give continual occupation to my energies. If I succeed in solving it  first, I shall be happy to share my knowledge with you. Till then, trust the laws  of nature. No man when once on the outside of a door can button it on the  inside, nor could any one without the gift of complete invisibility, make a  leap of over fifteen feet from the sill of a fourth story window on to an  adjacent fire escape, without attracting the attention of some of the many  children playing down below.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was half-way out the door, but his name quickly spoken by the Inspector drew  him back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything  more?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>The  Inspector smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a man of considerable analytic power, as I take it, Mr. Brotherson. You  must have decided long ago how this woman died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that a question, Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may take it as such.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I will allow myself to say that there is but one common-sense view to take of  the matter. Miss Challoner&rsquo;s death was due to suicide; so was that of the  washerwoman. But there I stop. As for the means&mdash;the motive&mdash;such mysteries may  be within your province but they are totally outside mine! God help us all! The  world is full of misery. Again I wish you good-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  air seemed to have lost its vitality and the sun its sparkle when he was gone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  what do you think, Gryce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old man rose and came out of his corner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This:  that I&rsquo;m up against the hardest proposition of my lifetime. Nothing in the  man&rsquo;s appearance or manner evinces guilt, yet I believe him guilty. I must. Not  to, is to strain probability to the point of breakage. But how to reach him is  a problem and one of no ordinary nature. Years ago, when I was but little older  than Sweetwater, I had just such a conviction concerning a certain man against  whom I had even less to work on than we have here. A murder had been committed  by an envenomed spring contained in a toy puzzle. I worked upon the conscience  of the suspect in that case, by bringing constantly before his eyes a <i>facsimile</i>  of that spring. It met him in the folded napkin which he opened at his  restaurant dinner. He stumbled upon it in the street, and found it lying  amongst his papers at home. I gave him no relief and finally he succumbed. He  had been almost driven mad by remorse. But this man has no conscience. If he is  not innocent as the day, he&rsquo;s as hard as unquarried marble. He might be  confronted with reminders of his crime at every turn without weakening or  showing by loss of appetite or interrupted sleep any effect upon his nerves.  That&rsquo;s my opinion of the gentleman. He is either that, or a man of uncommon  force and self-restraint.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  inclined to believe him the latter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so give the whole matter the go-by?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Possibly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be a terrible disappointment to Sweetwater.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  to <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  different. I&rsquo;m disposed to consider you, Gryce&mdash;after all these years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you; I have done the state some service.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you want? You say the mine is unworkable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  in a day, or in a week, possibly in a month. But persistence and a protean  adaptability to meet his moods might accomplish something. I don&rsquo;t say <i>will</i>, I  only say <i>might</i>. If Sweetwater had the job, with unlimited time in which to  carry out any plan he may have, or even for a change of plans to suit a changed  idea, success might be his, and both time, effort and outlay justified.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  outlay? I am thinking of the outlay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Challoner will see to that. I have his word that no reasonable amount will  daunt him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  this Brotherson is suspicious. He has an inventor&rsquo;s secret to hide, if none  other. We can&rsquo;t saddle him with a guy of Sweetwater&rsquo;s appearance and abnormal  loquaciousness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  readily, I own. But time will bring counsel. Are you willing to help the boy,  to help me and possibly yourself by this venture in the dark? The Department  shan&rsquo;t lose money by it; that&rsquo;s all I can promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s a big one. Gryce, you shall have your way. You&rsquo;ll be the only loser if you  fail; and you will fail; take my word for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish I could speak as confidently to the contrary, but I can&rsquo;t. I can give you  my hand though, Inspector, and Sweetwater&rsquo;s thanks. I can meet the boy now. An  hour ago I didn&rsquo;t know how I was to do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_15"></a><b>Chapter 15<br>
    That&rsquo;s The Question</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;How  many times has he seen you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  that he knows your face and figure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid so. He cannot help remembering the man who faced him in his own room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  unfortunate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damned  unfortunate; but one must expect some sort of a handicap in a game like this.  Before I&rsquo;m done with him, he&rsquo;ll look me full in the face and wonder if he&rsquo;s  ever seen me before. I wasn&rsquo;t always a detective. I was a carpenter once, as  you know, and I&rsquo;ll take to the tools again. As soon as I&rsquo;m handy with them I&rsquo;ll  hunt up lodgings in Hicks Street. He may suspect me at first, but he won&rsquo;t  long; I&rsquo;ll be such a confounded good workman. I only wish I hadn&rsquo;t such  pronounced features. They&rsquo;ve stood awfully in my way, Mr. Gryce. I don&rsquo;t like  to talk about my appearance, but I&rsquo;m so confounded plain that people remember  me. Why couldn&rsquo;t I have had one of those putty faces which don&rsquo;t mean anything?  It would have been a deuced sight more convenient.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  done very well as it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I want to do better. I want to deceive him to his face. He&rsquo;s clever, this same  Brotherson, and there&rsquo;s glory to be got in making a fool of him. Do you think  it could be done with a beard? I&rsquo;ve never worn a beard. While I&rsquo;m settling back  into my old trade, I can let the hair grow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do.  It&rsquo;ll make you look as weak as water. It&rsquo;ll be blonde, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  silky and straggling. Charming addition to my beauty. But it&rsquo;ll take half an  inch off my nose, and it&rsquo;ll cover my mouth, which means a lot in my case. Then  my complexion! It must be changed naturally. I&rsquo;ll consult a doctor about that.  No sort of make-believe will go with this man. If my eyes look weak, they must  really be so. If I walk slowly and speak huskily, it must be because I cannot  help it. I can bear the slight inconvenience of temporary ill-health in a cause  like this; and if necessary the cough will be real, and the headache positive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sweetwater!  We&rsquo;d better give the task to another man&mdash;to someone Brotherson has never seen  and won&rsquo;t be suspicious of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  be suspicious of everybody who tries to make friends with him now; only a  little more so with me; that&rsquo;s all. But I&rsquo;ve got to meet that, and I&rsquo;ll do it  by being, temporarily, of course, exactly the man I seem. My health will not be  good for the next few weeks, I&rsquo;m sure of that. But I&rsquo;ll be a model workman,  neat and conscientious with just a suspicion of dash where dash is needed. He  knows the real thing when he sees it, and there&rsquo;s not a fellow living more  alive to shams. I won&rsquo;t be a sham. I&rsquo;ll be it. You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the doubt. Can you do all this in doubt of the issue?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I must have confidence in the end, and I must believe in his guilt. Nothing  else will carry me through. I <i>must</i> believe in his guilt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s essential.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I do. I never was surer of anything than I am of that. But I&rsquo;ll have the deuce  of a time to get evidence enough for a grand jury. That&rsquo;s plainly to be seen,  and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m so dead set on the business. It&rsquo;s such an even toss-up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t call it even. He&rsquo;s got the start of you every way. You can&rsquo;t go to his  tenement; the janitor there would recognise you even if he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  I will give you a piece of good news. They&rsquo;re to have a new janitor next week.  I learned that yesterday. The present one is too easy. He&rsquo;ll be out long before  I&rsquo;m ready to show myself there; and so will the woman who took care of the poor  washerwoman&rsquo;s little child. I&rsquo;d not have risked her curiosity. Luck isn&rsquo;t all  against us. How does Mr. Challoner feel about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  very confident; but willing to give you any amount of rope. Sweetwater, he let  me have a batch of letters written by his daughter which he found in a secret  drawer. They are not to be read, or even opened, unless a great necessity  arises. They were written for Brotherson&rsquo;s eye&mdash;or so the father says&mdash;but she never  sent them; too exuberant perhaps. If you ever want them&mdash;I cannot give them to  you to-night, and wouldn&rsquo;t if I could,&mdash;don&rsquo;t go to Mr. Challoner&mdash;you must never  be seen at his hotel&mdash;and don&rsquo;t come to me, but to the little house in West  Twenty-ninth Street, where they will be kept for you, tied up in a package with  your name on it. By the way, what name are you going to work under?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  mother&rsquo;s&mdash;Zugg.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  I&rsquo;ll remember. You can always write or even telephone to Twenty-ninth Street.  I&rsquo;m in constant communication with them there, and it&rsquo;s quite safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks.  You&rsquo;re sure the Superintendent is with me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but not the Inspector. He sees nothing but the victim of a strange coincidence  in Orlando Brotherson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Again  the scales hang even. But they won&rsquo;t remain so. One side is bound to rise.  Which? That&rsquo;s the question, Mr. Gryce.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_16"></a><b>Chapter 16<br>
    Opposed</b></h2>
  <p>There  was a new tenant in the Hicks Street tenement. He arrived late one afternoon  and was shown two rooms, one in the rear building and another in the front one.  Both were on the fourth floor. He demurred at the former, thought it gloomy but  finally consented to try it. The other, he said, was too expensive. The  janitor&mdash;new to the business&mdash;was not much taken with him and showed it, which  seemed to offend the newcomer, who was evidently an irritable fellow owing to  ill health.</p>
  <p>However,  they came to terms as I have said, and the man went away, promising to send in  his belongings the next day. He smiled as he said this and the janitor who had  rarely seen such a change take place in a human face, looked uncomfortable for  a moment and seemed disposed to make some remark about the room they were  leaving. But, thinking better of it, locked the door and led the way  downstairs. As the prospective tenant followed, he may have noticed, probably  did, that the door they had just left was a new one&mdash;the only new thing to be  seen in the whole shabby place.</p>
  <p>The  next night that door was locked on the inside. The young man had taken  possession. As he put away the remnants of a meal he had cooked for himself, he  cast a look at his surroundings, and imperceptibly sighed. Then he brightened  again, and sitting down on his solitary chair, he turned his eyes on the window  which, uncurtained and without shade, stared open-mouthed, as it were, at the  opposite wall rising high across the court.</p>
  <p>In  that wall, one window only seemed to interest him and that was on a level with  his own. The shade of this window was up, but there was no light back of it and  so nothing of the interior could be seen. But his eye remained fixed upon it,  while his hand, stretched out towards the lamp burning near him, held itself in  readiness to lower the light at a minute&rsquo;s notice.</p>
  <p>Did  he see only the opposite wall and that unillumined window? Was there no memory  of the time when, in a previous contemplation of those dismal panes, he beheld  stretching between them and himself, a long, low bench with a plain wooden tub  upon it, from which a dripping cloth beat out upon the boards beneath a dismal  note, monotonous as the ticking of a clock?</p>
  <p>One  might judge that such memories were indeed his, from the rapid glance he cast  behind him at the place where the bed had stood in those days. It was placed  differently now.</p>
  <p>But  if he saw, and if he heard these suggestions from the past, he was not less  alive to the exactions of the present, for, as his glance flew back across the  court, his finger suddenly moved and the flame it controlled sputtered and went  out. At the same instant, the window opposite sprang into view as the lamp was  lit within, and for several minutes the whole interior remained visible&mdash;the  books, the work-table, the cluttered furniture, and, most interesting of all,  its owner and occupant. It was upon the latter that the newcomer fixed his  attention, and with an absorption equal to that he saw expressed in the  countenance opposite.</p>
  <p>But  his was the absorption of watchfulness; that of the other of introspection. Mr.  Brotherson&mdash;(we will no longer call him Dunn even here where he is known by no  other name)&mdash;had entered the room clad in his heavy overcoat and, not having  taken it off before lighting his lamp, still stood with it on, gazing eagerly  down at the model occupying the place of honour on the large centre table. He  was not touching it,&mdash;not at this moment&mdash;but that his thoughts were with it,  that his whole mind was concentrated on it, was evident to the watcher across  the court; and, as this watcher took in this fact and noticed the loving care  with which the enthusiastic inventor finally put out his finger to re-arrange a  thread or twirl a wheel, his disappointment found utterance in a sigh which  echoed sadly through the dull and cheerless room. Had he expected this stern  and self-contained man to show an open indifference to work and the hopes of a  lifetime? If so, this was the first of the many surprises awaiting him.</p>
  <p>He  was gifted, however, with the patience of an automaton and continued to watch  his fellow tenant as long as the latter&rsquo;s shade remained up. When it fell, he  rose and took a few steps up and down, but not with the celerity and precision  which usually accompanied his movements. Doubt disturbed his mind and impeded  his activity. He had caught a fair glimpse of Brotherson&rsquo;s face as he  approached the window, and though it continued to show abstraction, it equally  displayed serenity and a complete satisfaction with the present if not with the  future. Had he mistaken his man after all? Was his instinct, for the first time  in his active career, wholly at fault?</p>
  <p>He  had succeeded in getting a glimpse of his quarry in the privacy of his own  room, at home with his thoughts and unconscious of any espionage, and how had  he found him? Cheerful, and natural in all his movements.</p>
  <p>But  the evening was young. Retrospect comes with later and more lonely hours. There  will be opportunities yet for studying this impassive countenance under much  more telling and productive circumstances than these. He would await these  opportunities with cheerful anticipation. Meanwhile, he would keep up the  routine watch he had planned for this night. Something might yet occur. At all  events he would have exhausted the situation from this standpoint.</p>
  <p>And  so it came to pass that at an hour when all the other hard-working people in  the building were asleep, or at least striving to sleep, these two men still  sat at their work, one in the light, the other in the darkness, facing each  other, consciously to the one, unconsciously to the other, across the hollow  well of the now silent court. Eleven o&rsquo;clock! Twelve! No change on Brotherson&rsquo;s  part or in Brotherson&rsquo;s room; but a decided one in the place where Sweetwater  sat. Objects which had been totally indistinguishable even to his penetrating  eye could now be seen in ever brightening outline. The moon had reached the  open space above the court, and he was getting the full benefit of it. But it  was a benefit he would have been glad to dispense with. Darkness was like a  shield to him. He did not feel quite sure that he wanted this shield removed.  With no curtain to the window and no shade, and all this brilliance pouring  into the room, he feared the disclosure of his presence there, or, if not that,  some effect on his own mind of those memories he was more anxious to see  mirrored in another&rsquo;s discomfiture than in his own.</p>
  <p>Was  it to escape any lack of concentration which these same memories might bring,  that he rose and stepped to the window? Or was it under one of those  involuntary impulses which move us in spite of ourselves to do the very thing  our judgment disapproves?</p>
  <p>No  sooner had he approached the sill than Mr. Brotherson&rsquo;s shade flew way up and  he, too, looked out. Their glances met, and for an instant the hardy detective  experienced that involuntary stagnation of the blood which follows an inner  shock. He felt that he had been recognised. The moonlight lay full upon his  face, and the other had seen and known him. Else, why the constrained attitude  and sudden rigidity observable in this confronting figure, with its partially  lifted hand? A man like Brotherson makes no pause in any action however trivial,  without a reason. Either he had been transfixed by this glimpse of his enemy on  watch, or daring thought! had seen enough of sepulchral suggestion in the wan  face looking forth from this fatal window to shake him from his composure and  let loose the grinning devil of remorse from its iron prison-house? If so, the  movement was a memorable one, and the hazard quite worth while. He had  gained&mdash;no! he had gained nothing. He had been the fool of his own wishes. No  one, let alone Brotherson, could have mistaken his face for that of a woman. He  had forgotten his newly-grown beard. Some other cause must be found for the  other&rsquo;s attitude. It savoured of shock, if not fear. If it were fear, then had  he roused an emotion which might rebound upon himself in sharp reprisal. Death  had been known to strike people standing where he stood; mysterious death of a  species quite unrecognisable. What warranty had he that it would not strike  him, and now? None.</p>
  <p>Yet  it was Brotherson who moved first. With a shrug of the shoulder plainly visible  to the man opposite, he turned away from the window and without lowering the  shade began gathering up his papers for the night, and later banking up his  stove with ashes.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  with a breath of decided relief, stepped back and threw himself on the bed. It  had really been a trial for him to stand there under the other&rsquo;s eye, though  his mind refused to formulate his fear, or to give him any satisfaction when he  asked himself what there was in the situation suggestive of death to the woman or  harm to himself.</p>
  <p>Nor  did morning light bring counsel, as is usual in similar cases. He felt the  mystery more in the hubbub and restless turmoil of the day than in the night&rsquo;s  silence and inactivity. He was glad when the stroke of six gave him an excuse to  leave the room, and gladder yet when in doing so, he ran upon an old woman from  a neighbouring room, who no sooner saw him than she leered at him and eagerly  remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  much sleep, eh? We didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d like it. Did you see anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now  this gave him the one excuse he wanted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  anything?&rdquo; he repeated, apparently with all imaginable innocence. &ldquo;What do you  mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you know what happened in that room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  tell me!&rdquo; he shouted out. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear any nonsense. I haven&rsquo;t time.  I&rsquo;ve got to be at the shop at seven and I don&rsquo;t feel very well. What did  happen?&rdquo; he mumbled in drawing off, just loud enough for the woman to hear.  &ldquo;Something unpleasant I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo; Then he ran downstairs.</p>
  <p>At  half past six he found the janitor. He was, to all appearance, in a state of  great excitement and he spoke very fast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t stay another night in that room,&rdquo; he loudly declared, breaking in where  the family were eating breakfast by lamplight. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make any  trouble and I don&rsquo;t want to give my reasons; but that room don&rsquo;t suit me. I&rsquo;d  rather take the dark one you talked about yesterday. There&rsquo;s the money. Have my  things moved to-day, will ye?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  your moving out after one night&rsquo;s stay will give that room a bad name,&rdquo;  stammered the janitor, rising awkwardly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be talk and I won&rsquo;t be able  to let that room all winter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense!  Every man hasn&rsquo;t the nerves I have. You&rsquo;ll let it in a week. But let or not  let, I&rsquo;m going front into the little dark room. I&rsquo;ll get the boss to let me off  at half past four. So that&rsquo;s settled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  waited for no reply and got none; but when he appeared promptly at a quarter to  five, he found his few belongings moved into a middle room on the fourth floor  of the front building, which, oddly perhaps, chanced to be next door to the one  he had held under watch the night before.</p>
  <p>The  first page of his adventure in the Hicks Street tenement had been turned, and  he was ready to start upon another.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_17"></a><b>Chapter 17<br>
    In Which A Book Plays A Leading Part</b></h2>
  <p>When  Mr. Brotherson came in that night, he noticed that the door of the room  adjoining his own stood open. He did not hesitate. Making immediately for it,  he took a glance inside, then spoke up with a ringing intonation:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Halloo!  coming to live in this hole?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  occupant a young man, evidently a workman and somewhat sickly if one could  judge from his complexion&mdash;turned around from some tinkering he was engaged in  and met the intruder fairly, face to face. If his jaw fell, it seemed to be  from admiration. No other emotion would have so lighted his eye as he took in  the others proportions and commanding features. No dress&mdash;Brotherson was never  seen in any other than the homeliest garb in these days&mdash;could make him look  common or akin to his surroundings. Whether seen near or far, his presence  always caused surprise, and surprise was what the young man showed, as he  answered briskly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  this is to be my castle. Are you the owner of the buildings? If so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not the owner. I live next door. Haven&rsquo;t I seen you before, young man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Never  was there a more penetrating eye than Orlando Brotherson&rsquo;s. As he asked this  question it took some effort on the part of the other to hold his own and laugh  with perfect naturalness as he replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you ever go up Henry Street it&rsquo;s likely enough that you&rsquo;ve seen me not once,  but many times. I&rsquo;m the fellow who works at the bench next the window in  Schuper&rsquo;s repairing shop. Everybody knows me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Audacity  often carries the day when subtler means would fail. Brotherson stared at the  youth, then ventured another question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  carpenter, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and I&rsquo;m an A1 man at my job. Excuse my brag. It&rsquo;s my one card of introduction.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  seen you. I&rsquo;ve seen you somewhere else than in Schuper&rsquo;s shop. Do you remember  me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir; I&rsquo;m sorry to be imperlite but I don&rsquo;t remember you at all. Won&rsquo;t you sit  down? It&rsquo;s not very cheerful, but I&rsquo;m so glad to get out of the room I was in  last night that this looks all right to me. Back there, other building,&rdquo; he  whispered. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know, and took the room which had a window in it; but&mdash;&rdquo;  The stop was significant; so was his smile which had a touch of sickliness in  it, as well as humour.</p>
  <p>But  Brotherson was not to be caught.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  slept in the building last night? In the other half, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I&mdash;slept.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  strong lip of the other man curled disdainfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You were standing in the window overlooking the court. You  were not sleeping then. I suppose you know that a woman died in that room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  they told me so this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  that the first you&rsquo;d heard of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo;  The word almost jumped at the questioner. &ldquo;Do you suppose I&rsquo;d have taken the  room if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  here the intruder, with a disdainful grunt, turned and went out, disgust in  every feature,&mdash;plain, unmistakable, downright disgust, and nothing more!</p>
  <p>This  was what gave Sweetwater his second bad night; this and a certain discovery he  made. He had counted on hearing what went on in the neighbouring room through  the partition running back of his own closet. But he could hear nothing, unless  it was the shutting down of a window, a loud sneeze, or the rattling of coals  as they were put on the fire. And these possessed no significance. What he  wanted was to catch the secret sigh, the muttered word, the involuntary  movement. He was too far removed from this man still.</p>
  <p>How  should he manage to get nearer him&mdash;at the door of his mind&mdash;of his heart?  Sweetwater stared all night from his miserable cot into the darkness of that  separating closet, and with no result. His task looked hopeless; no wonder that  he could get no rest.</p>
  <p>Next  morning he felt ill, but he rose all the same, and tried to get his own  breakfast. He had but partially succeeded and was sitting on the edge of his  bed in wretched discomfort, when the very man he was thinking of appeared at  his door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  come to see how you are,&rdquo; said Brotherson. &ldquo;I noticed that you did not look  well last night. Won&rsquo;t you come in and share my pot of coffee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  can&rsquo;t eat,&rdquo; mumbled Sweetwater, for once in his life thrown completely off his  balance. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very kind, but I&rsquo;ll manage all right. I&rsquo;d rather. I&rsquo;m not  quite dressed, you see, and I must get to the shop.&rdquo; Then he thought&mdash;&ldquo;What an  opportunity I&rsquo;m losing. Have I any right to turn tail because he plays his game  from the outset with trumps? No, I&rsquo;ve a small trump somewhere about me to lay  on this trick. It isn&rsquo;t an ace, but it&rsquo;ll show I&rsquo;m not chicane.&rdquo; And smiling,  though not with his usual cheerfulness, Sweetwater added, &ldquo;Is the coffee all  made? I might take a drop of that. But you mustn&rsquo;t ask me to eat&mdash;I just  couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  the coffee is made and it isn&rsquo;t bad either. You&rsquo;d better put on your coat; the  hall&rsquo;s draughty.&rdquo; And waiting till Sweetwater did so, he led the way back to  his own room. Brotherson&rsquo;s manner expressed perfect ease, Sweetwater&rsquo;s not. He  knew himself changed in looks, in bearing, in feeling, even; but was he changed  enough to deceive this man on the very spot where they had confronted each  other a few days before in a keen moral struggle? The looking-glass he passed  on his way to the table where the simple breakfast was spread out, showed him a  figure so unlike the alert, business-like chap he had been that night, that he  felt his old assurance revive in time to ease a situation which had no  counterpart in his experience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going out myself to-day, so we&rsquo;ll have to hurry a bit,&rdquo; was Brotherson&rsquo;s first  remark as they seated themselves at table. &ldquo;Do you like your coffee plain or  with milk in it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Plain.  Gosh! what pictures! Where do you get &lsquo;em? You must have a lot of coin.&rdquo;  Sweetwater was staring at the row of photographs, mostly of a very high order,  tacked along the wall separating the two rooms. They were unframed, but they  were mostly copies of great pictures, and the effect was rather imposing in  contrast to the shabby furniture and the otherwise homely fittings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I&rsquo;ve enough for that kind of thing,&rdquo; was his host&rsquo;s reply. But the tone was  reserved, and Sweetwater did not presume again along this line. Instead, he  looked well at the books piled upon the shelves under these photographs, and  wondered aloud at their number and at the man who could waste such a lot of  time in reading them. But he made no more direct remarks. Was he cowed by the  penetrating eye he encountered whenever he yielded to the fascination exerted  by Mr. Brotherson&rsquo;s personality and looked his way? He hated to think so, yet  something held him in check and made him listen, open-mouthed, when the other  chose to speak.</p>
  <p>Yet  there was one cheerful moment. It was when he noticed the careless way in which  those books were arranged upon their shelves. An idea had come to him. He hid  his relief in his cup, as he drained the last drops of the coffee which really  tasted better than he had expected.</p>
  <p>When  he returned from work that afternoon it was with an auger under his coat and a  conviction which led him to empty out the contents of a small phial which he  took down from a shelf. He had told Mr. Gryce that he was eager for the  business because of its difficulties, but that was when he was feeling fine and  up to any game which might come his way. Now he felt weak and easily  discouraged. This would not do. He must regain his health at all hazards, so he  poured out the mixture which had given him such a sickly air. This done and a  rude supper eaten, he took up his auger. He had heard Mr. Brotherson&rsquo;s step go  by. But next minute he laid it down again in great haste and flung a newspaper  over it. Mr. Brotherson was coming back, had stopped at his door, had knocked  and must be let in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  better this evening,&rdquo; he heard in those kindly tones which so confused and  irritated him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  was the surly admission. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s stifling here. If I have to live long in  this hole I&rsquo;ll dry up from want of air. It&rsquo;s near the shop or I wouldn&rsquo;t stay  out the week.&rdquo; Twice this day he had seen Brotherson&rsquo;s tall figure stop before  the window of this shop and look in at him at his bench. But he said nothing  about that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  agreed the other, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no way to live. But you&rsquo;re alone. Upstairs there&rsquo;s a  whole family huddled into a room just like this. Two of the kids sleep in the  closet. It&rsquo;s things like that which have made me the friend of the poor, and  the mortal enemy of men and women who spread themselves over a dozen big rooms  and think themselves ill-used if the gas burns poorly or a fireplace smokes.  I&rsquo;m off for the evening; anything I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Show  me how I can win my way into such rooms as you&rsquo;ve just talked about. Nothing  less will make me look up. I&rsquo;d like to sleep in one to-night. In the best  bedroom, sir. I&rsquo;m ambitious; I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  poor joke, though they both laughed. There Mr. Brotherson passed on, and  Sweetwater listened till he was sure that his too attentive neighbour had  really gone down the three flights between him and the street. Then he took up  his auger again and shut himself up in his closet.</p>
  <p>There  was nothing peculiar about this closet. It was just an ordinary one with  drawers and shelves on one side, and an open space on the other for the hanging  up of clothes. Very few clothes hung there at present; but it was in this  portion of the closet that he stopped and began to try the wall of Brotherson&rsquo;s  room, with the butt end of the tool he carried.</p>
  <p>The  sound seemed to satisfy him, for very soon he was boring a hole at a point  exactly level with his ear; but not without frequent pauses and much attention  given to the possible return of those departed foot-steps. He remembered that  Mr. Brotherson had a way of coming back on unexpected errands after giving out  his intention of being absent for hours.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  did not want to be caught in any such trap as that; so he carefully followed  every sound that reached him from the noisy halls. But he did not forsake his  post; he did not have to. Mr. Brotherson had been sincere in his good-bye, and  the auger finished its job and was withdrawn without any interruption from the  man whose premises had been thus audaciously invaded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neat  as well as useful,&rdquo; was the gay comment with which Sweetwater surveyed his  work, then laid his ear to the hole. Whereas previously he could barely hear  the rattling of coals from the coal-scuttle, he was now able to catch the sound  of an ash falling into the ash-pit.</p>
  <p>His  next move was to test the depth of the partition by inserting his finger in the  hole he had made. He found it stopped by some obstacle before it had reached  half its length, and anxious to satisfy himself of the nature of this obstacle,  he gently moved the tip of his finger to and fro over what was certainly the  edge of a book.</p>
  <p>This  proved that his calculations had been correct and that the opening so  accessible on his side, was completely veiled on the other by the books he had  seen packed on the shelves. As these shelves had no other backing than the  wall, he had feared striking a spot not covered by a book. But he had not  undertaken so risky a piece of work without first noting how nearly the tops of  the books approached the line of the shelf above them, and the consequent  unlikelihood of his striking the space between, at the height he planned the  hole. He had even been careful to assure himself that all the volumes at this  exact point stood far enough forward to afford room behind them for the chips  and plaster he must necessarily push through with his auger, and also&mdash;important  consideration&mdash;for the free passage of the sounds by which he hoped to profit.</p>
  <p>As  he listened for a moment longer, and then stooped to gather up the debris which  had fallen on his own side of the partition, he muttered, in his old  self-congratulatory way:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  the devil don&rsquo;t interfere in some way best known to himself, this opportunity I  have made for myself of listening to this arrogant fellow&rsquo;s very heartbeats  should give me some clew to his secret. As soon as I can stand it, I&rsquo;ll spend  my evenings at this hole.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  it was days before he could trust himself so far. Meanwhile their acquaintance  ripened, though with no very satisfactory results. The detective found himself  led into telling stories of his early home-life to keep pace with the man who  always had something of moment and solid interest to impart. This was undesirable,  for instead of calling out a corresponding confidence from Brotherson, it only  seemed to make his conversation more coldly impersonal.</p>
  <p>In  consequence, Sweetwater suddenly found himself quite well and one evening, when  he was sure that his neighbour was at home, he slid softly into his closet and  laid his ear to the opening he had made there. The result was unexpected. Mr.  Brotherson was pacing the floor, and talking softly to himself.</p>
  <p>At  first, the cadence and full music of the tones conveyed nothing to our far from  literary detective. The victim of his secret machinations was expressing  himself in words, <i>words;</i>&mdash;that was the point which counted with him. But as he  listened longer and gradually took in the sense of these words, his heart went  down lower and lower till it reached his boots. His inscrutable and ever  disappointing neighbour was not indulging in self-communings of any kind. He  was reciting poetry, and what was worse, poetry which he only half remembered  and was trying to recall;&mdash;an incredible occupation for a man weighted with a  criminal secret.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  was disgusted, and was withdrawing in high indignation from his vantage-point  when something occurred of a startling enough nature to hold him where he was  in almost breathless expectation.</p>
  <p>The  hole which in the darkness of the closet was always faintly visible, even when  the light was not very strong in the adjoining room, had suddenly become a  bright and shining loop-hole, with a suggestion of movement in the space  beyond. The book which had hid this hole on Brotherson&rsquo;s side had been taken  down&mdash;the one book in all those hundreds whose removal threatened Sweetwater&rsquo;s  schemes, if not himself.</p>
  <p>For  an instant the thwarted detective listened for the angry shout or the smothered  oath which would naturally follow the discovery by Brotherson of this attempted  interference with his privacy.</p>
  <p>But  all was still on his side of the wall. A rustling of leaves could be heard, as  the inventor searched for the poem he wanted, but nothing more. In withdrawing  the book, he had failed to notice the hole in the plaster back of it. But he  could hardly fail to see it when he came to put the book back. Meantime,  suspense for Sweetwater.</p>
  <p>It  was several minutes before he heard Mr. Brotherson&rsquo;s voice again, then it was  in triumphant repetition of the lines which had escaped his memory. They were  great words surely and Sweetwater never forgot them, but the impression which  they made upon his mind, an impression so forcible that he was able to repeat  them, months afterward to Mr. Gryce, did not prevent him from noting the tone  in which they were uttered, nor the thud which followed as the book was thrown  down upon the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo;  The word rang out in bitter irony from his irate neighbour&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;What does  he know of woman! Woman! Let him court a rich one and see&mdash;but that&rsquo;s all over  and done with. No more harping on that string, and no more reading of poetry.  I&rsquo;ll never,&mdash;&rdquo; The rest was lost in his throat and was quite unintelligible to  the anxious listener.</p>
  <p>Self-revealing  words, which an instant before would have aroused Sweetwater&rsquo;s deepest  interest! But they had suddenly lost all force for the unhappy listener. The  sight of that hole still shining brightly before his eyes had distracted his  thoughts and roused his liveliest apprehensions. If that book should be allowed  to lie where it had fallen, then he was in for a period of uncertainty he  shrank from contemplating. Any moment his neighbour might look up and catch  sight of this hole bored in the backing of the shelves before him. Could the  man who had been guilty of submitting him to this outrage stand the strain of  waiting indefinitely for the moment of discovery? He doubted it, if the  suspense lasted too long.</p>
  <p>Shifting  his position, he placed his eye where his ear had been. He could see very  little. The space before him, limited as it was to the width of the one volume  withdrawn, precluded his seeing aught but what lay directly before him.  Happily, it was in this narrow line of vision that Mr. Brotherson stood. He had  resumed work upon his model and was so placed that while his face was not  visible, his hands were, and as Sweetwater watched these hands and noticed the  delicacy of their manipulation, he was enough of a workman to realise that work  so fine called for an undivided attention. He need not fear the gaze shifting,  while those hands moved as warily as they did now.</p>
  <p>Relieved  for the moment, he left his post and, sitting down on the edge of his cot, gave  himself up to thought.</p>
  <p>He  deserved this mischance. Had he profited properly by Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s teachings, he  would not have been caught like this; he would have calculated not upon the  nine hundred and ninety-nine chances of that book being left alone, but upon  the thousandth one of its being the very one to be singled out and removed. Had  he done this,&mdash;had he taken pains to so roughen and discolour the opening he had  made, that it would look like an ancient rat hole instead of showing a clean  bore, he would have some answer to give Brotherson when he came to question him  in regard to it. But now the whole thing seemed up! He had shown himself a fool  and by good rights ought to acknowledge his defeat and return to Headquarters.  But he had too much spirit for that. He would rather&mdash;yes, he would rather face  the pistol he had once seen in his enemy&rsquo;s hand. Yet it was hard to sit here  waiting, waiting&mdash;Suddenly he started upright. He would go meet his fate&mdash;be  present in the room itself when the discovery was made which threatened to  upset all his plans. He was not ashamed of his calling, and Brotherson would  think twice before attacking him when once convinced that he had the Department  behind him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse  me, comrade,&rdquo; were the words with which he endeavoured to account for his  presence at Brotherson&rsquo;s door. &ldquo;My lamp smells so, and I&rsquo;ve made such a mess of  my work to-day that I&rsquo;ve just stepped in for a chat. If I&rsquo;m not wanted, say so.  I don&rsquo;t want to bother you, but you do look pleasant here. I hope the thing I&rsquo;m  turning over in my head&mdash;every man has his schemes for making a fortune, you  know&mdash;will be a success some day. I&rsquo;d like a big room like this, and a lot of  books, and&mdash;and pictures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Craning  his neck, he took a peep at the shelves, with an air of open admiration which  effectually concealed his real purpose. What he wanted was to catch one glimpse  of that empty space from his present standpoint, and he was both astonished and  relieved to note how narrow and inconspicuous it looked. Certainly, he had less  to fear than he supposed, and when, upon Mr. Brotherson&rsquo;s invitation, he stepped  into the room, it was with a dash of his former audacity, which gave him,  unfortunately, perhaps, a quick, strong and unexpected likeness to his old  self.</p>
  <p>But  if Brotherson noticed this, nothing in his manner gave proof of the fact.  Though usually averse to visitors, especially when employed as at present on  his precious model, he quite warmed towards his unexpected guest, and even led  the way to where it stood uncovered on the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  find me at work,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose you understand any but your  own?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you mean to ask if I understand what you&rsquo;re trying to do there, I&rsquo;m free to say  that I don&rsquo;t. I couldn&rsquo;t tell now, off-hand, whether it&rsquo;s an air-ship you&rsquo;re  planning, a hydraulic machine or&mdash;or&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, with a laugh and turned towards  the book-shelves. &ldquo;Now here&rsquo;s what I like. These books just take my eye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  at them, then. I like to see a man interested in books. Only, I thought if you  knew how to handle wire, I would get you to hold this end while I work with the  other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess I know enough for that,&rdquo; was Sweetwater&rsquo;s gay rejoinder. But when he felt  that communicating wire in his hand and experienced for the first time the full  influence of the other&rsquo;s eye, it took all his hardihood to hide the hypnotic  thrill it gave him. Though he smiled and chatted, he could not help asking  himself between whiles, what had killed the poor washerwoman across the court,  and what had killed Miss Challoner. Something visible or something invisible?  Something which gave warning of attack, or something which struck in silence.  He found himself gazing long and earnestly at this man&rsquo;s hand, and wondering if  death lay under it. It was a strong hand, a deft, clean-cut member, formed to  respond to the slightest hint from the powerful brain controlling it. But was  this its whole story. Had he said all when he had said this?</p>
  <p>Fascinated  by the question, Sweetwater died a hundred deaths in his awakened fancy, as he  followed the sharp short instructions which fell with cool precision from the  other&rsquo;s lips. A hundred deaths, I say, but with no betrayal of his folly. The  anxiety he showed was that of one eager to please, which may explain why on the  conclusion of his task, Mr. Brotherson gave him one of his infrequent smiles  and remarked, as he buried the model under its cover, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re handy and you&rsquo;re  quiet at your job. Who knows but that I shall want you again. Will you come if  I call you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t  I?&rdquo; was the gay retort, as the detective thus released, stooped for the book  still lying on the floor. &ldquo;Paolo and Francesca,&rdquo; he read, from the back, as he  laid it on the table. &ldquo;Poetry?&rdquo; he queried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rot,&rdquo;  scornfully returned the other, as he moved to take down a bottle and some  glasses from a cupboard let into another portion of the wall.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  taking advantage of the moment, sidled towards the shelf where that empty space  still gaped with the tell-tale hole at the back. He could easily have replaced  the missing book before Mr. Brotherson turned. But the issue was too doubtful.  He was dealing with no absent-minded fool, and it behooved him to avoid above  all things calling attention to the book or to the place on the shelf where it  belonged.</p>
  <p>But  there was one thing he could do and did. Reaching out a finger as deft as  Brotherson&rsquo;s own, he pushed a second volume into the place of the one that was  gone. This veiled the auger-hole completely; a fact which so entirely relieved  his mind that his old smile came back like sunshine to his lips, and it was  only by a distinct effort that he kept the dancing humour from his eyes as he  prepared to refuse the glass which Brotherson now brought forward:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  of that!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t tempt me. The doctor has shut down on all kinds  of spirits for two months more, at least. But don&rsquo;t let me hinder you. I can  bear to smell the stuff. My turn will come again some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Brotherson did not drink. Setting down the glass he carried, he took up the  book lying near, weighed it in his hand and laid it down again, with an air of  thoughtful inquiry. Then he suddenly pushed it towards Sweetwater. &ldquo;Do you want  it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  was too taken aback to answer immediately. This was a move he did not  understand. Want it, he? What he wanted was to see it put back in its place on  the shelf. Did Brotherson suspect this? The supposition was incredible; yet who  could read a mind so mysterious?</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  debating the subject, decided that the risk of adding to any such possible  suspicion was less to be dreaded than the continued threat offered by that  unoccupied space so near the hole which testified so unmistakably of the means  he had taken to spy upon this suspected man&rsquo;s privacy. So, after a moment of  awkward silence, not out of keeping with the character he had assumed, he  calmly refused the present as he had the glass.</p>
  <p>Unhappily  he was not rewarded by seeing the despised volume restored to its shelf. It  still lay where its owner had pushed it, when, with some awkwardly muttered  thanks, the discomfited detective withdrew to his own room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_18"></a><b>Chapter 18<br>
    What Am I To Do Now</b></h2>
  <p>Early  morning saw Sweetwater peering into the depths of his closet. The hole was  hardly visible. This meant that the book he had pushed across it from the other  side had not been removed.</p>
  <p>Greatly  re-assured by the sight, he awaited his opportunity, and as soon as a suitable  one presented itself, prepared the hole for inspection by breaking away its  edges and begriming it well with plaster and old dirt. This done, he left  matters to arrange themselves; which they did, after this manner.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Brotherson suddenly developed a great need of him, and it became a common thing  for him to spend the half and, sometimes, the whole of the evening in the  neighbouring room. This was just what he had worked for, and his constant  intercourse with the man whose secret he sought to surprise should have borne  fruit. But it did not. Nothing in the eager but painstaking inventor showed a  distracted mind or a heavily-burdened soul. Indeed, he was so calm in all his  ways, so precise and so self-contained, that Sweetwater often wondered what had  become of the fiery agitator and eloquent propagandist of new and startling  doctrines.</p>
  <p>Then,  he thought he understood the riddle. The model was reaching its completion, and  Brotherson&rsquo;s extreme interest in it and the confidence he had in its success  swallowed up all lesser emotions. Were the invention to prove a failure&mdash;but  there was small hope of this. The man was of too well-poised a mind to  over-estimate his work or miscalculate its place among modern improvements.  Soon he would reach the goal of his desires, be praised, feted, made much of by  the very people he now professedly scorned. There was no thoroughfare for  Sweetwater here. Another road must be found; some secret, strange and  unforeseen method of reaching a soul inaccessible to all ordinary or even  extraordinary impressions.</p>
  <p>Would  a night of thought reveal such a method? Night! the very word brought  inspiration. A man is not his full self at night. Secrets which, under the  ordinary circumstances of everyday life, lie too deep for surprise, creep from  their hiding-places in the dismal hours of universal quiet, and lips which are  dumb to the most subtle of questioners break into strange and self-revealing  mutterings when sleep lies heavy on ear and eye and the forces of life and  death are released to play with the rudderless spirit.</p>
  <p>It  was in different words from these that Sweetwater reasoned, no doubt, but his  conclusions were the same, and as he continued to brood over them, he saw a  chance&mdash;a fool&rsquo;s chance, possibly, (but fools sometimes win where wise men fail)  of reaching those depths he still believed in, notwithstanding his failure to  sound them.</p>
  <p>Addressing  a letter to his friend in Twenty-ninth Street, he awaited reply in the shape of  a small package he had ordered sent to the corner drug-store. When it came, he  carried it home in a state of mingled hope and misgiving. Was he about to cap  his fortnight of disappointment by another signal failure; end the matter by  disclosing his hand; lose all, or win all by an experiment as daring and possibly  as fanciful as were his continued suspicions of this seemingly upright and  undoubtedly busy man?</p>
  <p>He  made no attempt to argue the question. The event called for the exercise of the  most dogged elements in his character and upon these he must rely. He would  make the effort he contemplated, simply because he was minded to do so. That  was all there was to it. But any one noting him well that night, would have  seen that he ate little and consulted his watch continually. Sweetwater had not  yet passed the line where work becomes routine and the feelings remain totally  under control.</p>
  <p>Brotherson  was unusually active and alert that evening. He was anxious to fit one delicate  bit of mechanism into another, and he was continually interrupted by visitors.  Some big event was on in the socialistic world, and his presence was eagerly  demanded by one brotherhood after another. Sweetwater, posted at his loop-hole,  heard the arguments advanced by each separate spokesman, followed by  Brotherson&rsquo;s unvarying reply: that when his work was done and he had proved his  right to approach them with a message, they might look to hear from him again;  but not before. His patience was inexhaustible, but he showed himself relieved  when the hour grew too late for further interruption. He began to whistle&mdash;a  token that all was going well with him, and Sweetwater, who had come to  understand some of his moods, looked forward to an hour or two of continuous  work on Brotherson&rsquo;s part and of dreary and impatient waiting on his own. But,  as so many times before, he misread the man. Earlier than common&mdash;much earlier,  in fact, Mr. Brotherson laid down his tools and gave himself up to a restless  pacing of the floor. This was not usual with him. Nor did he often indulge  himself in playing on the piano as he did to-night, beginning with a few  heavenly strains and ending with a bang that made the key-board jump. Certainly  something was amiss in the quarter where peace had hitherto reigned  undisturbed. Had the depths begun to heave, or were physical causes alone  responsible for these unwonted ebullitions of feeling?</p>
  <p>The  question was immaterial. Either would form an excellent preparation for the  coup planned by Sweetwater; and when, after another hour of uncertainty,  perfect silence greeted him from his neighbour&rsquo;s room, hope had soared again on  exultant wing, far above all former discouragements.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Brotherson&rsquo;s bed was in a remote corner from the loop-hole made by Sweetwater;  but in the stillness now pervading the whole building, the latter could hear  his even breathing very distinctly. He was in a deep sleep.</p>
  <p>The  young detective&rsquo;s moment had come.</p>
  <p>Taking  from his breast a small box, he placed it on a shelf close against the  partition. An instant of quiet listening, then he touched a spring in the side  of the box and laid his ear, in haste, to his loop-hole.</p>
  <p>A  strain of well-known music broke softly, from the box and sent its vibrations  through the wall.</p>
  <p>It  was answered instantly by a stir within; then, as the noble air continued,  awakening memories of that fatal instant when it crashed through the corridors  of the Hotel Clermont, drowning Miss Challoner&rsquo;s cry if not the sound of her  fall, a word burst from the sleeping man&rsquo;s lips which carried its own message  to the listening detective.</p>
  <p>It  was Edith! Miss Challoner&rsquo;s first name, and the tone bespoke a shaken soul.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  gasping with excitement, caught the box from the shelf and silenced it. It had  done its work and it was no part of Sweetwater&rsquo;s plan to have this strain  located, or even to be thought real. But its echo still lingered in  Brotherson&rsquo;s otherwise unconscious ears; for another &ldquo;Edith!&rdquo; escaped his lips,  followed by a smothered but forceful utterance of these five words, &ldquo;You know I  promised you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Promised  her what? He did not say. Would he have done so had the music lasted a trifle  longer? Would he yet complete his sentence? Sweetwater trembled with eagerness  and listened breathlessly for the next sound. Brotherson was awake. He was  tossing in his bed. Now he has leaped to the floor. Sweetwater hears him groan,  then comes another silence, broken at last by the sound of his body falling  back upon the bed and the troubled ejaculation of &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; wrung from lips  no torture could have forced into complaint under any daytime conditions.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  continued to listen, but he had heard all, and after some few minutes longer of  fruitless waiting, he withdrew from his post. The episode was over. He would  hear no more that night.</p>
  <p>Was  he satisfied? Certainly the event, puerile as it might seem to some, had opened  up strange vistas to his aroused imagination. The words &ldquo;Edith, you know I  promised you&mdash;&rdquo; were in themselves provocative of strange and doubtful  conjectures. Had the sleeper under the influence of a strain of music  indissolubly associated with the death of Miss Challoner, been so completely  forced back into the circumstances and environment of that moment that his mind  had taken up and his lips repeated the thoughts with which that moment of  horror was charged? Sweetwater imagined the scene&mdash;saw the figure of Brotherson  hesitating at the top of the stairs&mdash;saw hers advancing from the writing-room,  with startled and uplifted hand&mdash;heard the music&mdash;the crash of that great  finale&mdash;and decided, without hesitation, that the words he had just heard were  indeed the thoughts of that moment. &ldquo;Edith, you know I promised you&mdash;&rdquo; What had  he promised? What she received was death! Had this been in his mind? Would this  have been the termination of the sentence had he wakened less soon to  consciousness and caution?</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  dared to believe it. He was no nearer comprehending the mystery it involved  than he had been before, but he felt sure that he had been given one true and  positive glimpse into this harassed soul which showed its deeply hidden secret  to be both deadly and fearsome; and happy to have won his way so far into the  mystic labyrinth he had sworn to pierce, he rested in happy unconsciousness  till morning when&mdash;</p>
  <p>Could  it be? Was it he who was dreaming now, or was the event of the night a mere  farce of his own imagining? Mr. Brotherson was whistling in his room, gaily and  with ever increasing verve, and the tune which filled the whole floor with  music was the same grand finale from William Tell which had seemed to work such  magic in the night. As Sweetwater caught the mellow but indifferent notes  sounding from those lips of brass, he dragged forth the music-box he held  hidden in his coat pocket, and flinging it on the floor stamped upon it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man is too strong for me,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;His heart is granite; he meets my every  move. What am I to do now?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_19"></a><b>Chapter 19<br>
    The Danger Moment</b></h2>
  <p>For  a day Sweetwater acknowledged himself to be mentally crushed, disillusioned and  defeated. Then his spirits regained their poise. It would take a heavy weight  indeed to keep them down permanently.</p>
  <p>His  opinion was not changed in regard to his neighbour&rsquo;s secret guilt. A demeanour  of this sort suggested bravado rather than bravery to the ever suspicious  detective. But he saw, very plainly by this time, that he would have to employ  more subtle methods yet ere his hand would touch the goal which so  tantalisingly eluded him.</p>
  <p>His  work at the bench suffered that week; he made two mistakes. But by Saturday  night he had satisfied himself that he had reached the point where he would be  justified in making use of Miss Challoner&rsquo;s letters. So he telephoned his  wishes to New York, and awaited the promised developments with an anxiety we  can only understand by realising how much greater were his chances of failure  than of success. To ensure the latter, every factor in his scheme must work to  perfection. The medium of communication (a young, untried girl) must do her  part with all the skill of artist and author combined. Would she disappoint  them? He did not think so. Women possess a marvellous adaptability for this  kind of work and this one was French, which made the case still more hopeful.</p>
  <p>But  Brotherson! In what spirit would he meet the proposed advances? Would he even  admit the girl, and, if he did, would the interview bear any such fruit as  Sweetwater hoped for? The man who could mock the terrors of the night by a  careless repetition of a strain instinct with the most sacred memories, was not  to be depended upon to show much feeling at sight of a departed woman&rsquo;s  writing. But no other hope remained, and Sweetwater faced the attempt with  heroic determination.</p>
  <p>The  day was Sunday, which ensured Brotherson&rsquo;s being at home. Nothing would have  lured Sweetwater out for a moment, though he had no reason to expect that the  affair he was anticipating would come off till early evening.</p>
  <p>But  it did. Late in the afternoon he heard the expected steps go by his door&mdash;a  woman&rsquo;s steps. But they were not alone. A man&rsquo;s accompanied them. What man?  Sweetwater hastened to satisfy himself on this point by laying his ear to the  partition.</p>
  <p>Instantly  the whole conversation became audible. &ldquo;An errand? Oh, yes, I have an errand!&rdquo;  explained the evidently unwelcome intruder, in her broken English. &ldquo;This is my  brother Pierre. My name is Celeste; Celeste Ledru. I understand English ver  well. I have worked much in families. But he understands nothing. He is all  French. He accompanies me for&mdash;for the&mdash;what you call it? <i>les convenances</i>. He  knows nothing of the beesiness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  in the darkness of his closet laughed in his gleeful appreciation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo;  was his comment. &ldquo;Just great! She has thought of everything&mdash;or Mr. Gryce has.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  the girl was proceeding with increased volubility.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is this beesiness, monsieur? I have something to sell&mdash;so you Americans speak.  Something you will want much&mdash;ver sacred, ver precious. A souvenir from the  tomb, monsieur. Will you give ten&mdash;no, that is too leetle&mdash;fifteen dollars for  it? It is worth&mdash;Oh, more, much more to the true lover. <i>Pierre, tu es bete.  Teins-tu droit sur ta chaise. M. Brotherson est un monsieur comme il faut</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  adjuration, uttered in sharp reprimand and with but little of the French grace,  may or may not have been understood by the unsympathetic man they were meant to  impress. But the name which accompanied them&mdash;his own name, never heard but once  before in this house, undoubtedly caused the silence which almost reached the  point of embarrassment, before he broke it with the harsh remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  French may be good, but it does not go with me. Yet is it more intelligible  than your English. What do you want here? What have you in that bag you wish to  open; and what do you mean by the sentimental trash with which you offer it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  monsieur has not memory of me,&rdquo; came in the sweetest tones of a really  seductive voice. &ldquo;You astonish me, monsieur. I thought you knew&mdash;everybody else  does&mdash;Oh, <i>tout le monde</i>, monsieur, that I was Miss Challoner&rsquo;s maid&mdash;near her  when other people were not&mdash;near her the very day she died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  pause; then an angry exclamation from some one. Sweetwater thought from the  brother, who may have misinterpreted some look or gesture on Brotherson&rsquo;s part.  Brotherson himself would not be apt to show surprise in any such noisy way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  saw many things&mdash;Oh many things&mdash;&rdquo; the girl proceeded with an admirable mixture  of suggestion and reserve. &ldquo;That day and other days too. She did not talk&mdash;Oh,  no, she did not talk, but I saw&mdash;Oh, yes, I saw that she&mdash;that you&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have to  say it, monsieur, that you were <i>tr&egrave;s bons amis</i> after that week in Lenox.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  His utterance of this word was vigorous, but not tender. &ldquo;What are you coming  to? What can you have to show me in this connection that I will believe in for  a moment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have these&mdash;is monsieur certaine that no one can hear? I wouldn&rsquo;t have anybody  hear what I have to tell you, for the world&mdash;for all the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one can overhear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  the first time that day Sweetwater breathed a full, deep breath. This assurance  had sounded heartfelt. &ldquo;Blessings on her cunning young head. She thinks of  everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are unhappy. You have thought Miss Challoner cold;&mdash;that she had no response for  your ver ardent passion. But&mdash;&rdquo; these words were uttered <i>sotto voce</i> and with  telling pauses &ldquo;&mdash;but&mdash;I&mdash;know&mdash;ver much better than that. She was ver proud. She  had a right; she was no poor girl like me&mdash;but she spend hours&mdash;<i>hours</i> in writing  letters she&mdash;nevaire send. I saw one, just once, for a leetle minute; while you  could breathe so short as that; and began with Cheri, or your English for that,  and ended with words&mdash;Oh, ver much like these: <i>You may nevaire see these lines</i>,  which was ver interesting, veree so, and made one want to see what she did with  letters she wrote and nevaire mail; so I watch and look, and one day I see  them. She had a leetle ivory box&mdash;Oh, ver nice, ver pretty. I thought it was  jewels she kept locked up so tight. But, non, non, non. It was letters&mdash;these  letters. I heard them rattle, rattle, not once but many times. You believe me,  monsieur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe you to have taken every advantage possible to spy upon your mistress. I  believe that, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  interest, monsieur, from great interest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Self-interest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  monsieur pleases. But it was strange, ver strange for a grande dame like that  to write letters&mdash;sheets on sheets&mdash;and then not send them, <i>nevaire</i>. I dreamed of  those letters&mdash;I could not help it, no; and when she died so quick&mdash;with no word  for any one, no word at all, I thought of those writings so secret, so of the  heart, and when no one noticed&mdash;or thought about this box, or&mdash;or the key she  kept shut tight, oh, always tight in her leetle gold purse, I&mdash;Monsieur, do you  want to see those letters?&rdquo; asked the girl, with a gulp. Evidently his  appearance frightened her&mdash;or had her acting reached this point of extreme  finish? &ldquo;I had nevaire the chance to put them back. And&mdash;and they belong to  monsieur. They are his&mdash;all his&mdash;and <i>so</i> beautiful! Ah, just like poetry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t consider them mine. I haven&rsquo;t a particle of confidence in you or in your  story. You are a thief&mdash;self-convicted; or you&rsquo;re an agent of the police whose  motives I neither understand nor care to investigate. Take up your bag and go.  I haven&rsquo;t a cent&rsquo;s worth of interest in its contents.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  started to her feet. Sweetwater heard her chair grate on the painted floor, as  she pushed it back in rising. The brother rose too, but more calmly. Brotherson  did not stir. Sweetwater felt his hopes rapidly dying down&mdash;down into ashes,  when suddenly her voice broke forth in pants:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Marie said&mdash;everybody said&mdash;that you loved our great lady; that you, of the  people, common, common, working with the hands, living with men and women  working with the hands, that you had soul, sentiment&mdash;what you will of the good  and the great, and that you would give your eyes for her words, <i>si fines, si  spirituelles, so like des vers de po&egrave;te</i>. False! false! all false! She was an angel.  You are&mdash;read that!&rdquo; she vehemently broke in, opening her bag and whisking a  paper down before him. &ldquo;Read and understand my proud and lovely lady. She did  right to die. You are hard&mdash;hard. You would have killed her if she had not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence,  woman! I will read nothing!&rdquo; came hissing from the strong man&rsquo;s teeth, set in  almost ungovernable anger. &ldquo;Take back this letter, as you call it, and leave my  room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nevaire!  You will not read? But you shall, you shall. Behold another! One, two, three,  four!&rdquo; Madly they flew from her hand. Madly she continued her vituperative  attack. &ldquo;Beast! beast! That she should pour out her innocent heart to you, you!  I do not want your money, Monsieur of the common street, of the common house.  It would be dirt. Pierre, it would be dirt. Ah, bah! <i>je m&rsquo;oublie tout &agrave; fait.  Pierre, il est bete. Il refuse de les toucher. Mais il faut qu&rsquo;il les touche,  si je les laisse sur le plancher. Va-t&rsquo;en! Je me moque de lui. Canaille!  L&rsquo;homme du peuple, tout &agrave; fait du peuple!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  loud slam&mdash;the skurrying of feet through the hall, accompanied by the slower and  heavier tread of the so-called brother, then silence, and such silence that  Sweetwater fancied he could catch the sound of Brotherson&rsquo;s heavy breathing.  His own was silenced to a gasp. What a treasure of a girl! How natural her  indignation! What an instinct she showed and what comprehension! This high and  mighty handling of a most difficult situation and a most difficult man, had  imposed on Brotherson, had almost imposed upon himself. Those letters <i>so</i>  beautiful, so <i>spirituelle!</i> Yet, the odds were that she had never read them,  much less abstracted them. The minx! the ready, resourceful, wily, daring minx!</p>
  <p>But  <i>had</i> she imposed on Brotherson? As the silence continued, Sweetwater began to  doubt. He understood quite well the importance of his neighbour&rsquo;s first  movement. Were he to tear those letters into shreds! He might be thus tempted.  All depended on the strength of his present mood and the real nature of the  secret which lay buried in his heart.</p>
  <p>Was  that heart as flinty as it seemed? Was there no place for doubt or even for  curiosity, in its impenetrable depths? Seemingly, he had not moved foot or hand  since his unwelcome visitors had left. He was doubtless still staring at the  scattered sheets lying before him; possibly battling with unaccustomed  impulses; possibly weighing deeds and consequences in those slow moving scales  of his in which no man could cast a weight with any certainty how far its even  balance would be disturbed.</p>
  <p>There  was a sound as of settling coal. Only at night would one expect to hear so  slight a sound as that in a tenement full of noisy children. But the moment  chanced to be propitious, and it not only attracted the attention of Sweetwater  on his side of the wall, but it struck the ear of Brotherson also. With an  ejaculation as bitter as it was impatient, he roused himself and gathered up  the letters. Sweetwater could hear the successive rustlings as he bundled them  up in his hand. Then came another silence&mdash;then the lifting of a stove lid.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  had not been wrong in his secret apprehension. His identification with his  unimpressionable neighbour&rsquo;s mood had shown him what to expect. These  letters&mdash;these innocent and precious outpourings of a rare and womanly soul&mdash;the  only conceivable <i>open sesame</i> to the hard-locked nature he found himself pitted  against, would soon be resolved into a vanishing puff of smoke.</p>
  <p>But  the lid was thrust back, and the letters remained in hand. Mortal strength has  its limits. Even Brotherson could not shut down that lid on words which might  have been meant for him, harshly as he had repelled the idea.</p>
  <p>The  pause which followed told little; but when Sweetwater heard the man within move  with characteristic energy to the door, turn the key and step back again to his  place at the table, he knew that the danger moment had passed and that those  letters were about to be read, not casually, but seriously, as indeed their  contents merited.</p>
  <p>This  caused Sweetwater to feel serious himself. Upon what result might he calculate?  What would happen to this hardy soul, when the fact he so scornfully  repudiated, was borne in upon him, and he saw that the disdain which had  antagonised him was a mere device&mdash;a cloak to hide the secret heart of love and  eager womanly devotion? Her death&mdash;little as Brotherson would believe it up till  now&mdash;had been his personal loss the greatest which can befall a man. When he  came to see this&mdash;when the modest fervour of her unusual nature began to dawn  upon him in these self-revelations, would the result be remorse, or just the  deadening and final extinction of whatever tenderness he may have retained for  her memory?</p>
  <p>Impossible  to tell. The balance of probability hung even. Sweetwater recognised this, and  clung, breathless, to his loop-hole. Fain would he have seen, as well as heard.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Brotherson read the first letter, standing. As it soon became public property,  I will give it here, just as it afterwards appeared in the columns of the  greedy journals:</p>
  <p class="note"><i>&ldquo;Beloved:</i></p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;When I sit, as I often do, in perfect quiet under the  stars, and dream that you are looking at them too, not for hours as I do, but  for one full moment in which your thoughts are with me as wholly as mine are  with you, I feel that the bond between us, unseen by the world, and possibly  not wholly recognised by ourselves, is instinct with the same power which links  together the eternities.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;It seems to have always been; to have known no  beginning, only a budding, an efflorescence, the visible product of a hidden  but always present reality. A month ago and I was ignorant, even, of your name.  Now, you seem the best known to me, the best understood, of God&rsquo;s creatures. One  afternoon of perfect companionship&mdash;one flash of strong emotion, with its deep,  true insight into each other&rsquo;s soul, and the miracle was wrought. We had met,  and henceforth, parting would mean separation only, and not the severing of a  mutual bond. One hand, and one only, could do that now. I will not name that  hand. For us there is nought ahead but life.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Thus do I ease my heart in the silence which  conditions impose upon us. Some day I shall hear your voice again, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  paper dropped from the reader&rsquo;s hand. It was several minutes before he took up  another.</p>
  <p>This  one, as it happened, antedated the other, as will appear on reading it:</p>
  <p class="note"><i>&ldquo;My friend:</i></p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I said that I could not write to you&mdash;that we must  wait. You were willing; but there is much to be accomplished, and the silence  may be long. My father is not an easy man to please, but he desires my  happiness and will listen to my plea when the right hour comes. When you have  won your place&mdash;when you have shown yourself to be the man I feel you to be,  then my father will recognise your worth, and the way will be cleared, despite  the obstacles which now intervene.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;But meantime! Ah, you will not know it, but words  will rise &mdash;the heart must find utterance. What the lip cannot utter, nor the  looks reveal, these pages shall hold in sacred trust for you till the day when  my father will place my hand in yours, with heart-felt approval.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Is it a folly? A woman&rsquo;s weak evasion of the strong  silence of man? You may say so some day; but somehow, I doubt it&mdash;I doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  creaking of a chair;&mdash;the man within had seated himself. There was no other  sound; a soul in turmoil wakens no echoes. Sweetwater envied the walls  surrounding the unsympathetic reader. They could see. He could only listen.</p>
  <p>A  little while; then that slight rustling again of the unfolding sheet. The  following was read, and then the fourth and last:</p>
  <p class="note"><i>&ldquo;Dearest:</i></p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Did you think I had never seen you till that day we  met in Lenox? I am going to tell you a secret&mdash;a great, great secret&mdash;such a one  as a woman hardly whispers to her own heart. </p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;One day, in early summer, I was sitting in St.  Bartholomew&rsquo;s Church on Fifth Avenue, waiting for the services to begin. It was  early and the congregation was assembling. While idly watching the people  coming in, I saw a gentleman pass by me up the aisle, who made me forget all  the others. He had not the air of a New Yorker; he was not even dressed in city  style, but as I noted his face and expression, I said way down in my heart, &lsquo;That  is the kind of man I could love; the only man I have ever seen who could make  me forget my own world and my own people.&rsquo; It was a passing thought, soon  forgotten. But when in that hour of embarrassment and peril on Greylock  Mountain, I looked up into the face of my rescuer and saw again that  countenance which so short a time before had called into life impulses till  then utterly unknown, I knew that my hour was come. And that was why my  confidence was so spontaneous and my belief in the future so absolute.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I trust your love which will work wonders; and I  trust my own, which sprang at a look but only gathered strength and permanence when  I found that the soul of the man I loved bettered his outward attractions,  making the ideal of my foolish girlhood seem as unsubstantial and evanescent as  a dream in the glowing noontide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note"><i>&ldquo;My Own:</i></p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I can say so now; for you have written to me, and I  have the dancing words with which to silence any unsought doubt which might subdue  the exuberance of these secret outpourings.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I did not expect this. I thought that you would  remain as silent as myself. But men&rsquo;s ways are not our ways. They cannot  exhaust longing in purposeless words on scraps of soulless paper, and I am glad  that they cannot. I love you for your impatience; for your purpose, and for the  manliness which will win for you yet all that you covet of fame, accomplishment  and love. You expect no reply, but there are ways in which one can keep silent  and yet speak. Won&rsquo;t you be surprised when your answer comes in a manner you  have never thought of?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
    Confusion</b></h2>
  <p>In  his interest in what was going on on the other side of the wall, Sweetwater had  forgotten himself. Daylight had declined, but in the darkness of the closet  this change had passed unheeded. Night itself might come, but that should not  force him to leave his post so long as his neighbour remained behind his locked  door, brooding over the words of love and devotion which had come to him, as it  were from the other world.</p>
  <p>But  was he brooding? That sound of iron clattering upon iron! That smothered  exclamation and the laugh which ended it! Anger and determination rang in that  laugh. It had a hideous sound which prepared Sweetwater for the smell which now  reached his nostrils. The letters were burning; this time the lid had been  lifted from the stove with unrelenting purpose. Poor Edith Challoner&rsquo;s touching  words had met a different fate from any which she, in her ignorance of this  man&rsquo;s nature,&mdash;a nature to which she had ascribed untold perfections&mdash;could  possibly have conceived.</p>
  <p>As  Sweetwater thought of this, he stirred nervously in the darkness, and broke  into silent invective against the man who could so insult the memory of one who  had perished under the blight of his own coldness and misunderstanding. Then he  suddenly started back surprised and apprehensive. Brotherson had unlocked his  door, and was coming rapidly his way. Sweetwater heard his step in the hall and  had hardly time to bound from his closet, when he saw his own door burst in and  found himself face to face with his redoubtable neighbour, in a state of such  rage as few men could meet without quailing, even were they of his own stature,  physical vigour and prowess; and Sweetwater was a small man.</p>
  <p>However,  disappointment such as he had just experienced brings with it a desperation  which often outdoes courage, and the detective, smiling with an air of gay  surprise, shouted out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what&rsquo;s the matter now? Has the machine busted, or tumbled into the fire or  sailed away to lands unknown out of your open window?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were coming out of that closet,&rdquo; was the fierce rejoinder. &ldquo;What have you got  there? Something which concerns me, or why should your face go pale at my  presence and your forehead drip with sweat? Don&rsquo;t think that you&rsquo;ve deceived me  for a moment as to your business here. I recognised you immediately. You&rsquo;ve  played the stranger well, but you&rsquo;ve a nose and an eye nobody could forget. I  have known all along that I had a police spy for a neighbour; but it didn&rsquo;t  faze me. I&rsquo;ve nothing to conceal, and wouldn&rsquo;t mind a regiment of you fellows  if you&rsquo;d only play a straight game. But when it comes to foisting upon me a  parcel of letters to which I have no right, and then setting a fellow like you  to count my groans or whatever else they expected to hear, I have a right to  defend myself, and defend myself I will, by God! But first, let me be sure that  my accusations will stand. Come into this closet with me. It abuts on the wall of  my room and has its own secret, I know. What is it? I have you at an advantage  now, and you shall tell.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did have Sweetwater at an advantage, and the detective knew it and disdained a  struggle which would have only called up a crowd, friendly to the other but  inimical to himself. Allowing Brotherson to drag him into the closet, he stood  quiescent, while the determined man who held him with one hand, felt about with  the other over the shelves and along the partitions till he came to the hole  which had offered such a happy means of communication between the two rooms.  Then, with a laugh almost as bitter in tone as that which rang from  Brotherson&rsquo;s lips, he acknowledged that business had its necessities and that  apologies from him were in order; adding, as they both stepped out into the  rapidly darkening room:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve  played a bout, we two; and you&rsquo;ve come out ahead. Allow me to congratulate you,  Mr. Brotherson. You&rsquo;ve cleared yourself so far as I am concerned. I leave this  ranch to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  frown had come back to the forehead of the indignant man who confronted him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you listened,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;listened when you weren&rsquo;t sneaking under my eye! A  fine occupation for a man who can dove-tail a corner like an adept. I wish I  had let you join the brotherhood you were good enough to mention. They would  know how to appreciate your double gifts and how to reward your excellence in  the one, if not in the other. What did the police expect to learn about me that  they should consider it necessary to call into exercise such extraordinary  talents?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not good at conundrums. I was given a task to perform, and I performed it,&rdquo; was  Sweetwater&rsquo;s sturdy reply. Then slowly, with his eye fixed directly upon his  antagonist, &ldquo;I guess they thought you a man. And so did I until I heard you  burn those letters. Fortunately we have copies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Letters!&rdquo;  Fury thickened the speaker&rsquo;s voice, and lent a savage gleam to his eye.  &ldquo;Forgeries! Make believes! Miss Challoner never wrote the drivel you dare to  designate as letters. It was concocted at Police Headquarters. They made me  tell my story and then they found some one who could wield the poetic pen. I&rsquo;m  obliged to them for the confidence they show in my credulity. I credit Miss  Challoner with such words as have been given me to read here to-day? I knew the  lady, and I know myself. Nothing that passed between us, not an event in which  we were both concerned, has been forgotten by me, and no feature of our  intercourse fits the language you have ascribed to her. On the contrary, there  is a lamentable contradiction between facts as they were and the fancies you  have made her indulge in. And this, as you must acknowledge, not only proves  their falsity, but exonerates Miss Challoner from all possible charge of  sentimentality.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  she certainly wrote those letters. We had them from Mr. Challoner. The woman  who brought them was really her maid. We have not deceived you in this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not believe you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was not offensively said; but the conviction it expressed was absolute.  Sweetwater recognised the tone, as one of truth, and inwardly laid down his  arms. He could never like the man; there was too much iron in his fibre; but he  had to acknowledge that as a foe he was invulnerable and therefore admirable to  one who had the good sense to appreciate him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not want to believe you.&rdquo; Thus did Brotherson supplement his former  sentence. &ldquo;For if I were to attribute those letters to her, I should have to  acknowledge that they were written to another man than myself. And this would  be anything but agreeable to me. Now I am going to my room and to my work. You  may spend the rest of the evening or the whole night, if you will, listening at  that hole. As heretofore, the labour will be all yours, and the indifference  mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a satirical play of feature which could hardly be called a smile, he nodded and  left the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_21"></a><b>Chapter 21<br>
    A Change</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all up. I&rsquo;m beaten on my own ground.&rdquo; Thus confessed Sweetwater, in great  dejection, to himself. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to take advantage of the permission he&rsquo;s  just given me and continue the listening act. Just because he told me to and  just because he thinks I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s no worse than to spend hours of  restless tossing in bed, trying to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  our young detective did neither.</p>
  <p>As  he was putting his supper dishes away, a messenger boy knocked at his door and  handed him a note. It was from Mr. Gryce and ran thus:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Steal  off, if you can, and as soon as you can, and meet me in Twenty-ninth Street. A  discovery has been made which alters the whole situation.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
    O. B. Again</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  happened? Something very important. I ought to hope so after this confounded  failure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Failure?  Didn&rsquo;t he read the letters?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he read them. Had to, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  weaken? Eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  he didn&rsquo;t weaken. You can&rsquo;t get water out of a millstone. You may squeeze and  squeeze; but it&rsquo;s your fingers which suffer, not it. He thinks we manufactured  those letters ourselves on purpose to draw him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  I knew we had a reputation for finesse, but I didn&rsquo;t know that it ran that  high.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  denies everything. Said she would never have written such letters to him; even  goes so far to declare that if she did write them&mdash;(he must be strangely  ignorant of her handwriting) they were meant for some other man than himself.  All rot, but&mdash;&rdquo; A hitch of the shoulder conveyed Sweetwater&rsquo;s disgust. His  uniform good nature was strangely disturbed.</p>
  <p>But  Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s was not. The faint smile with which he smoothed with an easy,  circling movement, the already polished top of his ever present cane conveyed a  secret complacency which called up a flash of discomfiture to his greatly  irritated companion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  says that, does he? You found him on the whole tolerably straightforward, eh? A  hard nut; but hard nuts are usually sound ones. Come, now! prejudice aside,  what&rsquo;s your honest opinion of the man you&rsquo;ve had under your eye and ear for  three solid weeks? Hasn&rsquo;t there been the best of reasons for your failure?  Speak up, my boy. Squarely, now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t. I hate the fellow. I hate any one who makes me look ridiculous. He&mdash;well,  well, if you&rsquo;ll have it, sir, I will say this much. If it weren&rsquo;t for that  blasted coincidence of the two deaths equally mysterious, equally under his  eye, I&rsquo;d stake my life on his honesty. But that coincidence stumps me and&mdash;and a  sort of feeling I have here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  is to be hoped that the slap he gave his breast, at this point, carried off  some of his superfluous emotion. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t account for a feeling, Mr. Gryce.  The man <i>has no heart</i>. He&rsquo;s as hard as rocks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  not uncommon lack where the head plays so big a part. We can&rsquo;t hang him on any  such argument as that. You&rsquo;ve found no evidence against him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no.&rdquo;  The hesitating admission was only a proof of Sweetwater&rsquo;s obstinacy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  listen to this. The test with the letters failed, because what he said about  them was true. They were not meant for him. Miss Challoner had another lover.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  another? I thought there were a half-dozen, at least.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another  whom she favoured. The letters found in her possession&mdash;not the ones she wrote  herself, but those which were written to her over the signature O. B. were not  all from the same hand. Experts have been busy with them for a week, and their  reports are unanimous. The O. B. who wrote the threatening lines acknowledged  to by Orlando Brotherson, was not the O. B. who penned all of those love  letters. The similarity in the writing misled us at first, but once the doubt  was raised by Mr. Challoner&rsquo;s discovery of an allusion in one of them which  pointed to another writer than Mr. Brotherson, and experts had no difficulty in  reaching the decision I have mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  O. B.s! Isn&rsquo;t that incredible, Mr. Gryce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it is incredible; but the incredible is not the impossible. The man you&rsquo;ve been  shadowing denies that these expressive effusions of Miss Challoner were meant  for him. Let us see, then, if we can find the man they were meant for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  second O. B.?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater&rsquo;s  face instantly lit up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean that I&mdash;after my egregious failure&mdash;am not to be kept on the dunce&rsquo;s  seat? That you will give me this new job?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  We don&rsquo;t know of a better man. It isn&rsquo;t your fault, you said it yourself, that  water couldn&rsquo;t be squeezed out of a millstone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Superintendent&mdash;how does he feel about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was the first one to mention you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  glad to see us on a new tack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  pause, during which the eager light in the young detective&rsquo;s eye clouded over.  Presently he remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  will the finding of another O. B. alter Mr. Brotherson&rsquo;s position? He still  will be the one person on the spot, known to have cherished a grievance against  the victim of this mysterious killing. To my mind, this discovery of a more  favoured rival, brings in an element of motive which may rob our self-reliant  friend of some of his complacency. We may further, rather than destroy, our  case against Brotherson by locating a second O.B.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce&rsquo;s eyes twinkled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  won&rsquo;t make your task any more irksome,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;The loop we thus throw out  is as likely to catch Brotherson as his rival. It all depends upon the sort of  man we find in this second O. B.; and whether, in some way unknown to us, he  gave her cause for the sudden and overwhelming rush of despair which alone  supports this general theory of suicide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  prospect grows pleasing. Where am I to look for my man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  ticket is bought to Derby, Pennsylvania. If he is not employed in the great  factories there, we do not know where to find him. We have no other clew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. It&rsquo;s a short journey I have before me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll  bring the colour to your cheeks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;m not kicking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will start to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wish  it were to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you will first inquire, not for O. B., that&rsquo;s too indefinite; but for a young  girl by the name of Doris Scott. She holds the clew; or rather she is the clew  to this second O. B.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another  woman!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  a child;&mdash;well, I won&rsquo;t say child exactly; she must be sixteen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doris  Scott.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  lives in Derby. Derby is a small place. You will have no trouble in finding  this child. It was to her Miss Challoner&rsquo;s last letter was addressed. The one&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  begin to see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  you don&rsquo;t, Sweetwater. The affair is as blind as your hat; nobody sees. We&rsquo;re  just feeling along a thread. O. B.&lsquo;s letters&mdash;the real O. B., I mean, are the  manliest effusions possible. He&rsquo;s no more of a milksop than this Brotherson;  and unlike your indomitable friend he seems to have some heart. I only wish  he&rsquo;d given us some facts; they would have been serviceable. But the letters  reveal nothing except that he knew Doris. He writes in one of them: <i>&lsquo;Doris is  learning to embroider. It&rsquo;s like a fairy weaving a cobweb!&rsquo;</i> Doris isn&rsquo;t a very  common name. She must be the same little girl to whom Miss Challoner wrote from  time to time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  this letter signed O. B.?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  they all are. The only difference between his letters and Brotherson&rsquo;s is this:  Brotherson&rsquo;s retain the date and address; the second O. B.&lsquo;s do not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  not? Torn off, do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  or rather, neatly cut away; and as none of the envelopes were kept, the only  means by which we can locate the writer is through this girl Doris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I remember rightly Miss Challoner&rsquo;s letter to this child was free from all  mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so. It is as open as the day. That is why it has been mentioned as showing the  freedom of Miss Challoner&rsquo;s mind five minutes before that fatal thrust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  took up the sheet Mr. Gryce pushed towards him and re-read these lines:</p>
  <p class="note"><i>&ldquo;Dear Little Doris:</i></p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;It is a snowy night, but it is all bright inside and  I feel no chill in mind or body. I hope it is so in the little cottage in Derby;  that my little friend is as happy with harsh winds blowing from the mountains  as she was on the summer day she came to see me at this hotel. I like to think  of her as cheerful and beaming, rejoicing in tasks which make her so womanly  and sweet. She is often, often in my mind.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Affectionately your friend,</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;EDITH A. CHALLONER.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  to a child of sixteen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;D-o-r-i-s  spells something besides Doris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  there is a Doris. Remember that O. B. says in one of his letters, &lsquo;Doris is  learning to embroider.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I remember that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you must first find Doris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  as Miss Challoner&rsquo;s letter was directed to Derby, Pennsylvania, you will go to  Derby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything  more?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  been reading this letter again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  worth it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  last sentence expresses a hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  has been noted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater&rsquo;s  eyes slowly rose till they rested on Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s face: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll cling to the  thread you&rsquo;ve given me. I&rsquo;ll work myself through the labyrinth before us till I  reach <i>him</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce smiled; but there was more age, wisdom and sympathy for youthful  enthusiasm in that smile than there was confidence or hope.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_23"></a><b>Chapter 23<br>
    Doris</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;A  young girl named Doris Scott?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  station-master looked somewhat sharply at the man he was addressing, and  decided to give the direction asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is but one young girl in town of that name,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;and she lives in  that little house you see just beyond the works. But let me tell you,  stranger,&rdquo; he went on with some precipitation&mdash;</p>
  <p>But  here he was called off, and Sweetwater lost the conclusion of his warning, if  warning it was meant to be. This did not trouble the detective. He stood a  moment, taking in the prospect; decided that the Works and the Works alone made  the town, and started for the house which had been pointed out to him. His way  lay through the chief business street, and greatly preoccupied by his errand,  he gave but a passing glance to the rows on rows of workmen&rsquo;s dwellings  stretching away to the left in seemingly endless perspective. Yet in that  glance he certainly took in the fact that the sidewalks were blocked with  people and wondered if it were a holiday. If so, it must be an enforced one,  for the faces showed little joy. Possibly a strike was on. The anxiety he  everywhere saw pictured on young faces and old, argued some trouble; but if the  trouble was that, why were all heads turned indifferently from the Works, and  why were the Works themselves in full blast?</p>
  <p>These  questions he may have asked himself and he may not. His attention was entirely  centred on the house he saw before him and on the possible developments  awaiting him there. Nothing else mattered. Briskly he stepped out along the  sandy road, and after a turn or two which led him quite away from the Works and  its surrounding buildings, he came out upon the highway and this house.</p>
  <p>It  was a low and unpretentious one, and had but one distinguishing feature. The  porch which hung well over the doorstep was unique in shape and gave an air of  picturesqueness to an otherwise simple exterior; a picturesqueness which was  much enhanced in its effect by the background of illimitable forest, which  united the foreground of this pleasing picture with the great chain of hills  which held the Works and town in its ample basin.</p>
  <p>As  he approached the doorstep, his mind involuntarily formed an anticipatory image  of the child whose first stitches in embroidery were like a fairy&rsquo;s weaving to  the strong man who worked in ore and possibly figured out bridges. That she  would prove to be of the anemic type, common among working girls gifted with an  imagination they have but scant opportunity to exercise, he had little doubt.</p>
  <p>He  was therefore greatly taken aback, when at his first step upon the porch, the  door before him flew open and he beheld in the dark recess beyond a young woman  of such bright and blooming beauty that he hardly noticed her expression of  extreme anxiety, till she lifted her hand and laid an admonitory finger softly  on her lip:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;  she whispered, with an earnestness which roused him from his absorption and  restored him to the full meaning of this encounter. &ldquo;There is sickness in the  house and we are very anxious. Is your errand an important one? If not&mdash;&rdquo; The  faltering break in the fresh, young voice, the look she cast behind her into  the darkened interior, were eloquent with the hope that he would recognise her  impatience and pass on.</p>
  <p>And  so he might have done,&mdash;so he would have done under all ordinary circumstances.  But if this was Doris&mdash;and he did not doubt the fact after the first moment of  startled surprise&mdash;how dare he forego this opportunity of settling the question  which had brought him here.</p>
  <p>With  a slight stammer but otherwise giving no evidence of the effect made upon him  by the passionate intensity with which she had urged this plea, he assured her  that his errand was important, but one so quickly told that it would delay her  but a moment. &ldquo;But first,&rdquo; said he, with very natural caution, &ldquo;let me make  sure that it is to Miss Doris Scott I am speaking. My errand is to her and her  only.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without  showing any surprise, perhaps too engrossed in her own thoughts to feel any,  she answered with simple directness, &ldquo;Yes, I am Doris Scott.&rdquo; Whereupon he  became his most persuasive self, and pulling out a folded paper from his  pocket, opened it and held it before her, with these words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  will you be so good as to glance at this letter and tell me if the person whose  initials you will find at the bottom happens to be in town at the present  moment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  some astonishment now, she glanced down at the sheet thus boldly thrust before  her, and recognising the O and the B of a well-known signature, she flashed a  look back at Sweetwater in which he read a confusion of emotions for which he  was hardly prepared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  thought he, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s coming. In another moment I shall hear what will repay me for  the trials and disappointments of all these months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the moment passed and he had heard nothing. Instead, she dropped her hands from  the door-jamb and gave such unmistakable evidences of intended flight, that but  one alternative remained to him; he became abrupt.</p>
  <p>Thrusting  the paper still nearer, he said, with an emphasis which could not fail of  making an impression, &ldquo;Read it. Read the whole letter. You will find your name  there. This communication was addressed to Miss Challoner, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Oh,  now she found words! With a low cry, she put out her hand in quick entreaty,  begging him to desist and not speak that name on any pretext or for any  purpose. &ldquo;He may rouse and hear,&rdquo; she explained, with another quick look behind  her. &ldquo;The doctor says that this is the critical day. He may become conscious  any minute. If he should and were to hear that name, it might kill him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He!&rdquo;  Sweetwater perked up his ears. &ldquo;Who do you mean by he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Brotherson, my patient, he whose letter&mdash;&rdquo; But here her impatience rose above  every other consideration. Without attempting to finish her sentence, or  yielding in the least to her curiosity or interest in this man&rsquo;s errand, she  cried out with smothered intensity, &ldquo;Go! go! I cannot stay another moment from  his bedside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  a thunderbolt could not have moved Sweetwater after the hearing of that name.  &ldquo;Mr. Brotherson!&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;<i>Brotherson! Not Orlando?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no; his name is Oswald. He&rsquo;s the manager of these Works. He&rsquo;s sick with  typhoid. We are caring for him. If you belonged here you would <i>know</i> that much.  There! that&rsquo;s his voice you hear. Go, if you have any mercy.&rdquo; And she began to  push to the door.</p>
  <p>But  Sweetwater was impervious to all hint. With eager eyes straining into the  shadowy depths just visible over her shoulder, he listened eagerly for the  disjointed words now plainly to be heard in some near-by but unseen chamber.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  second O. B.!&rdquo; he inwardly declared. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s a Brotherson also, and&mdash;<i>sick!</i>  Miss Scott,&rdquo; he whisperingly entreated as her hand fell in manifest despair  from the door, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t send me away yet. I&rsquo;ve a question of the greatest  importance to put you, and one minute more cannot make any difference to him.  Listen! those cries are the cries of delirium; he cannot miss you; he&rsquo;s not  even conscious.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  calling out in his sleep. He&rsquo;s calling her, just as he has called for the last  two weeks. But he will wake conscious&mdash;or he will not wake at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  anguish trembling in that latter phrase would have attracted Sweetwater&rsquo;s  earnest, if not pitiful, attention at any other time, but now he had ears only  for the cry which at that moment came ringing shrilly from within&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Edith!  Edith!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  living shouting for the dead! A heart still warm sending forth its longing to  the pierced and pulseless one, hidden in a far-off tomb! To Sweetwater, who had  seen Miss Challoner buried, this summons of distracted love came with weird  force.</p>
  <p>Then  the present regained its sway. He heard her name again, and this time it  sounded less like a call and more like the welcoming cry of meeting spirits.  Was death to end this separation? Had he found the true O. B., only to behold  another and final seal fall upon this closely folded mystery? In his fear of  this possibility, he caught at Doris&rsquo; hand as she was about to bound away, and  eagerly asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  was Mr. Brotherson taken ill? Tell me, I entreat you; the exact day and, if you  can, the exact hour. More depends upon this than you can readily realise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  wrenched her hand from his, panting with impatience and a vague alarm. But she  answered him distinctly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the Twenty-fifth of last month, just an hour after he was made manager. He fell  in a faint at the Works.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  day&mdash;the very day of Miss Challoner&rsquo;s death!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  he heard&mdash;did you tell him then or afterwards what happened in New York on that  very date?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no, we have not told him. It would have killed him&mdash;and may yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Edith!  Edith!&rdquo; came again through the hush, a hush so deep that Sweetwater received  the impression that the house was empty save for patient and nurse.</p>
  <p>This  discovery had its effects upon him. Why should he subject this young and loving  girl to further pain? He had already learned more than he had expected to. The  rest would come with time. But at the first intimation he gave of leaving, she  lost her abstracted air and turned with absolute eagerness towards him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  moment,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;You are a stranger and I do not know your name or your  purpose here. But I cannot let you go without begging you not to mention to any  one in this town that Mr. Brotherson has any interest in the lady whose name we  must not speak. Do not repeat that delirious cry you have heard or betray in  any way our intense and fearful interest in this young lady&rsquo;s strange death.  You have shown me a letter. Do not speak of that letter, I entreat you. Help us  to retain our secret a little longer. Only the doctor and myself know what  awaits Mr. Brotherson if he lives. I had to tell the doctor, but a doctor  reveals nothing. Promise that you will not either, at least till this crisis is  passed. It will help my father and it will help me; and we need all the help we  can get.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  allowed himself one minute of thought, then he earnestly replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will keep your secret for to-day, and longer, if possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;thank you. I thought I saw kindness in your face.&rdquo; And she  again prepared to close the door.</p>
  <p>But  Sweetwater had one more question to ask. &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said he, as he stepped  down on the walk, &ldquo;you say that this is a critical day with your patient. Is  that why every one whom I have seen so far wears such a look of anxiety?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes,&rdquo; she cried, giving him one other glimpse of her lovely, agitated face.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s but one feeling in town to-day, but one hope, and, as I believe, but  one prayer. That the man whom every one loves and every one trusts may live to  run these Works.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Edith!  Edith!&rdquo; rose in ceaseless reiteration from within.</p>
  <p>But  it rang but faintly now in the ears of our detective. The door had fallen to,  and Sweetwater&rsquo;s share in the anxieties of that household was over.</p>
  <p>Slowly  he moved away. He was in a confused yet elated condition of mind. Here was food  for a thousand new thoughts and conjectures. An Orlando Brotherson and an  Oswald Brotherson&mdash;relatives possibly, strangers possibly; but whether relatives  or strangers, both given to signing their letters with their initials simply;  and both the acknowledged admirers of the deceased Miss Challoner. But she had  loved only one, and that one, Oswald. It not difficult to recognise the object  of this high hearted woman&rsquo;s affections in this man whose struggle with the  master-destroyer had awakened the solicitude of a whole town.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_24"></a><b>Chapter 24<br>
    Suspense</b></h2>
  <p>Ten  minutes after Sweetwater&rsquo;s arrival in the village streets, he was at home with  the people he found there. His conversation with Doris in the doorway of her  home had been observed by the curious and far-sighted, and the questions asked  and answered had made him friends at once. Of course, he could tell them  nothing, but that did not matter, he had seen and talked with Doris and their  idolised young manager was no worse and might possibly soon be better.</p>
  <p>Of  his own affairs&mdash;of his business with Doris and the manager, they asked nothing.  All ordinary interests were lost in the stress of their great suspense.</p>
  <p>It  was the same in the bar-room of the one hotel. Without resorting to more than a  question or two, he readily learned all that was generally known of Oswald  Brotherson. Every one was talking about him, and each had some story to tell  illustrative of his kindness, his courage and his quick mind. The Works had  never produced a man of such varied capabilities and all round sympathies. To  have him for manager meant the greatest good which could befall this little  community.</p>
  <p>His  rise had been rapid. He had come from the east three years before, new to the  work. Now, he was the one man there. Of his relationships east, family or  otherwise, nothing was said. For them his life began and ended in Derby, and  Sweetwater could see, though no actual expression was given to the feeling,  that there was but one expectation in regard to him and Doris, to whose  uncommon beauty and sweetness they all seemed fully alive. And Sweetwater  wondered, as many of us have wondered, at the gulf frequently existing between  fancy and fact.</p>
  <p>Later  there came a small excitement. The doctor was seen riding by on his way to the  sick man. From the window where he sat, Sweetwater watched him pass up the  street and take the road he had himself so lately traversed. It was so straight  a one and led so directly northward that he could follow with his eye the  doctor&rsquo;s whole course, and even get a glimpse of his figure as he stepped from  the buggy and proceeded to tie up the horse. There was an energy about him  pleasing to Sweetwater. He might have much to do with this doctor. If Oswald  Brotherson died&mdash;but he was not willing to consider this possibility&mdash;yet. His  personal sympathies, to say nothing of his professional interest in the mystery  to which this man&mdash;and this man only&mdash;possibly held the key, alike forbade. He  would hope, as these others were hoping, and if he did not count the minutes,  he at least saw every move of the old horse waiting with drooping head and the  resignation of long custom for the re-appearance of his master with his news of  life or death.</p>
  <p>And  so an hour&mdash;two hours passed. Others were watching the old horse now. The street  showed many an eager figure with head turned northward. From the open door-ways  women stepped, looked in the direction of their anxiety and retreated to their  work again. Suspense was everywhere; the moments dragged like hours; it became  so keen at last that some impatient hearts could no longer stand it. A woman  put her baby into another woman&rsquo;s arms and hurried up the road; another  followed, then another; then an old man, bowed with years and of tottering  steps, began to go that way, halting a dozen times before he reached the group  now collected in the dusty highway, near but not too near that house. As  Sweetwater&rsquo;s own enthusiasm swelled at this sight, he thought of the other  Brotherson with his theories and active advocacy for reform, and wondered if  men and women would forego their meals and stand for hours in the keen spring  wind just to be the first to hear if he were to live or die. He knew that he  himself would not. But he had suffered much both in his pride and his purse at  the hands of the Brooklyn inventor; and such despoliation is not a reliable  basis for sympathy. He was questioning his own judgment in this matter and  losing himself in the mazes of past doubts and conjectures when a sudden change  took place in the aspect of the street; he saw people running, and in another  moment saw why. The doctor had shown himself on the porch which all were  watching. Was he coming out? No, he stands quite still, runs his eye over the  people waiting quietly in the road, and beckons to one of the smaller boys. The  child, with upturned face, stands listening to what he has to say, then starts  on a run for the village. He is stopped, pulled about, questioned, and allowed  to run on. Many rush forth to meet him. He is panting, but gleeful. Mr.  Brotherson has waked up conscious, and the doctor says, <i>He will live</i>.</p>

    The Oval Hut</b></h2>
  <p>That  night Dr. Fenton had a visitor. We know that visitor and we almost know what  his questions were, if not the answers of the good doctor. Nevertheless, it may  be better to listen to a part at least of their conversation. Sweetwater, who  knew when to be frank and open, as well as when to be reserved and ambiguous,  made no effort to disguise the nature of his business or his chief cause of  interest in Oswald Brotherson. The eye which met his was too penetrating not to  detect the smallest attempt at subterfuge; besides, Sweetwater had no need to  hide his errand; it was one of peace, and it threatened nobody&mdash;&ldquo;the more&rsquo;s the  pity,&rdquo; thought he in uneasy comment to himself, as he realised the hopelessness  of the whole situation.</p>
  <p>His  first word, therefore, was a plain announcement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Fenton, my name is Sweetwater. I am from New York, and represent for the nonce,  Mr. Challoner, whose name I have simply to mention, for you to understand that  my business is with Mr. Brotherson whom I am sorry to find seriously, if not  dangerously, ill. Will you tell me how long you think it will be before I can  have a talk with him on a subject which I will not disguise from you may prove  a very exciting one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Weeks,  weeks,&rdquo; returned the doctor. &ldquo;Mr. Brotherson has been a very sick man and the  only hope I have of his recovery is the fact that he is ignorant of his trouble  or that he has any cause for doubt or dread. Were this happy condition of  things to be disturbed,&mdash;were the faintest rumour of sorrow or disaster to reach  him in his present weakened state, I should fear a relapse, with all its  attendant dangers. What then, if any intimation should be given him of the  horrible tragedy suggested by the name you have mentioned? The man would die  before your eyes. Mr. Challoner&rsquo;s business will have to wait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I see; but if I knew when I might speak&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can give you no date. Typhoid is a treacherous complaint; he has the best of  nurses and the chances are in favour of a quick recovery; but we never can be  sure. You had better return to New York. Later, you can write me if you wish,  or Mr. Challoner can. You may have confidence in my reply; it will not mislead  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  muttered his thanks and rose. Then he slowly sat down again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dr.  Fenton,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;you are a man to be trusted. I&rsquo;m in a devil of a fix, and  there is just a possibility that you may be able to help me out. It is the  general opinion in New York, as you may know, that Miss Challoner committed  suicide. But the circumstances do not fully bear out this theory, nor can Mr.  Challoner be made to accept it. Indeed, he is so convinced of its falsehood,  that he stands ready to do anything, pay anything, suffer anything, to have  this distressing blight removed from his daughter&rsquo;s good name. Mr. Brotherson  was her dearest friend, and as such may have the clew to this mystery, but Mr.  Brotherson may not be in a condition to speak for several weeks. Meanwhile, Mr.  Challoner must suffer from great suspense unless&mdash;&rdquo; a pause during which he  searched the doctor&rsquo;s face with a perfectly frank and inquiring  expression&mdash;&ldquo;unless some one else can help us out. Dr. Fenton, can you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  doctor did not need to speak; his expression conveyed his answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  more than another,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Except for what Doris felt compelled to tell me,  I know as little as yourself. Mr. Brotherson&rsquo;s delirium took the form of  calling continually upon one name. I did not know this name, but Doris did,  also the danger lurking in the fact that he had yet to hear of the tragedy  which had robbed him of this woman to whom he was so deeply attached. So she  told me just this much. That the Edith whose name rung so continuously in our  ears was no other than the Miss Challoner of New York of whose death and its  tragic circumstances the papers have been full; that their engagement was a  secret one unshared so far as she knew by any one but herself. That she begged  me to preserve this secret and to give her all the help I could when the time  came for him to ask questions. Especially did she entreat me to be with her at  the crisis. I was, but his waking was quite natural. He did not ask for Miss  Challoner; he only inquired how long he had been ill and whether Doris had  received a letter during that time. She had not received one, a fact which  seemed to disappoint him; but she carried it off so gaily (she is a wonderful  girl, Mr. Sweetwater&mdash;the darling of all our hearts), saying that he must not be  so egotistical as to think that the news of his illness had gone beyond Derby,  that he soon recovered his spirits and became a very promising convalescent.  That is all I know about the matter; little more, I take it, than you know  yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  nodded; he had expected nothing from the doctor, and was not disappointed at  his failure. There were two strings to his bow, and the one proving valueless,  he proceeded to test the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have mentioned Miss Scott, as the confidante&mdash;and only confidante of this  unhappy pair,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Would it be possible&mdash;can you make it possible for me  to see <i>her?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a daring proposition; he understood this at once from the doctor&rsquo;s  expression; and, fearing a hasty rebuff, he proceeded to supplement his request  with a few added arguments, urged with such unexpected address and show of  reason that Dr. Fenton&rsquo;s aspect visibly softened and in the end he found  himself ready to promise that he would do what he could to secure his visitor  the interview he desired if he would come to the house the next day at the time  of his own morning visit.</p>
  <p>This  was as much as the young detective could expect, and having expressed his  thanks, he took his leave in anything but a discontented frame of mind. With so  powerful an advocate as the doctor, he felt confident that he should soon be  able to conquer this young girl&rsquo;s reticence and learn all that was to be  learned from any one but Mr. Brotherson himself. In the time which must elapse  between that happy hour and the present, he would circulate and learn what he  could about the prospective manager. But he soon found that he could not enter  the Works without a permit, and this he was hardly in a position to demand; so  he strolled about the village instead, and later wandered away into the forest.</p>
  <p>Struck  by the inviting aspect of a narrow and little used road opening from the  highway shortly above the house where his interests were just then centred, he  strolled into the heart of the spring woods till he came to a depression where  a surprise awaited him, in the shape of a peculiar structure rising from its  midst where it just fitted, or so nearly fitted that one could hardly walk  about it without brushing the surrounding tree trunks. Of an oval shape, with  its door facing the approach, it nestled there, a wonder to the eye and the  occasion of considerable speculation to his inquiring mind. It had not been  long built, as was shown very plainly by the fresh appearance of the unpainted  boards of which it was constructed; and while it boasted of a door, as I&rsquo;ve  already said, there were no evidences visible of any other break in the smooth,  neatly finished walls. A wooden ellipse with a roof but no windows; such it  appeared and such it proved to be. A mystery to Sweetwater&rsquo;s eyes, and like all  mysteries, interesting. For what purpose had it been built and why this  isolation? It was too flimsy for a reservoir and too expensive for the wild  freak of a crank.</p>
  <p>A  nearer view increased his curiosity. In the projection of the roof over the  curving sides he found fresh food for inquiry. As he examined it in the walk he  made around the whole structure, he came to a place where something like a  hinge became visible and further on another. The roof was not simply a roof; it  was also a lid capable of being raised for the air and light which the lack of  windows necessitated. This was an odd discovery indeed, giving to the uncanny  structure the appearance of a huge box, the cover of which could be raised or  lowered at pleasure. And again he asked himself for what it could be intended?  What enterprise, even of the great Works, could demand a secrecy so absolute  that such pains as these should be taken to shut out all possibility of a  prying eye. Nothing in his experience supplied him with an answer.</p>
  <p>He  was still looking up at these hinges, with a glance which took in at the same  time the nearness and extreme height of the trees by which this sylvan mystery  was surrounded, when a sound from the road on the opposite side of the hollow  brought his conjectures to a standstill and sent him hurrying on to the nearest  point from which that road became visible.</p>
  <p>A  team was approaching. He could hear the heavy tread of horses working their  laborious way through trees whose obstructing branches swished before and  behind them. They were bringing in a load for this shed, whose uses he would  consequently soon understand. Grateful for his good luck&mdash;for his was a  curiosity which could not stand defeat&mdash;he took a few steps into the wood, and  from the vantage point of a concealing cluster of bushes, fixed his eyes upon  the spot where the road opened into the hollow.</p>
  <p>Something  blue moved there, and in another moment, to his great amazement, there stepped  into view the spirited form of Doris Scott, who if he had given the matter a  thought he would have supposed to be sitting just then by the bedside of her  patient, a half mile back on the road.</p>
  <p>She  was dressed for the woods in a blue skirt and jacket and moved like a leader in  front of a heavily laden wagon now coming to a standstill before the closely  shut shed&mdash;if such we may call it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have a key,&rdquo; so she called out to the driver who had paused for orders. &ldquo;When I  swing the doors wide, drive straight in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  took a look at the wagon. It was piled high with large wooden boxes on more  than one of which he could see scrawled the words: O. Brotherson, Derby, Pa.</p>
  <p>This  explained her presence, but the boxes told nothing. They were of all sizes and  shapes, and some of them so large that the assistance of another man was needed  to handle them. Sweetwater was about to offer his services when a second man  appeared from somewhere in the rear, and the detective&rsquo;s attention being thus  released from the load out of which he could make nothing, he allowed it to  concentrate upon the young girl who had it in charge and who, for many reasons,  was the one person of supreme importance to him.</p>
  <p>She  had swung open the two wide doors, and now stood waiting for horse and wagon to  enter. With locks flying free&mdash;she wore no bonnet&mdash;she presented a picture of ever  increasing interest to Sweetwater. Truly she was a very beautiful girl,  buoyant, healthy and sweet; as unlike as possible his preconceived notions of  Miss Challoner&rsquo;s humble little protegee. Her brown hair of a rich chestnut hue,  was in itself a wonder. On no head, even in the great city he had just left,  had he seen such abundance, held in such modest restraint. Nature had been  partial to this little working girl and given her the <i>chevelure </i>of a queen.</p>
  <p>But  this was nothing. No one saw this aureole when once the eye had rested on her  features and caught the full nobility of their expression and the lurking  sweetness underlying her every look. She herself made the charm and whether  placed high or placed low, must ever attract the eye and afterwards lure the  heart, by an individuality which hardly needed perfect features in which to  express itself.</p>
  <p>Young  yet, but gifted, as girls of her class often are, with the nicest instincts and  purest aspirations, she showed the elevation of her thoughts both in her glance  and the poise with which she awaited events. Sweetwater watched her with  admiration as she superintended the unloading of the wagon and the disposal of  the various boxes on the floor within; but as nothing she said during the  process was calculated to afford the least enlightenment in regard to their  contents, he presently wearied of his inaction and turned back towards the  highway, comforting himself with the reflection that in a few short hours he  would have her to himself when nothing but a blunder on his part should hinder  him from sounding her young mind and getting such answers to his questions as  the affair in which he was so deeply interested, demanded.</p>

    Sweetwater Returns</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see me again, Miss Scott. I hope that yesterday&rsquo;s intrusion has not prejudiced  you against me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no prejudices,&rdquo; was her simple but firm reply. &ldquo;I am only hurried and very  anxious. The doctor is with Mr. Brotherson just now; but he has several other  equally sick patients to visit and I dare not keep him here too long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you will welcome my abruptness. Miss Scott, here is a letter from Mr.  Challoner. It will explain my position. As you will see, his only desire is to  establish the fact that his daughter did not commit suicide. She was all he had  in the world, and the thought that she could, for any reason, take her own life  is unbearable to him. Indeed, he will not believe she did so, evidence or no  evidence. May I ask if you agree with him? You have seen Miss Challoner, I  believe. Do you think she was the woman to plunge a dagger in her heart in a  place as public as a hotel reception room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Mr. Sweetwater. I&rsquo;m a poor working girl, with very little education and almost  no knowledge of the world and such ladies as she. But something tells me for  all that, that she was too nice to do this. I saw her once and it made me want  to be quiet and kind and beautiful like her. I never shall think she did  anything so horrible. Nor will Mr. Brotherson ever believe it. He could not and  live. You see, I am talking to you as if you knew him,&mdash;the kind of man he is  and just how he feels towards Miss Challoner. He is&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice trailed off and  a look, uncommon and almost elevated, illumined her face. &ldquo;I will not tell you  what he is; you will know, if you ever see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  the favourable opinion of a whole town makes a good fellow, he ought to be of  the best,&rdquo; returned Sweetwater, with his most honest smile. &ldquo;I hear but one  story of him wherever I turn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is but one story to tell,&rdquo; she smiled, and her head drooped softly, but with no  air of self-consciousness.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  watched her for a moment, and then remarked: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take one thing for  granted; that you are as anxious as we are to clear Miss Challoner&rsquo;s memory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  yes, O yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  than that, that you are ready and eager to help us. Your very looks show that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right; I would do anything to help you. But what can a girl like me do?  Nothing; nothing. I know too little. Mr. Challoner must see that when you tell  him I&rsquo;m only the daughter of a foreman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  a friend of Mr. Brotherson,&rdquo; supplemented Sweetwater.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she smiled, &ldquo;he would want me to say so. But that&rsquo;s his goodness. I don&rsquo;t  deserve the honour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  friend and therefore his confidante,&rdquo; Sweetwater continued. &ldquo;He has talked to  you about Miss Challoner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  had to. There was nobody else to whom he could talk; and then, I had seen her  and could understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did you see her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  New York. I was there once with father, who took me to see her. I think she had  asked Mr. Brotherson to send his little friend to her hotel if ever we came to  New York.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was some time ago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  were there in June.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you have corresponded ever since with Miss Challoner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has been good enough to write, and I have ventured at times to answer her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  suspicion which might have come to some men found no harbour in Sweetwater&rsquo;s  mind. This young girl was beautiful, there was no denying that, beautiful in a  somewhat startling and quite unusual way; but there was nothing in her bearing,  nothing in Miss Challoner&rsquo;s letters to indicate that she had been a cause for  jealousy in the New York lady&rsquo;s mind. He, therefore, ignored this possibility,  pursuing his inquiry along the direct lines he had already laid out for  himself. Smiling a little, but in a very earnest fashion, he pointed to the  letter she still held and quietly said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember  that I&rsquo;m not speaking for myself, Miss Scott, when I seem a little too  persistent and inquiring. You have corresponded with Miss Challoner; you have  been told the fact of her secret engagement to Mr. Brotherson and you have been  witness to his conduct and manner for the whole time he has been separated from  her. Do you, when you think of it carefully, recall anything in the whole story  of this romance which would throw light upon the cruel tragedy which has so  unexpectedly ended it? <i>Anything</i>, Miss Scott? Straws show which way the stream  flows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was vehement, instantly vehement, in her disclaimer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can answer at once,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;because I have thought of nothing else for all  these weeks. Here all was well. Mr. Brotherson was hopeful and happy and  believed in her happiness and willingness to wait for his success. And this  success was coming so fast! Oh, how can we ever tell him! How can we ever  answer his questions even, or keep him satisfied and calm until he is strong  enough to hear the truth. I&rsquo;ve had to acknowledge already that I have had no  letter from her for weeks. She never wrote to him directly, you know, and she  never sent him messages, but he knew that a letter to me, was also a letter to  him and I can see that he is troubled by this long silence, though he says I  was right not to let her know of his illness and that I must continue to keep  her in ignorance of it till he is quite well again and can write to her  himself. It is hard to hear him talk like this and not look sad or frightened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  remembered Miss Challoner&rsquo;s last letter, and wished he had it here to give her.  In default of this, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  this not hearing may act in the way of a preparation for the shock which must  come to him sooner or later. Let us hope so, Miss Scott.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  eyes filled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  can prepare him,&rdquo; said she. Then added, with a yearning accent, &ldquo;I wish I were  older or had more experience. I should not feel so helpless. But the gratitude  I owe him will give me strength when I need it most. Only I wish the suffering  might be mine rather than his.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Unconscious  of any self-betrayal, she lifted her eyes, startling Sweetwater by the beauty  of her look. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m so sorry for Oswald Brotherson,&rdquo; he murmured to  himself as he left her. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a more fortunate man than he knows, however  deeply he may feel the loss of his first sweetheart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  evening the disappointed Sweetwater took the train for New York. He had failed  to advance the case in hand one whit, yet the countenance he showed Mr. Gryce  at their first interview was not a wholly gloomy one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifty  dollars to the bad!&rdquo; was his first laconic greeting. &ldquo;All I have learned is  comprised in these two statements. The second O. B. is a fine fellow; and not  intentionally the cause of our tragedy. He does not even know about it. He&rsquo;s  down with the fever at present and they haven&rsquo;t told him. When he&rsquo;s better we  may hear something; but I doubt even that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  complied; and such is the unconsciousness with which we often encounter the  pivotal circumstance upon which our future or the future of our most cherished  undertaking hangs, he omitted from his story, the sole discovery which was of  any real importance in the unravelling of the mystery in which they were so  deeply concerned. He said nothing of his walk in the woods or of what he saw  there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  meagre haul,&rdquo; he remarked at the close.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that&rsquo;s as it should be, if you and I are right in our impressions and the clew  to this mystery lies here in the character and daring of Orlando Brotherson.  That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not down in the mouth. Which goes to show what a grip my  prejudices have on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  prejudiced as a bulldog.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly.  By the way, what news of the gentleman I&rsquo;ve just mentioned? Is he as serene in  my absence as when under my eye?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  so; he looks like a man on the verge of triumph. But I fear the triumph he  anticipates has nothing to do with our affairs. All his time and thought is  taken up with his invention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  discourage me, sir. And now to see Mr. Challoner. Small comfort can I carry  <i>him</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_27"></a><b>Chapter 27<br>
    The Image Of Dread</b></h2>
  <p>In  the comfortable little sitting-room of the Scott cottage Doris stood, looking  eagerly from the window which gave upon the road. Behind her on the other side  of the room, could be seen through a partly opened door, a neatly spread bed,  with a hand lying quietly on the patched coverlet. It was a strong looking hand  which, even when quiescent, conveyed the idea of purpose and vitality. As Doris  said, the fingers never curled up languidly, but always with the hint of a  clench. Several weeks had passed since the departure of Sweetwater and the  invalid was fast gaining strength. To-morrow, he would be up.</p>
  <p>Was  Doris thinking of him? Undoubtedly, for her eyes often flashed his way; but her  main attention was fixed upon the road, though no one was in sight at the  moment. Some one had passed for whose return she looked; some one whom, if she  had been asked to describe, she would have called a tall, fine-looking man of  middle age, of a cultivated appearance seldom seen in this small manufacturing  town; seldom seen, possibly, in any town. He had glanced up at the window as he  went by, in a manner too marked not to excite her curiosity. Would he look up  again when he came back? She was waiting there to see. Why, she did not know.  She was not used to indulging in petty suppositions of this kind; her life was  too busy, her anxieties too keen. The great dread looming ever before her,&mdash;the dread  of that hour when she must speak,&mdash;left her very little heart for anything  dissociated with this coming event. For a girl of seventeen she was unusually  thoughtful. Life had been hard in this little cottage since her mother died, or  rather she had felt its responsibilities keenly.</p>
  <p>Life  itself could not be hard where Oswald Brotherson lived; neither to man, nor  woman. The cheer of some natures possesses a divine faculty. If it can help no  other way, it does so by the aid of its own light. Such was the character of  this man&rsquo;s temperament. The cottage was a happy place; only&mdash;she never fathomed  the depths of that <i>only</i>. If in these days she essayed at times to do so, she  gave full credit to the Dread which rose ever before her&mdash;rose like a ghost!  She, Doris, led by inscrutable Fate, was waiting to hurt him who hurt nobody;  whose mere presence was a blessing.</p>
  <p>But  her interest had been caught to-day, caught by this stranger, and when during  her eager watch the small messenger from the Works came to the door with the  usual daily supply of books and magazines for the patient, she stepped out on  the porch to speak to him and to point out the gentleman who was now rapidly  returning from his stroll up the road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is that, Johnny?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You know everybody who comes to town. What is the  name of the gentleman you see coming?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  boy looked, searched his memory, not without some show of misgiving.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  queer name,&rdquo; he admitted at last. &ldquo;I never heard the likes of it here before.  Shally something. Shally&mdash;Shally&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Challoner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that&rsquo;s it. How could you guess? He&rsquo;s from New York. Nobody knows why he&rsquo;s here.  Don&rsquo;t seem to have no business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  never mind. Run on, Johnny. And don&rsquo;t forget to come earlier to-morrow; Mr.  Brotherson gets tired waiting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  he? I&rsquo;ll come quick then; quick as I can run.&rdquo; And he sped off at a pace which  promised well for the morrow.</p>
  <p>Challoner!  There was but one Challoner in the world for Doris Scott,&mdash;Edith&rsquo;s father. Was  this he? It <i>must</i> be, or why this haunting sense of something half remembered as  she caught a glimpse of his face. Edith&rsquo;s father! and he was approaching,  approaching rapidly, on his way back to town. Would he stop this time? As the  possibility struck her, she trembled and drew back, entering the house, but  pausing in the hall with her ear turned to the road. She had not closed the  door; something within&mdash;a hope or a dread&mdash;had prevented that. Would he take it  as an invitation to come in? No, no; she was not ready for such an encounter  yet. He might speak Edith&rsquo;s name; Oswald might hear and&mdash;with a gasp she  recognised the closeness of his step; heard it lag, almost halt just where the  path to the house ran into the roadside. But it passed on. He was not going to  force an interview yet. She could hear him retreating further and further away.  The event was not for this day, thank God! She would have one night at least in  which to prepare herself.</p>
  <p>With  a sense of relief so great that she realised, for one shocked moment, the full  extent of her fears, she hastened back into the sitting-room, with her  collection of books and pamphlets. A low voice greeted her. It came from the  adjoining room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doris,  come here, sweet child. I want you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>How  she would have bounded joyously at the summons, had not that Dread raised its  bony finger in every call from that dearly loved voice. As it was, her feet  moved slowly, lingering at the sound. But they carried her to his side at last,  and once there, she smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  what an armful,&rdquo; she cried in joyous greeting, as she held out the bundle she had  brought. &ldquo;You will be amused all day. Only, do not tire yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not want the papers, Doris; not yet. There&rsquo;s something else which must come  first. Doris, I have decided to let you write to her. I&rsquo;m so much better now,  she will not feel alarmed. I must&mdash;must get a word from her. I&rsquo;m starving for  it. I lie here and can think of nothing else. A message&mdash;one little message of  six short words would set me on my feet again. So get your paper and pen, dear  child, and write her one of your prettiest letters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Had  he loved her, he would have perceived the chill which shook her whole body, as  he spoke. But his first thought, his penetrating thought, was not for her and  he saw only the answering glance, the patient smile. She had not expected him  to see more. She knew that she was quite safe from the divining look;  otherwise, he would have known her secret long ago.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  ready,&rdquo; said she. But she did not lay down her bundle. She was not ready for  her task, poor child. She quailed before it. She quailed so much that she  feared to stir lest he should see that she had no command over her movements.</p>
  <p>The  man who watched without seeing wondered that she stood so still and spoke so  briefly. But only for a moment. He thought he understood her hesitation, and a  look of great earnestness replaced his former one of grave decision.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that in doing this I am going beyond my sacred compact with Miss  Challoner,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never thought of illness,&mdash;at least, of illness on my  part. I never dreamt that I, always so well, always so full of life, could know  such feebleness as this, feebleness which is all of the body, Doris, leaving  the mind free to dream and long. Talk of her, child. Tell me all over again  just how she looked and spoke that day you saw her in New York.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  it not be better for me to write my letter first? Papa will be coming soon and  Truda can never cook your bird as you like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Surprised  now by something not quite natural in her manner, he caught at her hand and  held her as she was moving away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are tired,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wearied you with my commission and complaints.  Forgive me, dear child, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are mistaken,&rdquo; she interrupted softly. &ldquo;I am not tired; I only wished to do the  important thing first. Shall I get my desk? Do you really wish me to write?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said he, softly dropping her hand. &ldquo;I wish you to write. It will ensure me good  sleep, and sleep will make me strong. A few words, Doris; just a few words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  nodded; turning quickly away to hide her tears. His smile had gone to her very soul.  It was always a beautiful one, his chief personal attraction, but at this  moment it seemed to concentrate within it the unspoken fervours and the  boundless expectations of a great love, and she who was the aim and cause of  all this sweetness lay in unresponsive silence in a distant tomb!</p>
  <p>But  Doris&rsquo; own smile was not lacking in encouragement and beauty when she came back  a few minutes later and sat down by his side to write. His melted before it,  leaving his eyes very earnest as he watched her bending figure and the  hard-worked little hand at its unaccustomed task.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must give her daily exercises,&rdquo; he decided within himself. &ldquo;That look of pain  shows how difficult this work is for her. It must be made easy at any cost to  my time. Such beauty calls for accomplishment. I must not neglect so plain a  duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meantime,  she was struggling to find words in face of that great Dread. She had written  <i>Dear Miss Challoner</i> and was staring in horror at the soulless words. Only her  sense of duty upheld her. Gladly would she have torn the sheet in two and  rushed away. How could she add sentences to this hollow phrase, the mere  employment of which seemed a sacrilege. <i>Dear Miss Challoner</i>. Oh, she was dear,  but&mdash;</p>
  <p>Unconsciously  the young head drooped, and the pen slid from her hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;I cannot think what to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I help you?&rdquo; came softly from the bed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and not forget that it is  Doris writing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you will be so good,&rdquo; she answered, with renewed courage. &ldquo;I can put the words  down if you will only find them for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Write  then. &lsquo;<i>Dear Miss Challoner!</i> &rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have already written that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you shudder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  cold. I&rsquo;ve been cold all day. But never mind that, Mr. Brotherson. Tell me how  to begin my letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  way. &lsquo;<i>I&rsquo;ve not been able to answer your kind letter, because I have had to play  nurse for some three or four weeks to a very fretful and exacting patient</i>.&rsquo;  Have you written that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Doris, bending over her desk till her curls fell in a tangle over her  white cheeks. &ldquo;I do not like to,&rdquo; she protested at last, with an attempt at  naivete which seemed real enough to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  leave out the <i>fretful</i> if you must, but keep in the <i>exacting</i>. I have been  exacting, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silence,  broken only by the scratching of the stubborn, illy-directed pen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  down,&rdquo; she whispered. She said, afterward, that it was like writing with a  ghost looking over one&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  add, &lsquo;<i>Mr. Brotherson has had a slight attack of fever, but he is getting well  fast, and will soon&mdash;</i>&rsquo; Do I run on too quickly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no, I can follow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  not without losing breath; eh, Doris?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  he laughed, she smiled. There was a heroism in that smile, Oswald Brotherson,  of which you knew nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  might speak a little more slowly,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>
  <p>Quietly  he repeated the last phrase. &ldquo; &lsquo;<i>But he is getting well fast and will soon be  ready to take up the management of the Works which was given him just before he  was taken ill</i>.&rsquo; That will show her that I am working up,&rdquo; he brightly remarked  as Doris carefully penned the last word. &ldquo;Of myself you need say nothing more,  unless&mdash;&rdquo; he paused and his face took on a wistful look which Doris dared not  meet; &ldquo;unless&mdash;but no, no, she must think it has been only a passing  indisposition. If she knew I had been really ill, she would suffer, and perhaps  act imprudently or suffer and not dare to act at all, which might be sadder for  her still. Leave it where it is and begin about yourself. Write a good deal  about yourself, so that she will see that you are not worried and that all is  well with us here. Cannot you do that without assistance? Surely you can tell  her about that last piece of embroidery you showed me. She will be glad to  hear&mdash;why, Doris!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Mr. Brotherson,&rdquo; the poor child burst out, &ldquo;you must let me cry! I&rsquo;m so glad to  see you better and interested in all sorts of things. These are not tears of  grief. I&mdash;I&mdash;but I&rsquo;m forgetting what the doctor told me. You are growing excited,  and I was to see that you were calm, always calm. I will take my desk away. I  will write the rest in the other room, while you look at the magazines.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  bring your letter back for me to seal. I want to see it in its envelope. Oh,  Doris, you are a good little girl!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  shook her head, and hastened to hide herself from him in the other room; and it  was a long time before she came back with the letter folded and in its  envelope. When she did, her face was composed and her manner natural. She had  quite made up her mind what her duty was and how she was going to perform it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  is the letter,&rdquo; said she, laying it in his outstretched hand. Then she turned  her back. She knew, with a woman&rsquo;s unerring instinct why he wished to handle it  before it went. She felt that kiss he folded away in it, in every fibre of her  aroused and sympathetic heart, but the hardest part of the ordeal was over and  her eyes beamed softly when she turned again to take it from his hand and affix  the stamp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will mail it yourself?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I should like to have you put it into the  box with your own hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will put it in to-night, after supper,&rdquo; she promised him.</p>
  <p>His  smile of contentment assured her that this trial of her courage and  self-control was not without one blessed result. He would rest for several days  in the pleasure of what he had done or thought he had done. She need not cringe  before that image of Dread for two, three days at least. Meanwhile, he would  grow strong in body, and she, perhaps, in spirit. Only one precaution she must  take. No hint of Mr. Challoner&rsquo;s presence in town must reach him. He must be  guarded from a knowledge of that fact as certainly as from the more serious one  which lay behind it.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_28"></a><b>Chapter 28<br>
    I Hope Never To See That Man</b></h2>
  <p>That  this would be a difficult thing to do, Doris was soon to realise. Mr. Challoner  continued to pass the house twice a day and the time finally came when he  ventured up the walk.</p>
  <p>Doris  was in the window and saw him coming. She slipped softly out and intercepted  him before he had stepped upon the porch. She had caught up her hat as she  passed through the hall, and was fitting it to her head as he looked up and saw  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Scott?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mr. Challoner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know me?&rdquo; he went on, one foot on the step and one still on the walk.</p>
  <p>Before  replying she closed the door behind her. Then as she noted his surprise she  carefully explained:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Brotherson, our boarder, is just recovering from typhoid. He is still weak and  acutely susceptible to the least noise. I was afraid that our voices might  disturb him. Do you mind walking a little way up the road? That is, if your  visit was intended for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  flush, the beauty which must have struck even him, but more than all else her  youth, seemed to reconcile him to this unconventional request. Bowing, he took  his foot from the step, saying, as she joined him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  you are the one I wanted to see; that is, to-day. Later, I hope to have the  privilege of a conversation with Mr. Brotherson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave him one quick look, trembling so that he offered her his arm with a  fatherly air.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see that you understand my errand here,&rdquo; he proceeded, with a grave smile,  meant as she knew for her encouragement. &ldquo;I am glad, because we can go at once  to the point. Miss Scott,&rdquo; he continued in a voice from which he no longer  strove to keep back the evidences of deep feeling, &ldquo;I have the strongest  interest in your patient that one man can have in another, where there is no  personal acquaintanceship. You who have every reason to understand my reasons  for this, will accept the statement, I hope, as frankly as it is made.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  nodded. Her eyes were full of tears, but she did not hesitate to raise them.  She had the greatest desire to see the face of the man who could speak like  this to-day, and yet of whose pride and sense of superiority his daughter had  stood in such awe, that she had laid a seal upon the impulses of her heart, and  imposed such tasks and weary waiting upon her lover. Doris forgot, in meeting  his softened glance and tender, almost wistful, expression, the changes which  can be made by a great grief, and only wondered why her sweet benefactress had  not taken him into her confidence and thus, possibly, averted the doom which  Doris felt had in some way grown out of this secrecy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should she have feared the disapproval of this man?&rdquo; she inwardly queried, as  she cast him a confiding look which pleased him greatly, as his tone now  showed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I lost my daughter, I lost everything,&rdquo; he declared, as they walked slowly up  the road. &ldquo;Nothing excites my interest, save that which once excited hers. I am  told that the deepest interest of her life lay here. I am also told that it was  an interest quite worthy of her. I expect to find it so. I hope with all my  heart to find it so, and that is why I have come to this town and expect to  linger till Mr. Brotherson has recovered sufficiently to see me. I hope that  this will be agreeable to him. I hope that I am not presuming too much in  cherishing these expectations.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doris  turned her candid eyes upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot tell; I do not know,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Nobody knows, not even the doctor, what  effect the news we so dread to give him will have upon Mr. Brotherson. You will  have to wait&mdash;we all shall have to wait the results of that revelation. It  cannot be kept from him much longer. When I return, I shall shrink from his  first look, in the fear of seeing it betray this dreadful knowledge. Yet I have  a faithful woman there to keep every one out of his room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have had much to carry for one so young,&rdquo; was Mr. Challoner&rsquo;s sympathetic  remark. &ldquo;You must let me help you when that awful moment comes. I am at the  hotel and shall stay there till Mr. Brotherson is pronounced quite well. I have  no other duty now in life but to sustain him through his trouble and then, with  what aid he can give, search out and find the cause of my daughter&rsquo;s death  which I will never admit without the fullest proof, to have been one of  suicide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doris  trembled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was not suicide,&rdquo; she declared, vehemently. &ldquo;I have always felt sure that it  was not; but to-day I <i>know</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  hand fell clenched on her breast and her eyes gleamed strangely. Mr. Challoner  was himself greatly startled. What had happened&mdash;what could have happened since  yesterday that she should emphasise that <i>now?</i></p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  not told any one,&rdquo; she went on, as he stopped short in the road, in his anxiety  to understand her. &ldquo;But I will tell you. Only, not here, not with all these  people driving past; most of whom know me. Come to the house later&mdash;this  evening, after Mr. Brotherson&rsquo;s room is closed for the night. I have a little  sitting-room on the other side of the hall where we can talk without being  heard. Would you object to doing that? Am I asking too much of you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  not at all,&rdquo; he assured her. &ldquo;Expect me at eight. Will that be too early?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no. Oh, how those people stared! Let us hasten back or they may connect your  name with what we want kept secret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  smiled at her fears, but gave in to her humour; he would see her soon again and  possibly learn something which would amply repay him, both for his trouble and  his patience.</p>
  <p>But  when evening came and she turned to face him in that little sitting-room where  he had quietly followed her, he was conscious of a change in her manner which  forbade these high hopes. The gleam was gone from her eyes; the tremulous  eagerness from her mobile and sensitive mouth. She had been thinking in the  hours which had passed, and had lost the confidence of that one impetuous  moment. Her greeting betrayed embarrassment and she hesitated painfully before  she spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what you will think of me,&rdquo; she ventured at last, motioning to a  chair but not sitting herself. &ldquo;You have had time to think over what I said and  probably expect something real,&mdash;something you could tell people. But it isn&rsquo;t  like that. It&rsquo;s a feeling&mdash;a belief. I&rsquo;m so sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure  of what, Miss Scott?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave a glance at the door before stepping up nearer. He had not taken the chair  she preferred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure  that I have seen the face of the man who murdered her. It was in a <i>dream</i>,&rdquo; she  whisperingly completed, her great eyes misty with awe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  dream, Miss Scott?&rdquo; He tried to hide his disappointment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I knew that it would sound foolish to you; it sounds foolish to me. But listen,  sir. Listen to what I have to tell and then you can judge. I was very much  agitated yesterday. I had to write a letter at Mr. Brotherson&rsquo;s dictation&mdash;a  letter to <i>her</i>. You can understand my horror and the effort I made to hide my  emotion. I was quite unnerved. I could not sleep till morning, and then&mdash;and  then&mdash;I saw&mdash;I hope I can describe it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Grasping  at a near-by chair, she leaned on it for support, closing her eyes to all but  that inner vision. A breathless moment followed, then she murmured in strained  monotonous tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see it again&mdash;just as I saw it in the early morning&mdash;but even more plainly, if  that is possible. A hall&mdash;(I should call it a hall, though I don&rsquo;t remember  seeing any place like it before), with a little staircase at the side, up which  there comes a man, who stops just at the top and looks intently my way. There  is fierceness in his face&mdash;a look which means no good to anybody&mdash;and as his hand  goes to his overcoat pocket, drawing out something which I cannot describe, but  which he handles as if it were a pistol, I feel a horrible fear, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; The  child was staggering, and the hand which was free had sought her heart where it  lay clenched, the knuckles showing white in the dim light.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Challoner watched her with dilated eyes, the spell under which she spoke  falling in some degree upon him. Had she finished? Was this all? No; she is  speaking again, but very low, almost in a whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is music&mdash;a crash&mdash;but I plainly see his other hand approach the object he is  holding. He takes something from the end&mdash;the object is pointed my way&mdash;I am  looking into&mdash;into&mdash;what? I do not know. I cannot even see him now. The space  where he stood is empty. Everything fades, and I wake with a loud cry in my  ears and a sense of death <i>here</i>.&rdquo; She had lifted her hand and struck at her  heart, opening her eyes as she did so. &ldquo;Yet it was not I who had been shot,&rdquo;  she added softly.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Challoner shuddered. This was like the reopening of his daughter&rsquo;s grave. But  he had entered upon the scene with a full appreciation of the ordeal awaiting  him and he did not lose his calmness, or the control of his judgment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  seated, Miss Scott,&rdquo; he entreated, taking a chair himself. &ldquo;You have described  the spot and some of the circumstances of my daughter&rsquo;s death as accurately as  if you had been there. But you have doubtless read a full account of those  details in the papers; possibly seen pictures which would make the place quite  real to you. The mind is a strange storehouse. We do not always know what lies  hidden within it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  true,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;But the man! I had never seen the man, or any picture of  him, and his face was clearest of all. I should know it if I saw it anywhere.  It is imprinted on my memory as plainly as yours. Oh, I hope never to see that  man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Challoner sighed; he had really anticipated something from the interview. The  disappointment was keen. A moment of expectation; the thrill which comes to us  all under the shadow of the supernatural, and then&mdash;this! a young and  imaginative girl&rsquo;s dream, convincing to herself but supplying nothing which had  not already been supplied both by the facts and his own imagination! A man had  stood at the staircase, and this man had raised his arm. She said that she had  seen something like a pistol in his hand, but his daughter had not been shot.  This he thought it well to point out to her.</p>
  <p>Leaning  toward her that he might get her full attention, he waited till her eyes met  his, then quietly asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you ever named this man to yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  started and dropped her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not dare to,&rdquo; said she.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I&rsquo;ve read in the papers that the man who stood there had the same name as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me, Miss Scott.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  Mr. Brotherson&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you do not think it was his brother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve  never seen his brother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  his picture?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Mr. Brotherson has none.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t  they friends? Does he never mention Orlando?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very,  very rarely. But I&rsquo;ve no reason to think they are not on good terms. I know  they correspond.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Scott?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mr. Challoner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must not rely too much upon your dream.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  eyes flashed to his and then fell again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dreams  are not revelations; they are the reproduction of what already lies hidden in  the mind. I can prove that your dream is such.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;  She looked startled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  speak of seeing something being leveled at you which made you think of a  pistol.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I was looking directly into it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  my daughter was not shot. She died from a stab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doris&rsquo;  lovely face, with its tender lines and girlish curves, took on a strange look  of conviction which deepened, rather than melted under his indulgent, but  penetrating gaze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that you think so;&mdash;but my dream says no. I saw this object. It was pointed  directly towards me&mdash;above all, I saw his face. It was the face of one whose  finger is on the trigger and who means death; <i>and I believe my dream</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Well,  it was useless to reason further. Gentle in all else, she was immovable so far  as this idea was concerned and, seeing this, he let the matter go and prepared  to take his leave.</p>
  <p>She  seemed to be quite ready for this. Anxiety about her patient had regained its  place in her mind and her glance sped constantly toward the door. Taking her  hand in his, he said some kind words, then crossed to the door and opened it.  Instantly her finger flew to her lips and, obedient to its silent injunction,  he took up his hat in silence, and was proceeding down the hall, when the bell  rang, startling them both and causing him to step quickly back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s in and visitors seldom come so late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  nodded, looking strangely troubled as the door swung open, revealing the tall,  strong figure of a man facing them from the porch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  stranger,&rdquo; formed itself upon her lips, and she was moving forward, when the  man suddenly stepped into the glare of the light, and she stopped, with a  murmur of dismay which pierced Mr. Challoner&rsquo;s heart and prepared him for the  words which now fell shudderingly from her lips:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is he! it is he! I said that I should know him wherever I saw him.&rdquo; Then with a  quiet turn towards the intruder, &ldquo;Oh, why, why, did <i>you</i> come <i>here!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_29"></a><b>Chapter 29<br>
    Do You Know My Brother</b></h2>
  <p>Her  hands were thrust out to repel, her features were fixed; her beauty something  wonderful. Orlando Brotherson, thus met, stared for a moment at the vision  before him, then slowly and with effort withdrawing his gaze, he sought the  face of Mr. Challoner with the first sign of open disturbance that gentleman  had ever seen in him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;my welcome is readily understood. I see you far from home, sir.&rdquo; And  with an ironical bow he turned again to Doris, who had dropped her hands, but  in whose cheeks the pallor still lingered in a way to check the easy flow of words  with which he might have sought to carry off the situation. &ldquo;Am I in Oswald  Brotherson&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I was directed here. But possibly there may be  some mistake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is here he lives,&rdquo; said she; moving back automatically till she stood again by  the threshold of the small room in which she had received Mr. Challoner. &ldquo;Do  you wish to see him to-night? If so, I fear it is impossible. He has been very  ill and is not allowed to receive visits from strangers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not a stranger,&rdquo; announced the newcomer, with a smile few could see unmoved,  it offered such a contrast to his stern and dominating figure. &ldquo;I thought I  heard some words of recognition which would prove your knowledge of that fact.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  did not answer. Her lips had parted, but her thought or at least the expression  of her thought hung suspended in the terror of this meeting for which she was  not at all prepared. He seemed to note this terror, whether or not he  understood its cause, and smiled again, as he added:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Brotherson must have spoken of his brother Orlando. I am he, Miss Scott. Will  you let me come in now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  eyes sought those of Mr. Challoner, who quietly nodded. Immediately she stepped  from before the door which her figure had guarded and, motioning him to enter,  she begged Mr. Challoner, with an imploring look, to sustain her in the  interview she saw before her. He had no desire for this encounter, especially  as Mr. Brotherson&rsquo;s glance in his direction had been anything but conciliatory.  He was quite convinced that nothing was to be gained by it, but he could not  resist her appeal, and followed them into the little room whose limited  dimensions made the tall Orlando look bigger and stronger and more lordly in  his self-confidence than ever.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry it is so late,&rdquo; she began, contemplating his intrusive figure with  forced composure. &ldquo;We have to be very quiet in the evenings so as not to  disturb your brother&rsquo;s first sleep which is of great importance to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;m not to see him to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  pray you to wait. He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s been a very sick man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dangerously  so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orlando  continued to regard her with a peculiar awakening gaze, showing, Mr. Challoner  thought, more interest in her than in his brother, and when he spoke it was  mechanically and as if in sole obedience to the proprieties of the occasion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not know he was ill till very lately. His last letter was a cheerful one,  and I supposed that all was right till chance revealed the truth. I came on at  once. I was intending to come anyway. I have business here, as you probably  know, Miss Scott.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  shook her head. &ldquo;I know very little about business,&rdquo; said she.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  brother has not told you why he expected me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has not even told me that he expected you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;  The word was highly expressive; there was surprise in it and a touch of wonder,  but more than all, satisfaction. &ldquo;Oswald was always close-mouthed,&rdquo; he  declared. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good fault; I&rsquo;m obliged to the boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These  last words were uttered with a lightness which imposed upon his two highly  agitated hearers, causing Mr. Challoner to frown and Doris to shrink back in  indignation at the man who could indulge in a sportive suggestion in presence  of such fears, if not of such memories, as the situation evoked. But to one who  knew the strong and self-contained man&mdash;to Sweetwater possibly, had he been  present,&mdash;there was in this very attempt&mdash;in his quiet manner and in the strange  and fitful flash of his ordinarily quick eye, that which showed he was  labouring&mdash;and had been labouring almost from his first entrance, under an excitement  of thought and feeling which in one of his powerfully organised nature must end  and that soon in an outburst of mysterious passion which would carry everything  before it. But he did not mean that it should happen here. He was too  accustomed to self-command to forget himself in this presence. He would hold  these rampant dogs in leash till the hour of solitude; then&mdash;a glittering smile  twisted his lips as he continued to gaze, first at the girl who had just  entered his life, and then at the man he had every reason to distrust, and with  that firm restraint upon himself still in full force, remarked, with a  courteous inclination:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  hour is late for further conversation. I have a room at the hotel and will  return to it at once. In the morning I hope to see my brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was going, Doris not knowing what to say, Mr. Challoner not desirous of  detaining him, when there came the sound of a little tinkle from the other side  of the hall, blanching the young girl&rsquo;s cheeks and causing Orlando Brotherson&rsquo;s  brows to rise in peculiar satisfaction.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  brother?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  came in faltering reply. &ldquo;He has heard our voices; I must go to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  that Orlando wishes him a good night,&rdquo; smiled her heart&rsquo;s enemy, with a bow of  infinite grace.</p>
  <p>She  shuddered, and was hastening from the room when her glance fell on Mr.  Challoner. He was pale and looked greatly disturbed. The prospect of being left  alone with a man whom she had herself denounced to him as his daughter&rsquo;s  murderer, might prove a tax to his strength to which she had no right to  subject him. Pausing with an appealing air, she made him a slight gesture which  he at once understood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will accompany you into the hall,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Then if anything is wrong, you  have but to speak my name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Orlando Brotherson, displeased by this move, took a step which brought him  between the two.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can hear her from here if she chooses to speak. There&rsquo;s a point to be settled  between us before either of us leaves this house, and this opportunity is as  good as another. Go to my brother, Miss Scott; we will await your return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  flash from the proud banker&rsquo;s eye; but no demur, rather a gesture of consent.  Doris, with a look of deep anxiety, sped away, and the two men stood face to  face.</p>
  <p>It  was one of those moments which men recognise as memorable. What had the one to  say or the other to hear, worthy of this preamble and the more than doubtful  relation in which they stood each to each? Mr. Challoner had more time than he  expected in which to wonder and gird himself for whatever suffering or shock  awaited him. For, Orlando Brotherson, unlike his usual self, kept him waiting  while he collected his own wits, which, strange to say, seemed to have vanished  with the girl.</p>
  <p>But  the question finally came.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Challoner, do you know my brother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have never seen him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you <i>know</i> him? Does he know you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. We are strangers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was said honestly. They did not know each other. Mr. Challoner was quite  correct in his statement.</p>
  <p>But  the other had his doubts. Why shouldn&rsquo;t he have? The coincidence of finding  this mourner if not avenger of Edith Challoner, in his own direct radius again,  at a spot so distant, so obscure and so disconnected with any apparent business  reason, was certainly startling enough unless the tie could be found in his  brother&rsquo;s name and close relationship to himself.</p>
  <p>He,  therefore, allowed himself to press the question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Men  sometimes correspond who do not know each other. You knew that a Brotherson  lived here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  hoped to learn something about me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  my interest was solely with your brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  my brother? With Oswald? What interest can you have in him apart from me?  Oswald is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Suddenly  a thought came&mdash;an unimaginable one; one with power to blanch even his hardy  cheek and shake a soul unassailable by all small emotions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oswald  Brotherson!&rdquo; he repeated; adding in unintelligible tones to himself&mdash;&ldquo;O. B. The  same initials! They are following up these initials. Poor Oswald.&rdquo; Then aloud:  &ldquo;It hardly becomes me, perhaps, to question your motives in this attempt at  making my brother&rsquo;s acquaintance. I think I can guess them; but your labour  will be wasted. Oswald&rsquo;s interests do not extend beyond this town; they hardly  extend to me. We are strangers, almost. You will learn nothing from him on the  subject which naturally engrosses you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Challoner simply bowed. &ldquo;I do not feel called upon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to explain my  reasons for wishing to know your brother. I will simply satisfy you upon a  point which may well rouse your curiosity. You remember that&mdash;that my daughter&rsquo;s  last act was the writing of a letter to a little protegee of hers. Miss Scott  was that protegee. In seeking her, I came upon him. Do you require me to say  more on this subject? Wait till I have seen Mr. Oswald Brotherson and then  perhaps I can do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Receiving  no answer to this, Mr. Challoner turned again to the man who was the object of  his deepest suspicions, to find him still in the daze of that unimaginable  thought, battling with it, scoffing at it, succumbing to it and all without a  word. Mr. Challoner was without clew to this struggle, but the might of it and  the mystery of it, drove him in extreme agitation from the room. Though proof  was lacking, though proof might never come, nothing could ever alter his belief  from this moment on that Doris was right in her estimate of this man&rsquo;s guilt,  however unsubstantial her reasoning might appear.</p>
  <p>How  far he might have been carried by this new conviction; whether he would have  left the house without seeing Doris again or exchanging another word with the  man whose very presence stifled him, he had no opportunity to show, for before  he had taken another step, he encountered the hurrying figure of Doris, who was  returning to her guests with an air of marked relief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  does not know that you are here,&rdquo; she whispered to Mr. Challoner, as she passed  him. Then, as she again confronted Orlando who hastened to dismiss his trouble  at her approach, she said quite gaily, &ldquo;Mr. Brotherson heard your voice, and is  glad to know that you&rsquo;re here. He bade me give you this key and say that you  would have found things in better shape if he had been in condition to  superintend the removal of the boxes to the place he had prepared for you  before he became ill. I was the one to do that,&rdquo; she added, controlling her  aversion with manifest effort. &ldquo;When Mr. Brotherson came to himself he asked if  I had heard about any large boxes having arrived at the station shipped to his  name. I said that several notices of such had come to the house. At which he  requested me to see that they were carried at once to the strange looking shed  he had had put up for him in the woods. I thought that they were for him, and I  saw to the thing myself. Two or three others have come since and been taken to  the same place. I think you will find nothing broken or disturbed; Mr.  Brotherson&rsquo;s wishes are usually respected.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is fortunate for me,&rdquo; was the courteous reply.</p>
  <p>But  Orlando Brotherson was not himself, not at all himself as he bowed a formal  adieu and withdrew past the drawn-up sentinel-like figure of Mr. Challoner,  without a motion on his part or on the part of that gentleman to lighten an  exit which had something in it of doom and dread presage.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_30"></a><b>Chapter 30<br>
    Chaos</b></h2>
  <p>It  is not difficult to understand Mr. Challoner&rsquo;s feelings or even those of Doris  at the moment of Mr. Brotherson&rsquo;s departure. But why this change in Brotherson  himself? Why this sense of something new and terrible rising between him and  the suddenly beclouded future? Let us follow him to his lonely hotel-room and  see if we can solve the puzzle.</p>
  <p>But  first, does he understand his own trouble? He does not seem to. For when, his  hat thrown aside, he stops, erect and frowning under the flaring gas-jet he had  no recollection of lighting, his first act was to lift his hand to his head in  a gesture of surprising helplessness for him, while snatches of broken  sentences fell from his lips among which could be heard:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  has come to me? Undone in an hour! Doubly undone! First by a face and then by  this thought which surely the devils have whispered to me. Mr. Challoner and  Oswald! What is the link between them? Great God! what is the link? Not myself?  Who then or what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Flinging  himself into a chair, he buried his face in his hands. There were two demons to  fight&mdash;the first in the guise of an angel. Doris! Unknown yesterday, unknown an  hour ago; but now! Had there ever been a day&mdash;an hour&mdash;when she had not been as  the very throb of his heart, the light of his eyes, and the crown of all  imaginable blisses?</p>
  <p>He  was startled at his own emotion as he contemplated her image in his fancy and  listened for the lost echo of the few words she had spoken&mdash;words so full of  music when they referred to his brother, so hard and cold when she simply  addressed himself.</p>
  <p>This  was no passing admiration of youth for a captivating woman. This was not even  the love he had given to Edith Challoner. This was something springing  full-born out of nothing! a force which, for the first time in his life, made  him complaisant to the natural weaknesses of man! a dream and yet a reality strong  enough to blot out the past, remake the present, change the aspect of all his  hopes, and outline a new fate. He did not know himself. There was nothing in  his whole history to give him an understanding of such feelings as these.</p>
  <p>Can  a man be seized as it were by the hair, and swung up on the slopes of paradise  or down the steeps of hell&mdash;without a forewarning, without the chance even to  say whether he wished such a cataclysm in his life or no?</p>
  <p>He,  Orlando Brotherson, had never thought much of love. Science had been his  mistress; ambition his lode-star. Such feeling as he had acknowledged to had  been for men&mdash;struggling men, men who were down-trodden and gasping in the  narrow bounds of poverty and helplessness. Miss Challoner had roused&mdash;well, his  pride. He could see that now. The might of this new emotion made plain many  things he had passed by as useless, puerile, unworthy of a man of mental  calibre and might. He had never loved Edith Challoner at any moment of their  acquaintanceship, though he had been sincere in thinking that he did. Doris&rsquo;  beauty, the hour he had just passed with her, had undeceived him.</p>
  <p>Did  he hail the experience? It was not likely to bring him joy. This young girl  whose image floated in light before his eyes, would never love him. She loved  his brother. He had heard their names mentioned together before he had been in  town an hour. Oswald, the cleverest man, Doris, the most beautiful girl in  Western Pennsylvania.</p>
  <p>He  had accepted the gossip then; he had not seen her and it all seemed very  natural;&mdash;hardly worth a moment&rsquo;s thought. But now!</p>
  <p>And  here, the other Demon sprang erect and grappled with him before the first one  had let go his hold. Oswald and Challoner! The secret, unknown something which  had softened that hard man&rsquo;s eye when his brother&rsquo;s name was mentioned! He had  noted it and realised the mystery; a mystery before which sleep and rest must  fly; a mystery to which he must now give his thought, whatever the cost,  whatever the loss to those heavenly dreams the magic of which was so new it  seemed to envelope him in the balm of Paradise. Away, then, image of light! Let  the faculties thou hast dazed, act again. There is more than Fate&rsquo;s caprice in  Challoner&rsquo;s interest in a man he never saw. Ghosts of old memories rise and  demand a hearing. Facts, trivial and commonplace enough to have been lost in  oblivion with the day which gave them birth, throng again from the past,  proving that nought dies without a possibility of resurrection. Their power  over this brooding man is shown by the force with which his fingers crush  against his bowed forehead. Oswald and Challoner! Had he found the connecting  link? Had it been&mdash;could it have been <i>Edith?</i> The preposterous is sometimes true;  could it be true in this case?</p>
  <p>He  recalled the letters read to him as hers in that room of his in Brooklyn. He  had hardly noted them then, he was so sure of their being forgeries, gotten up  by the police to mislead him. Could they have been real, the effusions of her  mind, the breathings of her heart, directed to an actual O. B., and that O. B.,  his brother? They had not been meant for him. He had read enough of the mawkish  lines to be sure of that. None of the allusions fitted in with the facts of  their mutual intercourse. But they might with those of another man; they might  with the possible acts and affections of Oswald whose temperament was wholly  different from his and who might have loved her, should it ever be shown that  they had met and known each other. And this was not an impossibility. Oswald  had been east, Oswald had even been in the Berkshires before himself.  Oswald&mdash;Why it was Oswald who had suggested that he should go there&mdash;go where she  still was. Why this second coincidence, if there were no tie&mdash;if the Challoners  and Oswald were as far apart as they seemed and as conventionalities would  naturally place them. Oswald was a sentimentalist, but very reserved about his  sentimentalities. If these suppositions were true, he had had a  sentimentalist&rsquo;s motive for what he did. As Orlando realised this, he rose from  his seat, aghast at the possibilities confronting him from this line of  thought. Should he contemplate them? Risk his reason by dwelling on a  supposition which might have no foundation in fact? No. His brain was too  full&mdash;his purposes too important for any unnecessary strain to be put upon his  faculties. No thinking! investigation first. Mr. Challoner should be able to  settle this question. He would see him. Even at this late hour he ought to be  able to find him in one of the rooms below; and, by the force of an irresistible  demand, learn in a moment whether he had to do with a mere chimera of his own  overwrought fancy, or with a fact which would call into play all the resources  of an hitherto unconquered and undaunted nature.</p>
  <p>There  was a wood-fire burning in the sitting-room that night, and around it was  grouped a number of men with their papers and pipes. Mr. Brotherson, entering,  naturally looked that way for the man he was in search of, and was disappointed  not to find him there; but on casting his glances elsewhere, he was relieved to  see him standing in one of the windows overlooking the street. His back was to  the room and he seemed to be lost in a fit of abstraction.</p>
  <p>As  Orlando crossed to him, he had time to observe how much whiter was this man&rsquo;s  head than in the last interview he had held with him in the coroner&rsquo;s office in  New York. But this evidence of grief in one with whom he had little, if  anything, in common, neither touched his feelings nor deterred his step. The  awakening of his heart to new and profound emotions had not softened him  towards the sufferings of others if those others stood without the pale he had  previously raised as the legitimate boundary of a just man&rsquo;s sympathies.</p>
  <p>He  was, as I have said, an extraordinary specimen of manly vigour in body and in  mind, and his presence in any company always attracted attention and roused, if  it never satisfied, curiosity. Conversation accordingly ceased as he strode up  to Mr. Challoner&rsquo;s side, so that his words were quite audible as he addressed  that gentleman with a somewhat curt:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see me again, Mr. Challoner. May I beg of you a few minutes&rsquo; further  conversation? I will not detain you long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  grey head turned, and the many eyes watching showed surprise at the expression  of dislike and repulsion with which this New York gentleman met the request  thus emphatically urged. But his answer was courteous enough. If Mr. Brotherson  knew a place where they would be left undisturbed, he would listen to him if he  would be very brief.</p>
  <p>For  reply, the other pointed to a small room quite unoccupied which opened out of  the one in which they then stood. Mr. Challoner bowed and in an other moment  the door closed upon them, to the infinite disappointment of the men about the  hearth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you wish to ask?&rdquo; was Mr. Challoner&rsquo;s immediate inquiry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This;  I make no apologies and expect in answer nothing more than an unequivocal yes  or no. You tell me that you have never met my brother. Can that be said of the  other members of your family&mdash;of your deceased daughter, in fact?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was acquainted with Oswald Brotherson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Without  your knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Entirely  so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Corresponded  with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  exactly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How,  not exactly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  wrote to her&mdash;occasionally. She wrote to him frequently&mdash;but she never sent her  letters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  exclamation was sharp, short and conveyed little. Yet with its escape, the  whole scaffolding of this man&rsquo;s hold upon life and his own fate went down in  indistinguishable chaos. Mr. Challoner realised a sense of havoc, though the  eyes bent upon his countenance had not wavered, nor the stalwart figure moved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have read some of those letters,&rdquo; the inventor finally acknowledged. &ldquo;The  police took great pains to place them under my eye, supposing them to have been  meant for me because of the initials written on the wrapper. But they were  meant for Oswald. You believe that now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that is why I found you in the same house with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is. Providence has robbed me of my daughter; if this brother of yours should  prove to be the man I am led to expect, I shall ask him to take that place in  my heart and life which was once hers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  quick recoil, a smothered exclamation on the part of the man he addressed. A  barb had been hidden in this simple statement which had reached some  deeply-hidden but vulnerable spot in Brotherson&rsquo;s breast, which had never been  pierced before. His eye which alone seemed alive, still rested piercingly upon  that of Mr. Challoner, but its light was fast fading, and speedily became lost  in a dimness in which the other seemed to see extinguished the last upflaring  embers of those inner fires which feed the aspiring soul. It was a sight no man  could see unmoved. Mr. Challoner turned sharply away, in dread of the abyss  which the next word he uttered might open between them.</p>
  <p>But  Orlando Brotherson possessed resources of strength of which, possibly, he was  not aware himself. When Mr. Challoner, still more affected by the silence than  by the dread I have mentioned, turned to confront him again, it was to find his  features composed and his glance clear. He had conquered all outward  manifestation of the mysterious emotion which for an instant had laid his proud  spirit low.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are considerate of my brother,&rdquo; were the words with which he re-opened this  painful conversation. &ldquo;You will not find your confidence misplaced. Oswald is a  straightforward fellow, of few faults.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe it. No man can be so universally beloved without some very substantial  claims to regard. I am glad to see that your opinion, though given somewhat coldly,  coincides with that of his friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not given to exaggeration,&rdquo; was the even reply.</p>
  <p>The  flush which had come into Mr. Challoner&rsquo;s cheek under the effort he had made to  sustain with unflinching heroism this interview with the man he looked upon as  his mortal enemy, slowly faded out till he looked the wraith of himself even to  the unsympathetic eyes of Orlando Brotherson. A duty lay before him which would  tax to its utmost extent his already greatly weakened self-control. Nothing  which had yet passed showed that this man realised the fact that Oswald had  been kept in ignorance of Miss Challoner&rsquo;s death. If these brothers were to  meet on the morrow, it must be with the full understanding that this especial  topic was to be completely avoided. But in what words could he urge such a  request upon this man? None suggested themselves, yet he had promised Miss  Scott that he would ensure his silence in this regard, and it was with this  difficulty and no other he had been struggling when Mr. Brotherson came upon  him in the other room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have still something to say,&rdquo; suggested the latter, as an oppressive silence  swallowed up that icy sentence I have already recorded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have,&rdquo; returned Mr. Challoner, regaining his courage under the exigencies of  the moment. &ldquo;Miss Scott is very anxious to have your promise that you will  avoid all disagreeable topics with your brother till the doctor pronounces him  strong enough to meet the trouble which awaits him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is not as unhappy as we. He knows nothing of the affliction which has befallen  him. He was taken ill&mdash;&rdquo; The rest was almost inaudible.</p>
  <p>But  Orlando Brotherson had no difficulty in understanding him, and for the second  time in this extraordinary interview, he gave evidences of agitation and of a  mind shaken from its equipoise. But only for an instant. He did not shun the  other&rsquo;s gaze or even maintain more than a momentary silence. Indeed, he found  strength to smile, in a curious, sardonic way, as he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think I should be apt to broach this subject with any one, let alone with  him, whose connection with it I shall need days to realise? I&rsquo;m not so given to  gossip. Besides, he and I have other topics of interest. I have an invention  ready with which I propose to experiment in a place he has already prepared for  me. <i>We can talk about that</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  irony, the hardy self-possession with which this was said struck Mr. Challoner  to the heart. Without a word he wheeled about towards the door. Without a word,  Brotherson stood, watching him go till he saw his hand fall on the knob when he  quietly prevented his exit by saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unhappy  truths cannot be long concealed. How soon does the doctor think my brother can  bear these inevitable revelations?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  said this morning that if his patient were as well to-morrow as his present  condition gives promise of, he <i>might</i> be told in another week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orlando  bowed his appreciation of this fact, but added quickly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is to do the telling?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doris.  Nobody else could be trusted with so delicate a task.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish to be present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Challoner looked up, surprised at the feeling with which this request was  charged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  his brother&mdash;his only remaining relative, I have that right. Do you think that  Dor&mdash;that Miss Scott, can be trusted not to forestall that moment by any  previous hint of what awaits him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  she so promises. But will you exact this from her? It surely cannot be  necessary for me to say that your presence will add infinitely to the  difficulty of her task.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  it is a duty I cannot shirk. I will consult the doctor about it. I will make  him see that I both understand and shall insist upon my rights in this matter.  But you may tell Miss Doris that I will sit out of sight, and that I shall not  obtrude myself unless my name is brought up in an undesirable way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  hand on the door-knob made a sudden movement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Brotherson, I can bear no more to-night. With your permission, I will leave  this question to be settled by others.&rdquo; And with a repetition of his former  bow, the bereaved father withdrew.</p>
  <p>Orlando  watched him till the door closed, then he too dropped his mask.</p>
  <p>But  it was on again, when in a little while he passed through the sitting-room on  his way upstairs.</p>
  <p>No  other day in his whole life had been like this to the hardy inventor; for in it  both his heart and his conscience had been awakened, and up to this hour he had  not really known that he possessed either.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_31"></a><b>Chapter 31<br>
    What Is He Making</b></h2>
  <p>Other  boxes addressed to O. Brotherson had been received at the station, and carried  to the mysterious shed in the woods; and now, with locked door and lifted top,  the elder brother contemplated his stores and prepared himself for work.</p>
  <p>He  had been allowed a short interview with Oswald, and he had indulged himself in  a few words with Doris. But he had left those memories behind with other and  more serious matters. Nothing that could unnerve his hand or weaken his insight  should enter this spot sacred to his great hope. Here genius reigned. Here he  was himself wholly and without flaw;&mdash;a Titan with his grasp on a mechanical  idea by means of which he would soon rule the world.</p>
  <p>Not  so happy were the other characters in this drama. Oswald&rsquo;s thoughts, disturbed  for a short time by the somewhat constrained interview he had held with his  brother, had flown eastward again, in silent love and longing; while Doris,  with a double dread now in her heart, went about her daily tasks, praying for  strength to endure the horrors of this week, without betraying the anxieties  secretly devouring her. And she was only seventeen and quite alone in her trouble.  She must bear it all unassisted and smile, which she did with heavenly  sweetness, when the magic threshold was passed and she stood in her invalid&rsquo;s  presence, overshadowed though it ever was by the great Dread.</p>
  <p>And  Mr. Challoner? Let those endless walks of his through the woods and over the  hills tell his story if they can; or his rapidly whitening hair, and lagging  step. He had been a strong man before his trouble, and had the stroke which  laid him low been limited to one quick, sharp blow he might have risen above it  after a while and been ready to encounter life again. But this long drawn out  misery was proving too much for him. The sight of Brotherson, though they never  really met, acted like acid upon a wound, and it was not till six days had  passed and the dreaded Sunday was at hand, that he slept with any sense of rest  or went his way about the town without that halting at the corners which  betrayed his perpetual apprehension of a most undesirable encounter.</p>
  <p>The  reason for this change will be apparent in the short conversation he held with  a man he had come upon one evening in the small park just beyond the workmen&rsquo;s  dwellings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see I am here,&rdquo; was the stranger&rsquo;s low greeting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  God,&rdquo; was Mr. Challoner&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;I could not have faced to-morrow alone and I  doubt if Miss Scott could have found the requisite courage. Does she know that  you are here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  stopped at her door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  that safe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so. Mr. Brotherson&mdash;the Brooklyn one,&mdash;is up in his shed. He sleeps there  now, I am told, and soundly too I&rsquo;ve no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is he making?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  half the inventors on both sides of the water are engaged upon just now. A  monoplane, or a biplane, or some machine for carrying men through the air. I  know, for I helped him with it. But you&rsquo;ll find that if he succeeds in this  undertaking, and I believe he will, nothing short of fame awaits him. His  invention has startling points. But I&rsquo;m not going to give them away. I&rsquo;ll be  true enough to him for that. As an inventor he has my sympathy; but&mdash;Well, we  will see what we shall see, to-morrow. You say that he is bound to be present  when Miss Scott relates her tragic story. He won&rsquo;t be the only unseen listener.  I&rsquo;ve made my own arrangements with Miss Scott. If he feels the need of watching  her and his brother Oswald, I feel the need of watching him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  take a burden of intolerable weight from my shoulders. Now I shall feel easier  about that interview. But I should like to ask you this: Do you feel justified  in this continued surveillance of a man who has so frequently, and with such  evident sincerity, declared his innocence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do that. If he&rsquo;s as guiltless as he says he is, my watchfulness won&rsquo;t hurt him.  If he&rsquo;s not, then, Mr. Challoner, I&rsquo;ve but one duty; to match his strength with  my patience. That man is the one great mystery of the day, and mysteries call  for solution. At least, that&rsquo;s the way a detective looks at it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  Heaven help your efforts!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall need its assistance,&rdquo; was the dry rejoinder. Sweetwater was by no means  blind to the difficulties awaiting him.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_32"></a><b>Chapter 32<br>
    Tell Me, Tell It All</b></h2>
  <p>The  day was a grey one, the first of the kind in weeks. As Doris stepped into the  room where Oswald sat, she felt how much a ray of sunshine would have  encouraged her and yet how truly these leaden skies and this dismal atmosphere  expressed the gloom which soon must fall upon this hopeful, smiling man.</p>
  <p>He  smiled because any man must smile at the entrance of so lovely a woman, but it  was an abstracted smile, and Doris, seeing it, felt her courage falter for a  moment, though her steps did not, nor her steady compassionate gaze. Advancing  slowly, and not answering because she did not hear some casual remark of his,  she took her stand by his side and then slowly and with her eyes on his face,  sank down upon her knees, still without speaking, almost without breathing.</p>
  <p>His  astonishment was evident, for her air was strange and full of presage,&mdash;as,  indeed, she had meant it to be. But he remained as silent as she, only reached  out his emaciated hand and, laying it on her head, smiled again but this time  far from abstractedly. Then, as he saw her cheeks pale in terror of the task  before her, he ventured to ask gently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the matter, child? So weary, eh? Nothing worse than that, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you quite strong this morning? Strong enough to listen to my troubles; strong  enough to bear your own if God sees fit to send them?&rdquo; came hesitatingly from  her lips as she watched the effect of each word, in breathless anxiety.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Troubles?  There can be but one trouble for me,&rdquo; was his unexpected reply. &ldquo;That I do not  fear&mdash;will not fear in my hour of happy recovery. So long as Edith is  well&mdash;Doris! Doris! You alarm me. Edith is not ill;&mdash;not ill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  poor child could not answer save with her sympathetic look and halting,  tremulous breath; and these signs, he would not, could not read, his own words  had made such an echo in his ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ill!  I cannot imagine Edith ill. I always see her in my thoughts, as I saw her on  that day of our first meeting; a perfect, animated woman with the joyous look  of a glad, harmonious nature. Nothing has ever clouded that vision. If she were  ill I would have known it. We are so truly one that&mdash;Doris, Doris, you do not  speak. You know the depth of my love, the terror of my thoughts. Is Edith ill?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  eyes gazing wildly into his, slowly left his face and raised themselves aloft,  with a sublime look. Would he understand? Yes, he understood, and the cry which  rang from his lips stopped for a moment the beating of more than one heart in  that little cottage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo;  he shrieked out, and fell back fainting in his chair, his lips still murmuring  in semi-unconsciousness, &ldquo;Dead! dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doris  sprang to her feet, thinking of nothing but his wavering, slipping life till  she saw his breath return, his eyes refill with light. Then the horror of what  was yet to come&mdash;the answer which must be given to the <i>how</i> she saw trembling on  his lips, caused her to sink again upon her knees in an unconscious appeal for  strength. If that one sad revelation had been all!</p>
  <p>But  the rest must be told; his brother exacted it and so did the situation. Further  waiting, further hiding of the truth would be insupportable after this. But oh,  the bitterness of it! No wonder that she turned away from those frenzied,  wildly-demanding eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doris?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  trembled and looked behind her. She had not recognised his voice. Had another  entered? Had his brother dared&mdash;No, they were alone; seemingly so, that is. She  knew,&mdash;no one better&mdash;that they were not really alone, that witnesses were within  hearing, if not within sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doris,&rdquo;  he urged again, and this time she turned in his direction and gazed, aghast. If  the voice were strange, what of the face which now confronted her. The ravages  of sickness had been marked, but they were nothing to those made in an instant  by a blasting grief. She was startled, although expecting much, and could only  press his hands while she waited for the question he was gathering strength to  utter. It was simple when it came; just two words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  answered them as simply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  as long as you have been ill,&rdquo; said she; then, with no attempt to break the  inevitable shock, she went on: &ldquo;Miss Challoner was struck dead and you were  taken down with typhoid on the self-same day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Struck  dead! Why do you use that word, struck? Struck dead! she, a young woman. Oh,  Doris, an accident! My darling has been killed in an accident!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  do not call it accident. They call it what it never was. <i>What it never was</i>,&rdquo;  she insisted, pressing him back with frightened hands, as he strove to rise.  &ldquo;Miss Challoner was&mdash;&rdquo; How nearly the word <i>shot</i> had left her lips. How fiercely  above all else, in that harrowing moment had risen the desire to fling the  accusation of that word into the ears of him who listened from his secret  hiding-place. But she refrained out of compassion for the man she loved, and  declared instead, &ldquo;Miss Challoner died from a wound; how given, why given, no  one knows. I had rather have died myself than have to tell you this. Oh, Mr.  Brotherson, speak, sob, do anything but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  started back, dropping his hands as she did so. With quick intuition she saw  that he must be left to himself if he were to meet this blow without  succumbing. The body must have freedom if the spirit would not go mad.  Conscious, or perhaps not conscious, of his release from her restraining hand,  albeit profiting by it, he staggered to his feet, murmuring that word of doom:  &ldquo;Wound! wound! my darling died of a wound! <i>What kind of a wound?</i>&rdquo; he suddenly  thundered out. &ldquo;I cannot understand what you mean by wound. Make it clear to  me. Make it clear to me at once. If I must bear this grief, let me know its  whole depth. Leave nothing to my imagination or I cannot answer for myself.  Tell it all, Doris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  Doris told him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was on the mezzanine floor of the hotel where she lives. She was seemingly  happy and had been writing a letter&mdash;a letter to me which they never forwarded.  There was no one else by but some strangers&mdash;good people whom one must believe.  She was crossing the floor when suddenly she threw up her hands and fell. A thin,  narrow paper-cutter was in her grasp; and it flew into the lobby. Some say she  struck herself with that cutter; for when they picked her up they found a wound  in her breast which that cutter might have made.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Edith?  never!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  words were chokingly said; he was swaying, almost falling, but he steadied  himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  says that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was the coroner&rsquo;s verdict.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she died that way&mdash;died?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Immediately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  writing to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was in that letter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  of threat, they say. Only just cheer and expressions of hope. Just like the  others, Mr. Brotherson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  they accuse her of taking her own life? Their verdict is a lie. They did not  know her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then,  after some moments of wild and confused feeling, he declared, with a desperate effort  at self-control: &ldquo;You said that some believe this. Then there must be others  who do not. What do they say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.  They simply feel as you do. They see no reason for the act and no evidence of  her having meditated it. Her father and her friend insist besides, that she was  incapable of such a horror. The mystery of it is killing us all; me above  others, for I&rsquo;ve had to show you a cheerful face, with my brain reeling and my  heart like lead in my bosom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  held out her hands. She tried to draw his attention to herself; not from any  sentiment of egotism, but to break, if she could, the strain of these  insupportable horrors where so short a time before Hope sang and Life revelled  in re-awakened joys.</p>
  <p>Perhaps  some faint realisation of this reached him, for presently he caught her by the  hands and bowed his head upon her shoulder and finally let her seat him again,  before he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  they know of&mdash;of my interest in this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  they know about the two O. B.s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  two&mdash;&rdquo; He was on his feet again, but only for a moment; his weakness was greater  than his will power.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Orlando  and Oswald Brotherson,&rdquo; she explained, in answer to his broken appeal. &ldquo;Your  brother wrote letters to her as well as you, and signed them just as you did,  with his initials only. These letters were found in her desk, and he was  supposed, for a time, to have been the author of all that were so signed. But  they found out the difference after awhile. Yours were easily recognised after  they learned there was another O. B. who loved her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  words were plain enough, but the stricken listener did not take them in. They  carried no meaning to him. How should they? The very idea she sought to impress  upon him by this seemingly careless allusion was an incredible one. She found  it her dreadful task to tell him the hard, bare truth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  brother,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;was devoted to Miss Challoner, too. He even wanted to  marry her. I cannot keep back this fact. It is known everywhere, and by  everybody but you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Orlando?&rdquo;  His lips took an ironical curve, as he uttered the word. This was a young  girl&rsquo;s imaginative fancy to him. &ldquo;Why Orlando never knew her, never saw her,  never&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  met her at Lenox.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  name produced its effect. He stared, made an effort to think, repeated <i>Lenox</i>  over to himself; then suddenly lost his hold upon the idea which that word  suggested, struggled again for it, seized it in an instant of madness and  shouted out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, I remember. I sent him there&mdash;&rdquo; and paused, his mind blank again.</p>
  <p>Poor  Doris, frightened to her very soul, looked blindly about for help; but she did  not quit his side; she did not dare to, for his lips had reopened; the  continuity of his thoughts had returned; he was going to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  sent him there.&rdquo; The words came in a sort of shout. &ldquo;I was so hungry to hear of  her and I thought he might mention her in his letter. Insane! Insane! He saw  her and&mdash;What&rsquo;s that you said about his loving her? He couldn&rsquo;t have loved her;  he&rsquo;s not of the loving sort. They&rsquo;ve deceived you with strange tales. They&rsquo;ve  deceived the whole world with fancies and mad dreams. He may have admired her,  but loved her,&mdash;no! or if he had, he would have respected my claims.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did not know them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  laugh; a laugh which paled Doris&rsquo; cheek; then his tones grew even again, memory  came back and he muttered faintly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is true. I said nothing to him. He had the right to court her&mdash;and he did, you  say; wrote to her; imposed himself upon her, drove her mad with importunities  she was forced to rebuke; and&mdash;and what else? There is something else. Tell me;  I will know it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was standing now, his feebleness all gone, passion in every lineament and his  eye alive and feverish, with emotion. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he repeated, with unrestrained  vehemence. &ldquo;Tell me all. Kill me with sorrow but save me from being unjust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  wrote her a letter; it frightened her. He followed it up by a visit&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doris  paused; the sentence hung suspended. She had heard a step&mdash;a hand on the door.</p>
  <p>Orlando  had entered the room.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_33"></a><b>Chapter 33<br>
Alone</b></h2>
  <p>Oswald  had heard nothing, seen nothing. But he took note of Doris&rsquo; silence, and  turning towards her in frenzy saw what had happened, and so was in a measure  prepared for the stern, short sentence which now rang through the room:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,  Miss Scott! you tell the story badly. Let him listen to me. From my mouth only  shall he hear the stern and seemingly unnatural part I played in this family  tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  face of Oswald hardened. Those pliant features&mdash;beloved for their gracious  kindliness&mdash;set themselves in lines which altered them almost beyond  recognition; but his voice was not without some of its natural sweetness, as,  after a long and hollow look at the other&rsquo;s composed countenance, he abruptly  exclaimed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak!  I am bound to listen; you are my brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orlando  turned towards Doris. She was slipping away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  go,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>But  she was gone.</p>
  <p>Slowly  he turned back.</p>
  <p>Oswald  raised his hand and checked the words with which he would have begun his story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind the beginnings,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Doris has told all that. You saw Miss Challoner  in Lenox&mdash;admired her&mdash;offered yourself to her and afterwards wrote her a  threatening letter because she rejected you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true. Other men have followed just such unworthy impulses&mdash;and been ashamed  and sorry afterwards. I was sorry and I was ashamed, and as soon as my first anger  was over went to tell her so. But she mistook my purpose and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orlando  hesitated. Even his iron nature trembled before the misery he saw&mdash;a misery he  was destined to augment rather than soothe. With pains altogether out of  keeping with his character, he sought in the recesses of his darkened mind for  words less bitter and less abrupt than those which sprang involuntarily to his  lips. But he did not find them. Though he pitied his brother and wished to show  that he did, nothing but the stern language suitable to the stern fact he  wished to impart, would leave his lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  ended the pitiful struggle of the moment with one quick, unpremeditated blow,&rdquo;  was what he said. &ldquo;There is no other explanation possible for this act, Oswald.  Bitter as it is for me to acknowledge it, I am thus far guilty of this beloved  woman&rsquo;s death. But, as God hears me, from the moment I first saw her, to the  moment I saw her last, I did not know, nor did I for a moment dream that she  was anything to you or to any other man of my stamp and station. I thought she  despised my country birth, my mechanical attempts, my lack of aristocratic  pretensions and traditions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Edith?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  that I know she had other reasons for her contempt&mdash;that the words she wrote  were in rebuke to the brother rather than to the man, I feel my guilt and  deplore my anger. I cannot say more. I should but insult your grief by any  lengthy expressions of regret and sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  groan of intolerable anguish from the sick man&rsquo;s lips, and then the quick  thrust of his re-awakened intelligence rising superior to the overthrow of all  his hopes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  a woman of Edith&rsquo;s principle to seek death in a moment of desperation, the  provocation must have been very great. Tell me if I&rsquo;m to hate you through  life&mdash;yea through all eternity&mdash;or if I must seek in some unimaginable failure of  my own character or conduct the cause of her intolerable despair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oswald!&rdquo;  The tone was controlling, and yet that of one strong man to another. &ldquo;Is it for  us to read the heart of any woman, least of all of a woman of her  susceptibilities and keen inner life? The wish to end all comes to some natures  like a lightning flash from a clear sky. It comes, it goes, often without  leaving a sign. But if a weapon chances to be near&mdash;(here it was in hand)&mdash;then  death follows the impulse which, given an instant of thought, would have  vanished in a back sweep of other emotions. Chance was the real accessory to  this death by suicide. Oswald, let us realise it as such and accept our sorrow  as a mutual burden and turn to what remains to us of life and labour. Work is  grief&rsquo;s only consolation. Then let us work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  of all this Oswald had caught but the one word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chance?&rdquo;  he repeated. &ldquo;Orlando, I believe in God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  seek your comfort there. I find it in harnessing the winds; in forcing the  powers of nature to do my bidding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  other did not speak, and the silence grew heavy. It was broken, when it was  broken, by a cry from Oswald:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  more,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;no more.&rdquo; Then, in a yearning accent, &ldquo;Send Doris to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orlando  started. This name coming so close upon that word comfort produced a strange  effect upon him. But another look at Oswald and he was ready to do his bidding.  The bitter ordeal was over; let him have his solace if it was in her power to  give it to him.</p>
  <p>Orlando,  upon leaving his brother&rsquo;s room, did not stop to deliver that brother&rsquo;s message  directly to Doris; he left this for Truda to do, and retired immediately to his  hangar in the woods. Locking himself in, he slightly raised the roof and then  sat down before the car which was rapidly taking on shape and assuming that  individuality and appearance of sentient life which hitherto he had only seen  in dreams. But his eye, which had never failed to kindle at this sight before,  shone dully in the semi-gloom. The air-car could wait; he would first have his  hour in this solitude of his own making. The gaze he dreaded, the words from  which he shrank could not penetrate here. He might even shout her name aloud,  and only these windowless walls would respond. He was alone with his past, his  present and his future.</p>
  <p>Alone!</p>
  <p>He  needed to be. The strongest must pause when the precipice yawns before him. The  gulf can be spanned; he feels himself forceful enough for that; but his eyes  must take their measurement of it first; he must know its depths and possible  dangers. Only a fool would ignore these steeps of jagged rock; and he was no  fool, only a man to whom the unexpected had happened, a man who had seen his  way clear to the horizon and then had come up against this! Love, when he  thought such folly dead! Remorse, when Glory called for the quiet mind and  heart!</p>
  <p>He  recognised its mordant fang, and knew that its ravages, though only just begun,  would last his lifetime. Nothing could stop them now, nothing, nothing. And he  laughed, as the thought went home; laughed at the irony of fate and its  inexorableness; laughed at his own defeat and his nearness to a barred  Paradise. Oswald loved Edith, loved her yet, with a flame time would take long  to quench. Doris loved Oswald and he Doris; and not one of them would ever  attain the delights each was so fitted to enjoy. Why shouldn&rsquo;t he laugh? What  is left to man but mockery when all props fall? Disappointment was the  universal lot; and it should go merrily with him if he must take his turn at  it. But here the strong spirit of the man re-asserted itself; it should be but  a turn. A man&rsquo;s joys are not bounded by his loves or even by the satisfaction  of a perfectly untrammelled mind. Performance makes a world of its own for the  capable and the strong, and this was still left to him. He, Orlando Brotherson,  despair while his great work lay unfinished! That would be to lay stress on the  inevitable pains and fears of commonplace humanity. He was not of that ilk.  Intellect was his god; ambition his motive power. What would this casual blight  upon his supreme contentment be to him, when with the wings of his air-car  spread, he should spurn the earth and soar into the heaven of fame  simultaneously with his flight into the open.</p>
  <p>He  could wait for that hour. He had measured the gulf before him and found it  passable. Henceforth no looking back.</p>
  <p>Rising,  he stood for a moment gazing, with an alert eye now, upon such sections of his  car as had not yet been fitted into their places; then he bent forward to his  work, and soon the lips which had uttered that sardonic laugh a few minutes  before, parted in gentler fashion, and song took the place of curses&mdash;a ballad  of love and fondest truth. But Orlando never knew what he sang. He had the gift  and used it.</p>
  <p>Would  his tones, however, have rung out with quite so mellow a sweetness had he seen  the restless figure even then circling his retreat with eyes darting accusation  and arms lifted towards him in wild but impotent threat?</p>
  <p>Yes,  I think they would; for he knew that the man who thus expressed his  helplessness along with his convictions, was no nearer the end he had set  himself to attain than on the day he first betrayed his suspicions.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_34"></a><b>Chapter 34<br>
    The Hut Changes Its Name</b></h2>
  <p>That  night Oswald was taken very ill. For three days his life hung in the balance,  then youth and healthy living triumphed over shock and bereavement, and he came  slowly back to his sad and crippled existence.</p>
  <p>He  had been conscious for a week or more of his surroundings, and of his bitter  sorrows as well, when one morning he asked Doris whose face it was he had seen  bending over him so often during the last week: &ldquo;Have you a new doctor? A man  with white hair and a comforting smile? Or have I dreamed this face? I have had  so many fancies this might easily be one of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  it is not a fancy,&rdquo; was the quiet reply. &ldquo;Nor is it the face of a doctor. It is  that of friend. One whose heart is bound up in your recovery; one for whom you  must live, Mr. Brotherson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know him, Doris. It&rsquo;s a strange face to me. And yet, it&rsquo;s not altogether  strange. Who is this man and why should he care for me so deeply?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  you share one love and one grief. It is Edith&rsquo;s father whom you see at your  bedside. He has helped to nurse you ever since you came down this second time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Edith&rsquo;s  father! Doris, it cannot be. <i>Edith&rsquo;s father!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Mr. Challoner has been in Derby for the last two weeks. He has only one  interest now; to see you well again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doris  caught the note of pain, if not suspicion, in this query, and smiled as she  asked in turn:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  he answer that question himself? He is waiting to come in. Not to talk. You  need not fear his talking. He&rsquo;s as quiet as any man I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sick man closed his eyes, and Doris watching, saw the flush rise to his  emaciated cheek, then slowly fade away again to a pallor that frightened her.  Had she injured where she would heal? Had she pressed too suddenly and too hard  on the ever gaping wound in her invalid&rsquo;s breast? She gasped in terror at the  thought, then she faintly smiled, for his eyes had opened again and showed a  calm determination as he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like to see him. I should like him to answer the question I have just  put you. I should rest easier and get well faster&mdash;or not get well at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  latter he half whispered, and Doris, tripping from the room may not have heard  it, for her face showed no further shadow as she ushered in Mr. Challoner, and  closed the door behind him. She had looked forward to this moment for days. To  Oswald, however, it was an unexpected excitement and his voice trembled with  something more than physical weakness as he greeted his visitor and thanked him  for his attentions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doris  says that you have shown me this kindness from the desire you have to see me  well again Mr. Challoner. Is this true?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  true. I cannot emphasise the fact too strongly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Oswald&rsquo;s  eyes met his again, this time with great earnestness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must have serious reasons for feeling so&mdash;reasons which I do not quite  understand. May I ask why you place such value upon a life which, if ever  useful to itself or others, has lost and lost forever, the one delight which  gave it meaning?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was for Mr. Challoner&rsquo;s voice to tremble now, as reaching out his hand, he  declared, with unmistakable feeling:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no son. I have no interest left in life, outside this room and the  possibilities it contains for me. Your attachment to my daughter has created a  bond between us, Mr. Brotherson, which I sincerely hope to see recognised by  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Startled  and deeply moved, the young man stretched out a shaking hand towards his  visitor, with the feeble but exulting cry:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you do not blame me for her wretched and mysterious death. You hold me  guiltless of the misery which nerved her despairing arm?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  guiltless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Oswald&rsquo;s  wan and pinched features took on a beautiful expression and Mr. Challoner no  longer wondered at his daughter&rsquo;s choice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  God!&rdquo; fell from the sick man&rsquo;s lips, and then there was a silence during which  their two hands met.</p>
  <p>It  was some minutes before either spoke and then it was Oswald who said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must confide to you certain facts. I honoured your daughter and realised her  position fully. Our plight was never made in words, nor should I have presumed  to advance any claim to her hand if I had not made good my expectations, Mr.  Challoner. I meant to win both her regard and yours by acts, not words. I felt  that I had a great deal to do and I was prepared to work and wait. I loved  her&mdash;&rdquo; He turned away his head and the silence which filled up the gap, united  those two hearts, as the old and young are seldom united.</p>
  <p>But  when a little later, Mr. Challoner rejoined Doris, in her little sitting-room,  he nevertheless showed a perplexity she had hoped to see removed by this  understanding with the younger Brotherson.</p>
  <p>The  cause became apparent as soon as he spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These  brothers hold by each other,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Oswald will hear nothing against  Orlando. He says that he has redeemed his fault. He does not even protest that  his brother&rsquo;s word is to be believed in this matter. He does not seem to think  that necessary. He evidently regards Orlando&rsquo;s personality as speaking as truly  and satisfactorily for itself, as his own does. And I dared not undeceive him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  does not know all our reasons for distrust. He has heard nothing about the poor  washerwoman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  and he must not,&mdash;not for weeks. He has borne all that he can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  confidence in his older brother is sublime. I do not share it; but I cannot  help but respect him for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was warmly said, and Mr. Challoner could not forbear casting an anxious look at  her upturned face. What he saw there made him turn away with a sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  confidence has for me a very unhappy side,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;It shows me Oswald&rsquo;s  thought. He who loved her best, accepts the cruel verdict of an unreasoning  public.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doris&rsquo;  large eyes burned with a weird light upon his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has not had my dream,&rdquo; she murmured, with all the quiet of an unmoved  conviction.</p>
  <p>Yet  as the days went by, even her manner changed towards the busy inventor. It was  hardly possible for it not to. The high stand he took; the regard accorded him  on every side; his talent; his conversation, which was an education in itself,  and, above all, his absorption in a work daily advancing towards completion,  removed him so insensibly and yet so decidedly, from the hideous past of  tragedy with which his name, if not his honour, was associated, that,  unconsciously to herself, she gradually lost her icy air of repulsion and lent  him a more or less attentive ear, when he chose to join their small company of  an evening. The result was that he turned so bright a side upon her that  toleration merged from day to day into admiration and memory lost itself in  anticipation of the event which was to prove him a man of men, if not one of  the world&rsquo;s greatest mechanical geniuses.</p>
  <p>Meantime,  Oswald was steadily improving in health, if not in spirits. He had taken his  first walk without any unfavourable results, and Orlando decided from this that  the time had come for an explanation of his device and his requirements in  regard to it. Seated together in Oswald&rsquo;s room, he broached the subject thus:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oswald,  what is your idea about what I&rsquo;m making up there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  it will be a success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know; but its character, its use? What do you think it is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  an idea; but my idea don&rsquo;t fit the conditions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s  that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  shed is too closely hemmed in. You haven&rsquo;t room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  start an aeroplane.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  it is certainly a device for flying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  supposed so; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is an air-car with a new and valuable idea&mdash;the idea for which the whole world  has been seeking ever since the first aeroplane found its way up from the  earth. My car needs no room to start in save that which it occupies. If it did,  it would be but the modification of a hundred others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Orlando!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Oswald thus gave expression to his surprise, their two faces were a study: the  fire of genius in the one; the light of sympathetic understanding in the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  this car, now within three days of its completion,&rdquo; Orlando proceeded, &ldquo;does  not rise from the oval of my hangar like a bird from its nest, and after a wide  and circling flight descend again into the self same spot without any swerving  from its direct course, then have I failed in my endeavour and must take a back  seat with the rest. But it will not fail. I&rsquo;m certain of success, Oswald. All I  want just now is a sympathetic helper&mdash;you, for instance; someone who will aid  me with the final fittings and hold his peace to all eternity if the impossible  occurs and the thing proves a failure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you such pride as that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  much that you cannot face failure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  when attached to my name. You can see how I feel about that by the secrecy I  have worked under. No other person living knows what I have just communicated  to you. Every part shipped here came from different manufacturing firms;  sometimes a part of a part was all I allowed to be made in any one place. My  fame, like my ship, must rise with one bound into the air, or it must never  rise at all. It was not made for petty accomplishment, or the slow plodding of  commonplace minds. I must startle, or remain obscure. That is why I chose this  place for my venture, and you for my helper and associate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  want me to ascend with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  the end of three days?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Orlando,  I cannot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  cannot? Not strong enough yet? I&rsquo;ll wait then,&mdash;three days more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  time&rsquo;s too short. A month is scarcely sufficient. It would be folly, such as  you never show, to trust a nerve so undermined as mine till time has restored  its power. For an enterprise like this you need a man of ready strength and  resources; not one whose condition you might be obliged to consider at a very  critical moment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orlando,  balked thus at the outset, showed his displeasure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not do justice to your will. It is strong enough to carry you through  anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can force it to act for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear not, Orlando.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  counted on you and you thwart me at the most critical moment of my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Oswald  smiled; his whole candid and generous nature bursting into view, in one quick  flash.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  he assented; &ldquo;but you will thank me when you realise my weakness. Another man  must be found&mdash;quick, deft, secret, yet honourably alive to the importance of  the occasion and your rights as a great original thinker and mechanician.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know such a man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t; but there must be many such among our workmen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  isn&rsquo;t one; and I haven&rsquo;t time to send to Brooklyn. I reckoned on you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you wait a month?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  fortnight, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  not ten days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Oswald  looked surprised. He would like to have asked why such precipitation was  necessary, but the tone in which this ultimatum was given was of that decisive  character which admits of no argument. He, therefore, merely looked his query.  But Orlando was not one to answer looks; besides, he had no reply for the same  importunate question urged by his own good sense. He knew that he must make the  attempt upon which his future rested soon, and without risk of the sapping  influence of lengthened suspense and weeks of waiting. He could hold on to  those two demons leagued in attack against him, for a definite seven days, but  not for an indeterminate time. If he were to be saved from folly,&mdash;from  himself&mdash;events must rush.</p>
  <p>He,  therefore, repeated his no, with increased vehemence, adding, as he marked the  reproach in his brother&rsquo;s eye, &ldquo;I cannot wait. The test must be made on  Saturday evening next, whatever the conditions; whatever the weather. An  air-car to be serviceable must be ready to meet lightning and tempest, and what  is worse, perhaps, an insufficient crew.&rdquo; Then rising, he exclaimed, with a  determination which rendered him majestic, &ldquo;<i>If help is not forthcoming, I&rsquo;ll do  it all myself</i>. Nothing shall hold me back; nothing shall stop me; and when you  see me and my car rise above the treetops, you&rsquo;ll feel that I have done what I  could to make you forget&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did not need to continue. Oswald understood and flashed a grateful look his way  before saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will make the attempt at night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  on Saturday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  said it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will run over in my mind the qualifications of such men as I know and acquaint  you with the result to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are adjustments to be made. A man of accuracy is necessary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he must be likable. I can do nothing with a man with whom I&rsquo;m not perfectly in  accord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-night  then.&rdquo; A moment of hesitancy, then, &ldquo;I wish not only yourself but Miss Scott to  be present at this test. Prepare her for the spectacle; but not yet, not till  within an hour or two of the occasion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  with a proud smile in which flashed a significance which startled Oswald, he  gave a hurried nod and turned away.</p>
  <p>When  in an hour afterwards, Doris looked in through the open door, she found Oswald  sitting with face buried in his hands, thinking so deeply that he did not hear  her. He had sat like this, immovable and absorbed, ever since his brother had  left him.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_35"></a><b>Chapter 35<br>
    Silence&mdash;And A Knock</b></h2>
  <p>Oswald  did not succeed in finding a man to please Orlando. He suggested one person  after another to the exacting inventor, but none were satisfactory to him and  each in turn was turned down. It is not every one we want to have share a  world-wide triumph or an ignominious defeat. And the days were passing.</p>
  <p>He  had said in a moment of elation, &ldquo;<i>I will do it alone;</i>&rdquo; but he knew even then  that he could not. Two hands were necessary to start the car; afterwards, he  might manage it alone. Descent was even possible, but to give the contrivance  its first lift required a second mechanician. Where was he to find one to  please him? And what was he to do if he did not? Conquer his prejudices against  such men as he had seen, or delay the attempt, as Oswald had suggested, till he  could get one of his old cronies on from New York. He could do neither. The  obstinacy of his nature was such as to offer an invincible barrier against  either suggestion. One alternative remained. He had heard of women aviators. If  Doris could be induced to accompany him into the air, instead of clinging  sodden-like to the weight of Oswald&rsquo;s woe, then would the world behold a  triumph which would dwarf the ecstasy of the bird&rsquo;s flight and rob the eagle of  his kingly pride. But Doris barely endured him as yet, and the thought was not  one to be considered for a moment. Yet what other course remained? He was  brooding deeply on the subject, in his hangar one evening&mdash;(it was Thursday and  Saturday was but two days off) when there came a light knock at the door.</p>
  <p>This  had never occurred before. He had given strict orders, backed by his brother&rsquo;s  authority, that he was never to be intruded upon when in this place; and though  he had sometimes encountered the prying eyes of the curious flashing from  behind the trees encircling the hangar, his door had never been approached  before, or his privacy encroached upon. He started then, when this low but  penetrating sound struck across the turmoil of his thoughts, and cast one look  in the direction from which it came; but he did not rise, or even change his  position on his workman&rsquo;s stool.</p>
  <p>Then  it came again, still low but with an insistence which drew his brows together  and made his hand fall from the wire he had been unconsciously holding through  the mental debate which was absorbing him. Still he made no response, and the  knocking continued. Should he ignore it entirely, start up his motor and render  himself oblivious to all other sounds? At every other point in his career he  would have done this, but an unknown, and as yet unnamed, something had entered  his heart during this fatal month, which made old ways impossible and oblivion  a thing he dared not court too recklessly. Should this be a summons from Doris!  Should (inconceivable idea, yet it seized upon him relentlessly and would not  yield for the asking) should it be Doris herself!</p>
  <p>Taking  advantage of a momentary cessation of the ceaseless tap tap, he listened.  Silence was never profounder than in this forest on that windless night. Earth  and air seemed, to his strained ear, emptied of all sound. The clatter of his  own steady, unhastened heart-beat was all that broke upon the stillness. He  might be alone in the Universe for all token of life beyond these walls, or so  he was saying to himself, when sharp, quick, sinister, the knocking  recommenced, demanding admission, insisting upon attention, drawing him against  his own will to his feet, and finally, though he made more than one stand  against it, to the very door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s  there?&rdquo; he asked, imperiously and with some show of anger.</p>
  <p>No  answer, but another quiet knock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak!  or go from my door. No one has the right to intrude here. What is your name and  business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Continued  knocking&mdash;nothing more.</p>
  <p>With  an outburst of wrath, which made the hangar ring, Orlando lifted his fist to  answer this appeal in his own fierce fashion from his own side of the door, but  the impulse paused at fulfilment, and he let his arm fall again in a rush of  self-hatred which it would have pained his worst enemy, even little Doris, to  witness. As it reached his side, the knock came again.</p>
  <p>It  was too much. With an oath, Orlando reached for his key. But before fitting it  into the lock, he cast a look behind him. The car was in plain sight, filling  the central space from floor to roof. A single glance from a stranger&rsquo;s eye,  and its principal secret would be a secret no longer. He must not run such a  risk. Before he answered this call, he must drop the curtain he had rigged up  against such emergencies as these. He had but to pull a cord and a veil would  fall before his treasure, concealing it as effectually as an Eastern bride is  concealed behind her yashmak.</p>
  <p>Stepping  to the wall, he drew that cord, then with an impatient sigh, returned to the  door.</p>
  <p>Another  quiet but insistent knock greeted him. In no fury now, but with a vague sense  of portent which gave an aspect of farewell to the one quick glance he cast  about the well-known spot, he fitted the key in the lock, and stood ready to  turn it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ask again your name and your business,&rdquo; he shouted out in loud command. &ldquo;Tell  them or&mdash;&rdquo; He meant to say, &ldquo;or I do not turn this key.&rdquo; But something withheld  the threat. He knew that it would perish in the utterance; that he could not  carry it out. He would have to open the door now, response or no response.  &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; was the word with which he finished his demand.</p>
  <p>A  final knock.</p>
  <p>Pulling  a pistol from his pocket, with his left hand, he turned the key with his right.</p>
  <p>The  door remained unopened.</p>
  <p>Stepping  slowly back, he stared at its unpainted boards for a moment, then he spoke up  quietly, almost courteously:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the command passed unheeded; the latch was not raised, and only the slightest  tap was heard.</p>
  <p>With  a bound he reached forward and pulled the door open. Then a great silence fell  upon him and a rigidity as of the grave seized and stiffened his powerful  frame.</p>
  <p>The  man confronting him from the darkness was <i>Sweetwater</i>.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_36"></a><b>Chapter 36<br>
    The Man Within And The Man Without</b></h2>
  <p>An  instant of silence, during which the two men eyed each other; then, Sweetwater,  with an ironical smile directed towards the pistol lightly remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Challoner and other men at the hotel are acquainted with my purpose and await  my return. I have come&mdash;&rdquo; here he cast a glowing look at the huge curtain  cutting off the greater portion of the illy-lit interior&mdash;&ldquo;to offer you my  services, Mr. Brotherson. I have no other motive for this intrusion than to be  of use. I am deeply interested in your invention, to the development of which I  have already lent some aid, and can bring to the test you propose a sympathetic  help which you could hardly find in any other person living.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  silence which settled down at the completion of these words had a weight which  made that of the previous moment seem light and all athrob with sound. The man  within had not yet caught his breath; the man without held his, in an anxiety  which had little to do with the direction of the weapon, into which he looked.  Then an owl hooted far away in the forest, and Orlando, slowly lowering his  arm, asked in an oddly constrained tone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  long have you been in town?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  answer cut clean through any lingering hope he may have had.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ever  since the day your brother was told the story of his great misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  still at your old tricks! I thought you had quit that business as  unprofitable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. I never expect quick returns. He who holds on for a rise sometimes  reaps unlooked-for profits.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  arm and fist of Orlando Brotherson ached to hurl this fellow back into the  heart of the midnight woods.</p>
  <p>But  they remained quiescent and he spoke instead. &ldquo;I have buried the business. You  will never resuscitate it through me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  smiled. There was no mirth in his smile though there was lightness in his tone  as said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  let us go back to the matter in hand. You need a helper; where are you going to  find one if you don&rsquo;t take me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  growl from Brotherson&rsquo;s set lips. Never had he looked more dangerous than in  the one burning instant following this daring repetition of the detective&rsquo;s  outrageous request. But as he noted how slight was the figure opposing him from  the other side of the threshold, he was swayed by his natural admiration of  pluck in the physically weak, and lost his threatening attitude, only to assume  one which Sweetwater secretly found it even harder to meet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a fool,&rdquo; was the stinging remark he heard flung at him. &ldquo;Do you want to  play the police-officer here and arrest me in mid air?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Brotherson, you understand me as little as I am supposed to understand you.  Humble as my place is in society and, I may add, in the Department whose  interests I serve, there are in me two men. One you know passably well&mdash;the  detective whose methods, only indifferently clever show that he has very much  to learn. Of the other&mdash;the workman acquainted with hammer and saw, but with  some knowledge too of higher mathematics and the principles upon which great  mechanical inventions depend, you know little, and must imagine much. I was  playing the gawky when I helped you in the old house in Brooklyn. I was  interested in your air-ship&mdash;Oh, I recognised it for what it was,  notwithstanding its oddity and lack of ostensible means for flying&mdash;but I was  not caught in the whirl of its idea; the idea by which you doubtless expect,  and with very good reason too, to revolutionise the science of aviation. But  since then I&rsquo;ve been thinking it over, and am so filled with your own hopes that  either I must have a hand in the finishing and sailing of the one you have  yourself constructed, or go to work myself on the hints you have unconsciously  given me, and make a car of my own.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Audacity  often succeeds where subtler means fail. Orlando, with a curious twist of his  strong lip, took hold of the detective&rsquo;s arm and drew him in, shutting and  locking the door carefully behind him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;you shall tell me what you think you have discovered, to make any  ideas of your own available in the manufacture of a superior self-propelling  air-ship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  who had been so violently wheeled about in entering that he stood with his back  to the curtain concealing the car, answered without hesitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have a device, entirely new so far as I can judge, by which this car can leap  at once into space, hold its own in any direction, and alight again upon any  given spot without shock to the machine or danger to the people controlling  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Explain  the device.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will draw it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  I see it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  <i>you</i> see it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  It&rsquo;s a brilliant idea; I could never have conceived it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  believe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit  here. Let&rsquo;s <i>see</i> what you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  sat down at the table the other pointed out, and drawing forward a piece of  paper, took up a pencil with an easy air. Brotherson approached and stood at  his shoulder. He had taken up his pistol again, why he hardly knew, and as  Sweetwater began his marks, his fingers tightened on its butt till they turned  white in the murky lamplight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see,&rdquo; came in easy tones from the stooping draughtsman, &ldquo;I have an imagination  which only needs a slight fillip from a mind like yours to send it in the  desired direction. I shall not draw an exact reproduction of your idea, but I  think you will see that I understand it very well. How&rsquo;s that for a start?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brotherson  looked and hastily drew back. He did not want the other to note his surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  that is a portion you never saw,&rdquo; he loudly declared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  but I saw this,&rdquo; returned Sweetwater, working busily on some curves; &ldquo;and these  gave me the fillip I mentioned. The rest came easily.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brotherson,  in dread of his own anger, threw his pistol to the other end of the shed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  knave! You thief!&rdquo; he furiously cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  so?&rdquo; asked Sweetwater smilingly, rising and looking him calmly in the face. &ldquo;A  thief is one who appropriates another man&rsquo;s goods, or, let us say, another  man&rsquo;s ideas. I have appropriated nothing yet. I&rsquo;ve only shown you how easily I  could do so. Mr. Brotherson, take me in as your assistant. I will be faithful  to you, I swear it. I want to see that machine go up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  how many people have you drawn those lines?&rdquo; thundered the inexorable voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  nobody; not for myself even. This is the first time they have left their  hiding-place in my brain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you swear to that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can and will, if you require it. But you ought to believe my word, sir. I am  square as a die in all matters not connected&mdash;well, not connected with my  profession,&rdquo; he smiled in a burst of that whimsical humour, which not even the  seriousness of the moment could quite suppress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what surety have I that you do not consider this very matter of mine as coming  within the bounds you speak of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None.  But you must trust me that far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brotherson  surveyed him with an irony which conveyed a very different message to the  detective than any he had intended. Then quickly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  how many have you spoken, dilating upon this device, and publishing abroad my  secret?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have spoken to no one, not even to Mr. Gryce. That shows my honesty as nothing  else can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have kept my secret intact?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Entirely  so, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  that no one, here or elsewhere, shares our knowledge of the new points in this  mechanism?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say so, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  if I should kill you,&rdquo; came in ferocious accents, &ldquo;now&mdash;here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would be the <i>only</i> one to own that knowledge. But you won&rsquo;t kill me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Need  I go into reasons?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?  I say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  your conscience is already too heavily laden to bear the burden of another  unprovoked crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brotherson,  starting back, glared with open ferocity upon the man who dared to face him  with such an accusation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God!  why didn&rsquo;t I shoot you on entrance!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Your courage is certainly  colossal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  fine smile, without even the hint of humour now, touched the daring detective&rsquo;s  lip. Brotherson&rsquo;s anger seemed to grow under it, and he loudly repeated:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  more than colossal; it&rsquo;s abnormal and&mdash;&rdquo; A moment&rsquo;s pause, then with ironic  pauses&mdash;&ldquo;and quite unnecessary save as a matter of display, unless you think you  need it to sustain you through the ordeal you are courting. You wish to help me  finish and prepare for flight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  sincerely do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  consider yourself competent?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brotherson&rsquo;s  eyes fell and he walked once to the extremity of the oval flooring and back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  we will grant that. But that&rsquo;s not all that is necessary. My requirements  demand a companion in my first flight. Will you go up in the car with me on  Saturday night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  quick affirmative was on Sweetwater&rsquo;s lips but the glimpse which he got of the  speaker&rsquo;s face glowering upon him from the shadows into which Brotherson had  withdrawn, stopped its utterance, and the silence grew heavy. Though it may not  have lasted long by the clock, the instant of breathless contemplation of each  other&rsquo;s features across the intervening space was of incalculable moment to  Sweetwater, and, possibly, to Brotherson. As drowning men are said to live over  their whole history between their first plunge and their final rise to light  and air, so through the mind of the detective rushed the memories of his past and  the fast fading glories of his future; and rebelling at the subtle peril he saw  in that sardonic eye, he vociferated an impulsive:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  I&rsquo;ll not&mdash;&rdquo; and paused, caught by a new and irresistible sensation.</p>
  <p>A  breath of wind&mdash;the first he had felt that night&mdash;had swept in through some  crevice in the curving wall, flapping the canvas enveloping the great car. It  acted like a peal to battle. After all, a man must take some risks in his life,  and his heart was in this trial of a redoubtable mechanism in which he had full  faith. He could not say no to the prospect of being the first to share a  triumph which would send his name to the ends of the earth; and, changing the  trend of his sentence, he repeated with a calmness which had the force of a  great decision.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will not fail you in anything. If she rises&mdash;&rdquo; here his trembling hand fell on  the curtain shutting off his view of the ship, &ldquo;she shall take me with her, so  that when she descends I may be the first to congratulate the proud inventor of  such a marvel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  be it!&rdquo; shot from the other&rsquo;s lips, his eyes losing their threatening look, and  his whole countenance suddenly aglow with the enthusiasm of awakened genius.</p>
  <p>Coming  from the shadows, he laid his hand on the cord regulating the rise and fall of  the concealing curtain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  she is!&rdquo; he cried and drew the cord.</p>
  <p>The  canvas shook, gathered itself into great folds and disappeared in the shadows  from which he had just stepped.</p>
  <p>The  air-car stood revealed&mdash;a startling, because wholly unique, vision.</p>
  <p>Long  did Sweetwater survey it, then turning with beaming face upon the watchful  inventor, he uttered a loud Hurrah.</p>
  <p>Next  moment, with everything forgotten between them save the glories of this  invention, both dropped simultaneously to the floor and began that minute  examination of the mechanism necessary to their mutual work.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_37"></a><b>Chapter 37<br>
His Great Hour</b></h2>
  <p>Saturday night at eight  o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>So  the fiat had gone forth, with no concession to be made on account of weather.</p>
  <p>As  Oswald came from his supper and took a look at the heavens from the small front  porch, he was deeply troubled that Orlando had remained so obstinate on this  point. For there were ominous clouds rolling up from the east, and the storms  in this region of high mountains and abrupt valleys were not light, nor without  danger even to those with feet well planted upon mother earth.</p>
  <p>If  the tempest should come up before eight!</p>
  <p>Mr.  Challoner, who, from some mysterious impulse of bravado on the part of  Brotherson, was to be allowed to make the third in this small band of spectators,  was equally concerned at this sight, but not for Brotherson. His fears were for  Oswald, whose slowly gathering strength could illy bear the strain which this  additional anxiety for his brother&rsquo;s life must impose upon him. As for Doris,  she was in a state of excitement more connected with the past than with the  future. That afternoon she had laid her hand in that of Orlando Brotherson, and  wished him well. She! in whose breast still lingered reminiscences of those old  doubts which had beclouded his image for her at their first meeting. She had  not been able to avoid it. His look was a compelling one, and it had demanded  thus much from her; and&mdash;a terrible thought to her gentle spirit&mdash;he might be  going to his death!</p>
  <p>It  had been settled by the prospective aviator that they were to watch for the  ascent from the mouth of the grassy road leading in to the hangar. The three  were to meet there at a quarter to eight and await the stroke and the air-cars  rise. That time was near, and Mr. Challoner, catching a glimpse of Oswald&rsquo;s  pallid and unnaturally drawn features, as he set down the lantern he carried,  shuddered with foreboding and wished the hour passed.</p>
  <p>Doris&rsquo;  watchful glance never left the face whose lightest change was more to her than  all Orlando&rsquo;s hopes. But the result upon her was not to weaken her resolution,  but to strengthen it. Whatever the outcome of the next few minutes, she must  stand ready to sustain her invalid through it. That the darkness of early  evening had deepened to oppression, was unnoticed for the moment. The fears of  an hour past had been forgotten. Their attention was too absorbed in what was  going on before them, for even a glance overhead.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  Mr. Challoner spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is the man whom Mr. Brotherson has asked to go up with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Oswald who answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has never told me. He has kept his own counsel about that as about everything  else connected with this matter. He simply advised me that I was not to bother  about him any more; that he had found the assistant he wanted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  reticence seems unpardonable. You have&mdash;displayed great patience, Oswald.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I understand Orlando. He reads men&rsquo;s natures like a book. The man he trusts, we  may trust. To-morrow, he will speak openly enough. All cause for reticence will  be gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have confidence then in the success of this undertaking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I hadn&rsquo;t, I should not be here. I could hardly bear to witness his failure,  even in a secret test like this. I should find it too hard to face him  afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Orlando  has great pride. If this enterprise fails I cannot answer for him. He would be  capable of anything. Why, Doris! what is the matter, child? I never saw you  look like that before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  had been down on her knees regulating the lantern, and the sudden flame,  shooting up, had shown him her face turned up towards his in an apprehension  which verged on horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  I look frightened?&rdquo; she asked, remembering herself and lightly rising. &ldquo;I  believe that I am a little frightened. If&mdash;if anything should go wrong! If an  accident-&rdquo; But here she remembered herself again and quickly changed her tone.  &ldquo;But your confidence shall be mine. I will believe in his good angel or&mdash;or in  his self-command and great resolution. I&rsquo;ll not be frightened any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Oswald did not seem satisfied. He continued to look at her in vague concern.</p>
  <p>He  hardly knew what to make of the intense feeling she had manifested. Had Orlando  touched her girlish heart? Had this cold-blooded nature, with its steel-like  brilliancy and honourable but stern views of life, moved this warm and  sympathetic soul to more than admiration? The thought disturbed him so he  forgot the nearness of the moment they were all awaiting till a quick rasping  sound from the hangar, followed by the sudden appearance of an ever-widening  band of light about its upper rim, drew his attention and awakened them all to  a breathless expectation.</p>
  <p>The  lid was rising. Now it was half-way up, and now, for the first time, it was  lifted to its full height and stood a broad oval disc against the background of  the forest. The effect was strange. The hangar had been made brilliant by many  lamps, and their united glare pouring from its top and illuminating not only  the surrounding treetops but the broad face of this uplifted disc, roused in  the awed spectator a thrill such as in mythological times might have greeted  the sudden sight of Vulcan&rsquo;s smithy blazing on Olympian hills. But the clang of  iron on iron would have attended the flash and gleam of those unexpected fires,  and here all was still save for that steady throb never heard in Olympus or the  halls of Valhalla, the pant of the motor eager for flight in the upper air.</p>
  <p>As  they listened in a trance of burning hope which obliterated all else, this  noise and all others near and distant, was suddenly lost in a loud clatter of  writhing and twisting boughs which set the forest in a roar and seemed to heave  the air about them.</p>
  <p>A  wind had swooped down from the east, bending everything before it and rattling  the huge oval on which their eyes were fixed as though it would tear it from  its hinges.</p>
  <p>The  three caught at each other&rsquo;s hands in dismay. The storm had come just on the  verge of the enterprise, and no one might guess the result.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  he dare? Will he dare?&rdquo; whispered Doris, and Oswald answered, though it seemed  next to impossible that he could have heard her:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will dare. But will he survive it? Mr. Challoner,&rdquo; he suddenly shouted in that  gentleman&rsquo;s ear, &ldquo;what time is it now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Challoner, disengaging himself from their mutual grasp, knelt down by the  lantern to consult his watch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  minute to eight,&rdquo; he shouted back.</p>
  <p>The  forest was now a pandemonium. Great boughs, split from their parent trunks,  fell crashing to the ground in all directions. The scream of the wind roused  echoes which repeated themselves, here, there and everywhere. No rain had  fallen yet, but the sight of the clouds skurrying pell-mell through the glare  thrown up from the shed, created such havoc in the already overstrained minds  of the three onlookers, that they hardly heeded, when with a clatter and crash  which at another time would have startled them into flight, the swaying oval  before them was whirled from its hinges and thrown back against the trees  already bending under the onslaught of the tempest. Destruction seemed the natural  accompaniment of the moment, and the only prayer which sprang to Oswald&rsquo;s lips  was that the motor whose throb yet lingered in their blood though no longer  taken in by the ear, would either refuse to work or prove insufficient to lift  the heavy car into this seething tumult of warring forces. His brother&rsquo;s life  hung in the balance against his fame, and he could not but choose life for him.  Yet, as the multitudinous sounds about him yielded for a moment to that  brother&rsquo;s shout, and he knew that the moment had come, which would soon settle  all, he found himself staring at the elliptical edge of the hangar, with an  anticipation which held in it as much terror as joy, for the end of a great  hope or the beginning of a great triumph was compressed into this trembling  instant and if&mdash;</p>
  <p>Great  God! he sees it! They all see it! Plainly against that portion of the disc  which still lifted itself above the further wall, a curious moving mass  appears, lengthens, takes on shape, then shoots suddenly aloft, clearing the  encircling tops of the bending, twisting and tormented trees, straight into the  heart of the gale, where for one breathless moment it whirls madly about like a  thing distraught, then in slow but triumphant obedience to the master hand that  guides it, steadies and mounts majestically upward till it is lost to their  view in the depths of impenetrable darkness.</p>
  <p>Orlando  Brotherson has accomplished his task. He has invented a mechanism which can  send an air-car straight up from its mooring place. As the three watchers  realise this, Oswald utters a cry of triumph, and Doris throws herself into Mr.  Challoner&rsquo;s arms. Then they all stand transfixed again, waiting for a descent  which may never come.</p>
  <p>But  hark! a new sound, mingling its clatter with all the others. It is the rain.  Quick, maddening, drenching, it comes; enveloping them in wet in a moment. Can  they hold their faces up against it?</p>
  <p>And  the wind! Surely it must toss that aerial messenger before it and fling it back  to earth, a broken and despised toy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Orlando?&rdquo;  went up in a shriek. &ldquo;Orlando?&rdquo; Oh, for a ray of light in those far-off heavens  For a lull in the tremendous sounds shivering the heavens and shaking the  earth! But the tempest rages on, and they can only wait, five minutes, ten  minutes, looking, hoping, fearing, without thought of self and almost without  thought of each other, till suddenly as it had come, the rain ceases and the  wind, with one final wail of rage and defeat, rushes away into the west,  leaving behind it a sudden silence which, to their terrified hearts, seems  almost more dreadful to bear than the accumulated noises of the moment just  gone.</p>
  <p>Orlando  was in that shout of natural forces, but he is not in this stillness. They look  aloft, but the heavens are void. Emptiness is where life was. Oswald begins to  sway, and Doris, remembering him now and him only, has thrown her strong young  arm about him, when&mdash;What is this sound they hear high up, high up, in the  rapidly clearing vault of the heavens! A throb&mdash;a steady pant,&mdash;drawing near and  yet nearer,&mdash;entering the circlet of great branches over their heads&mdash;descending,  slowly descending,&mdash;till they catch another glimpse of those hazy outlines which  had no sooner taken shape than the car disappeared from their sight within the  elliptical wall open to receive it.</p>
  <p>It  had survived the gale! It has re-entered its haven, and that, too, without  colliding with aught around or any shock to those within, just as Orlando had  promised; and the world was henceforth his! Hail to Orlando Brotherson!</p>
  <p>Oswald  could hardly restrain his mad joy and enthusiasm. Bounding to the door  separating him from this conqueror of almost invincible forces, he pounded it  with impatient fist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me in!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done the trick, Orlando, you&rsquo;ve done the trick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I have satisfied myself,&rdquo; came back in studied self-control from the other side  of the door; and with a quick turning of the lock, Orlando stood before them.</p>
  <p>They  never forgot him as he looked at that moment. He was drenched, battered,  palpitating with excitement; but the majesty of success was in his eye and in  the bearing of his incomparable figure.</p>
  <p>As  Oswald bounded towards him, he reached out his hand, but his glance was for  Doris.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he went on, in tones of suppressed elation, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no flaw in my triumph. I  have done all that I set out to do. Now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Why  did he stop and look hurriedly back into the hangar? He had remembered  Sweetwater. Sweetwater, who at that moment was stepping carefully from his seat  in some remote portion of the car. The triumph was not complete. He had meant&mdash;</p>
  <p>But  there his thought stopped. Nothing of evil, nothing even of regret should mar  his great hour. He was a conqueror, and it was for him now to reap the joy of  conquest.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_38"></a><b>Chapter 38<br>
    Night</b></h2>
  <p>Three  days had passed, and Orlando Brotherson sat in his room at the hotel before a  table laden with telegrams, letters and marked newspapers. The news of his  achievement had gone abroad, and Derby was, for the moment, the centre of  interest for two continents.</p>
  <p>His  success was an established fact. The second trial which he had made with his  car, this time with the whole town gathered together in the streets as  witnesses, had proved not only the reliability of its mechanism, but the great  advantages which it possessed for a direct flight to any given point. Already  he saw Fortune beckoning to him in the shape of an unconditional offer of money  from a first-class source; and better still,&mdash;for he was a man of untiring  energy and boundless resource&mdash;that opportunity for new and enlarged effort  which comes with the recognition of one&rsquo;s exceptional powers.</p>
  <p>All  this was his and more. A sweeter hope, a more enduring joy had followed hard  upon gratified ambition. Doris had smiled on him;&mdash;Doris! She had caught the  contagion of the universal enthusiasm and had given him her first ungrudging  token of approval. It had altered his whole outlook on life in an instant, for  there was an eagerness in this demonstration which proclaimed the relieved  heart. She no longer trusted either appearances or her dream. He had succeeded  in conquering her doubts by the very force of his personality, and the shadow  which had hitherto darkened their intercourse had melted quite away. She was  ready to take his word now and Oswald&rsquo;s, after which the rest must follow. Love  does not lag far behind an ardent admiration.</p>
  <p>Fame!  Fortune! Love! What more could a man desire? What more could this man, with his  strenuous past and an unlimited capacity for an enlarged future, ask from fate  than this. Yet, as he bends over his letters, fingering some, but reading none  beyond a line or two, he betrays but a passing elation, and hardly lifts his  head when a burst of loud acclaim comes ringing up to his window from some  ardent passer-by: &ldquo;Hurrah for Brotherson! He has put our town on the map!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Why  this despondency? Have those two demons seized him again? It would seem so and  with new and overmastering fury. After the hour of triumph comes the hour of  reckoning. Orlando Brotherson in his hour of proud attainment stands naked  before his own soul&rsquo;s tribunal and the pleader is dumb and the judge  inexorable. There is but one Witness to such struggles; but one eye to note the  waste and desolation of the devastated soul, when the storm is over past.</p>
  <p>Orlando  Brotherson has succumbed; the attack was too keen, his forces too shaken. But  as the heavy minutes pass, he slowly re-gathers his strength and rises, in the  end, a conqueror. Nevertheless, he knows, even in that moment of regained  command, that the peace he had thus bought with strain and stress is but  momentary; that the battle is on for life: that the days which to other eyes  would carry a sense of brilliancy&mdash;days teeming with work and outward  satisfaction&mdash;would hold within their hidden depths a brooding uncertainty which  would rob applause of its music and even overshadow the angel face of Love.</p>
  <p>He  quailed at the prospect, materialist though he was. The days&mdash;the interminable  days! In his unbroken strength and the glare of the noonday sun, he forgot to  take account of the nights looming in black and endless procession before him.  It was from the day phantom he shrank, and not from the ghoul which works in  the darkness and makes a grave of the heart while happier mortals sleep.</p>
  <p>And  the former terror seemed formidable enough to him in this his hour of startling  realisation, even if he had freed himself for the nonce from its controlling  power. To escape all further contemplation of it he would work. These letters  deserved attention. He would carry them to Oswald, and in their consideration  find distraction for the rest of the day, at least. Oswald was a good fellow.  If pleasure were to be gotten from these tokens of good-will, he should have  his share of it. A gleam of Oswald&rsquo;s old spirit in Oswald&rsquo;s once bright eye,  would go far towards throttling one of those demons whose talons he had just  released from his throat; and if Doris responded too, he would deserve his  fate, if he did not succeed in gaining that mastery of himself which would make  such hours as these but episodes in a life big with interest and potent with  great emotions.</p>
  <p>Rising  with a resolute air, he made a bundle of his papers and, with them in hand,  passed out of his room and down the hotel stairs.</p>
  <p>A  man stood directly in his way, as he made for the front door. It was Mr.  Challoner.</p>
  <p>Courtesy  demanded some show of recognition between them, and Brotherson was passing with  his usual cold bow, when a sudden impulse led him to pause and meet the other&rsquo;s  eye, with the sarcastic remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have expressed, or so I have been told, some surprise at my choice of  mechanician. A man of varied accomplishments, Mr. Challoner, but one for whom I  have no further use. If, therefore, you wish to call off your watch-dog, you  are at liberty to do so. I hardly think he can be serviceable to either of us  much longer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  older gentleman hesitated, seeking possibly for composure, and when he answered  it was not only without irony but with a certain forced respect:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Sweetwater has just left for New York, Mr. Brotherson. He will carry with him,  no doubt, the full particulars of your great success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orlando  bowed, this time with distinguished grace. Not a flicker of relief had  disturbed the calm serenity of his aspect, yet when a moment later, he stepped  among his shouting admirers in the street, his air and glance betrayed a  bounding joy for which another source must be found than that of gratified  pride. A chain had slipped from his spirit, and though the people shrank a  little, even while they cheered, it was rather from awe of his bearing and the  recognition of that sense of apartness which underlay his smile than from any  perception of the man&rsquo;s real nature or of the awesome purpose which at that  moment exalted it. But had they known&mdash;could they have seen into this tumultuous  heart&mdash;what a silence would have settled upon these noisy streets; and in what  terror and soul-confusion would each man have slunk away from his fellows into  the quiet and solitude of his own home.</p>
  <p>Brotherson  himself was not without a sense of the incongruity underlying this ovation;  for, as he slowly worked himself along, the brightness of his look became  dimmed with a tinge of sarcasm which in its turn gave way to an expression of  extreme melancholy&mdash;both quite unbefitting the hero of the hour in the first  flush of his new-born glory. Had he seen Doris&rsquo; youthful figure emerge for a  moment from the vine-hung porch he was approaching, bringing with it some doubt  of the reception awaiting him? Possibly, for he made a stand before he reached  the house, and sent his followers back; after which he advanced with an  unhurrying step, so that several minutes elapsed before he finally drew up  before Mr. Scott&rsquo;s door and entered through the now empty porch into his  brother&rsquo;s sitting-room.</p>
  <p>He  had meant to see Doris first, but his mind had changed. If all passed off well  between himself and Oswald, if he found his brother responsive and wide-awake  to the interests and necessities of the hour, he might forego his interview  with her till he felt better prepared to meet it. For call it cowardice or  simply a reasonable precaution, any delay seemed preferable to him in his  present mood of discouragement, to that final casting of the die upon which  hung so many and such tremendous issues. It was the first moment of real halt  in his whole tumultuous life! Never, as daring experimentalist or agitator, had  he shrunk from danger seen or unseen or from threat uttered or unuttered, as he  shrank from this young girl&rsquo;s no; and something of the dread he had felt lest  he should encounter her unaware in the hall and so be led on to speak when his  own judgment bade him be silent, darkened his features as he entered his  brother&rsquo;s presence.</p>
  <p>But  Oswald was sunk in a bitter revery of his own, and took no heed of these signs  of depression. In the re-action following these days of great excitement, the  past had re-asserted itself, and all was gloom in his once generous soul. This,  Orlando had time to perceive, quick as the change came when his brother really  realised who his visitor was. The glad &ldquo;Orlando!&rdquo; and the forced smile did not  deceive him, and his voice quavered a trifle as he held out his packet with the  words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have come to show you what the world says of my invention. We will soon be  great men,&rdquo; he emphasised, as Oswald opened the letters. &ldquo;Money has been  offered me and&mdash;Read! read!&rdquo; he urged, with an unconscious dictatorialness, as  Oswald paused in his task. &ldquo;See what the fates have prepared for us; for you  shall share all my honours, as you will from this day share my work and enter  into all my experiments. Cannot you enthuse a little bit over it? Doesn&rsquo;t the  prospect contain any allurement for you? Would you rather stay locked up in  this petty town&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  or&mdash;die. Don&rsquo;t look like that, Orlando. It was a cowardly speech and I ask your  pardon. I&rsquo;m hardly fit to talk to-day. Edith&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orlando  frowned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that name!&rdquo; he harshly interrupted. &ldquo;You must not hamper your life with useless  memories. That dream of yours may be sacred, but it belongs to the past, and a  great reality confronts you. When you have fully recovered your health, your own  manhood will rebel at a weakness unworthy one of our name. Rouse yourself,  Oswald. Take account of our prospects. Give me your hand and say, &lsquo;Life holds  something for me yet. I have a brother who needs me if I do not need him.  Together, we can prove ourselves invincible and wrench fame and fortune from  the world.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the hand he reached for did not rise at his command, though Oswald started  erect and faced him with manly earnestness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should have to think long and deeply,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;before I took upon myself  responsibilities like these. I am broken in mind and heart, Orlando, and must  remain so till God mercifully delivers me. I should be a poor assistant to  you&mdash;a drag, rather than a help. Deeply as I deplore it, hard as it may be for  one of your temperament to understand so complete an overthrow, I yet must  acknowledge my condition and pray you not to count upon me in any plans you may  form. I know how this looks&mdash;I know that as your brother and truest admirer, I  should respond, and respond strongly, to such overtures as these, but the  motive for achievement is gone. She was my all; and while I might work, it  would be mechanically. The lift, the elevating thought is gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orlando  stood a moment studying his brother&rsquo;s face; then he turned shortly about and  walked the length of the room. When he came back, he took up his stand again  directly before Oswald, and asked, with a new note in his voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you love Edith Challoner so much as that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  glance from Oswald&rsquo;s eye, sadder than any tear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  that you cannot be reconciled?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  gesture. Oswald&rsquo;s words were always few.</p>
  <p>Orlando&rsquo;s  frown deepened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  grief I partly understand,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But time will cure it. Some day another  lovely face&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  not talk of that, Orlando.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  we&rsquo;ll not talk of that,&rdquo; acquiesced the inventor, walking away again, this time  to the window. &ldquo;For you there&rsquo;s but one woman;&mdash;and she&rsquo;s a memory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Killed!&rdquo;  broke from his brother&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;Slain by her own hand under an impulse of  wildness and terror! Can I ever forget that? Do not expect it, Orlando.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you <i>do</i> blame me?&rdquo; Orlando turned and was looking full at Oswald.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  blame your unreasonableness and your overweening pride.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orlando  stood a moment, then moved towards the door. The heaviness of his step smote  upon Oswald&rsquo;s ear and caused him to exclaim:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgive  me, Orlando.&rdquo; But the other cut him short with an imperative:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks  for your candour! If her spirit is destined to stand like an immovable shadow  between you and me, you do right to warn me. But this interview must end all  allusion to the subject. I will seek and find another man to share my fortunes;  (as he said this he approached suddenly, and took his papers from the other&rsquo;s  hand) or&mdash;&rdquo; Here he hastily retraced his steps to the door which he softly  opened. &ldquo;Or&rdquo; he repeated&mdash;But though Oswald listened for the rest, it did not  come. While he waited, the other had given him one deeply concentrated look and  passed out.</p>
  <p>No  heartfelt understanding was possible between these two men.</p>
  <p>Crossing  the hall, Orlando knocked at the door of Doris&rsquo; little sitting-room.</p>
  <p>No  answer, yet she was there. He knew it in every throbbing fibre of his body. She  was there and quite aware of his presence; of this he felt sure; yet she did  not bid him enter. Should he knock again? Never! but he would not quit the  threshold, not if she kept him waiting there for hours. Perhaps she realised  this. Perhaps she had meant to open the door to him from the very first, who  can tell? What avails is that she did ultimately open it, and he, meeting her  soft eye, wished from his very heart that his impulse had led him another way,  even if that way had been to the edge of the precipice&mdash;and over.</p>
  <p>For  the face he looked upon was serene, and there was no serenity in him; rather a  confusion of unloosed passions fearful of barrier and yearning tumultuously for  freedom. But, whatever his revolt, the secret revolt which makes no show in  look or movement, he kept his ground and forced a smile of greeting. If her  face was quiet, it was also lovely;&mdash;too lovely, he felt, for a man to leave it,  whatever might come of his lingering.</p>
  <p>Nothing  in all his life had ever affected him like it. For him there was no other woman  in the past, the present or the future, and, realising this&mdash;taking in to the  full what her affection and her trust might be to him in those fearsome days to  come, he so dreaded a rebuff&mdash;he, who had been the courted of women and the  admired of men ever since he could remember,&mdash;that he failed to respond to her  welcome and the simple congratulations she felt forced to repeat. He could  neither speak the commonplace, nor listen to it. This was his crucial hour. He  must find support here, or yield hopelessly to the maelstrom in whose whirl he  was caught.</p>
  <p>She  saw his excitement and faltered back a step&mdash;a move which she regretted the next  minute, for he took advantage of it to enter and close behind him the door  which she would never have shut of her own accord. Then he spoke, abruptly,  passionately, but in those golden tones which no emotion could render other  than alluring:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am an unhappy man, Miss Scott. I see that my presence here is not welcome, yet  am sure that it would be so if it were not for a prejudice which your generous  nature should be the first to cast aside, in face of the outspoken confidence  of my brother: Oswald. Doris, little Doris, I love you. I have loved you from  the moment of our first meeting. Not to many men is it given to find his heart  so late, and when he does, it is for his whole life; no second passion can  follow it. I know that I am premature in saying this; that you are not prepared  to hear such words from me and that it might be wiser for me to withhold them,  but I must leave Derby soon, and I cannot go until I know whether there is the  least hope that you will yet lend a light to my career or whether that career  must burn itself to ashes at your feet. Oswald&mdash;nay, hear me out&mdash;Oswald lives in  his memories; but I must have an active hope&mdash;a tangible expectation&mdash;if I am to  be the man I was meant to be. Will you, then, coldly dismiss me, or will you let  my whole future life prove to you the innocence of my past? I will not hasten  anything; all I ask is some indulgence. Time will do the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo;  she murmured.</p>
  <p>But  that was a word for which he had no ear. He saw that she was moved, unexpectedly  so; that while her eyes wandered restlessly at times towards the door, they  ever came back in girlish wonder, if not fascination, to his face, emboldening  him so that he ventured at last, to add:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Doris,  little Doris, I will teach you a marvellous lesson, if you will only turn your  dainty ear my way. Love such as mine carries infinite treasure with it. Will  you have that treasure heaped, piled before your feet? Your lips say no, but  your eyes&mdash;the truest eyes I ever saw&mdash;whisper a different language. The day will  come when you will find your joy in the breast of him you are now afraid to  trust.&rdquo; And not waiting for disclaimer or even a glance of reproach from the  eyes he had so wilfully misread, he withdrew with a movement as abrupt as that  with which he had entered.</p>
  <p>Why,  then, with the memory of this exultant hour to fend off all shadows, did the  midnight find him in his solitary hangar in the moonlit woods, a deeply  desponding figure again. Beside him, swung the huge machine which represented a  life of power and luxury; but he no longer saw it. It called to him with many a  creak and quiet snap,&mdash;sounds to start his blood and fire his eye a week&mdash;nay, a  day ago. But he was deaf to this music now; the call went unheeded; the future  had no further meaning, for him, nor did he know or think whether he sat in  light or in darkness; whether the woods were silent about him, or panting with  life and sound. His demon had gripped him again and the final battle was on.  There would never be another. Mighty as he felt himself to be, there were  limits even to his capacity for endurance. He could sustain no further  conflict. How then would it end? He never had a doubt himself! Yet he sat  there.</p>
  <p>Around  him in the forest, the night owls screeched and innumerable small things without  a name, skurried from lair to lair.</p>
  <p>He  heard them not.</p>
  <p>Above,  the moon rode, flecking the deepest shadows with the silver from her  half-turned urn, but none of the soft and healing drops fell upon him. Nature  was no longer a goddess, but an avenger; light a revealer, not a solace.  Darkness the only boon.</p>
  <p>Nor  had time a meaning. From early eve to early morn he sat there and knew not if  it were one hour or twelve. Earth was his no longer. He roused, when the sun  made everything light about him, but he did not think about it. He rose, but  was not conscious that he rose. He unlocked the door and stepped out into the  forest; but he could never remember doing this. He only knew later that he had  been in the woods and now was in his room at the hotel; all the rest was  phantasmagoria, agony and defeat.</p>
  <p>He  had crossed the Rubicon of this world&rsquo;s hopes and fears, but he had been  unconscious of the passage.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_39"></a><b>Chapter 39<br>
    The Avenger</b></h2>
  <p class="note"><i>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Challoner:</i></p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;With every apology for the intrusion, may I request a  few minutes of private conversation with you this evening at seven o&rsquo;clock? Let  it be in your own room.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Yours truly,<br>
  &ldquo;ORLANDO BROTHERSON.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Challoner had been called upon to face many difficult and heartrending duties  since the blow which had desolated his home fell upon him.</p>
  <p>But  from none of them had he shrunk as he did from the interview thus demanded. He  had supposed himself rid of this man. He had dismissed him from his life when  he had dismissed Sweetwater. His face, accordingly, wore anything but a  propitiatory look, when promptly at the hour of seven, Orlando Brotherson  entered his apartments.</p>
  <p>His  pleasure or his displeasure was, however, a matter of small consequence to his  self-invited visitor. He had come there with a set purpose, and nothing in  heaven or earth could deter him from it now. Declining the offer of a seat,  with the slightest of acknowledgments in the way of a bow, he took a careful  survey of the room before saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  we alone, Mr. Challoner, or is that man Sweetwater lurking somewhere within  hearing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Sweetwater is gone, as I had the honour of telling you yesterday,&rdquo; was the  somewhat stiff reply. &ldquo;There are no witnesses to this conference, if that is  what you wish to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, but you will pardon my insistence if I request the privilege of closing  that door.&rdquo; He pointed to the one communicating with the bedroom. &ldquo;The  information I have to give you is not such as I am willing to have shared, at  least for the present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may close the door,&rdquo; said Mr. Challoner coldly. &ldquo;But is it necessary for you to  give me the information you mention, to-night? If it is of such a nature that  you cannot accord me the privilege of sharing it, as yet, with others, why not  spare me till you can? I have gone through much, Mr. Brotherson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have,&rdquo; came in steady assent as the man thus addressed stepped to the door he  had indicated and quietly closed it. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued, as he crossed back to  his former position, &ldquo;would it be easier for you to go through the night now in  anticipation of what I have to reveal than to hear it at once from my lips  while I am in the mood to speak?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  answer was slow in coming. The courage which had upheld this rapidly aging man  through so many trying interviews, seemed inadequate for the test put so  cruelly upon it. He faltered and sank heavily into a chair, while the stern man  watching him, gave no signs of responsive sympathy or even interest, only a  patient and icy-tempered resolve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot live in uncertainty;&rdquo; such were finally Mr. Challoner&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;What you  have to say concerns Edith?&rdquo; The pause he made was infinitesimal in length, but  it was long enough for a quick disclaimer. But no such disclaimer came. &ldquo;I will  hear it,&rdquo; came in reluctant finish.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Brotherson took a step forward. His manner was as cold as the heart which lay  like a stone in his bosom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you pardon me if I ask you to rise?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have my weaknesses too.&rdquo; (He  gave no sign of them.) &ldquo;I cannot speak down from such a height to the man I am  bound to hurt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  if answering to the constraint of a will quite outside his own, Mr. Challoner  rose. Their heads were now more nearly on a level and Mr. Brotherson&rsquo;s voice  remained low, as he proceeded, with quiet intensity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  has been a time&mdash;and it may exist yet, God knows&mdash;when you thought me in some  unknown and secret way the murderer of your daughter. I do not quarrel with the  suspicion; it was justified, Mr. Challoner. I did kill your daughter, and with  this hand! I can no longer deny it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  wretched father swayed, following the gesture of the hand thus held out; but he  did not fall, nor did a sound leave his lips.</p>
  <p>Brotherson  went coldly on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did it because I regarded her treatment of my suit as insolent. I have no mercy  for any such display of intolerance on the part of the rich and the fortunate.  I hated her for it; I hated her class, herself and all she stood for. To strike  the dealer of such a hurt I felt to be my right. Though a man of small  beginnings and of a stock which such as you call common, I have a pride which  few of your blood can equal. I could not work, or sleep or eat with such a  sting in my breast as she had planted there. To rid myself of it, I determined  to kill her, and I did. How? Oh, that was easy, though it has proved a great  stumbling-block to the detectives, as I knew it would! I shot her&mdash;but not with  an ordinary bullet. My charge was a small icicle made deliberately for the  purpose. It had strength enough to penetrate, but it left no trace behind it.  &lsquo;A bullet of ice for a heart of ice,&rsquo; I had said in the torment of my rage. But  the word was without knowledge, Mr. Challoner. I see it now; I have seen it for  two whole weeks. I did not misjudge her condemnation of me, but I misjudged its  cause. It was not to the comparatively poor, the comparatively obscure man she  sought to show contempt, but to the brother of Oswald whose claims she saw  insulted. A woman I should have respected, not killed. A woman of no pride of  station; a woman who loved a man not only of my own class but of my own blood&mdash;a  woman, to avenge whose unmerited death I stand here before you a self-condemned  criminal. That is but justice, Mr. Challoner. That is the way I look at things.  Though no sentimentalist; and dead to all beliefs save the eternal truths of  science, I have that in me which will not let me profit, now that I know myself  unworthy, by the great success I have earned. Hence this confession, Mr.  Challoner. It has not come easily, nor do I shut my eyes in the least to the  results which must follow. <i>But I can not do differently</i>. To-morrow, you may  telegraph to New York. Till then I desire to be left undisturbed. I have many  things to dispose of in the interim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Challoner, very white by now, pointed to the door before he sank again into his  chair. Brotherson took it for dismissal and stepped slowly back. Then their  eyes met again and Mr. Challoner spoke his first word:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was another&mdash;a poor woman&mdash;she died suddenly&mdash;and her wound was not unlike that  inflicted upon Edith. Did you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did.&rdquo; The answer came without a tremour. &ldquo;You may say and so may others that I  was less justified in this attack than in the other; but I do not see it that  way. A theory does not always work in practice. I wished to test the unusual  means I contemplated, and the woman I saw before me across the court was  hard-working and with nothing in life to look forward to, so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  cry of bitter execration from Mr. Challoner cut him short. Turning with a shrug  he was about to lift his hand to the door, when he gave a violent start and  fell hastily back before a quickly entering figure of such passion and fury as  neither of these men had ever seen before.</p>
  <p>It  was Oswald! Oswald, the kindly! Oswald, the lover of men and the adorer of  women! Oswald, with the words of the dastardly confession he had partly  overheard searing hot within his brain! Oswald, raised in a moment from the  desponding invalid to a terrifying ministrant of retributive justice.</p>
  <p>Orlando  could scarcely raise his hand before the other&rsquo;s was upon his throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murderer!  doubly-dyed murderer of innocent women!&rdquo; was hissed in the strong man&rsquo;s ears.  &ldquo;Not with the law but with me you must reckon, and may God and the spirit of my  mother nerve my arm!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_40"></a><b>Chapter 40<br>
    Desolate</b></h2>
  <p>The  struggle was fierce but momentary. Oswald with his weakened powers could not  long withstand the steady exertion of Orlando&rsquo;s giant strength, and ere long  sank away from the contest into Mr. Challoner&rsquo;s arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  should not have summoned the shade of our mother to your aid,&rdquo; observed the  other with a smile, in which the irony was lost in terrible presage. &ldquo;I was  always her favourite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Oswald  shuddered. Orlando had spoken truly; she had always been blindly, arrogantly  trustful of her eldest son. No fault could she see in him; and now&mdash;</p>
  <p>Impetuously  Oswald struggled with his weakness, raised himself in Mr. Challoner&rsquo;s arms and  cried in loud revolt:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  God is just. He will not let you escape. If He does, I will not. I will hound  you to the ends of this earth and, if necessary, into the eternities. Not with  the threat of my arm&mdash;you are my master there, but with the curse of a brother  who believed you innocent of his darling&rsquo;s blood and would have believed you so  in face of everything but your own word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Peace!&rdquo;  adjured Orlando. &ldquo;There is no account I am not ready to settle. I have robbed  you of the woman you love, but I have despoiled myself. I stand desolate in the  world, who but an hour ago could have chosen my seat among the best and  greatest. What can your curses do after that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;  The word came slowly like a drop wrung from a nearly spent heart. &ldquo;Nothing;  nothing. Oh, Orlando, I wish we were both dead and buried and that there were  no further life for either of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  softened tone, the wistful prayer which would blot out an immortality of joy  for the one, that it might save the other from an immortality of retribution,  touched some long unsounded chord in Orlando&rsquo;s extraordinary nature.</p>
  <p>Advancing  a step, he held out his hand&mdash;the left one. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave the future to itself,  Oswald, and do what we can with the present,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a mess of my  life and spoiled a career which might have made us both kings. Forgive me,  Oswald. I ask for nothing else from God or man. I should like that. It would  strengthen me for to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  Oswald, ever kindly, generous and more ready to think of others than of  himself, had yet some of Orlando&rsquo;s tenacity. He gazed at that hand and a flush  swept up over his cheek which instantly became ghastly again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;not even the left one. May God forgive me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Orlando,  struck silent for a moment, dropped his hand and slowly turned away. Mr.  Challoner felt Oswald stiffen in his arms, and break suddenly away, only to  stop short before he had taken one of the half dozen steps between himself and  his departing brother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  are you going?&rdquo; he demanded in tones which made Orlando turn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  might say, To the devil,&rdquo; was the sarcastic reply. &ldquo;But I doubt if he would  receive me. No,&rdquo; he added, in more ordinary tones as the other shivered and  again started forward, &ldquo;you will have no trouble in finding me in my own room  to-night. I have letters to write and&mdash;other things. A man like me cannot drop  out without a ripple. You may go to bed and sleep. I will keep awake for two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Orlando!&rdquo;  Visions were passing before Oswald&rsquo;s eyes, soul-crushing visions such as in his  blameless life he never thought could enter into his consciousness or blast his  tranquil outlook upon life. &ldquo;Orlando!&rdquo; he again appealed, covering his eyes in  a frenzied attempt to shut out these horrors, &ldquo;I cannot let you go like this.  To-morrow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-morrow,  in every niche and corner of this world, wherever Edith Challoner&rsquo;s name has  gone, wherever my name has gone, it will be known that the discoverer of a  practical air-ship, is a man whom they can no longer honour. Do you think that  is not hell enough for me; or that I do not realise the hell it will be for  you? I&rsquo;ve never wearied you or any man with my affection; but I&rsquo;m not all  demon. I would gladly have spared you this additional anguish; but that was  impossible. You are my brother and must suffer from the connection whether we  would have it so or not. If it promises too much misery&mdash;and I know no misery  like that of shame&mdash;come with me where I go to-morrow. There will be room for  two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Oswald,  swaying with weakness, but maddened by the sight of an overthrow which carried  with it the stifled affections and the admiration of his whole life, gave a  bound forward, opened his arms and&mdash;fell.</p>
  <p>Orlando  stopped short. Gazing down on his prostrate brother, he stood for a moment with  a gleam of something like human tenderness showing through the flare of dying  passions and perishing hopes; then he swung open the door and passed quietly  out, and Mr. Challoner could hear the laughing remark with which he met and  dismissed the half-dozen men and women who had been drawn to this end of the  hall by what had sounded to them like a fracas between angry men.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_41"></a><b>Chapter 41<br>
    Five O&rsquo;clock In The Morning</b></h2>
  <p>The  clock in the hotel office struck three. Orlando Brotherson counted the strokes;  then went on writing. His transom was partly open and he had just heard a step  go by his door. This was nothing new. He had already heard it several times  before that night. It was Mr. Challoner&rsquo;s step, and every time it passed, he  had rustled his papers or scratched vigorously with his pen. &ldquo;He is keeping  watch for Oswald,&rdquo; was his thought. &ldquo;They fear a sudden end to this. No one,  not the son of my mother knows me. Do I know myself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Four  o&rsquo;clock! The light was still burning, the pile of letters he was writing  increasing.</p>
  <p>Five  o&rsquo;clock! A rattling shade betrays an open window. No other sound disturbs the  quiet of the room. It is empty now; but Mr. Challoner, long since satisfied  that all was well, goes by no more. Silence has settled upon the hotel;&mdash;that  heavy silence which precedes the dawn.</p>
  <p>There  was silence in the streets also. The few who were abroad, crept quietly along.  An electric storm was in the air and the surcharged clouds hung heavy and low,  biding the moment of outbreak. A man who had left a place of many shadows for  the more open road, paused and looked up at these clouds; then went calmly on.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  the shriek of an approaching train tears through the valley. Has it a call for  this man? No. Yet he pauses in the midst of the street he is crossing and  watches, as a child might watch, for the flash of its lights at the end of the  darkened vista. It comes&mdash;filling the empty space at which he stares with moving  life&mdash;engine, baggage car and a long string of Pullmans. Then all is dark again  and only the noise of its slackening wheels comes to him through the night. It  has stopped at the station. A minute longer and it has started again, and the  quickly lessening rumble of its departure is all that remains of this vision of  man&rsquo;s activity and ceaseless expectancy. When it is quite gone and all is  quiet, a sigh falls from the man&rsquo;s lips and he moves on, but this time, for  some unexplainable reason, in the direction of the station. With lowered head  he passes along, noting little till he arrives within sight of the depot where  some freight is being handled, and a trunk or two wheeled down the platform. No  sight could be more ordinary or unsuggestive, but it has its attraction for  him, for he looks up as he goes by and follows the passage of that truck down  the platform till it has reached the corner and disappeared. Then he sighs  again and again moves on.</p>
  <p>A  cluster of houses, one of them open and lighted, was all which lay between him  now and the country road. He was hurrying past, for his step had unconsciously  quickened as he turned his back upon the station, when he was seized again by  that mood of curiosity and stepped up to the door from which a light issued and  looked in. A common eating-room lay before him, with rudely spread tables and  one very sleepy waiter taking orders from a new arrival who sat with his back  to the door. Why did the lonely man on the sidewalk start as his eye fell on  the latter&rsquo;s commonplace figure, a hungry man demanding breakfast in a cheap,  country restaurant? His own physique was powerful while that of the other looked  slim and frail. But fear was in the air, and the brooding of a tempest affects  some temperaments in a totally unexpected manner. As the man inside turns  slightly and looks up, the master figure on the sidewalk vanishes, and his  step, if any one had been interested enough to listen, rings with a new note as  it turns into the country road it has at last reached.</p>
  <p>But  no one heeded. The new arrival munches his roll and waits impatiently for his  coffee, while without, the clouds pile soundlessly in the sky, one of them  taking the form of a huge hand with clutching fingers reaching down into the  hollow void beneath.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter_42"></a><b>Chapter 42<br>
    At Six</b></h2>
  <p>Mr.  Challoner had been honest in his statement regarding the departure of  Sweetwater. He had not only paid and dismissed our young detective, but he had  seen him take the train for New York. And Sweetwater had gone away in good  faith, too, possibly with his convictions undisturbed, but acknowledging at  last that he had reached the end of his resources. But the brain does not loose  its hold upon its work as readily as the hand does. He was halfway to New York  and had consciously bidden farewell to the whole subject, when he suddenly  startled those about him by rising impetuously to his feet. He sat again  immediately, but with a light in his small grey eye which Mr. Gryce would have  understood and revelled in. The idea for which he had searched industriously  for months had come at last, unbidden; thrown up from some remote recess of the  mind which had seemingly closed upon the subject forever.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have it. I have it,&rdquo; he murmured in ceaseless reiteration to himself. &ldquo;I will  go back to Mr. Challoner and let him decide if the idea is worth pursuing.  Perhaps an experiment may be necessary. It was bitter cold that night; I wish  it were icy weather now. But a chemist can help us out. Good God! if this  should be the explanation of the mystery, alas for Orlando and alas for  Oswald!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  his sympathies did not deter him. He returned to Derby at once, and as soon as  he dared, presented himself at the hotel and asked for Mr. Challoner.</p>
  <p>He  was amazed to find that gentleman already up and in a state of agitation that  was very disquieting. But he brightened wonderfully at sight of his visitor,  and drawing him inside the room, observed with trembling eagerness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not know why you have come back, but never was man more welcome. Mr.  Brotherson has confessed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Confessed!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  he killed both women; my daughter and his neighbour, the washerwoman, with a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;  broke in Sweetwater, eagerly, &ldquo;let me tell you.&rdquo; And stooping, he whispered  something in the other&rsquo;s ear.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Challoner stared at him amazed, then slowly nodded his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  came you to think&mdash;&rdquo; he began; but Sweetwater in his great anxiety interrupted  him with a quick:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Explanations  will keep, Mr. Challoner. What of the man himself? Where is he? That&rsquo;s the  important thing now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was in his room till early this morning writing letters, but he is not there  now. The door is unlocked and I went in. From appearances I fear the worst.  That is why your presence relieves me so. Where do you think he is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  his hangar in the woods. Where else would he go to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have thought of that. Shall we start out alone or take witnesses with us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will go alone. Does Oswald anticipate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is sure. But he lacks strength to move. He lies on my bed in there. Doris and  her father are with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will not wait a minute. How the storm holds off. I hope it will hold off for  another hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Challoner made no reply. He had spoken because he felt compelled to speak, but  it had not been easy for him, nor could any trifles move him now.</p>
  <p>The  town was up by this time and, though they chose the least frequented streets,  they had to suffer from some encounters. It was a good half hour before they  found themselves in the forest and in sight of the hangar. One look that way,  and Sweetwater turned to see what the effect was upon Mr. Challoner.</p>
  <p>A  murmur of dismay greeted him. The oval of that great lid stood up against the  forest background.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has escaped,&rdquo; cried Mr. Challoner.</p>
  <p>But  Sweetwater, laying a finger on his lip, advanced and laid his ear against the  door. Then he cast a quick look aloft. Nothing was to be seen there. The  darkness of storm in the heavens but nothing more.&mdash;Yes! now, a flash of vivid  and destructive lightning!</p>
  <p>The  two men drew back and their glances crossed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us return to the highroad,&rdquo; whispered Sweetwater; &ldquo;we can see nothing here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Challoner, trembling very much, wheeled slowly about.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;  enjoined Sweetwater. &ldquo;First let me take a look inside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Running  to the nearest tree, he quickly climbed it, worked himself along a protruding  branch and looked down into the open hangar. It was now so dark that details  escaped him, but one thing was certain. The air-ship was not there.</p>
  <p>Descending,  he drew Mr. Challoner hastily along. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Let us reach the  high ground as quickly as we can. I&rsquo;m glad that Mr. Oswald Brotherson is not  with us or&mdash;or Miss Doris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  this expression of satisfaction died on his lips. At the point where the forest  road debouches into the highway, he had already caught a glimpse of their two  figures. They were waiting for news, and the brother spoke up the instant he  saw Sweetwater:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is he? You&rsquo;ve not found him or you wouldn&rsquo;t be coming alone. He cannot have  gone up. He cannot manage it without an assistant. We must seek him somewhere  else; in the forest or in our house at home. Ah!&rdquo; The lightning had forked  again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  not in the forest and he&rsquo;s not in your home,&rdquo; returned Sweetwater. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s aloft;  the air-ship is not in the shed. And he can go up alone now.&rdquo; Then more slowly:  &ldquo;But he cannot come down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  strained their eyes in a maddening search of the heavens. But the darkness had  so increased that they could be sure of nothing. Doris sank upon her knees.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  the lightning flashed again, this time so vividly and so near that the whole  heaven burst into fiery illumination above them and the thunder, crashing  almost simultaneously, seemed for a moment to rock the world and bow the  heavens towards them. Then a silence; then Sweetwater&rsquo;s whisper in Mr.  Challoner&rsquo;s ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  them away! I saw him; he was falling like a shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Challoner threw out his arms, then steadied himself. Oswald was reeling; Oswald  had seen too. But Doris was there. When the lightning flashed again, she was  standing and Oswald was weeping on her bosom.</p>
