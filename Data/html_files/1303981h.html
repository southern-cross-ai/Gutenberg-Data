  <br>

  <p class="first">
  I WAS in the Buckhorn Saloon in San Antonio, jest h&rsquo;isting a
  schooner of Pearl XXX, when my brother Kirby come staggering in all caked
  with dust and sweat, and stuck out a letter at me.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pap sent it,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve rode day and night
  to find you!&rdquo; He then collapsed onto the floor where he lay till I
  picked him up and laid him on the bar and started the barkeep to pouring
  licker down his throat. It&rsquo;s a long way from our cabin to Santone, and
  he must of had a hard ride. I figgered the letter he brung must be arful
  important, so after I&rsquo;d drunk my beer and et me a sandwich offa the
  free lunch counter, I onfolded it and read it. It was from Aunt Navasota
  Hawkins, over in East Texas, and it was addressed to Mister Judson Bearfield,
  Wolf Mountain, Texas, which is Pap, and it said:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Dear Jud:</p>

  <p class="letter">
  We air in awful trouble. Somethin happened none of us never drempt could
  happen. Uncle Joab Hudkins has took to stealin hawgs! You won&rsquo;t believe
  this I know Judson because none of the family never stole nothin in their
  life before but it&rsquo;s the truth. The Watsons ketched him in their pigpen
  tother night and filled his britches with bird-shot and I will not repeat his
  langwidge whilst we was picking them shot out of his hide Judson. The whole
  clan gathered around and argyed with him Judson but we wouldn&rsquo;t move
  him all he said was he wisht we would mind our own dadburned business. He was
  very cantankerus Judson and you ought to of heard what he called Uncle Saul
  Hawkins when Uncle Saul told him he had disgraced the family.We could not do
  nothin with him so we left Cousin Esau Harrison to see he didn&rsquo;t git
  out of the house till we could decide what to do. But he hit Cousin Esau over
  the head with the axe handle I use to stir hominy with and has run off into
  the woods Judson it is tarrible we don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s up to but
  we suspects the wust. We have apolergized to the Watsons and offered to pay
  them for any damage he done but you know how them Watsons is Judson they say
  nothin will wipe out the insult but blood. It looks like they air goin to
  force a feud onto us we have got enough feuds as it is Judson. And so will
  you please send Pikeston over here to help find Uncle Joab and settle them
  Watsonses&rsquo; hash.</p>

  <p class="letter">Yore lovin Ant Navasota Hawkins</p><br>

  <p>On the bottom of her letter Pap had writ, &ldquo;Pike, pull for Choctaw
  Bayou as fast as you can peel it and don&rsquo;t take no sass from them
  cussed Watsons.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Well, I was so overcame for a few minutes all I could do was lean on the
  bar and drink a pint of tequila. To think as a relative of mine would stoop
  to pig stealing! Why, us Bearfields was that proud we wouldn&rsquo;t even
  steal a hoss. I dunno when I ever felt so low and wolfish in my spirits. I
  felt like the whole world knowed our shame and was p&rsquo;inting the finger
  of scorn at us.</p>

  <p>When Kirby come to he said he felt the same, and he said he aimed to shoot
  the first illegitimate which even said &ldquo;hawg&rdquo; at him. But I
  cautioned him to guard our arful secret with his life, and I told him to go
  around to the wagon yard where my hoss Satanta was, and arrange for his board
  whilst I was gone.</p>

  <p>I then bought me a ticket for Houston and clumb aboard the train without
  telling my friends good-by; I was too ashamed to look &rsquo;em in the face
  with a pig thief in the family.</p><br>

  <p>That was a irksome journey. All I could think of was pigs and when I dozed
  in my seat I dreampt about pigs. It was a dark hour for the Bearfield pride,
  and I got tetchier every minute.</p>

  <p>When I got to Houston I imejitly went to a livery stable to rent me a
  hoss, and there I run into the same difficulty I always run into whenever I
  gits east of the Trinity. They warn&rsquo;t a hoss in town which was big
  enough and strong enough to tote my weight any distance. I dunno why them
  folks raises sech spindly critters. They claims their hosses is all right,
  and I&rsquo;m jest bigger&rsquo;n a human being ought to be. Well, I
  ain&rsquo;t considered onusually gigantic on Wolf Mountain, but I have
  already noticed that men on Wolf Mountain grows bigger&rsquo;n they does in
  most places. So I reckon I do look kind of prominent to strangers, being as I
  stand six foot nine in my socks and weigh two hundred and ninety-five pounds,
  all bone and muscle. In addition to which modesty forces me to remark that
  I&rsquo;m jest about the best man in a free-for-all on Wolf Mountain or
  anywheres else that I ever been, either.</p>

  <p>Anyway, I finally pitched on a squint-eyed mule named Sinclair&rsquo;s
  Defeat, which was big enough even for me, and I forked him and headed for the
  home-range of my erring relative. I was in the piney-woods by now, and I felt
  plumb smothered with all them trees and sloughs and swamps, and no hills nor
  prickly pears nor prairies.</p>

  <p>Them woods was full of razorback hawgs and every time I seen one it
  reminded me of the family shame, so I was in a regular welter of nervous
  irritation time I got to Sabineville, where my kinfolks does their trading.
  It was about noon, so I put Sinclair&rsquo;s Defeat in the wagon yard and
  seen he was fed and watered, and then I went to the restaurant. I
  hadn&rsquo;t been to Sabineville since I was a kid, and didn&rsquo;t know
  nobody there, but everybody I met stopped and gaped like they never seen a
  man my size before. They all had their guns on under their shirts and so did
  I, because I hid mine when we pulled into Houston.</p>

  <p>I sot down in the restaurant and the waiter ast me what I&rsquo;d have. I
  ast him what he had, and he says, &ldquo;We got some nice roast
  pork!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen here, you!&rdquo; I says, rising in wrath. &ldquo;Maybe you
  think you can mock me with impunity because I&rsquo;m a stranger in yore
  midst. But the man don&rsquo;t live which can throw the family scandal in my
  face and survive!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What air you talkin&rsquo; about?&rdquo; gasped he, recoiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to ack innercent,&rdquo; I says bitterly. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t know you, and I don&rsquo;t know how come you to recognize me,
  but the best thing you can do is to pertend not to know me. Bring me a
  beefsteak smothered with onions and nine or ten bottles of beer, and lemme
  hear no more about pork if you values yore wuthless life!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He done so in fear and trembling, and I heard him whisper to the cook that
  they was a homicidal maneyack outside; but I didn&rsquo;t see none.</p>

  <p>I&rsquo;d jest started on my steak when three big, rough-looking men come
  in. They give me a suspicious glance, but I paid &rsquo;em no heed and went
  on eating. So they sot down at the counter and ordered beans and coffee, and
  one of &rsquo;em said, &ldquo;Have you swore out that warrant for old Joab
  Hudkins yet, Jabez?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They all looked around at me on account of me strangling on my beer, and
  the oldest and meanest-looking one says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; over to
  the sheriff &rsquo;s office soon&rsquo;s we&rsquo;ve et, Bill. This is the
  chance I been lookin&rsquo; fur.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; says Bill with a oath. &ldquo;Hey, Joe?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shore,&rdquo; says the third &rsquo;un. &ldquo;But we better be
  keerful. Them Hudkinses and their kinfolks around here is bad enough, but the
  Bearfields, which lives out beyond the Pecos somewheres, is wuss
  yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t scairt of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; says Jabez.
  &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t us Watsons won all our feuds up to now? I don&rsquo;t keer
  nothin&rsquo; about the hawgs, neither. But this here&rsquo;s my chance to
  git even with old Esau Hawkins for that whuppin&rsquo; he give me over to the
  county seat fifteen year ago. I jest want to see his face when one of his kin
  goes to the pen for stealin&rsquo; hawgs! . . . What was that?&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>It was me, tying a knot in my steak fork in my struggle to control myself,
  but by a supreme effort I helt my peace.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says Bill, &ldquo;I hopes for Hudkins gore! I jest
  wisht one of them tough Bearfields was here. I&rsquo;d show him a thing or
  two, I betcha!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, git the exhibition started!&rdquo; I said, heaving up so
  sudden I upsot my table and Joe fell off his stool. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stood
  all I can from you illegitimates.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who the devil air you?&rdquo; gasped Jabez, jumping up, and I says,
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Bearfield from the Pecos, and Joab Hudkins is my kin!
  I&rsquo;m askin&rsquo; you like a gent to refrain from swearin&rsquo; out
  that warrant you all was talkin&rsquo; about I&rsquo;m here to see that he
  don&rsquo;t molest nobody else&rsquo;s hawgs, but I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;
  to see him tromped on, neither!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; sneered Bill, fingering his pistol,
  whilst I seen Joe sneaking a bowie outa his boot. &ldquo;Well, lemme tell you
  somethin&rsquo;, you dern mountain grizzly, we aims to put that there pig
  snatchin&rsquo; uncle of yore&rsquo;n behind the bars! How you like that,
  hey?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is how much, you blasted swamp rat!&rdquo; I roared,
  shattering my steak plate over his head.</p>

  <p>He fell offa his stool howling bloody murder, and Joe made a stab at me
  but missed and stuck his knife in the table and whilst he was trying to pull
  it out I busted the catsup bottle over his head and he j&rsquo;ined Bill on
  the floor. I then seen Jabez crouching at the end of the counter fixing to
  shoot me with his pistol, so I grabbed a case of canned tomaters and throwed
  it at him, and what happened to the waiter was his own fault. He oughta
  stayed outa the fight in the first place. If he hadn&rsquo;t been trying to
  git a shotgun he had behind the counter he wouldn&rsquo;t of run between me
  and Jabez jest as I heaved that case of vegetables. T&rsquo;warn&rsquo;t my
  fault he got hit in the head, no more&rsquo;n it was my fault he ketched old
  Jabez&rsquo;s bullet in his hind laig, neither. I kicked Jabez&rsquo;s pistol
  out of his hand before he could shoot again, and he run around behind the
  counter on his all-fours, jest as the cook come out of the kitchen with a
  iron skillet.</p>

  <p>It always did make me mad to git hit over the head with a hot skillet; the
  grease always gits down the back of yore neck. So I grabbed the cook and went
  to the floor with him jest in time to duck the charge of buckshot old Jabez
  blazed at me with the waiter&rsquo;s shotgun from behind the counter. I then
  riz up and throwed the cook at him and they both crashed into the wall so
  hard they brung down all the shelves on it and the cans of beans and milk and
  corn and stuff fell down on top of Jabez till all I could see was his boots
  sticking out and his howls was arful to hear.</p>

  <p>I was jest on the p&rsquo;int of throwing the kitchen stove on top of the
  pile, because I was gitting mad by this time, when a feller hit the porch
  outside on the run, and stuck his head and a shotgun into the door and
  hollered, &ldquo;Halt, in the name of the law!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who the devil air you?&rdquo; I demanded, rising up amidst a rooin
  of busted chairs, tables, canned goods and unconscious Watsons.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the sheriff,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;For the Lord&rsquo;s
  sake what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on here? You must be one of John McCoy&rsquo;s
  men!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Pike Bearfield of Wolf Mountain,&rdquo; I says, and he
  says, &ldquo;Well, anyway, yo&rsquo;re under arrest!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you was a fair-minded officer,&rdquo; I says, grinding my teeth
  slightly, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t think of resistin&rsquo; arrest. But I can
  see right off that yo&rsquo;re in league with the Watsons! This here&rsquo;s
  a plot to keep me from aidin&rsquo; my pore misguided uncle. I see now why
  these scoundrels come in here and picked a fight with me. But I&rsquo;ll foil
  you, by gum! A Bearfield couldn&rsquo;t git jestice in yore jailhouse, and I
  ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You air, too!&rdquo; he hollered, swinging up his shotgun. But I
  clapped my hand over the lock between the nipples and the hammers before he
  could pull the triggers, and I then taken hold of the barrels with my other
  hand and bent &rsquo;em at right angles.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now lemme see you try to shoot me with that gun,&rdquo; I says.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll explode and blow yore fool head off!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He wept with rage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll git even with you, you cussed outlaw!&rdquo; he
  promised. &ldquo;Yore derned uncle has run off and j&rsquo;ined John
  McCoy&rsquo;s bandits, and yo&rsquo;re one of his spies, I bet! You&rsquo;ve
  defied the law and rooint my new shotgun, and I&rsquo;ll have revenge if I
  have to sue you in the county court!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gah!&rdquo; I retorted in disgust, and stalked out in gloomy
  grandeur, emerging onto the street so sudden-like that the crowd which had
  gathered outside stampeded in all directions howling bloody murder. I never
  seen sech skittish folks. You&rsquo;d of thunk I was a tribe of
  Comanches.</p><br>

  <p>I headed for the wagon yard, and it was a good thing I got there when I
  did, because Sinclair&rsquo;s Defeat had got to fighting with Tom Hanson the
  yard owner&rsquo;s saddle pony, and when Tom come out with a pitchfork he bit
  a chunk outa him and run him into a stall where they was a yoke of oxen. The
  oxes hooked Tom and every time he crawled out Sinclair&rsquo;s Defeat kicked
  him back in again and the oxes taken another swipe at him. You oughta heard
  him holler.</p>

  <p>Well, Sinclair&rsquo;s Defeat was feeling so brash he thought he could
  lick me, too, so I give him a good punch on the nose and ontangled Tom from
  amongst the oxes. He bellyached plumb disgusting about gitting mulebit, so to
  shet him up I give him my last ten dollar bill. He also wanted me to pay for
  his britches which the oxes had hooked the seat out of, but I refused
  profanely and as soon as Sinclair&rsquo;s Defeat come to, I clumb onto him
  and headed out along the Choctaw Bayou road.</p>

  <p>I hadn&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n got outa town when I met a old coot legging it
  up the road on foot, with his whiskers flying in the wind. As soon as he seen
  me he hollered, &ldquo;Whar&rsquo;s the sheriff ? I got work for
  him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What kind of work?&rdquo; I ast, hit by a sudden suspicion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Larceny, kidnapin&rsquo; and a salt and batter,&rdquo; says he,
  stopping to git his breath whilst he fanned hisself with his old
  broad-brimmed straw hat. &ldquo;Golly, I&rsquo;m winded! My farm&rsquo;s
  three mile back in the piney woods and I&rsquo;ve run every step of the way!
  You know what? While ago I heered a arful racket out to my pigpen and I run
  out and who should I see but old Joab Hudkins tryin&rsquo; to rassle my prize
  Chester boar, Gen&rsquo;ral Braddock, over the fence! I sung out: &lsquo;Drap
  that defenseless animal, you cussed outlaw!&rsquo; and I&rsquo;d no
  more&rsquo;n got the words outa my mouth when old Joab up and hit me with a
  wagon spoke. . . . Looka here!&rdquo; he displayed a knot on his head about
  the size of a hen aig. &ldquo;When I come to,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;Joab was
  gone and so was Gen&rsquo;ral Braddock. Sech outrages ain&rsquo;t to be
  endured by American citerzens! I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; after the
  sheriff!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now wait,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;I dunno what&rsquo;s the matter
  with Uncle Joab, but le&rsquo;s see if we cain&rsquo;t straighten this out
  without draggin&rsquo; in the law&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me if yo&rsquo;re kin of his&rsquo;n!&rdquo;
  squalled he, stooping for a rock. &ldquo;Git outa my way! I&rsquo;ll have
  jestice if it&rsquo;s my last ack!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw, heck,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve knowed men to make less
  fuss over losin&rsquo; a thousand head of steers than yo&rsquo;re
  makin&rsquo; over one measly pig. I&rsquo;ll see that yo&rsquo;re paid for
  yore fool swine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Show me the dough!&rdquo; he demanded covetously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no money right now,
  but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;T&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t the money, it&rsquo;s the principle of the
  thing!&rdquo; he asserted. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t to be tromped on! Stand
  aside! I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; for the sheriff.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Over my dead carcass!&rdquo; I roared, losing patience. &ldquo;Dang
  yore stubborn old hide! Yo&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; with me till we find Uncle
  Joab and straighten this thing out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I leant down from my saddle and grabbed for him, and he give a squall and
  hit me in the head with his rock and turnt to run, but he stumped his toe and
  fell down, and that&rsquo;s when Sinclair&rsquo;s Defeat bit him in the seat
  of the britches. He&rsquo;s a liar when he says I told Sinclair&rsquo;s
  Defeat to bite him; it jest come natural for a mule. I reached down and
  grabbed him by the galluses&mdash;the old coot I mean, and not the
  mule&mdash;and heaved him up acrost the saddle horn in front of me, and he
  hollered, &ldquo;Halp! Murder! The McCoy gang got me in the toils!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Somebody echoed his howl, and I looked around and seen a barefooted kid
  with a fishing pole in his hand jest coming out of the footpath. His eyes was
  popping right out of his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Run for the sheriff, boy!&rdquo; squalled my captive. &ldquo;Git a
  posse!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So the kid scooted for town, howling, &ldquo;Halp! Halp! A outlaw is
  kidnapin&rsquo; old Ash Buckley!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Well, I had a suspicion things would be a mite warm around there purty
  soon, so I kicked Sinclair&rsquo;s Defeat in the ribs and he done a smart
  piece of skedaddling up that road. I run for maybe four miles till Ash
  Buckley&rsquo;s howls got onbearable. I never seen a human which was harder
  to please than that old buzzard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Set me down and lemme die easy!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;This
  cussed horn has pierced my vitals in front and I have got a mortal wound
  behind!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aw,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the mule jest bit off a little piece of
  hide, not any bigger&rsquo;n yore hand. You ain&rsquo;t hurt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dyin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he maintained fiercely.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll git even, you big monkey! I&rsquo;ll come back and
  ha&rsquo;nt you, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;hey!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I also give a startled yell, because out of the bresh ambled the most
  pecooliar looking critter I ever seen in my life. I reached for my pistol,
  but old Ash give a yowl like he&rsquo;d been stabbed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Gen&rsquo;ral Braddock!&rdquo; he shrieked.
  &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve shaved him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then I seen that the critter was a hawg which had wunst been white, but
  now he was as naked as a newborn babe! They warn&rsquo;t a bristle onto him;
  it was plumb ondecent. I was so surprised I let old Ash fall onto the ground,
  and he jumped up and started for Gen&rsquo;ral Braddock, saying,
  &ldquo;Sooey! Sooey! Come here, boy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Gen&rsquo;ral Braddock give a squeal and curled his tail and lit a
  shuck through the bresh.</p>

  <p>I jest sat my mule and looked. I couldn&rsquo;t move.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s plumb upsot,&rdquo; says old Ash, kinda stunned-like.
  &ldquo;Whoever heard of sech doins?&rdquo; Then he says, &ldquo;Make room for
  me on that mule! I aim to find Joab if it takes the rest of my life!
  Shavin&rsquo; a hawg is the craziest thing I ever heard of, and I won&rsquo;t
  rest easy till I know why he done it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I helped him on behind the saddle, and I says, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll we
  look for him? No use tryin&rsquo; to backtrack that pig. Neither hoss nor man
  could git through that thicket he come out of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I figger he&rsquo;s hidin&rsquo; out somewheres over on the
  Choctaw,&rdquo; says Ash. &ldquo;When he tried to steal the Watson hawgs I
  figgered he&rsquo;d gone wild and j&rsquo;ined the outlaws that hang out in
  the swamps over east of here, and was stealin&rsquo; pigs for the McCoys. But
  he must be jest plain crazy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll head for Uncle Esau Hawkins,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;and
  round up all the kinfolks and start combin&rsquo; the woods. By the way, who
  is these McCoys?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A gang of thieves and cutthroats which used to hang around
  here,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t been seen recent, and I figgers
  they&rsquo;ve skipped over into Louisiana. They had a hang-out somewhere in
  the piney woods and nobody never could find it. They ambushed three or four
  posses which went in after &rsquo;em&mdash;What you stoppin&rsquo;
  for?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>We was jest passing a path which crossed the road, and I seen hawg tracks
  going up it, and a man&rsquo;s tracks right behind, wide apart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Somebody chased a pig up that path right recent,&rdquo; I says, and
  turned up it at a lope.</p>

  <p>We hadn&rsquo;t went more&rsquo;n a mile till we heard a pig squealing. So
  I slipped off of Sinclair&rsquo;s Defeat and snuck through the bresh on foot
  till I come to a little clearing, and there was a white hawg tied up and
  laying on its side, and there was Uncle Joab Hudkins honing a butcher knife
  on his boot. A tub of soap suds stood nigh at hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Joab, air you crazy?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>

  <p>Uncle Joab give a startled yell and fell over backwards into the tub. Sech
  langwidge you never heard as I hauled him out with soap bubbles in his eyes
  and ears and mouth. Ash run up jest then.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Jake Peters&rsquo; sow!&rdquo; he hollered, dancing
  with excitement. &ldquo;I tell you, he&rsquo;s as crazy as a mudhen! You
  better tie him up!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You ontie the hawg,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take keer of
  Uncle Joab.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ontie that hawg!&rdquo; howled Uncle Joab.
  &ldquo;Gol-dern it, cain&rsquo;t a man tend to his own business without a
  passel of idjits buttin&rsquo; in?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be calm, Uncle Joab,&rdquo; I soothed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think
  this&rsquo;ll be permanent. Yore dad was wunst took like this, they say, and
  voted agen Sam Houston. But he recovered his sanity before the next election,
  and you probably will too. Jest when was you first seized with a urge to
  shave pigs?&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>At this Uncle Joab begun to display symptoms of vi&rsquo;lence, even to
  the extent of trying to stab me with his butcher knife. But I ignored his
  rudeness, also his biting me viciously in the hind laig whilst I was setting
  on him and twisting the knife outa his hand. I was as gentle as I could be
  with him, but he didn&rsquo;t have no gratitude, and his langwidge was plumb
  scandalous to hear.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heered a lick on the head will often kyore
  insanity,&rdquo; says Ash Buckley. &ldquo; &rsquo;Twon&rsquo;t hurt to try,
  anyhow. You hold him whilst I bust him over the dome with a rock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you tech me with no rock!&rdquo; yelled Uncle Joab.
  &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t crazy, gosh-hang you! I got a good reason for
  shavin&rsquo; them hawgs!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, why?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None of yore business,&rdquo; he sulked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I says with a sigh. &ldquo;All I see to do is to
  tie you up and take you over to Uncle Esau Hawkins. He can git a doctor for
  you, or maybe send you to Austin for observation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At that he give a convulsive heave and nearly got loose, but I sot on him
  and told Ash to go git my lariat off of my saddle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; says Uncle Joab. &ldquo;I know when I&rsquo;m
  licked. I wanted all the loot for myself, but if you&rsquo;ll git off of me,
  I&rsquo;ll tell you everything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What loot?&rdquo; I ast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The loot Cullen Baker&rsquo;s gang hid in Choctaw Bayou,&rdquo;
  says he.</p>

  <p>Old Ash pricked up his ears at that.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You mean to say yo&rsquo;re on the trail of that?&rdquo; he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am!&rdquo; asserted Uncle Joab. &ldquo;Listen! We all know that a
  few months before Baker was kilt, he robbed a train jest over the Louisiana
  line. He then come over here and hid the gold&mdash;a hundred thousand
  dollars&rsquo; wuth!&mdash;somewhar on Choctaw. Nobody knows whar, because
  right after that him and all the men which was with him when he hid it, got
  kilt over night. Jefferson, in 1869. They paid ten thousand dollars for his
  head in Little Rock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I been lookin&rsquo; for that plunder off and on for years,
  like everybody else around here, especially old Jeppard Wilkinson, which used
  to hold a grudge agen me account of me skinnin&rsquo; him in a mule swap. But
  I got a letter from him the other day, from New Orleans, and he said
  he&rsquo;d had a change of heart. He said before he left here he found where
  Baker&rsquo;s treasure was hid! But he was afeared to take it out, account of
  the McCoy gang which was huntin&rsquo; it too, and always follerin&rsquo; him
  around and spyin&rsquo; on him, so he drawed a map of the place and was
  waitin&rsquo; a chance to go back and git the loot, when he got run out of
  the country&mdash;you know, Ash, on account of the trouble he had with the
  Clantons&mdash;and now he says he wasn&rsquo;t never comin&rsquo; back, so if
  I could find the map the loot would be mine. And he said he tattooed the map
  on a white hawg! He said he reckon it run off into the woods after he left
  the country.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, whyn&rsquo;t you tell us all this in the first place?&rdquo;
  yelled old Ash. &ldquo;What air we waitin&rsquo; on? Pike, you hold this
  critter whilst me and Joab scrapes the bristles off. This may be the very
  hawg.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Well, I felt plumb silly helping shave a pig, but them old coots was
  serious. They like to have fit right in the middle of the job when they got
  to argying how they&rsquo;d divide the plunder. I told &rsquo;em they better
  wait till they found it before they divided it.</p>

  <p>Well, they shaved that critter from stem to stern, but not one mark did
  they find that looked like a map. But they warn&rsquo;t discouraged.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve shaved six already,&rdquo; says Uncle Joab. &ldquo;I aim
  to find that map if I have to shave every white hawg in the county. They
  ain&rsquo;t none been butchered since old Jeppard tattooed that&rsquo;n, so
  it&rsquo;s bound to be somewheres in these woods. Listen: I been livin&rsquo;
  in the old Sorley cabin over on the Choctaw. You all go over there with me,
  and we&rsquo;ll take up our camp there and work out from it. They ain&rsquo;t
  no settlements within a long ways of it, and all the pigs in the county comes
  over there to that oak grove about a mile from it to eat acorns. Won&rsquo;t
  be nobody to interfere with us, and we&rsquo;ll stay there and comb the woods
  till we finds the right hawg.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So we pulled out, taking turns riding and walking.</p><br>

  <p>We went through mighty wild, tangled, uninhabited country to git to that
  there cabin, which stood a few hundred yards from the bank of the Choctaw.
  Mostly we follered pig trails through the thickets. On the way Uncle Joab
  told us the McCoys used to hang out in them parts, and he bet they&rsquo;d
  show up again sometime when Louisiana got too hot for &rsquo;em, and start
  burning cabins and stealing and shooting folks from the bresh again. And Ash
  Buckley said he bet the sheriff of Sabineville wouldn&rsquo;t never catch
  &rsquo;em, and they got to talking about all the crimes them McCoys had
  committed, and I was plumb surprised to hear white men could ack like that.
  They was wuss&rsquo;n Apaches. They shore wouldn&rsquo;t of lasted long on
  Wolf Mountain.</p>

  <p>Well, we slept at the cabin that night and early next morning we scattered
  through the pine flats and cypress swamps looking for white hawgs. Uncle Joab
  told me not to git lost nor et up by a alligator. Shucks, you could lose a
  timber wolf as easy as a Bearfield, even in the piney woods, and the
  muskeeters worrit me more&rsquo;n the alligators.</p>

  <p>I didn&rsquo;t have no luck looking for white pigs. All I found was plain
  razorbacks. I finally got disgusted pulling through them swamps and thickets
  on foot, so about noontime I headed back for the cabin. And when I come out
  in the clearing I seen a man in the rail pen behind the cabin trying to rope
  Sinclair&rsquo;s Defeat. I hollered at him and he ducked and pulled a pistol
  out of his boot and taken a shot at me, and then ran off into the bresh.</p>

  <p>Well, I instantly knowed it was one of them dern Watsons trying to run off
  our stock and set us afoot so they could snipe us off at their leisure, so I
  taken in after him. They must of tracked us from Sabineville.</p>

  <p>He knowed the country better&rsquo;n I did, and he stayed ahead of me for
  three miles, heading south, but he couldn&rsquo;t shake me off, because us
  Bearfields learnt tracking from the Yaquis. I gained on him and warn&rsquo;t
  but a few yards behind him when he come into a clearing in the middle of the
  dangedest thicket I ever seen. A path had been cut through it with axes, but
  if I hadn&rsquo;t been follering his tracks I probably wouldn&rsquo;t never
  have found it, the mouth was so well hid, and not even a razorback could git
  through anywheres else.</p>

  <p>I taken a shot at him as he broke cover and legged it for a cabin in the
  clearing, and then I started after him; but three or four men opened up on me
  from the door with Winchesters, so I jumped back into the bresh. He ducked
  inside and they slammed the door.</p>

  <p>It was a hundred yards from the bresh to the cabin, and no cover for a man
  to crawl up clost. They&rsquo;d riddle him if he tried it. There warn&rsquo;t
  no winders, jest loopholes to shoot through, and the door looked arful thick.
  Leastways when I tried to shoot through it with my pistol the men inside
  hollered jeeringly and shot at me through the loopholes. The cabin was built
  up agen a big rock, the first of its size I&rsquo;d saw in that country, so
  they warn&rsquo;t no chance of storming &rsquo;em from the rear. It looked
  like they jest warn&rsquo;t no way of coming to grips with them devils.</p>

  <p>Then I seen smoke coming out of the top of the rock, and I knowed they had
  a fireplace built into the rock which formed the back wall of the cabin, and
  had tunneled out a chimney in the rock. I thought by golly, I bet if I was to
  climb up onto that rock from behind and drop a polecat down that chimney I
  could shoot all them Watsons as they run out.</p>

  <p>So I fired a few shots at the door, and then ducked low and snuck off. I
  figgered they&rsquo;d stay denned up till dark at least, thinking I was still
  laying for &rsquo;em outside, and by that time I could find me a skunk and
  git back with it. I was depending a lot on it. I notice the average man would
  rather run the risk of gitting shot than to stay denned up in a winderless
  cabin with a irritated polecat.</p><br>

  <p>But I looked and looked, and didn&rsquo;t find none, and it begun to git
  late, and all at once I thought by golly, I bet a alligator would have the
  same effect. The nearest way to the bayou was back by our cabin, so I headed
  that way.</p>

  <p>The cabin was empty when I went past it. Uncle Joab and Ash Buckley was
  still out looking for the tattooed hawg. I went on to the Bayou where
  I&rsquo;d heard a big bull beller the night before, and waded out in the
  water to find him, which I presently did by him grabbing me by the hind laig.
  So I waded to shore with him, him being too stubborn to let go, and suffering
  from the illusion that he could pull me out into deep water.</p>

  <p>Ain&rsquo;t it funny what fools some animals is? It&rsquo;s ideas like
  that proves their undoing.</p>

  <p>When he realized his error we was already in the shallers, so I pried him
  loose and got him under my arm and started for the bank with him. He then
  started swinging his tail up and hitting me in the back of the head with it,
  and it was wuss&rsquo;n being kicked by a mule. He knocked me down three
  times before I got out of the water, and nearly wiggled away from me each
  time, to say nothing of biting me severely in various places. They is nothing
  more stubborn than a old bull alligator.</p>

  <p>Finally I got so disgusted with him I hauled off with my fist and busted
  him betwixt the eyes, and whilst he was stunned I broke some vines and tied
  his laigs, and then I could carry him better. I called him Jedge Peabody
  because he looked so much like a jedge back in my country which would of
  fined me for shooting Jack Rackston wunst, only I wouldn&rsquo;t stand for no
  sech interference with my personal liberty.</p>

  <p>Well, I couldn&rsquo;t figger out no way to tie Jedge Peabody&rsquo;s
  tail, and he come to purty soon and started beating me in the neck with it
  again. It was gitting arful late by now, and I was afeared the Watsons would
  come out of their cabin and find me gone. So I decided to stop off at our
  cabin and then ride back instead of going afoot. I figgered to have some
  trouble with Sinclair&rsquo;s Defeat when I put Jedge Peabody on his back,
  but I &rsquo;lowed I could persuade him.</p>

  <p>So I taken Jedge Peabody up to our cabin and laid him on my bunk to keep
  him safe till I saddled up. The sun was already outa sight behind the pines
  and the long shadders was streaming acrost the clearing. It was purty dark in
  the cabin and you could hardly see Jedge Peabody at all.</p>

  <p>Well, I went to the hoss pen and grabbed my saddle, but before I could
  throw it on, I seen Uncle Joab cross the clearing from the east and go into
  the cabin. I started to call to him, but the next instant he give a arful
  screech and come busting out of there so fast he tripped and slid on his nose
  for about three yards.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Halp! Murder! The Devil hisself &rsquo;s in that cabin!&rdquo; he
  screamed, and bounced up and streaked for the tall timber.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Joab, come back!&rdquo; I yelled, jumping the pen fence and
  lighting out after him. &ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t nobody but Jedge
  Peabody!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>But he jest yelled that much louder and put on more speed. I reckon Jedge
  Peabody did look kind of uncanny to come onto him unexpected in that dark
  corner where you couldn&rsquo;t see much but his big red eyes. Uncle Joab
  didn&rsquo;t even look back, and when he heard me crashing through the bresh
  right behind him, he evidently thought the devil was chasing him, because he
  let out some more arful screams and jest went a-kiting.</p>

  <p>It was dark under the trees, and I reckon that&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t
  see that gully in front of him, anyway, he suddenly vanished from sight with
  a crash and a howl. Then they busted out an arful squealing and out of the
  gully come the biggest white hawg I ever seen in my life. And Uncle Joab was
  astraddle of him, having evidently fell on him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop him!&rdquo; howled Uncle Joab, hanging on for his life,
  afeared to let go and afeared to hold on. That hawg was headed back the way
  we&rsquo;d come, and he went past me like a bullet. I grabbed for him, but
  all I done was tear off Uncle Joab&rsquo;s shirt. That hawg went through the
  bresh like a quarter hoss, and the way Uncle Joab hollered was a caution when
  the limbs scratched him and slapped him in the face.</p>

  <p>Well, a Bearfield ain&rsquo;t to be outdid by man nor beast, so I sot
  myself to run down that fool hawg on foot. And I was gaining on him, too,
  when we reached the cabin. But as we busted into the clearing I heard a most
  amazing racket in the cabin and seen Ash Buckley perched in a tree, plumb
  wild-eyed.</p>

  <p>I was so astonished I didn&rsquo;t look where I was going and tripped over
  a root and nearly busted my brains out, and when I got up, Uncle Joab and the
  hawg was clean out of sight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What the devil?&rdquo; I demanded profanely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I dunno!&rdquo; hollered old Ash. &ldquo;Jest as I come up awhile
  ago I seen a gang of men sneakin&rsquo; into the cabin, so I hid and watched.
  They shet the door and I heard one of &rsquo;em holler: &lsquo;That must be
  him layin&rsquo; on that bunk over there. Grab him!&rsquo; Then that racket
  started. It&rsquo;s been goin&rsquo; on for fifteen minutes. What&rsquo;s
  that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It sounded like a mule kicking slats out of a shed wall, but I knowed it
  was Jedge Peabody hitting the Watsons in the head with his tail. Them
  scoundrels had evidently come to raid our cabin, and Jedge Peabody had busted
  loose when they grabbed him, thinking he was me.</p>

  <p>I run over to the door jest as it was busted down from inside, and a gang
  of men come piling out. I hit each one on the jaw as he come out, and throwed
  him to one side till I had seven men laying there, out cold. The last one to
  come out had Jedge Peabody hanging onto the seat of his britches, and when
  old Ash seen Jedge Peabody he give a shriek and fell outa the tree and would
  probably of broke his neck if his galluses hadn&rsquo;t catched on a
  limb.</p>

  <p>The last Watson I knocked stiff had a scarred face and was about the
  meanest-looking cuss I ever seen. He was tough, too. I had to hit him twice.
  I was expecting a tussle with Jedge Peabody, too, but as soon as he seen me
  he let go of his victim&rsquo;s pants and scuttled for the creek as fast as
  he could go. I never seen a &rsquo;gator run like him.</p>

  <p>Ash was yelling for me to help him down, but they was more important work
  to do, so I run and got my lariat and tied them Watsons up before they could
  come to and rolled &rsquo;em into the cabin. Then I started towards the tree
  to git Ash loose, when somebody says, &ldquo;Hands up!&rdquo; and whirled
  around and faced the sheriff and fifty men, all of which was aiming shotguns
  at me.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo; says the sheriff, which was weighted down
  with hand-cuffs and laig-irons and chains till he couldn&rsquo;t hardly walk.
  &ldquo;We got you kivered, Bearfield! Them guns is all loaded with buckshot
  and railroad spikes! We got you cold! Where&rsquo;s Ash Buckley?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Right up over yore fool heads,&rdquo; says Ash fiercely, which
  startled the posse so bad they nigh jumped outa their skins and four or five
  of &rsquo;em shot at him before they seen who it was. &ldquo;Stop that, you
  nitwits!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Lemme down before I has a rush of blood
  to the head!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Warn&rsquo;t you kidnaped?&rdquo; ast the sheriff, dumbfounded, and
  Ash snarled, &ldquo;No, I warn&rsquo;t! Me and Pike and Joab come out here on
  private business!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>The sheriff cussed something fierce, but the posse started helping Ash
  down, when we heard somebody hollering for help off to the west, and they
  dropped Ash on his head and grabbed their guns and says, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
  that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Uncle Joab!&rdquo; I bellered, and made a break for the
  bresh, with Ash right behind me. Some of &rsquo;em shot at me, but they
  missed, and jest then I heard one of &rsquo;em yell, &ldquo;Sheriff, come
  here quick! The cabin&rsquo;s full of men tied hand and foot!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Every second I expected to hear &rsquo;em pursuing us, but we didn&rsquo;t
  hear &rsquo;em, and purty soon we almost fell over Uncle Joab in the dusk. He
  was trying to rassle the white hawg over on its side, whilst squalling,
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the one! I can see the tattoo marks through the
  bristles!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Well, so could we, in spite of the dusk, and old Ash like to collapsed
  with excitement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Grab that hawg, Pike!&rdquo; he screamed, lugging out a handful of
  matches. &ldquo;Cullen Baker&rsquo;s loot is right in our meat
  hooks!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So I helt the hawg and Uncle Joab made a swipe with his butcher knife, and
  panted, &ldquo;Strike a match quick, Ash! &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t a
  map&mdash;it&rsquo;s writin&rsquo;, but I cain&rsquo;t read it by this light!
  Strike a light!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Ash struck a match and helt it clost whilst we jammed our three heads
  together to read what was tattooed on that hawg&rsquo;s hide. And then Ash
  and Uncle Joab give a howl that jolted the cones outa the pines. The words
  tattooed on that hawg was, &ldquo;April fule! The joaks on you, you old
  jackass. <span class="smcap">jeppard wilkinson</span>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I let go of the hawg and it went kiting and squealing off into the bresh,
  and we sot there in bitter silence for a long time.</p><br>

  <p>This silence was busted by the sheriff suddenly sticking his head through
  the bushes, and saying, &ldquo;What the devil air you all
  doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I ain&rsquo;t bein&rsquo; arrested,&rdquo; I says vengefully,
  gitting to my feet and drawing my pistol. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you for yore
  shotgun, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I got no charge,&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;Bein&rsquo; as you
  didn&rsquo;t kidnap Ash there, and as for the Watsons&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That reminds me,&rdquo; I interrupted. &ldquo;I got seven of them
  skunks tied up back at the cabin. They tried to steal my mule and murder me
  in my sleep, but I won&rsquo;t make no charges agen &rsquo;em if
  they&rsquo;ll drop that pig stealin&rsquo; case.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, heck!&rdquo; says he. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve already dropped
  that charge! When old Jabez come to he &rsquo;lowed all he wanted with yore
  clan was peace, and plenty of it! He says they can lick the Hudkinses any
  day, but when they rings in a Bearfield on &rsquo;em, they got more&rsquo;n
  enough! Them fellers you got tied up back there&mdash;and which the boys is
  now loadin&rsquo; with the irons I brung for you&mdash;they ain&rsquo;t
  Watsons!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, who is they, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says he, taking a chaw of plug tobaccer, &ldquo;nobody
  but John McCoy and his gang which recent come back from Louisiana! Son, you
  can have anything in this county! Hey, where you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Home,&rdquo; I says in disgust, &ldquo;where a man can depend on a
  feud bein&rsquo; fought to a finish, and one side don&rsquo;t back out jest
  because a few of &rsquo;em gits their heads busted!&rdquo;</p></p>
