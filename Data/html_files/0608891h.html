  <h2><a name="chap1"
     id="chap1">I.</a> &mdash; ENCOUNTERING DARKNESS</h2>

  <p class="first">Roger Ingram's peroration broke over the silent dining hall:
  "He and such as he are one with the great conquerors, the great scientists,
  the great poets; they have all of them cried of the unknown: 'I will
  encounter darkness as a bride, And hug it in mine arms'."</p>

  <p>He sat down amid applause, directed not to him but to the subject of his
  speech. It was at a dinner given by the Geographical Faculty of the
  University of London to a distinguished explorer just back from South
  America. The explorer's health had been proposed by the Dean of the Faculty,
  and the Professor of Tropical Geography had been intended to second it.
  Unfortunately the Professor had gone down with influenza that very day, and
  Roger had been hastily made to take his place. The other geographical
  professors, though vocationally more suitable, were both learned and
  low-voiced, as also were their public addresses. The Dean had refused to
  subject his distinguished guests, including the explorer, to their
  instructive whispers. Roger might not be a geographer, but he could make a
  better speech, and he belonged to the University if to a different faculty,
  being Professor of Applied Literature. This was a new Chair, endowed
  beneficently by a rich Canadian who desired at once to benefit the Mother
  Country and to recall her from the by-ways of pure art to the highroad of art
  as related to action. Roger had been invited from a post in a Northern
  University to fill the Chair, largely on the strength of his last book, which
  was called "Persuasive Serpents: studies in English Criticism", and had been
  read with admiration by twenty-seven persons and with complete
  misunderstanding by four hundred and eighty-two. Its theme, briefly, was that
  most English critics had at all times been wholly and entirely wrong in their
  methods and aims, and that criticism was an almost undiscovered art, being a
  final austere harmony produced by the purification of literature from
  everything alien, which must still exist in the subjects of most prose and
  poetry. However, the salary of the Chair of Applied Literature had decided
  him to give an example of it in his own person, and he had accepted.</p>

  <p>He lent an ear, when the toast had been drunk, to his wife's "Beautiful,
  Roger: he loved it", and to Sir Bernard Travers' murmured "Hug?"</p>

  <p>"I know," he said; "you wouldn't hug it. You'd ask it to a light but good
  dinner and send it away all pale and comfortable. I was good, wasn't I,
  Isabel? A little purple, but pleasing purple. Pleasing purple for pleased
  people&mdash;that's me after dinner." He composed himself to listen.</p>

  <p>The explorer, returning thanks, was not indisposed to accept literally the
  compliments which had been offered him. He touched on ordinary lives, on the
  conditions of ordinary lives, on the ordinary office clerk, and on the
  difference between such a man and himself. He painted a picture of South
  America in black and scarlet; Roger remarked to his wife in a whisper that
  crude scarlet was the worst colour to put beside rich purple. He enlarged on
  the heroism of his companions with an under-lying suggestion that it was
  largely maintained by his own. He made a joke at the expense of Roger's
  quotation, saying that he would never apply "for a divorce or even a judicial
  separation from the bride Mr. Ingram has found me." Roger gnashed his teeth
  and smiled back politely, muttering "He isn't worth Macaulay and I gave him
  Shakespeare." He would, in short, have been a bore, had he not been
  himself.</p>

  <p>At last he sat down. Sir Bernard, politely applauding, said: "Roger, why
  are the English no good at oratory?"</p>

  <p>"Because&mdash;to do the fool justice&mdash;they prefer to explore," Roger
  said. "You can't be a poet and an orator too: it needs a different kind of
  consciousness."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard left off applauding; he said: "Roger why are the English so
  good at oratory?"</p>

  <p>"No," Roger said, "anything in reason, but not that. They aren't, you
  know."</p>

  <p>"Need that prevent you finding a reason why they are?" Sir Bernard
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Roger answered, "but it'd prevent you believing it. I
  wish I were making all the speeches to-night; I'm going to be bored. Isabel,
  shall we go?"</p>

  <p>"Rather not," Isabel said. "They're going to propose the health of the
  guests. I'm a guest. Mr. Nigel Considine will reply. Who's Mr. Nigel
  Considine?"</p>

  <p>"A rich man, that's all I know," said her husband. "He gave a collection
  of African images to the anthropological school, and endowed a lectureship on
  &mdash;what was it?&mdash;on Ritual Transmutations of Energy. As a matter of
  fact, I fancy there was some trouble about it, because he wanted one man in
  it and the University wanted another. They didn't know anything about his
  man."</p>

  <p>"And what did they know of their own?" Sir Bernard put in.</p>

  <p>"They knew he'd been at Birmingham or Leeds or somewhere&mdash;all quite
  proper," Roger answered, "and had written a book on the marriage rites of the
  indigenous Caribs or some such people. He wasn't married himself, and he'd
  never been a Carib&mdash;at least not so far as was known. Considine's man
  was a native of Africa, so the Dean was afraid he might start ritually
  transmuting energy in the lecture-room."</p>

  <p>"Was Mr. Considine annoyed?" Isabel asked.</p>

  <p>"Apparently not, as he's here to-night," Roger answered. "Unless he's
  going to get his own back now. But I never met him, and never got nearer to
  him than his collection of images." His voice became more serious, "They were
  frightfully impressive."</p>

  <p>"The adjective being emphatic or colloquial?" Sir Bernard asked, and was
  interrupted by the health of the guests. He was a little startled to find
  that he himself was still considered important enough to be mentioned by name
  in the speech that proposed it. He had, in fact, been a distinguished figure
  in the medical world of his day: he had written a book on the digestive
  organs which had become a classic, in spite of the ironic humour with which
  he always spoke of it. He had attended the stomachs of High Personages, and
  had retired from active life only the year before, after accepting a
  knighthood with an equally serious irony.</p>

  <p>Mr. Nigel Considine, on behalf of the guests, thanked their hosts. The
  chief of those guests, the guest of honour, of honour in actual truth, had
  already spoken. The intellectual value of the journey which they had
  celebrated was certainly very high, and very valuable to the scientific
  knowledge of the world which was so rapidly growing. "Yet," the full voice
  went on, "yet, if I hesitated at all at the view which the most prominent
  guest to-night took of his own fine achievement"&mdash;Roger's eyes flashed
  up and down again&mdash;"it would have been over one implication which he
  seemed to make. He set before us the wonder and terror of those remote parts
  of the world which he has been instrumental in helping to map out. Birds and
  beasts, trees and flowers, all kinds of non-human life, he admirably
  described. But the human life he appeared to regard as negligible. There is,
  it seems, nothing for us of Europe to learn from them, except perhaps how to
  starve on a few roots or to weave boughs into a shelter. It may be so. But I
  think we should not be too certain of it. He spoke of some of these peoples
  as being like children; he will pardon me if I dreamed of an old man
  wandering among children. For the children are growing, and the old man is
  dying. We who are here to-night are here as the servants and the guests of a
  great University, a University of knowledge, scholarship, and intellect. You
  do well to be proud of it. But I have wondered whether there may not be
  colleges and faculties of other experiences than yours, and whether even now
  in the far corners of other continents powers not yours are being brought to
  fruition. I have myself been something of a traveller, and every time I
  return to England I wonder whether the games of those children do not hold a
  more intense life than the talk of your learned men&mdash;a more intense
  passion for discovery, a greater power of exploration, new raptures, unknown
  paths of glorious knowledge; whether you may not yet sit at the feet of the
  natives of the Amazon or the Zambesi: whether the fakirs, the herdsmen, the
  witch-doctors may not enter the kingdom of man before you. But, however this
  may be, it is not&mdash;" He turned gracefully to renewed thanks and
  compliments, and sat down.</p>

  <p>"Dotty," said Roger, "but unusual. The transmutation of energy must have
  been biting him pretty badly. I suppose all that was a get-back."</p>

  <p>"It sounded awfully thrilling," Isabel said. "What did he mean?"</p>

  <p>"My good child, how should I know?" her husband asked plaintively. "The
  witch-doctors may. Fancy a witch-doctor entering the kingdom of man before
  Sir Bernard! Rude of him. Sir Bernard, what did you think of it?"</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard turned thoughtful eyes on Roger. "I can't remember," he said,
  "where I've seen your Mr. Considine before."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you haven't," Roger answered, "in which case you naturally
  wouldn't remember."</p>

  <p>"O but I have," Sir Bernard said positively. "I have; just lately. I
  remember the way he curved his fingers. I can't think where."</p>

  <p>"An unknown path of glorious knowledge," Isabel murmured. "The Dean of
  Geography looks quite annoyed."</p>

  <p>"He's thinking of the other things that are being brought to fruition,"
  Roger said, "all about South America. And of the old man who is dying. D'you
  think Considine meant any one special? or just as a whole?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think it was very nice of him," Isabel said. "People might take
  it the wrong way."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you know how to take it the right way..." her husband protested.
  "I suppose he meant something? O heavens, they're beginning again."</p>

  <p>They were, but also they were approaching the end. The dinner hovered over
  the point at which empty chairs begin to appear, and people misjudge their
  moment and tiptoe out at the beginning of a speech, and others reckon the
  chances of catching their distant friends before they are gone. At this point
  every dinner contends with destiny, and if it is fortunate concludes in a
  rapid and ecstatic climax; if it is unfortunate it drags out a lingering
  death, and enters afterwards a shuddering oblivion. This dinner was
  fortunate. The National Anthem implored Deity on behalf of royalty, and
  dismissed many incredulous of both. Sir Bernard accompanied Isabel from the
  room. Ingram, buttonholed by a colleague or two, was delayed till most of
  those present had gone, and when he reached the cloak-room counter, he found
  it, but for himself, deserted. He was waiting a little impatiently for his
  things when a voice behind him spoke. "And with what passion, Mr. Ingram," it
  said, "do you yourself encounter darkness?"</p>

  <p>Roger turned and saw Nigel Considine. They had been some distance apart at
  the dinner, and on the same side of the same table, so that Considine's
  personality had not been in play except through his rather obscure words.
  Now, as they stood so near, Roger was surprised to find himself taken aback
  by the other's face and bearing. He was not as a rule easily impressed by
  those he met; he had far too good an opinion of himself. But here... He saw a
  man of apparently about fifty, tall, well-proportioned, clean-shaven, with a
  good forehead and a good chin. But it was neither forehead nor chin that held
  Ingram; it was the eyes. He thought of the word "smouldering," and almost as
  quickly cursed himself for thinking of it; it was such a hateful word, only
  it was the most accurate. Something, repressed and controlled but vivid, was
  living in them; they corresponded, in their flickering intensity, to a voice
  that vibrated with some similar controlled ardour. The word "darkness" as it
  was uttered called to him as it did in the lines he had quoted; he felt as if
  he were looking at the thing itself. He began to speak, stammered on a
  syllable, and at last said helplessly: "I? darkness?"</p>

  <p>"You spoke of it familiarly," the other said. "You used her language."</p>

  <p>Roger pulled himself together; he answered with a slight hostility. "If
  you mean my one Shakespearean quotation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Isn't that just darkness making itself known?" Considine asked. "Or do
  you use apposite quotation merely as a social convenience?"</p>

  <p>Roger felt ridiculously helpless, as if a believer accustomed to infidels
  were suddenly confronted by a fanatic of his own creed. But the implied sneer
  stung him, and he said sharply, "I don't quote."</p>

  <p>"I believe that&mdash;because of your voice," the other answered. "You
  must forgive me if I was offensive; could I help wondering if you really made
  that rapturous cry your own?"</p>

  <p>He allowed the attendant to help him on with his coat as he spoke. Roger's
  own things lay neglected on the counter, and the other attendant waited by
  them. Roger himself was absurdly conscious of the presence of those two
  auditors. He had often talked highly in similar circumstances before, not
  theatrically certainly but with a sardonic consciousness that the subservient
  listeners probably thought him a little mad, with the slight enjoyment of
  being too much for them, with an equally slight but equally definite and
  continuous despair that words which meant so much to him meant so little to
  others. But Considine was speaking perfectly naturally, only always with that
  sounding depth of significance in his voice.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you liked it," Roger said foolishly.</p>

  <p>Considine said nothing at all to this, and Roger became instantly
  conscious of the fatuity of the words. "Rapturous cry"... "glad you liked
  it." Ass! "No, really," he said very hastily, "I mean... I did really mean
  it. I mean I do like poetry. Good God!" he thought to himself, "if my classes
  could hear me now."</p>

  <p>Hatted and gloved, Considine turned to him. "You are a little afraid of
  it, I think," he said. "Or else you have spoken your beliefs very
  little."</p>

  <p>"Nobody cares about it," Roger said, "and I mock at myself, God forgive
  me, because there's nothing else to do."</p>

  <p>They were moving together out of the cloakroom.</p>

  <p>"There's much else to do," Considine answered, "and I think you believe
  that; I think you dare encounter darkness."</p>

  <p>He raised his hand in salutation. Isabel was ready waiting with Sir
  Bernard, but before he joined them Roger stood still watching Considine going
  towards the door, and when at last he came to them he was still troubled.</p>

  <p>"Darling, what's the matter?" Isabel said. "You're looking very
  gloomy."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Considine's been talking of the fakirs," Sir Bernard said, "and
  Roger's wondering if he's one."</p>

  <p>Roger regarded them for a moment and then made an effort to recover
  himself. "I don't mind telling you," he answered, "that Mr. Considine has
  played me entirely off my own stage in my own play, and I didn't think there
  was a man living who could do that."</p>

  <p>"Elucidate," Sir Bernard said.</p>

  <p>"I shan't elucidate," Ingram answered. "I don't see why I should be the
  only fellow to encounter darkness. D'you want a taxi, Sir Bernard?"</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard did, and after having parted from the Ingrams and entered it,
  he lay back and tried once more to remember where he had seen Considine. It
  was quite recently, and yet he had a vague feeling that it wasn't recently.
  An idea of yesterday and an idea of many years ago conflicted in his mind
  &mdash;a man with his hand a little lifted, almost as if it contained and
  controlled power, a hand of energy in rest. Perhaps, he thought, it was the
  theme of the speeches which had misled him; they had been listening to talk
  about distant places, and perhaps his mind had transferred that distance to
  time. It must have been yesterday or he wouldn't remember so clearly. It
  couldn't have been long ago or Considine, who was obviously younger than his
  own sixty odd years, would have changed. His gesture mightn't have changed,
  all the same&mdash;well, it didn't matter. As he got out at his Kensington
  house he reflected that it would come back, of course; sooner or later the
  pattern of his knowledge would bring that little detail to his mind. The
  intellect hardly ever failed one eventually, if one fulfilled the conditions
  it imposed. But it did perhaps rather ignore the immediate necessities of
  ordinary life; in its own pure life it overlooked the "Now and here" of one's
  daily wishes. Still, his own was very good to him; with a happy gratitude to
  it he came into the library, where he found his son reading letters.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Philip!" he said. "Had a good evening? How's Rosamond?"</p>

  <p>"Very fit, thanks," Philip answered. "Did you have a good time?"</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard nodded, and sat down leisurely. "Roger told us how he liked
  poetry," he said, "and the explorer told us how he liked himself, and Mr.
  Nigel Considine told us how he disliked the University."</p>

  <p>"Not in so many words?" Philip asked.</p>

  <p>"Contrapuntal," Sir Bernard said. "When you've heard as many speeches as I
  have, you'll find that's the only interest in them: the intermingling of the
  theme proposed and the theme actual."</p>

  <p>"I can never make out whether Roger's serious," Philip said. "He seems to
  be getting at one the whole time. Rosamond feels it too."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard thought it very likely. Rosamond Murchison was Isabel's sister
  and Roger's sister-in-law, but only in law. Rosamond privately felt that
  Roger was conceited and not quite nice; Roger, less privately, felt that
  Rosamond was stuckup and not quite intelligent. When, as at present, she was
  staying with the Ingrams in Hampstead, it was only by Isabel's embracing
  sympathy that tolerable relations were maintained. Sir Bernard almost wished
  that Philip could have got engaged to someone else. He was very fond of his
  son, and he was afraid that the approaching marriage would make, at the times
  when he visited them, an atmosphere in which, but for brief intervals, he
  would find it impossible to breathe. Philip's mind by itself was at present
  earnest and persevering, if a trifle slow. But Philip's mind surrounded and
  closed in by Rosamond's promised, so far as he could see, to become merely
  static. He looked over at his son.</p>

  <p>"Roger's serious enough," he said. "But he still expects to get direct
  results instead of indirect. He never realizes that the real result of
  anything is always round the corner."</p>

  <p>"What corner?" Philip asked.</p>

  <p>"The universal corner", Sir Bernard said, "around which we are always on
  the point of turning&mdash;into a street where there are all the numbers
  except that of the house we're looking for. Good heavens, I'm becoming
  philosophical. That's the result of University dinners."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I quite follow you," Philip said.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't at all matter," Sir Bernard answered. "I only meant that I
  should like you to believe that Roger's quite serious, and a little
  unhappy."</p>

  <p>"Unhappy!" Philip exclaimed. "Roger! "</p>

  <p>"Certainly unhappy," Sir Bernard said. "He's fanatic enough to believe
  passionately and not sufficiently fanatical to believe that other people
  ought to believe. Naturally also, being young, he thinks his own belief is
  the only real way of salvation, though he'd deny that if you asked him. So
  he's in a continual unsuccessful emotional conflict, and therefore he's
  unhappy."</p>

  <p>"But I don't understand," Philip said. "Roger never goes to church. What
  does he believe in?"</p>

  <p>"Poetry," Sir Bernard answered, and "O&mdash;poetry!" Philip exclaimed; "I
  thought you meant something religious. I don't see why poetry should make him
  unhappy."</p>

  <p>"Try living in a world where everyone says to you, quite insincerely, 'O
  isn't Miss Murchison charming!'" his father said drily. "Or alternatively, 'I
  can't think what you see in her.' And then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was interrupted by the entrance of a third person.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Ian," he broke off; "how's the Archbishop?"</p>

  <p>Ian Caithness was the vicar of a Yorkshire parish and Philip's godfather.
  He was a tall man of about Sir Bernard's age and looked like an ascetic
  priest, which was more by good luck than by merit, for he practised no
  extreme austerities. But he took life seriously, and (as often happens)
  attributed his temperament to his religion. He was therefore not entirely
  comfortable with other people of different temperaments who did the same
  thing, and a lifelong friendship with Sir Bernard had probably survived
  because the other remained delicately poised in a philosophy outside the
  Church. As a Christian Sir Bernard would have probably irritated his friend
  intolerably; he soothed him as a&mdash;it was difficult to say what; Sir
  Bernard occasionally alluded to himself as a neo-Christian, "meaning," he
  said, "like most neos, one who takes the advantages without the
  disadvantages. As Neo-Platonist, neo-Thomist, and neolithic too, for all I
  know." On the rare occasions when Caithness came to London he always stopped
  in Kensington; on the still rarer when Sir Bernard went to Yorkshire he
  always went to church.</p>

  <p>"Rather bothered," Caithness said in answer to his friend's greeting. "The
  Government papers are making capital out of the massacres of the missions,
  and demanding expeditions."</p>

  <p>"What massacres?" Philip asked in surprise. "Being down in Dorset for a
  couple of weeks has cut away the papers."</p>

  <p>"There've been a number of simultaneous native risings in the interior of
  Africa," Caithness answered absently, "and so far as we can hear the
  Christian missionaries have been killed. The Archbishop's very anxious that
  the Government shan't use that as a reason for military operations."</p>

  <p>"Why ever not?" Philip said staring.</p>

  <p>Caithness made an abrupt gesture with his hand. "Because it is their duty,
  their honour, to die, if necessary," he said; "it is a condition of their
  calling. Because the martyrs of the Church must not be avenged by secular
  arms."</p>

  <p>"A very unusual view for the Church to take," Sir Bernard murmured.
  "Normally... It's a curious business altogether. I was told this afternoon
  that the Khedive has left Cairo for a British warship. Roger's
  anthropological idols getting active, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"The pressure on Egypt must be pretty bad, then," Caithness said. "Well,
  that isn't our business. We can't, of course, object to any steps the
  Government think it wise to take in their own interests, so long as they
  don't use the missions as a reason. The Archbishop has intimated to the
  Societies who sent them out that no material ought to be given to the papers
  &mdash;photographs or what not."</p>

  <p>"Photographs!" Sir Bernard exclaimed suddenly. "It was&mdash;of course, it
  was. My mind would have done it, Ian, but thank you for helping it." He got
  up and went across the room to a drawer in the lower part of one of the
  bookcases, whence he returned carrying a number of old yellowish photographic
  prints. Out of these as he turned them over he selected one, and sat down
  again.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he said, "I was looking through these a day or two ago: that
  was what fidgeted me all the time Considine was telling us about old men and
  children. And if that isn't Considine... he's got his fingers curved in
  exactly the same way that he had to-night."</p>

  <p>Philip moved round and looked over his father's shoulder. The photograph
  showed two men, one of about seventy, the other some twenty years or so
  younger, sitting in basket chairs on a lawn with the corner of a verandah
  showing behind them. The clothes were late Victorian; the whole picture was
  Victorianly idyllic. Philip saw nothing surprising about it.</p>

  <p>"Which is your Mr. Considine?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The one on the right," Sir Bernard answered. "It's an exact likeness.
  When he was speaking to-night he had his head up and his fingers out and
  coiled just like that. And he wasn't a day older."</p>

  <p>"Who's the other man?" Philip asked.</p>

  <p>"The other man", Sir Bernard answered, leaning back in his chair and
  looking thoughtfully at the photograph, "is my grandfather. My grandfather
  died in 1886."</p>

  <p>"Um!" said Philip. "Then of course it can't be your Mr. Considine. He
  looks about fifty there, which would make him over a hundred now. His father,
  I suppose."</p>

  <p>"It's the most unusual likeness I ever saw, if it's his father, or his
  grandfather, or his great-uncle, or his first, second, third or fourth
  cousin," Sir Bernard protested.</p>

  <p>"But it must be," Philip said. "You don't suggest that this is Considine,
  do you?"</p>

  <p>"The probabilities against it are heavy," his father allowed. "But aren't
  the probabilities against two men looking so much alike also heavy?"</p>

  <p>Philip smiled. "But where one thing's impossible the other must be true,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>"And which is impossible?" Sir Bernard asked perversely.</p>

  <p>"O come," Philip protested. "If the other figure here is your grandfather
  this photograph must have been taken before 1886. So it's impossible&mdash;or
  very, very unlikely that the other man is still alive, and he certainly
  wouldn't be speaking at a dinner. Is it likely? Do you know who took the
  photograph, by the way?"</p>

  <p>"I took it myself," the other said. "With my own little camera. Given me
  on my twelfth birthday. By my grandfather. I was staying with him for the
  summer."</p>

  <p>"You don't remember who this other man was?"</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard shook his head. "I remember being very pleased with the
  camera. And I remember that various people stayed at the house. And I
  photographed every one I could. But what he called himself then I couldn't
  say."</p>

  <p>"But if it was Considine then he'd be a hundred or more by now! Did he
  look it?"</p>

  <p>"If he looked it," said Sir Bernard, "I shouldn't be staring at this
  photograph. No, Philip, you're right of course. But it's unusual."</p>

  <p>"It must have been," Philip agreed.</p>

  <p>"Though if a man's nerves and stomach were sound," his father went on,
  "and if he kept himself fit, and had no accidents&mdash;on my word, mightn't
  he look fifty when he was really a hundred? Perhaps he's found the elixir of
  life in the swamps of the Zambesi."</p>

  <p>Philip felt the conversation was becoming absurd. "If you take it that
  it's his father and that there's a strong family likeness, I don't see that
  there's any difficulty," he said.</p>

  <p>"I know," Sir Bernard answered. "But I want there to be a difficulty. So I
  want that photograph to be a photograph of him and not of his wife's maiden
  aunt or whatever you suggested. You needn't look superior. It's exactly the
  way most people come to believe in religion. And if most people think like
  that, there must be something in it, Cogitatio populi, cogitatio Dei..., and
  so forth. O well, I shall go to bed. Perhaps I shall meet Mr. Considine again
  one day and be able to ask him. Good-night, Philip, good-night, Ian. Wake me
  if the Africans come."</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chap2"
     id="chap2">II.</a> &mdash; SUICIDE WHILE OF UNSOUND MIND</h2>

  <p class="first">Philip was down the next morning before his father or his
  godfather, urged by a very strong anxiety to see the papers. Trouble in
  Africa, as it happened, was possibly going to affect not merely high national
  and political affairs but his own personal arrangements. Africa, of course,
  was a large place, and the Christian missions had been established he had
  gathered, somewhere in the centre; he wasn't much disturbed over them. But
  what his father had called "the pressure on Egypt" was another matter.
  Philip's own job was engineering, and he had not long before come to an
  arrangement with a business company known as "The North African Rivers
  Development Syndicate," by which he was to go out to whatever North African
  Rivers were to be developed as assistant constructing engineer. His chief, a
  man named Munro, was already out there, somewhere in Nigeria, and in a couple
  of months Philip was to join him. Meanwhile he was putting in some time at
  the London offices of the Syndicate, which was run by two brothers named
  Stuyvesant. But though these were the official heads it was generally
  understood in the City that the real force behind the company was a much
  richer man, a certain Simon Rosenberg, who, among his interests in railways
  and periodicals and fisheries and dyeworks, in South African diamonds and
  Persian oils and Chinese silks, in textiles and cereals and patent-medicines,
  rubber and coffee and wool, among all these had cast a careless eye on
  African rivers. In that side of the business Philip wasn't very interested.
  Sir Bernard had satisfied himself that the company was as sound as could
  reasonably be expected, and a year's work&mdash;or perhaps even two
  years&mdash;would give Philip a start in his profession. Then he would, all
  being well, come home and marry Rosamond, and see what jobs were going at
  home. Munro was a fairly big man and if Munro gave him a good word ...</p>

  <p>It was consequently something of a shock to him, when he opened the paper,
  to find two huge headlines competing. On the left a three-column space
  announced "Multi-millionaire Found Dead; Rosenberg Shot"; "Terrible Discovery
  in Rich Man's Library." On the right a similar space was filled with:
  "Africans Still Advancing"; "Hordes in Nile Valley"; "Rumours of Trouble in
  South Africa"; "French Defeat in Tangier." Philip goggled at the thick type,
  and instinctively tried to read both accounts at once. He was still immersed
  when Caithness came in, just preceding Sir Bernard.</p>

  <p>"I say," Philip cried to them, "Rosenberg's shot himself."</p>

  <p>"Rosenberg!" Sir Bernard exclaimed. "Whatever for?"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't say," Philip answered. "He was found in the study of his house
  late last night by the butler, who thought he heard a noise and went to
  see."</p>

  <p>"And found he had," Sir Bernard said. "Nasty for the butler." He picked up
  his own paper, and opened it so that he and Caithness could look at it
  together. But the priest's eyes went first to the columns of African news,
  and after his first glance Sir Bernard's followed them. They read the brief
  obscure telegrams, the explanatory comments, the geographical addenda. It
  seemed that something very unusual was happening in Africa. To begin with,
  all communication with the interior had completely ceased. Telegraphs had
  ceased to function, railways had been cut, roads had been blocked. By such
  roads as had not been blocked there were emerging against all the outer
  districts hostile bodies of natives, some so small as to be less than a raid,
  some so large as to mean an invasion, and at that, wherever they appeared, a
  victorious invasion. The Egyptian army, which had for some weeks been moving
  leisurely south in order to suppress trouble in the southeast, was now
  retiring in considerable disorder and even more considerable haste. The
  French had "suffered a set-back"; the Spaniards had fallen back towards the
  coast. Communications with Kenya, with Nigeria, with Abyssinia, with
  Zanzibar, had ceased. Raids had taken place on the English territories in the
  South. Air-investigation was being undertaken. The Powers were in touch and
  were taking necessary steps.</p>

  <p>"But what," Caithness said, "has happened to the air-investigation of the
  last month?"</p>

  <p>"It hasn't come back," Sir Bernard answered. "I was talking to a man in
  the War Office the other night, and he told me that they've sent out
  aeroplanes by the score, and hardly any have returned. Some have, I suppose,
  but what they reported is being kept dark. Philip, I think the African Rivers
  look like being in too much spate for your engineering."</p>

  <p>"But what about Rosenberg?" Philip asked. "Do you suppose that's what made
  him kill himself?"</p>

  <p>"Did he kill himself?" Sir Bernard said, turning to the other columns.
  "'Butler hears shot... letter for the Coroner... police satisfied. Financial
  comment on page 10'; yes, well, we can wait till after breakfast for that.
  Curious, I wonder what decided him. Let's just see whether the Archbishop
  said anything."</p>

  <p>It appeared that the previous day had been agitated in both Houses. In the
  Commons the Prime Minister had announced that forces were being dispatched
  immediately to punish the various tribes guilty of the abominable massacres
  at the mission stations. Asked by half a dozen members of the Opposition at
  once whether he could promise that these expeditions should not develop into
  costly Imperialistic wars, and whether the action taken was by request of the
  ecclesiastical authorities, the Prime Minister said that the Archbishop had
  naturally deprecated further bloodshed but that he and other ecclesiastical
  authorities had recognized the right of the State to protect its citizens.
  Asked whether he would undertake that no further territory would be seized,
  he said that no annexations would be made except by mandate from the League
  of Nations. Asked whether other Governments were taking action, he said that
  the House should have all information as soon as he received it.</p>

  <p>This had been in the afternoon. In the evening the Archbishop had asked
  the Lord Chancellor for permission to make a statement, and had then said
  that&mdash;in consultation with such other Bishops as happened to be in
  London&mdash;he had written at once that morning to the Prime Minister,
  definitely stating that the ecclesiastical authorities were entirely opposed
  to the dispatch of punitive expeditions, and begging that none should be
  sent. The Bishops were of the opinion that no secular action should be taken
  to avenge the martyrdom of the slaughtered missionaries and converts, and
  wished to dissociate themselves from any such action. A noble and indignant
  peer&mdash;a lately returned Governor-General&mdash;asked the Archbishop
  whether he realized that natives understood nothing but force, and whether he
  meant that war and the use of force was a sin; whether in short the
  Archbishop were disloyal or merely stupid. The Archbishop had referred the
  noble peer to the theologians for discussions and determinations of the use
  of force. The use of force was an act which was neither good nor evil in
  itself; the use of force in circumstances like the present appeared to
  himself and his colleagues a breach of Christian principles. Another peer
  demanded whether, if the Government were to dispatch punitive expeditions,
  the Archbishop would seriously accuse them of acting in an unchristian
  manner? The Archbishop said that the noble peer would remember that
  Christianity assumed a readiness for martyrdom as a mere preliminary to any
  serious work, and that he was sure no noble lord who happened to hear him and
  was a Christian would be unwilling to suffer tortures and death without
  wishing a moment's pain to his enemies. He apologized to the House for
  reminding them of what might be called the first steps in a religion of which
  many of his hearers were distinguished professors. The House rose at nine
  minutes past seven.</p>

  <p>"Dear me," said Sir Bernard, putting down his paper.</p>

  <p>Philip looked up from his own with a faint but perplexed smile. "Is this
  you, sir?" he said to Caithness.</p>

  <p>"No", Caithness answered, "I don't think so. It seems pretty obvious,
  after all."</p>

  <p>"I had no idea the Archbishop was so venomous," Sir Bernard said: "I think
  he certainly must believe in God. Mythology always heightens the style."</p>

  <p>Caithness said, rather sombrely, "Of course the Prime Minister will win in
  the end."</p>

  <p>"I should think it most likely," Sir Bernard said. "What was it Gibbon
  said-'all religions are equally useful to the statesman'!&mdash;Still, you've
  done your best. What do you want to do to-day?"</p>

  <p>"I may as well go back to Yorkshire," Caithness answered doubtfully. "I've
  been all the use I can be."</p>

  <p>"O nonsense," Sir Bernard said. "Stay a little, Ian; we see precious
  little of you anyhow. Stay till the African army lands at Dover, and then
  we'll all go to Yorkshire together&mdash;you and I, and Philip and Rosamond,
  and Roger and Isabel."</p>

  <p>Philip winced. His father's remark struck him as merely being in bad
  taste. It was too remote even to be a joke. He said coldly "I suppose I'd
  better go to the office?"</p>

  <p>"I think you should," Sir Bernard assented. "You'll be perfectly useless,
  of course. If it's a case of Africa for the Africans, they'll want to develop
  their own rivers, and as the Syndicate depended on Rosenberg it may not be
  able to develop itself. But you can find out the immediate prospects. The
  inquest will be to-morrow. What about coming to the inquest?"</p>

  <p>"Why, are you going?" Philip asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I am going," Sir Bernard answered. "I met Rosenberg quite a
  number of times, and I've always wondered about him. His wife died a couple
  of years ago, and I fancy he's been going to pieces ever since. No, Ian, not
  because of monogamy; no, Philip, not because of love. I'm sorry; I apologize
  to both of you, but it wasn't. It was because he'd developed a mania for
  making, for her, the most wonderful collection of jewels in the world. He had
  them too&mdash;marvellous! Tiaras and bracelets and necklaces and pendants
  and earrings and so on. I met her occasionally&mdash;not so often as him, but
  sometimes, and she looked not merely like the sun, the moon, and the eleven
  stars, but like the other eleven million that Joseph didn't know about. She
  was a magnificent creature, tall and rather large and dark, and she carried
  them off magnificently. In fact, she was a creation in terms of jewellery,
  the New Jerusalem turned upside down so that the foundations showed. And then
  she died."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't he have still gone on collecting jewels?" Caithness asked
  scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Apparently not," Sir Bernard said mildly. "He saw them on her, you see;
  they existed in relation to her. And when she died they fell apart&mdash;he
  couldn't find a centre for them. They were useless, and so he was useless. At
  least I suspect that's what happened. You didn't see her, so you won't
  understand."</p>

  <p>Caithness gave a short laugh. "A noble aim," he said.</p>

  <p>"Well, it was his," Sir Bernard remonstrated, still mildly. "And really,
  Ian, if it comes to comparisons, I don't know that it was worse than
  collecting poems, like Roger, or events, like me. I might say, or souls like
  you, because you do collect souls for the Church just as Rosenberg collected
  jewels for his wife, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"The Church doesn't die," Caithness said.</p>

  <p>"I know, I know," Sir Bernard answered. "But that only means you're more
  fortunate than Rosenberg in preferring a hypothesis to a person. At least,
  perhaps you are: it's difficult to say. I've a good mind to ask Roger to come
  to the inquest too."</p>

  <p>"It seems rather gruesome," Philip said, hesitating.</p>

  <p>"O my dear boy," Sir Bernard protested, "don't let's be adjectival. Here's
  a rich man shot himself because of a difficulty with life. Is it really
  gruesome to want to know what that difficulty is and how much like the rest
  of our difficulties it was? But at your age you daren't trust your own
  motives, and you're probably right. At mine one has to trust them or one
  couldn't enjoy them, and there's not much opportunity to do anything
  else."</p>

  <p>Persuaded either by such maxims or from motives of equal potency both
  Philip and Roger did actually accompany Sir Bernard the next day, though
  Caithness refused. The court was certainly crowded but they managed, through
  some diplomatic work by Sir Bernard, to get in. The coroner, a short hairy
  official, dealt with everyone in the same sympathetic manner.</p>

  <p>The evidence was brief and explicit. The butler who had found the body and
  summoned the police was called. His master (he said) had had one visitor that
  evening, a Mr. Considine (Sir Bernard looked at Roger, who sat up sharply).
  After Mr. Considine's departure, about twelve, his master had called him in
  to witness his signature to a document, and had then dismissed him. It had
  been about a quarter of an hour later when he had thought he heard the sound
  of a shot in the study. He had gone there... and so on through the difficult
  time that followed. The police described their arrival, their examination.
  Doctors described the nature of the wound.</p>

  <p>Mr. Considine was called.</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard lay back in his seat and studied the witness, mentally
  comparing him to the photograph. It was absurd that they should be so much
  alike, he thought, when they must of course, be different. He gazed at him
  with an inexplicable curiosity that seemed strangely to become even more
  vivid when by chance Considine's eyes, passing over the court, as he moved to
  the witness-box, met his. Roger was leaning eagerly forward, and a glance of
  recognition went between him and Considine. Philip felt and showed no
  particular interest.</p>

  <p>Considine explained the reason for his visit. He had been on his way home
  after a dinner and had passed the deceased's house; on an impulse he had
  determined to call, chiefly because he had been for some time... disturbed...
  about his state of mind. Deceased had, as people said; "lost hold"; he had no
  hope and no desire. He had lost interest alike in his business and in his
  amusements.</p>

  <p>"Can you suggest what caused this breakdown?" the coroner interrupted.
  "His health&mdash;the doctor has told us&mdash;was quite good?"</p>

  <p>"His health was good," Considine answered, "but his health had no purpose,
  or rather that purpose had been destroyed. He had made for himself an image,
  and that image had been removed. His wife while she lived had been the centre
  of that image; the jewels in which he clothed her completed it. She died; he
  had no children, and he had not enough energy to discover some other woman
  whom he could display in a like manner. He had externalised in that adorned
  figure all his power and possession; it was his visible power, his
  acknowledged possession. The jewels themselves, magnificent as they were,
  were not sufficient. Also I think there returned on him something of a
  childish fear; he was terrified of the destruction that haunts life."</p>

  <p>"You tried to cheer him up?" the coroner said.</p>

  <p>Considine paused for a moment. "I tried," he said slowly, "to persuade him
  to live by his own power rather than by what could be at best only properties
  of it. I tried to persuade him to live from the depth of his wound rather
  than to pine away in the pain of it; to make the extent of his desolation the
  extent of his kingdom. But I failed."</p>

  <p>"I see&mdash;yes," said the coroner vaguely. "You thought he needed
  bringing out of himself?"</p>

  <p>Considine considered again, a longer pause. "I thought he needed to find
  himself," he said at last, "and all of which himself was capable. But I could
  not work on him."</p>

  <p>"Quite, quite," said the coroner. "I'm sure the sympathy of the Court is
  with you, Mr. Considine, in your regrets that your efforts were unavailing.
  I've no doubt that you did all that you could, but there it is&mdash;if a man
  won't or can't bestir himself, mere talk won't help him. Thank you, Mr.
  Considine."</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" Sir Bernard said to Roger in a smothered voice, "mere
  talk! Mere&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The letter for the coroner was now produced, but carried things little
  further. It stated simply that Simon Rosenberg took all responsibility for
  the act of suicide, to which he had been driven by the full realization of
  the entire worthlessness of human existence. "We may, I think," the coroner
  interrupted himself to say, "mark that sentence as evidence of a very
  abnormal state of mind." Unconscious of the lowering glare which Roger turned
  on him, he went on: "There is enclosed with this brief letter another
  document which purports to be the deceased's last will and testament. I have
  had the opportunity of submitting it to the deceased's solicitors, Messrs.
  Patton &amp; Fotheringay, and in order that you may have all the evidence
  possible on deceased's state of mind before you I shall now read it."</p>

  <p>He proceeded to do so. It began normally enough, followed up this opening
  with a few legacies to servants, clerks, and acquaintances, and then in one
  magnificent clause left "the whole of the rest of the estate, real and
  personal, shares, jewels, houses, lands, and everything else from the
  smallest salt-cellar in the farthest shooting-lodge to the largest folio in
  the London library, to two second cousins, Ezekiel and Nehemiah Rosenberg,
  defined with all necessary exactitude as the grandchildren of the deceased's
  grandfather's younger brother Jacob Rosenberg.</p>

  <p>"And I do this," the strange document ran on, "because they have followed
  in the way of our fathers, and kept the Law of the Lord God of Israel, and
  because though I do not know whether there is any such God to be invoked or
  any such way to be trodden, yet I know that everything else is despair. If
  this wealth belongs to their God let him take it, and if not let them do what
  they choose and let it die." Nigel Considine and the Grand Rabbi were named
  as executors, with a hope that though they had not been consulted they would
  not refuse to act.</p>

  <p>There was a prolonged silence in court. Roger Ingram thought of several
  verses in Deuteronomy, a line or two of Milton, and a poem of Mangan's. Sir
  Bernard wished he knew Nehemiah and Ezekiel Rosenberg. Philip thought it was
  a very peculiar way of making a will. The coroner proceeded to explain to the
  jury the difference between felo-de-se and suicide while of unsound mind,
  with a definite leaning towards the second, of which (he suggested) "despair
  &mdash;to use the word chosen by the deceased&mdash;was, anyhow when carried
  to such an abnormal extent as the letter and will together seem to indicate,
  perhaps in no small measure a proof." The jury, after a merely formal
  consultation, in the rather uncertain voice of their foreman agreed. The
  court rose.</p>

  <p>On the steps outside, Sir Bernard and Roger instinctively delayed a little
  and were rewarded by seeing Considine come out. He was listening to a
  round-faced man who was probably either Mr. Patton or Mr. Fotheringay, but in
  a moment he noticed Roger, waved to him, and presently, parting from his
  companion, came across.</p>

  <p>"So, Mr. Ingram," he said, as he shook hands, "I didn't expect to see you
  here."</p>

  <p>"No," Roger answered; "as a matter of fact I came with&mdash;" he
  completed an explanation with an introduction.</p>

  <p>"But, of course I know Sir Bernard's name," Considine said. "Isn't it he
  who explained the stomach?"</p>

  <p>"Temporarily only," Sir Bernard answered.</p>

  <p>Considine shrugged. "While man needs stomachs," he said, "which may not be
  for so very much longer. A very ramshackle affair at present, don't you
  think?"</p>

  <p>"In default of a better", Sir Bernard protested, "what would you have us
  do?"</p>

  <p>"But are we in default of a better?" Considine asked. "Surely we're not
  like that poor wretch Rosenberg who couldn't live by his imagination, but
  died starved, for all his stomach and his mind."</p>

  <p>"So far," Sir Bernard said, "both the stomach and the mind seem normally
  necessary to man."</p>

  <p>"O so far!" Considine answered, "and normally! But it's the farther and
  the abnormal to which we must look. When men are in love, when they are in
  the midst of creating, when they are in a religious flame, what do they need
  then either with the stomach or the mind?"</p>

  <p>"Those", Sir Bernard said, "are abnormal states from which they
  return."</p>

  <p>"More's the pity," Roger said suddenly. "It's true, you know. In the real
  states of exaltation one doesn't seem to need food."</p>

  <p>"So," said Considine, smiling at him. "The poets have taught you
  something, Mr. Ingram."</p>

  <p>"But one returns," Sir Bernard protested plaintively, "and 'then one does
  need food. And reason," he added, almost as an afterthought.</p>

  <p>Considine was looking at Roger. "Will you say that one must?" he asked in
  a lower voice; and "O how the devil do I know?" Roger said impatiently. "I
  say that one does, but I daren't say that one must. And it's folly either
  way."</p>

  <p>"Don't believe it," Considine answered, his voice low and vibrating.
  "There's more to it than that."</p>

  <p>The words left a silence behind them for a moment, as if they were a
  summons. Roger kicked the pavement. Philip waited patiently. Presently Sir
  Bernard said, "Do you know the legatees by any chance, Mr. Considine?"</p>

  <p>Considine's eyes glowed. "Now there," he said, "if you like irony you have
  it. Yes, I know them&mdash;at least I know of them. I knew the family very
  well once. They are strict Jews, living in London because they are too poor
  to return to Jerusalem. They live in London and they abominate the Gentiles
  of London. They are fanatically&mdash;insanely, you would say&mdash;devoted
  to the tradition of Israel. They live, almost without food, Sir Bernard,
  studying the Law and nourished by the Law. They are the children of a second
  birth indeed, and they exist in the other life to which they were born. What
  do you think they will do with Simon Rosenberg's fortune and Simon
  Rosenberg's jewels?"</p>

  <p>"They could, I suppose, refuse it," Sir Bernard said.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't they use it to improve conditions in Palestine?" Philip asked,
  willing to appear interested.</p>

  <p>Considine looked at Roger, who said, "I don't know the tradition of
  Israel. Are jewels and fortunes any use to it?"</p>

  <p>"Or will they think so?" Considine answered. "I do not know. But it was a
  Jew who saw the foundations of the Holy City splendid with a beauty for which
  the names of jewels were the only comparison. We think of jewels chiefly as
  wealth, but I doubt if the John of the Apocalypse did, and I doubt if the
  Rosenbergs will. Perhaps he saw them as mirrors and shells of original
  colour. However, I suppose, as one of the executors, it will be my business
  to find out soon."</p>

  <p>"It's extraordinarily interesting," Sir Bernard said. "Do, my dear Mr.
  Considine, let us know. Come and dine with me one day. I've something else I
  want to ask you."</p>

  <p>On the point of making his farewells Considine paused.</p>

  <p>"Something you want to ask me?" he said.</p>

  <p>"A mere nothing," Sir Bernard answered. "I should like to know what
  relation you are to a photograph of you that I took fifty years ago."</p>

  <p>Roger stared. Philip moved uneasily; his father did put things in the most
  ridiculous way.</p>

  <p>"A photograph of me," Considine repeated softly, "that you took fifty
  years ago... ?"</p>

  <p>"I do beg your pardon," Sir Bernard said. "But that's what it looks like,
  though (unless you've improved the stomach out of all knowledge) it probably
  isn't. I wouldn't have bothered you if other subjects for
  discussion&mdash;jewels, digestion, and the tradition of Israel&mdash;hadn't
  cropped up. But unless you take that unfortunate coroner's view of 'mere
  talk', do be kind and come."</p>

  <p>Considine smiled brilliantly. "I do a little," he said, "but I allow it is
  a purification, a ritual and actual purification of the energies. I'm rather
  uncertain how much longer I shall be in England for the present, but if it's
  at all possible... Will you write or telephone or something in a day or two?
  My address is 29, Rutherford Gardens, Hampstead."</p>

  <p>"Hallo," Roger said, "we're up that way. My embalming workshop's there,"
  he added sardonically.</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard turned his head, a little surprised. Roger caught his eyes and
  nodded towards Considine.</p>

  <p>"He knows," he said. "I embalm poetry there&mdash;with the most popular
  and best-smelling unguents and so on, but I embalm it all right. I then
  exhibit the embalmed body to visitors at so much a head. They like it much
  better than the live thing, and I live by it, so I suppose it's all right. No
  doubt the embalmers of Pharaoh were pleasant enough creatures. They weren't
  called to any nonsense of following a pillar of fire between the piled waters
  of the Nile."</p>

  <p>"It's burning in you now," Considine said, "and you are on the threshold
  of a doorway that the Angel of Death went in&mdash;not yours."</p>

  <p>"If I could believe it&mdash;" Roger said. "Ask me to dine too, Sir
  Bernard. I want to ask Mr. Considine questions about Paradise
  Regained."</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chap3"
     id="chap3">III.</a> &mdash; THE PROCLAMATION OF THE HIGH
     EXECUTIVE</h2>

  <p class="first">BY the time that Philip arrived home that evening the
  wildest rumours about Africa were being spread. At the office things had been
  during the last few days as bad as he had feared they might be, and he had
  been as useless as Sir Bernard had expected. Nothing had been heard from or
  of Munro for some weeks. Rosenberg's suicide and, even more distressingly,
  his will, had startled and bothered the Stuyvesants to an indescribable
  degree. The motive power behind them, the object of motion in front, had both
  disappeared in blood; and no-one had the least idea what would happen. The
  Rosenberg legatees had been traced by mid-day; they were living in small
  upper rooms in Houndsditch, served by an old woman of their race.
  Extraordinary efforts had been made to procure interviews with them;
  unsuccessfully, since they merely refused to speak. There were, certainly, in
  the afternoon papers, sketches of them, but that was hardly the same thing.
  Even Governments were by way of being interested; high personages gazed at
  the reproductions dubiously. The two brothers looked as if they might be
  incapable of realizing the responsibilities of their present position. Two
  old, bearded, and violent faces stared out at England from journalistic
  pages. England stared back at them, and for the most part, quite reasonably,
  abandoned its interest. The Chief Rabbi also refused to be interviewed. Mr.
  Considine was interviewed, very unsatisfactorily, since he in effect refused
  to foreshadow, forestall, or foretell anybody's intention. Philip read
  certainly that Mr. Considine had said that he was sure that-there was no need
  for any public anxiety, that good sense (a quality which the Jews, he was
  reported to have declared, possessed to a marked degree) would distinguish
  the actions of the Rosenberg brothers, and that in the present critical times
  all minor racial prejudices must be set aside. By which Philip understood him
  to mean that racial prejudice in regard to Africa must swallow up the rest,
  as the serpent of Moses swallowed the others. He didn't feel quite convinced
  that Considine who on the steps of the coroner's court had exclaimed to Roger
  that a pillar of fire was burning in him had said all that. In the other
  columns of the papers racial prejudice was getting a firm hold.</p>

  <p>There were articles by anthropologists, with diagrams of negro heads;
  articles by explorers, with photographs of kraals; articles by statisticians,
  with columns of figures; articles by historians, with reproductions of
  paintings of Vasco da Gama, Thotmes III, Chaka, and others; articles by
  bishops and famous preachers on missions, with photographs of Christian
  negroes, converted and clothed; articles by politicians on the balance of
  power in Africa with maps curiously tinted; articles by military experts on
  possible strategy, with maps lined and blobbed. There were letters from peace
  champions and war invalids. There were, in short, all the signs of the
  interest which the public was believed to feel. Philip at last abandoned them
  and fell back on consideration.</p>

  <p>Except for that one remark on the pillar of fire, and the mysterious
  allusion to the foundations of the New Jerusalem, he hadn't noticed anything
  special in Considine's conversation, but those two did rather stand out. If
  Considine had not obviously been a... well, a gentleman, Philip would have
  suspected him of belonging to the Salvation Army. Of course, he had been
  talking to Roger, and Roger's own language was apt to be unbalanced. There
  were moments when Philip, what with his father and Roger, and even his
  godfather, with his refusal to allow martyrs to be avenged, felt that he was
  surrounded by eccentrics. He thought with relief and delight of Rosamond;
  Rosamond wasn't eccentric. She was so right, so peaceful, so beautifully the
  thing. She was a kind of centre, and all the others vibrated in peculiar
  poses on the circumference. She herself had no circumference, Philip thought,
  ignorant of how closely he was striving after St. Augustine's definition:
  "God is a circle, whose centre is everywhere and His circumference nowhere."
  She was small and dainty and she moved, as it were, in little pounces. And
  yet she was so strong; it was as if strength pretended to be weak. No, it
  wasn't that, for after all, she did need protection&mdash;his protection; she
  was strong enough to need no other and weak enough to need his. Philip took
  that decision quite seriously; in the economy of the universe he was not
  perhaps finally wrong. For he was very innocent in love, and the awful
  paradoxes which exist in that high passion and are an outrage to rational
  argument were natural to him rather because of his innocence than because of
  his egotism. That innocence might turn to egotism; that candid belief of his
  heart be hardened by his pride and turned from a simplicity to a stupidity.
  But at the moment he was very much in love, and in love he had not yet
  reached an age capable of sin. He was still a child of the new birth;
  maturity of intellect as of morals was far distant.</p>

  <p>Such a childhood he owed partly, surprised as he would have been to heat
  it, to his father. The placid irony of Sir Bernard's contemplation of life
  distilled itself over the wisdom of this world equally with that of every
  other. Dante was to him no more ridiculous than Voltaire; disillusion was as
  much an illusion as illusion itself. A thing that seemed had at least the
  truth of its seeming. Sir Bernard's mind refused to allow it more but it also
  refused to allow it less. It was for each man to determine how urgent the
  truth of each seeming was. Philip had not been discouraged from accepting the
  seemings of his own world, of school, University, and business; but he had
  been subtly encouraged to give free play to his own individual phenomena. A
  thing might not be true because it appeared so to him, but it was no less
  likely to be true because everyone else denied it. The eyes of Rosamond might
  or might not hold the secret origin of day and night, but if they apparently
  did then they apparently did, and it would be silly to deny it and equally
  silly not to relish it. Sir Bernard had never said this in so many words. But
  the atmosphere which he created was one in which such spiritual truths could
  thrive unhindered, and their growth depended upon their own instinctive
  strength.</p>

  <p>Serenely unconscious of what he owed, Philip felt his own serious growth
  wiser than that cool air of gracious scepticism. He thought his passion was
  hidden from it as from the sun, when in fact it throve in it as in the soft
  rains. He said nothing of Rosamond's eyes&mdash;which certainly were not, to
  Sir Bernard, anything remarkable&mdash;to his father, and supposed that the
  unformulated gospel they taught him was also a secret. He said nothing of
  them to anyone indeed, not having, nor caring to have, that tendency towards
  talk which marked his future brother-in-law. Roger, out of sheer interest,
  had given him every opportunity, and was rather disappointed that not one was
  taken. "I'm sure I talked enough about you," he complained to Isabel.</p>

  <p>"You're more interested in metaphysics," she said. "Philip's just a
  believer; you're a theologian."</p>

  <p>"I've a more complex matter to study," he said. "If I were a poet I would
  make the Matter of Isabel equal to the Matter of France and the Matter of
  Britain."</p>

  <p>"My honour wars with my credulity," she answered. "I'm not really more
  interesting than Rosamond but I like to think I am."</p>

  <p>"I don't think Sir Bernard approves of Rosamond," Roger said meditatively.
  "Why not, do you suppose? Can he really not think her good enough? Does he
  secretly adore Philip? My son, my son, and all that?"</p>

  <p>Isabel was silent for a minute; then she said: "I'm awfully tempted to
  tell you, Roger, but perhaps I won't. I do think I know what he feels, but
  it'd be rather hard on Rosamond to talk of it, wouldn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Devil!" said Roger. "You'd see your husband die of an insatiable
  curiosity rather than sully your integrity by giving him a crust of fact.
  You're as bad as the other Isabella&mdash;the one in Measure for Measure;
  you're avaricious of chastity. I don't want to be nice; I want to be malign
  and malevolent and omniscient. Very well; have it your own way. I shall now
  go and lecture on Pure Women in Literature, with sub-sardonic allusions to
  you, Shakespeare's Isabella, and Mr. Richardson's Pamela. And I shall be
  back, in a bad temper, to tea."</p>

  <p>It was to tea on the same day that, when he did return, he found Philip
  had invited himself, having abandoned the distracted office for an hour with
  Rosamond. Isabel had come in from an afternoon's walk, and when they all met
  in the drawing-room it was she who said: "Roger, you're looking very serious.
  What's the matter, darling? Didn't they remember who Pamela was, or did they
  think she was nice, or what?"</p>

  <p>Ingram stretched himself in an armchair. "Have any of you", he asked,
  "seen an evening paper?"</p>

  <p>"Not since two o'clock," Philip said. "Is there something important?"</p>

  <p>"That", Roger answered, "depends on what you think important. There's an
  African proclamation."</p>

  <p>"What!" Philip was so surprised that his eyes left Rosamond's hair to rest
  on the newspaper that Roger was holding. "Is there really? What does it
  say?"</p>

  <p>"It says that the Socratic method is done for," Roger said seriously. A
  small frown appeared on Rosamond's face and went away again. Philip, without
  frowning, conveyed the impression of a frown and said: "Do be serious. It's
  important to me to know. What does it say?"</p>

  <p>"It says exactly what I've told you," Roger said, more sardonically. "It
  says you think too much, Philip, and it says your father is just the last
  kind of mistake. It's no use blaming me. I didn't write it. I'm not even sure
  that I know what it means."</p>

  <p>Isabel, taking a sandwich, said: "Read it, Roger. The Socratic method
  doesn't really help one to choose a frock. I know because I tried it once. I
  said, 'Must not a colour which suits me, and a cut that I admire, be
  desirable? It would seem so, Socrates.' And yet it wasn't. Do read it."</p>

  <p>Philip, having thus been defrauded of his protest, waited in the silence
  of injured decency to hear more. Rosamond looked at him sympathetically.
  Roger dropped two of his papers, opened the third, and read.</p>

  <p>"Alleged Statement by African Leaders. Document received by Foreign Office
  and Press. Where is the High Executive? African Aims Reported to be
  Disclosed. By the mid-day post a document was received at the offices of all
  the London newspapers which is, with all reserves in regard to its
  authenticity, given below. The editors of the London papers have been in
  communication with the Foreign Office, and learn that a precisely similar
  document has been received there. Not only so, but the Foreign Offices and
  the Press of other European countries have also been communicated with in the
  same way. In Paris and Madrid this alleged manifesto has already been
  published, and the British Government, after consultation with the editors,
  has raised no objection to its publication here. If it is genuine&mdash;a
  question which is being investigated&mdash;it pretends to offer some kind of
  explanation of the late remarkable events in Africa. The manifesto, or
  proclamation, as it might be called, is as follows:</p>

  <p>"'In the name of the things that have been and are to be, willed and
  fated, in the name of the gods many and one, the Allied Supremacies of
  Africa, acting by the will and speaking by the voice of the High Executive,
  desire to communicate to the rest of the world the doctrine and purpose of
  the cause in which they are engaged. They announce their immediate purpose to
  be the freeing of the African continent from the government and occupation of
  the white race; their farther purpose to be the restoration to mankind of
  powers which have been forgotten or neglected, and their direction to ends
  which have hitherto been unproclaimed. They announce their profound belief
  that, as to the European peoples in the past, so to themselves in the future
  the conscious leadership of mankind belongs. It is not an imposed but an
  emerging leadership, superior to its disciples as to its enemies because of
  the conscious potentialities which exist in it. The potentialities of that
  superiority do not attempt to deny the capacities of Europe in their own
  proper achievements. The High Executive of the African Allies desires, in its
  first public summons to the creative powers of the world, to honour the
  immortal finalities of the past. It salutes the intellect, the philosophies,
  the science, the innumerable patterns of Europe. But it asserts that the
  great age of intellect is done, nor was the intellect ever that power which
  its disciples have been encouraged to believe. The prophets of Africa, who
  are not found only among its own peoples but include many of other races both
  in the past and in the present&mdash;the prophets of Africa have seen that
  mankind must advance in the future by paths which the white peoples have
  neglected and to ends which they have not understood. Assured that at this
  time the whole process of change in mankind, generally known as evolution, is
  at a higher crisis than any since mankind first emerged from among the great
  beasts and knew himself; assured that by an equal emergence from intellectual
  preoccupations, the adepts of the new way have it in their power to lead, and
  all mankind has it in its power to follow, not certainly by the old habits of
  reason but by profounder experiments of passion, to the conquest of death in
  the renewed ecstasy of vivid experience; assured of these things the Allied
  Supremacies appeal to the whole world for belief and discipleship and
  devotion.'"</p>

  <p>Roger paused and looked up. Rosamond, again frowning a little, was eating
  cake. Philip was listening with his mouth open and his eyes staring. Isabel
  was attending with a serious and serene care. Roger grinned at her and
  resumed.</p>

  <p>"'The peoples of Africa appear before the world in arms, in order to claim
  from the sovereign authorities of Europe that freedom which is their due and
  their necessity on the one hand; on the other their privilege and
  opportunity, They will and they are fated to achieve that freedom. But their
  arms are of defence and not of aggression. They are willing to concede all
  possible time and convenience to the Powers of Europe. They no more desire to
  waste their energies and those of their opponents on war than on any other
  lower exterior imitation of heroic interior conquest. They are not anxious
  that the discipleship of the European imagination should be made more
  difficult by the mundane stupidities of dispute and battle. But the
  administration of Africa by the white race is now a thing of the
  past&mdash;to be remembered only as intellectual sovereignty will be
  remembered, a necessary moment that was willed and was fated and has
  ceased.</p>

  <p>"'To those among the peoples of Europe who know that their lives have
  origin and nourishment in the great moments of the exalted imagination, the
  High Executive offers salute and recognition'"&mdash;Roger's voice began to
  linger over the words&mdash;"'to all who owe their devotion to music, to
  poetry, to painting and sculpture, to the servants of every more than
  rational energy; greater than those and more numerous, to all who at this
  present moment exist in the exchanged or unexchanged adoration of love, it
  calls more especially. There, perhaps more surely and swiftly than in any
  other state of being outside the transmuting Way, can the labour of
  exploration be begun; there is the knowledge, the capacity, the herald
  apprehension of victory. These visionaries are already initiate; they know in
  themselves the prophecy of the conquest of death. To all such the High
  Executive appeals, with ardour and conviction. Believe, imagine, live. Know
  exaltation and feed on it; in the strength of such food man shall enter into
  his kingdom.</p>

  <p>"'The High Executive permits itself to offer to the Christian Churches its
  congratulations on the courage and devotion of those their servants who have
  sustained death by martyrdom. Convinced as it is that the Churches have,
  almost from the beginning, been misled by an erring principle, it
  nevertheless honours those martyrs as sublime if misguided instances of that
  imagination which it is its purpose to make known to mankind and which the
  rites and dogmas of the Christian religion dimly proclaim. It is assured by
  its belief in man and by the exalted courage of those martyrs that they would
  have desired no other end, and it takes full responsibility for having
  advised its august sovereigns that they could bestow on Christian
  missionaries no more perfect gift.</p>

  <p>"'The High Executive will be prepared to send representatives at any time
  to any place fixed by the Powers of Europe or by any of them; or to enter
  into negotiations in any other way that the Powers may desire. It will assume
  the fixing of such time and place or the opening of such negotiations to be a
  guarantee of safe-conduct for its representatives, and it will be prepared to
  suspend as soon as possible the military, naval, and aerial operations upon
  which it is engaged.</p>

  <p>"'Given in London, by direction of the High Executive, in the First Year
  of the Second Evolution of Man.'"</p>

  <p>Roger stopped. Almost before his voice had ceased, Rosamond said: "Philip,
  darling, you haven't eaten anything. Have a cake?" Philip for once took no
  notice. Roger said: "About a thousand words&mdash;a little more. Allowing for
  recapitulations in its extremely rhetorical style&mdash;the High Executive
  hasn't studied the best models&mdash;say, seven-fifty. Either pure waste or
  the most important seven-fifty words I've ever read."</p>

  <p>"I haven't got the hang of it," Philip said in bewilderment. "What does it
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"It&mdash;what did it say?&mdash;it calls to you more especially, Philip,"
  Roger went on. "It salutes you, because you have the vision of the conquest
  of death in the exchanged adoration of love. It expects you to do something
  about it all at once." His eyes lingered on Isabel, and then became
  abstracted. He sighed once and got to his feet. "I'll have some more tea," he
  said. "The cup that cheers but not inebriates after words that inebriate but
  do not cheer."</p>

  <p>Isabel, pouring out the tea, said: "Don't they cheer you, dearest?"</p>

  <p>"Not one bit," Roger answered. He leaned gloomily against the mantelpiece,
  and after a pause said suddenly, "Well, Rosamond, and what do you make of
  it?"</p>

  <p>Rosamond answered coldly. "I wasn't listening, I don't think it's very
  nice, and really, Roger, I don't see why you need have read it."</p>

  <p>"The High Executive of the African peoples asked me to," Roger said
  perversely. "What don't you like about it&mdash;giving up intellect or having
  the vision of the conquest of death?"</p>

  <p>"I think you're simply silly, Roger," Rosamond exclaimed and stood up.
  "And if it was written by a lot of... a lot of Africans, that makes it more
  disgusting than ever. I don't think it ought to have been printed."</p>

  <p>Isabel spoke before Roger, sadistically watching Rosamond, could reply.
  "Do you think it's authentic, Roger?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"My dear, how can I guess?" her husband answered, more placably; then he
  shifted his position, and added: "It's authentic enough in one way; there is
  something more."</p>

  <p>Isabel smiled at him. "But need we think we didn't know it already?" she
  asked softly. "It isn't very new, is it?"</p>

  <p>He was looking across the room at the high bookcase.</p>

  <p>"If they came alive," he murmured, "if they are alive&mdash;all shut up in
  their cases, all nicely shelved&mdash;shelved&mdash;shelved. We put them in
  their places in our minds, don't we? If they got out of their
  bookcases&mdash;not the pretty little frontispieces but the things beyond the
  frontispieces, not the charming lines of type but the things the type means.
  Dare you look for them, Isabel?" As he still stared at the bookcase his voice
  altered into the deeper sound of a subdued chant.</p>

  <p>"He scarce had ceased when the superior fiend was moving towards the
  shore:</p>

  <p>"'Hid in its vacant interlunar cave; And thus the Filial Godhead answering
  spake.'"</p>

  <p>Rosamond said sharply: "Do be quiet, Roger. You know I hate your
  quoting."</p>

  <p>"Quoting!" Roger said, "quoting!" and stopped in despair. He looked at
  Philip as if asking him whether he couldn't do something.</p>

  <p>Philip didn't see the look; he was meditating. But the silence affected
  him at last; he raised his eyes, and was on the point of speaking when
  Rosamond interrupted, slipping her hand through his arm. "Don't talk about it
  any more, darling," she said; "it's too horrid. Look, shall I come as far as
  the Tube with you?"</p>

  <p>He stirred&mdash;rather heavily, Roger thought&mdash;but as their eyes met
  he smiled back at her, and only Isabel's hand prevented her husband from
  again quoting the High Executive on the exchanged adoration of love. It was
  therefore with a slight but unusual formality that farewells were spoken, and
  Philip departed for the station.</p>

  <p>Roger remained propped against the mantelpiece, but he said, viciously,
  "She 'wasn't listening'! "</p>

  <p>Isabel looked at him a little anxiously. "Don't listen too carefully,
  darling," she said. "It's not just cowardice&mdash;to refuse to hear some
  sounds."</p>

  <p>He pulled himself upright. "I must go and work," he said. "I must
  exquisitely water the wine so that it may be tolerable for weak heads." By
  the door he paused. "Do you remember your Yeats?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"What rough beast, its hour come round at last, Slouches towards Bethlehem
  to be born? I wonder. Also I wonder where exactly Bethlehem is, and what are
  the prodigies of the birth."</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chap4"
     id="chap4">IV.</a> &mdash; THE MAJESTY OF THE KING</h2>

  <p class="first">In the Tube Philip read the proclamation of the High
  Executive over again, and, to the best of his ability, considered it. He was
  uneasily conscious that Rosamond would have disapproved of this, and he
  couldn't help feeling that it was only by an oversight that she hadn't asked
  him to please her by leaving it alone. However, she hadn't, so he was morally
  free. There stirred vaguely in his mind the subtler question of whether he
  were free by a strict or by an easy interpretation of morals: did exact
  justice, did a proper honour, demand that he should follow her choice or
  insist on his own? But the question never got as far as definition; he was
  aware of a difficulty turning over in its sleep&mdash;slouching towards
  Bethlehem but not reaching it&mdash;and almost deliberately refrained from
  realizing it. Because he did want to know, more accurately, what this alleged
  declaration had said about love. Unlike Roger and, fortunately for him, like
  Rosamond, he had no particular use for the masters of verse. He was therefore
  ignorant of the cloud of testimony that had been borne to the importance and
  significance of the passion that was growing in him. He had certainly heard
  of Dante and Beatrice, of Tristram and Iseult, of Lancelot and Guinevere, but
  there he stopped. He had hardly heard, he had certainly never brooded over,
  that strange identification of Beatrice with Theology and of Theology with
  Beatrice by which one great poet has justified centuries of else doubtful
  minds. But by that secular dispensation of mercy which has moved in the blood
  of myriads of lovers, he had felt what he did not know and experienced what
  he could not formularise. And the words which he now read did not so much
  startle his innocent devotion by their eccentricity as dimly disturb him with
  a sense of their justice. He had had no use at all for the African peoples
  except in so far as they gave him an opportunity to follow his European
  habits in providing Rosamond with a home and a car and anything else she
  wanted. The prospect of the great age of intellect being done, also left him
  unmoved; he hadn't realized that any special great age of intellect had
  existed&mdash;except for a vague idea that a period of past history known as
  the Middle Ages was considerably less intelligent than the present, and that
  there had been a brief time when Athens, and a rather longer time when Rome,
  was very intellectual. But when all that seemed to him meaningless had been
  removed, there still remained the fact that never before, never anywhere, had
  any words, printed or spoken, come nearer to telling him what he really felt
  about Rosamond than this paragraph which purported to come from the centre of
  Africa, and from dark-skinned chiefs pouring up against the guns and rifles
  of England. He knew it was silly, but he knew it said "adoration," "vision,"
  "apprehension of victory," "conquest of death." He knew it was silly, but he
  knew also that he had felt through Rosamond, brief and little understood,
  something which was indeed apprehension of victory and conquest of death.</p>

  <p>When he got home he found his godfather alone, and, rather against his own
  intention, found himself approaching the subject. Caithness had seen the
  proclamation and was inclined to be a little scornful of it: which may partly
  have been due to the unrecognized fact that, while Roger and Philip had both
  found their interior passions divined and applauded, Caithness had had his
  referred to merely as "a misguided principle." He doubted the authenticity,
  and went on to add: "Rather bombastic, don't you think? I don't pretend to
  know what it means."</p>

  <p>Philip said, "Roger seemed quite impressed by it."</p>

  <p>"O Roger!" the priest said good-humouredly. "I called it bombast but I
  expect he'd call it poetry. I don't mean that it hasn't a kind of thrill in
  it, but thrills aren't the only thing&mdash;certainly they're not safe things
  to live by."</p>

  <p>Philip thought this over, and decided that he agreed with it. Only his
  sensations about Rosamond were not&mdash;no, they were not thrills: and he
  wasn't at all clear that they weren't things to live by. He said, shamelessly
  involving Roger: "He made fun of me about it&mdash;he seemed to think that
  part of it was meant for me. The paragraph about&mdash;O well, some paragraph
  or other."</p>

  <p>Caithness looked down at the paper. "This about the exaltation of love, I
  expect," he said, with a rather charming smile. "Roger would be all in favour
  of that; the poets are. But perhaps they're more used to living on the
  hilltops than the rest of us."</p>

  <p>"You don't think it's true then?" Philip asked, with a slight and
  irrational feeling of disappointment. Irrational, because he hadn't actually
  expected Caithness to agree with a gospel, if it was a gospel, out of Africa.
  Sir Bernard had once remarked that Caithness limited himself to the Near East
  in the matter of gospels, "the near East modified by the much nearer
  West."</p>

  <p>But over the direct question Caithness hesitated. "I wouldn't care to say
  it wasn't true," he said, "but all truth is not expedient. It's no use making
  people expect too much."</p>

  <p>"No," Philip said, "I suppose it isn't." Was he expecting too much? was
  he, in fact, expecting anything at all? Or could whatever he expected or
  whatever happened alter the terribly important fact of the shape of
  Rosamond's ear? He also looked again at the paper, and words leapt to his
  eyes. "Believe, imagine, live. Know exaltation and feed on it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't then," he said, unwontedly stirred, "really think one ought to
  believe in it too much?"</p>

  <p>"Why yes, my dear boy," the priest answered. "Only these things are so
  often deceptive; they change or they become familiar. One can't trust one's
  own vision too far; that's where religion comes in."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard would no doubt have pointed out, what did not occur to either
  of the others, that this merely meant that Caithness was substituting his own
  hobby for Philip's. But he wasn't there, and so, vaguely depressed,
  especially as he couldn't feel that Rosamond's ear would ever change, the
  young man turned the conversation, and shut away the appeal of the High
  Executive for the time being in whatever corresponded in his mind to Roger
  Ingram's bookshelves.</p>

  <p>The African trouble, however, displayed, during the next few days, no
  possibility of being shut away. The steps which the Powers, on the unanimous
  testimony of their spokesmen, were harmoniously taking produced no effect
  against the rebels (as the enemy was habitually called). It became clear that
  the "hordes" consisted, in fact, of highly disciplined and well-supplied
  armies. In the north of Africa the territory held by the European forces grew
  daily smaller; all Egypt, except Cairo, was lost; the French were pressed
  back to the coast of Tangier; the Spaniards were hustled out of Morocco. The
  Dominion of South Africa was sending out expeditions, of which no news
  returned&mdash;certainly there had not been much time, but there was no news
  at all, or none that was published. In England an official censorship was
  attempted, but failed owing to the speedy growth of a party which demanded
  "Africa for the Africans." Normally the massacre of the Christian
  missionaries would have been fatal to such a demand, but the recalcitrant
  attitude of the Archbishop hampered the more violent patriots. Rumours got
  about of the appearance of hostile aeroplanes over the Mediterranean and the
  coastline of Southern Europe. Negroes in London and other large towns were
  mobbed in the streets. Roger reported to Isabel that not only negroes but
  comparatively harmless Indians had disappeared from his classes. It was
  evident that the Government would be driven to some measure of
  internment.</p>

  <p>It was so driven, more quickly than had been expected, when the news came
  of the sinking of a transport crowded with Indian troops which were being
  rushed to South Africa. That the African armies should be able to operate
  destructively by sea as well as by land was a shock even to instructed
  opinion, and, among the uninstructed, crowds began to parade the streets,
  booing and cheering and chasing any dark-skinned stranger who showed himself.
  Even one or two Southern Italians had, for a few minutes, an uneasy time. The
  crowds were of course dissolved by the police, but they came together again
  like drops of water till the evening's amusement was done and they
  reluctantly went home.</p>

  <p>The reaction of all these events on the money market was considerable, and
  it was not eased by the uncertainty which still existed on the situation of
  the late Mr. Rosenberg's affairs. Nothing definite was known, since the Chief
  Rabbi and Mr. Considine persisted in their silence, as did the two legatees.
  But an uneasy feeling manifested itself, both in the streets around the
  brothers' house and in the wider circles of finance. It could not be said
  that anything unusual was going on, for nothing at all seemed to be going on.
  But the stillness was alarming. No-one could believe that the two aged and
  devoted students of Kabbalistic doctrine were fit persons to control the vast
  interests of the Rosenberg estate. But no-one could prevent their doing
  whatever they liked with it. Nehemiah and Ezekiel came out to the synagogue
  and went home again, and went nowhere else, though well-dressed strangers in
  cars descended on Houndsditch, and were engaged with them over long periods.
  In Houndsditch itself strange tales of the jewels began to spread, following
  vivid accounts of them in the papers. The thrill of the jewels and the thrill
  of the Africans contended; hungry eyes followed the Jews as hostile eyes
  followed such rare negroes as could still be seen in the East End. A sullen
  excitement began to work around them, a breathless and vulgar imitation of
  the exalted imagination which the High Executive had declared to be the true
  path to desirable knowledge.</p>

  <p>A more natural excitement, though perhaps equally crude from the point of
  view of the High Executive and that other High Executive represented among
  others by the Archbishops, affected innumerable suburban homes when the
  selling began. Gradually but steadily the prices of shares in the Rosenberg
  concerns began to fall. It was said that someone knew something and was
  standing from under. A shiver of panic touched finance, allied to that other
  panic which had already touched the extreme villages of Southern Europe.
  Nervous voices made inquiries over telephones in England as nervous eyes
  watched aeroplanes over the Mediterranean. From each background of silence a
  thin mist of fear crept out and was blown over many minds. Something shook
  civilization, as it had been shaken a hundred times before, but that
  something loomed now in half-fancied forms of alien powers, of negroes flying
  through the air and Jews withdrawing their gold. Day by day the tremors
  quickened. Neglected expositors of the Apocalypse in Tonbridge or Cheltenham,
  old ladies, retired military men, and an eccentric clergyman or two, began to
  say boldly that it was the end of the world. At Birmingham a man ran naked
  through the streets crying that he saw fire from heaven, and leaping on to
  the railway lines was killed by an express train before the police could
  catch him. "Second Adventist goes mad at Birmingham," said the evening
  papers. The Churches found that growing crowds attended them. The Government
  unofficially suggested to the Archbishops that they should discourage people
  coming to church. The Archbishops issued a Pastoral Letter from which they
  naturally could not exclude some of their irritation with the Government; and
  of which therefore the first part, which was addressed to the new converts,
  tended towards a scornful and minatory tone. This, if anything, made matters
  worse, the converts naturally arguing that if the Church could afford to use
  that voice the Church must feel itself very safe indeed; and this feeling was
  strengthened by the second part which was addressed to the faithful in
  language that in normal times would have been ordinary enough. "And you,
  little children, love one another," it began and continued on the same theme,
  ending with another quotation, "My peace I give unto you; not as the world
  giveth give I unto you." The idea that these incantations contained a magical
  safety found more and more believers; and Sir Bernard congratulated Caithness
  on a greater spread of the Faith in ten days than in ten years previously. On
  a world already thus agitated fell the second communication of the High
  Executive. This, after the earlier formal invocation of "things willed and
  fated," "gods many and one," went on in something of a high style of distress
  to lament that the Powers of Europe had not thought well even to answer the
  earlier message, much less apparently to prepare themselves for any
  negotiations. They had instead, by all means at their command, increased
  their armies and strengthened the war. "Some check", the message went on,
  "the African armies have administered to this gathering defiance, but the
  High Executive has felt compelled to advise its august Sovereigns that mere
  measures of defence will no longer be sufficient. If the Powers of Europe are
  determined to force war upon Africa, then Africa will be compelled to open
  war upon Europe. The gospel which is the birthright of the African peoples
  and which they offer as a message of hope even to the degraded and outworn
  nations of the white race carries no maxim which they are unwilling to
  practise. With a profound but unrecognised truth the Christians of Europe
  have declared that the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church. This
  maxim Africa knows, understands, obeys. In the high mysteries of birth and
  death, not only physical generation or physical destruction, but those
  spiritual experiences of which these are but types, Africa has learnt the
  secret duties of man. Her peoples offer themselves in exaltation to the bed
  of death as to the bed of love. With an ecstasy born of their ecstasy, with a
  communication to its children of that which they first communicated to it,
  the High Executive summons them to what is at present the final devotion of
  conscious being. They and it are alike indifferent to the result, if the
  armies of Europe destroy them they will but find in death a greater thing
  than their conquerors know. But the armies of Europe will not destroy them,
  for the Second Evolution of man has begun. Their leaders and prophets, and
  the High Executive which is their voice and act, address themselves no longer
  to the children of intellect and science and learning. They turn to their own
  peoples. Daughters and Sons of Africa, you are called to the everlasting
  sacrifice. Victim or priest at that altar, it matters not whether you inflict
  or endure the pang. Come, for the cycles are accomplished and the knowledge
  that was of old returns. Come, for this is the hour of death that alternates
  for ever with the hour of love. Come, for without the knowledge of both the
  knowledge of one shall fail. Come, ye blessed, inherit the things laid up for
  you from the foundations of the world."</p>

  <p>On the evening of the day when this invocation appeared, the crowds in the
  streets were thicker than ever. The first death was reported in a special
  edition of the papers; a negro had been literally hunted over Hampstead Heath
  and afterwards (not quite intentionally, it was thought), killed. Sir Bernard
  rang up Isabel.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he said, when she answered, "except that you once said that
  Hampstead was the negro quarter of London, and I thought I'd like to know
  whether there was any trouble up there."</p>

  <p>"Not to say trouble," Isabel said. "There was a little friction at the
  gate, and we've got a coloured gentleman in the house at present."</p>

  <p>"Have you indeed?" Sir Bernard exclaimed. "Was it you or Roger who brought
  him in?"</p>

  <p>"Both of us," Isabel explained. "We heard a noise in the street and we
  looked out, and there was a negro&mdash;at least, he was a black man; a
  negro's something technical, isn't it?&mdash;against our gate, and the most
  unpleasant lot of whites you ever saw all round him, cursing. Roger went out
  and talked to them, but that was no good. He said something about behaving
  like Englishmen, and I suppose they did; at least they began to throw stones
  and hit out with their sticks. So Roger got him through the gate, and I got
  them through the front door, and here he is."</p>

  <p>"You're not hurt, Isabel?" Sir Bernard said sharply. "What about the
  crowd?"</p>

  <p>"O they threw things at the house and smashed a window, and presently the
  police came and they went away," Isabel answered. "No, thank you, I'm
  perfectly all right. I'm just going to make coffee. Come and have some."</p>

  <p>"Where's your visitor?" Sir Bernard asked.</p>

  <p>"Talking African love songs and tribal poetry with Roger in his room,"
  Isabel said. "They agree wonderfully on everything but the effect of the
  adverb. Roger's evolving a theory that adverbs have no place in great poetry
  &mdash;I don't understand why."</p>

  <p>"I should like to hear him," Sir Bernard said. "Thanks, Isabel; I'll come
  up if I may."</p>

  <p>"Do," said Isabel, "and I'll postpone the coffee for half-an-hour. Till
  then."</p>

  <p>For once Sir Bernard took a taxi; as a general rule he avoided them,
  preferring the more actively contemplative life of buses and tubes, and
  preferring also never to be in anything like a hurry. When he arrived he
  found Philip and Rosamond, who had been dining out, sitting side by side on
  the kitchen table, watching Isabel make the coffee.</p>

  <p>"Come in here, Sir Bernard, won't you?" she said when she had let him in,
  "and you shall see the refugee soon. He's in the only room with a fire, and
  as Rosamond is terrified to death of him we have to linger in the kitchen to
  keep comfortably warm. 'October nights are chill,' as someone said. No, don't
  tell me."</p>

  <p>"Isabel," her sister protested, "I'm not terrified of him, but I don't
  think it's quite nice of him to stop here. Why doesn't he go home?"</p>

  <p>"With mobs prowling round the garden gate?" Isabel asked. "And Roger still
  making noises to show the union of accent and quantity? My dear Rosamond,
  when you're married you won't want Philip's friends to go home until he's
  thoroughly tired out. Otherwise he'll barge into your room at midnight and go
  on with the conversation with you. And as you're asleep to begin with, and as
  you don't know what the conversation was about, and as you don't know whether
  he wants you to agree or disagree though you'd do either for peace, you'll
  find it very difficult to be nice to him. I have never", Isabel went on,
  pouring milk into a saucepan, "really quarrelled with Roger..."</p>

  <p>"Isabel!" Sir Bernard murmured.</p>

  <p>"Not really," Isabel persisted, "except once, and that was when he woke me
  up by calling out to me very late one night, 'Isabel, what is there in verse
  which is the equivalent of the principle of the arch?' I really was angry
  then, but he only kept murmuring lines of poetry and trying to see if they
  were like an arch. All that because a friend of his who had been to dinner
  had gone away at half-past eleven instead of half-past one. Always remember,
  Rosamond my child, that a man needs you to get away from."</p>

  <p>"You mean needs to get away from me, don't you?" Rosamond asked, looking
  possessively at Philip.</p>

  <p>"No," Isabel said, "Sir Bernard, the milk's boiling... thank you so much.
  No, Rosamond, I don't. I mean exactly what I said. A man must have
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wish you wouldn't keep saying 'a man,' Isabel," Philip
  remonstrated.</p>

  <p>"Very well&mdash;give me a spoon, Philip&mdash;Philip then must have you
  there in order to be able to get away. If you weren't there he wouldn't be
  able to get away."</p>

  <p>Rosamond looked uninterested. Philip reflected what a curious thing it was
  that so many people he knew should want to chatter like this. His father did
  it, Ingram did it, Isabel did it. Sometimes he understood it, sometimes he
  didn't. But he never understood it as now, suddenly, he understood Rosamond's
  arm when she leant forward to pass a plate to her sister; somehow that arm
  always made him think of the Downs against the sky. There was a line, a
  curved beauty, a thing that spoke to both mind and heart; a thing that was
  there for ever. And Rosamond? Rosamond was like them, she was there for ever.
  It occurred to him that, if she was, then her occasional slowness when he was
  trying to explain something was there for ever. Well, after all, Rosamond was
  only human; she couldn't be absolutely perfect. And then as she stretched out
  her arm again he cried out that she was perfect, she was more than perfect;
  the movement of her arm was something frightfully important, and now it was
  gone. He had seen the verge of a great conclusion of mortal things and then
  it had vanished. Over that white curve he had looked into incredible space;
  abysses of intelligence lay beyond it. And in a moment all that lay beyond it
  was the bright kitchen, and Sir Bernard standing up to go into the other
  room. He jumped to his feet and with a movement almost of terror took the
  loaded coffee tray from Isabel.</p>

  <p>"Quietly," Isabel said as they came to the door of the nondescript room
  where the Ingrams habitually, alone or with their intimates, passed their
  time. "Quietly; let's hear what the rescued captive and his saviour are
  talking about."</p>

  <p>She opened the door gently, and Ingram's voice came out to them. "O
  rhythm!" he was saying, "rhythm is the cheap pseudo-metaphysical slang of our
  day. At least it was; it's dying now. Everyone explained everything by
  talking about rhythm. It's a curious thing that people who will sneer at a
  man for doing nothing all his life but making words sound lovely and full of
  meaning will be quite happy over life so long as they can explain it in words
  that are almost meaningless. I sometimes think the nearest we can get to
  meaning is to feel as if there was meaning."</p>

  <p>"Yet at least rhythm's distinctly felt," said another voice, a rich
  strange voice; "so far they attempt to discover a knowledge of the
  whole."</p>

  <p>"O so far!" Ingram said, and jumped off the table on which he was sitting
  as Isabel pushed the door right open and came into the room. After a table
  had been found for the tray, introductions took place; at least Ingram began
  to say, "O Rosamond"&mdash;he stopped suddenly; "By God," he said, "I don't
  know your name."</p>

  <p>The stranger, a tall magnificent young creature, darkly bronze, bowed to
  Rosamond: "My name is Inkamasi," he said. "At least," he added, a trifle
  scornfully, Sir Bernard thought, "that is the simplest form of it."</p>

  <p>"Quite," Roger said brightly. "Miss Murchison, Mr. Travers&mdash;hallo,
  Sir Bernard, I didn't know you were here&mdash;Sir Bernard Travers, the
  Belly-King."</p>

  <p>It was a name with which his intimates had teased Sir Bernard in the days
  of his practice. Philip frowned, forgetting that though the black&mdash;if
  you could strictly call him black&mdash;was to him an entirely new and not
  very desirable acquaintance, the occurrences of the last two hours had put
  him on terms of intimacy with the Ingrams. Rosamond, rather nervously, kept
  close to his side. Roger sat down again on top of his large knee-hole
  writing-table, and took the coffee Philip handed him.</p>

  <p>"We were talking&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>"Yes, darling, we heard you," Isabel said. "Don't trouble to repeat it
  just at once. And I hope that doesn't sound too rude," she added to the
  stranger, "only when Roger's got more than two people to listen to him he
  always begins to lecture."</p>

  <p>"I ought to have gone long ago," the other said. "But your husband kept
  me, talking of poetry and song and the principles of being."</p>

  <p>"But", Isabel said, "must you go yet? I mean, will it be wise?" She looked
  at Roger.</p>

  <p>"O quite," the African said. "The police will have cleared the streets,
  and I don't live far away."</p>

  <p>Roger looked at the clock. "Twenty to ten," he said, "better wait a
  little. I didn't quite get the hang of what you were saying about Homer. I'll
  walk round with you presently. Sir Bernard'll be interested in Homer; he had
  a line from him on the title-page of his book, opposite the peculiarly
  loathsome diagram that formed the frontispiece."</p>

  <p>"I didn't even know you'd looked so far into it," Sir Bernard said.</p>

  <p>"I generally give the title-page a fair chance," Roger said. "One can't
  always judge books merely by the cover. It's a book on the stomach," he
  explained to Inkamasi, "with nine full-page photographs and about fifty more
  illustrations, each more abominable than the others. When it was published
  Sir Bernard gave copies to all his friends, because he knew they wouldn't
  read it and wanted to hear them explaining why. Brave men cut him
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>"I should like to see it," the African voice said. "I did a little medical
  work before I took up law."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's buried under Rabelais, Swift, and Ulysses at the moment,"
  Ingram grinned at Sir Bernard ,"but I'll get it out for you before you come
  again. 'Lend it you I will for half a hundred years.' But not give it. I
  retain it to keep me humble."</p>

  <p>"I think I'll go now," Inkamasi said, putting down his cup. "Thank you,
  Mrs. Ingram, for being so kind."</p>

  <p>"O well, if you will," said Roger. "Coming, Philip?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, rather," Philip answered, with a momentary private hope that he
  wouldn't have to help defend this black man against even an unpleasant
  white.</p>

  <p>"Philip," Rosamond whispered to him, with a soft pounce, "don't go. I
  don't like him."</p>

  <p>"Must," he whispered back. "Shan't be long, dearest."</p>

  <p>"We'll all go," Sir Bernard said. "The streets aren't too quiet. I'm not
  at all sure, Mr. Inkamasi, that you wouldn't be wise to take advantage of the
  Government's offer to remove friendly aliens. If you're living
  alone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The African dilated where he stood. "I will go alone," he said. "They will
  not attack me twice."</p>

  <p>"No, of course not," Roger said. "Never attack the same man twice is a
  well-known rule of mobs. Nonsense, man, no one knows who's about. I think you
  ought to stop here; you can, you know. We told you that before."</p>

  <p>"Do," Isabel put in.</p>

  <p>Inkamasi seemed to hesitate, then he said rather vaguely, "No, I'm sorry,
  I must go. There are reasons..."</p>

  <p>"Are they really vicious, Roger?" Sir Bernard asked.</p>

  <p>"Nasty little things," Roger answered. "The usual kind. I believe they'd
  have bolted before if Inkamasi and I had rushed them. He nearly scattered
  them by himself but there were just enough to feel safe."</p>

  <p>"I know them," the African said disdainfully. "There are others like them
  in my country&mdash;they would run from a lion."</p>

  <p>"As bad as that, are they?" Roger asked gravely. "Good heavens, many's the
  time I've chased a lion or two down Haverstock Hill by just shouting at them.
  Like you were doing when we came out. By the way, what were you
  shouting?"</p>

  <p>The African drew himself up and his magnificent form seemed to expand
  before the young man's eyes. He cried out: "They asked me my name and I told
  them. I am Inkamasi of the Zulus, I am the chief of the sons of Chaka, I am
  the master of the impis, I am Inkamasi the chieftain and the king."</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence; and then suddenly Roger, almost as if some
  challenge in the other's voice had stirred him to motion and speech, answered
  in the voice he had for verse. He threw up his right arm; he cried out,
  "Bayate! "; he held the Zulu rigid by the unexpected salute. And then someone
  else moved, and Roger dropped his arm and grinned and said: "Rider Haggard.
  But it's true, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"It is true," the king said. "It is the royal salute that you give, though
  I've only heard it once or twice in my life before. But I thought in England
  you'd forgotten royalty."</p>

  <p>"Well, in a kind of way we have," Roger said. "And then again in a kind of
  way we haven't. And anyhow I didn't know you really kept it in Africa."</p>

  <p>"There are those among you who would like us to forget," the Zulu
  answered. "But it isn't easy to forget Chaka. Have you forgotten Caesar?"</p>

  <p>He seemed to expect no answer; he turned again to Isabel, but this time
  with a greater air. "Good-night, Mrs. Ingram," he said. "Your husband will be
  back soon. They shan't come far. Good-night, Miss Murchison. Sir Bernard,
  will you tell me one thing I have always meant to look up about the
  stomach?"</p>

  <p>Isabel came back from the front door to Rosamond with a bewildered air.
  "Tell me," she said, "are those three taking care of him or is he taking care
  of them?"</p>

  <p>"I think it's perfectly horrible," Rosamond said. "How could you let him
  come into the house, Isabel?&mdash;everything smells of him. The king,
  indeed! It's almost profane."</p>

  <p>Isabel raised her eyebrows. "What, calling himself a king?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It was the way he talked, looking like a god," Rosamond said, almost
  hysterically. "I hate him to look like that."</p>

  <p>Isabel looked at the coffee cups. "Shall I clear them away?" she said, "or
  shall I leave them for Muriel? Roger won't call her Muriel, he says it makes
  him feel unclean. So awkward, because he always has to go and find her if he
  happens to want anything. He can't just call out 'Hi!' Don't worry, Rosamond,
  I don't suppose you'll see him again."</p>

  <p>"I hate him," Rosamond repeated. "Why didn't he stop in Africa?" She
  walked to the window. "Isabel, they won't come here, will they?"</p>

  <p>Isabel looked at the fire, herself a little shaken. In spite of her
  mockery of her sister she knew quite well what Rosamond had meant by calling
  Inkamasi "profane." It was a wild protest against the sudden intrusion of a
  new energy, the making violently real of a thing that had become less than a
  word. For a few moments royalty&mdash;a dark alien royalty&mdash;had appeared
  in the room, imposed upon all of them by the mere intensity of the Zulu
  chieftain's own strength and conviction. By virtue of that wide reading which
  both she and her husband loved, she had felt a shadow of it at times; in the
  superb lines of Marlowe or Shakespeare, in the rolling titles heard on
  ceremonial occasions at Church or in local celebrations: "The King's Most
  Excellent Majesty," "His Majesty the King-Emperor," "The Government of His
  Britannic Majesty." But on Rosamond unprepared by such imaginative experience
  the sudden consciousness of this energy and richness&mdash;believing so
  greatly in itself and operating so near her&mdash;had come with a shock of
  dismay. Besides, when all had been said, they were all on edge with the
  African news, and to have an African in your own rooms overwhelming you with
  himself&mdash;No, she didn't like it, Rosamond was right.</p>

  <p>The single bliss and sole felicity, The sweet fruition of an earthly
  crown.</p>

  <p>The divine lines came riding back into her memory. "It isn't", Roger had
  said once at one of his "popular" lectures, "what poetry says, it is what
  poetry is." These lines described kingship, but that wasn't their strength.
  They invoked kingship, they grew by their very sound into something of the
  same enormous royalty which the Zulu had for a moment worn; they were the
  safe possession in themselves of that sense of single bliss and sole felicity
  which they affected to describe. In them it was apart from her, to be enjoyed
  and endured only as she chose, it was hers. But if it went abroad, moving in
  the world not at her decision or the decision of those like her, but in its
  own right and power, the energy which was royalty and poetry dominating and
  using her by means of hands and voices and eyes ...</p>

  <p>Rosamond came back from the window to the fire, and Isabel remembered that
  she hadn't replied to her sister's question. She said: "No, they won't come
  here."</p>

  <p>Rosamond answered: "You won't see him again?"</p>

  <p>"Who&mdash;the king?" Isabel asked. "I don't suppose so."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you ought to," Rosamond said. "It's not very patriotic, is
  it? Why ever did you let Roger bring him in?"</p>

  <p>Isabel stiffened a little. "My dear little girl," she answered, "I don't
  'let' Roger. If there's any letting done," she went on, relaxing, "he does
  it. But I don't think he quite knows it."</p>

  <p>Rosamond's face suggested that Philip would be "let" or not, fairly often.
  Isabel added: "Would you rather we'd 'let' the crowd get at him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," her sister answered. "You don't know how I hate him. He's...
  abominable."</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, Rosamond," Isabel said. "You let things upset you so,
  though you do seem such a sedate little creature. I don't suppose you'll see
  him again, and if you do what difference does it make?"</p>

  <p>Rosamond moved uneasily. "Why isn't Philip stronger?" she said. "He
  needn't have gone tonight."</p>

  <p>Isabel broke into a laugh. "You want Philip to be the world's strong man
  led by a woman's hair," she said. "You can't have it, darling. Philip's no
  caveman."</p>

  <p>"I don't want a caveman," Rosamond cried out. "I hate him anyhow. He looks
  like Roger does when he quotes that beastly poetry. It isn't decent. It's
  like those horrible people on the Heath."</p>

  <p>"What on earth do you mean? What horrible people?" Isabel asked, really
  bewildered.</p>

  <p>"Disgusting beasts," Rosamond went on. "You know what I mean&mdash;all
  those brutes lying about at night. They make everything so... so loathsome.
  Why can't people be nice and behave properly?"</p>

  <p>"And not quote poetry or be kings of the Zulus," Isabel murmured. "You do
  hate a good many things, don't you? You're not going to marry Philip, I hope,
  because you hate him rather less than the other young men you know? I don't
  think he'd be entirely satisfied with that."</p>

  <p>"Philip!" Rosamond uttered, in a tone so unlike her usual deceitfully soft
  voice that Isabel looked at her in alarm. There had been in that one word
  scorn and hate and fear, almost as if Philip rather than the Zulu stood for
  everything that Rosamond most detested, as if she were aware now for the
  first time that the world was not simply Rosamond Murchison's oyster, that
  indeed it was a great deal more like an octopus, the tentacles of which she
  had seen waving at a distance in the night. The
  king&mdash;Philip&mdash;poetry&mdash;people on the Heath&mdash;African
  proclamations&mdash;certainly there was a huge something whose form lay
  hidden in the darkness and the distance without; something Rosamond had
  always avoided, unless occasionally... Isabel remembered how her small
  sister, who had always carried herself as if she pretended to disdain
  chocolates, had once secretly and greedily devoured a whole boxful. It had
  been an unpleasant episode, made worse by an ignored but definite attempt on
  Rosamond's part to make Isabel herself the culprit; only appalling physical
  results had made innocence certain. Rosamond perhaps hated an octopus that
  lay not merely without. Isabel, bending her brows at the fire, and trying to
  be lucid and loving at once, was not altogether sorry when Rosamond said
  suddenly: "I'm tired: I'm going to bed. Say good-night to Philip for me," and
  vanished.</p>

  <p>Roger, meanwhile, was walking with the others towards the house where
  Inkamasi lived, at one end of the line of four, with Philip at the other, and
  Sir Bernard and the Zulu discussing stomachs in between. It occurred to
  Ingram with a slight feeling of shame, as he heard the older man explaining
  and assenting, that although in the past Sir Bernard had always been able and
  willing to discuss literature, he himself had never been either able or
  willing to discuss stomachs. He had liked and admired the specialist, but he
  had assumed as a matter of course that his own specialization was a more
  public, even a more important, thing. To justify himself he allowed the
  suggestion to arise that Sir Bernard had been perhaps a little too
  easy-going, too disinclined to press his own interests. After all, it was in
  a different way a note of his son's character also. Philip was a nice
  creature, but he never imposed himself; he was graver and more solemn than
  his father but equally swept on the current of conversation. That Sir Bernard
  had now for many years been able unnoticed to direct any conversation to any
  end he wished, but that all ends seemed to him equally interesting, naturally
  did not occur to the younger specialist. Ingram was himself so devoted to his
  own subject and neglectful of others that he inevitably assumed a similar
  devotion and neglect in his friends, and explained their behaviour on this
  hypothesis. As he glanced sidelong at the disputants therefore he saw in Sir
  Bernard an example of a man a little ill-treated by society, and made up his
  mind to read the famous book at the first opportunity. Nor could he refrain,
  as his eye caught the Zulu's face in the light of a lamp, from reflecting
  upon how differently this stranger had dominated their emotions. The sudden
  crisis had tricked him into what was almost an absurdity. But in fact, he
  reflected, the sudden crisis was not separate from Inkamasi; it was Inkamasi.
  It was a human force that had overthrown him. His emotions, caught unguarded
  by his self-attentive mind, had moved him, and his emotions themselves had
  been moved by a stronger emotion issuing from the stranger. Rhythm had
  followed rhythm. "God damn and blast rhythm!" he thought angrily, "I will not
  use their malodorous slang." But the word had started his associations; half
  a dozen lines leapt into his mind flushed with war and royalty, from "My
  nightingale, We have beat them to their beds," down to "stunned of heaven or
  stricken pale Before the face of the King." Perhaps there was something in
  rhythm after all; perhaps Milton meant something profounder than was usually
  thought by saying that the great poet should himself be a poem; perhaps
  &mdash;</p>

  <p>"Don't you think so, Roger?" Sir Bernard asked.</p>

  <p>Ingram came back with a shock. "I beg your pardon," he said, "I wasn't
  listening. Don't I think what?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you think that the king had better not go on living alone?"</p>

  <p>"Are you alone in the house?" Ingram asked the Zulu.</p>

  <p>"I am the only sub-tenant," Inkamasi said gravely. "There is a
  landlady."</p>

  <p>"Then of course you mustn't," Ingram said. "Is this it?" They had stopped
  outside a house in one of the smaller apartment-letting roads bordering the
  Heath. "You could be attacked and done in here quite nicely&mdash;from back
  and front. You'd better come and stop with us as I told you."</p>

  <p>Inkamasi shook his head. "That is very kind of you, Mr. Ingram," he
  answered, "but I couldn't expose Mrs. Ingram to any unpleasantness."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense," said Roger. "She won't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard laid a hand on his arm. "A moment, Roger," he said. "I speak
  as a snob, but so did Saint Paul on occasion, I seem to remember, and I also
  am an Apostle. Or at least I know the Home Secretary. Now in two or three
  days the Government will be driven to arrest and intern all the Africans in
  London. No, of course, it won't want to, but it won't be able to let them be
  done to death one by one. I suggest it will be much more to the point if the
  king is staying with me, because my word will probably be taken for him. And
  he can walk in the garden and study digestion theoretically and
  practically."</p>

  <p>"You mean they'll let him alone there?" Roger said. "Yes, I suppose that's
  true. Well, we'd better look for a taxi then."</p>

  <p>"Stop a minute, Mr. Ingram," the Zulu said. "Sir Bernard, this is
  extraordinarily kind of you. But it would make it a little difficult for me
  perhaps, if I may say so. If I came to stay with you, I should be committed
  to neutrality, if not to friendship. And supposing I wanted to help my
  people?"</p>

  <p>A car came softly along the street towards them. Sir Bernard said
  dubiously, "It would necessitate, I suppose, an implied parole. But would you
  be worse off? You can't do much for them now; and if you're attacked and
  killed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused; behind them the car also stopped. Roger, glancing over his
  shoulder as he heard the king say, "I mustn't pledge myself; I mustn't be
  bound," saw Nigel Considine spring out. He gave a quick exclamation and his
  companions also looked round.</p>

  <p>"Why, Mr. Ingram," Considine said, and saluted Sir Bernard and Philip,
  "this is a happy meeting. I didn't know you were friends of my friend."</p>

  <p>"Through the introduction of a London crowd," Roger answered. "So we just
  strolled home with him."</p>

  <p>"I was afraid of that," Considine answered, "so I've come to carry him
  off." He smiled at Inkamasi, and Philip wondered why he and his father and
  Roger should suddenly seem so small standing around those two other figures.
  Sir Bernard said, "I was just suggesting that the king should stay with me."
  But the African and Considine were gazing at each other, and neither of them
  answered.</p>

  <p>"I must be free," Inkamasi said suddenly. "I must do what I choose."</p>

  <p>"You shall be free; you shall do what you choose," the other answered.
  "But you will come with me now, and presently I will set you free." He broke
  suddenly into a stream of unrecognizable syllables which the others supposed
  were Zulu, and still he held Inkamasi's eyes with his own, and the African
  stammered and began to speak and ceased, and the urgent commanding voice
  flowed on. Inkamasi put out his hand suddenly towards Sir Bernard, who was
  next him, and took his arm. He cried out suddenly in English, "But I do not
  wish&mdash;I do not choose&mdash;" then his whole figure sagged and his hand
  drew itself away. Considine said something to him even more sharply; he moved
  forward, and slowly, almost as if moving in his sleep, got into the car.
  Considine, following him, paused by the door and turned.</p>

  <p>"Sir Bernard," he said, "in a very few days I shall be leaving England.
  But I've written to you to-day to ask if you will dine with me to-morrow. I
  apologize for the short notice. If you would&mdash;and perhaps these
  gentlemen too? Let's discuss verse once more, Mr. Ingram, before I go."</p>

  <p>"Must you go?" Roger, to his surprise, heard himself saying.</p>

  <p>"All that's mine remains," Considine said, "even if embalmed or diluted
  &mdash;" he smiled, and there was victory in his face. He looked back at Sir
  Bernard, who said only, "Thank you very much! "</p>

  <p>"At eight to-morrow then," Considine said. "Good-night." He leapt into the
  car and at once it slid away. The three stood staring after it. At last
  &mdash;</p>

  <p>"Well," Sir Bernard said, "I do want to ask him about the photograph. And
  lots of people talk rather big. But if Mr. Considine can bully a Zulu prince
  who could bully us..."</p>

  <p>"I don't see anything in him particularly," Philip said. "But I was
  surprised the king let himself be persuaded."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard began to walk away. "'Persuaded,' Philip? Do you think
  'persuaded' was the word?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I don't think the king wanted to go," Philip said. "But of course I don't
  know what Considine said in Zulu, if it was Zulu."</p>

  <p>"Nor do I," said Sir Bernard. "But I know what I should say in that tone.
  I should say, 'Come on, you fool! It's me telling you.' When I was in
  practice I kept that voice for telling American millionaires to eat less.
  There are moments when I wonder whether I really like Mr. Considine."</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chap5"
     id="chap5">V.</a> &mdash; THE NEOPHYTE OF DEATH</h2>

  <p class="first">The five of them were sitting at a round
  table&mdash;Considine at the head, Sir Bernard on his right, Roger on his
  left, Inkamasi next Roger, and Philip between the king and Sir Bernard. They
  were served by two men who, Sir Bernard remarked at once, were evidently not
  of the usual servant type. They were much more like young men of his own
  class, but they were adept at their work; only they waited with an air of
  condescension and if they had occasion to speak they never said "sir" except
  indeed to Considine and the king. Considine's own manner towards them was
  that of an equal who accepts by right some special service; there existed
  between them a grave courtesy. Occasionally, while the dinner proceeded, one
  of these gentlemen in waiting would go to the door in answer to a discreet
  knock, receive a message, return to whisper it in Considine's ear, and take
  back a softly murmured answer. But such secret interruptions did not
  interfere with the general conversation, which turned at first upon the
  Rosenberg crisis.</p>

  <p>"You have talked to the legatees?" Sir Bernard said.</p>

  <p>"Why, yes," Considine smiled, "and they have taken a stand which might
  have been foreseen, which I did foresee. The solicitor and I&mdash;you
  remember Mr. Patton?&mdash;met them and the Chief Rabbi, and showed them the
  will. We had to go to them; they would not come to us. When I saw them I did
  not wonder at it. Their whole minds were given to other things. They are
  concerned&mdash;as how should they not be?&mdash;with one chief matter, the
  rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem."</p>

  <p>"Are they though?" Roger said. "And what will they do with the money?"</p>

  <p>"What do you think?" Considine said. "What do you think, Sir Bernard?
  Remember that they are fanatical in their vision and desire."</p>

  <p>"Take it," Sir Bernard answered, "and spend all that comes from it in
  Jerusalem."</p>

  <p>"Refuse it," Philip said, as Considine lifted friendly eyebrows at him
  before looking at Roger, who considered, his head on one side.</p>

  <p>"I don't know them, of course," he said, "but you encourage me to hope
  that the others are wrong. Take it&mdash;refuse it&mdash;something else. Take
  it and not take it... I know&mdash;take it and withdraw it, sell everything,
  and keep the result."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Considine answered. "They insist on selling out all the
  Rosenberg properties, and what they have from that&mdash;however large or
  small&mdash;they will spend on building the Temple again."</p>

  <p>"But the loss-?" Sir Bernard exclaimed. "It will take years, won't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"They are too old to spend years in patience," Considine said. "They will
  have it done immediately, for fear they should die before the work is
  begun."</p>

  <p>"But can't you stop them?" Philip said.</p>

  <p>"Believing what I do believe," Considine answered, "why should I stop
  them? It is a great act of creation; they prepare for Messias."</p>

  <p>"And the jewels?" Roger asked. "Are they to be sold too?"</p>

  <p>"No," Considine said; "those they will take as they are, 'an oblation to
  the Holy of Holies, a recompense for iniquity and for that one of their house
  who has touched the unclean thing.' I repeat their words."</p>

  <p>"If they ever get them to Jerusalem&mdash;" Roger suggested.</p>

  <p>"That may be part of the executor's business," Considine answered. "I
  shall do my best for them while I've the time."</p>

  <p>"It'll cause a good deal of disturbance," Sir Bernard said thoughtfully.
  "Rosenberg was interested in a great deal, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"A great deal," Considine agreed, adding with a faint smile, "Perhaps it
  was a little unfortunate that Patton, intending the best, pointed out that
  Rosenberg had religious interests which would be upset by such an action. He
  instanced a concern called the Anglo-Catholic Church and Home Adornment
  Society, which manufactured crucifixes and pictures of saints. Somehow
  Rosenberg was mixed up in it. It didn't placate them."</p>

  <p>"Patton, I suppose," Sir Bernard said, "felt that all religions meant the
  same?"</p>

  <p>"I was sorry for him," Considine said, again smiling faintly. "Even the
  Chief Rabbi could hardly quieten them. Yes, Sir Bernard. I don't say that
  Patton's wrong, but there remains the question of what religion all the
  religions mean."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps that's what the African proclamations are trying to tell us,"
  Roger said. "Do you believe in them, Mr. Considine?"</p>

  <p>"In what sense&mdash;believe?" Considine asked.</p>

  <p>"D'you think they're authentic?" Roger elaborated. "And if authentic,
  d'you think they mean anything?"</p>

  <p>"Yes and yes," Considine answered. "I see no reason why they shouldn't be
  authentic&mdash;and if they are then I think they mean something definite. It
  is a gospel, perhaps a crusade, which is approaching."</p>

  <p>"Jolly for us," Roger said. He shifted his eyes to Inkamasi, and said,
  "And what do you think?" thanking his gods that the other was next to him and
  that vocatives of address could therefore be avoided. How did one speak to a
  Zulu king?</p>

  <p>Inkamasi looked up heavily. The last twenty-four hours, Sir Bernard
  thought, seemed to have dulled the young African. His eyes went to Considine,
  who said, "Yes; let the king tell us if he thinks this gospel has
  meaning."</p>

  <p>Why did Considine, he wondered, speak so, with such high gravity in his
  voice? He waited with interest for Inkamasi's answer but when it came it took
  them but little farther. He answered the question, but no more. "Yes, I think
  it has a meaning," he said, and his eyes fell again to his plate.</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard looked back at Considine, who was (he noticed) eating very
  little, a few fragments of each course, a few sips of wine, and that with an
  air rather of courtesy than of interest or desire. He was behaving as a
  gracious host should, but what host was this who was waited on by gentlemen,
  who spoke of gospels and crusades, who seemed to dominate from his seat the
  visitors he permitted to speak freely? Sir Bernard said: "It's a little
  cheap, isn't it? 'The conquest of death'?"</p>

  <p>"You don't desire the conquest of death?" Considine asked.</p>

  <p>"I find a difficulty in understanding it here," Sir Bernard said.</p>

  <p>"Why?" Considine asked again.</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard hesitated, and Roger broke in swiftly, "Because we've never
  heard of it happening, and because we've never noticed that reading poetry
  and being in love led to anything that looked like the conquest of death. At
  least, I can't think of any other reason. What does it mean?"</p>

  <p>"There are two things it might mean," Considine said, "living for ever or
  dying and living again. And will you"&mdash;he leaned a little forward
  &mdash;"will you tell me, Mr. Ingram, that you haven't felt one or both of
  these when you deal with great verse?"</p>

  <p>Philip saw Roger's face change. He was looking steadily at Considine, and
  he continued to look for more than a minute before he answered. In that time
  the sardonic and almost bitter humour which often showed in him, as if he
  were weary of fighting that stupidity against which "the gods themselves
  contend in vain", and as if he despised himself both for strife and weariness
  &mdash;that half-angry mockery vanished, and it was with a sudden passionate
  sincerity that he said, "No, no; you're right. One dies and lives in it, but
  I can't tell how."</p>

  <p>"Only because you haven't looked that way," Considine said, with an
  illuminating smile. "You handle the stuff of the experiment, the stuff which
  the poets made, but they made it out of what is common to us all, and there
  are things which they, even they, never knew. And as for love, is there any
  one of us, since we are men and have loved, who doesn't know that there is
  within the first moments of that divine delight some actuality of the
  conquest of death?"</p>

  <p>Half by chance, his eyes rested on Philip, who, as if called by that
  commanding gaze from his habitual shyness and dislike of speech, stammered
  out: "Yes, but what is there to do? It's like that, but what can I do?"</p>

  <p>"You can know your joy and direct it," Considine answered. "When your
  manhood's aflame with love you will burn down with it the barriers that
  separate us from immortality. You waste yourselves, all of you, looking
  outwards; you give yourselves to the world. But the business of man is to
  assume the world into himself. He shall draw strength from everything that he
  may govern everything. But can you do this by doubting and dividing and
  contemplating? by intellect and official science? It is greater labour than
  you need."</p>

  <p>"Govern?" Sir Bernard put in. "What do you mean by governing the world?
  Ruling it, like Caesar?"</p>

  <p>"Caesar", Considine answered, "knew of it. I am sure he did. This man who
  had so many lovers, who could bear all hardships and use all comfort, who was
  not athlete or lover or general or statesman or writer, but only those
  because he was Caesar, who founded not a dynasty but a civilization, whose
  children we are, who dreamed of travelling to the sources of the Nile and
  sailed out to the strange island whither the Gallic boatmen rowed the souls
  of the dead, who was lord of all minds and natures, didn't he dream of the
  sources of other waters and set sail living for a land where the spirits of
  other men are but helplessly driven? Rule the world? He was the world; he
  mastered it; the power that is in it burned in him and he knew it, he was one
  with it."</p>

  <p>"Caesar died," Sir Bernard said.</p>

  <p>"He was killed, he was destroyed, but he was not beaten and he did not
  die," Considine answered. "Why does a man die but because he had not driven
  strength into the imagination of himself as living?"</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard put his hand in the pocket of his dinner jacket, but he paused
  before withdrawing it, as the subdued but powerful voice swept on. "Caesar
  had the secret then, and if Antony had had it too Europe might have been a
  place of lordlier knowledge to-day. For he could have destroyed Octavian and
  he and the Queen of Egypt in their love could have presented the capacities
  of love on a high stage before the nations. But they wasted themselves and
  each other on the lesser delights. And what failed at Alexandria was unknown
  in Judea. Ah, if Christ had known love, what a rich and bounteous Church he
  could have founded! He almost conquered death in his own way, but he was
  slain like Caesar before he quite achieved. So Christianity has looked for
  the resurrection in another world, not here. The Middle Ages wondered at
  visions of the truth&mdash;alchemy, sorcery, fountains of youth, these are
  part of the dream. The Renaissance knew the splendour but lost the meaning,
  and it was tempted by learning and scholarship, and ravaged by Calvin and
  Ignatius with their systems, and it withered into the eighteenth century.
  They did well to call that the Augustan age, for Caesar had fallen and Christ
  was but a celestial consolation. But the time is come very near now."</p>

  <p>Roger said, "But how? but how?"</p>

  <p>Considine answered, "By the transmutation of your energies, evoked by
  poetry or love or any manner of ecstasy, into the power of a greater
  ecstasy."</p>

  <p>The photograph in Sir Bernard's hand dropped on to the table; leaning
  forward, he said, his eyes bright with a great curiosity, "But do you tell us
  that you have done it?"</p>

  <p>"I have done one thing," Considine said. "I think I shall do the other
  when I have made a place for it on earth. I live, except for accident, as I
  choose and as long as I choose. It is two hundred years since I was born, and
  how near am I to-night to any kind of natural death?"</p>

  <p>He did not exalt over them or seem to speak boastfully. He leaned back in
  his chair, and with an exalted certitude his eyes held them motionless, while
  his voice put to them that serene inquiry. Clear and triumphant, he smiled at
  them, and his gentlemen stood beside him, and his wine, hardly touched,
  glowed in its glass, as his own spirit seemed to glow in the purged and
  consummate flesh that held it. Philip remembered Rosamond's
  thrice-significant body, and yet this body was more significant even than
  Rosamond's, for here there arose no lovely and mournful mist of unformulated
  desire. And Roger's mind, but half-consciously, sought to recall some great
  verbal wonder that should serve to express this wonder, and failed. Sir
  Bernard's scepticism, forbidding incredulity, left him to savour the full
  possession of an unrivalled and exquisite experience. Only the Zulu king sat
  with his head on his hand and showed no knowledge of the talk that proclaimed
  immortality present in the shape of a man.</p>

  <p>The minutes seemed to pass as the others gazed, yet they did not seem
  minutes, for time was lost. Nearer than ever before in their lives to a sense
  of abandoned discipleship, the two young men trembled before one who might be
  their predestined lord. It was Sir Bernard's voice that broke the
  stillness.</p>

  <p>"And this other thing?" he said. "What else is there you foresee?"</p>

  <p>Considine smiled once more. "This is only a part," he said. "Because I
  live, men shall live also. But they shall do greater works than I, or perhaps
  I shall do them&mdash;I do not know. To live on&mdash;that is well. To live
  on by the power not of food and drink but of the imagination itself recalling
  into itself all the powers of desire&mdash;that is well too. But to die and
  live again&mdash;that remains to be done, and will be done. The spirit of a
  man shall go out from his body and return into his body and revivify it. It
  may be done any day; perhaps one of you shall do it. There have been some who
  tried it, and though they have failed and are dead we know they were pioneers
  of man's certain empire. It is what your Christ announced &mdash;it is the
  formula of man divinised&mdash;'a little while and I am not with you, and
  again a little while and I am with you'. He was the herald of the first
  conqueror of death."</p>

  <p>There came at the door one of those discreet knocks, and a
  gentleman-in-waiting went lightly and returned to murmur a message. Considine
  listened and looked at his guests; then he added, ending what he had been
  saying, "and I will show you the intention that shall, one day, succeed."</p>

  <p>He murmured a few words to his servant who returned to the door and went
  out. Considine looked round the table and rose. "Let's go into the other room
  for our coffee and perhaps you'll be indulgent to me," he said. "I generally
  have music played after dinner&mdash;can you listen for a few minutes without
  being bored?"</p>

  <p>They murmured assurances, and stood up, following him as he moved from the
  room and on to another door which a servant opened for them. It was a long
  high room into which they came (to judge from the proportions visible), but a
  part of it was cut off by hanging curtains of an extraordinarily deep blue, a
  blue so deep that though it had not the blaze it had the richness of
  sapphire. Sir Bernard exclaimed when he saw it, and Considine said to him,
  "You see my travels also have not been in vain."</p>

  <p>"Where did you find this, then?" Sir Bernard said. "It beats the best
  stained glass I've ever seen."</p>

  <p>"It was woven for me once," Considine answered, "in a village where they
  see colour as well as St. John saw it in his vision. Sit down here, won't
  you?"</p>

  <p>There were a group of comfortable chairs at the end of the room farthest
  from the curtains, and to these the visitors were, half-ceremonially,
  ushered. The gentleman in attendance offered cigars and cigarettes to all but
  Considine; when they were settled, he went over to the curtains and at a nod
  from his master drew them a little back. Beyond, through the opening, they
  could glimpse similar panelled walls to those between which they sat. Sir
  Bernard could see at the farther end of the room a group of figures, a cello,
  and violins. The gentleman in waiting, standing in the opening, made a sign
  with his hand, withdrew to the door, and remained standing there. The music
  began.</p>

  <p>Both the Travers loved music; it was indeed&mdash;besides events&mdash;Sir
  Bernard's only emotional indulgence, and he was therefore more on his guard
  against it than perhaps even his alert intelligence altogether realized.
  Philip was not far advanced in its obedience; he, in a despised but correct
  phrase, "knew what he liked," and was humbly and properly aware that "he
  didn't know much about it." He prepared to listen, and for the first few
  minutes was engaged in trying to recognize some of the phrases that floated
  to him. He seemed to have heard them before, but he couldn't place them; they
  were followed by other sounds which he knew he couldn't place. It was, he
  supposed, "modern music"; there was at intervals something very like a
  discord. But as he listened he began to lose touch with it, and to think more
  and more of Rosamond. There was nothing surprising in this; he very often did
  think of Rosamond, with or without music. But he was thinking of her in
  harmony with the music. A rush and ripple of sound went through him and in
  his brain it was not so much sound as Rosamond's visible form, the quivering
  line of her exquisite side; and the violins swept up more quickly and her
  round full neck grew up, in that beautiful dream and her chin became visible,
  and they slowed and sighed, and there between her welcoming arms and her
  breasts was a something of fullness and satisfaction which invited him, but
  not to her. For the music that so created her form in his imagination at the
  same time swept his imagination round and round her form, but its cry drove
  him from her. She seemed to be there; almost she moved her hands to him, the
  music moulded itself into her palms, but the force of it kept him from them.
  More clearly than ever before in his waking thoughts he saw the naked
  physical beauty that was Rosamond and would have drawn her to his heart, but
  that, darkly and deeply as never before, the energy of music which was in
  that beauty invited and adjured him to attend to itself alone. His blood
  flowed, his breath came heavily, in the growing intoxication of love, but the
  harmony that caused it summoned him back from its image to its power. He felt
  himself flowing away from Rosamond, with no less but with greater passion
  than he had seemed to flow towards it. His passion had reached a point of
  trembling stillness before, and had closed then, perhaps in a kiss or an
  uncertain caress, perhaps in a separation and a departure. But now it found
  no such sweet conclusion, and still as the sources of his strength were
  opened up, and the currents of masculinity released, still he, or whatever in
  that music was he, seemed to control and compel them into subterranean
  torrents towards hidden necessities within him. Flux and reflux existed at
  once, but he could not name the end to which the reflux turned. It should be
  dispelled into some purpose, but what? but what? He seemed to cry out, and he
  heard an answer; he heard Considine saying, "It is two hundred years since I
  was born, and how near am I to any kind of death?" That might well be; this
  strength within might well carry him on through two hundred years; time was
  only its measure, not its limit; its condition, not its control. "Feed; feed
  and live," he heard a voice crying, and then the voice was itself but music,
  and the music receded, and he heard it mighty at a distance, and then less
  mighty but nearer, and at last, trembling all over, he realized how he was
  sitting, shaken and troubled, in a chair by the fireside, and how beyond the
  curtains the sound of the violins trembled also and died away. He looked
  round and met Roger's eyes, and knew that in them also recognition was
  beginning slowly to return.</p>

  <p>Roger never much cared for music, but he had not been sorry when it was
  proposed to him; imposed upon him, he was inclined to think, would have been
  a better term, since quite apart from politeness no-one would have dared
  object to Considine's obvious intention. At least, Sir Bernard might; Sir
  Bernard could do most things, but Roger was quite clear that neither Philip
  nor himself would. But he didn't object, even mentally; he rather welcomed
  the suggestion, since he, not caring for music, would have a little while to
  order his confused ideas. Considine's conversation&mdash;especially with this
  two-century climax&mdash;had got rather beyond them. Besides, he wanted to
  try and see what he meant by agreeing to the statement that all great art
  seemed to hold contemporaneous death and new life. He settled himself,
  glanced indolently towards the distant musicians, and looked for a line to
  experiment on. It ought to be a good line; he picked out, "And thus the
  Filial Godhead answering spake." The music, he was aware, had begun. Very
  well then: now. The simple analysis, the union of opposites which so often
  existed in verse, was clear enough. There was the opposition of the Latin
  "Filial" and the English "God," and of the ideas expressed in those words
  &mdash;Filial, implying subordination and obedience; Godhead&mdash;authority,
  finality. Something similar was true also of "answering" and "spake." That
  was elementary&mdash;but about death... the music was getting in his way;
  bother the music&mdash;the words were becoming a kind of guide to it, not to
  his thoughts. His thoughts showed him the lovely and delicate manipulation
  of... of what? Words; the association of words: "the Filial" &mdash;a twist
  and cry of the violins broke sharply on him&mdash;"Godhead."
  "Filial"&mdash;he was filial to something; filial&mdash;the subordination of
  himself in the presence of something, of godhead, the godhead this triumphant
  sound was speeding through his consciousness; filial &mdash;the smooth vowels
  and labials, the word that was he sliding so easily in and through the energy
  of the whole line, an energy that broke out in the explosive consonants of
  "Godhead." Filial&mdash;that was to die, to be drawn down by this music into
  reconciliation with something that answering spake. But it was he that
  answering spake... answering, answering, answering, what but that which
  spake?"Spake, spake," the notes sang out; not saying "spake" but sounding it;
  they were speaking. It&mdash;the word, the sound, was itself speaking;
  "spake" was only an echo of what it said. "The Filial Godhead answering
  spake"&mdash;and Roger Ingram was being left behind, even the Roger Ingram
  that loved the line, for the line was driving him down to answer it by dying
  and living, to be nothing but a filial godhead. Milton was but a name for a
  particular form of this immortal energy: the line was but an opportunity for
  knowing the everlasting delight, the ecstasy of all those elements that
  combined in its passionate joy, knowing it by being part of it. His intellect
  had shown him the marvellous glories of the line, but as he passed into it
  and between its glories his intellect revealed itself but as one of the
  elements. A moral duty swept him on. This energy was to be possessed, to
  possess him, and then&mdash;then he would have time to find yet greater
  powers even than that. Power, power&mdash;"the Power so-called through sad
  incompetence of human speech"; even the great poets were but sad
  incompetence; nothing but the transmutation of even the energy they gave
  could be an answer to the energy they took from some source beyond them. He
  hung, poised, unconscious of himself repeating words silently and very
  slowly, opening himself to them: "sad incompetence of human
  speech"&mdash;"thus the Filial Godhead answering spake." And the violins
  descanted on it, and slowly died away; and as slowly he came to himself and
  looked up to meet Philip's welcoming and inquiring eyes.</p>

  <p>The music ceased. Considine stood up and came over to his guests. "Did you
  care for it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>No-one found it possible to answer immediately; at last Sir Bernard, with
  a sudden movement, came to his feet. He looked at Considine, and against the
  other's majestic form his smaller figure seemed to gather itself together. He
  looked, and said, in a voice not without a note of victory, "Well, I kept my
  head."</p>

  <p>"You are proud of that?" Considine asked disdainfully. Sir Bernard
  shrugged. "It fulfils its function," he said. "I like to take my music like a
  gentleman. What was it?"</p>

  <p>"It was made by one of my friends," Considine said. "He had overcome all
  things except music, but that lured him to spend his power and he died. We
  feed on what he did that we may do more than he."</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;" Roger began, arrested by something in these words, "but do
  you mean&mdash;is it a waste to make music?"</p>

  <p>"Mustn't it be?" the other asked. "If you want more than sound it's a
  waste to spend power making sound, as it's a waste to spend on the beloved
  what's meant to discover more than the beloved."</p>

  <p>"But this means the death of everything!" Roger exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"And if so?" Considine asked. "Yet it isn't so. It's possible to make out
  of the mere superfluity of power greater things than men now spend all their
  power on. The dropping flames of that fire are greater than all your pyres of
  splendour. And when death itself is but passion of ecstasy, we will make
  music such as you couldn't bear to hear, and we will be the fathers of the
  children who shall hear it. Listen to the prophecy."</p>

  <p>He turned and nodded to the gentleman in waiting, who had after the music
  ceased again drawn the curtains, and now went out of the room. Considine left
  his guests together and returned to a small table near the curtains. The only
  light in the room came from a tall standard near him, so that Sir Bernard and
  the others were clustered in the shadows and not clearly to be seen.</p>

  <p>Roger glanced at the African, sitting by him almost as if asleep, and then
  looked back again at Considine. He stood there, an ordinary gentleman in an
  ordinary dinner jacket, but the black of the clothes and the tie, the white
  of the front and the cuffs, gathered into a kind of solemn insignia. Roger
  saw him, against the immense and universal sapphire of the draperies behind
  him, a figure in hieratic dress, motionless, expectant, attentive, having
  power to give or to withhold, as if an Emperor of Byzantium awaited between
  the East and the West the approach of petitions he only could fulfil. His
  hands were by his sides, his head was a little thrown back, his eyes were
  withdrawn as if he meditated, and behind him the vast azure hung as if it
  were a cloak some attendant had but that moment removed and still held spread
  out before he folded it. Modern, contemporary&mdash;antique, mythical
  &mdash;neither of these were the truth. He stood as something more than
  either, being both and more than both. It was Man that stood there, man
  conscious of himself and of his powers, man&mdash;powerful and victorious,
  bold and serene, a culmination and a prophecy. Time and space hung behind
  him, his background and his possession, themselves no more separate but woven
  in a single vision, the colour of the living background to that living
  domination. "Death itself but passion of ecstasy"&mdash;death itself might
  well have been lying at those feet in black, shining and pointed gear, as in
  delicate armour, at the direction of the hands which fell from between the
  stiff, shining and sacerdotal cuffs. The ritual of a generation was changed
  into a universal ritual; so for Philip Rosamond had turned her dresses into
  significance; so always and in all places have the gods when they walked
  among men changed into their own permanent sacramental habits the accidental
  raiment of the day.</p>

  <p>Phrases of the talk rushed back into Roger's mind&mdash;other phrases of
  the proclamation of the High Executive&mdash;"moments of the exalted
  imagination": here and now was such a moment, here and now that imagination
  made itself visible before him and overwhelmed him with its epiphany.</p>

  <p>The door opened. Considine turned his head. The gentleman in waiting stood
  aside and said in a low clear voice: "Colonel Mottreux and Herr Nielsen." Two
  men came into the room. The first was a tall, lean, rather hatchet-faced man,
  not unlike Roger himself, but with fiercer and more hungry eyes, as Roger's
  might have been had all the real placability which his love of Isabel and his
  service of poetry gave him been withdrawn. He looked like a soldier but an
  ambitious soldier who doubts his future; only as he bowed abruptly to
  Considine he showed a not merely military subordination; his eyes fell and
  did not for a moment recover. There came after him a different figure&mdash;a
  man German-built, sunburnt and weather-beaten, but still young, or young
  anyhow he seemed to those who watched, though in the new spiritual air they
  breathed they were aware that youth and age might have other meanings than
  usual in terms of time. He bowed much more deeply than Mottreux, and once
  well in the room he halted while the other went forward.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mottreux," Considine said, not moving, but smiling and holding
  out his hand. Colonel Mottreux pressed it lightly, almost deferentially; his
  eyes went to the guests.</p>

  <p>"These gentlemen have been dining with me," Considine said. "I've wished
  them to remain a little. We'll talk of your other business later, Mottreux.
  Let Herr Nielsen tell me his purpose first."</p>

  <p>Mottreux stood aside and motioned to Nielsen who came forward and halted
  two or three steps away.</p>

  <p>Considine stretched out his hand, and the other bowed over it,
  genuflecting a little at the same time as if he were in a royal or sacerdotal
  presence. But he came erect again and faced his suzerain with an air almost
  as august as his own. His face was ardent with a profound resolution; to say
  that "his soul was in his eyes" was no description but a definition. They
  burned with a purpose and Considine's looked back at them as if he received
  that purpose and confirmed it.</p>

  <p>"Why have you come to me?" he asked, gently, and as if it were a ritual
  rather than a necessary interrogation.</p>

  <p>"I have come to beg for the permission," the other said.</p>

  <p>"The permission is in yourself," Considine answered. "I only hear it, but
  that it's right that I should do. Are you a child of the Mysteries?"</p>

  <p>"Since you showed them to me," Nielsen said.</p>

  <p>"That was fifty years ago," Considine answered, and the watchers in the
  shadow thrilled and trembled as they heard the calm voice, and that which,
  equally calm, replied, "I've followed them since."</p>

  <p>"Tell me a little," Considine said, and the other considering, answered,
  "I have endured love and transmuted it. I have found, when I was young, that
  the sensual desires of man can be changed into strength of imagination and a
  physical burden become the bearer of the burden. I have transmuted masculine
  sex into human life. I am one of the masters of love. And I've done this with
  all things&mdash;whatever I have loved or hated, I have poured the strength
  of every love and hate into my own life and what is behind my life, and now I
  need love and hate no more."</p>

  <p>He paused, and Considine said, shooting one swift glance towards his
  guests: "Is this a greater or lesser thing than hate or love?"</p>

  <p>"Sir, it's strength and health beyond describing," Nielsen said. "But it's
  now that I long to go farther."</p>

  <p>Considine turned and faced him full, asking "What will you do now?"</p>

  <p>"I will go down to death and come again living," the other said.</p>

  <p>Considine's eyes searched him long in silence: then he said slowly, "You
  may not come again."</p>

  <p>"Then let me die in that moment," the other cried out. "That's nothing; it
  doesn't matter; if I fail, I fail. But it's not by dreaming of failure that
  the master of death shall come. Haven't you told us that this shall be? and
  it's in my heart now to raise my body from death. I'm not like you; I'm not
  necessary in this moment to the freeing of men; let me set free the fire
  that's in us; let me go to break down the barriers of death."</p>

  <p>He flung out his hands and caught Considine's; he poured upon his lord the
  throbbing triumph of his belief and his desire. Considine's voice, fuller and
  richer than any of the hearers had known it, answered him: "The will and the
  right are yours, not mine. I'm here only to purge, not to forbid. There must
  be those who make the effort and some may never come again, but one at any
  moment shall. Go, if you will; master corruption and the grave; make mortal
  imagination more than immortal; die and live."</p>

  <p>Nielsen dropped on a knee, but his face was turned upwards to Considine's
  who, stooping, laid his hands on the other's shoulders. Behind the two
  exalted figures the deep blue of the curtains seemed to be troubled as if
  distance itself were shaken with the cry and the command. The splendour of
  colour quivered with the neighbourhood of the ecstasy of man imagining the
  truth of his being, and creating colour by the mere movements of his
  imagination. The two were alone, alone in a profound depth of azure distance,
  so greatly did their passion communicate itself to the things that had been
  made out of like passion. The woven colour and the woven music had been made
  at some similar depth of devotion, and all that mingled intensity swept
  through and filled the room, so that the imaginations of Roger and Philip
  felt and moved in it, and Philip, panting almost with terror, felt the music
  he had heard and the colour he saw and the figures before him gather and lose
  themselves in one piercing consciousness of Rosamond, which yet was not
  Rosamond but that of which Rosamond was a shape and a name; and Roger felt
  phrases, words, half-lines, pressing on him, and yet not words or lines but
  that which they defined and conveyed-and before them Considine cried again to
  the ardent postulant of transmuted energy: "Die then, die, exult and
  live."</p>

  <p>Only the Zulu king lay back as if asleep in his chair, and in his Sir
  Bernard, freed from the temptation of music, watched and savoured and keenly
  enjoyed every moment of the incredibly multitudinous and changing fantasy
  which was mankind. He wouldn't deny that he was looking at a man two hundred
  years old telling a man of, say, seventy to die and live again; it might be
  &mdash;it was unusual but it might be. He couldn't imagine himself wanting to
  die and live, because that (it seemed to him) would be to spoil the whole
  point of death. The worst of death was that it was the kind of experience it
  was very difficult to appreciate in the detached mood of the spectator, let
  alone the connoisseur. But he had done his best in his own case by rehearsing
  to himself&mdash;and occasionally to Philip&mdash;all the ironies which the
  approach of death often releases on a man. "I may babble obscenities or make
  a pious confession to Caithness," he had said. "Or I may just lie about and
  cry for days. One never knows. Try and enjoy it for me, Philip, if I'm past
  it. I should like to feel that somebody did, and death so often undoes all
  one's own hypotheses, even the hypothesis that one isn't important." But he
  feared that Philip wouldn't find it easy to enjoy.</p>

  <p>He thought of this for a moment as he watched Nielsen rising slowly to his
  feet; he thought of it as he looked at the benediction which Considine's face
  shed on the new adventurer. They were still speaking to each other but he
  couldn't hear what was being said; he saw Mottreux come forward, and then he
  saw the Colonel and Nielsen bowing and going to the door. He drew a deep
  breath and lay back in his chair, but he was immediately distracted by Philip
  who said in a low voice, "I can't stand any more of this; I'm going."</p>

  <p>On the other side Roger also moved. "It's true," he said. "He's
  right."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard, a little startled, looked at him. Was Roger becoming a
  convert to this new gospel? He said, "You believe in him?"</p>

  <p>"No," Roger said, "but I believe he knows what poetry is, and I've never
  met a man before who did."</p>

  <p>Before Sir Bernard could answer Considine came over to them, and
  instinctively, in fear or hostility or homage, they all rose. "You see," he
  said, "there are those who will try the experiment."</p>

  <p>"Must I really believe," Sir Bernard said, "that that friend of yours is
  going to commit suicide with the idea of animating his body all over
  again?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly that," Considine said.</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard sighed a little. "It is a religion," he said. "And I hoped
  that man was becoming sane. I think I should dislike you, Mr. Considine, if
  dislike were ever really worth while."</p>

  <p>"And I should have despised you once, Sir Bernard," Considine answered,
  "but not now. Before you die you shall know that the world is being made
  anew."</p>

  <p>He had hardly spoken when they heard without, as if it echoed, applauded,
  and proclaimed his words, a sound distant indeed but recognizable, though for
  a moment they doubted. It was the noise of guns firing. Faint and certain it
  reached them. Philip and Roger jumped, and even Sir Bernard turned his head
  towards the window. Considine, watching them, smiled. "Can it be the African
  planes?" he asked ironically. "Has intellect failed to guard its
  capital?"</p>

  <p>A shout or two came up to them from without, the noise of running feet, a
  whistle, several cars passing at great speed. Sir Bernard looked back at
  Considine. "Are you bombing London then?" he asked politely.</p>

  <p>"I," Considine laughed at him. "Am I the High Executive? Ask the Jews who
  believe in Messias, or Mr. Ingram who believes in poetry, or your son who (I
  think) believes in love, or the king who believes in kingship, ask them what
  power threatens London to-night. And ask them if they think glory can be
  defeated by gunpowder."</p>

  <p>"I should think it might, if glory is making use of petrol," Sir Bernard
  said. "I'm sorry that in the circumstances perhaps we'd better go. If your
  friend's blown to bits by a bomb he'll find it a trifle difficult to revivify
  his body, won't he?"</p>

  <p>"The Christian Church for a considerable time believed it could be done,"
  Considine said. "But I forget that you're not even a Christian."</p>

  <p>Roger broke in. "My God!" he said, harshly, "are you bombing London?"</p>

  <p>Considine changed in an instant from mockery to seriousness. "Be at ease,"
  he said. "Mrs. Ingram's perfectly safe&mdash;except indeed from the mobs whom
  alone your wise brains have left to be the degraded servants of ecstasy. The
  only deaths to-night will be sacrifices of devotion."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard walked towards the door; a white and bewildered Philip went
  along with him. Roger lingered a moment.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether I hate or adore you," he said, "and I don't know
  whether you're mad or I. But&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But either way," Considine interrupted, "there is more in verse than talk
  about similes and metres, and you know it. Hark, hark, there is triumph
  speaking to man."</p>

  <p>The guns sounded again and Roger ran after his friends.</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chap6"
     id="chap6">VI.</a> &mdash; THE MASS AT LAMBETH</h2>

  <p class="first">Before Sir Bernard and Philip reached Colindale Square,
  peace had again filled the night. The raid, if raid it had been, seemed to
  have been driven off, although the house, when they reached it, was awake and
  vocal. Caithness was waiting for them in the library, anxious but not
  perturbed. He knew nothing more than they did, the guns had been sounding, at
  intervals and at a distance, for something under an hour, then they had
  ceased. The police had been hastily instructed to spread the news that all
  was clear, and (in less loud tones) that no damage whatever had been done.
  Materially this might be true, but not mentally. The agitation which shook
  London was as much worse than that which the German raids had caused as the
  fear of negro barbarism was more fundamental than that of the Prussian.
  London hid and trembled; the jungles were threatening it and the horrors that
  dwelled in them. It was but for a few minutes&mdash;less than an hour
  &mdash;but it had happened. The morning would perhaps increase the fear when
  it was uttered; for the moment darkness and separation made it private.</p>

  <p>Caithness listened with profound attention to the account Sir Bernard gave
  him. But he showed a distant tendency to discuss it in language which, though
  hostile, was far too like Considine's to please his friend or reassure
  Philip. He seemed to find most difficulty in accepting the possibility of
  Considine's age&mdash;which, as Sir Bernard pointed out, was due to the fact
  that he disapproved of Considine's ideas. "If you thought he was a saint
  &mdash;your kind of saint&mdash;you'd think it might be a miracle," he
  complained. "You will fall back on the supernatural to explain the unusual.
  But that doesn't matter: the real problem is whether he's the High
  Executive."</p>

  <p>"You say he talked as if he was," Caithness said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but this magniloquent kind of rhetoric can never be trusted," Sir
  Bernard said. "He might be merely mad. And if he is there's no sense in
  talking to the Prime Minister about him. Even if I do he won't be there, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"The man I'm thinking about", Caithness said, "is the Zulu. You told me
  last night he said he was a Christian."</p>

  <p>"In a parenthesis, while we were talking stomach," Sir Bernard said. "To
  explain the strength of his digestion, no doubt."</p>

  <p>"And to-night," Caithness went on, unheeding the last remark, "to-night he
  was different?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Ian, you haven't begun to understand Mr. Considine," Sir Bernard
  answered. "Every one was different. Roger went off plunged in a reverie,
  which is very unlike Roger. And&mdash;" he glanced at his son and changed the
  sentence-"and I was quite incapable of connected thought. And the king
  &mdash;as everybody calls him, so let's&mdash;the king was comatose."</p>

  <p>Caithness began walking up and down the room. "I don't like it," he said.
  "I don't like the sound of any of it. And especially I don't like a Christian
  to be under this man's influence or in his power. If he can affect
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What on earth harm&mdash;" Sir Bernard began, and was interrupted by the
  priest.</p>

  <p>"He evidently thinks he's got hold of some infernal power," Caithness went
  on, "and if&mdash;if by the wildest possibility he were mixed up with this
  African delirium&mdash;are we to leave one of the Faith exposed to his
  control? He's done it harm enough already. God knows what he may be doing to
  him. He may have hypnotized him into obedience."</p>

  <p>"Literally", Sir Bernard asked, "or metaphorically?"</p>

  <p>"What does it matter which?" Caithness threw back. "D'you suppose one's
  worse than the other? Are we to have a Christian spiritually martyred here
  among us?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Sir Bernard said. "St. Iago, and charge, Spain!
  Where?"</p>

  <p>But Caithness took no notice; he stood still and silent for a minute, and
  Sir Bernard observed, with interest, that he was praying. Caithness, he
  reflected, had always been a little inclined to call up his own spiritual
  reserves under such a quite honest pretence of invoking direction, though he
  was always rather careful to keep the command in his own hands: Sir Bernard
  couldn't remember that God had ever been known to disagree with Ian, anyhow
  in ecclesiastical affairs. It was therefore with a sense of gratified
  accuracy that he heard the priest say, "Well, I'm going up there."</p>

  <p>"What, now?" he asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Caithness answered. "And if this Zulu is still there I shall
  insist on seeing him."</p>

  <p>"And supposing Mr. Considine refuses?" Sir Bernard asked.</p>

  <p>Caithness looked at him abstractedly. "O I don't think he'll refuse," he
  said. "He either won't care to or he won't dare to. Will you come and show me
  the house?"</p>

  <p>"Anything for a quiet life," his friend answered. "Even to conducting a
  Christian lion to a Zulu victim. What a world! And Rosenberg found it
  uninteresting. But I dare say he didn't know many Christians. I warn you,
  Ian," he went on as they left the room, "that if Considine's there I shall
  pretend I don't know you, and that I've come back for a cigarette case
  presented to me by grateful patients. Because if he isn't the High
  Executive&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And if he is?" Caithness asked. "If he is?"</p>

  <p>"That," Sir Bernard said, "is my only hope of an excuse for driving you. O
  no, no taxis, thank you. If I have to help abduct a king, let me do it in my
  own car, so as to have a right to put up a gold plate: 'In this car His
  Majesty the King of the Zulus once fled from the conquest of death.' Why
  don't you like the conquest of death, Ian?"</p>

  <p>"That's all been done," Caithness said, and Sir Bernard, as they came to
  the garage, gave a little moan. "Not in Considine's sense it hasn't," he
  said. "You're just confused. O well&mdash;but I think you'd probably like
  Considine if you could ever get to know him. Get in, and we'll try."</p>

  <p>It was a little after midnight when they ran through Hampstead. Sir
  Bernard stopped the car at the corner of the road, and the two of them walked
  up it. There were more windows lit up than was usual, owing to the raid, but
  Considine's house was in darkness. They went up the steps and Caithness rang.
  In a few minutes he rang again, and again.</p>

  <p>"He's probably directing the raid," Sir Bernard said. "Or flying up to
  meet the planes. Levitation, I think they call it; some of your saints used
  to do it. Similar to the odour of sanctity."</p>

  <p>Caithness said: "We shall have to find a window."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard sighed happily. "What a night we're having!" he said,
  following his friend. "No, Ian, not that one: it's too near the road.
  Somewhere away at the back. One takes off one's coat, I believe, and presses
  it against the glass before striking a sharp blow in the centre. We ought
  really to have treacle and brown paper. You wouldn't care to wait while I
  went and knocked up the nearest grocer for some golden syrup? We could use
  the rest of the tin as an excuse for calling. I wonder if at his age
  Considine can eat golden syrup without getting himself all sticky? That'd
  almost be worth living for."</p>

  <p>But since at the back of the house there was at least one window a little
  open there was no need to resort to these more uncertain methods. The two
  gentlemen pushed it up, very quietly, and entered. Sir Bernard, scrambling
  in, thought to himself, "'I will encounter darkness as a bride,' I hope she
  likes me." Within all was silent. They found their way cautiously along, and
  emerged at last in the hall, where Sir Bernard assumed direction. Either the
  house was for the time empty or everyone was asleep. The second alternative
  was so unlikely that they permitted themselves to assume the first.</p>

  <p>They did not, however, relax their caution until they came at last to the
  room where they had heard the music and seen Nielsen, and left the king in
  his sleep and Considine in his triumph. Sir Bernard felt that they were not
  treading so delicately but that one heard them; he seemed to see Considine
  standing far off, his head a little turned, listening to them, and he
  wondered if there would be some sudden interference in some unknown manner.
  But though the suspense endured it did not increase, and in the light of the
  room they saw Inkamasi still sitting in his chair.</p>

  <p>Caithness went quietly across the room towards the Zulu, Sir Bernard
  paused by the door, listening for footsteps, and watching what went on. The
  priest kneeled down by the chair, and, after studying the African's face for
  a few minutes, said in a low voice of energy, "Inkamasi, what are you doing
  here?"</p>

  <p>The Zulu stirred under that intense regard and intense voice and answered,
  "Inkamasi waits for him who caused sleep."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard jerked suddenly, for the voice was more like Considine's own
  than the Zulu's, yet fainter than either, as if from a distance the master of
  substitution interposed between the priest and the sleeper. Caithness said,
  "Do you sleep by your own will?"</p>

  <p>"I watch by the will of him that rules me," the other answered
  monotonously. "Inkamasi is hidden within me. It's I yet not I that
  sleep."</p>

  <p>"In the name of the Maker of. Inkamasi," Caithness said with superb and
  deep confidence, "in the Name of the Eternal and Everlasting, in the Name of
  Immanuel, I bid you awake."</p>

  <p>"I do not know them," the sleeper answered, "and I keep their sound from
  Inkamasi lest he hear."</p>

  <p>"By the virtue in created life, by the union of Man with God, by the
  Mother of God in the world and in the soul, I command you to wake," Caithness
  said.</p>

  <p>"I do not know them, and I keep their sound from Inkamasi lest he hear,"
  the sleeper answered.</p>

  <p>"In the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, be silent and go
  out of him," Caithness exclaimed, making the sign of the cross over the Zulu.
  "Inkamasi, Inkamasi, by the faith you hold, by the baptism and the Body of
  Christ, I bid you wake."</p>

  <p>The sleeper did not answer but he did not move. As if some closed powers
  hung, poised and equal, over or within him he lay silent. Sir Bernard
  remembered how, but a little before, he had seen Considine standing in front
  of the azure profundity of the curtain, which still hung there, as in the
  depth of space, and it seemed to him as if from the spectral image of that
  figure and from the kneeling priest two separate currents of command impinged
  upon the king and in the moment of meeting neutralized their strength. The
  central heart of the Zulu beat beyond those conflicting and equal
  intensities, in oblivion of the outer world yet perhaps in liberty. He waited
  to see what more Caithness could do. But though the priest concentrated his
  will and intention, though he tried once or twice to speak, the stillness was
  prolonged. He had silenced the speaker in Inkamasi, but the very effort held
  him also silent. He strove to impose his determination upon the Zulu, but he
  could not pass beyond the gate which he had succeeded in reaching; he could
  not call the other back through it. He knelt praying by the chair and the
  minutes went by.</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard thought, "We can't possibly stop here. We don't know where
  Considine's gone, we don't know whether he's coming back, and I should hate
  him to have to worry the exalted imagination with such a detail as what to do
  with us. He might want us for some new experiment in the conquest of death. I
  wonder whether&mdash;" He peered out through the door; nothing was happening.
  He turned back into the room. "If Ian and Considine are locked in a spiritual
  chest-to-chest wrestle," he thought, "perhaps it's time for a mere
  intellectualist to have a word. A timid tentative word."</p>

  <p>He went across the room and round the back of the chair. His eyes met the
  priest, and by the force of old friendship communicated something of his
  purpose. Caithness, still silent and intent, moved his hands from where they
  rested on the Zulu's shoulders. Sir Bernard put his hand very gently under an
  arm, and as gently lifted it forward. It yielded easily to his pressure and
  when that pressure was removed dropped back again. Fearful of speaking lest
  some rash word should bring down the balance against him, Sir Bernard went
  lightly to the front of the chair, and picked up the Zulu's hands. He drew
  them gently, gently forward and upward, he pulled them towards him till the
  arms were extended, he pulled with the least little extra firmness, and
  easily as the hands moved the body moved also. The king rose to his feet,
  following that physical direction, and Sir Bernard took a step backward
  towards the door. Inkamasi followed him. Caithness, still caught in spiritual
  combat, also rose, but he made no movement to assist; he left that visible
  action to his ally. Sir Bernard, taking another step backward, waited till
  the Zulu was in movement, then he slipped to one side and, still holding the
  left hand in his own left, put his right fingers on Inkamasi's back. He
  pressed gently; as if automatically the Zulu moved on. Slowly they passed to
  the door, Sir Bernard on one side, Caithness on the other. They went in front
  of that hanging curtain of blue, and for a moment Sir Bernard could have
  believed that they were drawing Inkamasi out of its influence and depth,
  could have wondered whether indeed he were doing well thus to interfere on
  behalf of one magic against another. "What doest thou here, Gehazi?" he said
  to himself. "Do I really want to save a jungle-king for Ian's passion? One
  religion or another, it's all the same&mdash;'She comes, she comes, the sable
  throne behold, Of Night primeval and of Chaos old.' I suspect I'm just
  getting a little of my own back on Considine. Never mind; it's too late to
  change now. Round the corner&mdash;so."</p>

  <p>They moved on, that curious mingling of intention directing the passive
  African, through the still house, down the steps, to the waiting car. Still
  in silence, Sir Bernard made the other two get in at the back and himself
  returned to the driving wheel. Once more they ran through London, and in the
  cold October night brought the sleeper to Colindale Square. There at last,
  once in the library, Sir Bernard turned to Caithness. "And now what?" he
  said. "Because I can't personally conduct this Christian of yours about the
  world for the rest of my life. And I don't, just at the moment, see what you
  propose to do."</p>

  <p>"I know what I shall do," Caithness said. "Do you notice he moves more of
  his own will since we brought him out of the house?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't quite say that," Sir Bernard said, "but he needs less
  direction. It is a kind of hypnotism, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"It's like a locking up of the outer faculties in his master's will,"
  Caithness said. "But the others are there, only they can't hear us. They may
  hear a greater than us. To-morrow a voice shall call to him that no tyrant
  shall silence."</p>

  <p>"Meaning&mdash;" Sir Bernard said. "My dear Ian, you've no idea of how
  like Mr. Considine's conversation yours is."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow", Caithness said, "I will offer the soul and mind of this man
  to our Lord in the operation of the Mass. The Archbishop will let us use the
  chapel at Lambeth."</p>

  <p>"And you think that will help him?" Sir Bernard asked with interest.</p>

  <p>"Subject always to the will of God," Caithness answered.</p>

  <p>"O quite," Sir Bernard assented. "The will of God, of course. Heads I win,
  tails you lose. However&mdash;And now do you think we dare go to bed?"</p>

  <p>"I shan't myself," Caithness said. "I'll watch by him to-night. But you go
  on."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard looked dubious. "I don't think I should feel quite
  comfortable," he said. "Suppose the High Executive suggested to him a little
  exalted imagination of freedom, I don't know that you could stop him. I
  think, Ian, we'll both settle down with him. I really don't feel capable of
  undressing a Zulu king; we haven't the stuff to do the grand coucher
  properly. Why is royalty so impressive?"</p>

  <p>"It's the concentration of political energy in a person," Caithness said
  thoughtfully, "the making visible of hierarchic freedom, a presented moment
  of obedience and rule."</p>

  <p>"I think I prefer the Republic," Sir Bernard said; "it's the more abstract
  dream. But I'm too tired to discuss it. Let's settle as well as we can. Will
  you have the divan?"</p>

  <p>Neither of them slept much&mdash;indeed Caithness remained wakeful in his
  chair, except when for change of comfort he walked up and down a little. Sir
  Bernard, having slipped away for a few minutes to change, locked the door,
  took the key with him, and stretched himself on the divan, but only to feel
  himself revolving the events of the evening. Once his mind was relaxed it
  became conscious that it was more distressed than it had known. The impact of
  these high, strange, and violent ideas, the circumstances of colour, music,
  and ceremonial with which they had been accompanied, the dim suggestion of
  vivid personalities accepting and serving them and ringing around Considine's
  own exalted figure, the dimmer but not negligible possibility that here in
  London moved the mysterious High Executive of the African declarations, the
  great intention of Nielsen's voice, the threat and anger of the guns
  answering some threat hurled from the hidden places of the negro nations, the
  obedience of Inkamasi to some distant control, the passion of Ian
  Caithness-all these things shook his sedate and happily ironical brain. This
  was an irony which his habits found it difficult to bear, for it struck at
  the root of his own irony. And one nearer thing troubled him yet more
  closely. There had been five of them at dinner that night, and three of them
  had gone together, and of those three how many had come away? Roger and
  Philip had gone with him, but it was not the same Roger that had parted from
  him afterwards, and Philip was labouring under some unaccustomed burden. He
  felt obscurely alone&mdash;his own house, his own friends, were grown alien
  to him; nowhere in all the world was there one intimate with whom he could
  mock at the monstrous apparitions that loomed on the outskirts of his mind,
  closing round the slender spires and delicate gardens, in which of late its
  chosen civilization had moved. Not so much the facts, though they were
  grotesque enough, but the manner of the facts, disturbed him&mdash;the
  triumph, the fanaticism, the shadows of ecstasy. Other memories forced
  themselves on him&mdash;an insane political hot-gospeller in Hyde Park,
  Caithness vestmented in an ecclesiastical ceremony, the antique faces of the
  Jews in the crude reproductions of the papers, a look in Philip's eyes as he
  watched Rosamond, the silly raucous voices of the crowd in the streets: where
  was detachment, where was contemplation there? Amidst all the gracious
  achievements of the mind what wild rites of self-immolation were again to be
  practised? the rich blue of those curtains was marvellous in its beauty, but
  in what depth of rapturous experience had it been woven? and was that
  rapture, with all that must accompany it of danger and terror, indeed
  desirable for man? Someone had cried out somewhere lately&mdash;"I will
  encounter darkness as a bride"&mdash;"She comes... the sable throne
  behold"... to encounter that as a bride; the words meant to him something far
  beyond his nature. Darkness was to be exiled, not embraced; and when, as in
  the hour of death, it could no longer be exiled, it should be received with a
  proud and courteous if constrained hostility. It was Roger who had cried:
  Roger who loved some mysterious energy that he himself had never found, or
  finding had mistrusted and banished. He looked from his couch on the shaded
  room, the dark face of the African chieftain, the pacing figure of the priest
  of crucifixion; he listened to find if he should again hear the sound of the
  guns that warned him of a crusade which had spies and devotees in the city
  where he lay, in the friends by whom he was surrounded, nay, in the very
  spirit which moved in his obscure self.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he rose early the next morning with a mind still determined
  to enjoy its stand against enemies within and without, and gravely put his
  telephone at Ian's disposal in order that the priest might speak to Lambeth.
  It seemed to Sir Bernard very unlikely that the Archbishop would be up, but
  either he was or he was caused to be. After a prolonged conversation
  Caithness came back to say merely that all had been arranged. Philip, who
  apparently had also had very little sleep, offered to drive, more for the
  sake of doing something, his father suspected, than because he was very clear
  what was supposed to be happening. But it was a perfectly good idea, Sir
  Bernard thought; he himself had done all, and rather more than all, that
  could be thought reasonable, and if Caithness's Deity were going to fight
  Nigel Considine for the soul of the Zulu king, he would himself maintain
  towards such fantastic spiritual warfare a beautiful neutrality. He liked
  Inkamasi as an individual; he sympathized with him as an African; he was
  prepared to be interested in him as a king. But he was certainly not prepared
  to help decide whether he should turn out a fervent Christian or a submissive
  Considinian; the powers concerned could settle that between them. He saw the
  others off, and returned first to have breakfast and then to ring up Roger
  and urge on him the advisability of removing himself, Isabel and Rosamond to
  Colindale Square in case of further air-raids. Roger made some objection
  about correspondence, but a long discussion conducted between Sir Bernard at
  one end and sometimes Roger, sometimes Isabel, sometimes both of them at the
  other, and sometimes merely between themselves, ended in their accepting his
  offer. "I had thought of leaving London," Sir Bernard said, "but if we decide
  to go, we can all go together. It'll be kinder to Philip for you to come
  here, and I have the finest sort of cellar if it's needed."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Philip at the steering-wheel was trying to order his own
  distracted mind. He certainly hadn't had much sleep; the evening had shaken
  him far too much. That curious music, so closely allied to Rosamond yet ever
  avoiding her, calling and driving him to look for something that seemed to
  hide in her yet had to be found for its own sake not for hers, that music
  would by itself have prevented sleep. And when to it was added the obscure
  talk of Considine's&mdash;and talk that meant something. The moment of vision
  in Isabel's kitchen, when Rosamond's arm had lain like a bar of firmamental
  power across the whole created universe, dividing and reconciling at once,
  had stirred in him something more than masculinity, and whatever had been
  stirred had recognized its own kingdom in Considine's voice when he had
  spoken of the divine delight which foretells and communicates the conquest of
  death. Philip was not much concerned with the conquest of death as such in
  the future, but he was vitally concerned with its immediate presence. He
  became dimly aware that though Rosamond would die the thing he had seen in
  Rosamond not merely could not die but had nothing whatever to do with death.
  Even if it passed&mdash;though of course it couldn't pass&mdash;but even if
  it did pass, still its passing had got nothing whatever to do with it. Its
  presence, he toiled laboriously at an undefined thought, had got nothing to
  do with its absence. Was it so very surprising then that men could determine
  not to die? He rather wondered whether he could manage to discuss this with
  Rosamond, only she was always impatient of his slow mind, and he wouldn't be
  able to find words for it. Also, probably, she wouldn't care about it; she'd
  feel it was disagreeable and a trifle obscene, and perhaps she was right. She
  and Considine wouldn't get on very well; only then&mdash;far off a single
  unmistakable note sounded and ceased&mdash;only then which of them...
  Shocked, as such lovers are, by the implied disloyalty, when first some alien
  fate separates itself from the hitherto universal fate which is the beloved,
  he put it hastily out of his mind. He had not understood, in his confusion,
  the accusation which his father had flung at Considine, and Sir Bernard
  considerately had not pressed it on him. The High Executive was something to
  do with negroes, and Considine was a man in London with whom he had dined.
  The conquest of death itself would have been an easier matter to Philip than
  the union of those two thoughts in a single idea. But the two experiences ran
  closely parallel in his troubled heart.</p>

  <p>At Lambeth he followed the others, Caithness gently guiding the Zulu by a
  hand on his arm. Philip, without exactly professing and calling himself a
  Christian, had a general idea that he disagreed with the people who disagreed
  with Christianity. His father's own disagreement slightly accentuated this,
  because in the usual reflux of the generations he tended to assume that his
  father's mind was insufficient. And anyhow any mere mental and argumentative
  disagreement was past bothering him at the moment. He couldn't possibly have
  sat in the car while the others went wherever they were going; and if the
  king had really been put to sleep, he thought the king ought to be wakened.
  But even the relation of Considine with the king did not cause him to suspect
  whose determination had challenged England in the strange and piercing notes
  of the Allied Suzerainties of Africa. So he went on.</p>

  <p>One of the Archbishop's chaplains met them and brought them to the private
  chapel. Caithness led Inkamasi to the rails of the sanctuary and there caused
  him to kneel, kneeling himself by his side. Philip slipped behind a chair.
  The Archbishop, vested in the ordinary chasuble, and the chaplain, acting as
  server, made their entrance. Murmured sentences were exchanged and the
  Archbishop went up to the altar.</p>

  <p>Philip had long ago lost touch with the ritual of the Mysteries, and the
  opening prayers brought back to him only a confused memory of uninteresting
  moments in boyhood and youth. The Archbishop, with a swift intense movement,
  wheeled towards the kneeling four and began the Commandments. Caithness
  turned his gaze on to Inkamasi, and seemed to concentrate it, as the
  celebrant uttered, almost as if in an incantation and with his look also
  fixed on the Zulu, "Thou shalt have none other gods but me." The chaplain
  answered softly, and the beating series of directions went on. The Archbishop
  turned again to the altar, murmured a longer prayer, another, and came to the
  Epistle.</p>

  <p>Of the Epistle and Gospel Philip, unused, to the phrasing and tone,
  understood very little. A phrase here and there struck him. "Greater is he
  that is in you than he that is in the world." "This sickness is not unto
  death." "I am the resurrection and the life." "Lazarus, come forth." He was
  aware of a rising tide of passion, swelled suddenly as the Archbishop broke
  into the Creed by the strong voice of Caithness. The tones of the three
  priests mingled and achieved the Profession, and ceased; and for some minutes
  Philip again heard only the single voice of the celebrant, with an occasional
  murmur from the chaplain. Nevertheless, as he knelt listening, the Rite
  ordered his mind. He forgot to try and reconcile; he was moved by
  reconciliation. There rose in him a feeling kindred to that with which
  sometimes he had waited for Rosamond&mdash;entire expectation yet mingled
  with complete repose and certainty. The face of Caithness, when he saw it,
  had lost its earlier concentration and was filled instead with a profound
  conviction, a content so deep that he involuntarily looked at the Zulu to see
  what, if anything, had caused it. But no difference showed in Inkamasi, who
  still, motionless, glassy-eyed, and lethargic, knelt at the rail, his hands
  hanging over it. The Archbishop's face visible at moments as he turned and
  returned, knelt and rose, spread out or closed his hands, was more sombre
  than that of the other priests, but it was no more strongly moved. Philip had
  once seen his father the moment before a successful but very dangerous
  operation, and the look of the celebrant reminded him of Sir Bernard then: it
  was the look of a man conscious of the gravity of the work before him but
  conscious also of an entire capacity to deal with it. But was this also then
  a work of cutting and setting right and binding? was it as possible, if less
  usual, to restore a man's will as to restore his stomach? The archbishop
  seemed to be no more agitated than any clergyman delivering a sermon; only as
  he stood now in the Prayer of Consecration, he suddenly, after the words "in
  the same night that He was betrayed," paused and repeated them on a more
  exalted note. "In the same night that He was betrayed..." Philip felt himself
  looking into a different world; a world he had glimpsed once before over the
  outstretched arm that had been more significant to him than any other
  experience in his life. To take his part in it, if indeed it really existed,
  was beyond him; yet he felt that if something was in fact being done there to
  aid a man he ought to be taking his part in it. He understood the work no
  more than he understood why Rosamond should be and mean so much. But if the
  king were really hypnotized... he began to make a wordless effort towards
  prayer, half absurd though he felt his effort to be. On the instant it took
  him; a sudden warmth leapt within him; his being rested stable upon a rocky
  basis, and the movements before him became natural and right. He understood
  them no more than before, but he was assured that they answered to the
  imperious control that held him. That control was gone again in a moment; he
  found himself staring only at the ordinary men whom he knew; his mind was
  undirected, his heart was unwarmed, as before. But as at Hampstead there had
  opened spaces and distance beyond all dreams, so now there had shown glimpse
  of a certainty beyond all pledges and promises, a fixity which any after
  hesitation was powerless to deny. He became conscious of an immense stillness
  around him; the Archbishop was on his knees before the altar, and the others
  motionless in their places. The Archbishop's voice sounded: "Almighty and
  Everlasting God, who alone art the life of all thy creatures and hast made
  them able to know how in thy eternity they glorify thee, unite them in thy
  prevailing will, and increase in them that freedom which only is able to
  bring them to the bondage of the perfect service, through Jesus Christ our
  Lord." The chaplain and Caithness answered "Amen."</p>

  <p>"Almighty God," the Archbishop said again, "make us to know thee through
  thy Love who hath redeemed us, and bestoweth through the operations of the
  Church militant upon earth grace and aid upon all that are in adversity.
  Establish in us, and especially at this time upon our brother here present, a
  perfect knowledge of thee, overcome all errors and tyrannies, and as thou
  only art holy, so be thou only the Lord, through Jesus Christ our
  Saviour."</p>

  <p>Before the "Amen" had ceased, he rose, genuflected, turned, and came down
  the steps of the altar to Inkamasi. He set his hands on the Zulu's head,
  paused, and went on: "By the power of Immanuel who only is perfect Man, by
  his power committed unto us, we recall all powers in thee to their natural
  obedience, making whole all things that are sick, and destroying all things
  that are contrary to his will. Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the
  dead, and Christ shall give thee life. In the name of the Father and of the
  Son and of the Holy Ghost."</p>

  <p>As his voice sounded through the chapel Philip saw the hands of the king
  come together, saw them fold themselves, saw his head move, heard him sigh.
  Caithness moved an arm behind him, but it was not needed. Inkamasi glanced
  round swiftly, and as he did so the Archbishop as swiftly went back to the
  altar, genuflected, and returned, bearing the Sacred Gifts. He communicated
  them to Caithness first, and then, as if in the ritual of his office, to the
  king; only again his voice lingered on and intensified the formula of two
  thousand years, the formula by which Christendom has defined, commanded and
  assisted the resurrection of man in God. As naturally as in any other service
  of his life, the king received the Mystery; afterwards he moved as if to
  rise, but Caithness with a smile touched him on the shoulder and made a quiet
  signal of restraint, and he desisted. They remained in their places till the
  Rite was done. The Archbishop and the chaplain passed out, and in due time
  the others also rose and made their way to the door.</p>

  <p>The chaplain met them there; he and Caithness exchanged a few murmured
  sentences, and then the three went back to the car.</p>

  <p>There Caithness said: "I'll drive this time; you two get in together."
  Inkamasi hesitated a moment but he obeyed, and the priest added hastily to
  Philip. "He knows you; better tell him everything he wants to
  hear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but look here," Philip began, a little startled. "I'm not clear
  what&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, but never mind," Caithness said, rather more like the vicar for the
  moment than the godfather or even the priest, "you're able to explain what's
  happened, aren't you? He's met you and he hasn't met me&mdash;that's why
  you'll do it better. In you get."</p>

  <p>In accordingly Philip got. But he didn't quite see how to open the
  conversation. Did one just say engagingly, "You must be surprised to find
  yourself here?" or apologetically, "I hope you don't mind our having carried
  you away?" Or could one risk saying, with an air of relief, "That was a near
  thing?" And then supposing he said, "What?" or "How?" What had it been near
  to? and how? Philip began to wish that his father was in the car. But before
  he had found the exact words, the African turned to him and said, "Will you
  tell me, Mr. Travers, what has been happening?"</p>

  <p>Philip tried to, and thought he failed badly. But apparently enough became
  clear to satisfy Inkamasi, who listened intently, and then said, "You've done
  me a greater service than I quite know, I think. It's very good of you."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said Philip. "My father didn't like leaving you there.
  Perhaps we ought to apologize... but..."</p>

  <p>"No," Inkamasi said, "no, I don't think you ought to apologize. If you've
  made my life clear to me, that doesn't seem a thing to apologize for." He
  stared in front of him. "But that we shall see," he added, and relapsed into
  silence.</p>

  <p>Philip, looking at him, thought that he wasn't looking very friendly, and
  that he was looking rather African, in fact rather&mdash;savage. Savage was a
  word which might here, in fact, have a stronger meaning than it generally
  had. Inkamasi's head was thrust forward, his jaw was set; his hand moved,
  slowly and relentlessly, along his leg to his knee, as if with purpose, and
  not a pleasant purpose. "I hope he isn't annoyed with us," Philip thought.
  "My father must have meant it for the best." But before they reached
  Kensington the king relaxed; only there was still about him something high
  and strange, something apart and reserved, something almost (but quite
  impersonally) exalted&mdash;in short, something like a chieftain who knows
  that he is a chieftain and is instinctively living up to his knowledge. When
  they reached Colindale Square, Philip, being on the near side, got out first,
  and half held the car door for the stranger. Inkamasi got out and smiled his
  thanks. But he didn't utter them, and Philip was suddenly aware that he had
  expected him to. As it was, Inkamasi seemed to have relegated him to the
  position of an upper servant, yet without being discourteous. Sir Bernard met
  them in the hall.</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chap7"
     id="chap7">VII.</a> &mdash; THE OPENING OF SCHISM</h2>

  <p class="first">That evening after dinner they were all in the library. Sir
  Bernard was sitting on the right of the fireplace, with Caithness next to
  him; opposite him was Isabel, with Rosamond between her and Philip. Roger lay
  in a chair next to the priest, and pushed a little back from the circle. In
  the centre, between Roger and Philip, opposite the fire, was the African.
  Roger looked at him, looked at the rest, and muttered to Caithness: "'On him
  each courtier's eye was bent, to him each lady's look was lent, and
  Hampstead's refugee was Colindale Square's king'." He looked at Rosamond:
  "She doesn't look happy, does she?" he said. "Why doesn't she go and plan
  food for her first dinner-party or practise giving the housemaid notice?" He
  became aware that Sir Bernard was speaking and stopped.</p>

  <p>"... evidence," Sir Bernard was saying. "It's a silly word in the
  circumstances, but it's the only one we've got. Is there enough evidence to
  persuade the authorities&mdash;or us either for that matter&mdash;that Nigel
  Considine has anything to do with the High Executive? I've drawn up a
  statement of what happened last night, and I think I'll read it to you; and
  if I've forgotten anything or the king can tell us any more&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They sat silent, and he began. Actually, except for the two women, they
  all knew the substance of it before, but they were very willing to hear it
  again compacted after this little lapse of time.</p>

  <p>Everything was there&mdash;the photograph, the music, the other visitors,
  the guns, the king's sleep&mdash;and against that background ran the
  summaries of Considine's monologues, conversation, and claim. As they
  listened that river of broad pretension flowed faster and deeper at their
  feet; they stood on its brink and wondered. Was the source indeed two hundred
  years off in the past? was it flowing towards an ocean of infinite experience
  till now undiscovered, unimagined&mdash;undiscovered because unimagined?
  Across that river their disturbed fancies saw the African forests, and shapes
  &mdash;both white and black&mdash;emerging and disappearing, and from among
  those high palms and falling creepers, that curtain of green profusion, came
  the sound of strings and the roar of guns. The dark face of Inkamasi,
  whatever he himself might be, grew terrible to them, not merely because of
  his negro kindred but because of the terrifying exaltation which so darkly
  hinted at itself in the words they heard, and when suddenly the delicate
  voice that was reading ceased, it was of Inkamasi's figure that they were all
  chiefly aware, whether they looked towards it as Caithness did or away from
  it into the fire at which Rosamond Murchison stared.</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard put down his paper, and looked for a cigarette. For once,
  among all his friends, no-one forestalled him. He found one, lit it, and sat
  back, reluctant to spoil his story with any bathos of comment. In a minute
  Inkamasi moved.</p>

  <p>"I've thanked you already, Sir Bernard," he said, and suddenly Isabel felt
  Rosamond's arm quiver, as it lay in her own, "and I'll thank you once more.
  You and Mr. Caithness have done a great thing for me. You've set me free from
  a power that has been about me since I was a boy."</p>

  <p>Roger turned his head. "You mean Considine!" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I mean Considine," the African answered. "Something I can tell you
  perhaps that you don't know. It's true&mdash;what he says. He is a hundred
  &mdash;two hundred years old&mdash;I do not know how old. He was known to my
  grandfather as the Deathless, and to his grandfather again, and others before
  that. He has been a power among the chieftains and the witch-doctors, but not
  always to their liking. For many of them had become conjurers, debased
  things, frogs sitting in the swamp, losing knowledge as you of the West have
  lost knowledge, and these he defeated and sometimes killed, till from the
  Niger to the Zambesi the rest feared and obeyed him. Sometimes he went away
  for long periods&mdash;then, I suppose, he was in Europe or
  elsewhere&mdash;but he always returned, and his return went before him into
  the villages and then those who had sold their magic for gifts were very
  greatly afraid."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard with the slightest disdain said as the other paused: "Magic!
  Did Mr. Considine draw circles with a thigh-bone and make love-philtres from
  banana-trees?"</p>

  <p>Inkamasi smiled back at him. "Is there any certain reason why a
  love-philtre couldn't be made from a banana? But he wasn't concerned with
  that kind of magic. He desired a greater mastery, and that I think he found.
  Most men waste their energies, even at their best they waste them, on
  fantastic dreams and worthless actions. Above all they waste this power which
  you call love but we have called lordship. It is said among some of us that
  the high Spring is the time of lordship. This power and lordship Considine
  and his schools have sought to use. They have sought to restore its strength
  to the royal imagination from which in the beginning it came. Mysteriously,
  yet by methods which they say are open to all, they have learnt to arouse and
  restrain and direct the exaltation of love to such purposes as they choose.
  They have learnt by the contemplation of beauty in man or woman to fill
  themselves with a wonderful and delighted excitement, and to turn that
  excitement to deliberate ends. But the first of these ends is life, that
  other ends may be reached in turn. Whether any before Considine has done this
  thing, I do not know; but I believe that he has done it. He has so filled the
  uttermost reaches of his being with the imagination and consciousness of life
  that his body, renewed so from time to time, when it is unusually weary, let
  us say, is impervious to time and decay and sickness. Accident might destroy
  him. But this mastery and transformation of love and sex is but a beginning.
  Have you not asked yourselves what is the death which spreads through
  creation, so that all things live by the death of others? Men and animals, we
  live by destruction. But these diverse schools have asked themselves whether
  indeed this is the whole secret, or whether it is so far but a substitution
  &mdash;a lesser thing taking the place of a greater. If man can descend into
  death, may he not find that what awaits him is an incredible ecstasy of
  descent and return? Considine is seeking to find that way. To be the food on
  which one feeds, to be free from any accident of death, to know the ecstasy
  of being at once priest and victim&mdash;all these ends are in his
  search."</p>

  <p>He paused considering, and Caithness said: "Do you speak of this from your
  own knowledge?"</p>

  <p>The king answered: "Not of my own experience, for my father turned from
  the ways of his father, and brought me up in the Faith and sent me to England
  to learn the ways of the mind. Nor would he let me be initiated into the ways
  of the assemblies, though my grandfather and the other wise men of his
  generation belonged to them. But when I was only a child the Deathless One
  came and persuaded my father&mdash;I cannot guess with what words&mdash;and I
  was given into his hands. He bound my will and my thought lest a day should
  come when he should need me. I think he bound all the sons of the kings of
  Africa. So he would sometimes talk when I was there, because he held me so
  that I could not speak without leave."</p>

  <p>"But you came to England," Sir Bernard said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the king said, "only he knew where I was and what I was doing, and
  when the time had come he called me and I came."</p>

  <p>"What do you think he really wants?" Roger said abruptly. "Why is he
  making war?"</p>

  <p>"I think he wants what he says," the king answered, "the freedom of
  Africa. I don't think he minds about destroying or even defeating Europe, he
  only needs a continent where the schools may flourish, and the gospel of
  ecstasy be born."</p>

  <p>"The defeat of Europe on that scale", Sir Bernard said, "sounds rather
  like a moment of unusually exalted and not specially reliable
  imagination."</p>

  <p>Inkamasi leant forward with a quick fierce movement.</p>

  <p>"Take care," he said, almost angrily, and his eyes burned at them, "take
  care you don't underrate him or despise him. Ever since he determined to do
  this he has made his preparations&mdash;he has chosen and trained his men and
  armed them. He has wealth&mdash;are aeroplanes and submarines, yes and guns,
  so difficult to buy and have shipped in parts as provisions or cotton or iron
  rails or Bibles or machinery to appointed harbours? Then there was the
  War&mdash;who had time to bother about the interior of Africa during the
  War?"</p>

  <p>"One way and another", Sir Bernard protested, "there are a large number of
  Europeans in the interior of Africa, watching it and doing things to it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Inkamasi answered, "and how many of your Europeans themselves are
  in it? How much of the white Administration belongs to the Mysteries? Has no
  conqueror ever been civilized by the nation he ruled? A white general may
  lead the attack on London yet; the Devotees themselves are often white."</p>

  <p>"The what?" Sir Bernard asked.</p>

  <p>"The Devotees," the Zulu answered. "It's a high circle of those who having
  achieved much choose to render their lives wholly into the will of the
  Deathless One that he may use them as he pleases. Didn't you see that of the
  aeronauts in last night's raid the few who lived after they came down shot
  themselves before they could be taken? They were of the Devotees. Most of
  them", he added, "are women."</p>

  <p>An abrupt movement swept the circle. "Women!" Caithness exclaimed. "Does
  he depend on the devotion of women?"</p>

  <p>"And look here," Philip said rather desperately, "do you mean to say that
  the white officers could be mixed up in the African armies?"</p>

  <p>"As to the women," Sir Bernard said, "the early Church, if I remember
  rightly, depended largely on women."</p>

  <p>"And as to the white officers," Roger said abruptly, "Mr. Caithness will
  applaud a similar precedent of Jew and Gentile."</p>

  <p>Caithness took no notice, except by a nod. He said: "This sleep&mdash;is
  it hypnotic?"</p>

  <p>Inkamasi made a movement with his hands. "Call it so if you like," he
  answered, "but I think rather that hypnotism is a reflection of it. He is
  able to establish a control on all the consciousness, except the secret
  centre of a man's being and the mere exterior apprehensions of the world. He
  can suspend thought and will&mdash;until he or a greater than he restores
  it."</p>

  <p>"Well," Sir Bernard said, "the immediate point is&mdash;have I enough
  reasonable (if you can call it reasonable) stuff to send to the Home
  Secretary or the Public Prosecutor or the Elder Brethren of the Trinity?
  &mdash;who sound the kind of people that ought to be looking after the
  Deathless One. What do you say, Isabel?"</p>

  <p>Isabel was looking at Roger and did not for a moment answer. Then she
  said, "I think so&mdash;yes. Whether they'll believe it..."</p>

  <p>"I once put the Prime Minister's stomach right," Sir Bernard said
  thoughtfully. "Perhaps I'd better go to him. What d'you think?" he added to
  Inkamasi.</p>

  <p>"If you can seize Considine," the king said,&mdash;"I say, if you can
  &mdash;it will not be easy. For the greatest energy is in him, he and he
  alone is the centre of all the schools; it is he who holds power, either by
  the initiation or by the sleep, over the royalties of Africa; he is the union
  of their armies; without him the energies of the adepts will be divided, the
  generals will quarrel, the armies will fight. I tell you this, because you
  have saved me twice, and because I do not think mankind can be saved without
  intellect and without God."</p>

  <p>"It must be almost the first time in the history of the world that those
  powers have been united," said Sir Bernard. "But what of you?"</p>

  <p>The king looked at the floor. "I indeed can do nothing," he said, "for I
  cannot get to my people: I do not know where they are fighting. And I do not
  want to help Considine, though I long for Africa to be free. I am neither of
  one side nor of the other, neither of Europe nor Africa. I am an outcast and
  an exile."</p>

  <p>"You are the citizen of another country," the priest said, "that is, a
  heavenly."</p>

  <p>"Also, I am the king," Inkamasi exclaimed, "and there shall be no peace
  between this man and me. He laid his power upon me when I was a child, he has
  made me his puppet since, and for that I will kill him, though my spirit goes
  down with his into hell."</p>

  <p>"It was not for this that Christ redeemed you," Caithness cried to
  him.</p>

  <p>"I am the king," Inkamasi said, "and I will put my foot upon his mouth; I,
  Inkamasi, the king."</p>

  <p>Rosamond gave a little choked cry. Philip leant forward quickly and put
  his hand on hers, but she pulled it away. "It's all right," she said. "I just
  felt... it's all right, Philip."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard got up, an eye on his prospective daughter-in-law. "Well, if
  you are all agreed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Roger pushed his chair back a trifle, and said, more sharply than before,
  "It won't stop you, but&mdash;no, we're not."</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence. Roger was looking at his wife; the others looked
  at him. Philip buried his head in his hands. Sir Bernard began to speak when
  Caithness broke in: "What d'you mean, Roger? Surely there can't be two
  opinions about letting the authorities know about this charlatan?"</p>

  <p>"It may be your duty," Roger said, "I'm pretty certain it isn't mine. You
  haven't met him."</p>

  <p>"Sir Bernard has and Sir Bernard agrees," Caithness answered.</p>

  <p>"Sir Bernard and I don't believe in the same things," Roger said. "I can't
  stop him but I won't have anything to do with it."</p>

  <p>Philip got up-for him violently. "Roger," he cried out, "what are you
  talking about? Are you on this man's side?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am," Roger said. "At least I can't go against him. He knows
  there's something in it, and which of you all does that?"</p>

  <p>"I know it very well," Inkamasi said, sitting rigid. "And I will kill him
  because of it."</p>

  <p>"You've a right to do as you please," Roger answered, "but I haven't. I've
  no right except to follow what I know when I find it." He looked over at his
  wife. "Aren't I right?" he exclaimed to her.</p>

  <p>Isabel also stood up, and met his eyes full. "Yes, darling," she said
  simply.</p>

  <p>"Roger," Sir Bernard said dulcetly, "is it Mr. Considine's feeling about
  poetry that affects you so much? Because the unfortunate white race has not
  been entirely silent. Was Dante a Bantu or Shakespeare a Hottentot? A few of
  us read it still."</p>

  <p>"O read it!" Roger said contemptuously. "God knows I don't want to live
  for ever, but I tell you this fellow knows. So do I&mdash;a little bit, and I
  believe it's important. More important than anything else on earth. And I
  won't help you to shut it up in a refrigerator when I ought to be helping to
  keep it alive."</p>

  <p>"Can't you leave that to God?" Caithness flung out.</p>

  <p>"No", said Roger, "I damn well can't, when he's left it to me. I know your
  argument&mdash;it's all been done, death has been conquered, and so as
  nothing ever dies somewhere else, we needn't worry about it's dying here.
  Well, thank you very much, but I do. What are you worrying about? I know I
  can't stop you, but I won't have a hand in it."</p>

  <p>"I see", Sir Bernard said, "that the white administration in Africa may
  easily have been absorbed. I'm sorry, Roger."</p>

  <p>"Don't be," Roger said. "It's not a thing to be sorry about." He swept
  suddenly round. "What about it, Philip?" he cried. "Are you with them?"</p>

  <p>Philip, trying to keep his footing, said, "Don't be a fool, Roger, we
  can't not fight the Africans."</p>

  <p>"We can 'not fight' them perfectly well," Roger said, and it seemed to
  Isabel that his tall insolent figure dominated all the room except for the
  carven and royal darkness of the seated Zulu, "and you know it. Love and
  poetry are powers, and these people&mdash;will you deny it too?"</p>

  <p>"Really, Roger," Sir Bernard put in, "must you dichotomize in this
  appalling way? It's so barbarian; it went out with the Victorians. If you
  feel you're betraying the Ode to the Nightingale or something by agreeing to
  my call on the Prime Minister, must you insist that your emotions are
  universal? Keep them private, my dear boy, or they'll be merely provincial;
  and the provincial is the ruin of the public and the private at once."</p>

  <p>He knew he was talking at random, but the whole room was filled with
  uncertainty and defiance and distress. A man had come out into the open from
  behind the fronds and leaves and it was Roger. A trumpet had answered the
  horns and drums that were crying to the world from the jungle of man's being;
  and the trumpet was Roger's voice. Was Africa then within? was all the war,
  were the armies and munitions and the transports but the shadow of the
  repression by which man held down his more natural energies? but images of
  the strong refusal which Europe had laid on capacities it had so long ruled
  that it had nearly forgotten their independent life? But things forgotten
  could rise; and old things did not always die.</p>

  <p>Poland&mdash;Ireland&mdash;Judah&mdash;man. Roger knew something; the
  voice that had discussed and lectured and gibed and repeated verse now cried
  its sworn loyalty: a schism was opening in civilization. Sir Bernard looked
  at Isabel, but she said nothing. She leaned on the mantelpiece and looked
  into the fire, and her face was very still. Roger relaxed slightly; he liked
  Sir Bernard, and they had often gently mocked each other. He said, "Yes, I
  know I can't do anything. I think I'll say good-night and get back to
  Hampstead. Coming, Isabel?"</p>

  <p>She turned her head towards him. "It'll be very awkward, dearest," she
  said. "The milkman's been told not to call, and what shall we do for
  breakfast?" She spoke quite seriously, but her lips smiled; only a deeper
  seriousness and sadness grew in her eyes, and his own were sad as they
  encountered hers. She stood upright, as if to move, and yet lingered a little
  on that silent interchange.</p>

  <p>"I know, I know," Roger said, answering her smile, "it'll be most
  inconvenient, but can I stop here?" He looked round at them all and flung out
  his hands. "O you're charming, you're lovely, all of you, but how much do you
  care what the great ones are doing? And in these centuries you've nearly
  killed it, with your appreciations and your fastidious judgements, and your
  lives of this man and your studies in that. What do you know about 'huge and
  mighty forms that do not live/Like living men'? Power, power, it's dying in
  you, and you don't hunger to feel it live. What's Milton, what's Shakespeare,
  to you?"</p>

  <p>"If this is just a literary discussion&mdash;" Caithness began.</p>

  <p>"What d'you mean just a literary discussion?" Roger said, his temper
  leaping. "D'you call Islam a mere theological distinction? Can't you
  understand any other gospel than your own damned dogmas?"</p>

  <p>"Roger, Roger," Sir Bernard murmured.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," Roger said, "and yours too, Sir Bernard. But I can't
  stay here to-night. I know it seems silly, but I can't." He looked back at
  his wife. "But I shall be all right, darling," he said, "if you'd rather
  stop. I can even go and buy a bottle of milk! "</p>

  <p>Isabel smiled at him. "I think I'll come to-night," she said. "To-night
  anyhow." She looked down at her sister. "Rosamond, you might as well stop
  here, mightn't you?"</p>

  <p>Rosamond looked up with a jerk. "Stop," she exclaimed. "What, are you
  going back? O I can't, I can't. I'll come."</p>

  <p>They all stared at her. "I wasn't just listening," she went on hastily. "I
  was thinking of something else. Are you going at once, Isabel? I'll get my
  things." She was on her feet, when Philip's hand took hold of her arm. She
  jerked it away. "Let me alone," she cried out. "Aren't you going with
  them?"</p>

  <p>Philip, in spite of his opposition to Roger, hadn't been at all certain;
  or rather, he was extremely troubled about being certain. He couldn't begin
  to imagine himself on the side of Considine and the Africans, but he had a
  curiously empty feeling somewhere when he thought of denying them. It was all
  so muddled, and he had hitherto thought that moral divisions, though painful,
  were clear: such as not cheating, and not telling lies except for urgent
  reasons, and being on your country's side, and being polite to your
  inferiors, and in short playing the game. But this game was quite unlike any
  other he'd ever played; what with the piercing music that called him still,
  and the song Considine's talk of love sent through his blood, and the urgent
  appeal to him to do what he so much wanted to do, to exult and live. But of
  course when Rosamond put it like that&mdash;no, he wasn't. He was going to be
  on the side of his country and his duty and his fiance. He said so.</p>

  <p>She said: "I thought not," almost snapping at him. "Then leave me alone. I
  thought you wouldn't."</p>

  <p>The king at this moment stood up. He had been silent, concerned with his
  own thought of vengeance, while the breach between Roger and the rest had
  widened, and now he thrust himself up in the midst of them, an ally and yet a
  hostility, a dark whirlwind of confusion in their thoughts and in their
  midst. He came to his feet, and Rosamond, as if by the force of his rising,
  seemed flung against her sister. She clung to Isabel, and Isabel said,
  speaking of ordinary things in her own extraordinarily lovely voice: "Very
  well, darling, we'll all go. Perhaps Sir Bernard will give us a loaf of
  bread."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard, almost disliking Rosamond&mdash;he hadn't wanted her there at
  all, but she'd insisted on coming, and without being rude to Philip he could
  hardly refuse&mdash;said: "Also the jug of wine, if it's any good. The Sahara
  will no doubt presently serve for Paradise. Ian, will you come with me as far
  as Downing Street?"</p>

  <p>The breach widened indeed, but he was more aware of it than Roger, and as
  he became aware of it he refused and bridged it in his mind. He had been very
  nearly irritated, and irritation inflamed all the exquisite contemplative
  mind: he turned the cool spray of medicinal irony on himself till he was able
  to smile at Roger and say, "Well, if you will go&mdash;But let me be in at
  the death, won't you? While gospels exist, let's enjoy them as best we can.
  Good-night."</p>

  <p>A little later he and Caithness, having telephoned for an appointment,
  came to Downing Street, where, parting from the priest, he was after some
  slight delay carried in to see Raymond Suydler himself; which attention and
  privilege he owed to the Prime Minister's gratitude for a restored
  stomach.</p>

  <p>It was a long time since Sir Bernard had seen him; his attention to his
  stomach had been paid during the Prime Minister's first administration, and
  this was his second. He was a man who had made not merely an opportunity but
  a political triumph out of the very loss of public belief in politics which
  afflicted the country. He had carried realism to its extreme, declaring
  publicly that the best any statesman could do was to guess at the solution of
  his various problems, and that his guesses had a habit of being right. In
  private he dropped only the last half of this statement, which left him fifty
  per cent of sincerity, and thus gave him an almost absurd advantage over most
  of his colleagues and opponents. It had taken some time certainly for his own
  party to reconcile themselves to the enormous placards "Guess with Suydler"
  which at the General Election out-flamed the more argumentative shows of the
  other side. But the country, half mocking, half understanding, had laughed
  and followed, in that mingling of utter despair and wild faith which conceals
  itself behind the sedate appearance of the English. Chance, no doubt, had
  helped him by giving him an occasional opportunity of lowering taxation at
  home and increasing prestige abroad, but his denial of reason had done more.
  It was not cynicism; it was, and it was felt to be, truth, as Suydler saw it,
  and as most of the country did. In any state of things, the facts&mdash;all
  the facts&mdash;were unknown; circumstances were continually changing;
  instability and uncertainty were the only assured things. What was the use of
  rational discussion or fixed principles or far-sighted demonstrations?"Guess
  &mdash;guess with Suydler." He was reported to have said that the English had
  only had one inspired fool as Prime Minister&mdash;Pitt; and two intelligent
  men&mdash;Melbourne and Disraeli, who were hampered by believing, one in a
  class, the other in a race. "I would rather guess with Pitt, if you'll guess
  with me."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard remembered all this as he shook hands, and observed with a
  slight shock Suydler's large, ungainly form. The one cartoon which had really
  succeeded against him had been called "The Guessing Gorilla," and Sir Bernard
  recollected with pleasure that it was not his own obsession with Africa which
  had remarked the likeness. The ugly face, the long hanging arms, the curled
  fingers, the lumbering step, had a strange likeness to a great ape plunging
  about the room. He shook hands, and his visitor was quite glad not to feel
  those huge arms clutching him. There was, he thought, altogether too much
  Africa about, and he almost wondered for a moment whether indeed Suydler were
  preferable to Considine. But he reminded himself that it wasn't personalities
  but abstract states of existence with which he was concerned, and he took the
  chair the Prime Minister offered. The huge bulk swelled before him, loomed
  over him, was talking... talking... Sir Bernard felt a great weariness come
  over him. The excitement, the incredibilities, of the last twenty-four hours
  had worn him out. And what was the good of trying to defend the intellect in
  this place of the death of the intellect? Witch-doctors were invading Europe,
  and he had gone running to an ape for help ...</p>

  <p>"&mdash;absurd talk about possible reasons," the Prime Minister was
  saying. "The whole thing's an example of the failure of organized thought.
  No-one can find out the root of the trouble."</p>

  <p>"I wonder you ask them," Sir Bernard said.</p>

  <p>"I don't; they tell me," Suydler answered. "There was a man yesterday
  &mdash;an ex-Governor&mdash;was talking to me. I had a kind of bet with
  myself how many synonyms he'd use for guess&mdash;I think it was about
  twenty-four. We may assume&mdash;not improbable&mdash;very likely&mdash;may
  it not be&mdash;reasonable assumption&mdash;working hypothesis
  &mdash;possible surmise&mdash;news suggests&mdash;my opinion is&mdash;better
  theory&mdash;never a plain straightforward guess. Never used the word
  once."</p>

  <p>"It's not a favourite, except with children; they love it," Sir Bernard
  said. "Perhaps", he added, struck by a sudden thought, "that's why they're
  nearer the kingdom of heaven. They're more sincere. However, I came here to
  say that I'm not certain that I didn't dine yesterday with the High
  Executive. I mean&mdash;I guess I did."</p>

  <p>"That's fair, anyhow," Suydler answered. "Who did you guess he was? And
  &mdash;not that I mind, but as a concession to the Permanent Officials
  &mdash;why did you guess him?"</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard held out his papers. "It's all there," he said.</p>

  <p>Suydler put out an enormous hand&mdash;its shadow on the carpet stretched
  out, black and even more enormous-and took them. "How tidy you are," he said,
  grinning, "but you always were, weren't you? Your operations were always
  miracles of conciseness. If you've extracted the truth now, that'll be
  another miracle. Excuse me while I look at them."</p>

  <p>He didn't take long over it; then he chuckled, put them down, and leaned
  back. "And you've got this Zulu king of yours?" he asked. "Ready to testify
  and identify and all that?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Sir Bernard said.</p>

  <p>Suydler linked his fingers and stretched his arms out. "Well," he said,
  "if you like&mdash;though I've met Considine a few times&mdash;but if you
  like to make a pattern with him in, I'm not sure that I won't go with you.
  It'll look awfully well... 'Government discover High Executive.' Why, as of
  minor interest, didn't you come before?"</p>

  <p>"Because, until I'd got the king's opinion&mdash;guess, if you like, I
  couldn't," Sir Bernard explained. "And he went off into a real stupor the
  minute he reached Kensington&mdash;as if he had to get his own faculties into
  order."</p>

  <p>"Two hundred years&mdash;" Suydler said. "But what a price to pay! No
  women, no fun, no excitements. All, if I've got it right, squeezed back into
  yourself." He pressed a bell. "It isn't fair to let him go on suppressing
  himself and misleading others, is it? 'A long life and a dull
  one'&mdash;that's the end of all you theorists."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard stood up. "Well," he said, "if you think I'm right I'll
  go."</p>

  <p>A secretary came in, but Suydler kept him waiting. "Right!" he said, "no,
  I don't think you're right. I think your mind and his may have&mdash;what
  shall I say?&mdash;coincided by chance. But there's no such thing as 'right.'
  It's all a question of preferring a particular momentary pattern of
  phenomena. There's nothing more anywhere. How can there be? At this moment
  the past doesn't exist, the future doesn't exist, and we know nothing much
  about the present! "</p>

  <p>Avoiding any immediate discussion of the nature of existence, Sir Bernard
  got away. Walking down Downing Street he considered the Minister. "Considine
  and he both look into the abyss," he thought, "but Considine sees it beating
  with passion, and Suydler sees nothing. A chaos or a void? Black men, or men
  who are no longer white?" He saw the intellect and logical reason of man no
  longer as a sedate and necessary thing, but rather a narrow silver bridge
  passing over an immense depth, around the high guarded entrance of which
  thronged clouds of angry and malign presences. Often mistaking the causes and
  often misjudging the effects of all mortal sequences, this capacity of
  knowing cause and effect presented itself nevertheless to him as the last
  stability of man. Always approaching truth, it could never, he knew, be
  truth, for nothing can be truth till it has become one with its object, and
  such union it was not given to the intellect to achieve without losing its
  own nature. But in its divine and abstract reflection of the world, its
  passionless mirror of the holy law that governed the world, not in
  experiments or ecstasies or guesses, the supreme perfection of mortality
  moved. He saluted it as its child and servant, and dedicated himself again to
  it, for what remained to him of life, praying it to turn the light of its
  awful integrity upon him, and to preserve him from self-deception and
  greediness and infidelity and fear. "If A is the same as B," he said, "and B
  is the same as C, then A is the same as C. Other things may be true; for all
  I know, they may be different at the same time; but this at least is true.
  And Considine will have to hypnotise me myself before I deny it. Suydler is
  wrong&mdash;a guess may be true once and twice and a thousand times, for man
  has known abstraction, and no gorilla of a politician can take it away from
  him."</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chap8"
     id="chap8">VIII.</a> &mdash; PASSING THROUGH THE MIDST OF
     THEM</h2>

  <p class="first">There followed a few days of uneasy quiet. The news from
  Africa was vague, but more cheerfully vague. It was generally understood that
  organized naval measures were being taken to overcome the submarine forces of
  the enemy, which had succeeded in making the African coasts so dangerous and
  had proceeded so far afield that until such measures had been concerted and
  carried out the landing of fresh troops had become impossible. It was even
  rumoured that attacks had been made on certain European harbours, but if this
  were so the Government concerned saw to it that no hint was allowed to appear
  in the Press. Energetic operations had been planned; the more energetic
  movements of the enemy seemed to have ceased, though the clearance of white
  troops from North Africa appeared to be proceeding slowly but
  systematically.</p>

  <p>The financial panic had also been stayed to some extent by Government
  action. For the Prime Minister had announced that, as the simplest means of
  meeting the emergency, the Administration had decided to make loans to the
  federated control of any particular industry which was seriously affected.
  Conditions of application, examination, payment and repayment were to be
  settled by a Commission set up for the purpose; the immediate affair was to
  steady the markets, and dazed directors of innumerable companies found
  themselves offered millions in order to buy up shares in their own concerns.
  Unfederated companies rushed to federate; all newspapers, for example, found
  themselves part of one large business, controlled by a common Board which
  immediately borrowed or was offered a subsidy of some millions, with which it
  repurchased the shares which Nehemiah and Ezekiel Rosenberg were throwing
  before the world. It looked therefore as if these devoted believers would
  secure their money as well as their jewels; and the coming of Messias or the
  building of the Temple be prepared for by the English in a general increase
  of taxation. Sir Bernard, as he contemplated the world, foresaw a possibility
  that the whole business, military and financial, would gradually expire,
  having ruined a great number of small shareholders, increased the financial
  strength of the larger, cost a great deal in armaments, and probably
  massacred a host of Africans in circumstances of more or less equal
  fighting.</p>

  <p>"I had some expectation," he said to Caithness as they turned into the
  Square, after an early afternoon walk, "of becoming a travelling doctor in my
  old age&mdash;probably with a donkey cart; and going from village to village,
  curing indigestion and collecting sixpences. You know the kind of
  thing&mdash;'Travers's Pills make Stomachs Tractable'&mdash;'Dainty
  Digestions Decently Doctored.' You might have joined me, and we would have
  put stomachs and souls right together. 'Stomachs on the right; souls on the
  left: Advice free: only real cures paid for.' But I should have stipulated
  for no miracles."</p>

  <p>"Then you'd have wanted an unfair advantage," Caithness said. "I should
  have to send quite a number of my patients to you; lots of them think it's
  their conscience when actually it's their stomachs."</p>

  <p>"Still on your theory the soul's wrong anyhow," Sir Bernard pointed
  out.</p>

  <p>"Quite," Caithness answered. "But they have to understand that, not merely
  moan over their pains. However, the question isn't likely to arise. Things do
  seem to be a bit quieter now."</p>

  <p>The exertions of the Government and (presumably) of the police did not,
  however, succeed in tracing either Nigel Considine or his friends. Justified
  by several different kinds of warrants, an examination of the Hampstead house
  was carried out but with no results. Whatever staff or whatever servants had
  occupied it had disappeared as completely as its master. Inkamasi was
  examined and re-examined, but though his story was given in fuller detail,
  the details did not much help. It was clear that the High Executive had done
  no more than preserve him in case he should be wanted; the Zulus themselves,
  who were apparently taking an active part in the war, were (so far as news
  could be obtained) under the headship of another of their race, a cousin of
  Inkamasi's, less directly but still closely connected with the great
  chieftain and hero, Chaka. The king was allowed to remain in seclusion at Sir
  Bernard's house, where he spent his days reading, brooding, and talking
  sometimes to his host and to Caithness. Philip rather avoided him.</p>

  <p>Philip indeed had his own troubles. Apart from the complete wreck of his
  purposes which the war had brought about, apart from the agitations which his
  new experiences had introduced into his inner mind, he suddenly found himself
  on the most extraordinarily difficult terms with Rosamond. She refused to
  come near Colindale Square, she occasionally even refused to see him when he
  went to Hampstead, and when she did see him she was in a nervous and
  irritable mood which was quite unlike the normal Rosamond. Philip's own
  meditations on the relations between love and Rosamond were thwarted and
  upset by the discovery that Rosamond, to all intents and purposes, wasn't
  there for love to have relations with. She had always kept love in its proper
  place, and had never displayed any particular interest in its more corporeal
  manifestations, suggesting by her manner that such things were a trifle
  silly. If he tried to explain something of the marvel which she seemed to
  him, she had listened placidly and with good humour, but without much
  gratification and with no kind of exaltation at all. His own exaltation,
  however, had not been exactly forbidden to thrive&mdash;until now. But now
  she would not have it; she shrank from and repelled it. She wouldn't be
  touched; she wouldn't be approached. Isabel told him that her sister was
  sleeping badly. But what Isabel didn't tell him was the dubious and unhappy
  cause of that broken sleep.</p>

  <p>Roger, coming in early one evening, found his wife alone. He kissed her
  and flung himself down, and a silence gathered them up. Presently Isabel
  stirred: "Well, darling?" she said, "what do you think about it all?"</p>

  <p>Roger said nothing at first, then he uttered, "I've done what I can. I've
  thrown over a course on the probable sources of the minor comedies of the
  early nineteenth century, and where Mrs. Inchbald found her plots&mdash;Mrs.
  Inchbald&mdash;I ask you, Isabel! Where did Mrs. Hemans get hers? &mdash;and
  I've talked to them for all I'm worth on the Filial Godhead and mighty forms
  and encountering darkness and Macbeth. I can't do more&mdash;that way. I
  don't know enough: I'm a baby in it, after all."</p>

  <p>Isabel said quietly, "You want to know more?"</p>

  <p>Roger answered, "I want&mdash;yes, I&mdash;the thing that's me wants to
  know, not like wanting apple tart with or without custard, but like wanting
  breath. There's air outside the windows, and I shall smash them to get it or
  I shall die. There&mdash;you asked me."</p>

  <p>She came and stood by him, and he took her hand. "You don't feel it like
  that?" he said.</p>

  <p>"No, not like that," she answered. "But perhaps I can't. I've been
  thinking, Roger darling, and I've wondered whether perhaps women don't have
  to do it anyhow. I mean&mdash;perhaps it's nothing very new, this power your
  Mr. Considine talks of&mdash;perhaps women have always known it, and that's
  why they've never made great art. Perhaps they have turned everything into
  themselves. Perhaps they must."</p>

  <p>He looked up at her, brooding. "I know," he said, "you live and we talk
  about it."</p>

  <p>"No," Isabel said, sitting down by him in front of the fire. "No, dearest,
  not only that. We only live on what you give us&mdash;imaginatively, I mean;
  you have to find the greater powers. You have to be the hunters and fishers
  and fighters when all's said and done. So perhaps you ought to go and hunt
  now. But we turn it more easily into ourselves than you do&mdash;for bad and
  good alike. And we generally do it very badly&mdash;but then you've given us
  so little to do it with."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it," Roger said. "I don't believe in all this sex
  differentiation. And yet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And yet," she said, "it doesn't matter now. We needn't waste our time on
  talking abstractions. What do you want to do, sweetheart?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what I can do," he said. "I talk about smashing windows, but
  that's rather silly. I want to find this power and master it and find what
  there is to be discovered. I want to live where they live."</p>

  <p>"They?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Considine and Michael Angelo and Epstein and Beethoven," he answered. "I
  can feel a bit of what they do, I want to feel more. I've been trying to
  &mdash;don't laugh. All the way home I've been saying things to myself, and
  trying to see what's the thing to do. There's the feeling every element in
  them first&mdash;not just seeing the words, but finding out how one belongs
  to the words, how one's own self answers to all the different words, like
  criss-crossing currents. And then there's turning all that deeper into one's
  own self, into one's desire&mdash;and that's so hard because one hasn't a
  desire, except general comfort! "</p>

  <p>"O Roger dear, that's not true! You have," Isabel said.</p>

  <p>Roger hesitated-"Well, perhaps!" he allowed. "Anyhow I kept losing hold
  and just feeling all vague and dithery, so I tried to turn one thrill on to
  another line&mdash;d'you see?&mdash;and I do think it might work. But it'll
  need a lot of doing, and I'm not sure&mdash;" he relapsed into silence, and
  then said abruptly, "Has Philip been along?"</p>

  <p>His wife was about to answer when Rosamond came into the room, and the
  conversation returned hastily to ordinary things. She wasn't looking at all
  well, Roger thought, and she was getting positively hysterical these days.
  Curious that she should be Isabel's sister. But of course Isabel was unusual.
  He reflected gloomily, while the women chatted, that on Considine's showing
  he probably wouldn't have been married to Isabel&mdash;the energy of love
  would have gone the other way, would have been transmuted or something. Lots
  of people must have had to do it in their time; lots of people must have been
  disappointed in love and then&mdash;Yes, but most of them just blew along
  till the worst was over. To use the worst and the best for something that
  was, as far as ordinary knowledge went, different from both. The abolition of
  death&mdash;the conquest of death.</p>

  <p>The unnameable Muriel appeared in the room. She said, "Two gentlemen to
  see you, sir. They didn't give their names. But one of them sent this&mdash;"
  She passed over a slip of card bearing a word or two&mdash;"'How goes it?
  N.C.'"</p>

  <p>Roger jumped forward. "Here," he exclaimed, "where are they? Bring them
  &mdash;all right. I will." He was out of the room and into the tiny hall.
  There he saw Considine and Mottreux.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he said. "Come in. I thought you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Considine shook hands with a smile. It occurred to Roger that that swift
  smile was always very near showing with Considine. It danced on the surface
  of a deeper rapture, as if, to the world, that was all that could be made of
  something within the world.</p>

  <p>"We came", he said, "Mottreux and I, to fill an hour. Do we
  interrupt?"</p>

  <p>"No," Roger said. "Come in." He turned to Isabel. "May I present my wife?"
  he said. "You've never met Mr. Considine, have you, Isabel? And Colonel
  Mottreux." His eyes fell on Rosamond. "Miss Murchison&mdash;Mr. Considine,
  Colonel Mottreux."</p>

  <p>As he found them seats he cursed Rosamond. Who wanted her there? Well,
  she'd have to lump it. He stood back, and let his look rest on Considine.
  Then he said, "But I thought Sir Bernard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Certainly Sir Bernard," Considine answered. "But I don't think Sir
  Bernard or Mr. Suydler either are likely to interfere with me. It isn't from
  them that my dangers now will ever come&mdash;except by literal accident. So,
  since I was about, and since to-night I shall be busy, and shall leave
  London&mdash;I came to see you."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to Africa?" Roger said before he could stop himself.</p>

  <p>"I have come to ask you whether&mdash;if I go&mdash;you also will come,"
  Considine said.</p>

  <p>Roger was picking up a box of cigarettes from the table; he put it down
  again and his face went pale. "I?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I know that you believe," Considine said, "and I offer you the
  possibility."</p>

  <p>Roger, with a heroic effort, avoided looking at Isabel. He said in a calm
  silly voice, "It's awfully kind of you, of course, but I don't see how I can.
  Not this side of Christmas."</p>

  <p>Isabel said, "I think you might. It'll be death if you don't."</p>

  <p>He looked up at her, and she added, "It'll be death to you, darling, and
  then there'll be nothing left for me. If you go, there may. And I can do
  &mdash;what we were talking about."</p>

  <p>"But I can't decide all on the moment," Roger protested to Considine,
  though he still looked at Isabel.</p>

  <p>"You have decided," Considine said. "But of course you may not do it."</p>

  <p>"And have I decided," Roger said sardonically, "to live for a hundred
  years and try all sorts of experiments with my unhappy body?"</p>

  <p>"'I will encounter darkness as a bride,'" Considine murmured. "Yes."</p>

  <p>It was true, and Roger knew it. Chance might thwart him, as (so he
  understood) it might thwart Considine himself, but the decision was in his
  blood and bones. He would have to follow this man&mdash;as once, he had read,
  other men had thrown aside their work and their friends to follow another
  voice. When explosions happened you were just blown. Isabel would be all
  right as far as money went&mdash;and till he had entered into this mystery he
  could never now serve Isabel rightly. Those other men had followed a voice
  that went crying how it was not come to send peace but a sword &mdash;the
  peace of the sword perhaps, the reconciliation in a greater state of being
  which &mdash;</p>

  <p>He pulled a chair forward. "Tell me about it," he said. He was vaguely
  aware, as he did so, that Rosamond had slipped from the room, and was
  grateful. The four of them were left. Roger picked up the cigarettes again
  and offered them to Isabel who took one, and to Considine and Mottreux who
  refused. He himself hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I don't", he said, "see any reason why I shouldn't smoke, and yet when
  I'm really concerned I don't. Except by habit."</p>

  <p>"It absorbs energy," Considine said. "When it's a dominant habit it
  absorbs less energy than the refusal demands, so naturally it has its way.
  But when it's not quite inevitable you're conscious of the energy wasted
  &mdash;of a divided concentration&mdash;and you hesitate."</p>

  <p>"Is that why you don't smoke?" Roger asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't smoke just as I don't eat&mdash;since you ask me," Considine
  said, the smile breaking out again, "because it doesn't amuse me. Any more
  than golfing or dancing or reading the newspaper. Certain things drop away as
  one becomes maturer."</p>

  <p>"And eating's one of them?" Roger asked, putting down the cigarettes.</p>

  <p>"It's necessary to an extent still," Considine answered. "I suppose a
  certain minimum of food may be necessary, until&mdash;afterwards. Then
  perhaps not. But it's nothing like as necessary as one thinks. There are so
  many better things to feed on. Shall I quote your Messias again? 'I have meat
  to eat that ye know not of.'"</p>

  <p>Isabel said, more suddenly than was her habit, "It was to do the will of
  Him that sent him."</p>

  <p>"What else?" Considine answered. "What else could it be?"</p>

  <p>"But you don't claim to be doing that will?" Isabel said. "You're not in
  obedience, are you?"</p>

  <p>"I am in obedience to all laws I have not yet mastered," he answered. "I
  am in danger of death&mdash;until I have mastered it&mdash;and therefore in
  obedience to it, and a little to food and sleep."</p>

  <p>"But you said that danger&mdash;" Roger began.</p>

  <p>"I said that danger will not come from my enemies," Considine answered;
  "isn't there any other? There are laws that are very deep, and one of them
  may be that every gospel has a denial within it and every Church a treachery.
  You&mdash;whom I invite to join me&mdash;you yourself may be a danger. It
  isn't for me to fear you because of that chance."</p>

  <p>Roger leant forward. "That's it," he cried out, "there's nothing that may
  not betray."</p>

  <p>Isabel said softly, "Can't Mr. Considine transform treachery too?"</p>

  <p>"I can guard against it at least," Considine answered; "I can read men's
  minds, under conditions, but the conditions may fail, and then&mdash;could
  Christ do more?"</p>

  <p>Isabel answered still softly, "Mightn't the missionaries you killed have
  joined with something which was greater than you because it had known defeat?
  Have you known defeat?"</p>

  <p>"No," Considine said and stood up. "I've mastered myself from the
  beginning and all things that I've needed are mine. Why should man know
  defeat? You teach him to look and expect and wait for it; you teach him to
  obey and submit; you heal his hurts and soothe his diseases. But I will show
  him that in his hurts as in his happiness he is greatly and intensely lord;
  he lives by them. He shall delight in feeling, and his feeling shall be blood
  within his blood and body in his body; it shall burn through him till that
  old business of yes-and-no has fallen away from him, and then his diseases
  will have vanished for they are nothing but the shadow of his wanting this
  and the other, and when he is those things that he desires, where are the
  shadows of them? Do I starve without food who do not need food? Do I pine for
  love who do not need love? Do I doubt victory who am victory? There is but
  one chance of defeat, and that is that death may strike me before I have
  dared it in its own place. But even that cannot face me; by ambush or
  treachery it might take me, but I will neither expect it nor allow for it. It
  is a habit man yields to, no more; and I will be lord of that customary thing
  as I am of all, and draw power and delight from it as I do from all. Who
  follows?"</p>

  <p>Isabel, as if from a depth of meditation, answered: "But those that die
  may be lordlier than you: they are obedient to defeat. Can you live truly
  till you have been quite defeated? You talk of living by your hurts, but
  perhaps you avoid the utter hurt that's destruction."</p>

  <p>He smiled down at her. "Why, have it as you will," he said. "But it isn't
  such submission and destruction that man desires."</p>

  <p>There was a little silence; then he said again, speaking to Roger: "What.
  then will you do?"</p>

  <p>Roger looked down at the floor, and only when a much longer silence had
  gone by did he say, "Yes; I'll come. You're right&mdash;I'd decided already,
  and I won't go back."</p>

  <p>"Then", Considine said, "to-night you will be at Bernard Travers's house,
  for I shall come there. And don't fear for your wife, whatever happens. I
  will not destroy London tonight."</p>

  <p>Roger looked up again sharply. "But&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>There were voices in the hall; Muriel's, Rosamond's, others'. Roger got
  up, looking over his shoulder, and turned. Isabel and Mottreux also rose:
  only Considine stood motionless. The door opened and Rosamond came in. Behind
  her were uniforms&mdash;a police inspector followed, and another, and two or
  three men. The inspector said: "Mr. Ingram?"</p>

  <p>"What's this about?" Roger asked staring.</p>

  <p>"We've had information that there's a man here whom we want," the
  inspector said, looking round, and letting his eyes rest on Considine. "Mr.
  Nigel Considine?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Considine did not speak or move.</p>

  <p>"I've a warrant here for your arrest," the inspector said, "on a charge of
  high treason and conspiracy to murder." He showed a paper and stepped across
  the room. Mottreux said something, and the inspector glanced at him. But he
  halted a pace or two away from Considine, it might be to give his men time to
  come up, it might be from hesitation in the sudden oppression that began to
  fill the room, as if invisible waters flowed through it. The air weighed on
  them, stifling them with its rich presence; the inspector put a finger to his
  collar as he poised watchfully. Rosamond sank heavily on to a chair; Roger
  drew deep breaths, sighing as he did sometimes in his passion after repeating
  mighty verses aloud. The air spoke; in the voice of Nigel Considine the
  element of life, echoing from all around, said: "Whom?"</p>

  <p>The inspector struggled forward; it needed labour, so heavily was he
  oppressed by the depths into which the air had opened. He took a step and
  staggered as he did so. The eyes fixed on him saw him rock and steady
  himself; he said, holding himself upright, "Nigel Considine, I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am Nigel Considine," his great opponent answered, and also moved
  forward, and the quiver that went through them all answered the laughter in
  the voice. The inspector reeled again, half-falling sideways, and as he
  recovered footing a sudden hand went out towards him-whether it touched him
  or not they could not tell-and he stumbled backward once more. The wind swept
  into their faces, and on it a ringing laughter came, and in its midst
  Considine went on towards the door, with Mottreux by him, sending towards
  Roger one imperious glance from eyes bright with joy. The uniforms thronged
  and shifted and were in confusion, and wind swirled in the room as if
  strength were released through it, and Roger, half-dazed, ran forward and saw
  the two visitors already in the hall. The inspector came heavily and blindly
  back; he called out; his men moved uncertainly after Considine who paused,
  turned, and paused again.</p>

  <p>"I am Nigel Considine," he cried out. "Who takes me?"</p>

  <p>He flung out his arms as if in derisive submission, and took a step or two
  towards them. They recoiled; there was renewed confusion, men pressing back
  and pressing forward, men exclaiming and commanding. Someone slipped and
  crashed against the doorpost, someone else, thrust backward, tripped over a
  foot; there was falling and stumbling, and through it Roger saw the
  wide-armed figure offering itself in laughing scorn. Then, with a motion as
  if he gathered up the air and cast it against them, so that they blinked and
  thrust and shielded their eyes, he turned from that struggling mass of fallen
  and pushing bodies, and went to the front-door. A panting Muriel leaned
  against it; he laughed at her and signed, and hastily she drew away, opening
  it, and he and Mottreux went through.</p>

  <p>Roger gazed after him "I have lived," he sighed. "I have seen the gods.
  Phoebus, Phoebus, Python-destroyer, hear and save."</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chap9"
     id="chap9">IX.</a> &mdash; THE RIOT AND THE RAID</h2>

  <p class="first">Philip jumped on to a bus&mdash;any bus&mdash;the first he
  saw. He had been walking for ever so long, and he must sit down. But also he
  must be moving; he couldn't be shut in. Things were worse than he had ever
  imagined they could be; indeed he couldn't quite imagine what exactly they
  now were. The Hampstead flat was in a state of acute distress and turmoil; he
  had arrived that evening innocently enough, to find half a dozen policemen
  all arguing with Roger, who was glowering at Rosamond, who was crying
  hysterically in Isabel's arms, who was keeping, not without difficulty, a
  grave sympathy with all of them. He had naturally hurried to Rosamond, but
  not with the best effects; the sight of him had seemed to distract her more
  than ever. Out of the arguments and exclamations he had at last gathered
  &mdash;and more clearly after the police had at last grimly withdrawn
  &mdash;that Considine had been there, and that Rosamond, after she had
  realized who it really was, had gone through a short period of conflict with
  herself on the right thing to do. She said it had been conflict, and that
  only her duty... whereas Roger, in a few words, implied that she had been
  delighted at the chance, and that duty&mdash;except to herself&mdash;was a
  thing of which she was entirely unconscious and incapable. Anyhow, after a
  very short period she had rung up the police-station and explained to the
  authorities there what was happening. Why the police hadn't arrested
  Considine Philip couldn't understand. Isabel was concerned with her sister,
  and Roger wasn't very clear in his account. Somebody had gone through the
  midst of somebody else; somebody had been like Pythian Apollo. But he
  couldn't bother about all that; he was too anxious about Rosamond. Had he
  been challenged, he would have had to admit that for a guest to try and have
  another visitor arrested in the host's drawing-room was not perhaps... though
  for Roger to call it treachery was absurd. If anything, it was public spirit.
  He knew nothing&mdash;Rosamond had seen to that&mdash;of such an orgy as the
  episode of the chocolates which Isabel so clearly and reluctantly remembered;
  he knew nothing of a greedy gobbling child, breaking suddenly away from its
  ordinary snobbish pretences, giving way to the thrust of its secret longings
  and vainly trying to conceal from others' eyes the force of its desires. She
  had cheated herself so long, consciously in childhood, with that strange
  combination of perfect innocence and deliberate sin which makes childhood so
  blameless and so guilty at one and the same moment; less consciously in
  youth, as innocence faded and the necessity of imposing some kind of image of
  herself on the world grew stronger, till now in her first womanhood she had
  forgotten the cheat, until her outraged flesh rebelled and clamoured from
  starvation for food. And even now she would not admit it; she would neither
  fight it nor flee from it nor yield to it nor compromise with it. She could
  hardly even deny that it was there, for there was no place for it in her
  mind. She, she of all people, could never be capable of abominably longing to
  be near the dark prince of Africa; she couldn't thrill to the trumpets of
  conversion nor glow to the fires of ecstasy. Nor could she hate herself for
  refusing them. But she could and inevitably did hate the things that
  resembled them&mdash;Considine's person and Roger's verse and Philip, all of
  Philip, for Philip to her agonized sense was at once a detestable parody of
  what she wanted and a present reminder of what she longed to forget. And now,
  like all men and all women who are not masters of life, she swayed to and fro
  in her intention and even in her desire. At Kensington she had shrunk away
  from Inkamasi and fled from him; at Hampstead she thought of him and secretly
  longed for him. Power was in her and she was terrified of it. She had been
  self-possessed, but all herself was in the possessing and nothing in the
  possessed; self-controlled, but she had: had only a void to control. And now
  that nothing and that void were moved with fire and darkness; the shadow of
  ecstasy lay over her life, and denying the possibility of ecstasy she fled
  through its shadow as far as its edge, and halted irresolute, and was drawn
  back by a fascination she loved and hated. She was alive and she hated life;
  not with a free feeling of judgement but with servile fear. She hated life,
  and therefore she would hide in Hampstead; she lived, and therefore she would
  return to Kensington. But neither in Hampstead nor Kensington, in Europe nor
  Africa, in her vision of her unsubservient self, nor of her monstrous master,
  was there any place for Philip, much less a Philip aware of the exaltation of
  love.</p>

  <p>But it was not till after, shocked and bewildered by the venom she had
  flung at him in that dreadful scene, he had at last gone that she began to
  fear that her relations with Kensington might have been severed. And, not
  being there, she was determined to get back there. She would run there and
  then run away, till the strait jacket of time and place imprisoned her as it
  imprisons in the end all who suffer from a like madness. It is perhaps why
  the asylum of material creation was created, and we sit in our separate
  cells, strapped and comparatively harmless, merely foaming a little and
  twitching our fingers, while the steps and voices of unknown warders come to
  us from the infinite corridors. But Rosamond was only beginning to hurl
  herself against the walls of her cell, and the invisible warders had not yet
  had occasion to take much notice of her. The jacket waited her; when the
  paroxysm was done she would no doubt come to regard it as becoming wear and
  in the latest fashion. Whether such a belief is desirable is a question men
  have not yet been able to decide.</p>

  <p>Since Roger was so cruel to her, so detestably unfair, she would go to Sir
  Bernard; there was no other friend in London on whom she could descend
  without notice. Sir Bernard would understand her motives; he'd tried to get
  that hateful man arrested. Isabel tried her best to prevent her, saying even
  that Roger might be going away. But this didn't seem to placate Rosamond, and
  at last Isabel said no more. Roger said nothing at all until Rosamond had
  left them "to put some of her things together." Isabel said: "I'm not sure
  that it's a bad thing: Sir Bernard may be able to do something. What she
  needs is a sleeping-draught."</p>

  <p>"What she needs", Roger said, "is prussic acid."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Philip had walked, walked millions of miles, it seemed, till at
  a sudden last weariness struck him and he got on a bus. The heavens beyond
  that firmamental arm had been pouring anger and distraction and hatred down
  on him, and he didn't understand it at all. He had been trying to please
  Rosamond&mdash;which, unlike most people who use similar phrases, he actually
  had. He sat on the bus and thought so for a long time, until he became aware
  that someone was speaking to him.</p>

  <p>The conductor had come up and was standing by him, peering out through the
  front of the bus, and saying something. Philip roused himself to attention,
  and heard him say: "There's something up; can't you hear it, sir?"</p>

  <p>Philip listened and looked round. The night was clear and he recognized in
  a mass that lay on his left Liverpool Street Station. The bus was going
  slowly, for it was interrupted and hampered by a number of people running
  down the road in the same direction. There was a sound in the distance which
  resolved itself, as he listened, into the noise of shouting.</p>

  <p>"What the devil is up?" he said.</p>

  <p>The conductor&mdash;a short rather gloomy fellow&mdash;gave a sinister
  smile. "I shouldn't wonder but what I could guess," he said. "I thought it'd
  happen sooner or later. I said it was a silly business, letting it be known
  all over the place that they'd millions and millions worth of jewels in the
  house. 'Jewels to the Jews,' I called it, when it got about. Everything gets
  about. And if it wasn't jewels&mdash;and some say it wasn't&mdash;it was
  money. Hark at that! "</p>

  <p>Another shout, nearer now as the bus moved on, brought Philip to his feet.
  "Is it the Rosenbergs?" he said. "But they can't have got them here."</p>

  <p>The bus, as he spoke, turned into Bishopsgate and was brought almost to a
  stop by an accumulating crowd. Philip jumped off and allowed himself to be
  carried in the steady stream that set towards one of the side turnings. He
  caught fragments of talk: "Say they're going to bribe the negroes"; "know all
  about those bloody niggers"; "great jewels like turnips, been buying them for
  months"; "lowsy old Jews"; "Christ Almighty"; "bloody Jews." But what had
  roused the crowd he wasn't yet at all clear. His coat buttoned, and his
  collar turned up, his stick firmly grasped, he was carried round one corner
  after another. In the darkness he was aware of continually changing
  neighbours, among whom were certainly some of his own class and standing. He
  saw a brown lean face which he thought he recognized; a large fat face with
  an open mouth from which issued stridently a continual and monotonous cry of
  "Dirty Jews!"; a happy excited face&mdash;two or three of them all in a knot
  together. He was thrust backwards, sideways; the crowd lurched diversely and
  pinned him against some railings. A few feet ahead, it seemed to him, so far
  as he could judge in the darkness, that the crowd centred before a particular
  gate and house. There the shouting rose loudest, and sticks were rattled on
  the railings. He saw the helmets of two policemen within the gate and before
  the front door. Another call went up: "Come out, you bloody Jews!" "Come out
  and bring us the jewels!" "Come out and we'll show you what we'll do to the
  niggers!" He caught fresh fragments of the talk round him. A woman of sixty
  near by said with a sensuous shudder to her neighbour: "They do say that Jews
  eat babies," "Ah," said the neighbour, "foreigners'll do anything," and in a
  minute or two passed the information on in turn. Soon after, someone in front
  of the house shouted: "When did you eat the last baby?" and though a roar of
  laughter answered it, it was laughter with a hint of madness. Philip managed
  to edge a little farther towards the house, in the garden of which he now saw
  two or three hats and caps as well as the helmets. The police, however, at
  this made a sudden move, one man was flung sideways into the next narrow
  garden where he fell with a crash, another scrambled hastily the other way,
  and a third dropped flat on the ground. In the recoil that followed, Philip
  achieved the front of the house. "All right," he said hurriedly to the
  police. "I'm with you. Let me in." They took one comprehensive look at him,
  decided on the risk, and as the crowd swayed back he slipped through and
  turned to face it.</p>

  <p>"Who the hell are you?" half a dozen asked him. "Another baby-eater?"</p>

  <p>"Come to get the jewels," another voice answered. "Come on, there's only
  three of them." Nevertheless Philip's stick and the truncheons of the police
  held the front rank yet a little doubtful.</p>

  <p>In the pause a window opened over their heads and a voice said: "Why are
  you here?" A roar of laughter and abuse followed. "Hand out the jewels! Come
  out and meet us! Who's afraid of the niggers? Who's doing a bunk? Jew! Jew!
  Jew! "</p>

  <p>The voice said coldly: "Sons of abomination, what have we to do with you?
  Defilers of yourselves, who are you to come against the Holy One of
  Israel?"</p>

  <p>The laughter and abuse grew more violent. "'Ark at him," said a thin
  hungry-looking man near Philip. "O my Gawd; the 'Oly one of Hisrael! "</p>

  <p>"You may destroy the house and all that is within it," Rosenberg said,
  "and you shall be smitten with fire and pestilence and all the plagues of
  Egypt. But the jewels, even if they were here, you should not touch or see,
  for they are holy to the Lord. They are for the Temple of Zion and for
  Messias that shall be revealed."</p>

  <p>"'Im and 'is Messias," said a stout woman. "I 'opes Messias isn't in a
  'urry for them jewels! "</p>

  <p>A stone flew through the air, and at the same time a huge fellow pushed to
  the gate, where he looked up and spoke: "Look 'ere," he said, "are you
  Rosenberg?"</p>

  <p>"I am Nehemiah Rosenberg," the voice said.</p>

  <p>"Then you look 'ere. We 'appen to know that you've been in with the
  Government and the capitalists to get all this money out of the working
  classes and get away with it to the niggers as like as not. And we don't 'old
  with it. Now we don't want to 'urt you but we don't let a lot of bloody
  Sheenies get away with our money to those blasted niggers, not much we don't.
  Give us them jewels and I'll see they're put in safe keeping: I swear I will.
  And if you don't I'll damn well put a light to the house myself."</p>

  <p>A roar of applause answered him, though the stout woman, who appeared to
  Philip to preserve an attitude of detachment worthy of Sir Bernard, said
  generally: "Ah, I don't 'old with Socialism," and one of the policemen added
  agreeably: "You keep your mouth shut, Mike Cummings."</p>

  <p>"Thank Gawd," Mr. Cummings said, "I never could keep my mouth shut while
  honest men are being put on."</p>

  <p>Rosenberg leaned out of the window. "I tell you," he said, "the Lord shall
  avenge Himself upon His enemies. In the morning you shall say, 'Would God it
  were night,' and in the evening you shall say, 'Would God it were day'; and
  His anger shall be with you in your secret chamber..."</p>

  <p>Something flew through the air, struck the wall, and dropped at Philip's
  feet; something smashed the glass of the window above him. He clutched at his
  stick, and at the same time saw one of the policemen dragged sideways and
  clubs and belts appearing around him. He was back against the front door, and
  heard it creaking as the rush of the crowd in a storm of shrieks, curses, and
  yells came against him. Something hit his shoulder, a large dirty chin came
  close to his eyes, and an elbow or a stick drove into his side. At the same
  moment the door gave and they all crashed into the narrow passage together.
  The first in were past him and up the stairs; the next few in their haste
  ignored him; and then it was all darkness and pandemonium. He heard a loud
  voice upstairs, overwhelmed by the louder tumult of the crowd, a sudden
  silence above, noticeable in a momentary cessation of the uproar without, and
  then a cry: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One." Chaos beyond
  anything he had known earlier in the riot broke out again, chaos of voices,
  but also now chaos of movement&mdash;part of the crowd in the house trying to
  get out, part trying to get upstairs, part uncertain and confused. Shouts of
  "the police" were heard from the street, the pressure round Philip lightened,
  and he found one of his former allies next to him again, trying to force a
  way upstairs. Exclamations of terror broke out, the crowd thinned, and when
  at last they entered the upper room, they were only in time to prevent the
  demonstrative Mr. Cummings from slipping away. Him the constable seized,
  while Philip, taking in the appearance of the room, with a taut rope
  stretched across it and out of the window, ran across to join Ezekiel who,
  torn and bleeding, was leaning out of it. He knew before he looked out what
  he would find, nor was it till he had helped to pull up the hanging body of
  Nehemiah that he found time to wonder why the crowd had so swiftly destroyed
  their prey. But as Ezekiel and he undid the cord, and laid and arranged the
  body on the table he gathered from Cummings' persistent babble that nothing
  of the sort had been intended. The Jews were to be frightened into betraying
  the hiding-place of the money or the jewels, and the rope&mdash;meant for one
  of the packed boxes of luggage that stood by the wall&mdash;had been adjusted
  with that idea. And then Nehemiah had struggled, and the rope had slipped,
  and so "help me God" no-one was more surprised than he to hear that the Jew
  was dead.</p>

  <p>"Is it likely I'd mean to kill him? Me that's never hurt a canary! It's
  all a mistake..."</p>

  <p>"The Lord gave," Ezekiel said, standing up and looking at the body, "and
  the Lord hath taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord."</p>

  <p>By this time more police were in the room, some of them with prisoners.
  Philip explained his presence to the officer in charge, and when this was
  confirmed by the two original constables and he had given his address it was
  suggested that he might prefer to make his way home.</p>

  <p>But he hesitated as he looked at Ezekiel. "What about Mr. Rosenberg?
  Hadn't he better come with me? I'm sure my father would be glad," he said,
  and was permitted to propose it.</p>

  <p>Ezekiel nodded gravely. "A burden is laid upon me," he said. "I shall go
  alone to the land of my fathers."</p>

  <p>"If you've got any money or jewels here, Mr. Rosenberg," the Inspector
  said, "you'd better let us take charge of them."</p>

  <p>"We never had any," Ezekiel answered; "they are in safe keeping." He
  turned again to the body, intoned over it a Hebrew prayer, and, while the
  last great syllables echoed from the ceiling and walls, indicated to Philip
  that he was ready. Two constables were to come with them till they had found
  a taxi; the four went silently downstairs, and, as they came out into the
  street, heard, remote but unmistakable, the sound of the guns.</p>

  <p>In Kensington Sir Bernard and three of his guests were playing bridge
  &mdash;Caithness, Isabel and Roger. The king, as usual, was shut in his room.
  Rosamond was where Isabel had hardly dared to hope Sir Bernard would succeed
  in getting her&mdash;in bed and asleep. It was a Tuesday evening, and very
  often on Tuesday evenings, because Roger was generally free then, the Ingrams
  did visit their friend. Sometimes they played&mdash;if Philip or Rosamond or
  some other visitor would join them; sometimes they talked; sometimes they
  went to the theatre. Sometimes they even stopped the night; Sir Bernard was
  very fond of them, and between him and them existed that happy state by which
  fathers and children who are no relations may enjoy relationship rarely
  achieved by fathers and children who are. Sir Bernard all but understood
  Roger; Roger all but envied Sir Bernard. And what they did not understand and
  envy salted their talk with agreeable mystery. The evening therefore bore a
  bearable similarity to the past. The tact which Sir Bernard and Isabel
  possessed in common soothed over the fact of Rosamond's hysteria, and in
  effect combined in finding her a bed and putting her there. Once in the house
  indeed, from exhaustion or cunning or content or fear, she grew docile, and
  was content to be managed. Sir Bernard's forty years of practice had made him
  an adept at managing people. Roger had begun, from a sense of decency, to try
  to explain why they were there, or why he was there. But Sir Bernard refused
  to hear.</p>

  <p>"I'm quite sure you don't want to tell me," he said, "and being told
  things&mdash;there's nothing I like better, but a sense of duty destroys the
  satisfaction. Like the people who refuse to be loved by a sense of duty. At
  my age one's only too grateful to be loved&mdash;loved, mark you&mdash;at
  all. Let's pretend nothing ever happened."</p>

  <p>Hampered in this by the fact that the guns began almost immediately, they
  nevertheless did make the evening rather like one of their old enjoyments. It
  had been announced by Authority, after the last raid, that, in the event of
  another, official bulletins of the progress of the raid would be delivered to
  the wireless at regular intervals and announced by that means to the public.
  Arranged entertainments would, so far as possible, proceed as usual; and it
  was hoped that all listeners-in would follow their ordinary custom, and
  lessen the chance of panic, at creating which (as had been discovered in the
  Great War) all air-raids over such places as London were directed. If the
  experiment were found unsuccessful it would be discontinued after the
  trial.</p>

  <p>"We shan't want the entertainment," Sir Bernard said, "but we may as well
  know what's happening, so far as the Government will tell us."</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure of that," Isabel said. "Suppose the thing says, 'Great
  aeroplane dropping fiery bombs directly over Colindale Square'."</p>

  <p>"It won't," Caithness said. "I'll bet you a dozen pairs of gloves, Isabel,
  that if we're all blown to heaven the last thing we hear is: 'No aeroplane
  has yet reached London; the raid is being effectively repulsed.'"</p>

  <p>"Done," said Isabel.</p>

  <p>"An anthropomorphic heaven," Sir Bernard said, and picked up the
  cards.</p>

  <p>For some time the game and the entertainment proceeded. Then the first
  announcement was heard.</p>

  <p>"The first Government communique has just been received," the loud speaker
  announced. "'Raiders have attempted to approach London from all sides, but
  have entirely failed. Four enemy planes have already been brought down. A
  number of bombs have been dropped, but all in uninhabited districts. The O.
  C. London Air Defence announces that no losses have been sustained by our
  forces'."</p>

  <p>"I hope they'll use imagination," Sir Bernard said. "One or two planes
  destroyed on our side would make the bulletins credible."</p>

  <p>"I do wish you wouldn't say 'imagination'," Roger complained. "It isn't,
  you know; only the lowest kind of cunning fancy."</p>

  <p>"I've never been clear that Coleridge was right there," Caithness said
  meditatively. "Surely it's the same faculty&mdash;the adaptation of the world
  to an idea of the world."</p>

  <p>"Well, if the O. C. London Air Defence has an idea of the world," Roger
  said, "you may be right. But is an idea a pattern?"</p>

  <p>"O surely!" Caithness interrupted. "If an idea isn't a pattern what good
  is it?"</p>

  <p>"If we're playing bridge," Isabel said forbearingly, "could you manage to
  forget your ideas for a moment? Thank you so much."</p>

  <p>A new voice, after a quarter of an hour, took up the tale. "Latest
  communiqu," the loud speaker reported. "'Enemy planes continue to be
  sighted. It is supposed that in all some eight hundred are engaged in the
  raid. None have appeared over London. Five villages have been destroyed.
  African troops have been landed from giant airships, and have occupied the
  ridge of Hampstead and Richmond Park. Other airships have appeared on the
  western side. Posts of Government troops have been overwhelmed in the north
  and south'."</p>

  <p>"The devil they have!" Roger exclaimed.</p>

  <p>There was a short pause, then the loud speaker continued, with another
  variation of tone: "'In the name of the things that have been and are to be,
  willed and fated, in the name of the gods many and one&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Isabel laid down her cards, Caithness jumped to his feet; Roger sat
  upright in his chair. Sir Bernard, leaning back in his own, said in a voice
  of considerable interest, "Mr. Considine, I believe."</p>

  <p>"... the High Executive of the African Sovereigns warns the English of the
  folly of defiance. It is reluctant to make a difference in belief a reason
  for the destruction of London, and it does not propose, even under the
  provocations of the Government, to endanger the city to-night. But it is
  compelled to display the ardent and unconquerable forces at its disposal, and
  from the centre of the white race it seriously warns them that the forces now
  in action shall be multiplied a thousand times to effect the ends upon which
  it is determined&mdash;the freedom of the black peoples and the restoration
  of Africa. It exhibits something of the strength of its armies and the
  devotion of its martyrs, and it asserts firmly that, if a third raid upon
  London becomes necessary, then London shall be destroyed. It urges the
  English to consider carefully what they are fighting, and if any among them
  believe that in love and art and death rather than in logic and science the
  kingdom of man lies, it entreats them, not to any transfer of allegiance, for
  it recognizes in the folly of patriotism a means of obedience to the same
  passionate imagination, but to a demonstration on behalf of peace. In the
  name of their own loyalties it appeals to the children of passion and
  imagination; in the name of a vaster strength than their own it threatens the
  children of pedantry and reason&mdash;in this first proclamation made at
  London in the first year of the Second Evolution of Man'."</p>

  <p>"Then," Sir Bernard said, "with more adequate assurance than Drake had, we
  can go on with the game."</p>

  <p>But Roger and Caithness were both on their feet. Caithness said, "I
  wouldn't trust him too far."</p>

  <p>Isabel, still looking at her cards, murmured, "I don't think you need
  worry, Mr. Caithness. He told us the same thing this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"You've seen him?" Caithness incredulously exclaimed. "Yes," Isabel said.
  "In fact, we made a kind of appointment with him."</p>

  <p>"You did?" Caithness said, still more astonished.</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;I did for Roger," Isabel said, and lifted her eyes. "He'd
  never have done it himself. I hope you didn't mind, Sir Bernard?"</p>

  <p>"Almost thou persuadest me to be a monogamist," Sir Bernard said, but
  there was unusual tenderness in his voice. "Here, do you mean? Because, if
  so, perhaps that's him."</p>

  <p>It was not; it was Philip and the Jew. They came into the room accompanied
  by Inkamasi who had descended from his to discover the progress of the raid.
  Philip introduced Ezekiel to Sir Bernard and in a low voice gave him the
  brief tale of the evening.</p>

  <p>"I'm very glad you're here, Mr. Rosenberg," Sir Bernard said, in quite a
  different tone from his usual placidity. "I'm your servant in everything.
  You'll use us as you will. Ring, Philip."</p>

  <p>But even as Philip's finger touched the bell there was a louder ring in
  the hall. Sir Bernard paused and glanced swiftly at Isabel, who sat down by
  the card-table. In the minute that it took the feet of the maid to go to the
  front door she looked up at Roger and said: "Be good to me, my darling, and
  find out everything you can." Roger, more shaken than she, did not answer
  except by his gaze. There were voices and footsteps; then the door was thrown
  wide open and Considine stood in the entrance of the room. Behind him was
  Mottreux, and behind him again two or three others&mdash;in whose faces, so
  far as he could see them, Sir Bernard thought he recognized the gentlemen who
  had waited on them during the dinner at Hampstead. But he had no time to
  consider; he looked back, where everyone else was looking, at the High
  Executive who stood in the entrance.</p>

  <p>"A good meeting," Considine said, "but I mustn't wait. Who will come with
  me?"</p>

  <p>In the immediate silence Roger heard himself say, "I."</p>

  <p>"The king also," Considine said.</p>

  <p>"Fool," the Zulu cried. "You've come to me now, and do you think you'll
  get away? You're mine, you're mine."</p>

  <p>He was standing almost on the other side of the room, nine or ten feet
  away. But as he ended, he crouched low, and in one terrific movement leapt
  &mdash;right across the intervening space, sending himself forward and
  upward, so that he crashed down on Considine as a thunderbolt might strike
  from the sky. His hands were at the other's throat, and before that descent
  of angry vengeance even Considine for a moment staggered and seemed likely to
  fall. But before he could either fall or recover, in the second after the
  onslaught fell, Mottreux sprang forward. The others saw the revolver in his
  hand and cried out; their voices were overwhelmed by the shot. Inkamasi
  reeled and crashed, his hand to his thigh where the blood showed. Considine
  recovered himself and glanced at his friend.</p>

  <p>"Mottreux, Mottreux, is it necessary?" he murmured. "Am I afraid of his
  hands? Well, it's done; let Vereker see to him. It's only a flesh wound."</p>

  <p>He moved a step aside, so that another of his companions could come
  forward and do what he could with Isabel's help and with improvised bandages
  for the wounded man. After a few minutes Considine went on: "Mr. Ingram and
  the king; Mr. Rosenberg, I have your cousin's jewels, and others I have
  bought for you. Come with me; there's no place for you here." He cast a
  glance around. "Is there any of you beside for whom that's true?"</p>

  <p>"If you take the king you shall take me," Caithness cried out. "I demand
  that you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why demand?" Considine's laugh answered him. "I invite you, I entreat
  you, to come. Sir Bernard?"</p>

  <p>"No," Sir Bernard said. "We've come out of the jungle and I for one am not
  going back."</p>

  <p>"The king, Mr. Caithness, Mr. Rosenberg, Mr. Ingram," Considine said.
  "Very well. Mrs. Ingram?"</p>

  <p>"No," Isabel said. "Africa's near enough here."</p>

  <p>"You are perhaps a wise woman," Considine said, "but if you are you shall
  be a centre of our wisdom in London, and all the women of England shall learn
  from you what it is they do. Your husband shall come back to you with
  victory. Good-night then. Good-night, Sir Bernard; I leave you to the sauces
  that you prefer to food. Come, my friends; come, my enemies. Mottreux, you
  and Vereker shall make the king as comfortable as you can in the first car.
  The others will come with me in the second."</p>

  <p>He swept them with him out to the door, to the large cars that waited for
  them. Roger, obeying a gesture, got in and sat down with his back to the
  engine; Caithness sat by him.</p>

  <p>Opposite the priest was the Jew. Considine occupied the other seat.
  Figures moved about the other car; from the doorway Isabel and Sir Bernard
  silently watched. Considine raised a hand to them, and as the car slid away
  he said to Roger, "There is defeat defeated. But you may be at ease; there is
  again to-night no danger to them from my people. And tomorrow, or if not
  to-morrow then the day after, the Government will ask for peace."</p>

  <p>"Surely they won't dare," Roger said. "And if you're not hurting London,
  what are you doing?"</p>

  <p>"I'm teaching London to feel," Considine said, "to feel terribly. It will
  know panic to-night such as it has never known. It will know the depths which
  it has never dared to find. Blame its sterile hopelessness for its
  suffering."</p>

  <p>"Is that why you bring the African armies here?" Caithness asked.</p>

  <p>"Armies?" Considine laughed. "O I know I caused that tale to be spread.
  But those of my people who are here are entering into their greatest moment,
  and I give them the sacrifice they desire. Wait; you shall see them." He
  picked up the speaking-tube and said something to the driver. The car ran
  swiftly northward, went round by Regent's Park, into St. John's Wood, and
  came out at last round Primrose Hill on to Haverstock Hill somewhere below
  Belsize Park Station. But a few minutes showed that this way was impossible.
  The road was full of people pressing downward, less thick below the station
  because of the mob that surged round the entrance, which no vehicle could get
  through. Beyond and above it the Hill was a noisy tumult of refugees, and
  beyond in the midnight sky was a red glare, above which again the useless
  searchlights crossed and wavered. Hysterical shrieks, curses, the noise of
  many separate scuffles came to them. Near them two wheelbarrows laden with
  bundles had come into collision, and the owners were fighting wildly in the
  midst of their scattered goods. Here and there a woman lay in a dead faint;
  in places the white robes and black cloaks of the Dominicans of the Priory
  showed as they laboured to create some sort of order. ("No doubt", Considine
  murmured to Caithness, "the Anglican clergy are somewhere about too. But of
  course they haven't the same advantage in dress. ") More and more fugitives
  were hurrying from the side turnings. Even as the car slowed down, to turn
  down one of these and escape, two young men scrambled on to the driver's
  seat. "This car is going to take us," one said drunkenly; the other hung on
  to the wheel. Roger glanced at Considine, who, observant but motionless, was
  lying back in his corner. The driver abandoned the wheel, and with what
  seemed but a light blow knocked one sprawling into the road; the other let go
  the wheel to protect himself, was dexterously flung overboard also, and the
  car backed a little way down the Hill. Considine took up the tube again. "Go
  round as far as is necessary," he said. "I must come to the top."</p>

  <p>Eventually, after many pauses and very long detours, the thing was done.
  They came back from the north on to the Hampstead ridge, and heard beyond
  them a noise quite different to anything that had passed before. "I will have
  the car opened," Considine said to the driver. "Go slowly till you come near
  Highgate and then bend away to the stopping-place."</p>

  <p>The glare by now had become much stronger, and Roger saw Considine
  suddenly stand up. Almost at the same moment a great cry in a strange tongue
  roared out beyond them. A black soldier appeared running and shouting beside
  the car, and another, and then, rushing towards them, a whole group. He heard
  the steady beating of drums, and a cry resolving itself into English:
  "Deathless! Deathless! Glory to the Deathless One!" Considine, raising his
  right hand, made with it, high in the air, a sudden gesture; the cry beat all
  round them and ceased and broke out yet more wildly: "Glory to the Master of
  Love! Glory to the Deathless One!" Negroes ran by the car, rushing up to it,
  to touch it and fall back exhausted; they leapt and twisted at it.</p>

  <p>He felt a sudden lurch and guessed insanely what the obstacle was they had
  passed over. The cries, now in African, now in English, made an arch of
  sound: "Death for the Deathless One!" he heard. "Glory to the Lord of Death!"
  They were passing now between blazing fires each with its own dance of
  whirling figures, which broke and hurled themselves at the car, or flung
  themselves prostrate in adoration as it rolled by. Opposite him the figure of
  Considine seemed to dilate in the red glare; again and again he made the high
  mysterious gesture with his right hand; every now and then he cried out in a
  great voice and a strange tongue. Roger tore his eyes away and looked out
  over the Heath, but beyond the light of the watch-fires it lay in darkness, a
  darkness which seemed to him to be continually resolving itself into these
  leaping, shrieking figures. Caithness was leaning back in his corner, his
  eyes shut, his lips moving in swift murmured prayer.</p>

  <p>Roger looked back as the car suddenly stopped and Considine, signing for
  silence, began to speak. What he said Roger could not tell, but as he ended
  and the car moved on again, a shout greater than any before went up. He knew
  instinctively the meaning&mdash;it was that whereof the rhythm leapt into the
  former English: "Death for the Deathless."</p>

  <p>But whatever the cries, Death itself began to accompany them on their
  passage, for there was heard suddenly a revolver shot, and then another, and
  as Roger, supposing for a moment that the English had begun an attack, looked
  round him, he saw one of the running foaming figures by the car stabbing at
  himself with a bayonet, and saw the madness spreading to others, saw the
  steel glinting and crimson-streaked faces in the light of the fires. Many of
  the negroes had torn off their tunics, and some were already naked from head
  to foot; among whom appeared here and there a yet wilder form in skins of
  various kinds and high plumes of feathers, leading some eddy of the general
  dance. Close by him two great negroes caught and held and stabbed at each
  other with broad knives and more shots sounded around them. Again and again
  he felt a horrid jerk and lurch of the car, and still through it all
  Considine stood upright opposite him, and with an exalted but unmoved face
  considered the revelry he had bidden to be.</p>

  <p>At last this journey along a ridge of blazing watch-fires between two seas
  of darkness came to an end. The crowds of negroes began to thin. Considine
  threw up both hands, made a downward and outward gesture, cried out once
  more, and sat down. The last negro halted, flung himself on the earth, the
  car gathered strength, swept on, and after a while issued at last into the
  darkness and silence of the open country.</p>

  <p>Caithness spoke bitterly, "Are you letting that horde of negroes loose on
  London?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"You heard me," Considine answered. "You heard me an hour ago. I have let
  the English feel panic, panic such as they have not felt since the Vikings
  raided their coasts and burned their towns a thousand years ago. They have
  been afraid of their feelings, of ecstasy and riot and savage glee; they have
  frozen love and hated death. And I have shown them these things wild and
  possibly triumphant; and what fear of a thousand armies will not do, fear of
  their own passions will. They will ask for peace. As for my Africans, they
  ask for death and they shall have death. Most of them will kill themselves or
  one another to-night; those who survive till to-morrow will die before your
  soldiers. I do not pity them; they are not the adepts; all that they are
  capable of I have given them. They die for the Undying. How many martyrs
  would the Churches offer me of such a strain?"</p>

  <p>"They die for your schemes," Caithness said.</p>

  <p>"They die for the Master of Death," Considine answered, "either for me or
  for another. If I do not achieve, another will. Do you think it is an idle
  brag to call this year the First of the Second Evolution? It is a truth the
  story of your Christ darkly foreshadowed. Him that you ignorantly worship
  declare I unto you. Your martyrs in the past have died, many of them, in such
  an agony of supreme rapture, and those of many another faith. But I bring you
  achievement, I bring you the fulfilment of desires, the lordship of love and
  death."</p>

  <p>There was a little silence; then he went on, slowly and almost to himself:
  "It is a long work, and many have waited for it. My father longed for it and
  did not see it, though he knew the beginning and taught it to me. This was
  the beginning of sex when far away in the ages the world divided itself in
  its primal dark instinct to destroy death which seemed its doom. And when man
  came he desired immortality, and deceived himself with begetting children and
  with religion and with art. All these are not ecstasy, but the shadow of
  ecstasy. Kingship and dynasties he created and cities and monuments and
  science, and nothing satisfied that hungry desire. And then he created love,
  and knew that that which existed between a man and a woman was mysterious and
  powerful, but what to do with it he has not known. Only a few have known,
  Caesar and a few others, and they have been struck down. I think perhaps
  Chaka knew, for he was of the initiates. I taught him what to do and how to
  govern his energies. But he had an irresistible hunger for cruelty and
  destruction, and when the time came he was destroyed. For the true adepts
  care for nothing but to discover the secrets, and to enter into communion
  with ecstasy; and if they shall govern the world, as they shall, they will do
  it to make known to all men the things they themselves know. Fast and vigil
  they keep for this, as my father taught me when r was a boy two centuries
  ago. In trance and in waking they keep the end before them. I beheld in a
  trance the making of sex, I went down to where in history and in the
  individual being&mdash;which are one, as all the mystics know: inward or
  backward, it is the same way&mdash;to where those high laboratories lie. And
  there, in trance or in waking I do not know, I myself carried out the great
  experiment, and I laid my imagination upon all the powers and influences of
  sex and love and desire. In the adolescence of my life I did this, and I have
  thriven upon that strength ever since. For first I bent it to my own life. I
  set before myself three hundred years from that night, and not two hundred
  have since gone by. I have gathered from many women all that imagination
  desired, and I have changed it to strength and cunning and length of days. I
  have never kissed a woman; all that have lived with me have had what lovers
  they desired. For a kiss also is but the shadow of ecstasy. Then they taught
  me in the lodge of the initiated how, though death might be far, yet it was
  certain, and that at death the ghost of man wanders stripped of all powers
  that it has gained in a place of shadows, and that there remained yet to be
  found the secret of how man could go into that place armed with passion and
  high delight and return to this world when and as he would. He that has
  mastered love has mastered the world, and he that masters death is lord of
  that other. Also as the delights of mere bodily love are but shadows beside
  the rich joys of the transforming imagination, so this itself is nothing
  compared to the revivifying intoxication of the passage from life to death
  and from death to life. And I set my purpose on this and laboured to achieve
  it. But, while I brooded, the feet of Europe came nearer, and the blind
  intelligence of Europe looked into the clear light of the lodges and said:
  'It is dark, it is dark,' and smelt wickedness. And the religion of Europe
  came, and the learning of Europe. Then we the adepts knew that, unless we
  made Africa free, in a little while Europe would trample over us and we
  should be gone; and we resolved that Europe must be stayed."</p>

  <p>He paused and looked out over the fields and hedges between which they
  were passing. Then he went on more sharply and swiftly:</p>

  <p>"Not that all the Europeans who came to Africa then had closed themselves
  to wisdom. Some of the white officers sat in our lodges and were initiated
  and entered into trance, and made themselves strong men; there have always
  been some who would do this&mdash;Mottreux was one; I met him in Uganda, and
  there was a French General in Morocco, and in the south Simon Rosenberg's
  great uncle. And there were others. All of us set to work to unite Africa. We
  knew the lodges already in various parts of the land, and we drew all these
  into one. And we spoke with the chiefs and kings; little by little we brought
  them into our purpose. The witch-doctors and sorcerers were ours already,
  though they were in the outer circle. They gave us a means of ruling the
  tribes, and little by little through many years we proposed to ourselves to
  show the people of Africa the doctrines of freedom and sacrifice and ecstasy,
  and I determined to strike at Europe by panic and strength."</p>

  <p>Roger said abruptly, "Yet you seemed to wish that Mottreux hadn't
  fired."</p>

  <p>"Why, for myself," Considine said, "if men without weapons come against me
  I'll meet them without weapons, heart to heart and strength to strength. But
  shall I waste years imposing my will on the Governments of Europe&mdash;and
  spend my energies so? It shall be a shorter business. They proclaim guns and
  they shall have guns. But for the adepts&mdash;If I wish Mottreux had not
  fired it was for his sake, not mine."</p>

  <p>"Your friends may fire at you one day," the intolerant voice of the priest
  broke in, "when they want something you can't give them."</p>

  <p>"Pieces of silver, for example," Considine said, not turning his head.</p>

  <p>The night lay about them; they swept on through it. Roger looked out on
  the unseen countryside, and remembered the words that had brought about his
  own meeting with the conquistador who sat opposite him. "I will encounter
  darkness as a bride"&mdash;he was rushing towards that darkness now. The dark
  closed them in, but they were speeding towards the core of the darkness; the
  words themselves were swallowing them up. All the miracles of the poets had
  rent and illumined and charged that night, but the mingling light and dark
  which was in all easily accepted verse lay far behind them now where the wild
  rapture of the Africans surged above London. It was as if he had passed from
  them from something which was himself, to something which was even more
  himself. His very physical body was being carried in towards the energy which
  created art. Art... the ancient word so often defiled and made stupid stood
  for a greatness only partially explored. His body felt the energy opposite
  him&mdash;an energy self-restrained, self shaped. "And hug it in mine arms
  &mdash;" but if the arms could not bear it, if the awful blasting power of
  that darkness should destroy him as the glory of Zeus destroyed Semele? It
  was too late now for choice; he was lost and saved at once. Onward and
  onward, away from the ironic contemplations of the children of the wise world
  and from the shrieking self-immolating abandonments of the more ignorant sons
  of rapture; away from young perplexity and young greed; away from Isabel.
  High-set, as the moon now rising, he saw her, knowing in her daily
  experiences, her generous heart and her profound womanhood, all that he must
  compass sea and land to find. This was the separation that had been between
  man and woman from the beginning; this was fated, and this must be willed. It
  was the everlasting reconciliation of the everlasting contradiction-to will
  what was fated, to choose necessity. Perfect for one moment in his heart, he
  knew the choice taken. He willed necessity. All the poets had done this in
  their own degree&mdash;the very making of their verse was this, their
  patience and their labour, their silence till the utterance they so long
  desired rose into being within them. This was the secret of royalty&mdash;the
  solemn anointed figure of government to whom necessary obedience was willed,
  and so through all orders of hierarchical life, secular or religious,
  vocational in every kind, trade or profession, ceremonial or actual. Love too
  was its image, but love and not the beloved was the necessity; to love, and
  only to the beloved as the sacred means, the honourable toil was given.</p>

  <p>Something different was in the air; his nostrils felt, far off, the smell
  of the sea.</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chap10"
     id="chap10">X.</a> &mdash; LONDON AFTER THE RAID</h2>

  <p class="first">The wild figures that danced on the outskirts of London that
  night were but few and scattered representations of the more monstrous forms
  that filled it within. The serpent skins that clothed some of the leaders of
  the dance were poor vestments if compared to the mad dragons of escaping
  multitudes. Considine had indeed loosed but few of his meinies on the hills
  of the north and the south; he had not cared, it was afterwards discovered,
  even to justify the announcements of burning villages and destroyed troops
  which he had caused to be broadcast. A few bombs had been dropped but more
  for noise and mental horror than to destroy. He had even reassured London,
  speaking from its centre. But there were many whom the reassurance did not
  solace, and there were many, many more, who did not hear it, for they were
  already in flight. It was known in the small streets and the slums of the
  extremer suburbs that the Africans had landed, and of those who in those
  crowded buildings heard the news there were few who did not rush out to seek
  safety. The north fled southwards; the south fled northwards; the west broke
  away towards the east. Over the east alone no hostile airfleet manoeuvred and
  fought the English planes while its laden airships sank earthward to landing
  places prepared long since. Many a house with wide grounds had waited for
  this night; flares summoned the enemy and they came. At most they numbered
  few enough in comparison with the defenders, and they were not meant for
  attack. But on all convenient heights their fires blazed, and sacred revels
  were begun which till now had been hidden in the black night of African
  swamps. As there the wild animals fled from the drums, the conches, and the
  screams, so now the terrified population rushed away to what it hoped was
  safety. The slums poured out their people, and not the slums alone. From many
  a fine house, lying happily on the outer rim of London, cars issued bearing
  huddled women and children, while men, both young and old, drove them
  furiously away. A brother coming back home would bear the news, or a father
  peering from a window would be aware, dreadfully near him, of the awful
  barbarian tumult breaking out, and household after household sought by their
  mechanical inventions to escape from the strange gospel which called to their
  uncomprehending minds. Considine's voice had hardly ceased its proclamation
  when opposite Charing Cross a laden car from near the Heath crashed into
  another similarly laden from the Terrace at Richmond. This was but the first
  of many similar catastrophes. London became the enemy of London; civil war,
  chaotic and bloody, surged through the streets. Ealing and Highgate and
  Streatham, listening to the guns, heard instead the riot roaring through
  them, hesitated and feared and shrank, and then, as the rumours grew louder,
  and the panic in the streets spread into the houses, themselves swept out to
  swell the flood. The spray of the approaching waves of humanity mingled; the
  first fugitives passed each other and soon began to call out, and heard how
  they fled not towards safety but towards new danger. And behind those
  earliest and most timorous souls came the main hurrying processions. They
  came up towards the centre; stations and tubes were choked, and yet tubes and
  stations offered no certain refuge from an enemy pursuing on foot. It was not
  merely death dropped from the skies that threatened but death hastening along
  on earth. Round about Piccadilly and Pall Mall, clambering over the railings
  of the parks, trying to rest in Trafalgar Square, surging over the bridges
  and even running on and falling from their parapets, surging also from the
  thoroughfares of the north, the mob converged on the central lines of Oxford
  Street and Holborn and Cheapside, of the Strand and Fleet Street and Ludgate
  Hill and Cannon Street. There it sought to pause, but still the continual
  presence thrust it from behind, and now it was driven on not merely to escape
  death that pursued from afar but death that threatened close at hand. The
  mere necessity of breath oppressed it, the desire of escape not from Africa
  but from itself. Ignorant and at odds with itself it swayed and exuded
  itself, and was magnetised by some slight movement and rushed after in blind
  despair or even blinder hope. A woman with a baby would take a few steps down
  a partly deserted turning, and others would follow, and a small eddy would be
  set up which a mile away was reflected in another insane and multitudinous
  onrush. A young man would pull his girl into an arch or doorway for rest, and
  others would see and follow, and a little tumult would break out in that
  greater tumult, and the first couple were fortunate indeed if they both
  emerged from that tiny crush alive into the ever-moving surges that poured by
  them. Yet, terrible as the fear was, fear was not present alone; desire and
  loathing and the cruel darkness of abandoned souls walked in the mist of the
  crowds and took their pleasure as they could. Abominable things were done,
  which none saw or seeing stopped to prevent. Shrieks went up in hidden
  corners, and laughter and sudden silences answered them, silences hardly
  discernible in the general roar and themselves filled with the never-ceasing
  sound of the guns. How many devotees of Considine's choosing rode through the
  air to death that night was never rightly known, but not till the late
  November dawn was high did the movement of his planes or the efforts of the
  English gunners cease. There was therefore, for the elements of demented
  London, no desire of return as there was no chance of return; within and
  without the passionate terror hurled them on. Farther and farther east they
  poured; not merely the Thames but great reservoirs and docks and small
  tributaries of small rivers, swallowed those who were pushed aside; and there
  were puddles in the street which were not water where someone had striven to
  guard his belongings, and heaps that were a dreadful hindrance to those who
  came behind. A pestilence of the spirit walked in the night and slew its
  victims as it went.</p>

  <p>It hovered in the streets; it rested in churches and such public buildings
  as had been readily and benevolently opened. For in the early hours of the
  exodus men had supposed that it would, however serious and tragic, still be
  quiet and controlled. Certain authorities therefore had hoped that the
  buildings in their charge would be of use to exhausted fugitives. St. Paul's,
  in a holy goodwill, was so opened. The crowd entered, increased, filled it,
  flowed over the rails of the sanctuary, clambered upon the altars, and within
  its walls suffered and inflicted horror. The windows of public-houses, as of
  eating-houses and gunsmiths, had been smashed, and bottles of drink obtained,
  and the strongest men made use of their strength. On the High Altar a drunken
  woman smashed a bottle over the head of a vociferating assailant, and was
  shot by his companion before the victim had died. The kingship which Inkamasi
  so proudly held had here its apish rival in savage might or dextrous cunning;
  yet that kingship was unstained, as all lovely things are unstained by their
  detestable imitations, since beauty cannot be manifested unless the mind
  assents. Without that assent, beauty itself must be tyranny; but with that
  grave acceptance there is no government that is not beautiful, for love is
  not only the fulfilling but the beginning of the law.</p>

  <p>In Kensington all that night Sir Bernard watched, as if on a rocky island
  &mdash;one of a scattered archipelago of such islands&mdash;a lingering child
  of a lost race watched the sea overwhelm his city. After the departure of
  Considine with his guests or prisoners&mdash;no-one was quite sure which they
  were&mdash;Sir Bernard had gone back with Isabel and Philip to the library.
  He stood there with his back to the fire, surveying the room, the stains of
  blood on the carpet and the divan, the empty chairs round the card-table, and
  the dropped cards, the general disarray that had meant companionship and now
  meant desertion. He looked at Isabel, now enduring a separation deeper than
  his own&mdash;at least, presumably; everyone would say it was. Even in that
  moment he found himself wondering whether Isabel or he would miss Roger the
  most; it was so difficult to compare these things. Isabel had lost her
  husband; and he had lost&mdash;a friend who lived mostly in Yorkshire, and a
  younger friend whom he saw perhaps three or four times a month for an hour or
  two, and a barbarian chief whom he'd only known a few days. O and a Jewish
  mystic whom he didn't know at all. They didn't, all of them put together,
  sound intimate beside Isabel's loss, and yet... It wasn't whom you lost; it
  was what you lost, what centre of what concern or quality of yourself was
  torn away, so that your own capacity moved helplessly in the void. Something
  very like stability had been torn from under him. He looked at Isabel again
  and wondered. Was it merely her youth that made her seem, in that house of
  desertion, the least deserted of them all? He was old; he'd outlived his
  time; he was living on his memories. There went through him a rare flash of
  envy; Isabel hadn't to live on her memories, Isabel &mdash;</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard recaptured a sense of proportion. "No-one who's just in the
  throes of seeing Considine go off with a Zulu, a Jew, a clergyman, and an
  expert in the poets ought to talk of living on his memories," he said to
  himself. He said to Isabel as tenderly as possible: "Why did you tell Roger
  to go?"</p>

  <p>"Because I wanted him to, since he wanted to," she said. "More; for I
  wanted him to even more than he did, since I hadn't myself to think of and he
  had."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard blinked. "I see," he said. "But&mdash;I only ask&mdash;isn't
  it a little risky... deciding what other people want?"</p>

  <p>"Dear Sir Bernard, I wasn't deciding," she said, "I was wanting. It isn't
  quite the same thing. I want it&mdash;whatever he wants. I don't want it
  unselfishly, or so that he may be happy, or because I ought to, or for any
  reason at all. I just want it. And then, since I haven't myself to think of,
  I'm not divided or disturbed in wanting, so I can save him trouble. That's
  all."</p>

  <p>"O quite, quite," Sir Bernard said. "That would be all. And is that what
  you call quiet affection?"</p>

  <p>Isabel looked a trifle perplexed. "I don't call it anything," she said.
  "There isn't anything to call it. It's the way things happen, if you love
  anyone."</p>

  <p>"Of course," Sir Bernard said. "Too much excitement has made me dull
  to-night. Of course, it's the way things happen. The whole round world has
  noticed it. So you wanted Roger to go?"</p>

  <p>Isabel said, a little unhappily: "When you put it like that it sounds
  somehow as if I didn't really, or only because he wanted to. Don't you see I
  couldn't want it because of him? He&mdash;somehow he wanted it in me. O I
  don't know. I'm not as intelligent as you, but I know it was the one thing I
  had to have to make me happy."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard looked at her again, very steadily. "And does it make you
  happy?"</p>

  <p>"Utterly," Isabel said. "O of course it's dreadfully painful,
  but&mdash;yes, utterly."</p>

  <p>On that rich and final word they fell into silence. Irony, even loving
  irony, could say no more. The mind accepted a fact which was a contradiction
  in terms, and knew itself defeated by that triumphant contradiction. Sir
  Bernard wished he could have heard Considine and Isabel arguing&mdash;not
  that Isabel would or could have argued. So far as he could see, she was
  saying exactly the opposite of Considine, and yet they curiously agreed. They
  were both beyond the places of logic and compromise, even amused compromise.
  They were both utterly, utterly&mdash;well, they were both utterly, and that
  was that. It was no wonder Isabel didn't want to go to Africa.</p>

  <p>It was Philip who presently, wandering restlessly about the house, brought
  them news of the number of fugitives who were beginning to hurry along
  Kensington High Street. Sir Bernard, hearing, frowned. "This," he said, "if
  it's happening everywhere, may mean pure hell before long. Let's go and look
  from upstairs." There was an attic window which commanded the High Street,
  and from it they surveyed the increasing crowd. A few of the fugitives,
  turning aside, hurried through the square in which the house stood, but not
  many; most of them pressed frantically onwards.</p>

  <p>"I'd better make sure the front door's fastened up," Philip said suddenly.
  "We don't want any of them pushing in." He added, more carefully, "I suppose
  actually there's no danger."</p>

  <p>"Of course not," Isabel said. "Mr. Considine said he wasn't going to hurt
  London."</p>

  <p>"I don't really see," Sir Bernard said, "how one can be expected to
  believe Mr. Considine. You can't refuse your mind and yet have people accept
  your word, can you?"</p>

  <p>"But surely you do believe him?" Isabel said. "He said so."</p>

  <p>"I know he said so," Sir Bernard patiently explained. "What I'm trying
  &mdash;O very well. Besides, you're right. I do believe him, but I can't
  think why I should. The Second Evolution of Man, I suppose. Considine at the
  bottom of a well&mdash;and what a well! "</p>

  <p>"That man's very tired," Isabel said, watching a party of five; a woman
  carrying one child, a man with two, who had just turned into the square, and
  were stopping even in their haste for a necessary minute. "He oughtn't to go
  on&mdash;nor ought she. Sir Bernard, don't you think&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Sir Bernard said. "I suppose you want to rest, too. Good God, you
  do! And feed?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Isabel said, blushing slightly, "I was thinking, if you'd got any
  milk, the children... I could just go and speak to them."</p>

  <p>"Then Philip will go too," Sir Bernard said. "Ecstasy has very curious
  forms sometimes, especially if it happens to be attacking anyone who
  isn't."</p>

  <p>"Isn't what?" asked Isabel. "I thought you were talking about me."</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard took her arm. "Come down," he said. "Philip, go and open the
  door," and as the young man obeyed, "Is that true?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She turned clear eyes upon him. "I'm no good at words," she said, "and I'm
  a fool at knowing things, but when there's something in you that has its way,
  and when Roger's doing what he must do, and I too&mdash;O every fibre of me's
  aching for him and I could sing for joy all through me. Isn't that all the
  ecstasy that I could bear? Come and let's do something before it breaks my
  heart to be alive."</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chap11"
     id="chap11">XI.</a> &mdash; THE HOUSE BY THE SEA</h2>

  <p class="first">It was indeed by the sea that the house stood at which the
  car eventually arrived. Through the wide porch in front of which it stopped
  the light shone from the open door; a light in which expectant figures moved
  and waited. Roger got out, stiff and weary, and as he stretched himself
  wondered afresh at that strange company of travellers. His fellows seemed
  less weary than he; the old Jew's movements were slow but not difficult, and
  Caithness, once out, glanced swiftly round him as if to discover any sign of
  the king. Oppression lay, Roger thought, on him alone, perhaps because he
  alone was yet unused to a deliberate co-habitation with belief. The past
  popularity, the long tradition of religion supported its diverse champions
  against a present neglect. But art had never been popular, and its lovers in
  all ages were few and solitary. His own belief was as passionate as that of
  the Jew or the Christian, but it was more often thwarted and more greatly
  troubled.</p>

  <p>They gathered in a group, waiting for that fourth of their company in
  whose train they had been brought there, the incarnate epiphany of immortal
  conquest. He delayed to speak to the driver, and as the others stood they
  savoured more fully the presence of the ocean. They could hear the faint
  sound of it in the darkness; they could smell and feel it in the air, as if
  the secret medium of all their journeys sensibly expressed itself to them.
  Fresh and everlasting, alien yet alluring, distant and deep yet delicate and
  close, it drew them together and unified them by its subtle existence.
  Caithness said unnecessarily: "We must be close to the shore; that's the
  waves we hear." Neither of the others answered him, and before the words had
  well died away Considine came up to them. He invited them with a gesture and
  they followed. In the porch Mottreux met them. He saluted his master and
  said: "All's well: we've put the king in his room. He's in a slight fever but
  otherwise he's all right."</p>

  <p>Considine nodded. "The captain's not here yet?" he asked. "No; I hardly
  expected him. To-morrow. My friends will be tired; show them their
  rooms."</p>

  <p>"I should like to see the king," Caithness said, with a sound of
  challenge.</p>

  <p>Roger saw Considine's smile leap out. "Take Mr. Caithness to him then," he
  said to Mottreux, and then to the priest: "But do remember, Mr. Caithness,
  that the king, being a Christian, is not yet able to be negligent of material
  hurt. You and Sir Bernard insisted on his being liable to pain; you'll no
  doubt teach him to endure pain." He turned to the others. "Good-night, Mr.
  Rosenberg," he said, "to-morrow we'll talk of your journey. Good-night,
  Ingram; sleep." His eyes looked into Roger's and sent through him a doctrine
  of obedience. He and the ocean swept the young man up and away into
  themselves; Roger saluted and followed the gentleman who waited for him.</p>

  <p>They came into a hall which opened round them as if into distances. The
  walls were hung or covered with some kind of deep grey from which light
  shone, almost as over a landscape. Its furniture was not merely furniture but
  natural to it; a chest showed like an antique boulder on a hillside; a table
  was a table certainly, but it had grown in its place, and had not been set
  there, a chair or two glowed darkly as if shrubs of glistening leaves
  reflected the sun. Roger walked after his guide with a sense of perfect
  proportion such as no room he had ever entered, however admirably decorated,
  had given him; the best had been but arranged art, pleasant to his judgement,
  while this was an art which answered his human nature and contented his
  blood. It communicated peace. He followed up a staircase, down a corridor,
  and was shown into a perfectly ordinary guest-room, where all necessities
  awaited him. His companion uttered a few courteous sentences, smiled, bowed,
  and left him. Roger went across to the window, but he could not see outside;
  the darkness was too deep. He thought of going back and switching off the
  light, took a step that way, and felt all through his body Considine's voice
  saying: "Sleep." To oppose that government was too much for him; he turned to
  the dressing-table.</p>

  <p>As he made ready for sleep he thought once more of Isabel. The knowledge
  of her moved him, yet differently. He had been apt to wonder what he could do
  for her; now indeed he wondered what he could do. There was all his
  knowledge, all his concern, but it opened up like a mountain lake from which
  as yet no irrigating streams ran to the plains below. The weight and darkness
  of this power pressed on him; he himself was the bank which closed those
  waters in, yet far away he was also the plain which needed those waters. They
  lay silent; they held such mysteries as verse held, and sometimes the surface
  of them was troubled by a wind which rippled it into words. "The passion and
  the life whose fountains are within..." "felt in the blood and felt along the
  heart..." (what passion along what blood?), "in embalmed darkness guess each
  sweet" (what hint of what discovery?), "Where the great vision of the guarded
  Mount... ("the guarded Mount"... what vision?), "fear no more the heat...
  fear no more... "(did that song come from within the vision of the guarded
  Mount wherein also the passion and the fountains of life lay?), "fear no
  more... merrily, merrily, shall I live now." They did not answer each other;
  they flowed towards each other and intermingled, and dissolved each into
  others, meaning in sound, sound in meaning, and always fresh ripples rose and
  ran on that dark surface, away towards the bounded infinity, and in and
  between them all was the vast power of which they were but gleaming movement
  momently seen. Between them, as into that vast, received and to be
  strengthened, he sank to sleep. In the last second of mingling knowledge and
  dream he had a vision of a wide desolate plain, across which, coming swiftly
  towards him, ran a tall, young, uncouth, and violent figure, holding in a
  hand stretched high above his head what, even at that distance which was yet
  no distance, was known for a curiously tinted and involuted shell. It was
  running at great speed, and crying out as it came, crying in a great voice,
  "A god, yea, many gods," and the dreamer suddenly recognized that runner and
  knew it for the passionate youth of Wordsworth, coming in his own dream of
  saving poetry from a world's destruction, and crying out in his own divine
  voice across lands and waters how the shell was poetry and uttered voices,
  "voices more than all the winds, with power"; and the winds awoke in all the
  quarters of the vast heavens under which the intense young visionary ran, and
  roared down towards him and into the shell he was stretching out towards
  Roger, and they reverberated "power, power," and the shell sang "power," and
  the visitant with longer and wilder steps was leaping forward, and then
  darkness swept over all, and the vision lost itself in sleep.</p>

  <p>He woke the next morning, and lay for some moments wondering whether
  Muriel would be bringing the tea in soon, whether perhaps if he opened his
  eyes he would find that she had already brought it, and even that Isabel had
  already poured it out. As no-one said anything however, he opened his eyes,
  and almost immediately realized that his chance of tea was very small. At
  least, he rather doubted whether Considine's household provided early cups of
  tea, and the doubt was justified. None appeared. Roger, telling himself that
  he didn't mind, wondered for a second whether cups of tea at reasonable times
  weren't actually more important than lines of poetry, or at least whether the
  two were entirely incompatible. Nobody objected to wine, and if he had to
  choose for the rest of his life between wine and tea he had no kind of doubt
  where the choice would rest. Poetry and such things could give him all the
  wine he wanted, whereas tea was unique, "a thing of beauty and a joy for
  ever." "That's right, misquote," he said to himself crossly, and repeated the
  line correctly&mdash;"a thing of beauty is a joy for ever." Under the sudden
  spell the immediate urgency of tea faded. It was silly to want tea so much
  when he had that power attending him. He said it again, slowly, and, much
  consoled, got up.</p>

  <p>Baths apparently Considine provided; he dressed and, hoping he was doing
  the right thing&mdash;it was close on nine&mdash;went downstairs. In the hall
  he found Mottreux, Caithness, and two or three more of Considine's friends,
  the young Vereker among them. The hall struck him as being very cold, perhaps
  because the front door was wide open, and a rather helpless November sun was
  doing the best it could with a morning mist that lay about the house. He said
  almost as much to Vereker&mdash;Mottreux and Caithness were conducting a
  stilted conversation upon, so far as he could hear, their various visits to
  America&mdash;and Vereker answered that the door should be shut if he liked.
  "We don't notice the cold," he said.</p>

  <p>"Don't you, indeed?" Roger said, feeling that it was like Vereker's cheek.
  He was a younger man&mdash;he was apparently a younger man. Looks were
  nothing to go by; Considine himself was enough to go by, and at that his
  momentary irritation passed and he said sincerely: "Don't you?"</p>

  <p>"The body, after all, ought to be able to manage that," Vereker said, "to
  adjust itself, I mean, to whatever temperature it's in and enjoy it; that's
  why it's the delicate thing it is."</p>

  <p>Roger said: "And if you shut the door and turned on a furnace suddenly
  &mdash;then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, then," Vereker said laughing. "All this wrapping up and unwrapping
  &mdash;it's so unnecessary. To do without food, that does take longer. But
  it's the same principle. Here's Nigel."</p>

  <p>It was by the single Christian name (or the name which he had recovered
  from the misguided habits of the Christian church), Roger found, that his
  followers generally referred to him, partly in love, partly in submission,
  partly in mere recognition of his own unique quality, though they carried
  themselves to him with all the behaviour of respect possible.</p>

  <p>He came in now from the drive with a general word of greeting for his own
  people, and particular salutations for Roger and Caithness, to the former
  already intimate, to the latter courteous but distant, as if to some hostile
  ambassador. After the greetings he said generally: "We shall have news
  to-day. I've felt it already."</p>

  <p>"A premonition?" Caithness asked politely.</p>

  <p>"Why do you despise premonitions?" Considine answered. "Let's go to
  breakfast, shall we? Of course," he went on, as they sat down, "if you mean
  the stupid blur of untrained sensation, that is, as it sounds, negligible.
  But if you can feel a country in its air can't you feel its people too? All
  last night I heard and felt them, the voices of the great towns and the small
  villages, the talk and the doubt and the terror. Early this morning I felt it
  all gathering into one, the solitary thoughts of the peasants and the
  determination of the financiers; it swayed one way and another as it came to
  me, it veered and shifted as winds do, but it blew against my spirit at last
  as the wind on my face, and I smelt the news that went on it. Suydler will
  give way."</p>

  <p>"Can you feel a whole nation?" Roger cried.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Considine asked, almost gaily. "Didn't you feel the crowd round
  your gate when you saved the king? can't you, even in darkness, feel the
  passion of a crowd? And do you think it isn't possible for me to feel the
  purpose of a wider, less certain crowd? I can feel England as you can feel
  English verse. And they'll yield; they'll talk of peace."</p>

  <p>"It's less possible than for you to hear them," the priest said. "They
  won't yield so easily." Roger heard the hostility of his voice, and
  remembered that to Caithness much more than to him, the figure which sat at
  the head of the table, breaking a thin piece of toast, was indeed the High
  Executive of Africa, by whose will the Christian missions had been massacred
  &mdash;priests and converts alike, going down before the rifles of their
  enemies. The thought shook him; lost in his own concern with what Sir Bernard
  mocked and he adored as the exalted imagination, he had forgotten of what the
  executive imagination was capable. It was not only debonair but ruthless. It
  had spared London, but rather from convenience and scorn, from the grace of
  its superior power, than from any more tender sentiment. He remembered,
  without any immediate connexion, that it was Wordsworth&mdash;the Wordsworth
  of his dream&mdash;who had exulted over the defeat of the English
  armies&mdash;certainly he had called it a truth most painful to record, but
  Roger, looking at Considine, excused Wordsworth. It was, certainly it was, a
  painful truth, but undeniably a truth, if any of the whole mad dream were
  true, that this was no matter of chat and comfort but of anguish and ecstasy.
  The quiet house had lulled him, as the sound of the sea in which men are at
  that moment drowning, and drowned men are furnishing food for shellfish,
  lulls the sleepy holiday-maker after food. Some other cold than November's
  touched Roger; he tried to think, and Wordsworth ran through him again,
  crying "Yea, Carnage is Thy daughter." Carnage... carnage... the High
  Executive was presiding over a changing world, and he who was following that
  summons was accepting the blood shed for that change. He was accepting blood,
  as all men do by living. But he knew it. He leaned back from the half-eaten
  breakfast. Considine was speaking.</p>

  <p>"I don't say the English are frightened," he said, "they desire what they
  think rightness for Africa; also they do not willingly oppose ideas; also
  they&mdash;or some of them&mdash;desire wealth. They are divided, and Suydler
  will play for the rich. I can satisfy even the rich; I can buy them out. The
  Church fortunately has refused the secular arm."</p>

  <p>"Do you mock at it then?" Caithness demanded, he also having ceased to
  eat.</p>

  <p>"It's more purely Christian than ever before," the other answered; "its
  nature is in complete defeat; there and there only it thrives. Your wife was
  right, Ingram; that's the choice between defeat and victory. But I've chosen
  victory and I have it. Will you eat no more? Then," he stood up, "you shall
  come with me, Ingram; for I've a visit to make. Mr. Caithness may go to his
  penitent if he chooses, or make his meditations anywhere about the house or
  the grounds. Presently I'll come to the king. Vereker, do you relieve the
  wireless man. Mottreux, will you be about in case the captain comes?"</p>

  <p>They saluted and rose to their feet, as, taking Roger by the arm, he left
  the room. They went by corridors and stairs to the left wing of the house
  stretched backwards towards the sea, corresponding to another wing on the
  right. Between the two ran a verandah, a wide lawn, and a terrace, from which
  steps led down to a lower terrace, and so on to the edge of the cliffs. And
  as they went the young man felt everywhere something of that sense of
  distance which he had experienced in the hall on the previous night&mdash;a
  distance in which all near things existed in a peculiar natural order. The
  house might have been one of those mythical buildings which in various
  legends have been lifted from the earth by music, as Troy rose to Apollo's
  harping or Pandemonium like an exhalation with the sound of dulcet
  symphonies.</p>

  <p>There were no pictures, so far as he could see; instead, the walls were
  covered with soft hangings, of different colours, but each colour richer than
  ever he had seen it before. Here and there these deep tapestries were worked
  with shapes, mostly, so far as he could discern, symmetrical designs, though
  occasionally a human or non-human figure showed&mdash;a man or a winged
  monster or even a small complex city thick with houses and crowds. But Roger
  could not see them very well and he was not allowed to pause to examine them.
  Considine walked on, humming to himself, and again Roger recollected with a
  curious shock that this mature easy form, moving so lightly and gaily beside
  him, was the High Executive of African ecstasies. Suddenly he recognized the
  words into which Considine had changed his humming and exclaimed, almost
  stopping&mdash;"But that's Shakespeare! "</p>

  <p>"&mdash;shall I live now Under the blossom that hangs on the bough,</p>

  <p>"Yes," Considine answered. "D'you think Shakespeare didn't know something
  of it? Yet you must have lectured on the Tempest."</p>

  <p>"If you mean that Shakespeare believed in the Second Evolution of Man
  &mdash;" Roger rather desperately began.</p>

  <p>"He imagined its nature," Considine answered. "Think of it&mdash;and read
  Ariel's songs. Not that you'll understand them yet. Nor do I. Perhaps no-one
  will&mdash;properly&mdash;until after the conquest of death. He is your
  greatest poet because none but he has so greatly lived and died and lived in
  his verse. 'On the bat's back'&mdash;that's the purity of being. He imagined
  it. But here"&mdash;he paused at the door of a room, and his voice became
  graver&mdash;"is the physical experiment."</p>

  <p>He opened it and they went in. It was a large high room, and there moved
  in it continually a little tender breeze, as of spring, though there were no
  windows, or, if there were, they were hidden behind the pale yellow hangings
  which here also hid the walls. They shook, ever so faintly, in the movement
  of the air, and it seemed to Roger for a few moments as if everywhere great
  fields of daffodils trembled in that gentle wind. The vague suggestion
  passed, and left in its stead a thought of a universal sun shedding a golden
  presence through clear air, and then that again vanished, and he knew they
  were only wonderfully wrought hangings, and some beautiful light diffused
  itself over them. In the middle of the room there was a low divan, on which
  lay a motionless figure. In one corner was a chair on which a man sat, who,
  as they paused in the entrance, rose and came over to them. Otherwise the
  room was bare.</p>

  <p>Roger looked again at the motionless figure on the divan, gazing at it in
  a sudden recollection. He knew the face, he had seen it rapt into an ardent
  intention, offering itself to death and to the High Executive of death. He
  turned sharply to Considine. "But it's Nielsen," he said.</p>

  <p>Considine nodded, and said to the watcher of the dead, "There's no
  news?"</p>

  <p>"None, sir," the man said. "He hasn't stirred or breathed."</p>

  <p>"It's seven days," Considine said absently, and walked across the room to
  the couch where the dead man lay. Roger followed him, his heart beating more
  quickly than usual. What&mdash;what was expected, here and now?</p>

  <p>Considine seemed to feel the unspoken question. He said, still looking at
  Nielsen: "We're waiting for the result."</p>

  <p>Roger said: "You're waiting for him to live?"</p>

  <p>"If it may be," Considine answered. "He was a strong spirit." He knelt
  down by the couch and looked intently into the dead man's eyes. Roger waited,
  growing more troubled every moment with terrible expectation. This man had
  intended passionately to succeed in his unpreluded task; he had meant to
  live. Could so high and strong a purpose break laws which only gods and sons
  of gods had suspended in the past? Lazarus, the tale ran, had been drawn back
  from death by supernatural grace, but was it also&mdash;was it only&mdash;in
  the power of natural man by natural laws to conquer death? Was the old
  symbolism of the mysteries true in its reversal? was the supernatural itself
  but a visionary exhalation of the natural, and could it hold nothing but what
  the natural held? As he stood gazing a shock went through him, for it seemed
  to him that a quiver passed over the dead man's face. Considine stiffened
  where he knelt, and threw out a hand to beckon the third watcher who ran
  quietly and silently to the other side of the couch. He also knelt, and
  together the two concentrated themselves on the again unchanging figure. It
  was motionless in the self-closed stillness of the dead; pallour had touched
  it, and yet a pallour which&mdash;and again the smallest quiver seemed to
  pass through the dead face. Roger thought to himself, "It's a trance, it's
  epilepsy, it's&mdash;" But Considine was there, and he did not believe
  &mdash;even in that wild rational effort to explain away a thing which hadn't
  happened and wouldn't and couldn't happen he did not believe&mdash;that
  Considine made mistakes of this kind. The man had meant to die; undoubtedly
  on that evening in Hampstead he had meant to die. This was no booby show, no
  conjurer's trick; it was man at the extreme point of his powers sending all
  those powers to the enlargement of his dominion. The master of the adepts
  kneeled there, seeking to aid the initiate through the experiment which he
  himself, called to a different duty, had not yet dared, as the Pope aided St.
  Francis on a more glorious business than his own. Roger steadied himself; if
  man could attempt this man could watch the attempt. This was his first test
  and he would not fail. He would open himself to the knowledge, to the
  experience of the sight, he would fill himself with it; who could tell but
  one day he, he himself, might lie on such a couch to await and compel such
  a... resurrection?</p>

  <p>It was&mdash;it was happening. The eyelids flickered. Considine's gaze was
  fixed on them; he was leaning forward as if to catch the first glimpse of the
  returning consciousness, to meet and hold it lest it should fail. A ripple of
  darkness or light seemed to pass down the body; in the infinitesimal
  vibration of all its hues none could tell whether it were darkness or light
  that shook it. The eyelids flickered again; Roger caught himself in the midst
  of a passionate wish that they should open; they might hold madness or
  horror; they might strike him and blast him with their power or splendour or
  ungodly terror. Or they might be gay&mdash;gay beyond all dreaming: "merrily,
  merrily shall I live..." No; he couldn't bear such piercing glee&mdash;"on a
  bat's back"&mdash;death the bat ridden and flown by a laughing joy. He
  couldn't bear it; he looked at Considine, and for a brief fraction of a
  second Considine's eyes flashed at him and away, but in that swift meeting
  Roger felt command and nourishment and burning expectation, and in its power
  he set himself again to await revelation.</p>

  <p>But for awhile it seemed as if all was done. The body was again rigid and
  there lay before the straining eyes only the awful barricade of death. Roger
  thought suddenly how absurd it was&mdash;all this abstraction and
  personification; there was no such thing as death, there were only dead men
  and dead things. Men tried to make dead men bearable, comprehensible,
  friendly, by giving to them a general name. Death as an imagined person might
  be terrifying, but he was, so imagined, human. But Death was nothing of the
  sort; Death was neither Azrael nor any other immortal shadowy being&mdash;it
  was only dead men and dead things. "Insubstantial Death is amorous"
  &mdash;even the poets pretend; no, not always&mdash;"O but to die and go we
  know not where..." and to come back.</p>

  <p>It moved. The hand extended along the couch moved, simultaneously with
  what seemed a breath. Roger strangled a cry. The hand jerked again, so tiny a
  jerk that only its force made it perceptible. Something was trying to move
  that rigid organism, and not quite succeeding. But the signs of its presence
  spasmodically showed. The nostrils quivered slightly; the lips just parted.
  The fingers twitched.</p>

  <p>Considine said: "Help him then," and at once the third man leapt into
  activity, and others who had silently entered the room behind Roger,
  unnoticed by his fascinated attention, ran softly up. He thought afterwards
  that some bell must have been rung by the other watcher when first the body
  had stirred, and that these had gathered in readiness. They were about the
  dead man; they concerned themselves busily with it; they did this and the
  other, Roger didn't very well know what, for he was trying not to hope they
  would be unsuccessful. All the time Considine hardly moved, save to put
  himself in a more convenient position for the workers; all the time his eyes
  remained fixed on those closed eyes, and his will waited for the moment when
  it could unite itself with the restored will of the dead.</p>

  <p>After so much toil and vigil they failed. What time was spent there Roger
  hardly knew. But suddenly he knew a difference in the body about which they
  stood or moved. It changed to a more dreadful pallour; a greyness crept over
  it. Beyond the knowledge even of the adept it endured withdrawal; the kingdom
  so nearly grasped fell away. The neophyte of death was swallowed up in death;
  beyond all earlier semblance, and before their eyes, he died indeed.
  Considine signed to the workers to cease; he said to them: "Look," and they
  obeyed. He said again: "Look, look as masters. Don't lose a moment; change
  this into victory within you. Death here shall be life in you; feel it,
  imagine it, draw it into yourselves; as with all experience, so with this.
  Live by it; feed on it and live."</p>

  <p>But he himself rose to his feet, and with a sign to Roger to accompany him
  went out of the room. In silence they went back to the hall, then Considine
  spoke. "Now you shall rest," he said. "It's failed this time, but we shall
  succeed yet, and you'll see it or hear of it. Meanwhile, do what you can to
  make this sight part of you and make it part of your will to immortality and
  victory. If you want food it's here. Presently I'll come to you again; we're
  hardly likely to move to-day. But now I must go to the king."</p>

  <p>He nodded and moved off, and presently Caithness, sitting in talk by the
  king's bed in an upper room, heard the door open, and looking round saw him
  in the entrance. The priest stood up abruptly and Inkamasi stirred.</p>

  <p>"How is our guest?" Considine asked. "Have you convinced him how wasteful
  vengeance is, Mr. Caithness? and therefore what folly?"</p>

  <p>Caithness said, with almost a sneer, "It's fitting for you to talk of
  folly and waste&mdash;you who spend the blood of the martyrs for your own
  foolishness. Why have you come here?"</p>

  <p>"For a better reason than you came to Hampstead not so long ago,"
  Considine answered. "It wasn't a wise night, that, for because of that the
  king must choose his future to-day. You should have kept to your pupils, Mr.
  Caithness, to the morals you understand and the dogmas that you don't. But
  you must leave us now for I must talk to the king."</p>

  <p>Caithness looked at Inkamasi. "If you want me to stay," he began but the
  other shook his head. "Go, if you will," he said; "it's best that he and I
  should understand each other. I'll remember better this time."</p>

  <p>Considine held the door for the priest, closed it, and came to the chair
  by the bed. He paused there and smiled down at Inkamasi. "Have I your
  permission to sit down, sir?" he asked, and his voice was moved with strength
  such as the king never remembered in all their strange intercourse.</p>

  <p>"Is this another insult?" he asked, restraining anger.</p>

  <p>"It isn't anything of an insult," Considine said, "and you should know it.
  Haven't I made you what you are, and could I insult the thing I've restored?
  Therefore I will have an answer&mdash;have I your permission to sit?"</p>

  <p>The king made a movement with his hand. "I think you've only fooled me,"
  he answered bitterly, "but you can play with me as you choose&mdash;only I
  know it now. Sit or stand, do what you will, I can only watch you and at
  bottom defy you."</p>

  <p>"I will not seek it," the other replied. "It has been opened once and it
  is enough. And you&mdash;are you sure that man can conquer till he has been
  wholly defeated? are you sure that he can find plenitude till he has known
  utter despair? You will not let him despair of himself, but it may be that
  only in such a complete despair he finds that which cannot despair and is
  something other than man."</p>

  <p>"There are many reasons for avoiding the work, and all religions have
  excused man," the other's voice said. "Despair if you will, and hope that
  despair may save you. Entreat the gods; I do not refuse you your prayer."</p>

  <p>"There's a submission we're slow to understand," Inkamasi cried out, "a
  place where divinity triumphed&mdash;I believe in that."</p>

  <p>"Be it so," the answer came; "but tell me then what you will do."</p>

  <p>There was a long pause before the king said: "I know there is no place for
  me upon earth."</p>

  <p>"There is place and enough for Inkamasi," Considine answered. "There is no
  place in Africa for Inkamasi the king. You best know whether there is a place
  in Europe. You know whether your friends downstairs and in London receive
  that royalty as I receive it."</p>

  <p>"They have all courtesy and good will, but they have forgotten the Crown,"
  Inkamasi said. "They do not mock me but they do not believe."</p>

  <p>"They are sons without a mother," Considine went on, "for they know
  neither the Crown nor the Republic. Royalty is a shade and Equality not yet
  born. What is the difference between these traditions to me so long as either
  is held and is a passion? But most men are empty of both. And if I must
  choose I will choose the king and not the State, for the king is flesh and
  blood and yet undying, and is a symbol of that we seek."</p>

  <p>"Am I left," Inkamasi asked, "to find my only servants in my enemies?"</p>

  <p>"It seems," Considine answered, "even so, that I and I only am the friend
  of the king."</p>

  <p>"And what will the king's friend offer the king in his superfluousness?"
  Inkamasi asked again.</p>

  <p>"I have only two things to give," Considine said; "let the royalty of the
  king choose which he will take from a believe in him. I will offer a house
  and servants and money, all that he needs, and he may live contented with his
  knowledge of his own inheritance. Or I will give the king a royal death."</p>

  <p>"There will be none to hamper you then," Inkamasi said with a sudden
  smile.</p>

  <p>"There is none to hamper me now," Considine answered gravely. "For the
  majesty of the king is in my care and on my side, and if the king choose to
  live without his majesty, though the choice is his own, he will choose to
  live in a dream. I am the keeper of the strength of royalty; what is outside
  me is Europe, and that the king knows."</p>

  <p>"Yet I thought Europe would aid me to aid my people," Inkamasi meditated
  aloud&mdash;"law and medicine and science."</p>

  <p>"They are good in their place, but the question is whether these things
  can take the place of greater," Considine answered. "But the choice is for
  the king. Only it must be to-day. Tomorrow the submarine returns to Africa,
  and there are three ways in which the king may go in her. I will have him
  taken to his people and set among them, that he may try the fates between
  himself and the man who now rules them, and who inherits royalty if Inkamasi
  dies. Or I will send him as my friend till peace is signed and he may live a
  private man wherever he chooses on the face of the earth."</p>

  <p>"And the third way?" Inkamasi asked.</p>

  <p>"He shall go clothed with royalty and death," Considine said. "I will come
  when night falls to know the king's mind."</p>

  <p>He stood up and went down on one knee, and then moved backwards to the
  door. There in silence he waited a moment, opened it, and went out.</p>

  <p>Inkamasi lay through the afternoon considering all that had been said. The
  suggestion which had been made to him not only received additional force from
  the fact that it had been presented as one among several possibilities, but
  drew its chief strength from the tendencies of his own mind. He knew very
  well that, of all those by whom he was, or was likely to be surrounded,
  Considine alone had such intense appreciation of royalty as he himself had.
  Nor did his own bitter dislike blind him to the fact that his first attempt
  upon the other had failed, and that to concentrate the rest of his life upon
  remedying that failure would be not only undignified but treasonable. The
  king might hate, but his duty was to his own kingship first and always. How
  to save and serve that must be the first thing in his mind. But for this a
  life in England among his new circle of friends seemed useless enough. He had
  a sudden vision of himself growing old, harping upon the tradition which was
  his, regarded at best as a feeble sentimental survival, at worst as a mere
  bore. All his profound romanticism rejected the prospect. But to live as
  Considine proposed would be little better. He would be pitied by himself
  instead of by others; he would dig his own pit of sentimentality instead of
  having it dug for him, but the pit would be as deep and fatal.</p>

  <p>There was a course Considine had not named, to try and forget that he was
  the king, to settle down to ordinary work, here or abroad, and submit himself
  to the idea of the Government, whatever it might be, under which he might
  find himself: accepting his dispossession simply and sincerely. And this, had
  there been no alternative, he might have done. But once that alternative had
  been suggested the colour of the thought of it tinged all his attempts to
  choose. For though the man Inkamasi might not kill himself&mdash;so his creed
  taught&mdash;yet the king had a duty to his kingship. So far as might be, it
  must never be surrendered; and here was a way by which it might be
  surrendered in a beauty and greatness equal to its own. Examining himself for
  the last time, Inkamasi knew that in turning to Europe he had desired Europe
  for the sake of Africa; that he had studied logic and medicine and law for
  the sake of the king and his people, and that the king might the better
  benefit and govern and be one with his people. He did not care for the high
  abstractions of thought; when he talked of them it was when he took his ease
  in his private circle and amused himself as other kings had amused themselves
  with jest or hunt or song. And now, the child of unknown things, he set his
  face to go up to Jerusalem, that the king's crown might be properly received
  by the unvestmenting hands of Death. Peace entered in on him and he lay
  looking out of the window, watching the November twilight gather, and uniting
  within himself, not in such a twilight but in a more wonderful union of
  opposites, the day of his own individual being and the mysterious night of
  his holy and awful office.</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chap12"
     id="chap12">XII.</a> &mdash; THE JEWELS OF MESSIAS</h2>

  <p class="first">For some time after Considine had left him Roger did
  nothing. He sat on the verandah and looked out over the grass lawn and the
  terrace at the sea which lay beyond. And he thought to himself that never in
  his life had he felt so much, so idiotically, like a baby as he did now.
  Apart from that recurrent thought he couldn't think. "It's the shock," he
  said, half-aloud from time to time, but without convincing himself of
  anything whatsoever, without indeed particularly wanting to convince
  himself.</p>

  <p>A movement or two of a dead hand, of the hand of a man whom even Considine
  had now abandoned. It had failed, but it had come very near to succeeding.
  Roger&mdash;product of at least a semi-culture of education and intellect
  &mdash;sat there and felt that culture and education and intellect had all
  vanished together, all but the very simplest intellect. Even his passion for
  literature had disappeared; he simply wasn't up to it&mdash;he had no more
  wish or capacity for Milton or Shakespeare than a small child, who might
  laugh if some of the lines were mouthed at him but would be lost and
  vacant-eyed if anyone tried to explain them or quoted them seriously. That
  dead hand moving had abolished the whole edifice of his mind; he sat and
  stared at the sea. In London things had been different; he had been thrilled
  and romanticised. In London there was no sea, and no golden-hung rooms with a
  couch on which a dead man lay. In London these things didn't happen. He had
  heard and believed, but here belief was abolished; he was confronted with the
  simple fact. It had to be accepted, and its acceptance was what reduced him
  to a state of infancy.</p>

  <p>The sea&mdash;he couldn't look at the shore from where he sat; only at the
  terrace and the sea beyond&mdash;the sea was different. He wondered, vaguely,
  whether it was Africa, or whether both sea and Africa were names for
  something else, a full power, an irresistible mass: irresistible if it moved,
  but then it didn't move. Or hadn't. Hadn't was a better word, because it
  might. All that mass of waters might gather itself up and surge forward
  &mdash;surge or creep, swiftly or slowly, anyhow irresistible. But he,
  sitting there, with the memory of that dead hand jerking&mdash;as if a sudden
  wave had flopped forward out of the sea over the green lawn, and then
  retreated again, and the whole vast mass had swung silent and removed once
  more. If the mass followed after a while, followed the wave? He would live in
  it, he would be changed so as to breathe and bear it; he would see what other
  inhabitants peopled it&mdash;there might be one chief thing, a fish of sorts,
  a swift phosphorescent fish which was called Considine on earth before the
  sea came. Or if the sea were merely a flat plain for something else to slide
  over, a huge Africa in the shape he knew from maps sliding over the
  water&mdash;only of course not sliding, but marching, millions on millions of
  black manikins, so small, so very small, but so many, marching forward, yet
  keeping that mapped shape, and he would be just their size and be marching
  with them&mdash;left, right; left, right. Whether they were alive or dead he
  couldn't say; the fellow who was marching either opposite him or alongside
  him&mdash;it wasn't clear which&mdash;kept quivering and jerking his hand.
  Hosts of them&mdash;Lord of hosts; he had known the Lord of hosts when he was
  called Considine, and rode on a bat's back; these were the bats. Why was he
  here among this crowd of bats with negro faces that rose out of that ocean,
  now throbbing free from the ties which had so long held it? And all the bats
  were singing&mdash;"Fathom five, fathom five; rich and strange." There they
  were, all coming on; he himself had called them and they were coming.</p>

  <p>He heard, but did not notice, a step beside him. Then a voice he
  half-recognized said: "Here you are!" It was Caithness's voice, and with the
  recognition Roger's trance broke. He shifted, looked round, realized that he
  was cold, stood up, stamped once or twice, and said: "Yes, here I am. But
  don't," he added, as his mind came more to itself, "ask me where."</p>

  <p>"It's a strange place," Caithness said. "He must have many of them,
  scattered about. Near London, for the airships to land. How's he kept himself
  hidden all these years?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose," Roger said flippantly, "the exalted imagination suggested it.
  Shakespeare was a good business man."</p>

  <p>He found a certain relief in talking to the priest, however different
  their views of Considine, as an ordinary Christian might find it easier to
  talk to an atheist than to a saint. It wouldn't last, but just for a little
  it was pleasant and easy.</p>

  <p>But Caithness, not having gone so far, was not so desirous of reaction. He
  said, looking gloomily at the young man: "I don't know what you find in him.
  Where did he take you?"</p>

  <p>Roger looked out to sea again, and half-unconsciously said, "There." The
  sea should give up its dead, out of the sea of universal shipwreck the dead
  sailors of humanity should rise again, their bodies purified by the salt of
  that ocean, running up to a land which perhaps then they would feel and know
  for the first time in its full perfection: matter made purely sensitive to
  matter, and all the secrets of the passion of life revealed. Who could tell
  what wonders waited then, when emotion was full and strong and sufficient, no
  longer greedy and grasping, when the senses could take in colour and essence
  and respond to all the delicate vibrations which now their clumsy dullness
  missed, when deprivation itself should be an intense means of experiencing
  both the deprived self and the thing of which it was deprived, when&mdash;O
  when space and time were no more hindrances, when (for all one could tell)
  the body itself might multiply itself, as certain magicians had been said to
  do, and truly be here and there at once, or&mdash;"Come then," he prayed, but
  did not know to whom, "master of life, come quickly."</p>

  <p>"It's cold out here," he heard Caithness say abruptly, "let's go in. Have
  you seen Rosenberg?"</p>

  <p>Roger, as he half-reluctantly turned to follow, thought of the Jew with a
  shock. "No," he said. "I'd forgotten him."</p>

  <p>"I wonder what this man means to do with him," the priest went on.
  "Colonel Mottreux has brought the famous jewels." There was a light sneer in
  his voice, and Roger knew that the desire and delight of the late Simon
  Rosenberg was utterly incomprehensible to Caithness. Yet it should not have
  been so, he thought, for was there after all so much difference between minds
  that longed to see their own natures made manifest, the one in converted and
  beautiful souls adorned with virtues, the other in a chosen and beautiful
  body adorned with jewels? Certainly Caithness thought it was for the good of
  the souls, but no doubt Rosenberg thought that his wife enjoyed wearing the
  jewels, and very likely she did. Certainly, also, on Caithness's hypothesis,
  the souls were likely to enjoy their kind of beauty for a much longer time
  than Mrs. Rosenberg, even if she hadn't died when she did, could possibly
  have enjoyed hers. So that Caithness was actually likely to get more
  satisfaction out of his externalised desire than Rosenberg. But for that you
  must have a supernatural hypothesis, and the fact that a supernatural
  hypothesis had quite definite advantages didn't make it true. The fact that
  man wanted a thing very much never did make it true&mdash;or the body that
  lay within would now perhaps be walking in the house and even coming up to
  speak to him... He shuddered involuntarily, no more in servile than in holy
  fear, and to escape from that hovering awe said: "Have they been given to
  Rosenberg yet?"</p>

  <p>"No," Caithness answered. "I don't fancy Considine's all that anxious to
  part with them."</p>

  <p>Roger looked at him in surprise. They had come into the room where they
  had breakfasted, from which doors of an exquisitely clear glass led on to the
  lawn in front of the house. The priest walked across and looked out. Roger
  said, rather coldly: "That's utterly unnecessary. Do you hate him so
  much?"</p>

  <p>"I don't hate him," Caithness said, "except that he's set himself against
  God, like Antichrist which is to come."</p>

  <p>"O don't be silly," Roger said crossly. "Antichrist indeed! What on earth
  has he done to make you think he'd steal a lot of jewels?"</p>

  <p>"What's he done," the priest said over his shoulder, "to make you think he
  wouldn't? Hasn't he put many men to death and stolen the minds of others? If
  he wants the jewels he'll take them."</p>

  <p>"But he won't want them," Roger exclaimed; "that's the whole point. I may,
  or for all I know Mottreux may, but he's no more likely to want them than you
  are, to be fair to you," he added with a half-humorous admission of
  Caithness's own integrity.</p>

  <p>The door opened, and Mottreux and Rosenberg came into the room. The old
  Jew looked at them for a moment and then went across to the other side of the
  room and sat down. Mottreux paused by the door, seeming not to have expected
  to find the other two there. His dark and hungry eyes rested on Roger and
  moving towards him, he said in a low voice, "I hear Nielsen has really
  died."</p>

  <p>The sentence itself seemed fatal; in its note of hopelessness it conveyed
  death. Roger, not finding words to answer, nodded. Mottreux walked slowly
  over to Rosenberg, to whom he began to talk in a low voice. Caithness, after
  a minute or so, went over to join them. Roger considered doing the same thing
  and decided not to. He didn't want to chat, and he couldn't see what, besides
  mere chat, Mottreux and Rosenberg could have to say to each other. Mottreux,
  he remembered, was supposed to be waiting for the captain, whoever the
  captain was. His mind went back to the sea, and he thought suddenly of
  submarines. Perhaps that was what Considine had meant by "moving." It was all
  such a mad mixture, purple rhetoric and precise realism, doctrines of
  transmutation and babble about African witch-doctors and airships and
  submarines. He wondered what Isabel was doing, and whether perhaps after all
  he would have been wiser to stop... but he couldn't, he couldn't; the thing
  that for years had torn at his heart and brain had to be satisfied. He and
  she had alike to choose necessity. But if his necessity could have lain with
  hers... And Sir Bernard&mdash;what would he have made of this house where
  servants of impossibilities talked by the hearth, and he himself waited for
  the next moment of explication? Staring at his toes, Roger thought that that
  was all he did seem to be doing&mdash;waiting. Was he wasting his time? had
  Considine meant him to be doing something all this while? He ought to have
  been working, to have imagined intensely the ...</p>

  <p>Considine was in the room. To Roger's preoccupied mind he might have
  materialized out of the air, but apparently he hadn't. He said, "There's no
  message yet. Mottreux, I'll dictate the alternative dispositions for the
  generals, if you will come. These gentlemen will be able to amuse themselves
  a little." He came over to Roger and looked into his eyes, then he said,
  smiling, "You've been running after your fancies, Ingram; you've not been
  driving even their faint power through you. Do you think it will happen by
  itself?"</p>

  <p>"I know," Roger said. "I was thinking so&mdash;'They heard and were
  abashed and up they sprang.'"</p>

  <p>"So," Considine answered. "Turn on to that all your heart; and then turn
  that on to yourself. Don't let yourself grow too tired, but never quite let
  go. We'll talk again soon." He turned.</p>

  <p>"Mottreux?"</p>

  <p>The other joined him and they went across the hall into another room,
  where a case stood on the table. "There are Rosenberg's jewels," Considine
  said. "We'll give them to him presently; let's look at them once." He took a
  key from his pocket and opened the case as he spoke, and then poured upon the
  table a glowing heap of jewels. They shone and sparkled; they gleamed and
  glinted&mdash;some set, many unset; stones of every kind revealing the life
  of stone, colour revealing the power of colour. Considine stood and looked at
  them, and if Roger had been there he might have thought that the heap of
  jewels and the human figure reflected each other, and that intense life leapt
  and re-leapt between them. The man's form seemed to hold in itself depths of
  mysterious tint; so clear and mysterious was the corporeal presence,
  disciplined and purged and nourished through many decades by supreme passion.
  The deep smile broke out again as he gazed, exulting in the joy of beauty,
  absorbing it, and almost visibly transmuting it into his own dominating
  awareness of it. He stretched out his hand and picked up one or two, and a
  whole diadem of splendour faded by the unparalleled delicacy of consummated
  mortality which held it. He laid them down and laughed softly as he did so,
  humming again to himself, "'Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.' All
  this," he added aloud, "but one blossom under which we live for a moment. Yet
  they are almost worthy Messias."</p>

  <p>But Mottreux leant nearer them, and turned an agonized face towards his
  master.</p>

  <p>"You are giving them back," he whispered. "You won't surely?" His hands
  trembled forward towards the heap. "It's... it's life," he said grasping, and
  fell on his knees by the table.</p>

  <p>Considine looking down at him laid a hand on his shoulder. "Do you feel
  them so?" he asked, and felt the answer shudder through the kneeling man's
  limbs as he turned his face upwards.</p>

  <p>"Don't give them back," he moaned, "don't shut them up! they're breath,
  they're everything, they're me! Don't keep them in a box&mdash;unless I keep
  it! Give them to me! You don't want them. You don't care for their life,
  you've got all the life you want. I tell you they're like woman, they're more
  than woman: who ever saw a woman quiver like that? quiver and be so still? I
  want to grow to them, don't take them away. I haven't asked you much, I'll do
  anything you want. Tell me someone to kill. I'll give you his blood for these
  stones. I'll give you my blood for them&mdash;only let me love them a little,
  let me hold them while you kill me. O they'll kill me themselves, they're so
  merciless. Can't you feel them? Can't you feel them melting into you? Or is
  it that I'm melting? I... I..." His voice choked with his passion and
  stopped.</p>

  <p>Considine leant over him. "Now, Mottreux, now," he said, "remember the end
  of the experiment. Be master of love, be master of death! Change delight that
  is agony into that agony that is delight. Not for possession, not for
  yourself, achieve and transmute desire." Standing behind him he pressed his
  hands on the other's shoulders, till Mottreux crouched under the weight. "Not
  for a dream like the poor wretch who died but for the power and glory of
  life, for the marriage of death and love, and for the dominion that comes
  from them. Mottreux, Mottreux! you that live to beauty, die to beauty! "</p>

  <p>But Mottreux, as the pressure relaxed, sprang to his feet and leant half
  over the table with a snarl.</p>

  <p>"They are my life," he said, "who touches them touches me."</p>

  <p>"Remember those who have failed on the threshold of achievement,"
  Considine answered. "You seek a deeper thing than these stones hold-you seek
  the mastery of death. Destroy them then, and enter farther into the chambers
  of death. But if you touch one to keep or to destroy, for greed or desire, or
  lest others should gain, you are lost, Mottreux. If you possess you are
  lost."</p>

  <p>"It's not true," the tormented creature exclaimed, and went on hurriedly.
  "Don't you possess&mdash;money and houses and lands? Don't you say that a man
  can grow by the ecstasy which the things he possesses give him? a miser by
  gold, and a lover by woman?"</p>

  <p>"If the chance of the world throws things into his hands, let him take
  them," Considine answered; "if it tears them from him let him forsake them.
  It need make no difference to him. As for me, I use what I have for the
  purpose of the schools. But if it were all caught away to-morrow what change
  would it cause in me? The man who prefers possession to abandonment is lost.
  You've come far, Mottreux, by experience of hunting and war; you've grown and
  thriven on that rapture. Thrive now on this; all this pain is but your power
  seeking its proper end."</p>

  <p>"Nielsen sought it and he's dead," the other cried out. "It can't be done;
  it's wilder than all dreams. Haven't others in Uganda and Nigeria tried it
  and failed?"</p>

  <p>"And Jersey and London," Considine said. "More than you'll ever know. Will
  you disbelieve because a million have failed? One shall succeed and others
  and their children shall have it in their blood. Leave Nielsen; leave all.
  Leave this."</p>

  <p>He moved to face the other and meeting his eyes held them with so strong a
  power that Mottreux turned his own eyes away.</p>

  <p>But he moaned desperately, "I can't&mdash;not this. Anything else
  &mdash;not this."</p>

  <p>"Are you a fool?" Considine said, "it's always anything else, and it's
  always this. How will you die indeed if you daren't die now? There's not a
  man in all this world who doesn't have to relinquish; it's given to us to do
  it willingly and make our profit from it. Strike and live in the wound."</p>

  <p>"But you won't give them back?" Mottreux cried. "At least keep them
  yourself; don't give them away."</p>

  <p>"Certainly I shall give them," Considine answered, "for it's better that
  they should serve a myth than a man, and if I were to keep them now I should
  take the kingdom of man away from you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>As he paused, there was a sharp knock at the door. Considine thrust
  Mottreux round so that the tormented face was hidden, and cried a word over
  his shoulder. Vereker came into the room. "Sir, the message is here," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"I'll come," Considine answered, and as Vereker went out he gathered the
  jewels in his hands and poured them back into the case. Mottreux leaned
  against the table; he could not speak; he gazed as the traveller whose camel
  has just fallen might stare after the vanished mirage or as a young boy might
  when the beloved of his heart gives her sacred hand into another's charge.
  Considine locked the case, dropped it back on the table, slipped his hand
  into Mottreux's arm, and drew him from the room.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the three guests, centrifugally repulsed by the very ardour
  which united them, remained for some time in the one room. They were aware,
  as they sat there, of increased movement in the house; new voices came to
  them, and the occasional sound of cars arriving or departing. The expectancy
  of crisis was heightened, and Caithness who was the most open to external
  impressions, was the first to give way. Ezekiel still sat, lost in meditation
  on antique words, by the fireplace; brooding over the manner in which the
  High and Holy One had in the secret story of Joseph or of David, in the
  hidden sayings of Ruth or Esther, signified the return of Israel to His
  pardon. Roger, concerned with other texts, sought to bring into his memory of
  them the emotion awakened by the sight he had endured; he attempted to
  realize the august periods of time and space which exist in and are measured
  by the mastery of poetry. Lines came to him from a distance, but it was not
  exterior distance; it was himself whose leagues lay between himself and their
  origin, and all that space of self was no longer void but tremulous with
  unapprehended life. He had always, it seemed, been too close to them; he
  understood how small his feeble little understanding was. They rose from an
  abyss&mdash;they had always said so&mdash;"the mind's abyss"&mdash;"that
  awful Power rose from the mind's abyss"&mdash;his mind's abyss-it would lead
  him into the abyss&mdash;it would define the abyss for him &mdash;the powers
  that inhabited it were his powers&mdash;O how little, how little, did the
  most ardent reader know what mysteries lay in "the mystery of words"</p>

  <p>There darkness makes abode, and all the host Of shadowy things work
  endless changes; there as in a mansion like their proper home he wondered for
  a fantastic instant if it were this house which was indeed their home.</p>

  <p>But Caithness's mind was not on such exploration. The nature of his
  intellect and the necessities of his office had directed his attention always
  not towards things in themselves but towards things in immediate action. He
  defined men by morality; it was perhaps inevitable that he should define God
  in the same way. The most difficult texts for him to explain away had always
  been those which obscurely hint at the origin of evil itself in the
  Unnameable, "the lying spirit" of Zedekiah, the dark question of Isaiah
  &mdash;"Shall there be evil in the city and I the Lord have not done it?" He
  was always trying to avoid Dualism, and falling back on the statement that
  Omniscience might permit what it did not and could not originate, yet other
  origin (outside Omniscience) there be none. It is true he always added that
  it was a mystery, but a safer line was to insist that good and evil were
  facts, whatever the explanation was. True as this might be, it had the slight
  disadvantage that he saw everything in terms of his own good and evil, and so
  imperceptibly to resist evil rather than to follow good became the chief
  concern of his exhortations. So perhaps the great energies are wasted; so
  perhaps even evil is not sufficiently resisted. His mind now was full of
  Inkamasi's defiance; his own pet miracle seemed to justify him, and he
  thought of himself in relation to the king as the chief champion of
  Christendom against Antichrist. It was also a little annoying to be treated
  as if he were in an elementary stage of his own religion, and a personal
  rancour unconsciously reinforced the devotion of his soul to its
  hypothesis.</p>

  <p>He went out of the room, intending to go back to the Zulu, and saw that
  the house was indeed more populated than it had been. He saw several new
  faces in the hall; there were two or three officers in a strange dark-green
  uniform. One man had a face like an Arab; there was another who might be an
  Italian. He heard a voice say "Feisul Pasha," and saw a third cross the hall
  from the front door. He turned abruptly, ran up the stairs, and on the first
  landing met Mottreux.</p>

  <p>The colonel was coming slowly along; his face was pale and wrenched. As he
  saw Caithness he paused, and the priest instinctively stood still also. So
  for a few moments they waited, duellists uncertain of what was to come.
  Mottreux said at last&mdash;as if it were not what he meant: "You're going to
  the king?"</p>

  <p>"And if so?" Caithness asked. Something in Mottreux's voice puzzled him.
  It seemed to wish to delay him; it hesitated; he could have believed that it
  inquired about something which had not been mentioned.</p>

  <p>Mottreux said abruptly: "I suppose you think we're all wrong?"</p>

  <p>Caithness very shortly said he did, but the other did not step away. He
  added: "I suppose you&mdash;want us to fail?"</p>

  <p>Caithness, again shortly, agreed. Mottreux came close up to him, looked
  round, began to whisper, and was suddenly taken by a spasmodic shudder. He
  caught the priest's arm and then let it go sharply, as if he had touched
  something hateful. He said in a low voice, "If one could..." and his voice
  died away.</p>

  <p>In the tone of a director of souls Caithness said: "Could?"</p>

  <p>"If one could&mdash;make peace," Mottreux whispered. "Would there
  &mdash;would there be room for a man who could make peace?"</p>

  <p>He was close up against Caithness, and the priest, feeling his agitation
  and shaken by it, dropped his voice to an equal whisper, "But how
  can&mdash;we shan't take his terms."</p>

  <p>Mottreux said, "But without his terms?"</p>

  <p>"How can you make peace without him?" Caithness asked.</p>

  <p>"He isn't human," Mottreux jerked out. "If... if one caught a mad
  ape..."</p>

  <p>The truth flashed into Caithness's mind&mdash;the possible truth, and the
  possibility possessed him. In this strange house, amid strange inhabitants,
  had come the strangest whisper of all, a whisper of antagonism in the very
  heart of the enemy. His brain ran before him, forgetting everything but this
  impossible chance. He leaned a little closer yet, and said, "If you can't
  cage it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mottreux answered, "You know the Prime Minister?"</p>

  <p>"My friend does," Caithness said.</p>

  <p>"If the ape were chained and caged?" Mottreux said. "If he were quite
  helpless?"</p>

  <p>"If one were very sure," Caithness said, and dared not stop to ask what he
  meant.</p>

  <p>There was an almost breathless stillness, then Mottreux said again, "He's
  not human; he's monstrous. He robs us of everything&mdash;of our souls! "</p>

  <p>"He robs you of everything, of your souls most of all," the priest said,
  not knowing after what mingled mass of colour the other's spirit panted.
  Mottreux's face took on a sudden cunning, as if he plunged that secret deeper
  into his heart and veiled it there more securely. He said, "If anything
  should happen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It would be a fortunate thing for the world," the priest said. "But," he
  added, "that's in the hands of God."</p>

  <p>"Aye&mdash;God," the other answered. "But he behaves like God. If anything
  happened, would your friend&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Caithness paused. He thought of Sir Bernard, and ironically with the
  thought there came the memory of his own visit to London, of his talk with
  the Archbishop, of his insistence that the Church must not use the secular
  arm. Yes&mdash;but he wasn't then in this house, so close against this mad
  dreamer; he hadn't seen the African horde dancing round the upright figure
  whom it worshipped, he hadn't heard of this blasphemy of the conquest of
  death. Never as an ordinary rule&mdash;never but when&mdash;never but, for
  this once, now&mdash;never afterwards, for this couldn't happen twice. And
  even now it wasn't he or his friends or the Church; it was the man's own
  follower. And the Zulu Christian would be saved from captivity, and Roger
  from delusion, and men from a lie. Now, just now&mdash;if this whisperer so
  close to him chose ...</p>

  <p>"Anyone who saved England," he said, "anyone who did would be a friend to
  all men."</p>

  <p>"You'd see that he was safe?" Mottreux urged. "You'd speak to Suydler?
  you'd keep me secret till it was right to have it known?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," Caithness answered. "You should be with me till all was
  agreed; it would be easy..."</p>

  <p>There was a voice in the hall below; a door opened and shut. Someone came
  to the foot of the stairs. Mottreux nodded and stepped away, breathing only
  "Be ready then. I can't tell when it may be." He disappeared down the
  staircase, and Caithness after a few moments went slowly on to join the
  king.</p><br>

  <h2><a name="chap13"
     id="chap13">XIII.</a> &mdash; THE MEETING OF THE ADEPTS</h2>

  <p class="first">It was already dark. The sea was lost, and the drive in
  front of the house. Roger was alone, for Caithness had not returned from the
  king, and Rosenberg, though it was but late afternoon, had with a few
  muttered words gone back to his own room. No-one of the others had come in.
  Roger had read a little in one or other of the books scattered about-they
  were mostly what are called the "classics" of various times and languages.
  They were all in "privately printed" editions, exquisitely done with types he
  did not recognize and bindings whose colours were strange and beautiful
  combinations. There was one volume of the fragments of Sappho, another of the
  Song of Solomon, an Aeschylus, a Gallic War, a Macbeth; there were one or two
  Chinese texts, and one or two which Roger supposed must be African&mdash;at
  least, the characters were altogether strange to him. There was a manuscript
  book, half filled with delicate mysterious writing, also in strange
  characters. He had read in some and looked at others; he had tried to search
  in them for the power which reposed there, and of which those Greek or
  English or unknown characters were sacramental symbols. And when he ceased
  and for a while half abandoned the search he was aware that he did not
  abandon it, as so often before, to return to an outer world of things
  different from the secret paths he had been following. Sometimes when he had
  been reading at home he had looked up to feel the rooms, the furniture
  &mdash;tolerable and even pleasant as it all was&mdash;in some sense alien to
  the sacred syllables. His own writing-table, comfortable and useful, blinked
  rather awkwardly at him when he returned from the visit of Satan to Eden or
  the nightingale in the embalmed darkness. But here there was no such
  difficulty or distinction; all was natural. As a result of that most
  fortunate combination of mental and visible or audible things, the tiredness
  which often seized him in those moments was absent. For it was never great
  things in their own medium which wearied him; they&mdash;he had always known
  and now more than ever knew&mdash;were strength and refreshment; it was the
  change from one medium to another, the passing from their clear darkness to
  the fog of daily experience. But here there was no need to return; all was
  one.</p>

  <p>He walked to the window, and looked out. But he could see nothing except
  the lights of a car standing in front of the door; he turned back into the
  room, and after hesitating for a minute or two went across it and out into
  the hall. There he saw a group of men, gathered round Considine. They were
  breaking up even while he glanced; each of them went off as on separate
  business. Considine stood alone. He stretched himself easily, smiled at
  Roger, and walked towards him.</p>

  <p>"All's done," he said. "They've communicated from Africa. Your people are
  in touch with mine. I knew they would begin soon."</p>

  <p>Roger, still struggling with a scepticism in political things which he had
  abandoned in spiritual, said: "It can't be possible that..."</p>

  <p>"It's certain," Considine answered. "Suydler&mdash;what can Suydler do
  against us? He won't trust himself to flog the English on, nor to cheat the
  Powers that will want to cheat him. South Africa I will leave for fifty years
  or so; at the end of that time they'll be begging to come in. Let's go
  outside, shall we?"</p>

  <p>They went out on to the verandah, and, as the coldness of the evening took
  them, veils seemed to fall away from Considine. Roger felt himself in the
  presence of maturity and power beyond his thought, perhaps something of that
  power into which he had been experimentally searching. The man by his side
  threw off the habitual disguise of years and behaviour which he wore; he
  moved like a "giant form," and though his eyes, when they rested on Roger,
  were friendly, their friendliness was tremendous and wise and, as it might
  have been, archangelic. He walked lightly, pacing the verandah, and seemed
  not to depend on the floor to support him; Roger felt clumsy and awkward
  beside him, earth and a child of earth beside earth purified, infused and
  transmuted.</p>

  <p>Considine said: "We shall go to-night. I've got one more thing to do here,
  and there's time enough for that."</p>

  <p>"You always seem to have time to spare," Roger answered.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" the other asked. "Every second is an infinity, once you can
  enter it. But man's mind sits outside its doors moaning, and leaves his
  activity to run about the world in a fever of excitement. You will leave that
  presently."</p>

  <p>"How did you set out on this?" Roger asked diffidently. The impetuous
  angry Roger of London had disappeared; he walked as a child and as a child
  referred to his adults.</p>

  <p>In the darkness Considine smiled. "This morning," he said, "a girl jilted
  a boy, and the boy said, 'Why do I suffer helplessly? This also is
  I&mdash;all this unutterable pain is I, and I grow everywhere through it into
  myself.' I could show you the street where it happened&mdash;they haven't yet
  pulled it down&mdash;where the boy said, 'If this pain were itself power..."
  So he imagined it as himself and himself as it, and because it was greater
  than himself he knew that he also was greater than himself, and as old and as
  strong as he chose. The girl's dead long ago; she was a pretty baby."</p>

  <p>"But then?" Roger asked.</p>

  <p>"Then&mdash;a little later-before noon," the voice answered, "the boy
  found another girl and loved her. But as that love spread through him he
  remembered the vastness of his pain and what had seemed to him possible
  because of it, and he asked himself whether love were not meant for something
  more than wantonness and child-bearing and the future that closes in death.
  He taught himself how this also was to charge his knowledge of what man could
  be, and he poured physical desire and mental passion into his determination
  of life. Then he was free."</p>

  <p>Roger said: "But why Africa?"</p>

  <p>"My father was a surgeon," the other answered, "though not a poor man, and
  he went on a ship, taking me with him. The ship was wrecked&mdash;it wasn't
  unusual then&mdash;but he and I were saved, and came to shore. I've told you
  that my father knew something of the old magical traditions&mdash;things I
  haven't much concerned myself with; such as are of value are natural
  properties of the developing and unstunted nature of man, and the rest are of
  no value&mdash;but by such tricks he made himself feared by the sorcerers. We
  went far into the inland before he died, and there I found that things which
  I'd discovered with pain were taught to the priestly initiates. But they held
  them secret and were afraid of them, and I knew they were for the world when
  the time should come. And now it has come."</p>

  <p>"And the end," Roger cried out in a sudden access of desperation and hope,
  "what is the end?"</p>

  <p>The other turned to confront him, but in the darkness Roger, full of
  cloudy memories and fiery prophecies, was uncertain what he faced. There had
  been in the movement something of Isabel, but it was not Isabel; he wondered
  whether it were not rather the lofty head of Milton, doctrinal yet
  mysterious, at which he was looking, but the eyes were not Milton's, for
  Milton was blind, and these eyes were shining at him in the night. It was
  rather&mdash;this figure&mdash;something that had to do with the sea the
  sound of which came to him still, the sea that had come up from its borders
  and been talking with him though he had not known it for what it was. So it
  was not eyes, it was light under the sea which he saw, and he was being swept
  away from human beings into the ocean gulfs and currents. He struck out as if
  he were swimming, but that did not ease the choking in his throat and
  nostrils nor the clamour in his ears. With all his power he drove upwards,
  and it seemed that his head broke out from the waves and beheld not very far
  off a shore on which his friends walked. He saw Sir Bernard looking
  ironically out over the waters in which he struggled, looking ironically at
  him, as if with a smile to see how the rash fool who has sailed on such a
  voyage now agonized for one plank to cling to. He saw Rosamond, her arm in
  Philip's, bending him away from the foam, and drawing him safely towards the
  highroads beyond. He saw Isabel, and her dress was drenched with spray, her
  dress and her hair, and she had stretched one firm arm towards the sea, and
  stood on the extreme edge of the land; but her eyes did not see him, and he
  could not tread water&mdash;he was whirled down again as if into the noise of
  a roaring dance, and again he choked and agonized and sprang upward through a
  thousand fathoms of water and emerged to see them again, but small, very
  small. As he gazed a tiny distant bell rang in his ears and called him
  &mdash;a bell far, far below: "ding dong bell, ding dong bell." Hark! now he
  heard it. It was not now those on the shore who neglected him; it was he who
  had to leave them on their shore. "Ding dong bell"; they were ringing for
  him, a knell and a summons at once. Because there was no other hope, he
  obeyed; he forced himself to cease from struggling, and from feet to lifted
  hands one direct line he shot downwards, down, down, to where the dead men
  lay. The noise in his ears might have been the shouting of many voices,
  crowds and armies, about their lord, or it might have been the sea uttering
  itself, its voice heard not in its own words but in a tremendous echo,
  sovereign for those who heard it, shaped into words: "Thus the Filial Godhead
  answering spake." The thunder of the speech crashed through him as he,
  assenting to it and to the sea which spoke it, dropped down through the speed
  of the depth. It was agony to let himself sink so, to release all that he
  loved, to fall through this alien element by which they walked; it was pain,
  indescribable... indescribable... what?&mdash;not pain but something else, an
  exquisiteness of pain which was, now he realized it, not pain at all but
  delight. How many there were, far away on that shore beyond him, who fancied
  themselves in pain, and, could they know it, carried all delight in their
  hearts! Man, through most of his poor ignorant years, did not truly know what
  he felt; he was so habituated to the past that he sighed when he should have
  laughed and laughed when he should have sighed. The great passions swept
  through him unrecognized till far off he saw the glory of their departure,
  and cried out, "That was!" But in rare moments he knew, and then what power
  was his! And, could a man's body be always impregnated with this salt, as his
  own was now, and infiltrated with this sea, he might always know! His
  experience would always be new, for newness was the quality of this
  everlasting and universal life. He knew delight and named it; unafraid, he
  summoned it, and it came. He rejoiced in an ecstasy that controlled itself in
  great tidal breaths. He was no longer sinking but walking on the sand at the
  great sea's bottom, only the sea was no longer there; he was himself the sea
  and he walked in the sun over the yellow sands. "Come unto these yellow
  sands." He himself&mdash;ocean calling to ocean; to other seas that danced in
  a flooding splendour. Ecstasy was no more a bewilderment; only those who had
  not known it were afraid of it, for it was man's natural life. In the stormy
  waters of the surface there was danger and death, but, for those who would
  not fly from the depths and the distances, those very depths and distances
  were found to be part of their nature. Every step that he took was delight;
  he sent out the cry of the released spirit: "Merrily, merrily shall I live
  now."</p>

  <p>Something lay on his forehead, obstructing him, as if it were a hand; he
  laboured under it. It pressed on him, or he against it, as if alien
  limitation controlled him; he stumbled in his walk because it lay over his
  eyes and blinded him. A great fear of blindness, of losing this most happy
  life, filled him. He threw up his hands to tear the obstruction away, and
  they too were caught and prisoned. He tore them loose; he flung back his
  head; he was convulsed with a spasm of agony, and he was standing in the
  darkness of a cold night under a wooden roof, and opposite him was the tall
  watchful figure of Nigel Considine.</p>

  <p>There was a long silence; then Considine said, "It may be known and
  believed, it can't be lived thus. But it can be found and lived. Let us go
  in."</p>

  <p>In the hall there were a group of some half-dozen; away from them,
  standing together, were Caithness and Rosenberg. Mottreux was moving about
  from one place to another. Roger joined his friends. Considine stood still
  and gathered their eyes and thoughts to himself; when that concentration was
  sufficient he spoke.</p>

  <p>"All's ready," he said, "and you know your offices. All of us, except
  Mottreux, leave to-night. He remains here. But there are two things yet to be
  done. Mr. Rosenberg, I present to you the jewels which your cousin left to
  you." Mottreux came forward slowly and gave him the case, which he offered to
  the Jew who took it silently. Mottreux fell back a pace or two so that he
  stood behind his master. His face was livid, and he rubbed one hand backward
  and forward over his forehead. But he stood, horribly eyeing the Jew, while
  Considine went on: "I invite you to come with me if you choose, and I will
  see that you reach Jerusalem. There you may wait in peace the coming of your
  Messias. If you choose to stay here, you shall be taken to London to-night or
  to-morrow to any place that you name."</p>

  <p>"I will do as you have said," Rosenberg answered. "The Lord shall reward
  you, and I will rest in Jerusalem."</p>

  <p>"But for us, lords and princes, my companions," Considine said, and his
  tone sank from conversational ease to direction and control, "before we take
  up again the work that is before us, there remains one ceremony to fulfil.
  Initiates of love and death, I invite you to a sacrifice of death, by virtue
  of that hope and determination which shall make you masters of death as you
  are in your degree masters of love. There is in this house another guest, a
  child of royalty and an inheritor of one of the great and passionate
  imaginations of mankind, Inkamasi the Zulu. He is not with us, but we are
  with him. Shadow though it be of the true ecstasy and fiery life into which
  we shall enter, it is yet an heritage worthy of honour. To us has been
  committed the care of these vast and antique dreams; it is ours to see, so
  far as in us lies, that those who are possessed by them are entertained
  mightily and dismissed royally. Love and poetry and royalty are adored as the
  channels whereby the passion and imagination of man's heart become revealed
  to him, and knowing his own greatness he moves to the final accomplishment,
  the ending in his own person of all the accidents of place and time. This man
  is not with us, but in an hour when, superseded in Africa and undesired in
  Europe, he looks for a throne on which to perish, it must be we who offer him
  that throne. By no compulsion and no persuasion the King Inkamasi turns to
  the throne we offer and awaits immolation there. He is driven by the might of
  his own royalty which demands of him no lesser conclusion; he is received by
  us as, beyond his purpose, a meet and acceptable sacrifice. Put away from you
  the desires of your hearts, save the one last desire. I exhort you to come
  with hands of devotion and a single heart; who knows but this very night the
  work may be accomplished and there may descend upon one of us that ecstasy
  which shall drive him into death and in death to resurrection?"</p>

  <p>Roger heard and realized what was conveyed by phrase and accent. Appalled
  by the understanding he took a half-step forward, but Caithness was before
  him. With a supernatural insolence as high as Considine's own, the priest
  cried out and confronted his enemy. "You dare not touch him," he said. "This
  man is in your care, and his blood is on your head if you hurt him. God shall
  require it of you; I charge you to let him go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Considine had paused to let him speak, but now with a gesture he stopped
  him, and as the priest panted for words the other's voice set him aside.</p>

  <p>"If that time which you and he accept and serve were at your disposal," he
  said, "I would not prevent your seeking to turn him from his assent. But it
  cannot be now. You will not encourage him to seek victory in death; and the
  king cannot fail from his royalty. What we do we do quickly. It is permitted,
  if you choose, that you shall be with him at his end; console, direct him as
  you will. But see that you do not interfere now with his and our choice, or
  you shall be taken from him. The offering which he makes and which we, with
  vaster purposes, accept is beyond the humble vision of your creed. He dies
  for the sake of his kingship; we experience his death for the sake of making
  it a part of our imaginations. Man shall conquer death, not by submitting to
  it as you teach, and not by avoiding it in a mere prolongation of life, as
  certain wise yet erring masters have taught, though this may be a necessary
  step towards conquest, but by entering into and annulling it."</p>

  <p>"Antichrist," the priest exclaimed, "is the day of your dominion
  here?"</p>

  <p>"Neither Christ nor Antichrist," the voice of the other answered him, "but
  I bring a gospel of redemption, and the ends of the world hear it: whom do
  men say that I, a son of man, am?"</p>

  <p>He flung out a hand towards the group of his servants and disciples; he
  turned his eyes upon them and they answered, Arab and Egyptian, negro and
  white: "The end of mirage, the palm in the desert," "The last of the Imams,
  the Shadow of Allah," "The lord of sorcerers and kings," "The bearer of keys,
  the interpreter of tongues," and, as the mingled voices ceased, Considine's
  own answered them: "I am all these and yet I am no more than any of you, for
  all of you shall be as I. That which I have known I have not known of myself.
  I am the child of the initiates; their servant and the servant of the mighty
  imagination which is in man. Any of you shall conclude his kingdom before me;
  purify yourselves, know, exult, and live. I call to you again, lords of the
  spirit, postulants of infinity, put away all desire but to be fulfilled in
  yourselves. The sacrifice of kingship is for the single of heart."</p>

  <p>He swept his arms upward and inward in one compelling gesture. "Come, see
  the death of a man. Come you too," he added to his guests, "if you so will.
  But if not, then remain here until we come for you again, to accompany the
  body of the King Inkamasi to the sepulchre in the ocean which awaits
  him."</p>

  <p>He went forward and his servants after him. Vereker signed to Caithness to
  precede him, and Roger accompanied the priest. Mottreux looked after them;
  then he went swiftly to Rosenberg and laid his hand on the casket.</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean to go with these to Jerusalem?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I am determined," the old man answered. "I will make haste to the city of
  our God."</p>

  <p>Mottreux turned sharply away; he went after the others.</p>

  <p>They were going to the room where that morning Roger had seen the attempt
  at revivification, but the last of the disciples did not quite catch them up.
  Very softly he went after them; when Vereker had entered the room he paused
  by the door, and as softly moved a key from within to without. Then he pulled
  the door nearly but not quite shut after him and waited.</p>

  <p>The body of Nielsen had been removed; on the low couch, supported by
  cushions, the Zulu lay. Considine genuflected as he entered, and moving to
  one side made a sign to Caithness. The priest ran forward, threw something
  round his neck, and drew a crucifix from near his heart. He kneeled by the
  couch; Inkamasi leaned his head towards him and they murmured between
  themselves. Considine, waiting, looked round, and made a sign to Roger to
  come to his side. He slipped his arm into the young man's and said: "This is
  a gift of the universe to you; deal wisely with it. Be strong, exult, and
  live."</p>

  <p>The two of them were together, a little distance from the head of the
  couch; opposite them, at a greater distance from the foot, four others had
  gathered. Mottreux was by the door with a clear space between him and the
  Zulu. So set, they waited till the speech between the priest and the king
  died; while the two yet remained in close and silent prayer Considine said in
  a low voice to the others: "Enlarge in you the imagination by which man
  lives; this is perhaps the moment of fulfilment. The work shall be
  accomplished to-night without ritual or ceremony such as we are used to, in
  your contemplation alone." He took a step towards Caithness and touched him
  on the shoulder, saying: "Have you spoken with the king?"</p>

  <p>"You're committing wickedness," the priest exclaimed and ceased, broken
  either by his own passion or by the concentration of the other's power.</p>

  <p>"Back, then," Considine gently said, and when Caithness had risen and
  moved a step or two away, he in turn knelt by the couch.</p>

  <p>"Majesty," he said, "are you willing to restore your kingship through us
  to that of which it is a shadow?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," Inkamasi said, "for though I hold you for my own enemies and for
  misguided men I think you are the only servants of the kingship that is more
  than the king."</p>

  <p>"Majesty," Considine said again, "we are the king's servants and his
  greatest friends. Farewell." He touched Inkamasi's hand with his lips and
  rising signed to Roger to follow him. The young man went forward, knelt, and
  said, "I'm sorry if this happened through me."</p>

  <p>"Don't be," Inkamasi said; "it's better to die here than under the feet of
  a London crowd&mdash;if there's any difference. Thank you, and good-bye."</p>

  <p>Roger touched his hand with his lips and went back. The rest, one by one,
  followed him, ending with Mottreux and Vereker. As Mottreux in turn moved
  back towards the door Caithness felt a hand press his arm and heard a soft
  whisper, "Come back and wait by me." The order reached him in his anguish;
  with a hope that even now something might interpose, he obeyed and slowly
  withdrew till he also stood by the door.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, his obeisance done, Vereker had brought to Considine a chalice
  that had been standing, filled with wine, on a carved table at the side of
  the room. His master poured into it the contents of a small phial; then he
  took the chalice in his hands, and turned towards the couch. The silence in
  the room grew so deep, the absorbed attention of the watchers so intense,
  that Roger felt as if the terrific moment must break in some new astonishing
  revelation. Regret and sorrow, bewilderment and antagonism, which had mingled
  in his heart, were swept away; an awful harmony began to exist. So, in other
  far-off lives, lesser or greater he could not tell, he had waited for Isabel
  when they were young and happy, and indeed he had chosen necessity; so he had
  submitted his obedience to the authority of Milton or Wordsworth, waiting for
  the august plenitude of their poetry to be manifested within him. Till now he
  had believed that sense of harmony to be all they&mdash;Isabel or Paradise
  Lost&mdash;had to offer, but he had begun to learn that to pause there was to
  be too easily content. The harmony itself was but a prelude to some
  enrichment of his whole being, which in its turn must be experienced in every
  detail&mdash;made familiar that new powers might arise. He gave himself,
  freely and wholly, to the moment; he was to live the more completely through
  the king's death. It was no good being distressed or ashamed; his business
  was to live by it, as if necessary it would be the business of others to live
  by his death. He gave himself to the moment, and in the moment to the whole
  charged imagination of man. It was no lie; the mind of man&mdash;not his mind
  or Inkamasi's but man's&mdash;was exalted above all the power of things, "of
  quality and fabric more divine," and yet his own was never nearer or more
  useful to man's than when he was most intensely aware of all things in
  himself. He gave himself to the moment.</p>

  <p>"Drink, Majesty," Considine said, and gave the chalice into Inkamasi's
  hands. The king took it, raised it to his lips, and drank. Even as it left
  his lips, his grip relaxed, his face changed, he sank heavily on to the
  cushions behind him.</p>

  <p>But before the dropped chalice reached the floor, before the sound of its
  fall could strike their ears, a violent explosion shattered them. Roger,
  fixed in his surrender, saw Considine jerk his arms up and fall crashing
  across the litter. Almost before the king's body had sunk lifeless his
  destroyer lay slain over him. For they saw, as soon as their startled senses
  acted, that two lives, not one, had been taken. The violence against which
  Considine had never pretended to be secure, but which had avoided him so
  long, had struck him at last. The bullet had pierced his skull; the blood
  streamed over the dead Zulu. And Mottreux dragged Caithness from the room,
  and shut and locked the door. He held the priest's arm; he rushed him through
  the house, making for the hall. Caithness ran, and listened to hasty orders:
  "Go straight to the car in front of the door... get in... I'll come. Can you
  drive?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he gasped.</p>

  <p>"Get in the driver's seat." They reached the hall; Mottreux looking
  frantically round rushed him to the front door, paused less than a second to
  see that the priest was actually scrambling into the car, pushed the door
  almost shut, lest by chance the other should see him, and sent another mad
  glance around the hall.</p>

  <p>By so small a chance he was defeated. The old Jew, when he was left alone
  with the casket, had, by some trick of the mind, gone back to the room where
  he and his companions had spent most of the day. He was sitting there, lost
  in his meditations, when Mottreux broke in on him, and in one wild dash
  caught the case in one hand. But Rosenberg held to the trust which the God of
  his fathers had imposed on him. He was dragged violently from his chair, but
  he clung to the sacred treasure; he heard a voice yelling oaths, but though
  he was shaken to and fro he said nothing. His face, as he lifted it, was full
  of a scorn deeper than time, the scorn of his God for the spoilers of the
  holy places. He saw the distorted face of a greedy Gentile above him, and
  before the bullet searched his brain he spat at it once.</p>

  <p>But by now the revolvers of the other servants of the Deathless One had
  blown the lock of their prison from the door, and the momentary prisoners had
  already nearly reached the hall. In a wild confusion and anger they came;
  Mottreux heard them, and ran to the glass doors on to the drive. These were
  fastened, and he was again delayed. By the time he had got them open and was
  outside, Vereker and the Egyptian were out by the car. He was seen; he fired
  once and ran along the wall of the house. The shot probably saved Caithness's
  life, for none of the pursuers were in a state to distinguish between the
  responsibility of the fugitives for the crime. But Vereker was unarmed, and
  the Egyptian was distracted by Mottreux's appearance. He left the priest to
  his companion, and ran after Mottreux, circling widely out so as to command
  the corner as he approached it. In the darkness it could only dimly be
  seen.</p>

  <p>Voices were calling from doors and windows. There were men in the room
  where the dead Jew lay. Roger, borne along in the general rush, was there
  also. He wondered afterwards why no-one had shot him down out of hand, and
  attributed his salvation to the fact that Considine had treated him
  familiarly. He tried to order his thoughts, but they only repeated
  themselves: "Considine is dead; is he dead?" Was he dead? or would he, first
  again in the great experiment, achieve the work he had desired? The question
  beat at his brain as he ran. He saw the body of the Jew as he came into the
  room, and paused by it. Without, from the darkness, there came more shots.
  Roger pulled himself together; he'd better look for Caithness. If Considine
  were dead, the two of them would be in a very dubious position; he went as
  far as the glass doors. There he listened; presently, away round the side of
  the house, he heard another shot. He slipped out and along to the car, whose
  lights shone steadily as they had done when last he looked at it before he
  had walked in the verandah and talked. This was the kind of thing that
  remained; the imagination of man was blown out in a moment but the light of
  his mechanical invention remained. He cursed deeply, and saw Caithness, who
  in a restless uncertainty had got out of the car. Roger walked up to him, but
  for a few seconds neither of them spoke.</p>

  <p>At last Caithness said: "What had we better do?"</p>

  <p>Roger answered: "I should think you'd better get away. Inkamasi's dead, so
  I don't see much point in your staying." Caithness looked round, and tried to
  see something in the darkness. He failed, and presently asked, "What's
  happened to Mottreux?"</p>

  <p>"How the hell do I know?" Roger asked. "Why did you bolt with him?" A
  sudden thought struck him, and he added: "Did you&mdash;by God, did you
  arrange for him to shoot?"</p>

  <p>"No," the priest answered, "but I promised to do what I could for him
  if... if he needed it."</p>

  <p>"I see," Roger said, and walked a few steps away. He couldn't trust
  himself to speak. That this dreamer, this master of vision should have been
  destroyed by&mdash;by a traitor and a clergyman. He walked back abruptly and
  said: "I hope you paid him better than Caiaphas did? Even at half-crowns it
  would only come to three pounds fifteen."</p>

  <p>Caithness began quietly, "Don't be unfair, Ingram&mdash;" but Roger
  pursued his own thoughts. "And did you promise him as much for
  Rosenberg?"</p>

  <p>"Rosenberg!" Caithness cried out, startled. "He can't have killed
  Rosenberg?"</p>

  <p>"Can't he?" Roger said. "What do you think he wanted? Go and look;
  Rosenberg's dead and the jewels are gone."</p>

  <p>The priest stared at him in something like horror. He had believed
  Mottreux to be sincere, and yet now&mdash;words overheard between the traitor
  and Rosenberg rushed back, the likelihood that so great a personal desire
  rather than a conversion of thought should have alienated him, his turning
  away at the last moment, the shot heard in the room close at hand, the old
  man slain (for he believed Roger at once), the seizure of the jewels by a
  covetous hand. Roger saw him flinch and said, with a touch of pity out of his
  own distress, "You didn't know?"</p>

  <p>"God help me!" Caithness said. "I didn't know." He hadn't known; he
  hadn't, if it were blameworthy, been to blame; if he were partly responsible
  for Considine's death, it was a noble responsibility, and he would bear it.
  Out of evil, God brought forth good. He added, "Then there's the less reason
  to say."</p>

  <p>Yet they did not move. Behind the house, between it and the sea, in the
  darkness, armed men sought one another in hate and fear, abandoning
  themselves to a passion which their master would have bidden them use for the
  sole purpose of interior enlargement and further victory. Their strength was
  turned to greed of treasure or greed of vengeance; the accident which had
  struck Considine down had released their too little mastered frenzies. The
  two strangers delayed, reluctant alike to go or stay in the stillness. And,
  while they delayed, the stillness burst into tumult. There were shots and
  voices calling, Mottreux's voice challenging, a chaos of sound, and breaking
  out of it and over it a high terrific shriek.</p>

  <p>The shriek terrified them as they stood there; it was a death-call. It
  scattered their disputes and their dogmas, for, whether he who uttered it was
  slaying or being slain, it was the cry of an intenser death than that of an
  ordinary man. One of those experimenting spirits had broken into that cry; it
  swept out to them from the passion of a nature beyond theirs, and its sound
  pierced them with fear of death, of that greater life, and of the greater
  death in that life. The lord of the adepts was dead, and enmity was abroad
  among them as the dead Zulu had prophesied days before. The cry came to Roger
  as a blast that drove him away. Nigel Considine was dead; the treachery he
  had despised had taken him; the final dereliction had swallowed him. If he
  returned&mdash;but Roger fled from that return. His nerve broke; he shrank
  back against the car, and said to Caithness, "Let's go; let's go."</p>

  <p>The priest himself, trembling, turned. "Shall we&mdash;" he began, laying
  his hand on the car.</p>

  <p>"No, for God's sake," Roger exclaimed. "Let's leave it all, if we're
  leaving it. If it isn't for us, let's get away from it. Come; we'll get
  somewhere."</p>

  <p>Caithness silently assented. "But let's get our coats at least!" he said.
  "They'll be just in there."</p>

  <p>"I'm not going in there again," Roger said, "unless Considine himself
  calls me."</p>

  <p>"Then I will," Caithness said. He sprang back into the hall, and in a
  couple of minutes returned. "We shall want them if we're walking all night,"
  he said, and so, in a mingling of terror and despair, and hope and the
  commonplace, they went down to the gates and out into the darkness beyond.
  Once the priest said, "Mrs. Ingram'll be glad to see you back."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Roger answered. "Isabel..." and said no more.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">XIV.</a> &mdash; SEA-CHANGE</h2>

  <p class="first">Some time next morning, after wandering long on foot and
  finding at last in an unknown town a small garage where they hired a car that
  took them to Winchester, and coming thence by train to London, they reached
  again the house in Kensington, from which less than forty-eight hours earlier
  they had been swept away. The streets were still full of wanderers, though it
  had been known for hours that safety had returned, and the wild intrusion
  been destroyed. The mob by then had fallen into a waking stupor, not unlike
  the sleep in which Rosamond still lay; it moved somnambulistically, and the
  civil authorities, by the use of police and military, by commandeering
  transport, by supplying food and drink as best they could, managed at last to
  control and direct it. Laden motor-buses carried the fugitives back towards
  their houses; taxis, lorries, and all other possible vehicles were put in
  service for the same purpose. Roger and Caithness made a slow way by the
  Tubes, now gradually freeing themselves from their invasion, to Colindale
  Square. They came to it shivering in the bleak noon&mdash;as chilled bathers
  might stumble up a stony beach, while behind them a deserted and disconsolate
  sea moaned. Sir Bernard came hastily to meet them, deserting for the time
  being the medley of fugitives who filled his kitchen and overflowed into the
  other rooms, and for whom conveyances had not yet been found. Roger nodded to
  him but could not speak; he left explanations to Caithness. In a moment
  Isabel came also; to her he turned, and with her he shut himself away. Once
  safe he said to her with no accent in his voice: "He's dead."</p>

  <p>"Dead!" she exclaimed. "Roger, my dear! "</p>

  <p>He had perhaps never entirely trusted her before, for all their sweet
  friendship. But his defences were down, and he lay exposed, terribly
  sensitive to her looks and words. She neither sympathized nor condoled; in
  the deep practice of her love her heart was struck equally with his. She
  suffered his desolation as she had his desire; the trust of his spiritual
  necessity with which she had charged herself knew this union also. He
  realized at that moment the vast experience of love which she had undergone,
  and accepted it. But he only said with a faint smile, implicitly recognizing
  her vicarious grief, "Yet you didn't believe in him."</p>

  <p>She sat down, wide eyes on his, and ignoring the comment, said in a hushed
  voice of awe, "Tell me. Can he be-?"</p>

  <p>He told her as clearly as he could, what had happened. And at the end she
  said, "But, Roger, mightn't he..." She couldn't finish; her own personal
  nature fainted before the intensity with which it felt another's hope.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he answered. "If so... It may be, but I daren't think of
  it. Isabel, Isabel, to think what killed him! "</p>

  <p>At that moment Caithness was talking swiftly to Sir Bernard downstairs.
  "So, when I went back for our coats, I saw them," he said; "they were all
  ready there, all three packets and I brought them with me." He pointed at the
  table on which three thick envelopes lay which he had extracted from his
  coat-pocket. "He must have meant to take them with him, or else they were
  directions for the others. They were on a chest in the hall, waiting till we
  &mdash;till he&mdash;came back. Don't you think they ought to go to the Prime
  Minister?"</p>

  <p>"I hate telling the Prime Minister anything," Sir Bernard said. "It's like
  feeding a gorilla without a body; he can't digest words. I don't know which
  is worse for civilized man, Suydler or Considine."</p>

  <p>"Considine's dead," Caithness said.</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard lifted a packet distastefully. "I wish I were a Christian," he
  murmured, "then I should feel I ought to. As it is&mdash;I suppose Considine
  is dead?"</p>

  <p>"Of course he is," Caithness said impatiently. "Mottreux shot him; I've
  just told you. I'd no notion he wanted the jewels. And even if he weren't
  &mdash;Considine, I mean&mdash;that would only make it more urgent that
  Suydler should have the papers. They may be of use or they mayn't. But he
  ought to have them."</p>

  <p>"They'll all be in cipher, I should think," Sir Bernard said, with a good
  deal of satisfaction. "Suydler can have a jolly time guessing it. But I don't
  like it, in spite of Mr. Considine's obscene and pernicious gospel. I don't
  like giving any gospel to Suydler. Yes, all right, I suppose I must. Portrait
  of Gallio presenting the manuscript of the Evangelists to the Missing Link.
  You'll have to come too; then you can tell him all about the house."</p>

  <p>When as a consequence the house by the sea was approached, late the same
  day, with great force and much circumspection, the results were a little
  disappointing. The body of Inkamasi still lay on its royal couch, but the
  body of the master of the adepts had disappeared. No living person was there;
  no car in the drive nor submarine in the bay. But behind the house lay
  Mottreux, a knife-wound in his throat, and sprawled over him, a bullet in his
  chest, the body of a negro, whom Caithness recognized as one of those that
  had followed Considine to the king's death. Further away lay the Egyptian,
  also shot. Vereker and the Arab were not to be found.</p>

  <p>But the extent of the catastrophe which the traitor had brought upon the
  headship of the cause became clear, as the days passed. Considine and three
  of the closest members of his personal staff had been destroyed, and the
  great movement was checked. There were no more messages from the High
  Executive. What tale reached the various headquarters of the African armies
  the European Governments never knew. But the labouring and anxious generals
  of their forces began to telegraph the most cheering news. In one or two
  districts something like panic broke out among the enemy, a great noise of
  wailing and disorderly firing and then flight. In others the negro forces
  began to retire, and as they were pressed by the pursuit gave way and were
  overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>The papers Caithness had seized, which after a great deal of trouble were
  at least partially decoded&mdash;only partially; some of them remained
  mysteries even to the most ingenious cipher-expert&mdash;contained sufficient
  allusions in detail to make the task of the uncovering of Considine's
  bases&mdash;houses in Europe and headquarters in Africa&mdash;a much easier
  business than had been feared. An encouraging but slightly vague account
  appeared in the Press of how a British patriot, who preferred his Imperial
  citizenship to his Zulu birthright, had shot Considine while being pressed to
  join him. It was understood that he had deliberately sacrificed himself in
  order to help England, and a good deal of quiet (and not too quiet) pride was
  felt that it was an English subject, or at least a Dominion subject, who had
  acted so. No Senegalese had done as much, nor the native of any district
  administered by other European countries. Such was the spirit produced by the
  British occupation. A rather acrimonious correspondence opened between the
  British Government and the other Powers on the subject of Considine's own
  nationality. The French, Italian, Spanish, and Belgian ambassadors presented
  Notes which pointed out that the late Nigel Considine being a British subject
  the respective Governments had in equity a claim to be indemnified by his
  Britannic Majesty's Government for the expense to which they had been put.
  His Britannic Majesty replied through the High Executive of Mr. Raymond
  Suydler's Foreign Minister (the Earl of Basingstoke) to the effect that there
  were nine mutually destructive reasons why the claim should either not be
  admitted or should be set against still heavier amounts due to his Britannic
  Majesty for damage suffered. Mr. Suydler made a great speech at an Albert
  Hall Meeting, and was cheered wildly when he announced that the European
  Governments had determined to sign no formal terms of peace with an enemy who
  had no business to be there at all, but to hold a conference in Madeira to
  decide on the future settlement of Africa, the terms of which would
  afterwards be submitted to the League of Nations, thus confirming the
  passionate belief of the Powers in democratic control. Mr. Suydler was also
  loudly applauded in the course of his witty and brilliant remarks upon the
  attempts of the madman who had been responsible for all the trouble to turn
  his megalomaniac nonsense into philosophical nonsense. "Guess: what can you
  do but guess? We guessed&mdash;and we guessed right!" Terrific cheers.</p>

  <p>Sir Bernard read it and smiled a little sadly. Philip read it and let it
  slip by; he was engaged with a recovered Rosamond and his career. Roger did
  not read it. Sir Bernard asked Philip whether, at a pinch, he would vote for
  Suydler or Considine. Philip read it, and for almost the first time in his
  life startled his father into real admiration by saying that he should vote
  for fan Caithness. But Sir Bernard's mind illumined the answer with a drier
  light than Philip's. He wrote of it to the priest: "I congratulate you, my
  dear fan, on your proselyte&mdash;you can instruct him further when you come
  up to marry him. There's a notion grown up that since his career'll have to
  be postponed or reorganized or reborn or something, it would be only
  reasonable ("reasonable!" I also have my martyrdoms) that I should make
  financial arrangements for him to be married at once. Rosamond's still
  recuperating at the cottage in Dorset, she sent me a pretty note of thanks
  the other day in which she asked whether you didn't know the Archbishop
  fairly well. You'll guess&mdash;as Suydler would say&mdash;what she meant. I
  leave it to you to decide whether you do&mdash;well enough, I mean. If he
  should be shot by a deacon who wanted to wear the vestments of the See at a
  fancy dress ball I fancy Suydler would be willing to offer you the
  Archiepiscopal mitre; he's touchingly grateful to someone, and went so far as
  to ask me if there was anything I wanted. I told him I wanted justice and
  proportion which is the daughter of justice, knowledge and abstraction which
  is the daughter of knowledge. This dreadful tendency to personify and
  (therefore) mythologise I attribute to you and the late Mr. Considine, who
  was an entire mythology about himself. From Considine to you (excuse me),
  from you to Philip, from Philip to Rosamond&mdash;behold the history of
  religion! The High Executive disappears under the sea, and leaves its brother
  of Canterbury to add a touch of richness to my daughter-in-law's wedding. If
  I had indulged myself in irony as long as Providence, I should be a little
  tired of it by now, but I suppose he has infinite patience with himself as
  well as with us. But mightn't he occasionally try a new note?"</p>

  <p>Of Roger Sir Bernard said nothing, though he thought of him as he wrote
  "the High Executive disappears under the sea." For he was aware that that was
  all that they knew, and even that they only surmised, and he thought Roger
  was intensely aware of it too. But he did not know how acutely, and Isabel
  did not tell him.</p>

  <p>Nor had she told him of how much younger and older at once Roger had
  seemed since his return. She missed in him something of warfare and much of
  scorn. If he was arrogant still it was a more airy arrogance than of old; if
  he mocked he mocked more tenderly. But she wondered whether in his heart he
  &mdash;and she also&mdash;secretly awaited a return.</p>

  <p>Roger himself could not have told her. He shut himself away from the noisy
  European victories, from the talk and the congratulations. He took up his
  work again, but as he made notes for a special address on The Antithetical
  Couplet from Dryden to Johnson he was humbly aware that this work was part of
  a greater work. It would be his fault if he so touched the least detail of
  the divine art as to leave himself or others less sensitive to its central
  passion&mdash;his fault, his most grievous fault, his sad incompetence. But
  even sad incompetence might recognize the Power it could hardly name. He
  would never cease any more to acknowledge it, to search in it and for it, to
  believe in it, to wait for it. Other people had their ways; this was his.
  What more &mdash;</p>

  <p>What indeed had chanced? Had the submarine, plunging away from that house
  of mingled death and life, carried with it but the dead body of its lord? and
  had men somewhere far off, seen that body change beneath inexorable
  corruption and committed it to the waters of the sea or to the African earth?
  Did it there undergo the final doom of mortality in slow change, or had some
  fiercer destruction, the shark or the tiger, seized on it? He had dreams
  sometimes of sharks fighting round the sinking body of Nigel Considine, and
  sometimes he had other dreams. He saw the body carried to the submarine, he
  saw it carried off far into the ocean, and then, sometimes in the vessel,
  sometimes out of it, he saw it change. Sometimes he saw men in a narrow room
  watching by it, crying out, hurrying to it, adoring it. But more often
  &mdash;though the dream itself was not often&mdash;he saw it floating alone
  in the middle of the sea, far away, far down, and he saw the eyes open and
  the hands move, and the whole body stir. Life was rushing back into it;
  power, spirit, imagination, whatever name sad incompetence found for it, was
  re-animating the willing flesh. He saw it walking in the waters and heard it
  calling through them. The creatures of the deep, octopus and shark, greed and
  ferocity, fled before it. Behind it, as it came, there was no more sea; in
  front of it the waters flowed into it and became the man who moved in them.
  Back from the shore they swept, out towards that advancing humanity, and all
  their mysteries were swallowed up in his shining lucidity. This was the vast
  of experience, currents and tides, streams and whirlpools, restless waves and
  fathomless depths, absorbed by man. The salt that tinctured it, as the salt
  of Sir Bernard's amusement tinctured life, was absorbed also. Valuable as
  that preservative salt was, in the end it was infinitely less than the
  elements of which it was part, and to prefer it to the renewed body would be
  to prefer the means to the end, detachment to union. Irony might sustain the
  swimmer in the sea; it could not master the sea. A greater than Sir Bernard
  did that now, if indeed now, up the African sand or the English beach, that
  conqueror returned.</p>

  <p>If he returned. If he carried out the experiment of his vision, the
  purpose of his labours. If, first among his peers, when all believed him
  lost, he thrust himself from the place of shades back into immortal and
  transmuted life, if he held death at his disposal, if he knew how the vivid
  ecstasy of experience dominated all shapes and forms, all accidents of time
  and place. If he came now, humming those last songs which the greatest of the
  poets had made from his own vision of Ariel flying free, smiling at the
  blindness of extreme pain and the paralysis of extreme possession, guardian
  of myths and expositor of power... if he returned. If now, while the world
  shouted over the defeat of his allies and subjects, while it drove its terror
  back into its own unmapped jungles, and subdued its fiercer desires to an
  alien government of sterile sayings, if now he came once more to threaten and
  deliver it. If&mdash;ah beyond, beyond belief!&mdash;but if he
  returned...</p>
