<p>Mr Foster noted, near the end of the address recorded here:</p>

<p><i>The name Devonshire Street Cemetery could fairly be applied
to those sections which faced or extended to that street, but is
somewhat of a misnomer when describing the original Burial Ground,
which faced Belmore Park. For lack of a better name, I and others
refer to it as the "Sandhills Cemetery." It was a sandhill when
Macquarie chose it, and when the memorials and remains of the
pioneers were removed it became a sandhill once again.</i>
</p>

<p>The "sandhill" no longer exists. Since 1902 the land has formed
part of Sydney's Central Railway Station.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Creation of the Sandhills
(Devonshire Street) Cemetery</h2>

<p>In the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>, of Saturday, January 22, 1820, may
be seen the following announcement:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Circumstances arising out of the nature and
quality of the ground heretofore used as a place of Burial, within
the Town of Sydney, rendering it offensive to the inhabitants in
the neighbourhood, it has been deemed expedient to discontinue it
for that purpose altogether, and that a place not liable to similar
objections should be selected of an extent proportioned to the
increase of the population.* For that purpose His Excellency the
Governor has lately caused a spacious burial ground to be prepared
and enclosed with a wall, situated at a short distance beyond the
Brickfields, which is henceforth only to be used as a place of
interment for the accommodation of the inhabitants of the town and
neighbourhood of Sydney. Previous, however, to its being made a
place of interment, the ground thus appropriated for this solemn
and sacred purpose will be consecrated by the Reverend the
Principal Chaplain, which ceremony stands appointed to take place
on Thursday next, the 27th instant, when divine service will be
performed at the Church of St. Phillip's, Sydney, at the hour of
eleven in the forenoon. And it is further notified, ordered, and
directed, that from and after the 28th instant, all funerals are to
take place at the said new burial ground, and that from henceforth
the old burial ground, which has been enclosed with a wall, will be
totally closed up, and no further access suffered to be had thereto
for purposes of interment.<br>
<br>
By His Excellency's Command,<br>
J. T. Campbell, Secretary.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The old burial ground referred to was
situated on the site of the present Sydney Town Hall, George
Street, Sydney. Ed.]</p>

<p><i>The Gazette</i>, of Saturday, January 29, 1820, contains
further particulars:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">The new burial ground at the Brickfield,
having undergone the Ceremony of Consecration, is henceforth to be
used exclusively as the place of interment by the inhabitants of
Sydney and its neighbourhood. And the former burial ground,
situated within the town of Sydney, having in consequence of the
opening of the new burial ground, according to the Ceremonies of
the Church of England, been securely shut up, by the gate being
closed, barred and locked so as to preclude all access thereto,
unless on occasions of necessity, such as shall be authorised by
the Assistant Chaplain at Sydney, it is hereby notified, ordered,
and directed, that no person or persons shall enter the said ground
without obtaining such permission from the Assistant Chaplain.<br>
<br>
It being reported that certain persons have been hitherto in the
habit of drivings pigs, cows, and horses into the old burial
ground, to the great offence of decency, it is hereby notified that
any animals which shall hereafter be found either in the old or new
burial ground will be impounded for trespass, and the owners
prosecuted for a misdemeanour. It being necessary that certain
regulations should be laid down in order to preserve the future
Regularity of interments in the new burial ground, it is ordered
and directed that from the present Date:<br>
<br>
1. That no vaults or graves be made without the knowledge of the
Chaplain on Duty at Sydney, and that all interments shall be
attended by the said Chaplain, unless prevented by sickness or
other unavoidable cause.<br>
<br>
2. That all vaults shall be of the same length, however they may
vary in breadth, and be placed uniformly in line with each other,
and all placed on one particular Side of the burial ground, under
the direction of the Assistant Chaplain of Sydney.<br>
<br>
3. That the ordinary description of graves, whether with or without
tomb or headstone, be also uniformly placed in line with each
other, extending east and west, according to the order established
in the Mother Country, and that the distances between graves be not
made unnecessarily great.<br>
<br>
4. That a portion of the burial ground, occupying one corner
thereof, be set apart by the Assistant Chaplain for peculiar and
special purposes, at the direction of the said Chaplain.<br>
<br>
5. That the Parish Clerk do keep a register distinct from that kept
by the Chaplain containing the name of each person interred, the
date of interment, and the situation interred in, and that the
interments shall be numbered annually.<br>
<br>
6. As the foregoing arrangements and the increased distance of the
present burial ground must necessarily occasion much additional
trouble to the Chaplain and Parish Clerk, His Excellency is pleased
further to order and direct that the Chaplain who shall perform the
funeral service and the Parish Clerk in attendance thereon, shall
receive instead of the former rate of funeral fees, according to
the following Scale, viz.:&mdash;<br>
<br>
The chaplain for interring a free person, 5/-; Clerk attending
ditto, 2/6. And the grave digger&mdash;provided he reside in the lodge
prepared for him on the spot&mdash;shall receive for each grave made by
him for any free person, the sum of two shillings and sixpence.<br>
<br>
The fee to be paid the person who tolls the church bell shall
continue as heretofore, namely, sixpence.<br>
<br>
By His Excellency's command,<br>
J. T. Campbell, secretary.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Description of the Cemetery and
Surrounds</h2>

<p>The site chosen for the new burial ground was one of a range of
sandhills lying south of the Brickfields, from which it was
separated by a valley known to us as Belmore Park and the
Haymarket.</p>

<p>Through this valley a stream of water flowed, crossing George
Street near its intersection with Hay Street, and emptied into
Cockle Bay&mdash;now known as Darling Harbour&mdash;at that time
much nearer George Street than it is to-day.</p>

<p>It is easy to picture a stream of water running into the harbour
at the foot of Brickfield Hill; but not so easy to picture a stream
crossing George Street near Goulburn street; yet such was the case,
and both there and at the Haymarket bridges were erected across
these streams.</p>

<p>We can gain some idea of the changed configuration of Brickfield
Hill by recalling the fact that in the thirties*, not less than one
million cubic feet of earth was removed from the hill and placed in
the valley below. By such means, hills, hollows and rivulets so
completely disappeared that to-day one can scarcely believe they
ever existed. The Toll Bar and the Carters' Barracks, built in
1819, and the Benevolent Asylum, erected in 1820, were the
cemetery's nearest neighbours at that period. A plan of Sydney,
bearing the date 1822, gives one an excellent idea as to how this
southern part of the town looked nearly a hundred years ago.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* the eighteen-thirties]</p>

<p>Eighty years passed away, and the town of Sydney grew into a
great city. The quiet cemetery saw the Brickfields transformed, and
the adjoining sandhills covered with houses; witnessed the
disappearance of rivulets, shrub and wildflower, and then its own
turn came, and the historic cemetery where "The rude forefathers of
the hamlet slept" is now but a memory of "Old Sydney."</p>

<p>Through this cemetery, by means of the many pictures to be
thrown upon the screen, we are about to wend our way. We shall see
the graves of men and women whose services to the colony were so
great and whose lives were so full of incident and adventure that
nothing short of a volume would be needed to recount them. And now
let us turn back the wheels of time for near a score of years, and
accepting me as your guide, take a ramble through one of the most
historic cemeteries in Australia.</p>

<p>Before we enter the gates, we will view the cemetery from an
elevation, and so we ascend to the roof of Anthony Hordern's
furniture warehouse, then in Gipps Street, Haymarket. From this
altitude we get the fine panoramic view shown on the screen.</p>

<p>At the corner of Pitt Street and Belmore Road we see the old
tram sheds. Adjoining these, are buildings approximately on the
site of the old Carters' Barracks.</p>

<p>The Convent of the Good Samaritan was built, it is said, in
front of the barracks, while the Female Refuge, to the south of
this, occupies the site of the House of Correction, in which stood
that old instrument of punishment&mdash;the treadmill. Between
these buildings and the Benevolent Asylum stood the cottage, for
many years the residence of the Inspector-General of Police, Capt.
McLerie. The two-storied house nearer the asylum is Christ's Church
Rectory. At one time the watch-house was on that spot, but an
exchange was effected, and the watch-house was erected at the
intersection of George and Pitt streets, on the triangular corner
which was part of the church land.</p>

<p>The Benevolent Asylum stands out well in the picture, as does
also the old railway station beyond.</p>

<p>The cemetery is clearly shown; the northern part is the Church
of England section. This is separated from the Roman Catholic and
Presbyterian sections by a brick wall, surmounted by a stone
coping; the Presbyterian portion ran at the back of the asylum
fence, right to Devonshire Street, and east of this was the
Friends' Meeting House and small burial ground; then the
Congregational, Wesleyan, and Jewish sections, which faced
Devonshire Street, opposite the railway station, and access was
gained from that street.</p>

<p>The older portion fronted Belmore Park, and was separated from
it by Belmore Road, a winding thoroughfare that ran from Pitt to
Elizabeth streets. From this road&mdash;which is now completely
obliterated&mdash;one passed through an iron gateway into the
cemetery. If we now cross to Elizabeth Street, we get from another
elevation an excellent, though not a complete, view of what became
known as the Church of England section, though it should be
remembered that here members of all religious denominations were at
first buried. It is to this portion we shall to-night confine our
rambles.</p>

<p>At the corner of Belmore Road we pause for a moment to glance at
the high wall in Elizabeth Street, which formed the eastern
boundary of the burial ground. From this we can mentally picture
the high sandhills shown in the map of 1822. Now, presently, we
reach the entrance gates, and passing in, bid good-day to the
veteran caretaker&mdash;Edward Broomfield&mdash;whom we see seated
on the verandah of the little cottage, and, wending our way along a
path bordered with trees and flowers, we soon reach the
south-western corner of the ground where the first interment took
place in 1819.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Tour of Graves</h2>

<p>Presently we shall visit the grave of Quarter-Master McDonald
[the first burial in the cemetery], but I shall give pride of place
to the First Fleeters, the men and women who arrived with Governor
Phillip.</p>

<p>'Tis true also that they left England for reasons vastly
different to those which animated the breasts of their kinsmen on
the <i>Mayflower</i>. But if they were not Puritans, they were at
least patriots, for, in a famous and familiar poem we are
told:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"They left their country for their country's
good,<br>
And none will doubt but that their emigration<br>
Has proved most useful to the British nation."</p>

<p>The author of those lines little thought that beneath his
playful sarcasm was the spirit of true prophesy. Who, to-day, would
say that our wheat, our wool, and our Anzacs have not proved useful
to the British nation. Another century hence a sentiment will have
grown round the graves of our pioneers, and the few monuments that
perchance remain, will be carefully preserved. The day may not be
far distant when this Society will be in a position to preserve
some of the landmarks connected with our early history, and not the
least interesting to posterity will be the graves of the First
Fleeters.</p>

<p>The first grave we shall visit is that of James Squire, of
Kissing Point, whose quaint and historic epitaph is of sufficient
interest without any words of mine.</p>

<p class="cp">In Sacred Respect<br>
to the Remains of<br>
MR. JAMES SQUIRE,<br>
late of Kissing Point,<br>
who departed this life May 16th, 1822,<br>
Aet 67 Years.<br>
He arrived in this Colony in the First Fleet,<br>
and by Integrity and Industry<br>
acquired and maintained an unsullied Reputation.<br>
Under his Care<br>
the HOP PLANT was first Cultivated<br>
in this Settlement, and<br>
the first BREWERY was Erected,<br>
which progressively matured to Perfection.<br>
As a Father,<br>
a Husband, a Friend, and a Christian<br>
He lived Respected and died Lamented.<br>
Also JAMES SQUIRE,<br>
Son of the above,<br>
who Died MARCH 5th, 1826,<br>
Aged, 28 years.</p>

<p>The site of this early brewery and hop garden can still be
pointed out. Somewhere in that garden was laid to rest the remains
of the celebrated aborigine Bennelong and his wife.</p>

<p>In the Historical Records of N.S.W., Vol. 1, part 2, page 308,
we find that Phillip, writing to Nepean, under date February 13,
1790, says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"In the beginning of the following April,
numbers of the natives were found dead with the small-pox in
different parts of the harbour; and an old man and a boy of about
eight years of age were brought to the hospital. The man died, but
the boy recovered, and now lives with the surgeon."</p>

<p>Collins tells us that this boy was taken to live "with Mr.
White, the surgeon, to whom&mdash;for his attention during the
cure&mdash;he seemed to be much attached."</p>

<p>In the <i>Sydney Gazette</i>, of September 8, 1821, we read:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"On the 12th of last month, died at the
residence of Mr. James Squire, Kissing Point, Andrew Sneap Hammond
Douglas White, a black native of this colony. He was about 37 years
old, and was taken from the woods a few months after the first
establishment in 1788 by Dr. White, after whom he was named.<br>
<br>
"His mother died just before of the small-pox, which raged horribly
among the poor natives at that time, and was buried by Mr. Squire.
Up to the period of his kind protector's departure for Europe, he
was employed as a gamekeeper, when he voluntarily entered himself
on board of His Majesty's Ship <i>Reliance</i>, Captain Waterhouse,
and was much esteemed for his strict attention to the duties of a
seaman. Subsequently he went on a voyage in the <i>Investigator</i>
with Captain Flinders, the crew of which ship were also much
delighted with his orderly behaviour and uncommon alertness. Upon
his return, however, he betook himself to his native wilds, which
were mostly in the vicinity of Kissing Point. From the woods he
only occasionally emerged for a number of years, in order to return
with renewed avidity and satisfaction. Mr. Squire, we have every
reason to believe, treated him with particular tenderness, and had
recourse to many stratagems to rescue him from wretchedness, and
with this view occasionally gave him amusing employment,
accompanied with plenty of indulgence, but all proved
unavailing&mdash;ancestral habits being too indelibly engendered
ever to be eradicated by human effort, however strained in its
benevolent design. He lies interred in the same grave with
Bennelong and his wife, in Mr. Squire's garden."</p>

<p>Perhaps the grave of Bennelong, his wife, and the interesting
native named after Surgeon White, may yet be found, and a memorial
erected to their memory.</p>

<p>The next "First Fleeter" we come to in chronological order is
John Trace, whose headstone bears this inscription:</p>

<p class="cp">Sacred<br>
to the Memory<br>
of<br>
JOHN TRACE,<br>
who departed this Life,<br>
1st July, 1823,<br>
Aged 82 Years.<br>
A faithful friend, a father Dear,<br>
A loving husband lieth Here.<br>
In Space of time god (sic) did him Take,<br>
Lord rest his soul for Jesus' sake.<br></p>

<p>William Tyrrill, before whose headstone we now stand, failed to
reach the allotted span:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">Sacred<br>
to the Memory of<br>
WILLIAM TYRRILL,<br>
Who Departed this Life,<br>
June 25th, 1827,<br>
Aged 68 Years.<br>
who Arrived in the First Fleet in the<br>
Year 1788.<br>
Do not Lament, my Children, dear;<br>
I ham (sic) not Dead, but Sleepeth Here.</p>

<p>An interesting feature in this epitaph is the emphatic manner in
which continuity of life beyond the grave is expressed: "I ham not
dead, but sleepeth here."</p>

<p>There is nothing on the headstone of Elisabeth Beckford to
indicate that she came with the first settlers, but her name is
among the list of passengers. The stone is thus
inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">To the Memory<br>
of<br>
ELISABETH BECKFORD,<br>
who departed this Life,<br>
January 10th, 1827,<br>
Aged 55 Years.<br>
It is Finished, was her Latest Voice,<br>
These Sacred Accents oe'r she bowed.<br>
Her head Gave up the Ghost, and<br>
Suffered pain no more.</p>

<p>The stone was the last one to be removed from the Church of
England section.</p>

<p class="caption">Memorial of the First Interment in the Sandhills
Cemetery.<br>
<i>Photo by Mrs. A. G. Foster.</i></p>

<p>A very small headstone marks the grave of Thomas Prior, who,
like many more, found length of days in this new land. The stone is
embellished with several Masonic emblems:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">Sacred to the Memory of<br>
THOMAS PRIOR,<br>
who departed this Life,<br>
July 24th, 1836,<br>
Aged 88 Years.<br>
who Arrived in the first Fleet, 1788.</p>

<p>There are several First Fleet graves in this section, but one
more must suffice:</p>

<p class="cp">Sacred<br>
to the Memory of<br>
Mrs. FRANCES MINTZ,<br>
who departed this Life the<br>
11th November, 1828,<br>
Aged 64 Years.<br>
<br>
She arrived in this Colony in the first<br>
Fleet in the year 1788, and after visiting<br>
England three times, died here much<br>
respected by all who knew her.<br>
<br>
Also to the memory of<br>
Mrs. MARY MARSHALL,<br>
who departed this Life,<br>
the 29th April, 1849.<br>
Aged 93 Years.</p>

<p>Although it is not stated so on the stone, Mrs. Mary Marshall
was also a First Fleeter. Born in 1756, she lived under five
Sovereigns and 10 Governors, from George II. to Queen Victoria, and
from Phillip to Fitzroy. One might say with truth she lived within
the memory of persons living today, and thus the foundation of the
Colony is brought quite close to us.</p>

<p>Passing from the First Fleeters we return to the older portion,
and, reaching the crest of the hill, find, in a row close together,
three historic graves, Quarter-Master Hugh McDonald, James Scott,
and John William Lewin.</p>

<p>I shall say a few words first about James Scott's tomb. It is
the centre one of the three. The stone is thus
inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">Sacred<br>
To the Memory of<br>
Mr. JAMES SCOTT,<br>
who arrived in this Colony in the Year 1814,<br>
as Quarter-Master-Serjeant of H.M. 46th Reg.,<br>
and Departed this Life<br>
9th Dec., 1832.<br>
<br>
He was a Man of eminent Piety, ardently devoted through<br>
a long series of years to the cause of his God, and<br>
indefatigable in his labours for the Temporal and Spiritual<br>
Happiness of his Fellow-men. His afflicted Widow, who<br>
humbly anticipates a blessed re-union with the Partner of<br>
her heart, has Erected this feeble testimony to his holy<br>
and useful character.<br>
<br>
For the Memory of the Just is blessed.<br>
<br>
Also<br>
<br>
Mrs. JANE SCOTT,<br>
relict of the above,<br>
who Departed this Life,<br>
11th March, 1834, Aged 74 Years.<br>
"Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord."<br>
(Rev. 14 C. 13V.)<br>
<br>
And also<br>
<br>
Mrs. MARY JANE BAKER,<br>
Daughter of the late Mrs. Jane Scott,<br>
who departed this Life, Dec. 2, 1842,<br>
Aged 50 Years.</p>

<p>James Scott well deserved the eulogy engraved on the stone.
Leaving the Army, he settled in Sydney, and received an appointment
in the Commisariat Department. Originally a Presbyterian, he had
attached himself to the Methodists, and was, according to the
<i>Sydney Herald</i>, "one of their brightest ornaments." To him
the Methodists were indebted for their first church, which he built
on his own ground in Prince Street. He bore the entire cost of the
building&mdash;some 500 guineas&mdash;himself. On Sunday, December
9, 1832, Mr. Scott had been preaching at the Carters' Barracks, and
was riding home on a young and spirited horse. When near his home
in Prince Street the horse shied, and Scott was thrown to the
ground, causing concussion of the brain, death being almost
instantaneous. It is singular that neither on the stone nor in the
death announcement is the age of Scott given.</p>

<p>Next to Scott, on the eastern side, was the grave of the artist,
John William Lewin.</p>

<p>Writing to Governor Hunter, under date February 6, 1798, the
Duke of Portland said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Mr. Lewin is a painter and drawer in natural
history, and being desirous of pursuing his studies in a country
which cannot fail to improve that branch of knowledge, you will
allow him the usual Government rations during his residence in the
Settlement."</p>

<p>It seems to me that justice has not yet been done to the memory
of Lewin. The same spirit of adventure and love of natural history
that moved Joseph Banks to accompany Captain Cook, animated Lewin.
In 1801 he sailed with Lieut. Grant to Western Port. Later, he
accompanied Colonel Paterson during his explorations on the Hunter,
and in 1815 he formed one of the party chosen by Governor Macquarie
to accompany him on his first journey across the mountains, over
the famous road just completed by William Cox. Apart from Lewin's
work as a naturalist, he has left us a rich legacy in his paintings
of Old Sydney. Some excellent examples can be seen in the Mitchell
Library.</p>

To his Memory.</p>

<p>The <i>Sydney Gazette</i> contains this very brief notice of
Lewin's death:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Died, yesterday morning, after a severe
illness, J. W. Lewin, Coroner; universally respected."</p>

<p>According to Obed West, Mr. Lewin's house was a two-storied one,
with a tiled roof. It stood on the eastern side of George Street,
between Bathurst and Liverpool streets, north of Mr. Wilshire's
property. It was converted into a public-house, called the "Spotted
Dog." The land attached to it ran right through to Pitt Street.</p>

<p>The western of the three graves was that of Quarter-Master Hugh
McDonald. The lengthy obituary notice in the <i>Gazette</i>, of
September 11, 1819, is in marked contrast to the very brief
reference made to Lewin:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"On Thursday morning last, in the 36th year of
his age, after a long and painful illness, borne with Christian
fortitude and patience, Mr. Hugh McDonald, Quarter-Master of the
46th Regt., leaving an amiable widow and four children to deplore
his early fate. Mr. McDonald was much and justly respected by the
Regiment to which be belonged. He left it a few months ago at
Madras to come hither for his wife and family, whom he was obliged
to leave behind him when the 46th embarked for India. In respect to
the memory of this worthy man, His Excellency the Governor, the
Lieut.-Governor, and nearly all the principal officers, civil and
military, attended the funeral at 1 o'clock this day.<br>
<br>
"We noticed also several ribbons on the breasts of the Gentlemen,
to mark the memory of the deceased as that of a good and worthy
Brother Mason. The 48th Regiment attended, and the usual military
procession and honours were paid on the mournful occasion, whilst
the body itself was borne to the grave by a detachment of the 46th
Regt., which happens to be here at this time on its way to India.
The interment took place in the new Burial Ground, being the first
there, at the instance of the deceased, who had repeatedly, during
his illness, expressed a desire to that effect."</p>

<p>The remains of Hugh McDonald and other relatives, whose names
are not recorded on the stone, and around whose lives a pathetic
story is woven, were removed to the family vault at St. Jude's,
Randwick, but the stone I now show you will be seen by no visitor
there, because it, too, was placed in the vault.</p>

<p>You will notice how beautiful and varied is the lettering that
adorns this stone. But the lettering is the work of some one
skilled in penmanship, of someone who had been taught the art and
mystery of engraving. I am glad I have preserved some specimens of
his handiwork, though, alas that very skill used some years later
in a wrong direction, cost him his life. There is a singular
coincidence connected with our friend's lapse from virtue, which is
thus recorded in a paper of the time*. For the sake of possible
relatives, I give neither name nor date:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"THE LATE FORGERY."<br>
<br>
"The plate by means of which the recent forgeries on the Waterloo
Company were executed was found yesterday in the New Burial Ground,
and delivered up to Mr. Daniel Cooper. S&mdash;&mdash; [Sly], who lately
suffered for uttering the forged notes, used to be frequently
employed in cutting inscriptions on the tombstones, and availed
himself of the burial ground as a secure place to deposit an
instrument which in any other situation was so liable to be
discovered. It is well, however, that the plate has been found, for
so long as its existence and place of concealment was known to
anyone, neither the public, or the firm on whom the forgery had
been committed, was secure from fraud. It is remarkable that B&mdash;&mdash;
[Byfield], who was an active agent in circulating the forged notes,
and the principal witness against the forger, was buried on the
very day the plate was found."</p>

<p>No stone, I fear, marked the resting place of our engraver, but
to-day we can admire his skill, and say: Peace to his Ashes.</p>

<p>Yonder is a modest little headstone that many have passed

TO<br>
THE MEMORY<br>
OF<br>
HARRIET RODIUS,<br>
WHO<br>
DIED ON THE 14th DECEMBER,<br>
1838,<br>
AGED 18 YEARS.<br>
AFTER A SHORT ILLNESS OF FOUR DAYS.<br>
THIS INSCRIPTION IS SCULPTURED BY HER<br>
AFFLICTED HUSBAND; AS A LAST<br>
TRIBUTE HIS AFFECTION CAN<br>
OFFER TO HER MEMORY.</p>

<p>What a contrast there is between the lettering on this stone and
on McDonald's, and what a touch of pathos in the inscription, cut
by the artist, Charles Rodius himself, as the last tribute his
hands could pay to the memory of his young wife.</p>

<p>In the Sydney Art Gallery may be seen a number of portraits by
Rodius, among them being Queen Gooseberry, Henry Parkes, and Edward
Smith Hall, the dauntless editor of the <i>Monitor</i>. Charles
Rodius himself died on April 7, 1860, aged 56 years. The place of
his interment is not stated, but probably he was laid to rest in
the same grave as his young wife.</p>

<p>The friend who gave the tributes to the memory of Lewin and
McDonald, I opine from the moral aphorisms, was none other than
James Scott, the preacher. In the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> of March 3,
1820, we learn that the "Funeral Expenses of the late J. W. Lewin,
Esq., interred at the public expense, amounted to £86 ls. 2d." A
peculiar fact might be mentioned in regard to the deaths of Lewin
and McDonald. Lewin died on August 27, 1819, nearly a fortnight
before McDonald, yet McDonald is stated to have been the first
interment*.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* Lewin was first buried in the Old Cemetery
in George Street, then <i>reinterred</i> in Devonshire Street
cemetery after it opened.<br>

Dictionary of Biography</a>.]</p>

<p>Well over towards Elizabeth Street was the grave of Sir Francis
Forbes, the first Chief Justice. Originally there was an
inscription on either side of the stone, one being in Latin, the
other in English; both, unfortunately, had disappeared before we
came on the scene. Probably the epitaphs had been cut in marble,
and the cupidity of someone has deprived posterity of an historic
inscription. The services Sir Francis Forbes rendered Australia in
preserving the liberties of the Press in the time of Governor
Darling merit a monument to his memory. Born in 1784, the same year
in which Dr. Samuel Johnson died, our First Chief Justice passed
away on November 9, 1841, a date familiar to most of us for many
years as the Prince of Wales' Birthday.</p>

<p>Near the centre of the ground we see the handsome monument
erected to the memory of Sir James Dowling, the second Chief
Justice. Born in London in 1787, he arrived with his family in
Sydney in 1828. He died in 1844 at the early age of 57 years. When
first erected, this monument so exceeded in magnificence everything
that had preceded it, that for a long time it was the talk of the
town.</p>

<p>A grandson of Sir James, Mr. J. Arthur Dowling, was the second
Secretary of this Society, and did yeoman service during the years
1904 to 1908.</p>

<p>Over against the Barrack wall is the grave of John Stephen, the
first Puisne Judge of this colony. He was born in London in 1771,
and died in 1833, aged 62 years. His widow survived him for 30
years, dying in 1863, in her 89th year. One of his sons, Sir Alfred
Stephen, became our third Chief Justice.</p>

<p>In the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> of May 29, 1830, appears the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"The timber on the Petersham estate (the
property of Dr. Wardell) has been valued at the extraordinary sum
of £40,000. It comprises two or three thousand acres, and is in
some places very thickly wooded. Incredible as the estimate may
appear, we are inclined, from the increasing scarcity and dearness
of firewood, to think it not much above the mark."</p>

<p>On September 7, 1834, Dr. Wardell, while riding through his fine
estate, encountered three runaway convicts, one of whom shot him
dead.</p>

<p>The story is fully told in the newspapers of the time, and is
too long for repetition here. Some matters connected with his
funeral and grave may, however, be new to the reader. The following
extract is from an account of his funeral in the <i>Gazette</i> of
September 13, 1834:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"About one o'clock the procession reached the
Sydney toll-gate, from the late residence of the deceased at
Petersham, and immediately moved off for the burial ground in the
following order:&mdash;Eight mutes, two and two; a plume of
feathers and pages preceded the hearse containing the body, which
was drawn by six black horses. Next followed the carriage of the
deceased, closely covered with black cloth, and drawn by the four
grey horses, which the deceased used to drive in his life time. A
carriage covered also with black cloth succeeded, containing the
chief mourners: William Charles Wentworth and John Mackaness,
Esqrs. The mournful cavalcade was flanked by a train of chaises and
horsemen...When arrived at the gate of the cemetery, the coffin,
which was covered with black cloth, and bore upon it several gilt
mountings, was removed from the hearse, and being covered with two
rich velvet palls, the bearers of which were His Honour Mr. Justice
Dowling, the Attorney and Solicitor Generals, the High Sheriff, the
Commissioner of the Court of Requests, the First Police Magistrate,
and R. Johnston and W. Lawson, Esquires, proceeded to its final
resting place...<br>
<br>
"In this manner, preceded by the Rev. Richard Hill...the body was
carried to a vault near the site where lie the remains of the late
Mr. Justice Stephen."</p>

<p class="caption">A portion of the Sandhills Cemetery, showing the
Broken Column.<br>
<i>Photo by Mrs A G Foster.</i></p>

<p>The funeral of Dr. Wardell must have been a singularly
impressive one. But where shall we find his grave. The broken
fluted monument&mdash;now on the screen&mdash;is supposed to mark
the spot. As in the case of Judge Forbes, the tablets containing
the inscription had been removed. On the base was cut the one word,
Clewett, which was the name of the monumental mason. In 1839 a
marble tablet to the memory of Wardell was placed in St. James'
Church, where it still remains. A reference is made to it in the
<i>Gazette</i> of June 4, 1839:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"On Thursday last the remains of Dr. Wardell
were removed from the Sydney Burial Ground preparatory to their
removal to England.<br>
<br>
"This measure, it is said, has been determined upon by the
relatives of the deceased for the purpose of having the body
deposited in the family vault. A handsome marble tablet has been
constructed at the marble works of Mr. Clewett, Pitt Street, to the
memory of Dr. Wardell, which it is intended shall be placed in the
Church of St. James. The monument has the head of the doctor <i>in
alto relievo</i>, said to be a good likeness."</p>

<p>There is a problem here. The mason's name and the handsome
broken column seem to point to it as Wardell's. But the grave is
not near the Stephen vault, and, furthermore, we learn from the
<i>Gazette</i> that the remains of Dr. Wardell were exhumed for
removal to England. If this were done, the monument probably came
into the possession of the monumental mason, and at a later period
was re-erected over the grave of some other person. Or, on the
other hand, a difficulty might have arisen in regard to its
conveyance to England, and a new and better site chosen in the same
cemetery, and the body reinterred. But which of these things
happened, at present I cannot say.</p>

<p>The residence of Dr. Wardell, on the Petersham Estate, was at
the time of his death known as "Sarah Dell" Cottage. An ancient
building still standing on the Parramatta Road near the original
entrance to Dr. Wardell's estate, is known as "Petersham Cottage,"
and tradition says it is the cottage in which the doctor
resided.</p>

<p><br>
And now we stand before a slab bearing the name of Anthony Fenn
Kemp, the younger, who died in 1824, aged 23 years. The name of
this young man's father is a familiar one in our early history, but
it is not of him I wish first to speak. When the slab was raised
for removal to La Perouse a singular discovery was made. The stone
bore two inscriptions, one on top and one underneath. The hidden
inscription was to no less an exalted person than Judge Advocate
Ellis Bent.</p>

<p>For many years the remains of Ellis Bent and his friend Major
Ovens lay in one vault on Garden Island. From thence they were
removed to St. Thomas' Cemetery, North Sydney. Ellis Bent died in
November, 1815, and was buried in the first place in the old
cemetery, George Street. Later, a vault was prepared on Garden
Island, and thither his remains were conveyed. The original stone
became, I presume, the perquisite of the mason, who kept it until
an opportunity came to again use it. We are grateful to him for
saving for our perusal such an historic epitaph. The top part of
the slab was thus inscribed:</p>

<p class="cp">Sacred<br>
to the memory of<br>
Anty. Fenn Kemp,<br>
Son of Anty. Fenn Kemp,<br>
who departed this Life<br>
December 22nd, 1824,<br>
Aged 23 years &amp; 6 weeks.<br>
Also Judith Simpson, Aged 61 years,<br>
Died March 31st, 1836.<br>
James Lucas Simpson. Aged 40 Years.<br>
Died April, 1846.</p>

<p>In the <i>Australasian</i> of January 6, 1825, is this brief
announcement of young Kemp's death:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"On the 23 ult., at his mother's residence,
Cumberland Street, Rocks, Anthony Fenn Kemp."</p>

<p>Not far from the vault of Judge Stephen was an altar tomb
bearing the name of George Crossley, a man who figured prominently
in the events leading to the deposition of Governor Bligh. Crossley
was transported to Botany Bay for perjury. The circumstances have
often been related, and need not be repeated here. In Sydney his
legal attainments were much in demand, and Governor Bligh availed
himself of his services during his trouble with Macarthur. Crossley
died on March 19, 1823, in the 75th year of his age. It is a
singular coincidence that another remarkable perjurer lived in the
house formerly occupied by Crossley. In later years it became the
Metropolitan Hotel, Pitt Street, and it was here that the Tichborne
claimant stayed prior to his departure for England.</p>

<p>Speaking of the deposition of Governor Bligh, is a reminder that
his son-in-law, Captain John Putland, was buried here. This grave
originally was in old St. Phillip's Church, but when that building
was demolished, Putland's remains, which were enclosed in a leaden
coffin, found another resting place in the "Sandhills." They are
now at La Perouse. Putland died of consumption only two days before
the arrest of his father-in-law. His widow became the wife of
Lieut.-Colonel Maurice O'Connell, and a son of this marriage, Sir
Maurice, was for many years the President of the Legislative
Council of Queensland.</p>

<p>In writing of the early merchants, the name of Robert Campbell
comes first to the mind, and here we have the handsome monument
erected to one of the clan and a namesake. Robert Campbell, of the
wharf, lies in St. John's cemetery, Parramatta, but the family is
represented here by his nephew, Robert Campbell, of Bligh street,
who died on October 5, 1851, aged 62. The fine premises erected by
him show in many of the pictures of old Sydney, and are doubtless
remembered by many old residents.</p>

<p>The Union Club occupies the site of Campbell's house, in Bligh
Street, which was known as No. 8, and is stated to have been
erected in 1813.</p>

<p>A large piece of ground, not far from Robert Campbell's,
enclosed by a stout iron railing, contained two massive altar
stones. One was inscribed with the names of the Hutchinson family,
beginning with:</p>

<p class="cp">Abraham Hutchinson,<br>
Many years Superintendent of the Government Mills,<br>
who died in 1822, Aged 81.<br>
Also William Hutchinson, who<br>
passed away in 1846, in his 73rd year.</p>

<p>The adjoining stone bore the name of</p>

<p class="cp">DAVID BEVAN,<br>
Many years an Auctioneer in Sydney,<br>
who departed this life,<br>
the 23rd October, 1823.<br>
Aged 75 years.</p>

<p>Mr. Bevan's cottage was in George Street, next door to the
Lumber Yard, or, as we would say to-day, a little south of Bridge
Street. Here, it is said, were planted some of the earliest pines
brought from Norfolk Island. The picture of the Tank Stream,
looking from Hunter Street, in 1843, by Skinner Prout, shows some
well-grown pines in this locality, and are probably some of those
referred to.</p>

<p>In the days of Bligh, perhaps no business firm was better known
in Sydney than that of Lord, Kable, and Underwood. Lord himself was
a most enterprising man. Apart from the success he achieved as an
auctioneer, he should be remembered as one of our earliest
manufacturers.</p>

<p>In Maclehose's "Picture of Sydney," in 1839, we find this
reference to him:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"We believe Mr. Lord to have been the first to
attempt to manufacture the wool grown within the Colony; but
although we may have some doubt as to his priority as a
manufacturer there can be no question as to his success&mdash;for
upon examining a sample of the production of his looms, especially
his blankets, they may properly be compared to those of the great
mart so celebrated in England for this article...As a clothier, Mr.
Lord has for a considerable time afforded employment to about sixty
persons, and his productions from the staple commodity of the
Colony, although confined to coarser description, fully confirm our
remarks in respect to his blanket manufactory."</p>

<p>The death of Simeon Lord is thus recorded in the <i>Gazette</i>
of January 30, 1840:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"DEATH.&mdash;Yesterday, at his late
residence, Banks House, Botany, Simeon Lord, Esq., aged sixty-nine
years; deeply lamented by a large circle of relations and
friends."</p>

<p>Simeon Lord's grave was near Samuel Terry's, both being close
against the brick wall separating the Church of England and Roman
Catholic sections. It was a plain slab with a slate tablet inset,
and surrounded by an iron railing. The slate tablet was broken; but
the pieces were there, and when placed in position enabled me to
copy the epitaph, which read:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">Sacred to the Memory of<br>
SIMEON LORD,<br>
Formerly of<br>
Macquarie Place,<br>
and late of<br>
Banks House Botany,<br>
who departed this life,<br>
Jan'y 29th, 1840.<br>
Aged 69 years.<br>
Also of<br>
EDWARD SIMEON BLACK,<br>
Second son of<br>
John Henry Black,<br>
Cashier of the Bank of New South Wales,<br>
who departed this Life<br>
Sept. 23rd, 1846.<br>
Aged 9 years 1 month and 1 day.<br>
Also of<br>
LOUISA MARIA BLACK,<br>
Second daughter of the above.<br>
John Henry Black,<br>
who departed this life<br>
Oct. 11th, 1846.<br>
Aged 13 years 9 months<br>
and 3 days.</p>

<p>Simeon Lord died a wealthy man, his estate being valued at
£20,000. One could wish that a finer memorial had marked his
resting place. But the house he erected in Macquarie-place stood
for a hundred years as a monument to his enterprise and his faith
in the future of New South Wales.</p>

<p>Near the centre of the cemetery stood the family vault of Joseph
Underwood, who arrived in Sydney in 1807. Interesting particulars
of his career may be seen in Mr. R. E. Kemp's paper, read before
the Society in April, 1917; and also in Mr. C. H. Bertie's chapters
on George Street, which appeared in the <i>Sydney Mail</i>,
beginning in July this year. Joseph Underwood died on August 28,
1833, aged 54. In the vault was buried his wife, Charlotte, who
died in 1818; his eldest son, Thomas James, who died in 1867; also
Mary Ann Underwood, the wife of James Underwood, and some of their
children.</p>

<p>The partner of Lord and James Underwood was one Henry Kable who,
with his wife, Susannah Holmes, arrived in the First Fleet. In
Bonwick's life of the Rev. Richard Johnson is related an exciting
episode in their career. Kable and his wife lie in the churchyard
of St. Matthew's, Windsor, but we have a link with this historic
couple in the person of Dr. James Mileham, whose epitaph is of
sufficient interest to be printed in full:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">Sacred to the Memory of<br>
JAMES MILEHAM, ESQUIRE,<br>
Justice of the Peace and Senior Assistant Surgeon<br>
of this Territory,<br>
who died September 28th, 1824.<br>
Aged 60 years.</p>

<p>He arrived in these colonies in the year 1796, and from that
time, so early after the first establishment of a British colony on
these shores, up to that of his lamented demise, was
uninterruptedly occupied in faithfully and efficiently serving his
King and the community in which he lived, evincing in the
discharge, whether of his important public duties or those of
private life, that good sense, urbanity and justice, which, while
they attached to him every person who knew him, did honour to him
as an individual, and were not less honourable to that society of
which he so long continued both an efficient and respected
member&mdash;this Stone is dedicated by his much-afflicted
Widow.</p>

<p>The link I spoke of is found in the fact that Dr. Mileham
married Susannah, a daughter of Henry Kable, who, in her
relationship as a "much-afflicted widow," drew a pension from the
Imperial Government for the remarkable period of sixty years. Her
husband died in 1824, but his widow survived till 1885, reaching
the ripe age of 89 years.</p>

<p>I have said that the graves of Simeon Lord and Samuel Terry were
near each other. Both were young when they came to the colony. Both
succeeded in gaining wealth, but in the gentle art of making money
Terry not only outstripped Lord, but every other competitor.
Through his marriage and methods he acquired a fortune, the value
of which was sworn not to exceed £200,000 He died on February 22,
1838&mdash;the jubilee year of the colony&mdash;in his 62nd year.
Much has been written about Sam. Terry, but it comes not within the
scope of this paper. The tomb and remains were removed to
Rookwood.</p>

<p>The Terry vault bore the following particulars regarding the
names and ages of the family:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">MR. SAMUEL TERRY,<br>
died 22 Feby., 1838,<br>
Aged 62 years.<br>

<p>Let us turn from these memorials of wealth to contemplate the
grave of George Howe, the printer of Australia's first newspaper.
No lofty column recording this fact marks the spot, and one could
have searched as vainly in the old cemetery as in the new to find a
stone bearing his name. I think it is a matter of regret that the
journalists of New South Wales permit the remains of the Father of
the Australian Press to lie in a grave unmarked by his name, and
virtually unknown. I hope that a movement will soon be inaugurated
to remove this reproach, and that a column suitably inscribed will
be erected to his memory.</p>

<p>The grave of George Howe in the Sandhills was of the altar type,
but the top slab containing the inscription disappeared many years
ago. The only epitaph was on the western end. It recorded
that:&mdash;</p>

died on the 14th of May, 1811,<br>
Aged 32 years.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Wills and Thomas Reibey were partners in various
commercial enterprises in Sydney. Both, unhappily, died in early
manhood in the same year. The widow of Thomas Reibey never
remarried, but Mrs. Wills, some eighteen months after the death of
her husband, once again entered into the bonds of matrimony, and on
October 5, 1812, became the wife of George Howe. This explains why
the name of Edward Wills appears on the stone.</p>

<p>Probably when the new vault was made in this cemetery to receive
the body of her second husband, the widow had the remains of her
first husband removed from the George Street cemetery and
reinterred here. George Howe arrived in Sydney by the <i>Royal
Admiral</i>, in November, 1800, and on March 5, 1803, he printed
the first Australian newspaper. With second-hand, nearly worn-out
type, and a scant supply of indifferent paper, with a number of
subscribers as ready to read his paper, as they were reluctant to
pay their subscriptions, the position of George Howe was not an
enviable one. Let me quote his own words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper"><i>The Sydney Gazette</i> commenced printing
on the 5th of March, 1803; its commencement was under the present
Printer, who had enough to do to support it, for it supported not
him, and the first ten years of the Paper was, indeed, a time of
vicissitude. He bought the Paper at a very dear price; he
distributed his type; he invented and obtained new matter without
any auxiliary assistance; he worked the Paper off at press; and he
afterwards delivered it to the Sydney subscribers. A paper in
England under 700 in number is sensibly a losing concern, and what
must be a paper here within half the number and half of that unpaid
for?"</p>

<p>But I must hark back to the Sandhills. In this vault was buried
George Howe himself, who died 11 May 1821, aged 52. In the old
<i>Gazette</i> Office, George Street, near Charlotte-place, was
erected a small marble tablet to his memory, which was thus
inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">In memory<br>
of<br>
GEORGE HOWE,<br>
A Creole of St. Kitts,<br>
Born 1769, Died May 11, 1821.<br>
Aged LII*.<br>
He introduced into Australia<br>
The Art of Printing;<br>

and was the<br>
First Government Printer;<br>
Besides which<br>
His Charity Knew no Bounds.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* i.e. 52 years.]</p>

<p>Unfortunately, no trace of this tablet can be found. In the same
vault with George Howe was buried his two wives and his son Robert,
who conducted the <i>Gazette</i> after his father's death. Later,
however, the remains of Robert Howe were removed to a new vault
some little distance away. Upon the leaden coffin was a small
copper plate bearing this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">ROBERT HOWE,<br>
Government Printer.<br>
Born in London, 30th June, 1795.<br>
Accidentally Drowned off<br>
Fort Macquarie,<br>
January 29th, 1829.<br>
Aged 34 years.</p>

<p>In a Government Order, dated April 25, 1809, it is stated
that:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Complaints having been made to the
Lieutenant-Governor, that numerous frauds have been committed by
individuals repairing on board ships, on their arrival at this
port, and personating others, by which they have obtained
possession of letters and parcels, to the great injury of those for
whom they were intended, the Lieutenant-Governor, in order to
prevent the practice of such frauds in future, has been pleased to
establish an office at which all parcels and letters addressed to
the inhabitants of this Colony shall be deposited, previous to
their distribution, which office shall be under the direction of
Mr. Isaac Nichols (assistant to the Naval Officer) who has entered
into security for the faithful discharge of the trust reposed in
him."</p>

<p>Isaac Nichols arrived in Sydney in the year 1791, and prospered
in the land of his adoption. In 1805, he married Miss Rosetta
Julien. Three sons were born of this union, the second and most
distinguished being George Robert Nichols, who was born in
September, 1809&mdash;the year his father received his appointment
as postmaster&mdash;and died in September, 1857.</p>

<p>It was an unfortunate thing for the boys that they were deprived
of the guidance of a shrewd and excellent father, when the eldest
was only about thirteen years of age.</p>

<p>Isaac Nichols' plans for the future of his boys are revealed in
this extract from his will: "It being my will that each of my sons
shall receive as good an education as possible, I desire my
executors to send them to England by the earliest opportunity...to
be well and classically instructed, as will qualify them for such
liberal profession best suited for their genius. I wish that my two
elder sons may be brought up to the profession of physic, being
placed with eminent practitioners, where their morals, as well as
their studies, may be strictly attended to."</p>

<p>His youngest son he wished articled to a solicitor of
respectability, who would attend to his morals, as well as his
professional instruction. Space will not permit me to follow the
careers of those three boys, but after life's fitful fever, they
each and all were laid in the family vault in the Sandhills
Cemetery. On the stone is the name of Isaac Nichols, who died on
November 8, 1819. Also of his widow, who had remarried, his
daughter-in-law, and a grandchild. The names of his three sons were
not on the stone when the photograph shown was taken, but have been
cut on the side of the stone since its removal to Rookwood.</p>

<p>When Isaac Nichols received the appointment of Postmaster he was
living in his new house in High Street, known to-day as George
Street North. On the keystone above the door was cut his initials
and the date of erection. Some difference of opinion has existed as
to the date cut on the keystone. The picture reveals it to have
been:</p>

<p class="cp">I * N<br>
MAY 30,<br>
1808.</p>

<p class="caption">Tombstone of Isaac Nichols, who died Nov. 8,

<i>Photo by Mrs. A. G. Foster.</i></p>

<p>The fact that Nichols was an assistant to the Naval Officer, and
had built a fine commodious house near the water, and in the centre
of commercial Sydney, were no doubt important factors in gaining
him the distinction of being Australia's first Postmaster.</p>

<p>As in the case of George Howe, no portrait of Nichols is known
to exist. I should conceive him to have been tall. His three sons,
it is said, were tall, handsome men. Many still remember his second
son, George Robert Nichols, a noted lawyer and politician, who
became a member of the first responsible Government.</p>

<p>A nephew and namesake, the late Mr. George Robert Nichols, of
Llandilo, near St. Marys, was a member of this Society, and his
death in October last is a distinct loss to the cause of Australian
history.</p>

<p>Between the grave of Isaac Nichols and the caretaker's cottage
stood a fine Norfolk Island pine. A few paces west of this tree
brought us to the altar tomb of Mary Reibey. Much has been written
concerning her remarkable business aptitude and successful career.
As most of it is familiar to all students of our history I need say
but little about it here. I have had the pleasure of meeting some
of Mrs. Reibey's descendants, who bear testimony to the keenness of
her mind and the goodness of her heart.</p>

<p>Evidently, Mrs. Reibey admired the building erected by Mr.
Nichols, because in 1812, in the first year of her widowhood, she
erected a similar building immediately adjoining Nichols on the
southern side. This land was granted to her by Governor Macquarie,
who stipulated that the land must not be sold for five years, and
that a good and sufficient dwelling-house of brick or stone should
be built within the said period. The building was to be 50 feet in
length, 16 feet in width and 2 stories high. Not only did Mrs.
Reibey admire Mr. Nichols' house as a whole, but she liked the idea
of the initials and date on the keystone; and so, on the stone
above the door, she had engraved her initials and date of
erection:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">M. R.<br>
1812.</p>

<p>Subsequently Mrs. Reibey erected several other buildings in
Sydney, and her enterprise deserved the high praise given to her in
the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> of December 19, 1827, which
said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"In addition to improvements to George Sstreet
within the last year by Mr. Barnett Levy, Mr. Morris, Mr. Simmonds
and others, we cannot help noticing the spacious and elegant
mansion very recently run up by Mrs. Reibey adjoining the Custom
House. What between the erection of splendid edifices and the
ramification of children and grandchildren, no respectable colonist
has done more than Mrs. Reibey to 'Advance Australia.'"</p>

<p>The building referred to by the <i>Gazette</i> was erected on
the western side of the Tank Stream, just south of the present Post
Office. It was known for many years as Reibey Cottage.</p>

<p>I cannot here give particulars of the other "splendid edifices"
Mrs. Reibey caused to be built, but there is one other to which I
must refer. In Station Street, Newtown, may still be seen a
picturesque two-storied building, standing back some distance from
the road, half hidden from view by stately trees and clustering
vines. Its name is now "Reibey House." This was Mrs. Reibey's last
residence, and it was here, on the 30th May, 1855, that her
singularly romantic life came to a close.</p>

<p>The inscription on the family vault in the Sandhills read
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">Sacred<br>
to the Memory of<br>
MR. THOMAS REIBEY,<br>

"I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me:<br>
Write&mdash;From henceforth, blessed are the dead which die in the
Lord,<br>
even so saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labours."</p>

<p>If I may be pardoned for introducing a little personal history,
I should like to say that in Mrs. Reibey's vault lies the genesis
of this lecture. It was while standing beside her grave that my
wife and I determined, with pen and camera, to preserve for
posterity&mdash;some at least&mdash;of the historic graves of the
pioneers. This work was begun early in 1899, and occupied a full
two years' of leisure time.</p>

<p>Several stones were removals from the old George Street
Cemetery, one of the most interesting being that of the Bunker
vault, which is thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">Sacred<br>

Eldest Son of the late Capt. Fisk,<br>
Grandson and Nephew of the above,<br>
Who Departed This Life<br>
November 28th, 1833,<br>
Aged 21 Years.</p>

<p>The name of Capt. Bunker can be traced almost to the foundation
of the colony. For some time his home was on the "Rocks," and the
name Bunker's Hill is derived from that fact. He had a large grant
of land near Liverpool, which he named Collingwood, after Lord
Collingwood, to whom his first wife was related.</p>

<p>His third wife&mdash;for he was thrice married&mdash;was the
widow of Capt. William Minchin, police magistrate, formerly a
captain in the 102nd Regt. Captain Bunker passed his declining
years at Liverpool, and there can be found his grave.</p>

<p>A familiar name appears on a well-preserved altar stone. From it
we learn that Joseph Nobbs died on December 12, 1844, aged 90
years, after a residence of 43 years in the colony. A relative of
that early pioneer is the Hon. John Nobbs, M.L.C., who for many
years represented Granville in the Legislative Assembly, and was
one of the founders of this Society.</p>

<p>Opposite the entrance gates, a little removed from the footpath,
was the grave of Allan Cunningham, botanist and explorer. A plain
slab covered the remains, and simply recorded his name, age, and
date of death:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">Sacred<br>
To the Memory of<br>
ALLAN CUNNINGHAM, Esq.,<br>
Departed this Life<br>
On the 27th June, 1839,<br>
Aged 48 Years.</p>

<p>The friends and admirers of Allan Cunningham erected in 1844, in
the Botanic Gardens, an obelisk to his memory. When the cemetery
was resumed Mr. J. H. Maiden, the Curator of the Gardens, had the
remains of Cunningham placed in a casket and inserted in a cavity
cut in the obelisk. The details are given in the <i>Sydney Morning
Herald</i> of June 29, 1901:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"The recent opening of his brick grave brought
to light a piece of his skull, about four inches in diameter, a
piece of the large bone of the arm, and some other fragments. These
were placed in a leaden casket 10 inches long, 5 inches broad, and
4 inches deep, which was inserted in an excavation made in the
upper portion of the obelisk and the whole covered with a marble
slab, which bears the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"The remains of Allan Cunningham were interred
in the Devonshire Street Cemetery, in July, 1839, from which they
were reverently removed on the 25th of May, 1901, and placed within
this obelisk. The placing in the obelisk took place on the 26th
June inst."</p>

<p>Could Cunningham wish to sleep his last sleep in a more
beautiful spot, surrounded by the trees and flowers, to whose study
he had devoted so many years of his life? Standing in front of this
obelisk you might observe a fine willow tree growing on the edge of
the tiny lake, which encircles the monument. If you turn to the
<i>Sydney Gazette</i> of May 20, 1830, you may read
this:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Mr. Fraser, the Colonial Botanist, has a
cutting from the willow which hangs over the tomb of Napoleon at
St. Helena, and is about to plant it on one of those miniature
islands constructed by him in the pond in the new botanical garden,
which he is laying out at Farm Cove."</p>

<p>And so at Farm Cove, as well as at La Perouse, we have a link of
sentiment binding us to the great French nation.</p>

<p>We have yet another in the grave of William Balcombe. A little
to the west of Cunningham's, in the Sandhills, was another plain
slab, containing this brief epitaph:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">Here Lie the Remains of<br>
WILLIAM BALCOMBE, Esq.,<br>
Late Colonial Treasurer of New South Wales.<br>
He Departed this Life on the 19th<br>
Day of March, 1829,<br>
In the 49th Year of his Age.</p>

<p>Mr. Balcombe arrived in Sydney in the time of Governor Brisbane,
and occupied the fine old house at the corner of Bent and O'Connell
streets, on the site of which the Colonial Sugar Company has its
offices. Prior to coming to Sydney Mr. Balcombe held a Government
position on St. Helena, and was thus frequently brought into
contact with the great Napoleon, who, it is said, became attached
to a lovely little child, the daughter of Mr. Balcombe.</p>

<p>And now let us glance at some tragedies of Old Sydney. Here is a
small headstone recording a death by snakebite:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">Sacred<br>
To the Memory of<br>
WILLIAM YARDLEY,<br>
Who lost his life by the bite of a snake,<br>
on the 5th December, 1824,<br>
Aged 45 Years.<br>
He was a Brother Fellow Odd,<br>
We hope his Soul, at rest with God.</p>

<p>Interesting accounts are given in the papers of the day. Sydney
had then the two newspapers, the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> and the
<i>Australian</i>. The former paper, in its issue of December 9,
1824, says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"On Monday last an inquest was held on the
body of William Yardley, who died from the bite of a snake. It
appeared that the deceased was a stonemason in the employ of Mr.
Robert Cooper, merchant, of George Street, and worked on the
distillery grounds at Blackwattle Swamp, on the Parramatta-road.
While in the act of gathering some flowers or shrubs, as the story
goes on, Friday morning last, he felt something prick his leg, and
between 5 and 10 minutes afterwards fell to the ground with an
insupportable pain that struck across the forehead. From the
symptoms it was inferred that he had been bitten by a snake.<br>
<br>
"He did not see the reptile, but in a few moments fainted, in which
state he was found, and quickly carried home to Upper Castlereagh
Street. The usual remedies were instantly applied, and an incision
of the affected part made, previous to which Dr. Bland had induced
some natives, who were on the spot, to suck the wound, agreeable to
their usual custom on these occasions. This being followed by
considerable relief, but not having perfectly removed the symptoms,
the bitten part without any loss of time, was cut out, and a
cupping glass immediately applied over the bleeding wound, which
operation was followed by additional very serviceable relief. The
volatile alkali and other stimulants were now exhibited, the lunar
caustic applied to the spot of the incision, and the case otherwise
treated agreeable to the general practice. The unfortunate man was
kept walking from the time the surgeon attended him until the
morning of his death, as hopes were entertained of life if he could
have continued on his feet for 48 hours after the bite; but nature,
being exhausted, and the poison having had time to diffuse its
deadly power before counteraction could take place, the poor man
went off into a slumber, and soon fell into the sleep of death. The
body shortly presented a most shocking spectacle, and the blood
flowed profusely from the ears. Verdict: Died by the bite of a
snake."</p>

<i>Photo by Mrs. A. G. Foster.</i></p>

<p>To show that even in those days newspapers differed from one
another, I subjoin the extract from the <i>Australian</i>, then in
its first year of publication, under date December 16,
1824:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"On Friday morning (3rd inst.) a man named
William Yardley, in the employ of Mr. Robert Cooper, was stung on
the leg by a snake. He did not see the reptile, but felt an acute
pain, occasioned, as he at the moment imagined, by a prick from a
grass tree, of which he took no notice till, growing faint, he,
with difficulty, reached his home. It appears that the accident
occurred while employed in his labour as a stonemason at Mr. Robert
Cooper's new building, on the South Head-road. It was only when the
poison began to operate and the unfortunate man had fallen down
several times that his companions began to suspect what had really
befallen him. Mr. Bland was sent for, but being professionally
engaged at the time, nearly an hour elapsed before he was able to
attend to the unfortunate man. The wounded part was immediately cut
out, but not until the venom had contaminated the whole mass of
blood. All means were resorted to to counteract the bite of this
poisonous reptile. Strong stimulants were applied externally and
internally, and the patient was kept walking day and night, but all
proved ineffectual. The poison had penetrated into the springs of
life, before the unfortunate man discovered the nature of his
ailment. A coroner's inquest was held on Monday on the body.
Verdict: Died in consequence of the bite of a snake."</p>

<p>It seems most probable that Mr. Robert Cooper was having
constructed his private house, "Juniper Hall," South Head-road, and
the distillery in Parramatta Street at the same time.</p>

<p>The headstone of Samuel Lepton, who was shot dead by a constable
named Byron, used to attract a good deal of attention. Some
misapprehension exists in regard to the actual circumstances, and
more odium has been attached to Byron than I think he deserves.
Briefly, the facts are these:&mdash;In the early days&mdash;owing
to the large numbers of convicts in Sydney&mdash;watch-houses (or
roundhouses, as they were frequently called) were placed at various
points, and the constable in charge had the right to challenge
persons passing as to their identity and business. Prisoners of the
Crown had to show their tickets of leave or emancipation papers.
Failing to give satisfactory replies, a person might be arrested
and lodged in the Round House, a cell for that purpose, being
provided underground. On May 29, 1825, about dusk, Lepton, with a
companion named Richard Robinson, were walking along the
Parramatta-road to Sydney, when they were challenged by Byron. The
story of what then happened may be told in the words of Lepton's
companion:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Richard Robinson deposed that he was in
company with deceased on the Parramatta-road on the evening of the
29th of May last; was proceeding from Parramatta to Sydney, when,
on passing a round-house, within three miles from Sydney, prisoner
came out with a pistol in his hand and approached towards them. On
looking witness in the face he observed, 'You are not the man.' He
then looked at deceased (Lepton), and enquired who he was. He said:
'I will tell you who I am. You remember, I suppose, to have worked
with me in loading stone for Jenny Muckle.' Prisoner then
remembered him, and suffered both to proceed on their way, and
returned back to his house; deceased then said that it was a hard
case to be stopped by constable, and that the prisoner, Byron, knew
him to be a free man. The constable returned and asked what he was
grumbling about, and insisted on seeing his certificate of freedom,
which deceased said had been left by him in Sydney. Prisoner said:
'If you cannot produce it, I will take you into custody to the
round-house.' Not more than three minutes had elapsed from the
prisoner leaving them the first time and his return; deceased and
witness had some words together respecting his going in custody to
the watch-house, but was at length prevailed upon to go."</p>

<p>What happened in the round-house was told by the prisoner Byron,
who said he requested Lepton to go down into a place underground
assigned to individuals who may be taken into charge. Lepton
refused, and snatched up a gun which was in the room. Byron told
him the piece was unloaded, and thus Lepton, observing the door
half open, rushed out. Byron followed and fired his pistol,
apparently without effect. He then returned to the round-house,
procured a musket which he fired, and Lepton fell&mdash;never to
rise again.</p>

<p class="cp">Sacred<br>
To the Memory of<br>
SAMUEL LEPTON,<br>
Who Departed this Life June<br>
20th, 1825, Aged 27 Years.<br>
The wicked Byron who shot me,<br>
The ALMIGHTY JUDGE will shortly see.<br>
And I, the witness, shall be there,<br>
The truth against him to declare.<br>
That righteous Judge shall hear my case,<br>
And doom him to his own place.<br>
That wise Creator, who is good,<br>
Commands us all to shed no blood.<br>
And those who do He'll not forgive,<br>
His laws decree such shall not live.<br>
Byron, prepare to meet thy doom;<br>
The awful summons soon must come,<br>
When you must answer for my blood,<br>
Before thy MAKER and thy GOD.</p>

<p>From the evidence it is clear that Lepton's "back answer" was in
no slight measure responsible for the tragedy. Byron had returned
to the round-house, leaving Lepton and his companion free to
continue their walk into Sydney. But Lepton let his annoyance
overcome his prudence, and began to say things. That brought the
constable back, and resulted in the arrest and tragic death. There
are several matters of interest connected with the case not
generally known. Lepton's name is variously stated in the
newspapers to have been Upton, Lupton, and Lapton. A Mr. Anthony
Best had the stone erected, and the lines written.</p>

<p>A singular error in the date is carved on the stone, June 20,
but as a matter of fact the tragedy took place on the 29th of May.
From this we might infer that the stone was not erected until some
considerable time after the occurrence. As may be seen in the
photograph, the surface of the stone was flaking off 18 years ago,
and the time cannot be far distant when this quaint relic of an
old-time tragedy will have quite disappeared.</p>

<p>Nearly opposite the entrance gates was a well-preserved
headstone of an attractive design, which bore an inscription that
for quaintness of diction appealed to me more than Lepton's.</p>

<p>This stone, after seventy years of exposure to the elements,
showed no signs of decay, and may last for many years yet to
come.</p>

JOHN WARD,<br>
Who was Accidentally Shot on<br>
CHRISTMAS MORNING, A.D., 1830,<br>
Aged 30 Years.<br>
<br>
Reader as this Stone you View,<br>
Let a Tear, in pity fall.<br>
Ah, think how Sudden was his Fate,<br>
Shot by a Musket Ball.<br>
Into his Maker's Presence borne away,<br>
without a Moment to Repent or Pray.<br>
Though Pious he was and Learned in fact,<br>
just think what a man Should be,<br>
and he was that.</p>

<p><i>The Sydney Gazette</i>, December 28, 1830, contains an
account of the accident which&mdash;omitting a couple of
lines&mdash;reads thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Shocking Catastrophe.&mdash;A most
distressing occurrence, displaying the sad effects resulting from
the horrid practice of drinking parties, so prevalent among the
lower orders in this Colony, took place about two o'clock on the
morning of Christmas day. Several persons had assembled on the
previous evening to have a carousal, by way of introducing the
season, in a small house, situated where the old toll-bar used to
be at the commencement of the South Head-road. After drinking to
excess for several hours, some of them began what is commonly
called 'larking,' and imprudently laid hold of a loaded musket that
stood in the room. While they were struggling for this weapon it
was struck against the ground, by which the stock was broken, and
it went off, the contents lodging in the abdomen of a poor fellow
belonging to the Prisoners' Barracks...and after lingering for a
few hours, he expired at the General Hospital in great agony. He
declared before his death that the transaction was purely
accidental."</p>

<p>I do not know who composed the lines that embellish this
headstone, nor what virtues or vices he considered necessary to
make a man as he "should be," but after reading the circumstances
under which the late Mr. John Ward crossed into the Land of
Shadows, one may not, perhaps, question the extent of his learning,
but may very reasonably doubt the depth of his piety.</p>

<p>When it was determined to resume the cemetery as the site of a
new railway station, large numbers of persons, out of curiosity, or
because their ancestors were buried there, visited the cemetery. We
often smiled to hear the remarks about the wonderful state of
preservation of many inscriptions, and, perchance, some of my
audience might ask whether it was due to the remarkable quality of
the paint used in those days or to the constant care and tender
solicitude evinced by some of the descendants of the pioneers. To
both credit shall be freely given. But there was a third

<p class="caption">Mr Foster renovating an inscription (left) and the renovated inscription (right)

<p>Governor Bourke erected a monument over the remains of seventeen
persons, comprising officers, crew, and passengers of the barque,
<i>Charles Eaton</i>, who, after escaping from the total wreck of
that vessel, on August 15, 1834, were massacred by the natives of
the islands on which they landed. The remains were recovered by
H.M. Colonial Schooner <i>Isabella</i>, and interred in this vault,
November 17, 1836.</p>

<p>There were many tragedies of Old Sydney that were not caused by
snakebite, shot, or shipwreck&mdash;tragedies that could be traced
to envy, malice, and persecution were none the less fatal, when a
sensitive mind was the target and venom the shaft. A pathetic
example is indicated in the case of the solicitor, Thomas
Amos:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">Sacred<br>
to the Memory of<br>
THOMAS STERROP AMOS, Esqre.,<br>
Solicitor of this Colony,<br>
Who deceased the 9th day of Novr., 1819,<br>
in the 42nd year of his Age,<br>
The Victim<br>
of deeply wounded feelings.<br>
Heu! flebilis...id falis oppressus<br>
Duguis Damnatus iniguis in sub Judice Summo!</p>

<p>Age and weather had caused part of the stone to flake off,
rendering some of the Latin inscription indecipherable.</p>

<p>Let us turn to the account of his death, as given in the
<i>Sydney Gazette</i> of November 13, 1819:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"On Tuesday, at his residence, in Pitt Street,
after a short illness, Thomas S. Amos, Esq., late Solicitor in the
Courts of Civil Judicature; a gentleman whose suavity of manners in
private life was calculated daily to increase the numbers of his
friends. He had been in the Colony between three and four years,
and independent of his legal practice, had embarked to some extent
on agricultural pursuits. Two youthful sons, who accompanied him
into this colony&mdash;and both are now at a grammar school, are
left in a country where they have no remaining relative sadly to
deplore the departure of a parent in whose affection their early
youth passed happily away. The funeral took place early on Thursday
afternoon at the new burial ground, and was most respectably
attended. The two orphans followed the bier as chief mourners, and
in succession proceeded all the magistrates of Sydney, and most if
not the whole of the civil officers in the town, and the sentiment
of regret was general."</p>

<p>Not a word in the above paragraph reveals by whom or in what
manner the feelings of Amos were so deeply wounded as to cause or
contribute to his death. But we must remember that the
<i>Gazette</i> was not a free unfettered paper, having the will and
the power to expose wrong-doing in high places, and so we wait
awhile until the <i>Monitor</i> is founded, having for its editor
the fearless outspoken champion of the liberty of the
Press&mdash;Edward Smith Hall, whose memory deserves a monument.
Now, take up the <i>Monitor</i>, of 1829, and in its issue of
September 26 you will find this:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"The pension of £400 a year given to Mr.
Barron Field, whose conduct when Judge here excited general
dissatisfaction, especially in levying fees on suitors, which he
had no more right to levy, than the highwayman has to levy money on
the highway; and whose conduct to the late Mr. Solicitor Amos will
never be erased from the tablet of men's memories, ought to be
petitioned against. If ever a House of Assembly be granted the
Colony, and we obtain the privilege of disbursing our own money,
this pension will be struck out of the list the very first Colonial
Budget that is opened in our Australian Commons."</p>

<p>Not far away from the grave of Amos we meet with another of
these singular epitaphs, which begins in this wise:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">HENRY KITCHEN, Esqre.,<br>
Architect,<br>
formerly pupil of the justly<br>
Celebrated JAMES WYATT, Esqre., deceased.<br>
Died April 8th, 1822,<br>
Aged 29 Years.</p>

<p>Subjected almost from the hour of his landing in these Colonies
to that of his death, to a series of the most relentless and
unmerciful oppressions, a severe and sudden illness contracted in
the too-ardent pursuit of his profession, snatched him prematurely
to the grave. At a time, too, when to render his fate the more to
be lamented, a change, the most propitious for the Colony, was but
just developing his superior talents, and that promised to him many
years of much happiness, and ultimately of fame and honour in his
scientific Labours. By these Colonies he is regretted as a
professional loss not easily to be retrieved by his friends, as a
friend, for whom his misfortunes, gentle manners, and cultivated
genius had contributed to excite the highest respect and
regard.</p>

<p class="cp">Speo vix pr dara refulsit. (<i>sic</i>)</p>

<p>Both these men evidently suffered persecution, whatever shape it
might have taken&mdash;during the regime of Macquarie. If we accept
the epitaphs as fairly truthful descriptions of their character, we
should say they were just the types of men the colony stood in need
of, and should have received every consideration. The lack of
good-will shown towards them seems to support the charge made
against Macquarie that he showed an undue preference to the
emancipist class, for whom he wished to keep the colony as a kind
of preserve.</p>

<p>We are now nearing the end of our ramble, and many an historic
grave must remain unvisited, but remembering we are in a building
devoted to the purposes of education, I cannot bring my paper to a
close without showing the graves of two pioneer schoolmasters,
William Cape and Thomas Taber. They were situated at extreme parts
of the cemetery, Cape's on the east, near Elizabeth Street, and
Taber's on the west, against the Barrack wall. Seeing that Mr. S.
H. Smith is to read a paper on "William Timothy Cape, a Great
Educational Pioneer," I need do nothing more than give the epitaph
of William Cape and certain members of his family:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">Sacred<br>
To the Memory of<br>
WILLIAM CAPE, Esq.,<br>
Of O'Connell Street, Sydney,<br>
An old and much-respected Colonist,<br>
Died November 19th, 1847,<br>
Aged 74 Years.<br>
<br>
Also of<br>
Mr. HENRY CAPE,<br>
Third Son of the Above,<br>
Aged 36 Years.<br>
Formerly Master of the ship <i>Cape Packet</i><br>
and the steamer <i>Sovereign</i>.<br>
He sailed from Auckland, August, 1847,<br>
in the <i>Elizabeth Davis</i>, and,<br>
it is supposed, perished at Sea.<br>
Also of<br>
EMILY CAPE,<br>
Third daughter of the above,<br>
Who died after an illness of a few hours,<br>
February 3rd, 1842,<br>
Aged 28 Years.</p>

<p>Adjoining this headstone was another, thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">Sacred<br>
To the Memory of<br>
Arthur Charles,<br>
Third Son of<br>
William Timothy and Jane Cape.<br>
Died December 8th, 1842.<br>
Aged 6 Weeks.<br>
Also of<br>
Julius Sidney,<br>
A Twin Son of the Above,<br>
Died January,<br>
Aged 2 years and a half.<br>
In Memory also of<br>
Maria Jaques,<br>
Third Daughter of<br>
William Jaques, Esq.,<br>
Of H.M. Survey Department,<br>
and Sister of the Above<br>
Jane Cape.<br>
Died November 28th, 1839,<br>
Aged 22 Years.</p>

<p>A remarkable feature about the Cape epitaph is the fact that,
excepting William Cape, every death was the third son or daughter
in the several families.</p>

<p>In the <i>Sydney Herald</i>, of May 5, 1842, is thus recorded
the passing of one of Sydney's earliest schoolmasters:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Death&mdash;At his residence, Castlereagh
Street South, on Sunday morning, the 1st instant, at the advanced
age of seventy-nine years, Mr. Thomas Taber, deeply regretted by
his bereaved widow and a numerous family and descendants to the
fourth generation. Mr. Taber arrived in the year 1797, and was soon
afterwards appointed one of the masters of the Government School.
He was subsequently removed to Parramatta as clerk and
schoolmaster, and on the death of Mr. Barnes, who filled that
situation in Sydney, Mr. Taber was appointed his successor. He
continued to discharge these duties with credit to himself and
satisfaction to his superiors until the year 1828, when, after a
service of 26 years, he was by the kindness of the Government,
permitted to retire on a pension of £70 per annum."</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsay, a bookseller, was in business on the site, and
probably in the same building that Taber had for his school. Angus
and Robertson, the well-known booksellers, now occupy the site.</p>

<p>I am glad we preserved the quaint and poetic inscription that
was cut on the headstone of this pioneer schoolmaster, because I
fear that now nearly the whole of the epitaph has
disappeared:&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">Beneath the friendly Shadow<br>
of this Stone,<br>
Sheltered from all the Stormy ills of Life,<br>
Repose in Peace,<br>
The Mortal Remains<br>
of<br>
Mr. THOMAS TABER,<br>
Who,<br>
After a Residence in this Colony<br>
of 45 Years,<br>
During 26 of which he held the Situation<br>
of<br>
Parish Clerk and Schoolmaster,<br>
Departed this Life<br>
On the 1st Day of May,<br>
1842,<br>
Aged 79 Years.<br>
Resurgam.</p>

<p><br>
<a name="end" id="end"></a>The name Devonshire Street Cemetery
could fairly be applied to those sections which faced or extended
to that street, but is somewhat of a misnomer when describing the
original Burial Ground, which faced Belmore Park. For lack of a
better name, I and others refer to it as the "Sandhills Cemetery."
It was a sandhill when Macquarie chose it, and when the memorials
and remains of the pioneers were removed it became a sandhill once
again.</p>

<p>I have but two more views to show you. The first is a portion of
the cemetery near the centre, looking south. The tree in the
foreground was a fine specimen of a small native tree, "Monotoca
elliptica." I should think it to be as old as the cemetery itself,
but the banksias, geebungs, and five corners that once were its
companions have vanished, leaving no trace behind. The wall seen at
the back divides us from the Presbyterian portion. The tall
headstone just to the right of the obelisk is in the Presbyterian
ground.</p>

<p>The other picture is taken from the same position, but the scene
is changed, indeed. The tree still stands, but the last stone has
been removed. The cemetery is a memory only. The lady* seated on
the crooked bole of the "monotoca" wears a smile of satisfaction.
Her labour of love is finished. The grave of many a pioneer has
been preserved for posterity by her camera, and future generations
will be able, as we have done to-night, to take a ramble through
this historic cemetery.</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The lady is Mrs Josephine Foster, Mr A G Foster's wife]</p>
