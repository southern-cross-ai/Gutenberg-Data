<h2><a id="tower1" name="tower1">CHAPTER 1</a> </h2>

<p class="first">TORCHES flared murkily on the revels in the
Maul, where the thieves of the east held carnival by night. In
the Maul they could carouse and roar as they liked, for honest
people shunned the quarters, and watchmen, well paid with stained
coins, did not interfere with their sport. Along the crooked,
unpaved streets with their heaps of refuse and sloppy puddles,
drunken roisterers staggered, roaring. Steel glinted in the
shadows where wolf preyed on wolf, and from the darkness rose the
shrill laughter of women, and the sounds of scufflings and
strugglings. Torchlight licked luridly from broken windows and
wide-thrown doors, and out of those doors, stale smells of wine
and rank sweaty bodies, clamor of drinking-jacks and fists
hammered on rough tables, snatches of obscene songs, rushed like
a blow in the face.</p>

<p>In one of these dens merriment thundered to the low smoke-
stained roof, where rascals gathered in every stage of rags and
tatters&mdash;furtive cut-purses, leering kidnappers, quick-
fingered thieves, swaggering bravoes with their wenches,
strident-voiced women clad in tawdry finery. Native rogues were
the dominant element&mdash;dark-skinned, dark-eyed Zamorians,
with daggers at their girdles and guile in their hearts. But
there were wolves of half a dozen outland nations there as well.
There was a giant Hyperborean renegade, taciturn, dangerous, with
a broadsword strapped to his great gaunt frame&mdash;for men wore
steel openly in the Maul. There was a Shemitish counterfeiter,
with his hook nose and curled blue-black beard. There was a bold-
eyed Brythunian wench, sitting on the knee of a tawny-haired
Gunderman&mdash;a wandering mercenary soldier, a deserter from
some defeated army. And the fat gross rogue whose bawdy jests
were causing all the shouts of mirth was a professional kidnapper
come up from distant Koth to teach woman-stealing to Zamorians
who were born with more knowledge of the art than he could ever
attain.</p>

<p>This man halted in his description of an intended victim's
charms, and thrust his muzzle into a huge tankard of frothing
ale. Then blowing the foam from his fat lips, he said, 'By Bel,
god of all thieves, I'll show them how to steal wenches: I'll
have her over the Zamorian border before dawn, and there'll be a
caravan waiting to receive her. Three hundred pieces of silver, a
count of Ophir promised me for a sleek young Brythunian of the
better class. It took me weeks, wandering among the border cities
as a beggar, to find one I knew would suit. And is she a pretty
baggage!'</p>

<p>He blew a slobbery kiss in the air.</p>

<p>'I know lords in Shem who would trade the secret of the
Elephant Tower for her,' he said, returning to his ale.</p>

<p>A touch on his tunic sleeve made him turn his head, scowling
at the interruption. He saw a tall, strongly made youth standing
beside him. This person was as much out of place in that den as a
gray wolf among mangy rats of the gutters. His cheap tunic could
not conceal the hard, rangy lines of his powerful frame, the
broad heavy shoulders, the massive chest, lean waist and heavy
arms. His skin was brown from outland suns, his eyes blue and
smoldering; a shock of tousled black hair crowned his broad
forehead. From his girdle hung a sword in a worn leather
scabbard.</p>

<p>The Kothian involuntarily drew back; for the man was not one
of any civilized race he knew.</p>

<p>'You spoke of the Elephant Tower,' said the stranger, speaking
Zamorian with an alien accent. 'I've heard much of this tower;
what is its secret?'</p>

<p>The fellow's attitude did not seem threatening, and the
Kothian's courage was bolstered up by the ale, and the evident
approval of his audience. He swelled with self-importance.</p>

<p>'The secret of the Elephant Tower?' he exclaimed. 'Why, any
fool knows that Yara the priest dwells there with the great jewel
men call the Elephant's Heart, that is the secret of his
magic.'</p>

<p>The barbarian digested this for a space.</p>

<p>'I have seen this tower,' he said. 'It is set in a great
garden above the level of the city, surrounded by high walls. I
have seen no guards. The walls would be easy to climb. Why has
not somebody stolen this secret gem?'</p>

<p>The Kothian stared wide-mouthed at the other's simplicity,
then burst into a roar of derisive mirth, in which the others
joined.</p>

<p>'Harken to this heathen!' he bellowed. 'He would steal the
jewel of Yara!&mdash;Harken, fellow,' he said, turning
portentously to the other, 'I suppose you are some sort of a
northern barbarian&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I am a Cimmerian,' the outlander answered, in no friendly
tone. The reply and the manner of it meant little to the Kothian;
of a kingdom that lay far to the south, on the borders of Shem,
he knew only vaguely of the northern races.</p>

<p>'Then give ear and learn wisdom, fellow,' said he, pointing
his drinking-jack at the discomfited youth. 'Know that in Zamora,
and more especially in this city, there are more bold thieves
than anywhere else in the world, even Koth. If mortal man could
have stolen the gem, be sure it would have been filched long ago.
You speak of climbing the walls, but once having climbed, you
would quickly wish yourself back again. There are no guards in
the gardens at night for a very good reason&mdash;that is, no
human guards. But in the watch-chamber, in the lower part of the
tower, are armed men, and even if you passed those who roam the
gardens by night, you must still pass through the soldiers, for
the gem is kept somewhere in the tower above.'</p>

<p>'But if a man could pass through the gardens,' argued the
Cimmerian, 'why could he not come at the gem through the upper
part of the tower and thus avoid the soldiers?'</p>

<p>Again the Kothian gaped at him.</p>

<p>'Listen to him!' he shouted jeeringly. 'The barbarian is an
eagle who would fly to the jeweled rim of the tower, which is
only a hundred and fifty feet above the earth, with rounded sides
slicker than polished glass!'</p>

<p>The Cimmerian glared about, embarrassed at the roar of mocking
laughter that greeted this remark. He saw no particular humor in
it, and was too new to civilization to understand its
discourtesies. Civilized men are more discourteous than savages
because they know they can be impolite without having their
skulls split, as a general thing. He was bewildered and
chagrined, and doubtless would have slunk away, abashed, but the
Kothian chose to goad him further.</p>

<p>'Come, come!' he shouted. 'Tell these poor fellows, who have
only been thieves since before you were spawned, tell them how
you would steal the gem!'</p>

<p>'There is always a way, if the desire be coupled with
courage,' answered the Cimmerian shortly, nettled.</p>

<p>The Kothian chose to take this as a personal slur. His face
grew purple with anger.</p>

<p>'What!' he roared. 'You dare tell us our business, and
intimate that we are cowards? Get along; get out of my sight!'
And he pushed the Cimmerian violently.</p>

<p>'Will you mock me and then lay hands on me?' grated the
barbarian, his quick rage leaping up; and he returned the push
with an open-handed blow that knocked his tormenter back against
the rude-hewn table. Ale splashed over the jack's lip, and the
Kothian roared in fury, dragging at his sword.</p>

<p>'Heathen dog!' he bellowed. 'I'll have your heart for that!'
Steel flashed and the throng surged wildly back out of the way.
In their flight they knocked over the single candle and the den
was plunged in darkness, broken by the crash of upset benches,
drum of flying feet, shouts, oaths of people tumbling over one
another, and a single strident yell of agony that cut the din
like a knife. When a candle was relighted, most of the guests had
gone out by doors and broken windows, and the rest huddled behind
stacks of wine-kegs and under tables. The barbarian was gone; the
center of the room was deserted except for the gashed body of the
Kothian. The Cimmerian, with the unerring instinct of the
barbarian, had killed his man in the darkness and confusion.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="tower2" name="tower2">CHAPTER 2</a> </h2>

<p class="first">THE lurid lights and drunken revelry fell away
behind the Cimmerian. He had discarded his torn tunic, and walked
through the night naked except for a loin-cloth and his high-
strapped sandals. He moved with the supple ease of a great tiger,
his steely muscles rippling under his brown skin.</p>

<p>He had entered the part of the city reserved for the temples.
On all sides of him they glittered white in the
starlight&mdash;snowy marble pillars and golden domes and silver
arches, shrines of Zamora's myriad strange gods. He did not
trouble his head about them; he knew that Zamora's religion, like
all things of a civilized, long-settled people, was intricate and
complex, and had lost most of the pristine essence in a maze of
formulas and rituals. He had squatted for hours in the courtyard
of the philosophers, listening to the arguments of theologians
and teachers, and come away in a haze of bewilderment, sure of
only one thing, and that, that they were all touched in the
head.</p>

<p>His gods were simple and understandable; Crom was their chief,
and he lived on a great mountain, whence he sent forth dooms and
death. It was useless to call on Crom, because he was a gloomy,
savage god, and he hated weaklings. But he gave a man courage at
birth, and the will and might to kill his enemies, which, in the
Cimmerian's mind, was all any god should be expected to do.</p>

<p>His sandalled feet made no sound on the gleaming pave. No
watchmen passed, for even the thieves of the Maul shunned the
temples, where strange dooms had been known to fall on violators.
Ahead of him he saw, looming against the sky, the Tower of the
Elephant. He mused, wondering why it was so named. No one seemed
to know. He had never seen an elephant, but he vaguely understood
that it was a monstrous animal, with a tail in front as well as
behind. This a wandering Shemite had told him, swearing that he
had seen such beasts by the thousands in the country of the
Hyrkanians; but all men knew what liars were the men of Shem. At
any rate, there were no elephants in Zamora.</p>

<p>The shimmering shaft of the tower rose frostily in the stars.
In the sunlight it shone so dazzlingly that few could bear its
glare, and men said it was built of silver. It was round, a slim
perfect cylinder, a hundred and fifty feet in height, and its rim
glittered in the starlight with the great jewels which crusted
it. The tower stood among the waving exotic trees of a garden
raised high above the general level of the city. A high wall
enclosed this garden, and outside the wall was a lower level,
likewise enclosed by a wall. No lights shone forth; there seemed
to be no windows in the tower&mdash;at least not above the level
of the inner wall. Only the gems high above sparkled frostily in
the starlight.</p>

<p>Shrubbery grew thick outside the lower, or outer wall. The
Cimmerian crept close and stood beside the barrier, measuring it
with his eyes. It was high, but he could leap and catch the
coping with his fingers. Then it would be child's play to swing
himself up and over, and he did not doubt that he could pass the
inner wall in the same manner. But he hesitated at the thought of
the strange perils which were said to await within. These people
were strange and mysterious to him; they were not of his
kind&mdash;not even of the same blood as the more westerly
Brythunians, Nemedians, Kothians and Aquilonians, whose civilized
mysteries had awed him in times past. The people of Zamora were
very ancient, and, from what he had seen of them, very evil.</p>

<p>He thought of Yara, the high priest, who worked strange dooms
from this jeweled tower, and the Cimmerian's hair prickled as he
remembered a tale told by a drunken page of the court&mdash;how
Yara had laughed in the face of a hostile prince, and held up a
glowing, evil gem before him, and how rays shot blindingly from
that unholy jewel, to envelop the prince, who screamed and fell
down, and shrank to a withered blackened lump that changed to a
black spider which scampered wildly about the chamber until Yara
set his heel upon it.</p>

<p>Yara came not often from his tower of magic, and always to
work evil on some man or some nation. The king of Zamora feared
him more than he feared death, and kept himself drunk all the
time because that fear was more than he could endure sober. Yara
was very old&mdash;centuries old, men said, and added that he
would live for ever because of the magic of his gem, which men
called the Heart of the Elephant, for no better reason than they
named his hold the Elephant's Tower.</p>

<p>The Cimmerian, engrossed in these thoughts, shrank quickly
against the wall. Within the garden someone was passing, who
walked with a measured stride. The listener heard the clink of
steel. So after all a guard did pace those gardens. The Cimmerian
waited, expected to hear him pass again, on the next round, but
silence rested over the mysterious gardens.</p>

<p>At last curiosity overcame him. Leaping lightly he grasped the
wall and swung himself up to the top with one arm. Lying flat on
the broad coping, he looked down into the wide space between the
walls. No shrubbery grew near him, though he saw some carefully
trimmed bushes near the inner wall. The starlight fell on the
even sward and somewhere a fountain tinkled.</p>

<p>The Cimmerian cautiously lowered himself down on the inside
and drew his sword, staring about him. He was shaken by the
nervousness of the wild at standing thus unprotected in the naked
starlight, and he moved lightly around the curve of the wall,
hugging its shadow, until he was even with the shrubbery he had
noticed. Then he ran quickly toward it, crouching low, and almost
tripped over a form that lay crumpled near the edges of the
bushes.</p>

<p>A quick look to right and left showed him no enemy in sight at
least, and he bent close to investigate. His keen eyes, even in
the dim starlight, showed him a strongly built man in the
silvered armor and crested helmet of the Zamorian royal guard. A
shield and a spear lay near him, and it took but an instant's
examination to show that he had been strangled. The barbarian
glanced about uneasily. He knew that this man must be the guard
he had heard pass his hiding-place by the wall. Only a short time
had passed, yet in that interval nameless hands had reached out
of the dark and choked out the soldier's life.</p>

<p>Straining his eyes in the gloom, he saw a hint of motion
through the shrubs near the wall. Thither he glided, gripping his
sword. He made no more noise than a panther stealing through the
night, yet the man he was stalking heard. The Cimmerian had a dim
glimpse of a huge bulk close to the wall; felt relief that it was
at least human; then the fellow wheeled quickly with a gasp that
sounded like panic, made the first motion of a forward plunge,
hands clutching, then recoiled as the Cimmerian's blade caught
the starlight. For a tense instant neither spoke, standing ready
for anything.</p>

<p>'You are no soldier,' hissed the stranger at last. 'You are a
thief like myself.'</p>

<p>'And who are you?' asked the Cimmerian in a suspicious
whisper.</p>

<p>'Taurus of Nemedia.'</p>

<p>The Cimmerian lowered his sword.</p>

<p>'I've heard of you. Men call you a prince of thieves.'</p>

<p>A low laugh answered him. Taurus was as tall as the Cimmerian,
and heavier; he was big-bellied and fat, but his every movement
betokened a subtle dynamic magnetism, which was reflected in the
keen eyes that glinted vitally, even in the starlight. He was
barefooted and carried a coil of what looked like a thin, strong
rope, knotted at regular intervals. 'Who are you?' he
whispered.</p>

<p>'Conan, a Cimmerian,' answered the other. 'I came seeking a
way to steal Yara's jewel, that men call the Elephant's
Heart.'</p>

<p>Conan sensed the man's great belly shaking in laughter, but it
was not derisive.</p>

<p>'By Bel, god of thieves!' hissed Taurus. 'I had thought only
myself had courage to attempt that poaching. These Zamorians call
themselves thieves&mdash;bah! Conan, I like your grit. I never
shared an adventure with anyone, but by Bel, we'll attempt this
together if you're willing.'</p>

<p>'Then you are after the gem, too?'</p>

<p>'What else? I've had my plans laid for months, but you, I
think, have acted on a sudden impulse, my friend.'</p>

<p>'You killed the soldier?'</p>

<p>'Of course. I slid over the wall when he was on the other side
of the garden. I hid in the bushes; he heard me, or thought he
heard something. When he came blundering over, it was no trick at
all to get behind him and suddenly grip his neck and choke out
his fool's life. He was like most men, half blind in the dark. A
good thief should have eyes like a cat.'</p>

<p>'You made one mistake,' said Conan.</p>

<p>Taurus's eyes flashed angrily.</p>

<p>'I? I, a mistake? Impossible!'</p>

<p>'You should have dragged the body into the bushes.'</p>

<p>'Said the novice to the master of the art. They will not
change the guard until past midnight. Should any come searching
for him now, and find his body, they would flee at once to Yara,
bellowing the news, and give us time to escape. Were they not to
find it, they'd go on beating up the bushes and catch us like
rats in a trap.'</p>

<p>'You are right,' agreed Conan.</p>

<p>'So. Now attend. We waste time in this cursed discussion.
There are no guards in the inner garden&mdash;human guards, I
mean, though there are sentinels even more deadly. It was their
presence which baffled me for so long, but I finally discovered a
way to circumvent them.'</p>

<p>'What of the soldiers in the lower part of the tower?'</p>

<p>'Old Yara dwells in the chambers above. By that route we will
come&mdash;and go, I hope. Never mind asking me how. I have
arranged a way. We'll steal down through the top of the tower and
strangle old Yara before he can cast any of his accursed spells
on us. At least we'll try; it's the chance of being turned into a
spider or a toad, against the wealth and power of the world. All
good thieves must know how to take risks.'</p>

<p>'I'll go as far as any man,' said Conan, slipping off his
sandals.</p>

<p>'Then follow me.' And turning, Taurus leaped up, caught the
wall and drew himself up. The man's suppleness was amazing,
considering his bulk; he seemed almost to glide up over the edge
of the coping. Conan followed him, and lying flat on the broad
top, they spoke in wary whispers.</p>

<p>'I see no light,' Conan muttered. The lower part of the tower
seemed much like that portion visible from outside the
garden&mdash;a perfect, gleaming cylinder, with no apparent
openings.</p>

<p>'There are cleverly constructed doors and windows,' answered
Taurus, 'but they are closed. The soldiers breathe air that comes
from above.'</p>

<p>The garden was a vague pool of shadows, where feathery bushes
and low spreading trees waved darkly in the starlight. Conan's
wary soul felt the aura of waiting menace that brooded over it.
He felt the burning glare of unseen eyes, and he caught a subtle
scent that made the short hairs on his neck instinctively bristle
as a hunting dog bristles at the scent of an ancient enemy.
'Follow me,' whispered Taurus, 'keep behind me, as you value your
life.'</p>

<p>Taking what looked like a copper tube from his girdle, the
Nemedian dropped lightly to the sward inside the wall. Conan was
close behind him, sword ready, but Taurus pushed him back, close
to the wall, and showed no indication to advance, himself. His
whole attitude was of tense expectancy, and his gaze, like
Conan's, was fixed on the shadowy mass of shrubbery a few yards
away. This shrubbery was shaken, although the breeze had died
down. Then two great eyes blazed from the waving shadows, and
behind them other sparks of fire glinted in the darkness.</p>

<p>'Lions!' muttered Conan.</p>

<p>'Aye. By day they are kept in subterranean caverns below the
tower. That's why there are no guards in this garden.' Conan
counted the eyes rapidly.</p>

<p>'Five in sight; maybe more back in the bushes. They'll charge
in a moment&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Be silent!' hissed Taurus, and he moved out from the wall,
cautiously as if treading on razors, lifting the slender tube.
Low rumblings rose from the shadows and the blazing eyes moved
forward. Conan could sense the great slavering jaws, the tufted
tails lashing tawny sides. The air grew tense&mdash;the Cimmerian
gripped his sword, expecting the charge and the irresistible
hurtling of giant bodies. Then Taurus brought the mouth of the
tube to his lips and blew powerfully. A long jet of yellowish
powder shot from the other end of the tube and billowed out
instantly in a thick green-yellow cloud that settled over the
shrubbery, blotting out the glaring eyes.</p>

<p>Taurus ran back hastily to the wall. Conan glared without
understanding. The thick cloud hid the shrubbery, and from it no
sound came.</p>

<p>'What is that mist?' the Cimmerian asked uneasily.</p>

<p>'Death!' hissed the Nemedian. 'If a wind springs up and blows
it back upon us, we must flee over the wall. But no, the wind is
still, and now it is dissipating. Wait until it vanishes
entirely. To breathe it is death.'</p>

<p>Presently only yellowish shreds hung ghostily in the air; then
they were gone, and Taurus motioned his companion forward. They
stole toward the bushes, and Conan gasped. Stretched out in the
shadows lay five great tawny shapes, the fire of their grim eyes
dimmed for ever. A sweetish cloying scent lingered in the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>'They died without a sound!' muttered the Cimmerian. 'Taurus,
what was that powder?'</p>

<p>'It was made from the black lotus, whose blossoms wave in the
lost jungles of Khitai, where only the yellow-skulled priests of
Yun dwell. Those blossoms strike dead any who smell of them.'</p>

<p>Conan knelt beside the great forms, assuring himself that they
were indeed beyond power of harm. He shook his head; the magic of
the exotic lands was mysterious and terrible to the barbarians of
the north.</p>

<p>'Why can you not slay the soldiers in the tower in the same
way?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Because that was all the powder I possessed. The obtaining of
it was a feat which in itself was enough to make me famous among
the thieves of the world. I stole it out of a caravan bound for
Stygia, and I lifted it, in its cloth-of-gold bag, out of the
coils of the great serpent which guarded it, without awaking him.
But come, in Bel's name! Are we to waste the night in
discussion?'</p>

<p>They glided through the shrubbery to the gleaming foot of the
tower, and there, with a motion enjoining silence, Taurus unwound
his knotted cord, on one end of which was a strong steel hook.
Conan saw his plan, and asked no questions as the Nemedian
gripped the line a short distance below the hook, and began to
swing it about his head. Conan laid his ear to the smooth wall
and listened, but could hear nothing. Evidently the soldiers
within did not suspect the presence of intruders, who had made no
more sound than the night wind blowing through the trees. But a
strange nervousness was on the barbarian; perhaps it was the
lion-smell which was over everything.</p>

<p>Taurus threw the line with a smooth, ripping motion of his
mighty arm. The hook curved upward and inward in a peculiar
manner, hard to describe, and vanished over the jeweled rim. It
apparently caught firmly, for cautious jerking and then hard
pulling did not result in any slipping or giving.</p>

<p>'Luck the first cast,' murmured Taurus. 'I&mdash;'</p>

<p>It was Conan's savage instinct which made him wheel suddenly;
for the death that was upon them made no sound. A fleeting
glimpse showed the Cimmerian the giant tawny shape, rearing
upright against the stars, towering over him for the death-
stroke. No civilized man could have moved half so quickly as the
barbarian moved. His sword flashed frostily in the starlight with
every ounce of desperate nerve and thew behind it, and man and
beast went down together.</p>

<p>Cursing incoherently beneath his breath, Taurus bent above the
mass, and saw his companion's limbs move as he strove to drag
himself from under the great weight that lay limply upon him. A
glance showed the startled Nemedian that the lion was dead, its
slanting skull split in half. He laid hold of the carcass, and by
his aid, Conan thrust it aside and clambered up, still gripping
his dripping sword.</p>

<p>'Are you hurt, man?' gasped Taurus, still bewildered by the
stunning swiftness of that touch-and-go episode.</p>

<p>'No, by Crom!' answered the barbarian. 'But that was as close
a call as I've had in a life noways tame. Why did not the cursed
beast roar as he charged?'</p>

<p>'All things are strange in this garden,' said Taurus. 'The
lions strike silently&mdash;and so do other deaths. But
come&mdash;little sound was made in that slaying, but the
soldiers might have heard, if they are not asleep or drunk. That
beast was in some other part of the garden and escaped the death
of the flowers, but surely there are no more. We must climb this
cord&mdash;little need to ask a Cimmerian if he can.'</p>

<p>'If it will bear my weight,' grunted Conan, cleansing his
sword on the grass.</p>

<p>'It will bear thrice my own,' answered Taurus. 'It was woven
from the tresses of dead women, which I took from their tombs at
midnight, and steeped in the deadly wine of the upas tree, to
give it strength. I will go first&mdash;then follow me
closely.'</p>

<p>The Nemedian gripped the rope and, crooking a knee about it,
began the ascent; he went up like a cat, belying the apparent
clumsiness of his bulk. The Cimmerian followed. The cord swayed
and turned on itself, but the climbers were not hindered; both
had made more difficult climbs before. The jeweled rim glittered
high above them, jutting out from the perpendicular&mdash;a fact
which added greatly to the ease of the ascent.</p>

<p>Up and up they went, silently, the lights of the city
spreading out further and further to their sight as they climbed,
the stars above them more and more dimmed by the glitter of the
jewels along the rim. Now Taurus reached up a hand and gripped
the rim itself, pulling himself up and over. Conan paused a
moment on the very edge, fascinated by the great frosty jewels
whose gleams dazzled his eyes&mdash;diamonds, rubies, emeralds,
sapphires, turquoises, moonstones, set thick as stars in the
shimmering silver. At a distance their different gleams had
seemed to merge into a pulsing white glare; but now, at close
range, they shimmered with a million rainbow tints and lights,
hypnotizing him with their scintillations.</p>

<p>'There is a fabulous fortune here, Taurus,' he whispered; but
the Nemedian answered impatiently. 'Come on! If we secure the
Heart, these and all other things shall be ours.'</p>

<p>Conan climbed over the sparkling rim. The level of the tower's
top was some feet below the gemmed ledge. It was flat, composed
of some dark blue substance, set with gold that caught the
starlight, so that the whole looked like a wide sapphire flecked
with shining gold-dust. Across from the point where they had
entered there seemed to be a sort of chamber, built upon the
roof. It was of the same silvery material as the walls of the
tower, adorned with designs worked in smaller gems; its single
door was of gold, its surface cut in scales, and crusted with
jewels that gleamed like ice.</p>

<p>Conan cast a glance at the pulsing ocean of lights which
spread far below them, then glanced at Taurus. The Nemedian was
drawing up his cord and coiling it. He showed Conan where the
hook had caught&mdash;a fraction of an inch of the point had sunk
under a great blazing jewel on the inner side of the rim.</p>

<p>'Luck was with us again,' he muttered. 'One would think that
our combined weight would have torn that stone out. Follow me;
the real risks of the venture begin now. We are in the serpent's
lair, and we know not where he lies hidden.'</p>

<p>Like stalking tigers they crept across the darkly gleaming
floor and halted outside the sparkling door. With a deft and
cautious hand Taurus tried it. It gave without resistance, and
the companions looked in, tensed for anything. Over the
Nemedian's shoulder Conan had a glimpse of a glittering chamber,
the walls, ceiling and floor of which were crusted with great
white jewels which lighted it brightly, and which seemed its only
illumination. It seemed empty of life.</p>

<p>'Before we cut off our last retreat,' hissed Taurus, 'go you
to the rim and look over on all sides; if you see any soldiers
moving in the gardens, or anything suspicious, return and tell
me. I will await you within this chamber.'</p>

<p>Conan saw scant reason in this, and a faint suspicion of his
companion touched his wary soul, but he did as Taurus requested.
As he turned away, the Nemedian slipped inside the door and drew
it shut behind him. Conan crept about the rim of the tower,
returning to his starting-point without having seen any
suspicious movement in the vaguely waving sea of leaves below. He
turned toward the door&mdash;suddenly from within the chamber
there sounded a strangled cry.</p>

<p>The Cimmerian leaped forward, electrified&mdash;the gleaming
floor swung open and Taurus stood framed in the cold blaze behind
him. He swayed and his lips parted, but only a dry rattle burst
from his throat. Catching at the golden door for support, he
lurched out upon the roof, then fell headlong, clutching at his
throat. The door swung to behind him.</p>

<p>Conan, crouching like a panther at bay, saw nothing in the
room behind the stricken Nemedian, in the brief instant the door
was partly open&mdash;unless it was not a trick of the light
which made it seem as if a shadow darted across the gleaming
door. Nothing followed Taurus out on the roof, and Conan bent
above the man.</p>

<p>The Nemedian stared up with dilated, glazing eyes, that
somehow held a terrible bewilderment. His hands clawed at his
throat, his lips slobbered and gurgled; then suddenly he
stiffened, and the astounded Cimmerian knew that he was dead. And
he felt that Taurus had died without knowing what manner of death
had stricken him. Conan glared bewilderedly at the cryptic golden
door. In that empty room, with its glittering jeweled walls,
death had come to the prince of thieves as swiftly and
mysteriously as he had dealt doom to the lions in the gardens
below.</p>

<p>Gingerly the barbarian ran his hands over the man's half-naked
body, seeking a wound. But the only marks of violence were
between his shoulders, high up near the base of his bull-
neck&mdash;three small wounds, which looked as if three nails had
been driven deep in the flesh and withdrawn. The edges of these
wounds were black, and a faint smell as of putrefaction was
evident. Poisoned darts? thought Conan&mdash;but in that case the
missiles should be still in the wounds.</p>

<p>Cautiously he stole toward the golden door, pushed it open,
and looked inside. The chamber lay empty, bathed in the cold,
pulsing glow of the myriad jewels. In the very center of the
ceiling he idly noted a curious design&mdash;a black eight-sided
pattern, in the center of which four gems glittered with a red
flame unlike the white blaze of the other jewels. Across the room
there was another door, like the one in which he stood, except
that it was not carved in the scale pattern. Was it from that
door that death had come?&mdash;and having struck down its
victim, had it retreated by the same way?</p>

<p>Closing the door behind him, the Cimmerian advanced into the
chamber. His bare feet made no sound on the crystal floor. There
were no chairs or tables in the chamber, only three or four
silken couches, embroidered with gold and worked in strange
serpentine designs, and several silver-bound mahogany chests.
Some were sealed with heavy golden locks; others lay open, their
carven lids thrown back, revealing heaps of jewels in a careless
riot of splendor to the Cimmerian's astounded eyes. Conan swore
beneath his breath; already he had looked upon more wealth that
night than he had ever dreamed existed in all the world, and he
grew dizzy thinking of what must be the value of the jewel he
sought.</p>

<p>He was in the center of the room now, going stooped forward,
head thrust out warily, sword advanced, when again death struck
at him soundlessly. A flying shadow that swept across the
gleaming floor was his only warning, and his instinctive sidelong
leap all that saved his life. He had a flashing glimpse of a
hairy black horror that swung past him with a clashing of
frothing fangs, and something splashed on his bare shoulder that
burned like drops of liquid hellfire. Springing back, sword high,
he saw the horror strike the floor, wheel and scuttle toward him
with appalling speed&mdash;a gigantic black spider, such as men
see only in nightmare dreams.</p>

<p>It was as large as a pig, and its eight thick hairy legs drove
its ogreish body over the floor at headlong pace; its four evilly
gleaming eyes shone with a horrible intelligence, and its fangs
dripped venom that Conan knew, from the burning of his shoulder
where only a few drops had splashed as the thing struck and
missed, was laden with swift death. This was the killer that had
dropped from its perch in the middle of the ceiling on a strand
of its web, on the neck of the Nemedian. Fools that they were not
to have suspected that the upper chambers would be guarded as
well as the lower!</p>

<p>These thoughts flashed briefly through Conan's mind as the
monster rushed. He leaped high, and it passed beneath him,
wheeled and charged back. This time he evaded its rush with a
sidewise leap, and struck back like a cat. His sword severed one
of the hairy legs, and again he barely saved himself as the
monstrosity swerved at him, fangs clicking fiendishly. But the
creature did not press the pursuit; turning, it scuttled across
the crystal floor and ran up the wall to the ceiling, where it
crouched for an instant, glaring down at him with its fiendish
red eyes. Then without warning it launched itself through space,
trailing a strand of slimy grayish stuff.</p>

<p>Conan stepped back to avoid the hurtling body&mdash;then
ducked frantically, just in time to escape being snared by the
flying web-rope. He saw the monster's intent and sprang toward
the door, but it was quicker, and a sticky strand cast across the
door made him a prisoner. He dared not try to cut it with his
sword; he knew the stuff would cling to the blade, and before he
could shake it loose, the fiend would be sinking its fangs into
his back.</p>

<p>Then began a desperate game, the wits and quickness of the man
matched against the fiendish craft and speed of the giant spider.
It no longer scuttled across the floor in a direct charge, or
swung its body through the air at him. It raced about the ceiling
and the walls, seeking to snare him in the long loops of sticky
gray web-strands, which it flung with a devilish accuracy. These
strands were thick as ropes, and Conan knew that once they were
coiled about him, his desperate strength would not be enough to
tear him free before the monster struck.</p>

<p>All over the chamber went on that devil's game, in utter
silence except for the quick breathing of the man, the low scuff
of his bare feet on the shining floor, the castanet rattle of the
monstrosity's fangs. The gray strands lay in coils on the floor;
they were looped along the walls; they overlaid the jewel-chests
and silken couches, and hung in dusky festoons from the jeweled
ceiling. Conan's steel-trap quickness of eye and muscle had kept
him untouched, though the sticky loops had passed him so close
they rasped his naked hide. He knew he could not always avoid
them; he not only had to watch the strands swinging from the
ceiling, but to keep his eye on the floor, lest he trip in the
coils that lay there. Sooner or later a gummy loop would writhe
about him, python-like, and then, wrapped like a cocoon, he would
lie at the monster's mercy.</p>

<p>The spider raced across the chamber floor, the gray rope
waving out behind it. Conan leaped high, clearing a
couch&mdash;with a quick wheel the fiend ran up the wall, and the
strand, leaping off the floor like a live thing, whipped about
the Cimmerian's ankle. He caught himself on his hands as he fell,
jerking frantically at the web which held him like a pliant vise,
or the coil of a python. The hairy devil was racing down the wall
to complete its capture. Stung to frenzy, Conan caught up a jewel
chest and hurled it with all his strength. It was a move the
monster was not expecting. Full in the midst of the branching
black legs the massive missile struck, smashing against the wall
with a muffled sickening crunch. Blood and greenish slime
spattered, and the shattered mass fell with the burst gem-chest
to the floor. The crushed black body lay among the flaming riot
of jewels that spilled over it; the hairy legs moved aimlessly,
the dying eyes glittered redly among the twinkling gems.</p>

<p>Conan glared about, but no other horror appeared, and he set
himself to working free of the web. The substance clung
tenaciously to his ankle and his hands, but at last he was free,
and taking up his sword, he picked his way among the gray coils
and loops to the inner door. What horrors lay within he did not
know. The Cimmerian's blood was up, and since he had come so far,
and overcome so much peril, he was determined to go through to
the grim finish of the adventure, whatever that might be. And he
felt that the jewel he sought was not among the many so
carelessly strewn about the gleaming chamber.</p>

<p>Stripping off the loops that fouled the inner door, he found
that it, like the other, was not locked. He wondered if the
soldiers below were still unaware of his presence. Well, he was
high above their heads, and if tales were to be believed, they
were used to strange noises in the tower above
them&mdash;sinister sounds, and screams of agony and horror.</p>

<p>Yara was on his mind, and he was not altogether comfortable as
he opened the golden door. But he saw only a flight of silver
steps leading down, dimly lighted by what means he could not
ascertain. Down these he went silently, gripping his sword. He
heard no sound, and came presently to an ivory door, set with
blood-stones. He listened, but no sound came from within; only
thin wisps of smoke drifted lazily from beneath the door, bearing
a curious exotic odor unfamiliar to the Cimmerian. Below him the
silver stair wound down to vanish in the dimness, and up that
shadowy well no sound floated; he had an eery feeling that he was
alone in a tower occupied only by ghosts and phantoms.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="tower3" name="tower3">CHAPTER 3</a> </h2>

<p class="first">CAUTIOUSLY he pressed against the ivory door and
it swung silently inward. On the shimmering threshold Conan
stared like a wolf in strange surroundings, ready to fight or
flee on the instant. He was looking into a large chamber with a
domed golden ceiling; the walls were of green jade, the floor of
ivory, partly covered by thick rugs. Smoke and exotic scent of
incense floated up from a brazier on a golden tripod, and behind
it sat an idol on a sort of marble couch. Conan stared aghast;
the image had the body of a man, naked, and green in color; but
the head was one of nightmare and madness. Too large for the
human body, it had no attributes of humanity. Conan stared at the
wide flaring ears, the curling proboscis, on either side of which
stood white tusks tipped with round golden balls. The eyes were
closed, as if in sleep.</p>

<p>This then, was the reason for the name, the Tower of the
Elephant, for the head of the thing was much like that of the
beasts described by the Shemitish wanderer. This was Yara's god;
where then should the gem be, but concealed in the idol, since
the stone was called the Elephant's Heart?</p>

<p>As Conan came forward, his eyes fixed on the motionless idol,
the eyes of the thing opened suddenly! The Cimmerian froze in his
tracks. It was no image&mdash;it was a living thing, and he was
trapped in its chamber!</p>

<p>That he did not instantly explode in a burst of murderous
frenzy is a fact that measures his horror, which paralyzed him
where he stood. A civilized man in his position would have sought
doubtful refuge in the conclusion that he was insane; it did not
occur to the Cimmerian to doubt his senses. He knew he was face
to face with a demon of the Elder World, and the realization
robbed him of all his faculties except sight.</p>

<p>The trunk of the horror was lifted and quested about, the
topaz eyes stared unseeingly, and Conan knew the monster was
blind. With the thought came a thawing of his frozen nerves, and
he began to back silently toward the door. But the creature
heard. The sensitive trunk stretched toward him, and Conan's
horror froze him again when the being spoke, in a strange,
stammering voice that never changed its key or timbre. The
Cimmerian knew that those jaws were never built or intended for
human speech.</p>

<p>'Who is here? Have you come to torture me again, Yara? Will
you never be done? Oh, Yag-kosha, is there no end to agony?'</p>

<p>Tears rolled from the sightless eyes, and Conan's gaze strayed
to the limbs stretched on the marble couch. And he knew the
monster would not rise to attack him. He knew the marks of the
rack, and the searing brand of the flame, and tough-souled as he
was, he stood aghast at the ruined deformities which his reason
told him had once been limbs as comely as his own. And suddenly
all fear and repulsion went from him, to be replaced by a great
pity. What this monster was, Conan could not know, but the
evidences of its sufferings were so terrible and pathetic that a
strange aching sadness came over the Cimmerian, he knew not why.
He only felt that he was looking upon a cosmic tragedy, and he
shrank with shame, as if the guilt of a whole race were laid upon
him.</p>

<p>'I am not Yara,' he said. 'I am only a thief. I will not harm
you.'</p>

<p>'Come near that I may touch you,' the creature faltered, and
Conan came near unfearingly, his sword hanging forgotten in his
hand. The sensitive trunk came out and groped over his face and
shoulders, as a blind man gropes, and its touch was light as a
girl's hand.</p>

<p>'You are not of Yara's race of devils,' sighed the creature.
'The clean, lean fierceness of the wastelands marks you. I know
your people from of old, whom I knew by another name in the long,
long ago when another world lifted its jeweled spires to the
stars. There is blood on your fingers.'</p>

<p>'A spider in the chamber above and a lion in the garden,'
muttered Conan.</p>

<p>'You have slain a man too, this night,' answered the other.
'And there is death in the tower above. I feel; I know.'</p>

<p>'Aye,' muttered Conan. 'The prince of all thieves lies there
dead from the bite of a vermin.'</p>

<p>'So&mdash;and so!' The strange inhuman voice rose in a sort of
low chant. 'A slaying in the tavern and a slaying on the
road&mdash;I know; I feel. And the third will make the magic of
which not even Yara dreams&mdash;oh, magic of deliverance, green
gods of Yag!'</p>

<p>Again tears fell as the tortured body was rocked to and fro in
the grip of varied emotions. Conan looked on, bewildered.</p>

<p>Then the convulsions ceased; the soft, sightless eyes were
turned toward the Cimmerian, the trunk beckoned.</p>

<p>'Oh man, listen,' said the strange being. 'I am foul and
monstrous to you, am I not? Nay, do not answer; I know. But you
would seem as strange to me, could I see you. There are many
worlds besides this earth, and life takes many shapes. I am
neither god nor demon, but flesh and blood like yourself, though
the substance differ in part, and the form be cast in a different
mold.</p>

<p>'I am very old, oh man of the waste countries; long and long
ago I came to this planet with others of my world, from the green
planet Yag, which circles for ever in the outer fringe of this
universe. We swept through space on mighty wings that drove us
through the cosmos quicker than light, because we had warred with
the kings of Yag and were defeated and outcast. But we could
never return, for on earth our wings withered from our shoulders.
Here we abode apart from earthly life. We fought the strange and
terrible forms of life which then walked the earth, so that we
became feared, and were not molested in the dim jungles of the
east, where we had our abode.</p>

<p>'We saw men grow from the ape and build the shining cities of
Valusia, Kamelia, Commoria and their sisters. We saw them reel
before the thrusts of the heathen Atlanteans and Picts and
Lemurians. We saw the oceans rise and engulf Atlantis and
Lemuria, and the isles of the Picts, and the shining cities of
civilization. We saw the survivors of Pictdom and Atlantis build
their stone-age empires, and go down to ruin, locked in bloody
wars. We saw the Picts sink into abysmal savagery, the Atlanteans
into apedom again. We saw new savages drift southward in
conquering waves from the Arctic circle to build a new
civilization, with new kingdoms called Nemedia, and Koth, and
Aquilonia and their sisters. We saw your people rise under a new
name from the jungles of the apes that had been Atlanteans. We
saw the descendants of the Lemurians who had survived the
cataclysm, rise again through savagery and ride westward as
Hyrkanians. And we saw this race of devils, survivors of the
ancient civilization that was before Atlantis sank, come once
more into culture and power&mdash;this accursed kingdom of
Zamora.</p>

<p>'All this we saw, neither aiding nor hindering the immutable
cosmic law, and one by one we died; for we of Yag are not
immortal, though our lives are as the lives of planets and
constellations. At last I alone was left, dreaming of old times
among the ruined temples of jungle-lost Khitai, worshipped as a
god by an ancient yellow-skinned race. Then came Yara, versed in
dark knowledge handed down through the days of barbarism, since
before Atlantis sank.</p>

<p>'First he sat at my feet and learned wisdom. But he was not
satisfied with what I taught him, for it was white magic, and he
wished evil lore, to enslave kings and glut a fiendish ambition.
I would teach him none of the black secrets I had gained, through
no wish of mine, through the eons.</p>

<p>'But his wisdom was deeper than I had guessed; with guile
gotten among the dusky tombs of dark Stygia, he trapped me into
divulging a secret I had not intended to bare; and turning my own
power upon me, he enslaved me. Ah, gods of Yag, my cup has been
bitter since that hour!</p>

<p>'He brought me up from the lost jungles of Khitai where the
gray apes danced to the pipes of the yellow priests, and
offerings of fruit and wine heaped my broken altars. No more was
I a god to kindly jungle-folk&mdash;I was slave to a devil in
human form.'</p>

<p>Again tears stole from the unseeing eyes.</p>

<p>'He pent me in this tower which at his command I built for him
in a single night. By fire and rack he mastered me, and by
strange unearthly tortures you would not understand. In agony I
would long ago have taken my own life, if I could. But he kept me
alive&mdash;mangled, blinded, and broken&mdash;to do his foul
bidding. And for three hundred years I have done his bidding,
from this marble couch, blackening my soul with cosmic sins, and
staining my wisdom with crimes, because I had no other choice.
Yet not all my ancient secrets has he wrested from me, and my
last gift shall be the sorcery of the Blood and the Jewel.</p>

<p>'For I feel the end of time draw near. You are the hand of
Fate. I beg of you, take the gem you will find on yonder
altar.'</p>

<p>Conan turned to the gold and ivory altar indicated, and took
up a great round jewel, clear as crimson crystal; and he knew
that this was the Heart of the Elephant.</p>

<p>'Now for the great magic, the mighty magic, such as earth has
not seen before, and shall not see again, through a million
million of millenniums. By my life-blood I conjure it, by blood
born on the green breast of Yag, dreaming far-poised in the great
blue vastness of Space.</p>

<p>'Take your sword, man, and cut out my heart; then squeeze it
so that the blood will flow over the red stone. Then go you down
these stairs and enter the ebony chamber where Yara sits wrapped
in lotus-dreams of evil. Speak his name and he will awaken. Then
lay this gem before him, and say, "Yag-kosha gives you a last
gift and a last enchantment." Then get you from the tower
quickly; fear not, your way shall be made clear. The life of man
is not the life of Yag, nor is human death the death of Yag. Let
me be free of this cage of broken blind flesh, and I will once
more be Yogah of Yag, morning-crowned and shining, with wings to
fly, and feet to dance, and eyes to see, and hands to break.'</p>

<p>Uncertainly Conan approached, and Yag-kosha, or Yogah, as if
sensing his uncertainty, indicated where he should strike. Conan
set his teeth and drove the sword deep. Blood streamed over the
blade and his hand, and the monster started convulsively, then
lay back quite still. Sure that life had fled, at least life as
he understood it, Conan set to work on his grisly task and
quickly brought forth something that he felt must be the strange
being's heart, though it differed curiously from any he had ever
seen. Holding the pulsing organ over the blazing jewel, he
pressed it with both hands, and a rain of blood fell on the
stone. To his surprise, it did not run off, but soaked into the
gem, as water is absorbed by a sponge.</p>

<p>Holding the jewel gingerly, he went out of the fantastic
chamber and came upon the silver steps. He did not look back; he
instinctively felt that some transmutation was taking place in
the body on the marble couch, and he further felt that it was of
a sort not to be witnessed by human eyes.</p>

<p>He closed the ivory door behind him and without hesitation
descended the silver steps. It did not occur to him to ignore the
instructions given him. He halted at an ebony door, in the center
of which was a grinning silver skull, and pushed it open. He
looked into a chamber of ebony and jet, and saw, on a black
silken couch, a tall, spare form reclining. Yara the priest and
sorcerer lay before him, his eyes open and dilated with the fumes
of the yellow lotus, far-staring, as if fixed on gulfs and
nighted abysses beyond human ken.</p>

<p>'Yara!' said Conan, like a judge pronouncing doom.
'Awaken!'</p>

<p>The eyes cleared instantly and became cold and cruel as a
vulture's. The tall silken-clad form lifted erect, and towered
gauntly above the Cimmerian.</p>

<p>'Dog!' His hiss was like the voice of a cobra. 'What do you
here?'</p>

<p>Conan laid the jewel on the ebony table.</p>

<p>'He who sent this gem bade me say, "Yag-kosha gives you a last
gift and a last enchantment."'</p>

<p>Yara recoiled, his dark face ashy. The jewel was no longer
crystal-clear; its murky depths pulsed and throbbed, and curious
smoky waves of changing color passed over its smooth surface. As
if drawn hypnotically, Yara bent over the table and gripped the
gem in his hands, staring into its shadowed depths, as if it were
a magnet to draw the shuddering soul from his body. And as Conan
looked, he thought that his eyes must be playing him tricks. For
when Yara had risen up from his couch, the priest had seemed
gigantically tall; yet now he saw that Yara's head would scarcely
come to his shoulder. He blinked, puzzled, and for the first time
that night, doubted his own senses. Then with a shock he realized
that the priest was shrinking in stature&mdash;was growing
smaller before his very gaze.</p>

<p>With a detached feeling he watched, as a man might watch a
play; immersed in a feeling of overpowering unreality, the
Cimmerian was no longer sure of his own identity; he only knew
that he was looking upon the external evidence of the unseen play
of vast Outer forces, beyond his understanding.</p>

<p>Now Yara was no bigger than a child; now like an infant he
sprawled on the table, still grasping the jewel. And now the
sorcerer suddenly realized his fate, and he sprang up, releasing
the gem. But still he dwindled, and Conan saw a tiny, pygmy
figure rushing wildly about the ebony table-top, waving tiny arms
and shrieking in a voice that was like the squeak of an
insect.</p>

<p>Now he had shrunk until the great jewel towered above him like
a hill, and Conan saw him cover his eyes with his hands, as if to
shield them from the glare, as he staggered about like a madman.
Conan sensed that some unseen magnetic force was pulling Yara to
the gem. Thrice he raced wildly about it in a narrowing circle,
thrice he strove to turn and run out across the table; then with
a scream that echoed faintly in the ears of the watcher, the
priest threw up his arms and ran straight toward the blazing
globe.</p>

<p>Bending close, Conan saw Yara clamber up the smooth, curving
surface, impossibly, like a man climbing a glass mountain. Now
the priest stood on the top, still with tossing arms, invoking
what grisly names only the gods know. And suddenly he sank into
the very heart of the jewel, as a man sinks into a sea, and Conan
saw the smoky waves close over his head. Now he saw him in the
crimson heart of the jewel, once more crystal-clear, as a man
sees a scene far away, tiny with great distance. And into the
heart came a green, shining winged figure with the body of a man
and the head of an elephant&mdash;no longer blind or crippled.
Yara threw up his arms and fled as a madman flees, and on his
heels came the avenger. Then, like the bursting of a bubble, the
great jewel vanished in a rainbow burst of iridescent gleams, and
the ebony table-top lay bare and deserted&mdash;as bare, Conan
somehow knew, as the marble couch in the chamber above, where the
body of that strange transcosmic being called Yag-kosha and Yogah
had lain.</p>

<p>The Cimmerian turned and fled from the chamber, down the
silver stairs. So mazed was he that it did not occur to him to
escape from the tower by the way he had entered it. Down that
winding, shadowy silver well he ran, and came into a large
chamber at the foot of the gleaming stairs. There he halted for
an instant; he had come into the room of soldiers. He saw the
glitter of their silver corselets, the sheen of their jeweled
sword-hilts. They sat slumped at the banquet board, their dusky
plumes waving somberly above their drooping helmeted heads; they
lay among their dice and fallen goblets on the wine-stained
lapis-lazuli floor. And he knew that they were dead. The promise
had been made, the word kept; whether sorcery or magic or the
falling shadow of great green wings had stilled the revelry,
Conan could not know, but his way had been made clear. And a
silver door stood open, framed in the whiteness of dawn.</p>

<p>Into the waving green gardens came the Cimmerian, and as the
dawn wind blew upon him with the cool fragrance of luxuriant
growths, he started like a man waking from a dream. He turned
back uncertainly, to stare at the cryptic tower he had just left.
Was he bewitched and enchanted? Had he dreamed all that had
seemed to have passed? As he looked he saw the gleaming tower
sway against the crimson dawn, its jewel-crusted rim sparkling in
the growing light, and crash into shining shards.</p>
