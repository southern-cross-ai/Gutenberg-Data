<h2><a id="chap1"></a>CHAPTER 1<br>

RAMOSE AND HIS MOTHER</h2>

<p class="first">
Now when by the favour of the most high God, Him whom I
worship, to whom every man is gathered at last, now, I say, when
I am old, many have urged upon me that I, Ramose, should set down
certain of those things that I have seen in the days of my life,
and particularly the tale of the fall of Babylon, the mighty
city, before Cyrus the Persian, which chanced when he whom the
Greeks called Nabonidus being newly dead, Belshazzar his son was
king.</p>

<p>Therefore, having ever been a lover of letters, this I do in
the Grecian tongue here in my house at Memphis, the great city of
the Nile, whereof to-day I am the governor under Darius the
Persian, for it has pleased God after many adversities to bring
me to this peace and dignity at last. Whether any will read this
book when it is written, or whether it will perish with me, I do
not know, nor indeed does it trouble me much, since none can tell
the end of anything good or ill, and all must happen as it is
decreed. Man makes a beginning, but the rest is in the hands of
fate; indeed his life itself is but a beginning of which the end
is hid.</p>

<p>Now to-day when he is almost forgotten, I can say without fear
that I am a king's son, for my father was none other than the
Pharaoh Uah-ab-Ra, whom the Greeks called Apries and the Hebrews
Hophra. Nor is my blood all royal, seeing that I was not the son
of the wife of Pharaoh, but of one of his women, a Grecian lady
named Chloe, the daughter of Chion, an Athenian by birth, of whom
the less said the better for my mother told me that being a
spendthrift and in want of money, he turned her beauty to account
by giving her to Apries in exchange for a great present. I know
no more of the matter because she would seldom speak of it,
saying that it was shameful, adding only that her father was
well-born; that her mother had died when she was an infant, and
that before she came to the court at Sais, they saw many changes
of fortune, living sometimes in wealth, but for the most part
humbly and in great poverty which in after years bred in her a
love of rank and riches.</p>

<p>Here in the palace of Sais during the little time that my
mother was in favour with Pharaoh, I was born, and here I lived
till I was a young man grown, being brought up with the sons of
the great nobles and taught all things that one of my station
should know, especially the art of war and how to ride and handle
weapons. Further I got learning because always from the first I
loved it, being taught many things by Greek masters who were
about the court, as well as by Egyptians; also by a certain
Babylonian named Belus, a doctor who was versed in strange lore
concerning the stars. Of this Belus, my master and friend but for
whom I should long ago be dead, I shall have much to tell.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that in the end I could read and speak
Greek as well as I could Egyptian, which was not to be wondered
at, seeing that I learned it at my mother's breast. Also I
mastered the Babylonian or Chaldean tongue, though not so well,
and with it the curious writing of that people.</p>

<p>Of my father, the Pharaoh, I saw little for he had so many
children such as I, born of different mothers, that he took small
heed of us, he upon whom lay this hard fortune, that from those
who were his queens according to the law of Egypt, he had no
offspring save one daughter only, while from those who were not
his queens he had many. This was a heavy grief to the Pharaoh my
father, who saw in it the hands of the gods to whom he made great
sacrifices, especially to Ptah-Khepera the Creator and Father of
Life, building up his temple at Memphis, and praying of him a son
of the pure blood. But no son came and an oracle told him that he
who loved the Greeks so much must to the Greeks for offspring,
which was true, for all his sons were born of Grecian women, as
perhaps the oracle knew already.</p>

<p>On a certain day I and other lads of my age were running races
after the Grecian fashion. In the long race I outran all the
rest, and fell panting and exhausted into the arms of one who,
followed by three companions, stood wrapped in a dark cloak, (for
the time was winter,) just by a wand that we had set in the
ground to serve us as a winning-post.</p>

<p>"Well run and well won!" said a voice which I knew for that of
Apries. "How are you named and who begot you?"</p>

<p>Now I rose from the ground upon which I had sunk, and
pretending that he was a stranger to me, gasped out,</p>

<p>"Ramose is my name, and as for that of my begetter, go ask his
of Pharaoh."</p>

<p>"I thought it," muttered Apries, considering me. Then he
turned to the first of his councillors and said,</p>

<p>"You know of what we were talking just now; this lad is
straight and strong and has a noble air; moreover I have a good
report of him from his instructors who say that he loves
learning. Why should he not fill a throne as well as another? The
double crown would look well upon his brow."</p>

<p>"Because his skin is too white, Pharaoh," answered that
councillor. "If the Egyptians learned that you purposed to set a
Greek to rule them after you, they would cut his throat and
perhaps tumble you into the Nile."</p>

<p>I remember these words very well, because although spoken at
hazard, they must have been inspired, for they were in fact a
prophecy, seeing that in the after years Apries was tumbled into
the Nile whence Amasis who had usurped his throne, rescued his
body and gave it royal burial.</p>

<p>After this Pharaoh spoke to me for a while, but not until he
had bidden one of his councillors to lift the cloak from his
shoulders and throw it round me, lest I, who was hot with the
racing, should take cold. So there I stood, wrapped in the royal
cloak of Tyrian purple, while those King's Companions muttered
together, thinking that this was an omen and that one day I
should sit upon the throne. Yet it was none, for it was not fated
that any of the blood of Uah-ab-Ra, or Apries, should reign after
him. That cloak I have to this day, though I do not wear it
because of its royal clasp, for Pharaoh does not take back his
gifts, or even that which he has lent for an hour. Yes, I have
the cloak but not the crown, though this in truth I never
sought.</p>

<p>Well, he searched me with his shrewd eyes that at times could
look so fierce, and asked me questions as to my studies; also
what I wished to be, a priest or a scribe or a soldier.</p>

<p>"What Pharaoh pleases," I answered, "though if I had my will,
I would be all three, a priest because he draws nigh to the gods;
a scribe because he gathers learning which is strength, and a
soldier because he defends his country and wins glory. Yet most
of all I would be a soldier."</p>

<p>"Well spoken," said Pharaoh, like one who was astonished at my
answer. "You shall have your way if I can give it to you."</p>

<p>Then he held out his hand to me to kiss and left me,
muttering,</p>

<p>"Would that his mother had been Egyptian and not Greek."</p>

<p>Here I must tell that before this time my mother, Chloe, who
long ago had been succeeded by others in Pharaoh's favour, no
longer dwelt at the court in Sais. For Apries, wishing to do well
by her, had given her in marriage to a wealthy Egyptian named
Tapert, who was one of his officers at Memphis where he filled
the place of a judge and overseer of revenues. This Tapert, a
kindly-faced, grizzled little man, had fallen in love with my
mother's beauty while he was at court making report to Pharaoh on
matters at Memphis, and especially as to the rebuilding of the
temple of Ptah in that city, with which he had to do. Noting
this, as he noted all, when the time came for Tapert to return to
Memphis, Apries asked him if he desired any gift of Pharaoh whom
he had served well. Tapert made no answer but let his eyes rest
upon my mother who, with other women of the royal household, sat
at a distance broidering linen with Grecian patterns, as she
loved to do.</p>

<p>Apries thought a while, then said,</p>

<p>"Take her, if she will go. For you are a good man, if ugly,
and as your wife she may be happier than here&mdash;as nothing.
Ask her. You have my leave."</p>

<p>So he asked as it was made easy for him to do, and in the end,
although she loved the pomp and pleasures of the court, my mother
listened to him, knowing him for a very rich and honest man of
good blood and station, one, too, whom she could rule. So it came
about that while she was still a young and beautiful woman, for
the Greeks do not wither as early as do the Egyptians, by the
permission of Pharaoh my mother was married according to the full
custom to the Count Tapert, a man of many offices and titles who
settled wealth upon her should he die. Thus it happened that she
went to live with him at Memphis, while I stayed behind at
Sais.</p>

<p>Our parting was sad, although after my childhood we had met
but little, because the laws of the court kept us apart.</p>

<p>"Hearken, my son," she said to me. "I make this marriage for a
double reason. When I was but a child I was delivered into the
hands of Pharaoh, who soon forgot me in favour of others who came
after, but because I had borne him a son, treated me honourably.
Now while I am still fair I have opportunity to leave this cage
with golden bars, and to become a free woman as the wife of a
rich and honest man who loves me, one by whom I shall be
cherished, and I take it thankfully who, if I stayed here, might
one day find myself thrown into the street. Yet not altogether
for my own sake, because it means that we must be parted; also,
if I am loved, I do not love. Know, my son, that what I do, I do
for you more even than for myself. Here in the palace you are
highly placed; the Pharaoh looks upon you with favour; there are
some who think that in the end he will make a prince of you and,
having no lawful heirs of the royal blood, name you to follow
after him. It may be that this is in his mind. But if so I am
sure that it could never come about while your mother, the
Grecian slave, remained at court to remind the great ones of
Egypt that you are base-born of a woman whose people the
Egyptians hate, whereas if I go away this may be forgotten,
though I fear that your skin will always tell its own story.</p>

<p>"Nor is this all. As Tapert has whispered to me, Pharaoh is
rich; Pharaoh is powerful and under him the people have
prosperity, the arts flourish and their gods are better served
than they have been for many an age, all of which comes about
because Egypt is guarded by the Greeks whom Pharaoh hires. Yet he
says that they hate those guardians, they who will not protect
themselves, and it may well happen that from this hatred trouble
will come, bringing with it the fall of Pharaoh and of those of
his House. Therefore, should that chance, I would make ready a
refuge for you, my son.</p>

<p>"Tapert is very rich, as he has told me, one of the richest
men in Egypt, although few know it, and henceforth all he has is
mine, and what is mine is yours, for I do not think that I shall
ever bear him children. Therefore, in the hour of trouble
remember always that there is a place where you can lay your
head, my son of the royal blood of Egypt, whose throne you still
may win by help of the wealth that I can give you, and thereby
make me, a Grecian slave bought for her beauty, the mother of a
king."</p>

<p>Thus she spoke and as she did so I read her heart, who
although I was so young had knowledge of the court ladies and
their ways. She went because she thought it no longer safe to
stay near to Pharaoh who was weary of the sight of her and of her
importunities for gifts and honours, and might at any time cast
her out. Still I was sad, for I who had no one else to love,
loved my mother however vain and foolish she might be.</p>

<p>So she departed and became the wife of Tapert, Pharaoh making
many gifts to her. But I stayed on at court and grew in strength
and stature, also in favour with Pharaoh. Hence it came about
that I was advanced beyond my station and made a Count of Egypt
and a Companion of the King with other offices and titles, seeing
which all men bowed down to me, thinking that in days to come,
although I was base-born and half a Greek, I still might sit
where Pharaoh sat. And so it might have chanced had it not been
decreed otherwise and had not Hathor, whom the Greeks call
Aphrodite, lit a flame of love within my heart that burned me up
and wellnigh brought me to my death.</p>

<p>It happened thus. The King of Babylon had attacked certain
peoples in Syria of whom the chief king was named Abibal, an old
man. Now in the fighting the Babylonians were driven back, or
rather had retired purposing to return at their own season with a
larger army&mdash;it might be next year, or the year after, or
the year after that, as it suited them, to burn the cities of
Abibal and his allies and to slay their peoples or take them
captive.</p>

<p>Now in this fighting the old king Abibal was wounded with an
arrow in the thigh, which wound festered so that in the end he
died. Before he died he determined to seek the aid of Apries, the
Pharaoh of Egypt, against the Babylonians. Therefore since he
trusted no one else, he left command that a young wife of his
named Atyra, whom he had married in his age, the daughter of
another Syrian king, should go in person to the court of Egypt
and lay the cause of her country before Pharaoh, so that he might
send an army to defend it from the Babylonians. For this old king
cared nothing of what might happen to his young wife after he was
dead, or who should take her, but for his people, and the other
peoples who were his allies, he cared much.</p>

<p>So he bound the Queen Atyra by a solemn oath to do his
bidding, calling down the curse of his spirit and that of his
gods upon her if she failed therein, and she who was youthful and
desired to see new lands, and above all Egypt, swore all that he
wished readily enough, after which he died and was buried. When
he had been sealed up in his tomb Queen Atyra, a woman of great
beauty who had been brought up in statecraft, with a voice so
sweet and a mind so subtle that she could win any man to her
will, started upon her journey in much pomp and bearing many
gifts, leaving her dead lord's successor seated upon his
throne.</p>

<p>At length having passed all dangers and escaped from a troop
of the Babylonians that was sent out to capture her, she came
safely to Egypt and encamping at a little distance from Sais,
despatched messengers to Pharaoh to announce her and ask his
safeguard for herself and her companions. As it chanced I,
Ramose, now a young man in my twentieth year, was the captain of
the guard that day; therefore it fell to me to receive these
messengers and bring them before Pharaoh and his officers.</p>

<p>He listened to their tale of which already he knew something
from his spies and those who served him in Syria. Then, having
consulted with his councillors and scribes, he beckoned to me and
when I came and bowed before him, said,</p>

<p>"Ramose, take an escort with you and ride out to the camp of
this lady Atyra, and say to her that it is too late for me to
answer her prayer to-day when the sun is already near to setting,
but that I will consider of it to-morrow. Talk with her yourself,
if you can, for she will suspect no guile in one so young, but at
least spend the night at her camp learning all that you are able
concerning her and her business, and to-morrow at the dawn return
to make report to me."</p>

<p>So I went clad in the Grecian armour that Apries had commanded
the guard to wear, thereby giving much offence to the Egyptian
generals and soldiers, taking my newest cloak and mounted on a
fine horse of the Arab breed. Indeed, having heard through the
messengers that this lady was young and beautiful, I desired to
look my best, for to tell the truth, like many youths of my age I
was somewhat vain and wished to please the eyes of women.
Moreover this was not altogether strange, seeing that all thought
me comely, who was tall and well-shaped, having clear-cut
Grecian features that I inherited from my mother, brown hair that
curled upon my head and large dark eyes, the gift of my Egyptian
blood. Further, I was ready of speech and could talk of anything,
though in truth as yet I knew little, all of which I do not shame
to write now when I am old. Lastly I must add this, though it is
not to my credit; that I was too fond of women and made love to
them when the chance came my way, which was often at the court of
Sais. Or perhaps they made love to me &mdash;I do not know; at
least none of them had really touched my heart, or I theirs.</p>

<p>Thus, full of youth and goodliness and the lust of life and
all the gifts that the gods give us when we are young, of which
we think so little until we have grown old and they are gone,
followed by my escort I galloped forth proud of my mission and
hoping for adventure. For little did I know that I rode into the
arms of terror and of sorrow.</p>

<h2><a id="chap2"></a>CHAPTER 2<br>

THE CUP OF HATHOR</h2>

<p class="first">
AN hour later, guided by the messengers, one of whom had gone
on ahead to warn this lady Atyra of my coming, I caught sight of
her camp set upon the sand at the edge of the cultivated land,
and noted that it was large. The tents were many, dark in colour,
most of them, for they were woven of camel hair after the Arab
fashion, but in their midst was a great white pavilion dyed with
stripes of blue and red, over which fluttered a strange,
three-pointed flag which seemed to be blazoned with stars of gold.</p>

<p>This banner, I guessed, must mark the resting-place of the
lady Atyra who called herself a queen. What sort of a queen was
she, I wondered. Thick-made and black probably, though these
Syrians whom in my ignorance I believed to be swarthy folk,
thought her fair, as indeed all queens are fair according to
those who serve them.</p>

<p>Whilst I was musing thus we came to the camp and must pass
between two lines of camels, many of which were lying down
chewing their food. Now like most horses, mine, a spirited beast,
hated the sight and smell of camels and growing restive, took the
bit between its teeth in such fashion that I could not hold it.
Rushing forward it headed straight for the great pavilion with
the coloured stripes. Soldiers or servants sprang forward to stay
the beast, but without avail, for it overthrew one of them,
causing the rest to fly. On we went, till at the very door of the
tent my horse caught its feet in a rope and fell, hurling me
straight through the open entrance. Over and over I rolled and
though my bones were unharmed, for the sand was covered with
thick carpets, the breath was shaken out of me, so that for a
while I sat gasping with my helmet all awry like to that of a
drunken soldier.</p>

<p>The sound of laughter reached me, very gentle laughter that
reminded me of water rippling over stones. Also there was other
coarser laughter such as might come from the throats of slaves or
eunuchs or of serving-girls. It made me very angry, so much so
that being half-stunned, with what breath I had left I said words
I should not have uttered, adding that I was Pharaoh's envoy.</p>

<p>"And if so, Sir, is this the fashion in which Pharaoh's envoys
enter the presence of those whom it pleases Pharaoh to honour?"
asked a silvery voice, speaking in the Grecian tongue though with
a soft and foreign accent.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, "if they set stinking camels to frighten
their horses and lay ropes to snare their feet."</p>

<p>Then the blood went to my head and I suppose that I fainted
for a while.</p>

<p>When my sense returned I found myself stretched upon a couch
and heard that same voice giving orders both in Greek and in the
Babylonian or Chaldean tongue of which I knew something through
the teaching of my tutor, Belus, also in others that I did not
know, all of which talk concerned myself.</p>

<p>"Take that helm from his head," said the soft voice, though
not softly. "O daughter of a fool, can you not see that you are
pressing the edge of it upon the bruise? Away with you! Let me do
it. So. Now remove the breastplate &mdash;that is easy for the
straps have burst&mdash;and open the tunic to give him air. What
a white skin he has for an Egyptian. Any woman would be proud of
it. By the gods he is a noble-looking youth and if he dies, as he
may for I think his neck is twisted, those who tied the camels
there and left the ropes lying shall pay for it. Now, wine. Where
is the wine? Lift him gently and pour some down his throat. Nay,
not so. Would you drown the man? Hand me the cup. Has that old
leech been found? If not, bid him get himself back to Syria as
best he may&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then I opened my eyes to the lids of which leaden weights
seemed to have been tied. They met the glance of other eyes above
me, very beautiful eyes that were neither blue nor black, but
something between the two. Also I became aware that a white arm
was supporting my head and that the fair and rounded breast of a
very beautiful woman who was kneeling beside me, touched my
own.</p>

<p>"I am the envoy of the Pharaoh Apries, King of the two Lands
and of the countries beyond the sea. The Pharaoh says&mdash;" I
began in feeble tones, repeating the lesson that I had
learned.</p>

<p>"Never mind what the Pharaoh says," answered she who leant
over me in a rich, low voice. "Like most of his messages of which
I have had many, I doubt not that it will serve as well to-morrow
as to-day. Drink this wine and lie quiet for a while&mdash;that
is, if your neck is not broken."</p>

<p>So I drank and lay still, thankful enough to do so for I had
fallen on my head and been much shaken, having clung with my
hands to the reins of my horse as I had been taught to do in the
military school, instead of stretching them out to protect
myself. The wine was good and warmed me; also it seemed to clear
my brain, so that soon I was able to look about me and take
note.</p>

<p>I saw that the pavilion in which I lay was finer than any that
I had ever known, being hung all round with beautiful mats or
carpets that shone like silk wherever the light fell upon them.
Also there was a table at its end set with vessels of gold and
silver, and round it folding stools made of ebony inlaid with
ivory and piled with cushions, and a brazier that stood upon a
tripod, for the desert air was chill, wherein burnt wood that
gave out sweet odours. Moreover there were hanging lamps of
silver that presently were lit by a swarthy eunuch, for now night
was closing in, which burned with a clear white flame and like
the fire gave out scents.</p>

<p>The eunuch, clad in his rich apparel and head-dress of twisted
silk, glanced at me out of his oblong eyes and went away, leaving
me alone in that perfumed place. Lying thus upon my soft,
cushioned bed, a strange mood took hold of me, as it does at
times of those whose brains reel under the weight of some heavy
blow. I seemed to lose all sense of time and place; I seemed to
be floating on a cloud above the earth, looking backwards and
forwards. Far away behind me was a wall or mass of blackness out
of which I crawled, a tiny, naked child, into the light of day.
Then came visions of my infancy, little matters in my life that I
had long forgotten, words that my mother had murmured into my
baby ears, her caresses when I was sick; the softness of her
cheek as she pressed it against my fevered brow, and I know not
what besides. And all this while I, the infant in her arms,
seemed to be asking this question of her,</p>

<p>"Mother, whence came I and why am I here?"</p>

<p>To which she answered, "I do not know, my child. The gods will
tell you &mdash;when you are dead."</p>

<p>The stream of time flowed on. Yes, it was a stream, for I saw
it flowing, and on it I floated, clutching day by day at sticks
and straws wherewith I built me a house of life, as a bird builds
its nest, till at last I saw myself falling from the horse and
for a moment all grew dark. Then out of the darkness there
appeared shadowy shapes, some beautiful, some terrible, and I
knew that these were the spirits of the future showing me their
gifts. They passed by and once more before me was a black wall
such as that whence I had seemed to come in the beginning, which
wall I knew was Death. I searched to find some opening but could
discover none. I sank down, outworn and terrified, and lo! as I
sank there appeared a glorious gateway, and beyond it a city of
many palaces and temples in whose courts walked gods, or men who
looked like gods.</p>

<p>My vision passed and I awoke, wondering where that city might
be and if within it I should find any habitation.</p>

<p>It was a foolish dream, yet I set it down because I think it
told me something of the mystery of birth and death. Or rather it
set out these mysteries, revealing nothing, for who knows what
lies beyond those black walls that are our Alpha and Omega and
between which we spell out the alphabet of Life. Also it was not
altogether foolish, for even then I knew that the shapes of
terror which seemed to wait upon my path were portents of
advancing woe&mdash;and trembled...</p>

<p>It must have been the dead of night when I awoke thus out of
my swoon, for now there was no sound in the camp, save the
tramping of the sentries and the howling of distant dogs or
jackals smitten of the moon. In the pavilion the scented lamps
burned low or had been shaded, so that the place was filled with
a soft gloom, in which shadows seemed to move, caused no doubt by
the swinging of the lamps in the draught of the night air. Yet
one of these shadows, the most palpable of them all, did not
move; indeed it seemed to stand over me like a ghost that waits
the passing of one whom it has loved. I grew afraid and stirred,
thinking to speak, whereon the shadow turned its head so that the
light of the lamp fell upon the beautiful face of a woman.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" I asked in a whisper, for I seemed to fear to
speak aloud.</p>

<p>A sweet voice answered,</p>

<p>"O Ramose, Pharaoh's son and envoy, I am your hostess Atyra,
once a queen."</p>

<p>"And what do you here, Queen Atyra?"</p>

<p>"I watch you, my guest, in your swoon."</p>

<p>"A poor task, Lady, more fitting to a leech or slave."</p>

<p>"I think not, Ramose, son of the king, as I have been told
that you are by your escort and others. There is much to be
learned from those who sleep by one who has the gift of reading
souls."</p>

<p>"Is it your gift, Lady?"</p>

<p>"I have been taught it by wise men in Syria, <i>magi</i> the
Persians call them, and as I think not quite in vain. At least I
have read your soul."</p>

<p>"Then, Lady, you have read that which is worth nothing, for
what is written upon so short a scroll?"</p>

<p>"Much, Count Ramose, for our life is like the chapters of a
book, and already at our birth Fate has stamped the titles of
those chapters upon its clay, leaving it to Time to write the
rest. Your story, I think, will be long, if sad in part. Yet it
was not to talk of such things that I have come here alone at
night."</p>

<p>"Why, then, did you come, Lady?"</p>

<p>"First to see how you fared, for your fall was heavy, and
secondly, if you were well enough, to hear your message."</p>

<p>"It is short, Lady. Pharaoh bids me say that he will answer
your requests to-morrow, since to-day it is too late."</p>

<p>"Yet it was not too late for him to send you, Count Ramose,
charged with words that mean nothing. I will tell you why he sent
you; it was to spy upon me and make report to him."</p>

<p>Thus she said, resting her chin upon her hand and looking at
me with her great dark eyes which shone in the lamplight like to
those of a night-bird, but I remained silent.</p>

<p>"You do not answer, O Ramose, because you cannot. Well, your
office is easy, for I will tell you all there is to learn. The
old king, Abibal, whose wife I was in name, is dead, and dying
left a charge upon me&mdash;to save his country from the
Babylonians, calling down the curse of all the gods upon my head
in life and on my soul in death, should I fail by my own fault to
fulfil his dying prayer. Therefore I have come to Egypt, although
the oracles warned me against this journey, for the case of these
Syrians is very hard and desperate, and in Egypt lies their only
hope who alone cannot stand against the might of Babylon. Tell
me, Son of the king, will Apries help us?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, Lady," I answered, "but I do know that least
of all things does he, or Egypt, desire a war against Babylon.
You must plead your own cause with him; I cannot answer your
question."</p>

<p>"How can I plead my cause, Count Ramose? I bring great gifts
of gold and silks and spices, but what are these to him who holds
the wealth of Egypt? I can promise allegiance and service, but my
people are far away and Egypt seeks no war in which they can be
used."</p>

<p>Again I answered that I did not know, then added,</p>

<p>"Yet your nation could have found no better envoy, for Pharaoh
loves a beautiful woman."</p>

<p>"Do you think me beautiful?" she asked softly. "Well, to tell
truth, so have others, though as yet such favour as I have, has
brought me little joy &mdash;" and she sighed, adding slowly, "Of
what use is beauty to her who has found none to love?"</p>

<p>"I know little of such things, Lady. Yet, perhaps for you the
search is not finished."</p>

<p>She looked at me a while before she answered,</p>

<p>"My heart tells me that you are right, O Ramose. The search is
not finished."</p>

<p>Then she rose and taking a cup of wine gave me to drink of it,
afterwards drinking a little herself as though to pledge me.</p>

<p>This done, she poured the rest of the wine upon the ground,
like to one who makes an offering before some god, bent down so
close that her scented breath beat upon my brow, whispered to me
to sleep well, and glided away.</p>

<p>I think there must have been some medicine in that wine, for
presently all the pain left my head and neck and I fell fast
asleep, yet not so fast but that through the long hours I seemed
to dream of the loveliness of this Syrian queen, until at length
I was awakened by the sunlight shining in my eyes.</p>

<p>A servant who must have been watching me, noted this and went
away as though to call some one. Then an old man came, one with a
white beard who wore a strange-shaped cap.</p>

<p>"Greeting, Sir," he said in bad Greek. "As you may guess, I am
the court physician. Most unhappily I was absent last night,
seeking for certain plants that are said to grow in Egypt, which
must be gathered by the light of the moon, since otherwise they
lose their virtue; indeed, I returned but an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Is it so, Physician?" I answered. "Well, I trust that you
found your herbs."</p>

<p>"Yes, young sir, I found them in plenty and gathered them with
the appropriate spells. Yet I would I had never learned their
name, for I hear that my mistress is very wrath with me because I
was not present when you chanced to roll into the tent like a
stone thrown from a catapult, and may the gods help him with whom
she is wrath! Still I see that you live who, I was told, had a
broken neck. Now let me see what harm you have taken, if
any."</p>

<p>Then he called to the eunuch to come within the screens that
had been set round me, and strip me naked. When this was done, he
examined me with care, setting his ear against my breast and
back, and feeling me all over with his hands.</p>

<p>"By Bel, or whatever god you worship," he said, "you have a
fine shape, young lord, one well fitted for war&mdash;or love.
Nor can I find that there is aught amiss with you, save a bruise
upon your shoulder and a lump at the back of your head. No bone
is broken, that I will swear. Stand up now and let me treat you
with my ointments."</p>

<p>I stood up, to find myself little the worse save for a
dizziness which soon passed away, and was rubbed with his
aromatics, and afterwards washed and clothed. Then I was led out
of the pavilion to where my men were camped, who rejoiced to see
me living and sound, for a rumour had reached them that I was
dead. With them I ate and a while later was summoned to the
presence of the Queen Atyra.</p>

<p>So once more I entered the pavilion, to find this royal lady
seated in a chair made of sycamore wood inlaid with ivory. I
bowed to her and she bowed back to me, giving no sign that she
had ever seen me before. Indeed she looked at me with her large
eyes as though I were a stranger to her, and I looked at her clad
in her rich robes over which flowed her black abundant hair, and
marvelled at her beauty, for it was great and moved me.</p>

<p>I will not set out all our talk; indeed after these many years
much of it is forgotten, though that which we held at midnight I
remember well, when we were but man and woman together, and not
as now, an envoy and a foreign queen discussing formal matters of
state. The sum of it was that she grieved to hear of my
mischance, and prayed me to accept a stallion of the Syrian breed
in place of my own which had been lamed through the carelessness
of her servants, but rejoiced to know from her physician that
beyond a blow which stunned me for a while, I had taken little
harm.</p>

<p>I thanked her and delivered Pharaoh's message, at which she
smiled and said that it told her nothing, except that she must
wait where she was, until it pleased him to send another.
Meanwhile she hoped that I would be her guest as the physician
told her I was not yet fit to ride.</p>

<p>Now as this plan pleased me well, for to tell truth I longed
for more of the company of that most lovely woman, I summoned the
scribe who was amongst those who rode with me, and wrote a letter
to Pharaoh, telling him of what had chanced, which letter I
despatched in charge of two of my guard. They departed, and at
evening returned again, bringing an answer signed by Pharaoh's
private scribe, which bade me stay till I was able to travel, and
then accompany the Queen Atyra to the court.</p>

<p>So there I remained that night, being given a tent to sleep in
near to the pavilion. In the evening also I was bidden to eat
with the queen and certain of her councillors, when, as she alone
knew the Grecian tongue, the talk lay between her and me. Indeed
as soon as the meal was finished she made some sign whereat these
men rose and went away, leaving us alone.</p>

<p>The night was very hot, so hot that presently she said,</p>

<p>"Come, my young guest, if it pleases you, let us leave this
tented oven, and walk a while beneath the moon, breathing the
desert air. No need to call your guard, for here you are as safe
as though you sat in Pharaoh's palace."</p>

<p>I answered that it pleased me well, and calling for two of her
women to accompany us, we set forth, the queen wearing a hooded,
silken cloak that the women brought to her, which covered her
white shape and glittering jewels like a veil. I too was wrapped
in a cloak, since I wore no armour, and thus, we thought, the
pair of us passed unnoted through the camp.</p>

<p>At a distance on the crest of a sandy hill, stood the ruin of
some old temple overlooking the cultivated land and the broad
waters of the Nile. Thither we wended followed by the two women;
at least at first we were followed by them, but later when I
looked I could not see them any more. Still of this I said
nothing who was well content to be alone with this gracious and
beautiful lady. We came to the temple and entered its hoary
courts whence a jackal fled away, as did a night-bird perched
upon a cornice, telling me that here there was no man. At the far
end of the court there remained a statue of Hathor, one of a
pair, for the other had fallen. That it was Hathor might easily
be known for she wore the vulture cap and above it horns between
which rested the disc of the moon. Near to the feet of this
statue in the shadow of a wall, Atyra sat herself down upon a
broken block of alabaster, motioning to me to place myself at her
side.</p>

<p>"What goddess is this," she asked, "who carries the horns of a
beast upon the brow of a fair woman?"</p>

<p>"Hathor, goddess of Love," I answered, "whom some call
Mistress of the gods."</p>

<p>"Is it so? Well, by this title or by that she is known in
every land, and well is she named Mistress of the gods and men.
Strange that amidst all this ruin she alone should have stood
through the long centuries, an emblem of love that does not die.
How beautiful is the night! See the great moon riding in yonder
cloudless sky. Look at her rays glittering on the river's face
and hark to the breeze whispering among the palms beneath. Truly
such a night should be dear to Hathor, so dear that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here she broke off her dreamy talk, then said suddenly,</p>

<p>"Tell me of yourself, Prince Ramose."</p>

<p>"Do not give me that title," I exclaimed. "If it were heard it
might bring trouble on me who am but a Count of Egypt by
Pharaoh's grace!"</p>

<p>"Yet it is yours, Ramose," she answered, "and in this place
there is none to hear save Hathor and the moon. Now speak."</p>

<p>So I told her my short tale, to which she listened as though
it had been that of the deeds of a king; then said,</p>

<p>"But you have left out the half of it all. You have left out
Hathor."</p>

<p>"I do not understand," I answered, looking down to hide my
blushes.</p>

<p>"I mean that you have left out love. Tell me of those whom you
have loved. Do you not know that it is of love that all women
wish most to hear?"</p>

<p>"I cannot, Lady, for I have&mdash;never loved."</p>

<p>"If that be true, how deep a cup of love is left for you to
drink, whose lips have not yet sipped its wine, Ramose. So here
in the shadow of Hathor sit a pair of us, for to give you truth
for truth, I tell you that though I am your elder, I too have
never loved."</p>

<p>"Yet you are a widow," I said astonished.</p>

<p>"Aye, the widow of an aged man who married me because of my
birth, my wit, my wealth, and the great friends I brought him,
and whom I married to serve my people that were threatened, as
his are to-day, by the giant might of Babylon. Abibal was to me a
father and no more, if a beloved father whose commands I will
execute to the death, which commands bring me upon a long and
perilous journey to seek help from mighty Pharaoh who desires to
give me none."</p>

<p>Now I glanced at her sideways, and said,</p>

<p>"You are very beauteous, Lady. You have the eyes of a dove,
the step of a deer, the wisdom of a man and the grace of a palm.
Were there then none who pleased your eyes about your court in
Syria?"</p>

<p>"While my lord lived I was blind, as became a loyal wife," she
answered.</p>

<p>"And now that he is dead, Lady?"</p>

<p>"Oh! now I cannot say. No more do I seek a husband who am a
queen and would remain free, the slave of no one, for what
slavery is there like to that of marriage? Yet it is true that I
desire love, if I may choose that love. Come; let us be going,
for yonder Egyptian Hathor of yours casts her spell over me and
brings thoughts that for long I have forbidden in my heart. I
think that this is an evil-omened place; its goddess tells of
love, but its hoar ruins tell of death. Doubtless did we but know
it, here we sit above the shrouded dead who, staring at us from
their sepulchres, mock our beating hearts which soon will be as
still as theirs. Come; let us be going, who yet are young and
free from the webs of Hathor and of death. Death, I defy thee
while I may. Hathor, I make a mock of thee and thy calm,
compelling gaze. Dost thou not also make a mock of Hathor,
Ramose?" and turning, she looked at me with her great eyes that
seemed to glow in the shadows like to those of an owl.</p>

<p>"I do not know," I answered faintly, for those eyes drew the
strength out of me. "Yet it is dangerous to mock at any goddess,
and most of all at Hathor. Still, let us go, I think it very wise
that we should go; the scent of your hair overwhelms me who have
been ill. My brain rocks like a boat upon the sea. Hathor has me
by the hand."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think that Hathor has us both by the heart," she
answered in her low rich voice, a voice of honey.</p>

<p>Then our lips met, for there in her temple we had drunk of
Hathor's cup.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap3"></a>CHAPTER 3<br>

THE COUNSEL OF BELUS</h2>

<p class="first">
WE rose; her face was like the dawn, her eyes were dewy, but I
trembled like a leaf, I whose heart for the first time love had
gripped with cruel hands.</p>

<p>I thought I saw a shadow flit across a pool of moonlight that
lay within the temple's broken pylon, the shadow of a man.</p>

<p>"What frightens you?" she asked.</p>

<p>I told her in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Perchance it was a spirit of which this place must be full,
for such, they say, look like shadows. Or perchance it was thrown
from the broad wings of some fowl of the night," she answered
lightly. "At least if it be otherwise, that watcher was too far
away to have seen us here, seated side by side in gloom.
Certainly he could not have heard our words. Yet, Ramose,
Hathor's gift to me, I would warn you. Among those who sat with
us at the board to-night, did you take note of one, a bearded man
of middle age, hook-nosed, with flashing eyes like to those of a
hawk?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lady Atyra, and I thought that he looked askance at
me."</p>

<p>"It may be so. Listen. That man was a councillor of Abibal's,
a priest of his god also, and as such one of great power in the
land. Always he has pursued me with his love, and now he would
wed me. But I hate him, as hitherto I have hated all men, and
will have none of him. Moreover," here her voice grew hard and
cold, "when I am strong enough I will be rid of him, but that is
not yet. If I can win Pharaoh's friendship and bring it to pass
that he names me to succeed to the throne of Abibal, as his
subject queen, then and not till then shall I be strong enough,
for this Ninari has a large following and the half of my escort
are sworn to him. Meanwhile, have no fear and be sure that in
this, our first kiss, I pledged my heart to you and to no other
man."</p>

<p>"I thank you, O most Beautiful," I answered. "Yet tell me,
Lady, how can this matter end? You have been a queen and will be
one again, while I am but Pharaoh's base-born son, one of many,
though I think that he loves me best of all of them. Also I am
young and unproved. What then can there be between us?"</p>

<p>"Everything before all is done, I think, Ramose, if you will
but trust to me who am wise and strong in my fashion, and being
alas! older than you are, have seen and learned more. Already I
have a plan. I will persuade Pharaoh to send you with me to
Syria, there to be his eyes and envoy, and once back in my own
country I will be rid of this Ninari and will take you as my
husband, saying that such is Pharaoh's will."</p>

<p>"May that day come soon!" I muttered, who already was as full
of love of this royal woman, as a drunkard is with wine.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we had left the temple, and were walking side by
side but not too near, down the slope of sand towards the camp.
As we went, from a clump of stunted sycamores appeared the two
waiting-ladies whom Atyra chided because they had not followed
her more closely.</p>

<p>They answered that they had seen a man who looked like a thief
of the desert, watching them and being afraid, had taken refuge
among the trees till he went away down towards the river. Then
they had come out but could not find us, and therefore returned
to the trees and waited, not knowing what else to do.</p>

<p>"You should have run back to the camp and fetched a guard,"
she answered angrily. "For is it meet that the Lady Atyra should
wander unaccompanied in the night?"</p>

<p>Then she dismissed them and they fell behind us, but although
I was young and knew little of women's tricks, the only thing I
believed about that tale, was that they had seen a man, perchance
the same whose shadow flitted across the moonlight within the
broken pylon.</p>

<p>When we reached the camp and had passed the sentries in front
of the pavilion, we met the councillor and priest Ninari, who
seemed to be waiting there, doubtless for our return. He bowed
low and spoke to the queen in a Syrian tongue which I did not
understand, and in that tongue she answered him, somewhat
sharply, as I thought. Again he bowed low, almost to the ground
indeed, but all the while I felt that his fierce eyes were fixed
upon me. Then with some courteous words to myself, thanking me
for my company, she passed into the pavilion.</p>

<p>I, too, turned to go to my own quarters where my escort
awaited me, when this Ninari stepped in front of me and said in
bad and guttural Greek,</p>

<p>"Young lord from the Pharaoh's court, your pardon, but I would
have you know that whatever may be the fashions of Egypt, it is
not our custom for strangers to walk alone with a great lady at
night, especially if she chances to be our queen."</p>

<p>Now there was something in the man's voice and manner which
stirred my blood, and I answered, holding my head high,</p>

<p>"Sir, I am a guest here and Pharaoh's envoy, and I go where my
hostess asks me to go, whatever may be your Syrian customs."</p>

<p>"You are strangely favoured," he said sneering. "Your horse
which you cannot manage, hurls you like a sack stuffed with
barley into the presence of our mistress. She doctors your
bruised poll, and now takes you out walking in the moonlight.
Well, well, I should remember that you are but a forward,
cross-bred Egyptian boy, well-looking enough as bastards of your
kind often are in their youth, just such a one as it pleases
grown women to play with for an hour and then cast aside."</p>

<p>I listened to this string of insults welling like venom from
the black heart of the jealous Syrian. At first they amazed me to
whom no such words had ever been used before. Then as the meaning
of his coarse taunts, hissed out in broken Greek, came home to
me, being no coward I grew enraged.</p>

<p>"Dog!" I said, "beast of a Syrian, do you dare to talk thus to
Pharaoh's envoy, a Count of Egypt?" and lifting my arm I, who was
a trained boxer, doubled my fist and smote him in the face with
all my strength, so that he went headlong to the ground.</p>

<p>At the sound of my raised voice men ran together from here and
there &mdash;some of them those of my own escort whose tents were
near at hand, some of them Syrians&mdash;and stood staring as
this Ninari went backward to the earth. In a moment he was up
again, blood pouring from his hooked nose, and came at me, a
curved and naked blade in his hand, which I suppose he had drawn
as he rose. Seeing this, I too drew my short Grecian sword and
faced him, though there was this difference between us, that
whereas I had no armour, being clothed only in a festal dress of
linen, he wore a coat of Syrian mail. My men, noting this, would
have thrown themselves between us, but I shouted to them to stand
aside. The Syrians would have done likewise, but at some command
that I did not hear, they also fell back. Thus we were left
facing each other in the full moonlight which was almost as clear
as that of day.</p>

<p>Ninari smote at me with his broad, curved blade. I bent almost
to my knee and the blow went over my head. Rising, I thrust back.
My sword-point struck him full beneath the breast but could not
pierce his good armour, though it caused him to reel and stumble.
Again he came at me, smiting lower to catch me on the body which
he knew was unprotected, and this time I must leap far backwards,
so that the point of his blade did no more than cut through my
linen garment and just scratch the skin beneath.</p>

<p>Yet that scratch stung me, more perhaps than a deeper wound
would have done, and made me mad. Uttering some old Greek war-cry,
as I think one my mother had taught me as that of her
father's House, I flew at the man and smote him full upon his
helm, shearing off one side of it and causing him to stagger.
Before he could recover himself I smote again and though the
steel glanced from the edge of his severed helm, yet passing
downwards, it cut off his right ear and sank deep into his neck
and shoulder.</p>

<p>He fell and lay there, as it was thought, dead. The Syrians
began to murmur for they did not love to see a noted warrior of
their race thus defeated by an unarmoured youth. My men, fearing
trouble, ringed me round, muttering such words as:</p>

<p>"Well done, young Ramose!" "You have lopped that cur's ear,
Count, although he wore a collar when you had none." "Now if any
other Syrian would like a turn&mdash;" and so forth, for this
escort of mine, some of them Greek and some Egyptian, were all
picked fighters of Pharaoh's guard, and rejoiced that their boy
officer should have won in so uneven a fray.</p>

<p>The business grew dangerous; the friends of Ninari drew their
weapons and waved spears. My escort made a ring about me in the
Grecian fashion, their swords stretched out in front of them.
Then I heard a woman's voice cry,</p>

<p>"Have done! Fools, would you bring Pharaoh's wrath upon us and
cause our country's prayer to him to be refused? If this young
Egyptian lord has done ill, let Pharaoh judge him."</p>

<p>"Queen," I broke in, panting between my words, "I have done no
ill. This follower of yours," and I pointed to Ninari who lay
upon the sand groaning, "for no cause bespattered me with the
vile mud of insults, till at length unable to bear more, I felled
him with my hand. He rose and although I wear no mail, sprang at
me to slay me with his sword. So I must defend myself as best I
might. There are many here who can bear witness that I speak the
truth."</p>

<p>"It is needless, Count Ramose," she answered in a clear voice,
"for know that I heard and saw something of this business and
hold that you were scarcely to blame, save that you should have
taken no heed of mad or wine-bred talk. Yet, lest harm should
come to you and I and my people be put to shame, I pray you leave
this camp now at once and return to Sais whither I will follow
you to-morrow to seek audience of Pharaoh and ask his pardon.
Let the horses of Pharaoh's envoy be made ready."</p>

<p>Men ran to do her bidding, but my guard who looked doubtfully
at the Syrians, remained about me, save two of them who went to
my tent and thence brought my armour which they helped me to gird
on.</p>

<p>Meanwhile that same old leech who had tended me, had been busy
with Ninari whom he ordered to be carried to his tent. Now he
rose and made his report to Atyra.</p>

<p>"The Lord Ninari henceforth must go one-eared," he said. "Also
the Egyptian's sword has cut through his mail and sunk into the
flesh of his shoulder, for the blow was mighty. Yet by chance it
seemed to have missed the big vein of the neck, so unless his
hurts corrupt I think that he will live."</p>

<p>"I pray the gods it may be so," answered Atyra in a cold
voice, "and that henceforth his tongue may remember what has
chanced to his ear. Hear me all! If any lifts a hand against
Pharaoh's envoy or his company because of this matter, he dies.
Farewell, Count Ramose, till we meet again at Sais," and with one
flashing glance of her great eyes, she turned and went, followed
by her women.</p>

<p>A while later I and my guard rode out of the camp, I mounted
upon the desert-bred stallion that the queen had given me in
place of my own beast which was lamed. The Syrians watched us go
in silence, except one fellow who cried out,</p>

<p>"You won that fight, young cock of Egypt, but it will bring
you no good luck who have cropped the ear of the priest Ninari
and earned the curse of his god."</p>

<p>I made no answer, but presently when we were clear of the camp
and riding alone in the moonlight, I began to think to myself
that this visit of mine had been strange and ill-omened. It began
with the fall of my horse, which hurled me, as Ninari had said,
like a sack of barley into the presence of her to whom I was
sent, a mischance which even to this day I cannot remember
without shame. Then came those hours when I lay half-swooning and
in pain, and woke to find that most beautiful queen watching me
alone, which in Egypt we should have thought strange, though
mayhap the Syrians and the desert-dwellers had easier customs. At
last she spoke and told me that she had come thus to read my soul
while I slept. Why should she wish to read the soul of one who
was unknown to her until that day?</p>

<p>Now I bethought me of what had passed between us afterwards in
the ruined temple, and an answer rose in my mind. It must be
because at first sight of my face this lady had been smitten with
love of me, as I had heard sometimes chances to women and to men
also. Could I doubt it with her kiss still burning on my lips?
And yet who knew&mdash;it might be that she did but play a part
to serve her secret ends, which caused her to put out her woman's
strength and make me her slave. Why not?</p>

<p>This love of hers, if love it were, had been most swift. Was
it to be believed that she, my elder by some years, would
suddenly become enamoured of a lad? Was it not easy (as indeed I
knew) for a woman to feign passion? Was it not done every day on
the street or elsewhere? What did a few kisses matter to such a
one? Was I more than a young fool beguiled, and for this
beguilement was there not good reason? I was Pharaoh's son whom
he was known to favour in his fashion because I was well-looking,
quick, and, in a way, learned. Also I was his envoy, one whose
report he would accept. Further, this great Syrian lady desired
Pharaoh's help. What more natural, then, than that she should
strive to win that favoured son and envoy to her interests, and
how could she bind him better to her than with her lips and
wanton hair?</p>

<p>So this was the sum of it, that I knew not whether I were but
a painted plaything or the jewel on her breast. All I knew, alas!
was that she had taken my heart into those soft white hands of
hers and that passion for her burned me up.</p>

<p>Truly it was an evil business and to make it worse I had
quarrelled with and hewn off the ear of that jealous-hearted,
foul-tongued priest-minister of hers, who doubtless hoped to wed
her and thus win a throne. Oh! truly this had been an accursed
journey from which no good could come, as that shouter of a
Syrian had foretold. And yet&mdash;and yet, I was glad to have
made it, for Atyra's kisses burned upon my lips and I longed for
more of them when she came to Sais.</p>

<p>We reached the palace before the dawn and I went to my chamber
and slept, for after all that had chanced to me this night I was
very weary. Also there was time, since none might appear before
Pharaoh until within two hours of midday, after he had made his
offerings to the god and rested. When at length I awoke, the
first thing that my eyes fell upon was the brown, wrinkled face
of my master and friend, the learned Babylonian, Belus.</p>

<p>"Greeting, Ramose," he said. "I heard that you were returned
and as you did not come to me, I have come to you. They are
telling strange stories in the courtyards of your adventures
yonder in the desert, stories that are little to your credit as
an envoy, although they praise you as a man. At least I hear that
your escort speak well of your swordsmanship. Now out with these
tales, for they will go no further than my ears, and for the
rest, perhaps I can give you good counsel."</p>

<p>So because we loved each other, I told him everything from the
beginning to the end. He listened, then said,</p>

<p>"When I entered this chamber, Ramose, I smelt two things, the
scent of a woman's hair and the reek of a man's blood; which was
natural as you have neither bathed your face nor cleaned your
sword. Or perhaps the spirit that is in me did this; it does not
matter. Now what has chanced to you was to be expected, seeing
that you are young and well-favoured, one of a kind that women
will seek out, as butterflies seek the nectar that they love in
the throats of certain infrequent flowers; one, too, whose hand
is shaped to a sword-hilt. So the woman has come and the sword
has swung aloft and now follows the trouble."</p>

<p>He paused a while in thought, then went on,</p>

<p>"As you know, Ramose, in the time that I have to spare from
the writing of letters to Babylon and work or learning of the
useful sort, I follow after divination according to our
Babylonian methods by the help of stars and the shadows that
these throw in crystals or in water, a foolish and uncertain art,
yet one through which now and again peeps the cold eye of Truth.
Last night at least it told me something, namely that you would
do well to take a journey by Pharaoh's leave, say to Memphis to
see your mother, until this half-queen, Atyra, has finished her
business at the court and returned to Syria."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to leave the court at present, Belus," I
answered awkwardly.</p>

<p>"Ah! I guessed as much. They say that though past her youth,
this Syrian woman is very fair and doubtless those experienced
eyes of hers have pierced to your heart and set it afire. Yet I
pray you to go till she has departed back to Syria."</p>

<p>"You speak earnestly, Belus. Tell me, what else did the
starlight show you in your crystal?"</p>

<p>"That which I liked little, Son&mdash;much, and yet nothing.
That light turned to blood&mdash;whose blood I do not know, yet
in the red mist I saw shapes moving and one of them
was&mdash;yours, Ramose."</p>

<p>Now I grew afraid and that I might find time to think, bade
him speak on.</p>

<p>"Hearken, Son. You have tasted a wine that some men desire
more than any other and you would drain the cup. Yet the dregs of
this passionate drink from nature's ancient cup are always bitter
and often deadly or charged with shame. You would make that woman
yours and perchance if she does not play with you, you may
succeed, for I think that she too found the potion sweet. Yet I
say that if so it will be to your sorrow and hers."</p>

<p>"Why should I not love her?" I broke in. "She is beautiful and
wise, she is unwed. Though she be older than I am I would make
her my wife and share her fortunes. May not a man take a wife who
pleases him and whom he pleases?"</p>

<p>"A man may if he is foolish," answered Belus with his quiet
smile, "but what is mere unwisdom for a man, for a lad is often
madness. Moreover this lady lies like a bait in a snare-net full
of policies, high policies that you do not understand. To meddle
with her may bring about a war with Babylon, or perchance may
throw the peoples whose cause she is here to plead, into the arms
of Babylon and thus open Egypt's flank to Egypt's foes. If either
of these troubles happened, do you think you would earn Pharaoh's
thanks? I say that he would curse you and cast you forth, perhaps
over the edge of the world into death's darkness.</p>

<p>"Indeed already one of them has begun. Because of her you have
fought with a priest of her gods that are not your gods or those
of Egypt, or even of the Greeks, black gods and bloody. You have
cut him down and maimed him, even if he is not slain. Do you hold
that this priest and counsellor will suffer those gods or their
worshippers to forget such an outrage against their minister?
Will he not lay that severed ear of his upon their altar and cry
to them for vengeance. Already it seems the Syrians muttered
curses on you as you rode away, and if they come to learn that
you, an alien of another faith, are the favoured lover of their
lady, the widow of their king, through whom since he has left no
children, perchance one of them hopes to win his throne, what
then?</p>

<p>"Lastly, I warn you that this business may end in terrors, or
rather I pass on the warning that my spirit gives me. I pray you,
Ramose, to heed my counsel. Let me go to Pharaoh and ask of him
to send you hence till this embassy is finished. Indeed I would
that I had gone already, as soon as I learned your tale."</p>

<p>Thus he spoke and watching him I noted that he was much in
earnest, for his face had flushed and his hands quivered. Now,
although my flesh rebelled, for I yearned to see Atyra again more
than ever I had yearned for anything, my reason bent itself
before the will of this master of mine, whom I loved and who, as
I knew, loved me. I would accept his decree as though it were
that of an oracle; if Pharaoh permitted, I would go to Memphis or
elsewhere and if I must find a sweetheart, she should be one of a
humbler sort upon whose favours hung no great matters of the
state. Yet, having as it seemed, made conquest of so lovely and
high-placed a lady, a victory of which I was proud indeed, it was
very hard to leave her without reason given or farewell. Still it
should be done&mdash;presently.</p>

<p>"Belus," I said, "wait a little while I bathe myself and
change my garments, and eat a mouthful of food. I think that I
will do as you wish, but you ask much of me and I would have a
space in which to think. Be pleased, therefore, dear Belus, to
grant it to me."</p>

<p>He studied me with his bright and kindly eyes, then
answered,</p>

<p>"Take what you wish, for well I know the vanity of youth and
that if I deny your will, it may turn you against my counsel. I
will wait, though in this matter I hold that delay is folly. Be
swift now, for with every minute that passes, danger draws more
near.</p>

<p>So I withdrew and the black slaves who were my servants, for
in all ways at the palace I was treated as a great lord and even
as a prince, bathed me and clothed me in fresh garments and
dressed my hair. While they did so I ate a little and drank a cup
of wine that was brought to me. These things done I went into the
anteroom where Belus walked to and fro with bowed head.</p>

<p>"What word?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Master," I answered, "I have taken counsel with myself and
though it costs me dear, I bow to your will, knowing that you are
wise, while I am but a lad and full of folly. Go to Pharaoh, lay
all this matter before him, giving it your own colour. Then, if
having heard, he thinks it well that I should depart, I will do
so at once and see the Queen Atyra no more, though thus I earn
her scorn, or even her hate."</p>

<p>"Well spoken, Son!" he answered, "though I would that you had
been less stubborn and had found those words an hour ago. Still,
such sacrifice is hard to the young and I forgive you. Now bide
you here while I wait on Pharaoh in his private chamber to which
I have entry as one whom he consults upon many secret matters,
also on those of his health. Presently I will return with his
commands."</p>

<p>As the words left his lips the curtains at the far end of the
chamber opened and through them came a messenger, clad in the
royal livery, who bowed to me and said,</p>

<p>"King's Son and Count Ramose, Pharaoh commands your presence,
now, at once."</p>

<p>"I obey," I answered but Belus at my side groaned and
muttered,</p>

<p>"All is spoilt! Too late! Too late!"</p>

<h2><a id="chap4"></a>CHAPTER 4<br>

THE FALL OF RAMOSE</h2>

<p class="first">
I WAS led to Pharaoh's private chamber, Belus coming with me.
Here I found him in a troubled and a wrathful mood, and guessed
from his face and those of certain who waited on him, among them
Amasis the General, he who was afterwards destined to become
Pharaoh, that there was evil tidings in the wind. Here I should
write that this Amasis, a fine-looking man though of no high
birth, and a great soldier, was a friend to me to whom he had
taken a fancy while I was still quite a boy. It was under his
command that I had learned all I knew of matters which have to do
with war, the handling of weapons and the leading of men.</p>

<p>"How shall we act?" Pharaoh was saying to Amasis. "There can
be no doubt that the King of Babylon intends to threaten, if not
to attack Egypt now that he has finished with those Hebrews.
Moreover it is the matter of the Syrian tribes over whom Abibal
was king that has brought the business to a head. Nebuchadnezzar,
or whoever holds the real power in Babylon now that he is sunk in
age, has heard of the embassy of the Queen Atyra to me, and
purposes to be beforehand with us, fearing lest we should aid the
Syrians. That is why he sends an army against Egypt."</p>

<p>"I hold that it is but a feint, Pharaoh," answered Amasis,
"for as yet the Babylonians have not strength upon the frontier
for so vast an enterprise. The best plan is to be bold. Do you
send me with another army to guard our borders, and meanwhile
speak this queen fair, lest suddenly she, or her Syrians, should
turn round, make peace with Babylon and join in the onslaught.
Then the danger would be great because those Syrian tribes are
countless."</p>

<p>"Good counsel, or so I think," said Pharaoh. "Do you set about
gathering troops, friend Amasis, and make all things ready, but
as quietly as may be."</p>

<p>At this moment his eye fell upon me, and he said,</p>

<p>"So you are back, son Ramose. Now tell me what is all this
tale I hear about you? First it seems you tumble off your horse
and make yourself a laughing-stock to the Syrians, and next you
quarrel with one of them, a dangerous fellow and a priest called
Ninari of whom I have heard before, and crop him of an ear. I am
angry with you. What have you to say?"</p>

<p>"Only this, Pharaoh," I answered. "It was my horse that
tumbled over a rope, not I, and for the rest the Syrian insulted
me, using words that you would not have wished your son to
suffer; no, nor any gentleman of Egypt."</p>

<p>"Why did he insult you, Ramose? Had you perchance drunk too
much of that strong Syrian wine?"</p>

<p>"Not so, Pharaoh. It was because at her own request I had led
the Queen Atyra to the ruined temple above her camp, that thence
she might look on the river by moonlight. This I did because
Pharaoh bade me to win the friendship of the queen and learn all
I could of her mind."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Ramose. And did you perchance learn anything else of
her&mdash; let us say, that her eyes were bright or her lips
soft?"</p>

<p>Now the blood came to my face while Amasis laughed in his
rough fashion, and even Pharaoh smiled a little as he went
on,</p>

<p>"Well, if you did, you will not tell me, so to ask is useless.
Listen. I know this&mdash;for when I sent you on that business, I
sent others to keep a watch on you&mdash;I say I know that this
lady found you to her taste, or made pretence to do so for her
own ends. Therefore I overlook your foolishness and purpose to
make use of you. Presently she will be at the palace. I appoint
you the officer in attendance on her with command to draw from
her all you can and report what you learn to me. For now that I
do not trust this woman who perchance is after all but a spy of
Babylon. Do you hear me?"</p>

<p>"I hear, Pharaoh," I answered bowing low to hide the doubt and
trouble in my eyes.</p>

<p>"Then understand this also: That I put a great trust upon you,
Ramose. Play the lover if you like, but remember that your first
duty is to play the spy. Above all, no more quarrels with Ninari
or any other. Do nothing foolish. Speak warm words, but let your
heart stay cold. Now opportunity is in your hand and if you fail
me, it will be for the last time; aye, your life may hang on
it."</p>

<p>"Spare me this task, Pharaoh," I muttered, "for it is one that
may prove too hard for me. Give it to another, an older man
like&mdash;like Belus."</p>

<p>Pharaoh looked at Belus who although not very old, already was
bald and withered like to an ancient papyrus that for centuries
has been buried in the sand. He was cold-eyed also and one who
shrank away from women as though they were smitten by a plague, a
man from whom wisdom and learning seemed to ooze, but whose
history, heart and ends were hidden; somewhat sinister withal,
save to the few he loved, perhaps from long acquaintance with
dark secrets whispered by spirits in the night. Yes, Pharaoh
looked at him and laughed.</p>

<p>"The learned Belus has his uses," he said, "as all know when
they are smitten in body or in soul, but I do not think that the
cozening of fair women is one of them. Each to his trade and
part. But, Ramose, beware lest you betray the one and overdo the
other. Take, but give nothing, and above everything be friends
with all, even with this Ninari if he lives, praying his pardon
and salving his hurt with gifts."</p>

<p>Then he waved his hand to dismiss me and once more fell into
talk with the General Amasis.</p>

<p>I prostrated myself and went, followed by Belus, my tutor,
who, when we had reached my quarters, sat himself down upon the
floor like a mourner and wiped his brow, saying,</p>

<p>"Unless you are wiser than I think, son Ramose, all is
finished and you are lost."</p>

<p>I stared at him in question and he went on,</p>

<p>"Do you not understand that Pharaoh has set you a terrible
task? You, the hungry bee, must hover over the open flower but
not taste its nectar; you, the dazzled moth, must wheel round the
flame but not scorch your wings. You, the young and ardent, must
play the part of the aged and the cold. Moreover, this he has
done of deep purpose, to try your quality and to learn whether
duty can conquer passion. I think that if you prevail in this
matter, he means to lift you high, even to the footsteps of the
throne. But if you fail, why then, farewell to you."</p>

<p>"I shall not fail," I answered wearily, "for my honour is on
it. Now let me rest a while. I have been hurt, I have gone
through much and for two nights I have had little sleep; also I
have fought for my life."</p>

<p>Then without more words I threw myself down upon my bed and
soon forgot all things, even Atyra.</p>

<p>When I awoke it was already late afternoon, so late that
scarcely was there time before night fell for me to visit the
chambers of the palace where the Queen Atyra and her servants
were to lodge, and give orders for their preparation, as now I
had authority to do. These chambers as it chanced, whether by
design or by accident, adjoined my own, for I dwelt in some small
rooms of that wing of the great palace that was used to house
Pharaoh's guests. Therefore I had not far to go, only the length
of a short passage indeed, and through a door of which I held the
key.</p>

<p>Until it was dark and next morning from the sunrise, aided by
chamberlains and other palace servants, I laboured at this making
ready. All was clean, all was garnished, everywhere flowers were
set. Beautiful curtains were hung up, vessels of gold and silver
fit for a queen's use were provided; the garden ground that lay
in the centre of this wing of the palace, having in it a little
lake filled with lotus flowers, was tended so that if she
pleased, the Queen Atyra might sit there beneath the shadow of
palms and flowering trees, the eunuchs were furnished with fresh
robes, and I know not what besides.</p>

<p>At length when all was prepared, I looked out from an upper
window and saw the cavalcade of the Syrians drawing near to the
palace. In its centre, preceded and followed by white-robed,
turbaned men mounted upon camels, was a splendid litter which
doubtless held the queen for it was surrounded by a guard of
horsemen. Also there were other litters for her women, while last
of all came one like that on which the sick are borne, whereof
the bearers stepped very carefully, that I guessed hid none other
than the priest Ninari, who to tell truth I hoped had gone to the
bosom of Osiris, or of whatever god he worshipped. Belus who was
by me, read as much in my eyes and shook his head, saying,</p>

<p>"Snakes are very hard to kill, my son, as I who have hunted
one for years, know as well as any man and better than most. Be
careful lest this one should live to bite you."</p>

<p>Then I hurried away to be arrayed in the festal robes of a
Count of Egypt and to put about my neck the gold chain that
marked my rank as the son of a king. Scarcely was I prepared when
a messenger summoned me to the great hall of audience. Thither I
went to find Pharaoh gloriously attired, wearing the double
crown, with the gold ear-rings and other ornaments of state, and
holding in his hand a sceptre. Round about him were the great
officers of the court, at his feet crouched scribes, while just
behind the fan-bearers stood his generals, some Egyptian and some
Greek, all clad in armour, amongst whom I noted Amasis.</p>

<p>I advanced, followed by Belus my tutor, and prostrated myself
before the throne. Pharaoh bade me rise and with his sceptre
pointed to where I should stand among, or rather a little in
front of, the nobles and king's sons, of whom there were several,
my half-brothers born of different ladies, though I was the
eldest of them. As I went, stepping backwards and bowing at each
step, Pharaoh turned and spoke to Amasis and I think his words
were that I was a young man of whom any king might be proud to be
the father.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Amasis in a hoarse whisper that reached me,
"yet it is pity that he is so like to one of those statues that
the Greeks of whom you are so fond, fashion of their gods. His
mother has too much share in him, Pharaoh. Look at his curly
head."</p>

<p>Then they both laughed and I nearly fell in my confusion.</p>

<p>At this moment trumpets blew, heralds cried aloud, and
preceded by officers with white wands, the Queen Atyra appeared
between the pillars at the end of the hall of audience. On her
head she wore a glittering crown, jewels shone upon her breast,
pearls were twisted in her looped and raven locks and round her
white wrists, while her silken train was borne by fair
waiting-women. Oh! seen thus, she was beautiful, so beautiful
that as I watched her tall, imperial shape glide up that hall
like a sunbeam through its shadows, my heart stood still and my
lips burned with the memory of her kiss. A little sigh of wonder
went up from the courtiers and through it I heard the jesting
Amasis whisper once more,</p>

<p>"I wish that you had given me Ramose's office, Pharaoh," to
which Apries answered,</p>

<p>"Nay, you are too rough, you would frighten this Syrian dove,
whereas he will stroke her feathers."</p>

<p>"Dove! Dove!" muttered Amasis.</p>

<p>Then Pharaoh lifted his sceptre and there was silence.</p>

<p>Atyra drew near in all her scented beauty, with bent head and
downcast eyes. Yet for one instant those dark eyes were lifted
and I felt rather than saw them flash a look upon me, saw also
the red lips tremble as though with a little smile. I think that
Belus saw also, for I heard a groan come from where he stood near
by in attendance on me. The queen mounted the royal dais and
curtseyed low, though prostrate herself she did not because she
was a majesty greeting a majesty. Pharaoh descended from his
throne and taking her hand, led her to a seat that was placed
near though slightly lower than this throne.</p>

<p>Then she spoke&mdash;in Greek which by now had become the
courtly language among many nations that did not know each
other's speech. An interpreter began to render her words, but
Apries, waving him aside, answered her in the same tongue which
he knew as well as he did his own, having learned it from my
mother and others. This caused many of the Egyptians round him to
frown, especially those that were old or wedded to ancient ways
which had come down to them through thousands of years, who hated
the Greeks with their new fashions, their language and all that
had to do with them. Indeed I noted that even Amasis frowned and
shrugged his shoulders and that the other Egyptian generals
looked on him with approval as he did so.</p>

<p>As for the talk between Atyra and Pharaoh, it need not be set
out. She made a formal prayer to him, reminding him of the
ancient friendship between the Syrians and Egypt that more than
once during the generations which had gone by, had been their
over-lord, yes, from the time of the great Thotmes onward, though
sometimes they had quarrelled "as a wife will, even with the
husband whom she loves." Now she, the widow of Abibal who had
been the head king of the Syrian peoples and who had died leaving
his mantle upon her shoulders, came to seek renewal of that
alliance, even though Syria must thus once more become the wife
of Egypt and serve as a wife serves.</p>

<p>Here Pharaoh asked shrewdly if this wife sought to shun the
arms of some other lover, whereon she answered with boldness,
"yes," that this was so and that the name of that lover was
Babylon, Egypt's ancient enemy and the one from whom she had most
to fear.</p>

<p>Now Pharaoh grew grave, saying that this was a very great
matter of which he must consider with himself and his
councillors, after private talk with her. Then dismissing all
such affairs of state, he asked her how it had fared with her
during her long journey, from which he hoped that she would rest
a while here in his palace at Sais, treating it as her own. She
answered that she desired nothing better, who all her life had
hoped to visit Egypt and acquaint herself with its wonders and
its wisdom.</p>

<p>So this prepared and balanced talk went on, reminding me of a
heavy weight swinging to and fro, and never going further or less
far, till at length Pharaoh bade her to a banquet that night.
Then, as though by an afterthought, he added,</p>

<p>"O Queen Atyra, the other day I sent Ramose, a young Count of
Egypt in whom runs no mean blood, to your camp to welcome you in
Egypt's name. I grieve to hear that while he was there a quarrel
arose between him and one of your followers, and for this I ask
your pardon."</p>

<p>"There is no need, Pharaoh," she answered smiling, "seeing
that in every quarrel there is something to be said on either
side."</p>

<p>"Then, Queen Atyra, if you can forgive him, would it please
you that while you are here I should appoint this Ramose who
stands yonder, to be your chamberlain to attend upon your wants
and bear your wishes to me? Or would you prefer that I should
choose some older man to fill this office?"</p>

<p>"I think that it would please me well," she answered
indifferently, "seeing that I found the Count Ramose a pleasant
companion and one with whom I could talk in Greek; also one who
can instruct me in the customs and history of Egypt and in its
tongue, all of which I desire to learn. Yet let it be as the
Pharaoh wills. Whoever Pharaoh chooses will be welcome to
me."</p>

<p>So saying, she turned her head to speak to one of her servants
in her own language, as though the matter troubled her not at
all.</p>

<p>"Count Ramose," said Pharaoh, addressing me, "for the days of
her stay at our court we give this royal lady into your keeping.
Let it be your duty to wait upon her and to attend to her every
want, making report to us from time to time of how she fares.
Know, Ramose, that we shall hold you to strict account for her
safety and her welfare and that if aught of ill befalls her while
she is in your keeping, you shall make answer for it to us."</p>

<p>Thus in formal, stately words was the lady Atyra set in my
charge. I heard and bowed, while the other courtiers looked on me
with envy, for this was a great duty and one that should bring
with it advancement and rewards. Yet it is true that as I bowed
my heart, which should have leapt for joy, seemed to sink and
fail so that I could scarcely feel it beat. It was as though some
icy hand of fear had gripped it by the roots. A great terror took
hold of me, a shadow of woe to come fell upon me. Almost I
determined to prostrate myself and pray Pharaoh to confer this
honour on some other man, one with more knowledge and older. I
even turned to advance to the steps of the throne and do so,
although I knew that such a prayer would cause me to be mocked by
all the court. It was too late, Pharaoh had risen; his decree was
written on the rolls, the audience was at an end.</p>

<p>Now I will press on with the terrible story of Atyra which was
to turn the current of my life and for aught I know, robbed me of
the throne of Egypt. At least so Belus held, as did some others,
though if so, that is a loss over which I do not grieve.</p>

<p>For a while all went well. I waited on the queen; with her
officers I was her companion at her table; I instructed her as
best I might in all she wished to learn, for to me alone she
would listen and not to Belus or another. When she visited
Pharaoh and his councillors I accompanied her, standing back so
that I might not overhear their secrets. In short I did all those
things I had been instructed to do, even to make report of
everything I learned from the queen as I had been bidden.</p>

<p>One day she turned on me laughing and said,</p>

<p>"I thought you were my friend, Ramose, but I find that you are
nothing but a spy who repeats to Pharaoh all I say. I know it
because he used to me some of my very words, thinking that they
were his own, which words could only have come to him through
you."</p>

<p>Now I turned aside and hung my head, whereon she leant over
me, whispering,</p>

<p>"Foolish boy, do not think I am angry with you, who know well
that you must do your duty and therefore tell you nothing that
you may not cry out from every pylon top. These matters of policy
are between me and Pharaoh, or rather between Syria and Egypt. I
and you have others to discuss that Pharaoh would think dull. Now
tell me of your boyhood and of the woman that you first thought
fair."</p>

<p>So it went on and ever as I drew back, so she came forward. At
first I think that she was puzzled who could not understand why I
resisted her and made search to find some other woman who had
built a wall between us. Soon she discovered that there was none;
indeed she drew this out of me. At last in a flash she guessed
the truth&mdash;that I was under an oath, to my own heart or
another, which, mattered not, to treat her as a queen who was
Egypt's guest, and no more.</p>

<p>Then Atyra did what she should not have done, as doubtless she
knows to-day. She set herself to make me break that oath. For
nothing else do I blame her who, I know, loved me truly, boy
though I was. But for this, how can she escape from blame? She
knew that her witchery was on me, she knew that she had made me
mad&mdash;indeed in those days of resistance I went near to
madness, I who worshipped her as a thing divine, and yet she put
out all her woman's strength to break my will and cause me to
forswear myself.</p>

<p>At last the matter came to a head, as such do always. The
feast was over, the guests had departed, I presented myself, as I
must, to take my farewell of her for the night, and found that I
was alone with her in the little ante-chamber where a single lamp
burned dimly. She was standing at a window-place cut in the
thickness of the wall, watching the rising of the moon, a figure
clad all in white, but for some scarlet pomegranate blooms
fastened upon her breast, for her maids had relieved her of her
royal ornaments, save a girdle of gold about her waist.</p>

<p>Discovering her at length I advanced to inquire her commands
for the morrow, bow and be gone.</p>

<p>"How quietly you walk, Ramose," she said. "I heard you not,
yet I knew that you were coming. Yes, I felt your presence, as we
do that of those whom we love&mdash;or hate. My orders? Oh! I
have none to give you at the moment, young chamberlain. Why think
of the morrow on such a night as this. Look at that great moon
rising yonder out of the desert. No wonder that you Egyptians set
your Isis in the moon, for it is a lovely throne fit for any
goddess. Now of what does this one put me in mind? Ah! I
remember&mdash;of that which rose over the waters of the Nile
when you and I sat together in a ruined temple of the desert. Do
you not remember it?"</p>

<p>I muttered some answer, I know not what it was, and half-turned
to go, when with a swift and sudden motion she flung
herself against me. Yes, from her foot to her shoulder I felt all
the weight of her beautiful body leaning against me.</p>

<p>I never stirred, I did nothing, and yet I know not how,
presently her lips were on my own.</p>

<p>She drew away, laughing low and happily, and asked,</p>

<p>"Now, Ramose, do you remember that night in the ruined temple
when we looked together at the moon rising over the Nile?"</p>

<p>I fled away, and as I fled, still she laughed.</p>

<p>It was after this that for the first time I saw the priest
Ninari among the other servitors of the queen, recovered of his
wounds but wearing a cap with lappets that hung down over his
ears. He greeted me courteously enough, but in his eyes was a
fierce look that I could not misunderstand.</p>

<p>"We quarrelled once, young lord," he said, "but now that you
are the appointed guardian of my queen, we are friends, are we
not?"</p>

<p>"Surely," I answered.</p>

<p>"Then all is well between us, young lord, while you guard her
faithfully, who otherwise may quarrel once more and with a
different ending." And again he smiled upon me with those fierce
eyes and was gone.</p>

<p>On the evening of my meeting with Ninari, I was in waiting on
Queen Atyra in the garden of which I have written, and noted that
she was troubled. Presently she led me to a seat beneath the
palms in front of which lay the little pool where flowered the
blue lotus lilies. It was a pleasant, secluded seat hidden from
the rest of the garden and from the palace windows by a bank of
flowering shrubs and of tall reed-like plants with feathery
heads.</p>

<p>"What ails you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Everything, Ramose," she answered. "All goes awry and I would
that I were dead. My mission to Pharaoh is ended, and not so ill.
To-morrow at the dawn the Egyptian general Amasis, with a great
force most of which has gone on before, advances to attack the
Babylonians on the borders of Egypt. To-morrow also I leave Sais
to journey back to my own country. It was decided but an hour
ago. Do you understand that I leave Sais?"</p>

<p>"I understand, Queen, though this sudden plan amazes me. Why
do you go so swiftly?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you. Ninari has been with Pharaoh and has told
him that news has come from my country that those who are left in
power there, urged on by the people who are afraid, threaten to
make peace with Babylon, and that one of the terms of that peace
will be that we Syrians should join the Babylonians in the attack
on Egypt. He has told him also that there is but one hope of
defeating this treachery, namely, that I should return at once
bearing Pharaoh's offers of alliance, and as the wife of Ninari
who alone can control the priesthood, which is the real power in
the land, and overthrow this plot."</p>

<p>"As the wife of Ninari," I gasped. "May the gods avert
it!"</p>

<p>"The gods make no sign, Ramose. If there be any gods, these
ask of men that they should carve their own fate upon the cliffs
of Time. In this matter Ninari is the god."</p>

<p>For a little while we sat silent staring at the lotus blooms.
Then she spoke again.</p>

<p>"Do you love me, Ramose?"</p>

<p>"You know that I love you," I answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, yet your love is to my love but as a dewdrop to the
waters in that lake. Ramose, a madness has taken hold of me. I
will tell you the truth. You are very young and as yet of small
account in the world, while I am a queen who perchance will
become the sovereign of a great country, if with Egypt's help we
can overthrow Babylon, as may happen now that Nebuchadnezzar
grows old and feeble and there is none to take his place. Still I
say to you that you, the son of Pharaoh's woman, are more to me
than all earth's thrones and glory. Here fate thrusts me on, not
folly or passion, but fate itself with an iron hand. I will have
none of Ninari. Rather than that accursed priestly hound should
creep into my chamber, I will die, or better still, he shall die
who knows not with whom he has to deal. Yes, here and now I
pronounce his doom."</p>

<p>Thus she spoke in slow, cold words that yet were full of
fearful menace, then suddenly went on in a soft, changed
voice.</p>

<p>"Let us talk no more of this foul Ninari. Hearken! If you will
play the man I have plans that shall make of you a great king and
give to you one of earth's fairest and most loving women as a
wife. But I, who perhaps have said too much already, dare not
speak them here. Always I am watched, the very air seems to play
the spy upon me, and even now I feel&mdash;" and she shivered.
"Moreover my women wait to tire me for Pharaoh's farewell feast
and I must be gone. Ramose, you have the key of the door that
leads to my chambers. In the first of them I sleep quite alone,
for I will have no one near me in my slumbers and the guards and
eunuchs are set far away beyond. Come to me at midnight and I
will tell you all. Will you come, knowing that if aught
miscarries, your life hangs in it?"</p>

<p>"My life," I answered sadly. "What is my life? Something of
which I think I should be well rid could I say good-bye to it
with honour. I have not been happy of late, Queen Atyra. Pharaoh
laid a charge upon me and, forgive me for saying it, it seems
that always you have put out your strength to cause me to break
my trust. By Amen I have fought my best, but alas! I am weak with
love of you. When your eyes shine upon me I grow dizzy and at
your touch my purpose melts like wax in the midday sun. What you
command, that I must do and if death waits at the end of your
road, may Thoth, the Weigher of hearts, be merciful and give me
sleep that I may forget my shame."</p>

<p>She looked at me and there was pity in her eyes. Then the pity
passed and they burned with the light of passion.</p>

<p>"I grieve for you as I grieve for myself, whose danger is
greater than your own," she said. "Yet for me the choice lies
between you and madness. Know, Ramose, that without you I shall
go mad, and ere I die work woes at which the world will shudder.
Think! is such a love as mine a gift to be lightly cast
away?"</p>

<p>"I will come, I have said it," I answered.</p>

<p>Then she rose and went.</p>

<p>Pharaoh's feast that night was very glorious and at it none
was merrier than the Queen Atyra. Indeed she was so beautiful in
her royal apparel that she drew all eyes to her and every man
bent forward to watch her and hear her words, yes, even Pharaoh's
self. Yet to me it seemed a feast of death and even the scented
cup I bore to her wherein she pledged her country's future
fellowship with Egypt, smelt of the tomb.</p>

<p>At length it was over. The dancers ended their dancing, the
music faded away. The lovely queen bent before Pharaoh and he
kissed her hand. She departed with her company. The lamps died
out.</p>

<p>It was midnight. I unlocked the passage door; I crept to her
chamber like a thief, for now all my doubts were gone and I was
aflame. Its door was ajar. I entered, closing it behind me. In
the chamber burned a hanging lamp of which the flame wavered in
the hot night-wind that came through the open window-place.
There upon a couch she lay clothed all in white, a thing of
beauty, her black locks flowing about her. I went to her, I knelt
down to kiss her lips, but she did not stir, she said nothing. I
touched her brow and lo! although her shape stayed still, her
head rolled towards me.</p>

<p>Then I saw that her neck was severed through and through. She
was dead!</p>

<p>I rose from my knees, smitten with a silent madness. From
behind a curtain appeared Ninari, a red sword in his hand.</p>

<p>"Young Count of Egypt," he said in a soft voice, "know that I
heard all your talk with this traitress, for I was hidden in the
bushes behind you in the garden. Now, that our queen might not be
shamed, I have executed the decree of my god upon her, and go to
make report of what has been done to the people over who she
ruled. I bid you farewell, Count Ramose, trusting that you who
are young and were sorely tempted, will have learned a lesson
which cannot be forgotten."</p>

<p>My strength came back to me. I said no word. I sprang at him
as a lion springs. He struck; I caught his arm with such a grip
that the sword fell from his hand. I closed with him and in the
might of my madness I broke him like a stick. At least suddenly
he sank together in my hands and his head fell backwards.</p>

<p>Then I hurled him through the window-place. I took his sword
and set its hilt upon the pavement, purposing to fall upon it.
Already I bent over its point when it was struck away. I looked
up. There by me, white, wide-eyed, stood Belus.</p>

<p>"Come!" he said hoarsely, "come swiftly, for your life's
sake!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap5"></a>CHAPTER 5<br>

THE FLIGHT TO AMASIS</h2>

<p class="first">
IN the doorway of the chamber I glanced back. By the wavering
light of the lamp I saw the white shape of her who had been the
Queen Atyra and my love, lying still and dreadful on the couch,
her head turned strangely as though to watch me go. On the floor
from beneath a rug and a splendid garment which she had worn at
the feast, crept the red stream that told of murder, and near by
it lay the sword of Ninari. Some jewels glittered upon a stool
and among them was a flower, one which that afternoon I had given
to her&mdash;yes, she had taken it from my hand, kissed it and
set it in her girdle. The moon shone through the open window-place
out of which I had hurled Ninari. Such was the picture, a
terrible picture that in every detail must haunt me till I
die.</p>

<p>I wished to turn back to recover that flower, but Belus thrust
me before him and closed the door. We passed down the passage to
my apartment. This door also Belus closed and locked. We stood
face to face in my chamber.</p>

<p>"What now?" I said drearily. "Give me one of those drugs of
yours, Belus, that which kills so swiftly, for all is done."</p>

<p>"Nay," he answered, "all is but begun. Be a man and hearken.
The woman is dead; by her lies the sword of Ninari. Who save I
knows that you entered her chamber? Ninari is dead also; he lies
broken at the foot of the palace wall for I saw you cast him from
the window-place whence it will be believed he flung himself
after doing murder, since he is untouched by knife or sword."</p>

<p>"I know, Belus, <i>I</i> know; and my face will tell the tale
or I shall go mad and babble it."</p>

<p>He nodded his wise head.</p>

<p>"Perchance, Ramose. At least Pharaoh will kill you because she
was in your charge. Or, if he does not, those Syrians will,
guessing the truth. By this hand or by that, death awaits you
here, sure death, and with it shame."</p>

<p>"I seek to die," I answered.</p>

<p>"You cannot, for it is written otherwise. Have I not read it
in your stars? Listen. The General Amasis has departed to join
the army that goes to fight the Babylonians on the frontiers of
Egypt. Pharaoh does not trust this Amasis whom the soldiers love
too well. He sends me to be his counsellor and to spy upon him,
and I depart within an hour for the command is urgent. Disguised
as my scribe you will accompany me. Forseeing trouble already I
have ordered all. To-morrow you will be missed and perhaps it may
be thought that some ill has befallen you. Do not young men
wander out at night and meet with adventures that have been known
to end evilly? Has not the Nile borne the bodies of many such
towards the sea? Or may not the Syrians have murdered you, as
they murdered the queen who was known to look on you so kindly?
At best there will be much talk and Pharaoh will be wrath, but as
you have vanished away the matter will be forgotten. If
afterwards it is learned that, seeking adventure, you went to
join Amasis, you may be forgiven&mdash;that is unless those
Syrians know all and plotted this murder. Answer not, but come,
bringing your sword and what gold you have."</p>

<p>A while later, it may have been one hour, or two, I forget,
whose memory of that night is dimmed by a fog of wretchedness,
two figures might have been seen leaving that part of the palace
which was called Dream House because there always dwelt the royal
astrologer. They left it by a small gate guarded by a single
soldier who challenged them. Belus gave some password; also he
showed a ring and spoke in the guard's ear.</p>

<p>"Right enough. All in order," said the man. "Belus the
Babylonian and a scribe we were commanded to pass. Well, here is
Belus the Babylonian whom we all know, for he tells our fortunes
by the stars, and there's the scribe in a dark cloak with a hood
to it. A very fine young man, too, for a scribe who generally are
short and round-stomached, or sometimes, quite small and very
like a girl, for many are named scribes who never served
apprenticeship in a temple or a school. Magician Belus, I fear
that I cannot let this scribe pass until I have called the
officer to have a look at him&mdash;or her."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, man?" asked Belus coldly. "Is not Pharaoh's
ring enough?"</p>

<p>"Not to-night, Master. Although you may not have heard it,
there is trouble yonder in the palace. Something terrible has
happened there. Some great one has been murdered. Who it is I
know not. Still word has come that all gateways are to be watched
and none allowed to pass whose faces are covered or who are not
known, even under Pharaoh's seal. Therefore I pray you stay a
minute until the officer and his guard pass upon their
round."</p>

<p>"As you will," said Belus, "and while we wait, friend, tell
me, how is that little daughter of yours whom I visited two days
ago in her fever?"</p>

<p>"Master," answered the man in another voice, a trembling
voice, "she hangs between life and death. When I left to come on
guard at length she had fallen asleep and the wise women said
that either it is the beginning of the sleep of death or she will
wake free of the fever and recover. Tell me, Master, you who are
wise and can read the stars, which she will do. For know, I love
this child, my only one, and my heart is racked."</p>

<p>With the staff he bore Belus made a drawing in the sand. Then
he looked up at certain stars and added dots to the drawing,
which done, he said,</p>

<p>"Events are strangely linked with one another in this world,
my friend, nor can we understand who or what it is that ties them
thus together. Who for instance would have dreamed that your
daughter's fate hangs upon whether I and this scribe of mine,
whom perchance you guessed rightly to be a woman, though a tall
one such as are loved by small men like myself, pass at once upon
our business, or wait until it pleases some officer to wander
this way upon his rounds. If we pass, the stars say that your
daughter will live; if we wait, while we are waiting she will
die&mdash;yes, before the moonlight creeps to that mark, she will
die. But if my departing footstep stamps upon it, she will
live."</p>

<p>"Pass, Magician Belus, with the girl disguised as a scribe,"
said the man, "for such I see now she is, though at first the
moonlight deceived me. Pass."</p>

<p>"Good night, friend," said Belus, "the blessing of the gods be
upon you, and upon that daughter of yours who will live to
comfort your old age."</p>

<p>Then with his foot he stamped out the pattern on the sand and
we went on.</p>

<p>"Will the child live?" I asked idly, for this sight of the
grief of another seemed to dull my own.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Belus. "My medicines have worked well and that
sleep is a presage of her recovery. Surely she will live, but
what will happen to her father when it is learned that he has
suffered some veiled traveller to pass out, I do not know."</p>

<p>"Perchance he will keep silence upon that matter."</p>

<p>"Aye, but when the light comes our footprints on the sand will
tell their own tale, that is, unless a wind rises. Still by that
time we shall be far away. Run, Scribe, run. The horses and the
escort, men who are sworn to me, await us in yonder grove."</p>

<p>Eight days later we came to the camp of Amasis upon the
borders of Egypt. An officer led us to the tent of Amasis whom we
found in jovial mood, for he had dined and drunk well, as was his
custom.</p>

<p>"Greeting, learned Belus," said Amasis. "Now tell me on what
business Pharaoh sends you?"</p>

<p>Belus drew out a roll, laid it to his forehead and handed it
to Amasis, saying,</p>

<p>"It is written here, General."</p>

<p>He undid the roll, glanced at it and cast it down.</p>

<p>"It is written in Greek," he exclaimed, "and I, an Egyptian,
will not read Greek. Repeat its contents. Nay, it is needless,
for I have heard them already by another messenger who has
outstripped you, one of my own captains whom Pharaoh did not
send. The writing orders that I must make report daily, or as
often as may be, of all that passes in this army, through you,
Belus the Babylonian. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Belus calmly, "that is the sum of it."</p>

<p>"Which means," went on Amasis, "that you are sent here to spy
upon me and all that I do."</p>

<p>"Yes, General," replied Belus in the same quiet voice.
"Pharaoh, as you know, is jealous and fears you."</p>

<p>"Why, Belus?"</p>

<p>"Because the Egyptians love you, especially the soldiers, and
do not love Pharaoh who they think, favours the Greeks too much,
and in all but blood is himself a Greek."</p>

<p>"That I know. Is there no other reason?"</p>

<p>"Yes, General. As you may have heard, like other Babylonians I
have some skill in divination and in the casting of horoscopes.
Pharaoh caused me to cast his, and yours also, General."</p>

<p>"And what did they say, Belus?" asked Amasis leaning
forward.</p>

<p>Belus dropped his voice and answered,</p>

<p>"They said that the star of Apries wanes, while that of Amasis
grows bright. They said that ere long where shone the star of
Apries, will shine the star of Amasis alone, though first for a
time those two stars will ride in the heavens side by side. That
is what they said though I told Apries another tale."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the throne?" asked Amasis in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Aye, the throne and a certain general wearing Pharaoh's
crown."</p>

<p>For a while there was silence, then Amasis asked,</p>

<p>"Does Pharaoh send you to poison me, as doubtless you can do,
you strange and fateful Belus, who like a night-bird, have
flitted from Babylon to Egypt for your own dark and secret
purpose?"</p>

<p>"Nay, and if he did, I, their servant, am not one to fight
against the stars. Fear nothing from me who am your friend,
though there are others whom you will do well to watch. Now,
General, here in this camp I am in your power. You can kill me if
you will, but that would be foolish, for I have not told you all
the horoscope."</p>

<p>"Your meaning?"</p>

<p>"It is that if you kill me, as I think you had it in your mind
to do but now, me or another, that star of yours will never shine
alone, because my blood will call for yours. Am I safe with you
and if I need it, will you protect me when you grow great?"</p>

<p>"You are safe and I will protect you now and always. I swear
it by Amen and by Maat, Goddess of Truth. Yet, why do you turn
from Pharaoh who has sheltered you ever since you escaped from
Babylon?&mdash;for I have heard that you did escape on account of
some crime."</p>

<p>"Because Pharaoh turns from me and presently will seek my
life; indeed I think that he seeks it already. For the rest, the
crime of which you have heard was not mine, but that of
another&mdash;upon whom I wait to be avenged in some far-off
appointed hour," he added and as he spoke the words, his face
grew fierce and even terrible.</p>

<p>"Be plain, Belus, but tell me first, who is this with you who
listens to our most secret thoughts? How comes it that I never
noted him?"</p>

<p>"Perchance because I willed that you should not, General, or
perchance because wine dims the eyes. But look on him, and answer
your own question."</p>

<p>As he spoke, very swiftly Belus bent forward and unclasped the
long cloak which I wore, revealing me clad as a soldier with an
armoured cap upon my head. Amasis stared at me.</p>

<p>"By the gods!" he said, "this is none other than Ramose,
Pharaoh's bastard and my pupil in arms whom I love well. Now what
does this young cock here? Is he another of Pharaoh's spies whom
you have brought to be your witness?"</p>

<p>"A poor spy, I think, General. Nay, like me he flies from
Pharaoh's wrath. There has been trouble in the palace. A certain
Syrian queen whom you will remember, for in truth she sent you
here, has come to her end&mdash;a swift and bloody end&mdash;as
has her minister."</p>

<p>"I have heard as much, for rumour of the death of great ones
flies more swiftly than a dove, but what has that to do with
Ramose? Did he perchance stifle her with kisses, as I would have
done at his age?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing at all, General. But Ramose was her guardian
and chamberlain, and Pharaoh demands his life in payment for
hers, so do her Syrians, or will ere long. Therefore he seeks
refuge under the shield of Amasis, his captain."</p>

<p>"And shall have it, by the gods. Am I a man to give up one who
has served under me, over the matter of a woman, even to
Pharaoh's self? Not so, and yet I must remember that this
youngster is Pharaoh's son and half a Greek and has heard words
that would set a noose about my neck. Do you vouch for him,
Belus?"</p>

<p>"Aye, Amasis. Listen. From boyhood this lad has been as one
born to me and I, who now am&mdash;childless&mdash;love him. He
has been drawn into trouble, and thereby, as I fear, embroiled
Syria and Egypt. Therefore his life is forfeit, as is mine who
have befriended him and aided his escape. Therefore, too, both of
us have fled to you, and henceforward swear ourselves to your
service, looking to you to shield us. Tell us, may we sleep in
peace, or must we seek it elsewhere?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you may sleep easy, even from Pharaoh, for here in this
camp I am Pharaoh," answered Amasis proudly. "Have I not sworn it
already and am I a troth-breaker?" he added.</p>

<p>Scarce had the words passed his lips when from without came a
sound of sentries challenging, followed by a cry of "Pass on,
Messenger of Pharaoh." The tent opened and there appeared a
travel-stained man clad in Pharaoh's uniform, who bowed, handed a
roll to Amasis and at a sign, retired.</p>

<p>"Pharaoh sends me many letters," he said, as he cut the silk
and undid the roll. Then he read, looked up and laughed.</p>

<p>"Your guardian spirit must be good, Belus. At least you two
were wise to take that oath of me upon the instant. Hearken to
what is written here," and he read aloud,</p>

<p class="letter">"Pharaoh to the General Amasis,<br> "The
Syrians who came hither with the Queen Atyra who is dead, as the
price of the friendship of their nation to Egypt, demand the life
of the Count Ramose who was her chamberlain, because he failed in
his duty and did not keep her safe; also because as they allege
he murdered one Ninari. If he has fled to your camp disguised as
a scribe, as is reported, put him to death and send his head to
Sais that it may be shown to them. With it send Belus the
Babylonian, that the truth of all this matter may be wrung from
him.<br> "Sealed with the seals of Pharaoh and his Vizier."</p>

<p>"Now, Belus," went on Amasis, "tell me, you who are wise in
counsel, what shall I do? Obey Pharaoh or my oath?"</p>

<p>I listened like to one in a dream, but Belus answered
quietly,</p>

<p>"Which you will, Amasis. Obey Pharaoh, cause this lad to be
murdered and send me to the torturers at Sais, and see your star
set&mdash;as I promised you. Obey your oath, and see that star
shine out above all storms, royally and alone. Yet, is it needful
to urge Amasis to honesty by revealing what Thoth has written
concerning him in the Book of Fate?"</p>

<p>"I think not," answered Amasis with his great laugh. "Do they
not say of me in Egypt that never yet did I break troth with
friend or foe, and shall I do so now? Young man, I see that you
have scribe's tools about you; therefore be seated and write
these words:</p>

<p class="letter">"From Amasis the General, to Pharaoh,<br> "The
letter of Pharaoh has been received. Know, O divine Pharaoh, that
it is not the custom of Amasis to kill those who are serving
under him in war, save for cowardice or other military offence.
If the Syrians have aught against the Count Ramose, let them come
hither and set out their case before me and my captains. For the
rest, Belus the Babylonian, whom the good god Pharaoh sent hither
to watch me, is too weary to travel. Moreover, I keep him at my
side that I may watch him."</p>

<p>When I had finished writing, Amasis read the roll, sealed it
and summoning an officer, bade him to give it to the messenger to
be delivered to Pharaoh at Sais. When the officer had gone he
thought a while, and said in his open fashion,</p>

<p>"The quarrel between me and Pharaoh or rather between the
Egyptians and his friends the Greeks, has long been brewing. It
is strange that it should have boiled over upon the little matter
of this young Count and his love affairs, yet doubtless so it was
decreed. Have no fear, Ramose, Pharaoh is cowardly for otherwise
he would not seek the life of his own son for such a trifle from
dread born of Syrian threats; a tyrant also and when tyrants are
taken by the beard, they grow afraid. Yet my counsel to both of
you is, to keep out of the reach of Pharaoh's arm till this
business is forgotten. If ever he speaks of it to me again, I
will tell him to his face that he should thank me who have saved
him from the crime of murdering his son, whose blood would have
brought the curse of the gods upon him. Now drink a cup of wine,
both of you, and let me hear this tale of the death of Atyra, if
she be dead in truth."</p>

<p>So I told it to him, keeping nothing back. When it was done,
he said,</p>

<p>"I am glad that you threw that Syrian rat through the
window-place, sending him to settle his account with Atyra in the
underworld. Grieve not, young man. There are more women left upon
the earth who will teach you to forget your trouble, and for the
rest this ill-fated lady was one hard to be resisted. Now, go
rest. To-morrow I will find you a place in my bodyguard and we
shall see whether you are luckier in war than you have been in
love."</p>

<p>Thus he spoke though in the after years, when he had ceased to
be a bluff general and had become a wily Pharaoh steeped in
statecraft, he forgot, or pretended to forget all this story and
asserted that Atyra had borne me a child before her death. But of
this in its season.</p>

<p>That night ere I slept, for the first time I opened all my
heart to Belus, showing him how great was its bitterness and woe.
Moreover I told him that if I escaped the wrath of Pharaoh and
the accidents of war, I had sworn an oath before the gods to have
no more to do with women.</p>

<p>"I rejoice to hear it, Son," answered Belus, with his strange
wise smile, "and I pray that the memory of the gods of Egypt is
not too long. You say that you have done with women, but mayhap
women have not done with such a man as you, nor because one has
brought you sorrow, is it certain that another may not bring you
joy. Now grieve no more over what cannot be mended nor for her
who is dead because of you, but follow after Fortune with a brave
heart, for such she loves. Only one thing I hope of you, that you
will suffer me, your master, to stay at your side through bad
weather and through good, until perhaps I am drawn away to fulfil
the purpose of my life."</p>

<p>Then without telling me what was that purpose, he kissed me on
the brow and I laid me down and slept.</p>

<h2><a id="chap6"></a>CHAPTER 6<br>

THE GIFT OF GOD</h2>

<p class="first">
NEXT day the march began. I saw and knew all, for Amasis, a
man of his word in those days, appointed me to be an officer of
his guard, also, because I was a scholar, one of his private
scribes. Further he kept Belus in attendance on him, so that
between us we learned all there was to know. Thus I came to
understand how great was the power of Amasis, the beloved of the
soldiers.</p>

<p>About him was none of the ceremonial of Pharaoh's court. His
captains were his fellows; also he drank, jested and bandied
stories, some of them coarse enough, with the common soldiers
round their fires. A man of the people himself, he talked to them
of their fathers, yes, and mothers too. He asked no great
reverence from them, nor that any man should bow to the dust when
he passed by and to many a fault he was blind. If one off duty
drank too much, or broke camp to seek some girl who had looked at
him kindly, he said nothing; but if such a one did these things
when he was on duty, then let him beware, for he would be
flogged, or even hanged. No man was promoted for lip-service or
because his birth was high, but to those who were brave and loyal
every door was open. Therefore the army loved him, so much indeed
that he dared to defy Pharaoh in such a letter as he had written
concerning Belus and myself, and yet fear nothing.</p>

<p>Some thirty or forty thousand strong not counting the
camp-followers, we marched against the Babylonians, a great host
of them under the command of Merodach, said to be a son of
Nebuchadnezzar, who awaited us beyond the borders of Egypt. Or
rather they did not await us for as we came on, they retreated.
Then we discovered that we were being led into a trap, for
Syrians by the ten thousand, were hanging on our flank waiting to
cut us off. Belus learned this from spies whom we had taken, but
who, it seemed, belonged to some secret brotherhood of which he
was a chief.</p>

<p>For although Belus was willing to fight against his own
people, I found that among them he still had many friends. This
at the time I could not understand, for not until many years had
gone by did I come to know that the Babylonians were divided
among themselves, numbers of them hating the kings who ruled over
them and all their cruelties and wars.</p>

<p>So Amasis separated his army. Half of it he left entrenched
upon a range of little hills that encircled an oasis where there
was water in plenty, beyond which hills the Babylonians had
retreated, thinking to draw us into the desert on their further
side. The rest, among whom were nearly all the horsemen and
chariots, he sent to swoop down on the Syrians. Making a long
night march we caught them at the dawn just as they were breaking
camp. Until we fell upon them they did not know that we were
near. Therefore, although they outnumbered us by three to one,
our victory was great. Hemming them round in the gloom, we
attacked at daybreak and slew thousands of them before they could
form their ranks. Also we made prisoners of thousands more and
took a great booty of horses and camels.</p>

<p>This done we returned to the low hills in a fortunate moment,
for discovering that the half of our army was gone, at length the
Babylonians had determined to attack. Night was falling when we
reached the camp and therefore they did not see us advancing
under cover of the hills. Some of us, I among them, pushed on and
made report to Amasis of how it had gone between us and the
Syrians, a tale that pleased him greatly. Moreover, having heard
me well spoken of by those under whom I served for the part I
played in that fray, he promoted me to be captain of a company of
which the officer had been killed by an arrow. This company was
part of what was called the General's Legion, appointed to
surround him in battle and to fight under his own command. I knew
it already, since from it was drawn his bodyguard, of whom I had
been one until I was sent out against the Syrians.</p>

<p>Next morning at the dawn from the crest of our hills, far away
upon the plain and half hidden by clouds of dust, we saw the
Babylonians approaching, a mighty host of them. Indeed so
countless were they and so vast was their array, that at sight of
it my heart sank for it seemed as though for every man of ours
they could count ten. While I stood staring at them, suddenly I
found Amasis himself at my side wrapped in a common soldier's
cloak.</p>

<p>"You are afraid, young man," he said. "Your face shows it.
Well, I think none the worse of you for that. Yet take courage,
since it is not numbers that make an army terrible, but
discipline and the will to conquer. Look now at this great host.
As its standards show, it is made up of many peoples all mixed
together. See, it keeps no good line, for its left wing is far
advanced and its right straggles. Also its centre, where is
Merodach, the king's son, with his chosen guards, is cumbered
with many waggons and litters. In those waggons are not food or
water, but women, for these soft Babylonians soaked in luxury,
will not move without their women even in war, and they must be
protected. Therefore I say to you, and to all, be not
afraid."</p>

<p>Then he departed to talk to others.</p>

<p>All that morning the Babylonian multitude came on slowly, till
by noon they were within a mile of us. During the heat of the day
they rested for some two hours or more, then once more they
advanced, as we thought to the attack. But it was not so, for
when they had covered another three furlongs again they halted as
though bewildered, perhaps because they could see so few of us,
for the most of our army was hidden behind the crest of a hill.
At length officers rode forward, five or six of them, carrying a
white flag, and reined up almost at the foot of the hills.</p>

<p>Amasis sent some forward to speak with them, among whom was
Belus whose tongue was their own, disguised as an Egyptian
captain, a garb that became him ill. They talked a long while.
Then Belus and the others returned and reported that the Prince
and General, Merodach, gave us leave to retire unmolested, also
that he offered a great present of gold to Amasis and his
captains, if this were done. Then, he said, he would retire to
Babylon and make it known to the King Nebuchadnezzar that he had
gained a victory over the Egyptians, who had fled at the sight of
his army.</p>

<p>When Amasis heard this, he laughed. Nevertheless he sent back
Belus and the others to ask how much gold Babylon would pay as a
tribute to Pharaoh, and so it went on all the afternoon, till at
length Amasis knew that it was too late for the Babylonians to
attack, for night drew near. Then he sent a last message,
demanding that the Babylonians should surrender and give
hostages; also the gold that they had offered. This was the end
of it.</p>

<p>Later Belus came and told me the meaning of this play. "Those
Babylonians have no water," he said, "save what they carry with
them. To-morrow they will be thirsty and drink all, leaving
nothing for the horses and the elephants, that they thought would
drink at the springs of the oasis to-night. Truly Amasis is a
good general."</p>

<p>All that night we watched, thought with little fear for there
was no moon and we knew that in such darkness the Babylonians
would not dare to attack. Now I thought that Amasis would fall on
them at the dawn, as we had done on the Syrians. But he did not,
who said that thirst was the greatest of captains and he would
leave him in command. Still when he had seen that all our army
was well fed and all our horses were well watered, he sent out a
body of cavalry, five thousand of them perhaps, with orders to
charge at the centre of the Babylonians as they began to muster
their array, and then suddenly to retire as though seized with
panic.</p>

<p>This was done. When they saw the horsemen coming the
Babylonians formed up with great shoutings, and the elephants
were advanced. As if frightened at the sight of these elephants,
our men wheeled about and fled back towards the hills, though not
too fast. Now happened that which Amasis had hoped.</p>

<p>The enemy broke his ranks and pursued the Egyptians.
Elephants, chariots and clouds of horse pursued them all mingled
together, while after them came the bulk of the host. The word
went down our lines to stand firm behind the crest of the hill.
We opened and let our horsemen through, to re-form behind us,
which they did, having scarce lost a man. Then we closed again
and waited.</p>

<p>The hordes were upon us; chariots, horse and elephants toiled
up the sandy slopes of the hills, slipping back one step for
every two forward. At a signal our bowmen rose and loosed their
arrows, cloud after cloud of arrows. Soon the heads and trunks of
the elephants were full of them. Maddened with pain the great
brutes turned and rushed down the hill, crushing all they met.
The horses also, those of them that were not killed, did
likewise, while the sand was strewn with dead or wounded men. The
charge turned to a rout and few that took part in it reached the
great army unharmed. Still, so vast was it that those who had
fallen with their beasts were but a tithe of its numbers, though
now few of the elephants were fit for service and the chariots
and the horsemen had suffered much.</p>

<p>At this repulse rage seized the Babylonians or their generals.
Trumpets blew, banners waved, words of command were shouted. Then
suddenly the whole host, countless thousands of them whose front
stretched over a league of land, began their advance against our
little line of hills that measured scarcely more than four
furlongs from end to end.</p>

<p>Amasis saw their plan, which was to encircle and closing in
from behind, to overwhelm us with the weight of their number. He
divided our horse into two bodies and weary as they still were
from their journey against the Syrians, commanded them to charge
round the ends of the hills and to cut through those wings,
leaving the breast of the great host like a bull with severed
horns. This they did well enough, charging forward, and back
again through and through those Babylonians, or their allies,
till between the horns and the head there were great gaps; after
which they changed their tactics and charged at the tips of the
horns, crumpling them up, till from ordered companies they became
a mob.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the breast advanced, leaving a reserve to guard the
waggons and the stores and the plain below.</p>

<p>Wave upon wave of the picked troops of Babylon, they dashed up
at us, like breakers against a reef, and the real fight
began.</p>

<p>We raked them with our arrows, killing hundreds, but always
more poured on, till they came to the crest of the hills and met
the Egyptians sword to sword and spear to spear.</p>

<p>I had no part in that fight who stood behind in reserve, with
the General's Legion that guarded Amasis and Egypt's banners. Yet
I saw it all and noted that many of those who attacked, were
wasted with thirst, for their mouths were open and their tongues
hung out, while the hot sun beat down upon their helms and
armour.</p>

<p>Amasis saw it also, for I heard him say, "I thank the gods
that they have given me no Babylonian prince to be the captain of
my life. Now, on them, Egyptians!"</p>

<p>We rose, we charged, we drove them before us in a tumbled
mass, down those blood-stained slopes we drove them; yes, there
they died by the hundred and the thousand. At the foot of the
hill we re-formed, for many of us had been killed or wounded in
the great fray. Then we charged at the heart of the Babylonian
host where flew the banners of their general, the Prince
Merodach, a dense array of fifteen or twenty thousand of the best
of their troops, set to guard the general, the women and the
baggage. We fell on them like a flood, but were rolled back from
their triple line as a flood is from a wall of rock. We hung
doubtful whose force after all was small, when suddenly at the
head of about a thousand of his guards, whom he had kept in
reserve, Amasis himself charged past us. We, the rest of that
legion, would not be left behind. Leaving our dead and wounded we
charged with him. How it happened I do not know, but we broke the
triple line, we went into it as a wedge goes into wood, and it
split in two.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw the inmost body of horsemen that surrounded the
Babylonian standards, wheel about and gallop off. A soldier cried
into my ear,</p>

<p>"Merodach flies! Yes, he flies. Babylon is beaten!"</p>

<p>So it was indeed, for when the host saw that their general had
deserted them with his guard of chariots and horsemen, the heart
went out of them. No longer were they battalions of brave men,
nay, they became but as sheep driven by wolves or dogs. They
packed together, they fled this way and that, trampling one upon
the other. They fought no more, they flung down their arms, each
man seeking to save his own life. The Egyptians slew and slew
until they were weary. Then the trumpets called them back, save
the horsemen that for a while followed the wings of the army
which, seeing what had happened, abandoned hope and joined in the
rout.</p>

<p>What happened to that host? I do not know. Thousands of them
died, but thousands more wandered off into the desert seeking
safety and water, but above all water at the wells in their rear.
I can see them now, a motley crowd, elephants, camels, chariots,
horse and footmen, all mingled together, till at length they
vanished in the distance, except those who fell by the way.
Doubtless many of them reached Babylon and told their tale of
disaster into the ears of Nebuchadnezzar the Great King. But he
was aged and it was said distraught, almost on his deathbed
indeed, and had heard many such before. Always his hosts gathered
from the myriads of the East, were going forth to battle.
Sometimes they conquered, sometimes they were defeated. It
mattered little, seeing that there were always more myriads out
of which new hosts could be formed. In Babylon and Assyria and
the lands around life was plentiful and cheap, for there men bred
like flies in the mud and sun, and wealth was great, and when the
king commanded they must go out to die.</p>

<p>The victory was won! Now came its fruits, the hour of plunder
was at hand. There were the great parks of waggons filled with
stores and women; there were the pavilions of the royal prince,
the generals and the officers. Amasis himself, riding down our
lines his helmet in his hand, laughing as ever, shouted to us to
go and take, but to be careful to keep him his share.</p>

<p>We rushed forward without rank or order, for now there was
nothing to fear. All the enemy were fled save those who lay dead
or wounded, swart, black-bearded men. I, being young and swift
of foot, outran my fellows. We came to the pavilion of the prince
over which the banners of Babylon hung limply in the still air.
The soldiers swarmed into it seeking treasure, but I who cared
nothing for golden cups or jewels, ran round to another pavilion
in its rear which I guessed would be that of the women. Why I did
this I was not sure, for I wanted women even less than the other
spoil; but I think it must have been because I was curious and
desired to see what these ladies were like and how they were
housed.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that I entered this place alone and letting
fall the flap of the tent, which was magnificent and lined with
silk and embroideries, stared round me till my eyes grew
accustomed to the shadowed light and I saw that it was empty. No,
not empty, for at its end, seated on a couch was a glittering
figure, clad it seemed in silver mail, and beside it something
over which a veil was thrown. Thinking that this was a man, I
drew my sword which I had sheathed, and advanced cautiously.</p>

<p>Now I was near and the figure of which the head was bowed,
looked up and stared at me. Then I saw that the face beneath the
silver helm was that of a woman, a very beautiful woman, with
features such as the Greeks cut upon their gems, and large dark
eyes. I gazed at her and she gazed at me. Then she spoke, first
in a tongue which I did not understand, and when I shook my head,
in Greek.</p>

<p>"Egyptian, if so you be," she said, "seek elsewhere after the
others who are fled. I am no prize for you."</p>

<p>She threw aside a broidered cape that hung over her mail, and
I saw that piercing the mail was an Egyptian arrow of which the
feathered shaft was broken off, also that blood ran to her knees,
staining the armour.</p>

<p>I muttered words of pity, saying that I would bring a
physician, for suddenly I bethought me of Belus.</p>

<p>"It is useless," she said, "the hurt is mortal; already I
die."</p>

<p>Not knowing what to do, I made as though to leave her, then
stood still, and all the while she watched me.</p>

<p>"You are young and have a kindly face," said she, "high born
too, or so I judge. Look," and with a swift motion she cast off
the veil from that which rested against her.</p>

<p>Behold! it was a child of three or four years of age, a lovely
child, beautifully attired.</p>

<p>"My daughter, my only one," she said. "Save her, O Egyptian
Captain."</p>

<p>I stepped forward and bent down to look at the child. At this
moment some soldiers burst into the tent and saw us. Wheeling
round I perceived that they were men of my own company.</p>

<p>"Begone!" I cried, whereon one of them called out,</p>

<p>"Why, it is our young captain, the Count Ramose, who woos a
captive. Away, comrades, she is his, not ours, by the laws of
war. Away! and tell the rest to seek elsewhere."</p>

<p>Then laughing in their coarse soldier fashion, they departed
and presently I heard them shouting that this tent must be left
alone.</p>

<p>"Save her, Count Ramose, if such be your name," repeated the
woman. "Hearken. She is no mean child, for I am a daughter of him
who once was King of Israel. Now at the last I grow clear-sighted
and a voice tells me to trust you whom my God has sent to me to
be my friend. Swear to me by him you worship that you will guard
this child, yours by spoil of war; that you will not sell her on
the market, that you will keep her safe and clean, and when she
comes to womanhood, suffer her to wed where she will. Swear this
and I, Mysia, of the royal House of Israel, will call down the
blessing of Jehovah on you and yours and all your work, as should
you fail me, I will call down His curse."</p>

<p>"A great oath," I exclaimed hesitating, "to be taken by one
who is no oath breaker."</p>

<p>"Aye, great, great! Yet, hearken. She is not dowerless."</p>

<p>She glanced about her wildly to make sure that we were alone,
then from her side, or perhaps from some hiding-place in the
couch, she drew a broidered bag, and thrust it into my hands.</p>

<p>"Hide it," she said. "These royal jewels are her heritage;
among them are pearls without price."</p>

<p>I thrust the bag into the pouch I carried, throwing from it
the water bottle and the food which it had contained. Then I
answered,</p>

<p>"I swear; yet, believe me, Lady, not for the gems' sake."</p>

<p>"I know it, Count Ramose, for such eyes as yours were never
given to a robber of the helpless."</p>

<p>Then, as I knew by the motion of her hands, she blessed me in
a strange tongue, Hebrew I suppose, and blessed her daughter
also.</p>

<p>"Take her," she said presently in Greek, "for I die."</p>

<p>She bent down and kissed the child, then tried to lift her but
could not, being too weak to bear her weight. I took her in my
arms, asking,</p>

<p>"How is she named and who was her father?"</p>

<p>"Myra is her name," she gasped in a faint voice. Then her eyes
closed, she fell sideways on the couch, groaned and presently was
dead.</p>

<p>Lifting the veil with which it had been covered when first I
entered the tent, I threw it over the child which seemed to be
drugged, or mayhap had swooned with fear, cast one last glance at
the pale beauty of her dead mother, who looked indeed as though
she sprang from the blood of kings, and departed from that tent
which presently the soldiers plundered and burned.</p>

<p>Here I will say that of this lady's history I heard no more
for many years. She declared herself to be a daughter of a king
of Jerusalem, and I half believed the story thinking that at the
moment of death she would not lie to me. Certainly such a captive
when she grew to womanhood might well have been taken by a king's
son as one of his household. Also the jewels which the lady Mysia
gave to me, were splendid and priceless, such as kings might own,
being for the most part necklaces of great pearls. Among these
also was an emerald cylinder on which were graven signs and
writing that I could not read, a talisman of power as I learned
afterwards. But of this in its place.</p>

<p>Departing from the tent and skirting the great pavilion of
Merodach, I passed through groups of soldiers, counting or
quarrelling over their spoils. As night fell, I climbed the
slopes of the little hills that were thick with dead, for by now
after the cruel fashion of war, all the enemy's wounded had been
slain. At length I came to the tent which I shared with Belus,
laughed at on the way by one or two because of the great bundle
of spoil which I carried in my arms.</p>

<p>Here I found that philosopher, who had put off the armour
which became him so ill, clad in his own garments and engaged in
eating a simple meal of bread and sun-dried fruits. When he had
greeted me, which he did heartily rejoicing to see me come safe
from the battle, for the first time in the dusk of the tent he
noted the bundle in my arms.</p>

<p>"It is strange how the wisest of us may be deceived. I have
watched you from boyhood and thought that I knew your mind,
Ramose. Indeed I would have sworn that whatever your faults, you
were one who cared little for spoil. Yet I see that you have been
plundering like the commonest."</p>

<p>"Aye, Belus, I have been plundering and found a rich treasure,
yet I think one of which no one will wish to rob me. Lift the
veil and look."</p>

<p>He did so, while I turned to the door of the tent so that the
last of the daylight fell upon me and my burden. Belus stared at
the child who still slept or swooned. Then he stared at me,
saying,</p>

<p>"Now I wonder what god is at work in this business, and to
what end."</p>

<p>"The god of mercy, I think, if there be such a one which I
find it hard to believe just now," I answered. Then I told him
all the story.</p>

<p>"There are certain oaths that may be broken and yet leave the
soul of him who swore them but little stained, and there are
others of which even the stretching calls down Heaven's
vengeance. Such a one, Ramose, is that which you took before the
dying mother of this child, who by now doubtless has registered
it in the Recorder's book beyond the earth. Henceforth for good
or evil, she is your charge."</p>

<p>"I know it, Belus."</p>

<p>"Yet what is to be done?" he went on. "How can you remain a
soldier who have a babe tied to your girdle?"</p>

<p>"I do not wish to remain a soldier, who have seen enough of
slaughter, Belus."</p>

<p>"If you marry, your wife will look askance at this little
maiden and perchance maltreat her, Ramose; for what woman would
believe a tale of a babe found upon the battlefield?"</p>

<p>"I do not wish to marry, Belus. Have I not told you that I
have done with women?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;" Here a thought seemed to strike him for he
grew silent and at that moment the child awoke and began to
wail.</p>

<p>We quieted her as best we could and fed her with bread soaked
in the milk of goats, or camels, I forget which, for of all these
Belus had a store in the tent, till at last she fell asleep in my
arms. Then I laid her on my bed and gave Belus the jewels. These
he hid away among his charms and medicines where none would dare
to search for them lest some spell should be loosed upon them.
For all the Egyptians held Belus to be a great magician.</p>

<p>"They are the child's and holy," he said, "and therefore we
need give no account of them to the tellers of the spoil."</p>

<p>To which I answered that this was so, and turned to gaze upon
the gift that God had sent to me. As I gazed a great love of that
sweet child entered my heart where it still lives to-day.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap7"></a>CHAPTER 7<br>

RAMOSE SEEKS REFUGE IN CYPRUS</h2>

<p class="first">
WHEN I woke on the following morning the sun was up and save
for the child Myra, I found myself alone in the tent. She was
seated by me upon the rugs which, spread upon the sand, made my
soldier's couch, looking at me with her large, dark eyes. When
she saw that I was awake, she asked for her mother, speaking in
the Babylonian tongue of which I knew much even in those days,
having learned it from Belus. I told her that her mother had gone
away, leaving me to watch her, and I think she understood for she
began to weep. Then I took her in my arms and kissed her, till
presently she ceased weeping and kissed me back, at which my
heart went out to her who was an orphan in the power of
strangers.</p>

<p>Presently Belus returned, bringing with him a woman called
Metep, the widow of a soldier who had been killed by a fall from
his horse at the beginning of our march. This Metep was the
daughter of a peasant of the Delta, not well-favoured but
kind-hearted, one, too, who had loved her husband and would have
naught to do with the trollops of the camp, where she must stay
earning her living as she could do till the army returned to
Egypt. As it chanced she, who counted some thirty years, was
childless; yet she loved children, as those often do who have
none. Therefore we hired her to be the nurse of little Myra whom
she tended well and watched as though she were her own, preparing
her food and making her garments of stuffs that came from the
spoils of the Babylonian camp.</p>

<p>Belus told me that he had visited this camp at the break of
day, hoping to learn something of the lady Mysia, who while she
was dying, had told me that she was the daughter of a Jewish
king. In this he failed, for drunken soldiers had fired the tent
after plundering it and though he saw a body lying among the
ashes, it was so charred that he could not tell whether it were
that of man or woman, also it wore no armour such as I had seen,
of which perhaps it had been stripped by some marauder who, if it
was silver, broke it up for melting.</p>

<p>Also both then and afterwards he questioned certain prisoners,
but could learn nothing of this lady Mysia, who perhaps among the
Babylonians went by some other name. Merodach, they said, had
women in his train as had other princes and lords, but who these
were they did not know, for after the Eastern fashion they were
kept apart and when the host marched, travelled on camels in
covered panniers, or sometimes in closed litters. But now death
had taken those who led the beasts or bore the litters, and with
them the most of the lords who owned the women, the slaughter
having been very great. Therefore none was left to tell their
tale, even if it were known.</p>

<p>So the beauteous lady Mysia and her history were lost in the
darkness of the past, which even the eyes of Belus the diviner
could not pierce.</p>

<p>Amasis summoned the army and made an oration. He praised it.
He showed that its victory had been very marked over a mighty
host that outnumbered it many times; that it had been won by
discipline and courage, (of his own skill in generalship he said
nothing) and this without the aid of Greeks, (here the thousands
of his hearers shouted in their joy) those Greeks whom Pharaoh
leant upon and thought necessary in war, holding as he did that
they outpassed the Egyptians in all qualities that make a
soldier.</p>

<p>When he had given time for these cunning words of his to sink
into the hearts of his hearers, where as he guessed, they would
bear fruit in the future among Egyptians who hated and were
jealous of the Greeks that Pharaoh favoured, Amasis spoke of
other matters.</p>

<p>He said that after taking thought and counsel with his
captains, he had determined not to follow the Babylonians into
their own country.</p>

<p>"That host," he declared, "is utterly destroyed. Few of them
will live to behold the walls of the Great City, for thirst and
the desert men will cut off many of those who escaped the battle.
But the King of Babylon has other armies to fight us who are few
and war-worn after two victories, and whose horses are wearied
with heat and work. Lastly, friends, I have no command from
Pharaoh, the good god our master, to pursue the Babylonians
across the deserts but only that I should beat them back from the
borders of Egypt and because of your valour this has been done.
Now, therefore, with your leave, we will return to Sais and make
our report to Pharaoh."</p>

<p>Once more the army shouted applause, for nothing did they
desire less than to march into the burning waterless deserts,
there to fight new battles against the countless hosts of
Babylon, they who wished to return to their wives and children,
having earned the plots of watered land that Pharaoh promised to
his victorious soldiers.</p>

<p>This matter finished Amasis spoke of that of the booty which
was very great, for the Babylonian camp had been full of riches,
also thousands of horses and beasts of burden had been captured
during and after the battle. This spoil he commanded all men to
bring in, that his officers might divide it among them according
to their rank. Next morning this was done, though not without
many quarrels, for all who had captured anything, wished to keep
it for themselves. Amongst others I appeared carrying the child,
Myra, in whose garments were hidden the jewels that her mother
had given to me. This I did, because the punishment of those who
withheld anything, was death, also because I felt that my honour
was at stake although this wealth was not mine, but the
child's.</p>

<p>When I appeared before the officers bearing Myra in my arms, a
great laugh went up. One cried out, "How shall this plunder be
divided?" Another answered, "Let the little one be taken and sold
in the slave-market." To which a third replied, "Who then will
carry her to Sais?"</p>

<p>But the officer who acted as judge, behind whom stood Amasis
watching all, asked of me,</p>

<p>"Do you demand this child as your share of the loot, Count
Ramose?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered. "I saved her from the battlefield and I
demand her and all that she wears upon her body."</p>

<p>"Strip her!" cried one. "Her shift may be of gold."</p>

<p>The officer hesitated, but Amasis said,</p>

<p>"By the gods, are we babe-searchers? If the Captain Ramose
wishes for a child who he says that he has found upon the
battlefield, let him take her and welcome, with all that is on
her. Who knows? Perhaps he found her before he left Egypt!" he
added laughing, as did the others. So that danger passed with a
soldier's jest, and bowing, I went on.</p>

<p>On the second day from this of the dividing of the spoil, our
return march began. The army being heavy laden and weary and
having nothing more to fear, travelled slowly and in no close
array. One of the reasons why Amasis was so beloved of the
soldiers that afterwards they made him Pharaoh, was that he never
oppressed them or forced them to hard tasks that were not needed,
such as the fortifying of camps in an empty land. Hence each man
went much as he would though none was allowed to straggle or to
leave the host, and I was able to keep the child Myra close to me
and often riding on my horse. Thus it happened that from the
first she grew to love me and if we were separated for long,
would weep and refuse her food.</p>

<p>So at last we came to Pelusium where to reach Sais the army
must cross the mouths of the Nile. Here Amasis sent for me and
Belus.</p>

<p>"I have bad news for you," he said. "Apries your father is in
an evil mood; even our great victory over the Babylonians does
not rejoice him overmuch; almost might one think that he would
have been better pleased had we been driven back, perhaps because
he thinks that a certain general is more talked of in Egypt
to-day, than is Pharaoh's self. Nor is this all. As he can find
fault with little else he is angry because I did not obey his
order to send to him your head, Ramose, and with it Belus still
carrying his upon his shoulders; for his spies have told him that
you are with the army and have been promoted by me in reward of
your deeds. Again he bids me fulfil his commands, saying that the
Syrians have given him much trouble concerning you and demand
your life continually."</p>

<p>Now I looked at him in question, but Belus asked outright,</p>

<p>"Is such your purpose, General?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," he answered. "A man must think of himself
sometimes and I cannot always be troubled by Pharaoh about a
young Count and a certain physician and diviner. Such a matter
would be a small cause over which to quarrel with Pharaoh, though
it well may be that we shall quarrel ere all is done, as I think
you read in your stars, Belus. Hearken. This war is finished and
your service is over. There are many boats sailing down the Nile,
some of them large ships bound for Cyprus and elsewhere, taking
with them soldiers whose service is ended or who have been
wounded and seek their homes; also merchants. Now here I set few
guards and if to-morrow when I make public search for the Count
Ramose and Belus the Babylonian, that I may deliver them to
Pharaoh, they cannot be found, am I to blame? I have spoken."</p>

<p>"And we have heard," answered Belus.</p>

<p>Then Amasis shook us by the hand in his friendly fashion and
thanked me for my small share in the war, saying that he had
watched me and that I might make a good general one day, if I
gave my mind to arms and ceased from dreaming like a lovesick
girl. "Or," he added with meaning, "perhaps something higher than
a general, you who have old blood in you."</p>

<p>To Belus also he said that time alone would show whether he
were a true diviner, but that certainly he was the best of
physicians, as many a sick and wounded man in the army knew that
day. Nor was this all. As we were leaving the chamber, for we
spoke together in a house, Amasis called me back and thrust into
my hand a bag, saying that it was my share of the spoil which I
might find useful in my wanderings, which bag I found afterwards
was filled with Babylonian gold. The sight of that gold, I
remember, made me feel ashamed when I thought of the priceless
pearls that had been hidden from him, till I recalled that these
were not mine, but little Myra's inheritance.</p>

<p>Thus I bade farewell to the great captain Amasis whom I was to
see no more for years. Indeed I bade farewell for ever to the
Amasis I knew, for when we met again and he had exchanged a
general's staff for Pharaoh's sceptre, in many ways he was a very
different man.</p>

<p>Next morning at the dawn a merchant and his assistant, for as
such we were disguised, with their servant, a peasant woman and
her child, having hired passages, sailed amidst a motley crowd
upon a ship bound for certain ports along the coast and
afterwards for the isle of Cyprus. To Cyprus in the end we came
in safety and as I think, unknown of any, for all were intent
upon their own affairs, moreover the sea being rough, in no mood
for watching others. Also the most of them left the ship at the
coast ports.</p>

<p>Reaching Salamis, the greatest and most beautiful city of
Cyprus, we hired a lodging there in a humble street, giving out
that we were strangers who had escaped from Tyre which was
beleaguered by the Babylonians, and taking new names.</p>

<p>Here at Salamis we dwelt for many years, Belus, whom I called
my uncle, the brother of my mother, practising as a physician,
also in secret as a diviner, under the name of Azar, and I as a
merchant who dealt in corn and copper and was known as Ptahmes.
Nor did we labour in vain, for although we made no show during
those years we grew rich.</p>

<p>The mean street in which we dwelt, one running down towards
the sea at a point where the ships anchored, once had been a
great thoroughfare inhabited by rich merchants. Now these had
deserted it for other quarters where the high-born dwelt around
the palace of their chieftain who was called King of Salamis, for
in Cyprus there were many kings who, at this time, owned the
Pharaoh of Egypt as their over-lord. Yet their stone and marble
palaces remained, turned to seamen's lodges, marts where every
kind of merchandize was sold to mariners, thieves' quarters, or
even brothels.</p>

<p>The house to which we had come by chance, had been perhaps the
greatest of these palaces. Built of white stone or marble, it
contained many fine chambers surrounding a courtyard, and behind
it was a large garden with a fountain fed from a spring, where
grew some fig trees and an ancient olive, but for the rest
covered with nettles and rank growth. This house, or rather
palace, wherein at first we had hired but a few rooms, by degrees
we bought for no great price, so that at length it was all our
own. Leaving the front unkempt and dirty as of old, also those
spaces and the portico where I bought and sold, thus to deceive
curious eyes, and with them an outer lodge that once had been a
shrine dedicated to the worship of some Cyprian god, in which
Belus dispensed medicine or, in a back chamber, made divinations,
I set myself to repair the rest of that great building.</p>

<p>By degrees with thought and care, by help of skilled artists
of Cyprus and of Greece, I made it beautiful as it had been in
the day of its splendour when it was the home of merchant
princes. I scraped its marble halls and columns, I mended the
broken statues that stood around them, or procured others of a
like sort and perhaps by the same sculptors, to stand upon their
pedestals; I dug the dirt from the mosaics on the floor and hired
good workmen to relay what was lacking; to clean out the marble
baths that had been filled with rubbish and set the furnaces in
order; to repaint the walls whence the frescoes had faded, and I
know not what besides. Lastly I restored all the great garden
that had become a refuse heap, rebuilding the high wall about it,
making paths and flower-beds and setting a summer-house under the
ancient fig and olive trees that happily none had troubled to cut
down.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that, although no one would have so
believed who looked at it from the dirty street where drunkards
roamed at night, slatterns screamed and fought and children
played or begged of the passer-by, within the discoloured front
like to that of the temple of some forgotten god, lay a mansion
well-ordered, white and beautiful, filled with willing servants
sworn to us under the oaths of some order of which Belus was a
chief; a home worthy to be inhabited by the great ones of the
earth.</p>

<p>Why did I do all these things and why did Belus help in the
work? For sundry reasons. First because then as now I loved all
that is beautiful, all that lights the soul through the windows
of the eyes; and secondly because I, who was a scholar when I
ceased to be a merchant, needed calm and quiet and fit places in
which to store my manuscripts, where I could study them in peace.
Yet behind all this lay a deeper reason. I was a celibate, one
who because of a terror that had struck me in my boyhood, had
forsworn woman and determined to fill her place with philosophy
and learning, also with the study of religion and of the nature
of the gods and of men, and of how these may draw near to the
Divine.</p>

<p>The arts of magic and divination, however, I left alone,
having always held these to be unlawful, though Belus who
practised them after the fashion of the Babylonians, the great
masters of star-lore and of sorcery, thought otherwise. Yet when
we reasoned about the matter, he confessed to me that these were
two-edged weapons which often cut those who wielded them, also
that the answers which spirits gave, for the most part might be
read in more ways than one. Still at times he was a good prophet.
For example when he foresaw that trouble would be brought upon me
by the beauteous queen Atyra, and that the general Amasis would
rise to Pharaoh's throne which then no one else so much as
guessed, except perhaps Amasis himself, in whose mind Belus may
have read it.</p>

<p>For the rest, these gifts of Belus were of great service to
us, inasmuch as they brought us into the councils of the highest
in the land, for these of Cyprus were very superstitious and
would pay great sums for oracles and horoscopes, protecting those
who furnished them from all harm, since such foreseeing men were
looked upon as prophets favoured of Heaven.</p>

<p>Thus drawing gain from all these sources, trade, medicine, and
divination, living under our false names, we grew both wealthy
and powerful, though with politics and plottings we would have
naught to do, and outwardly remained humble and of no
account.</p>

<p>To tell all the truth, there was a further reason why I made
that old palace which to the passer-by seemed a mere relic of
past greatness, so beautiful within, filling it with everything
that was perfect and lovely. Myra was that reason. From the
beginning, as I have said, this child loved me as a father, aye,
and more, seeing that even in early youth a maid will favour
other men besides her own father, because Nature so teaches her.
With Myra it was otherwise. She clung to me alone, though Belus
she liked well enough, also she loved her nurse, Metep, in a
fashion. And as she loved me, so I loved her; indeed she was my
all, the eyes of my head and the heart within my breast. Had she
died, swept off of some sickness, of which there were many in
Cyprus especially in the hot season, I think that I should have
died also, or perhaps have slain myself that I might follow her
to the Shades.</p>

<p>Therefore my desire was that those sweet innocent eyes of hers
should never look save upon what was gracious and uplifting, and
that on the tablets of her mind should be written nothing that
was not pure and holy. I was her tutor also; in the mornings and
after my trafficking was done in the evening, we studied
together, reading the Grecian poets when she was old enough, or
sometimes the hieroglyphics of Egypt, of which I expounded the
hidden lore.</p>

<p>Belus took a hand in this game also, teaching her the wisdom
of Babylon, its writing and its tongue; showing her the motions
of the stars and how the world moved among them; telling her,
too, the history of Israel and other nations, and instructing her
in figures. So this child grew learned beyond her years, for her
mind was quick and bright, though at times she had her thoughtful
moods. In body she grew also, tall and straight and very fair to
see, dark-eyed yet with hair the brown colour of ripe corn which
told, perhaps, of the inter-mingling of her Hebrew blood with
some more western stock. Thus at last in that hot land, she came
near to womanhood and her mind growing ever, ripened till,
although more wayward, it was the equal of my own and in certain
ways its master.</p>

<p>One day Belus came upon us seated side by side studying an old
manuscript with the lamplight shining on our faces, and stood
contemplating us with that strange, secret smile of his playing
round his withered lips. Our work done Myra rose and went upon a
household errand. When she was gone Belus said,</p>

<p>"You two make a handsome pair and look so much of an age, that
some might think that you were not father and daughter, as it is
given out you are."</p>

<p>"Nor are we," I answered with a start, "at least in
blood."</p>

<p>Then I was silent, for the thought troubled me.</p>

<p>"Has not the time come," went on Belus, "when this maiden
should be told how she fell into your keeping?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I answered. "Do you tell her, Belus, for I
cannot."</p>

<p>Tell her he did, in what words or when I do not know. At least
on the following evening at the hour when we were wont to work,
Myra came and sat opposite to me, her chin resting on her hand,
looking at me with her large eyes from which I think tears had
flowed, for her face was troubled.</p>

<p>"So, Father," she said at length, "you are not my father. I am
no one's child and all that Metep has said to me about my mother
who died when I was born is false."</p>

<p>"Has Belus been speaking with you, Myra?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He has told me all, saying you thought I ought to know,
now when I am no more a little girl. I wish he had been silent,"
she added passionately.</p>

<p>"Why, Myra?"</p>

<p>"Because if I am not your daughter you will cease to love me,
while I cannot cease to love you."</p>

<p>"Certainly I shall never cease to love you while I live, Myra,
nor after perhaps."</p>

<p>Her face brightened.</p>

<p>"Then all is not black as I feared, for if you ceased to love
me&mdash; oh! what shall I call you?"</p>

<p>"Ramose, when we are alone, but Father as of old before
others."</p>

<p>"&mdash;if you ceased to love me&mdash;Ramose&mdash;I think
that I should die. So it is and so it will ever be."</p>

<p>Now I grew frightened, although my heart leapt with joy at
those sweet words.</p>

<p>"Perchance a day may come, Myra, when you will learn to love
someone better than you do me."</p>

<p>"Never!" she answered fiercely&mdash;"Never!" and she struck
the table with her little hand. "I know what you mean. Do we not
read of marriage in books and was not Metep once married? Do not
say that you wish me to marry, for I will never marry. I hate all
men, save you and Belus."</p>

<p>"They will not hate you, I fear."</p>

<p>"What does it matter what they do? I have seen them; it is
enough. Tell me quickly that you do not wish me to marry."</p>

<p>"No, no, Myra, I wish that we should go on as we
are&mdash;always."</p>

<p>"Ah! I am glad. That makes me happy."</p>

<p>Here a new and dreadful thought struck her, for she added with
a gasp,</p>

<p>"But you might marry, you whom all must love; and that I could
not bear."</p>

<p>"Be silent, foolish one," I broke in. "I shall never marry. On
that matter I have sworn an oath."</p>

<p>"Oh! that is good tidings. Yet," she added slowly, "Belus says
that it is not wise to swear oaths when we are young, since we
seldom keep them when we are old."</p>

<p>"Let Belus be and by the gods I pray you to talk no more of
marriage, for the word does not please me, nor as yet is it
fitting for your lips. Come, Myra, we waste time. Let us to the
deciphering of this old poem that tells us of dead days and
beautiful forgotten folk."</p>

<p>"I come, Ramose. Yet first I would say that I do remember
something of the past of which Belus spoke. The shape of a tall
and lovely lady with dark hair and eyes often haunts my sleep.
Was my mother thus and did she ride among hosts of men clad in
silver?"</p>

<p>"I saw her but once, Myra, and then for a very little while in
an hour of death and tumult, but so she seemed to me. Perhaps now
at times she visits you from the underworld to watch and bless
you. Dream on of her, Myra, and for the rest let it lie. The gods
have sent you here to rejoice the world, how they sent you is of
no account. Take what the gods give you and be thankful."</p>

<p>"I am thankful," she said humbly and yet with pride, "for
whatever they have taken away, have they not given me you who
saved me from death and are not ashamed to love a poor maid who
is no one's child."</p>

<p>Then we began our reading of the Grecian poet, nor did we talk
again of this matter for a long while. Yet from that day life was
a little different for both of us, and became more so as Myra
grew to full and fairest womanhood. She was innocent if ever a
maiden was, yet Nature taught her certain things, as perchance
did her nurse Metep, pitying her motherless state. Therefore no
longer would she throw her arm about me as we worked, or press
her cheek against my own. But from that day also in some subtle
fashion we became more intimate, though this new intimacy was one
of the spirit. Our thoughts leapt together towards an unknown
end. Soon Myra discovered that I sought for more than learning;
that I sought after Truth, or rather after God who is Truth, and
could not find him. Here it was that she came to my aid, perhaps
because of the blood that was in her, that of the Hebrews.</p>

<p>For months we had been studying the gods of sundry nations,
those of the Egyptians, those of the Greeks, those of the
Babylonians, and others, a search in which Belus helped us much,
for though I think he believed in none of them, he knew the
attributes of all and their forms of worship.</p>

<p>At last the task was done. There written on a roll were all
the gods and goddesses that we could count, and against each name
its qualities and powers, as its worshippers conceived these to
be. It was a great list that caused the mind to reel. Myra gazed
at it, winding up upon a rod the roll which she had written in
her neat letters, so that god after god departed into darkness as
though Time had taken them from the eyes of men.</p>

<p>"What of all these?" I asked wearily at length.</p>

<p>She made no answer but taking me by the hand, led me to a
window-place whence she drew the curtain. The night was very fine
and clear and the blue of the great sky was spangled with a
thousand thousand stars.</p>

<p>"You see those stars?" she said. "Well, Belus, who is a great
astronomer as the Babylonians have been from the beginning, tells
me that everyone of them is a world, or perhaps a sun like our
own, with worlds about it. Now, Ramose, you wise philosopher,
tell me. Do all those worlds worship our multitude of gods, most
of them made like men or women, only stronger and more evil, and
named gods by this little land or that, or even by this city or
by that?"</p>

<p>"I think not," I answered.</p>

<p>"Then, Ramose, must there not be one God, King of the Heavens,
King of the Earth, whom we ought to worship, taking no count of
all the rest?"</p>

<p>"That is what the Hebrews say, Myra."</p>

<p>"My mother told you that she was a Hebrew, and no mean one.
Perhaps, Ramose, this is what she teaches when she visits me in
my sleep."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I answered.</p>

<p>Then we passed on to other lighter matters, and doubtless
before she left me Myra had forgotten all this debate which
sprang suddenly from her heart, and as suddenly passed away. But
if she forgot, I remembered and considered and accepted, till in
the end, rejecting all else, though as yet I knew him not, in my
heart I became a worshipper of that one unknown God of whom she
had spoken, whereof all the other gods were rays in so far as
they were good, or perchance ministering spirits.</p>

<p>Thus then did the maid Myra find the answer to my questionings
and first outline the faith that I hold to-day.</p>

<p>Often I discussed these great matters with Belus. That wise
man who had sifted the truth so often that at last he came to
believe in nothing, only smiled, shook his head and answered,</p>

<p>"What is this one new god that you have found, but he who is
named Fate, whose decrees I read written in the stars,
unchangeable from the beginning of the world?"</p>

<p>"Does that make him less a god?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," he answered, "it only gives him another name. But what
is God? What is God?"</p>

<p>"Perchance that which we search for in the heavens and at
length find in our own hearts," I answered...</p>

<p>News came to Cyprus and reached us very swiftly through its
great ones who were our clients. Thus we heard how Adikran the
Libyan, being oppressed of the Cyrenians had prayed Apries my
father, the Pharaoh, to help him against these Greeks. Thereon it
seemed, the Egyptian party at Pharaoh's court forced him against
his will to despatch an army to destroy those of Cyrene. As it
happened, however, these defeated that army with heavy loss,
whereon there was a great outcry in Egypt, the people thinking
that Apries who was known to love the Greeks, had made a plot
that the Egyptian troops should be destroyed by them. Then, so
went the tale, Pharaoh in his trouble turned to Amasis, the
general under whom I had fought against the Babylonians, and sent
him to the army which was in rebellion, to take command of it,
thinking that he, whom the Egyptians loved, would bring it to
obedience. Yet the result was otherwise, for the Egyptian troops,
seizing Amasis, set a crown upon his head and declared him
Pharaoh, thus fulfilling the prophecy of Belus.</p>

<p>Now Apries my father raised another great army of thirty
thousand Greeks to fight Amasis. But in this as in all battles,
Amasis proved himself the better general, defeating the Greeks
and taking Apries my father prisoner. So he remained a prisoner
for some years, being well treated by Amasis who was kind-hearted
and indeed kept him to rule with him over Egypt. In the end
Apries rebelled, and departing from Sais, began to raid Egypt
with his Greeks. There followed more fighting and at last Apries
was killed, some said by the Egyptians, and some by his own
soldiers. At least he was killed in a boat upon the Nile, and
Amasis, taking his body, embalmed it and gave it royal
burial.</p>

<p>This then was the fate of Pharaoh my father whom I had seen
last at that farewell feast which he gave to Atyra the Syrian
queen. Yes, this was the end of all his greatness and his
glory&mdash;to be butchered like a sheep in a boat upon the Nile,
after Amasis, who had saved me from death at his hands, had cast
him from his throne.</p>

<p>Such was the news that came to us from Egypt while, under our
feigned names, we lay hid in the city of Salamis in Cyprus.</p>

<p>When we were sure that the Pharaoh Apries, who begot me, was
dead and that Amasis filled his throne, Belus spoke to me,
saying,</p>

<p>"Is it your wish, Ramose, to dwell here at Salamis as a
merchant for all your days? Bethink you, you have no longer
anything to fear from the wrath of him who was Pharaoh, for
Amasis sits in his place, and Amasis is, or was, your friend and
mine."</p>

<p>"Nay," I answered, "I would return to Egypt to learn whether
my mother still lives."</p>

<p>For though we had been parted these many years I still loved
my mother. Yet I had not dared to write to her, because I feared
her busy tongue and lest she should whisper of my whereabouts and
thus set Pharaoh's dogs upon my scent. Therefore I thought it
wisest to leave her believing that I was dead.</p>

<p>"If so, let us return, Ramose. Where you and Myra go, thither
I will go also who grow too old to seek new friends. We have
wealth in plenty and can live together where we will&mdash;until
my call comes."</p>

<p>I opened my lips to ask him of what call he spoke, then
bethinking me that he must mean that of death, closed them again.
Yet this was not so, as I learned afterwards.</p>

<p>Thus in few words we agreed upon this great matter, which I
did the more willingly because it came to my ears that a certain
high one in Cyprus whom it would have been hard to resist, had
learned of the wonderful beauty of the maid Myra and was plotting
to take her. Very quietly we sold all that belonged to us in
Cyprus and transferred our wealth to those with whom we dealt in
Egypt, honourable men who, we knew, would keep it safe until we
came to claim it in the trade name of our Cyprian firm, though it
is true that when I saw how great it had grown, I was afraid.</p>

<p>At length all was ready and the ship in which we must sail on
the morrow, lay at anchor at the mole. We three sat, somewhat
desolate, in our desolate home that was no longer ours, for we
had sold it with the rest. The statues, the vases, the gems and
all the priceless treasures that piece by piece I had gathered to
please our eyes and to make the place beautiful were on board the
vessel, together with the most of such of the household as had
chosen to follow us, so that the chambers looked naked and
unfriendly. Myra noted it and wept a little, saying,</p>

<p>"I have been very happy here in Salamis, Ramose, and I would
that we were not going away. My heart tells me that trouble
awaits us yonder in Egypt."</p>

<p>Now I was distressed and knew not what to answer, save that
regrets came too late, for I could not tell her about the peril
from that high lord. But Belus replied,</p>

<p>"It is natural that you should grieve, Myra, who have grown
from infancy to the verge of womanhood in this place. Yet
hearken. My heart or rather the stars tell me another tale. I
seem to see it written on the book of Fate that whatever ills we
may find in Egypt, those that are worse would overtake us if we
lived on here. I tell you," he added solemnly, "that a curse and
great desolation hang over Salamis. What it is I do not know.
Mayhap it will be burned by the Babylonians, or other foes, but
unless my wisdom is at fault, soon Salamis the beautiful will be
no more."</p>

<p>Thus he spoke nor did we question him about the matter, for
like all seers, when Belus had uttered his oracle he would not
speak of it again.</p>

<p>The next morning before the light we embarked secretly upon
our ship, which we had given out was sailing on a trading
venture, and departed from the shores of Cyprus. Before ever we
set foot upon the quays of Memphis, we learned that a great
earthquake had shaken much of Salamis to the ground, burying
hundreds of her citizens, and that among the streets destroyed
was that in which we had dwelt, for a mighty wave following the
earthquake had flowed over it, washing it into the deep.</p>

<p>When we heard this tale, Belus looked at us and smiled, but we
said nothing, whatever we might think.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap8"></a>CHAPTER 8<br>

AT MEMPHIS</h2>

<p class="first">
AT length we came safe to Memphis, for Apries being dead and
the Grecian mercenaries and marauders who clung to him, slain, or
scattered, or driven away, there was peace throughout Egypt under
the rule of the new Pharaoh, Amasis the Egyptian. The gates of
the cities stood open, the Nile was free to all who sailed upon
it, the husbandman ploughed his field and none robbed him of its
fruits. In those years, before the Persians fell upon her, Egypt
rested unafraid, rich and happy beneath the strong hand of
Amasis.</p>

<p>As soon as we came ashore in the early morn I made inquiry of
a port captain whether Tapert the high officer still dwelt there,
and learned that he had been some years dead. Then with secret
fear, but as it seemed carelessly, saying that I had known him
when I was a lad, I asked if any of his household remained and
waited with a beating heart.</p>

<p>"Nay," was the answer, "he left no children, but the Grecian
lady lives on, she whom he married and who once, as she declares,
was the love of Apries the Pharaoh. Indeed she remains a fair and
gracious lady, one of much wealth also, for Tapert left her all
he had, which was not a little. She dwells alone in a great house
in a garden, not far from the temple of Ptah, and is famous for
her hospitality, for she spends the most of her substance on
feasts and costly raiment, saying that she has none for whom to
save."</p>

<p>Now when I heard that my mother lived I was glad, for though
the man's words showed me that she was still vain and foolish,
after all she was my mother who had given me life.</p>

<p>Leaving the ship and its cargo in the charge of the officers
appointed to watch the goods of traders, and of our servants, I
hired asses, also a guide. Mounting these beasts, the three of
us, Belus and I and Myra, who wore a veil in the Eastern fashion
to hide her face, rode through the mean suburb that lay without
the wall between the banks of Nile and the city, to the gate,
through which we passed unquestioned. The guide led us up a broad
street on either side of which dwelt the richest of the citizens,
till, not far from the enclosure of the great temple of Ptah, we
came to a walled garden. Being admitted we rode on through this
beautiful garden to the door of a large white house built round a
courtyard, which he said was that of the widow of Tapert. Here
servants in fine garments such as are worn in palaces, ran out
asking our business, to whom I answered that we were strangers
newly arrived at Memphis who wished to have speech with their
mistress about a matter that would be of interest to her, and
when, unsatisfied, they desired to learn our names, I gave those
of Ptahmes and Azar by which we had been known in Cyprus.</p>

<p>A man departed with this message and presently there came an
old fellow who carried a wand which showed me that much state was
kept in this house. Moreover, although he knew me not, I knew
him, for when I was a child he had been one of the servants
appointed to my mother at Pharaoh's court.</p>

<p>"Follow me," he said, bowing in the fashion that he had learnt
there in his youth.</p>

<p>"We follow," I answered and I saw him start at the sound of my
voice and look at me curiously, like one who searches his mind
for something forgotten.</p>

<p>We crossed the courtyard and a narrow, pillared gallery by
which it was surrounded, and entered a large chamber with open
window-places that looked towards the Nile. Near to one of these,
seated in a beautiful carved chair inlaid with ivory, sat a tall
woman clad in white Grecian robes, engaged in stringing a
necklace of gold and gems.</p>

<p>From far off I knew her for my mother. Although now her hair
was darker and her features thinner than they used to be, there
remained the same gracious form, the same quick movement of the
delicate hands and the same large grey eyes with which she
glanced at us, as always was her wont to do at strangers. That
glance first fell upon me and so dwelt awhile; then as though she
were puzzled, with a shake of the head it passed on to Belus of
whom she made nothing for he wore an Eastern robe with a hood to
it. Lastly it rested upon the maiden Myra who had thrown back her
veil, while astonishment grew upon her face, doubtless because of
the beauty that she saw. It passed and she motioned to us to be
seated upon stools that had been set for us, then asked in her
pleasant voice,</p>

<p>"What is your pleasure, strangers, with Chloe, who once was
great in Egypt, but now is known as the widow of Tapert? Can she
be of any help to you?"</p>

<p>I whispered to Belus to speak, because I was confused.</p>

<p>"Lady," he said, "for a certain reason we have come here,
travelling from far, to ask you if you know what has chanced to a
young man named Ramose, who was said to be the son of Pharaoh now
gathered to Osiris, as you were said to be his mother."</p>

<p>She turned pale and let fall the necklace.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked in a cold voice, "that you come
hither to stir up bitter memories? Ramose my son is dead. Trouble
came upon him through a high-placed Syrian harlot who bewitched
him, handling him as such women do the young who take their
fancy, and whose death was laid at his door, as though a lad
would have wished to slay his lover. So, as I was told, he fled
away with a Babylonian knave and sorcerer called Belus, who was
his tutor and used to draw horoscopes and doctor the sick at
Pharaoh's court&mdash;indeed be it admitted&mdash;whatever his
horoscopes may have been, his doctoring was good for I have
profited by it. They fled to Amasis, now Pharaoh, who at that
time was general of an army which fought and defeated the
Babylonians, and there, as I have heard, my son played a man's
part in war. Then he vanished away, for though the battle spared
him, Pharaoh sought his life because of the high-placed Syrian
strumpet whose death had brought trouble upon Egypt, and all know
what happens to those of whom Pharaoh seeks the life?"</p>

<p>Now Belus threw back his hood and looking at my mother,
asked,</p>

<p>"Does the great lady Chloe find the medicine that the knave
and sorcerer Belus gave to her amongst others, for the pain which
used to strike her in the head above the eyes, still of service
in the autumn of the year?"</p>

<p>My mother sprang from her chair, staring at him.</p>

<p>"By Zeus!" she cried, "you are Belus, and little changed, as
would chance with a sorcerer. Oh! Belus, tell me of my son. What
befell my son for whom I had such high hopes? If he died, why are
you, who shared his sin, alive?"</p>

<p>"Because sorcerers do not die, Lady," replied Belus drily.
"Others die, but they live on, else of what use is it to be a
sorcerer?"</p>

<p>My mother made no answer to his mockeries, but still stared at
him.</p>

<p>"One thing is certain," continued Belus, "that if I am a
sorcerer and a knave, you are no witch, but only&mdash;forgive
me&mdash;a fool."</p>

<p>"A fool!" she answered angrily. "Why so?"</p>

<p>"Because a wise woman would have made certain that he whom she
loved was truly dead before she put on the veil of mourning."</p>

<p>"Your meaning?" she said haughtily.</p>

<p>"I have talked too much," said Belus. "Ask it of these others.
Am I your only visitor, Lady Chloe?"</p>

<p>Now for the first time my mother looked fixedly at me, who was
dressed in a plain merchant's robe and seated in the shadow
beyond the shaft of light that flowed through the window
place.</p>

<p>"Sir," she said in a hesitating voice, "do you know aught of
this business of the death of my son who, had he lived, might now
perhaps have been a man of your age, though not, I think, a
merchant, for I will not hide that he had royal blood in
him."</p>

<p>Now I drew my stool forward out of the shadow so that the
light fell full upon my face, and lifted the merchant's cap from
my head, revealing the brown hair that curled beneath.</p>

<p>She stared at me; oh! how she stared!&mdash;then muttered as
though to herself,</p>

<p>"Can this be Ramose whom last I saw as a lad? Nay, it is not
possible, for had he lived Ramose who loved me as a child and for
whose sake I tore myself away from the sight of him, would never
have left me desolate all these long years, believing that he was
dead. Yet&mdash;those eyes&mdash;that hair, yes, and the fashion
of locking his fingers -! Oh, torment me no more. Are you Ramose,
or another?"</p>

<p>"I am Ramose, your son," I said, and was silent, for words
choked in my throat.</p>

<p>She uttered a little cry, then rose and threw herself upon my
breast and lay there speechless. In the stillness that followed I
heard Belus whisper, I suppose to Myra, who all this while had
sat like a statue, or perchance to himself,</p>

<p>"A fool I called her, and rightly. For what else is a woman
who does not know her own son?"</p>

<p>"Be quiet," answered Myra, "or I shall call you hard names,
Belus."</p>

<p>And he obeyed her, for with him Myra could do what she
would.</p>

<p>"Listen, my mother," I said gently, "and reproach me no more
because I hid from you that I was alive. I did this knowing that
if you learned the truth, others would learn it too, and soon I
should cease to be alive, for the ears of Pharaoh are long. Also
I was not sure till an hour ago whether you still dwelt in
Memphis or anywhere upon the earth. Therefore, under a false
name, I lay hid in another land until I knew that Pharaoh my
father was dead, and that I could return to Egypt to seek you
fearing nothing, for he who now is Pharaoh was my friend and
saved me from doom."</p>

<p>"Who is this before whom you tell all your secrets?" asked my
mother, pointing at Myra. "Is she your wife? Nay, she is too
young. Your daughter then?"</p>

<p>"Aye, the daughter of my heart, one whom Heaven sent to me who
am still unwed."</p>

<p>"Then let this daughter of your heart be welcome," said my
mother, "and be sure that I shall ask no questions concerning her
that you do not wish to answer. Yes, and Belus also."</p>

<p>Of that day of reunion after many years I need write no more.
Before we sat down to eat at noon our tale was told, though
whether my mother believed that part of it which had to do with
the finding of Myra upon the battlefield, I do not know.
Moreover, I had promised that the three of us would take up our
abode in my mother's house which was large and stately, for she
would not suffer that we should go elsewhere, though from the
first Myra wished to do so.</p>

<p>Thus began our life at Memphis. It was a very happy life, yet
it had its troubles, as have all lives. First, I who had been so
busy a man, occupied for many hours of the day with my trading,
now must be idle, which I found wearisome. To remedy it, having
wealth at my command, I bought lands near to the city, and farmed
them. I bred cattle and horses, the finest beasts, perhaps, that
had been seen in Egypt; I tamed deer and wild animals and raised
every kind of grain. Yet as this was not enough, with Belus and
Myra I followed after all learning, till at last I was almost as
wise as Belus himself and Myra lagged not far behind me.</p>

<p>At all this my mother stared, saying that poring over scrolls
and calculations was no task for a lovely maiden, or for the
matter of that, for a man still young who should be busy with
great affairs. Even my breeding of beasts did not please her, for
this, she said, was the business of farmers and such humble folk.
At length I grew vexed and asked her what she would have me do,
who already possessed more riches than I needed, not counting her
own which were great.</p>

<p>"Do!" she answered. "Why, rise. Be a man, show yourself as a
high lord in Egypt, become famous. Wage wars and win them, as
your noble Grecian forefathers would have done. Are you Pharaoh's
son, of the true royal blood of Egypt upon the father's side;
indeed as I believe, his only son left living, for Amasis or his
party, has blotted out all the rest? Are you not by rank a Count
of Egypt; have you not wealth at your command as great perhaps as
that of any prince or noble of Egypt? Have you not a mother who
knows the ways of courts and can help you? Yet you spend your
days tramping amongst swamps to watch the corn spring, or
counting calves and foals, and your nights with a maiden and a
philosopher, studying strange, ancient books or staring at the
stars. So the precious years slip through your hands like water
and soon you will be old, not leaving so much as one lawful child
behind you because of some silly vow you have taken that divorces
you from woman."</p>

<p>Thus my mother taunted me, for she was very ambitious and as I
could see, desired that I should wipe out the stain upon my birth
by rising to great station where she could glitter at my side.
Aye, she desired more, though she never said as much in words,
namely, that I should become Pharaoh of Egypt in place of one
whom she called "the usurper" and the "murderer" of Apries who
had been her lord and my begetter.</p>

<p>For she forgot that this father of mine had sought earnestly
to put me to death because of the trouble about a Syrian queen,
which had disappointed him in his policies, and that Amasis had
saved me from his anger. But I did not forget these things and
therefore would have nothing to do with such plots, who indeed
had no desire to become Pharaoh, but sought only to lead a quiet,
learned life, such as befitted a man of fortune who knew that our
days are short and who looked onward to all that might lie beyond
it.</p>

<p>Still, to please my mother who would not let me be in peace, I
entered into the public business of the city, taking this office
and that, and rising always to the leadership of men. For
now&mdash;I think through her&mdash; it became known who I was,
none less in fact than the only living son of the dead Pharaoh,
also that I was one of the richest men in Egypt; for which
reasons I was courted, not only by the common people, but by the
nobles and even by the high priests of the temples of the gods.
For, after her vanity and ambition, this was my mother's greatest
fault&mdash;she could not keep silent.</p>

<p>Now if these things were bad, another was worse, namely, the
jealousy which sprang up between my mother and Myra.</p>

<p>Since I had returned to her I was everything to my mother, who
would never leave me if she had her way. But before I returned I
had been everything to Myra who was the constant companion of my
leisure hours and who, as I have said, from the beginning would
look upon no other man with favour, except at times, on Belus.
Thus these two crossed each other's path continually till at
length if I were sitting with the one, the other would not enter,
but departed saying she saw that I did not wish to be disturbed,
or some such words. All of which vexed me much and caused Belus
to smile.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, month by month Myra became more learned and sweet
in mind and more beautiful in face and form, till at last she was
the fairest maiden that ever I beheld.</p>

<p>One day Belus asked me,</p>

<p>"Why do you not marry Myra, Ramose?"</p>

<p>I started at his words, and answered,</p>

<p>"Have I not told you that, like a priest of Isis, I am sworn
to remain celibate? Also Myra is very young and before she turns
her thoughts to marriage, she should see other men, young men of
her own age, one of whom perhaps she might desire as a
husband."</p>

<p>"And do you desire to give her to some such stranger?"</p>

<p>At this a sudden change took place in me and a pain shot
through my heart. It was as though it had been gripped by a cold
hand. It was as though I had come face to face with death.</p>

<p>"I desire Myra's happiness," I answered, looking down, "I who
stand in the place of her father, and mother too."</p>

<p>"Would it not be well to ask her what she herself
desires?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. Perhaps, when she is older&mdash;say in a year
or two. Meanwhile she is happy in her state; let her remain so
for a while."</p>

<p>"Many things happen in a year or two," said Belus drily.</p>

<p>Now it would seem that this same matter of marriage was
troubling my mother's mind, only in another sense, for having
found me after many years of separation, and being by nature
somewhat jealous, she did not desire that I should marry and
thus, as she thought, be taken away from her again, at any rate,
not yet. Least of all did she desire that Myra should become my
wife although she was so lovely and so learned, because she was
sure that then one roof would not cover the three of us, however
large it might be. In truth it was Myra whom she wished to see
wed, but not to me, if indeed it were lawful that I should marry
her. For she thought or tried to think that we who were as father
and daughter, would never be happy as husband and wife. Also,
although she had taunted me on the matter, in her heart she
believed that having remained single so long, it would be best
that I should continue so, satisfying myself with her love and
company, with no other woman to come between us.</p>

<p>Therefore she began to talk to her friends of the great charm
and favour of this ward of mine in such a way that many came to
think that she was not my ward, but my daughter, as perhaps at
times she did herself who wished that it might be so. Further,
she gave feasts to the noblest of Memphis, at which feasts Myra
was present and was made known to the guests as my adopted
daughter. Soon that happened which she had foreseen.</p>

<p>Within a month young Counts and others were seeking after
Myra, and within two, one of them, a very fine gallant, had asked
her hand through my mother, who at once told Myra what had
chanced.</p>

<p>Myra, it seemed, making no answer, rose and departed with
angry eyes. That afternoon I was away from home, checking the
cattle on my farm with my overseers. The business was long and
the moon was up before I returned, entering the garden of the
house by a side gate, as was my custom. Following a winding path
I came to a clump of palms, the most secret place in all that
large garden, where stood seats and a table which Myra and I
often used when we worked together in the heat of the day,
because there a breeze always blew beneath the roof of palm
leaves.</p>

<p>Suddenly a figure appeared stopping my path and I sprang back,
fearing thieves. Then the tall figure threw off its hood and the
sweet voice of Myra said,</p>

<p>"Ramose, forgive me, Ramose, but I would speak with you
alone."</p>

<p>"What is it, child? Cannot you always speak with me
alone?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Ramose, not of late, for in this way or in that, it
seems that the lady your mother hears all I have to say. In
Memphis we are not as we were at Salamis the happy."</p>

<p>"Well, speak on, most dear," I said, seating myself upon the
bench and pointing to her accustomed place.</p>

<p>She took it, and said presently,</p>

<p>"Ramose, I am wretched. Your mother does not love me. I think
that she is very jealous of me because you&mdash;do love me, or
did in past days. Therefore she makes plots against me."</p>

<p>"What plots?" I asked astonished.</p>

<p>"Plots to be rid of me that she may keep you to herself.
Ramose, in secret she gives it out that I am your daughter, which
you tell me is not true, and that it would rejoice you to see me
wed to some man of station."</p>

<p>"Hush!" I said. "Child, you dream. It is possible that my
mother may have thought that you were too lonely here and like
other maidens, desired to be courted, but for the rest, I say you
dream."</p>

<p>"Aye, Ramose, I dream so well that&mdash;" here she named one
of the greatest in Memphis&mdash;"has asked me in marriage
through her."</p>

<p>"What of it, child?" I said lightly. "He is a man well spoken
of, wealthy and in the way of advancement, if somewhat loud-voiced
and boastful to my fancy."</p>

<p>"Perchance, Ramose. Yet to me he is as a crocodile or a
toad."</p>

<p>Now I laughed and answered,</p>

<p>"Then say him nay and have done."</p>

<p>"Aye, that I will, Ramose, but cannot you understand that
there are others behind him, and that to me they are
all&mdash;crocodiles and toads?"</p>

<p>"Then say them all nay, Myra, and remain as you are. Do you
think that I wish to force you into marriage?"</p>

<p>"No, Ramose. If I did I should kill you, or rather I should
kill myself. Swear to me that you will protect me against
marriage, and against all men; unless you desire to see me
dead."</p>

<p>"Aye, Myra, with my life if need be. Yet yours is a strange
mood for one who is young and beautiful."</p>

<p>"Then let it be strange, but so it is. You have sworn and it
is enough, for when did you ever break your word, O most beloved
Ramose? Now I would ask something else of you, but having
received so great a gift, this is not the time."</p>

<p>"What would you ask, Myra?"</p>

<p>"Oh! that we might go out of this fine house to that cottage
near the river, you and I and old Belus, and be rid of all these
great folk, the women in their silks and perfumes, and the lords
in their chariots or on their prancing horses, with their mincing
talk and false eyes, and there, with Belus, look upon the stars
and hear his Babylonian wisdom and his tales of the past, and his
prophecies of things to come, and be quite at peace, forgetting
and forgotten by the world."</p>

<p>"I will think of it," I answered, "but my lady mother would be
angry."</p>

<p>"Your lady mother is always angry&mdash;with me. But you are
not angry, Ramose, and you have promised to protect me from those
men. So what does it matter? Good night, Ramose. I told your lady
mother, who has made a liar of me, that I was ailing and sought
my bed, so thither I must go. Good night, good night, dearest
Ramose," and she lifted her fact that I might kiss it, then
kissed me back and fled away.</p>

<p>I think it was at this moment that first I began to understand
that I loved Myra, not as a father loves his child, but
otherwise. Oh! if only I had told her so and taken her then, how
many terrors should we have missed!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap9"></a>CHAPTER 9<br>

PHARAOH COMES TO MEMPHIS</h2>

<p class="first">
ON the morning following my meeting with Myra in the garden, I
was awakened early by a servant who said that the head overseer
of my farm desired to see me at once. I commanded that he should
be brought to my chamber. There the man, who was so moved that he
could scarcely stand still, told me that a prodigy had happened
during the night, namely that one of the finest of my cows had
borne a splendid calf, in giving birth to which it died. Here he
stopped as though overcome, and I answered that I grieved at the
death of this cow, but that the news of it might have waited, nor
did I see that there was any prodigy about the matter.</p>

<p>"Lord, that is not all," he went on in an awed voice, "the
calf, which is male, seems to have upon it every mark of the holy
Apis bull, or so says a priest of the temple who chanced to spend
the night with me, and has seen it. Indeed already he has
returned to Memphis to tell all the other priests the glad and
wonderful news which by to-morrow or the next day will be known
throughout Egypt."</p>

<p>Now I bethought me that I wished that priest had slept
anywhere save in my overseer's house, for something warned me
that this beast, in which I had no faith, having sought a higher
worship than that of animals, whatever god the vulgar might
believe them to incarnate, would bring trouble upon me. But as
such heresies must be hidden, I asked him what the calf was like.
He replied that it was black as ebony with a square spot of white
upon its forehead and the figure of a white hawk with
outstretched wings upon its back. Also on its pink
tongue&mdash;wonder of wonders&mdash;was the figure of a
scarabaeus in black.</p>

<p>Now I affected to be much surprised and said that I would come
to see this holy calf, which in my heart I hoped, being so holy,
would soon follow its dam to the underworld, or be gored to death
of its foster-mother. But this was not to happen, for whenever it
took milk the legs of that cow were tied together until it became
accustomed to the changeling; also its horns were held.</p>

<p>Presently I met Belus and noting that he looked weary, asked
him how he fared.</p>

<p>"Not too well," he answered. "Last night I consulted the
stars, especially those that rule the destinies of us three, and
until the dawn I have been at work upon their message."</p>

<p>"What was it?" I asked idly.</p>

<p>"This, Ramose: That because of some prodigy, trouble awaits
us. Those stars enter an evil combination that foreshadows danger
to all of us&mdash; great danger. Yet be not cast down, for in
the end they emerge from this house of perils, or so my
calculations tell me, and ride on into that good fortune which
will endure until the end."</p>

<p>Now, though it is true that some of his prophecies seemed to
have fulfilled themselves, perhaps because these came, not from
stars, but from out of the hidden wisdom of his own soul, I did
not believe overmuch in the divinations of Belus, I who always
held that the great planets, sweeping ever on their eternal
journey through the skies, could scarcely trouble themselves with
the petty fate of men and women, or even influence them. Yet I
was disturbed when he spoke of a prodigy, for suddenly I
remembered the birth of this Apis calf and my own fears. So I
told Belus what had chanced yonder at the farm while he watched
the heavens.</p>

<p>Now it was his turn to be startled, for he answered,</p>

<p>"I put little faith in Apis, who is but a priest-made symbol.
Yet, Ramose, all the Egyptians think otherwise, for to them he is
a god incarnate upon earth in the flesh of a bull."</p>

<p>"Then may this god soon be disincarnate in heaven or
elsewhere," I exclaimed, which was not to happen, for, as I have
said, the brute lived and throve like any common calf.</p>

<p>When we had eaten Belus and I, Myra also for she would not be
left behind, whether because she wished to behold this wonder or
for other reasons, mounted our asses and rode to the farm to look
upon the new-born calf. As soon as we were clear of the city I
beheld a strange sight, for the road was black with people all
talking and gesticulating, who, too, were travelling to behold
the new god, or the place where it had appeared.</p>

<p>Avoiding these as much as might be, we came at length to the
farm where a great crowd was gathered, who were being thrust back
by priests and soldiers from the shed in which the calf lay.
These people recognised me, and one cried out,</p>

<p>"Behold Ramose, the blessed of Heaven, upon whose beast the
spirit of the gods has fallen in lightning. Behold Ramose and his
beautiful daughter," (for the most of them believed Myra to be my
daughter).</p>

<p>Another answered,</p>

<p>"Aye, behold him, Pharaoh's seed who one day may himself be
Pharaoh."</p>

<p>"Aye," called yet another, "for otherwise how comes it that
Apis is born in his house? It is a sign! It is a sign!"</p>

<p>So these fools clamoured till I wished that the earth would
open and swallow them; yes, and Apis too.</p>

<p>After this we were admitted to the shed and saw the calf,
which, save for its markings, was as are other calves. But the
markings were there, and not painted, and when it opened its
mouth to bellow, we perceived the black scarabaeus upon its
tongue. Moreover round the shed were priests of Ptah upon their
knees, praying and making oblations of flowers.</p>

<p>Myra wished to go in and stroke the beast, but one of these
priests sprang up and dragged her back with threatening looks,
muttering that it was not lawful for a woman to enter there, and
that if she had escaped a curse she would be fortunate.</p>

<p>So we went home as quickly as we could, and afterwards these
priests removed the calf whither I knew not, without so much as
paying me its price, to keep it until such time as it should take
the place of the old Apis, which was so near to death that its
sarcophagus was already fashioned and in its niche at the
burying-place of bulls some leagues away.</p>

<p>When my mother heard the news she was much rejoiced.</p>

<p>"When I learned that you had become a farmer, my son," she
said, "it grieved me more even than when you told me that you had
been a merchant, for both these trades are those of common people
and unworthy of your blood, which on one side is that of kings
and on the other that of warriors. Yet now I see that in all
these matters Zeus, or Athene, has directed you, seeing that out
of the trade you have won much wealth, while through the
husbandry it has come about that the great god of the Egyptians
has manifested himself in your house, so that because of this you
and I, your mother, will grow famous throughout Egypt."</p>

<p>Thus spoke my mother who since she had left Pharaoh's
household, where for a while she was a great power, had never
been able to fit herself into the narrow bounds of private life,
which, although she was rich, were all that remained to her after
the death of her husband, the judge and officer, Tapert.
Continually she looked back to the pomp and ceremony of Pharaoh's
court, the martial guards, the blowing of trumpets, the heralds,
the golden furnitures, the thrones and the garments woven with
the royal symbols. Yes, and in her heart she dreamed and hoped
that a day would come when through me once more she would move
amidst all this glory, no longer as the mistress of the king, but
as his mother.</p>

<p>It was for this reason, amongst others I have set out, that
she desired to separate me from Myra, hoping that if once she
were gone I might find a wife, however ancient or ill-favoured,
in whom ran some drops of the true blood of the Pharaohs of
Egypt. Therefore she set herself to make known far and wide the
sign of favour which the gods of Egypt had given me in the birth
of an Apis among my herd, and, as I learned afterwards, even
wrote or sent messages to old friends of hers about the court,
who had been servants of Apries, to tell them what had come to
pass and to vaunt my wealth and favour among the people.</p>

<p>Soon all this reached the ears of Amasis who now was Pharaoh,
and caused him to think that it would be well if he journeyed to
Memphis to make an offering to the new Apis, or rather to the
temple in which the beast was being reared and to the priests who
guarded it; also to make sure who the man might be that was
spoken of as a king's son and concerning whom the soothsayers
made prophecies. For Amasis never forgot that he was a usurper
who had won his throne by force of arms and had put his old
master, the rightful Pharaoh, to death, or allowed him to be
slain. Therefore he was afraid of any one who could claim that
the true royal blood ran in his veins and, knowing this, I had
not presented myself to him on my return to Egypt.</p>

<p>So in the end Amasis the Pharaoh came to Memphis, sailing up
Nile with royal pomp and ceremony, and was received in state by
the nobles, officers and people of the great city.</p>

<p>I was amongst those who watched him land, and noted that he
was much changed from Amasis the general under whom I had served
and who had saved my life from the anger of Apries years ago. For
time, the cares of state and as some said, the love of wine, had
whitened his hair and carved deep lines upon his rugged face,
though still his eyes were pleasant, if now somewhat shifty and
fear-haunted, as those of usurpers who have won their thrones
through blood must ever be. Putting aside all ceremony, as of old
he greeted us in his bluff, soldier fashion, speaking to us, not
as a master or a god, but as an Egyptian to Egyptians, and
calling us "Friends," and "Brothers," saying too how glad he was
again to visit Memphis after many years and to meet its lords and
people.</p>

<p>Then he mounted in a chariot and was conducted to the old
palace of the Pharaohs that had hastily been made ready to
receive him. Here, later, he held a court, at which we of the
Council of the City were made known to him, one by one. When my
turn came, for I thought it best to appear before him boldly, and
he heard my name, he glanced at me sharply, also at Belus who
followed me, and started.</p>

<p>"Surely, Count Ramose, and you, Belus the Physician, we have
met before," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Pharaoh," I answered, "though long years have passed
since then."</p>

<p>"Is it true, Count Ramose, that Apis has appeared among your
herds?" he asked.</p>

<p>I answered it was true that I had been so honoured of the
gods.</p>

<p>Again he looked at me as though he would search my heart, and
inquired where I lived.</p>

<p>I told him that being unwed I had made my home in the house of
my mother, the widow of the King's Companion, Tapert, who once
was governor of Memphis.</p>

<p>"Is it so, Count?" he said. "Then at sunset Pharaoh will visit
you there without ceremony, and perhaps the lady your mother and
you will give him a bite of food and a cup of wine, also without
ceremony, asking none to meet him save those of the
household."</p>

<p>I bowed, muttering that the honour was too great, whereon he
waved me and Belus aside and began to talk to others.</p>

<p>As soon as we might I escaped from that court with Belus, and
returned home in my chariot which I drove myself, Belus riding
with me. At the door I sprang out and called to the running
footmen to lead away the horses.</p>

<p>"Belus," I said, "I am troubled. Why does Pharaoh wish to
visit me thus?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, Ramose," he answered, looking down. "Perhaps
to talk about Apis, or perhaps to speak with us of what happened
when we were younger and the wars of long ago when he was but a
general, for they say that although his memory has grown weak,
those days are still dear to him. Who can tell? We shall learn in
time."</p>

<p>"Yes, Belus, and I pray that it may not be more than we wish
to know."</p>

<p>Then I went in to tell my mother what had chanced. She heard
and broke into rejoicings which vexed me.</p>

<p>"Pharaoh coming to this house!" she said. "Truly the honour is
great. Every high lady in Memphis will envy me. I must make
ready."</p>

<p>"You forget, Mother," I said, "that he who comes killed him
who was my father and your lord."</p>

<p>"My lord, yes, who soon wearied of me&mdash;one light love
among many &mdash;and gave me in marriage to another man. And
your father, yes, who sought to put you to death for small cause,
from which end you were saved by this Amasis, wherefore I forgive
him all. Moreover, it is said that he had naught to do with the
slaying of Apries whom the Egyptians killed without his
knowledge. But I must be gone; the time is short, the time is
very short and there is much to make ready," and turning, she
fled away.</p>

<p>Such is woman, thought I to myself. One comes who seized the
throne of her lord and her son's father and brought him to his
end. Yet because he is Pharaoh she rejoices as though she were
about to be visited by a god&mdash; and Belus who had been
watching, nodded his head and smiled as though he read what was
passing in my mind, which no doubt he did.</p>

<p>Then I retired to my own chamber and stayed there for the rest
of that day, discussing problems with Belus, or reading
histories, for the house was in a tumult, and when I sought her
to continue our studies, even Myra was not to be found.</p>

<p>Servants flew here and there, messengers went out and returned
laden with goods in baskets, the cooks gathered to themselves
other cooks and worked at their business as though their lives
hung on it, the steward of the household ran to and fro cursing
at all he met by the names of evil gods, the butler drew ancient
wines from the cellars and tasted them until his eye grew dim and
his voice thick, gardeners brought in plants and flowers that
they had grown or purchased, and set them about the rooms. All of
these things I saw through my window-place, or the half-drawn
curtains of my doorway, and grew more and more vexed and
troubled. At length when I was no longer able to bear the noise
and confusion and the sound of my mother's voice grown shrill and
angry as she scolded the servants, telling them first one thing
and then another, I fled away to that large upper chamber of the
house where Belus slept and worked.</p>

<p>Here I found him calm as ever, studying a map he had made upon
a papyrus sheet, of the stars, or of certain of them, and turning
balls hung upon wires round a larger ball, which he said figured
the sun and the planets.</p>

<p>"You seem disturbed, Ramose," he said as he checked the motion
of these swinging balls.</p>

<p>"And you seem calm," I answered angrily.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ramose, because I study the stars which are very far
away and very quiet, while you study the earth, which is very
near, and to-day more noisy than is common. If you wish for
quiet, fix your heart upon the stars and leave the earth
alone."</p>

<p>"And what do your stars tell you, Belus?"</p>

<p>"Much that as yet I have found no time to interpret fully, but
above all this&mdash;that soon you and I will make a long
journey. I believe it is one which I have awaited many years," he
added slowly and in a cold voice.</p>

<p>"Over the edge of the world?" I asked, staring at him.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not yet, I think, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the chamberlain rushed into the room and from below I
heard my mother's voice,</p>

<p>"My lord!" he said, "my lord Count, the lady Chloe says that
you must attire yourself in your best, not forgetting to put on
the gold chain that the late good god who was Pharaoh, gave to
you, and all your other marks of rank."</p>

<p>"The late good god!" I muttered. "The late good god whose
throat was cut by butchers in a boat upon the Nile."</p>

<p>"But who afterwards was embalmed in the best fashion, wrapped
in gold, and buried with great glory and all his household wealth
by the present good god, which should console him for his many
woes," interrupted Belus mockingly.</p>

<p>Then my mother's voice rose shrilly from the foot of the
stairs, calling to the chamberlain who fled, as presently I did
also to do her bidding and array myself. But as I went I
said,</p>

<p>"Belus, hearken. Search out another house for you and me and
Myra, for here I can dwell no more. And let it be far away."</p>

<p>"I do not think there is any need," answered Belus. "I think
that we should not dwell there long because the stars have
appointed one for us that is very far away. Still I will do your
bidding."</p>

<p>As the sun began to set I went to the portico of the house,
followed by Belus who was clad in the robes of a physician and
wore the cap of an astrologer. Scarcely were we come there when
the sound of chariot wheels and of trampling horses told us that
Pharaoh was at hand. Then he appeared surrounded by a mounted
guard. He was arrayed as a general, and wore no emblem of royalty
save a small golden uraeus upon his helm.</p>

<p>Leaping from the chariot he ordered the officer in charge of
the escort to depart with his men, and return at a certain hour.
Then quite unattended he walked up the steps of the portico and
greeted me who stood bowing before him, in his old jovial
fashion. And yet there was something lacking; his voice did not
ring true as once it did; I felt a change.</p>

<p>"See, Ramose, how well I trust you," he said. "Better indeed
than I would most men who might hold that they had a blood
quarrel with me. That is because we are old comrades in war and
therefore there is a bond of fellowship between us. Rise, man,
rise, for here we are not Pharaoh and subject, but two soldiers
met to drink a cup of wine together."</p>

<p>As he spoke my mother appeared, still looking fair enough,
though the wonderful grace and slightness of form which once were
hers had departed from her.</p>

<p>"The lady Chloe!" he cried, catching her hand as she curtseyed
low, and kissing it. "Surely, after all these years I know her
again. Tell me, Lady, have you made a bargain with your own
Aphrodite that defying time, you remain so fair and young, you
whom I used to worship from afar at the court of Sais, wishing,
to speak truth, that for your sake I stood in Pharaoh's
sandals?"</p>

<p>Thus he went on, bantering in his bluff fashion, for never did
Amasis lose his manners of the camp, while my mother reddened to
the brow, muttering I know not what, till of a sudden he ceased
and stared past her.</p>

<p>Turning to discover at what he gazed so fixedly, I saw that
Myra had followed my mother, as no doubt she had been bidden to
do. There she stood uncertain, swaying a little like a palm in
the wind; Myra, yet a new Myra. For she was apparelled, as to my
knowledge she had never been before, in beautiful silken robes,
while round her throat and arms were fine jewels of gold and
gems, with necklets of large pearls, those same priceless
ornaments which were the heritage that her dying mother had given
to me in the tent upon the battlefield. On her brow, too, was a
circlet of gold set with pearls and rising to a point, while
ropes of pearls were twined among the waving tresses of her brown
hair, which was spread like a cloud about her shoulders and
almost to her waist. Most beautiful she looked thus in her young
loveliness, yet most splendid, like to a queen indeed. Never
before did I know how beautiful she was. So it seemed Amasis
thought also, which was why he stared at her, then asked,</p>

<p>"Who is this fair maiden, lady Chloe?"</p>

<p>"Myra," answered my mother, "known as the daughter of my son
Ramose."</p>

<p>"And therefore a granddaughter of Apries and of the royal
blood of Egypt," said Amasis aloud, but as one who thinks to
himself. "Well, she is very fair, so fair that were I a younger
man I think that I should ask her to draw near to the throne of
Egypt, which as it is I shall not do. Worthy of a king, she is.
Yes, worthy of a king!"</p>

<p>Now I bowed purposing to show Amasis that Myra was not my
daughter, and to repeat to him the tale of her finding upon the
battlefield, which doubtless he had forgotten, but as the first
words passed my lips the curtains to the right were drawn and the
chamberlain, appearing between them, cried out that all was
ready.</p>

<p>"Good," said Amasis, "let us eat, for know, I starve, whose
lips have touched nothing all this day of ceremony," and taking
my mother by the hand he led her into the large chamber now
seldom used, where Tapert, her husband, feasted the nobles when
he was a high officer of Memphis.</p>

<p>Here a table was spread, made fair with flowers and cups of
gold and silver, for it had pleased Tapert to collect such
vessels. At the centre of this table was Tapert's chair of state,
a gilded, cushioned seat that my mother had prepared for Amasis.
In it he sat himself while the rest of us stood, behind him.</p>

<p>"What!" he cried, "am I to eat alone like a prisoner in his
cell? Not so. Forget, I pray you, my hosts, that for an hour I
fill Pharaoh's throne, and come, sit at my side and let us be
friendly."</p>

<p>So we placed ourselves at the curved board, my mother on his
right, Myra on his left, and I beyond my mother with Belus beyond
Myra.</p>

<p>The feast began, a wonderful feast, since it seemed to me that
from it was missing no luxury known in Egypt. Indeed, I wondered
much how in a few short hours my mother had made so rich a
preparation.</p>

<p>Amasis was hungry and ate heartily, praising each dish, as
well he might, for he could have tasted no better at his own
table. Also he drank without stint, of the strong old wine of
Cyprus with which Tapert had stored his cellars, and grew
merry.</p>

<p>"Where have you been all these years, Ramose?" he asked. "I
remember that we parted at Pelusium after we had defeated
Evil-Merodach&mdash;ah! that was a battle and one that went the right
way for us. It seems a long while ago, and so it is, for since
then Merodach sat for a little hour upon the throne of
Nebuchadnezzar at Babylon and is gone wherever the Babylonians go
when they are dead, and two more after him, the last of them but
a boy who reigned three months and then I think was murdered. Now
Nabonidus is king there, chosen by the people of Babylon to be
their ruler, they say, because he hates the sight of a sword as
they have come to do."</p>

<p>"What is known of this Nabonidus, Pharaoh?" I asked.</p>

<p>"To me little enough, Ramose, except that by birth he is not
royal&mdash; like some other kings," he added laughing and
pointing to himself.</p>

<p>"May it please Pharaoh, I know something of him," said Belus
speaking for the first time, "for when we both were younger I was
his friend. He comes of a great House that has grown wealthy by
trade. His nature is, or was, kindly and gentle. He was very fond
of learning also and especially of all that has to do with bygone
kings and times, and written records and ancient temples. Lately
I have heard from Babylon where there are still some who write to
me, that he spends his days in studying such matters and in
rebuilding the old shrines of the gods, leaving most of the
business of the State to be dealt with by his son, the Prince
Belshazzar."</p>

<p>"Belshazzar!" exclaimed Amasis. "I have heard much of this
man, more than I wish indeed. What of him, Astrologer? Is he,
too, learned and gentle?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Pharaoh. I knew him also in his youth when he dealt very
wickedly with&mdash;a friend of mine. He is a fierce and cruel
man, ambitious and violent, but one of ability when he can turn
from his pleasures and his wine."</p>

<p>"So I have heard also, and further that being an old fool,
Nabonidus trusts all to him, signing whatever his son Belshazzar
puts before him. Yes, he does this even at a time when Babylon is
threatened by Cyrus the Persian. Therefore through his
councillors and in the name of Nabonidus the King, Belshazzar
seeks an alliance with Egypt upon whom Nebuchadnezzar was wont to
war, as we know. In earnest of it he offers his sister in
marriage to me, and asks that a princess of the royal House of
Egypt should be given to his father Nabonidus who is lately
widowed, that she may be Queen of Babylon and all its empire, and
take with her as a dowry the friendship of Egypt."</p>

<p>Here he paused to drink wine, then added more as though he
were speaking to himself than to us,</p>

<p>"But I have no princess to send to him, and Apries who went
before me, left no daughters save one who is already married, old
and childless, for whom even the ancient Nabonidus would not
thank me."</p>

<p>Then again he paused, looking about him. His eyes fell upon
Myra who was seated by him leaning forward so that she might hear
all.</p>

<p>"Beautiful," he muttered, "most beautiful."</p>

<p>A thought seemed to strike him for he started, then began to
talk to Myra, asking her of her life at Memphis, and whether it
would not please her to shine in a king's court.</p>

<p>"Nay, O Pharaoh," she answered, "I am very happy here where I
follow after learning with Belus for my teacher, and for the rest
occupy myself with simple things."</p>

<p>"What do you learn, maiden?" asked Amasis "The languages of
other lands?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Myra with pride, "I know Greek and the tongues
of Cyprus, that of Babylon also, and can write them all."</p>

<p>"Thoth, god of letters, led by the hand of Hathor and Bes,
gods of love and beauty, must have attended at your birth,
maiden," exclaimed Amasis in the voice of one who had drunk too
much, as leaning forward, he patted her on the hand.</p>

<p>Now I looked at my mother who, fearing some folly on the part
of Pharaoh and understanding that I wished her to be gone, rose
from her seat, bowed and departed, taking Myra with her. Amasis
waited till the curtains had swung to behind them. Then he looked
round the room and seeing that we were alone, for at a sign from
me the servants had left us, of a sudden he seemed to grow sober,
as I remembered he could always do if he wished.</p>

<p>"Ramose," he said, "now that the women have left us I would
have a word with you, which was why I came here. Nay, Belus, do
not go; it is always well to have a water-drinker for a
witness."</p>

<p>I bowed and waited.</p>

<p>"Ramose," he went on, "if I were wise, I think that I should
cause you to be killed."</p>

<p>"That Pharaoh cannot do," I said, "having eaten of my bread.
Yet why should he cause me to be killed whom in the past he saved
from death?"</p>

<p>"Because times have changed and we change with them, Ramose.
Because without doubt you are of the old royal blood of Egypt, if
on one side only, whereas not a drop of it flows in my veins, and
but little in those of my sons, for those wives of mine who are
called royal were made so by decree rather than by birth.
Because, too, this is known among the people who, as my spies
have told me, treat you like a prince and in their private talk
speak of you as one who in a day to come may sit in Pharaoh's
seat. Lastly because an Apis has been born among your cattle
which the vulgar take for a sign, yes, and the priests who are
the real power in Egypt. Certainly therefore it would be wiser
that you should die, or so I think, who desire to be the
forefather of a great dynasty that shall rule for hundreds of
years."</p>

<p>"I am in Pharaoh's hands," I answered coldly. "He has
thousands at his command to do his will, whereas I am
defenceless. If Pharaoh desires to mingle my blood with my wine,
what more is there to say? Let him who slew the father, slay the
son and make an end."</p>

<p>Now, whether by design or because it was so, again suddenly
Amasis seemed to grow drunken and answered,</p>

<p>"Aye, why not? It would save many doubts and troubles. Belus
here will bear witness that we quarrelled and that I killed you
in self-defence," and rising he half-drew the sword which he wore
with his general's armour.</p>

<p>Belus sprang up and slipping behind Amasis, began to talk into
his ear. Although he spoke so low all he said, or the meaning of
it, came to my sense made keen by danger. It went thus:</p>

<p>"Pharaoh forgets that in this quiet place his armies avail him
nothing. Here he can die like other men. Let him look."</p>

<p>Amasis glanced over his shoulder, to see that there was a
knife in the hand of Belus and that its point was very near his
throat.</p>

<p>"If Pharaoh died," went on Belus, "would it not be easy to
hide him away while some went out and declared that he had been
gathered to Osiris and that the gods who had caused Apis to be
born in his house, had appointed Ramose, the son of Apries, to
fill his throne? And if this were done, would not Memphis listen,
and what Memphis says, would not all Egypt say, and would not the
army welcome Ramose with a shout?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," said Amasis, again sobered of a
sudden. "Ramose, know that I do not wish to kill you if only I
can be sure that you will not plot against me. Believe me,
neither did I wish to kill your father. After the army had made
me king, yonder in Cyrenia and against my will, I kept him to
rule with me, but he plotted against me and at last came the end.
They tell me that you are doing likewise, and now Apis has been
born amongst your herds which Egypt will take for a sign. If I
spare you, how can I be certain that you will spare me?"</p>

<p>"Because I have no wish to sit upon any throne, Pharaoh, I who
having enough to satisfy my every want, desire only to lead a
peaceful, learned life. Is it my fault that an Apis is born
amongst my herd?"</p>

<p>"No, Ramose, but it is a sign sent by the gods; at least the
people will so interpret it and therefore you must bear the
blame. For the rest, you may change your mind. I had no wish to
be a king, yet a crown was thrust upon me, which could not have
happened if Apries had killed me first, as, had he been wise, he
would have done. Still as a lad you were ever honest; so, asking
no oaths I believe you, for what are oaths when it comes to
grips? Indeed, what I said was but to try you, so let it be
forgotten. Yet Belus has threatened me with a knife, why then
should he not die, he, the threatener of Pharaoh, who, as any
priest will tell you, is a god&mdash;no less?"</p>

<p>Now Belus, showing no fear, answered boldly,</p>

<p>"I think that I answered that question long ago, Pharaoh, in a
certain general's tent upon the borders of Egypt, before a great
battle against the Babylonians."</p>

<p>"I remember," said Amasis. "You said the stars appointed me to
be king which has come true, though at the time the words seemed
folly," and he looked at him not without awe.</p>

<p>"I said more than that, Pharaoh. As my life seemed to be in
danger then, as it does now, I told you that those stars declared
also that if you killed me, my blood would call for your blood
and that you too would die. I repeat those words, for the stars
do not change their story. If you are weary of life and rule,
strive to bring death upon me who never harmed you."</p>

<p>Amasis stared at him and his ruddy face grew pale.</p>

<p>"I think that you have power, Babylonian," he said, "if of a
different sort from mine. Fear nothing. You shall go safe from
me, and your master also, so long as he does not try to plot
against me, or to take my place."</p>

<p>"Pharaoh is very wise," answered Belus in the same cold voice,
"so wise that I will tell him something that I wished to keep
secret. Already by his threats he has earned much evil at the
hand of fate."</p>

<p>"What evil, man?"</p>

<p>"This&mdash;that though he live out his life in peace and
splendour, yet it shall not be so with him who comes after, the
son of his body. Storm-clouds are gathering in the east, O
Pharaoh."</p>

<p>"Have done, Babylonian," broke in Amasis. "I would hear no
more of your evil-opened talk. Our pact is made&mdash;it is
enough."</p>

<p>"As Pharaoh pleases," said Belus bowing, while with quick eyes
he searched his face.</p>

<p>Then Amasis turned to me and asked,</p>

<p>"What happened to you after we parted years ago, Ramose? I
remember that you went away with a little child about whom you
told some idle tale, but who in truth was your daughter, that
same maiden who dwells with you to-day."</p>

<p>"She was not my daughter, Pharaoh&mdash;"</p>

<p>Thus I began, but he stopped me with a wave of his hand and
his rough, soldier's laugh, saying,</p>

<p>"Oh! deny it not, Ramose. Have we not all heard of you and
that beautiful Syrian queen, a very flower of love whose favour
you had the luck to win as a lad, though you brought her none?
Did not the whole camp believe that the child was your daughter
born of this queen or another woman perchance, whom you carried
with you from Egypt to save her from the Syrians, and is she not
proclaimed here as your daughter by your own mother and all in
Memphis, yes, your daughter and the grandchild of Apries, as
indeed may be read in her royal air? So anger me no more with
your denials, as though I were a priest to whom you must plead
purity, for I will not listen to them, who hate liars. Tell me,
what chanced to you after you escaped from the wrath of Apries
your father?"</p>

<p>Then thinking it wiser not to cross his wild, uncertain mood,
which I set down to the wine that he had drunk, over this matter,
small as I held it, I told Amasis how I had journeyed to Cyprus
and made my home there and grown rich by trade.</p>

<p>"And why did you not stay in Cyprus, Ramose?" he asked
suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Because I desired to see my mother from whom I had been
parted for many years, and being Egyptian born, to dwell in Egypt
where I believed that now I should be safe as Pharaoh's friend.
Also Belus warned me that disaster was about to fall upon the
city where we dwelt, which indeed happened, for after I had left
it, Salamis was shaken to the ground by earthquake and those who
dwelt in the house that had been mine, were crushed."</p>

<p>"Belus again!" exclaimed Amasis. "By the gods I would take him
for my soothsayer, were I not sure that of me he would always
prophesy more ill than good, and being a physician also, could
bring it to pass, if so he chose. Therefore I leave you Belus,
praying you to guard him well, who swears, or so I understand,
that his death and mine will not be far apart. To tell the truth
I have no fancy to see Osiris out of his wrappings before I must,
or to chat with Apries and others at his table. No, no, keep
Belus and live at ease, Ramose, even if your cows bear an Apis
once a year, and be sure of Pharaoh's favour and all that he can
give you, so long as you leave Pharaoh in peace. And now that we
have settled these matters, let us drink a last cup together in
pledge of them, Ramose, of whom I purpose to make a viceroy in
Kush or elsewhere, or perchance to send upon an embassy. For you
are one who should be great in war and council, and not spend
your life in breeding beasts and growing grain, like any mud-born
thickhead who calls himself a noble and to prove it, flogs his
slaves; yes, one who should serve Pharaoh and prop up his throne,
to his vantage and your own."</p>

<p>Then having drunk, as Belus and I pretended to do also, he set
down his cup and walked with us, somewhat unsteadily, to the
chamber where my mother sat. Here at the doorway he bade Belus
and myself discover whether his escort was in attendance, and if
not, to wait till it came and then advise him, who meanwhile
would talk with my mother and bid her farewell.</p>

<p>So we went because we must, for in such matters Pharaoh must
not be disobeyed, and for a long while tarried in the porch. At
length the escort came, and with it the chariot of Pharaoh.</p>

<p>We returned to make report. The curtains were drawn over the
entrance of my mother's sitting chamber. Thrusting them apart I
saw her seated on a couch with Amasis at her side. He was leaning
forward talking into her ear, while from time to time she nodded
her head, as though in ascent. Perceiving me between the curtains
she laid her fingers on her lips, as though to teach him silence,
then rose, calling to me to enter. I did so and bowing to
Pharaoh, told him that his guard and chariot waited on his
pleasure.</p>

<p>"So much the worse," he grumbled, "seeing that now after some
happy hours in the fellowship of old comrades and fair ladies,
like an ox harnessed to a water-mill I must get me to my work
again. See, now what it is. There is the matter of the repair or
rebuilding of these temples of Memphis to be considered, for it
must be done cost what it may, to please the priests &mdash;I
mean the gods with whom no Pharaoh dare be out of favour. I am
minded to put you in charge of that business, Ramose, because
having been a merchant as well as a learned man and a lover of
what is beautiful, you would save me from being cheated by
roguish architects and craftsmen. Next I must up Nile to Abydos
to tend the ruined shrines of Osiris, and thence to Thebes on a
like errand; also to make offerings at the sepulchres of the
ancient kings, though where their mummies may be to-day none
knows, for thieves have been at work with all of them. Then back
here again, perchance to bury Apis that they say is dying, with
fitting pomp yonder in the desert where those gods lie. After
that away to Sais to deal with matters of state and to face the
eternal Babylonian trouble, to say nothing of that of the
Persians, as best I can, as well as the quarrels of the women of
my own household which will pursue me, as I think, to the
underworld.</p>

<p>"Oh! who would be a Pharaoh? Ramose, be guided by me, I pray
you, and never seek to be a Pharaoh, even should a mother urge it
in your ears, though, this I am sure the lady Chloe, being wise,
would never do. Now farewell to all of you, and not least, my
hostess, to that fair grandchild of yours, Ramose's daughter,
whose beauty, were it seen, would set the world aflame and lift
her to a throne. Farewell, my hosts, and farewell, too, Belus,
shepherd of the stars, or by them shepherded&mdash;I know not
which. Belus the far-sighted, to whom the gods unveil and who
handles wisdom as a soldier does his knife,&mdash;or rather who
handles both wisdom&mdash;and a knife. Farewell, all. Ho! slaves,
summon the officers to conduct Pharaoh to his chariot."</p>

<p>Thus Amasis came, and thus, bewildering us and hiding his
purposes with this long, rambling speech, as dust obscures a
chariot, he went from my mother's house at Memphis. When he had
staggered down the steps and departed, Belus and I looked at each
other, saying nothing. Then I turned to seek my mother, but she
too had gone.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap10"></a>CHAPTER 10<br>

THE HAPPY HOUSE</h2>

<p class="first">
WITH pomp and ceremony Pharaoh Amasis departed up Nile to
Thebes. Yet ere he went he laid various offices on me as one
marked for his especial favour; high offices not to be refused,
to fill which I must take public oaths, swearing by the gods to
be faithful to him and his House under pain of death and the
curse of heaven. Also he appointed me as overseer of the
architects employed upon the rebuilding of sundry temples, and
especially of the great shrine of Ptah in Memphis.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that soon I must work from dawn till dark
as never I had worked before, scarcely finding leisure to eat,
much less to read with Myra or even to talk with her, of whom now
I saw but little. When I met my mother, however, which was not
often for I was out before she rose, and for the most part
returned only after she had sought her bed, I noted a change in
her. She seemed to be full of mystery and to follow more than
ever after foolish pomps, seating herself in a chair that was
like to a throne, with servants who held fans standing behind
her, and even wearing marks of royalty when there were no
strangers there to see, such as a circlet of gold upon her head
from which rose the uraeus snake.</p>

<p>The sight of this angered me, so much that at last I asked her
sharply what it meant and if she wished to bring trouble on me,
by aping a rank that was not hers.</p>

<p>"Not so," she answered smiling. "Yet may not she who has borne
a son to him who was Pharaoh bear the mark of royalty, that is,
when she has special leave so to do, from him who is
Pharaoh?"</p>

<p>"I do not know what you mean, my mother, but I do know that if
this were the law, there would be many women in Egypt wearing the
royal uraeus," I answered bluntly, adding, "I pray you therefore
to lay that ornament aside lest my head should pay the price of
what you set upon your own."</p>

<p>Then growing angry, she rose and left me as one who might
answer but who would not, nor did she appear again before me
adorned like Pharaoh's queen or daughter. Indeed I saw her but
seldom and when we met she would rarely speak to me.</p>

<p>On a certain feast day, that appointed to some god when none
laboured, Belus said,</p>

<p>"You bade me buy you a house and I have done so out of your
moneys in my hands," (for I trusted all my wealth to Belus).
"Also with the help of Myra I have furnished it. Come now, and
look upon your new home."</p>

<p>"Does my mother know of this?" I asked astonished.</p>

<p>"I have not told her," he answered. "Yet I think she guesses.
At least she said to me but yesterday that perhaps it was as well
that you should live apart because you no longer agreed together;
moreover she held it that it would be more fitting to your new
dignities that you should have a dwelling of your own."</p>

<p>So I went to see this new abode and found it very beautiful.
It was an old palace outside the great wall of the city, and
therefore surrounded by a large garden, of which, because of the
narrow space, there were few within the wall. In the ancient days
when the Pharaohs lived at Memphis, this palace, it was said, had
been that of the heir of the king. In later times, however, it
had become a private dwelling, also a home of priests; but now
for a generation, save for caretakers, it had been deserted
though still used as a store-house so that the roof and walls
were saved from decay. Further, the gardens had been hired to a
husbandman who grew in them fruit and vegetables for sale in the
city, also beneath the palm trees green barley for fodder.</p>

<p>Now all this had passed by purchase to me and already Belus,
having all my revenues at his command, had set numbers of the
best artificers and artists in Memphis to work to make the place
beautiful, and once more a fitting home for a great noble or a
prince. Moreover Myra was in the secret and throwing her heart
into the business, laboured joyously that our new home&mdash;for
never for a moment did she doubt that it would be hers as well as
mine &mdash;should be made even fairer than that at Salamis, one
of the most perfect indeed in all Egypt.</p>

<p>To this end all the furnishings which I had brought from
Cyprus, the statues, the inlaid and enamelled chests, the chairs
and beds, the vessels of gold and silver, and I know not what
besides, which for years it had been my pleasure to collect as
the choicest wares and examples of ancient art from Syria, Cyprus
and Egypt, were gathered from the places where they had been
stored because my mother's house would not contain them. Here and
there Myra said they should stand, even before the rooms were
ready to receive them, so that they must be covered up with
cloths for fear of damage by the artists and the plasterers.</p>

<p>Also through Belus, who was foolish where she was concerned
and, like her old nurse, Metep, unable to withstand her smallest
fancy, Myra bought in Memphis the loveliest that it had to sell
of hangings and carpets and couches and silver swinging lamps,
all of which she set about the chambers, especially in those that
were to be allotted to me. Yet when I entered her own I found it
with bare walls and but plainly furnished; a low bed of white
wood, some stools and chairs with feet shaped like to those of
antelopes, also of white wood and hide-seated, and three chests
to hold her garments, painted with scenes of wild-fowl
disporting themselves among lotus plants, or rushing in alarm
through papyrus reeds.</p>

<p>"How is this?" I asked. "My chamber is as that of Pharaoh,
while yours might be the sleeping-place of the daughter of a
village sheik."</p>

<p>"Because I would have it so," she answered, tossing her head.
"Moreover in time to come the walls shall be painted, when I have
finished the design and Belus can find an artist who is not a
fool."</p>

<p>"I have found one," said Belus.</p>

<p>"Who is that artist?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yourself," Belus answered, laughing drily, then turned and
fled before she could scold him.</p>

<p>Indeed I was the only one who did not laugh over all this
business when in the end I found that it had cost me the quarter
of my fortune, no less.</p>

<p>"What does it matter?" said Belus in reply to my complaining.
"What does anything matter, especially when there is plenty left
which gathers day by day; that is, if it pleases Myra?"</p>

<p>"You are right," I said, "nothing matters if it pleases Myra.
Now she will have little left for which to wish."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure," said Belus, and went away before I could
ask him what he meant.</p>

<p>At length we took up our abode in this fine new home, although
as yet it was far from finished. My mother came to view it, borne
in a chair such as was used by a wife of Pharaoh when she went
abroad, and when she discovered that all had been planned by
Myra, found much fault with every thing, saying that I should
have done better to be guided by her own purer Grecian
tastes.</p>

<p>"Still," she added, "the place is fine and the furnishings and
decorations are of small account, for when your daughter Myra
leaves it to become the consort of some mighty man, they can be
changed."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you, my mother," I answered. "Myra does
not wish to change her state; also, she is not my daughter."</p>

<p>"Then, Ramose, if she is not your daughter, why is she not
your wife? Surely you would make nothing less of her."</p>

<p>Having shot this bitter arrow, she went away without waiting
for an answer.</p>

<p>"What does she mean?" I asked of Belus, who had heard these
words.</p>

<p>"What she says, or so I think. Hearken, Ramose. There is some
plot afoot. I know not what it is, but it has to do with Myra. If
you would keep her at your side, Ramose, let it be as your wife.
Remember that your mother is right. If you give it out that she
is not your daughter and she continues to dwell in your house
with no other woman save an old nurse, although you forget it
because she has lived with you from a babe, you will cast a slur
upon her name."</p>

<p>Now hearing this I was much disturbed.</p>

<p>"Are you mad, Belus?" I asked. "Have we three not always lived
together? And for the rest, is it fitting that I who am almost
old enough to be her father and who for years have forsworn
women, should wed this young maid?"</p>

<p>"Would it then grieve you so much to take her was a wife,
Ramose?" asked Belus in his quiet fashion.</p>

<p>Now I felt the blood come to my face, as I answered,</p>

<p>"It would not grieve me at all; to tell the truth it would
delight me more than anything on earth. It was not of myself that
I thought, but of the poor child who, if I spoke to her of
marriage with me, would take it as a command and obey because she
held it to be her duty, for that reason abandoning all hope of a
husband of her own years."</p>

<p>"I thought that not so long ago she might have pleased herself
in this matter, and would not, Ramose."</p>

<p>"It is true, but because a woman turns from one man it does
not follow that she turns from all. After all that count was an
empty-headed coxcomb; there are better than he in Memphis."</p>

<p>"It is a strange thing, Ramose, that those who are wise in
nine matters, are often foolish in the tenth, and those whose
sight is so keen that it can note a lizard on a housetop, often
cannot discern the pitfall that yawns before their feet, or the
sharp stone that will lame them. Such, I hold, is your case,
Ramose. Now I pray you, if you have any faith in what you call my
foresight and my vision, put this matter to the proof and show me
that I am wrong."</p>

<p>"How, Belus?"</p>

<p>"By asking Myra whether or not it would please her to become
your wife. Ask her, and soon. To-morrow Pharaoh returns from
Thebes to bury the Apis that is dead, and then passes on at once
to Sais."</p>

<p>"What has that to do with Myra and myself?" I asked angrily,
because, to tell the truth, I knew that Belus never spoke without
reason. Words that from another would signify little or nothing,
on his lips were full of meaning.</p>

<p>"More than you think, perhaps, Ramose," he replied,
adding,</p>

<p>"Do you promise to prove that I am wrong, if you can, not next
year, or next moon, but this very day?"</p>

<p>"Yes. That is, how can I who must go at once to attend to
matters in the city that cannot be postponed?"</p>

<p>"You return to supper, I believe, and after supper it is
customary for Myra and you to read together. Do you promise?"</p>

<p>"To please you I promise, though I do not know why you should
force me to give Myra pain and to bring shame upon myself."</p>

<p>"Perhaps ere long you will find out. However you have promised
and it is enough, for when did you ever break your word,
Ramose?"</p>

<p>Then he went, leaving me wondering where I had heard those
words before. Ah! it came back to me&mdash;from the lips of Myra
herself after that boastful fop had asked her in marriage, and
she had made me swear that I would protect her from all men. How
came it then that these two spoke as with one voice? Had they
agreed together to ply me with the same flattery? Nay, that was
not in the nature of either of them; they did but say what they
believed. They had set me, a man full of weakness and of
failings, like a statue upon a pylon or a pyramid, one to be
admired as higher than others; one to be loved more than others.
This I could understand in the case of Belus who with all his
learning and gifts from heaven was but a fond philosopher who,
being childless and with few friends in his exile, had cherished
me from my boyhood.</p>

<p>But what of Myra who knew all my faults and follies and must
suffer from my moods? Could it be that there was something in her
heart which caused her to forgive these many imperfections and to
gild my clay with the gold of love? I did not know, but as I had
promised Belus, I would discover the truth before I slept that
night. Oh! if it should prove that this sweetest of all maidens
loved me, not as a child loves her father, but as a woman loves a
man, then how blessed would be my lot. Nay, it was too much to
hope and I must be on my guard; I must watch lest her kind heart,
duty and a desire to please, should put on the mask of love.</p>

<p>I went about my business which was very urgent, for much must
be made ready before Pharaoh returned upon the morrow, asking
account of my labours under his royal commission. All day I
worked in the heat of the sun, much vexed with those that had
failed me and with the foolishness of a self-willed architect,
and at last as it sank, wearied out, was borne to my new
home.</p>

<p>Here I bathed and clad myself in clean garments of linen. Then
led by a servant I went to the eating-chamber, a very fine room
where once the royal princes of old Egypt had banqueted with
their friends and women, that now cleaned and repaired, we used
for the first time. This apartment, of which the walls were
painted with scenes of feasting and of gay sports, somewhat faded
perhaps, seeing that the artist who limned them had been dead for
hundreds upon hundreds of years, opened on to a gallery that
looked over the gardens and the intervening lands down upon the
distant Nile. From this gallery or portico the room was separated
by painted columns formed of heads of Hathor, goddess of love,
between which columns hung rich curtains that the furnishers had
placed there only that day, those that Pharaoh's sons had used
having rotted many generations gone.</p>

<p>In the centre of this beautiful room, illumined by hanging
lamps that we had brought with us from Cyprus, Myra had set a
table of black wood inlaid with electrum, and on it cups of gold
and silver taken from my store, and alabaster vases filled with
flowers. Here at this fair table I ate my first meal in that
house, Belus sitting at one side of it and I at its head. At its
foot, in the place of the Lady of the House, was Myra who in
honour of this event had been pleased to array herself in her
richest garments and ornaments, such as she had worn at the feast
my mother had given to Pharaoh. Thus with the lamplight falling
on her she looked beautiful indeed, I think the most beautiful
woman that ever I saw, except perhaps Atyra whose loveliness was
of a richer order and more matured. It was strange to see that
this Atyra's memory should rise up and refuse to leave me on that
night when I did not desire its fellowship. Yet it was so; had
her spirit been standing at my side, like the Double watching in
a tomb, she could not have been more present.</p>

<p>Myra was in her merriest mood. She laughed and talked and
jested, till at length I asked what made her so joyous.</p>

<p>"Oh! many things, Ramose," she answered, "but chiefly because
to-night I am like a slave whose fetters have been struck off and
whose lord has granted her freedom."</p>

<p>"When did you wear fetters, Myra?"</p>

<p>"Till yesterday, Ramose, yonder in your mother's house, where,
though you knew it not, I was always watched. Here I am
free&mdash;free! Belus, first of prophets, be kind. Use your
skill, Belus, and tell me my fortune. Here is water into which
you may gaze; without are stars&mdash;that is, unless the moon
has devoured them; here is my hand covered with a hundred tiny
lines. Gaze into the water, read the stars and the birth-writings
stamped upon my flesh, and tell me my fortune. Tell me that I
shall have many years of joy in this place. Do you know what was
its ancient name? I have discovered it from an old man who works
in the garden who had it from his grandfather. It was called the
Happy House in the byegone days when it was the home of princes
and great lords. Tell me that it will be the Happy House for me
and for Ramose and for you too, dear Belus."</p>

<p>Now Belus shook his head, saying that his arts were needless
because her words had already fulfilled her wish. Still she would
not let him be, but went on teasing him till at length he
said,</p>

<p>"Give me that little lily you wear upon your breast, O foolish
maid, who cannot be content with the hour and its joys."</p>

<p>She obeyed. He took the fair white lily, warm from her bosom,
and cast it into a bowl of rich-hued glass that was filled with
water for the dipping of hands when the meals were done, muttered
some words that I could not understand, and breathed upon it;
after which he watched it for a long while. Now, growing uneasy
for I shrank from this jest who doubted whether Belus could play
the conjurer even when he tried, he who was filled with so
strange and true a wisdom, I rose and looked over his shoulder
into the bowl.</p>

<p>There was the lily floating, but as I watched it seemed to
lose its shape as though it had been grasped and crumpled; its
whiteness also. The water, too, though this may have been fancy
or because of the colour of the red Eastern glass, to my sight
grew first to the hue of wine, and then to that of blood, so that
suddenly I remembered the blood of murdered Atyra that lay
beneath the robe upon the floor of her chamber at Sais, and
shivered.</p>

<p>I glanced at the face of Belus and noted that it was not that
of one who played a trick to please a girl. Nay, it was strained
and anxious and on his brow appeared beads of sudden sweat. I was
about to speak, or overthrow the bowl, but divining it although I
stood behind him, he held up a finger and checked me. For a
minute or more he went on watching, covering the most of the bowl
with his hands, so that I could no longer see within it. Then his
face changed and once more became quiet and impenetrable, also he
sighed, a sigh of relief, such as is uttered when a great danger
has passed by ourselves or one we love.</p>

<p>Removing his hands from the edge of the bowl, he said,</p>

<p>"Look."</p>

<p>I did so and behold! there floated the little lily as white as
it had been when it was gathered, in water as pure as when it was
drawn from the well. He took the flower and gave it back to Myra,
saying,</p>

<p>"Press it in a book, child, and cherish it all your life; nay,
set it between two plates of crystal as a talisman."</p>

<p>"Oh! my lily," she cried, "how fair you are and how sweet you
smell; although so small your fragrance perfumes the room.
Ramose, you shall make me a present. You shall order the jeweller
to enclose this little lily in a tiny shrine of crystal, hung
upon a golden chain, such as I can always wear. That is, you
shall do this to-morrow, to-night I will keep it for myself. But
I forget! What did my magic flower tell you, Belus? Nay, do not
shake your head. Speak, I command you, and truly. In the name of
the Truth we worship, speak truly."</p>

<p>"Being thus adjured, it seems that I must obey," said Belus
slowly. "Your magic lily told me that your wish will be fulfilled
and that in this abode which is named the Happy House you will
spend many years of such joy as is given to those who wander upon
earth."</p>

<p>She clapped her hands rejoicing.</p>

<p>"Those are good words," she laughed; "those are most fortunate
words."</p>

<p>"Yes, Myra, they are good and fortunate, wherefore forget them
not when good fortune seems far away. You have not heard the end
of them, Myra, which since you commanded me to speak all the
truth, I must declare to you. Between this night of joy and those
years of joy to come lies a space of fear and black doubt, such
as crushes the hearts of mortals. Steel yourself to bear them,
Myra, as others must who love you, as I did but now when I saw
the white lily blacken in the cup and the water on which it
floated turn to a pool of blood. Remember always, even when hope
seems gone, that the lily will once more grow white and fragrant,
and the water once more be pure."</p>

<p>"I will remember," she answered quietly and very gravely, who
suddenly understood that this was no child's game, but something
that the strength of Belus had wrung out of the clenched hand of
Fate, something she could not understand, and perhaps that he
himself did not altogether understand.</p>

<p>Belus rose and went; the servants came and did their office
swiftly enough who were well trained, having been with me in
Cyprus, leaving us alone.</p>

<p>"The place is hot," I said, "nor can we go to the chamber
chosen for our studies, for it is not prepared, all is in
confusion there. Come, Myra, let us sit without and watch the
moon rise up on the Nile."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, and led the way between the curtains to the
portico or colonnade that was built along that front of the old
palace which faced towards the Nile. Here were ancient marble
seats and on one of these, that nearest to the corner of the
house where a wall was built across the roofed-in colonnade, we
sat ourselves down in the shadow.</p>

<p>"What did Belus mean, Ramose?" she asked, awaking from her
silence. "Do you believe in these prophecies of his?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure, Myra. Sometimes I believe and sometimes I do
not. Certainly some of them seem to have come true; but this may
be by chance, for a wise physician who watches all things and has
great knowledge of the hearts of men, cannot always read the
future wrong, whether or not the stars reveal it to him. At least
this last oracle of his is one of good omen, so let us accept it
and be content."</p>

<p>"I am content, Ramose, now that we three are alone together as
we were in Cyprus. Yonder I was not, for it seemed to me there,
in your mother's house, I was like a bird in a cage or one about
whom a net was being drawn."</p>

<p>"Why should my mother wish to play the spider to you?" I asked
disturbed.</p>

<p>"I do not know, Ramose. Perhaps because she is jealous of me;
perhaps because she wishes to use me who am called your
daughter&mdash;always of late she speaks of me as your daughter
when there are any to listen, as she did to Pharaoh&mdash;to
advance your fortunes and her own. I say I do not know, but
believe me, so it was; also that at the last she would have
prevented me from coming here, aye and might have done so had it
not been for Metep who outwitted her, how I will not tell you now
for the tale is long. It is enough that to-night at last I am
free and once more with you and Belus as we were at Salamis. Yet
I pray you, Ramose, set a guard about this house that free I may
remain, and near to you."</p>

<p>"Do you then desire always to remain near to me, Myra?"</p>

<p>"Aye, Ramose."</p>

<p>"You know that you are not my daughter, Myra, and indeed no
kin of mine, whatever my mother or others may say."</p>

<p>"Aye, Ramose, I know it."</p>

<p>"Do you know, also, Myra, that it is hard for a man to dwell
with such a one as you are who is not his daughter, and not to
wish that she were even more than his daughter? Yes, that it is
very hard, though it may chance that in years he might almost be
her father?"</p>

<p>Myra sat up upon the seat, gripping the edge of it with her
hands and glancing at me sideways, which things I could see in
the twilight.</p>

<p>"Why is it hard? What do you mean, Ramose?" she asked in a low
voice.</p>

<p>As she spoke the great moon appeared from a bank of cloud, her
rays making a path of silver across the broad waters of the Nile
and the cultivated land, flooding the pillared portico and
striking upon the beautiful girl who sat at my side, her beast
heaving, her lips parted. I gazed at her and of a sudden passion
took hold of me. Yes, passion in its strength, and I knew that
above all earthly things I desired her no longer as a daughter
and a friend, but as my wife; yes, to be all my own.</p>

<p>"I mean, Myra," I answered, "I mean that I love you."</p>

<p>"This you have always done, Ramose."</p>

<p>"Aye, but now I love you in another fashion. Do you not
understand?"</p>

<p>"I think I understand, Ramose."</p>

<p>"I suppose that it has been so for long, Myra. But to be plain
I have been ashamed to tell you so, who was a man grown when you
were but a babe. I have feared, Myra, lest if I did, you should
hold it to be your duty to give yourself to me, not because of
the hunger of your heart, but because it was I who asked it of
you, to me, a man whose hair begins to grow grey upon his
temples."</p>

<p>She smiled a little; the moonlight showed it; a somewhat
mysterious smile such as is to be seen upon the carven faces of
sphinxes, which told of secret thoughts hidden behind her
eyes.</p>

<p>"You who are so wise, in some ways were ever foolish, Ramose,"
she answered and once more was silent, words that left me
wondering, though in substance they did but repeat what Belus had
said that morning.</p>

<p>Thrice I tried to speak, and thrice I failed, while still she
watched me with that dreaming smile upon her face. At last in
poor, bald syllables the common question broke from my lips.</p>

<p>"Myra, though I have seen some eight and thirty summers, can
you love me as your husband?"</p>

<p>Very slowly she turned her head and now I saw that her cheeks
glowed and that her wonderful dark eyes swam with tears. She
strove to answer and in turn, failed. Then she took another road,
sinking upon my heart and lifting her lips towards my own.</p>

<p>It was done. My arms were about her, her head rested on my
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh! Ramose," she sobbed, "for all these years since I became
woman, how could you be so blind?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap11"></a>CHAPTER 11<br>

THE BURIAL OF APIS</h2>

<p class="first">
OF the rest of what passed between Myra and myself upon that
night of joy nothing need be told. By degrees, stripped of all
the trappings with which we mortals veil the truth, our love
stood revealed in perfect beauty. It seemed that ever since she
had come to womanhood Myra had desired to be to me all that woman
can to man, and yet had so hid her secret that I guessed it not.
It seemed, too, that as she loved me, so I had loved her and yet
had buried that love beneath a hill of forms and self-deceiving
falsehoods, pretending that I looked upon her only as a daughter
and a ward given to me of heaven. But now the screens were down
and behind them, pure and beautiful, appeared the naked
truth.</p>

<p>At last we parted, but not before it was agreed between us
that we would be wed at once; on the morrow if it might be,
though this was doubtful, because for such a marriage formalities
were needed, especially in the case of a man like myself upon
whom many eyes were set, a man in whose veins royal blood was
known to run. Moreover she who was to be my bride had been
commonly reputed to be my daughter and as to this the truth must
be registered by all of us before certain public officers, and in
particular by myself, by Belus and by the old nurse, Metep, which
matters would take time.</p>

<p>In truth they took longer than I thought, for stir as I would
in the business three days went by before all was completed,
because those who had to deal with them deemed it necessary to
obtain the seal of a certain officer acknowledging that Myra was
my ward, which officer was absent from Memphis.</p>

<p>I have named that night of betrothal and revelation a night of
joy; yet it was not altogether so for the reason that nothing can
be quite perfect on the earth. At length all was finished. We had
told our tales, our last kiss was given and Myra had glided away
to her chamber, turning again and again to look upon me. I stood
alone in the portico leaning against a column and gazing upon the
glory of the full moon shining over Nile. Of what did it remind
me? Suddenly I remembered. It reminded me of just such a night as
this when, long years ago, I and another woman seated amid ruined
columns, had looked upon the moon shining over Nile and beneath
her beams had kissed and clung. A shadow passed before me and to
my strained sense almost it seemed as though it were the wraith
of Atyra considering me with reproachful eyes.</p>

<p>If so, why should she reproach me who for all these years
because of her had stood apart from woman, she who drew me into
trouble when I was but a lad, and perished through the fierce
jealousy of her ministers?</p>

<p>Oh! this was foolishness, yet the folly wore a cloak of fear.
What if the new love told beneath the moon looking down on Nile,
should also end in blood and terror, as did the old love told
beneath the moon looking down on that same Nile? Nay, Belus had
prophesied that it would not be so, and I put faith in Belus. Yet
there the shadow moved, not beyond the columns, but in my heart,
a shadow shaped of memories.</p>

<p>The forms were filled, the priest-lawyer from the temple of
Thoth had written the marriage contract whereunder I settled the
half of all I had on Myra, everything was prepared and Myra had
left me. As she had no parents or other relatives from whom I
could come to claim her as a bride, according to custom in case
of maidens of high birth, she had been conducted with her woman,
Metep the old nurse, to the temple of Hathor where she would
spend the night in the care of priestesses. Here it was agreed, I
must present myself at sunrise upon the following morning to name
her my wife before the altar of Hathor and in the presence of the
servants of the goddess.</p>

<p>She parted from me somewhat disturbed, reminding me that since
she was an infant she had never slept away from the shelter of my
roof, save when we were together upon a ship or in my mother's
house, which was also my own, and that it seemed to her an evil
thing that she should do so now.</p>

<p>I laughed away her fears, answering that on the morrow she
would return and that thenceforward we should be together until
death.</p>

<p>When Myra had gone I bethought me that I must ask my mother to
be present at our marriage. Indeed it had been my wish to speak
to her of this matter before, but when I said as much to Myra,
she prayed me not to do so in such an earnest fashion that I let
the business be. For the same reason I dismissed the thought
which had come to me that instead of sleeping at the temple of
Hathor, Myra should pass the night before our marriage at my
mother's house. Yet now when she had gone to the temple in charge
of the priestesses, to that house I went, knowing that it would
seem strange if my mother were not present at the ceremony, also
that she would be angry if she were not asked and think that Myra
had wished to affront her.</p>

<p>Coming to the house, I entered, for the door was open, and
went straight to the large chamber where my mother always sat. It
was empty, nor could I find her in any other room. Thinking that
she must be in the garden, I set out to search for her there, and
on my way met an old woman who had been her servant for many
years, from the time indeed when she dwelt at the court of
Pharaoh Apries, my father.</p>

<p>"Where is the lady Chloe and where is everybody?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! my lord Ramose," she answered, "I do not know where they
are now, but some days ago the lady Chloe and the most of the
household went away up Nile in a big boat, or perhaps they went
in two boats."</p>

<p>"Up Nile! When, and what for?"</p>

<p>"I can't quite remember when, lord Ramose, for now that I am
old my memory grows weak, but it may have been two days, or
three; no, I think that it was four. As to why they went I am not
certain, but it must have been for a great reason because they
were all so finely dressed, the lady Chloe, my mistress, in
beautiful clothes, such as she used to wear at the court of Sais;
also the jewels and chains that Pharaoh Apries gave to her. Oh!
she looked fine, lord Ramose, so fine that it rejoiced my heart
to see her and made me think of the good days when she was the
loveliest lady of the court and Pharaoh used to kiss her hand;
yes, and her lips also."</p>

<p>"Have done," I said angrily. "Why did my mother go up Nile?
Tell me, old fool, or it shall be the worse for you."</p>

<p>"Be not wrath, lord," she said, shrinking from me as though
she feared that I might strike her. "I am but a slave who must do
the bidding of my mistress and keep her secrets, lest it should
be the worse for me."</p>

<p>"Nay, woman, you must do my bidding. The truth now, or you go
to those who know how to wring it from you."</p>

<p>"Lord," she said in a great fright, "I will tell all I know;
it is but little. Two mornings ago the lady Chloe and her
servants sailed up Nile to meet Pharaoh who had summoned her and
sent barges to convey her to him. Why she went to meet Pharaoh, I
could not tell you, though you were to beat me with rods till I
died."</p>

<p>When I saw that she knew no more, I left her and sought out
other servants of my mother's on whom I wasted much time in
useless questionings, for these seemed to know even less than did
the old woman. So at last, weary and perplexed, I returned home
and finding Belus, told him all I had learned, asking him if he
could understand its meaning.</p>

<p>"It seems plain," he answered. "Your mother has gone to meet
Pharaoh by appointment and to discuss certain private matters,
but what these may be is known to the gods alone."</p>

<p>"Still, can you guess them, Belus?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can guess that they have to do with Myra. Remember,
Ramose, that it still pleases both your mother and Pharaoh to
talk of Myra as your daughter."</p>

<p>"If so, what of it?"</p>

<p>"Only this: that then she is one who can be given in
marriage."</p>

<p>"Not so, Belus; at least if she were my daughter I alone could
give her in marriage."</p>

<p>"Pharaoh is the father of all and can give any in marriage to
whom he will," answered Belus darkly.</p>

<p>Then he thought a while and added, "Save those who are already
married, as Myra will be to-morrow. I would that it had been
to-day, or better still a year gone, so that she held an infant in
her arms. In this matter, Ramose, you have been too slow and lost
time cannot be found again. Still, fret not, for to-morrow all
will be righted."</p>

<p>Then upon some pretext or other he left me, as I felt sure
because he did not wish to talk more of this matter. Often since
that day I have wondered how much Belus knew or guessed of the
calamity that overhung us.</p>

<p>I slept but ill that night, for the shadow of this unknown
calamity lay dark upon my soul. Evil dreams came to me, in many
shapes, yet the purport of each was the same&mdash;namely that I
woke to find myself quite alone in the world. To and fro I walked
in a desolate valley, stopping now and again to call on the name
of Myra for whom I sought, but always from the cliffs which shut
that valley in, echo repeated&mdash;Myra, Myra, Myra&mdash;and
that was all.</p>

<p>Before the dawn I rose and dressed myself finely for the
marriage. Then, accompanied by Belus and two running footmen, I
entered my chariot and drove to the temple of Hathor. Leaving the
chariot at the gate in charge of the footmen, we were admitted by
priests who waited to lead us to the inner shrine. Here we stood
a while, till presently we heard the sound of singing. Then from
a side chapel appeared priestesses, eight or ten of them,
accompanied by choristers and musicians who played upon harps and
other instruments. In the centre of this throng, a veil thrown
over her head and carrying flowers in her hand, was Myra, at the
sight of whom my heart leapt.</p>

<p>She came, she stood at my side. The high-priest asked certain
questions. Then at his bidding I took her hand and set upon her
finger a piece of golden ring-money in token that I endowed her
with my goods, announcing also that I took her to be my wife, as
she too announced that she took me to be her husband. This done
the high-priest blessed us in the name of Hathor and other gods,
while a priestess was sent to the top of the temple pylon to call
out to the heavens that we were wed.</p>

<p>Now all was finished and Metep, her old nurse, led Myra to the
door of the sanctuary there to await my coming. I stayed a while
to thank the priests and priestesses, and the musicians, also to
direct Belus to double the customary fees, and make a special
offering to the temple.</p>

<p>These things he did, taking the weighed gold from a bag which
he had brought with him, slowly enough, as I thought. Then the
treasurer of the temple, an aged, formal fool, must needs detain
us while he re-weighed the gold and wrote an acknowledgement of
my gift upon sheepskin.</p>

<p>At last when all was done, we parted from the priests with
farewells and bowings and hurried to join Myra. At the gateway of
the temple we found her waiting with Metep. She greeted me with a
sweet smile, for now her veil was gone and she wore a long cloak
over her bridal robes.</p>

<p>Yet there was that on her face which caused me to ask if aught
were amiss.</p>

<p>"Nothing, husband," she said, hesitating at the word. "Yet,
let us depart, for I see officers of Pharaoh's guard waiting
beyond the outer gates and the doorkeeper has told Metep that
they seek you."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" I said. "I have had much business with
Pharaoh of late and doubtless he would learn something of me,
though indeed I did not know that he had returned to
Memphis."</p>

<p>So Myra and I entered the chariot, Belus walking by its side,
and crossed the courtyard to the pylon gates which were opened
for us. On the further side of them we were stopped by an officer
of Pharaoh's guard, a man whom I knew. He saluted, saying,</p>

<p>"Well found, Count Ramose! I sought you at your home and was
told that you were gone with your daughter to worship in the
temple of Hathor at this early hour&mdash;" here he glanced at
Myra who had hidden her face in her hood, and smiled.</p>

<p>I was about to answer that Myra was not my daughter, but my
wife, when he stopped me, waving his hand.</p>

<p>"Your pardon, Count, but my errand permits of no delay.
Pharaoh has returned to Memphis and being much pressed for time
because of business that awaits him at Sais, has gone on at once
to attend the ceremony of the burial of the Apis god at the tomb
of the bulls, three leagues away, whence he departs this very
night for Sais. Meanwhile he must see you and the learned Belus
also, to hear your report concerning the works in your charge at
Memphis, to give you certain instructions, and to consult with
you upon other matters. I have horses here upon which you can
mount, both of you."</p>

<p>"But I cannot come," I said angrily. "I have business that
keeps me here."</p>

<p>Now that officer from some hiding-place about his person drew
a gold ring and held it before my eyes.</p>

<p>"You are learned, Count Ramose," he said, "and can read the
old Egyptian writing. Tell me, whose name and title are on this
ring?"</p>

<p>I glanced at it. It was a signet of Amasis, the same, I think,
that he wore himself, for I had noted it upon his hand.</p>

<p>"That of Pharaoh," I answered.</p>

<p>"Yes, Count, and how comes it that I, who am but an officer of
the guard, bear Pharaoh's seal? I will tell you. It has been
given to me to teach you that I speak with Pharaoh's voice. You
must come with me and at once, likewise the learned Belus."</p>

<p>I stared at the man whom I knew to be no liar, and thought a
while. The matter must be great and urgent that caused Pharaoh to
summon me in this fashion. Doubtless he needed my counsel and
that of Belus, upon some high business. Or it might have to do
with the accursed Apis calf which had been born amongst my herd,
that now would take the place of the old bull god they buried
this day in the tomb of bulls. Or it might be something else.</p>

<p>With a pang of fear I remembered certain words which Amasis
had spoken when he was, or feigned to be drunk at my mother's
feast, threatening to make an end of me because in me ran the
true royal blood of Egypt. What if he were decoying me into the
desert purposing that thence I should return no more? A while ago
the risk would not have moved me over much, a man who from year
to year and from day to day strove to prepare himself to leave
the world and enter some unknown house of Life, or if there were
none, to dwell for ever in the abodes of Sleep.</p>

<p>But now, how could I dare it whose new-made bride stood by me
clothed in love and beauty, making death terrible? I would not
go. Surely I could escape from this man and flee with Myra. My
chariot stood yonder drawn by horses as swift as any known in
Egypt. We would leap into it and flee away to hiding-places I
knew of, and thence pass to foreign lands beyond the sea.</p>

<p>Thus seized with panic, the shadow perchance of evils to come,
I thought rapidly, but as I suppose, something of what passed
within my mind wrote itself upon my face. At least that officer
smiled and said,</p>

<p>"Look not at your sword, Count, nor at your chariot. You may
kill me, but my men wait without; or you may flee, but you will
be hunted down. Know that my orders are to bring you to Pharaoh
alive or dead, and Belus the physician with you."</p>

<p>Now Myra, who all this while had been listening intently with
a frozen face, broke in saying,</p>

<p>"Go, Ramose, lest a worse thing befall us. I will await your
return in our home."</p>

<p>"Captain," I said, "we obey the command of Pharaoh, bringing
this lady with us."</p>

<p>"My commands were to escort you and Belus to the presence of
the king, but no other," he answered coldly.</p>

<p>Then Belus spoke for the first time, saying,</p>

<p>"None can fight against fate and what are Pharaoh's orders but
the voice of fate? Also often we must reach our end by long and
crooked paths."</p>

<p>Here he turned to Myra and added, "Be not afraid. That end
will be reached. Remember what I saw some nights gone in the
water of the bowl, and the words which my spirit then set between
my lips, for I think that they are in the way of fulfilment.
Look, the lily which once turned black beneath the spell, now
lies white upon your breast embalmed in crystal. White it shall
remain, Myra, white as your body and your soul. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>"I understand," she answered faintly in a voice that was full
of tears.</p>

<p>I went to her, I kissed her, whispered that we should meet
again unharmed, for God was good and Belus could not lie. Then I
bade Metep her nurse to lead her to the chariot and bide with her
day and night till I returned. They went and when they were gone
I accompanied the officer like a man in a swoon, seeing nothing
but the last glance of mingled love and fear that Myra gave me as
the chariot vanished behind the temple pylon.</p>

<p>We mounted on horses and surrounded by an escort, rode through
the gardens of Memphis and across the sands beyond, to the great
necropolis where for thousands of years the nobles and gentlefolk
of Egypt had been buried in the consecrated land. Passing through
streets of their holy tombs we came at last to a temple that
stood near to the mouth of the great caverns wherein are hid away
the bones of the Apis bulls, outside of which temple flew the
banner of Pharaoh surrounded by a guard of soldiers. We were led
into this temple where a ceremony was in progress conducted by
the priests of the god Ptah. It was very long, made up of rites
which however gorgeous, to me were but mummeries, ending in a
kind of sacramental feast whereat all of us from Pharaoh down,
must touch with our lips a broth compounded from the flesh of the
dead Apis, the smell of which broth&mdash;for taste it I did
not&mdash;revolted me.</p>

<p>At last this rite was over and I thought that now I should be
able to have speech with Pharaoh and be gone. Not so, however,
for immediately a procession was formed in which a place was
assigned to me as one specially favoured of the gods, because the
new Apis had been found among my cattle. Accompanied by Belus I
marched in it, preceded by Pharaoh, his great officers and the
high-priests of Ptah and of Osiris, and surrounded by singers
with other priests and nobles.</p>

<p>We entered the mouth of a mighty cavern and descended into the
bowels of the earth, marching through stifling heat down lamplit
passages hewn in the solid rock. Passing many walled-up chapels
we came at length to one which was open. Here stood a huge
sarcophagus that contained the mummied bones of the dead Apis.
Now began more ceremonies which to me seemed to be without end,
though what they were I cannot say, because from where I stood in
the passage little could be seen of them; also the horrible heat
of the place overcame me in such fashion that I could take note
of nothing.</p>

<p>When all was finished Pharaoh, weighed down with royal and
priestly robes and ornaments, marched past me, or rather was
carried in a chair looking like a man asleep, and we followed him
as best we might, till at length we struggled from that hole into
the light and once more breathed the blessed air.</p>

<p>Now I asked to be led to the royal presence, but was told that
this was impossible because Pharaoh was resting. Later I was told
that Pharaoh was eating and later still that he was asleep, being
overcome with fatigue and wine. Then we were taken to a pavilion
where food, that I could scarcely touch, was given to us, and
afterwards night having fallen, to a tent where we must sleep.
Here we lay down because there was nothing else to do and guards
who tramped up and down without, made escape impossible. Thus,
tossing to and fro, bewailing my fortune and unable so much as to
close my eyes, did I pass what should have been my bridal night,
racked with doubts and fears and, in my heart, cursing Apis as
never god was cursed before.</p>

<p>The sun rose at length but even then we were not allowed to
leave the tent, why I could not discover. At last came a herald
who told me that Pharaoh had departed long before dawn, almost
alone that he might avoid the heat and dust made by a great
company, and that he bade me and Belus to follow after him.</p>

<p>Then I understood that for some unknown reason I was a
prisoner.</p>

<p>We followed because we must, but it was not until we reached
Sais after long days of journeying, that we were allowed to
overtake Pharaoh. There on the following morning he received us
in a private apartment of the palace, in which it seemed that he
was wont to hide himself away when wearied with matters of the
state, or with quarrels in his household.</p>

<p>We were led to this apartment and at its door I shrank back in
horror, for it was the same in which years before I had seen the
Queen Atyra lying dead upon her couch. Yes, although the
furnishings were different, without doubt it was the same. There
was the spot where her cloak had lain upon the floor hiding the
bloodstain; there was the window-place out of which with the
strength of madness I had cast that murderer, the priest
Ninari.</p>

<p>My heart stood still, my limbs tottered so that I was like to
fall. Why had I been brought to this place of evil omen? Was it a
trick of Pharaoh's who knew what memories it held for me? Or was
I led by the hand of fate that here, where had died the lover of
my youth, I too must give up my breath? My mind reeled; visions
appeared before me. I could have sworn that I saw Atyra in all
her loveliness standing yonder waiting to receive me in her
outstretched arms. Then I heard Belus whispering in my ear,</p>

<p>"Be a man! Out of this chamber once you passed from peril to
freedom and happiness, and so you shall again. Come, Pharaoh
waits us."</p>

<p>I found strength and comfort in these words, qualities that
have ever flowed to me from the strong soul of Belus. My mind
cleared, I was myself again. By the window-place looking out on
the peaceful garden, sat Pharaoh Amasis with a table before him
upon which were writings, a jug of wine with drinking goblets,
and his sword which he had unbuckled, for as usual he wore the
dress of a general. For the rest he seemed to be quite alone,
though doubtless guards and others were waiting within call in
the chamber through which Ninari had entered to wreak his
vengeance.</p>

<p>Pharaoh looked up and saw us.</p>

<p>"Enter, Count, and physician&mdash;or magician&mdash;Belus,"
he cried in his hearty voice. "Enter; be seated without ceremony,
and drink a cup of wine with me, for if I may judge by myself,
you must be thirsty after toiling northwards in the summer
sun."</p>

<p>We bowed and obeyed, seating ourselves upon two stools that
had been placed for us, as I noted at a distance from the table.
Then Pharaoh filled three of the goblets with wine and signed to
Belus to take two of them, while he kept the third and drank a
little from it, as though to show us that the wine was not
poisoned. Yet, as I thought, this told us nothing, seeing that
the venom might have been placed in our cups which after the
Grecian fashion, were made of gold.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "let us drink to better times, for know that
these are bad indeed for Egypt."</p>

<p>So we drank who had no choice, I wondering whether presently I
should feel my vitals twisting in agony. But this did not happen.
Indeed the wine was of the best and heartened me.</p>

<p>"Ramose," went on Pharaoh setting down his cup, "I fear that
you will be angry with me who have dragged you after me upon this
long journey. Well, I did it because I must, who wished to speak
to you privately and to Belus also, after I had returned to Sais
and heard what the tidings were from the lands beyond Egypt. By
all the gods they are dark enough. Cyrus the Persian has
conquered Lydia and threatens Babylon where rules that old fool,
Nabonidus, who thinks of nothing but the repairing of temples and
the statues of ancient gods, which he drags from the cities that
worship them to set them up in Babylon where he can see and prate
about them. Still he is powerful, for there is his son,
Belshazzar, that fierce man, and Babylon is yet mighty and a high
wall built between Cyrus and his Persians and Egypt. Therefore it
is necessary to make a friend of Nabonidus as he desires to make
a friend of us, to which end I have made an offering that I think
will please him."</p>

<p>He paused and Belus, eyeing him sharply, asked,</p>

<p>"Will Pharaoh be so gracious as to tell us what offering he
has made?"</p>

<p>"Let the matter be," said Amasis waving his hand. "In this
high business it is scarcely worth mentioning further than to say
that dotards like Nabonidus are pleased with trifles. Now I turn
to a bigger business, that of Cyrus who it may be in the end will
conquer Babylon and become a mighty monarch whom Egypt must fear,
lest he should seek to seize her also. Therefore it is necessary
that I should learn the mind of this Persian. Do you not
understand that it is most necessary, Ramose?" he added, staring
at me.</p>

<p>I bowed, answering that I did.</p>

<p>"I am glad," exclaimed Amasis, "for know that it is my purpose
to send you to the court of Cyrus to make inquiry into all these
matters and report to me?"</p>

<p>"Must I go as your envoy, Pharaoh? Or if not, in what
condition?" I asked, seeking to gain time while I weighed this
command in my mind.</p>

<p>"I think not as my envoy, Ramose, for then Cyrus would suspect
you; also is not Ramose too well known as one of the royal blood
of Egypt openly to play this part? Nay, under some false name you
might travel as a great merchant trafficking between Cyprus and
Egypt, as indeed you have been, to make complaint to Cyrus of
losses that you have sustained through the conquest of Cyprus by
Egypt, and to sound his mind as to its seizure by the Persians
after the conquest of Babylon; yes, and that of Egypt also. But
all this would be for his secret ear. Publicly you would pretend
that you were sent by me, Pharaoh, to open trade between Egypt
and Persian, or rather by my vizier from whom you would hold
letters of commendation which you must use to cover your secret
plottings against Egypt. Thus Cyrus may be led into revealing
secrets which having learned, you will return and tell to me. Do
you understand, Ramose?"</p>

<p>"I understand," I said, "who am no fool, but one acquainted
with the languages and the trade customs of the East. Yet pardon
me, Pharaoh. For my own private reasons I do not wish to
undertake this mission. Least of all do I wish to do so, not as
an ambassador but in the guise of a spy."</p>

<p>Pharaoh rose from his chair and stared at me.</p>

<p>"Count Ramose," he said, "you told me just now that you are no
fool, but I begin to think that in this you are mistaken, who do
not seem to know when you have received an order, or what is the
penalty of defying the command of Pharaoh. I hear that you have
bought a beautiful palace in Memphis, one which in the old days
was inhabited by princes of the royal blood. Do you wish to dwell
in it, Ramose, after a certain mission has been accomplished, or
would you choose to remain here and sleep at Sais&mdash;till the
day of resurrection?"</p>

<p>Now understanding that I must submit or die, I made obeisance
and said,</p>

<p>"Pharaoh's will is mine. What Pharaoh commands, that I do. But
first I ask leave to travel to Memphis to settle my affairs and
to bid farewell to my mother."</p>

<p>"It is granted," said Pharaoh, yawning as though he were weary
of this talk. "For the rest my vizier and officers will instruct
you in your mission and make provision. Remember, Ramose, that if
you serve me well in this matter, after you return there will be
few greater men in Egypt. Yes, you shall sit upon the steps of
the throne."</p>

<p>We reached the door when a thought struck me. I turned and
said,</p>

<p>"And what of Belus, O Pharaoh?"</p>

<p>"I spoke to both of you," answered Amasis, "knowing well that
for these many years you have never been apart, that one of you
completes the other. Also when two go forth upon a mission one
may die and the other live to carry on the work; whereas if but
one goes, all is finished with his passing breath. Farewell."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap12"></a>CHAPTER 12<br>

GONE!</h2>

<p class="first">
TWELVE days had gone by when, travelling in one of Pharaoh's
ships, Belus and I drew near to Memphis which we hoped to reach
that afternoon. For seven of those days we had been detained at
Sais, though we saw Pharaoh no more. Indeed, perhaps that we
might not do so, he quitted the city upon business or pleasure of
his own, but commands reached us to await the visits of his
vizier and other high officers, and from them to receive
instructions with secret letters for Cyrus, the King of the
Persians. Also preparations must be made for a long journey
across the desert to the city of Susa where it was said that
Cyrus dwelt when he rested from his wars.</p>

<p>Now although Belus and I pressed all these matters forward,
they could not be accomplished quickly; almost it seemed to us as
though Pharaoh's officers had orders to hasten slowly, so that
only a little was accomplished each day or sometimes nothing at
all. At length, however, when I was driven almost to madness, we
were allowed to depart for Memphis where it was settled that all
which was necessary should be prepared for our mission. For I
must tell that during those days in Sais in truth though not in
name, we were prisoners, confined to our quarters in the palace
and visited only by the servants of Pharaoh.</p>

<p>But at last we drew near to the great city and within a few
hours I hoped to clasp Myra my bride in my arms. Yet I was
troubled, I knew not why. Dark fears took hold of me, of I knew
not what, nor could I win any comfort from Belus who also seemed
oppressed with gloom or forebodings. The journey which we had
been forced to make to Sais was strange. Why could not Pharaoh
have issued his commands to me here at Memphis, instead of
drawing me after him for so many weary days that he might speak
to me once in his palace at Sais? And why had he asked me nothing
of the work that he had bidden me carry out upon the temple of
Ptah? Were those works but a pretext to keep me where he could
lay his hand upon me?</p>

<p>In the end, when I could contain myself no longer, I put these
and other questions to Belus.</p>

<p>"Ramose," he said, "I cannot answer you. Yet I will tell you
what is in my mind. I think that Pharaoh is afraid of you and for
some reason of his own desires to be rid of you, which is why he
sends you upon this distant and dangerous embassy."</p>

<p>"Then he might have caused me to be killed here in Egypt,
Belus."</p>

<p>"Nay, that he could not do, for you have served with him and
he has eaten your bread. On these matters Amasis may still have
the conscience of a soldier and a guest. Moreover, your blood is
known and if you were murdered, your death would look very evil
and would bring trouble on him. For would it not be said that he
had made away with you because you stood too near the throne? But
on such journeys as that which lies before us many accidents
happen, and if under a false name you died far away from Egypt
who would trouble? Also consider this business. You are to go to
Cyrus and play a double part, pretending to be an envoy from
Egypt loyal to its king, and yet working against Egypt and its
king, because of some private merchant's grudge which has to do
with her conquest of Cyprus. Now when Cyrus discovers this, or it
is revealed to him by other messengers, may he not grow
suspicious and bring you to death or throw you into prison,
especially if he learns that Pharaoh would not grieve if you
returned no more?"</p>

<p>"It is so and I mistrust this embassy," I answered with a
groan.</p>

<p>"Aye, Ramose, it is so. Yet I say to you, have no fear, for I
am sure you will come safely through these troubles, as you have
through others."</p>

<p>"That is good news, Belus. But what of Myra? How can I leave
her at Memphis alone and unprotected?"</p>

<p>"You cannot, Ramose, she must accompany you, disguised if need
be. Once out of Egypt there are other lands where we might
shelter."</p>

<p>I remember no more of this talk, for just then we drew near to
the quay and my burning desire to see Myra caused me to forget
all else.</p>

<p>We landed and hiring a chariot drove swiftly to the Happy
House where surely she would be awaiting me.</p>

<p>Now we were passing its gates and it seemed to me that there
was something strange and unfriendly about the aspect of the
place. There was the roofed and columned terrace where Myra and I
had kissed as lovers, but it was empty. There were the large
doors of sycamore wood, but they were shut, not open as they had
been in the daytime since I owned that house. I knocked on them
and presently heard them being unbolted by someone within. They
opened and there appeared a man, a faithful Cypriote steward who
had served me at Salamis.</p>

<p>"Where is the lady Myra?" I asked. "Bring me to her."</p>

<p>"I cannot, lord," he answered awkwardly, staring at me as
though I were a ghost. "She has gone."</p>

<p>"Gone!" I gasped. "Whither has she gone? Speak, man, or by
Amen I'll make you silent for ever."</p>

<p>"I do not know, lord. On that day when you went out at dawn,
she returned early to the house with the woman Metep, saying that
you had been summoned away and that she awaited you. Towards
midday came the lady Chloe, your mother, and with her a number of
men who wore Pharaoh's badge, also some women very finely
dressed. The lady your mother and the men talked with the lady
Myra apart, but what passed between them I do not know. The end
of it was that she left the house with them, much against her
will, I think, for she was weeping, and was driven away in a
chariot accompanied by Metep. We, your servants, were angry and
disturbed, and would have kept her by force, had she not said
hurriedly that a command had reached her from you that she must
obey your lady mother in all things, and therefore she went,
though she liked the business little and of it could understand
nothing. So she went, lord, and that is all, except that we heard
afterwards that she had departed down Nile in great state upon
one of Pharaoh's ship. No, not quite all, lord, for a lad whom I
do not know, brought a letter which, he said, a woman called
Metep had given him to be delivered to you if you returned to the
house. Here it is," and from his robe he drew out a roll roughly
tied up with a piece of palm fibre.</p>

<p>Like a man in a dreamLike a man in a dream I undid the roll, saw that the writing
within was in Greek and short and quickly penned. It ran thus:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">To Ramose</span>, my husband most beloved,</p>

<p class="letter">I am being taken away down Nile, and as I
understand to some distant country, by Pharaoh's officers. Your
mother swears to me that this is by your wish and for my own
good; also that you await me oversea, but I do not believe her. I
would kill myself, were it not that Belus foretold to me that
whatever troubles overtook me, all would be well at last. Fear
nothing, for know that I will surely die rather than break my
vows to you, because in death we shall meet again. Follow me,
Ramose; the wisdom of Belus will teach you how, and find me, or
my bones. I write this on the ship as we sail. Metep has found a
messenger.</p>

<p class="letter">Farewell, beloved Ramose; there is no time
for more. Farewell.<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Myra</span>.</p>

<p><br>
I finished reading and gave the writing to Belus. Then in a
cold voice that did not sound like my own, I said to the man,</p>

<p>"You are steward here, guard this place well, for it may be
that I shall have to go upon a long journey. You have moneys of
mine in your hands and more will be paid to you by my debtors and
tenants as they fall due. Use them on my behalf. I trust all to
you, but be sure that if you fail me, it shall go ill with
you."</p>

<p>"I will not fail you, lord," he answered, the tears springing
to his eyes, for he was a most honest and faithful man, "but oh!
leave us not alone."</p>

<p>"That I must do for a while," I answered, and went.</p>

<p>"Where to?" said Belus as we entered the chariot which still
stood at the door.</p>

<p>"My mother's house," I replied.</p>

<p>Soon, too soon, we were there.</p>

<p>"Would you not wish to see the lady Chloe alone?" asked Belus,
who, I think, feared what I might say or do.</p>

<p>"No," I answered. "It seems that the lady Chloe cannot be
trusted; therefore it is well that a witness should be
present."</p>

<p>So he came with me unwillingly enough. We found my mother
alone in her large chamber seated in a throne-like chair and very
finely dressed. Indeed, she wore upon her beautiful head the
little circlet of gold from which rose an ornament that might
well have been an uraeus, that mark of royalty which she said
Amasis had given her leave to bear, all of which showed me that
she was expecting a visit from someone, though who it might be I
never learned. Certainly it was not from me.</p>

<p>"Greetings, dear Ramose," she said confusedly. "I did not hope
to see you. I&mdash;I understood that, that you had gone upon a
journey on Pharaoh's business."</p>

<p>As she spoke she came forward as though to embrace me, but
something in my face caused her to change her mind, for she
shrank back and sat herself down again in the chair. I looked at
her for a little while, thinking to myself that her words
revealed that she knew the mind of Amasis as to my mission, which
perhaps she had herself inspired.</p>

<p>"Why do you look at me so strangely?" she faltered.</p>

<p>"Where is my wife?" I asked slowly.</p>

<p>"Your wife! Have you a wife, Ramose? Surely you have not wed
without telling me, your mother?"</p>

<p>"Where is my wife, Myra?" I repeated. "What have you done with
her?"</p>

<p>"Oh! you mean your daughter, Myra, though you call her your
wife in error. Why, as I thought you knew, she has left Egypt to
become a queen. You must be very proud, Ramose, that your
daughter should become a queen, as of course I am."</p>

<p>"Whose queen?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The queen of a very great king, perhaps the greatest in the
world after Pharaoh&mdash;Nabonidus, Lord of Babylon."</p>

<p>"How comes it, Mother, that you have stolen away her whom you
call my daughter, though you know well that she is not my
daughter but my wife, to be forced into marriage with this old
dotard of Babylon? Answer me and swiftly."</p>

<p>"I tell you that I thought you knew, Son. Also it was
Pharaoh's will. The great king Nabonidus has sent one of his
daughters to be wed to Pharaoh, as you will have heard, demanding
in return a royal princess of Egypt to be his wife, the old queen
of Babylon being dead, and Pharaoh wishes to make a close
alliance with Nabonidus, so that Babylon and Egypt may stand
shoulder to shoulder against Cyrus the Persian, should he
threaten either of them."</p>

<p>Now in a flash all became clear to me, for I remembered the
words of Amasis at Sais as to making a gift to Nabonidus, also
how he had eyed Myra at the feast my mother made to him and asked
her if she would not like to shine in a royal court. Lastly I
remembered how my mother had slipped away up Nile to meet Pharaoh
upon secret business. With a wave of my hand I stopped her talk,
saying:</p>

<p>"Hearken while I set out this matter more clearly, I think,
than you can do, Lady. Afterwards you can tell me if I have done
so well. Does it not stand thus? Amasis, wishing to please
Nabonidus and bind Babylon to Egypt, desired to send to him a
royal princess to be his wife or woman. You may remember that he
spoke of it at your table, grieving that there was no such
princess who could be sent. Thereafter you and Amasis made a plot
to rape away Myra, pretending that she was my daughter and that
in her therefore ran some of the royal blood of the Pharaohs,
although you knew well that she was not my daughter."</p>

<p>"I did not know, Ramose. I thought that you&mdash;lied to me
on that matter, wishing to hide some sin of your youth."</p>

<p>"Who as you knew well was not my daughter," I repeated, "for
often I told you so, as you knew that I took her to wife on that
same day when owing to your plottings, Pharaoh dragged me after
him to Sais, so that this woman-theft might be carried out in my
absence."</p>

<p>My mother muttered something and began to wipe her eyes, while
I went on,</p>

<p>"As soon as Belus and I were trapped after the marriage in the
temple of Hathor, you loosed Pharaoh's dogs upon this defenceless
girl, new made a wife; yes, you tore her, whom you hate, away and
set her on Pharaoh's ship alone save for her old nurse."</p>

<p>"I deny it," she cried.</p>

<p>"Deny it if you will, but know that your spies did not watch
her close enough. Here is the story in her own writing," and I
held out the open roll.</p>

<p>Then my mother crouched down upon the seat, her elbows on her
knees, her head upon her hands and listened, hiding her face from
me.</p>

<p>"So she has gone," I said, "she, my wife whom I have reared
from childhood, she whom I love better than all the world, better
than my life, better than my soul; she has gone to become the
plaything of an Eastern king &mdash;nay, to death, for that she
will never be, it is written here," and I tapped the roll. "You
have murdered her, as you, my mother, have murdered me, for be
sure that if I find her dead, swiftly I shall follow after her to
where there is justice, or sleep."</p>

<p>"Spare me, Ramose," my mother cried. "Whatever I did was for
the best, for the glory of this proud girl who will be a
queen&mdash;yes, a queen, and for your sake whom Pharaoh will
advance and indeed already has advanced. Aye, and&mdash;for I
will tell the truth&mdash;because I would be rid of her who has
stolen your love from me. Did she not make you leave my house
that you might live alone with her, and has she not built a high
wall betwixt us over which we cannot climb, so that you, my only
child, whom for years I thought dead, are now lost to me
again?"</p>

<p>"If so," I answered, "in your hatred and vanity you have added
to that wall till now it reaches from earth to heaven. For the
rest, what you did was for your own sake and not for mine. What
Amasis has paid you for this treason I do not know, or wish to
learn. Perchance he has given you high rank such as pertains to
the widows of kings who do not happen to be royal" (here she
started, for this arrow had gone home), "or he has endowed you
with great wealth and many titles. Let that matter be. Whatever
you have gained, learn that you have lost a son. Were you not my
mother, I think that I should kill you. As it is I leave you to
be eaten up with your own shame. I do not curse you, because no
man may curse the flesh that bore him; it is unholy. Nay, I do
but leave you.</p>

<p>"Farewell, my mother, upon whose face I hope never to look
again. When as Pharaoh's concubine you caused me to be born, you
did me wrong though mayhap that was decreed. But when you stole
from me all I love, oh! what a crime was that! Perhaps, blinded
by a greed for pomp and vanities, you do not understand, yet one
day you will. I go to seek her of whom you have robbed me, and to
find her or to die. Whichever it may be, for you already I am
dead. In this life, or any other, we are for ever separate."</p>

<p>I turned to leave her with these awful words, now in my old
age I know how awful, echoing in her ears. Suddenly she seemed to
awake from her lethargy. Rising from her seat she sprang upon me,
she cast her arms about me. Sinking upon her knees she dragged me
down to her. She kissed my garments, she babbled words of remorse
and woe, she called me her babe, her darling. I thrust her from
me and went. At the door I looked round to see her lying
senseless upon the floor. I wonder did ever mother and son bid
farewell in such a fashion and for such a cause, or have ever a
woman's jealousy and love of empty pomp done a more evil work.
Thus we parted, little guessing where we should meet again.</p>

<p>That night in a place where we lodged, for to my own house I
would not return, Belus and I debated long and earnestly as to
what we should do. Already he had been at work and learned
through secret channels that were always open to him, who had
many bound to him by ties I did not understand, that Myra had
gone down Nile and with Metep had left Egypt in charge of that
same splendid embassy of Babylonian lords and ladies who had
brought the daughter or grand-daughter of Nabonidus to be a wife
to Pharaoh. It seemed that no Egyptians went with her for a
reason that could be guessed. Had they done so they might have
talked and given the Babylonians cause to doubt whether Myra were
really a princess of the blood of Pharaoh, though she was
beautiful, wore royal robes and ornaments and had a regal
air.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said to Belus, "but Metep can talk and so can Myra
herself."</p>

<p>"Who would pay heed to a serving-woman whose throat can be cut
if need be?" he asked. "As for Myra, doubtless all these plotters
think that pride and desire of royal place will keep her silent;
also fear lest should she be discovered, she would be put to
death or made a shame of as a lying cheat."</p>

<p>"Yet she will speak, Belus."</p>

<p>"Aye, without doubt she will speak and prove all she says.
Therein lies her peril, or mayhap the peril of Amasis against
whom Nabonidus will be enraged, or the peril of both of
them."</p>

<p>I wrung my hands who saw many pictures in my mind. Myra doing
herself to death rather than be shamed: Myra being butchered or
tortured or cast to soldiers by a furious Eastern despot: Myra
escaping from all but to fall into the hands of Amasis who would
certainly kill her in his rage, if only to hide his fraud. Yes,
and others.</p>

<p>"Truly the gods have set a snare for us," I said.</p>

<p>"That which the gods tie the gods can loose, Ramose. Have
faith, for there is no other crutch upon which to lean. My spirit
is silent; having spoken to me once on that night when the lily
that Myra wore seemed to rot, then grew white again in the water
of the bowl, it speaks no more. Yet then it said that all should
end well. Have faith therefore in my spirit, as I have, lest you
should go mad. Come now, let us make our plans."</p>

<p>Taking such comfort as I could from these high words, I
gathered up my strength that I might think with a clear brain.
For long we talked, seeking light. This was the end of it. There
was but one hope of saving Myra&mdash; to follow her whither she
had gone. That, as it chanced, we could do, having wealth at our
command and holding Pharaoh's commission, though in it I was
spoken of not by name but only as "the bearer of these
letters."</p>

<p>Under this, it is true, we were ordered to proceed to the
court of Cyrus wherever it might be, but Susa, his capital, could
be reached by way of Babylon, though this was not the shortest
road. Therefore, making no complaint to Amasis as to the fate of
Myra, for who can reproach a king and live? and leaving it to
Heaven to avenge that sin upon him, we determined to proceed at
once upon our mission, or so to pretend.</p>

<p>To be short, this we did. In a few days all was made ready. My
wealth was great and we took with us not only a large sum in gold
in addition to that which Pharaoh provided for the costs of the
mission, but also written letters from my agents which would
enable us to obtain money in the cities of the East. For the
rest, discarding an escort we travelled unattended in the
character of merchants desirous of opening up trade with Persia
and other Eastern lands, but having hidden about us letters from
the vizier of Pharaoh to all his agents and officers throughout
the East, commanding these to give us help as it might be needed;
also the secret despatch for Cyrus of which I have spoken,
offering him the friendship of Egypt. Lastly we took other names,
I calling myself Ptahmes, that by which I had been known in
Cyprus, for none guessed that the merchant of Salamis and the
Count Ramose were one man, while Belus once more became Azar, a
buyer of Eastern goods.</p>

<p>Thus armed we started upon our search, determined if we lived
to follow Myra wheresoever she might have gone. The question
was&mdash;whither had she gone? We learned that the Babylonian
embassy to which she had been given over, had departed to
Damascus because it was said that Nabonidus the King was in that
city, making a study of its antiquities and religion, having left
his son Belshazzar to rule in Babylon. So joining a company of
merchants at Pelusium we set out for Damascus.</p>

<p>Here I must tell how I noted at this time that Belus seemed
filled with a strange joy which in such an evil hour I thought
almost unholy.</p>

<p>"How comes it that you are glad, when my heart breaks, Belus?"
I asked of him as we left Pelusium.</p>

<p>"Would you know?" he answered. "Then I will tell you; it is
because that call is come of which I spoke to you in past days.
In Babylon I have an enemy who has wrought me worse wrong than
any that you suffer. Now after many years of waiting God gives
him into my hand; now at length I go to be avenged upon him. I
know not how, I know only that I go to be avenged. Ask me no
more, Ramose."</p>

<p>I looked at him marvelling, and there was that in his eyes
which counselled me to be silent.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap13"></a>CHAPTER 13<br>

BABYLON</h2>

<p class="first">
BEHOLD us at length in Damascus after weeks of weary
travelling delayed by many accidents, and of suspense that ate up
my soul, only to find that Nabonidus had left this city more than
a month before. As secretly as we might we inquired whether a
royal wife from Egypt had been brought to him while he dwelt
there, and by some were told one thing, and by some another. It
seemed certain that an embassy of his, returned from Egypt, had
waited on him in Damascus, for so we were assured by Pharaoh's
agent, a subtle half-bred Syrian, but whether they brought with
them any lady to become one of his household was not certain. At
least on this matter none would speak &mdash;least of all the
agent who, we could see, suspected us notwithstanding our
letters, for the Babylonians and their subject peoples held it a
kind of sacrilege even to talk of women appointed to the king.
Indeed our inquiries, veiled though they were, brought suspicion
on us and after we had left Damascus, disaster.</p>

<p>Now having heard that Nabonidus had departed for Seleucia and
that the embassy which came from Egypt had either accompanied, or
followed him, to Seleucia we determined to go, sending a false
report to Amasis of our reasons for so doing. Yet we never
reached that place, for when we were five days journey from
Damascus, of a sudden our caravan was attacked by men who seemed
to be Arabs. In the darkness before the dawn they rushed upon us
so that resistance was impossible. In the confusion Belus and I
were separated. I was seized, being felled by a blow on the head
as I was about to draw my sword.</p>

<p>"Bind him!" I heard a voice cry in the Babylonian tongue.
"Harm him not, he is the Egyptian spy who pretends to be a
merchant."</p>

<p>So bound I was and lay there among my captors, thankful that
my life had been spared.</p>

<p>The light came and showed the Arabs, if such they were, going
off with their spoil. The merchants with whom we had been
travelling were also departing in a great hurry with what goods
had been left to them. Looking about me I could see no dead,
which caused me to think that the attack had been made either for
plunder only, or for some other hidden purpose. Everywhere I
searched for Belus with my eyes, but could see nothing of him.
Certainly he was not among the fleeing merchants. I was taken to
a tent that had been pitched, led by two men who when they
reached it, threw off their Arab robes and revealed themselves
dressed as Babylonian soldiers. In the tent were officers also of
Babylon, and a man whom from his attire I took to be a scribe or
priest. There, too, was my baggage already being examined, though
not that of Belus, here known as Azar.</p>

<p>The officers bowed to me courteously. Then the chief of them
said in the Accadian tongue,</p>

<p>"You take much wealth with you, traveller," and he pointed to
the bags of gold that they had found.</p>

<p>I answered haltingly in the same language, which I pretended
to speak but ill, that I was a merchant journeying to Iran to buy
goods from the Persians.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied with a grave smile, "we know that you go to
deal with the Persians." Then he nodded to the soldiers who began
to remove my garments.</p>

<p>"It is not needful," I said with dignity, "I admit that I am
more than a merchant. I am also an ambassador from the Pharaoh of
Egypt to Cyrus the great King."</p>

<p>"Indeed," answered the officer. "If that is so, what were you
doing in Damascus making inquiry concerning offerings from
Pharaoh to Nabonidus, king of Babylon? Did Pharaoh, whose
ambassador you say you are, order you to travel to Susa by way of
Damascus and Seleucia? Seeing that Babylon is at war with Persia,
it seems a strange road."</p>

<p>Now I pretended not to understand, whereon the officer said
sternly,</p>

<p>"Will you deliver up your letters to Cyrus, if you have any,
or will you choose to be killed as a spy? Here is the rope from
about your baggage and outside stands a tree that will serve to
hang you on, seeing that according to our law it is not allowed
to shed the blood of an envoy such as you say you are."</p>

<p>Now I thought for a moment. If I refused they would either
hang me at once or take me to Babylon to be tormented, as was the
barbarous fashion of these people. Also they would search my
clothes and belongings piece by piece, and find the letters.
Further, I did not wish to die who sought Myra, and lastly, I had
little scruple in betraying the secrets of Amasis which indeed I
could not hide, who began to believe that Amasis was for the
second time betraying me. So without more ado I told them where
the writings were, since my hands being tied, I could not produce
them&mdash;the letter to Cyrus written in the Persian language
sewn up in my undergarment and the letters to Egyptian agents
cunningly hidden elsewhere, how I will not stay to describe.</p>

<p>"You speak our tongue better than you did at first, Ptahmes
the Egyptian," said the officer as he handed the writings to the
priest or scribe.</p>

<p>This man scanned them swiftly, and said,</p>

<p>"The letters to the agents of Egypt throughout the East are
the same as that which this Ptahmes delivered to Pharaoh's
officer in Damascus which we have seen. The letter to Cyrus the
king seems to be written in a kind of secret script that I cannot
decipher easily. It must go to Babylon with the prisoner who
perhaps may be willing to read it to us himself."</p>

<p>I shook my head, saying,</p>

<p>"I am not able to do so, for I have not studied it; it was
given to me to deliver&mdash;no more. But if you will find my
travelling companion, Azar, who is learned in all these secret
writings, perhaps he can help you."</p>

<p>This I said hoping to discover what had chanced to Belus.</p>

<p>The scribe looked at the officer as though in question and in
obedience to some sign, answered,</p>

<p>"If you mean the Babylonian who was travelling with you, know,
Egyptian, that when he was seized and in danger of his life, by
tokens which we could not doubt, he revealed himself to be one of
high rank among our people although he has been absent for long
from Babylon, a priest and a magician also whom it was not lawful
for us to detain. Therefore we let him go lest he should bring
the curse of Marduk upon us. Whither he went we do not know, but
being a magician perhaps he vanished away."</p>

<p>Now I understood that these people would tell me nothing of
the fate of Belus, but whether this was because they were afraid
of him, or because he had been murdered, I could not guess. So I
remained silent. After this an inventory of all my goods, and
especially of the gold, was made by the scribe, a copy of it
being handed to me. Then my garments were returned to me, but the
gold and the letters were set in a chest which was sealed by the
scribe and by three of the officers, each of whom rolled upon the
clay an engraved cylinder whereon were cut the images of his
gods.</p>

<p>Afterwards my arms were loosed although my feet remained
shackled, and I was given food. When I had eaten a camel was
brought, upon the back of which were fastened two large baskets
of woven willow twigs, hanging down on either side. In one of
these baskets were placed all my goods, and in the other I was
laid, the lid being tied down over me.</p>

<p>Thus I started upon my journey to Babylon, for thither the
officer told me I must be taken to be examined by the king or his
servants who, he added grimly, would know how to find out my true
name and business. Three days did I pass in that basket, being
lifted out of it only at night and to eat food, the most wretched
days, I think, that I can remember.</p>

<p>Not only was I cramped and shaken, but my heart was as sore as
my limbs. Everything had gone wrong. Myra was snatched away;
Belus had vanished, leaving me alone, and, as I was sure and grew
more so hour by hour, Amasis had betrayed me. Oh! now I
understood. He had warned, or ordered his agents to warn the
Babylonians of my mission to Cyrus, and given me letters to carry
which would be certain to make them wrath with me and perhaps
cause them to put me to death as a spy. Moreover I could not
complain, seeing that instead of travelling straight to Susa, I
had followed Myra into Babylonian territory as doubtless he
guessed that I should do, and there was snared. Therefore I must
suffer whatever befell me in silence and had no refuge save to
trust in God. For always I have believed that there is a God who
watches over those who put faith in him, though he be not named
Ammon or Marduk.</p>

<p>On the fourth day of our journey, when I was almost overcome
by the heat in my basket and misery of body and of mind, the
officers took me out of it and set me upon a horse. At first I
thought they did this from friendliness, or perhaps because they
feared lest I should die upon their hands, but, having grown
suspicious of all men, afterwards I came to believe that they had
another motive. They hoped, I thought, that I should try to run
away, when they would be free to kill me, for which reason two
spearmen and two mounted archers always rode on each side of me.
Whether or not this was their purpose I cannot tell, but
certainly I had no mind to fly who knew not where to go. Moreover
I wished to reach Babylon whither, as I gathered from the talk of
the officers, Nabonidus the king had repaired, knowing that if so
Myra would be there also.</p>

<p>At last one day shortly after dawn the walls of the mighty
city arose before us out of the mists of the morning that the sun
drew from its encircling river. Wonderful was the sight, most
wonderful as the light fell upon those towering walls and upon
the huge stepped mound where stood the temples of the gods, and
upon the thousands of houses that stretched around. Never had I
seen such a city. Compared to it Memphis and Thebes were but as
little towns, and at any other time the vision of it would have
rejoiced me who have always loved such prospects. But now when
the officers asked me what I thought of Babylon, I could only
answer that the trapped bird cares nothing for the glories of its
cage, words at which they laughed.</p>

<p>All that day, save for a long halt during the hours of noon,
we travelled slowly towards Babylon through cultivated gardens
where thousands were at work. After these were passed we crossed
the great river in a flat-bottomed boat which held both us and
our horses, for here the baggage camels were left behind, and
with them the brute upon which I had travelled in my basket for
so many weary hours. Then we rode through more gardens till we
came to a mighty gateway in the enormous outer walls that towered
over us like a precipice of bricks. Beyond these was another wall
with another gateway, and here we were delayed for some time till
gorgeously apparelled, black-bearded men whom I supposed to be
servants of the king, arrived to escort us.</p>

<p>These men who stared at me curiously, led us through league
after league of streets crowded with people who hurried to and
fro, taking heed of nothing save the business on which they were
bent. So it went on till darkness fell, through which we were
guided by men with torches. At length in the gloom I saw before
me some vast building upon whose walls and roof burnt cressets of
fire, and guessed that it must be a temple or a palace. In fact
it was the latter, for presently we reached its door, or one of
its doors, where I and all my goods were handed over to a guard
and to certain men whom I took to be palace eunuchs. By these I
was led down many passages to a chamber, not over large but well
furnished with a bed and all that was necessary. Here food and
wine were brought to me by one who locked the door behind him
when he went away, leaving me alone save for the guard whom I
heard pacing the corridor without.</p>

<p>That night passed but ill for me who after the air of the
desert felt stifled in this hot chamber, which was in fact a
prison as I judged by the small window-place barred with rods of
copper and cut high in the wall where it could not be reached.
Also I was very troubled. At length I had come to Babylon but oh!
what had fate in store for me at Babylon?</p>

<p>In the morning more food was brought to me and clean garments,
some of my own taken from my baggage together with a long white
robe of soft material beautifully woven. When I asked the jailer
what it was, he replied curtly that all who appeared in the
presence of the king must wear this robe, but would say no more.
So now I knew that I was to go before the king, which perhaps
meant that after I had been questioned I should be executed as a
spy. Well, if so, soon my sorrows would be done.</p>

<p>A little later the door opened again and with a guard there
appeared a barber who set to work upon my hair, which had grown
long during the journey, curling and scenting it. Next he cut my
beard square in the Babylonian fashion, one that I much disliked
who always wore it pointed. Then he washed me carefully and
trimmed my nails, till at last I asked if I were going to a
feast. The answer was, no, but that all who appeared before the
king must be purified, also that this was a day of festival at
the court when they must be made even purer than usual.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he finished rubbing me with his scented unguents
till I smelt like some perfumed court darling, when a fat eunuch,
richly apparelled, appeared at the head of an escort and having
examined me as though I were a calf being led to sacrifice,
commented that although an Egyptian, I was a fine-looking man
fit to take a lady's fancy, and bade me follow him. This I did
wondering whether some court woman of high degree had chanced to
cast her eyes on me, and groaning at the thought. It was not so,
however, for after passing through many passages and across
courtyards we came to a curious doorway with stone gods or demons
standing on either side, and going up some steps, entered an
enormous pillared hall. All the lower part of this hall was
empty, but at its far end a man sat upon a throne while about
him, though at a distance, were gathered many court officers,
also great princes and nobles, and behind him was a guard of
soldiers.</p>

<p>The eunuch and those with him, even while they were still a
long way off, bent down till they looked like monkeys climbing
along a bough, and thinking it wise, I did the same. Thus we
advanced up the great hall till we came to that part where the
court was gathered. Now I found opportunity to examine the king
who sat upon the throne, for he had taken no heed of our
approach, but was engaged in studying a stone statue set upon a
table near the foot of the throne, and in talking about it
eagerly to a thin, tall, noble-featured and quick-eyed old man
clad in a black robe, whom I took to be a doctor or priest,
though by blood neither Babylonian nor Greek, nor Egyptian.</p>

<p>As for the king himself, he was a little, withered man of
about seventy years of age with sharp, bead-like eyes that
reminded me of those of a mouse, and a wrinkled, but shrewd and
kindly face. He was clad in royal robes and ornaments which I
noted became him very ill and seemed to trouble him, for the
head-dress with the crown on it was twisted all awry and his
golden, jewel-encrusted cloak had slipped from his shoulders;
also the false, ceremonial beard he wore had become detached from
his chin and hung loose round his neck.</p>

<p>"Behold the King of kings and be abased," whispered the eunuch
in my ears, in a voice in which I thought I detected mockery.</p>

<p>"I behold him," I whispered back, and went on bowing.</p>

<p>"I tell you, holy Hebrew," said Nabonidus shrilly, "that you
may be a very good prophet; but you understand nothing about
gods."</p>

<p>"True, O King," answered the black-robed man in a deep and
solemn voice, "I understand one god only. About these idols," and
he looked contemptuously at the stone image on the table, "I know
nothing and care less. Now I would speak to your Majesty of a
pressing and important&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is just where you are mistaken, Prophet Belteshazzar or
Daniel, for that is your real name, is it not?" interrupted the
king petulantly. "These idols, as you call them, are extremely
powerful. Why, I dug up that one there under the foundations of
an ancient temple that I am repairing, and have brought it to
Babylon to add to my collection of the gods of my empire.</p>

<p>"Well, what has happened? The whole province whence it came is
almost in revolt; indeed it threatens to make common cause with
Cyrus the Persian, my enemy, or rather the enemy of Babylon, for
personally we are on quite friendly terms and write to each other
about antiquities. All this, if you please, because I have
brought away the image of a god that none of their forefathers
can have seen for generations, since the tablets buried with it,
written in old Accadian, show that it was set beneath the angle
of the temple, probably in a time of danger at least a thousand
years ago. Yes, although they do not know the name of the god and
have only a tradition that it was buried there in the day of some
forgotten king or other, they are all up in arms because I have
removed it. Yet you speak contemptuously of what you call idols
and want to begin to talk of some other matter, I forget what. It
would be more to the point, Prophet, if your familiar spirit
would tell us the name of this one which I burn to discover."</p>

<p>The prophet called Belteshazzar or Daniel glanced at the stone
image and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Can no one tell me its name?" went on Nabonidus. "What is the
use of a crowd of magicians who know nothing? If it is revealed
to anyone here, upon my royal word he shall not lack a
reward."</p>

<p>Now I who had been studying the statue, was moved to
speak.</p>

<p>"May the king live for ever!" I said. "If it pleases the King
to hear me, I say that this holy image is one of Ptah, a great
god of Egypt; or perhaps of Bes, a Syrian god whose worship in
Egypt began in the time of Amenophis III nearly a thousand years
ago, or even earlier. Without examination I cannot say whether it
be Ptah or Bes. But I know that both of these gods have been sent
from Egypt at one time or another, to work miracles of healing at
the request of the kings and princes of the East."</p>

<p>"Here at last we have one with wisdom," cried Nabonidus,
clapping his hands. "But who is this man? A handsome one enough
as I note, with the eyes and hair of a Greek."</p>

<p>The scribe advanced, bent the knee and whispered in the king's
ear.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Nabonidus, "I remember, that Egyptian spy about
whom we were warned in a letter from&mdash;" and he checked
himself. "Let me think. He purports and represents himself to be
an envoy from our brother the Pharaoh of Egypt to Cyrus the
Persian, our enemy. At least a commission was found on him and
has been deciphered, which says so, though the name of the bearer
is not mentioned, but probably it is forged. Indeed it must be
forged in face of what we learn about the record of the man from
Egypt. Also, if he had really been travelling to Susa, or
wherever that dangerous Cyrus may be living at the moment, he
would not have been found in Damascus, making secret inquiries
about me, journeying not as an ambassador should with an escort,
but disguised as a merchant. Lastly we were told that he is one
of the greatest liars in Egypt, a man who cannot be believed upon
his oath, and half a Greek, as indeed he looks."</p>

<p>Here the king brought his long soliloquy to an end and calling
to a robed man whom from his ornamented head-dress and splendid
broideries, I took to be a councillor or vizier, he said,</p>

<p>"What was it you told me ought to be done with this
captive?"</p>

<p>"Spies are best dead, O King," replied the vizier coldly.</p>

<p>"True. Quite true. He ought to be sent to spy in the land of
the gods where doubtless there is a great deal to find out. Yet
it seems a pity to kill so goodly a fellow who is also no fool,
especially as thanks to the warning, he was caught with his
forged letters before he got away to Cyrus to report what he had
learned in our empire, and therefore has not done us any harm.
No, Vizier, I cannot be troubled to listen again to those
wearisome documents and reports, especially as we have heard all
about this evil-doer from Egypt. Is the Prince Belshazzar here?
Oh! yes, I see he is. Come hither, Son, and give us your opinion.
You are the real ruler of Babylon, are you not, which gives me
leisure to attend to more interesting and important matters," and
he glanced at the stone image on the table. "Therefore you should
bear your share of the burden, such as deciding about executions,
a business that I hate."</p>

<p>As he spoke, from the centre of a group of nobles who stood to
the right of the throne, with whom he had been conversing
carelessly while Nabonidus talked with the prophet about the
image, appeared a splendid figure who wore upon his head
something like a crown. He was middle-aged, for the hair upon his
temples was turning grey, tall and broad, black bearded and eyed,
hook-nosed and cruel-faced, with the thick moist lips of one who
is led by his appetites. He came forward, bowed slightly to the
king and looked me up and down, then full in the face. Our eyes
met and at once I felt that this man was my enemy, one who hated
me at first sight as I hated him, and was destined to work me
evil. Yet I paid him back glance for glance till at length he
turned his head, understanding, as I was sure, that I was no
common fellow whom he could despise, and that if I had spied, it
was for no mean reason.</p>

<p>"As you ask me, O King," he said in a thick, loud voice, "I
agree with the vizier. This knave should be killed at once, or
rather, tortured to death, for doubtless out of his agonies may
come some truth that will be of service and value to us, also his
real name, which for some unknown reason has not been revealed to
us. Had I chanced to fill the judgment seat to-day, as it was
settled that I should, if another matter had not brought you
here, O King, such at least would have been my sentence."</p>

<p>My blood froze at these words, yet in some strange, calm
fashion as though I were considering another's case and not my
own, I was able to take note of all. Thus I saw the face of the
prophet who was called Belteshazzar flush and his lips move as
though he were uttering a prayer; I saw Nabonidus shake his head
uneasily like one who hears counsel that is not to his taste; I
saw the vizier smile in a cold fashion and the officer of the
guard look towards the soldiers as though he were about to order
them to hale me away, while the others glanced at me curiously to
learn how I bore this hammer-blow of fate. Another instant and
the king was speaking,</p>

<p>"You have heard, Egyptian," he said. "The prince yonder, who
is really the judge of such matters, has spoken and it only
remains for me to confirm his doom, as being in the judgment seat
I must do according to the law before it can be carried out, for
here in Babylon even the king is the humble servant of the law.
Have you anything to urge upon your own behalf?"</p>

<p>"A great deal, O King," I answered; "more perhaps than you
would have patience to hear. It is true that I am an envoy to
Cyrus, sent to him upon business by the Pharaoh of Egypt, against
my will, because Amasis wishes to make friends with all the
rulers of the East. But that I am a spy is not true&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Nabonidus held up his hand to silence me.</p>

<p>"Why waste your words," he said, "when you were found spying
on behalf of Cyrus, and bearing forged letters which do not give
your name; when, too, we have been assured from Egypt that you
are the greatest of all liars? If you have nothing more to say I
fear that I must bring this business to an end, as the vizier
reminds me that another of more importance waits which also has
to do with Egypt. So be brief, I pray you."</p>

<p>Now a fury entered into me that struck me dumb so that I could
only answer mockingly,</p>

<p>"Then, O King, I grieve that I shall find no opportunity to
examine yonder image," and I pointed to the statue on the table,
"and to tell your Majesty whether it be that of Ptah or Bes."</p>

<p>"True," said Nabonidus, "and you understand about gods, do you
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, O King. I who am a philosopher and a student, understand
about the gods of Egypt and their attributes; also about those of
the East and those of Persia and of the farther lands beyond, as
I could show you were the time given me."</p>

<p>"Is it so? Peace, Vizier, I know the lady waits. Let her wait.
Am I of an age or taste to be in haste to marry again? Hearken, I
will not be hurried. You need not frown at me, Belshazzar, for I
do not heed you or anyone. I am still King of Babylon, the first
Servant of Heaven with power of life and death. I refuse to
condemn the man called&mdash;what is he called? Oh! Ptahmes, in
this fashion. Take him aside to yonder gallery and keep him
there, treating him well as a learned stranger. When the other
business is finished I will speak with him again. Obey, lest some
of you be shortened by a head. I bid you obey instantly," and he
struck the arm of the throne with his sceptre.</p>

<p>Now his servants who knew well how these sudden furies of the
weak but passionate old king could end if he were thwarted,
namely, in the loss of their own lives or offices, sprang forward
in a great hurry and led me away. We went through swinging doors
and along a passage until we came to a stair hollowed in the
thickness of the brick wall of the palace. Up this stair we
climbed and at length reached a gallery set very high, near to
the lofty roof indeed, and enclosed with a kind of wood lattice
such as is common in Egypt, through which one could see without
being seen.</p>

<p>The eunuch who accompanied me with the guard, wishing to
please me lest by some sudden turn of the wheel of fortune, of a
sort that often happens at the courts of these Eastern kings, I
who a moment ago was about to be condemned to a lingering death,
should become powerful and able to repay injuries, hastened to
inform me that this was the place whence the ladies of the royal
House were sometimes allowed to look down on ceremonies of state.
He added that, whether by accident or skill, he did not know, it
was so contrived that those who sat in it could hear all that was
said below, whereas even if they were to shout, their voices
would never reach those gathered in the hall.</p>

<p>I thanked him and seated myself upon a carved stool which he
brought to me, in such fashion that through peepholes I could see
everything that passed. As it chanced there was much worthy of
note. The doors of the great hall had been thrown open and
through them flowed a gaily dressed multitude of guests. Beyond
these at the end of the hall, in that place where I had been
judged, immediately beneath my gallery, many courtiers and
officers were assembling before the throne, at the head of whom I
noted the prince Belshazzar, he who had counselled that I should
be tormented to death.</p>

<p>At first this throne was empty, for Nabonidus had left it for
a while. When he reappeared I saw the reason, for now he was
gorgeously apparelled and his head-dress and beard which had been
disarrayed, were straightened, so that in his jewelled robes he
wore the aspect of a great king.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap14"></a>CHAPTER 14<br>

THE PROPHET AND THE PRINCE</h2>

<p class="first">
FOR a while from this high place I watched the scene wondering
idly what it might portend, as a man does who knows not whether
he has another hour to live. Indeed it was not till afterwards
that the chatter of Nabonidus as to marrying again came back to
my mind, which at the time was full of all that I had heard as to
the hideous methods by which Eastern kings did their enemies, or
those who were condemned as malefactors, to death, with fire and
water and hooked instruments that slowly tore the vitals out of
them in a fashion that was not known in Egypt. Also it was full
of rage against Amasis who, as now I saw clearly, although he did
not guess that it would bring me to Babylon, had sent me on this
mission that it might be my last. For had he not betrayed me to
these Babylonians, naming me a spy to make sure, as he thought,
of the death of one of whom for his own reasons he would be rid
by the hands of others, thus leaving his own unstained?</p>

<p>But when there arose a cry of, "The bride comes! The royal
Lady comes!" every word of that talk as to taking another bride
came back to me and I felt my heart stand still.</p>

<p>What if this bride, this royal lady should chance to be my own
wife &mdash;Myra? What if I should be forced to witness the
giving of her to that crowned dotard whose foolishness had just
saved me from death, if only for an hour?</p>

<p>I turned to the eunuch and asked him what was the meaning of
this ceremony, but either he did not understand my question or
thought it unlawful to answer. At least he remained silent.</p>

<p>Now through the open doors came a number of fair women singing
and dancing. Then followed musicians playing upon flutes and
other instruments, and after them heralds who bore gifts upon
cushions. Next appeared a litter surrounded by a guard of
soldiers. The litter was set down, the guard withdrew to right
and left. Waiting ladies of the royal household advanced and
drawing the curtains of the litter, helped her who was within it
to descend. She came forward and followed by a woman of short
stature dressed in a plain robe, walked to an open space in front
of the litter. Now I could see her well for the light from a high
window fell upon her.</p>

<p>It was Myra herself and her attendant was the old nurse,
Metep! Yes, thus again I saw Myra from whom I had parted months
before outside the temple of Hathor at Memphis.</p>

<p>She was royally arrayed and wore, as I noted, all the
wonderful jewels that were her heritage, also the crystal pendant
containing the little pressed lily that I had given her after
Belus had seen visions in the bowl at the Happy House in Memphis.
Upon her breast too was the emerald cylinder covered with strange
writing which was among the gems in the bag her mother had thrust
upon me in the tent on the battlefield; for all these, and
others, had been sent with her from Memphis. Further, upon her
brow holding her hair in place, was a little golden circlet from
the centre of which sprang the royal uraeus of Egypt; even at
this distance I could catch the flashing of its jewelled eyes.
Thus adorned she glided up the great hall, staring about her like
one bewildered who knew not where she was or what she did, a
vision of such wondrous beauty that a murmur of amazement arose
from the lips of the assembled company.</p>

<p>She reached the space before the throne where but a few
minutes before I had stood, a captive condemned to death, and
halted there. In the pause that followed I could see the
courtiers and the nobles bend forward to study her loveliness,
and especially the bold eyes of the Prince Belshazzar fixed upon
her face. Next, stiffly enough, the old king Nabonidus descended
from the throne and coming to her, parted the thin transparent
veil that covered her from head to foot, and kissed her on the
brow. Thereon all cried,</p>

<p>"The great King accepts the royal Lady of Egypt. May the King
live for ever! May the royal Lady, his wife, live for ever."</p>

<p>The echoes of this formal shout of welcome which announced
that Nabonidus had taken another wife in the presence of his
people, died away and suddenly Myra seemed to awake and began to
speak. She spoke low, yet, as the eunuch had told me, that hall
was so built that every syllable reached me in the high-set,
secret gallery.</p>

<p>"Touch me not, O great King," she said in a voice of music and
using the Babylonian tongue which she knew well, "for I am not
worthy."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Lady?" asked Nabonidus astonished. "It
seems to me that both in beauty and by rank you are worthy of any
king who ever sat upon the throne of Babylon."</p>

<p>"I have no rank, O King," she answered, "who was not born of
the royal House of Egypt. Nay, I am but a foundling taken from my
dying mother's breast upon the field of battle in the time of
Merodach. Amasis, the Pharaoh of Egypt, for his own purposes has
deceived you, O King. He stole me away from my home because I am
well-favoured, and palmed me off upon your envoys as a princess
of the line of Pharaoh. This coronet I wear is not mine, O King,"
and with a sudden motion she tore the uraeus circlet from her
brow and flung it away, so that her abundant hair was loosed and
fell down about her.</p>

<p>From all who heard these bold words came mutterings and gasps
of astonishment, for that such an affront should be put upon the
majesty of the King of Babylon seemed to them impossible.</p>

<p>Nabonidus lifted his hand and they were silent. Then he
said,</p>

<p>"If what you say is true, Lady, the Pharaoh of Egypt has done
me a great wrong and one which many would seek to wash away in
blood. But is it true? And even if it be true, well, I have
accepted you and your mien is fair and royal if your blood be
not. Though indeed," he added as if to himself, "to me who am so
old, fair women royal or other now are naught."</p>

<p>He thought for a moment, then continued, "This is a tangled
coil, but if you can prove what you allege, it still seems best
and would do you least dishonour that you should enter the palace
as one of the ladies of my household."</p>

<p>"It cannot be, O King," said Myra in a strained voice and I
saw the pearls upon her breast quiver as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Cannot be! Why cannot it be?" he asked sternly, adding,
"Great kings do not listen to such words."</p>

<p>"Because, O King, I am already wed and therefore unmeet for
the royal household. Spare me, O King," and she sank to her
knees, stretching out her arms in supplication.</p>

<p>"Already wed!" he exclaimed shrinking back from her, while
some of those present in tones of horror echoed the words,
"Already wed!"</p>

<p>For as I learned afterwards, for ages no such sacrilege had
been known as that one who was married should be given to the
Great King as a wife or as a member of his household.</p>

<p>"Let the woman be taken away," said a voice, I think it was
that of the vizier who had interpreted the king's motion as an
order of death.</p>

<p>"Nay," exclaimed Nabonidus, "I did not speak. If her story be
true, namely that she was torn from her home and sent hither to
me disguised as a royal princess of Egypt in return for my
daughter given to Pharaoh, then the blame is Pharaoh's and not
hers, and with Pharaoh we must settle our account. But I
repeat&mdash;is it true? Though that a woman should lie upon such
a matter, thus throwing away the place of Queen of Babylon, seems
strange, unless love drives her. Lady, have you any evidence to
your tale?"</p>

<p>Myra, still upon her knees, looked over her shoulder and said
in the Egyptian tongue,</p>

<p>"Come hither, Nurse, and tell the king who I am and how I came
here."</p>

<p>So Metep stood forward staring about her in a bewildered
fashion, for she had understood no word of all this talk in the
Babylonian tongue. Soon it was seen that she could only speak
through an interpreter. After some search an officer was found
who knew Egyptian, though not too well for he spoke it haltingly
and with a foreign accent. At length he asked her whether it was
true that her mistress was married.</p>

<p>Metep answered, "Yes, she is married, unless the priests of
Hathor are all liars," and then began a rambling story of how
Myra had been taken away from the Happy House by the servants of
Pharaoh with whom came the great lady, Chloe, and how she had
clung to the doorway pillars till they dragged her arms apart, a
tale that caused me to grind my teeth with rage. Still it was one
of which the king soon wearied, especially as the officer
interpreted but ill.</p>

<p>"This old woman is a babbling fool," he said. "Let her be
silent. Is there no other here who can speak of this matter? If
not the lady had best be removed to the women's court and set
among those to whom the King has bidden farewell, until our
pleasure concerning her is known."</p>

<p>Then suddenly there stepped forward a man clad in the robe of
a Babylonian astrologer, for on it and on his pointed cap were
painted stars and other strange emblems. By the gods, it was
Belus! Yes, Belus himself and no other, and oh! my heart leapt at
the sight of him.</p>

<p>"Who is this?" asked Nabonidus.</p>

<p>"May it please the King," answered Belus, "I am one whom the
King once knew well, before he was called to the throne of
Babylon. Yes, I sprang from one who sat upon that throne before
him. I was scribe and astrologer in the royal household; a priest
also of Marduk and of Ishtar, the Queen of Heaven. In those days
I, who am now known as Belus, or as Azar, had another name which
the King may remember. If not I will whisper it in his ear," and
stepping forward he bent his head and said something that caused
Nabonidus to start. Then retiring, he went on,</p>

<p>"The King will recall my story. I was married but had not lost
my wife who left me with a daughter. That maiden was exceedingly
fair. She was stolen from me, it matters not by whom"&mdash;here
I thought that he glanced at Belshazzar who I saw was listening
intently. "The maid was one of spirit and because she fought
against fate, she was murdered. Her body was thrown into the
river and found with a letter in her robe that told all the tale.
If the King would see that letter, I have it here. I sought
redress but found none. Therefore I left Babylon and went to
dwell at the court of the Pharaoh of Egypt, leaving behind me my
curse on those by whom I have been wronged."</p>

<p>Here again I thought that he glanced towards Belshazzar.</p>

<p>"Never have I returned to Babylon although I still have
friends here to whom I write from time to time. These can testify
of me, as can the masters of magic and the readers of the stars
with whom I am ever in communion. Yet fate has brought me back to
Babylon, as soon or late, I knew well that it would do. Now is
the King satisfied that I am a true man, to prove which I have
told him all this story?"</p>

<p>"I am satisfied and I accept the story which to my sorrow, I
have heard before, O friend of my youth," answered Nabonidus.</p>

<p>"Then if the King will be pleased to listen, I will witness
concerning this lady whom I have known from childhood. As she has
said, she was taken from the arms of her dying mother when an
infant after the great battle between the Egyptians and the
Babylonians, in which the Prince Merodach commanded the forces of
Babylon, for I saw her brought to his tent by the Egyptian
captain who found her, and with her those jewels which she wears
to-day. That captain who was my friend and with whom I dwelt,
nurtured her to womanhood, all supposing that she was his
daughter, till at length, but a little while ago, he took her to
wife. Immediately afterwards she was stolen away by the Pharaoh
of Egypt and, because of her great beauty and royal bearing, was
sent in the character of a princess of Egypt to be a wife to your
Majesty."</p>

<p>"A trick for which Pharaoh shall pay dear, especially as I
have touched her with my lips and therefore accepted her as my
wife," explained Nabonidus. "Yes, and my wife she must remain
until I die, for is it not an ancient law that what the King of
Babylon does in council before the people can never be
undone?"</p>

<p>Now when I heard these words in my watching-place, hope left
me, as I think it did Myra, for I saw her tremble and rest her
hand on the shoulder of Metep as though she were about to fall.
Still I set my teeth and listened on.</p>

<p>"What is the name of the man to whom this lady is wed, and
what his station, O friend of my youth now known as Belus and
travelling under that of Azar?" asked the king.</p>

<p>"His name is Ramose, O King, one who in my company follows
after learning and holds high office in Memphis in Egypt. By
birth he is a son of Apries, late Pharaoh of Egypt, having a
Grecian lady called Chloe for his mother."</p>

<p>Now the vizier whispered something in the ear of the king, who
nodded and said,</p>

<p>"Therefore one of whom the present Pharaoh, the slayer of
Apries, would wish to be rid. Oh, now I see all the plan. The
husband who sheltered the child as his daughter and afterwards
made her his wife, is the bastard of a Pharaoh of the true
descent and thus has royal blood in his veins. Hence she, the
supposed daughter, is called a royal princess and as such
declared to be a fit wife for the Majesty of Babylon. Truly a
plot well worthy of the base-born venturer who sits upon the
throne of Egypt."</p>

<p>He paused, his old hands shaking with wrath, then turned to
Myra and asked,</p>

<p>"Much wronged Lady, what am I to do with you?"</p>

<p>"O King, I pray you give me back to my husband whom I love and
who loves me."</p>

<p>"Where is your husband?"</p>

<p>"O King, I do not know. When I left Egypt in charge of your
officers I heard that Pharaoh detained him at his court.
Perchance Belus there knows, for never have they been separated
for many years."</p>

<p>"If so, Belus may be wise to keep silent, lest Pharaoh should
learn his answer," said the king warningly. "Listen, Lady,
according to our law you are now my wife. The past matters not, I
have touched you with my lips and you are the wife of the King of
Babylon. Is that not the law, Vizier?"</p>

<p>"It is, O King," he replied, bowing. "Henceforward if any man
ventures to look upon this woman, yea, even though he were once
her husband, he must die, and if she shares his guilt she must
die with him."</p>

<p>"You hear, Lady," said the king.</p>

<p>"I hear," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Yet," he went on, "be sure that you have naught to fear from
me who do not wish to anger the gods by such a sin, and therefore
lest you should be troubled on this matter, you shall not enter
into my household. Nor can you be sent back to Egypt for many
reasons, and above all for your own sake, for then Pharaoh Amasis
would be avenged upon you who have betrayed his villainy. Where
then must you go?"</p>

<p>"To the tomb, I think," she answered in a faint voice. "There
alone are rest and safety."</p>

<p>"Nay," answered the old king looking on her with kind eyes,
"you are too fair and over-young to die. Who knows what the gods
may have in store for you? Yet what am I do to with you?"</p>

<p>Now I saw that black-robed, thin-faced, dreamy-eyed old man
who was called Daniel or Belteshazzar and a prophet, step forward
out of the crowd of courtiers. He came to Myra and studied her
face. Next he dropped his eyes and stared fixedly at the emerald
amulet which hung beneath the pearls and other ornaments upon her
bosom. Then he turned to the king and said,</p>

<p>"May the King live for ever! It is revealed to me, O King,
that this lady is by blood one of a captive people who dwell in
this kingdom, that of the Hebrews, to which I too belong. Never
before have I beheld her, still I say it is revealed to me. O
King, it has pleased you and some who sat upon your throne before
you to show me favour and to make me a ruler in your land."</p>

<p>"We know your story, O Prophet Belteshazzar," answered
Nabonidus in a voice that was touched with awe, "and that you are
favoured and protected by your God with whom you commune day and
night. It is needless to repeat it before those who have seen
your miracles. If you have any petition to make concerning this
woman, speak on, remembering that having been accepted by me,
under our law which may not be changed, she can be given to no
other man who lives."</p>

<p>"I have a petition to make, O King," answered the prophet.
"The King knows what I am and my manner of life. Let this lady
and her servant be given into my charge till the will of God
concerning her is known. Meanwhile I swear that during the King's
lifetime she shall be visited or spoken to by no other man, and
thus the law of Babylon as to those who have been accepted by the
King, shall not be broken. Let officers be set about my house to
watch the fulfilment of my oath."</p>

<p>Nabonidus thought a while; then he said wearily,</p>

<p>"I tire of this business. Scribes, write down my decree. I
command that the woman named Myra, whom I accepted believing her
to be a royal princess of Egypt given to me in exchange for that
royal lady of Babylon whom I have sent as a wife to Pharaoh, but
who it seems is already wed to another man and therefore unfit to
enter my household, shall be placed in the charge of
Belteshazzar, my servant, a prophet of the people of Judah, to
hold in ward until my pleasure concerning her is known. I command
that a guard be set by day and night about the dwelling of the
prophet Belteshazzar, to make sure that this woman has no
converse with any other man. If she is found in company or speech
with any man save the prophet, let her and that man be slain. Now
touch my sceptre, both of you, O Prophet, and Woman Myra, in
token that you acknowledge my decree."</p>

<p>So saying he stretched out a little golden rod that all this
while he had held in his hand, first to one of them and then to
the other, thereby assuring them of safety and making his word
unchangeable.</p>

<p>They touched the sceptre; the stern-faced, black-robed prophet
bowed to the king and beckoned to Myra to follow him. A guard
formed round them and they departed from the hall of audience by
a side entrance. Myra, who seemed crushed with grief, leaning on
the shoulder of Metep, for she tottered as she walked. Her path
led her past the spot where the Prince Belshazzar, governor and
vice-king of Babylon, stood surrounded by his courtiers. He bent
forward and stared at her in a fashion of which none could
mistake the meaning, then uttered some jest to the lords that
caused them to laugh and the prophet to turn his head and look at
him as though in rebuke. Next this Belshazzar advanced to the
throne and said something to the king in a low voice which I
could not catch. Whatever it may have been it angered Nabonidus,
for he flushed and replied wrathfully,</p>

<p>"What I have said, I have said, who am still king in Babylon,
and it shall go ill with any who defy me, yes, even with you,
Prince."</p>

<p>In the silence that followed these threatening words, he waved
his sceptre, thereby declaring the court at an end, left the
throne and departed attended by his officers.</p>

<p>Belshazzar watched him go, then he shrugged and said in a loud
and angry voice to his attendants,</p>

<p>"Even kings do not live for ever and their decrees die with
them. Soon I will find yonder lovely one a gayer home than the
cell of that black Hebrew wizard," a speech at which some laughed
and others looked afraid, for it was treasonable.</p>

<p>The great hall emptied, the glittering crowd pouring through
the doorways like a stream of gold and jewels. Soon they were all
gone. For a while I sat on in the secret gallery so overwhelmed
with what I had endured that I could scarcely think. At last a
messenger came who whispered to the watching eunuch. Thereon he
touched me on the shoulder and led me away surrounded by the
guard. I went, wondering whether I was being taken to my death.
But it was not so, for presently once more I found myself in my
prison where they left me alone.</p>

<h2><a id="chap15"></a>CHAPTER 15<br>

RAMOSE FINDS FRIENDS</h2>

<p class="first">
THEY brought me food but I could not touch it, though of their
strong wine I drank a goblet or two which gave me back what I
seemed to have lost, the power to think.</p>

<p>Strange and dreadful was my case! I had found Myra but to lose
her again for ever, although for the present she had escaped
violence and was left alive in what seemed to be safe hands,
those of the Hebrew prophet about whom such marvellous tales were
told and who was feared of all.</p>

<p>I who was a student of the customs of foreign nations, well
knew those of Assyria and Babylon, and indeed of all the monarchs
of the East, namely that women were their chattels and that any
who once had passed their doors and entered their presence, were
sealed to them for ever and under pain of death might
henceforward be seen only by other women and by eunuchs. The man
who spoke to them was doomed, even though he were a brother; they
were dead to the world. Such was the lot of Myra which perhaps
she might have escaped, had she but spoken earlier before, moved
by her beauty, the old king accepted her. Yet how could she speak
who did not know or understand?</p>

<p>Stay! Belus whom I thought lost, had appeared again clothed
with power and as a friend of the king, who it seemed had been a
companion of his youth. In Belus there was hope. Yet what could
Belus do? He might so work that my life would be spared, for
which if Myra were lost to me, I should not thank him &mdash;no
more. And that beetle-browed, fierce-eyed Belshazzar, that prince
of evil fame, the real king in Babylon, who but for some chance,
if there be any chances in the world, would have sat that day
upon the seat of judgment &mdash;what of him? He had cast eyes of
longing upon Myra, and what he desired soon or late he would
surely take, as he had declared but now, unless indeed she
escaped him by the gate of death. Oh! my strait was sore and I
had naught on which to lean, save trust in God, if there were any
god who paid heed to the miseries of us poor mortals and
stretched over them the shield of justice.</p>

<p>Yet life still remained to us and while we lived all might be
retrieved, for the last throw had not been cast. In my agony I
prayed, not knowing to whom or to what to pray,</p>

<p>"O Power that made the world," I cried in my heart, "O
Strength unseen, unknowable, that drew us out of darkness and set
us on this gaudy, changeful stage, whence presently we must fall
into Death's deeper darkness. O vast Intelligence that deviseth
all, O Beginning and End that is no end; O Point of Time and
Circle of Eternity, hear me, the mote of dust blown by thy
breath. Help me and her thou gavest me who has been made the
sport of vanity and statecraft. Save her from shame and of thy
mercy give us who love each other, our little hour of light
before we are borne back into blackness. Rob us not of the common
gift that is poured upon beast and bird and flower &mdash;the joy
they know beneath the glory of the sun. Or if this may not be,
let us pass hence swiftly and hand in hand go to seek that which
lies beyond the sun."</p>

<p>In some such words I prayed and as the last of them passed my
lips, the door opened and a messenger appeared.</p>

<p>"Rise up," he said. "The Great King commands your
presence."</p>

<p>A guard following me, I went with him to the private
apartments of the palace. We passed through many that were
gorgeous to a large plain chamber, well lit from the roof. Here
upon a chair set against a table, sat a man whom at first I did
not know, a little withered old man dressed in such a robe as
workmen wear. Looking at him again I perceived that it was none
other than Nabonidus the king stripped of all his finery and
engaged in eating a meal. The food was simple. On the bare table
were a jug of wine and a goblet or two, all of them, as I knew
who collect such things, dating from ancient days. Then there was
bread, and with it a bird cut up upon a platter, cheese made of
goat's milk and a handful of onions. Such was the fare of this
monarch of the earth.</p>

<p>I prostrated myself, but he called to me to rise, saying,</p>

<p>"We are not at court here. You are the Egyptian who
understands about gods, are you not? Well, have you eaten after
all that wearisome ceremony?"</p>

<p>I replied that I had not, whereon he added,</p>

<p>"Then come sit down and take some of this duck, if you can get
your teeth through it, which I can't. And if not, the bread and
the cheese are good and soft, and the country wine not bad. Don't
stare at me, you fool of a eunuch! Of course I know he can kill
me if he likes, but he won't, for learned men, and I take it he
is one of them, who study and seek out the secrets of the past
never kill each other&mdash;except with their tongues. Also if he
did, I am not certain that I should be sorry. There is so much
that I cannot learn in this world, that I rather look forward to
another where if there are thrones, may it please the gods I
shall not fill one of them. Out you go, Eunuch, and take that
guard with you. I hate to see them watching me, and the shining
of their swords, and to listen to the clatter of their armour.
Swords to stab and armour to turn them, and war, war, war, these
are the world into which an evil fate has cast me, and I weary of
them all. Don't stand there stammering. Out you go! If he kills
me, you can kill him afterwards, and we will continue our
discussion elsewhere. But I tell you he won't."</p>

<p>So the eunuch and the guard went, unwillingly enough, staring
first at Nabonidus and then at me.</p>

<p>"Now come and sit down," said the king. "There isn't another
stool, or at least they all have things on them, but that old
pottery coffin will do as well. I often use it myself."</p>

<p>"O King, I am unworthy," I began.</p>

<p>"By Marduk, or by Ishtar, or by Ammon of Egypt, whichever you
prefer, that is for me to judge, not for you. Don't waste time,
man. Look at all the relics I want to talk to you about," and he
pointed to long tables on which stood a number of stone gods,
among them those that I had seen in the hall of audience and
trays full of inscriptions graved upon clay or marble tablets and
cylinders.</p>

<p>So I sat myself upon the old pottery coffin which, I observed,
still had bones inside it, and began to eat. For now, I know not
why, my appetite had returned to me; perhaps hope was working in
my heart.</p>

<p>"I did you a favour just now, Egyptian," said the king, with a
chuckle. "When I told them to fetch you, they answered that they
feared it was too late, as my son Belshazzar had issued an order
for your execution in my name, perhaps because he thought I meant
you to die after all, or because he wished to be rid of you, I
don't know which. However, he won't do that again, for I
commanded that his people whom he was sending on the business,
should be seized and beaten on the feet until they can only crawl
away upon their hands and knees. Really," he added reflectively,
"it is Belshazzar who should suffer, not his servants. Only you
see he is almost as much a king as I am. That's the way of the
world, isn't it? One offends and others pay for it. I daresay it
works well in the end, as it teaches them and the rest not to
have to do with those who do offend."</p>

<p>"I thank the King," I said, thinking to myself that it was not
strange that my heart had been so heavy in my cell.</p>

<p>"Don't thank me for I owe you a good deal&mdash;take a cup of
wine, won't you, and look at the carving on that goblet before
you drink, for it is beautiful, of the third dynasty of Ur. See
the lion. We can't do such work nowadays. Fill mine first that I
may drink to show you it isn't poisoned. I have never poisoned a
man yet, which is more than most kings can say."</p>

<p>I did as he bade me and we both drank.</p>

<p>"Now listen," he went on as he set down his cup. "Your real
name is not Ptahmes but Ramose of whom, before you appeared here
as a spy, I have heard as a scholar and a collector in Cyprus,
for I know the names of all the really learned men. Don't deny it
for I have just had a private talk with my old friend Belus. Of
course I know that you are not a spy. You are a son of Apries,
are you not, one of whom that dog, Amasis, wishes to be rid
because of the blood in you which he and his son have not got;
also for other reasons?"</p>

<p>"It is so, O King, yet of old days this Amasis showed himself
a good friend to me because I pleased him as a soldier, though
once since he became Pharaoh, when in his cups, he did threaten
my life at my own table. Now if he would have me killed I think
it is for another reason."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, Ramose. Who knows the reasons of such a low-bred
man? They are as hidden as his parents. But this I can tell you.
Through those who serve him in this kingdom he caused me to be
warned that you were a dangerous fellow, believed to be the
bearer of forged writings purporting to appoint you an envoy from
Egypt to Cyrus the Persian, whereas really you were in the pay of
the said Cyrus."</p>

<p>"It is false, O King. Let the writings that have been taken
from me, be carefully examined and it will be seen that they are
not forged. Also I was forced to this embassy; why I have learned
to-day."</p>

<p>"Which if you had carried out you would have found an evil
one, for doubtless Cyrus is also warned against you. Oh! your
Amasis is a rat! He is afraid of Babylon and he is also afraid of
the Persians, with more reason perhaps for I think their star
rises in the East. Therefore he tries to play off one against the
other and to pretend himself the friend of both. But tell me,
Ramose. If you thought yourself an ambassador to Cyrus, what were
you doing making secret inquiries in Damascus?"</p>

<p>"I sought one whom I had lost, O King."</p>

<p>"So I have learned. You and no other are the same Ramose who
is the husband of that most beauteous lady who to-day was
delivered to me as a wife, to bribe me to a friendship with
Egypt, but who it seems was stolen from you by Amasis, pretending
that he believed her to be your daughter and therefore with royal
blood in her. Had I seen Belus first and known all the story,
never would I have accepted her. But I did not until it was too
late and she was so exceedingly fair that for a flash of time I
thought myself young again, as old men do at moments, and
received her in the ancient, accepted fashion, which perchance
you saw."</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw it all," I answered with a groan.</p>

<p>"Therefore, Ramose, it is finished," he went on. "For even a
king of Babylon with all his power cannot hand over to any other
man a woman whom once he has publicly acknowledged as his wife,
because if he did so, he would earn the curse of the
gods&mdash;or of their priests&mdash;and bring contempt and
mockery upon his name. Yet I have done what I could for you and
her. I have placed her in the keeping of the holy saint who
confounded one that went before me, and who is feared and
honoured throughout my kingdom as a mighty magician; a half-god;
not of it, but dwelling on the earth. With him she will be safe,
for there are no men in his house where even the boldest dare not
molest her, no, not Belshazzar himself&mdash;while I live," he
added slowly as though to warn me.</p>

<p>"Still our case is evil, O King, who are wed and love each
other, and yet under pain of death must always be separate."</p>

<p>For a while the old man went on munching the brown barley
bread with his toothless gums and gazing at me. Then he said,</p>

<p>"Perhaps not quite so evil as you think, friend Ramose.
Listen. I will tell you what I hide even from my physicians and
astrologers. From the physicians because they cannot help me;
from the astrologers because it will save them and their stars
the trouble of providing favourable omens and interpretations
that will never be fulfilled. I shall not be here long, friend
Ramose, at least above the ground. At times my heart seems to
stop, especially if I am hurried or angered, and I descend into a
pit of blackness and walk upon the edge of death. It did so when
I learned of the trick of Amasis and again now for an instant,
when I grew wrath because Belshazzar for some dark reason of his
own had commanded that you should be killed against my will.
Well, soon I think I shall walk over that edge and there will be
an end."</p>

<p>"May the gods forbid it! May the King live for ever!" I said
earnestly, for forgetting its own troubles my heart went out
towards this kindly old man to whom majesty brought so little
joy.</p>

<p>"May the gods do nothing of the sort, Egyptian, for I think a
fate is falling upon Babylon which I do not wish to live to see.
While I have strength I cling to the throne that, if I can, I may
shield her from the folly of those who refuse to make peace with
this upstart Persian, Cyrus, who is yet a great man. When I am
gone let Belshazzar and his young counsellors follow their own
road to ruin. I read in your eyes that you are honest, also Belus
has made report to me of you; were it otherwise I should not
speak thus with a stranger, but it seems that after all you are
only a flatterer like the rest with your&mdash;'May the King live
for ever!' Being wise, you know that kings do not live for ever,
unless indeed that is the lot of all elsewhere. Still I forgive
you who being much shaken and afraid seek to speak smooth
things."</p>

<p>"It is true, pardon me, O King."</p>

<p>"Let it be and hearken. When a king of Babylon dies the
ancient and inviolable law is loosed and, within a year, the
women of his household, save the mother of the new king, may
marry and go where they will. Then will be your opportunity as
regards this lady Myra, if you can win her out of the grasp of
any who would hold her fast in Babylon, and especially of one
whom I will not name who desires her and, as I hear, already has
sworn to take her. Therefore you must stay on here in this city
where your goods shall be restored to you with my pardon for all
that you may have done. It is in the hands of the gods. May they
give you strength and wisdom. Meanwhile keep to your false name
of Ptahmes and, if you would live, let none guess that you are
Ramose, the husband of Myra. I have spoken. Now let us talk about
other things."</p>

<p>Then, dismissing my private business to which he had given so
much thought in the goodness of his kind heart, he began to speak
wisely enough of the old gods whose images stood about in this
chamber, of their history and worshippers, of the cities where he
had found them, of the temples that he had built or restored, and
I know not what besides.</p>

<p>As it chanced of many of these matters I knew a great deal,
having studied the attributes of the gods of many lands,
comparing them one with another and tracing their rise and fall
with that of the countries or cities which worshipped them, or
how they changed their characters and names as it might suit
their priests to make them do. So it came to pass that we talked
on, as learned man to learned man, until at length the dusk began
to gather and I saw that the old king grew weary, for he leaned
back in his chair, put his hand upon his heart, closed his eyes
and sighed. I watched him anxiously and especially a blue tinge
which appeared upon his lips, not knowing what to do, who was
sure that if he died when I was alone with him, it would be laid
to my door and my life would pay the price.</p>

<p>Presently, however, he recovered and ordered me to strike upon
a bell which stood near by. Instantly attendants and guards
appeared who all this while had been gathered without, and with
them one of his private scribes.</p>

<p>To this man the king dictated words which he wrote down. They
were an order of pardon to me, Ptahmes the Egyptian, or rather a
declaration of my innocence of all that was laid to my charge.
Also a decree that I should be set at liberty, furnished with
apartments in the palace and sustenance as the king's guest, and
have right of access to the king at all times that he could
receive me. This writing he sealed in duplicate with his own
seal, and gave one copy of it to me, commanding that the other
should be made known to all the officers and governors of the
palace and of Babylon, and then filed in the temple of Marduk,
that thenceforward I might be safe in my going out and my coming
in and that everyone might do me reverence as the king's
friend.</p>

<p>These things done he waved his hand, thus bidding me farewell
and I was led away, no longer as a prisoner but with every
honour, the soldiers saluting and eunuchs and chamberlains bowing
down before me.</p>

<p>Such were the changes of fortune that I experienced on this,
my first day in Babylon, and such were the strange happenings
that befell me.</p>

<p>They led me to beautiful apartments high up in the old part of
the palace that, as I was told, in the days of dead kings had
served as the lodgings of envoys from foreign courts. Here I
found all my goods, and with them the gold that had been taken
from me, yes, to the last piece, and even the letters of Amasis
and his officers, that should have brought about my death, though
these were given to me later. Having been acquitted and honoured
by the king, everything against me was forgotten; I was as
another man. Palace servants waited on me, bringing delicate food
and wine, palace minstrels played upon many strange instruments
while I ate; even palace dancing girls appeared in light attire,
but these I sent away being in no mood for their
blandishments.</p>

<p>I ate, or pretended to eat, because I was ashamed to refuse
the food with so many eyes watching me. I drank as much as I
should drink, or perhaps more, because I needed the comfort of
wine, and afterwards sat and brooded alone at an open window-place.
Thence I could see much of the mighty city of Babylon over
which shone the full moon, the towering temples, the gleaming
river, the vast encircling walls, the palaces, the gardens, the
populous streets whence rose the hum of a million voices, the
flaring signal fires and cressets upon pinnacles and pillars, and
a thousand other spectacles that were new to me.</p>

<p>But these moved me not, for always my eyes wandered over the
sea of roofs, wondering beneath which of them dwelt that
piercing-eyed old man, the Prophet Daniel, or Belteshazzar, of
whom such marvellous tales were told, and with him, Myra, my
heart's desire.</p>

<p>Now that I thought of it, Belus had spoken to me of this
magician long ago, saying that he had interpreted the dreams of
Nebuchadnezzar. Yes, even when the king had forgotten what they
were, and thereby had saved the lives of all the wise men and
seers whom, in his fury, the king purposed to put to death. Also,
interpreting another dream, he had told him that because he
thought himself greater than God, God would make him as a beast
in the field, so that he would run about naked in his garden and
eat herbs like a beast. This indeed came to pass, since before
his end Nebuchadnezzar was smitten with madness. Yet he greatly
honoured Daniel or Belteshazzar as he was named in Babylon,
worshipping him as one divine, and promoted him to be the ruler
of Babylon after the king, a rank that it seemed he still
retained at least in name. Therefore Myra was more safe with him
than any other. Yet was she safe? Remembering the devouring
glance and the words of the fierce-eyed Belshazzar, the real king
of Babylon, I asked myself&mdash;Oh! was she safe?</p>

<p>Why not&mdash;if this Daniel were the servant and minister of
the true God and could throw his mantle over her? But was there
any true god who had power in a world where dwelt so many devils?
Alas! I did not know who for all my seeking, had never found him,
though at times, it is true, I thought that I had kissed his
feet.</p>

<p>There came a challenge at my door where it seemed a guard was
set, a word spoken, the rattle of a sheathed sword and the clank
of bolts. A man entered looking about him. As he moved his head
the lamplight fell upon his face, and I saw that it was Belus! I
remember that I ran and threw my arms around him, and that he
kissed me on the brow as a father might do, for indeed he was the
only true father I had ever known. Then, having made sure that we
were alone, we sat down and talked.</p>

<p>"Fortune has not gone so ill with us, Ramose, or rather
Ptahmes, for that name is safer here," he said. "When a while ago
we were parted on that journey to Seleucia I scarcely thought to
see you again living. They seized me and to save myself from
death, I declared to the king's scribe who accompanied them, what
I have hid even from you&mdash;my true lineage which is high
enough, seeing that through my mother, the king Nabonidus and his
son Belshazzar are my kinsmen. Also I showed my rank as a priest
of Ishtar and one of the first of the College of Astrologers, and
proved what I said by a certain writing and by tokens that I
carry hidden about me.</p>

<p>"They bowed before those holy tokens and instantly I was
hurried away in a chariot, that I might be brought into the
presence of the king and my tale confirmed by the Councils of the
priests and the astrologers at Babylon. I prayed earnestly that
you might come with me but it was not allowed, which, had not my
spirit told me otherwise, would have caused me to believe that
you were dead, for of your fate they would say nothing.</p>

<p>"I reached Babylon before you, travelling very swiftly by the
king's posts and though I could not see Nabonidus my cousin,
because he was sick and might not be disturbed, I appeared before
the Councils, among whom were men who had known me well in my
youth. I was given back my rank among the companies of the
priests and the watchers of the stars, which indeed I had never
forfeited as the records showed, who had left the land by the
leave of Nebuchadnezzar, to gather learning in other countries
which I might share with my companions in Babylon, as I have done
year by year. So very swiftly, as though it had been decreed, all
went well with me and now once more I am a man of high rank and
station in the great city, also as it chances, a relative by
blood of that King of kings who to-day sits upon the throne."</p>

<p>"And how did you learn what had happened to me, and to Myra,
Belus?"</p>

<p>"I made inquiry, but having so little time, could discover
nothing because your fate after you were taken prisoner was not
yet known, and of Myra who came to be wife to the king, if any
knew they would not speak because of the strange laws of Babylon
as to the women of the royal household. Not till early this same
morning was I sure that you were in Babylon and, because the
matter was urgent, would at once be brought before the king for
judgment, also that afterwards the royal lady, as they thought
her, who had been sent from Egypt to be wife to the king, would
be presented to him in the presence of the councillors and
nobles, that the friendship between Babylon and Egypt might be
thus publicly proclaimed. I strove to see you and to send a
letter to Myra, but it was impossible, for both of you were too
closely guarded. I strove to see the king, but this also was
impossible for, having been sick, he was still asleep and would
not rise from his bed till the hour came for him to attend the
court, as by good fortune he had suddenly determined to do at the
time of the uttering of judgments, to settle some matters
concerning a holy statue about which there was trouble because it
had been brought to Babylon. Do you know the rest?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Belus, for after my trial I was hidden away high up in a
secret gallery of the women where I could see all and hear every
word that passed. I tell you when I beheld Myra standing beneath
me in her beauty, and saw that old king so moved by it that he
forgot his years and weakness and, descending from his throne,
embraced her, thereby receiving her as a wife according to the
ancient customs, I thought that my heart would burst. Oh! why did
she not speak sooner, for then, being good-hearted, he might have
spared her?"</p>

<p>"Doubtless because it was so fated, Ramose, for her
good&mdash;and your own. If the king had rejected her as some
common cheat trapped out to ape a royal lady, she would have been
driven from the Presence to fall into the hands of the first who
chose to take her. Whose would they have been, Ramose?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean those of the Prince Belshazzar?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. Ramose, I have known him from his boyhood and I
tell you he is not a man, but a tiger who loves to prey upon fair
women; in particular upon those who hate and fly from him. You
heard the tale I told the king. Ramose, it was Belshazzar who
stole my daughter and afterwards murdered her, no other man."</p>

<p>For a while he paused and there was silence, for I knew not
what to say. Then his withered face and quiet eyes seemed to take
fire and he went on,</p>

<p>"Ramose, as you know, I am by nature gentle, one who can
forgive and find excuse for almost every sin because I understand
the hearts of men. But this prince I never can forgive who, as it
chances, knows all the horror of his crime and what he caused
that poor maid of mine to suffer before he butchered her. Towards
him I am a minister of vengeance appointed by God. Aye, through
all these years, while I dwelt so peacefully with you, I have
awaited my hour, sure that it would come, and now I think it is
at hand, though still I know not how. Doubtless he will try to
kill me because he fears me whom he has so deeply wronged, but he
will not succeed."</p>

<p>He paused again, then said,</p>

<p>"Let my troubles be a while; we will speak of yours, or rather
of ours. As he dealt with my daughter, so will Belshazzar deal
with Myra if he can. Having seen her beauty of which he had been
told, he will surely try to take her; indeed at the court I read
it in his eyes and heard him say as much after the king had
gone."</p>

<p>"As I did," I broke in with a groan.</p>

<p>"Now," went on Belus, "when I learned these things from those
who had been friends to me in the days of my youth, also that it
was impossible that I could speak or write you or Myra before the
sitting of the court, I went back to my chamber and prayed for
help to the Spirit of Wisdom whom I worship. So earnestly did I
pray that a faintness came over me and all grew dark to my eyes;
then on the blackness, or so it seemed to me, appeared one word
in the Chaldean writing, namely 'Daniel.' My mind returned to me
and I wondered who or what was Daniel, till presently I
remembered that Daniel was the name of a certain high-born
captain of the people of Judah, he whom Nebuchadnezzar advanced
to great honour, giving him the new name of Belteshazzar, by
which thenceforth he was known in Babylon. Also I was sure that
this man was brought to my mind because from him there might come
help in my trouble.</p>

<p>"I went out and having inquired where dwelt the lord and
prophet Belteshazzar, I ran as never I have run before, to his
house which is near to the southern gate. As I reached it Daniel
himself came out from the courtyard riding on a mule, for after
all these years I knew him again. I craved speech of him and at
first he answered,</p>

<p>"'Friend, I go to my garden without the wall, there to rest
and pray. If you have business with me I beg you to come at
another time.'</p>

<p>"'Lord and Prophet,' I answered, 'the business is most
urgent.' Then seeing that he was still minded to go on, I added,
'It has to do with one of the blood of Judah.'"</p>

<p>"Why did you say that?" I asked of Belus. "Was it only because
you thought he would listen to nothing else?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Ramose, it was because Myra, as I have long been sure,
is of that race. Did not her dying mother tell you so? Is not her
name that of a woman of Israel? Are not Hebrew characters, of
which the meaning is hid from me, engraved upon the emerald
amulet she wears, which her mother gave to you with the jewels?
Is not her appearance that of a noble and beautiful lady of the
Children of Judah, as you say was that of her mother before her?
At least I did say it and the prophet hearkened. Dismounting from
his mule he led me into the house and there in a small room where
stood many written rolls upon shelves, I brought myself to his
mind and told him all our story."</p>

<p>"'What would you have me do, Belus?' he asked when it was
finished. 'It is true that I am still named Governor of Babylon,
but my word does not run against the king's, and it is
Belshazzar, the king's son, not Belteshazzar the prophet, who
to-day has power in this evil city.'</p>

<p>"'I do not know,' I answered. 'Who am I that I should instruct
the greatest seer in Babylon?'</p>

<p>"'You tell me that you prayed&mdash;to what god I am not
sure&mdash; and that my name came to your mind, O Belus. Well,
the example is good and I will follow it, asking for light. Wait
here a while and be silent.'</p>

<p>"Then he went to a window-place that jutted from the wall of
the room, and knelt down by the open window to pray, and watching
his face from where I sat, I saw that it shone as it were with
light from within. Yes, it shone like a lamp, so that I grew sure
that his god was speaking to him. If this were so he did not tell
me what he had learned, for when he rose from his knees all he
said was,</p>

<p>"'I will not ride to my garden this day, though that is a
sorrow to me who longed for its peace. Nay, I will attend the
court and there abide what may happen.'</p>

<p>"'Cannot you see the king at once, O Prophet?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'No, it is impossible unless I am summoned. Moreover, no such
counsel has come to me. You are an astrologer and a priest of
Marduk, are you not? If so, go, dress yourself in the robes of
your office or of your false god and, as you have a right to do,
attend at the court where I think you will be needed.'</p>

<p>"'My false god,' I answered. 'Well at least he led me to you,
O Prophet. Tell me then who is the true God. For Him I have
sought all my life.'</p>

<p>"'Mayhap to find him at last to whom you draw near, for
otherwise your prayer would not have been answered. But of these
matters we will speak afterwards. Go now and do those things
which your heart teaches you. Go, and swiftly, for time
presses.'</p>

<p>"So I went and what happened afterwards, you know,
Ramose."</p>

<h2><a id="chap16"></a>CHAPTER 16<br>

RAMOSE IS TEMPTED</h2>

<p class="first">
NOW for a while in this story of mine little happened that is
worth the telling. Belus and I dwelt together in the palace as we
were allowed to do by the decree of the king. Of Myra we saw
nothing for it was impossible to come at her. In this business
the Prophet Daniel, or Belteshazzar, was as a rock that cannot be
moved or pierced. By the help of Belus I saw and talked with him,
though not in his own house, showing him how hard was our case,
and praying him at least to carry a letter from me to Myra. He
listened with a courteous patience, then answered,</p>

<p>"Noble Egyptian, Ramose, hear my counsel. First of all, forget
for a while that you are an Egyptian; that your real name is
Ramose and not Ptahmes, and most of all, that you have had
anything to do with a lady called Myra, who chances to be in my
charge as titular Governor of Babylon and a prophet beloved by
the king. At present all this is not known, or has been
forgotten, and you are thought of only as a stranger suspected in
error, and one admitted to the friendship of the king because you
are very learned in ancient histories and religions which it
pleases him to study. At least they are not known to Belshazzar
the prince and the king to be, who believes that the man said to
have married the lady Myra before the Pharaoh tried to palm her
upon Nabonidus, as a maiden of the royal House, is some noble of
Egypt who still dwells in that country. Were it otherwise, I
think that you would not live long, Ramose, for Belshazzar has
many servants in whose hands are daggers and no longer does he
cause his victims to be thrown into the great river unweighted
with stones" (here he glanced at Belus who was with me).</p>

<p>"All these things may be so, Prophet," I said. "Yet why should
I not see my wife in private, or at the least write to her?"</p>

<p>"Has not the king told you?" he answered sternly. "Then once
and for all I will. Because I have passed my word that no man
should do so while the king lives, O Ramose, and the word of
Belteshazzar, still known as the Governor of Babylon, may not be
broken. Well is it for you that this is so, and for the lady Myra
also. Twice already has the royal prince, Belshazzar, sent his
commands to me under seal, demanding that I should suffer him to
capture this lady, by allowing her to walk abroad beyond the
shelter of my walls which are sacred to the Babylonians, aye,
more sacred than the sanctuaries of their own temples, or at the
least that I should give him access to her. Both these commands I
defied, thereby earning his added hate and threats of vengeance.
Can I then grant to you what I have refused the heir to Babylon?
Can I even allow writings to pass between you which, if they were
found, would mean the death of both and my dishonour?"</p>

<p>"At least tell me of her, Prophet, for that is not against
your vow," I said humbly.</p>

<p>He thought a while; then answered,</p>

<p>"I may say this&mdash;she is well and after a fashion happy,
who has escaped great danger if only for a while; also for other
reasons."</p>

<p>"What other reasons?"</p>

<p>"One of them is that she has learned with certainty of what
blood she comes through her mother. It is high, for this mother,
as she told you at her death, was truly the daughter of Zedekiah,
the last king of Judah, who when he fled from Jerusalem towards
Jordan, took her with him, a little maid. He was captured and
brought to Riblah with a great number of the people of Israel.
Here Nebuchadnezzar in his rage because he had rebelled against
him, caused his sons to be slain before his face. Then he blinded
him and brought him as a slave to Babylon, where for years he lay
a prisoner in the dungeons of yonder temple till at length his
misery was ended in death. But the girl was spared for she showed
promise of beauty, and was afterwards given to the Prince
Merodach. You know the end of that story, Ramose, for you saw her
die in blood as her brothers died, and took away her babe and
reared it."</p>

<p>"How do you know these things, Prophet?" I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"In sundry ways, Ramose. When I was young I knew her mother
and that she was killed in the battle between Merodach and the
Egyptians in which you took part. Also I know the emerald seal
she wears, that has cut on it the name of God in ancient Hebrew
characters which I can read. It is an old seal and has a long
history. I remember it when it hung about the neck of Myra's
mother, as it did on that of her mother before her. Moreover the
truth of all this matter has been revealed to me. Without doubt
this lady Myra is descended from Zedekiah the weak and the
accursed and, as I think, is the last of his race left
living."</p>

<p>"It seems that I have a wife of high lineage," I said. "Well,
I heard as much before from the lips of the dying Mysia, but
scarcely believed it who thought that perhaps her mind
wandered."</p>

<p>"Aye, Ramose, too high for safety, who on both sides is of the
race of kings. Still it has made her happy to learn the truth,
because she thinks that this will please you who have wed one of
whom you need not be ashamed. She is happy also because now I am
leading her to worship the God of her fathers Whom I serve, and
lastly because she knows that you live in this same city and
believes that He will throw His shield over you and her and keep
you safe. For, Ramose, day and night she thinks of you and prays
to God for you."</p>

<p>Now when I heard this my heart melted in me with love and
longing, so that almost with tears I implored the prophet that
even if I might not speak or write to her, he would suffer me to
look on Myra with my eyes. At length he yielded.</p>

<p>"Hearken," he said. "Behind my house there is a little garden
through which runs a channel of water planted on its banks with
willow trees. Beneath these willows Myra sits in the cool of the
afternoon, reading or doing such tasks as please her. Now
overlooking this garden is another house that the king gave to me
together with that in which I dwell, where at times I shelter
those of my race who need it. To-day it is empty. Belus shall
lead you there and from its upper window, hidden yourself behind
the shutter, you may look on Myra, although she will not know
that your eyes behold her. This you may do on one day in every
seven, that which is our Sabbath, and no more, swearing to me
that you will not attempt to call to her or show yourself, and
this for your sake as well as hers, also for the sake of me and
of my oath. Babylon is full of spies, O Ramose, and were it known
that a man was so much as gazing upon a lady of the king's
household who is in my charge, it would bring death to him and
perhaps to her, with much trouble upon me. Swear now and leave
me."</p>

<p>So I swore and went.</p>

<p>The fourth day from that of my meeting with the prophet who
was called Belteshazzar, was that of the Sabbath of the
worshippers of Jehovah, and until it came it is true that I
scarcely ate or slept, because the desire to behold Myra burned
me up. At noon on that day, when men rested in the fierce heat
and few were in the streets save beggars and others who slept in
such shade as they could find, Belus and I, wrapped in the cloaks
worn by the poorer class of traders in Babylon, made our way to
the house of which the prophet had spoken.</p>

<p>Passing to the back of this house which was set almost against
the wall of an old and deserted building, once occupied by
priests and therefore, for some superstitious reason, no longer
dwelt in by others, Belus led me to a secret entrance that could
only be reached through the wall and doubtless was used by the
priests for their own purposes when they owned this house in
ancient days. At least there was the narrow, hidden door that he
unlocked with a strange key, and beyond it a dark and twisting
passage leading to the cellars of the house whence a stair, or
rather a ladder, ran to the floor above. Locking the door behind
us we climbed this ladder and came to a stairway of brick that
led to the upper rooms, for like many of the houses of Babylon
where land was precious, this was built in several storeys.</p>

<p>Entering a room that was well but plainly furnished, we found
in it a window-place projecting from the wall of the house,
around which were fixed wooden shutters whereof the bars that
were many, opened upon hinges to admit air and to enable those in
the room to look out whilst they remained unseen from below.</p>

<p>Belus went to this window-place and tilting up one of the
shutter bars, showed me that beneath us at a distance of not more
than ten or twelve paces, lay an enclosed garden such as the
prophet had described, of which the house formed a boundary wall.
There was the stream, or rather ditch of water, planted with
flowering lilies that floated on its surface; there were the
willow trees with their weeping branches in which birds were
nesting, and there beneath them were low cushioned seats and a
rough table of wood.</p>

<p>Here in this chamber we waited a long while, till at length
the great sun turned towards the west and the city around us,
awakening from its midday sleep, began to hum with life. Then at
last we saw white hands part the willow branches and a tall
figure glide across a little bridge of planks and enter the green
arbour, as we could do easily because the branches did not grow
thickly towards the blank wall of our house where there was
little light and no sun. It was Myra&mdash;Myra herself clad in
simple white robes on which hung a single ornament, the lily-bloom
enclosed in crystal, but looking more beauteous in them
even than she had done when arrayed in jewels and glorious
apparel, she was brought into the palace halls of Babylon to be
presented to its king.</p>

<p>For a space she stood motionless gazing at the lilies floating
upon the water. Almost was I tempted to call to her; indeed I
think I should have done so, had not Belus, guessing my purpose,
whispered in my ear -</p>

<p>"Remember your oath."</p>

<p>I bit my lips and kept silence.</p>

<p>She sighed&mdash;I could hear her sigh; then sinking down upon
the cushions she bent forward and drew one of the floating lily
blooms towards her as though to pluck it. If so, she changed her
mind for she loosed it and taken by the current, it swung back to
its place. Then she lifted the crystal from her breast, studied
the flower within, pressed it to her lips and letting it fall,
began to weep very softly, a sight that I could scarcely
bear.</p>

<p>At length she paused and wiping away her tears, sank to her
knees upon a cushion and prayed aloud but in so low a voice that
I could hear little of what she said. Still I caught some words,
such as&mdash;"God of my fathers. God above all gods, Thou that
hast power even in mighty Babylon and over the hearts of its
princes..."</p>

<p>Then came murmurings not to be distinguished, and after them,
these words, spoken more clearly as though the weight of sorrow
pressed them from her heart:</p>

<p>"... Ramose my most beloved, he from whom I have been stolen,
my husband whom my arms ache to hold. Oh! bring me to him or let
me die. Let me not be defiled by the touch of this vile prince
who seeks me. Nay, rather let me die clean and wait till Ramose
comes to join me in the grave."</p>

<p>She ceased her pitiful prayer, pressed the crystal case
passionately against her lips once more and drawing a roll from a
satchel that she had with her, began to read.</p>

<p>Not for long did she read, for presently she threw down the
roll, pressed her hands upon her heart as though to still its
beating, and glanced about her wide-eyed, while the colour came
and went upon her cheeks.</p>

<p>Then I knew that she felt me near to her. Yes, that love
opened some door in her breast through which had entered a
knowledge that her senses could not seize. In her agitation she
spoke to herself in a low and thrilling whisper that floating on
the still air, reached me faintly in the window-place.</p>

<p>"I feel Ramose near me," she said. "Is he dead? Does his
loosed spirit speak with mine yet captive in the flesh? Nay, it
is his living love that beats upon me, wave after wave of it
filling the cup of my heart. I dream! I dream! Oh! would that the
dream might last for ever, for in it his lips touch mine that
hunger for them. Oh! Ramose my love, Ramose my own, come to me,
Ramose, and not in dreams."</p>

<p>Such words as these she murmured and others that I could not
catch.</p>

<p>Now I was gripped by mad temptation. A strong creeping plant
from whose woody stems hung masses of blue flowers, climbed up
the wall and past our window-place, by aid of which it would not
be difficult to descend into that garden. In the fury of my great
desire, honour and all else was forgotten. I would descend. I
would be with her; if only for a breath I would hold her in my
arms though my life should pay the forfeit. Might I not take my
own? Already, staggering like a drunken man, I was at the
shutter, purposing to push it back, when I heard the voice of
Belus whisper:</p>

<p>"Remember your oath, Ramose. Shall it be written that you are
a liar?"</p>

<p>"By the gods, no!" I answered huskily. "Let us go before I
fall."</p>

<p>With one last glance at the passionate loveliness of Myra, who
seemed to have taken fire from the power of her living dream and
now stood glancing about her with parted lips and heaving breast,
I turned, cursing my fate, and reeled towards the doorway.
Behold! in it stood a man, the prophet himself! He gazed at me
sternly, yet with a little smile playing about the corners of his
thin mouth.</p>

<p>"You have fought well, Ramose, and gained a victory that one
day should not lack for its reward."</p>

<p>"Not I, but Belus," I muttered.</p>

<p>"Nay, Belus did but give tongue to your own conscience. Learn
that had you yielded, what you sought would never have been
yours. Though none can hear her words, eyes other than your own,
the eyes of women and of eunuchs, watch that lady always from a
hidden place when she is unguarded in the garden, and had a man
been seen to join her, she would have been dragged away to suffer
the fate of those who are faithless to the king. Yes, to die by
fire or water &mdash;or if his officers were very merciful, to be
mutilated and made hideous, and thus cast upon the streets where
you would never find her, for you would be dead."</p>

<p>I shivered, for Myra not for myself, because at that moment I
thought death would be better than so much suffering. Then words
came to me and I said,</p>

<p>"I have gone near to great evil. I pray your pardon for being
but a man. Prophet, unless you bid me, I will come to this place
no more, lest once again passion should lead me whither I would
not go. If you may, tell Myra that I have seen her and aught else
that you think wise, for it is not in the heart of woman to think
the worse of one who has done wrong because he loves her
overmuch."</p>

<p>"So be it," he answered, still smiling faintly, and thus we
parted.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that until fate drove me there, I came to
that house no more.</p>

<p>Now I have to tell of the death of Nabonidus. For many weeks I
dwelt on in the palace and almost every day this kindly old king,
save when he was too ill or too troubled with the affairs of
state, sent for me, and sometimes for Belus his cousin also, to
talk with him about such matters as the learned love. It was
strange to see him, still one of the mighty monarchs of the
world, caring for none of its glories, hating them even; turning
his back upon high officers and lovely women; upon the pomp,
jewels and worship which in the East are offered to the king, to
give all his time and thought to the study of ancient writings or
forgotten temples, and to the history and attributes of a
thousand gods. Yet such was the pleasure of this shrewd but
innocent mind, and to it I was a minister. Indeed had I chosen, I
might have become great in Babylon, for he would have heaped on
me any wealth and offices that I desired. But I did not choose
who sought above all things to remain humble and unknown.</p>

<p>So under the name of Ptahmes, by which I had passed since I
entered Babylonia, I remained in the palace, as did scores of
others to whom it pleased the king to give hospitality in that
vast building, which covered almost as much ground as does the
Great Pyramid near Memphis.</p>

<p>Here I gave out that I was an Egyptian born of a Cyprian
mother at Naukratis in the Delta, a man of independent means who
followed after learning and in its pursuit wandered from land to
land, desiring to see them and to study their customs and peoples
that I might write of them in a book. This tale was accepted
readily enough for since I had been acquitted by the king and
admitted to his friendship, the accusation against me of being a
spy in the pay of Egypt or of Persia was forgotten, as soon most
things were in the vast metropolis of Babylon, a city where
memories were very short, especially concerning those whom it
pleased the king to favour. So I dwelt in peace, consorting only
with a few other learned men, to whom Belus made me known as a
friend of his with whom he had studied at Naukratis in Egypt. For
now Belus had recovered the lost ties of his youth and was
accepted everywhere as a noble of Babylon, a blood relation of
the king, a priest of the gods and an astrologer of high
degree.</p>

<p>Here I should say that shortly after I had seen Myra in the
prophet's garden Belshazzar, the king's son and heir, left
Babylon at the head of a great army to wage war against Cyrus the
Persian who was threatening the empire, and while his enemy was
away Belus was safer than he had been before. Therefore he too
remained at peace in the city. Why he did so I was not sure,
seeing that the place was still perilous for him. When I asked
him, he said that he would not leave me and Myra with whom his
lot was intertwined, and when I pressed him further, that he was
commanded to bide here by the stars which he consulted after the
fashion of the great astrologers of Babylon.</p>

<p>Yet all the while I knew that he was hiding his true reason.
In those days there was something fateful, even terrible about
Belus. Often I watched the old man pretending to read or to
consult mysterious signs written upon skins or tablets and noted
that his mind was far away. There he sat like a sphinx, his lips
pressed together, his eyes, cold and fixed, staring out at
nothingness and his face grown fierce as that of a lion which
scents its prey.</p>

<p>At such times if I spoke to him all this would fall from him
like a mask; the eyes twinkled, the face grew friendly and a
smile appeared around the lips where it was wont to be, so that I
wondered which was the real appearance and which the mask. Little
did I know of the great schemes that seethed in the heart of
Belus; of the mighty plots he wove in his cunning brain and of
the terrible revenge he planned, or why at night he met many of
the great ones of Babylon now here and now there, and talked with
them secretly.</p>

<p>When I asked him of these meetings he answered that those
great lords and priests came together to consult their stars, as
indeed in a sense they did. To this I said nothing though I
thought it very strange that men, however gifted, should be able
to consult stars on nights of full moon when the sky was almost
as bright as day, or as I knew sometimes was the case, in vaults
beneath the piled-up mass of temples.</p>

<p>In the beginning I was vexed who felt that for the first time
for many years Belus had drawn a veil between us, hiding his
secrets from me, but after thought, I grew sure that this must be
for some good reason. So it was in truth, for as I learned later,
he held that there was much passing in Babylon which it would be
dangerous for me to know, because those who knew might suddenly
find themselves face to face with death.</p>

<p>On a certain day when, as was common, I had been summoned by
one of his chamberlains to wait upon Nabonidus in the private
chamber where he studied, surrounded by the statues of gods and
other relics of antiquity, I found the old king much changed. In
body he seemed weaker than I had ever known him. He could
scarcely rise from his chair without my help, and to do so left
him almost breathless for a while. I asked if he were ill and if
so why he did not summon his physician.</p>

<p>"No, not ill, Friend," (for so he often called me now) "but
only burning out. Physicians cannot help me and I will have no
more of them. Indeed for the matter of that, I have seen Belus,
my cousin and your companion, who having studied in Egypt among
the Greeks, knows more than do most of those in Babylon, who
doctor men according to their reading of the stars or the
divinations of those who consult omens."</p>

<p>"What did Belus tell you, O King?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Friend. He bade me open my robe and set his ear
against my naked breast and listened to my heart. Then he shook
his head and was silent and I knew that the day of my fate was
upon me."</p>

<p>"May the King live for ever!" I murmured in the accustomed
form, not knowing what else to say.</p>

<p>"Aye," he answered smiling, "so long as it is not in another
Babylon beyond the Gates of Darkness. Friend, I must go as all
these have gone," and he pointed to the statues of dead monarchs
that stood about the room and to the writings sealed with their
seals. "I will tell you the truth. I am glad to go, though I must
be stripped of all my pomp and power and pass naked to whence I
came."</p>

<p>He paused a while, then went on,</p>

<p>"Egyptian, they say that dying eyes see far, and certainly I
see much woe coming upon Babylon, or at the least upon her kings.
Have you not heard of Cyrus the Persian?"</p>

<p>I bent my head.</p>

<p>"And have you heard that this great man, for he is great, has
but now defeated Belshazzar my son at Opis and threatens
Zippar?"</p>

<p>"I have not heard it, O King."</p>

<p>"Yet it is so, for swift posts have brought the news.
Doubtless soon his armies will threaten Babylon, aye, and as I
think, take it, for both the people and the army hate the Prince,
my son, and will fight for him but feebly, making an end of my
House and its rule, and perchance of the ancient city, queen of
the world, also."</p>

<p>Again he paused, and presently continued,</p>

<p>"If so, she has brought it on her own head, for I tell you,
Egyptian, that Babylon is evil; aye, she is a bladder filled with
sin and the blood of peoples, a bladder waiting to be pricked.
Belshazzar, too," he added with passion, "my son who already
rules the empire in all but name, is an evil man. From his
boyhood up he has been turbulent, lustful, cruel and bloody, one
who wades through death to his desires, a tyrant, a betrayer of
his friends. Moreover it is too late for him to change who is
past his fiftieth year. How long will the gods bear with such a
man? Against our foes he might fight, for the empire still is
mighty, but can he fight the enemies in his own house? I tell you
the people murmur against him and the nobles plot to overthrow
him when I am gone. So let me go where, being innocent, I hope
for peace. Blessed are the dead for they sleep, or if they wake,
of earth and its troubles they know no more."</p>

<p>Thus he spoke in a voice that grew faint and yet fainter till
it ended in a kind of wail and died into silence, so that I
thought he was about to swoon. But it was not so, for presently
he recovered his strength and said,</p>

<p>"I talk much of myself as is the fashion of the aged, and of
what I fear or feel, forgetting that others also have evils to
bear and face. You for example, Friend. Let me think, what were
they? Oh! I remember. That beauteous woman whom the dog Amasis
tried to palm off on me as a princess of Egypt, but who, it
seems, is a private lady and your wife, or so you and Belus
swear. I hear she swears it also, but in such matters none can
believe what comes out of a woman's mouth. The business is
unhappy. Could I have my will, you might take her at once and
welcome, but here I face a rock which even the king cannot move,
namely the law concerning the ladies of the royal household on
which one might think that the whole empire of Babylon was built.
Moreover someone is at work in this matter, for when on your
behalf and hers, that old prophet of Judah put it into my mind to
try to find a way round this rock, all paths were blocked, I know
not by whom."</p>

<p>"Perhaps by the Prince Belshazzar," I hazarded.</p>

<p>"It may be so; indeed it is very likely, for Belshazzar is
always coveting this one or that, even though they be of his
father's household, at any rate in name. Well, I say that the way
is blocked and if I tried to force a path, the priests would stir
as though an insult had been done to their gods. Yes, there would
be scandals and talk of impiety by an unbelieving king, that
would serve the purpose of the plotters against my House among
the vulgar, and I know not what besides. So nothing can be
done."</p>

<p>"That is sad for me and my wife," I said sighing.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, though it it strange that it should be so.
There are so many women in the world that it seems foolish for a
man to break his heart over any one of them, when doubtless a
fairer awaits him in the next street. Also there is hope in the
case. Much trouble has arisen about this lady with Egypt against
whom, because of her, Babylon has threatened war. Now Amasis the
Pharaoh pretending to be insulted and believing you, the husband,
to be dead,&mdash;I thought it well for your own sake to tell him
that the man who bore forged letters to Cyrus of whom he warned
us, had been caught and executed as a spy&mdash;demands that his
daughter, as he calls her, should be sent back to him with a
great present of gold. Yet this cannot be done for the reason I
have told you, namely that she has been taken into the royal
household."</p>

<p>"Then it seems there is an end, O King."</p>

<p>"Not so, for have I not told you, Friend, that even in Babylon
kings do not live for ever. When I die my household is dissolved,
at least after a time, and I shall die soon. Therefore because
you are a brother scholar who has solaced my last months I have
made a plan to serve you. As this lady and I have never met but
once and that in open court, I have issued a royal decree that
immediately upon my death she shall be set at liberty and sent
back to Egypt with all her belongings and a gift. Moreover I have
appointed that you, under the name of Ptahmes by which you are
called here, for none know you to be her husband, and Belus shall
accompany her, as you also wish to return to Egypt in safety,
though if you are wise neither of you will set foot in that land
while Amasis reigns. No, when you have crossed the borders of
this country and are free, you will turn and fly whither you
will, out of reach of Amasis and of Belshazzar.</p>

<p>"There, that is all. I am weary. The decree has been
registered in due form, sealed with my own seal, and you will
find a copy of it in your lodgings, for it was given to Belus
only to-day that it might not miscarry. Farewell, Friend. Your
theory of the beginning of the gods is most wise and pregnant;
soon I shall learn whether it be true. Farewell and may all good
fortune be yours. When you are as old as I am, think sometimes of
Nabonidus whom they called a king, but who knew himself to be a
ruler of nothing, no, not even of his own heart. Ho! chamberlain,
take me hence, I would sleep."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap17"></a>CHAPTER 17<br>

AT THE WESTERN GATE</h2>

<p class="first">
WHAT Nabonidus promised me, he performed. In my lodgings I
found Belus waiting with the writings under the royal seal,
whereby he and I were given safe conduct to leave Babylon when we
would and go whither we would, which writings all the officers of
the empire were commanded to obey. In them, however, nothing was
said concerning Myra. I asked Belus what this meant and whether I
had been tricked. He answered no, for other writings had been
sent to the prophet Daniel or Belteshazzar, as he knew from his
own lips, commanding him so soon as the news of the death of the
king should reach him, to hand over Myra, with her woman named
Metep, to an escort charged to conduct her to the frontiers of
the land and there leave her to await the coming of another
escort from Egypt.</p>

<p>I listened and answered that I liked the plan little.</p>

<p>Where, I asked, must we meet Myra and how were we to know when
she left the prophet's house? Also, even if all should go well,
what would happen when we came to the frontiers of the empire,
where perhaps she would fall into the power of Egyptians waiting
to receive her, and I with her. If so, our case would be even
worse than it was before.</p>

<p>"Ramose," answered Belus, "we wander in the darkness of night
and must follow the only star that we can see. Like you, neither
the prophet nor I think well of this plan. Yet if we do not act
upon it, which way can we turn? It is certain that while the king
lives, not even he can command that Myra should be sent from
Babylon."</p>

<p>"Why not?" I asked angrily.</p>

<p>"I think that he has told you himself, namely, because he
whose duty it is to administer the law, must not break the law.
Moreover, if he gave the order it would not be obeyed, because
under these same ancient statutes any man who touches or holds
converse with a lady of the royal household, is criminal, an
outcast to be slain by whoever can or will. Once the king is dead
it is otherwise, for the edicts which he has signed must be
fulfilled, unless indeed they are revoked by other edicts of the
new king."</p>

<p>"Which will surely happen, Belus."</p>

<p>"Aye, it will happen&mdash;if there is time. For as I have
heard from a sure source, Belshazzar when in his cups gave out
that so soon as he had power he would certainly take this
Egyptian Myra whom it was the pleasure of the king his father to
keep from him, and whom therefore he desired more than any woman
in the world. Indeed he is foolish about the matter, having been
smitten by the sight of her beauty when she appeared at the court
as though by a sword, and, as he says, wounded through the heart.
Certainly had it not been for the law as to the King's wives, and
still more because of his fear of the prophet in whose holy
charge she is, already he would have seized and smuggled her
away."</p>

<p>"Then this he will surely do as soon as the king is dead,
Belus."</p>

<p>"Aye&mdash;I repeat, if he has time. But should Nabonidus die
soon, Belshazzar is not in Babylon. With the remainder of his
great army he is in Zippar that Cyrus besieges. There perhaps he
may be killed or made prisoner, or many things may happen. Also
Nabonidus is not yet dead. He may pass at any minute, or he may
live for months, as men suffering from the heart sometimes do.
Everything is dark and doubtful. Still we must be prepared to act
at any moment. Therefore let us forget our fears and go
straightforward, though for my part," he added darkly, "I do not
believe that fate will take me from Babylon till a certain doom
has been accomplished."</p>

<p>This then we did who could find no better counsel, putting our
faith in the goodness of God, and trusting that we should find
help in our need.</p>

<p>Having wealth at our command we bought swift horses and hired
servants, faithful men of Israelite descent and free citizens who
could go where they would and who desired to leave Babylon, which
men and horses we kept at hand in a safe place near to the
western gate whence we must start for Egypt. Also Belus devised a
scheme which provided that Metep should hang a cloth from a
window of the prophet's house, telling us when her mistress was
about to leave so that we might be ready to start to join her.
And many other things we did that need not be told.</p>

<p>At length Nabonidus died very suddenly. From the time that I
had last seen him he had kept his bed, sleeping a great deal and
paying no heed to anybody or anything that passed, till on a
certain afternoon he rose, saying that he felt quite well again,
and went to his favourite chamber, that in which I was wont to
visit him. Here while he was walking up and down, some message
was brought to him by one of the great officers, of which all we
could learn was that it had to do with Belshazzar and the Persian
war. Whether the news was good or ill I do not know, but this is
certain, that Nabonidus said aloud,</p>

<p>"It is the will of God. My day of fate has come."</p>

<p>Then he set his hand upon his heart, fell down, groaned once,
and died.</p>

<p>Such was the end of this weak but honest and kindly man, a
scholar of whom to his sorrow destiny had made a king over a
doomed empire. In one thing at least Heaven was good to him, he
did not live to see it fall.</p>

<p>Having bribed certain eunuchs and a scribe, Belus and I were
among the first, if not the very first, to know that all was
over, that is, save the prophet who learned it in his spirit as
he learned many things. Instantly we rushed to the appointed
place where our horses and goods awaited us, whence we could see
the house of Daniel and watch. Presently at a window appeared a
white cloth showing us that there too all was known and that Myra
was about to start with her escort.</p>

<p>This was the plan&mdash;that we should stand to one side till
she had passed the gate, and follow with our men to the first
camping place, where we could discover ourselves to the captain
of the escort who had been warned that we should join him. Having
authority under the seal of the late king and his vizier that we
could show, if there were need, this, we thought, would be easy,
especially as the death of Nabonidus was not known in the city
and perhaps might be kept from the people for hours&mdash;or
days.</p>

<p>We came to the gate as the sun began to sink, and waited as
though for some friend or other merchants to join us there, for
we were disguised as traders. At length through the gloom, which
gathered very quickly that night, because after some days of
terrible heat the sky was full of thunderclouds which were about
to burst, with beating hearts we saw a company coming down the
street towards the gate that pierced the mighty wall of Babylon.
A captain rode ahead of it, then came soldiers, a dozen or more
of them, and in their midst mounted upon white mules two veiled
women, one tall and graceful as a reed, the other short and thick
in body, at the sight of whom my heart leapt for I knew them to
be Myra and old Metep. After these followed other mules and asses
laden with baggage, tents and so forth, and accompanied by
servants. As they passed us I saw the tall lady turn as though to
stare at me through her veil. Then I was sure that Myra had seen
and knew me, and bent my head a little, which she answered by
bending hers.</p>

<p>To-night, I thought to myself with joy, we may speak together
in some camp, if no more. To-night our troubles may be over and
our long separation ended.</p>

<p>At that moment, while my heart was filled with this happy
dream, came the first flash of the storm. Like a sword of fire it
seemed to strike the watch towers set upon the crest of the wall
high above us, and in a line of blinding light passed down the
pillar of one of the inner brazen gates into the earth, with a
noise and a shock that caused the horses of the officer and some
of the soldiers to wheel round and charge back among those that
followed. Confusion came, and shoutings, for all believed that
men had been killed by the flame from heaven, whereas in fact one
or two had been unhorsed &mdash;no more. Then the clamour was
covered and lost by the crash of thunder pealing overhead. It
died away and for a little while there was silence, through which
I heard the officer rallying his men with words of command; no
easy matter, for they were entangled with the baggage animals
whose drivers were frightened and knew not what to do.</p>

<p>Then I heard something else, namely, the sound of a horse
galloping. The lightning flashed again piercing the gloom. It
shone upon the gilded armour of a captain of the royal bodyguard
riding at full speed who, as he passed me, cried,</p>

<p>"The King is dead. Ho! Warden, shut the gates that none may
make it known to the enemies of Babylon!"</p>

<p>The officer in charge of the escort heard and strove to press
forward through the long archway of the wall before he was cut
off. Too late! With a great clashing, worked by their engines,
the outer gates of bronze swung home in front of him. He called
for the warden of the gates and showed him a writing which it was
too dark to read. They wrangled together as Belus and I, who with
our people had followed them into the archway, could hear. There
was great disorder. Some pressed forward and some pressed back,
for all who could had rushed into the tunnel to escape the
lightnings and the heavy rain that began to fall. Men thrust,
horses neighed and trampled, moving to and fro and mingled
together. Presently I found myself by the side of a figure clad
in white which jostled against me.</p>

<p>"Your pardon," said a gentle voice, and I knew it for that of
Myra!</p>

<p>"Myra," I whispered, "it is I&mdash;Ramose!"</p>

<p>"Oh! my love, my love," she whispered back, and next moment I
had bent down and was kissing her upon the lips, cursing the veil
that lay between us. Yes, and she was kissing me. But one kiss
and it was done, for we were thrust apart again.</p>

<p>The tumult and wrangling increased. The officer in charge of
Myra's escort demanded that the gates should be opened and
threatened the wardens. A loud voice cried,</p>

<p>"In the name of Belshazzar, King of Babylon, it is commanded
that none leave Babylon."</p>

<p>Between the bellowings of the thunder I heard the clattering
of horses' hoofs and chariot wheels. Again a voice cried,</p>

<p>"A woman of the royal household escapes. Seize her!" words at
which my blood ran cold.</p>

<p>Another voice answered,</p>

<p>"They are here&mdash;two of them!"</p>

<p>Armed men rushed upon the mob. The escort gathered round Myra
and Metep, whose white dresses could be seen dimly through the
gloom and more clearly when the lightning flashed. I and my
people did likewise. Swords were drawn; there was confused
fighting. A huge black man in brazen armour seized Myra's mule by
the bridle and began to drag it back towards the street; Metep
screamed; soldiers cursed. I attacked the black man. He smote at
me and missed, I thrust my sword through his throat and he fell,
dead or dying. Others seized the woman; the scene in that narrow
place as the lightning showed it, was terrible. All shouted, all
smote scarcely knowing at whom they smote, while Metep still
screamed long and loud. My horse was thrust back against the bars
of the gate, plunging and kicking. Someone struck me on the head,
I think with a club, causing me to drop my sword and almost
stunning me. When my wits came again I was outside the archway in
the narrow street whither my horse had borne me, following
others.</p>

<p>The storm raged more fiercely than before and the rain poured
down. Far up the street I saw soldiers retreating and in the
midst of them two figures in white. The lightning showed them
clearly, also many men in flight. In the darkness that followed
the flash someone approached and a voice spoke. It was that of
Belus.</p>

<p>"All is finished, Ramose," he said. "The guards of the
household of Belshazzar have snatched away Myra. Come now quickly
before we are known to have taken part in this tumult, else we
shall be seized and slain. I have told our servants where they
may find us."</p>

<p>Still dazed by the blow I followed him, who knowing the city
from boyhood, led me through a maze of streets where none was
stirring because of the great storm and the darkness of the
falling night. After us came our servants, or most of them, and
the laden beasts.</p>

<p>"Where have they taken Myra?" I asked with a groan.</p>

<p>"Doubtless to Belshazzar's palace," he answered. "Yet be
comforted. He is not in Babylon. She has been seized because of
commands which he left with his great officers who have watched
the prophet's house day and night lest she should escape."</p>

<p>"A curse is on us," I muttered. "We are dogged by evil.
Another hour and we had been free. Could not your spells have
protected us for one hour, Belus?"</p>

<p>"The tale is not yet finished," he answered quietly. "Mayhap
this evil has protected us from greater that we do not see.
Mayhap it is appointed that we still have work to do in Babylon,
whither I at least must have returned even if we had escaped
to-night, though this I hid from you."</p>

<p>"Have done!" I exclaimed fiercely. "Myra is in the house of
Belshazzar and who can save her now?"</p>

<p>"God," he answered and was silent.</p>

<p>"Whither go we&mdash;to our lodgings?" I asked presently.</p>

<p>"Nay, it would not be safe. We go to that house whence once
you looked upon a garden. It is the prophet's and holy ground
which none dares violate, not even Belshazzar, because he
believes that to do so would bring a curse and perhaps death upon
him. Had it been otherwise Myra would have been seized long
ago."</p>

<p>So, broken in spirit for all seemed lost, once again I entered
that Hebrew guest-house by the secret way, not caring whether or
no I were dragged from it to my death. Indeed I was as a little
child and did what Belus bade me, asking no questions. He managed
all, finding lodging for the men in the outbuildings of the
house, bringing food and I know not what besides.</p>

<p>That night the prophet came to us. I looked up from the stool
on which I was seated, my head resting on my hand and saw him
standing before me, tall, black-robed, thin-faced, dark-eyed,
white-haired; more like a ghost than a man. I would have risen to
bow to him, but he stayed me with his hand.</p>

<p>"You are weary," he said, "and smitten to the heart. Rest
where you are and listen. All seems to have gone awry. The lady
Myra, my ward, has been snatched away and now, as I have sure
tidings, is a prisoner among the women of Belshazzar, and in his
own palace which once was that of Nebuchadnezzar the great king.
Nor, good old Nabonidus being dead, can I take her hence, for
none so much as reads the edicts of departed kings. Who prays to
the sun that is set?"</p>

<p>"How did it happen, Prophet?" I asked wearily.</p>

<p>"This house was watched," he answered. "From the beginning
Belshazzar, the woman-hunter, having once seen her beauty,
determined to possess himself of Myra if ever she passed my doors
which all Babylonians hold inviolate. When she went forth spies
reported it to his officers, or perhaps the hour of her going was
already known through some traitor. If so, here and now I call
down upon him the wrath of God," and he lifted his hand to
heaven, then bowed his head, muttering some words.</p>

<p>"At least she was taken, as you saw, for as is common the
tidings of the death of a king, the guardians closed the gates,
which they must do. Nor would it have helped if she had passed
them, for she would have been followed and seized, and you with
her. As it is, both you and Belus have escaped because you were
not noted in the darkness of the archway as having fought against
the guards of Belshazzar, aye, and slew their captain. Therefore
you are safe here and in sanctuary where none dares to set a foot
lest the curse of Jehovah should fall upon him, and here you must
bide till all is accomplished."</p>

<p>"What will happen to Myra?" I asked.</p>

<p>"At present&mdash;nothing, save that she will be fed on
sweet-meats, perfumed with scents and purified, according to the
custom of these Babylonian hogs with women who are dedicate to
the king. Then, at such time as he shall appoint, she will be
offered to him, as a lamb is offered upon an altar, and if she
pleases him, be set high in his household, perhaps upon the
throne itself."</p>

<p>Hearing these horrible words I went mad. I raved; I cursed;
yes, I reviled this Daniel or Belteshazzar.</p>

<p>"You are reported a great prophet," I said, "one who worships
a just and mighty god that even the Babylonians revere, although
he be but the lord of a conquered, captive people. Yet you tell
me that such a crime will be worked upon an innocent woman
because she is accursed with great loveliness, by a king who is
but a brute in human shape. If your god and hers be a true god,
as they say Nebuchadnezzar held he was, let him manifest himself
and save her, his servant. Then I will worship him whom otherwise
I name but another idol."</p>

<p>The prophet looked at me and smiled, a strange and quiet
smile.</p>

<p>"Poor man!" he said. "What do you know of God and of His ways?
This day by the gate you slew a gallant soldier who did but obey
his orders to capture certain persons. He had committed no sin.
He knew nothing of this business, yet God suffered that you
should drive your sword through His throat and bring him down to
death unavenged, for in that darkness none saw who smote
him."</p>

<p>"Did you see?" I asked angrily.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, with the eyes of my spirit. Or perhaps I learned it
otherwise. It matters nothing. At least God commanded that he
should be slain, we know not why. So God has commanded that this
woman of my people who is your wife, should be captured, we know
not why. Yet it may please Him to save her at the last, or it may
not please Him. Let the scroll of fate unroll itself at the
appointed time and bow your head before what is written
there."</p>

<p>Then he lifted his hand as though in blessing and
departed.</p>

<p>So it came about that I took up my abode with those servants
whom we had hired, citizens of Babylon but all of them of the
Israelite faith, who, after what had happened at the gateway,
thought that they would be safest here until they could leave the
city with me, or otherwise. But although he often came to visit
me at night, Belus dwelt elsewhere with friends of his own, now
in one place, now in another. When I asked him why, all he would
say was that it must be so, adding darkly that he was a marked
man with many enemies, and now that Nabonidus was dead, if we
consorted together I should be marked also.</p>

<p>For my part I was but little known and so long as I remained
under the shelter of the prophet's roof, one who would not be
harmed, unless by evil fortune the King's Council heard that it
was I who had killed the officer of the guard while attempting to
aid the escape of the beautiful Egyptian.</p>

<p>So guessing that Belus had other reasons as well as those
which he set out, I let the matter be, though in truth my life in
this place was very sad and lonely with no companion save my own
thoughts which were black enough. I did not dare to go abroad for
the prophet forbade it, and of the few learned men and royal
servants whom I had met in Babylon while I waited on Nabonidus,
none came to visit me. Indeed either I was forgotten, or believed
to be dead, or to have departed.</p>

<p>In Babylon not many strangers were remembered even for a month
among the thousands from all countries who came and went on the
business of their trades, or to visit the temples, or study the
wonders of the mightiest city of the earth. Also, now that
Nabonidus was dead, his court was dispersed and his great palace
in which alone my face had been seen, stood empty, for that of
Belshazzar, the new king, was in another quarter of the city.
Therefore I was quite unknown, for as Belus told me, the company
that had captured us on our road from Damascus had, it chanced,
been sent upon duty to a distant part of the empire.</p>

<p>From time to time the prophet visited me and we talked
together. I told him the history of my life and in his grave and
gentle voice he instructed me in many matters, especially in the
faith and nature of the God he worshipped. Through His strength,
he said, he interpreted dreams and worked marvels, which caused
him to be feared of the Babylonians from the days of
Nebuchadnezzar and, although they were jealous of his magic as
they held it to be, bowed down to by the magicians and
interpreters of dreams as one greater than they. So earnestly did
he instruct me and with such power, that at length I, who all my
life had searched for a true God and been able to find none, came
to accept Him of Daniel, as indeed I think it was in his mind
that I should do. Thus it came about that in the presence of
certain of the captive Israelites I, although of another race,
was admitted to the company of the worshippers of Jehovah. To
that faith, rejecting all the multitude of the gods of Greece and
Egypt, I hold to-day.</p>

<p>For the rest, thenceforward that holy prophet treated me as
one dear to him, one to whom he could open some if not all of the
doors of his secret heart. He gave me sacred books to read and
expounded their mysteries. Filled with fire from Heaven he
repeated prophecies, whether his own or those of other seers I do
not know, that foretold the fall of Babylon, Queen of the
world.</p>

<p>"Behold all this," he said, pointing to the glittering city
that on every side stretched further than the eye could see, to
its towering temples and its vast encircling walls. "I say,
Ramose, that of it not one brick shall remain upon another; it
shall be a wilderness where shepherds feed their flocks by day
and the lions prowl at night; an abode of death for ever. The
curse of God hangs over Babylon."</p>

<p>Once more I became a recluse as I had been at Cyprus, more so
indeed, for then I heard the voice of the infant Myra prattling
about the house and busied myself with my trade. Now I studied
alone, or walked in the garden where once I had seen Myra and
been tempted to break my oath, thinking and dreaming till, had it
not been for a certain comfort which flowed to me from that quiet
prophet and from the new faith he had taught me, I believe my
heart would have broken. Even so I grew pale and thin, as he
noted, for often I saw him watching me, after which he would
speak hopeful words, bidding me to take heart because all that is
hidden is not lost.</p>

<p>From Myra no whisper reached me. She had vanished into the
secret courts of the frowning palace of Belshazzar where, when he
was in Babylon, he held his orgies, and the world saw her no
more. If the prophet knew aught of her fate he hid it from me.
From Egypt, too, no news came, though much I wondered what had
passed there and what had chanced to the mother who had treated
me so ill, and to the plotting Pharaoh who had made a tool of me
hoping that I should return no more.</p>

<p>So except for the rare visits of Belus, who to me appeared
changed and bent down beneath the weight of hidden business of
which he would not speak, and for the converse of the prophet who
seemed more of an angel than a man, from day to day I dwelt quite
alone, feeding my heart on hope that grew ever fainter and
strengthening my soul as best I might with prayer.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap18"></a>CHAPTER 18<br>

THE LETTER</h2>

<p class="first">
ONE night when I sat brooding in my chamber at the guest-house
of the prophet, playing with food that I could not eat, a servant
opened the door and through it came Belus. With much joy I rose
to greet him whom I had not seen for many days, for always I
longed for his company in my loneliness, but without taking the
hand I offered him, he sank upon a couch, saying,</p>

<p>"If you have wine, give it me."</p>

<p>I filled him a cup unmixed with water. He swallowed it and
asked for more which he drank also. As he did so his dark cloak
fell open and I saw that beneath it his tunic was stained with
blood and that a short sword thrust through his girdle, for its
scabbard seemed to have been lost, was likewise still wet with
blood.</p>

<p>"Whence do you come?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Out of the jaws of death," he answered. "Certain of my
friends and I were supping together when the door burst
open&mdash;doubtless it was some traitor's work&mdash;and a
number of soldiers rushed into the room. An officer summoned us
to surrender in the name of Belshazzar the King, calling out the
names of most there present, and mine among them.</p>

<p>"'Would you work sacrilege against the gods and their
priests?' cried one of us, for we were supping in chamber of the
temple where none but the ordained might enter.</p>

<p>"'The King of the God of gods. Obey the King or die!' shouted
the officer.</p>

<p>"He spoke no more, for a man of our company, I know not who,
hurled a knife, or a sword, with such strength and so true an aim
that it pierced that captain from breast to back and he fell down
dead. Then began the fight. We were well armed and wore corselets
beneath our robes, for we knew that we went in peril; also we
were desperate who did not desire to die by torment.</p>

<p>"We cast the flagons and the stools in their faces, aye, and
the burning lamps. We leapt upon them like lions. We slew them,
though of us, too, some were slain. We hurled them, living or
dead, from the window-places to fall a hundred cubits and be
crushed at the foot of the temple towers to make food for
jackals. Then we scattered and fled and here I am, bloody but
unhurt."</p>

<p>"And what now, Belus?" I asked. "Do you seek sanctuary with
the prophet?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I seek horses and men to ride with me, also a bag of
gold, for my lodgings will be watched and I dare not return to
them."</p>

<p>"These you can have, Belus, for they are here. But whither go
you? Back towards Egypt?"</p>

<p>"Not so. I go&mdash;" here he bent forward and whispered in my
ear&mdash;"I go to Cyrus the Persian who advances upon Babylon
the accursed. I go to tell him that her gates will open to him
and that if he will but purge her of her rulers and punish their
iniquities, the millions of the people will welcome him. Do not
stare, Ramose. What I say is true. Not in vain have I worked for
all these moons to fulfil the decrees of God upon Belshazzar the
murderer, and his evil counsellors."</p>

<p>"Oh! that I might go with you," I said.</p>

<p>"Nay, you must bide here where none knows what may happen.
They say that Zippar is about to fall, but I hear also that
Belshazzar purposes to desert his army and slipping away like a
snake, to return to Babylon which he believes impregnable, hoping
for help from Egypt and thinking that before its walls Cyrus and
his Persians will certainly be destroyed. Therefore if Belshazzar
comes to Babylon you must be here, for then who knows what will
chance to Myra who is captive in his palace?"</p>

<p>"Who knows indeed?" I moaned, "and alas! how can I help
her?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say, but doubtless there is a road. I read of it in
the stars, though God alone can point it out. Now I go to speak
with the prophet. Do you bid them make the horses
ready&mdash;four horses and three men."</p>

<p>"How will you pass the gates?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The gates of Babylon are open to me," he said darkly and
glided from the room.</p>

<p>Belus went out of my sight and knowledge. Day followed day,
moons waxed and waned and I heard no more of him, nor whether he
were dead or living, or had fled to some other land. Now I was
quite alone and save my servants and sometimes the prophet, I saw
no man. Of him I asked, what had become of Belus and if he had
heard aught of the fray in the temple of which I have spoken. He
answered that he did not know where Belus was, but he believed
him to be still alive, for he thought that if he were dead some
voice which have told him so in his sleep, a saying which
comforted me who knew that this prophet was not as are other men,
but one who communed with Heaven and to whom from time to time,
Heaven gave tidings.</p>

<p>"As regards the fray in the temple," he went on, "I have
naught to say, if I know anything. To all tales of conspiracies I
shut my ears. Why should I heed them? Men think that they do this
or that, but it is God Who works through them. Therefore I await
the decrees of God and watch for the falling of His sword. What
He reveals to me I know, to all else my ears are shut."</p>

<p>I bowed my head, being sure that to dispute with him was
useless; as soon would I have attempted to reason with a spirit.
Then I inquired of him whether I might now go abroad, seeing that
all must have forgotten me.</p>

<p>He answered somewhat sternly,</p>

<p>"Did I not tell you, Ramose, that here and nowhere else you
are safe. Here then bide and be patient."</p>

<p>So I obeyed him; only I did this, knowing that if it were not
lawful he would forbid me. Finding that a steep and narrow stair
led to the roof of the tall house, I went up it and often sat
there, crouching behind the parapet in the daytime and leaning
over it at night when I could not be seen from below. This house
stood very high, being built upon a mound where once, perhaps,
was a palace or a temple now long fallen except for some walls of
which I have written. Therefore from its roof I could see much of
Babylon; its great buildings, its open places, its gardens, its
soaring towers, its embracing walls, Nimitti-Bel, the outer wall
like to which there is no other in the world, and Ingue-Bel the
inner wall, both of them held to be impregnable, its citadel
rising from an enormous platform of dried bricks between the two;
its temples of Enurta, Marduk and Ishtar with its lovely gate;
its thousand streets where all day multitudes moved up and down,
the great river Euphrates to the west and among its many royal
dwellings, the vast palace of Nebuchadnezzar where Belshazzar had
made his home.</p>

<p>It was on this palace that always I fixed my eyes, for I knew
that up its steps guarded by statues of gods and demons, Myra had
been borne and that somewhere in its courts she dwelt, lonelier
and perchance more afraid, if that were possible, than even I,
her husband. Night by night I would watch the cressets flaring
upon its walls, wondering what passed there and throwing out my
heart to the captive whom they hid. But alas! no answer came. Had
she been in Egypt, had she been in Hades, she could not have
seemed further from me, or more lost.</p>

<p>In the daytime, too, I stared at the streets and places where
people gathered, and noted, or so I thought, a change in the
demeanour of these people. They seemed more hurried than they
were wont to be; they stopped and spoke to each other, head close
to head, like folk who tell each other tidings that must not be
overheard; or they gathered into knots and crowds in the squares
and open places and were addressed by officers. Then troops would
come and disperse them and they fled sullenly, sometimes leaving
certain of their number on the ground dead or wounded, whom
slaves or watchmen bore away on stretchers. Certainly all was not
well in Babylon.</p>

<p>Among the servants who were left to me after the departure of
Belus, was a man called Obil, an Israelite by descent, though a
citizen of Babylon, a quiet man who seldom spoke unless he was
spoken to, but one to whom I took a liking and learned to trust,
as indeed the prophet had told me I might do, for he was of his
faith, that had become mine also. This Obil often went abroad in
Babylon, especially at night, and having friends there, gathered
much tidings.</p>

<p>When I discovered this I began to speak with him apart and
learned many things. He told me that great fear had come upon
Babylon, partly because of the war with Persia which, it was
rumoured, went very ill, and partly because of the dark sayings
of the magicians and astrologers who prophesied evil at
hand&mdash;much evil, and the wrath of God about to fall upon the
ancient city.</p>

<p>Listening to these tales I wondered to myself whether Belus
had been one of the astrologers who spread abroad this prophecy.
Then I asked what of Belshazzar and whether the people loved him
as they did Nabonidus the Peaceful, although him the priests did
not love because he meddled with their gods.</p>

<p>"Of Belshazzar, Master," said Obil, "the news is that he is
still with the army at Zippar, yet not so closely invested by the
Persians that he cannot send messages daily, sometimes by word of
mouth and sometimes in writing, to his officers in Babylon; yes,
even about small matters," he added with meaning. "I know it, for
the sister of one of the messengers is a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"What kind of small matters?" I asked as carelessly as I
could.</p>

<p>"Well, for example, Master, such as that which has to do with
the lady who came from Egypt to be of the late king's household,
and who afterwards was sent to the prophet's house by the royal
command; the same with whom we were to travel when the gates were
shut upon us on that night of storm and there was fighting in the
gateway."</p>

<p>Now my blood ran cold, but turning my head to hide my face I
asked again,</p>

<p>"And why does Belshazzar send messages about this lady, Obil?
Did your friend's sister tell you that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Master, she did and the reason is very strange, though I
who in my time have served in the households of the great lords
of the earth and watched their ways, know that it is true. Kings
and princes and others of their kind, Master, have everything at
their command; power which some desire; wealth which most desire,
and especially women whom all desire if they be really men.
Therefore having all, they become sated like gorged brutes, and
of the fair women that are offered to them continually few catch
their fancy. Now and again, however, they see one for whom they
would give half their kingdom, especially if it be not lawful
that they should take her, or if they know that for this reason
or for that she turns from them.</p>

<p>"Such it seems is what has happened in the case of Belshazzar
and the lady from Egypt who is named Myra. He saw her at the
court when old Nabonidus, the late king, being moved by her
wondrous beauty, descended from his throne and publicly received
her to himself. That was before this lady told Nabonidus, as I
heard with my own ears being then a servant of the court, that
she was no princess of Egypt; also that she was already married
to a man from whom she had been stolen. Perhaps you have been
told the story, Master."</p>

<p>"Yes, Obil, and I have learned that thereon Nabonidus
committed her to the charge of our great prophet whose sanctuary
none dares to violate, and we know the rest."</p>

<p>"That is so. Still, part of this story may be new to you, if
my friend's sister tells it truly. Not even Belshazzar dares to
violate the sanctuary of the holy prophet of Israel whom he fears
above any man that lives, because like Nebuchadnezzar before him,
he believes him to be almost a god. Yet he caused it to be
watched by many spies and gave strict command to his officers,
for which they must answer with their lives, that if the lady
came out of that sanctuary, even by order of the king his father,
she should be seized and carried to his palace, there to be given
to him when he returns. This, Master, as you know, was done."</p>

<p>"Is this all that your friend's sister told you, Obil?"</p>

<p>"No, Master. It appears that Belshazzar who now is king, has
been smitten with a madness concerning this fair woman, so that
he thinks more of her than he does of the war with the Persians
or any other matter, which madness has increased greatly since a
rumour has reached him that the man to whom she was married, is
not in Egypt but hidden in Babylon. This is his desire&mdash;to
find that man and cause him to be tormented to death before her
very eyes and while he lies dying, to appear and drag her away.
For such, Master, are the royal pleasures of great kings."</p>

<p>"Does he know this man's name, Obil?"</p>

<p>"According to my friend's sister who seems to hear all
secrets, he is not sure of the name, but he believes the man to
be Belus, also known as Azar, an enemy of his own to whom he
worked some injury in the past, and by birth a great lord of
Babylon; he who appeared before Nabonidus and told a tale as to
this lady being wed to a noble of Egypt. At the last, although he
is not sure whether he be the man, he seeks everywhere for Belus,
that he may capture him and put him to the question, or failing
that, kill him outright."</p>

<p>"As nearly chanced the other day," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, Master, but Belus escaped him and now has left Babylon
with some of our people, upon a mission of his own."</p>

<p>"Why did you not go with him, seeing that it was Belus who
hired you and not I?" I asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Perhaps because I was otherwise commanded, or because I
thought I might be of more service elsewhere," he replied, bowing
his head.</p>

<p>I thought a moment, then I turned and spoke words that seemed
to be put into my mind.</p>

<p>"Obil," I said, "you know more than you pretend; you know that
<i>I</i> am the husband of the lady Myra, not Belus, and all my
case."</p>

<p>"Yes, Master, I know these things, for I have been told them
under an oath that may not be broken if I would avoid death in
this world and save my soul in any that is to come. We worship
the same God and therefore he who betrays his brother, betrays
his God."</p>

<p>"Who told you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Belus told me. In his youth he was my father's friend,
therefore he trusts me and hired me to go upon that journey which
has not been accomplished. Afterwards, knowing that he might be
called away, he told me all, bidding me to serve you and another
to the death."</p>

<p>Now I bethought me that this Obil whom it pleased to play the
part of a servant, was more than he seemed and that doubtless he
had his share in the dark conspiracies of Belus, but of this
matter I said nothing.</p>

<p>"Does the prophet know that you have my secret?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The prophet knows all, for God tells him."</p>

<p>I thought a while. For good or ill I was in this man's power
no matter what I did or left undone. He had learned my secret
from Belus or another, and if it pleased him, could betray me, or
leave me unbetrayed. My crime was that I had married Myra whom
the mighty king of Babylon desired, and for that, if I were
caught, I must die; it could not be added to by aught that I did,
or lessened by aught that I left undone. Therefore I would be
bold.</p>

<p>"Can you help me, Obil?"</p>

<p>"How, Master."</p>

<p>"By causing it to come to the ears of a certain lady that a
certain man still waits in Babylon hoping for the best, and by
bringing tidings to me of her, under her own hand if may be, that
I may know that they are true."</p>

<p>"It is dangerous, Master, and yet I have friends in the
palace, aye, even among the eunuchs, and if you desire it I will
try who am bidden to serve you in all things. Yet blame me not if
aught goes wrong."</p>

<p>"I shall not blame you," I answered, "and&mdash;oh! no longer
can I endure this silence. I must hear, I must learn, or I think
that I shall die."</p>

<p>"I will do what I may," said Obil, and turned to go.</p>

<p>"Do so, Friend, and whether you succeed or fail, be sure that
if ever I come safe out of this accursed city I will make you
rich. Meanwhile take what gold you want. You know where it
is."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Master, who desire to rest in some far land, at
Jerusalem if it may be, and whose substance has been stolen by
Babylonians because I am of a race they hate."</p>

<p>Then he went.</p>

<p>Four nights later Obil appeared as I finished my evening meal
and slipped a clay tablet into my hand. I glanced at it who could
read the Babylonian writing as well as I could the Egyptian or
the Greek, and saw at once that it was but an ancient table of
accounts, sealed by some priest, a note indeed of the delivery of
a number of measures of corn into the store-house of a certain
temple.</p>

<p>"What jest is this?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Let the Master press the tablet between his finger and his
thumb, and he may learn," answered Obil in a dry voice.</p>

<p>I did so and it flew to pieces, being in truth but a hollow
cylinder of clay that had been broken and cunningly joined
together with an invisible cement. Within was a tightly rolled
papyrus covered with tiny writing in the Grecian character, at
the sight of which my heart stood still.</p>

<p>"There is your letter, Master," said Obil, "which I came by at
great risk, how is best left unsaid, and at the cost of all the
gold you gave me, aye, and more of my own."</p>

<p>"Recompense yourself with as much as you will, I will thank
you later, Friend," I answered hurriedly, who burned to study the
letter.</p>

<p>He went and standing under the hanging lamp, I undid the roll.
On it were written these words:</p>

<p class="letter">"O most Beloved,<br> "The message has reached
me, it matters not how, and I rejoice. Yea, I thank God, for
thereby I learn that you are safe and well. Know, Beloved, that I
feared, aye, and had it not been for my faith in God and my
memory of a certain prophecy made by a true seer far away, I
should have believed that you were dead. Immediately after that
kiss in the archway, which in dreams still burns my lips, I
thought that I saw you fall pierced by a sword. Now I know that
it was another man and that the gloom, or the dazzle of the
lightning deceived me. I was dragged away. I am a
prisoner&mdash;you will know where&mdash;an appointed prey to a
certain great one when he returns. For in an accursed
hour&mdash;may it be blotted out of the Book of Time! &mdash;he
looked upon me unveiled and found me to his fancy. Indeed it
seems that although absent, he remembers me and rejoices that I
am taken, as he planned that I should be. He has even written to
me, vile things, to which his servants force me to listen,
dragging away my hands when I would stop my ears. All his fair
women whom I hate, praise my beauty. They scent me, they comb my
hair with golden combs, they paint my eyes and lips, feeding me
with sweetmeats, and if I struggle, they laugh, naming me a cat
of Egypt and calling to the eunuchs to come to hold me while they
appraise me inch by inch. All these and other things I suffer
because I hope that God will be good to us and bring us together
again, how I know not who am a bird in a golden cage. Learn this,
my heart's desire, that the worst shall never fall upon me, for
when all hope is gone I will die, as I have the means to do.
Never shall that royal brute so much as defile me with his finger
tip. I dare write no more, for I think that I am watched; here
the very walls have eyes and ears. Beloved husband, I trust in
God, do thou the same, for He is just. Aye, even if He does not
help us here, yet I am persuaded that He is just and good, and in
some other land far from Babylon and the cruel earth, He will
unite us for ever. Yes, when Babylon is dust and quite forgotten,
that lips to lips and heart to heart we shall look down upon the
sands that shroud its palaces and the bones of its accursed
kings."</p>

<p>Such was the letter that was unsigned. Indeed from the writing
I judged that for some reason or other it was never finished.
Still it was hers. This I knew from some of the Greek phrases
more ancient and purer than was the common use, of a style indeed
that I, who was half a Greek, myself had taught to Myra. Also
those high thoughts and that vision of peace beyond the earth and
every joy for those who had suffered on the earth, were all her
own; indeed once when fears of the future took her, she had
spoken to me in like words.</p>

<p>Oh! the letter was Myra's. Her hand had pressed it, her breath
had breathed upon it, her eyes, perhaps, had wept upon it as
certain marks seemed to show, and therefore to me it was a thing
more precious than all the treasure of the world. And yet how
dreadful was the tale it told. Myra a prisoner; pampered, petted,
fattened, scented, that she might be made more acceptable to the
jaded appetite of this filthy king, this royal ravisher who
preyed on women as a rat preys upon cooped birds, seizing them,
sucking their blood, casting them aside to die, and rushing at
another. My soul sickened at the thought, my blood ran cold when
I pictured her, my own, my peculiar treasure, my love whom I had
always loved from her childhood and yet for long had never quite
known that I loved in that full fashion, helpless in the hands of
this crowned brute.</p>

<p>What a fool and madman had I been! Why had I not married her
when first she came to womanhood? Then before ever these kings
set their leering eyes upon her beauty, she would have been the
mother of children and therefore one whom they did not desire.
Then we should have passed our lives together in peace. But I
thought to give her liberty, to let her choose some younger man,
if so she willed, not guessing that with body and with soul, from
the hour that she knew I was not her father, she had turned to
me, and me alone. Therefore, because of my mother's pride and
common vanity, all these evils had come upon us, and what was
done could not be undone. Myra lay in her gorgeous den, panting
and beating its bars of gold whilst she waited the coming of the
wolf that would tear her for his pleasure, and I, far away and
powerless, could stretch out no hand to save her, although her
cry echoed in my ears.</p>

<p>She said that first she would die, and doubtless it was so,
unless in their cunning way they robbed her of the means of
death. Well, if she died, surely I should know it, surely her
spirit would touch me in its passing, so that I might make haste
to follow. Yet, what an end! One that was forbid also by the law
which said that all torments must be endured for the pleasure of
the gods. Yet if need were it should be faced.</p>

<p>I lifted the letter to my lips and kissed it; then I pressed
it to my heart and wept. Yes, I, a man of full age and a captain
of men, wept like a girl!</p>

<p>I felt a hand upon my shoulder and looked up. By me stood the
prophet, the holy one of the People of Judah.</p>

<p>"Why do you weep, Ramose?" he asked gently.</p>

<p>I told him all and even gave him the letter to read, though in
truth he scarcely looked at it but set it down as though already
he knew what was written there.</p>

<p>"You have done foolishly and for the second time, Ramose," he
said, "you who lack faith and patience. Have I not told you to
wait and be content? And now, who knows? It is not easy for women
of the king's household to send out letters unobserved, and if
this one has been seen, what then? Well, it is too late to
question. Let the matter be. Yet I pray you to promise me that
you will send no more such messages and seek no more letters from
a certain lady who lies hid in yonder palace."</p>

<p>"I ask pardon and I promise," I answered humbly. "Be not wrath
with me, O Prophet. I feared lest she were dead, as you see she
feared that I was dead, and the temptation was too great."</p>

<p>"Had she been dead, I should have told you, Ramose. Do you
think that for no purpose I desire to keep you here in Babylon
where you go in great peril day by day? If she were dead or lost
to you beyond all hope, long ago I should have sent you hence.
For the last time I say&mdash;be warned, and unless I bid you, do
nothing in this matter save bide here and wait."</p>

<p>Thus he spoke, more sternly than he had ever done to me, and,
seeking no answer, departed, leaving me afraid. What did he mean
when he spoke of my going in danger day by day? I thought that
here in his house I lay hid and safe from every peril, also that
none knew that the Egyptian, Ramose, was in Babylon, or even that
a certain Ptahmes dwelt on there. Yet if these things were not
known, why did I go in danger? I say that I grew afraid, not for
myself who have never been a coward, but for Myra. If evil
overtook me, what would chance to Myra who then, save for Belus
if he still lived, would be alone in the world?</p>

<p>Oh! I was afraid of this prophet about whom there was
something unearthly, and even terrible. He seemed to walk the
earth like a spirit or a god, knowing all, perchance directing
all, yet holding his lips sealed and hiding his countenance. And
he was wrath with me because I did not trust to him more utterly,
forgetting that it is hard for men who are sinners to put all
their faith and hopes in the hands of saints and prophets, seeing
that to their knowledge such often deceive themselves and lead
others to their ruin.</p>

<p>In what troubles was I snared and wrapped like a gnat in a
spider's web! When the royal Atyra was murdered because of me, I
had sworn that never again would I look in love on woman and
holding down the flesh, for many years I had kept that oath and
been happy. Then Myra the snow-maiden, of a sudden turned to
flame and set me afire also, so that we burned upon one pyre
which was like to be such as the old Greeks used to consume the
dead. Well for me and well for her if we had gone different ways
and our lips had never met in love!</p>

<p>Nay, it was not so, for even if we died, separate or together,
still our lips had met, still that holy fire had been lit which
must burn eternally. Oh! better to suffer and to love, than to
live out fat, unanxious years in such peace as oxen know. For
then what harvest can the spirit hope to bear with it from the
earth to sow again beyond the earth?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap19"></a>CHAPTER 19<br>

THE LADY OF THE LITTER</h2>

<p class="first">
THE weary days went on. As I had promised, I attempted to send
no more messages, and indeed told Obil that I sought no further
letters, for these were too dangerous. This saying, I noted,
seemed to please him, who although he made no complaint and
expressed no fear, to me now always appeared to walk like one who
is straining his ears to listen, while continually he glances
over his shoulder to see if he is followed.</p>

<p>Had Obil some secret cause for dread, I wondered uneasily, and
if so, was I to blame? This doubt took a hold of me, so that more
than once almost I spoke to him on the matter, purposing to ask
him whether he would not do well to leave my service and hide
himself. Yet in the end I did not, who in the words of the
Egyptian proverb, though it wiser not to kick the sleeping jackal
lest it should yap and call the lion. Also I believed that the
prophet would protect him.</p>

<p>At last came a day when Obil brought some news and it was
dreadful. Belshazzar the King had returned to Babylon that
morning shortly after dawn. Obil, who had gone early to the
market to buy our food, saw him come, driving furiously in a
chariot and accompanied by other chariots and horsemen who seemed
weary as though they had galloped through the livelong night. I
asked him of this king and he answered that he looked fierce yet
frightened, like to one who had an evil spirit sitting on his
shoulder and calling disaster in his ear. His eye flashed, his
long hair flew out behind him, and when an old woman carrying
fish in a basket on her back, stumbled and fell, blocking the
narrow road, with a curse he bade the charioteer drive over her.
This was done, leaving her crushed and shrieking, with blood
running from her, a sight that angered the people, for they
muttered and some shook their fists after the king. Yet none of
them dared to touch the woman whom he had chosen to destroy and
who lay there till she died.</p>

<p>"It seems that the people of Babylon do not love this king of
theirs," I said.</p>

<p>"No, Master, they hate him, who is the most cruel of whom
history tells. Yet they fear him for he never forgets and his
vengeance is very terrible. While Nabonidus lived they could
appeal to him sometimes, but now that he is dead they can only
appeal to their gods who do not listen."</p>

<p>"What news of the Persian war?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"None that is certain; indeed few talk of it because it is
forbidden, but those who do shake their heads and mutter of
defeat and captured cities. They say, too, that Belshazzar has
escaped from Zippar or some other beleaguered place, and fled to
Babylon because he believes it impregnable and hopes to hold it
until he can win succour from other countries. It is even
reported that an embassy has come from Egypt to treat with him on
this matter. For so hardly is he pressed that he has offered to
Pharaoh lordship over all the Syrian lands that Babylon still
holds, and a great sum in gold, if only he will send an army to
his succour."</p>

<p>Now when I heard this I marvelled. Only a little while ago
Nabonidus was quarrelling with Pharaoh over the matter of Myra,
and that Belshazzar should now be imploring help from him showed
me that he must indeed be pressed. Still I said no more, thinking
to myself that I would ask the prophet of the truth of this
story. But when I inquired whether he would be pleased to see me
I received a message which he had left for me, saying that he had
gone to some hidden place to pray and would not return till after
sunset, or perhaps not until the morrow.</p>

<p>So I sat alone in my chamber, consumed with such fears as may
not be written, for were not Myra and Belshazzar the king now
beneath the same roof? Aye, was she not as a bird in the very
hand of the snarer.</p>

<p>Later in the day I sent again for Obil, thinking that I might
gather more tidings. But a servant called Nabel came in his
stead, much disturbed. He said that he and Obil had been walking
in the street when suddenly guards pounced on them, seized Obil
and dragged him away. Thereon he fled, fearing lest they should
take him also, which they made no attempt to do.</p>

<p>"Where then is Obil?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Where the lamb is after it wandered and met the eagle,
Master," answered the man grimly, "for those guards bore the
royal badge."</p>

<p>"The motherless lamb is good to the eagle, but what is Obil to
a certain bird that has a beak but no wings?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Doubtless food also, of one sort or another, or may be his
entrails will furnish auguries," he answered in a cold voice that
frightened me.</p>

<p>For now I was sure that Obil had been seized because he had to
do with a certain message and a certain letter, and could say who
sent the message and who received the letter. Still, all was
well; Obil was an upright man, like myself a worshipper of
Jehovah who would break no oaths.</p>

<p>Then I remembered that tyrants and kings have dreadful ways of
dragging out the truth from the most secret soul, and
shivered.</p>

<p>Later in that terrible day, between two and three hours before
sunset, this same man Nabel entered the chamber where I sat
brooding, bearing a covered basket of woven rushes.</p>

<p>"What is this?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A love-gift, as I think, Master; at least the women of
Babylon, when they are smitten with desire for some man who has
caught their eye, are wont to send such baskets adorned like this
with the rich colours of love."</p>

<p>"Then it cannot be for me, upon whose countenance no lady has
looked for months," I answered smiling.</p>

<p>"Yet it is always well to learn what is hidden in any covered
basket," said Nabel meaningly.</p>

<p>Thereon I undid the silken string and threw back the lid,
revealing ripe figs, each of them wrapped in a vine leaf.</p>

<p>"Take out the figs&mdash;but do not eat them," said Nabel and
I did so, lifting the purple fruit one by one and setting them on
the table.</p>

<p>At length I came to a package wrapped in linen. I undid this
package, and behold! there appeared just such a clay cylinder as
that which had covered Myra's letter. I took it, I pressed, it
fell to pieces, and within was a little papyrus roll inscribed
with tiny writing in the Grecian character.</p>

<p>Eagerly I read. It ran thus:</p>

<p class="letter">"Beloved,<br> "I am in a sore straight, but I
have found a certain road of escape for both of us; what it is I
dare not write. There is a feast to-night in the great hall of
the palace, which feast you must attend. Array yourself in a
dress of honour and come hither guided by one whom I send who is
a friend to me. I dare write no more, but all will be made clear
at the time appointed. Oh! fail me not. If ever you would clasp
me in your arms and look again upon a happy house, fail me not
now. Cast aside all doubts and fear. Be bold and come, lest we be
parted for ever. Choose then between joy and death. For learn,
Beloved, that if you come not, this very day I must die to save
myself from a more evil fate."</p>

<p>Twice I read this letter through from the first word to the
last. Then I laid it down and thought, as perhaps I had never
done before. Swiftly, fiercely I weighed and pondered all. Taking
the first letter from where it was hidden, I compared the two.
The encasing tablets were of the same sort, though the writing on
them was different, for this second tablet purported to deal with
the sale of a field in the reign of some earlier Babylonian king,
reserving the trees in the field to the seller and his heirs, as
is often done in the East. Moreover the broken fragments of the
tablet had been joined together with the same sort of invisible
cement. The papyrus on which both letters were written, also
seemed to be the same, of an Egyptian make, as I who had used so
much of it, knew well, and scented with a like scent; in the
Greek character further I could find no difference though the ink
of the second letter varied a little in colour from the first,
being darker in hue.</p>

<p>Still, seeing that Grecian characters written by a good scribe
are hard to know apart, I could not be sure that this Greek was
written by Myra, though as in the case of the first letter, from
its style I believed it to be hers. Lastly in both letters the
writer spoke of ending her life rather than suffer shame, and in
the second she called our house at Memphis by its name, which
surely no one else would know. Oh! I could not doubt. Myra had
penned this second letter as she had penned the first.</p>

<p>Then why did I not prepare to do her bidding, putting aside
all doubts and fears, as she bade me? For one reason
only&mdash;because of my promise to the prophet. Yet what was
that promise? That I should attempt no more to send her messages
and draw answers from her; one that I had kept to the full. For
the rest, he had only bidden me to bide here in this house. But
if he saw that letter, doubtless he would recall his words. Alas!
that I could not show it to him! Alas! that now when I needed him
so sorely, he was far away, where I knew not.</p>

<p>So it stood thus. On the one hand was Myra's letter which, if
obeyed, meant escape and joy, and if not obeyed, meant her death
that must soon be followed by my own. On the other, the bidding
of the prophet that I should not leave his house, because if I
did so I might come into peril. But could I hesitate for such a
reason when Myra stood in perils a hundred times as great? I
could not; I would put on the robe of honour that Nabonidus had
given me to wear when I walked from my apartments to the royal
presence, and go. Yet how was I to go?</p>

<p>She spoke of one whom she sent to guide me, who was a friend
to her. Where then was this guide? I called the man Nabel who had
brought me the basket and inquired how it had come into his
hands. He answered that an old beggar-woman had given it to him
as he stood in the street outside the door, and that she was now
crouched in the shadow of a broken wall near by, as he thought
asleep. I asked him if she had said anything.</p>

<p>"Yes, Master," he replied. "She said that she was commanded to
lead the lord to whom the basket must be delivered, to where he
would go and that she would wait until he was ready, which he
must be by sunset."</p>

<p>I glanced at the sky and saw that there was yet an hour before
the sun vanished. This was well, for in an hour much might
happen. The prophet might return; the old woman might depart, in
which case I could not accompany her and the problem would solve
itself. Meanwhile I would make ready.</p>

<p>I washed myself, I trimmed my long hair and the square beard
that I now wore after the Babylonian fashion, wondering foolishly
whether Myra would prefer it thus or whether she would bid me
shape it as of old when at last we were far away and safe;
wondering also with what looks and words she would greet me, and
many other such vain things as come into the minds of lovers.
Then I put on the robe of honour, a rich garment embroidered with
silver and having a deep collar that could be turned up to hide
the face; such a robe as the Babylonians wore over their linen
dress when they attended feasts, or at night when they went where
they did not wish to be known, for then they raised this collar
till almost it met the head-dress of folded silk.</p>

<p>By the time that all was done the sun's red rim made a path of
fire over the broad bosom of the Euphrates and I knew that very
soon it would be gone. I sent once more to learn if the prophet
had returned, but there was no sign of him. Then torn this way
and that by hopes and fears, I knelt down and prayed to God to
guide me, as I knew the prophet was wont to do. I was not warned
against this enterprise by sign or token or symbol, or by the
stirring of my heart. Therefore I felt encouraged in it, who did
not understand that already the first warning and the last had
been given to me through the mouth of the great prophet who, as
always, spoke with the voice of God.</p>

<p>The sun having vanished I gathered up my courage and called to
Nabel who had brought the basket. In his charge I left the letter
I had received with a message to the prophet, should he return,
saying that I had obeyed what was written in the letter, having
no choice for otherwise I must have gone mad. He learned the
message by heart and said that it should be delivered with the
writing, which I knew he could not read who had no Greek.</p>

<p>Then Nabel led me out through the secret door by which first I
had entered this house, and along an old, broken wall of the
building which was here before it, to a niche in the wall where
perhaps once stood the statue of some king or god. In this niche
wrapped in a tattered garment, crouched an old woman who seemed
to be asleep. If so, she slumbered warily, for at the sound of
our steps she scrambled to her feet, hobbled forward and stared
at me by such light as remained.</p>

<p>"La!" she said, "so this is he to whom I bore the love-basket.
A likely man enough, though no youth. But there, when I was in my
flower and beautiful, always I turned to one of middle-age,
perhaps because, being no fool myself, I sought wisdom as well as
kisses. Come on, lover, and may the goddess of Love who, mind
you, by whatever name they call her, is the greatest in the whole
world, be your friend to-night."</p>

<p>Thus she babbled on, as I guessed to stop my mouth, so that I
could not question her, all the while leading me by quick turns
from side street to side street, till at length we reached a
quiet, grass-grown place surrounded by tall houses in whose
windows no lamps burned, either because it was too early for them
to be lit, or because the houses were deserted.</p>

<p>In this place as the faint light showed, for that night was
one of full moon, was a large litter resting on the ground and
standing at its poles twelve black men dressed in uniform who
neither stirred nor spoke; Ethiopian slaves they seemed to be.
The old woman led me to the litter, whispering,</p>

<p>"Enter, lover. Nay, stop not to fee me who am already well
paid and whose joy it is to bring together those who waste away
apart. Enter and when you are happy, remember me."</p>

<p>So through the curtains which she opened, I stumbled into that
dark litter, to find myself caught in a woman's arms and resting
on a woman's breast. I thought&mdash;who would not?&mdash;that it
must be she I sought, she of whom my heart was full, and no
other. Therefore I threw my answering arms about her and drawing
her to me kissed her on eyes and lips. Nor did she say me nay. At
length she laughed a little and the laugh seemed strange to me.
Then she said in the Babylonian tongue and in a voice that though
pleasant, was stranger still,</p>

<p>"I have always heard, Friend, that you men of Egypt were
warm-hearted and forward to attack, but never till now did I
understand how faithful was the tale. Kiss on, Friend, if it
pleases you, for kisses are cheerful and they leave no
scars."</p>

<p>Now I shrank back gasping and amazed, not far it is true, for
the litter would not allow of it, whereon my companion continued
her mockery.</p>

<p>"Are you tired of love-making," she answered, "and so soon? Or
do you fear that Ishtar has not blessed me? It is not so, I
swear. Look now, I will draw the curtain a little and you will
see that I am well-favoured enough to please most men, even if
they be high-born Egyptians."</p>

<p>Thereon she leant forward, pressing her face against my own,
and did so. At first I could see nothing both because I could
scarcely move my head, and secondly for the reason that the
moonlight was cut off either by a cloud or by some house.
Presently, however, the litter swung round a corner, for all this
while we were being carried forward, and for a few moments the
light shone on her, showing that in her fashion she was very
fair, round-faced, red-lipped and with dark alluring eyes. Also
she was young and most shapely.</p>

<p>"So!" she said, letting the curtain fall again, "not so ill,
am I, at any rate in this gloom where one might well pass for
another? You, too, are better to look at than I thought, handsome
indeed&mdash;therefore&mdash;" and again she pressed herself
against me.</p>

<p>"Lady," I murmured, "I may not. I go to meet one to whom I am
sworn and &mdash;I may not."</p>

<p>"Well, even so there is no reason to tremble like a leaf, or
as though you found yourself companioned by a snake. You would
not greet the lady by telling her how you came to her and with
whom, would you? If Ishtar keeps her eyes shut need you open
hers? Moreover," she added and now I caught a note of warning in
her voice, "how do you know that you will find that lady, who
perhaps also travels in a litter with another? Have you no
proverb in Egypt, Friend, that says: 'Take what the gods give
while their hands are open, for none know what they will withhold
when they are shut.'"</p>

<p>"Oh! Lady, mock me not. I am in a sore strait."</p>

<p>She laughed a little, musically enough, and answered,</p>

<p>"So I can guess; indeed I am sure of it and therefore I
forgive you, which, being vain, I should not do if I thought that
you shrank from me because I was unpleasing to you. Poor man, be
at peace! See, here is a cushion, will you not use it to cover
your face? The warmest kisses cannot burn it through. Moreover it
was you who began them, not I. I did but take fire from your
torch."</p>

<p>Then she leant back and continued laughing, and there was
something about her voice which told me that however bold she
might be, she was also kind-hearted.</p>

<p>We travelled on in silence for a while, then she said,</p>

<p>"I will tell you something lest you should misjudge me. You
can guess that I am girl whose eyes are not always fixed upon the
ground, but I am nothing worse. I was sent to bring you as one
from whom a man would not flee as he might do from another man.
But by Marduk I do not know why I am sent who earn my fee and ask
no questions. Believe me, Egyptian, I am not the bait upon any
trap."</p>

<p>"Who sent you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A eunuch as usual where such palace errands are concerned,
and therefore I smell a love affair."</p>

<p>"Is it so? I thought perhaps that it was a lady."</p>

<p>"Without doubt, for there is always a lady behind the eunuch,"
she answered in the voice of one who wished to leave this matter
undiscussed.</p>

<p>Then I remembered the words of Myra's letter, that she was
sending one who was a friend of hers to lead me to her, and
marvelled a little, for this fair wanton seemed a strange friend
for Myra to have chosen. Only I remembered also that she was
dwelling in a court and, it was probable, could not choose her
friends, but must take any that would serve her turn, a dangerous
one enough. Therefore I let that doubt trouble my mind no more.
Presently the litter halted for a moment and a challenge was
given which was answered by one of the bearers in words that I
could not catch. Thereon he who had challenged laughed and we
went forward again, from which I guessed that we had passed some
gate. The lady leant forward and whispered in a new voice,</p>

<p>"Friend, we have passed the outer wall of the palace and are
about to go down into&mdash;hell, for the palace of Belshazzar is
hell indeed, as I know who dwell there with others of my kind.
You are bold who being free, enter such a place where from hour
to hour none knows what may chance to him. But doubtless you have
your reasons which it does not become me to ask. Now I am going
to make a request to you, to grant or to refuse as you will. It
is that you will kiss me once more, upon the brow this time, not
as a lover but as a brother might, and tell me that you forgive
me my mockeries. For I would fain be kissed once by an honest man
as I feel you to be."</p>

<p>Now I thought a moment. I did not wish to touch this woman
again yet some voice speaking in my heart urged me to do as she
desired. So I listened to that voice and kissed her, for which
she thanked me very humbly. As the end will show well was it for
me that I did so, thereby making her my friend.</p>

<p>Again we were challenged and this time the word of the bearers
was not accepted.</p>

<p>"Lean back," said my companion.</p>

<p>Then she opened the curtains a little and spoke between them,
at the same time thrusting out her hand on which there was some
ring.</p>

<p>"Go on," cried a voice. "It is only Adna with one of her
gallants, who carries warrant on her finger to pass where she
will with whom she will on this night of festival when Ishtar
reigns. Say, Adna, may I not share that litter with you three
nights hence when my leave begins?"</p>

<p>"Aye," she answered mockingly, "if between now and then you
will change yourself from a vulgar fellow into a gentleman of
breeding who can tell the name of his grandfather, which is
impossible," a bitter saying that caused the officer's companions
to laugh.</p>

<p>We went on again through sundry courts, as I gathered by the
cutting off of the moonlight, and at length halted in some silent
place.</p>

<p>Adna, as I had now learned the woman with me was called,
sprang from the litter that had been set down upon the ground,
and running up some steps to a little door, tapped upon it three
times, and after a pause twice more quickly. The door opened and
for a while she talked with some one in a whisper, after which
she returned to the litter and said,</p>

<p>"My task is done. Yours, whatever it may be, begins.
Descend."</p>

<p>Now some cold hand of fear seemed to grip my heart, some sense
that this place was unfriendly and dangerous to me, so that of
all things in the world that which I wished the least was to
enter there. A sweat burst out upon my brow; I became a coward
eaten up of doubts.</p>

<p>"Can you not take me back by the road we came, Lady?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Nay," she answered. "You have entered by your own will and
here you must stay, as the fish-god said to the eel in the trap
when it learned that it was about to be skinned alive. Oh! why
will men run so fast to catch women who are not worth it after
all? Good-bye and may all the gods of all the lands befriend you,
just for the sake of that one honest kiss."</p>

<p>Then servants, four of them all armed, appeared and handed me
from the litter, bowing as though to a great lord. At the head of
the steps I glanced back and saw the light of the torch they
bore, shining on the beautiful face of the white-robed Adna as
she stood by the litter watching me depart. Moreover, unless some
trick of the shadows deceived me, I could have sworn that tears
were running down that face.</p>

<p>Why and for whom did Adna shed those tears? I wondered.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="chap20"></a>CHAPTER 20<br>

THE END OF OBIL</h2>

<p class="first">
THE little door clanged to behind me and with a fluttering of
my heart I heard the bronze bolts rattle as they went home in
their marble sockets. Then I was led down narrow passages, many
of them that turned and forked and turned again till I lost all
count of how they ran. At length I reached cedar doors before
which stood guards. The doors opened and out came other servants
who took me from those by whom I had been brought thus far, and
led me into a lofty room that was separated from an inner chamber
by broidered curtains.</p>

<p>Here I stood for a space while, passing between the curtains,
one of the servants made some report that seemed to cause a man
within to laugh loudly. Then he returned and I was led, or rather
pushed through the curtains, on the farther side of which I
halted bewildered, being dazzled by the multitude and brightness
of the lights. A voice said in my ear,</p>

<p>"Down! Be prostrate before the King of kings!" but still I
stood bewildered, seeing no king.</p>

<p>When presently my eyes grew accustomed to the blaze of light I
perceived that I was in a large chamber, cedar-roofed and adorned
with gold-worked hangings. At the end of this chamber, seated in
a gilded and jewelled chair, was a large, hook-nosed, bearded man
with unwinking eyes that reminded me of those of a vulture, whom
I knew to be Belshazzar the King.</p>

<p>He stared at me with those bold, fixed eyes, then said in a
voice as soft as though his throat had been soaked in oil,</p>

<p>"Let him alone. These barbarian foreign lords do not
understand the customs of our court. If he does not prostrate
himself of his own courtesy, I say&mdash;let him alone who may
ere long learn to mend his manners. Bring him here. I would speak
with him."</p>

<p>So I was led forward and stood before the king.</p>

<p>"How are you named?" he asked, eyeing me up and down with his
vulture stare.</p>

<p>"I am called Ptahmes, O King," I answered who did not dare to
give my own name, and I noted that a scribe who stood by, wrote
down the words.</p>

<p>"Is it so? I think that I have heard otherwise. What are you
doing in Babylon and what are you?"</p>

<p>"I am a man of learning, O King, of whom the late king, your
father, was pleased to make a friend when we discussed the
attributes of the gods. He gave me this robe in which I
stand."</p>

<p>"Did he? Then a fool made presents to a knave," he replied
coarsely, and the courtiers laughed. "Where are you living?" he
went on.</p>

<p>"I am the guest of the prophet Belteshazzar, O King, he whom
the late king Nebuchadnezzar made governor of Babylon."</p>

<p>"Indeed. Then as I suspected, that old Hebrew dream-doctor
keeps bad company. By Marduk! he shall answer for it to me who do
not fear his spells as did Nebuchadnezzar the Madman. Are you
also one of the men of Judah?"</p>

<p>"I am a worshipper of the God of Judah, O King."</p>

<p>"And therefore an enemy of the gods of Babylon. Well, let the
gods fight their own battles. I mock them all who have served me
ill of late and chiefly this cheat of Judah, whose temple we have
plundered and whose golden vessels are my wash-pots. He has
cursed me, so say his priests, but as he has no statue to be
defiled, I spit upon his name and will show him that the King of
Babylon is greater than the Heavenly Cheat of Judah, as did the
kings who went before me. What say you, man?"</p>

<p>Now when I heard these blasphemies I shivered, nor, as I
think, were they pleasing to the ears of the courtiers, for I saw
some of them turn their heads and make the sign that Babylonians
use to avert evil.</p>

<p>"Is it for me to reason with the King, or to revile Him Whom I
worship? As the King said, let the gods fight their own battles,
which doubtless they will do," I answered slowly.</p>

<p>"So in veiled words you threaten me with this god of yours, do
you? Yet I think that before long you will revile his name, and
loudly, in all our ears. How came you here and for what purpose,
O Ptahmes?"</p>

<p>"A woman brought me, O King."</p>

<p>"Her name?"</p>

<p>"I am not sure of it, but one of the guards called her
Adna."</p>

<p>All those present smiled and Belshazzar answered with a brutal
laugh,</p>

<p>"Oh! Adna. We all know the beautiful Adna. Did you then
propose to use my palace as a house of ill fame?"</p>

<p>"Not so, O King. I was told that I was among those bidden to a
feast because the late king Nabonidus had favoured me."</p>

<p>"Were you? Then learn that I do not pick my feasters from
among my father's toadies tricked out in his old clothes," and he
pointed to my cloak which I now noticed was of a different make
and stuff from those worn by the officers around him.</p>

<p>I was silent, not knowing what to say. For a while he sat
staring at me, his face alive with hate as though I were his
bitterest foe. Then he spoke again, changing his soft voice, as
he had the power to do, for one like to the roar of a lion.</p>

<p>"Let us have done with all these lies," he said, "for I weary
of the play and time grows short. Captain, bring in the man Obil,
that we may refresh ourselves with a breath of truth."</p>

<p>Now the officer addressed hesitated, seeing which the king
struck the arm of the chair with his sceptre and shouted
again,</p>

<p>"Do you not hear me? Bring in the spy Obil."</p>

<p>So sharply did he strike that the ivory sceptre snapped in two
and the golden head in which was set a great emerald, rolled
along the floor till it lay still between my feet. A gasp of fear
at this most evil omen rose from those who saw it, and even the
king's wine-flushed face paled for a moment. Recovering himself,
he turned on them snarling and asked,</p>

<p>"Are you afraid? Do you think that the cheat Jehovah answers
me by a sign worked upon this rod of power that all the gods of
Babylon have blessed? I tell you that with half a sceptre I will
hunt him out of heaven, yes, and shatter Cyrus, whom the men of
Judah call his Sword. Aye, I will thrust it down the Persian's
throat and watch it choke him."</p>

<p>"May the King live for ever!" said the courtiers bowing. "The
King is greater than all the conquered gods of all the
peoples!"</p>

<p>I saw, I heard, and for the first time some comfort crept into
my scared soul as I set my foot upon that sceptre-head beneath
the hem of my robe where it lay hidden, and spurned it. For well
I knew that this beast king was but as dust before the breath of
Jehovah the Holy One of Judah. Then I stepped back and showed the
great jewel flashing on the ground like to a tiger's evil
eye.</p>

<p>A door at the side of the chamber was opened and through it
came four bloodstained black men, naked save for loin cloths, who
bore a stretcher covered with a cloth.</p>

<p>"May it please the King, Obil is here as the King commanded,"
said the captain.</p>

<p>At a sign from the king he threw back the cloth revealing a
hideous sight, from which even those cruel Babylonians shrank
back. For there lay Obil, mutilated, torn to pieces, scarred with
fire and bathed in blood. More I will not write; it is
enough.</p>

<p>"Bid the dog speak, if he would not taste of a worse torment,
and tell me what he knows of this man who bribed him to corrupt
my servants and carry letters from a lady of my household," said
Belshazzar.</p>

<p>"May it please the King," said the captain in a trembling
voice, "Obil cannot speak. He is dead!"</p>

<p>"Dead!" roared Belshazzar. "How comes it that he is dead when
I commanded that he should be kept alive?" and he glared at the
black slaves who shook in their terror.</p>

<p>"May it please the King," went on the captain, "the scribe
here whose office it is to be present at tormentings and take
down the words uttered by the victims&mdash;I mean by the wicked
sentenced to punishment, says that this obstinate man of Judah,
Obil, snatched a heated knife from the hand of one of the slaves
and drove it into his own heart. See, it stands there in his
breast."</p>

<p>"And what said the fellow before he died?" asked Belshazzar of
the scribe, who answered,</p>

<p>"May it please the King, he said nothing save that he believed
this man here was an Egyptian of royal blood and that the King
could never harm him as he was protected by the spirit of
Belteshazzar, the great prophet of Judah. Naught else could be
wrung from him by any torment that is known. Indeed with his last
words he denied all the little he had uttered."</p>

<p>"Did he tell you naught of Belus or Azar, my enemy in whose
pay he was, and whither he has gone?"</p>

<p>"Naught, O King."</p>

<p>"Take that carrion away and let those clumsy slaves await my
punishment under guard, for I think that presently they shall
taste of their own medicine," said the king, glaring again at the
black men.</p>

<p>So the body of the steadfast Obil was carried off and as it
went I prostrated my heart before him whom unwittingly I had
brought to death, and blessed his spirit, praying its pardon and
that of God. When it was gone and slaves had scattered perfume
over the spot where the tormentors and the litter had stood, the
king spoke again, saying,</p>

<p>"We have learned little of this man from that dead Hebrew,
save that he is an Egyptian of royal blood, and even this he
denied again before his end. Nor is it of any use to ask the
fellow himself, except under torment, for doubtless he will lie
as all Egyptians do. Yet if, as is reported, he be really of the
blood of Amasis we must go softly, for at this moment Babylon
does not wish to make a foe of Pharaoh. Now I have heard rumours
concerning the man and I would put them to the proof, as happily
I have the means to do. What say you, my counsellors?"</p>

<p>"The King is wise. May the King live for ever!" answered these
reptiles, bowing like snakes before the rod of their charmer.</p>

<p>Then Belshazzar turned to a chamberlain who stood upon his
right with a wand in his hand, and said,</p>

<p>"Admit those ladies who await an audience of my Majesty, and
be silent everyone while I talk with them. Remember all, also
you, Egyptian, that whoever speaks before I open his mouth,
dies," and without moving his head he turned his flashing eyes
towards the door through which the torturers had departed with
their horrible burden, then fixed them threateningly upon me.</p>

<p>Presently the curtains that hung over another of the entrances
to that great chamber were drawn and from between them appeared
two ladies draped in long veils, of whom because of these veils
little could be seen, except that they were tall and walked
gracefully. After them came other women whom I took to be
attendants because their heads were bowed. Also I noted that the
pair who came first seemed to be strangers or enemies, for they
exchanged no word and edged away from each other. Having made
their obeisance to the king, they were halted by the chamberlain
at a little distance from where I stood. Then they looked at me
and I perceived that both of them began to sway and tremble like
papyrus reeds beneath the weight of a breath of wind, seeing
which I grew suddenly afraid. Indeed from the moment that they
entered I had been afraid, because there was something which came
from them to me that stirred my spirit and awoke memories of I
knew not what.</p>

<p>"Be pleased, Ladies, as this is no public court, to put off
ceremony and to unveil yourselves," said Belshazzar in his
softest voice.</p>

<p>Thereon the waiting women sprang forward and loosed the
wrappings from the heads of the two ladies whom I watched
intently, wondering whether I should know them.</p>

<p>The veils fell and were snatched away and next moment I too
nearly fell down. For before me stood Myra and my mother! Both of
them were wonderfully arrayed and, as a man sees in a dream, I
noted that on my mother's head was a royal ornament, at least
from it, fashioned in gems, rose something that resembled the
uraeus snake of Egypt, that only might be worn by kings, their
spouses and their children of the true blood.</p>

<p>Myra bent forward as though to speak but in a stern voice
Belshazzar bade her to be silent. Then addressing my mother, he
said,</p>

<p>"Royal Lady, for so from our brother Pharaoh's letters I
understand you are, who for your own reasons have been pleased to
favour me by accompanying Egypt's embassy to Babylon, as, if you
were so minded, I prayed that you would do; tell me, I pray,
whether you know this man who stands before me, and if so, who
and what he is."</p>

<p>These words the king spoke in his own language, but an
interpreter who must have been waiting there for the purpose,
rendered them in Greek.</p>

<p>"Know him!" she answered with a cry, using that same tongue,
for indeed she had never learned any other very well. "Can a
mother forget the child she bore? Great King, he is my own and
only son begotten by the good god, Pharaoh Apries, when I was his
wife. Yes, my son of the royal blood, a Count of Egypt and a
governor of Memphis, whom having lost, by Pharaoh's leave I have
travelled so far to seek, as you invited me to do through your
envoy, O King of kings. Amasis, the present divine Pharaoh, sent
him as an ambassador to Cyrus the Persian, after which he
vanished, O King; wherefore, hearing from your envoy that he was
rumoured to be still in Babylon hidden away, I came to seek him
and&mdash;am here."</p>

<p>"Is he named Ptahmes, Lady?"</p>

<p>"Nay, O King, his name is Ramose," she exclaimed
astonished.</p>

<p>"I thank you, Lady, for this makes certain what we had heard
elsewhere, that Ptahmes is a false name under which it has
pleased the noble but modest Ramose to hide himself in Babylon.
Now, royal Chloe, as I believe that you are called, be pleased to
tell me whether you know the lady who stands near to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, O King, though I have not seen her since she left Egypt
to be wed to the King Nabonidus, a marriage, I am told, that did
not take place because of some falsehood that was published
concerning her, although now she is to become your queen, O King,
a glorious destiny indeed. Yes, the wife of the greatest monarch
in all the world!" and she lifted her eyes as though in adoration
of a god.</p>

<p>"You are right, Lady, and it is for this reason that we have
petitioned of you to honour us with your presence here in Babylon
if only for a while, that we may bestow upon you such gifts and
titles as become one who is said to be the grandmother of a lady
whom its king takes as wife. We beg you, therefore, to tell us
here and now whether this is so, as in his letters Amasis, the
Pharaoh of Egypt declares, because if I may say it, in your
person you are still so young and beautiful, that doubts have
arisen as to this matter."</p>

<p>Now I fell into an agony, or rather into a deeper agony, who
knew not what words would come from the mouth of this foolish
mother of mine in the madness of her vanity. I who remembering
Belshazzar's terrible threat, dared not speak, fixed my eyes upon
her face, as I saw Myra did also, striving to send a message from
my heart to hers, warning her of my peril. But she took no heed.
Indeed she only blushed and bowed, then answered in a pleased
voice,</p>

<p>"O King, my son Ramose was born when I was still very young,
nor is he himself so far advanced in years as might be thought
from his face, that has grown lined with study of deep things I
do not understand."</p>

<p>Now Belshazzar leaned forward and said in a measured
voice,</p>

<p>"Then this lady is the daughter of your son, Ramose?"</p>

<p>"So I believe, O King, although I never knew her mother, as I
told Pharaoh Amasis in the past. Years ago a queen named Atyra
came from Syria on an embassy to Apries my lord, a beautiful
woman who, I heard, fell in love with my son and&mdash;the King
will spare me, for we in Egypt are modest and it is not our
custom to talk of such matters to men."</p>

<p>Now able to bear no more I was about to cry out that she lied,
when a eunuch who had drawn near to me, gripped my arm and
handling his dagger, whispered in my ear,</p>

<p>"Unless you seek instant death, be silent."</p>

<p>Then I refrained my lips, bethinking me that while I lived
there was still hope. In death there could be none.</p>

<p>"All of us understand, royal Chloe," said the king with a
false smile; "indeed I remember hearing of this Queen Atyra, a
very fair woman who went to stir up Egypt against us of Babylon
and returned no more. So enough of her. Now one more question, my
royal guest, and I will cease to trouble you. A man called Belus,
an evil-doer who fled from Babylon when I was young because of
some crime he had committed, appeared here not long ago and was
pardoned through the foolishness of the late king, my father, to
whom he was a cousin. This man having been reinstalled in his
offices, for by trade he is a priest and a necromancer, stated to
the king in my presence that the lady Myra yonder was not a
princess of the royal blood of Egypt as Pharaoh Amasis had
declared, but the low-born wife of an Egyptian named Ramose, a
son of Pharaoh Apries and the lady Chloe, believing which, my
father publicly put away the lady Myra and from that day till his
death never looked upon her face again. Is this tale true or
false, royal Chloe?"</p>

<p>"How can it be other than false, O King?" cried my mother in a
high and rapid voice, "seeing that for years Myra dwelt with my
son as his acknowledged daughter, first in Cyprus and afterwards
in Egypt, where she herself often spoke to me of him as her
father and where he suffered suitors to ask her hand as that of
his daughter? Moreover did they not live in my house at Memphis
as father and daughter? Lastly, if this were not so, should I
have told Pharaoh Amasis that she was my son's daughter when he
sought for a lady of the royal blood to be sent as a wife to the
King Nabonidus? Further, if they were wed, how comes it that I,
his mother, was never asked to be present when he took her as his
bride?"</p>

<p>Thus she spoke in a torrent of words until she ceased from
want of breath.</p>

<p>"It is enough," said Belshazzar, when the interpreter had
rendered them all. "I thank you who with the wind of truth have
blown away certain mists of falsehood which perplexed me, who
purpose both for reasons of policy and of love," here he devoured
Myra with his fierce and greedy eyes, "to repair the wrong done
in error to your son's daughter by my father Nabonidus, one ever
easy to deceive, by taking her to wife, thus wiping away that
insult with the highest honour I can bestow. Be pleased to
withdraw, royal Chloe, till we meet again presently at my feast
when these nuptials will be declared. In your chamber you will
find certain gifts not unworthy of her from whom sprang a queen
of Babylon, with which I trust you will adorn your beauty at the
feast; also the decrees conferring upon you titles of nobility
which in Chaldea we think high."</p>

<p>When these words had been translated, Belshazzar rose and
bowed to my mother, and she&mdash;poor besotted creature,
prostrated herself before him as in her youth she was wont to do
before Pharaoh whose woman she had been. Then muttering thanks,
she withdrew with her following, forgetting in her joy and
triumph even so much as to look at me, her son, who, although she
guessed it not, she had condemned to death.</p>

<p>When she was gone Belshazzar dismissed most of those who stood
about him, so that there remained only a scribe, a captain and
four soldiers, three eunuchs, big, fat fellows with villainous,
wrinkled countenances who, as I heard afterwards, were the chosen
ministers of his pleasures; and some veiled women attending upon
Myra, who from the way in which they moved, to me appeared to be
jailers rather than waiting-maids. They went and there followed a
space of heavy silence like to that which precedes the bursting
of a tempest. All there felt, I think, that something terrible
was about to happen, for even the soldiers and the hard-faced
eunuchs looked moved and expectant.</p>

<p>Belshazzar descended from his high chair and stood in front of
me, glowering, his evil face full of hate and jealous rage.</p>

<p>"You have heard," he said in that horrible soft voice of his.
"Now what have you to say, half-bred dog of an Egyptian whose
mother was a Grecian strumpet, you who came to Babylon upon a
vile errand? Before you speak, learn that all this while you have
been known and watched, aye, even while I was absent. After you
were taken spying for Cyrus under a false name, the king my
father protected you because you have some smatterings of
learning and flattered him. He died and you and the traitor who
is known as Belus, strove to escape with yonder lady under an
order that you had cheated from him. But my officers outwitted
you. The lady was taken in the gate, though owing to a storm bred
of the wizardry of Belus, you and he vanished, as I think after
killing my officer. Then you took shelter under the robe of the
Hebrew prophet who is called Belteshazzar, knowing that none dare
touch you there because of the superstitions of the Babylonians
who believe that his house is fenced by spirits from the
underworld. There, perhaps, you might have stayed safe enough,
had it not pleased you to make use of that poor wretch whose
corpse you saw but now, as a go-between with the lady Myra.</p>

<p>"In answer to your messages she wrote you a letter which was
seized, copied and then delivered by your tool, Obil. To-day,
another letter was forged and given to you to serve as bait to
draw the jackal from his hole. You came out of your lair and were
met by a woman, because to have sent soldiers to take you would
have been dangerous in a city that is full of treachery, thanks
to your friend Belus and others, though that woman, the wanton
Adna, knew not why she was sent, thinking only that she played a
part in some love business from which she would draw gold. So
through your own blind folly at last you came into my hands,
where there is no prophet to protect you with the magic of the
devil that he worships."</p>

<p>He paused a while, glaring and gnashing his teeth. Then he
went on,</p>

<p>"And now from the lips of that vain painted hag, your mother,
lured here for this purpose, we have learned the truth, or what
will serve as well, for who can doubt a mother's testimony
concerning the son she bore? The lady whom you pretend to be your
wife, is certified by your mother to be your own daughter and you
are a wretch unfit to live, as all here and in Egypt will
acknowledge, yes, even Amasis himself. Therefore I doom you to
die, who on the head of your private crimes, have piled that of
making trouble between Babylon and Egypt at a time when Babylon
needs Egypt's help. Do you hear that you are condemned to
die?"</p>

<p>"I hear, O King, that like every man&mdash;even the King
himself&mdash; I am condemned to die," I answered slowly, for
these words came to me. "Yet before I die I would say to you what
you know already, that all this tale is false. Whatever my mother
may have told you in her vanity and delusion, yonder woman is not
my daughter but my wife."</p>

<p>"Dog!" he answered, smiting me in the face, "will you also
defile your own mother? Well, soon we shall hear another story
from you. Doubtless you think to pass hence swiftly and without
pain. It is not so. You shall perish very slowly, as a monster
who would take his own daughter for a wife and who slanders his
mother is doomed to do under our ancient law. There is much that
I would learn from you ere you yield your breath, concerning the
doings of your familiar Belus who is reported to have gone hence
to plot against me and Babylon with Cyrus the accursed Persian.
Soldiers, away with him to the torment!" and he clapped his
hands.</p>

<p>Then Myra who all this while had listened immovable, sprang
forward and threw herself into my arms.</p>

<p>"He is my husband, not my father. If he must die, let me die
with him," she cried.</p>

<p>"Drag her away," said the king, and they obeyed him.</p>

<p>Yet as she was torn from me, she thrust something into my hand
which swiftly I hid in my robe, guessing that it was poison.</p>

<p>"Farewell, beloved wife," I said. "Soon we shall meet before
God's judgment seat, we and this king."</p>

<p>As the soldiers haled me towards the curtains the captain who
had departed to give orders returned.</p>

<p>"O King," he said, "the King's command cannot be carried out
on the instant."</p>

<p>"Why not?" shouted Belshazzar.</p>

<p>"O King, the tormentors, fearing the just vengeance of the
King that he had promised to them because of the death of Obil,
are themselves all dead. Yes, there they lie dead, the four of
them, having, as I think, swallowed their own tongues after the
Ethiopian fashion."</p>

<p>"Send for others instantly," said the king.</p>

<p>Then the private scribe prostrated himself, saying,</p>

<p>"O King, the business will be long, for such instructed,
devilish folk live by themselves at a distance and it is almost
the hour of the great feast. Shall we not behead this man at once
and make an end?"</p>

<p>"Nay," Belshazzar answered, "for I would court this daughter
of his to the music of his groans. It will be sweet!"</p>

<p>He thought a while, then added,</p>

<p>"Bring him to the feast and guard him well, placing him under
my own eye that I may be sure of him, who perhaps is also a
magician and can vanish away like Belus. When the feast is over
lead him here again where I and my new-made wife will talk with
him. Bid more tormentors await us here with their instruments and
see to it that they are the masters of their filthy company. On
your heads be it!"</p>

THE WRITING ON THE WALL</h2>

<p class="first">
IT was the great feast of King Belshazzar, given to celebrate
his coming to the throne of Babylon, to attend which had been
summoned all the satraps, high officers and nobles throughout the
empire. From east and west and north and south, in obedience to
the royal command, they had gathered together in Babylon like
vultures to the carcase, and waited there until the king returned
from war to hold this coronation feast. The enormous central hall
of the palace was filled with their glittering multitude, seated
at scores of tables all down its length and even between the
towering side columns that bore up the roof. In the centre there
were no columns because this roof did not stretch from wall to
wall and here the hall was open to the sky. Nor was one needed at
this season of the year when no rain fell.</p>

<p>The night was hot and the air so still that the thousands of
lamps and torches burned without a flicker; even the flame of the
candles in the golden candlesticks that had been taken from the
sanctuary of the House of God at Jerusalem, pointed straight to
heaven like fingers of fire.</p>

<p>The king's seat was at the high table, and behind him, at a
distance, was the white wall at the end of the great chamber. All
down this table on either side of the throne were placed his
noblest lords, his queens and his concubines, flashing in
jewelled robes. Among these women on one side sat Myra, tall,
pale, beautiful, adorned as a bride; and on the other side my
mother Chloe, wearing the royal uraeus of Egypt to which she had
no right, and covered with gems, among them, upon her heart,
those that Belshazzar had promised to her as his royal gift.
Below this table stood another occupied by officers of the royal
household, and at this board I, Ramose, was given a place looking
up towards the king, so that I might be in the king's eye as he
had commanded. At my back stood armed guards, and on either side
of me were chief eunuchs of the household who wore daggers in
their belts.</p>

<p>When the countless company was gathered, a trumpet blew,
heralds cried for silence, and the king entered. All rose from
their seats and prostrated themselves before his majesty, lying
on the floor like to dead men. He waved his sceptre, not that
broken sceptre I had spurned, but another which a eunuch told me
had belonged to a dead king. Thereon they stood up again and the
feast began.</p>

<p>I watched it like one in a dream, touching nothing of that
rich food which to my sight was viler than carrion, although with
cruel courtesy the eunuchs pressed it on me, saying that as this
would be my last meal, it was wise that I should eat, drink and
be merry. Then, after their beastly fashion, the chief of them
who had been present that night at the audience given to my
mother, described to me how horribly I should be made to die;
also what Myra must suffer if she turned from the king, all too
hideous to be written.</p>

<p>Much wine was drunk and soon it became evident to me, watching
and listening to what, as I believed, were the last voices I
should hear on earth, that there were two parties in that hall
which hated each other. For here and there quarrels flared up
suddenly, even blows were given, until the guards who were
everywhere, put an end to them with heavier blows.</p>

<p>At length the king rose and spoke, and I who sat not far from
him, could hear every word he said. He told of the war with the
Persians, boasting much and saying that Cyrus and his generals
were already as dead men, for though at first they had met with
some small success, their armies had now fallen into a trap and
would beat vainly against the mighty walls of Babylon, like
little waves against a mountain side. Some applauded these
sayings, whereas others received them with mutterings, especially
those whose sons and brothers had fallen in the battles or been
taken prisoners and sold as slaves.</p>

<p>"I have good news for you, lords, rulers, captains and people
of Babylon," went on the king. "There has been trouble between us
and Egypt, brought about by spies, mischief-makers and
liars"&mdash;here, as I thought, he glared at me. "That trouble
is at end. Pharaoh is our ally again and will support us with his
armies in our struggle against the Persian dogs. To seal our pact
this very night I take to wife a lady of the royal blood of
Egypt," and he pointed to Myra who sat still as a woman carved in
stone, whereon all who could hear him rose and stared at her,
appraising her beauty.</p>

<p>"Fear not," he went on, boasting madly, "I will lead Babylon
to such glory as she has never known; guided by our ancient gods,
again I will make of her the queen of the world. There are no
gods like to the gods of Babylon who have smitten those of all
the peoples. Some talk of Jehovah of the Hebrews. Where is this
Jehovah? Behold! we have pulled him down from heaven. Babylon has
sacked his sanctuaries, slaughtered his priests upon his altars
of sacrifice, and taken his treasures as spoil. Ho! bring in the
vessels from his house, those glorious vessels that were holy in
the sight of this fallen cheat Jehovah."</p>

<p>Thereon men who were waiting bore in the golden vessels; the
cups, the ewers and the basins, the receptacles of sacrifice and
the lavers that had been sacked from the temple at Jerusalem.
They bore them in with ribald shouts and lo! in each of them
decked with flowers, was set some image of a god of the empire of
Chaldea; gods of stone and ivory and wood, grinning and
triumphant idols. They set the vessels down on the high-table
while half-naked women jeered and mocked at them and into one of
the most splendid Belshazzar cast the dregs of his wine,
crying,</p>

<p>"Accept this drink-offering, O Jehovah, conquered demon of
Judah!"</p>

<p>It was done and he fell back upon his throne panting and
rolling his fierce eyes, while he waited for the shouts of
acclamation that were to follow upon his vile words.</p>

<p>But no shouts came, at first I knew not why till it seemed to
me, while I wondered, as though some shadow was passing down the
length of that hall, yes, a winged shadow that could be felt
rather than seen. Then I understood. After the passing of the
shadow followed a heavy silence, for all were afraid. All knew
that Death was of their company.</p>

<p>The silence lasted while one might count a hundred. Then over
against me, at the far end of the hall, the shadow reappeared and
thickened. Yes, against the white wall that towered high at the
back of the king's seat, it began to take form and the form it
took was that of a great hand which held a pen of fire. Such at
least was its fashion to my eyes.</p>

<p>More&mdash;that hand began to write upon the lofty wall.
Slowly it wrote with the pen of fire, tracing strange characters
that I could not read, letters of flame which burned more
brightly than iron at its whitest heat and were, each of them, of
the height of a tall man.</p>

<p>Those of the feasters who sat far off were the first to see
this dreadful writing, which the king and those about him saw not
because it was behind them. They stared astonished and terrified;
in utter silence they sat still and stared. Heavy was that
unnatural stillness and dreadful was the gloom which gathered
over the lower part of the chamber, as though some mighty shape
floated there, cutting off the light of the moon and stars. Yet
the lamps shone on beneath and by them could be seen the white,
up-turned faces and the staring eyes of all that multitude of
watchers.</p>

<p>"What ails our guests?" asked Belshazzar, gazing at those
white faces and those terror-stricken eyes, and his voice sounded
loud in the quiet.</p>

<p>Now for the first time I noted that Myra had risen. Alone
among the women she had risen from her seat and stood with her
back towards me looking at the wall behind her. Yes, it was she
who answered the king which no other dared to do.</p>

<p>"Behold! O King," she cried and pointed to the wall.</p>

<p>He rose. He turned. He saw the huge black hand that held the
pen of fire and slowly, very slowly, drew letters of flame upon
the whited plaster of the wall, where they shone and sparkled
like to the coals of a furnace heated manifold. Then he sank down
in a huddled heap upon the edge of the table, crying such words
as these:</p>

<p>"What witchcraft have we here? Come forward, appear, all ye my
soothsayers and magicians, and show me the interpretation of this
writing. To him who can read it I will give a great reward, aye,
and set him up as a ruler in Babylon."</p>

<p>Presently from this place and that among the seats allotted to
their Fellowships and Colleges and elsewhere, gathered the
soothsayers, the magicians and all who were reckoned the wisest
among the Chaldeans in the arts of divination. They advanced to
the dais; they studied the characters of flame which one by one
continued to start forth upon the plaster on the wall. But of
them they could read nothing.</p>

<p>Appeared a lady who wore a crown upon her white hair. She came
to the king whose body shook and whose face was ashen with
fear.</p>

<p>"O King my son, live for ever!" she cried. "Let Daniel, the
prophet of Judah, be summoned, he who among the Chaldeans is
named Belteshazzar, for in him is the spirit of the holy gods. He
will interpret this writing, as he interpreted many dark visions
to Nebuchadnezzar the king who went before thee."</p>

<p>So in his terror the king commanded that Daniel known as
Belteshazzar, should be brought before him. Tall, thin,
solemn-faced, black-robed, white-haired, he was led through the
feasters to the dais. As he passed the table where I sat, he
turned and looked at me with his quiet eyes as though in reproach
and wonderment. Then he looked at the eunuchs and armed guards
around me; also at Myra in her bridal robes upon the dais, and
seemed to understand. He climbed the dais and stood before the
king, making no obeisance.</p>

<p>Belshazzar lifted his face from the cloth in which he had
hidden it, and spoke with Daniel in a low voice, as I think
offering him gifts, but what he said and what Daniel answered I
could not hear. At length the prophet stepped back to the end of
the dais and gazed upward at the letters which flamed upon the
wall, for now the hand that wrote them with a pen of fire was
seen no more.</p>

<p>"This is the meaning of the writing, O thou King that mockest
the Most High God and defilest the vessels of His house," cried
the prophet in so loud a voice that all in the hall could here.
"Numbered, numbered, weighed and divided. Yea, thy days are
numbered! Yea, thou art weighed upon the balances! Yea, thy
kingdom is brought to an end! The Medes and the Persians take
it!"</p>

<p>Now the king drew near to Daniel, imploring the prophet to
take away this curse, or offering him gifts, I know not which,
for the groans of fear that rose from all who heard, covered up
his words. But the prophet waved him back and turning, departed
from that hall, looking neither to right nor left.</p>

<p>In silence he went, in silence all watched him go; then, as
though at a word of command, suddenly there was tumult. A madness
fell upon the company and the rage of terror. Women screamed, men
raved and shouted, the king flung himself face downward on the
table, rolling his head from which the crown had fallen, from
side to side; a fainting concubine caught at a tall light and
overset it, firing her robes, and rushed shrieking to and fro.
Here and there men drew swords from beneath their cloaks and
struck at the lamps, extinguishing them. As though their use was
ended and their message given, the fiery letters upon the wall
faded and vanished, so that at last the only light left in the
great place was that which came from the moon floating over head.
Then voices cried,</p>

<p>"Down with Belshazzar! Away with the tyrant! Kill the cruel
dog who tears us and brings maledictions upon us! Kill the
blasphemer! Shut the doors! Stab the guards!" and I understood
that there was rebellion here.</p>

<p>Those for the king and those against him began to fight and
die. Groans echoed everywhere. Belshazzar sprang up and
accompanied by his court lords and women, rushed towards the
private entrance behind them, seeking to escape, for they knew
that the curse had fallen and the hour of doom was near. Some of
that glittering mob were overthrown and trampled, among them my
mother. I heard her scream my name; I saw her fall and vanish
beneath the stamping feet. Forgetting everything I rose to rush
to her aid, for was she not still my mother! None hindered me,
for hoping to save themselves, the eunuchs and the guards had
gone I know not where. I snatched up a jewelled sword that had
fallen from some prince's hand; I leapt on to the dais and ran to
the spot where I had last seen my mother.</p>

<p>There she lay, her fair face crushed, her splendid robes red
with blood. Already a thief had been at work upon her jewels, one
of the black slaves, for I caught sight of him slinking away with
the necklaces glittering in his hand. More, he had driven a knife
into her throat to still her struggles while he robbed her. She
was dead. Yes, poor, foolish woman, such was the end of her and
all her vanities!</p>

<p>I bethought me of Myra and looked round. At that moment the
moon that had been half hidden by a cloud, shone out fully. Lo!
there she sat in her place at the high table whence she had never
stirred, so still that I thought she must be dead, so beautiful
that I wondered for a moment whether it were she herself or
perhaps her spirit.</p>

<p>Leaping over the fallen who lay, some quiet, some yet
struggling, I hastened to her. She saw me and whispered,</p>

<p>"I awaited you. Let us away from this hell."</p>

<p>"Aye, but whither?" I asked. "The doors are closed."</p>

<p>She sprang from her chair, saying,</p>

<p>"Follow me!"</p>

<p>A man appeared; it was the captain of those eunuchs who had
sat by me at the feast and told me of the torments I must endure
and of the shame that would be worked on Myra. He tried to seize
her, shouting,</p>

<p>"She is the king's!" for in his mad bewilderment the poor
wretch could only bethink him of his duty and that he must guard
the royal women.</p>

<p>I ran him through with the sword. As he went down his long
dark cloak fell from him. I caught it up and threw it over Myra's
gorgeous bridal robe, drawing the hood over her head. Then
heeding him no more, though it would have been wiser to make sure
that he was dead, we ran on, following the wall. Myra came to a
screen of cedar-wood behind which serving-men were wont to pass
bearing dishes, as she remembered who knew the palace well. She
peered down the little passage to learn whether it were empty,
and I glanced back at the hall. As Myra had said, it was a hell
in which everywhere men were murdering each other and thieves
plied their business fiercely, there being much to steal. Many,
however, were trying to escape, rushing madly from door to door
to find them barred in obedience to the command of the
conspirators, most of them doubtless in the pay of Cyrus the
Persian, who had hoped thus to catch and kill the king.</p>

<p>Yelling, they ran to and fro while their enemies, coming
after, hacked them down and, ere the breath had left them,
thieves from among the palace servants and even soldiers, who
having no pay lived by what they could seize, robbed them of
their finery.</p>

<p>Such was the end, or at least the last I saw of Belshazzar's
mighty coronation feast, the greatest that ever had been held in
Babylon; yes, these terrors and towering above them, white in the
moonlight, the wall whereon but now God's finger had written His
decree.</p>

<p>We crept down the passage and came to the court of the
scullions, off which opened the kitchens and the quarters of the
cooks, a village in themselves. We fled across that court and
found another that Myra did not know, for many a city was smaller
than this palace. Here beneath awnings and columned porticoes men
and women were revelling on this festal night, for as yet news of
what had chanced in the great hall did not appear to have reached
them. From the look of these women and all that passed around us,
I guessed at once that this was the quarter of the players and
dancers, also of the courtesans who were making merry with their
gallants.</p>

<p>While we hesitated, hiding ourselves as best we could, the
tidings came, whence I could not see. The men thrust away their
darlings and sprang up, drawing their swords and gazing about
them suspiciously. Discovering us, after demanding their password
which we could not give, certain of them began to hunt us,
shouting that we were spies who must be killed. We slipped away
from them and hid in the deep shadows of a portico while they ran
about like hounds that have lost the scent.</p>

<p>A woman glided up to us and peered into my face.</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought it!" she said. "Now, Friend, if you would save
yourself and that beautiful companion of yours, follow me, for I
tell you that wolves are on your trail."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" I gasped doubtfully.</p>

<p>"How soon men forget the voices of those they thought fair
enough to hold close not a sunrise ago!" she said with a light
laugh.</p>

<p>Then I knew that this was the lady of the litter, one whom I
could trust, and whispered to Myra that she must come. Our guide
passed on through many gloomy passages, and we followed, leaving
the shouts behind us.</p>

<p>"Who is this woman?" asked Myra suspiciously, "and whither
does she take us?"</p>

<p>"Her name is Adna," I answered, "one in whom I have faith. Oh!
stay not to question. She is our only hope."</p>

<p>"A poor one, I think," murmured Myra. Yet she obeyed me and
was silent.</p>

<p>At length we came to a little door which Adna opened with a
key that hung to her girdle.</p>

<p>"Hearken, Friend," she said. "This door has no good name, yet
it may serve your turn, for it leads from the palace wall to the
street that is called Great. Descend those steps, there are
twelve of them, and turn down the passage to the right where I
think there is no guard, and you will be in that street where no
one will note you. Farewell, Friend. Thus I pay you and someone
else for a certain honest kiss. Farewell, and may the gods who
have forgotten me, always remember you, as I shall."</p>

<p>Then the door shut behind us. We ran down the steps. We
followed the passage at the end of which, used as a shelter from
sun and rain by the sentry who watched this gate, was a niche in
the wall that now was empty, as Adna had said it would be, why I
do not know. Watching our moment, we slipped out into the street
called Great where many people were afoot, although the hour grew
late. All of these were disturbed as was shewn by their gestures
and the way in which they chattered to each other; doubtless some
rumour of the terrible happenings in the palace had reached them,
or other news of which I knew nothing. Therefore, as it chanced,
we were little observed, for when its inhabitants felt the cold
shadow of the Arm of God stretched out over Babylon, they took no
heed of one whom they held to be some court noble passing with a
cloaked woman.</p>

<p>"Whither go we?" whispered Myra.</p>

<p>"Anywhere away from this accursed palace," I replied, as
though at hazard, but all the while I was wondering where we
could shelter? In one place only &mdash;the guest-house of
Daniel&mdash;that was the answer. It was fortunate indeed that
during the weary months that I had lain hidden in this house I
had so often beguiled the time by studying the streets of Babylon
from its high roof, for now the knowledge I had gained came to
our aid. Following these as I saw them in my mind, I led Myra
from one to another until at length before us was the mount
crowded with dwellings, on the crest of which were the walls of
the old temple that hid the secret entrance to the prophet's
guest-house. To encourage Myra I pointed to them.</p>

<p>"Behold our refuge!" I whispered.</p>

<p>"Then may we gain it swiftly, for oh! Ramose, we are
followed."</p>

<p>I glanced back; it was true! Two cloaked men were dogging us,
spies I supposed, or watchers sent out when Myra was missed.
Perhaps that captain of the eunuchs whom I had cut down gave the
alarm before he died.</p>

<p>"Now run your best," I said, and clinging to my arm she did
so, though all her finery and the heavy cloak weighed her down
and cumbered her feet.</p>

<p>We reached the walls and rushed into them by the little
twisting path. Now the men were not more than twenty paces from
us and I must almost carry Myra. Yet in that dim uncertain light,
for the moon was sinking low behind the city's great encircling
wall, they lost sight of us, turning to the right whereas we had
turned to the left into the mouth of the path. I stumbled on
dragging Myra with me; we came to the hidden door. Then with
horror I remembered that it was locked and that I had no key,
also that at this hour of the night it would be hard to rouse the
servants who slept far away. Oh! surely we were lost, for if we
knocked or called, those men would hear us and return. I gazed at
Myra and I think that even through that gloom she must have seen
the agony on my face, for she panted,</p>

<p>"What now, Beloved?"</p>

<p>"Only this, Myra. If you still have that poison, make it
ready, unless you would be borne back to yonder
palace&mdash;where Belshazzar waits."</p>

<p>"Never!" she exclaimed and began to search in her robes, while
I did likewise to find the bane which she had given me in the
presence-chamber, that I might use it now, should the sword fail
me.</p>

<p>Then when all seemed lost the God we worshipped spoke a word
in heaven and saved us. Suddenly the door opened! We rushed
through. It shut again and the bolts went home.</p>

<p>"Be silent," whispered a voice out of the darkness, "be silent
and stir not," and I knew it for that of the man Nabel who on the
afternoon of this very day had brought me the basket of figs
which hid the forged letter.</p>

<p>We stood still as the dead and next moment heard footsteps
outside the door.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they went in here," said a voice.</p>

<p>"Not so," answered a second voice. "Surely I saw them run the
other way."</p>

<p>"Still ought we not to seek help and break down the door which
we have no tools to do?" said the first voice, "It seems strong
and is locked."</p>

<p>"Nay, let it be," came the reply, "for I have no mind to tramp
back to that palace where all is drunken riot and fighting,
perhaps to get a spear through the belly for my pains. Nay, I
shall wait till dawn and make report to the captain of the inner
gate, according to the established custom in the matter of palace
fugitives. We have our clue; it is enough. Come, brother, I know
a tavern not half a mile away where they don't quarrel with late
comers and the mistress keeps good wine. We will go sleep
there."</p>

<p>"So be it, for we have done our best, but be careful of that
trinket," said the first voice. Then the pair of them tramped off
wearily.</p>

<p>Nabel led us down the passage to a little chamber at the foot
of the stairs, where a lamp burned, by the light of which he
looked at us curiously.</p>

<p>"How came you to be at that door, Friend?" I asked.</p>

<p>"My lord, the prophet returned here a little while ago,
Master, and bade me watch by it till daylight, and if I heard any
without to open at once, and should it be you and a lady, to
admit you and close swiftly. These things I did, and it seems at
the right time, though how he knew that you were coming he did
not say."</p>

<p>I stared at him who also wondered how he knew that we were
coming. Then I asked,</p>

<p>"Where is the prophet? We would speak with him."</p>

<p>"You cannot, Master. He told me that he was leaving Babylon
instantly and would not return before to-morrow, if then; after
which he departed with some cloaked companions whom he met
without. Will you not ascend? Food and wine are set in the
eating-chamber, as the prophet commanded, and one waits you
there. Oh! be not afraid. She is a woman and harmless."</p>

<p>Taking the lamp we crept up the stairs, I going first with my
sword ready. On a couch in the eating-chamber sat a woman,
moaning and rocking herself to and fro. She looked up and we saw
that it was Metep!</p>

<p>"Oh! my fosterling," she cried in a thick voice, "my
fosterling whom I thought dead, and your husband, the lord Ramose
also, who those chamber-girls said had been taken to the
torture-room. Alive&mdash;both of you alive! Oh, that holy man
must be a god."</p>

<p>"What holy man?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The prophet. I was at the back of the hall when the fighting
began and I fled screaming with other women&mdash;I know not
where. Then suddenly the prophet appeared among us. He took me by
the hand, he led me away, and I remember no more till I found
myself in this place. Oh! without doubt that prophet is a
god!"</p>

<p>We drank wine; we ate food. Aye, we ate and drank with
appetite for never were meat and drink more needed. Then side by
side we knelt down, returning thanks to Him we worshipped Who so
far had saved us from such great perils. We rose and as we did so
Myra, who had thrown off the eunuch's cloak, looked down at her
glittering bridal robe and uttered a little cry of dismay.</p>

<p>"What is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she answered, "my lily. I have lost my lily in the
crystal case."</p>

<p>"Let it go," I said smiling, "for you have found him who gave
it to you."</p>

<p>She looked at me and I looked at her, until the blood flowing
to her pale face stained it red as roses. Then forgetting all,
yes, even the dreadful end of my mother, I opened my arms.</p>

<p>Whispering, "Husband! Oh! my husband!" Myra sank into
them.</p>

<p>It was morning. Metep called at our door awaking us from
sleep.</p>

<p>"Arise," she cried. "Armed men are without. They break through
the walls!"</p>

<p>We rose and clothed ourselves as best we could. I looked from
the window-places. Soldiers were hacking at the door, four of
them, while behind, urging them on with many oaths, stood one
wrapped in a dark cloak whom from his shape and voice, I guessed
to be the baulked Belshazzar himself, come hither mad for
vengeance on me and Myra.</p>

<p>"What shall we do, Husband?" asked Myra faintly, for she too
had seen.</p>

<p>"Fly to the roof," I answered, "and take your poison with you,
Wife, to swallow if there be need. Or if it pleases you better,
should the worst happen, leap from the parapet to the ground,
after which no king will wish to look on you."</p>

<p>"And you, Husband?"</p>

<p>"I? I am a man who still have some strength and sword-skill,
although my last years have been peaceful, and while I may I will
hold the stair. Wait. Bid Metep call those two serving-men."</p>

<p>She obeyed and presently they came.</p>

<p>"Friends," I said, "this house, although it be the prophet's
and holy, is attacked by a lord from the palace who desires to
steal away my wife, the lady Myra, and with him are four
soldiers, as you may see for yourselves. Now choose. Will you
help me to hold it, or will you give yourselves up? Before you
answer, learn what befell your companion, Obil. He was caught by
the servants of the king, and yesterday I saw his body at the
palace, torn to pieces by the torturers. Such will be your fate
also, if you fall living into the hands of yonder men."</p>

<p>Now Nabel, he who had brought me the basket of figs and opened
the door to us, a sturdy fellow with a dogged face, said,</p>

<p>"I stand by you, I who was a soldier in my youth and would
sooner die fighting than on the rack. I go to find my shield and
sword."</p>

<p>The other man, a tall, pale-eyed fellow whom I had never
liked, slipped away, nor do I know what became of him. I trust
that he escaped, though when the soldiers broke into the house I
heard a cry that he may have uttered.</p>

<p>Metep fled to the roof and Myra, before she followed, stayed
to kiss me, saying rapidly,</p>

<p>"Husband, now I am ready for aught. Fight your best without
care for me, for if it comes to it, I, who am all your own, shall
go hence happy, to await you elsewhere. Never will I fall living
into the jaws of yonder dog."</p>

<p>Then looking prouder, I think, than ever I had seen her, she
turned to climb the stair.</p>

<p>I too went to the foot of that stair where I found Nabel
awaiting me, a sword in his hand and a shield of bull's hide of
an old fashion upon his left arm.</p>

<p>"I thought that you had gone with the other," I said.</p>

<p>He laughed and answered,</p>

<p>"Not I! With this sword and shield my great-grandsire fought
the Chaldeans, and I too used them in my youth. Now I would pay
back my grandsire's death upon their accursed race. Better to die
as a warrior than as a dish-bearer."</p>

<p>"Good," I answered. "If we live, you will be glad of those
words, and at the worst they may prove no ill passport to peace.
Now get you behind me, and if I fall, fight on."</p>

<p>This he did though being brave, he would have stood in front,
and we waited, I winding the fine cloak that Nabonidus had given
me round my arm to serve as a shield, for I had none. Soon the
soldiers broke in the door and reaching the foot of the stair,
rushed up at us boldly for they were brave fellows also; moreover
the king watched from below. I drove my sword through the throat
of the first, and he fell. The second cut at me over his body. I
warded the blow with the cloak, but his sword shore through it
and wounded me in the head, causing blood to run into my
eyes.</p>

<p>"Back!" cried Nabel, and I staggered past him up the stair to
the roof. Nabel fought with the third man and it seemed, slew
him. Then he joined me on the roof where Myra and Metep were
wiping the blood from my face with their garments.</p>

<p>The other two soldiers appeared. We sprang at them and that
fight was desperate, but God gave us strength and we slew them.
Then, sorely wounded both of us, we reeled back to the parapet
and stood there in front of the women. Belshazzar came and mocked
at us, but attack he dared not, being a coward in his heart; also
we still had swords in our hands and were upright on our feet
though we could scarcely stir. Nay, he stayed by the mouth of the
stair, waiting for help or thinking that we should bleed to death
or faint.</p>

<p>"I have sent for more men," he cried, "and presently they will
be here to make an end of you, cursed Egyptian. You thought you
had escaped me and so you might have done, had not that strumpet
of yours dropped her trinket as she ran from the palace, telling
my watchers which way she went," and he drew from his robe the
lily talisman set in its case of crystal and waved it in front of
us.</p>

<p>Now he seemed to go mad; indeed I think he was smitten with a
sudden madness like Nebuchadnezzar before him. He raved at us in
vile words. He cursed the God of Judah Who, he said, had sent a
lying spirit to write spells on his palace wall, and the prophet
who had interpreted those spells and changed the company at the
feast into ravening wolves. With a working face and rolling eyes
he blasphemed, he reviled, he uttered horrible threats against
Myra, saying that he would throw her to the soldiers while I died
in torment before her eyes. He defied Cyrus and the Persians,
vowing that he would burn them living, hundred by hundred he
would burn them all; he beat the air, gnashing his teeth, till at
last, able to bear no more, I strove to spring at him, but being
wounded in the thigh as well as on the head, could not, and fell
down.</p>

<p>Belshazzar drew a knife, purposing to finish me, yet in the
end dared not because Nabel still stood over me, sword in hand,
though he might not move. So he began to mock again and talk of
the manner in which we should perish.</p>

<p>"Hark!" he said, "my servants come. I hear footsteps on the
stair. Now look your last upon the sun, accursed Egyptian!"</p>

<p>I too heard a footstep on the stair and whispered to Myra to
be ready to die in such fashion as she chose.</p>

<p>"I am ready, Husband," she answered in a steady voice.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the stair appeared a man. Lo! it was no
soldier of the king, but Belus carrying a sword. Yes,
<i>Belus</i>, come from I knew not whence, haggard and
travel-stained, but with the fire of vengeance burning in
his eyes.</p>

<p>Belshazzar turned and saw him. His fat face paled, his cheeks
fell in, his whole frame seemed to shrink. He staggered back.</p>

<p>"Do you know me again, Belshazzar the King?" cried Belus.
"Aye, you know me well. I am he whose young daughter you wronged
and murdered long ago. I swore vengeance on you then and through
the years far away I have worked and woven, till now at last the
destined hour is at hand and you are in my net. Look yonder," and
he pointed to a wide street of the city beneath us. "What do you
see? Soldiers marching, is it not? Behold their banners. They are
not yours, O King of Chaldea. Nay, they are those of Cyrus. I,
Belus, have corrupted your captains; I have opened the gates of
unconquered Babylon; you and your House are fallen; God's curse
is fulfilled and my vengeance is accomplished!"</p>

<p>Belshazzar looked. He saw, he began to whine for mercy. Then
suddenly he stabbed at Belus with the knife he held. But Belus
was watching and before it could fall he drove at him with his
sword, piercing him through and through.</p>

<p>Belus stooped; lifting the lily talisman that had fallen from
Belshazzar's hand, he gave it back to Myra. Yes, there, amongst
the dead, he gave it back to her without a word.</p>

<p>Thus died Belshazzar, King of the Chaldeans, Lord of the
Empire of Babylon, by the hand of one whom he had wronged, he to
whom it was appointed that he should be slain on the night of the
writing on the wall.</p>

<p>Here ends the history of Ramose the Egyptian, son of Apries,
and of Myra his wife, a daughter of the royal race of Judah,
written at the Happy House in Memphis, by this Ramose when he and
his wife were old, that their children's children might be
instructed and pass on the tale to those who come after them, of
how God saved them out of the hand of Belshazzar, King of
Babylon.</p>
