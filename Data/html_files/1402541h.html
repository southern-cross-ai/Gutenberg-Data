<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>I. &mdash; ON THE SEA</h2>

<p class="first">An interesting question raised by the incident we
have to tell is this: How far is it true that children inherit the
traits of their parents? The son, the father&mdash;a racehorse is
usually a racehorse; but is the son, the father, a Napoleon, a
Napoleon? On the contrary, history teaches that no great man ever
had a great son.</p>

<p>A child's resemblance to its parents may sometimes arise after
its birth; for constant intimacy is alone sufficient to produce
resemblance. Thus, the late President McKinley came to look like
his wife's brother; and so with many couples.</p>

<p>For years the child's existence is all mixed up with its
parents'. How many kisses, forbidden hours of sleep in the drowsy
mother's bed! Therefore, if either parent has a disease, the child
can hardly escape. Later on he will be told that his consumption is
"hereditary," but it may have originated since his birth.</p>

<p>No one would question the fact of heredity: we only remark that
the extent to which we now believe in it is "not proven" in the
case of that mysterious animal, man; and we are led to the
reflection by a singular case which happened on board a ship some
forty five years ago.</p>

<p>She was the <i>Africa</i>, and was one of those Union line mail
boats that ply between the Cape and Southampton before the Castle
line was formed to share with the Union line half the Government
subvention, about 1870. They were small boats (compared with the
present monsters) of 1,000 tons or so, of the kind which it was the
fashion to call "tin-kettles:" half steamer, half sailing-ship,
brigantine-rigged, with one funnel; and the postage of a letter to
the Cape was&mdash;one shilling.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Africa</i>&mdash;a certain Captain
Denner&mdash;was a handsome man of forty, with a large freckled
face, who might have done very well for a model of Charlemagne, or
some old sea-king, only that his long beard was black. He had a red
birth-mark, the size of a penny, across his left temple. His lips
were rather thick, and his moustache, parting in the middle, showed
their strong pressure there. Though rather taciturn at times he was
a good captain, popular with the passengers: and the voyage went
well, till they reached the latitude of Madeira. At that time, by
the way, it lasted thirty days, not sixteen, as now.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning, then, near Madeira, the vessel moving
through a calm sea, the passengers were assembled at prayers, which
were conducted by a clergyman who happened to be aboard. Among them
were two ladies, a Mrs Drayton and a Mrs Hartwell, both of whom
were about to become mothers.</p>

<p>It was noted as an odd thing that the captain was not at the
service; no one, in fact, had seen him at all that morning. The
first officer had knocked at his door, but the captain, without
opening, had called back, in a strange voice, the strange words:
"Go away."</p>

<p>However, the clergyman had not yet reached the Litany, when the
captain appeared at the door of the dining-saloon, where the
worshippers were. Their backs were turned to the door, but when the
clergyman stopped, with gaping mouth, the others looked round and
saw the captain.</p>

<p>He had on nothing but a shirt and drawers. Some open ports, with
a wellhole communicating with the smoke-room above, gave plenty of
light, and he was distinctly seen: his rich, black hair seemed to
stand on end, his eyes were wild, and in his hand was a
revolver.</p>

<p>As all stared at this apparition he lifted his right arm,
uttered the sound "bang," and shot the clergyman dead. He then
turned the weapon a little, uttered the same sound, and sent
another into eternity. The third shot pierced Mrs Drayton's right
forearm; the fourth wounded the purser in the breast; the fifth
killed a passenger who was running to seize the madman. This scene
somehow affected the witnesses of it, not merely with terror, but
with some sort of ghostly awe, which left all the survivors, male
and female, in a state of nervous ruin for days. Before the fifth
shot, all the ladies had fainted.</p>

<p>A rush, however, was made by the men, the lunatic was mastered,
put into irons, and died the same night of the brain disease which
had suddenly seized him.</p>

<p>Four months afterwards, in the town of Bradford, Mrs Drayton
gave birth to a son; six months afterwards, near Rugby, Mrs
Hartwell too, gave birth to a son. And the point which we wanted to
emphasize is this, that these two boys, as they grew to manhood,
bore no resemblance to hereditary types; but each had a raspberry
birthmark the size of a penny on his left temple; and each was the
image of Captain Denner, the captain of the <i>Africa</i>.</p>

<p>In that instant of the captain's apparition at the saloon door
in that one vivid shock of panic, the nervous beings of the two
mothers had leapt, caught, appropriated, and kodaked the captain's
image.</p>

<p>And for thirty-eight years after that Sunday on the sea those
two portraits of the captain of the <i>Africa</i> lived in England
unconscious of each other. But after that stretch of time, the
winds that blew the lives of men like wandering waves of the sea,
blew them together, and they met.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>II. &mdash; ON THE ROAD</h2>

<p class="first">It was on the road between Cromer and
Norwich&mdash;a good road, as many cyclists know, but with some
steep bits, especially toward Cromer end, and there between
Horsham, St. Fay's and Aylsham.</p>

<p>It is late autumn, and all those woods of Stratton, Strawless,
and Blickling, are whirls of dead leaves. The sun is
setting&mdash;bleakly setting; and the storm winds sweeping south
wrinkle the puddles in the road, along which one may walk miles and
not meet a soul.</p>

<p>Certainly, the country has a desolate aspect this evening; the
ground, turned since harvest for the first wheat sowing, looks
black and dead with wet. Hardly a tuft of chrysanthemum in some
sheltered nook still braves the bleakness of wintry winds. The
ferns, and heather of Roughton Heath look scorched by the breath of
a fire. The wind seems to have a grey colour.</p>

<p>Go still further north along the road, and you will find all
that breadth of sand, where the village girls "paddle" through the
summer and catch sea anemones, swallowed up now by the sea. It is
blowing great guns inland, and the flat-bottomed crab boats are
perched in nooks of the cliffs beyond the range of the
breakers.</p>

<p>Beyond Roughton and Aylsham, a motor car comes scorching at a
speed of not less than thirty miles an hour; for the wind blows
keen and, moreover, the driver of this particular twin cylinder is
famous for his illegal pace.</p>

<p>His car is a specially "chic" turn-out, an elongated mass of
double phaeton type, brown-painted, upholstered in green leather,
with French Dunlops, and lightly pitches forward all that weight
over the slushy road a purring Juggernaut&mdash;toward Norwich,
toward London.</p>

<p>On the front seat are two men, thick as bears in a rug, gloves,
and furred coats. Only their noses are cold, but even that little
they resent: they do not know that within two hours they will be
cold all over.</p>

<p>"Dimmed cold," says one.</p>

<p>"Hang the silly storm," says the other.</p>

<p>They are the financier, James Drayton, and his right-hand man,
McCalmont. They have motored together from London to Sheffield to
attend a conference on the pooling of some steel concern, but when
the conference was over, instead of returning direct to London,
Drayton has said to McCalmont's surprise, that he wished to see
someone at Cromer, and at Cromer they have accordingly arrived
about four that afternoon. But whom it could have been that Drayton
wished to see at Cromer, McCalmont, even now, cannot guess. Drayton
apparently had "seen" no one at Cromer. He did separate a few
minutes from McCalmont, but only to go into the <i>poste
restante</i>, where he got a letter, which, after reading, he tore
up. Why, therefore, they have made this detour to the east of
England, McCalmont is still wondering. Drayton must have had some
reason.</p>

<p>In silence they pitch and slip ahead. Steadily hums the car, the
rough wind instruments make music of dead marches about them, the
sun has set and darkness gathers fast.</p>

<p>James Drayton is a big man, with a handsome, large face, florid
and freckled, a black beard, and rather thick lips, whose pressure
is visible at the parting of the moustache. He, too, would do very
well for Charlemagne or a sea-king, as we said of Captain Denner,
of the <i>Africa</i>, whose image he is. His eyes have a hard,
aggressive look, and his appearance somehow tells you that he is a
modern city man to the finger tips, who knows the world familiarly,
uses it, and perhaps abuses it.</p>

<p>They are now at the elevated ground about Ingworth, whence they
can see the darkling valley of the Bure on either hand, and black
before them the woods of Blickling. It is a place where many a
spill has taken place on account of two nasty turnings where the
road crosses bridges, but Drayton proves that he knows the locality
by altering his change-speed gear. The car hastens slower, and
neatly negotiates the ticklish bits.</p>

<p>At the second turning it splashes a man on the road. He is a
tramp&mdash;at least, he is tramping. A little bundle in a red
handkerchief hangs from a stick over his Shoulder. He has no jacket
this inclement night; his boots are ruined; misery is in his eyes,
bitterness in his pressed lips. His name is Robert Hartwell.</p>

<p>And because of the slowing-down of the motor, and because some
greyness still lingers in the dark, therefore Hartwell sees for a
moment that face of Drayton, though Drayton and McCalmont do not
observe Hartwell. And Hartwell thinks to himself, "Well, that man
might be my brother!&mdash;ah, but you seem to be happier than I,
my friend!"</p>

<p>The motor vanishes down the hill towards Blickling, the
lessening voice of its flight still haunting Hartwell's ear drum
like a wasp&mdash;till that, too, is gone. And on he tramps,
muttering bitter at heart, in the same direction as
they&mdash;towards Norwich, towards London, and the tortoise shall
yet beat the hare.</p>

<p>Past the mill, past the farm among the trees, the bridge, the
old gabled manor-house, hedges loaded with the storm, heron, crop
and grebe by the solitary pool, with bat and white owl in the air,
the strange screams of madness in the winds that now fill a
darkness unrelieved by moon or star&mdash;Hartwell continually puts
his feet into puddles without seeing them and sounds come from his
chest!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the motor has not gone far upon the main road, for
soon after crossing the Bure, it has turned aside into rather
obscure country tending to bracken and heath, Drayton having said
to McCalmont: "There ought to be a place just in there somewhere,
which I remember from long ago. Suppose we go and get a glass of
ale, and light up."</p>

<p>McCalmont is surprised, for there is champagne on board, if
Drayton is thirsty, and it is surely not necessary to go to a
tavern to "light up!" but he say, "As you like," and soon Drayton
takes a lane to the left.</p>

<p>A mile in this direction, and they come, to a house behind the
shoulder of a hill&mdash;a rather high house, black with age, with
a physiognomy both picturesque and sinister. The roofs are quaint,
on different levels, some quite small; there are broken external
steps; some of the windows are broader than long, latticed, small
or irregularly placed, and two are dormer windows. Along the front
runs a gut with some water trickling among rocks, and beyond this a
hillside of rocks, pines, and a couple of old huts. Some special
dismalness here causes McCalmont to shiver at the cold, as they
draw up.</p>

<p>"What place is it?" he asks.</p>

<p>"I think it is called 'The Anchor,'" says Drayton.</p>

<p>Some rain begins to be mixed with the wind as they go into a bar
parlour, with a floor of earth stamped hard, and sanded. The light
is dim, but a turf fire burns brightly in the grate. Only one man
is there, a laborer, with his tankard on the bench beside him; and
from his happy posture one may conjecture him not sober. He is the
driver of a manure cart whose horse is enduring all the storm
yonder at the house side. He has still a long way to fare, past
Aylsham, almost on to Marsham, and the entrance of the rich men
rouses him. He pulls himself together, braves the outer night,
mounts and sets off, not uncomforted, for he has a can of beer with
him. We shall overtake him, again be overtaken by him, and again
overtake him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the landlord has drawn some cider for Drayton. Cider
is not McCalmont's taste, but Drayton duly sips his cider.</p>

<p>"By the way, landlord," says he presently, "just take me to a
room: I want to write a letter."</p>

<p>McCalmont is really surprised now. Why on earth&mdash;But
Drayton knows what he is about: he knows that Letty, the landlord's
daughter, is listening behind the inner door, hears what he says,
and will act accordingly.</p>

<p>Barnes, the landlord, has never before seen Drayton, nor Drayton
Barnes; but Letty and Drayton have met this summer on Cromer
pier.</p>

<p>Drayton says to his friend: "Shan't be long," and Barnes says to
Drayton: "This way, sir."</p>

<p>Barnes is a powerful man with a red beard, and a constant frown.
He has a certain air of self-importance above his station, as of
"one who has come down." He and Drayton mount some creaking stairs;
some paper and two candles are placed on a table in a dingy
old-timbered room, then Barnes retires.</p>

<p>Drayton, however, writes no letter, but waits, and in a minute
Letty looks in. She is twenty or so, middle-sized, fair, plump, and
pretty&mdash;not the prettiness of a doll&mdash;there is character
in her face. She is neatly dressed in grey and has quite the air
and speech of a lady, save for a countrified word here or there.
Her hair is firmly built, she has some jewellery, watch and chain,
and smells of lavender, as Drayton puts a kiss on her cheek.</p>

<p>"We mustn't talk here," she whispers, "come&mdash;"</p>

<p>She leads him by the hand through darkness down a back stair
into the open. Nothing is said till they are beyond the kitchen
garden, the stable, the fowl house, the pigs. Then there is a hedge
with a gate, then a plank bridging a rill, then a fir plantation.
Among the firs they stand.</p>

<p>Rain smites their faces, winds catch away their words. Now, too,
there is a vague sound of thunder somewhere, but they heed none of
these things. Each is fully occupied by the other.</p>

<p>"We have only a few minutes," says Letty Barnes.</p>

<p>"What's it all about, my girl?" answers Drayton. "I got your
letter at the Cromer <i>poste restante</i>, but you are cool to
expect a man like me to be running after you."</p>

<p>"Oh, you drop all pretence of love, then, I see?" says
Letty.</p>

<p>Drayton puts his arm round her waist.</p>

<p>"Kiss your old man. I love you all right, girlie&mdash;honestly,
I do, but you mustn't be a bore, Letty. I am prepared to do a lot
for you, if you only know how to manage me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I do know how to manage you, as you are going to see! I
have found out! Not by begging, but by commanding! With all your
experience, you seem to know very little about women, really; and
as to me, you don't know me one little bit! I look like a lamb,
don't I? Aren't you really going to marry me, then, after all?"</p>

<p>"Don't be a goose, Letty; don't be a goose."</p>

<p>"You did promise though, I think, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Let me see: I forget now."</p>

<p>"Ah, a great scoundrel!"</p>

<p>"Little Letty, little Letty."</p>

<p>"A bitter devil, James Drayton!"</p>

<p>"Let not your angry passions rise, my Letty! I'm a
sixty-horse-power for angry passions myself, you know."</p>

<p>"And I! and I! and my father!&mdash;when he finds out. Do you
think, then, that you will be getting off scot free this time? How
silly! We are not common people! Compared to a clown like you, we
are respectable folk, though poor. You dare, James Drayton! Pity
yourself, if you won't&mdash;pity&mdash;me&mdash;"</p>

<p>She suddenly covered her face, and the winds bore away one
sob.</p>

<p>"My good girl," says Drayton, "don't cry, because crying
depresses me; and don't threaten me, because I don't like it, so
don't do it."</p>

<p>"Selfish brute! I never knew what it was to hate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here; be quick. What; is it you want with me?"</p>

<p>"Keep your promise!"</p>

<p>"That all you got to say for yourself?</p>

<p>"What happens to you, if you fail to honor a signed promise to
pay at three months' sight for value received, James? You become a
dead man commercially, don't you? Well, your promise to me is more
binding in my sight than a thousand pieces of paper, and your
failure to keep it shall have the same penalty, my
friend&mdash;death&mdash;social death&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pooh! I am going&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, don't go. I didn't make you come here to quarrel, and waste
words, but to tell you that you are quite in my power. I have
discovered about your engagement to Lady Methwold; you are to be
married in three months, aren't you? But listen to this other fact:
I have taken a trip to your place, Corton Chantry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You!" whispers Drayton; and now his face is suddenly
pallid.</p>

<p>"Ah, that touches you near, James," says Letty. "Yes, I have
been to Corton. It is only nine miles from here, you know. You must
be a scoundrel, really. I will marry you, but within seven months
from now I shall be divorced from you. I shouldn't live with you
for all the crowns&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You been to Corton, girl! What ever for?"</p>

<p>"I don't quite know why: some instinct took me. I had heard that
you kept the place running wild, with only one daft man, named
Steve Anderson, to look after it. That stirred my curiosity, for
lately I have believed you capable of any villainy. So I went, and
I heard screams&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By gad!"</p>

<p>"Yes, screams&mdash;a woman's&mdash;in that north
tower&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You little beggar!"</p>

<p>"Take care! you touch me! you dare! Look here&mdash;can you
see?&mdash;this is a letter which I have ready to send to Lady
Methwold&mdash;"</p>

<p>Drayton is a man of action, and the instant that white object
appears through the murk, he makes a catch at it. His hand meets
Letty Barnes' wrist and seizes it. But he has not to do with a
weakling. Letty is strong, and they proceed to fight like two men,
though there is no reason why they should, really, for if this
letter be got from Letty, she can surely write another, but they
are speedily in that state of mind in which men no longer
reason.</p>

<p>Passion possesses them, pants in their breath, stares in their
eyes.</p>

<p>"Let it&mdash;go you&mdash;shall!" pants Drayton, stooped to her
hand; but Letty's fingers are a vice. Though if it were less dark,
one would see her failing, as with bitten lip and many a jerk and
stumble she endures that rough usage to which Drayton is subjecting
her.</p>

<p>And every moment, as they fight, up and up climbs the
temperature of their rage. The striving for that letter becomes a
mania. Where will it end?</p>

<p>This way frenzy lies. But neither will yield and their breaths
grow louder than the winds.</p>

<p>"Give it&mdash;up you&mdash;shall&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you&mdash;devil&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Letty is white; her hands are sore and burning; she feels
herself going, going; and now she sends out one shriek upon the
night.</p>

<p>McCalmont, who is pacing in the tavern-bar, awaiting Drayton,
says:</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Where?" asks Barnes, the landlord.</p>

<p>"Didn't I hear something like a cry somewhere?"</p>

<p>"Ey, it's the wind," says Barnes; "rough night, rough night. I'd
not care to be out on the road, sir."</p>

<p>But by that cry of Letty's, Drayton has been startled, and in a
moment she has wrenched her hand free, and is gone flying. He
catches her, but misses her, and panting to himself, "No, you
don't," is after her.</p>

<p>She has run back toward the rill and the board-bridge, but she
never reaches it. He has caught her, his hand in the collar of her
dress behind.</p>

<p>"Going to&mdash;drop it?" he pants at her ear.</p>

<p>But she cannot answer. He is choking her. She tries to say that
she yields, then to say "pity," but no whisper comes. Now a
thousand words throng in her throat&mdash;only to speak would be
Heaven&mdash;but no more comes than from dry suction-pumps that caw
and gurgle. Her poor eyes stare in a horror of panic, seeing
Eternity upon her, and the sudden grave yawn to receive her
youth.</p>

<p>"Quick! going to drop it?" he repeats. But how can she answer?
She cannot answer! and her silence adds fuel to his flame.</p>

<p>But the end is not yet; there is a rent of cloth. Something
gives way at her neck. She dives and is running free.</p>

<p>Away from the rill this time&mdash;and he runs after her: but
neither runs fast&mdash;they cannot&mdash;there is a certain
impotence in their run, as when in dreams one would hasten, but
cannot, the limbs are so hampered and heavy.</p>

<p>But of the two it is she who runs the more feebly, and his legs
are long. He gets near again and makes a blow, but a feeble wild
blow, made too soon, which only touches her. She dodges, and is
gone in a changed direction.</p>

<p>And again he is after her, with that same feeble obstinacy, so
deplorable to see. If she can only escape his sight one instant,
how lucky, for she will be lost to him in the dark. But the wood is
fatally sparse, and he never quite loses her. Anon they stumble for
the ground is rough with game-holes, thistle, fern, and furze, and
once Drayton is staggering backward with arms a-struggle in the
air. But he saves himself, and is soon impending again while she,
feeling him near again, with a panic now boundless and lunatic,
throws her soul into the scream:</p>

<p>"Help! he is going&mdash;!"</p>

<p>They are a longish distance from the tavern, but such a scream
as that, that Barnes, her father, behind the bar, cocks an ear and
says to McCalmont, who is pacing with his hands in his
coat-pockets:</p>

<p>"Well, I thought I heard&mdash;Heard anything, sir?"</p>

<p>"No," says McCalmont, "no. Thought I did a while since,
though."</p>

<p>"Ey, it's the blessed wind. It cries out behind the hill at
times, like a woman in trouble."</p>

<p>But Drayton has made another blow at the poor victim, again
without effect. She is nimble, though failing, and during his
momentary stoppage she evades and is off in yet a new direction.
But her end is not far; she is tumbling too frequently&mdash;and
all at once, with a mortal little last cry, she is down. Instantly
he is on his knees over her.</p>

<p>His right forearm presses on her windpipe&mdash;he does not look
at her at all, nor admit to himself that he is killing her. He
looks away sidewards, as if interested in something yonder among
the trees&mdash;</p>

<p>Presently he picks himself up, leans his back against a
fir-bole, peers this way and that and recovers wind a little.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the plantation runs a bend of that same gut
which passes before the tavern&mdash;a square-cut opening in the
ground about ten feet wide and fifteen feet deep. Their run has
brought them so near it that Drayton, leaning against a tree, can
see its edge. He thinks that it is a river, but a mere thread of
water trickles through it.</p>

<p>He goes to the body again, takes the letter to Lady Methwold
from her hand, tears it up, and is about to throw the pieces upon
the wind when he considers himself and puts them into a pocket. He
then draws her ten yards to the gut, over the edge. He listens for
a splash, but hears neither splash nor thud. The winds are in his
ears and it is as though he had thrown her into an abyss of
darkness. She is gone from him.</p>

<p>Now he runs&mdash;thievish, but quick&mdash;back toward the
rill, the bridge, the hedge-gate, past the pigs, the kitchen
garden, up the dark back-stairs. He re-enters the room which he had
left with her. There burn the two candles as before, quietly, as if
nothing had happened meanwhile. He looks at his hands, at his
clothes&mdash;no blood. He takes off his coat and shakes off the
water. But his face! that looks a bit wild; he sees it in a spotted
piece of mirror that hangs from a timber of this old room. He can't
show such a face to McCalmont; there's a scratch, too, under his
left eye. The little beggar must have scratched him somehow.</p>

<p>She is dead, then! He has killed her dead&mdash;unexpected
thing. But it has happened, it is so. He cannot at all recognise
himself, paces the room, misery in his face. Pity he ever met her
that night on Cromer pier; pity he came to her this night; pity she
was ever born&mdash;and he.</p>

<p>"Well, that's as it may&mdash;" He pulls himself together,
glances again at the glass. He will wait a little longer.</p>

<p>Now he has the thought that the number of the sheets given him
may be known to the landlord. He will therefore take one&mdash;will
even write a letter, since he came for that and has time. His mind
is in a state in which thought is fairly active, but not with
perfect rationality. Standing, he covers half a sheet with writing;
but the words are nonsense words, to fill up space. He blots them
on a Life Assurance almanac, in which leaves of blotting paper
alternate with memorandum leaves.</p>

<p>Now he descends and, as he enters the bar, McCalmont says:</p>

<p>"By Jove! you must have written ten letters, old man."</p>

<p>"Only one, boy," answers Drayton, "but that wanted some
thinking, you see. All ready to be off?"</p>

<p>McCalmont has lighted up; all is ready. Drayton slips a couple
of shillings into the landlord's hand and, stepping outside, they
hear Barnes call "Letty!"</p>

<p>Off goes the motor round the hill, down the lane, out upon the
road; and now the darkness is lit by an occasional lightning
flash.</p>

<p>Within four minutes, near Blickling, they come upon Robert
Hartwell, who has tramped thus far with his bundle and stick. He is
aware of the gathering hum of the two dragon-eyes staring nearer
upon him and, stepping aside, he mutters as they dash past.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, they overtake the manure-cart of the laborer
who had left "The Anchor" on their entrance. He sends a drowsy
shout to warn them as they grow near, for he carries no light. And
past him, too, they dash. But he shall overtake them, and again be
overtaken by them.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>III. &mdash; ROBEBT HARTWELL'S
SIN</h2>

<p class="first">We left Hartwell where the road crosses a bridge
in the Bure Valley, and he has tramped on to the second encounter
with the motor, wondering how much bitterer the weather will
become, and if the world is a place designed to torture and oppress
the poor. All the time he is on the look-out for some barn or
hollow tree, in which to rest his frame.</p>

<p>He is a big man, about the size of Drayton, the same
age&mdash;two months' younger&mdash;the same black beard, a longish
oblong of hair; on his left temple the same raspberry mark; his
moustache flows sidewards in the same way, showing the pressure of
rather thick lips, and a definite point in the middle of the upper.
They have the same straight noses, freckle-splashed faces, glossy
hair. Hartwell's photograph would do very well for a photograph of
Denner, captain of the S.S. <i>Africa</i>, dead thirty-eight years
since. So would Drayton's.</p>

<p>Only Hartwell's hands are different from Drayton's. He is not,
however, a working-man of common type; his father was a nail
manufacturer; he himself has spent three years at Rugby School,
though Rugby has receded many a thousand miles from Hartwell
now.</p>

<p>When he was seventeen, his father failed, and died. Then for
three years he maintained his mother by hard work as an under-clerk
in an electrical machine-makers. He was steady&mdash;at one time
even religious&mdash;had abilities and rose higher in his firm. But
his mother died and, alone in the world, he fell in love with a
pretty work-girl, who induced him to marry. She was worthless, and
drank. One day she appeared at the office and made a scene. He was
dismissed. Falling now into misery, he took work at the factory in
whose office he had been a clerk. He has been a working-man ever
since.</p>

<p>But, an excellent specimen of his class, his remarkable mind has
not rusted. He has been a student, a keen watcher of the world's
march in science, thought, invention, social changes. He knows a
great lot about chemistry and biology, reads German, has filled a
pile of note-books with notes at science classes, knows Darwin,
Haeckel, by heart. He has been a sober, sagacious workman, bringing
up his son, Bobbie, as respectably as he could, ever since his wife
died ten years ago.</p>

<p>But he has had misfortunes&mdash;disaster after disaster just
lately, and the iron has entered into his soul. He has seen Bobbie
hungry and one memorable night Bobbie has seen him drunk.</p>

<p>Electricity makes such progress in these days!&mdash;it flies.
The workman can hardly keep pace with the bewildering changes. What
is new to-day will be ancient history to-morrow, and the older
types of craftsmen, their pursuits and habits of mind, already
fixed, see younger men step in and take their place.</p>

<p>Hartwell has made two inventions from each of which he hoped for
wealth, but he lacked the few pounds to patent either. One was
patented for him by a manufacturer, who has given him £20, making
thousands himself by it. The other is still in the air.</p>

<p>He has seen door after door close in his face, and hope has
pined. Too many people seem to be born! something is wrong with the
scheme of things, and there's a "fault" in the Machine. His thick
firm lips pressed together on that Norwich Road, hisses are on his
breath, and now is the winter of his discontent.</p>

<p>Partly by train, partly tramping, he has come from Birmingham to
Cromer, allured by the hope of getting employment in a gentleman's
stable, for an acquaintance had written him of a vacancy there. But
it was filled when he arrived. He is now tramping for London with
the vaguest hopes though, certainly, his boots will never outlast
that length of road. Already his feet are soaked and congealed. The
foxes have holes, but he nowhere to lay his head. His vitals scream
for food.</p>

<p>He does not blame himself&mdash;he knows that he is little to
blame; he does not blame man, nor the devil; his rage is against
the nature of the world. But it does not break out&mdash;he is not
of that sort. Till, just as he comes to that lane leading to "The
Anchor," where Drayton has turned in, some rain, as we said before,
begins to be mixed with the winds and this little thing, though his
mind is of the strongest, irritates Hartwell to fury, and now he
breaks out.</p>

<p>"Curse the rain," he mutters, looking up.</p>

<p>And as on he plods, taunting words come to him, mockeries of
Nature. "A metal-worker's apprentice would have conceived it
better!" he laughs. But the rain only gets worse; there grows a
sound of thunder somewhere in the dark; he breathes a wish that
lightning may strike him dead&mdash;if it can. The lightning can,
but is busy.</p>

<p>During the next two miles, his lips are never silent; and while
he goes muttering James Drayton is doing what we know to Letty
Barnes.</p>

<p>Then again Drayton passes Hartwell on the road and, this time,
that motor-car has upon the usually cold mind of Hartwell an effect
like madness. How brazen a power the thing is! domineering in its
approach, obtrusive in its passage, triumphant in its swift
translation from sight. It has the eyes, the smell, the wings, the
mutter and meditation of an Ogre. It is like a daughter of
Mammon.</p>

<p>Wealth! Hartwell knows what it is, he has stood in mansions. He
knows poverty. As the proud chariot of iron flashes past him, he
has in his consciousness at one and the same moment both
houselessness and the palace, rags and furred robes, the crust and
the fat of turtles. It is a double vision almost, which he has, and
a lust for wealth, more crass and ugly than he has ever felt,
arises and boils in his breast. To shoot in motor cars, anon
crushing some wretch on the road&mdash;to roll in luxury, while
multitude's starve&mdash;how good, he thinks!</p>

<p>"Give me that!" he says, and now he is down on his knees,
frowning, his hands clutched in his hair, for though his fires are
slow to kindle they burn hot and strong, like hard anthracite and
he is praying, but not looking up, looking down, not praying to
heaven.</p>

<p>"Whatever your name Mammon&mdash;Power of the world&mdash;give
me that! Say ten years, five! I will serve you gladly&mdash;say
five years&mdash;from to-night. Will you? Can you? Are you there?
No, you are not there, but if you were&mdash;I offer myself: only
cloy me&mdash;"</p>

<p>His head is bowed right down, frowning, but he rises hastily,
ashamed of himself, muttering:</p>

<p>"No! let it not be said that I have entered my second childhood
at the age of thirty-seven."</p>

<p>But he goes on his way a worse man. Between Blickling and
Aylsham a thought comes into his head of his son, Bobbie, whom he
has left at Birmingham with an old friend. He has tenderly loved
the lad: but he mutters now:</p>

<p>"Selfishness is the law, my friend, I must not care for
you."</p>

<p>Presently, near eight o'clock, he is passing through Aylsham,
his fires burned out now, or only sullenly smouldering within him.
And again in Aylsham he has overtaken James Drayton, and sees him.
It is at the old coaching-house, the "Black Boys;" the motor is
before the door, and since the thunderstorm is over, and hardly any
rain left for the wind to play with, half-a-dozen admiring boys and
girls are gathered round the motor, and Hartwell, too, stops to
admire. In the room behind that window, Drayton and McCalmont are
dining, and there is a space under the blind by which Hartwell,
stooping, spies Drayton, full face.</p>

<p>"Well, certainly," he breathes, "this is odd! there is the same
man again, my own twin brother, as I live. It is said that everyone
has a double. Ah, lucky person, lucky person!"</p>

<p>Five minutes he stoops there, peering, absorbed in the
contemplation of this marvel. Then, with a sigh he straightens
himself, and goes his dreary way&mdash;through Aylsham&mdash;down
the railed footway by the lych-gate and down the hill beyond.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>IV. &mdash; SO SOON?</h2>

<p class="first">Down the long hill trudges Hartwell, his eyes bent
upon the ground in gloomy reverie, and now this thought occurs to
him whether, on the strength of the resemblance between him and
Drayton, it might not be a good thing to turn back and beg a
shilling of the rich man. He had never begged before&mdash;but
hunger and weariness grow pressing&mdash;</p>

<p>He regrets the idea, but it recurs, and he is again considering
it, his eyes on the ground, when he strikes upon something, and his
walk is brought to a stoppage. What is it? a cart lying across the
road, no horse, no driver. It lies tilted, like a stranded ship,
one of the wheels is off.</p>

<p>It is the manure cart of the laborer who left "The Anchor,"
fuddled, when Drayton and McCalmont entered it. We said that they
should overtake them, and they did; we said that he should overtake
them again, and he has, while they dine at Aylsham; but they shall
overtake him again&mdash;or, at least, his cart.</p>

<p>"But the dolt!" thinks Hartwell, "to leave the cart in the
middle of the road this dark night!"</p>

<p>At the breakdown the driver has unspanned, mounted the horse
with all its hames and trailing harness, and gone on to his farm
near Marsham to seek help, for he cannot move the cart: and he has
gone at a walk, happy, singing, and full of hot spiced ale.</p>

<p>Hartwell walks round the cart, lingering, thinking what to do.
He decides to return to Aylsham, and tell some one. But as he turns
to climb, he hears, he sees&mdash;with an alarm which quickly grows
into horror. There is a humming song somewhere, then two dragon
eyes quick coming, and above the dragon eyes two little adder eyes,
clear cut, in the darkness&mdash;the glowing ends of two cigars. At
25 miles an hour they come. Hartwell forgets his vow to do no
good.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he howls, waving, red-faced, running a little up. He
implores as for his own life, "Danger! Stop!"</p>

<p>But in vain. If they hear, they do not understand, nor heed.
There is no time. Drayton has fuddled himself at dinner that he may
forget what lies in the gutter behind "The Anchor." On hums the
motor, and suddenly Hartwell is no more shouting to save others,
but skedaddling to save his own skin&mdash;down again to the
cart&mdash;beyond it&mdash;like one pelting from pestilence. Nor
does he stop till he hears behind him the shock&mdash;a bumping
hubbub, then a rattling and throbbing&mdash;and his eye-corner
catches sight of a sheet of flame vanishing like lightning flash
into the dark.</p>

<p>Then all is still&mdash;all but the wind. Drayton has gone to
meet Letty Barnes.</p>

<p>It was the high side of the tilted cart that had been turned to
the motor, but even so, McCalmont has been shot clean over it, a
long way, like an arrow; and when Hartwell turns back toward the
scene of the ruin, it is upon McCalmont that he first comes. He
finds that the dead man's head has made quite a hole in the ground,
and his neck is obviously broken. Everything can be seen, for the
car has ignited in one spot, and yonder on the road and in the
roadside field are several flames dodging about from the rain, as
petroleum does on contact with water.</p>

<p>Going on to the cart, Harwell finds it bottom upward, some
fifteen feet from where it stood before. It has been turned over
and over, and half of its substance is matchwood. The motor is
still jammed into it, and looks shorter, tilted sideways, and
twisted. The two lights are gone, the font tires burst, and
everything in front of the steering pillar and dash board is a
chaos of dripping debris.</p>

<p>Drayton's body is still in the car, but no longer on the front
seat. He is lying in an ungainly pose across the back seat, with
one foot up on the back of the front seat. Little more remains of
his face than the beard; unlike McCalmont, he has dived head
foremost against the cart, and been tossed by it like a ball.</p>

<p>"Dead as two nails&mdash;" mutters Hartwell.</p>

<p>He himself is rather dazed&mdash;the calamity here is so
pitiful. He walks a little to and fro, not knowing what to do.
Thinking that the driver of the cart may come, he peers along the
road, trotting a little this way and that&mdash;. No driver comes.
All is solitude and aglow from the jumping fires. Some night bird
flies across between the Lombardy poplars that line the road. On
the east is a stretch of bracken, with a pond, on the west a hilly
field, with a rick on the top, just discernible. Some minutes pass.
Hartwell, waiting, shivers with cold.</p>

<p>The next definite thought borne on his head is this: that he,
for his part, will not fail of bed and board this night, that there
is money, watches, on these dead men and it is an ill wind that
blows no one any good&mdash;</p>

<p>He does not delay. He, too, as we said of Drayton, is a man of
action. He approaches Drayton to despoil him and now he thinks:
"this is the one that is my twin&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at that thought he stops and turns as white as McCalmont
yonder. His teeth chatter as at some blast of Arctic cold. For a
time he is like one struck into stone, then he is pacing curiously
this way and that, bent sideways, one hand pressed into his pocket,
the other shouldering his stick. He has invented&mdash;</p>

<p>And all of a sudden he is in a passion of haste, a storm of
action. He is in the car, not yet well ignited, on the back seat
beside Drayton, undressing him; and quick and keen is the work. He
has off collar and tie&mdash;coat&mdash;throws off the braces,
shirt, vest, and now the boots&mdash;they are laced&mdash;pitifully
slow. Now he whips off the trousers, drawers. The earnest labor of
his bosom is hoarser than the storm, but the dead limbs are still
limp, and lend themselves readily to that tugging and hustling. All
is well, that wild glance discerns no one on the road. The dead man
is naked, the clothes lie in a heap on the seat.</p>

<p>In some seconds now Hartwell himself is naked to the waist and
in two minutes he has on the dead man's vest and shirt, collar and
tie. Then, ceasing to dress himself, he dresses Drayton in his own
rags. His hands, all that he touches, are smeared&mdash;so much the
better.</p>

<p>He returns to his own dressing again, tosses off his nether
garments, puts on Drayton's, then dresses Drayton in his own rags.
In proportion, as he becomes Drayton, so Drayton becomes he.
Finally he puts on Drayton's socks, boots, ring, gloves, and
Drayton has on his. He does not use Drayton's hat: he will do
without a hat. He casts his own cap, stick, and bundle away.</p>

<p>Now he leaves the car, drags out the dead man, and places him on
the ground under the front wheels of the motor, between motor and
cart. It will seem to the world that McCalmont and an unknown tramp
have been killed in the accident, but that Drayton has escaped.
Hartwell will be Drayton.</p>

<p>He stands a little, recovering wind. The work is done. No one
comes along the road. After a time he starts to trudge back up the
hill, bareheaded, but warm and rich, toward Aylsham, a new man, in
a wildly new world, with a new name. But what name? That will be
well: there are papers in the dead man's pocket. He feels first in
the lower coat pockets&mdash;that warm coat&mdash;but there he
finds only some shreds of paper, the shreds of the letter which
Letty Barnes wrote to Lady Methwold against Drayton. But in the
trouser are a bunch of keys, in the breast pockets many papers that
will be well about the name and other things. He feels his
strength, he knows that he is sagacious, trusts in himself at
bottom&mdash;</p>

<p>And as to the purse? That is well also. It contains two
sovereigns, and five bank notes. He will feast to-night&mdash;he
will say that the accident has made him hungry afresh. He vaguely
wonders if one can get champagne in Aylsham, and by the time he is
half way up the hill that has become a care to him, he is not for
the moment in a condition of sanity. He wheels on all the
whirlwinds&mdash;</p>

<p>He thinks that if he only had Bobby with him, that would
intensify the pleasure...to see him eat and eat&mdash;But he stops
short at another thought. "Starting from to-night," he has said, "I
will serve you&mdash;only cloy me&mdash;" His fingers touch his
brow. But it soon passes! He laughs audibly: he is not a child.</p>

<p>Moving on again, it occurs to him that it might be well to have
a bruise somewhere. With a stone he strikes his forehead, a good
hard blow which he hardly feels. And now he laughs again&mdash;a
laugh cynical, defiant, triumphant; then immediately his teeth beat
together with ague. But he pulls himself together, proceeds up the
hill, and is soon in Aylsham.</p>

<p>So began the drama of love and pain, which we have to tell.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>V. &mdash; HARTWELL FINDS HIMSELF
A MARRIED MAN</h2>

<p class="first">When Hartwell re-entered Aylsham, he stopped under
a street lamp, and looked at several of the envelopes in the breast
pocket of Drayton's overcoat, which he had on. He saw the words
"James Drayton, Esq.," on them all, and decided that that was the
name which was to be his thenceforth.</p>

<p>He then walked up the empty street to the "Black Dogs," and
entered the old coaching house chilled to the heart with that
feeling of rashness gone crazy, which must have chilled the heart
of the first man who ever stepped into the car of a balloon,
trusting on theory alone, to make the first strange leap into the
air. He was met in the passage by a girl, who started and turned
pale at the sight of the gore on the clothes, at the self-inflicted
bruise on his hatless head and at the streamlets of blood on his
white face. He seemed to her the murdered ghost of the man who, not
twenty minutes before, had dined in boisterous health at the
tavern, and gone away, hearty and happy and half-tipsy in his motor
car.</p>

<p>"There has been an accident," cried Hartwell to her: "just lend
me your shoulder to lean on&mdash;that's a girl&mdash;I can hardly
stand."</p>

<p>She gave him her shoulder and conducted him, step by step, to
the commercial room on the left of the passage, while a number of
people who had caught sight of him from the bar on the right
crowded at the door of the parlour, staring after him till he
disappeared. He sank into the first easy-chair, all sighs, with an
abandoned head and a bent back, while the landlord, who had run in,
and the girl stood over and gazed at him.</p>

<p>"An accident has happened to the car," sighed Hartwell: "my
friend is killed; also a tramp who was on the road. I cannot talk.
Someone run and tell the police."</p>

<p>"Run quick for, some brandy, Maggie,", said the landlord.
"Dreadful thing, sir! How did it happen, sir?"</p>

<p>"I cannot talk," sighed Hartwell.</p>

<p>The girl ran out and quickly ran in again with a glass of brandy
and water, which the landlord held to Hartwell's lips, and Hartwell
drank, sighing with gusto at the end:</p>

<p>"That's a man."</p>

<p>"Feel better now, sir?" asked the landlord, contemplating him,
with his arms akimbo.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's better. Put me to bed, my friend, and let me be
left alone. Ah, no, I feel not well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dreadful thing, sir! Who would have thought half an hour
since&mdash;Maggie, send off John for Dr Richards at once."</p>

<p>By this time two of the other servants of the establishment and
several of the visitors were assembled at the door, craning in to
see.</p>

<p>"No doctor, I think," murmured. Hartwell to the landlord. "I do
not need any&mdash;at least I will not have any. Do not make me
talk&mdash;just put me to bed."</p>

<p>"Just draw off the gentleman's gloves, Maggie," said the
landlord. "I'll take off his coat."</p>

<p>"Leave the gloves and coat for the present," murmured Hartwell,
"you have only to take me to a room, and then give notice to the
authorities."</p>

<p>He now raised himself with pretended difficulty, and, supported
by the girl and the man, stumbled up the stairs with feebleness
which was not all pretence, for he was very weary from his
tramping, and weak with hunger. One of the other servant girls
followed them with a lamp to a room above stairs, where Hartwell at
once drew himself upon an ottoman, whose chintz covering he soiled
with mud and blood.</p>

<p>"Get off the gentleman's boots, Maggie," said the landlord. "May
I take off your coat now, sir?"</p>

<p>"That is all right about my things," replied Hartwell. "You may
leave me and I will do all for myself presently. Perhaps something
to eat may do me good, though I have just dined. The shaking has
caused me to feel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At once, sir: what will you have?"</p>

<p>"Anything&mdash;with some wine. Say, in half an hour's time I
will ring for it. But meanwhile I want some hot water. Bring me
this at once."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. By the way, sir&mdash;what name to give to the
police?"</p>

<p>With a renewed chill at the heart Hartwell now, for the first
time, pronounced these words:</p>

<p>"Mr James Drayton."</p>

<p>The landlord and the girl then went away and Hartwell sat on the
ottoman in his coat with his wide brow on his gloved palm, till the
girl returned with a jug of hot water and lit a fire in the room.
When she was gone again, Hartwell locked the door upon himself,
took off his outer clothes, his gloves and his boots, poured the
hot water into a basin and put the basin on a small table which he
pushed to the side of the bed.</p>

<p>He then took out all the objects which Drayton's pockets
contained, except the shreds of Letty's letter in the coat pocket,
and he placed these all together on the table by the bedside with
the basin of hot water and the lamp, in order to examine them at
his leisure. He then got into bed and lay for some minutes idle,
luxuriating in the rest and peace of the soft bed after his
weariness and thinking of what chance his strange to-morrow might
bring forth.</p>

<p>He would have fallen asleep, but that he severely roused himself
with a flash of the eye, warning himself that, however tired he
might be, there must be little sleep for him that night. He had
kept on his gloves in the presence of the landlord and the girl so
that they might not see his working man's hands, and now he put his
hands into the basin of hot water, hoping by dint of soaking and
soaping to have them at least presentable before the morning came.
After some soaking, he used Drayton's penknife to shape the nails
and cut away the callous growths round the quicks and then
continued to soak them. They had once been as soft and shapely as
Drayton's, and only needed coaxing to become so again.</p>

<p>After half an hour he rose, wiped his hands, poured out the
water from the basin, and rang for the supper before returning to
bed. The girl appeared bringing the news that the two bodies had
been taken to the mortuary and bringing also a fat Norfolk capon,
an apple tart, and a bottle of port. Hartwell then ate a hearty
meal, but without quite that sense of luxury which he had looked
for from feast at first. There is always a certain disappointment
in the actual enjoyment of the delights which one has longed for
and, moreover, Hartwell's mind had already enlarged itself to the
largeness of his new kingdom, a kingdom in which the stomach
suddenly ceased to be of importance. For men stand, as it were, at
different heights, each seeing from his own level, so what the
beggar thinks is heaven, the millionaire regards as nothing and
what the millionaire pursues, the saint or the thinker regards as a
bauble. In one and the same night Hartwell was all the
three&mdash;beggar, millionaire, and thinker. He had longed for a
meal at seven; at nine he had forgotten food, and was thinking of
palaces and social grandeur; before midnight, he had half forgotten
palaces and was thinking with joy of the laboratory which he would
make and of the research work which he would do in it.</p>

<p>When the girl, Maggie, brought the supper, he ordered her to
fetch him up some ink, a pen, and some writing paper, with more hot
water for his hands. Immediately after the meal, when he was alone
again, he set to work to examine Drayton's papers, of which there
lay quite a mass on the table near him and, leaning toward the lamp
on his elbow, he weighed the meaning of each with a certain
sideward sagacity of gaze, a sagacity that smiled in its
self-sureness.</p>

<p>Each letter brought its own light to its intelligence, adding
its share to its knowledge of Drayton's pursuits, passions,
friends, business, environment, tastes, point of view, and ways of
life. Only a few lines in one business letter, and the whole of
another letter, he tried in vain to understand. Once he stopped
short in the reading, and was lost in reflection, asking
himself:</p>

<p>"Shall I succeed in carrying it through? Have I the steel, the
wit?" And presently, as he read, he muttered, "He seems to have
been a great character for horses;" and once again with a severe
flash of the eye, he said, "He was a ruffian, this man!" and,
lastly, as he read the letter, which he could not understand, he
started with a whisper: "Oh, I have a wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>In that letter, which had been written by Drayton himself,
Hartwell saw these words: "the wife." He had taken out the letter
from an envelope which had no address on it, and yet had been
fastened down, and it seemed the letter of a crazy man, being, in
fact, none other than that nonsense-letter written by Drayton at
the "Anchor Tavern" after the death of Letty, in order to be able
to say to himself or to others that he had written a letter. For to
the greatest liars truth is dear, and men engaged in building up a
fabric of lies have been known to mix truth with it in a random
way, even at the greatest personal risk to themselves: and so with
Drayton and his nonsense-letter. And in this letter Hartwell read
the words:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"Dear Sir,&mdash;Weather very bad to-night,
blowing great guns. So it has come to this: if any one had told me
that it would, I should have bet half a million to the contrary.
The little wretch went to C.C."&mdash;meaning Corton
Chancery&mdash;"and heard the wife's screams. Weather very bad
to-night, wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. It isn't all beer and
skittles in this little world; there are things that make a man
feel rather cold. Now is the time for all good men to come to the
rescue of the party. If that little Kirk only does to Brighteye
what I have put him up to do, my Queenie will win the next Oaks as
sure as there's a sun. Now is the time for all good men to come to
the rescue of the party. Weather very bad to-night, very bad.</p>

<p class="letter">"Yours truly,</p>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">James Drayton</span>."</p>
<br>

<p>"This man was certainly a ruffian in many ways," thought
Hartwell, on reading the letter for the third time and, after
tearing off the signature, which he needed, he tore that letter in
fine shreds, rose and threw the shreds on the fire with
disgust.</p>

<p>When he returned to the bed, he lay for some time with his hands
under his head, listening to the sound of the lessening storm
outside, and thinking of "the wife." "The little wretch has gone to
C.C., and heard the wife's screams." "The" wife could only mean
Drayton's wife, and her occupation was, apparently&mdash;to scream.
So that for her also, evidently, it was not all beer and skittles
in this little world. As to the meaning of "C.C." there was nothing
in what he had so far read to show him. His mind at once took up
the notion that "C.C." was a person, nor did the thought that it
might be a place occur to him for many a day. If it had occurred to
him in time, it might have saved him a world of misery but, in
fact, Drayton's nonsense letter having been once destroyed, the
letters "C.C." passed out of Hartwell's memory for that memory,
though an extraordinary one, soon found as much to carry, as it
could bear.</p>

<p>There remained on the table three more letters which he had not
read, and the very first of these which he took up still further
complicated his relations with women, for it was from a lady to
whom Drayton had evidently been engaged at the moment of his death
and the discovery of the engagement to be married, of this already
married man, drew from Hartwell's lips the exclamation: "This
ruffian!" The lady's letter was crested with the three pearled
coronet of earldom, came from "The Villa Borgia-Costi, Cannes," was
signed "Julia," and said, among other things:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"It is raining to-day, and my Aunt Margaret and I
mope, which is nothing strange for her when the racing-season is
over, but exceptional for me. So if I am disposed to be over frank
with you, you will attribute it to external nature and the way the
wind blows...I certainly do not wish to hurt you&mdash;I wonder if
I could if I tried?&mdash;for apart from the wild relations between
us, I am convinced that I have some sort of depraved liking for
you, you are so breezy and boisterous, and careless of the usual
shams. I believe you would beat me blue if I married you, and that
is why I said 'yes,' for the same reason that one hunts in
'bullfish' country, because of the spice of madness and danger in
it. And then I was really grateful to you for saving my life that
day in Northamptonshire, for it was gallantly done at the risk of
your own neck and, lastly I suppose, I wished to prove myself
independent of the general point of view, to be a mad-cap. I
believe, on reflection, that this last was the main
<i>leit-motif</i> of my maidenly 'yes.' But I said that I would be
quite frank, since it is rainy, and I say that you are heavy, my
James, and begin to weigh upon one...</p>

<p class="letter">A woman may have a wayward admiration for the
Centaur or the Cyclops, and throw kisses at them, but one does not
marry them...I have been wondering why we should marry, really? I
recommend you to lock yourself into a room and ask yourself that
question. Are we fond of each other, then? That does not seem very
probable. I repeat and insist upon it, that I do like and enjoy
you, as one enjoys a breeze, but how, if I throw you over a week
before the wedding? then you might bring an action for breach of
promise, which would be fun, and make my brothers swear. It really
seems that I am going to do it, unless you give me some
reason...</p>

<p class="letter">Write soon, and tell me, but not with the thick
end of the pen, etc., etc."</p>

<p>Hartwell saw from the date that this letter was a week old.</p>

<p>"At any rate," he thought, with a smiling eye, a slight lifting
of the lower lids giving always to his eyes their smiling
expression; "at any rate, it will not be difficult for me to shirk
my engagement with the lively Julia and I shall not delay to
release her by letter. I am already married! Let us choose to
eschew bigamy and all breaches of the common law. This Drayton was
undoubtedly a ruffian&mdash;"</p>

<p>In reading and weighing letters and documents, hours passed over
Hartwell. It grew on towards midnight, the house was wrapped in
silence, and only the wind and rain were heard. But he would not
permit himself to sleep. His next care was to take Drayton's
signature which he had torn from the nonsense letter, and to set
himself to copy it with the writing material which Maggie had
brought him. Drayton's handwriting was very different from his own,
and he foresaw that the typewriter, for some time at least, would
have to be his closest friend. But as to the mere signature, that
would be easily enough acquired by a day or two of earnest work. He
had no lack of trust in his own handiness, capacity, and equalness
to every difficulty that might arise. For two hours and a half he
was copying the signature, over and over very slowly, like a boy
doing his copy-book, with ever repeated "James, James," "Drayton,
Drayton." Occasionally, if he paused, he soaked his hands in the
water, then wiped them and re-commenced the copying. It was far
into the foreday when he nodded over the paper, and could hardly go
on. He then rose and threw the sheets, on which he had written,
into the now dying embers of the fire.</p>

<p>He was in the act of throwing himself backward upon his pillow
to enjoy the sweetest sleep when he started, for opposite him, in
the half-darkness, he saw a face looking at him. He had blown out
the lamp, but one of the blinds was not lowered, so that some sort
of light from the outer night with its street lamps relieved the
darkness of the room and he could darkly see the face. He knew at
once that it was his own face reflected in the mirror of the chest
of drawers, but it was also the face of the man whose place in the
world he was taking, and the suspicion suggested to his nerves was
that he might think the face his own, and yet it might be
Drayton's.</p>

<p>No mind could be colder, or more trained and fixed into
scepticism, than Hartwell's. The average sceptic, looking at the
growth of so striking a being as man from the lowest forms of
fish-life, cannot help thinking that there has been something
intelligently working in the world to bring forth such a product:
but to Hartwell's hard head all was chance, chance. There was no
compromise with him: he belonged to the school of Haeckel.</p>

<p>His universe consisted of atoms and ether alone, driven by more
or less blind forces. As to ghosts and all other things, "whose
existence we have no means of verifying," these were to him the
merest "dreams of man's childhood." Yet he did lift his hands to
assure himself that the man in the glass lifted his hand also.</p>

<p>His eyes then closed in sleep, but when he was on the point of
sleep they opened again to see, for his nerves were not themselves
that night, and a man with a black beard and coarse eyebrows was in
the glass, dwelling there as in a home. The temptation occurred to
Hartwell to rise, and throw a towel over the glass, but he would
not do this. Finally his eyes flashed with a certain severe humor
characteristic of him. He suddenly closed his lids, and was soon
involved in as wild a vision as ever rioted in a man's head.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>VI. &mdash; HARTWELL HEARS FROM A
LADY OF TITLE</h2>

<p class="first">In the grey of the morning Hartwell opened his
eyes and the first thing which he saw was a towel hanging over the
mirror of the chest of drawers. He was astonished and could only
conclude that he had put it there during sleep, for it happened to
him to walk in his sleep before this, but his rising from bed to do
this proved that his nervous fancy about Drayton's face during the
night had made a deep enough impression on his nerves. He now
smiled at himself for being subject to such disorders of digestion
and dismissed the matter from his mind.</p>

<p>For two hours he then lay, full of plans and thought. During
that time he made a review of all that the world contained to
gratify him and of all these things he chose out what pleased him
best. It has been shown that revels and pomps were already below
the level to which his staid mind had risen, but among the letters
he had seen one from the captain of a yacht called the
<i>Sempronia</i>. She was his now and he would travel; and there
was a long-love science of biology; he would become a genuinely
"learned man"&mdash;that old dream of his. He could picture himself
moving about his own laboratory, adding a little to the sum of
human knowledge.</p>

<p>First, however, he would give his mind to acquiring a sufficient
working knowledge of Drayton's business in order to retire from it
without serious loss. There would have to be at least one month's
daily personal attendance at the office in Fenchurch Street, after
which he would probably be able to retire with credit in order to
lead a mild, studious, epicurean life, the life of much science, a
little art, and the pagan virtues.</p>

<p>For the pagan virtues, or any virtue, Hartwell had no more
respect theoretically, than for vice, since "a pure egotism" was
his summing up of the duty of man. But since he had inherited a
tendency to virtue from his father and forefathers, he knew that
more or less virtue was as needful to his comfort as breathing;
"the pagan virtues," therefore, and a life of calm study, was the
line along which he foresaw his maximum of happiness in that great
new world into which he was that morning born. Drayton's friends
would, of course, be greatly surprised at such a change in
Drayton's manner of life&mdash;no more Epsom, unbridled motor cars,
and rattling doings.</p>

<p>Hartwell foresaw their surprise, but he decided that he would
live his life as he thought fit: for by old habit of mind he looked
with no small disdain upon "the human animal in his present stage
of development," and was ever disposed to esteem lightly the
opinions of that animal. From time to time he might pretend in his
new world that the shock of the motor car accident had made a
difference in him and, for the rest, he trusted in the bodily
oneness between himself and Drayton to bear the strain of any
novelty of conduct that might be marked in the new Drayton.</p>

<p>As to "the wife" who "screamed," he he would provide for and
somehow rid himself of her, if he was really married; and as to
Julia, the sweetheart, he would be quickly rid of her, too. So he
lay and dreamed and planned in the early morning, not counting upon
the unexpected which, however, is always sure to happen: and within
two hours his new state of existence seemed already as old and
stale to him as if he had been a rich man and filled Drayton's
place for ten years. As for hunger and want they had become to him
unrealities as remote and forgotten as the nightmare of the
night.</p>

<p>Near eight he rose to go to Drayton's overcoat pocket where
there were still some shreds of paper which he had not examined. He
had felt them in the pocket and, on account of the trouble of
fitting them together, had not taken them out on taking the mass of
other papers. He now took them in one heap, unlocked his door,
removed the towel from the mirror, returned to bed, and began to
fit the shreds of paper together.</p>

<p>But he was almost at once interrupted in this by a rap and
bundled the shreds with the other papers as the opened door, let in
a flood of day light, and the girl, Maggie, came in asking how he
was.</p>

<p>"Much better, thank you," said Hartwell.</p>

<p>"Hodder, the sergeant, is downstairs asking to speak with you,
sir," she said.</p>

<p>"Send him up and bring me a breakfast of hard-boiled eggs and
coffee," said Hartwell. "Then see what can be made of my clothes by
dint of cleaning. The overcoat, I think, is beyond your cares, and
I must get a new one in the town; or perhaps I shall take from the
police that of my friend, Mr&mdash;McCalmont."</p>

<p>He had seen from the letters that McCalmont was the name of
Drayton's right-hand man, and also that McCalmont had accompanied
his chief on the motor car expedition to Sheffield. He therefore
made the true guess that this was the name of the second dead
man.</p>

<p>The girl took up his clothes and went out. Then came in the
officer, hat in hand, saying, "sorry sir, I'm sure, for your
terrible accident."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said Hartwell, "I have had a memorable shaking,
sergeant and an escape only to be attributed to the interpositions
of a merciful Providence."</p>

<p>"Bad bruise on the forehead sir, I see," said the officer in a
sympathetic voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, I was pitched head foremost over the cart&mdash;happily
into a mass of mud. Sit down on that side of the bed while I have
some breakfast and I will tell you all."</p>

<p>Hodder, the sergeant, sat and they spoke of the accident, of the
condition of the two bodies and what had been done with the
half-burned car, with the cart and with the guilty carter. As for
the inquest, the coroner had issued his warrants and it would be at
two p.m.</p>

<p>"It was a night o' trouble, last night," remarked the officer,
as he rose to go, "what with the storm and there's Mr Barnes, of
the "Anchor Inn," can't find his daughter, Letty. Its odd too, sir,
how that laboring man got himself between your motor car and the
cart. There's precious little left of his head, I see."</p>

<p>Hartwell's eyes, characterised by a certain humorous vivacity in
their sideward look, smiled upon him as he said:</p>

<p>"The poor tramp perished in trying to save us. We heard him
howling out to us but had no idea what he meant. The lamps may have
dazzled and made him think us farther from him than we were and so
he got himself between the car and the cart."</p>

<p>"You must have been going a pace, sir!"</p>

<p>"No doubt. If you like to fine me, I suppose I must
pay&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that'll be all right sir, bless you," said Hodder, the
sergeant.</p>

<p>He then went away, but before Hartwell could finish his
breakfast, in came the girl again, this time with a breezy
telegram, which said:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">"CONGRATULATION! HURRAH!&mdash;BENTLEY."</p>

<p>And while he ate, three more arrived. This meant that the
accident of the night had got into the London morning papers; and
by 10.30 there was quite a crowd of telegrams.</p>

<p>One of them said:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">"MY HEARTY CONGRATULATION; I AM COMING DOWN TO
YOU.&mdash;OSWALD."</p>

<p>Another said:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">"THE OFFICE BEG TO UNITE IN EXPRESSION OF
SYMPATHY AND CONGRATULATIONS.&mdash;FOTHERGILL."</p>

<p>A third said:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">"YOUR USUAL LUCK; THREE CHEERS FOR THE OLD
FIRM!&mdash;EDWARDS."</p>

<p>Hartwell lay back smoking a cigar: but he was to find no rest
now from the rain of congratulatory telegrams. There was only one
which was the reverse of congratulatory, for it said:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">"YOU HAVE ESCAPED THIS TIME, BUT NOT FOR
LONG,"</p>

<p class="first">and this one was anonymous. Near one o'clock there
came one from "the sweetheart" at Cannes, saying:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">"THE NEWS HAS BEEN TELEGRAPHED ME BY YOUR
BROTHER: ACCEPT MY CONGRATULATIONS.&mdash;JULIA."</p>

<p>He had just read this when Maggie, whose legs were growing weary
of mounting and going down the stairs, re-appeared, saying:</p>

<p>"Mr Oswald Drayton to see you, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah," thought Hartwell, "this is that Oswald who was 'coming
down to me,' and he is a 'Drayton,' the 'brother' probably whom
'Julia' speaks of. Now, then, begins the test," and his eyes
hardened keenly under their coarse brows. "Show him up," he
said.</p>

<p>Presently there entered before Hartwell, in his room at the inn,
a man rather under middle size, with a polished bald head (though
he was only 35) and a friz of reddish hair running behind from ear
to ear. He had a well-curled moustache, a hard chin, square jaws, a
square head and a limp in his walk. His dress was the perfection of
correctness, with some studied harmony between the tie, the gloves,
the morning coat and, in all his air, a suggestion of club-land and
Pall Mall.</p>

<p>"This does not look like my brother," thought Hartwell, quickly.
But he was bold, he spoke first, though with a quailing sense of
rashness, saying quietly: "My good Oswald, you are kind to
come&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the words were so unlike Drayton's, who had usually
addressed brother Oswald with a rough off-handiness, tossing him
anon a careless hundred-pound-note, that Oswald stopped short one
moment and his eyebrows slightly lifted. He shook hands,
saying:</p>

<p>"My dear James, I am delighted at your escape, but&mdash;my dear
fellow&mdash;you certainly look bad."</p>

<p>"In what way?" asked Hartwell quickly.</p>

<p>"Done up somehow, thinner&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Haven't I&mdash;cause?"</p>

<p>"Of course you have. I have myself lost a pound at least in
weight since hearing of the accident. By a mere chance my man,
Magee, saw it in the 'Times' about eight this morning, and I at
once telegraphed to Lady Methwold. Er&mdash;heard from her, by the
way?"</p>

<p>Hartwell at the first instant did not know who Lady Methwold was
and, though in the second instant he guessed, his momentary
conclusion caused him to say, more to himself than to Oswald, "Lady
Methwold&mdash;you mean Julia."</p>

<p>Oswald slowly seated himself, and slowly turned his large gaze
upon Hartwell, for all Oswald's movements were slow and
premeditated. He was stiffer even than his collar. Anon he slowly
turned his gaze at his image in the glass with sublime eyebrows.
There was about him some detachment or absence of mind, as of one
musing inwardly on himself and not finding surrounding objects of
sufficient interest to occupy his attention.</p>

<p>"My good fellow," said he, "you are queer. Why on earth am I to
call Lady Methwold 'Julia' before your marriage with her, if that
ever arrives? Has she telegraphed to you?" He asked it with an
interest which did not escape Hartwell's notice.</p>

<p>"Yes. Why?" asked Hartwell.</p>

<p>"Curiosity. Don't be odd. One has always a natural interest in
people whose actions are always unexpected. Tell me about the
spill"&mdash;with half a yawn.</p>

<p>Hartwell, looking at him penetratingly, said:</p>

<p>"Why tell you? You are not really anxious about the spill."</p>

<p>Oswald again turned his large eyes upon the bed, subconscious,
no doubt, of a change in Drayton's noisy, slangy choice of words,
and he said with surprise:</p>

<p>"My good James! do you mean because I merely yawned? It is that
infernal journey&mdash;You are queer to-day. I see you have got a
knock on the head. If I was not anxious, why come? No other brother
would."</p>

<p>"He is poor," thought Hartwell, "and a sponger: his motive is
money."</p>

<p>But before he could sound Oswald further, the breathless Maggie
again looked in, saying, "Mr Barnes to see you, sir."</p>

<p>"Show him up," said Hartwell, without having any idea who Mr
Barnes was, and in a minute in came the red beard and constant
frown of Barnes, the father of the murdered Letty.</p>

<p>"You will excuse me, sir," began Barnes, "I am in a bit of
trouble&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, just take that chair, Mr Barnes," said Hartwell.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. Sorry to hear of your accident, sir, and I
congratulate you on your lucky escape. I am very much put about
this morning, sir, or should not have troubled you. Fact
is&mdash;God help us all!&mdash;my daughter, Letty, left the house
during the night and can't be found."</p>

<p>At the mention of that name, "Letty," Oswald Drayton slowly
turned himself to look at Barnes, and listened closer.</p>

<p>"I thought she might have come to her cousin's in Aylsham,"
continued Barnes; "at least, it was just possible, but she hasn't.
There's no telling where's she got to, or when she left the house,
or why, or&mdash;anything. Forgive a father's feelings,
gentlemen&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man buried his face, and a sob was heard in the room.
Oswald's gaze turned upon Hartwell's face.</p>

<p>"I am sorry for your trouble, Barnes," said Hartwell. "I only
hope that&mdash;" he was about to say, "am in no way
connected&mdash;" but checked himself.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking that it is just possible that you may have
seen the lass last night, sir," said Barnes, looking up.</p>

<p>"I may have, tell me more."</p>

<p>"You recollect coming to <i>The Anchor</i> in your motor car,
sir? It must have been about twenty past seven?"</p>

<p>"That is true, I had almost forgotten. My head is all in a
topsy-turvey this morning, Barnes. You see where I got the
blow&mdash;" Hartwell passed his palm across the breadth of his
brow, and Oswald's gaze travelled slowly from one to the other.</p>

<p>"Forgive me for troubling you sir, with my troubles, when you
have your own," said Barnes. "I had the notion that if you had seen
the lass when you went upstairs to write your letter, then we'd be
able to say that at that hour, anyway, she was in the house. But if
you don't recollect seeing her, I can only wish you a good day, and
a speedy recovery&mdash;ah, good God!"</p>

<p>Barnes sighed, and stamped his stick and his foot together as he
rose, the picture of loss and care.</p>

<p>"You are certain to find her, Barnes!" Hartwell called
comfortingly after him, "have you made a thorough search?"</p>

<p>"The house, the whole neighborhood, five of us, since midnight,
sir. She's gone, God knows where to."</p>

<p>The old man went out, and as he disappeared, Oswald's eyebrows
deliberately lifted and, turning upon Hartwell, he said:</p>

<p>"I am prepared to take an oath that you have run off with that
girl, James."</p>

<p>The fact was that, five days before this, Oswald had received a
letter from a woman unknown to him named Letty Barnes, asking if he
would tell her the proposed date of his brother's marriage with
Lady Methwold; he had received it with a number of others brought
him by his man Magee, at his club, and had then somehow dropped or
mislaid it, for when he looked for it afterwards he could not find
it anywhere. But he happened to remember the name Letty, because
Letty seemed to be someone who, like himself, had a dislike to his
brother.</p>

<p>"What makes you think that I have run off with her?" asked
Hartwell.</p>

<p>Oswald would say nothing about Letty's letter to him, but said
only:</p>

<p>"Why else should you stop at that inn when you were coming to
dine at Aylsham? You have run off with her&mdash;dreadful
scoundrel."</p>

<p>This was meant as flattery for Oswald, having come down to beg
for money, wished to please. The real Drayton would have
undoubtedly chuckled at being thus prodded about his conquests, but
Hartwell who was born with the soul of a professor in the body of a
Viking, took it without the least humor, foreseeing already that
Drayton's way of life would probably involve him in some
distasteful episodes. He looked at Oswald with a smiling eye,
saying:</p>

<p>"I see that your methods of deduction are not conclusive,
Oswald. Because I stopped on my way to dine at Aylsham at the
'Anchor Inn,' therefore, you say, I have run off with the girl
there. But the landlord has already given you my real reason for
stopping&mdash;namely, to write a letter."</p>

<p>"You would have waited till you came to Aylsham to write it, if
you hadn't had some other motive," said Oswald, "and what on earth
are you doing in this part of the country at all? My man, Magee,
told me that you had gone to Sheffield for something, or
other."</p>

<p>"So I had. But I returned this way to do some business at
Cromer."</p>

<p>"Do people do business at Cromer?" asked Oswald wearily, looking
at his image in the wardrobe glass with the critical detachment of
a drill sergeant. "I thought Cromer was all bathing machines and
shrimps. It is of no importance, my dear James. I don't know why
you take it gravely, a girl less or more can't matter to you. But I
thought that you were going to reform when you became engaged to
her ladyship of Garlot. Magee, who never can get over his surprise
that she ever took you, thinks that if she had any conception of
your rowdyism, she would send you to the devil."</p>

<p>(Magee was Oswald's Irish servant, and Oswald seldom opened his
mouth, without somehow bringing in Magee.)</p>

<p>"Magee is right," said Hartwell, "I am, in fact, already
practically thrown over. So, if it will comfort you to know that I
shall not finally outrun you in the good graces of that lady, then
be comforted. We shall not marry."</p>

<p>Hartwell's thick lips smiled clinically as he said this, with
that definite point in the middle of the upper pressed into the
lower, not thinking how sad a prophecy he uttered. Oswald stared
incredulously at him, as he uttered it, though even the mere
prophecy pleased Oswald for one of the dreads of his life was that
his brother should marry anyone, since that would mean the loss of
two entails which would fall to him if his brother died without an
heir.</p>

<p>Oswald had no suspicion that his brother had married nine years
before this, in South Africa, a certain Martha Harper, and he had
taken to his bed for a week, sick with disgust, when the
extraordinary news of Drayton's engagement with Lady Julia became
public, for he himself had long worshipped Julia as a "bright
particular star" afar off, and had vaguely hoped to wed it. That
the "James" whom he despised should have rushed in and conquered
where Oswald feared to tread was a marvel to which Oswald's slow
mind could never accustom itself. He had a constitutional and
chronic dislike for the breezy Drayton, who threw him doles and
checks with a careless hand, as one throws bones to a dog, and with
this dislike was mixed a fine-gentleman disdain for the
rough-and-ready city-man which Oswald could often hardly keep from
peeping through his pretended chumship with James, to whom he was
obliged to cringe, since his elegant existence among the tip-top
circles was almost dependent on James' doles.</p>

<p>The brothers had not grown up together. They moved for the most
part in different sets. Till James' surprising engagement with the
wayward and independent Julia, James and Oswald could hardly have
been called social equals, Oswald being so distinguished, though
poor, and James so democratic a fellow, though a millionaire. Their
parents had been pretty high in the social scale, but at an early
age James had quarrelled with his father, had run away from school,
resolving to stand on his own footing and make his own way, and in
South Africa, where he lived a good many years, had laid the
foundations of his large fortune.</p>

<p>It was not surprising, therefore, that little love was lost
between the brothers, since they had seen little of each other, nor
did Oswald's dislike&mdash;as yet&mdash;amount to actual hatred of
"James." Yet that morning when he had been shown by Magee the
account in the newspaper of the good James' escape from the spill,
the thought in Oswald's mind, though he did not express it, was
this: "My vicious luck."</p>

<p>He and Hartwell conversed for half an hour in a desultory way,
Hartwell pumping him on the details of Oswald's own and the dead
Drayton's mode of existence, their friends, habits, and so on, till
at one-thirty Hartwell started, saying:</p>

<p>"I must get up and dress for that inquest."</p>

<p>Then Oswald, too, rose, and paced a little, anon inspecting the
image in the glass, saying:</p>

<p>"So McCalmont is gone? Well, one cannot pretend to be sorry. I
hated McCalmont."</p>

<p>"Why so?" asked Hartwell, glad of any scrap of information.</p>

<p>"You know very well that he used to put you against me, James. I
say, Jimmy"&mdash;Oswald's voice lowered rather meanly&mdash;"I
lost £80 on that dreadful Riley-match, and there's an infernal bill
from Prince's this week. Don't think I'm exigent, but I might have
scraped something together to-day from somewhere, if I had not
rushed down to see you. May I count upon a hundred before I start
back to town."</p>

<p>"I will think about it," said Hartwell, not intending to give.
"You might go down while I dress and ask the girl whether the
sergeant has sent me McCalmont's overcoat, as I told him to. My own
is all stained."</p>

<p>"Is it that splendid sable of yours that is all stained? I say,
may I have it, Jimmy? I might use the fur."</p>

<p>"If you like!" said Hartwell off-handedly.</p>

<p>Oswald went out, while Hartwell dressed in Drayton's clothes,
which the girl had well cleaned and brought up, some time before.
He then descended to the commercial room, where lunch was waiting
for him, and he and Oswald sat to lunch.</p>

<p>Oswald was all the time conscious in a dull way of some change,
some heightening of mind and character in the good James before
him, but without making any attempt to account for it. All
problems, in fact, were regarded by Oswald as an ox regards a
five-barred gate, seeing it certainly there, but unable to
understand who made it, or how, or why, and not caring, but chewing
its cud, and feeling bored. During the lunch, however, Oswald could
not but be surprised at the little that "James" drank, and he
asked:</p>

<p>"Why are you drinking less heroically, my good James? That spill
has had a chastening effect upon you. You are less florid and
boisterous, somehow. You look like a converted burglar, which is
horrid. I believe her fair ladyship of Garlot would almost prefer
the unconverted type. Better not change, James, from just what you
were at the moment of her consent, or she will certainly fly off at
a tangent, and leave you. Is that really true then, that she shows
sighs of restiveness?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hartwell.</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>"I have a letter saying that she has re-considered the matter,
and is disposed to cast me into despair."</p>

<p>"Despair!" repeated Oswald to himself, with a mocking breath of
laughter. Just that little turn of expression was so unexpected for
his slangy brother to use. "But do you think that she meant it,
Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt about it&mdash;Ah that makes you glad, Oswald!
Your sympathies with the pangs of your brother are not so profound
as they should be, my friend."</p>

<p>Oswald glanced at him in surprise, and then said with abashed
lids in a lower voice:</p>

<p>"My dear James, you are queer to-day."</p>

<p>Already the power of Hartwell's personality was producing upon
him an effect of greater respect.</p>

<p>"You remarked that before," said Hartwell, "that I am queer
to-day. But in what sense queer? Because I probe in you your
unbrotherly mood? You are to get it well into your mind Oswald,
that I am not queer to-day, even if I was queer before."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said Oswald, "I don't care a curse whether you
are queer or not. I don't know what it is all about. If I am glad
at all that Lady Methwold won't have you, it is partly for your
sake. You know very well that you have no earthly right to such a
wife."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because, because. You know very well. In two weeks she would
play the very deuce with you, or you with her, or both. She is the
very finest flower of nineteenth-century Society, and you belong to
the Roman Empire under Galba."</p>

<p>"Not altogether to the Roman Empire, Oswald," said Hartwell with
a twinkling eye. "No! I have heard a mention of the geologic ages,
my friend, at least a mention, though you may not think so well of
me. And why, after all, am I not a suitable catch for a lady of
title? I am rich&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not a suitable match for her, James. There are plenty of others
who will be glad of you, if you are sufficiently absurd to desire
rank in a wife. What, then have you done about her letter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing yet. I mean to answer it shortly. And I shall accept
her inclination to withdraw from the engagement as being as serious
as I consider it wise."</p>

<p>"You won't really, James?"</p>

<p>"Yes, never fear, you shall be well pleased!"</p>

<p>"Magee tells me that she is coming back from Cannes before
Christmas, first to Garlot Croft, and then for hunting in
Gloucestershire."</p>

<p>"I may see her then, or write before&mdash;Ah, it must be time
for the inquest," Hartwell rose as he said this, and took out the
dead man's watch to look at it, and now occurred a painful incident
to him, for he could not open the watch, which was double cased,
and only opened on the touching of a tiny spring which he did not
know where to find. He fumbled with the winding knob, but the watch
would not open, and catching sight of Oswald looking at him, he
grew rather confused, feeling that he should surely know the secret
of opening his own watch. It was rather a bitter moment. The watch
would not open, and Hartwell's colour slightly changed when Oswald
asked:</p>

<p>"Why ever can't you open it?"</p>

<p>This question, innocent as it was, was never forgotten by
Hartwell who, in his sensitive outlook for the first sign of a
suspicion that he was not Drayton, was apt to flee when no man
pursued. From that moment, he definitely disliked, as well as
despised, Oswald, in whom however, not even the beginning of a
suspicion of anything wrong had arisen. For men know each other,
not by vague impressions of character or manner, but almost
entirely by the broad evidence of the senses, so that if one knows
one's brother, or ones husband, to be a saint, yet if someone
exactly like him came home tipsy one day, the last thing which one
would think is that it was not really he. One might say, "I cannot
believe my eyes," but one would nevertheless believe them, in spite
of a whole life's excellence of character, for our trust in our
senses is perfect&mdash;far more perfect than they deserve.</p>

<p>If even the faintest suspicion should happen to arise in one's
mind that the tipsy man might not really be one's brother or
husband, then the march from that to certainty would in most cases
be swift, but the birth of such a suspicion would be more hard and
stubborn than the changing of coal into diamond, if the bodily
resemblance was very strong. In the case of Hartwell and Drayton,
not only was the manner, speech and tone of mind as different as
possible in the two men, but even the bodily resemblance was not
perfect. For Hartwell's beard was worn quite an inch shorter than
Drayton's and the raspberry birth-mark on his temple was rather
smaller, and of a different shape to that of Drayton. Yet that
"first suspicion" which was necessary to open the eyes to see all
this did not occur to Oswald nor, for a long time, to anyone.</p>

<p>Such an incident as that of the watch, and a hundred others like
it which did not fail to occur to Hartwell during the first two
weeks of the imposture, might have opened any eyes but those fast
closed by the undoubting certainty that he was Drayton, since he
was like Drayton, and stood in Drayton's shoes. He was quite a
minute fumbling with Drayton's watch, yet could not open it. His
first impulse was to say that the shock of the spill had made him
forget everything, finally, however, he rose better than that to
the emergency, his perfect calm returning as he quietly said:</p>

<p>"I see the cover got strained in my fall. Never mind, it must be
time to go."</p>

<p>They then set out for the court, Hartwell in a hat of the
landlord's and in McCalmont's overcoat which Hodder, the sergeant,
had sent him. He walked down the street, still keeping up the
pretence of feebleness, leaning on Oswald's arm, with his palm on
the bruise on his brow. The wealth and importance of Drayton had
been learned by Aylsham from the morning papers, so Hartwell was
received by the coroner and his twelve men like a sovereign who had
been the victim of someone's wrong-doing, was condoled with, was
not permitted to stand in giving his evidence, and finally went out
with everyone bowing to him. As to the furious driving not a word
was said.</p>

<p>The jury did not give their verdict that day, and on this
account, as well as to meet Mrs McCalmont and her father who had
telegraphed him their coming down, Hartwell had to remain at
Aylsham that night. Oswald, meanwhile, was clearly beginning to
fidget&mdash;hating to stay&mdash;for outside of Mayfair he was
like a fish out of water, yet afraid to speak of hurrying off, lest
he should go without the £100, for 'James' was touchy and a
creature of whims. But as they re-entered the old coaching house,
he ventured to say at last:</p>

<p>"I think I must go, Jimmy; I could hardly stand a night in this
hole."</p>

<p>"Then go, my friend," answered Hartwell, who had now
sufficiently used Oswald to pump from him all the knowledge he
could furnish, and wished to be alone to study McCalmont's papers,
which he had just obtained at the court.</p>

<p>"Then may I have the cheque, Jimmy, before I go?" asked Oswald
in a certain sycophant voice.</p>

<p>"I think not," answered Hartwell. He had Drayton's cheque-book,
but did not yet consider himself sufficiently expert in signing
Drayton's name to do so, even if he had wished to be obliging. But
Hartwell was no scatterer of £100 cheques, and did not wish to be
obliging and, at that moment, the enmity already begun between him
and Oswald deepened.</p>

<p>"But I thought you promised?" said Oswald.</p>

<p>"I said that I would think about it."</p>

<p>"Don't be a miser, Jimmy! Didn't I rush down at once to see
you?"</p>

<p>"No doubt, but I have been over-liberal of late. You know
that."</p>

<p>"The clown!" muttered Oswald to himself, "but what has happened
to the brute? His choice of words seems different&mdash;Won't you
then, Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>That "No" was very final. Hartwell went up to his room, and
Oswald lingered in the commercial room for two hours, pacing there
with his slow limp, as the afternoon shadows lengthened, nosing the
old window panes, his mind bitter with the miseries of scarcity,
and with the thought which haunted it that, if the car had only
pitched James when it had pitched McCalmont, then he, Oswald, would
have changed his rooms in a week's time to the Albany and would
have wintered in Algiers.</p>

<p>As for Hartwell, wearied with the anxieties of the day and
night, he had gone again to bed. He already knew Oswald through and
through and acted with respect to him without hesitation. For
already a certain heightening of wit and insight, which his
ticklish situation called forth, was begun in him&mdash;a certain
"adaptation to his environment," almost like the growth of a new
sense which, in a few weeks, would find him sharpened at the call
of a thousand exigencies into a very genius of swift discernment
and decision.</p>

<p>When Oswald went up to say good-bye, he found Hartwell asleep.
He did not wake him but, coming down again to go, got the "splendid
sable" overcoat which Hartwell had made him a present of, from the
maid, who had cleaned it as well as she could. He was about to
leave the tavern, when, feeling in the pockets of the overcoat, in
the vague hope of finding a forgotten five pound note, he found
instead a shred of paper. A shred of Letty Barnes' letter to Lady
Methwold, which Hartwell had chanced to leave behind in the pocket
in taking out the rest in a heap.</p>

<p>The hand-writing interested Oswald, he seemed to know it. Letty
Barnes had written to him in that hand, asking the date of his
brother's marriage.</p>

<p>"James" had said that morning that he did not know Letty, yet
here was a shred of her writing in James' pocket and on it Oswald
read the word and the half-word: "cruel bru."</p>

<p>That seemed very odd to Oswald that James should have denied
knowing her, for James usually took such things more lightly. What,
then, had he done with this Letty?</p>

<p>Oswald called Maggie again, and asked her:</p>

<p>"Has anything more been heard of Mr Barnes' daughter?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so, sir," she answered. "There's a great
excitement about it in the town. Everybody was that fond of
Letty."</p>

<p>"Where is the 'Anchor Inn?'"</p>

<p>"About two miles from here, between Ingworth and Coleby,
sir."</p>

<p>"I want you to get me a horse and trap."</p>

<p>Oswald waited till this was procured him, and instead of walking
to the station, drove to "The Anchor," and actually slept there
that night.</p>

<p>Hartwell, on his part, spent the night much as he had spent the
last, studiously examining McCalmont's papers, making his plans for
the future and forming his handwriting on the model of Drayton's.
About nine in the evening there occurred to him an event in the
shape of a letter from Lady Julia. It had been written two days
after the one of hers which he had found in Drayton's pocket,
threatening him with dismissal, and four days before Julia had
heard of his accident. The letter had gone from Cannes to Drayton's
house in Addison Road, and was now sent down to Aylsham with some
others by a Miss Scatchett, who was Drayton's town housekeeper.</p>

<p>In this letter Lady Methwold did what in the previous letter she
had only threatened to do, for with a light and almost flippant
touch, but still firmly enough, she threw Drayton over, giving no
reason that any British jury would take seriously. Though it was
evident "between the lines" that she had thought seriously of the
matter, for she accounted in one place for her change of whim by
the fact that she was "six months older." Hartwell had already so
identified himself with Drayton, that, if he had been dissected,
some slight pique or feeling of offence would have been found
within him at this light treatment. He read the letter with a cold
and smiling eye, and murmured when he was finished:</p>

<p>"Your ladyship will be spared the action, and since I no longer
possess your ladyship's affections, I shall now set about and
dispose myself to exist without them."</p>

<p>He was almost merry that night&mdash;as near it as his earnest
nature ever got&mdash;full of a sense of success, safety, and
old-established ease. But as he was dropping off to sleep, about
two in the morning, the same thing as on the previous night
troubled his repose, for he caught sight of a face in the mirror
which was his, and yet might possibly be Drayton's. The face
meditated upon him, and since Hartwell looked at it through
half-closed lids, the face seemed a dead man's face. This disturbed
Hartwell, as such things do to one who is about to sleep and though
he had smiled at himself that morning, his unrest was even greater
this second night. It was a morbidness, the beginning of a
madness&mdash;which might grow. Fearing lest he should again cover
the mirror in his sleep, he rose and threw the towel over it. Till
he did that he could not sleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>VII. &mdash; HARTWELL COMES
HOME</h2>

<p class="first">The next evening, near eight, James Drayton's
brougham awaited its master at Liverpool Street Station, for
Hartwell, after making arrangements for the burial of the "tramp,"
and the bringing of McCalmont's body to London, had telegraphed his
coming to Miss Scatchett, his housekeeper, and she had sent a
brougham to meet him.</p>

<p>It was a dark, rainy night, and the scene about the station was
a blur of umbrellas, wheels, mist, lights, mud, and hurrying
feet.</p>

<p>Standing in it all, apparently awaiting someone, was a tall
young man, with a wide hat tilted aside on his head, blonde hair,
and the most alert eyes&mdash;evidently a Frenchman&mdash;with a
certain dancing levity in all his air. His clothes were of a
fashionable cut, but shabby, he had no overcoat, no umbrella and
his jacket collar was turned up. But though cold and poor, he did
not seem depressed, being a young man used to the ups and downs of
life, certain to be rich to-morrow, if he was poor to-day, and
quite certain to be poor again the day after to-morrow. His name
was Emile Dulaunay, Count d'Artenset-Villiers, for though penniless
for the moment, he was the representative of one of the oldest
seigneurial families.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon dieu!</i>" thought the count, "I wish that she would
come."</p>

<p>But he was getting wet, his expected friend did not appear and
finally, seeing a brougham standing just near him among a number of
carriages, and seeing also that its door had by chance fallen open
he, in his nimble way, slipped in out of the rain, with a grimace
of self-conscious monkeyism, and there in the brougham, he sat,
leaning out of the door with a bright outlook both for his expected
friend and for the owner of the brougham, ready to slip out at the
first sing of the latter's appearing.</p>

<p>He had not been three minutes in the brougham, when quite near
him a big man in a furred coat seemed to rise out of the ground,
calling out: "Drayton's carriage!" This was Hartwell, just arrived
from Aylsham. Hartwell, of course, did not know his own carriage
and coachman, and his hesitating indirect approach in the crowd had
given the Frenchman no hint that he was the owner of the carriage.
At the call of "Drayton's carriage!" the coachman sang out in
reply: "Here, sir!" and before the Frenchman could stir, Hartwell
was at the carriage door.</p>

<p>The excellent count was about to laugh an excuse and take to
flight when, to his extreme mystification, Hartwell said, "How do
you do?" put out his hand, and shook the count's. For Hartwell
naturally assumed that here must be some household friend or
dependant of Drayton's who had come in the carriage to meet
him.</p>

<p>Hartwell got hurriedly into the carriage, saying to
Dulaunay:</p>

<p>"Tell him to drive us home fast, I am hungry."</p>

<p>And Dulaunay at once said to himself "Here then, evidently, is a
dinner arranged beforehand for me by the good God himself."</p>

<p>A born adventurer and hanger-on on Providence, living by
instants like a bird, Dulaunay followed always giddily whither
chance led, little recking whither that might be, and leaning out
of the door he called to the astonished driver, who had not seen
him get in: "It is necessary that you hasten yourself!" whereupon
the carriage moved, and off they went westward.</p>

<p>There was a silence for a time in the dim brougham, each of its
two occupants waiting in vain for the other to speak. Dulaunay
would not say a word, and finally Hartwell asked:</p>

<p>"Is everything going well at home?"</p>

<p>"But, sir, I hope it," answered Dulaunay.</p>

<p>Hartwell considered that answer in silence.</p>

<p>"Tell me about things," he said, presently.</p>

<p>"What things, sir?"</p>

<p>"Everything."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;but&mdash;'everything' is a sufficiently ample
subject, you will admit, sir! It is, in effect, an abstract science
that, sir, demands&mdash;." The count said this with reproach.</p>

<p>"Ha! yes, that is so. I see that you are as full of your jokes
as usual."</p>

<p>"But yes, as usual, sir. It is better to take the life lightly,
is it not, sir?"</p>

<p>"You are a philosopher as well as a humorist," said Hartwell,
"and a philosopher of my own school. I am in agreement with
you."</p>

<p>He did not know what to make of the Frenchman by his side, who
was evidently a man of culture and no chef, nor was it within the
bounds of Dulaunay's fancy to conceive why this excellent sir was
taking him in his carriage to dinner. They were now passing down
Holborn. Hartwell longed and was sorely tempted, to ask the name
and relation to himself of the man who was so near to him, yet was
so strange, dark, and spectral to his consciousness. But, as he was
supposed to know, to ask was precisely the thing which he was
resolved in no case to do. Dulaunay for his part could only dream
that he was the subject of some mistake which might bring him a
dinner and other good chances, and refrained from uttering rashness
with his lips, so that the two men, wholly unrelated till that
hour, but now linked fast together by a chain of circumstances,
remained perfect riddles one to the other.</p>

<p>"As to my housekeeper?" said, Hartwell, brusquely, after a long
time.</p>

<p>"What, as to her?" asked the excellent count.</p>

<p>"Is she well?"</p>

<p>"I venture to cherish the hope that she is well, sir," said
Dulaunay, in a tone of some surprise.</p>

<p>"You have not seen her lately, then?"</p>

<p>"Not perhaps lately, sir."</p>

<p>"Where, then, have you been?"</p>

<p>"I? Why at home."</p>

<p>"I see, at home, but not come in contact with her, so to
say?"</p>

<p>"Not into personal contact, perhaps, sir."</p>

<p>"You say 'perhaps' always," said Hartwell, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Dulaunay.</p>

<p>There was silence between them again, till Hartwell said:</p>

<p>"I am late, by the way. I hope our dinner will not spoil."</p>

<p>"The heaven defend that, sir," answered the count, in a quiet
and confident tone of protest.</p>

<p>Hartwell, meantime, was thinking: "Strange that he asks me not a
word about the accident;" and presently he said:</p>

<p>"What did you think of my accident?"</p>

<p>"Your accident? <i>Mon Dieu!</i> but the news of your accident
sensibly touches me, sir," cried the count.</p>

<p>"I cannot, however, flatter myself that you exhibit the keenest
interest in the details."</p>

<p>"I! but even the keenest!" cried the count, "permit me
instantly, sir, to ask of you a full history of that vexing
circumstance!"</p>

<p>Hartwell, with that humorous shrewd look of his narrow eye,
answered:</p>

<p>"I will not burden you on the eve of your dinner. A motor car
may be heavy for digestion."</p>

<p>Whereupon Dulaunay at once spun round toward Hartwell in an
ardour of narrative, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"A motor car! but I have not yet told you, I think, of that what
you call it?&mdash;'upset' that arrived to me in the Upper
Auvergne? You are going to hear&mdash;"</p>

<p>And the glib count plunged into a story of hair-breadth escape,
full of cries and gesticulation, which lasted till they were
sweeping through the gates of Addison Road to the house.</p>

<p>Arrived at James Drayton's home in Addison's Road, the two
occupants of the carriage got out. The coachman, who had seen only
one man get in, saw two get out, but almost before he could ask
himself anew how that was, his attention was all drawn off from
this question by the strange conduct of a mastiff&mdash;a large,
buff watch-dog, named "Bull"&mdash;which had bounded from the outer
hall as the carriage entered the drive. Bull had been a great
friend of Drayton's, and the moment Hartwell appeared at the
carriage door the hound ran to fondle him and be fondled by him.
But half-way to the carriage the dog stopped short, uttered a yelp,
then a growl, and now was apparently about to spring with a
bristling neck and no good meaning upon the new-comer. But again he
stopped short, whined and shrunk backwards, with vague eyes of awe,
his back bristling with superstitious horror. And suddenly the dog
was in flight, whimpering, his tail between his legs, round the
house to the back.</p>

<p>The coachman, seeing all this, muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"Well, I never!"</p>

<p>And Hartwell thought:</p>

<p>"Our dog will have to be reasoned with severely!"</p>

<p>Miss Scatchett, the housekeeper, had thought fit, in view of so
great an event as the accident, to have her staff assembled in the
inner-hall, where Hartwell shook hands all round, receiving their
congratulations with an affable dignity while the Frenchman stuck
to his elbow with many bows and an opening of the arms.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr Drayton, you have had a miraculous escape, heaven be
praised!" said Miss Scatchett, a very meagre old gentlewoman, with
a bird-like and active air, who wore old brown silks and black silk
mits on her hands. Hartwell already knew her name and decided at
his first glance at her that she was a spinster.</p>

<p>"Such is life, Miss Scatchett," he said; "I am safe, you see, I
am here, in spite of all. Let all be attributed to that merciful
Providence which occupies itself in watching over our mute
existences. I received your letter of sympathy, and thank you. I
thank you all&mdash;I wish this overcoat taken to my room. It is my
poor McCalmont's"&mdash;and he threw off the overcoat to the arm of
a footman, his object being to discover the whereabouts of his own
room, and when the footman moved Hartwell followed, and when
Hartwell moved Dulaunay followed.</p>

<p>"Ah, I fear you have had a truly terrible shock sir," said Miss
Scatchett, who also went up with them for, missing the breezy
entrance of her old Drayton and finding instead a self-respecting
and genial dignity, she could only put this down to the shock of
the accident.</p>

<p>"Yes, a terrible shock enough," answered Hartwell, "it may be
months before I am myself again. I believe that you will henceforth
miss in me a certain, let me say, boisterousness, Miss Scatchett. I
feel myself somewhat changed. The memory in particular seems rather
clouded. I struck just here, where you see the bruise."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear me!"</p>

<p>"Well, never mind, I say! Let us take all things cheerily and
bravely as they come, Miss Scatchett. Our earth is not a paradise,
but the Chance which governs it is not uniformly bitter. Ah, here
we are."</p>

<p>The footman with the coat now entered a room on the first floor,
into which Hartwell followed him, and seeing Dulaunay about to
follow also said rather testily, "You may, perhaps, prefer to go to
your own room, sir, before dinner."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," answered the count, and turned with enquiring
brows towards Miss Scatchett, who was wondering that he had not
been presented to her while Hartwell, on his side, assumed that the
Count was well known to her.</p>

<p>"This way, sir," said Miss Scatchett to Dulaunay, as Hartwell
closed the door upon himself, and she led the way up another soft
stair to a bed-room overlooking the lawn. And here Dulaunay, after
surveying its spaciousness, the bright fire, the draperies, and
comfortable bed, muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"<i>Mon dieu</i>, it is not but the English, after all, who know
to be imposing!"</p>

<p>"May I ask, sir," said Miss Scatchett, "if you will be staying
any considerable time with Mr Drayton?"</p>

<p>"But, madame, I hope it," said the pleased Frenchman. "Have the
goodness to make to know Mr Drayton that I descend to dinner in
five minutes."</p>

<p>"Very good sir, and your name?"</p>

<p>"Emile Dulaunay, the Count d'Artenset-Villiers, madam, at your
service," answered the Count.</p>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>VIII. &mdash; HARTWELLL MEETS A
LADY</h2>

<p class="first">If we pass over twelve days from that night of
Hartwell's coming home to Addison Road&mdash;twelve days which
Hartwell spent in a state of the hardest mental strain in learning
a thousand facts, in conversing with fifty people whom he had never
before seen, in fighting his way to a more entrenched position in
the kingdom which he had seized upon and generally, in getting to
himself that almost "new sense" of sharp insight which the many
calls upon his wits made needful to him&mdash;if we pass over these
active twelve days, we find him on the thirteenth afternoon sitting
in his private room in his Fenchurch Street office, looking through
a number of documents relating to landed estate, as title deeds,
conveyances, mortgages, liens, and so on, which he had not had the
time to look into before.</p>

<p>From these he now found himself the owner of an important estate
in Bucks, of another in Hampshire, and of a smaller one in Norfolk.
This last was that Corton Estate where, as we know, "the wife" was.
But Hartwell did not know that she was there and in vain, so far,
had he tried to find out her whereabouts, though he was now fairly
certain that he was really married, for he had found, under lock
and key, a diary of Drayton's in which were more obscure references
to "the wife." But who? where? this question greatly troubled
Hartwell, when he found time, as during his unquiet nights, to
think of it.</p>

<p>This Corton was a dilapidated old place, not yielding any rent,
apparently given over to poachers, and unless Hartwell should some
day think of turning it to some account, it was quite likely that
he might not go down there for years.</p>

<p>Besides these three estates, there was a "Hobham House" in
Surrey, not far from London, and on that twelfth evening, after
examining the deeds, he determined to take a trip to this Hobham
House at once, intending to decide that night as to whether it or
Addison Road house would prove the more suitable for the laboratory
which he was about to make. He therefore got the keys from the
outer office, and took train for the small Surrey station of
Lydney, where he asked his way, and thence walked to Hobham House.
He found it to be a square brick building in a lonely situation at
the end of an avenue of pines, and went through all the rooms,
which were empty but for a few pieces of old furniture here and
there.</p>

<p>He then set out to return to the station, but being absorbed in
thought, he happened to take a wrong path where two paths met, and
walking on and on without noticing his mistake, he was soon in the
park of another estate, which adjoined the woods round Hobham
House. It's name was Garlot Croft; it was the country-seat of
Julia, Lady Methwold, which fact it was that had caused Drayton to
acquire Hobham House lying near it, though he had hardly ever
occupied Hobham House.</p>

<p>Hartwell was descending an avenue rather rough with ruts of
hardened mud, when he saw before him a lady walking in the same
direction as he, rolling a bicycle&mdash;saw, as it were, without
seeing her, for he was looking on the ground. He had soon overtaken
and passed her a little, absorbed in thought, when he heard a deep
voice of mockery behind him say:</p>

<p>"A justly-offended James!"</p>

<p>He turned, and his eyes rested on a spirited image, a lady of
twenty-two or twenty-three years, with a small head and face and a
divinely tall length of body between her toes and her chin, and
Hartwell said to himself:</p>

<p>"This can only be 'Julia,' whom I imagined to be still at
Cannes."</p>

<p>Since she had formally given him up, he had not even been at the
pains to answer her letter of dismissal. He had not, indeed, had
the time to remember her existence. He put out his hand with a
genial smile in his eyes, pleased with her frank beauty, the
freedom of her carriage, and her profusion of soft-brown hair,
which had become rather loose and dropped a little behind the neck,
and he said:</p>

<p>"No, I was absorbed in thought, and looking on the ground. I am
not offended, still less justly offended. For I am sure you never
did a wiser thing, for yourself at least."</p>

<p>At once she looked at him with puzzled eyebrows&mdash;a little
cynical surprise&mdash;and her first thought was:</p>

<p>"Well, but someone has been teaching my James to talk modestly,
and to lift his hat with distinction."</p>

<p>They walked side by side under the over-arching branches of two
rows of beech trees, she rolling her bicycle, and even as they
talked, Hartwell's mind was inwardly busy with her, summing her up
in a way that had become almost mechanical to him since he had
entered the great world under false colours, and he thought to
himself:</p>

<p>"She is a widow, young as she is, and she is as fated to second
marriage as streams to flowing downward. The portrait in the locket
is doubtless that of the already-forgotten Methwold&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have been a long while considering your reply to my letter,
James," she said, bridling, "or are you more correctly 'Mr Drayton'
now?"</p>

<p>"Still 'James, let me hope," he answered with a patronising
humor in his eyes, "though you, perhaps, should no longer be
'Julia,'" and he thought to himself, "she is an athlete, a
horsewoman, no doubt&mdash;the back and neck. But I fancy that only
fencing could give that liberation of her curves, that buoyant air.
These are her grounds, that yonder is her house, she would not
otherwise have troubled to alight from her bicycle on account of
this little roughness of the ground."</p>

<p>While he was thinking this, Julia was saying:</p>

<p>"I have not the least objection to being still 'Julia,' if you
like. I recognise, of course, that you have the right to be
aggrieved, and I am quite disposed to be chums ever after."</p>

<p>"Then I call you the most charming of ladies," replied Hartwell,
while he was thinking inwardly:</p>

<p>"She is certainly a fine specimen of the human mammal. Her most
soft and womanly air is due, I fancy, to her hair, which is very
fine, loose and light, and partly perhaps to the peachy coloring of
her face, or something in the eyes, which are purple, like the
violet or pansy, and are very soft in expression, though bright and
spirited."</p>

<p>And while these thoughts of her were fluttering through his
mind, Julia on her part was thinking with surprise of him: "But
what is the matter? He is talking very much better than I always
thought!"</p>

<p>And she said aloud:</p>

<p>"I was very sorry about the accident, James."</p>

<p>"'Very' is one of the strong words," he answered in a coldly
playful way, smiling upon her with a patronising eye as a man of
many cares and deep thought may watch something pretty play in his
mood of relaxation, and still his thoughts kept running on her,
dissecting her without any conscious effort, thinking: "She has a
child, probably only one, a girl, under three years, for the doll
on the handle-bar seems to be of cloth, it was bought <i>en
route</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I was sincerely sorry," she said, in answer to his
criticism of her 'very,' "you are not, please, to consider me a
monster of heartlessness, for I do not think I am, then."</p>

<p>"You are not a monster at all," he answered, "but an excellent
little human person, producing your allotted influence upon the
history of life," and, as he said this, he was thinking
inwardly.</p>

<p>She, meanwhile, was looking up at him with the most puzzled of
eye-brows, for she could not believe her ears. He had called her "a
little human person, producing her allotted influence&mdash;!" Was
this then her rejected James? Drayton had called her "a clipper!"
and she thought again with a pout, "His vulgarity must have been a
pose! he is really quite nice when he chooses! I don't
understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At any rate," she said aloud, "it seems pretty evident that I
need not reproach myself with having broken anyone's heart."</p>

<p>"The wound on my head," he answered, "acted as a
counter-irritant to that in my heart. The two thus tended to cure
each other."</p>

<p>"Did, actually, cure each other, say."</p>

<p>"Pardon, only tended to!" he said with a sort of paternal
gallantry. "The wound in the heart&mdash;remains."</p>

<p>"Dear me! It has lasted three eternal weeks, then."</p>

<p>"It can&mdash;never&mdash;be effaced."</p>

<p>"Is it my doing, really, that you are subdued and graver?" she
asked seriously after a minute, with a side glance up at his
face.</p>

<p>"I fear so," he answered, languidly toying with her, "the wound,
you know, in the heart."</p>

<p>"Is it that accident?" she laughed, pleased, somehow at his
pretence that her thunderbolt of dismissal had not fallen without
hurting anyone, yet with a question, a doubt in her, whether her
James could by any possibility be making fun of her.</p>

<p>"Yet, you see, I haunt your grounds," he said.</p>

<p>"You are only passing through to somewhere from Hobham
House."</p>

<p>"No, I am here to be near you."</p>

<p>"Improbable fib. One would almost say that you were 'trying
again,' James; but though the words are honeyed, the tone is bored,
and the ears of widows are quick and accurate!"</p>

<p>"Then I must resign myself to being misunderstood."</p>

<p>They had come to a mansion with a Jacobean-Italian front and
there they continued to talk a while on the steps of a terrace. It
was suddenly so dark that he was to her only a cloaked pillar under
a silk hat, and she to him something slim and dainty in a short
skirt, with a ghost of white where some phlox lay on her bosom.
Near Christmas, as it was, scents of Marechal Niel roses were to be
detected in the air, some far-separated lights appeared in the
mansion, accentuating its dreamy gloom, and the park lay silent,
but for the noises made by three spaniels, which had come to meet
her and were gambolling about them.</p>

<p>"Did you really know, then, that I had come back?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Let me be candid&mdash;no. I had been to Hobham House, where I
am thinking of setting up a laboratory, and making the house my
home."</p>

<p>"Did you say a laboratory?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What sort of a laboratory?"</p>

<p>"The laboratory of a biologist."</p>

<p>"For your own use, do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then, I suppose I am dreaming, or are you Joking?"</p>

<p>"Is this so surprising, then?" he said: "I have always cherished
an inclination for science, and finding myself at the age of
thirty-eight no longer a stripling, and superfluously wealthy, I am
now working hard to free myself from all business, in order to
devote the remainder of my days to my inclination. I know of no
heart in the world that loves me, unless it be one poor boy, to
whom I have been a father, I have no ties, the rather coarse life
which you have seen me live never really pleased me: so you will
readily conceive why I decide to shut myself in with a mistress who
will not write me a letter casting me into despair on the first
rainy morning."</p>

<p>He could no longer see Julia's face, but there was now something
more depicted there than mere astonishment. Some finger of pain and
pity touched Julia's heart at this strange mixture of truth and
falsehood pronounced by Hartwell, and her delicate bosom swelled a
little at the birth of an instinct within her that if this man fell
sick, she would like to nurse him, and if he were sad, then that
would be sweet to a woman to lay her hand on his head.</p>

<p>"James," she said, with her eyes cast down a moment, "I am
sorry, then, if I have seemed flippant."</p>

<p>"But I cannot permit you to be sorry," he answered. "I repeat
seriously that never were your instincts so wise as when you cast
me into despair, just as they were never so frivolous as when you
engaged yourself to marry me. I was not half worthy of you."</p>

<p>"But by saying that, you make me doubt the truth of it, James. I
did not, perhaps, quite know you. I'm afraid that, since I desired
to disengage myself, I should have done it with rather more
responsibility and&mdash;respect. I am cross with us both then. You
should have made me like you better"&mdash;her dry little mouth
pouted, as she said this.</p>

<p>"As for me, however you liked me, I like you well," said he.
"You are charming, you are most beautiful, and you are also
good."</p>

<p>And, bending to say this in a lower tone, there took place
within Hartwell an event, an affection, an act of the soul, which
he himself would have called "physiological," but really was no
more so than a chord of music is. He somehow found her hand in his,
and kissed it.</p>

<p>She laughed lightly, uneasily, murmuring in a soft low
voice:</p>

<p>"No, James."</p>

<p>"What, have I transgressed?"</p>

<p>"Everybody knows that we are parted. It would be extremely
absurd, really, if we are not. And we must not steal things, must
we?"</p>

<p>"Then, I shall steal no more. Honesty is the best policy, as you
say, but the hardest."</p>

<p>"Is it hard, really?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Frankly, it never once entered my head to take you seriously,
James, to dream that you really cared, or that I did. It is very,
very, very amusing! Did you really care, then?"</p>

<p>"No, no," he said in a new tone; "I must be serious, I see, with
you and with myself. Forget my light words. I find you all too
important a matter to trifle with&mdash;your dove's voice, your
soft face, and all the pleasant fruit of your womanly being. Human
creatures are among the paltriest of insects really, dear Lady
Julia, if we consider it, but there are those of them, it seems,
that have the biological property of giving out a music by merely
living, as the dragon-fly's flight is accompanied by a musical
sound. And such you seem to me at this moment, more admirable and
important than all the crowd of suns visible to the eye on a
moonless night, which delusion of mine proves to you, does it not,
that my consciousness is not at this moment at its brightest. And
now, moreover, I am only flirting with you, no doubt. Let not half
that you hear me say be believed! This impression that I have of
you is the merest passing delusion of my senses, you are no fairer
and better than any other."</p>

<p>"Am I to be pleased, then, or vexed? Shall I laugh, or cry?"
asked Julia, laughing. "I seem at last to have met a complex man!
Or shall I simply remain silently astonished, with neither laughter
nor tears? I assure you, that since the darkness has hidden your
face I have quite the impression that you are not yourself, but
another man. But come, Aunt Margaret is waiting: dinner."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I will, not," Hartwell said shortly.
"Good-night."</p>

<p>He shook hands abruptly, turned, and had walked away some steps
when she, after a few seconds of hesitation, called after him:</p>

<p>"James! I am going to fox-hunt and spend Christmas with the
house party at Castle Moran&mdash;"</p>

<p>She said no more. He for his part, stood still, silent, tempted
to be there with her, but undecided. He finally broke the silence
by saying:</p>

<p>"I do not remember that I have an invitation."</p>

<p>"I will see to that. That is, if you like."</p>

<p>"I certainly like, but I do not think&mdash;Well, but you are
very good. I must be there, then. Good-night."</p>

<p>Hartwell then walked on through the dark wood, making for the
railway station, but going the wrong way, so that later on he had
to traverse the park again. He fell at once, as he went, into the
dark mood which regularly overcame him at every nightfall, and he
thought within himself: "She is like a little flower on a tall
stem&mdash;certainly very pleasant, very precious, very rare. The
deluded arms open of themselves to embrace her&mdash;We, however,
are 'married,' we have a 'wife'&mdash;Let us choose, if we can, to
keep within the four corners of our British Law."</p>

<p>Julia, for her part, looked after him till he disappeared,
amazed at herself and at him. She had liked Drayton, his rough way,
his beard, his nonchalance, his frankly City-man point of view. He
had once saved her life in the hunting-field, he had, moreover,
appealed to her toleration, had amused and outraged her, and she
had engaged herself to him mainly because that was outrageous and
perverse. But there was some quality of weight, of eminence in
him&mdash;he was admirable. She dropped her bicycle upon the lawn
with rather a crash, and went into the house with a sigh.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>IX. &mdash; HARTWELL IS IN GREAT
PERIL</h2>

<p class="first">Meantime, as was said before, Oswald had slept a
night at the "Anchor Inn" in exile from Pall Mall and from those
two rooms behind Piccadilly where his man, Magee, made Irish bulls,
and told to Oswald whatever Oswald did not already know of the
doings and movements of people in the great world.</p>

<p>Precisely why he had slept a night in such a "hole," as Oswald
called the "Anchor," he could not have told, but he had wished to
be on the spot. Something very odd in "James's" denial to him that
he knew Letty Barnes, when he certainly did, and in her strange
disappearance, without taking any hat with her, stirred up some
interest in Oswald's rather dull mind. It was not like him to be
there in a bed of that "Anchor" tavern, but no one is always a
fossil and there Oswald was.</p>

<p>By the next morning the countryside was eagerly talking about
the girl. Letty's appearance, dress, habits, were described in the
Norfolk papers, with comments on her good name, her "walk and
conversation," her place and use in the little local world where
she had lived and run her course. She had been a good chapel-goer,
and, till lately, had taught in the Sunday school, and kept a
missionary-box, had gone to spend three weeks with an aunt in
Cromer during the summer, but had spent only two, though Barnes,
her father, still maintained that she had spent three. The
newspapers, however, had definitely found out from the aunt that
she had spent only two, and Oswald thought that that third week of
her absence from the tavern of which Barnes was so sure, may have
been spent with his brother, for he remembered that Drayton had
been to Cromer that summer.</p>

<p>On the whole, it was pitiful, the girl seemed to have been
snatched away by the Harpies, somehow. Her poor feet had strayed,
the Maelstrom had caught her, clouds and darkness were round about
her.</p>

<p>Oswald breakfasted on an excellent lobster in that room of the
tavern where writing-materials had been placed that night of the
murder, for his brother James. Oswald was alone in the room: Barnes
had not risen that morning, or, at least, had refused to unlock his
door to the old grandmother of the place. The tavern was closed to
the public, and a presence like death was all about it.</p>

<p>By Oswald's plate was a note-book made of very thin
ivory-leaves, and on these, as he ate, he re-read a few notes which
he had made.</p>

<p>His mind, like all his personality, was slow in movement and too
standoffish to get very near to truth; but still he was knowing,
versed in men and things, and had minutely questioned Barnes and
spurred his memory the previous evening.</p>

<p>He had now, therefore, on his note book the facts about how
McCalmont first, and then Barnes, had seemed to hear a cry
somewhere outside the tavern, though Barnes still seemed to be
certain that it was the wind that rough night. How Drayton,
meantime, was upstairs writing--"For how long?" Oswald had asked.
Barnes could not be too sure, but quite half-an-hour; for when
Drayton came down, McCalmont had said: "Why, you must have written
ten letters," and Drayton had replied: "Only one, boy, but that one
required some thinking." James, then, had had plenty of time to
talk to Letty. That he had talked to her (supposing her then in the
tavern), was almost proved by the fact that Oswald had found a
shred of her writing in James's coat-pocket. James knew her, as to
that no further proof was wanting.</p>

<p>"My good James," thought Oswald, "what, then, have you done with
this Letty? He had no house hereabouts&mdash;yes, he has, though!
Corton Chantry can't be very far, and that is where Letty is! He
made her go down by the back stairs to get to the motor car, and
then whipped her off to Corton some time before the accident. But
why on earth without a hat? With her watch and chain&mdash;but
without a hat."</p>

<p>Then again Oswald considered the words "cruel bru" on the shred
of paper. If cruel brute meant James, then Letty was angry, which
was against the Corton Chantry theory, unless, indeed, he took her
to conciliate her. Oswald had, of course, shown the shred to no
one: the one motive of his interest in the matter was, by means of
this handle, to wheedle and force £500, which he needed, from his
brother, if he could once get at the certainty that Drayton had
abducted the girl. So far the notion that she might be dead had
hardly taken root in any mind.</p>

<p>Oswald rose from breakfast with his wits all in confusion, he
could see no light, and thinking was as burdensome to him as
running is to a fat man. He lit a cigar, and slowly limped about
the room. He decided at one moment that he would go to Corton
Chantry, and see. But then again, the uncertainty of discovering
anything made that a bore. No, he would return to London, but first
would telegraph to Walker to come down, and put Walker on to see if
he could find out anything. Walker was not altogether a fool.
(Walker was a young man in London who did shorthand writing and
Oswald had him from time to time to write his letters and to write
statements for the lawyers about an endlessly long and vague
lawsuit which Oswald had in the courts.)</p>

<p>Oswald had written some letters the previous evening at a
worm-eaten oak cabinet in which there was some paper, and going now
and again to it he wrote to Walker the words:</p>

<p>"I want you to come here at once. Get a pound from Magee." He
then opened an assurance-almanac which lay at his elbow to blot the
words, and, in doing this, he saw some inverted writing which
looked like his brother's.</p>

<p>This astonished him. James, then, did actually write a letter in
that room, as he had pretended to want to do. Had he two motives in
coming here, then?&mdash;one motive to write and one to see Letty?
For he certainly did see Letty. Oswald neatly tore out the leaf of
the blotting-paper, and held it before a spotted piece of mirror
hung from the white-washed timber and now, though the leaf was
rather thick with blots, he could read in the mirror the words:
"Now is the time for all good men," and again lower down, "now is,
the time for all good men to come to the rescue of the."</p>

<p>Odd words, but certainly in James writing. This, then, was that
letter that "wanted some thinking." Oswald searched through the
assurance-almanac, but could find nothing more in Drayton's hand.
He sat at a window and considered it, and in his effort of thought
little sweat-grains stood out on his square bald head. "Now is the
time for all good men to come"&mdash;it was all a blind! a thousand
to one. It would be interesting to see the whole of that
"letter."</p>

<p>But, if a blind, James must have been terribly in earnest to
hide his relation with Letty at the moment when he was at the pains
to sit down and write those words. He was not a cautious man, took
consequences breezily, pooh-poohed most things. Why, then, this
special anxiousness in the case of Letty, shown, too, in his denial
at Aylsham that he knew her.</p>

<p>Now first arose in Oswald's mind the thought: "Suppose we are
seeking a living girl, when we should be seeking a dead? 'Cruel
bru' seemed to indicate passion!"</p>

<p>At this thought, sitting at a window overlooking the kitchen
garden, Oswald went off into a day-dream about a steam yacht of
Drayton's called the <i>Sempronia</i>, about banquets at Claridge's
and the Carlton, and mingled with it all in his dream was a
ceremony at St. Peter's, Eaton Square, in which the soft face of
Julia, Lady Methwold, with its peachy painting would be present,
and he, Oswald, by her side&mdash;If James had, by chance, killed
Letty, and if he, Oswald, could clearly prove it to himself and to
James, then James' banking-account would become Oswald's to the
last penny; or in the last resort the clown might hang&mdash;why
not? Oswald had cringed to his brother too many years, despising
him the while, not to dislike him now.</p>

<p>That was indeed a dream about the <i>Sempronia</i> and St.
Peter's&mdash;if one had only the wit, energy, and patience to
realise it! if one could hit upon the right clues, hide them from
the police, and hold them as a Damocles sword over the head of
James, till James had formally made over everything&mdash;But wit,
energy, and patience were an infernal bore. One could not if one
could not, one was no longer so young as one had been. It made one
pant to think and achieve things. And was the primary assumption
correct? It seemed improbable. Mr Jimmy was certainly a shadier
beggar than most people supposed, but murder was a tallish
order.</p>

<p>Yet that alone explained about the hat. She had gone without a
hat. James, therefore, while supposed to be writing, might all the
time have been with Letty, and done her some harm. Who could tell?
But in that case the body would not be far&mdash;</p>

<p>It grew toward noon. Oswald went up three little steps to his
bedroom, took his hat, coat, and stick, descended, sent the
telegram by a stable-lad to Walker, his shorthand man, and went out
at the back of the inn. Barnes, so far, had not shown himself that
day.</p>

<p>The day was not cold, but wintry looking, with that dead mist
which belongs to winter. Oswald had already examined the grounds
without result, and though a new thought was now in him, he went
languidly limping, not at all believing in his own conclusion. He
sauntered into a fir plantation, smoking a cigar. Yonder, in a
hollow sheltered by sweeps of meadow-land, appeared dimly through a
veil of mist a little Norfolk church of flint, with a thatched roof
and a round tower, and beyond stood a farmstead of neat red brick,
with crow-stepped gables. On the ground no trace was now to be seen
of Drayton's and Betty's terrible struggle. It had rained in
torrents since then and many feet, moreover, had passed over the
spot in the search for her. Oswald came to the fateful
place&mdash;a kind of gut.</p>

<p>"It she were really killed," he thought, "she would be somewhere
about here."</p>

<p>All along the lower part of the two walls of the gut there was
bush, growing high and rank at some points, such as furze, nettle,
grasses, tufts of scabious thistle. Midway between the two walls,
where the gut is slightly deeper, there ran a rivulet among rocks,
some of which were of considerable size. Half a mile to the south
of the tavern the gut is crossed by a one-arch bridge&mdash;</p>

<p>Oswald went that way, toward the bridge: but he had not gone far
when he stood still, for at a shelving spot at the edge of the gut
a stone happened to roll before his foot down into the gut. He
heard it fall through the bushes at the bottom, and at once he
heard another sound, a rushing sound through the bushes, which
caused him to peep over, and with a shudder of disgust he saw a
black cat scamper guiltily out from a mass of bush which was
infested with a swarm of water gnats. The stone had fallen near the
cat and frightened it in what it was doing. Oswald guessed, he even
knew, then.</p>

<p>Always with his deliberate slight limp, but now with a wild
heart, he returned to the house. He asked the old grandmother in
the parlour where Barnes was, made his way to Barnes' room, and
persisted in knocking at the door, till Barnes looked out.</p>

<p>"You had better come with me, Barnes," said Oswald, "get some
things on. But you will have to keep your courage up, my good
sir."</p>

<p>Barnes drew on a pair of boots and, without lacing them, came
out in his shirt and trousers, with the braces hanging down. He did
not say anything, but silently followed Oswald, with that
angry-looking frown which always made his heavy eyes look like blue
slits. When they reached the gate in the hedge, Barnes must have
been struck by some misapprehension, for he turned pale and
hesitated, but he said nothing, and after a moment continued to
follow Oswald. And soon he was standing by the gut, and Oswald's
stick was pointing.</p>

<p>Barnes looked at Oswald steadily, stupidly, for some time, with
a piercing frown and with the tip of his tongue out on his lower
lip, as if trying to read Oswald's soul, and failing; he was
stunned. Then the poor man's lips went crooked, and he smiled,
looking down where she lay, and he crooned: "Well,
Letty&mdash;"</p>

<p>Oswald turned away, murmuring something. There was that in the
face of Barnes which could not be looked at. The poor Barnes
suddenly gave way beneath his weight, and fell, bawling out in
distress.</p>

<p>Oswald could not get him to lift himself, and had to leave him
while he himself went back to the inn to send a message to the
police. Barnes remained there till near five, when two country
constables and a detective hot from London arrived with a
stretcher. They were a party of nine and Barnes was with them,
grimly calm now, when she was drawn out of the bush. He saw her
face in a minute in the failing light, before the macintosh covered
it. It was engorged, violence was evident, and Barnes uttered a
threat against her destroyer.</p>

<p>He trudged steadily by the body in his undress all the way into
Aylsham, following her desperately, taking no notice of anyone or
of any question, only trudging behind her like a machine, following
her to the very last. He did not droop nor weep. It was only near
eight o'clock in the evening, when he was forcibly removed from
near her at the mortuary, that he dropped his arms and head upon an
officer's shoulders like a man shot, and there gave way to
sobbing.</p>

<hr>

<p>Barnes was returning to "The Anchor" in a trap from "The Black
Dogs" in Aylsham, when he met Oswald and Oswald's shorthand man,
Walker, who were being driven from "The Anchor" to Aylsham in
Barnes's own trap. For Walker, summoned by Oswald's telegram, had
arrived at "The Anchor" from London at seven. Barnes called out to
Oswald as they met:</p>

<p>"A word with you, sir," and, sitting next each other in the two
traps, Oswald and Barnes conversed in subdued voices.</p>

<p>"I've wondered," said Barnes, "why you have been so particular
about knowing Mr Drayton's doings that night. I ask you, fair and
square, if you suspect him of knowing my girl."</p>

<p>"He may have. I do not know, Barnes."</p>

<p>"He's a friend or relation of yours, I take it, for I saw you in
his room at 'The Black Dogs' yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yes, an acquaintance; but my interest in the case has no
reference to him, but is simply due to my chance nearness to the
scene."</p>

<p>"Do you think&mdash;fair and square that Drayton had
anything&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I have really come to no conclusion," said Oswald, and in mere
motiveless enmity to his brother he added, "I only see that it
would be stupid to take it for granted that he was in that room all
the time he was supposed to be writing there. He may have gone down
the back stair&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, God help him, if it's so!" cried Barnes, furiously. "I
want no Law&mdash;a life for a life! Drive on, my lad!"</p>

<p>Oswald and Walker then went on to Aylsham, and thence to North
Walsham together, where they separated, Oswald for London, Walker
for Cromer, the latter full of Oswald's instructions as to the
search which lay before him. Walker's task was to discover someone
about Cromer who had seen Drayton and Letty together, and to this
end Walker had with him a photograph of Letty, stolen by Oswald
from the album in the little drawing-room of "The Anchor." The
shred which Oswald had found in Drayton's coat was, of course, a
proof to himself only that Drayton knew Letty: for he had no proof
to show that he had really taken the shred from the coat. Drayton
could deny that it was ever there, and his word would be as good as
Oswald's. Further evidence, therefore, that Drayton knew Letty was
essential in order that Oswald might become "James'" master, and
bitterly Oswald now cursed his luck in losing the letter which
Letty had written him, asking for the date of Drayton's marriage
with Lady Methwold.</p>

<p>Walker, therefore, had instructions to search well for some
witness of Drayton's and Letty's friendship, to keep a mum tongue
in his head, giving no reason to anyone why he asked his questions,
and, if he discovered anything, he was to give hints of a bribe to
the person from whom he discovered it, on condition that that
person would tell what he had seen to no one but Walker. Above all
Walker was to be very quick, for Oswald feared that the police
might get some scent from somewhere of the acquaintance of Drayton
and Letty, and might be beforehand with him in bringing home the
guilt of the murder to Drayton, in which case Oswald would be
baulked of his power over his brother's cheque book.</p>

<p>But, as a matter of fact, no quickness on the part of Walker was
necessary, for the police were without the clues which had led
Oswald to suspect Drayton, namely, the shred of Letty's letter and
the blotting-leaf with the nonsense-words. These were in Oswald's
safe-keeping. Even after a long time Letty and Drayton were not in
the slightest degree connected in any mind, except in Oswald's, and
vaguely, through Oswald, in Barnes'. The police did not even
trouble to go to ask Hartwell if "he" had seen her in "The Anchor"
on the night of the murder, when "he" had written a letter there,
for Barnes told them that Drayton had told him the next morning at
"The Black Dogs" in Aylsham that he had not seen her. That Letty
had had a lover was certain, and the police ransacked Norfolk,
including Cromer, where Letty had been that summer, to find
him.</p>

<p>But they unearthed nothing, and after two futile arrests
remained agape at the mystery of the girl's death. By the merest
chance, however, Walker, without the least merit on his part,
discovered something where the police failed, for of the two people
in question, Walker had the photograph of the girl and knew the
man, but the police only knew the girl, the man being anybody to
them. But Oswald should have conducted his researches in person,
for Walker, a young "cockney" clerk, was hardly born for research,
and bungled matters. After five useless days in Cromer itself, he
wandered out in the direction of Overstrand and that group of
villages, much frequented by visitors where, as the local saying
goes:</p>

<p class="verse">"Gimmingham, Trimmingham, Knanton, and Trunch,<br>
Northrepps and Southrepps lie all of a bunch."</p>
<br>

<p>About each of these villages Walker loitered in turn, liking
this vague life of research, till he grew to know the lighting-up
minute of the lighthouse, the tombstones round the ruined
church-tower on the cliffs, the flocks of Christmas turkeys, the
coast-guardman's telescope, and the postman's tread in the distance
at evensong. He made languid research in a straw-hat at inns, and
questioned every chance acquaintance in a tone of mystery, but
Oswald was thinking of recalling him when, wandering one afternoon
in a lane near Overstrand, Walker saw in a window across the
breadth of a courtyard, an old piece of cardboard with the word
"Lodgings" written on it.</p>

<p>It was an abandoned farmhouse embowered in old trees, most of it
a rambling ruin of gables and lattices, but one small part of it
was modern, and before this part there was a garden plot full of
cottage flowers, and there was some poultry in the court-yard. It
was occupied by one Gissing, a hale old fellow, one of those
amphibious men who live near the coast, a thatcher and reaper, but
also a waterman. To say that he had a beard grown back from the
chin, like a fringe tied round the jaws, is to describe him. His
wife, a hearty, large countrywoman of forty, kept a shop of little
oddments in one window, and they had one daughter, named Sarah,
seventeen years of age.</p>

<p>Walker went in, really to drink a glass of milk, but, being
there, he began to chat; and soon this question arose whether a
gentleman with a long black beard, and a fair girl (photograph
produced) had been seen by any of them that summer, to which the
wife answered:</p>

<p>"Why, they, were here with us a week. They would be Mr Drayton
and his lady."</p>

<p>Here, then, was the treasure struck. Walker was so proud of
himself, that he decided at once to become a detective. The same
day he sent the news to Oswald. But he was a talkative, loose,
swaggering fellow, and talked too much to the Gissings during his
repeated visit of the next two days. His unnecessary insistance
upon silence, his large promises, his hints of Drayton's importance
in the world, all this turned the Gissings' head with fabulous
hopes. Gissing himself was no brilliant wit, but "mother" was
canny. What the matter was they did not quite know, did not even
know that the girl whose face they saw in the photograph was dead,
but it was clear that the great Drayton was in danger&mdash;of
something, that Walker was his enemy and that, if they received £50
from Walker's side, they might well receive a thousand pounds if
they took the other side.</p>

<p>So on the third morning&mdash;four days before
Christmas&mdash;just when Oswald was turning in his tiresomely slow
mind the project of going down to Gissing, Gissing went up to
Drayton. He and the wife had plotted it darkly in their heads upon
their beds. Walker had mentioned Fenchurch Street as being the
place where Drayton's office was. Gissing would be easily able to
find it by making inquiries, said the wife, and with almost the
last of his £7 harvest money Gissing, saying not one word to
anyone, but cannily taking the tide of fortune at the flood, took
ticket for London, and so, not knowing to what manner of man he was
going, bid a long farewell to his native Poppyland.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>X. &mdash; HARTWELL BEGINS TO
"UPROOT"</h2>

<p class="first">It was near five p.m., Hartwell's day's work was
over, and he was standing with his back to the fire and his elbows
stuck up on the mantelpiece of his private room in his Fenchurch
Street offices. It was now the third week since he had come in to
that wonderful kingdom of his, which he owed to the mere chance of
passing at a certain hour along a certain place of the Norwich
Road. All, so far, had gone well, but his two "nasal wrinkles" were
somewhat more deeply marked than before. There was a wrinkle or two
more at the eye-corners, adding meaning and history to that smile
of his eyes, and a look of care was among the furrows of that brow,
from which the hair stood up a little and fell back in tufts,
without any parting.</p>

<p>The fact was, that Hartwell's nights were not peaceful. He had
impressions, dreams, that were as real to him as anything which he
saw or handled during his waking hours. There was a face which
might either be his or another's, according to the state of his
mind and body. Something had gone wrong with his nerves in respect
to the dead man, Drayton: every morning he chided, or smiled at,
himself, but every evening he grew morose again.</p>

<p>The conduct, too, of the mastiff, Bull, had made an altogether
exaggerated impression upon Hartwell's nerves. At one time he had
Bull on the brain, he dreamt of Bull. How much secret kindness had
he lavished on the hound, but it persisted in regarding him as a
ghost. But for the charming talkativeness of the French count,
Hartwell would have found a quiet evening at home unbearable, but
the Frenchman's tongue flowed with a constant stream of anecdotes,
epigrams, adventures, and drolleries and Hartwell would have found
it hard now to part with him.</p>

<p>But if the nights went badly, the days went well. The industry
of Hartwell's thorough mind had been brought to bear upon, and had
mastered, Drayton's large business, and he was already almost in a
position to be able to withdraw from the City life without making
large losses. Moreover, he had met at a Merchant Taylors' banquet a
certain Professor M&mdash;&mdash;, with whom he had become
friendly, and M&mdash;&mdash; was at this time turning two rooms of
the first floor at Addison Road into a first-class laboratory for
him. To the day when he would be able to call himself a really
accomplished biologist, Hartwell was now looking forward with
pleasure.</p>

<p>And this was all the positive joy that Drayton's million had
brought to Hartwell, except the rather dangerous joy of his meeting
in the park of Garlot Croft, with a lady whom he had likened to a
flower on a tall stem. "Cloy me&mdash;for five years!" he had
prayed to the Under-world that wild night on the Norwich Road, at a
crazy moment in which he was very unlike himself, but he now found
that there was really nothing amusing in the world to buy with the
riches which he had, except a laboratory. Dinners at £7 a head and
the wine of Chateau Yehym no longer entertained his staid mind.</p>

<p>As to the numbers of men and women whom he had to pretend to
know familiarly, Hartwell had passed through well, sometimes with a
moment of awkward misery, but never with a breakdown. In fact,
lightning had now become the habit of Hartwell's mind to such an
extent that, as was said before, it was almost like the phenomenon
of a new sense grown up in him at the many pressing calls made by
his situation upon ins brain. Though, of course, it must have been
in him in the germ beforehand, or it could not have grown up. In
the same way, as we know, the tadpole is a fish while it lives in
water, but when it takes to the land the new conditions so change
his body that the fish becomes a frog. And this hard-won knack of
sharpness was exercised by Hartwell, not only to the extent needful
for his self-protection, but over and above, with the pleasure of a
creature sporting in its element, or with the pleasure of one who
by long toils has impressed a new and better rhythm upon one's
breathing and at last one finds oneself breathing morally, even in
one's sleep, without any effort&mdash;like that "Master of Breath"
(Sahib Nafas), who once breathed in Palestine&mdash;and one is all
well and perfect, and can hardly bear oneself for abounding joy,
because one has really learned at last how to breathe the air. So
to some extent it was with Hartwell and his new nimbleness of wit,
which he used as a skirmisher uses his short-sword.</p>

<p>At the mere approach of a new man Hartwell now drew conclusions,
quite in the manner of the excellent (but, of course, fictitious)
Sherlock Holmes, though in a different intellectual mood, perhaps.
A neck-tie, a handshake, told him their tale, after some talk he
was at home in the situation.</p>

<p>But many things harassed Hartwell, apart from his terrible
uncertainties with regard to "the wife." Mysterious letters came to
him, threats, freakish rendezvous, sinister vague telegrams.</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">"MEET ME TO-NIGHT AT THE SAME PLACE AT EIGHT.
THE PINK PARROT IS TALKING. MOST IMPORTANT."</p>

<p>Such was one of them. It had no signature, where "the same
place" was he did not know, and the most earnest torturing of his
wits could bring him no hint of light as to the possible meaning of
that so important talking of the pink parrot. Or, again, there was
this letter from a Norwich bank:</p>

<p class="letter">"We beg to remind you that the sum of £400
deposited with us for the use of Mr Steve Anderson is now reduced
to 15s."</p>

<p>Who Steve Anderson was, where he lived, why Drayton had supplied
him with money, Hartwell had no means of knowing. He could hardly
write to the bank to ask who or what or where was this Anderson
whom he himself was paying. Such a letter from him might some day
furnish written evidence that he was not Drayton, and he was far
too wary and sensitive of suspicion to write it. Moreover, he was
pretty sure beforehand that, if he did, the bank would not know
anything about Anderson except his appearance, since it was his
habit to go in person to draw the money. Hartwell thought of
letting the fund in the bank run out, whereupon if Anderson had
known how to write, Anderson would have written to him, but he saw
that Anderson could not write, for the bank had sent him a number
of Anderson's cheques, with only a cross for signature. Hartwell
feared, therefore, that if by ceasing to pay, he forced Anderson to
communicate with, him, Anderson might get a third person to write
the letter, thereby revealing perhaps some dangerous secret of
Drayton's life. And in the end he had to deposit a further £400 in
the bank, without knowing for what object, though it may at once be
said here that this Steve Anderson was a man who looked after "the
wife" at Corton.</p>

<p>Then, again, there came another letter in an illiterate scrawl,
without any address on it, the writer evidently assuming that
Drayton was familiar with her address, and this one said:</p>

<p class="letter">"The child tried to run away last week to go to
her mother, she says, and I only caught her after a lot of trouble,
seeing as she hid herself in the beech wood. I have moved from
there and took a house near-by called 'Hayes,' seeing as it has a
high wall and a gate, and all that expense must come out of the
money in the bank at Cheltenham, so please sir, write to them and
tell them to let me have £20 extra for the month.</p>

<p class="letter">Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="letter">Elizabeth Seward."</p>

<p>Hartwell saw from the postmark that the letter was written at,
or near, a village in Gloucestershire called Birdlip and he thought
that some day, perhaps, when he had time he might go there and see
what this woman and this "child" who "ran away" could be to him.
Drayton, he saw, had deposited £3,000 in the Cheltenham bank, of
which this Elizabeth Seward drew the interest, but the same
difficulties as to finding out anything about her through the bank
faced him as in the case of Steve Anderson, and he had, as the
woman asked, to write to the bank bidding them give her an extra
£20, without at all knowing for what object. Though it may be
stated at once that this "child" was a daughter, named Rosie, of
that Martha Drayton, "the wife," who was in the care of the unknown
Steve Anderson at Corton.</p>

<p>Or, again, Hartwell received this mysterious and ugly-looking
cable in cypher from Buenos Ayres:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">"Think it can be done at last, but still
ticklish. Two German Government spies to be nicked first."</p>

<p>He did not know what "it" was which could be done at last.</p>

<p>Or, again, this from a Cornish village:</p>

<p class="letter">"You will have read in the paper that my daughter
Margaret drowned herself in Harrold's pond two nights since. You
know this only comes of what you did to her husband, sending men to
sea in a rotten old tub of a ship, though you was warned repeatedly
how it would be, and then refusing to help the families of the men
you've murdered. I think that anyone who took the life of a man
like you would only be doing a good deed, but I won't say anything
more about that now. Still I should look out for myself, rich and
great as you are, if I was you.</p>

<p class="letter">Mary Liskeard."</p>

<p>Such things troubled Hartwell. A bitter sense of injury had
grown up in him against Drayton. For, in proportion as he became
more and more established in his kingdom, as he more and more felt
that the wealth which he had wrongfully seized was his own by
natural right, like his own hand or foot&mdash;which he naturally
did feel with the passage of time&mdash;so he more and more felt
Drayton's sins as an outrageous insolence to himself, because he
had to reap them. He grew almost to look not upon himself as the
interloper, but upon Drayton as the interloper, the intruder, the
outsider, the impostor, who had usurped Robert Hartwell's place for
a time, and committed sins in it. And he was in pretty constant
talk with (as it were) Drayton's ghost, kicking it, calling it
"ruffian," "clown." Drayton was always with him. They were more
intimate, soul with soul, than ever perhaps were two human beings
in the world.</p>

<p>Such, then, were some of Hartwell's troubles. He was surrounded
with doubts, dangers, some of them dangers to his life. And now the
question arose: On what principle should Hartwell meet and grapple
with these difficulties? He was not quite decided yet, for though
his reason was quite decided, a still, small voice in some part of
him was at war with his reason. He saw that there were two broad
principles, on one or other of which he might meet those troubles
and dangers. He might complete the wrong-doings of Drayton by added
wrongs, and so rid himself of them with ruthless directness. This,
indeed, would only be what he had promised to do in a crazy moment,
that forgotten night on the Norwich-road. Or, secondly, instead of
cutting the knot thus roughly, he might try to unravel it, looking
upon Drayton's acts as acts to be patiently redressed or endured,
at whatever cost to him self. This would be righteousness. But as
to this latter, let it be clearly said again that righteousness had
no sanction at all for Hartwell, or the school of thought to which
he belonged. The only rational morality in his view was a care of
one's tiny self during one's tiny life on this tiny earth&mdash;a
pure unselfishness or egotism, or, as he called it "egoism." And
since this was the only rational morality, therefore he was
determined to be moral in that way, as far as ever his inherited
love of righteousness would let him&mdash;for what he loved above
all things was to be rational.</p>

<p>Having thus clearly explained his point of view, or rather the
very hue of his mind at this period of his life, one may now
introduce to him the poor country man Gissing, who has just come to
London from the Manor Farm, near Overstrand, full of the hints
about "Drayton's danger," dropped by Walker, Oswald's shorthand
man, and eager to see what luck his knowledge of Drayton's and
Letty's intimacy would bring him. Hartwell, as was said, was
standing with his elbows stuck up on the mantelpiece behind him,
and his legs crossed, thinking of his troubles, and a clerk from
the outer office looked in, saying: "One Gissing to see you,
sir."</p>

<p>"Show Mr Gissing in," said Hartwell.</p>

<p>In then came Gissing presently, in old Sunday best clothes.
Hartwell touched an electric button and filled the room with light,
for the evening was now getting dark. Gissing touched his forehead
with a low bow. Hartwell returned it with a slight bending of the
head, and while his steadfast eye rested a little sideways on the
countryman, with a smiling twinkle in it, he was saying to
himself:</p>

<p>"He has apparently seen me somewhere before; he is agricultural,
a grubber of root crops, I should say from the right forefinger.
Helps in a mill also, from the whitened outer convolution of the
ear, but he must be seaside, too. Yes, his tint, the sea gaze, the
fringe of beard, the stain of sail ochre on the hand. Norfolk
probably, the wide hat, the black Norman eyes&mdash;from about
Cromer&mdash;He makes crab-pots.</p>

<p>"Have a seat, Gissing."</p>

<p>"No doubt you remember me, master!" asked Gissing, sitting down
on the edge of the chair to which Hartwell pointed.</p>

<p>"Distinctly," answered Hartwell. "Tell your business
quickly."</p>

<p>And he went on thinking: "He has two women, one modern, the
other more old-fashioned, a wife and daughter, say. The younger has
learned feather-stitching, the elder apparently not. He is come
about money, from his abashment, mixed with a certain look of
sharpness. A case of blackmail, but you should be careful, my
friend."</p>

<p>The countryman told what he had come to say, turning his hat
round and round in his hands. Someone who was plainly an enemy to
Drayton had got scent of Drayton's and the young lady's stay at the
Manor Farm, and sent down a youngster from London to ferret it out,
and the youngster had ferreted it out. Drayton, therefore, was in
danger.</p>

<p>"I see," said Hartwell; "but what is the nature of that
danger?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I ain't seen through that much as yet," replied the honest
countryman, "you would be more better able to guess that nor me, no
doubt. I only know that it's a matter o' life and death with you,
judgin' by the manner o' talk of the youngster from London."</p>

<p>"Very good, we will accept that as a truth, that it is a matter
of life and death with me. But tell me this, during the week that I
was in your house, by what name did you hear me call my agreeable
companion?"</p>

<p>"Let me, see&mdash;I don't recollect hearin' you call her any
name&mdash;no, I can't call it to mind. I've heard you say 'my
dear.'"</p>

<p>"Then, here is another stupid mystery," thought Hartwell to
himself with a face of fretful disgust. Is there to be no end to
the miseries and muddles of that clown?</p>

<p>"So you can't tell her name, Gissing?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't seem to recollect hearing you call her name."</p>

<p>"But you could describe her accurately, no doubt?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I could describe her like my own good woman. She wor just
like the photograph that the youngster has."</p>

<p>"You have a wife and, if I remember rightly,
a&mdash;daughter&mdash;or two?"</p>

<p>"A wife and one daughter."</p>

<p>"And are you and they two the only three persons in that part
who remember seeing me with my agreeable companion?"</p>

<p>"So says the youngster from London," replied the countryman,
little dreaming how dangerous this statement was to him and to
those other two.</p>

<p>"And Mr Walker's principals&mdash;meaning the person, or
persons, for whom he is working&mdash;who are they?" asked
Hartwell.</p>

<p>"Ah, there now you're asking me mor 'n I know," replied
Gissing.</p>

<p>"I see. And as to yourself: tell me, Gissing, what sum you
expect from me for denying henceforth that you saw what you did
see."</p>

<p>Gissing smiled sheepishly, with a hung head, and a lip just
shaking a little with agitation. He was silent a while.</p>

<p>"We'll, make it £500 and be done," he said suddenly in a manner
which showed that this sum was immense to him, and quite unusual
and awkward on his lips.</p>

<p>"But suppose, Gissing, that my enemies offer you a thousand
pounds?" said Hartwell.</p>

<p>"Ey, then, I should make it my business to come straight to you,
and say, 'You must give me £1,000,'" replied the dazzled
countryman.</p>

<p>"But, Gissing, suppose that they offer you £2000 on the
conditions that you do not make it your business to come to me?"
said Hartwell, in a tone in which there lurked a certain sinister
reproachfulness.</p>

<p>The simple countryman smiled, silently meditating on these great
sums, hung his head, shrugged his shoulders, and said nothing.</p>

<p>Hartwell's eyes flashed with an evil meaning. Within three weeks
a Sultan severity of mood had grown in him, especially in his
morose hours as night drew on. In a silence marked by the ticks of
the clock he had decided to uproot and scatter the Gissings. He
left the spot where he had been standing at the fireplace, and
began to pace the room, outwardly silent, but within him there was
going on a debate on the highest moral plane between the two
voices. One of the voices, and the one inclined to follow said:
"Banish such qualms, follow reason, and begin this night to up root
the Gissings."</p>

<p>Hartwell turned sharply upon the countryman, saying:</p>

<p>"Well, we shall see, Gissing. I am now going home, and you had
better come with me."</p>

<p>He put on his overcoat, took a bunch of keys from a safe, and
they went out. There was a brougham waiting at the outer door to
take Hartwell home to Addison Road, and they got in. But instead of
"home," Hartwell called out to the coachman "Cannon Street," and
thither they set off. It was a warm evening, the street lamps, just
lit, mingled with some remaining daylight. At Cannon Street
Hartwell took two tickets for Lydney, the small Surrey station
nearest to Hobham House, and they set off, travelling in different
carriages of the train.</p>

<p>Alighting at Lydney, Hartwell passing close by Gissing on the
platform, whispered:</p>

<p>"Perhaps we had better not be seen together&mdash;follow
me."</p>

<p>In his passage through the village he stopped at a little
grocer's shop, bought four tins of potted ham, and two bottles of
claret, caused them to be opened, and took them with him. They then
entered upon the open country, Gissing following about twenty yards
behind Hartwell. It was almost night. They went down the avenue of
pines to Hobham House.</p>

<p>Hartwell, with his bunch of keys, unlocked the door under the
porch, saying at the same time:</p>

<p>"Follow, follow me closely, Gissing, for it is all dark inside:
I am living a bachelor life." And his breath and his pulse were as
tranquil as they ever were, as they entered and walked inward.</p>

<p>As for the countryman, he thought no ill, though rather
surprised at the look of things, but followed up the uncarpeted
stairs through a darkness which was nearly complete. On the second
floor Hartwell struck a match, and other matches on the third, till
he found a certain door which he had in his mind. He knew that the
room behind that door had no window opening upon the grounds, and
only two doors, one opening into a small blind closet, and the one
which he how found and unlocked. As he unlocked it, he said to
Gissing, still keeping his hand on the key:</p>

<p>"In here, Gissing." The countryman passed in, and at once
Hartwell deposited inside the door the two bottles and the tins of
ham, slammed the door, and locked it on the outside. He then called
in through the key hole:</p>

<p>"Gissing, you will see me again in four days time."</p>

<p>Only silence answered Hartwell for a longish while, but as he
made his way down the stairs, a cry from the old man went after
him.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>XI. &mdash; HARTWELL TAKES TO
FLIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">On the morning of Christmas Eve, Hartwell was in
the hunting field galloping by the side of Julia, upon whom his
eyes were fastened and by whose chatter his ears were occupied, for
she was as blithe as a lark or a healthy girl in her teens, that
morning, which was one of those fine, cold, "scenting" mornings,
when the hounds need no holoo nor lifting, and the blood runs
briskly in one's veins. There was no conversation between the two
riders, for everything which Hartwell attempted to say was broken
in upon by the merry Julia, who was breathless with prattle and
high spirits, asking questions without any intention of waiting for
an answer, and flitting airily from subject to subject.</p>

<p>With a field of some eighty hunters, the hounds had been brought
to the gorse and thrown in, whereupon at once one of the whips to
the lee of covert, had seen a fox steal away,. and from that moment
the riding was hard. Hartwell did his best to keep by Julia, though
he had hardly ridden for fifteen years and she was a very dashing
horse-woman, and for some time he succeeded.</p>

<p>"Do you know the word which you suggest to me now?" he managed
to say between two of her breaths.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Lady-bird," he replied.</p>

<p>Such talk was not very like Hartwell, who was made of heavier
metal than the ladies' men, and it proved that his manhood was on
the verge of a great conflagration, these being only the petty
first prattlings of the fire. It seemed to him now that Julia's
place of places was surely in the saddle. She rode with such spirit
and lightness as though her horse was a skiff on a flood, and she
taking a wild voyage in it. But he had the same impression of her
on the previous evening, when he had seen her dance the cake-walk
in the drawing-room at Castle Moran, for he had felt sure then that
neither she nor anyone could ever possibly do anything else quite
so wildly well. And he had had exactly the same impression of her
on seeing her the day before in the orchid house, moving among the
flowers with a bent head and a long train to her dress, for he had
thought then that it was at such moments, when she was serious and
in repose, that she seemed the rightest and the rarest. From which,
it will be seen, that Hartwell thenceforth was to find her ladyship
his beautiful thing under the sun, above all things to be desired
and run after.</p>

<p>At present he was still flirting with her with a certain
gawkiness, and a feeling of stooping down to her level, as when a
learned man is light-minded with young ladies. But all such feeling
was getting as rapidly burnt up as chaff in a furnace, even as they
galloped along together.</p>

<p>"I hear that you have been selling your stable, James," she said
to him. "Can that really be so?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he began, "I have abandoned all thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I thought that 'Queenie' was for me," she laughed,
interrupting him always. "Was that not so? But the broken
engagement cancels the presents, which reminds me that I have all
the things from you done up in a packet, and shall send them. No
protest, we must be quite responsible and correct, like ordinary
responsible people. It is the proper thing also to do something to
the letters, burn them, or send them back&mdash;Are you liking it?
Such a morning for a real barefaced scamper! A white sky&mdash;it
is snowing, did you know? but such a mere spray&mdash;Look at that
thread of red coats drawing away out yonder on the horizon. They
are really racing full-speed, yet they hardly seem to be moving,
like remote cavalry heading under orders for something in some
complex Waterloo&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me look at nothing remote," said Hartwell, with a finical
smile on his thick lips, "my eyes are fully occupied
with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With what is near!" she screamed. "That is not an uncommon
remark to make to a lady; it has even been made to me before, but
hunting and flirting are enemies, for by neglecting the fox you are
apt to catch a vixen! If you be earnest and get in at the death
with me, I will consider your proposal to join your yachting
party&mdash;Where are you going to, then? Egypt? If I go with you,
people will only say, are saying already perhaps&mdash;I have no
intention to be thought crazy on your account&mdash;Oh, look at
poor old Bostie, with that hound running riot! Let us ride! I don't
know your horse, he seems a puller, and your stirrup looks rather
long&mdash;this dear old thing of mine has hunted four days a week
every season for six years, and has just that little over-ripeness
which makes a hunter jolly. Is it not really jolly? like Simla air,
with a bluish tint&mdash;Oh, to be free&mdash;I don't like
fetters!</p>

<p>"If you really want me on the yacht, then, I will, perhaps, but
you must ask me a lot, and be humble. But what about my little
Looloo in that case? She has been asking after you! She said:
'Drayton gone?' and I said: 'Yes, Drayton has become addicted to
science and physiology, poor Drayton!' Oh, look! those hounds have
checked! and there's that Charley absolutely at a loss what to do!
I don't think a master should be his own huntsman&mdash;no, they're
off again! let us ride&mdash;!"</p>

<p>These were her last words which Hartwell heard for seven hours,
except when she called back at him: "Better not take it!" as she
soared over a hedge with a ditch on the taking-off side&mdash;an
unnecessary warning, for a cold disinclination to break his neck
kept Hartwell from feats. He saw her caught away from him into hazy
distances down a ploughed dale in the midst of a flying patch of
pink.</p>

<p>He returned to the "Crown" in M&mdash;&mdash; where the meet had
been, and thence went back with her and the house-party to Castle
Moran in the dusk of the evening. She was then all in furs, with a
lingering rich bloom, like the bloom of a peach, on her face. And
again it seemed to Hartwell that it was when she was so, all in
furs, with such a color, that he loved her the best.</p>

<p>He felt, however, that the task now before him was to behave
himself decently with respect to her, if his affection was worth
anything. Hartwell flattered himself that he was hardly of the same
flesh and blood as that crowd of majors, squires, and lordlings
around him, whose main distinction from the higher ape seemed to
consist in purposely saying "hunt'n" for "hunting." He, for his
part, was a man trained in rational thought, and had henceforth no
longer one, but two, to think for&mdash;himself and his
other-self.</p>

<p>Supposing that she would brave ridicule and renew the engagement
with him&mdash;that was highly improbable&mdash;but if she did, he
could never say to her, "I, Drayton, love you," when his name
really began with an Aitch. Now for the first time, in the presence
of love, he felt the misery of telling stories&mdash;the moral
stickiness and discomfort. He was hardly able to lie to her in
casual talk, how much less at a moment when his soul on its knees,
confessed its love to her. And apart from the fact that he was not
the man he seemed to be, he was "married." The "wife" who
"screamed", mysteriously hidden now, might any day spring up
somewhere and claim him. And Julia's eyes, though wild sometimes,
had a certain reproach in their dark depths when she was still.
Hartwell would not be able to bear that look, if he wronged her, so
a world of obstacles parted them.</p>

<p>She was talking to him about hunting on the return from
M&mdash;&mdash;, and as they entered the castle-hall, was
saying:</p>

<p>"I think our small fields and cramped fences in Surrey are just
as much fun as these Northampton covers. Let us have house-parties
for February&mdash;."</p>

<p>"Us, who?"</p>

<p>"You and me. I at Garlot, and you at Hobham&mdash;"</p>

<p>Late that night he heard her play a "Berceuse,", and sat all the
time with sullen and half-closed lids, hardly venturing to glance
at her clinging to her fiddle, as if she were struggling to hide
and defend the child from someone, and rocking it like a branch in
a storm.</p>

<p>"You play charmingly," he said afterwards, sitting with her in
the old drawing-room, famous for its frieze and stucco ceiling,
"but that is due to the law of your nature, that you do best
whatever you do last."</p>

<p>Her eyes rested very gravely for some seconds on his face before
she replied with her usual frankness of manner:</p>

<p>"Far better not say over-nice things to me, James, lest I
remember them."</p>

<p>Discussing the subject of love, later, Hartwell said:</p>

<p>"Thought is very much higher than most love. But if the love
springs from rational perception, if it is love up in the head,
then, it is itself thought in a state of passion&mdash;though in
its highest activity&mdash;and nothing is higher. If I ever loved I
fancy that, for the most part, I should love in that way."</p>

<p>"But it would show in your eyes just the same," she murmured
absently, at which words Hartwell's brow flushed and his eyes
dropped from her face.</p>

<p>"I should love simply with the heart," said Julia, with a short
nervous laugh, "the whole of it in one lump, and leave the head and
all the rest of me to take care of themselves. But people should
pray to be kept out of that. It is no fun, I can see."</p>

<p>Someone at the piano was playing a <i>valse brillante</i> and
three haphazard couples were dancing among the furniture. Hartwell
was silent, leaning on his knee, till he suddenly said:</p>

<p>"When an emotion arises, reason has only one maxim&mdash;'take
the train.' Hence I mean to be a traveller on Christmas night."</p>

<p>"No, James," she said earnestly. "People will only say that you
are still afraid of being with me."</p>

<p>"I fear that I am not very sensitive to the opinion of the
organism known as 'people.'"</p>

<p>"But not so soon. I have to plan with you our February
hunting-party."</p>

<p>"Then I must only wait and hear."</p>

<p>The castle was full of people disposed to be freely merry and
the next (Christmas) day was jolly with holly, sport, wine and
dancing.</p>

<p>After that whole day spent in Julia's company, Hartwell strolled
out from the castle at about eleven in the night and sat down in a
six-sided summerhouse, in order to think out his problem and come
to some sort of understanding with himself, once for all, if he
could.</p>

<p>Almost suddenly this improbable thing had come upon him like a
bolt from the blue&mdash;this great care. In stepping into
Drayton's shoes, he had foreseen everything, but he had not
foreseen this possibility&mdash;the human nature of his own bosom.
Here was the unexpected for Hartwell! to find himself, not a
thinking machine, but a man in love with a woman. He sat on the
seat of the summer-house and his cold eye looked out sideward at
it, warily, considering and weighing it.</p>

<p>Truly, Julia was very dear to his heart, to his eyes! To be with
her on moonlit midnights on the poop of the <i>Sempronia</i> in the
middle of the sea, when it was calm, and look into her eyes, as he
drew her shawl close around her shoulders, they two alone in the
world, seemed to Hartwell a fair prospect. But that was not the
point: the point was that, if he loved her, he should not tell her
that he was Drayton, And if he told her that he was Drayton, then
he should not marry her, Drayton being already married.</p>

<p>"Egoism" was Hartwell's settled creed, but in the presence of
Julia "egoism" apparently broke down. He found himself thinking
more of her than of himself.</p>

<p>Behind the summer-house was a wood all stark with the frost,
before its door were four steps with stone balustrades to them,
leading down to a lawn on a lower level. On the lawn was a lake and
in the middle of the lake a stone satyr, standing on a rock. On the
lawn also, between the lake and the summer-house, was a sundial,
raised on steps and on and over everything shone a cold Christmas
moonlight.</p>

<p>Hartwell had once before spoken with Julia here, and while he
now sat there, bent down and thinking, she came again. His heart
pulsed slowly and strongly, like fierce cuts of a whip in his
breast, when he heard her laugh and knew that she was coming,
before he saw her. She was with a school-boy son of their hostess,
and Hartwell presently saw them strolling across the lawn in the
direction of the lake. She looked wondrously tall to him in the
moonlight in her wraps and a furred cloak, like Diana towering
above her maidens. She and the boy halted by the lake, which was a
stone's throw from the summerhouse. He thought that they would not
know that he was there. He made no sound, but when after some
minutes the boy left her at a run, Julia moved toward the
summerhouse and Hartwell went and met her on the steps of the
terrace.</p>

<p>"You are here, then," she said. "I thought you might be, and I
am glad, for I want to ask you something. But here, sitting still,
and it is so cold! Happy men at least put on overcoats, James,
therefore you are unhappy. Is it about me?"</p>

<p>He flung away his cigar, saying irrelevantly, as they went into
the summer-house together:</p>

<p>"I am not a man for riotous company. I like quietude and hence
am here."</p>

<p>"You not a man for riotous company? Well, then, this is the
second time lately that I have had the selfsame impression! and
each time when your face has been hidden: it is a little
uncanny!"</p>

<p>"What impression?"</p>

<p>"A dream impression, the impression that you are quite a new,
another, man!"</p>

<p>Hartwell did not like this.</p>

<p>"Sit here," he said. "What is it that you want to ask me?"</p>

<p>"Just that: what has made you different?"</p>

<p>"In what sense different?"</p>

<p>"In yourself, in your very fibre, it sometimes seems to me,
almost. Why did I not like you well before? Tell me that."</p>

<p>"You do now?" he asked tenderly, turning a little toward her,
his left arm over the back of the bench behind her shoulders, his
right hand on the knob of his stick.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I seem to like you now, James," she answered;
"especially sometimes."</p>

<p>"When? I am interested, you see."</p>

<p>"When I am with you, then. When I am not, you are sometimes all
mixed&mdash;a mixture perhaps of two impressions&mdash;one recent,
one old. If the old predominates then I am cross, and if the new,
then I am pleased, and when I am with you, especially where it is
dark, like here, then there is the new alone, and I am quite
pleased." Julia smiled fondly, saying this.</p>

<p>Hartwell's hand made a movement to touch hers, but he drew it
back quickly, before there was any contact.</p>

<p>"The change which you say you note in me," he said, "may be
perfectly real, but only&mdash;a change&mdash;let us say, of mood,
which I hope will be life-long, since it pleases you. I would do,
and be, much to please you."</p>

<p>"Then I feel so honoured, James&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And to please me," he said quickly, cutting her short before
she could give expression to any more, "to please me, pray do not
let your mind recur to any of the rude impressions which I have
given you in the past, unless it be to prevent yourself from being
sorry for having thrown me over."</p>

<p>"But if I am genuinely sorry now."</p>

<p>"Don't be, don't!" he said fiercely. "I tell you that nothing
short of a dog-like shamelessness could ever have permitted me to
aspire to your hand, your rare hand, Julia. We were divided as the
Poles, and as much divides us still. But, being what I am, if I may
be permitted to call you friend and dear to the hour of my
death."</p>

<p>Julia now let her hand rest lightly upon his hand that was over
the knob of his stick, a touch in the dark which sent a current of
magnetism thrilling through Hartwell's frame, rather flustering his
self-control and the depth of his breathing. At the same time the
excellent Julia said frankly, in a low and intimate tone:</p>

<p>"What 'divides us still?' Nothing divides us. I am fond of you,
James."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hartwell, with greedy ears, forgetting everything in
his keenness to hear more of this good news; "in actual fact? to
what extent?"</p>

<p>Now gazing closely at her, he could see the delicate length of
her chin in profile, lit by a moonbeam which touched it, with the
firm contour of her lips, and the lower half of her nose, and his
eyes could just guess the violet glow of her eyes in the deeper
darkness higher up under the overarching wrap which covered her
head.</p>

<p>"To what extent?" she answered with a fond smile, while her eyes
rested pensively upon him. "Should I be the first to tell, because
it was I who wantonly threw you away? Forgive me for that. I was
merely senseless, I suppose. Shall I say to what extent, if I
could? To the extent, at least, I think, James, to which you are
fond of me."</p>

<p>"But that is to the very dust!" cried Hartwell aloud, with great
suddenness, in a sort of passionate protest; "with a burden under
which I must surely break&mdash;" He stopped short and his head
bowed down with a sound that resembled a sob.</p>

<p>Julia did not understand the full depth of Hartwell's emotion,
nor, of course, its cause. She had her own burden of emotion, which
fully occupied her. Her head was leant in a pensive attitude on her
hand, her bosom gently heaved, and her eyes were closed. The
admirable Julia took her passion seriously. With her eyes closed,
she murmured, just loudly enough for Hartwell to hear:</p>

<p>"I have found you. I love."</p>

<p>But something in that definite word "love" caused Hartwell to
rise suddenly from her side and take a backward step, seeing that
things had been allowed to go too far. His fingers lightly touched
his forehead. His lips were about to pronounce the word "No,'" but
he stopped to listen to what she was saying, for looking pensively
down on the floor of the summer-house, without apparently noticing
his getting up from her, she was speaking, rather to herself than
to him, saying:</p>

<p>"It is wonderfully tender, really; wonderfully deep and real and
lifelong. I never even dreamed what it was like before, James. I
don't suppose that most people even know. It comes mysteriously
from Heaven. Yes, I love you. I can only tell you that."</p>

<p>She now rose and laid her two hands on his shoulders, smiling
sweetly and looking into his eyes, as she continued to speak in a
soft voice, making her lover the confidant of her tender pains.</p>

<p>Several times Hartwell attempted to utter some word to cut the
scene short, but without uttering anything, but when she said,
"Yes, that is the accomplished fact; I love you&mdash;like a serf,"
his lips pronounce a sharp "No!"</p>

<p>"But I say yes." she answered smiling, thinking that his protest
had only reference to the meekness of the word serf&mdash;"like a
serf and like a mother, and like a woman, and like a daughter, and
like your oldest schoolboy friend. I couldn't say&mdash;But what is
the matter? Kiss me."</p>

<p>Hartwell's lips were pressed together with a certain vindictive
severity, his eyes were engorged with blood. He now bitterly blamed
himself for his self-indulgence in letting her speak in this way to
him, and bitterly he hated destiny for the harsh trick it had paid
him. His nose and his wrinkled underlids were pallid, his lips and
beard trembled with agitation. His arms opened slightly of
themselves for one embrace, but his hard will conquered this
impulse, and he turned quite roughly from her.</p>

<p>"I was in the wrong to let you give expression to all that," he
said hoarsely, rapidly: "there are innumerable reasons. I never
said that I love you."</p>

<p>"But what is the matter?" she cried, startled at last. "You
never said, but nothing else is so true."</p>

<p>Hartwell spun sharply round to her, pressed her with a groan to
his bosom, and for a minute their souls met and held converse the
one with the other where their lips were joined together. But even
as she hung upon his heart he placed her with perfunctory haste
upon the cushioned seat, and instantly was
gone&mdash;running&mdash;from her. And there where he had placed
her she sat for a long time, staring at the ground with her palm
under her chin. When she returned to the castle, she heard that
Hartwell had hurriedly departed for the station.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>XII. &mdash; HARTWELL RISES IN THE
NIGHT</h2>

<p class="first">Hartwell reached his home in Addison Road on the
evening of the day after Boxing Day, a very morose man. As he
opened the gate he heard the bayings of Bull the mastiff, but the
dog no sooner got to know who it was that was coming in, than with
his usual signs of horror he took himself off to the back. And
Hartwell's eye flashed with severity as he murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let this be the dog's last flight from me."</p>

<p>When he went in he said to the footman in the outer hall:</p>

<p>"I want Bull chained in his cot for the night." Then, with a
rather lower voice, with a certain stealthiness in it, he added,
"If anyone calls to see me before dinner, let me know at once, in
my bedroom."</p>

<p>In the inner hall he was met by Miss Scatchett and the
Frenchman, who had hurried from different directions to greet his
entrance.</p>

<p>"Sir," murmured the excellent Count, who had on a large black
tie and a limp shirt-front with small frills, "my compliments."</p>

<p>"Ah, Dulaunay, how do you do?" cried Hartwell with a fling of
the hand. "Well, you look hearty, my friend."</p>

<p>Without stopping for any talk, he went upstairs to his bedroom,
where he washed and was dressing, when the footman rapped at his
door with the announcement:</p>

<p>"One Robert Hartwell to see you, sir."</p>

<p>"Send&mdash;do not bring&mdash;him up," said Hartwell.</p>

<p>Hartwell threw on a dressing-gown, hastily seated himself in an
easy chair, and propped his brow on his thumb and forefinger,
looking the picture of meditative calm; but this look was assumed,
for the beat of his heart had quickened.</p>

<p>There came a knock at the door.</p>

<p>Hartwell, called "Come in" and a boy of fifteen entered.</p>

<p>He was cleanly dressed, but his trousers were too short by an
inch. His boots were heavy and rather worn out, his clothes were
all darned, he had on a plaid scarf and held a deerstalker cap in
his hand. He looked first agitated, then all at once, wild with
amazement.</p>

<p>"Father," he breathed.</p>

<p>It was this father that Hartwell had not wished the footman to
hear, and so had told him to send&mdash;not to bring&mdash;the boy
up.</p>

<p>"Kindly shut the door my young friend," said he.</p>

<p>The lad obeyed.</p>

<p>This lad was a perfect beauty, resembling his dead mother, and
not at all like Hartwell. He was rather small-built, with an oval
Madonna face, which was delicately flushed with a rosy colour, and
he had soft brown eyes and pretty lips. But he looked for the
moment simply silly in his boundless lack of comprehension at
finding his poor hard-working father in this mansion, served by a
footman and wrapped in the dressing gown of a king.</p>

<p>The father's eye rested upon him with a caressing smile in it,
and with this thought in his head&mdash;"Julia would love him."</p>

<p>"Father! you here?" breathed the lad again in a husky voice.</p>

<p>"Sit down on that chair, my friend," said Hartwell, "and permit
me at once to rid your mind of an error&mdash;an excusable one,
certainly, but still an error. I am not your father. Your father, I
regret to say&mdash;is dead."</p>

<p>The boy touched his brow with his hand. He looked as if he were
stunned by these words.</p>

<p>"You not my father, sir?" said he. "Oh, but father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am not your father. I know well that it must seem incredible
to you, but I am about to explain it to you. Your father is
dead."</p>

<p>"Father dead?" breathed the lad. "Is that the truth, sir?"</p>

<p>"The simple truth. Your father had a strong, a very strong
resemblance to me and hence your error. I was driving a motor-car
along the Norwich Road one dark night some three weeks since, when
your father, in the attempt to save me from running into a cart,
was himself killed. I am sure that you must have read of the
accident in the Sunday paper, though you would not know that the
news concerned you, since your father's name, which could not at
the time be discovered, did not appear. However, from a piece of
paper found in his pocket I have been able, with much difficulty,
to find out your address and so sent for you to come to me."</p>

<p>"And he's dead?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, my sir!" The lad fell into a chair, bowed down with
sobbing.</p>

<p>Hartwell got up out of his chair, went to him, and put his lips
on the boy's hair with a murmur of love.</p>

<p>"Don't cry," he murmured. "You have now a father far mightier
than you ever had, and just as fond."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, sir," sobbed the boy inconsolably, "but that
can't give back anybody's own father. There ain't ne'er another
like him&mdash;the cleverest workman&mdash;that poor, hungry
sometimes&mdash;and yet always that blooming decent to me&mdash;oh
my."</p>

<p>Hartwell, with a soft look in his eyes, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"No doubt, no doubt; but men&mdash;and boys, too&mdash;should
know how to check their emotions, and rise above their griefs. The
skull is higher than the chest, my friend. Let us therefore live in
our top-storey, and be men. Pull yourself together, and listen to
what I have now to say to you."</p>

<p>"But you talk just like father!" said the boy, lifting his wet
eyes with a look of bland astonishment&mdash;"the same notions,
too, about the skull and the chest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that really so?" asked Hartwell in a tone of surprise. "Then
your father must have been a man who had reflected, and I hope
taught you to reflect also. Dry your tears, and let us talk. I
have, first of all, a promise to exact from you and it is
this&mdash;that, since there are reasons why the resemblance
between your father and me should not even be suspected, you will
never, as long as you live, breathe a word of it to any
creature."</p>

<p>"Yes sir, I promise you, sir&mdash;Please sir, where's my father
buried?"</p>

<p>"Never mind your father now, I say. The dead are dead, boy, and
only the living are alive. He was buried at Aylsham, then&mdash;I
will tell you the fuller details another time, but think now of
yourself and of me. Promise again to keep the great secret of your
life."</p>

<p>"All right, sir, I promise."</p>

<p>"You will be like an eagle while you keep it and like an Icarus,
whose wings of wax the sun melts, when you fail."</p>

<p>"I shan't fail, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, I believe that, boy. You are to be trusted." The
dinner-gong began to sound. "I must dress, and you must go. Take
this £5-note&mdash;ah, ah, you aren't too used to them, I fear,
poor boy. I see that you have been getting some work on a
generating set at a machine-maker's within the last two
weeks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's true, sir. How can you see that, sir? My word, sir, you
and father are just like brothers!"</p>

<p>"Forget your father and love me, whose delight you are. Listen
to what you have to do now. When you go out from here, take a cab
to this little Holborn hotel"&mdash;Hartwell handed the boy a slip
of paper which he had ready in his pocket&mdash;"and live there for
the next week. Take also this letter which I have written for you,
and carry it to-morrow morning to its address in Saville Row, near
Regent Street, where the firm of tailors to whom it is addressed
will take care to provide you with a suitable wardrobe. In a week's
time, when you are dressed like a gentleman, you will come and live
with me here for a fortnight, after which you will start for Rugby,
where I have arranged for your residence with a house-master and in
two years you will begin your career as an engineer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the boy, all agaze in a fairy dream,
"but&mdash;I&mdash;want to be a poet, sir."</p>

<p>"Aha! I have heard that you are given to scribbling rhymes. But
you must abandon that mood, to please me. Now you must go. Come
first to my fatherly arms, and kiss me."</p>

<p>Hartwell embraced him and the lad went away in tears, with the
bank note, the slip, and the letter to the tailors. Hartwell then
descended to dinner, where he found Oswald talking to Dulaunay, for
Oswald, a confirmed diner-out, often looked in about dinner-time.
At table the talk was with the glib Count, who, liking Hartwell and
the haphazard prosperity of his situation here, stuck to it,
letting his tongue run loose on every subject under the sun, from
the Quartier Latin to Italian literature, and from Anarchism to
<i>le boxe</i>, <i>le sport</i>, and <i>le fun</i>.</p>

<p>At this time Hartwell was actually paying Dulaunay a salary of
£500 a year, for one morning the excellent count, having complained
of a shortness of funds, if not exactly to Hartwell, at least in
Hartwell's hearing.</p>

<p>Hartwell had said in words of a vague and, doubtful meaning:
"Mention to me afresh, Dulaunay, the sum which I pay you as salary,
these things easily slip the memory." For Hartwell had now a
suspicion that Dulaunay's relation to him was in some way bogus.
Many little things and words had tended to show it to his active
perceptions, but he had rather shut his eyes to them, refraining
from probing the mystery, for the simple reason that he found the
versatile count agreeable, and chose to remain in a half-darkness
as to the reason of his presence in the household, to accept him as
an accomplished fact, and to leave matters as they were.</p>

<p>One morning he had seen Dulaunay busied in the book-room,
another morning he had seen him before an easel painting landscapes
and each time he had made the count's occupation an excuse for not
prying too closely into his right to be there, thinking in the one
case that he may have been a sort of do-nothing librarian to
Drayton, and in the other, that he may have been Drayton's protege,
on account of his promising talents as an artist&mdash;both of
which were highly improbable.</p>

<p>Hartwell went out regularly to the city before noon, and as to
how the Frenchman passed his days he had no idea, and cared
nothing. In the evenings they met and neither referred to anything
farther back in the past than the night of their meeting at
Liverpool Street-Station. Once only Hartwell had found it necessary
to remonstrate pleasantly with Dulaunay on receiving a hint from
Miss Scatchett of a certain absence of mind in some of the
servants, due to the gallant and excellent count, but otherwise
their relation flowed quietly along like a gentle stream. If Miss
Scatchett, or Oswald, or anyone had once happened to say to
Hartwell: "Who or what is this French count? we did not know him
till lately," Hartwell, no doubt, would have been stirred, to find
out the truth of things. But though Miss Scatchett or Oswald may
have asked themselves why the count was there, their vague interest
never chanced to lead them to ask Hartwell anything about him,
while Hartwell was willing to believe that the count was an
institution in the house, and the count, for his part, within some
days after his first drive to Addison Road, in Hartwell's brougham,
looked upon Hartwell and all he had as his by an ancient right.</p>

<p>After dinner that evening of young Bobbie Hartwell's visit to
the house, the count departed in the brougham for the theatre,
while Hartwell and Oswald smoked together in the billiard-room and
each interview between the supposed brothers tended to increase the
antipathy between them. When Oswald left it was getting late, and
Hartwell went up to bed. But he lay without being able to sleep,
watching the little ray of a night-light on the dressing-table. He
heard the shutting up of the house, and also the wheels of the
carriage on the drive, returning with Dulaunay. Hartwell's nights
were wretched: firstly, because sleep was hard to get, and
secondly, because it was so gruesome when it came. Things now
happened to him in dreams&mdash;woods, scenes, terrors, with that
face which might be either his own or another's, such as he could
not have fancied. It even happened to him anon to be shocked by the
doubt of the average credulous man: "How, if in heaven and earth
there be, after all, more things than atoms, ether and energy? or
how if the atoms be very different, far more ghostly things, than
one dreams."</p>

<p>This was a strange doubt to trouble such a mind as Hartwell's.
When his clock struck two, his eyes flashed severely, and he rose,
lit a candle, threw on a splendid gold-wrought dressing-gown and
put on a pair of slippers. He then took a revolver from a case,
descended to the back, quietly undid a door, and went out into the
grounds, which were fairly extensive and rich in vegetation. He
walked in the direction of the stable and, in doing this, passed
near the dog's cot in an alley, where, by his order Bull was
chained up that night. The dog whined on seeing him, but Hartwell
did not even glance at it. His face was stern. He had determined
that the dog should no more fly from him. He went to an outhouse
which stood near the stable, his feet now soaked with the wet in
the grasses, and there he found a spade and crowbar, which he took
and with them he went on to the far end of the grounds. There,
choosing a spot under a holly tree, he set to work to dig a grave
two feet deep by the dim light of a moon struggling to shine in a
grey and cloudy sky.</p>

<p>This done, he straightened himself, put his arms akimbo, and
looked up a little while to where the blotch of moonlight was. He
then returned to the kennel, undid the chain, and led the dog
towards the grave. Bull followed him with uplifted eyes, showing
more of the whites than of the brown part, an expression of weak
abashment. Hartwell tied the dog to the holly-tree, stepped back a
little, the revolver in his hand and, stooping far forward, held
the weapon to the dog's ear. The deg sidled a little round the
tree, whining pitifully, but as the dog moved so Hartwell,
stooping, followed step by step. "Now, Bull," he said again, and
the report sounded. The dog yelped and dropped dead. This was a
sort of murder, for in Hartwell's scientific creed the dog is a
very near first cousin to man and Hartwell's consciousness of truth
was so keen that this was not a mere sterile bit of knowledge to
him, but one of the big, living facts of life, ever present in his
mind.</p>

<p>He buried the poor Bull with grim lips, and returned to bed and
as he lay abed again, thinking of Julia and of his son, into these
thoughts there intruded a thought of Gissing, his lonely cold
prisoner in Hobham House, whom he had to see on the morrow.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>XIII. &mdash; MORE ABOUT
LETTY</h2>

<p class="first">The sudden departure of Gissing from the old Manor
farm came as a disappointment to Oswald. He actually had on his
overcoat and gloves, one afternoon at his chambers, about to go to
Norfolk to see Gissing, when he received from Walker his shorthand
man, the telegram:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">"FIND THAT GISSING TEMPORARILY GONE AWAY. WILL
WIRE AGAIN WHEN HE RETURNS;"</p>

<p class="first">so that Magee had to take off Oswald's coat
again.</p>

<p>Oswald received this telegram two days before Christmas. He
ought to have gone down to Norfolk at least forty-eight hours
before and now blamed himself for his slow habit of turning round,
but there had been social engagements. One could not throw
everything to the devil at a moment's notice. He sighed and waited
till Gissing should return home and would have lifted his eyebrows
in lingering surprise, if he had been told that Gissing was in a
locked room in Hobham House.</p>

<p>When Oswald received that telegram from Walker, Hartwell was
already at Castle Moran, fox-hunting with the admirable Julia. It
has been seen how he fled from her, when she told him that she
loved him and how, after lingering a day at an inn in the country,
he returned to Addison Road on the second evening after Christmas
and saw his son, Bobby, and killed the dog, Bull, the same
night.</p>

<p>The next day Hartwell was at the office in Fenchurch Street,
from noon till the closing of the house. During that time he took a
second saloon ticket on a P. and O. boat, which was to sail for the
East in three days' time, on the Thursday, the 31st of December,
"old-year's-day." After the closing of the house he put on his
overcoat and put into a pocket of it some sheets of paper and
envelopes, a pen and a bottle of ink, together with some other
sheets of paper which were covered with his own writing. He went
out, and outside bought an ounce of tobacco and a pipe, which he
also put into his pocket. He then went to Gannon Street, and took a
train for Lydney, the station nearest to Hobham House. At Lydney he
bought a loaf, a bottle of claret, and a candle and with these
things he walked to Hobham House, unlocked the front door and went
in. When he had gone up, unlocked the door of the room in which
Gissing was, and entered it, he lit the candle and stuck it in its
own grease on the mantelpiece, and now he saw Gissing crouching in
a corner near the mantelpiece with a certain glower-underlook at
him.</p>

<p>"Well, Gissing," said Hartwell, "I suppose that you have not had
four very enjoyable days and I suppose, too, that like a foolish
man, you blame me for your discomfort. But it is not my fault, nor
is it yours, but the fault of an evil chance which caused you to
know more about my affairs than is good for your comfort. I wish
you no ill, and only locked you up with little food and no fire in
order that you may fully realise my power over you and the more
readily follow my instructions."</p>

<p>The countryman's mouth worked in the effort to find expression
for what he felt, but in the end all that came out was:</p>

<p>"Ah, you're a wicked one, you!"</p>

<p>Hartwell made no reply, but proceeded to lay on the mantelpiece
three half-sheets of paper covered with something written by
himself, while Gissing cried out:</p>

<p>"Good Lord on High, mister, why have you done the likes o' this
here to a poor man?"</p>

<p>"Gissing," answered Hartwell, "I have already apologised for the
discomfort to which an evil chance has forced me to subject you.
Unfortunately, still worse things await you, but let no one be
blamed. The cat eats the mouse, the mayfly is torn by the swallow,
the sparrow is speared by the shrike, the man kills the microbe,
the lamb the lion, the German kills the Frenchman, the Englishman
the Hindoo. Nor can we alter this necessary condition of life on
our planet by regretting it. The weaker suffer for the
stronger&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again Gissing looked at Hartwell with his mouth working to find
expression, but the power of expressing his thoughts and feelings
was not the strong point of Gissing, or of any of his class and
kind, and in the end all that came was:</p>

<p>"Ey, he's a hard man to deal with!"</p>

<p>"But let us not waste words, Gissing," Hartwell went on. "I have
first of all to tell you that on Thursday coming, only three days
from now, you will be placed in complete liberty by me on board a
ship, on which your passage is already taken. You will start
without funds, though with a trunk of clothes, but on your arrival
at Hong Kong a correspondent of my firm will offer you permanent
employment in his warehouse. You will never return to England, even
if you can ever find the means to do so, nor will you ever write to
anyone in England, for in this case, if I discover it I shall
simply place in the hands of the police a confession which you are
now about to write of having attempted to extort blackmail from me
on a false charge, whereupon you will be arrested in your new
abode. No, say nothing, my friend, but submit yourself to me, or
your discomforts will be stretched perhaps to the point of death.
See here, I have brought you some bread, some wine, and some
tobacco, pleasures which can only be enjoyed by you on condition of
submission&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ey he's a hard man!" groaned the ill-fated countryman, with a
hoarse chest, "he don't call to mind that I've got a wife and
daughter."</p>

<p>"I have not forgotten them," replied Hartwell: "I am a hard man,
yes, but by no means a wicked one. Your wife and daughter shall be
my care, Gissing, and your wisest course will be to cast their
existence out of your memory as soon as ever Nature will permit
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My own wife and daughter! Cast them out o' my&mdash;! Ah, you,
you, you, you!"</p>

<p>"You think me a monster, I see, Gissing, but that is not because
I am a monster, but because I am somewhat more rational than you. I
know the feelings of a father, and I know well the feelings of a
husband, and I experience a human sympathy with your case. But all
things must yield to the iron laws of Necessity and on the whole
your dependents will do very well. But now to business, my friend.
Here are two letters to your wife which I have written and require
you to copy out now. I will first of all read them aloud to you.
The first one says:</p>

<p class="letter">"'My dear wife, here am I in Birmingham where I
had to come from London on the business that I came up to London
about. But not much can be done without the evidence of our Sarah
and perhaps yours too. So I want you to send Sarah at once to me at
117, Duke Street, Moseley, Birmingham, and I send you enclosed 17/-
in postal orders to give her for the journey&mdash;but do not give
her any more than 17/-. Perhaps in a day or two I may have to write
you again to come to me and her in London, where I am going back to
from here. Your affectionate husband&mdash;'</p>

<p>"That is the first, Gissing; and the second says:</p>

<p class="letter">"'My dear wife, I and Sarah met all right here at
Birmingham, and now we are just starting back for London.
Everything is going first rate, but I want you now to shut up the
house and come to meet us at once at 112, Chapel Street, S.
Kensington, London, for which I enclose £1. Then we shall all go
home together. Unless you come, we shan't get the £2,000, so be
sure to come. Your affectionate husband&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Such is the second letter, Gissing; and this third paper is the
confession of blackmail and false accusation, which you will also
copy out."</p>

<p>"Then, my home will be broken up?" cried the suffering
countryman.</p>

<p>"I, in God knows where, my wife in London, my daughter in
Birmingham without a penny-piece to bless themselves&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Neither they nor you shall starve, Gissing, that I undertake.
It is true that there is no such house as 117, Duke Street,
Moseley, Birmingham, nor any such house as 112, Chapel Street, S.
Kensington, but there is a Duke Street, and a Chapel Street, and in
them the two women shall be met by my agents and suitable
employment shall be found for them. You will all, indeed, be lost
to one another, and to those also who wish to use you for my
hurt."</p>

<p>At this point the old man sprang upright from his cowering
position, crying out:</p>

<p>"Look here, I&mdash;I wouldn't do that thing, not to save my
life!"</p>

<p>Hartwell's eyes flashed at this. He said not another word, but
with pressed lips, caught up the "pleasures"&mdash;the bread, wine,
and tobacco&mdash;and went out, leaving the pen and ink, the blank
sheets of paper, the letters to be copied, and the candle and
matches. As to the last two, he had little fear that Gissing's
sufferings would tempt him to burn down the house, for in that case
the room where Gissing was was in such a position would burn and he
would certainly be burned to death.</p>

<p>Those sufferings of Gissing, however, must have been great and
might have tempted him to do almost anything. For four days he had
eaten nothing but two tins of potted ham, with two bottles of
claret. It continued, moreover, to be cold and now he would have to
wait at least one other day. With a fine English stoicism, the old
man had said not a word about what he suffered, but his frame knew
its own pains. As Hartwell walked out bearing off the "pleasures,"
Gissing, shivering with his two hands in his pockets, gazed after
him with a glowering underlook, and uttered the groan, "Ey, he's a
cold-hearted man."</p>

<p>Hartwell locked the door on the outside, put the pleasures on
the floor, and went away.</p>

<p>When he reached home that night he again found Oswald there.
They dined together, and after dinner found themselves alone in the
billiard room, for Dulaunay was in the drawing-room, playing pieces
from Chopin. For a long time little was said between the supposed
brothers. Oswald listlessly threw the billiard balls about the
table, Hartwell lay on a couch meditating on the wreaths of smoke
from his cigar. Then suddenly, after half an hour, it came out that
Oswald had pressing need of £200 and Hartwell, tossing the cigar
end into the fire, said:</p>

<p>"My good fellow, I won't give it you."</p>

<p>Oswald's square jaws stiffened themselves at his bitter
feelings, he left the table and, standing before the fire, turned
an evil look upon Hartwell, who was now, he felt, in his hands.
Gissing, indeed, had gone from home&mdash;so Walker had
telegraphed. But Oswald was only waiting for Gissing's return to
run down to Norfolk and get Gissing's written evidence that his
brother and Letty Barnes had known each other (the desired £200 was
partly to tip Gissing with), after which, there would be no more
refusals of £200. And, exulting in his power, never dreaming that
Gissing lay a prisoner in Hobham House, he said sourly to
Hartwell:</p>

<p>"My good James, I fear that you are growing mean, but let me
explain to you why I really need this two hundred. A girl in whom I
am interested has been murdered, James. Her father is impecunious
the police at a loss, and I have taken up the case, employing a
private agent to get at the bottom of it."</p>

<p>"Who was she?" asked Hartwell.</p>

<p>"A girl named Letty Barton," answered Oswald, his habit of
sycophancy even now restraining his lips from venturing upon the
open defiance of saying "Letty Barnes." For though they had opened
to say Barnes they ended by saying Barton: a very inconsistent, but
natural thing, for he wished to let "James" know that he knew all,
but in the midst of obeying his impulses, he was checked by a
qualm, by a feeling of his rashness, and modified it by saying the
illogical "Barton." However, if he had said "Letty Barnes," this
name would have had no effect whatever upon Hartwell, from whose
memory it had passed ever since that day when he saw her father a
moment in the "Black Dogs" at Aylsham. The shreds of Letty's letter
to Julia lay forgotten in McCalmont's overcoat pocket, which was
now hung up in Hartwell's wardrobe. Hartwell had never fitted them
together, had never read in the newspapers of the finding of
Letty's body, did not know that she was dead, or remember that she
had lived, or have any reason to think that Drayton had known such
a girl. When, therefore, Oswald, saying "Letty Barton," looked to
see Hartwell flinch, he saw only indifference, and thought to
himself: "James can command his face."</p>

<p>"Who was this Letty Barton?" asked Hartwell.</p>

<p>"I need only say that I had an interest in her and mean to
avenge her. It was a disgusting atrocity, this murder."</p>

<p>"By whom committed?"</p>

<p>"A lover. You have seen it in the papers."</p>

<p>"I don't remember. It is known then, that she had a lover? Well,
the post mortem, of course. Tell me the circumstances and let us
see what light a detached reason may throw up on them."</p>

<p>"I suppose I never knew him well," thought Oswald, "he is a
deeper man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," he said aloud, "I need not go into it, you
have read it all."</p>

<p>"But if I say not? Tell me."</p>

<p>"Oh well then, she was found in a gut behind an old tavern, two
days after her death. She had been strangled, her hand was bruised,
most of her finger-nails were broken, her collar was rumpled
behind, while one of its button holes was torn through in front,
her face was swollen, round one wrist was a red mark, in her pocket
were a thimble, a hymn-book, and a little powder-puff&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hartwell, with his thumb and forefinger pressing down his closed
eyelids, and frowning deeply, said:</p>

<p>"Well, now, let me see: there was a struggle for a letter."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" Oswald started, thinking within himself: "That, then,
was the letter of which I have a shred! but this motive for
telling? His bluff!" He added aloud: "That is quite probably true,
my good James, but your certainty is curious."</p>

<p>"Why so? It seems pretty clear to me. Did you see the body
yourself, by the way?"</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"You said in describing her appearance that 'her hand' was
bruised: does that mean one hand only?"</p>

<p>"I really can't say now."</p>

<p>"Then it was probably both hands, for one only would very likely
have resulted in a more definite observation on your part. But how
do you account for these bruises on her hands?"</p>

<p>"She was thrown over a cliff through a lot of prickles and bush:
that, I suppose, might account for her scratches and things."</p>

<p>"Ah, but now you use another word, not 'bruises,' but 'scratches
and things.' Was her face, then, bruised like her hands?"</p>

<p>"No, I think not. It was scratched&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then the hand-bruises had a different origin from the
face-scratches; were true bruises, caused by a struggle for some
object, a ring, a letter, a coin, or something; and the mauling of
both hands seems to prove that the struggle was spirited and
prolonged, the object having been slipped to the left hand, when
the right became sore."</p>

<p>"James, you are amazing," said Oswald, with a breath of
laughter: "but admit, my good fellow, that your certainty that the
object of the struggle was a letter is curious."</p>

<p>"Why so? How else can you explain the bruises, the broken nails,
and the hymn book?"</p>

<p>"I confess that I do not see your point."</p>

<p>"The bruises rather seem to prove, don't they? that the object
was not a large object, like a stick, for instance. It was
containable in the hand; and since most of her nails were broken,
that certainly proves that the object was not a small one like a
ring, for instance; for her fingers could not quite close upon the
object. That seems to give us the size of the object, the size of a
letter crumpled into a ball. It may therefore have been a letter,
and the hymn book strongly suggests that it was a letter, for why
the hymn book except to hold a letter uncrumpled between the leaves
in her pocket? She had placed the letter in the hymn book on
writing it, meaning to show it to him, and when the time came she
took the hymn book and all. But observe that this gives you the
motive of the crime, if you do not already know it. For if I am
right we have the fact of a letter written by her for which there
was a struggle, and the natural inference is that it was a letter,
say, to some new flame of his, containing damaging
statements&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He has now told me enough to hang him!" thought Oswald, "given
Gissing's evidence that he knew Letty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As to the powder puff&mdash;" began Hartwell, but before he
could get farther he was interrupted by a footman who looked in to
announce some visitors; and Hartwell stood up, saying to Oswald:
"Well, jot down all the facts of the matter, Oswald, and we will
confer on them some other night. Such things furnish interesting
exercises for the reason. As for the £200, you shall have them for
this specific purpose of punishing an ugly crime, and I will send
you the cheque to-morrow. But I warn you, my good fellow, that my
brotherly affection has its limits and that you will have to rely
upon your own resources to a far greater extent than heretofore. I
have had losses."</p>

<p>Oswald looked at him with eyes of mere wonder, having given up
all hope of the £200 when he had once dared to mention that
name&mdash;Letty Barton.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>XIV. &mdash; HARTWELL UPROOTS</h2>

<p class="first">The next evening, as Hartwell went out from his
office to return to Gissing, he saw in the street, near the outer
door of the building in which his office was, a man with very heavy
eyes, a deep frown, and a red fan-beard. It was Barnes, the father
of Letty.</p>

<p>Hartwell peered searchingly at him, at the same time making
haste to shut himself in his brougham, which was there awaiting
him, and he thought to himself, "I have seen him before&mdash;but
where? He was waiting there to see me come out. The there-he-is of
his expression&mdash;. And the man means me no good, his mind in a
state of unworldly distraction or despair. The feather in his
beard, the old mud on his boots, his wrinkled waistcoat, the rent
in his coat pocket, perhaps drinking, yet hardly a drunkard, and
the bulge in his pocket angular, perhaps a revolver. But let us not
permit ourselves to be shot. Such a weakness would be too
immoral."</p>

<p>He drove from Cannon Street to the little Surrey Station of
Lydney alone in his compartment and still he kept on musing on
Barnes, thinking: "He is a countryman, not of the lowest class, his
rings, his chain, but not a farmer. Apparently rather a tradesman.
No trace of the use of leggings on the trousers, and trousers gone
at the knees, not at the bottoms. Yet a great shot, high aim,
too&mdash;pheasants, 'rocketers,'&mdash;say therefore from Suffolk,
Norfolk, the nap on right shoulder, cock of left leg, turpentine
stains, muscles of neck. But a tradesman and a sportsman, too?
Hardly&mdash;then, perhaps, a town tradesman; rather one in open
country, near coverts, yet not a farmer. A lonely publican,
tavern-keeper&mdash;lurking in Fenchurch Street! What, then, has
that ruffian done to this poor man? He's probably in London only to
see and hurt me&mdash; You should be careful, however, of yourself,
mine host."</p>

<p>From Lydney he walked to Hobham House, and up to Gissing's
prison. This time, on seeing Gissing, Hartwell's heart was moved to
pity. The countryman, roused by the entrance of Hartwell from
morbid sleep, still sat without a word or motion in his corner,
hugging his tremors, with a glint like lunacy in the downward stare
of his eyes. He had copied the confession of blackmail&mdash;there
it lay on the mantelpiece&mdash;but he had not copied either of the
letters to his wife. And again Hartwell, seeing this, was adamant,
saying:</p>

<p>"See, I have brought you some ham, Gissing. But do as I bid you
or I cannot permit myself to alleviate your discomforts."</p>

<p>"Merciful Lord, man!" cried the countryman suddenly, "won't you
give a man a morsel o' food, then?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Don't ye believe in a just God above, then, man, man, in God's
name?"</p>

<p>"Above, eh?" said Hartwell, sitting on a cloud, no doubt, as on
a cushion, in the Turkish manner. "No, Gissing! She in whom I
believe exists and is mighty, but He in whom you believe is thin
and dying."</p>

<p>"Ey, he's a strange man!" wailed the countryman in muffled words
with a covered face.</p>

<p>Hartwell now paced the room with his hands behind his back, and
during the time while he twice passed from end to end of the floor
Gissing leapt up furiously, took the pen in his hand, and began to
copy one of the letters by the light of the candle. Hartwell went
and looked over his shoulder, but after the old man had written
five or six words Hartwell said:</p>

<p>"You are too cold; you cannot write now, Gissing. Promise me
that if I alleviate your discomforts you will do all that I
require."</p>

<p>"Merciful Lord on High, can I help promising?" exclaimed
Gissing, "Ain't I but mortal."</p>

<p>"That's a man," said Hartwell.</p>

<p>He at once took the candle, went out, and descending to the
basement found there a chopper and some sticks of firewood. A few
of the rooms here and there in the house remained scantily
furnished, and on his way back to the top Hartwell took with him
two chairs which, on re-entering the prison room he set to work to
hew to pieces. Gissing looked silently at him under lowering brows
while he did this. When the work grew hot, Hartwell threw off his
overcoat, and continued to hew at the two chairs, till both were in
fragments.</p>

<p>"Now, then, Gissing, for a fire," he said with merry eyes, a
little short of breath, with his arms akimbo, "and let it never
more be said that I am an egoist."</p>

<p>The enfeebled countryman dropped his head upon his arms over the
mantelpiece and two tears flowed down his rude face, while Hartwell
stooped at the grate.</p>

<p>"Now, Gissing, for a feast," said. Hartwell rising, when this
was done. "Take also this coat of mine, which I will leave with you
simply and solely because I do not myself feel cold, and let it
serve you for blanket or pillow. When you have regaled yourself,
then write the two letters, not forgetting the addresses on the
envelopes. To-morrow at noon I come to take you to your ship, on
which a trunk of clothes is already shipped for you. Good
night."</p>

<p>The countryman gazed after him as he walked out, not as after a
man, but as after a force that could speak and look like a man.</p>

<p>However, the legacy of troubles which Drayton had left to
Hartwell were rather like the hundred-headed hydra, and for every
head that he cut down another sprang up. That very evening, for
instance, when Gissing was at last forced to consent to write the
letters to his wife, Hartwell had a startling adventure. He had
come from Lydney to Shepherd's Bush, and was walking the short
distance from the station to his house, when, as he came to the
north corner of Addison Road he saw a woman standing on the east
pavement. It was rather dark there, but at once he noticed that she
was interested in him, was looking hard at him. She was quite a
giantess in size. Her age was perhaps 40, she had the look of a
countrywoman, was poorly but decently dressed, her face very round
and fat, and covered all over with large freckles.</p>

<p>He wished to examine her more closely, and was about to pass
near her when all of a sudden he shied sharply, and took to his
heels as fast as he could run to the other (west) side of the road.
Nor when he had reached that pavement did he stop, but pelted down
on the road with some anxious, backward glances over his shoulder,
till he slipped through someone's garden gate, and crouching there
behind the wall in the deep shadow thrown by a mass of leafage, he
peeped through the railings to see if she was coming. But she had
not apparently followed. Not a soul was to be seen in the deep and
lonely road and presently with a murmur of "Ah," and a smile he
crept out and went hurriedly across to his own gate, which was on
the east side of the road.</p>

<p>When, on his entrance into the house, Dulaunay said to him:
"Sir, my compliments," Hartwell made the reply: "They are
well-timed, my friend," for he knew that a knife lay in the woman's
bosom, and that her eyes were very strange and deranged. "I shall
assuredly see her again," he thought. "The sins of that man spring
up and multiply about me, and their harvest is great, and the
labourer but one."</p>

<p>The next day was Gissing's day of departure. Near noon Hartwell
drove to the beginning of the Avenue before Hobham House, stopped
the brougham there, alighted, walked to the house and returned to
the brougham with Gissing dressed in the fur overcoat of Hartwell's
which Hartwell had left for the countryman's blanket the previous'
evening. Gissing looked the picture of despair, and was
non-resistant as a lamb. Hartwell now had the confession of
blackmail and the two letters duly written by Gissing to his wife.
They drove to a wharf in Chelsea, where a small steam-boat awaited
them and they steamed down the river to Tilbury, where the great
ship had just received her passengers from the company's special
train. Hartwell gave the countryman a letter to one Bathright, who
lived at Hong Kong, impressed upon him anew the line of his future
conduct, and the ship moved down the river as Gissing was taken on
board.</p>

<p>The next morning Gissing's wife received the first letter, in
which her husband instructed her to send her daughter to meet him
in Birmingham. And this she did. Two days afterwards she received
the second letter, instructing her to start at once to meet her
husband and daughter in London. And this also she did. Both mother
and daughter were received by agents of Hartwell, the one in
Birmingham, the other in London.</p>

<p>Later on, when the mother wrote to 117 Duke Street, Moseley,
Birmingham, her letter came back to her, for there was no such
address. When the daughter wrote to Overstrand, her letter, too,
came back to her, for Hartwell had bought the Old Manor Farm from
its owner and had shut it up. He gave their little furniture to the
mother.</p>

<p>In the course of months both mother and girl found with some
difficulty an opportunity to leave their work for a day and return
to Overstrand, in some vague hope of retracing a clue of their
past. But they returned at different times, and found that past all
scattered to the winds. Mystery and desolation confronted them. The
yard was encumbered with leaves, weeds, and grasses, stranger-ducks
swam in the green slime of the pond, stranger-fowls scratched the
marrow-plot, house martens built all round the eaves, the white owl
haunted the lattices, poppy and yellow wild tulip choked the
garden. They saw the old home lie like the face of the dead and
shed tears at the ways of God.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>XV. &mdash; HARTWELL IS
EGOISTIC</h2>

<p class="first"><i>"My very dear,"</i> Julia wrote to Hartwell on
the very day of Gissing's departure to the East, <i>"is an
explanation due to me, or not? You should come to me. I am here in
Brook Street. Come, for I have waited, and am
waiting.&mdash;Julia."</i></p>

<p>That morning Hartwell did not go to the city, though he was now
in the thick of tearing himself out of the coils of Drayton's
business, but spent the forenoon in his study at Addison Road with
the little packet of letters which Julia had written to Drayton,
which he had found in the drawer of a wardrobe. There was hardly a
word-of fondness in any of them, but his eyes loved to smile upon
her large writing, whose dash and decision, like cavalry assaulting
a position, seemed to say: "There, that's Julia." Finally, a visit
on business from the captain of the <i>Sempronia</i> caused him to
lock the jacket away, and then he had to drive to Hobham House to
get Gissing on his ship.</p>

<p>But a week passed after this and still Hartwell did not answer
Julia's note. He was at a loss what to answer. The question whether
he should go to her or not go, and if he went what he should say to
her, was so distracting that there were moments when he almost
wished that those of his enemies who wanted to take his life might
succeed in doing what they wanted.</p>

<p>His existence all round was infested with doubts and dangers. If
Julia was by far the biggest of them, there were others very grave
and pressing. There was the big woman with the clasped knife and
the deranged eye. Who was she? Hartwell only knew that his death
was her mania&mdash;that, like some "Charlotte Corday" she had come
up from the country on a mission of death, and that he was her
Marat. There, lurking under the shadow of trees, he caught a
glimpse of her regularly every night as the brougham swept from
Holland Park into Addison Road. She did not apparently know his
house, for twice she had started after the carriage, presumably to
discover the gate into which it went, but must have lost sight of
it before it entered the gate, those being the darkest nightfalls
of the year. This woman's name was Mary Liskeard. Her daughter,
Margaret, had drowned herself in a lake called Harrod's, owing to
melancholia caused by her husband's drowning, which drowning again
was owing to some infamy of Drayton's in connection with an
unseaworthy ship.</p>

<p>And there was the man with the frown and the red beard, and the
heavy eyes. Barnes, too, had brooded and had his mania, and meant
to do a deed. The evil seed sown in the mind of Barnes by Oswald,
that day of the finding of Letty's body, was now grown to a mustard
tree and the careless disdain with which the police had received
his conviction that Drayton killed Letty had only the more
embittered and fixed Barnes' mania.</p>

<p>Hartwell always now left his office, not by the front door of
the building, but by way of a court behind, for regularly each
evening from about the hour of the closing of the house till six
o'clock he could see Barnes from a window of the office, standing
sentry below.</p>

<p>And again there was the little stableman, Kirk. Kirk had
apparently been bribed by Drayton to cut the tendon of a rival's
horse called Brighteye, and Kirk now pretended that the plot was
known to another turf-man named Teddy, to silence whom a further
£2000 was necessary. Hartwell saw that if he did not give, his good
name would be ruined, but it was not Hartwell's way to give. Apart
from the fact that he knew that Teddy was a myth&mdash;for the
jockey's mind was clear as crystal to him&mdash;he considered that
to give was immoral. But he did not refuse outright, he temporised,
dallied, and discussed, thinking how to uproot this Kirk and
meanwhile Kirk had grown pressing.</p>

<p>To permit himself to be shot or hurt Hartwell considered
immoral. He looked after No. 1, not because he particularly loved
No. 1, but because that was the only sensible thing to do, the
world being what he thought it was. Therefore, he meant to put
"egoism," which was his morality, into practice, and so it happened
that Barnes, Mary Liskeard, Kirk, the turf-man, and others were in
even more danger from him than he was from them.</p>

<p>A week after Julia's unanswered note, in which she prayed
Hartwell to go to her, it happened that Hartwell, in going to lunch
over a conference with three financiers at the Holborn Restaurant,
was taken down a by-street near the restaurant by his head clerk,
who was going to lunch with him, to be shown a house of his which
was falling to pieces. The house was No. 7 Twyford Buildings, a
queer old house in a slum just to the south of Holborn. The upper
part of it was clinker-built, the lower half was all patched with
rough boardings; the windows were low and long, like the house
itself; the window-panes all broken, and thicker than themselves
with grime. The one door, which stood at one end of the house, was
secured with a padlock.</p>

<p>When Hartwell was taken into it by his head clerk that day, he
looked into every room with a particular interest, though it was
empty but for a few corn-bags. (It had been used as a warehouse).
He and his head clerk then went on to lunch. After the lunch, when
they drove back to Fenchurch Street, there was Kirk awaiting
Hartwell in the office, looking a mere spider in a stiff
sack-overcoat, with a little mouse-face peeping out from under a
Homburg hat and, without any invitation, he followed Hartwell into
Hartwell's private room.</p>

<p>"Well, now," said Hartwell, when they were seated, "but I
thought I hinted to you that it would be better not to show
yourself here so often."</p>

<p>"Look here, that's as it may be," answered Kirk.</p>

<p>"Take your hat off."</p>

<p>"Shan't. That be blowed!" went Kirk vehemently. "I'm as good a
man as you, Drayton, any day."</p>

<p>"But you try my patience, Kirk," said Hartwell, with
reproach.</p>

<p>"Don't matter about patience," muttered the estimable Kirk. "Try
his little patience, poor little boy! Look here, where's the use
beating about the bush between men of the world? Going to brass up
to-day yes or no? Else Teddy'll only act, and where'll you be then?
Lord! I think I see your face at the Club of Tats.&mdash;great
Scott!"</p>

<p>"I'll pay," said Hartwell, "I'll pay. But I mustn't give myself
away&mdash;not by cheque, not here. Meet me. Do you happen to know
Twyford Buildings? It is an alley off Great Queen Street. Meet me
at No. 7&mdash;an old wooden house&mdash;at 7.30 to-morrow evening.
But be punctual. I shan't wait for you one second if you are not
there when I go. The house will be open, but do not enter the house
till you see me coming down the alley. Then very quickly enter and
wait. There is a caretaker about the place, who must by no means
see us meeting. I can't have myself compromised. We will then go
upstairs to a lighted room, that you may count the money, and write
me a receipt. But so that there may be but one footfall as we go
up, be prepared as I enter to mount upon my back."</p>

<p>"Now you're talking," answered Kirk. "I'll be there. Look here,
there's not an atom of bad blood, Drayton, on my side&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's a man. Good-bye. No. 7 Twyford Buildings, at 7.30 p.m.,
tomorrow."</p>

<p>Kirk then went away. The moment he was gone Hartwell peeped
cautiously into the street to see if Barnes was there. Barnes was
not there yet, but after having three interviews with a broker, an
actuary, and the steward of his Buck's estate, Hartwell again
peeped out, and there was Barnes standing sentry below.</p>

<p>"Ah," thought Hartwell within himself, "I hardly think that my
enemies will save me from that hard interview with her after all."
And, sitting now to his desk, he wrote, no longer with the
typewriter, but in a hand that was already, after much practice,
very like the dead Drayton's:&mdash;</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"My Dear Julia,</p>

<p class="letter">"I have received your note. I hope to call upon
you in Brook Street to-morrow evening at 9. If I do not hear from
you, I shall assume that I shall then be able to speak with you
alone.</p>

<p class="letter">"Your sincere friend,</p>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">James Drayton</span>."</p>
<br>

<p>The letter written and enclosed, he thrice pressed an electric
button, and the clerk who had to answer to three rings entered.</p>

<p>"Post this letter for me, Ife," said Hartwell. "I want you, Ife,
to do something for me with some little tact. There is a man with a
red beard standing near the street door, whom you might ask the way
to somewhere. Then ask if he is not Norfolk or Suffolk, and whether
he can tell you anything of the pheasant-shooting, as you think of
taking a holiday down there. Try to get him to have a drink with
you. Be unconcerned and affable. Then mention casually that you
belong to Drayton's, and that the boss means to be off to-morrow
night, to the Continent for six months. Then some more talk, and
leave him."</p>

<p>Ife undertook this, and went out.</p>

<p>After Ife's departure to interview Barnes, the man with the red
beard, Hartwell paced his room. Then half an hour later came Ife,
saying to Hartwell:</p>

<p>"He wouldn't have a drink, but I told him what you said about
going on the Continent. He seems a bit moody, sir; a screw loose
somewhere&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No doubt. He will probably present himself here to-day, but
must on no account be allowed to get to me. Take him to the alcove
in which is the speaking-tube, if he comes, and put him into
communication with me. And, as I do not know his name, you will use
the word 'eager' as you mention his name, so that I may know that
it is he."</p>

<p>After this an hour passed before Barnes went up to Hartwell's
office. Barnes had, of course, been spurred to prompt and desperate
action by the clerk's news that Hartwell was going away for six
months, for he saw that he must avenge his daughter that very day,
or put off his vengeance for a long time. But he had lingered an
hour trembling on the brink of action, eager enough, but held back
by many doubts and fears. At last, however, he came to a decision,
and went up. The clerk, Ife, conducted him to the alcove and the
telephone-whistle whiffed into Hartwell's room.</p>

<p>"Well?" answered Hartwell, with the drum at his ear.</p>

<p>"Mr Barrow, sir&mdash;'eager'&mdash;to speak with you," said
Ife. For Barnes believed that if he sent in his true name to
"Drayton," he would not be permitted to get near "Drayton," which
was what he wanted, and he called himself Barrow. Though, as a
matter of fact, if he had called himself Barnes, Hartwell would
probably not have remembered the name, or known what was his
grievance.</p>

<p>"Leave him in the alcove, Ife," said Hartwell, "and close the
door upon him," and half a minute afterwards he said, "You there,
Mr Barrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Barnes: "you Drayton?"</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>"Can't a man converse a bit with you, face to face, like men?
Can't very well through this thing."</p>

<p>"But this thing was made for conversing through, Barrow,"
replied Hartwell in a tone of sinister reproachfulness. "What is it
you want?"</p>

<p>"Two minutes' face to face talk with you."</p>

<p>"But, Barrow, you speak like an angry man. How is that,
Barrow?"</p>

<p>"Me? like an angry man? no, no, no, no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I know you, Barrow. You mean me no good, but you shall do
me no harm. You cannot see me now, and to-morrow night I leave
England. But that I may know the cause of your pernicious rancour
against me&mdash;your baleful malice, Barrow&mdash;I will meet you
to-morrow evening, if you like, at 7.15, in a house where we shall
be alone. The house is No. 7, Twyford Buildings&mdash;an old wooden
house in an alley lying between Lincoln's Inn Fields and Great
Queen Street. Does that satisfy you?"</p>

<p>"That'll do for me."</p>

<p>"Be punctual, then&mdash;at 7.15. I shall not wait one minute if
you are late. It is No. 7, Twyford Buildings, Lincoln's Inn, an old
empty house. You will find the door open. Enter, if I am not there
at 7.15, and go up to a room on the first floor in which you will
see a fire. I shall enter the house by a way known only to myself,
and we shall fail to meet, unless you are in that lighted room.
There await me. But, Barrow, I warn you&mdash;attempt no violence.
I know what you keep in your pocket, and I shall enter that room
and meet you with my finger on the trigger of a weapon, ready for
reprisals. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"I see your meaning," replied Barnes.</p>

<p>"That's a man! Good-bye."</p>

<p>And Barnes went away muttering: "He's taking me to that empty
old house to do for me, if I don't do for him first. Well, then,
it'll be the quicker man of the two! and, by the lord above us,
that shall be me!"</p>

<p>Soon after this Hartwell left the office to go home, walking
down his secret back court to where the brougham always now waited
for him. That night when he drove round the corner into Addison
Road, Mary Liskeard was not at the corner, but Hartwell peering out
all the time along the road descried her further down under a mass
of shadow cast by some trees. For the third time she started after
the carriage, as it passed her, and this time undoubtedly saw the
gate into which it swept.</p>

<p>Hartwell found in the house that night, not only Oswald who was
almost a professional diner-out, but also seven foreign people,
guests of the count, in a condition of gaiety, for that his <i>jour
de fête</i>, or baptism day. Accordingly, a quite bird-like
vivacity characterised the full dinner table, which rather burdened
Mr Dray-"tong," in whose grave heart was an ache, a sadness and a
longing. There was a thin Arlesienne girl in a costume which seemed
in peril of dropping down her shoulders who, while she talked,
vibrated up and down in sheer animation of being, and her fingers
twinkled abroad in the air. Always she said of something or other:
"<i>T-res, t-res, jolie&mdash;magnifique!</i>"</p>

<p>Young Bobbie Hartwell, looking in his fashionable new clothes
like a blushing page-o'-honor, gazed contemplatively at her with
open mouth, and threw out anon a silent breath of laughter.
Hartwell committed the indiscretion of talking some rather
Birmingham French, and at once saw Oswald's eyebrows slowly lift
and Oswald's gaze turn upon him, like a wooden head moved round by
slow clock-work. For Oswald had not known that his "James" could
speak Birmingham French. Now he knew; but Hartwell's eyes rested
lingeringly, with no good meaning, on that gaze of surprise, and he
remembered it.</p>

<p>Later in the night Oswald and Hartwell were getting together
among some palms in a nook of the drawing-room, whose silken walls
gave a shimmer of azure in the dreamy light, when Oswald produced a
piece of paper covered with notes. Dulaunay, with his foreign
guests and Bobbie, were playing whist and chattering some distance
away.</p>

<p>"You asked me," said Oswald to Hartwell, "to jot down these
details about the murder of Letty Barton. You said, I think, that
you would 'reason' about, them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, how is the matter going?" asked Hartwell.</p>

<p>"I don't know that anything has been discovered."</p>

<p>If will be understood that Oswald, while waiting to hear from
his man, Walker, the news of the return of Gissing to Overstrand,
had heard instead&mdash;with bitterness and amazement&mdash;that
all the Gissings had mysteriously disappeared, and that their house
was shut up. Now the Gissings were the only valid proof connecting
Drayton with Letty Barnes, for the shred of her letter found by
Oswald was a proof to himself alone, since he could produce no
evidence to show that he had found it where he had, in Drayton's
pocket. So that the Gissings disappearance had quite dashed the cup
of triumph from Oswald's hands.</p>

<p>But a fresh hope had arisen for Oswald. "James" had one night
voluntarily revealed to him much of the details of the
tragedy&mdash;"the struggle for a letter," the
"motive"&mdash;evidently finding some foolhardy pleasure, as Oswald
thought, in living the tragedy over again, on the pretence of
"reasoning;" and how if "James" could be led on to tell&mdash;too
much? It was a possibility. Oswald, at least, would not fail to
tempt him. And so it happened that if Hartwell's "reason" should
chance to let itself over-much run on the subject of Letty Barnes,
it was quite likely to put the hangman's noose around ins own
neck.</p>

<p>Reclining on a couch, Hartwell let his eyes run over Oswald's
notes; then after some minutes of thought, which he spent frowning
deeply and with closed eyes, he said:</p>

<p>"She seems to have been expecting the lover that night, and
certainly met him first in the tavern before they went into the
grounds."</p>

<p>Oswald was amazed at this candour: "This is delicious candour!"
he thought to himself.</p>

<p>"Yes, that may be so, James," he said aloud, "very curious. But
how does your 'reason' arrive at all that?"</p>

<p>"That much, I think, is perfectly established," said Hartwell.
"You have only to consider the powder-puff in the girl's pocket,
her whole dress, the watch and chain. She was to be seen by her
lover in the light."</p>

<p>Oswald laughed with bitter gladness. As "James'" only relative,
he was specially bitter just now at the preposterous "adoption" of
young Bobbie Hartwell.</p>

<p>"James, you are admirable," he said. "Oh, I am quite sincere.
However you come to know all this, your mere manner of telling it
is even more extraordinary than your notion of building
laboratories. That blow on the head has knocked all the good stuff
from the interior to the surface of your brain. You are no longer
James Drayton&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hartwell looked at him with a chill "beware!" in that smile of
his eye with the wrinkles at its comer; for any remark about change
in Drayton, unless it was sweet flattery in the mouth of Julia,
instantly stirred up in Hartwell a threatful watchfulness, for his
nerves were always on the <i>qui vive</i> to detect the first dawn
of a suspicion that he was not Drayton. Oswald's question about the
watch at Aylsham&mdash;"Why can't you open it?"&mdash;was stored in
Hartwell's memory, and now to it was added these other words: "You
are no longer James Drayton," two little remarks that might well
have made Oswald take a hurried trip to Australia or Peru, if he
had understood the still menace of that humour in Hartwell's
sideward look. But Hartwell, as was said before, "fled when no
human man pursued." If anyone had told Oswald that Hartwell was not
Drayton, for some minutes such a person would have seemed crazy to
Oswald. For though the mental difference between Hartwell and
Drayton was very great, the bodily resemblance was just as great,
or greater, and it is by the body that men know one another.</p>

<p>Before anything farther could be said on the subject of Letty
Barnes, a footman entered the drawing-room, and walked up to
Hartwell, saying:</p>

<p>"One Mary Liskeard to see you, sir."</p>

<p>"I know the name," thought Hartwell at once, "she has threatened
me in a letter. Her daughter's husband was lost with the
'Berenice,' and her daughter then drowned herself." Then he had a
quick thought that this might be the very woman who lay in wait for
him every night in Addison Road and rising, he walked a little way
across the room with the footman, saying in a low voice near the
man's ear: "A very big woman, with a very freckled face, John?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." answered the footman.</p>

<p>"Tell her this fib, John, that I leave England for six months
to-morrow night, nor can she see me to-night. But tell her that she
may see me to-morrow evening between six and eight, as I leave my
office in the City, then give her the Fenchurch Street
address."</p>

<p>While the man went down to deliver this message, Hartwell, in
his keen interest in this woman, ran into his bedroom and peeped
from behind the curtains as she passed down the drive. On returning
to the drawing-room, he took his stand by the Arlesienne, who was
rattling off a piece on the piano. He afterwards made Bobbie recite
"The Lotus-eaters," spent the evening socially, and reasoned no
more about Letty Barnes that night.</p>

<p>The next morning he went to the City as usual, spent the day in
work as usual, and no one looking at the face of Hartwell all that
day could have imagined the terrible work that lay before him that
evening&mdash;the terrible, doubtful meeting with his enemies at
Twyford Buildings first of all and then, if he should happen to
survive that meeting, the equally terrible meeting with the
admirable and beloved Julia afterwards. About five in the afternoon
he called the clerk, Ife, and said to him:</p>

<p>"I am requesting Durrant and Co. to make me a tender and
specification for the repair of No. 7, Twyford Buildings. I want to
beg you, therefore, to take a scuttle of coals in a cab and to get
me a roaring fire lighted there in that large first floor just at
the top of the stair. Go now and, in going away from the place
after lighting the fire, be careful to leave the front door a
little open for Durrant's man when he goes."</p>

<p>Before six o'clock, then, a fire was burning in that room of No.
7, Twyford Buildings. At Fenchurch Street Hartwell signed letters,
and wound up the day's work. One by one the clerks went away. But
he still remained alone in the office, doing nothing, pacing his
room, glancing frequently at the clock, till it was 7.15 p.m. That
was the hour at which Barnes was to be at Twyford Buildings in the
lighted room. At 7.30 Kirk was to be standing in the alley before
the door, waiting for Hartwell to come to him. Hartwell intended to
be punctual in keeping his appointment with Kirk, but he wished
Barnes to spend the quarter of an hour between 7.15 and 7.30 on a
stretch of nervous expectancy. At 7.15 it was time for him to
start. He went down, knowing that Mary Liskeard was there in the
street near the outer door. He had seen her arrival from a window
of the office, but he passed her with a rush and a run, and got
himself safely into a cab.</p>

<p>He had caused her, as he had caused Barnes, to believe that this
night was her last chance, and the deranged woman, all possessed
with her mania and her mission, was eager to seize it. She followed
Hartwell in another cab, as he expected that she would. At this
hour Barnes was standing lonely and lurking, with an intense ear
and an alert pistol, in the room with the fire in the Twyford
Buildings house.</p>

<p>The night was thick with a London fog, very cold and very dark;
the lights in the streets and in the shops seemed to smoulder; all
was uproar, gloom, and dull fires; and London resembled an extinct,
but still howling, Tartarus. Nearly all the interior of No. 7,
Twyford Buildings was about as black as it could be. Only that one
room with the fire in it jigged in an ecstatic indecision between
light and shadow.</p>

<p>While Hartwell and Mary Liskeard were on their way in two cabs,
the jockey, Kirk, arrived punctually at Twyford Buildings at 7.29,
and stood at the door of No. 7, waiting to see Hartwell come.
Twyford Buildings is a narrow alley of some ten houses on each
side. It is not passable to vehicles, for at its east end are two
barrier-posts, and at its west one of the houses projects, this
house being joined to the opposite house by an arch. Two lanterns
hanging outside two of the houses light its cosy wretchedness. A
rare woman or a child may be seen lounging in a doorway, always
looking terribly poor.</p>

<p>Hartwell alighted in Holborn at the Royal Music Hall, and ran
southward down a passage toward Lincoln's Inn Fields with his eyes
in his back, for he knew that the woman was trotting after him in
heavy, stealthy haste. He came to the two barrier-posts and turned
westward into Twyford Buildings, and instantly Kirk slipped within
the door of No. 7, as Hartwell had bidden him do.</p>

<p>Hartwell, too, slipping some moments after Kirk within the door,
whispered quickly into Kirk's ear: "Perhaps we had better change
hats," and he whipped off Kirk's Homburg hat, and put his own silk,
hat on Kirk's head. He then caught up the light weight of the
jockey on his back, as had been arranged, and now with sounding
steps he walked down the passage toward the stair, half-expecting
meanwhile Mary Liskeard's knife in someone's back, though not in
his own, which Kirk protected. But, in fact, he was nearly up the
stairs before the woman entered the darkness of the passage, and
there stood uncertain what to do next, for she could not see the
stair, and though she heard Hartwell's footsteps, she did not know
where they were.</p>

<p>But, in any case, the poor Kirk was doomed: for if he escaped
the woman, there remained for him Barnes. Barnes heard the loud
coming step, the step of a heavy man like Hartwell. He had quite
closed the door in order to have the first short chance at the
opening, but still the coming footsteps were distinct, and Barnes
stood near behind the door, alert to shoot the first shot, for he
believed that Hartwell was about to shoot him.</p>

<p>When Hartwell came to the door, he deposited Kirk without making
a sound, whispering at the same time very softly into Kirk's ear
the two words, "In here." Kirk turned the handle of the door,
opened it, and looked in, as he moved to enter. And the moment
Barnes' eyes were aware in the dancing firelignt of a human being
and a silk hat, prompt as lightning he fired, and Kirk dropped,
shot through the head. At the same time Hartwell made off
stealthily on tip-toe up the passage in which the door of that room
stood.</p>

<p>As for Mary Liskeard, the effect upon her nerves of that shot
may be imagined. She was in a strange house surrounded with
darkness, and she sickened at the unknown on hearing the report of
Barnes' pistol. She hid in one of the rooms below, opening upon the
passage, her body shaken in an agitation almost like that of
epilepsy. But she would not run. She waited for Hartwell to come
down to go out. During his passage from the stair to the door her
mission would be fulfilled.</p>

<p>Barnes, meantime, understood by the fire light that he had not
shot the murderer of his daughter. He stood over the body.
Certainly, Kirk was not Drayton. And now panic took hold of Barnes,
for awful is the thing done, far awfuller than the thing projected.
It appears in a different light, it cannot, moreover, be undone.
Barnes smote his brow, this was not Drayton. All thought of
avenging his daughter that night vanished instantly from his mind,
for one corpse, like one dinner, is enough for one night. Barnes'
only instinct for the moment was flight from what he had done, and
he fled.</p>

<p>But Mary Liskeard in her room below, hearing the hurried, light
step coming down the stairs, thought that it was "Drayton," as she
could not help thinking, for the pistol shot fired by Barnes at
Kirk was to Mary Liskeard a shot fired by "Drayton" at her; she had
therefore the idea that Drayton had decoyed her into this house to
do her to death, for she knew that he knew of her continual spying
on him. She had the natural instinct, therefore, that since
"Drayton" had decoyed her there for such a purpose the house would
be empty. Any step, therefore, which she might hear would certainly
be "Drayton's" and the stealthy haste with which Barnes came down
confirmed her in her certainty that Barnes was "Drayton," for she
felt without thinking, that "Drayton," after firing his shot at
her, must have lost her, and now was escaping, lest she should come
upon and kill him in the dark. She could see nothing, but when
Barnes was very near to her in the passage, into which she had
slipped out from her hiding-place, she could discern a form. And he
dropped so heavily as to make the old house tremble, for she had
stabbed him in the left temple.</p>

<p>At that moment, before the woman could run out, Hartwell himself
appeared at the top of the stairs, hatless, holding a lighted
candle. The woman looked alternately from him to the wounded man at
her feet; and severely, with bright eyes, Hartwell looked down at
her. This silent gazing and looking lasted, perhaps, as long as a
minute. Then the woman moved, big as she was, with the movement of
a panther&mdash;swift, stealthy, and cruel, she moved toward
Hartwell.</p>

<p>Hartwell sent a howl at her.</p>

<p>"Do not pursue me, Mary Liskeard!" he passionately shouted,
"these rooms are full of pitfalls! Let it not be said that I was
the cause of your death, Mary!"</p>

<p>Out he puffed the candle, and ran. But she was close upon him,
deaf to his counsel, the knife in her hand. He could actually hear
behind him the short breaths of her heavy haste. They ran the
length of the first floor down a passage which lay between rooms on
either hand, then into a room on the left, then through room after
room, doors banging after their flight, mostly through perfect
darkness, with only his footfalls to guide her course, she all
blown and panting, with feeble little womanly cries of "Oh!" and
"Stop him!" and "My daughter!" Hartwell knew that several of these
rooms had traps for the passage of merchandise from one floor to
the other, and he knew in which of them the traps were, but as for
her, she ran quite blindly, though she chanced always to escape,
till the race brought them to a doorway without a floor, opening
sheer upon the yard at the back of the house. Hartwell knew it, and
since she was close behind him, leapt through the door, alighting
safe on his toes and palms twenty feet below; but Mary Liskeard
expected no drop, ran on through the door after him, and with all
that weight came down with a child's outcry. The yard was paved
with small cobble stones. When Hartwell bent over her, he found
that she was dead.</p>

<p>He entered the house by a window, went upon the stair, took his
hat from Kirk's head, passed by Barnes lying on his face in the
passage on the ground floor, and went away, leaving the door wide
open. Hartwell thought that Barnes was dead, or he would not have
left him lying there without assistance, but Barnes was not dead.
Later in the night Barnes was found hanging half out of the front
door. The knife had penetrated the left temple, wounding that part
of the brain which doctors call "Broca's area." A wound just there
on the left side means dumbness, and also paralysis of the right
side of the body, and this was thenceforth Barnes' wrecked
condition.</p>

<p>Barnes could neither tell nor write what had happened. When the
police subsequently inquired in Fenchurch Street why the door of
No. 7, Twyford Buildings had been left open that night, they were
told that it was in order that a building contractor might go over
it, and Barnes' wound and the two deaths remained one of the
unsolved mysteries. It was supposed that the woman had stabbed
Barnes, shot Kirk, and then committed suicide.</p>

<p>As for Hartwell, on leaving Twyford Buildings, his enemies
having thus destroyed one another, he dined at a restaurant, and
took a cab to Brook Street, in order to keep his appointment, with
the fair Julia.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>XVI. &mdash; HARTWELL PAINS A
LADY</h2>

<p class="first">The frank and admirable Julia met Hartwell on the
stairs as he came up, and led him by the hand to a narrow, long
drawing-room, with a full-length crayon of herself at one of the
narrow ends, and an alabaster hearthplace at the opposite end. In
the room sat "Aunt Margaret" (Lady Wisden), a very faded and
bejewelled type, fifty years of age if she was a day. Her
much-painted face had the crude glaring look of amateurish
water-colour sketches, not pleasing to the male eye; her
cheek-bones were high, twin thrones on which sat Rouge; her lips
thin; She sat on a couch near the hearthplace, and with her
demurely sat the young Bobbie Hartwell.</p>

<p>Julia had only recently come in, her hat was still on her head,
and at once on Hartwell's entrance she began flurriedly to talk,
saying anything that came to her lips, as if afraid of a moment's
silence.</p>

<p>"Here, you see," she said, "is your new Bobbie: he has made me
play him a Traumbild, and has been reciting 'The Lotus-eaters' for
Aunt Margaret, who flatters me with the assurance that he resembles
me! He is charming with his accent and his freshness, but will
spoil within two years, for all the debutantes will fall in
love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why is he here?" asked Hartwell. "As for the debutantes, they
shall not see him much, the young man shall be in his
workshop."</p>

<p>Hartwell's lips were pressed together with a firm expression. He
was rather pale. The scene at No. 7, Twyford Buildings, from which
he had lately come, had not been a happy one, and he foresaw that
the scene to which he was now come might be even more trying to his
strength of will. He was therefore in no drawing-room mood and,
even as he shook hands with Lady Wisden, he said:</p>

<p>"My visit must be short, if you will pardon my abruptness. You,
my young friend, will at once take yourself off whithersoever your
whim may lead you. Pardon me, I am not quite well to-night."</p>

<p>Silence fell at this. Julia shot a glance at Hartwell, and
changed colour at the severe and iron look of his face. The boy at
once rose blushing, shook hands with Julia and Hartwell, and was
about to shake hands with Aunt Margaret, when she said to him, "I
am coming, too," and followed the boy out.</p>

<p>Hartwell and Julia were left alone. Hartwell sat on the small
Sheraton couch near the fire, on which Lady Wisden and Bobbie had
been sitting. Julia stood a little way off, somewhat behind him,
looking at him. Hartwell looked into the fire, leaning over his
umbrella-handle, looking prim as usual, the umbrella being neatly
folded, his gloves on, with all the buttons buttoned, and his beard
having a vague parting down the middle from which the hair was
brushed away on each side, giving the effect, of a certain
provincial-French primness and neatness, especially in connection
with the rather finical pressure of the thick lips, with the
definite point in the middle of the upper. This parting of the
beard, and brushing it aside, was a very un-Drayton-like thing, for
the dead Drayton would never have done it, but it was a very
Hartwell-like one; and it had attracted some notice.</p>

<p>While Hartwell looked at the fire in this way, Julia stood
silent, scared, drawn up to her tall length, a little behind him.
She had now thrown her hat from her, and stood handsomely dressed
in an over-skirt of black silk muslin, her chest well bared, with
heliotrope orchids at her waist, and on her neck and chest a
necklace of pearls which had been given her by Drayton, and was
purposely worn by her for this meeting, because she thought that it
was the beloved Hartwell who had given it to her.</p>

<p>Hartwell, too, looking at the fire was silent, inwardly
strengthening himself, thinking to himself "a man should at all
costs be a man," till Julia, making a sudden decision on the rising
within her of a feeling of trust and confidence in him, went and
sat on a yellow-satin stool at his feet, all her length gracefully
coiled down almost to the level of his knee. And he, with a tender
and relenting smile of the eye, looked down upon the soft,
wave-fabric of her hair.</p>

<p>Nothing was said on either side for some time, till she, scared
afresh by this silence, broke into a rather nervous mock-gaiety,
saying gallopingly the first thing that entered her head, with
apprehensive eyebrows and little upward glances at him all the
time.</p>

<p>Hartwell hardly heard what was being said, till she went on to
tell some tale about Oswald, when he more or less understood what
she was relating.</p>

<p>"I must tell you," she was saying: "I have had a definite
'offer,' if you please&mdash;your brother Oswald. I have captivated
a family! Or not quite definite, perhaps, but tending that way. He
stood just there&mdash;two nights ago&mdash;bowing a little,
smiling a little, his hands held stubbornly behind him, even as he
offered me one of them. He drawled, and he droned, and he
accumulated hints, till his meaning emerged, while I tingled at the
distinction. He had heard that his good James was no longer in the
running. Everyone had heard, and expected it, and he hoped that he
might prove the acceptable Abel to your Cain. I really thought of
'c,a,n,e.' Fatuity of him! I replied that everybody had heard
wrongly, and I always liked elder brothers&mdash;"</p>

<p>But now she broke off in the midst of the unreal prattle,
glancing up with a pretty dismay at him, for there he still sat,
saying nothing, bent over the handle of his umbrella, and gazing at
the fire. And again scared, she ran off anew into talk about his
approaching cruise in the <i>Sempronia</i>, saying that she had
asked so-and-so, as he had bid her, and intended to be charming in
the smartest yachting costume that had ever been devised and built.
But again she broke down in this pretence to herself and to him
that nothing was the matter, and now, looking up appealingly, she
said to Hartwell:</p>

<p>"What is all the mystery?"</p>

<p>To Julia's query, Hartwell had perforce to reply. He spoke
thus:</p>

<p>"You are dear to my heart, Julia. I cannot refuse to myself the
triumph of repeating to you that profound verity. But what you
expect from me now is not such avowals, but rather some explanation
of my abrupt departure from Castle Moran, and of my absence from
your side since then, after weakly permitting you to give
expression to your gentle inclinations towards me. This explanation
it is not easy to give, Julia&mdash;no, not easy. But I say now,
definitely, that many things peremptorily prohibit our nearer
union. Ah! I astonish, I give you pain, my dear one. I am much to
be pitied that I needs must."</p>

<p>"But what things prohibit?" she cried, with a terrified
expression on her face, "there were no things before!"</p>

<p>"There always were, there are still. I say that I was never half
worthy of you, nor am now."</p>

<p>"Really! but surely you might permit me to decide that for
myself, James, as I have the right, and the power, to do. I know
you now quite thoroughly, though I didn't before, and there isn't
any woman on any throne who wouldn't be glad&mdash;I laugh, if that
is the reason."</p>

<p>"It is, nevertheless, a real, an abundant reason, Julia," said
Hartwell with great earnestness. "Your words are sweet, but let me
not allow myself to be enticed by them. You have formed a mirage of
me in the cells of your mind which has no objective reality. Not
even in the least am I what I seem to you. I know myself, I know
you, and I compare the two."&mdash;now Hartwell proceeded to give
her a lecture on her merits, with a certain professorial zest in
his own choice of words&mdash;"In that glory of your eyes, now
purple, now black as pools of ink, dwells all sincerity. Words
which on other lips are the most trivial, have when uttered by you
a memorable distinction and sweetness. What an emblem of purity to
me is your soft cheek, just brushed with pollen-dusts of purplish
and rose, like the colored rind of the peach! Your soft and wavy
hair&mdash;dove brown&mdash;If the Madonna had been you, surely I
should have been a Christian, Julia! The two delicate curves of
your face running from the thick of each cheek to the tip of the
chin, between which as in a sunshiny dale your smile resides. Your
small-facedness, like the racehorse; the undiminished breadth of
the upper part of your forehead; the marble nobility there
presiding; your long-drawn shapeliness; your princess presence;
your athlete freedom; the perfection of your whole skeleton; your
lips compounded of the flesh of water-lily and withering petals of
the rose&mdash;All these are the signs of an aristocracy of
organisation, Julia, with which my gross clay must not aspire to
mate itself. No! such pleasures are not for me and, with pain, I
have to renounce them."</p>

<p>"But what a list of me!" cried Julia fondly. "Was over woman so
exalted with flattery so weighty and judicial, like blue-books and
statistics? My hair, my skeleton&mdash;I am enamored of
myself!&mdash;and the lips last of all for dessert, and liqueurs.
But that is not how 'I' like 'you,' James, in little sips; I like
you at one gallant draught, like the Three Mousquetaires."</p>

<p>Hartwell had the impulse to touch her hand so strongly, that the
restraint of it caused him to groan inwardly, while he made the
half-absent remark:</p>

<p>"But we are made of little sips, we are colonies of cells."</p>

<p>"No, nothing about cells, now, James," answered Julia firmly.
"How can you, when our hearts ore heavy? And why should they be
heavy? You have not given me any reason! You give me pain,
then."</p>

<p>"Let me be pitied! because I must. There are real reasons. We
are not to be mated, we are different as the Poles. If you knew me,
you might hate, you would despise, me. I say that I am an utterly
selfish thing; selfish in principle, hard, pitiless on occasion;
a&mdash;liar; what you would call an atheist&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't believe in God, really? and the next world?" asked
the excellent Julia.</p>

<p>"The next world is the moon," replied Hartwell, "and is
therefore moonshine. Of course, Julia, I believe in the moon. As to
believing in God, I believe in nothing else, since nothing else
exists; but my God, who, I assure you, is the one and true God, is
so essentially different from yours, that you would, I say,
assuredly call me atheist, or at least atheous&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do I care?" said Julia suddenly, quietly, with a pout,
"your God is sure to be the real one. I have got mine from hearsay,
and you have thought about yours. Isn't thought all mixed up with
that little superior smile in the eye? and like an old monarch
throned among the cares of empire on your forehead. Whatever you
are in that way, it is certain that I am, too, James. What do I
care? But confess, James, is not our discussion just now about
atheism a trifle unreal?"</p>

<p>Hartwell keenly felt its unrealness, for Julia was a modern
woman-of-the-world, taking the world and its good things as she
found them&mdash;its balls and its villas, its hunting, fencing,
and music, without giving herself any headaches about whence it all
came, or why it was all here, or whither it all went. Such
questions only haunt naturally inquisitive minds, or else minds
wracked with pain and sorrow, and Julia had had no sorrow so far,
and no time to be inquisitive about such matters. Hartwell's
suggestion, therefore, that she should give him up because he was
"atheous" was felt to be unreal by both of them, for the admirable
Julia was herself rather "atheous." Such talk was, in fact, merely
a beating about the bush, and a putting off of the hard thing which
had to be said. Hartwell's eyes closed in a silent agony, his palm
laid lightly on his hair, for she was driving him step by step
toward the statement which he had come to make, but shrank more
from than he had shrunk from Mary Liskeard's knife or Barnes'
revolver.</p>

<p>"Not real!" he answered gruffly, with an unreal emphasis. "I am
as hard of heart as Nature herself. I tell you now that every day I
tell a thousand lies. I am at this moment, in a way undreamable by
you, lieing to you&mdash;even, Julia, to you. I am fresh, as I sit
here, from callously watching the execution of three persons who
dared to wish me ill. These things, approved by my reason, must be
hateful to yours. I am utterly selfish&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what do I care?" asked Julia, deaf to all this. "You are
not selfish. You are unselfish to <i>me</i>, that is all I care
about. Are you not at this moment breaking your heart&mdash;I can
see, you know&mdash;for my sake, because you have got it into your
head that it would somehow be bad for me to marry you? Is that
unselfish, or not?"</p>

<p>"Darling of my heart&mdash;Yes, even that is selfish for, by a
mystery, I love you better than I love myself, and your hurt would
be greater pain to me than this hewing off of my right arm which I
now do. Julia, Julia, you must give me up. Julia, you must. I
beseech, I bid you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it all sounds so unreal!" she said pleadingly. "Oh, think
of my maimed life! At least, let one know some reason! I seem to be
in a nightmare, I understand nothing.</p>

<p>"Dear! you should not, you should not! Give&mdash;me up? and
part with everything? up the ghost&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"It may&mdash;possibly&mdash;kill me," said Hartwell. "You are
too young, too pliant, to die; and time will assuredly solace your
discomfort. A day may even come when you will feel yourself
disposed, Julia, to further the evolution of our human race by
casting into its life-whirlpool the products of your excellent
motherhood. The cells, the brain, whose purely physiological
interaction causes love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No cells&mdash;I won't hear," cried Julia! "Cells is only a
subterfuge to conceal from yourself that you are bitterly
suffering, and you won't tell me why, that I may comfort you. Oh,
what has happened? Why, you were always my constant lackey before
the accident, running to do my whims, but now you are
different&mdash;you part your beard under the chin, and brush it
neatly aside, and insist on cells and apes&mdash;and now when I
like like you, like you, like you, to leave me!</p>

<p>"Frankly I could not bear it. You don't know what a thing is in
me for you, dear. And no real reason, none&mdash;none is
conceivable&mdash;it is only a love-whim. Cell me no cells! Let's
talk of prison-cells&mdash;arms that more lock themselves by
pulling&mdash;Will you? See, I woo you!"</p>

<p>Now, in her panic of losing him, she collected and lavished upon
him all her passion and power of beautiful serpent, morbid dove,
and love-sick woman, pleading, fondling, tempting, laughing,
crying, working hard to seduce his senses and enchain his will,
with a yearning, upward gaze in her eyes&mdash;"I woo you. Be good
to me now. You shall, you shall. Look into my eyes, gaze, you like
them half-closed? languishing in love-liquor?</p>

<p>"Am I divine when I am impassioned? You never saw me&mdash;my
eyes turn black. (Oh, if I were to fail&mdash;!) And the lips, you
may be rough, and yet kind, Jimmy&mdash;what did you say of them?
'composed of lily and rose-leaf,' with a dash of woman's blood,
just to kiss with, and a snake in the flowers to infect you with
the malignant sweet o' me. No, don't try, you can't cope with the
resources of the woman you love. You may slight me till the moment
I choose, and then I'll drown you in surprises. I'm wily&mdash;you
remember Uncle Toby and the widow. Don't try&mdash;James, my own,
how strongly you love me! With what wings I love you! Let's be
chums, near and dear, shall we? Then I will cast the products of my
excellent motherhood wildly into a whirlpool, if only their father
be&mdash;biological. Is it agreed now, then? He likes my face on
his knee, kiss&mdash;then? Now? I'll taste sweeter than honeydew
and milk of Paradise!&mdash;Now? Eh? No, really, really, you should
not push my head away, James, really, no. Oh! how very fatal! What,
are you still stern then? But&mdash;great Heavens!&mdash;what a
disastrous thing!"</p>

<p>Hartwell had sprung up roughly, white to the lips, she still
sitting on the foot-stool, staring up in a wide-eyed scare at him,
apprehensive of his next moods, understanding now that this was no
dallying or "love-whim, but the wounding of her life in earnest.
And, in fact, Hartwell's next words were monstrous, brutally direct
and unequivocal. Turned toward the fire, with his back to her, and
looking downward, he pronounced the words:</p>

<p>"I happen to be already&mdash;married. I had been married some
years when&mdash;I&mdash;engaged myself to you. I was, indeed,
merely a low ruffian. And my wife probably lives."</p>

<p>It was all that was left to Hartwell to say! He might, indeed,
have told her that he was not Drayton, but a poor working-man, that
Drayton was married, but not Hartwell. But at that time he was
certain that in either case he must lose her. Neither Drayton nor
Hartwell, it seemed to him, could marry her, for Drayton was
already married and Hartwell was a Birmingham working-man. In
telling her that he was Drayton and married, he lost her, but kept
Drayton's wealth and estate. If he had revealed to her that he was
not the married Drayton, but the widower Hartwell, who was a
working-man and an impostor, it seemed to him that he would have
lost both her and Drayton's wealth and estate also.</p>

<p>Hartwell, looking down at the fire with his back half-turned to
Julia, did not glance at her for a minute or so after making his
declaration that he was already married. He waited for her to
speak, but she said nothing. When at last the corners of his eyes
did take her in, he saw that her face was laid sidewards on the
couch, there where she sat on the foot-stool. Her eyes were closed,
and it was a face as screwed in silent pain as that of a woman
pierced with neuralgia, or torture of the thumb-screw. This
Hartwell could not stand, and with a severe flash of the eyes and a
seizure of his umbrella, as though he were snatching it from
someone, he made off, trembling, grumbling something, without
having once looked directly at her.</p>

<p>She, for her part, must have become quickly conscious of her
loneliness, for half-way down the stairs he heard her scream after
him. She had leapt up with the cry: "But it couldn't be
true&mdash;"</p>

<p>This sound only the more hurried his headlong steps. He got his
hat in an agitated dream, and rushed from the house into the foggy
night, shaken to the depths, horrified at his own ruthlessness, and
frightened at his desolate future.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>XVII. &mdash; HARTWELL SAILS THE
SEAS</h2>

<p class="first">Hartwell's projected yachting-party in the
<i>Sempronia</i> never became a fact for, five days after his break
with Julia, the invited guests learned with astonishment that
Hartwell had gone alone. He took no one with him save Dulaunay and
a young Creole doctor, named Kinsey, whom he had got by advertising
for a doctor, and for nearly three years the yacht was Hartwell's
home.</p>

<p>Those years must be rapidly passed over, in order that we may
follow what afterwards happened, and that the narrative may not
become too long.</p>

<p>Hartwell had furnished one of the <i>Sempronia's</i> stately
rooms with the fittings and apparatus of a laboratory, promising
himself some forgetfulness of Julia, in scientific research on the
sea. But this hope did not come to very much, on account of the
state of his health. He was a troubled wanderer, a dyspeptic guest
in the world, with a confirmed acidity of the stomach, and whatever
he ate, or saw or experienced, had bitterness in it for him.</p>

<p>Unknown to anyone, he returned to London toward the end of the
season that first year, leaving Dulaunay on the yacht, and he spent
two weeks in a secluded incognito at a West-End hotel. There he
made the acquaintance of a certain old major who knew everyone's
movements, and by the gossip of this old major, as well as by what
appeared in the newspapers, Hartwell could follow the goings and
comings of Julia, who was being ground in the usual Society mill.
One night he lay in wait among a mass of carriages outside the
Empress Rooms where she was a hostess at a poudre-ball that night,
and he caught a glimpse of her. Then, once again he saw her through
a glass darkly at Newmarket, he being a long distance from her, for
he did not wish her to see him. And again one Sunday on the lawn
opposite Stanhope Gate he saw her, this time with a long look, for
he was directly behind her. She was talking with two men, and
seemed gay enough. On none of these three occasions did she suspect
that he was anywhere near her.</p>

<p>He had put himself into the hands of a stomach-specialist when
he first arrived in London from his ship, but he returned to the
sea grievously ill. There seemed to be no cure in the world for his
splenetic sickness.</p>

<p>One midnight Dulaunay and the "chief" were leaning over the
taffrail of the <i>Sempronia</i>, smoking. Earlier in the night a
troupe of dancing-girls and jugglers had been on board for a dinner
given by the ship to the podesta and grandi of the white town under
the hills inland, and this merriment had kept the count from his
bed. The sea lay with hardly a wave on it, the ship was as dim and
lonely as a cloister, the moon was in the sky, and the universe
looked an Italian universe all stained in that bluest blue in which
clothes are washed. Suddenly, as the two men smoked and chatted,
looking over the sea, a quiet step passed behind them. Dulaunay
turned and saw Hartwell, who was in pyjamas, with bare feet, and
the count put up his hand to the "chief" with a gesture which
meant. "You wait;" and he himself followed Hartwell.</p>

<p>Hartwell was asleep. He walked three quarters of the
<i>Sempronia's</i> length&mdash;a considerable distance, for she
was a long, low craft of 3,000 tons, with three masts and one
funnel. Then, as though he could see, he turned into a lane between
the smoking room and a skylight, strange sounds coming from him all
the time, groans, little whimpers of trouble. And back they went
toward the poop, Dulaunay dogging Hartwell's steps, step for step,
to the stair, down to the main deck, and so into Hartwell's
bedroom. The electric light was shining in the room, and Dulaunay
could see the blank and solemn-looking white of the sleeper's eyes
as, standing before a mirror, Hartwell uttered sound upon sound of
suffering. His right hand slowly and falteringly lifted, and
pointing with a limp finger at his own image in the glass, he
mumbled:</p>

<p>"I know that you are not Drayton, but myself. Let it not be said
that I have ever feared you."</p>

<p>When Dulaunay touched his hand, Hartwell started awake, uttered
a sob, and was presently induced to lie on his bed.</p>

<p>These nocturnal pilgrimages had become not uncommon with
Hartwell of late.</p>

<p>Dulaunay went up puzzling his brains as to the meaning of those
words: "You are not Drayton, but myself," for if Drayton was
himself, yet not Drayton, who, then, was Drayton? That was a fine
question in the metaphysic.</p>

<p>The excellent count had become Hartwell's very faithful nurse
and friend. Together they went to Puyde-Dome to visit an old
chateau among the mountain ranges of Upper Auvergne, where
Dulaunay's mother and sister lived. They were the last
representatives of the Counts d'Artenset, very poor, but very proud
in a French way, and still highly honored by the peasantry who
lived in those hills. The home-coming of Dulaunay, who was the
reigning count, was made the occasion of a fete in three villages,
and here, in the half-ruined chateau, Hartwell spent a pleasant
fortnight. Three days of it, indeed, he spent in bed, but the other
days were passed in the enjoyment of an old-world atmosphere of
quietness and culture, and of the charms of the two ladies'
society. There were other chateaux and a copper mine in the
neighborhood, and to these he took drives with the ladies through
natural beauties, for which he had always the keenest eye.</p>

<p>In going south from there to join the <i>Sempronia</i> at Genoa,
during a week in Milan he one night caught sight of Julia and Lady
Wisden at an opera at the Scala. Then a long time passed before he
saw her again. The interval was filled by random cruisings; all the
coasts of the Eastern and Western Mediterranean, Norway and the
Baltic, from St. Petersburg to Odessa, were leisurely visited, and
now Hartwell and the count were in an atmosphere of brigandage and
coloured clothes in a Sicilian mountain world. Now in casinos, and
now among Byzantine palaces, and tombs of the Osmanlis. For two
months Hartwell was trying the bromo-iodine treatment of
Salsomaggiore, but whether or no this might have done him good, if
he had continued there, he had to go away to attend a series of
Imperial functions at Moscow, without feeling any the better for
the treatment. Hartwell was now known in Europe not merely as a
rich man, but as a thinker, and had become familiar with the life
of Courts, for in the second year he had published an essay on the
"Causes of Evolution," and the small work had been widely
translated and "crowned." This pamphlet, which was supposed to be
marked by great "scientific imagination," traced in a detailed and
remarkable way the probable history of the change from ape into
man, the main reason, according to Hartwell, being the so-called
Glacial Period, an event which forced the apes to light fires, or
else be frozen. And this thesis, which was apparently new to the
scientific world, caused him to be decorated at Berlin, and to be
made a Fellow of the Societies.</p>

<p>From time to time he paid a flying visit to England. Twice he
saw his son, Bobbie, once at the estate in Bucks, and once at
Rugby, where Hartwell himself had been "educated." One dark
midnight he stood for a long time looking at the factory in
Birmingham in which he had for many years been a workman, and he
dropped a ten-pound note into the letter-box of an old workman
friend.</p>

<p>He was now free of "business," save of such as arose from the
estates and from a continued stream of correspondence. He had
pensioned all the older members of Drayton's staff, and he could be
liberal, as not only the widow McCalmont found, but as the hosts of
begging letter-writers&mdash;the hospitals, societies, missions,
etc.&mdash;sometimes found: but, on the whole, the saying went that
Drayton had become "more close-fisted" with his money.</p>

<p>As to Corton Chantry, in Norfolk, Hartwell knew nothing of it,
save that one of his agents paid taxes for a comparatively
unimportant property in ruins somewhere down there. No woodman, no
servant there had even called upon Hartwell to recognise his or her
existence. He assumed that the old place was given over to the
bats, and practically forgot that there was such a place. But one
day when he was in harbour at Ajaccio, for the second time with in
three years there reached him a letter from a Norwich Bank
reminding him that "the second £400 deposited for the use of Steve
Anderson was nearly exhausted," and again he wondered, as he had
wondered before, who this Steve Anderson could be, and sent a
cheque for a further £400 to the bank for Steve Anderson's use.</p>

<p>Sometimes a hope would strike like lightning through Hartwell's
breast; "Perhaps 'the wife' is dead! She gives no signs, no sign,
that 'wife' who 'screams.'" If "the wife" was only dead, Julia was
still unmarried, and might still be his. At the end of each year he
had searched the newspapers for every day of it, to see if Julia
was engaged. Her movements were recorded, he followed her in fancy
wherever she went, from country house to casa, from city to
kurhaus, but she remained unengaged.</p>

<p>Sometimes he had another hope, vague enough, that "the wife"
might not really be a wife. But one idle day&mdash;it was in
Bucks&mdash;while rummaging in an old trunk full of papers in a
bed-room once used by Drayton, he came upon a marriage certificate,
the certificate of Drayton's marriage. Drayton had married his wife
in the town of Colesburg, South Africa, fifteen years before, she
at the time of her marriage with him being a widow of twenty, named
Martha Harper.</p>

<p>If Hartwell happened to stay a few days at Addison Road, he saw
the bald head of Oswald, who was every month a more fossilised
dawdler toward old fogeyism and an empty old age. Oswald, is the
"villain" of our history, and we may wish that we had a more
terrible and orthodox villain, but we must represent him as he
really was. Always still embarrassed for money, Oswald lived in a
weary limbo of clubs, bets, debts, and other people's dinner. The
Gissings seemed gone forever, Oswald's dreary brain could get no
nearer the implication of his brother in the murder of Letty
Barnes. "James'" indigestion of body and mind would permit of no
further "reasonings" for the present on that fascinating subject,
"James'" visits to town were too flying for reasonings, and
"James'" cheque-book remained a dream to Oswald.</p>

<p>Oswald had only this one spiteful joy, that "James" and Julia
were, evidently, permanently parted. Oswald did not yet despair of
Julia, he saw her often. She even seemed of late to like his
society in a special way. Someone had suggested to him that this
might be only because he was "James'" brother, but Oswald knew
better. He had a queer, fixed figment of a thought in his head
that, since she had accepted Cain, she must needs accept Abel. He
meant to try Julia again some day, and this mania, which was
destined to bear him disastrous fruit, grew in Oswald.</p>

<p>Once when Hartwell was spending a night at the house in Addison
Road, Oswald said to him:</p>

<p>"There is Corton Chantry, why not let me renovate the old
shooting-box, Jimmy, as my man, Magee, suggests&mdash;it would cost
precious little, I suppose&mdash;and call it my country house for
the present? It will be mine some day by the entail, of course,
supposing I outlive you, and you leave no heir. Those unpreserved
old coverts must be running wild with pheasants and poachers. I
might take some men down there for a month's fun. May I?"</p>

<p>And to this Hartwell answered:</p>

<p>"I suppose you may, if you like."</p>

<p>Hartwell went away that time very sick, weary of Europe and of
life, and determined to start for the Far East from Marseilles,
where the <i>Sempronia</i> lay. In order to get to Marseilles he
went to Paris, where he met Dulaunay and the mulatto, Dr Kinsey. He
had thought that Julia also was in Paris, but when he got there he
learned that she had left Paris two days before, for her Cannes
villa. Upon this Hartwell, Dulaunay, and Kinsey set off for Cannes,
neither Hartwell himself nor either of the two at all knowing why
they were going to Cannes but, in fact, a whisper was growing
urgent and more urgent in Hartwell's mind, which said to him:</p>

<p>"Suppose you tell her that 'the wife' is dead or suppose you
tell her that it was not really true that you are married, and so
save your own life, even if you ruin hers." This temptation, which
was as strong as a rope that drew him, more and more, drew Hartwell
toward Julia.</p>

<p>The three men arrived at Cannes, and on the second night after
their arrival, Hartwell was on the grounds of the Villa
Borgia-Costi, where Julia was. It was already a late hour when he
entered the grounds, but after prowling for another hour about the
olive grove and elaborate "water works" of the villa, he got a
sight of her, as she sat alone in a boudoir, writing letters. By
leaning aside on a water-butt, with his weight supported by his
left palm, he could peep in at a window and watch her, but even as
he looked, her face was hidden from him, for she laid it on the
table at which she was writing, and kept it so a long time. About
her bent form fell the draperies of a white tea-gown. He saw the
bare back of her neck, and her bare forearms which were crossed
over the table, on which also he saw his pamphlet on Evolution, and
Hartwell's heart beat wildly against his side, as all the trees of
the grove seemed to whisper him: "Tell her, since she will like the
lie," and the cicada chirped to him, "Tell her, Hartwell, and get
some sleep for yourself," but when she raised her self with a
despondently-shaken head, suddenly his eye flashed severely, he
muttered: "No! let this be the last of such fooling," and he went
away.</p>

<p>That this unfed hankering near about her must sooner or later
bring him to the hospital or the grave the worthy Hartwell saw, and
now he made haste to put the breadth of the earth between her and
him. He went, as he had intended, to the Far East, peeped at the
Mongolian Courts, saw the reproachful eyes of old Gissing at Hong
Kong, visited the islands of spice, and after nine months of the
East returned with a dark pale face, thinner cheeks, and health so
broken, that only a mulish power of will any longer kept him on his
feet. Weary of the barren world of the sea, he now settled awhile
in a feudal rocca, or fortress, small but impregnably perched among
mountain crags not far from Siena, and here again he heard of
Julia. She had come to Siena from Venice for the July festival
which they call "Palio delle Contrade," and was occupying with her
aunt one of those grim palaces of the fourteenth century&mdash;a
vast, dark block of building, near the centre of the town.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>XVIII. &mdash; HARTWELL GETS A
NURSE</h2>

<p class="first">Into whatever town Dulaunay went, if there was no
gaiety there, his mere presence evoked it. Hartwell's bankers and
letter-of-credit connections presented the count among the best
people; he went out and was gay, while Hartwell secluded himself at
home, throeing with his indigestion of the world; and everywhere
the count left behind him at least one love-lorn lady, one sighing
heart.</p>

<p>Dulaunay met Julia for the first time at a function at the
Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, and returning to the castle among the
hills at three in the morning, found Hartwell in a dressing gown
pacing the flag-stones of his bedroom, which was on the ground
floor of the little moschio (or donjon) of the fortress. A large
book lay open on the stone table in the room, which was lighted
with four tallow candles stuck on an iron bar.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, sir!" murmured Dulaunay, stopping short with
bated breath and a rueful face, "but this is not that which you
promised me as to going to bed."</p>

<p>"Let it not be said, Dulaunay," answered Hartwell, still pacing,
"that the servant is above his Lord. I act as I please, sir."</p>

<p>"Good! very good." The count threw himself upon a wooden settee,
tired out and there was silence for a time, till, deliberately
collecting his five finger-tips into a bunch, the worthy and
excellent count put them to his lips, kissed them away, and
sighed.</p>

<p>Hartwell's eyes softened into their genial smile, and he
said:</p>

<p>"Dulaunay, I see that you have been losing your heart for the
thousandth time."</p>

<p>"Ah, "Draytong", there are not but the English women, after
all," answered the count.</p>

<p>"Are there, then, some English in Siena?" asked Hartwell.</p>

<p>"Imagine, sir, the head of Aphrodite on the body of Artemis!
Figure yourself, "Draytong", a human woman whose father was a dove,
and whose mother was a peach&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! she is cross-bred."</p>

<p>"But, sir, I do not say it to make laugh! It is really so in a
certain sense! whose father was a mourning dove, and whose mother
was a peach: whose grandfather was a swan, and whose grandmother
was a violet: it is too strong, you know."</p>

<p>"Do not add that the great-grandfather was a pork-man,
Dulaunay," said Hartwell.</p>

<p>"And she waltzes! ah, she waltzes! like a trailing long wisp of
hay in the arms of the whirlwind! and her hair cannot be kept from
growing loose, as she dances."</p>

<p>"Well, then, may the fervor be reciprocal."</p>

<p>"But I think it: I have reason to think it!" cried the count: "I
know the signs&mdash;. She is not one of them who will be too
difficult to the favorite, provided he be not a novice, while all
the rest of the men would only lose their Latin with her. I have
already my plan of siege laid to the last detail. Three things,
"Draytong", make the women ours&mdash;the gratitude, the pity, and
the vanity&mdash;in exciting the gratitude in a young girl of
family, the pity in a married woman, and the vanity in a widow. The
first I make gay, the second I make sad, the third I make to
blush&mdash;when that is possible: if I make her to blush, the hour
has struck, she is mine. Now this divinity is a widow: but a wise
general knows how to change his tactics in the different
cases&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, by the way, is her name?" asked Hartwell suddenly:</p>

<p>"Lady Methwold."</p>

<p>"Ah?"</p>

<p>"But, sir, you find yourself bad&mdash;?" Hartwell had not known
that Julia was near to him: he stood a minute with closed eyes and
his palm laid lightly on his hair; then, sittings on the settee, he
rested his forehead on Dulaunay's shoulder, for he was not strong
at that time.</p>

<p>Dulaunay had no suspicion that Hartwell even knew Julia, and
during the two weeks which followed that night, the count brought
home daily news of his progressive love-story. At first Hartwell
heard it absent-mindedly: but when it became evident that Julia
must really be quite unusually intimate with the Count d'Artenset,
Hartwell's interest quickened: and from that hour the situation
became charged with danger. In Hartwell's nature ordinarily
jealousy had little place, but from day to day he now more than
ever sickened; he could hardly eat anything; his nights were more
than ever dark and wretched; life seemed to his atrabiliar eyes a
thing all crape and gloom; and he lost all taste and interest in
everything, save in Dulaunay's intrigue, to whose details he would
hearken with a flashing eye and a lip white with agitation.</p>

<p>Wherever Julia was or went, there, it was evident to Hartwell,
the count also was to be found: Julia herself seemed to desire, and
devise this. Dulaunay was almost daily at the old palazzo, grim
With its barred window-slits, where Julia lived: he would stroll up
with her to the cathedral, or to the church of St. Dominic, among
those steep and winding alleys of Siena, whose succession of arches
make them mere arcades of mediaeval dimness, haunted, as it were,
by the ghost of Dante; they met at hill-picnics and dances, or
strolled together at sunset among the meadows, orchards, and
mulberry groves of the valley; there was also the July race, and
there were card-parties, and functions in August at the Palazzo
Pubblico, which constantly threw the count and Julia together. It
was clear that this time Dulaunay was in earnest; all the ladies in
Siena could not turn his mind from the siege of Julia. One night he
whispered to Hartwell the great tidings:</p>

<p>"To-day, for the first time, I kissed her hand."</p>

<p>"There, I think, you made some progress, count," said Hartwell:
"did she&mdash;you know what&mdash;did she blush, and mince, and
cast down the eyes?"</p>

<p>"Ah, not yet. It is that which is going to arrive. She only
smiled in a certain little way. But the intrigue is now in that
stage which does not let itself accelerate.</p>

<p>"Well, you may succeed, my good fellow, you may, you may: but,
seriously, I doubt it. She seems slow, she is dallying with you,
Dulaunay. Have a care, my friend! she'll eat out your vitals like a
wolf!"</p>

<p>Dulaunay was so taken up with his intrigue with Lady Julia that
he did not notice the tragic strangeness of Hartwell's tone and
look; he replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, I have no fear of anything: I am on the road, and the end
is in sight. I attack both her vanity, her gratitude, and, little
by little, her pity also. She becomes conscious of my misery, and
is going to learn that she alone can cure it. These two
consciousnesses will give to her, firstly, a highly pleasant sense
of her own importance (for which pleasure she will be unconsciously
grateful to me), and, secondly, a sentiment of sublime pity for my
pains: then she will stretch her hand to save me from the
abyss&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excellent!" cried Hartwell with a laugh: "you'll win her yet,
by Heaven! An Apollo like you, born for conquest. It is well to be
young, and French, and handsome, sir."</p>

<p>"He is queer to-night," thought Dulaunay to himself, adding
aloud: "By the way, she has heard of you, sir, and demonstrates the
keenest interest in your personality&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In mine?"</p>

<p>"But yes: often she invites me to discuss you and our life here:
our plans, our voyages, your health&mdash;Wonders for what you are
a hermit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, she does?" said Hartwell, stopping in his restless pacing.
"Wonders why I am a hermit! Well, then, all I can say is that you
seem to me to be in a bad way, Dulaunay; it is evident that she is
hankering after the&mdash;unknown: look, therefore, to yourself, my
friend, and let it not be said that a sick hermit beat a gallant in
love!"</p>

<p>"But "Draytong", you are queer tonight. No sleep at all, then,
no sleep, no sleep? What to do there, <i>mon Dieu</i>! You should
make greater efforts, however, sir: you should compose yourself to
sleep. Kinsey does not like to give you the drugs two nights in
succession. But if you sleep, you immediately
somnambulate&mdash;What vexing circumstance! This morning at three
o'clock you were out in the courtyards without slippers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But when you kissed the hand&mdash;tell your tale right
through. She made no remonstrance? did not pout up her lips and
look vexed?" queried Hartwell.</p>

<p>On the contrary, replied the count, "she smiled, I repeat, in a
certain little way."</p>

<p>"Then, let doubt be dismissed! you have carried half the fort,
Dulaunay. Why, kissing is kissing, man! if you have only touched
her hand, the&mdash;the lips come next; there's hardly a step. And
such lips! The child of a dove and of a peach, you
said&mdash;excellently said! You are a genius, you know, for
expression, and they love a glib, expressive, French tongue."</p>

<p>"No, "Draytong", come, come," said Dulaunay, springing up with
decision: "never again will I converse with you at this late
hour"&mdash;and after a long argument and almost a struggle the
count got Hartwell to go to bed.</p>

<p>It was two nights after this that the count told to Hartwell the
story of how that day at the Isituto, while he and Julia were
standing before a famous picture, looking at it, Julia called him
no longer "monsieur le comte," but "Emile," and he had called her
"Julia." This must have deeply affected Hartwell in his then morbid
condition of mind and body; at all events, he disappeared from the
rocca that same foreday; Dulaunay, Kinsey, and a sort of abbe who
was a hereditary fixture in the rocca, together with the steward of
the <i>Sempronia</i> and a little porter called Pini, searched the
district with lanterns in a heavy rain for two hours: but it was
not till daybreak that Hartwell was found lying on his face in a
thicket of sarsaparilla near the outer ditch of the rocca; he was
shivering with cold, though burning with fever; by noon he had
delirium; and Dr Kinsey believed that he would die.</p>

<p>For the next two days Julia did not see Dulaunay; for now that
Hartwell was actually stricken down, Dulaunay was like his shadow,
and would not leave his side. He sent Julia a note, folded in a
special way at right angles, excusing himself from being with her
on account of the illness of Hartwell; but on the third day Julia
wrote pressingly to him, to see her at the portal of the city
called the Wolf; and that afternoon Dulaunay went to meet her.</p>

<p>The sun had set, and they strolled for an hour or so in a
scented evening air among orchards, summer villas, and hedges which
were now heavy with brown grapes, for about there the vines run in
the hedges. Dulaunay considered that the intrigue was now ripe, and
had decided to declare himself more definitely at that
interview.</p>

<p>"I have no necessity," he said, "to tell you that my heart is in
flames&mdash;Ah! you blush divinely. I dare to hope that I, on my
side, am not altogether indifferent to you."</p>

<p>They were sitting at that time in an arbor of vines behind a
little inn on the Empoli Road; he took her hand, and she did not
withdraw it from him; her face hung pensively in the twilight.</p>

<p>"What is it all about, Emile?" she said: "if you jest, you
choose a singular moment when you see me so sad."</p>

<p>"Sad? are you sad? But have I, then, the air of someone who
jests? I am at your feet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And on my nerves, too," said Julia quickly. "I never expected
to see you <i>mal a propos</i>. Whatever has got into your head
to-day, you who are always so charming?"</p>

<p>The excellent and worthy count sat one moment aghast, then,
sudden and quick to take offence, he sprang up and bowed
stiffly.</p>

<p>"Madame, if I have dared to flatter myself with the
hope&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of what?" asked Julia with a perplexed brow. "Don't be
fantastic. Haven't I always gone out of my way to show how much I
like your society? Wasn't it I first called you by your Christian
name? That ought to have shown you that I wished to be friends. I
thought everyone could read my secret, Emile: I have been a
hopelessly infatuated woman for years&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>!"</p>

<p>"Oh, look at him! he can't conceive it lasting for
years&mdash;dreadful man. It can, Emile, it does, let me tell you,
it is the worm that dieth not. Some day when we are still closer
chums, I will tell you about it, and you will know."</p>

<p>"Madame, my felicitations. But, as for me, am I, then,
annihilated?"</p>

<p>"I thought you would guess! Why else should I have liked to have
you always about me at the first, except to hear you talk about
someone? I saw that you liked him awfully, and that was at once a
sympathy&mdash;. You do love and honor him an awful lot, Emile,
don't you? Tell me."</p>

<p>"It is "Draytong" that she wishes to say!" exclaimed Dulaunay:
"I am, then, annihilated!" But he added in a lower tone a moment
after, "all the same, if I had to be supplanted by another, it is
he whom I should have chosen."</p>

<p>"Of course, it is. I can't imagine anyone troubling to be fond
of anyone but him, Emile: and he has been dying, three days, and
you didn't tell me. Suppose he were, in truth, to die?"</p>

<p>"Ah, but tears! Pardon me, adorable Julia, I knew
nothing&mdash;do not cry, do not cry, I implore. He will not die!
it, is no one but Kinsey who talks of the death, the doctor of
Siena laughs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And as to the nurse, who is she?"</p>

<p>"She is of the Ospedalo of the University: but I, for the most
part, nurse him myself."</p>

<p>"Yes, you look rather worn. You are awfully enamored of him,
really, I can see, Emile. You and I shall be the nurses, Emile! We
can't trust anyone's care but our own, and you will procure me a
room from to-night in some house not too far away from the rocca. I
foresee that we are going, to be the very best chums, you and I, if
you have thoroughly dropped the fantastic part. Shall it be so?
then, shake hands: that is a compact for always on my side&mdash;Do
you know that La Forli is miserably in love with you? I shall
procure you meetings with her at my palazzo when he is better, and
any other of them that you care for; you must tell me, and I will
help you, and be always your friend. Have you any rooms to spare in
the rocca itself? or is there a tavern near by? I am afraid my Aunt
Margaret won't like going out to the hills, but I daresay I shall
manage her."</p>

<p>In the end it was arranged that Julia and Lady Wisden should
stay at a lonely tavern half-a-mile down in the valley behind the
rocca. There they took up their abode, and thence Julia climbed up
to the rocca during the first two days; but on the third day a
different arrangement was come to, and Julia took up her residence
in the abbe's room on the first floor of the fortress, Lady Wisden
remaining at the tavern in the valley. Meanwhile, in that little
room under Julia's, Hartwell's deliriums went on.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>XIX. &mdash; HARTWELL MAKES A
PLUNGE</h2>

<p class="first">"It is a good thing that it is not but during the
day that you are with him," said Dulaunay to Julia: "from one to
four o'clock in the morning he is even violent."</p>

<p>They were seated in a square well under a sycamore tree, which
stood in the space between the two barracks, and the sun was at
noon, burning the stones in the court-yard hot. Julia was dressed
in plain grey and white; purposely, perhaps, looking like a nurse,
with the softest light moss of hair protruding from under the edges
of her cap. Her attendance at the bedside had made her lips look
still dryer than usual, and had paled to a mere vision of color the
fruity dry carmine with which her cheeks were brushed a little.</p>

<p>"Is it ever going to stop?" she asked; "and are Kinney and Calvo
really good men? This is the sixth day, and the temperature still
at 105."</p>

<p>"He will not die, have no fear," said the count: "but it will be
a struggle. Last night he was alarming and amusing at the same
time, oh, la, la! It is some years ago he had a vexing accident in
a motor-car, and of this, not for the first time, he raved. At one
moment it was the perplexity the most acute depicted on his visage:
'Am I Hartwell?' said he, 'Or am I "Draytong"?' His perplexity!
that made me smile. 'The faces are one,' said he, 'how if the
natures be one also? and which of the two am I, am I?' At another
moment it was the agitation the most breathless, the staring eyes,
the sighs, the hoarse whispers, <i>mon Dieu</i>! 'I will change the
clothes, I will change the clothes,' he whispers, dreadfully:
'Hartwell shall be "Draytong", and "Draytong" shall be Hartwell;
the millionaire shall be the beggar, and the beggar the
millionaire; no one on the road, McCalmont dead the coat&mdash;the
waistcoat&mdash;now the collar: the dead know not anything, the
dead know not anything'&mdash;And so on for two hours."</p>

<p>"And what does all that mean? Do you know any Hartwell? That is
the name of his ward, Bobbie."</p>

<p>"No, I know no Hartwell except Bobbie. But thrice when he has
somnambulated I have heard him employ that name of Hartwell. There
is here that which is droller than you think."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I know not how I mean: but I will apply my mind there. There
are things which have perplexed me. Is it not droll, for example,
the infinite difference in physique, in mentality, in all, between
"Draytong" and his brother, Oswald?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is a rather queer story. Their mother was frightened
with a gun on board a ship by some splendid madman, named&mdash;I
forget what&mdash;some time before James' birth; and when James
grew up he turned out to be like this splendid man, while Oswald is
like his father."</p>

<p>The subject then dropped between them, these ravings of Hartwell
falling for the present from the surface of their minds like water
from a duck's back, without finding any root there, seeming to be
mere ravings and nothing else; but in the case of Dulaunay, the
still unexplained mystery of his relation with Hartwell was too
astonishing, and he had heard those ravings too near and often to
forget them entirely; when, at a later day, circumstances recalled
them to his mind, and forced him to reflect on them, he not only
remembered them clearly, but understood them thoroughly, as we
shall see.</p>

<p>"Well, that explains it," he said now to Julia.</p>

<p>"Oh, there comes the abbe," said Julia. "I'm afraid he, too, is
a little in love with me."</p>

<p>Already, within the last twenty minutes the chef had peeped
round the corner of the barrack-house after Julia to see where she
was; and now also came the abbe, peeping after her, saying that the
one o'clock dinner was served.</p>

<p>Nothing could be quainter than that life up there in the rude
little rocca, and when Hartwell's crisis was once past, Julia was
constantly amused by it. There were seven males and she, beside a
very young nurse from Siena, and the consciousness of the seven was
turned at all moments toward the one, as sunflowers follow the sun;
the fact of Julia's presence fully occupied every mind; the chef
cooked for her, the abbe talked at her, Dr Kinsey giggled toward
her; and in this mental mood their existence up in the rocca went
on as remote from the present age as the voyagers to the moon of M.
Jules Verne, living in their steel box in the midst of space.</p>

<p>The moschio was a squat low tower which stood sheer over a
precipice a thousand feet deep, upon which it looked by the one
small window of Hartwell's room, and by no other. From some little
distance off it looked almost as much like a piece of the mountain
as like the work of man. The moat, or ditch, round the moschio was
crossed by a drawbridge, then came some outhouses, barracks, and
paved courts, with the well under its sycamore tree, all shut in by
a fortified wall, which was provided with covered ways and
parapets, to protect the defenders in a siege: outside this
fortified wall was a larger drawbridge, called the "outer
drawbridge," which crossed the outer ditch.</p>

<p>Julia and the count followed the abbe into the moschio to
dinner. At table the talk was mostly with the abbe, a man of stale
and wandering eye, with nothing to do but bask in the sun, and once
a day fuddle himself with muscat wine. "I could have been anything,
madame," he would say to Julia in very Italian French: "preacher
(predicateur)! architect! statesman! cardinal! in short&mdash;any
thing. Yes, my talents were made to declare themselves. But in the
rocca, what scope? In the barrack yonder I was born, and here I am
destined to close my eyes."</p>

<p>This was the abbe's grievance, that he could have been anything,
if only he and all things else had been different.</p>

<p>Of a moonlit evening sometimes all was interest, laughter, and
"bravos" in the courtyards, when everyone came to watch Dulaunay
and the graceful Julia fencing with two maple sticks; or when the
sun set behind Siena and the hills, they two talked together on the
parapets, or on the well, or strolled down by the chestnut lane and
the vines running in the hedges over a carpet of yellow and purple
maple-flowers to the tavern where Lady Wisden wearily dreamt of
Ascot.</p>

<p>"It looks as if to-morrow will be my last day," said Julia one
evening, when Hartwell had passed from delirium into a state of
coma.</p>

<p>"How!" exclaimed the count: "you go?"</p>

<p>"The moment he becomes conscious, of course," she replied.</p>

<p>"But why? I understand nothing there. Does not "Draytong" adore
you? He pronounces your name always&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But surely you know that Mr Drayton is married?"</p>

<p>"But not married? "Draytong" is not married!"</p>

<p>"He is, Emile."</p>

<p>"Not possible. Where, then, is that Mrs "Draytong"?"</p>

<p>"Ah, the 'where' is the least of her. She is somewhere, and may
she live long. I myself have never quite believed it, but three
mornings ago I heard, him say: 'the wife&mdash;is she mine, or his?
I have no wife but one'&mdash;whatever that may mean."</p>

<p>"There is something very droll somewhere," mused Dulaunay: "I
understand nothing there. I know "Draytong" very well, he would
not, he could not, have affianced himself to you, if he was
married."</p>

<p>"He did though, Emile,"&mdash;Julia said in a low voice with a
hung head, "yes, he did that to me."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>! but this is an infamy!" exclaimed the worthy
count. "I am afraid that this good gentleman will have to cross
swords with me when he re-establishes himself."</p>

<p>"And yet you pretend to be my friend. Don't be extravagant,"
said Julia.</p>

<p>"But how! I understand nothing there, then! Did you not find it
difficult to pardon such a conduct?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I! no, quite easy. Don't you understand?&mdash;till seventy
times seven. And remember that he did not let me marry him: he was
tempted, he yielded, but he pulled up in time, like a brick. Better
not go crossing swords with him, for, if you were to hurt him, you
know that you can't parry my flanconnade attack."</p>

<p>"Ah! to be the man beloved like that, and by you, adorable
Julia!" sighed the count. "But then since it is so, why not rest at
the rocca?"</p>

<p>"As if I dared! I owe that much to myself, and I have solemnly
promised Aunt Margaret, not to stay. And you are never to let him
know, Emile, that I was ever near the rocca. Promise me that. I had
better go to-morrow before dinner."</p>

<p>But the next morning after chocolate, she being then with
Hartwell for about the last time, he knew her. The room was small
and very dim to her after the boundless light outside, for she had
been outside in the courtyards after her chocolate before coming to
relieve Dulaunay at the bedside, and Hartwell's room had only one
small, deep window in the wall over the precipice, through which
not much light came in. Dulaunay was out in the courts in his
shirt-sleeves to take a breath of air after his watch before going
to bed. The little nurse and Dr Kinsey were in their respective
rooms, and Julia was alone with Hartwell. Hartwell lay quiet, the
picture of muscular waste, on a square, squat bed, with a wooden
tester, and no curtains; he had so far seemed to recognise no one.
Julia poured out some digitalis into a glass at a stone table, and
was going to present it to his lips when she started violently; he
had turned over to his left side had been looking at her. She saw
humor, intelligence, in his eyes, spilled some of the medicine,
stood in stone, and suddenly fled from the room.</p>

<p>She hurried out in great agitation to Dulaunay in the yard,
saying: "It has happened! I am sure he has noticed me, and I should
have given anything&mdash;! Go to him, will you? And Pini must be
told&mdash;about the cart. I shan't stay another minute, not even
in the valley, nor in Siena, nor in Italy&mdash;I turned towards
him to give him the digitalis, and, good gracious! there was he
looking side ways, with his left, eye all wrinkled up and smiling!
What shall I do now, Emile? It is so agonisingly delicate!"</p>

<p>"Come," said Dulaunay, calmly, "go make your trunk, and I will
tell Pini, rouse Kinsey to stay with him, and go down with you to
the valley."</p>

<p>"No, you are too tired. But isn't it vexing? I never felt so
mean"&mdash;and off she ran into the moschio faster than he could
follow, and hurried up the hopelessly-worn stone steps to her room,
where she at once cast her odds and ends pell-mell into a
portmanteau, and locked it. She then sat down on a cypress coffer,
that had lovely little glances of gilt among its rough carving,
waiting with alert ears for Pini or for Dulaunay to come. Hearing a
rumbling of wheels, she ran to the one window of her room, which
looked down upon the yard of the moschio, and saw the mule cart
coming over the inner drawbridge. The little Pini, who was called
"the facchino," then ran up to her, lifted the portmanteau on his
back, and she saw him place it on the cart in the yard. She then
caught up her hat and hurried to an alcove to pin it on, for in the
alcove there was a mirror on an altar, half hiding two blue and
gilt frescoes of angels in old canopied frames; but when she had
pinned on the hat, she stood uncertain, hesitating, partly waiting
for Dulaunay, and partly for she knew not what.</p>

<p>Presently the count came in a flurry, saying in an earnest and
secret voice: "He has spoken&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not of me, Emile," said Julia.</p>

<p>"Yes, of you; 'Tell her,' he has said, 'that she should not go,
without saying me adieu.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, you told him that I was going!" said Julia with
reproach.</p>

<p>"He asked it! and I replied: 'Her portmanteau is even now on the
cart.' Then, after a long time, he said: 'She should not go without
saying me adieu.'"</p>

<p>Julia shrunk from him, and stood waiting in silence for her mind
to speak to her and suggest something, then, subsiding into a chair
at her table, she supported her cheek on two fingers of her right
hand, gazing fixedly at Dulaunay ten minutes, lost in a
pre-occupation which did not hear one word of his running chatter
of advice.</p>

<p>"Tell him no!" she said suddenly, with determined lips: "tell
him no."</p>

<p>"Well, if that is your will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, tell him no."</p>

<p>He started off, she started stealthily after him, and caught him
at the head of the stairs with the whisper: "Let me know quickly
what he says," then back to her room with like stealthiness she
ran, and stood at the window, waiting and looking out, without
seeing the cart under her eyes, nor hearing the blithe little Pini
whistling like a thrush.</p>

<p>A long and trying interval now passed for her, full of emptiness
and mystery, for Dulaunay did not return in a hurry, and she could
not guess what could possibly keep him. The hour grew from nine to
ten, then to ten thirty. Julia paced about the room, peeped and
listened at the door, bent down her ear towards the flooring, which
separated her from Hartwell's room below: but there was no
sound.</p>

<p>At last, however, the count came, yawning even as he dashed up
the little stairs, for he was very sleepy.</p>

<p>"Why, what could possibly have kept you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"He would not let me depart!" protested Dulaunay. "After a long
reflection he gave me a message, but immediately changing of
advice, he said: 'No, let me not again be rash: you must wait,
Dulaunay.' Then, after another long reflection, he said again:
'Tell her that, if she leave me thus suddenly, I shall surely
die.'"</p>

<p>"Surely die?" breathed Julia, shrinking palely, with suspended
breath: "why should he surely die? Tell him&mdash;I owe it to
myself&mdash;No, he won't surely die, no he won't. Tell him no, he
won't Emile!"</p>

<p>"Good! but I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you tell him that. Tell him no, he won't no, he won't. He
has no right to send such messages! Say just as I bid you, word for
word: say, no, he won't: and then&mdash;let me hear."</p>

<p>Away, therefore, ran Dulaunay like Mercury, destined to little
sleep that day; and again Julia waited a wearily long time at the
window, opening and shutting many times an old ivory casket with
evanescent glints of gilt among its carvings.</p>

<p>The fact was that Hartwell had fainted, or sunk into an
exhausted sleep, when Dulaunay returned to him from Julia. The
little nurse, roused prematurely from sleep, had not yet come down,
and Dulaunay, every moment expecting Hartwell to come to, could not
leave him. After half an hour of impatient waiting on the part of
the drowsy count, the nurse came down, and he then sent her up to
tell Julia that Hartwell had fainted. Julia pouted and waited.</p>

<p>When Hartwell at last opened his eyes, he said in a feeble
voice:</p>

<p>"Well, what does the lady say?"</p>

<p>"That good lady says that you will not die, sir," replied
Dulaunay, "and she attends your response."</p>

<p>Hartwell pondered that answer and the whole situation with a
piercing and crafty eye; anon he drew his brows together with his
fingers in a painfulness of thought.</p>

<p>He had her there; he had opened his eyes and found her there;
and now he felt her slipping from him. In his feebleness of body
and mind he felt an absolute lack of grit to face the cheerlessness
which she would leave behind her when she went away. All his craft
and sagacity, therefore, were at work.</p>

<p>"What response must I bear her, sir?" asked Dulaunay: "she waits
to go, and I who have not slept must accompany her to the
valley."</p>

<p>"You must wait; let me think," answered Hartwell.</p>

<p>There came in an odor of the one o'clock dinner from the hall,
for the table was served. The abbe ran up to tell Julia that there
were truffled pates which she liked, but she would not stir to come
down, for the dinner table was too near to Hartwell's door. The
others ate their dinner, sending up meantime plates of food to her,
but she did not eat anything. The count dined sitting in her chair,
and had not quite finished when Hartwell called him.</p>

<p>Then the lingering interchange of messages went on.</p>

<p>Hartwell prayed her to stay three days.</p>

<p>She sent to ask: Why so?</p>

<p>It was in order that his recovery might become more
definite.</p>

<p>But that was no reason, Julia answered: he must know that that
was hardly generous to tempt and trifle with her, yet he did it; he
was taking advantage of her foibles and of her position; his
recovery would become definite in any case.</p>

<p>The afternoon shadows lengthened; the portmanteau lay on the
cart; the mule's head hung; Hartwell groaned on his bed; the worthy
and excellent Dulaunay plied up and down the stairs like the
messenger of the gods; Julia from time to time proudly absorbed the
moisture that stung her eyes; her throat was dry and aching, but
she was unconscious of that fact; she stood near the window, rather
haggard at the long strain of the duel.</p>

<p>Would she not see him to say goodbye? then she might go: so
Hartwell sent to say.</p>

<p>No: that was hardly a frank and fair request, Julia replied.</p>

<p>Would she not wait three days, in order that he might weigh a
communication which he had to make to her?</p>

<p>No: let him make the communication now.</p>

<p>He could not now.</p>

<p>Then she would go; she owed it to herself.</p>

<p>Well, then, if she would go, she might go.</p>

<p>So at last, near five in the afternoon, the protracted campaign
was over. Julia dashed a passionate tear from her eyes, and
descended with a veiled face on Dulaunay's arm. Hartwell's door lay
wide open, and he saw her hurry through the sala. She did not
glance his way at all. The cart rolled away at last with the
portmanteau, Julia and Dulaunay walked across the inner court over
the inner drawbridge, and yonder by the barrack-house saw the chef
and abbe lying in wait to say their adios.</p>

<p>But before Julia had quite come to where the chef and abbe
waited for her, Dr Kinsey came running after out of the moschio,
bearing yet a mes sage from Hartwell: if she would go to him, he
would make now the communication which, as he had said, he had to
make.</p>

<p>She looked appealingly to Dulaunay, saying: "What can one
do?"</p>

<p>The count pressed her hand. And all at once she was hurrying
back to the moschio.</p>

<p>She went into Hartwell's room, without quite closing the door
behind her.</p>

<p>She stood a yard from the bed with the Veil over her face; and
she said: "I am here, James."</p>

<p>They were alone; he was lying on his side; his back was turned
toward her; and for some time he did not answer. At last he said,
without turning toward her:</p>

<p>"It was not true what I told you, Julia. I am not married."</p>

<p>Julia stood blanched, breathing heavily; his words were so
immense, had in them such a world of life and salvation and
happiness for her, that they did not at once find room for
themselves in her mind. At last she cried out imperatively:</p>

<p>"Oh, tell the God's-truth, if you love me!"</p>

<p>"No, I am not married," said Hartwell. "I married when I was a
youth of nineteen, but my wife died seventeen years ago. That is
the God's truth."</p>

<p>It was really, as we know, the truth; the good Julia was too
willing to believe to doubt; and now she broke down, taking his
wasted big hand, kissing it alternately on the palm and on the
back, trying to say between her sobs: "Thank you, thank you, James,
thank you," as to one who had saved her life. Dulaunay and the
abbe, who were just outside the door, could clearly hear that meek
outpouring of her gratitude, her sobs and gasps, and her continued
"Thank you, dear James," uttered in the tone of a penitent child,
as she kissed and re-kissed his hand, and the strain of all that
day and the pent-up grief of years broke through all restraint, and
had rent. Then she half-lay on the bed with him, and for some time
her sobbings, more smothered, but more regular and confirmed, came
out from her buried head, and were heard by the two men
outside.</p>

<p>Two tears rolled down Dulaunay's face; but he dried his eyes,
shrugged his shoulders with "So much the better," went up, threw
himself upon his bed, and at once went to sleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>XX. &mdash; HARTWELL GOES TO
CORTON</h2>

<p class="first">Hyde Park was in young leafage, a blush of colour
was in Piccadilly and Dover Street, the clubs were fast filling,
and the first bazaar and floral fete had come off, before the date
fixed for the marriage of Julia and Hartwell&mdash;the second of
June&mdash;arrived.</p>

<p>Julia's side had claimed some delay in view of the comedy of
engagement, breach, semi-reconciliation, then breach again, and now
again engagement, with the two men who passed as one. Society
needed time to digest such a menu. Hence, Hartwell having
definitely risen from his illness in December, no date earlier than
the following June would be permitted.</p>

<p>No one any more recognised Julia, she was so victoriously
established in happiness. To doubt Hartwell's oath that he was not
married never, of course, entered her thoughts. His statement to
her four years before that he was married was put down to any
reason that first presented itself to the mind, or was not thought
of at all.</p>

<p>Julia attributed it in her own mind to an unselfish whim of
Hartwell, who, she thought, wanted her to make a higher match, more
suitable to her rank; when she asked him if this were not so, he
seemed to assent. The oath made in the little room of the rocca at
Siena was too rose-coloured to be untrue; not only herself, but her
aunts, her brothers, and all her friends, took it for granted that
it was true beyond question. Therefore, in that "sunshiny dale,"
where, according to Hartwell, Julia's "smile resided," the sun
never now set&mdash;it was a land "where it seemed always
afternoon." Hartwell, for his part, took his joy physiologically,
but his eye danced. He had yielded to the great temptation, the
thing was done, there could be no drawing back now. Hartwell,
therefore, shut his eyes to everything, compelled his memory to
forget "the wife," and also to forget that he was not James
Drayton; and though a pang of doubt, of panic, anon stopped for a
moment the beating of his heart, still, on the whole, he was deeply
happy.</p>

<p>Julia and Lady Wisden had returned to England in the
<i>Sempronia</i> a month before Hartwell; and only two days after
their arrival at Brook Street, Oswald Drayton presented himself
before Julia with the face of a man who has screwed himself to a
sublime and solemn effort.</p>

<p>He did not know that Julia had even seen his good James abroad:
and Oswald renewed to her his offer of marriage.</p>

<p>This seemed to her, and indeed was, mere mania. She looked at
him with a certain insolent happiness&mdash;with a puckered brow
and smiling lips&mdash;as a something zoological, his quixotism was
played with such solemnity; then she could not resist, for his
continued gravity tickled some nerve in her&mdash;she laughed. When
she could speak, she asked him to excuse her levity, but said she
had thought that it was written legibly all over her that she was
going to be the wife of someone else whom he knew.</p>

<p>Oswald went away from her that day with something new and living
in his stale mind; a new and vital hatred. It seemed to him that he
now for the first time knew what spite was, a spite in which he
included Julia, as well as his supposed brother. What he now
thought of was the Gissings, with a new longing, a new zeal of
discovery. Where, then, in the world were those three people?
Beyond doubt the ruffian James had committed a brutal murder, and
Oswald in his impotence could not prove it.</p>

<p>When Hartwell returned, Oswald stuck to him. There was still the
hope, frail as a straw to a drowning man, almost frailer, that
James might be led on to "reason" about Letty's death with that
same bravado which he had before displayed; he might, though it was
impossible, just possibly tell too much; so hope, hoping against
common sense, whispered to Oswald. Oswald broached the subject
several times. But Hartwell had lost interest in the matter, and
rather brushed it aside.</p>

<p>One day, however, Hartwell discussed it.</p>

<p>Oswald that forenoon had boon riding his old trotting-park cob
in the Row, and there met Julia and Bobbie Hartwell and her
brother, Lord Archie Linaker: he had afterwards ridden home with
Julia to Brook Street, to lunch with her; but just as they arrived
at the house in Brook Street, in came the little Looloo from a
promenade with her nurse, looking so lovely, that Julia at once
conceived a family-descent upon Hartwell for lunch, that she might
parade Looloo before her lover; and in half-an-hour they set out in
the carriage, Julia looking like a charming dream in heliotrope
voile, with a large picture-hat which could not be described, and
with her went Oswald, Lady Wisden, and the pretty Looloo.</p>

<p>They found Hartwell in a silk jacket and a skull-cap in the
laboratory at the back of the first-floor, with his bared right arm
red to the elbow in blood, he being now almost well again, though
somewhat yellow under his coarse freckles. Lunch was already
served, and in that jacket he first lunched with the party, and
afterwards took Julia back to the laboratory, where he was alone
with her for some time, showing her different objects of interest,
such as the still-beating heart of a dead frog, a protozoon under
the microscope, a headless Lancelot "whose goul was a spine," and
Hartwell explained to her how and why the "immortality of the soul"
is a "groundless thesis of the childhood of man," so that the
admirable Julia, who had come to the lunch an immortelle, went away
rather a sun-flower. With all this talk, there was no word of love
between them, no contact of the hands. Their "engaged manner" was
not demonstrative. If by chance some evening their lips touched, it
was in one of those sudden tempests in which, as in the typhoon,
the elements seem to groan; but that hardly ever happened. Usually
they lowered their eyes, suppressed the mutiny of their bosom, and
waited. But that day when he put her into the carriage, Hartwell
kissed her gloved hand; and just this little act made the corners
of Oswald's square jaws, who was looking on from the outer hall,
stiffen and rib themselves with bitterness.</p>

<p>When Hartwell returned into the house, Oswald followed him into
the morning-room. They were alone in the house, for Dulaunay was
temporarily in Paris, and Bobbie Hartwell was living in chambers in
St. James'. Hartwell, as they talked, was half sitting on the edge
of the table, with his two hands in his trouser-pockets, watching
two sparrows among the hyacinths in the window garden: it was
suddenly summer; a branch of lilac in bloom brushed the window
pane; but there was still a fire in the grate, which seemed to
blink at all this unusual new light; and near the fire stood Oswald
a little behind Hartwell.</p>

<p>"I was wondering, Jimmy, by the way," said Oswald presently,
"whether you had thought any more about the case of that poor
murdered girl?"</p>

<p>"Which murdered girl?" asked Hartwell&mdash;"Ah, I remember;
Letty Barton. But why ply me with such a matter, as though I were a
specialist in that sort of research?"&mdash;the last three words
perished in an exhaustive great yawn, which dragged the poor Oswald
into its abyssmal mood, making him too, half-yawn&mdash;"I have
almost forgotten the details."</p>

<p>"Forgotten? Really? So soon?" said Oswald. '"But in a few
minutes you once threw more light on the matter than all the police
and people in a year. That's why I ask you. There's one point, too,
which I think, I didn't mention; a shred of the letter which she
wrote to her lover's other lover has been found. Don't you think
that might be a clue to hang the ruffian, James?"</p>

<p>"Surely. But why didn't you mention that before? Where was the
shred found?"</p>

<p>"In&mdash;on&mdash;well, on the ground where the tragedy
happened."</p>

<p>Oswald lacked the audacity to say "in the lover's coat-pocket,"
and Hartwell wondered vaguely, "Why did he stammer?"</p>

<p>"And where is that shred?" asked Hartwell.</p>

<p>"I myself have, it."</p>

<p>"It was not, then, found by the police?"</p>

<p>"No, by my private, agent, who gave it me."</p>

<p>"Singular. Let me see it."</p>

<p>Oswald produced it, and Hartwell, reaching aside for a
magnifying-glass on a side-table, looked through it at "cruel bru"
lying on his palm, thinking, as he looked: "This fragment of paper
was never found on the ground: either he to me, or his agent to
him, has therefore lied for some reason; probably he to
me&mdash;from the stammer; I suppose of no importance&mdash;" He
said aloud after an examination of the shred, which lasted several
minutes:</p>

<p>"Well, what, does this fragment reveal to you, Oswald?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Does it reveal things?"</p>

<p>"A more proper question," said Hartwell, "would be, is there
anything which it does not reveal?&mdash;to a consciousness
sufficiently large. It seems to reveal at least, firstly, that the
letter was torn into shreds by the murderer himself: secondly, that
the other shreds are still probably in some pocket of that
murderer: and thirdly, that it should not be difficult to discover
that pocket, and so end your researches."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Oswald, with bated breath, and again, "yes?"</p>

<p>Hartwell, suddenly looking at his watch, said:</p>

<p>"I have to go out, I must go and dress. Come up to my bedroom
with me, and we will discuss it there."</p>

<p>He then returned the shred to Oswald, and they went up, Oswald
following him greedily, hastening, alas, to his own ruin, and not
dreaming it, but full of a vague expectancy, of a hope against
hope, that this mad murderer would reveal all his own crime.</p>

<p>In the bedroom Hartwell threw off his working jacket, and began
to dress; and even as he put on his boots, or buttoned his collar,
or washed his hands, he went on speaking of Letty Barnes.</p>

<p>"She seems to have been a girl of specially strong physique." he
said, "this shred rather proves it. You knew her&mdash;am I not
right?"</p>

<p>"I daresay you are. Er&mdash;would it entertain you to look on
her photograph, my good James?"</p>

<p>"Show me."</p>

<p>Oswald slowly picked the photograph from a neatly-bound packet
of papers, gave it to Hartwell, and looked to see at least one
twitch of Hartwell's face: but of course, he saw nothing of the
kind.</p>

<p>"This, then, is she, poor unfortunate," said Hartwell, studying
the photograph; "I seem to have seen a face somewhere which she
recalls to me"&mdash;he meant Barnes, Letty's father&mdash;"but
can't remember where. Well, her eyes look out bravely and cheerily
enough, poor girl. The shred which you have shown me shows that it
was not pulled off from the letter in the course of the struggle,
but one torn when the letter was being torn up by the
murderer."</p>

<p>"Where and why did he tear it up, James?"</p>

<p>"He tore it up, apparently, on the very spot where the tragedy
took place and as to why, there could have been only one
reason&mdash;an exhaustion of body and therefore of mind,
approaching sheer imbecility; the idiot seems to have been about to
commit the folly of throwing the shreds upon the winds, but
recollected himself in the nick of time, and put them into his
pocket: put all of them, by the way, not all but one, as you said,
my friend."</p>

<p>"Your certainty is very curious&mdash;" began Oswald, who was
slowly pacing about in one part of the room.</p>

<p>"But why so very curious?" protested Hartwell; "this impression
of yours is merely an illusion of a more or less hibernating
consciousness, if I may say so; you had only to open your eyes, and
examine the shred in order to be quite as certain as I am. If it
had been a shred pulled off in the struggle we should most probably
have had a shred pulled from an edge, but this is a triangular
shred, with pretty straight edges, but no smooth edge, a part of
the middle of the letter, torn when the letter was being
deliberately torn up. But torn up by whom? By her, perhaps? No! for
the night was rainy&mdash;observe the running of the ink on the
shred, probably dark then, perhaps windy; even supposing that it
was not windy, the shreds would have been more or less scattered,
if she had torn up the letter and thrown them abroad, and a man
fresh from her murder would have fled rather than submit himself to
the discomfort of searching for them, each and all, in the dark!
five, three at least one, would have been found afterwards; but
none, I say, were found."</p>

<p>"But I said, my good fellow, that one of the shreds was found on
the ground."</p>

<p>"Your agent has misinformed you as to that; I don't know with
what motive, but with a motive which, you should warn him, Oswald,
it may not be difficult to find out. That shred has never lain on
the ground through a rainy night, I will swear; it was put into the
murderer's pocket with the others when he tore up the letter, and
then recollected himself; and that brings me to my second point,
that those others are still probably in some pocket of the
murderer&mdash;not in the same pocket, I think, into which he put
them on the scene of the murder, but in another pocket, to which he
transferred them in a day or two after the murder&mdash;during
which transference the shred which you hold was either dropped on
the ground, or more probably left behind in the original pocket. In
that second pocket, and nowhere else, I believe, that the other
shreds still are; and I will now give you the evidence offered by
the shred, which leads me to think so."</p>

<p>Hartwell at the moment when he said this was washing his hands,
his back turned towards Oswald, who was pacing the other end of the
room before a large wardrobe Henri Quatre; in a narrow compartment
of this wardrobe hung McCalmont's coat, prominently among other
clothes, where it had hung forgotten for over four years&mdash;that
coat of McCalmont which Hartwell had put on the day after the
murder and the motor-car accident, since Drayton's coat had been
too soiled with blood to be worn.</p>

<p>Now Hartwell had just virtually told Oswald that the shreds of
Letty's letter were in this coat&mdash;told him, for what to
Hartwell was reasoning, to Oswald was mere information given, most
strangely given, but still heard with Oswald's ears; and Oswald
suddenly became quite gaunt with agitation, for by reaching out his
hand he could take the shreds, if they were in that lower pocket of
the coat which lay outermost and near his hand. And "'James" was
washing his hands, not looking, his back turned; in a thousand
years such a chance might not recur to Oswald; and as Hartwell
began to tell why he concluded that the shreds had been transferred
from one pocket to another on the day following the crime, Oswald
rose to the occasion, and, looking away at Hartwell's back, put out
a stealing hand sideways, felt the shreds in a lidless envelope in
the pocket, and was about to take them, when Hartwell spun round.
Oswald snatched away his hand quickly from the pocket, without
having the shreds.</p>

<p>But Hartwell had seen&mdash;seen in a mirror which stood in a
curtained alcove behind the washstand, and his eye had flashed.</p>

<p>Oswald continued to pace slowly about with his little limp near
the wardrobe, unconscious that he had been seen, while Hartwell now
sat on a settee, saying, "Excuse, me, my good fellow, from
continuing my argument for the moment: these boots pinch"&mdash;and
he proceeded to take off his boots which he had just put on, a
perfectly false train of thought, meantime, going forward in
Hartwell's mind; for what he was thinking was this, whether Oswald
did not suspect that he was not Drayton, whether Oswald was not
hunting for some proof that Hartwell was not Drayton in that coat
worn on the day after the metamorphosis of Hartwell into Drayton;
Oswald's remark at Aylsham about the watch: "Why can you not open
it?" with another remark once made by Oswald: "You are no longer
James Drayton," had never been forgotten by Hartwell; as soon as
the boots were taken off, he walked to the wardrobe in his socks,
opened the other leaf of the wardrobe-door, and standing there with
his back turned to Oswald, opened a little drawer in which he often
kept some bank-notes. Even if Oswald had looked to see, he would
not have seen what was being done, but, all occupied as he was with
his own agitation, he did not look. Hartwell found an envelope
containing bank-notes, drew one of the notes from the envelope,
noticed the "number" of the note, then making a sideward step to
the compartment of the wardrobe containing McCalmont's coat, he
felt in the pocket in which he had seen Oswald's hand, felt the
envelope with the shreds, transferred it quickly from that pocket
to the pocket of another coat hanging there, slipped the envelope
with the notes into the pocket&mdash;where the envelope with the
shreds had been, then, turning round, said to Oswald, "Excuse me, I
must go out; I shall be back in two minutes."</p>

<p>The room had two doors opening upon a corridor. Hartwell walked
to the one more remote from the wardrobe, near which Oswald was
pacing, and with the deftness of a thief quickly drew out the key
from the key-hole without seeming to pause a moment in going out;
then, slamming the door after him, he went out, and now at once he
flew noiselessly in his socks over thick carpet along the corridor
to the stair, saw a servant girl coming up the stair, beckoned to
her eagerly with his finger placed on his lips, so that she should
not make a sound, caught her by the arm, and hurried her to the
bedroom door; he first stooped and peeped himself through the
keyhole from which he had removed the key, saw Oswald at the
wardrobe, then pushed the girl's head downwards to the keyhole,
whispering: "Peep to wards the wardrobe," then peeped himself
again, and saw Oswald smuggle the envelope into his pocket.
Hartwell then whispered to the girl "Go away," and he re-entered
the room.</p>

<p>Now, when Oswald had first put his hand into the pocket of
McCalmont's coat, he had felt that there was only one envelope in
it, an envelope which contained some shreds; and he now undoubtedly
believed that was the same envelope which he had put into his
pocket.</p>

<p>Hartwell put on again those same boots that "pinched," all
unnoticed by Oswald, who was far too wildly preoccupied to notice
anything, and too eager to be gone with the precious shreds; and
presently, as Hartwell continued to dress, Oswald said, looking at
his watch, "I must go, James."</p>

<p>"I shan't detain you three minutes, if you will wait for me,"
said Hartwell. "You will thus save your cab fare."</p>

<p>He now rapidly finished off his dressing. The supposed brothers
went out together. In Addison-road Oswald put up his hand to a
passing hansom to stop it, but Hartwell would not take it, saying
that he wanted a four-wheeler. "But why so?" asked Oswald. Hartwell
replied that he had a reason. They walked a little way, till a
four-wheeler came along, when they got in, and drove towards
Holland Park. The afternoon was like a summer holiday, full just
there of leafage in maturity, and with the cries of little
birds.</p>

<p>Oswald's nose, which had been as white as death, was now
somewhat less white, and he smiled, saying by way of
conversation:</p>

<p>"I am having that shooting-box at Corton Chantry looked after,
Jimmy, as you said I might."</p>

<p>"Ah, I sometimes have weaknesses, I fear, Oswald," replied
Hartwell.</p>

<p>"But surely that was months ago that I gave you permission to do
that&mdash;to me it seems years. Isn't it done yet? You are a slow
coach, Oswald."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I am a slowcoach," said Oswald; "I like things
to develop themselves, and come off when they are ripe. People in a
hurry are really hurrying to the grave, and I find life moderately
livable. I shall have Corton finished for September, though.
Perhaps if you tipped me five or six hundreds, Jimmy, that might
help with the repairs."</p>

<p>"Decidedly that would help," said Hartwell; "let doubt be
dismissed as to that. But being on the eve of marriage, I am
thinking of curbing my prodigalities."</p>

<p>The corners of Oswald's jaw stiffened bitterly, and he said:</p>

<p>"I will ask you again at this hour to-morrow, my good fellow;
and I wager you that you will do it then."</p>

<p>"But, Oswald, that is a hard, unbrotherly saying, surely?" cried
Hartwell, loudly. "How is that, then. Oswald? And how much will you
wager, my friend?"</p>

<p>"I'll wager you £500 that you will."</p>

<p>"And I'll wager you £500,000 that I will not, on this favourable
condition to you that, if you lose, sir, you pay nothing, whereas,
if I lose, I pay all. Stop, cabman! Here&mdash;officer&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The cab stopped; a policeman who was standing near by came to
the door.</p>

<p>"I have to charge this gentleman with a felony," said Hartwell
to the officer. "He has just stolen the sum of £700 in notes from
the pocket of a coat in my house; he has them now on his person. I
can swear to the number of at least one of them, and he was seen in
the act both by myself and one of my servants."</p>

<p>Oswald could not answer. He put his hand into his pocket and
felt the notes in the envelope; he was like a dead man, if death
could utter sighs of disgust and woe.</p>

<p>The officer got into the four-wheeler&mdash;it was in order for
him to have room for him that Hartwell had refused to take a
two-wheeler-and they drove to the High Street police station. The
charge was taken. Hartwell gave the "number" of the note; it was
found on Oswald. Oswald could not be bailed, the case being a
felony; and when he was being taken to a cell the poor Oswald
uttered a deplorable little giggle of delirium.</p>

<p>That night Hartwell had to deliver a lecture on the "Ions of
Electrolysis" at the Royal Institution, and after the lecture to go
to visit Julia. He delivered the lecture, but sent an excuse to
Julia, shrinking from seeing her during the first flush of the
disgrace; but late in the night he received from her this
telegram:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">"IS IT TRUE? FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, AND MINE, SPARE
POOR OSWALD, IF AWFUL NEWS BE TRUE. TO ME INCREDIBLE. PRAY COME
EARLY TO LUNCH TO-MORROW. MY LOVE. JULIA."</p>
<br>

<p>The news, then, had already got about. Hartwell's eyes flashed
severely; he had warned Julia years ago that he was hard, that he
was not one of the "sparing" sort. He meant to damp Oswald
Drayton's zeal for research.</p>

<p>The next forenoon he drove with the servant who was his witness
to the court. Oswald sat in the dock, the picture of sighing, sick
disgust, one side of his upper lip lifted a little, a sight to
pity. The court was rather crowded with ladies and men-about-town,
for the incident caused a three-days' flutter, and may, perhaps, be
still remembered by some readers, since it was not very long ago.
Oswald's advocate earnestly pleaded that the whole thing was a
storm in a tea-cup; the accused was a well-known member of Society,
a man of high honour, as he would call several gentlemen to prove;
he had meant to take from his brother's pocket a letter having no
direct pecuniary value, and had taken another envelope instead. The
magistrate, too, tried hard to smooth down the scandal; but
Hartwell was not to be moved to forgive; he did not find it
"compatible with his duty." The prisoner was sentenced to four
months in Holloway gaol.</p>

<p>When, on the pronouncement of the sentence, a policeman touched
his arm, the unfortunate Oswald went temporarily crazy.</p>

<p>Hartwell still shrank from seeing Julia that day and night of
the trial, and did not go to her: and again the day after the trial
he did not see her, for that morning he received a letter which
caused him to take a journey. The letter was from one Walker, that
same Walker who was Oswald's occasional shorthand man, and doer of
odd jobs; he was down at Corton Chantry, disbursing moneys, and
watching the progress of some work for Oswald; and Walker wrote to
Hartwell:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"Dear Sir,</p>

<p class="letter">"I have just read of the committal of my
employer, Mr Oswald, and as I do not know what to do now about the
repairs on the Pavilion, or even about money for me to get back to
London, I write to ask you what I am to do. You may know that there
are a foreman and five men on the job, which is in a half-finished
state, and I have only a few shillings left out of the current
fund. This savage, Steve Anderson, refuses even to let me sleep in
either of the chalk cottages, if I do not pay down cash every
night. Awaiting your favoured advice. I am, dear sir, yours
faithfully,</p>

<p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">R. Hamilton
Walker</span>."</p>
<br>

<p>Hartwell's eye flashed with anger at his own weakness in
granting a privilege to Oswald, and he had an immediate impulse to
hurry on to Corton and bundle those workmen off the place&mdash;an
impulse which would no doubt have passed away had it not been
strengthened by the occurrence of that name "Steve Anderson" in
Walker's letter, a man whom Hartwell had been paying for years
through a bank, without knowing who, what, or where Anderson might
be; and the impulse was further strengthened by his reluctance to
face Julia's reproach for a day or two. He decided to go down to
Corton that same day after lunch.</p>

<p>But he had a strange feeling of depression all that forenoon,
while looking down at a table glittering with wedding presents, he
had one of those brief pangs of doubt and panic which sometimes
turned his heart cold. The wedding was not far off. The bride, who
was a god-daughter of Royalty, had already received two presents
from the Throne.</p>

<p>However, after lunch he started for Corton. In this way things
come strangely about: Hartwell's re-engagement to Julia had roused
Oswald's malice to renewed activity about the tragedy of Letty;
this renewed activity of Oswald had brought about Oswald's ruin:
and Oswald's ruin was the cause of Walker's letter, which in turn
caused Hartwell to go down to Corton where "the Drayton wife" lay
hidden.</p>

<p>Hartwell had told Julia that he was not married; that this was
the God's truth; so that in what awaited him now the worthy and
honest Hartwell was not to be envied.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>XXI. &mdash; HARTWELL FINDS A
WIFE</h2>

<p class="first">It was not without difficulty that Hartwell was
able to penetrate to Corton Chantry; from Felmingham, the nearest
station, it was a long and lonely drive, during which he thought
that this must surely be one of the most thickly-wooded spots in
England, and the journey was made still slower and more gloomy by
the fact that it was raining. However, at about eight in the
evening the basket-chaise, in which he was, arrived at a cottage
from a chimney of which smoke was coming out, and Hartwell alighted
amid the loud excitement of a fox-hound or harrier, and of a
spaniel, at the door.</p>

<p>The cottage was of hard chalk with a red-brown old roof, and was
built in two telescope-pieces, one slightly larger than the other;
it stood almost under a ruin whose proportions could just be made
out in the dark air; some distance away another white cottage with
a red-brown roof could also be made out; and up to the very walls
of the ruin, which stood on a low mound, and to the walls of the
two cottages, thick wood and thicker coppice grew rank.</p>

<p>At the cottage door stood a creature peering out under a lamp at
the chaise, and holding a fowling-piece in one hand; another man
was peeping over his shoulder; and Hartwell, as he alighted, said
to himself: "The man is 'Walker,' and the monster is
'Anderson.'"</p>

<p>"It's him," said Steve Anderson aloud to himself in a voice
whose rumble resembled that of a running anchor chain. "A' knowed
he'd be looking in some fine day."</p>

<p>"Well, Anderson; well, Walker," said Hartwell, going in, and
immediately on his entrance he turned to Walker, saying: "Here,
Walker, is a sovereign; you will go away by the chaise that brought
me."</p>

<p>The room in which he stood was cosy and pleasing, but over-hot
with an applewood fire; it had two windows with crimson moreen
curtains, three wolf-skins on the floor, which was made of hard
earth, and a singing kettle hung up in the fireplace.</p>

<p>"But, sir, am I turned off like this with a sovereign?" asked
Walker, turning pale. "Mr Oswald owes me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, let Mr Oswald pay you, my friend. Go away."</p>

<p>Hartwell stood on a stool at a rude table made of logs, on which
were two unplucked teals and a water-hen, with five or six large
loaves, a black bottle which contained rum, and a small lamp.</p>

<p>"But aren't you going to give me any more, sir, for a fact?"
asked Walker.</p>

<p>"No. Well, now, Anderson, how is everything at Corton?" Walker,
stared at Hartwell, then walked out of the room into an inner one.
Anderson, a mound of misshapen flesh with an expression of face
unmistakably daft, sat over the fire, his back turned to Hartwell,
treating the master with scant ceremony. His arms hung at his sides
as massive as two ordinary legs; his head resembled a mat of rough
hair: he had, moreover, quite the air of a Crusoe; he wore
Wellington boots, and a red shirt open at the breast; and something
shy and untamed in his glance and address told of a wild man who
had long inhabited a world apart, in which any other presence was
an intrusion.</p>

<p>"Aye, a' thought he'd be looking in some fine day," he said when
Walker had gone from the room; "but look 'ee here, ma man, never ye
send the likes o' them meddlers and muddlers here again, flushing
the coverts, and starting the water-fowl&mdash;. Is it me or them,
a'd like to know? It can't be both. One o' them working-men shot
his gun at a young rocketer yesterday, and if a'd er catched him,
a'd er split his head as clean as a log, a' would. And how was I to
be sartin"&mdash;his eyes swam cautiously round&mdash;"that that
there youngster would be getting on the scent o' her?"</p>

<p>It needed an accustomed ear to catch much meaning in that chain
which rumbled in Anderson's voice, but Hartwell heard that word
her. There was a she in the matter, and a secret she.</p>

<p>"Ah," said he, "and how is she?"</p>

<p>Anderson stretched his face closer to Hartwell's, with the grim
whisper:</p>

<p>"She don't scream out any more; but a' had to scorch her hands
at the fire afore she dropped that game."</p>

<p>Who "she" was Hartwell now knew; the word "scream" informed him;
and to his inwards he felt the dart of fate strike coldly,
inflicting a pain at which he could have cried aloud; but he made
no sound; only his lips whitened.</p>

<p>At this moment Walker returned from the inner room with his bag,
and a mackintosh on, saying:</p>

<p>"Well, I shall consider myself very badly used, that's all, Mr
Drayton, between you and your brother&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hartwell flurriedly handed him a ten-pound note, bribing him to
go and leave him alone, for he felt weak and ill. Walker took it,
thanked Hartwell, and went out to the chaise, while Anderson
drained a tumbler of rum, and set his big body before the fire
again.</p>

<p>Hartwell and Anderson heard the chaise roll away amid the
pelting upon the window panes of handfuls of rain, also a noise of
swollen running waters.</p>

<p>"Is 'she' well?" asked Hartwell.</p>

<p>"Same as when you seed her last; only she don't scream out any
more: A' put a stoppage to that game."</p>

<p>The questions were asked in a low voice, but the answers were
given in a tone of indifference.</p>

<p>"You alone know, Anderson?"</p>

<p>"Know what?"</p>

<p>"That she is here."</p>

<p>"H'm! Who else was to know, master?"</p>

<p>"Is she&mdash;weak?"</p>

<p>"She wouldn't be what you might call an ox for strength, ye
know. Ye should give her some clothes, ma man. A' made a camlet
gown for her with my own hands three weeks agone: yes, cut out and
stitched it together myself, A' did, seeing as her hands are shaky
to stitch for herself; the money won't run to more 'n that, A'
doubt: but, come winter, she'll be freezing. A' looked to see you
turn up some fine day afore this."</p>

<p>"Take me there."</p>

<p>"What, now? in the pouring rain?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Anderson got up, took a horn lantern from a number of mattocks,
adzes, and rifles in a corner, lit it, and said: "A'm ready."</p>

<p>But Hartwell, on rising, found that his knees could hardly bear
him; he said: "I will be with you&mdash;" and stood with his palms
on the table leaning on it, with a hanging head.</p>

<p>Anderson waited, and presently Hartwell was able to rouse
himself, and move toward the front door. They then went out. The
ruins were not more than four or five yards from the side of the
cottage. They went up to it by a steep little path covered over
with dripping leafage, and now were within an enclosure of old
walls. Even here there were trees and bush; they felt the rain
still spraying upon them. Anderson went, a little in advance,
swinging the lantern in his hand, with the harrier and the spaniel
at his heels; a few startled birds took to flight or stirred among
the bush, as the two men went forward. Twice Anderson stopped
short, peering earnestly about, but without any sign of fear, and
stamped as if to frighten something away.</p>

<p>They went on darkly in this way&mdash;for the horn lantern gave
little light&mdash;till they came to the north-western part of the
ruins, where there were four old worn steps, with a stone
balustrade to them, leading up to a deep-set door under a Norman
portal, the door itself being modern, and made of rough logs, like
Anderson's table in the chalk cottage. Anderson drew a bunch of
keys from the bagging part of his red shirt, went up the four
steps, and opened the door. Hartwell who was as pale as a dead man,
and trembling all over, followed him. They entered a spacious hall
with a groined roof and a floor made of stone flags, an empty and
hollow place, which re-echoed even the patter of the dogs feet; at
its further end there was another stone stair, steep and narrow
this one, without any balustrade. They walked across the hall to
it, went up, and at the top of the stair Anderson opened a small
Gothic door, which they had to stoop in order to pass through; they
then found themselves on a stone landing, semicircular in shape,
where the lantern showed the foot of a spiral stair which went up
from it to the top of a high tower; and up this stair they now
plodded, going round and up between spiral walls, where the damp
struck cold, and the feet seemed shod with echoes, to another
landing, and then to another, and finally to an old Norman door at
the top, which Anderson opened.</p>

<p>They now went into a good-sized square chamber with a vaulted
roof, and, as they entered it, a rat dropped massively from a table
which stood in the middle of it, and ran away.</p>

<p>"She's yonder, abed," whispered Anderson, pointing to a Gothic
door which stood opposite to the door by which they had come
in.</p>

<p>Hartwell, seeing a key sticking outward in the door to which
Anderson had pointed, walked quickly and quietly to it, and locked
"her" 'in. He then looked round the room by the light of the
lantern. There was a small deal table, without any covering, and on
it was a cup-and-saucer, a crust of bread, and a little lamp, not
burning; under one of the window slits was a small sofa covered
with very faded old pink damask, also a cane lounge, an old oak
chair, an old coffer, and a lot of old torn books on the floor,
nearly filling the hearth; the floor was of uncarpeted wood, very
dislocated so that pieces of it creaked and shook under the
feet.</p>

<p>In the wall which contained "her" chamber door there was another
door through which Hartwell looked, and beckoned to Anderson to
show him what lay beyond it. Anderson went through it with the
lantern into another room and Hartwell followed.</p>

<p>This second room was similar to the first, but had nothing in
it, was windowless, and must therefore have been dark even at noon.
And hero the floor was even more shaky and creaky.</p>

<p>"Does she come here?" whispered Hartwell in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>"Only to pass through to yonder," answered Anderson, pointing to
the further doorway of a cabinet that had once been a bartizan,
with oylets.</p>

<p>There was silence for some minutes, till Hartwell gave utterance
to the terrible words:</p>

<p>"But she owes her life to you, Anderson."</p>

<p>"To me?" said Anderson, showing the brown fangs in his mouth in
a daft sort of laugh.</p>

<p>"Let us not think what might have happened, if you had taken up
two or three of these old boards one night." Hartwell said this in
a base low tone of voice shivering at the same time as if with
intense cold.</p>

<p>"Now, hark at that," said the great hunchback, with his rumbling
voice: "did not you tell me with your own mouth that I worn't never
to go as far as that?"</p>

<p>"I have said so," replied Hartwell, but without expecting to be
obeyed. "I saw that your interest lay in drawing the salary,
without having the work, Anderson."</p>

<p>The daft Anderson scratched his rough head a little under his
deerstalker cap, thinking of it, and the conclusion at which he
arrived was uttered in these words: "A' could use this place for a
apple store, and to put up the marjoram, southernwood, and
artichokes&mdash;. No one would never be the wiser, as for
that."</p>

<p>Hartwell laid his hand on Anderson's shoulder to uphold his weak
knees, and he said, apparently speaking to Anderson, but really to
himself:</p>

<p>"Let each act according to the dictates of a pure reason,
Anderson, in every case. It is the only morality. And do it with
decision, without a tear, I implore you, without one qualm."</p>

<p>He patted the hunchback's arm admonishingly as he said this, and
at the same time the sob of a whole manhood in convulsion broke
from the ill-fated Hartwell.</p>

<p>"A'll do it," said Anderson, "nothing couldn't be easier done.
Not but what A'll be lonesome, for lack o' her, and her poor
harmless ghost 'll be haunting me for a morsel o' bread. But A'
tak' no more notice o' ghosts than o' sparrows: they come and they
go, in broad day sometimes, just to keep ma company; and I tak' no
notice. A'll do it this self-same night."</p>

<p>At these words Hartwell suddenly fled from the hunchback, and
was gone into the outer room, and thence down the dark spiral
stair. Something or other in Hartwell could not quite stand this:
"perhaps it was that non-rational love of righteousness" which he
had "got from his forefathers;" whatever it was, he fled down the
stair like an escaping thief, with a bent back, with white lips
pressed together, and with a wild eye.</p>

<p>To this point fate and pure reason had brought the worthy
Hartwell to murder most foul.</p>

<p>He had sworn to Julia that he was not married: he could not
outrage and massacre that beloved life by marrying her now, while
this woman, lived; and the day after the marriage the existence of
this woman, who was his wife, so long as he was Drayton, might
become known; he had hoped, had permitted himself to believe
blindly, that the woman had somehow thinned into air; let her be
thin, then!&mdash;rather her than Julia.</p>

<p>But she had never hurt him, not wilfully, this already wronged
woman. Hartwell understood that if she suddenly thinned to nothing,
then he would not be happy afterwards; there was even a grumble
somewhere within or without him, which said to him:</p>

<p>"Dare but to lift your little finger against her, Hartwell, and
there is that in Nature which will not fail to bring down your gray
hairs with sorrow to the grave."</p>

<p>Even the robustious Drayton had had pity on her&mdash;had said
"Don't kill;" even the daft Anderson would miss her, and see with
compunction her harmless ghost; was Hartwell, alone, then, to go
ruthlessly, following "reason," calling himself "the best and
choicest kind of man," calling Drayton "ruffian" and "clown,"
though, in fact, he and Drayton were as twin in conduct as they
were in face, when it came to the push?</p>

<p>After wandering at random in unknown paths for some time,
Hartwell butted upon an old wall buried in a spinny, and turned in
a new direction, with the vague purpose of returning to the
cottage; but both the cottage and the ruin were now lost to him. He
did not know where he was, and did not care. The forest here was
primitively savage and profound. There were caverns of bush, little
homes of darkness, full of the stirring of birds, where the pouring
rain penetrated only as a slow dripping. Hartwell did not cease to
wander for hours, wet to the skin through his overcoat, with water
pouring over the rim of his silk hat. About midnight he came to a
Moorish looking lodge or shooting-box, which was called "the
Pavilion," with a portico running all round it, and facing the
forest in all the four directions, with a series of light arches
supported on slender pillars. On one of the pillars, which was
covered with honeysuckle, Hartwell leant his forehead, thinking now
of the old Birmingham works, the purring of the dynamos, and how
well it was with him then; and how he had pitied a man named Ediss
who, happening to touch the switchboard one day, started a little,
and dropped dead&mdash;pitied him then, but envied him now, that
light surprise of death. He could not go to Julia and say: "I am
married after all, though I swore to you, and it would have been
better for you if you had not been born." Nor could he say: "I am
not Drayton; Drayton is married, But I am not Drayton; I am
Hartwell, a working man." Quite so much courage no man had; either
way it seemed to him that she and he, too, would die of shame It
was better that "the wife" should die. Reason sentenced her.</p>

<p>But she, already so wronged, had not done him any harm.</p>

<p>Hartwell's brain ached miserably; seeing a bench in the portico
where he stood, he lay on it, and soon, being wearied out in body
and mind, fell asleep.</p>

<p>He was not long lying there, however, before he was away
sleep-walking in the forest; and, walking in his sleep, Hartwell
had a dreadful vision that night. It seemed to him that Drayton was
walking with him in a wonderland of the dead; the stirrings of the
trees of Corton became a shivering of many grave-clothes in his
dream; the rain drops turned to a sweat of that place; and with
blank eye whites Hartwell groped through a mystery of shadow,
solemner than over entered into any living, happy heart to
conceive. He thought that Drayton said to him: "Act well, Hartwell,
that you may shorten my hell," and that he answered: "Which hell,
Drayton? There is no hell: I am only dreaming," and Drayton seemed
to say again: "Hell is the evil that men do: and the continuance of
that evil in the world is the measure of their hell;" and Hartwell
thought that he asked: "What is it to act well?" and Drayton seemed
to him to make the answer: "To act well is to crush one's self in
the effort to do to others as one would have them do to one." On
this Hartwell dreamed that he said "That is an ancient precept
impossible to fulfil;" to which Drayton seemed to answer:
"Impossible to fulfil, but not impossible to try to fulfil."</p>

<p>Hartwell dreamed that they debated for a long while on that high
plane in such a mood of awe as tongue cannot tell; Drayton's every
word was like a god's to the dreamer's consciousness, never to be
forgotten, and his voice like winds when they surge bleakly and die
away in November. Dreams, however, cannot be told: in the morning
we tell the details of our dreams, and think that we have told the
dream, but any other details would have been equally true, equally
false; the real dream was a mood among the gnomes, a trouble in a
sea shell, or starlight in limbo, and words cannot express all
that. So in a special degree it was with this long dream of
Hartwell's: augustly beyond words he walked and mused in that
strange country, and anyone looking at him would have seen him at
one moment shaken by the fluttering of his breath at his lips, and
at another moment would nave heard him whine thinly. He thought
that he said to Drayton:</p>

<p>"Nature takes the line of least resistance; man is part of
Nature; selfishness is his law. Streams flow downward."</p>

<p>To this Drayton seemed to answer in a very solemn voice:</p>

<p>"Hartwell, they flow upward, all streams, all things, full of
labor they climb, they strain. Could they even incidentally flow
downward, if they had not first climbed high?&mdash;by the toil of
the sun, and the aspiration of the sea, and the achievement of the
clouds."</p>

<p>Hartwell now dreamed that he said to Drayton's ghost: "Are you
really Drayton, or are you only one part of myself talking to
another part of myself? I do not believe in ghosts, with cavernous,
oracular voices. Yet my heart aches at the incubus of your
presence, Drayton; you oppress me, Drayton, to death and the
grave," to which he thought that Drayton answered:</p>

<p>"This is the last time that I shall visit you in your sleep; and
this last time I only pray you to shorten the buccaneer hell which
I have made on the earth, not prolong it by an added scientific
hell of your own."</p>

<p>Hartwell's sleep-walking had now led him into a glade in a
pine-wood, ten or twelve minutes' walk from the Pavilion; in the
middle of the glade was an old well surrounded by ferns; and to
this he happened to walk. When the brickwork stopped him, this
seemed to break the thread of the dream for a time; he groped with
his palms on the well, and then sat on it with his face turned
upward, staring blankly, perhaps more or less conscious of the full
moon which was making her way among dark clouds just over the
opening in the pinewood. The smell of the pines may have come to
his nostrils and soothed him, for what he next dreamed was that he
had rather laid down his arms before the authority of the ghost,
and was saying to Drayton, "But if I crush myself, Drayton, in the
effort to do good to others, what is my reward?" to which the
answer suggested to his mind was, "The reward is happiness, a
kingdom; and unchallengeable authority, though your hair turn grey
with troubles. On that road you shall run and not be weary,
Hartwell: in it all the systems troop, and that flying moon,
see-yonder! seeming to soar on her orbit beyond the flying clouds;
with songs and everlasting joy on her head."</p>

<p>The dream alter this gradually lost definiteness, though it
lasted through other scenes to the time when Hartwell awoke. He was
then lying without a hat, and very bedraggled, under the portico of
the pavilion, to which he had returned from the well. The sun was
well up; before him was a small lawn enclosed by forest, and in the
middle of the lawn was a statue of Pan on a pedestal. He lay for
some time, stiff in the limbs, thinking of his dream, living
through it again, seeing the scenes which he had seen, and hearing
again the words which he had heard. The effect of it upon him was
extraordinary, not only upon his nerves, but upon his memory; for
he found that he could remember the very order in which what he had
said, and what Drayton had said, had been uttered; two or three of
Drayton's phrases seemed to be burned into his brain as only words
heard in dreams can be; anon a subdued groan came from the
prostrate form, as lying there in the portico on his face, Hartwell
reconsidered the universe. What thoughts then passed through
Hartwell's mind? It is useless to follow them, if we could: but his
"pure reason" had brought him to the verge of a terrible deed, and
the conclusion at which he seems to have arrived was that the
Drayton of the vision was his own purer and purest reason, roused
by the disastrous fix in which he now stood, to a debate with his
pure reason; that his cut-and-dry theory of the world was hardly
complete; that there must be some thing inside or outside of the
atoms more than he had accounted for; and that, consequently, his
life must begin afresh. At all events, when he suddenly saw a
workman with a hod and a trowel standing by the statue of Pan on
the lawn, and staring at him, Hartwell sprang to his feet as if
this sight terrified him, and ran past the workman, wildly seeking
the ruin.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>XXII. &mdash; HARTWELL LIES
LOW</h2>

<p class="first">After running up a steep path in the forest,
Hartwell saw Anderson standing with his harrier, spaniel, and
fowling-piece under a tree on the rising ground where the ruin
stood; he joined the hunchback nearly breathless.</p>

<p>"Did you remove the boards from the flooring?" he asked in a
secret and agitated voice.</p>

<p>"A' did," said Anderson, with a nod of the head.</p>

<p>"Give me the keys quickly!"</p>

<p>"Wherever did ye sleep&mdash;?</p>

<p>"The keys!"</p>

<p>Anderson slowly drew them from his shirt: Hartwell caught them
from the hunchback's hand with a severe flash of the eye, and
instantly was running again. He entered the ruin, ran to the door
made of logs, opened it, ran across the empty hall to the flight of
stone steps with the low Gothic door above it, opened that also,
then ran up the spiral stair, never pausing to take breath, till he
reached the top; he then opened the door at the top, and entered
the vaulted room of untooled blocks.</p>

<p>There at the little deal table sat a woman eating porridge out
of a pewter plate&mdash;her breakfast, which Anderson had just
brought her.</p>

<p>The moment her eyes rested upon Hartwell, she uttered a short
cry, and fled with a fluttering sort of motion first toward her own
room, then, with a sudden change of direction, toward the room
where the boards had been removed. Hartwell started after her,
hissing under his breath the word "Stop!" He almost caught her
during the delay while she opened the door, but she was gone again
before he could touch her.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards he was aware of a scream, of an effort to
stop himself, of a life passing beyond his power; and almost
without knowing what he did, he was on his face, half hanging over
an opening in the flooring four feet square, and in his left hand
the woman's left arm and her hanging weight.</p>

<p>For a moment the strain was severe, and the issue doubtful: but
as soon as he had her held by both hands and began to draw her
cautiously up, he found that she was wonderfully light; he got her
to the flooring, picked himself up, and bore her in his arms to the
outer vaulted room; there he laid her on the old pink sofa, and
threw himself upon the lounge to take breath.</p>

<p>She, for her part, had fainted, and with his thoughtful smiling
side-look Hartwell looked at her during some ten minutes. At once
something struck him&mdash;a certain resemblance of her face to his
own: she might have been his sister; and at once, too, there was at
work in him a sympathy with her, a compassion for her, instinctive
and sudden, such as he had never yet felt for anyone.</p>

<p>She was of middle height, very slender, with very thin cheeks,
and dressed in a manner grotesque to the point of comicalness, for
she had on only a robe that was really a nightdress, but with a
waist to it, this waist being loose and low down at the hips, and
one of the sleeves was much larger than the other (this robe was
the handiwork of Anderson); and through a large rent in her right
slipper (the left had fallen through the hole in the flooring) her
dirty toes were seen.</p>

<p>Presently she opened her eyes, started, and stared at Hartwell.
She had a commonplace, but rather pathetic face, once, perhaps,
more or less pretty; there was something pathetic in the sideward
way in which she held it always. Her hair was gathered up in a
knot, a quite little knot no bigger than a ping-pong ball or large
marble; it had "dropped," and from jet black was now well-sown with
grey, though she was hardly thirty-six; her face was very blanched,
with the palest washed-out freckles on it. Only the upper part of
it resembled Hartwell's, for her lips were not thick, and the upper
was short, with a tendency to stand a little open.</p>

<p>Her surprise and fear of him rapidly vanished. Looking downward
with her head held sideward in her habitual manner, she said:</p>

<p>"So you've come at last, James."</p>

<p>"At last," replied Hartwell: "never more, I think, to leave your
side."</p>

<p>"I hope you've not come here to murder me."</p>

<p>"No! but to save, to liberate, and to avenge you."</p>

<p>"Ah, nice tale."</p>

<p>Her talk was slightly nasal, with a countrified drawl, and, like
all about her, was the very embodiment of the commonplace.</p>

<p>"Let it not be doubted," said Hartwell, with a vivacious eye. "I
come back to you, though late, a changed man, a different
man&mdash;Martha, sorry for my grievous offences against you, and
sick to the heart that I have been, and may still be, the ruffian
you have known me; but I come&mdash;no longer, indeed, your
husband, nor disposed ever more to aspire to that title, but as a
suppliant friend, beseeching you to forgive, and to permit me to
prove my penitence by a lifelong devotion."</p>

<p>Sideward she held her wearied, uninterested face. She made no
answer to this, but said musingly:</p>

<p>"How came that hole in the flooring in there, I wonder? Nearly
broke my poor neck&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this Hartwell's lips pressed vindictively together.</p>

<p>"What's brought you here?" asked Martha suddenly: "it's only to
do me some harm or other, I know. You might as well leave me in
peace after all this time, James. I shouldn't be surprised if you
only want to murder me to marry some other woman; or p'raps, if the
truth were known, you've done it already, and that's why you locked
me up, so as I should not show you up to everybody."</p>

<p>"No! I have married no one, nor ever shall&mdash;take my word
for it!&mdash;while you live. Nor have I come now to murder you,
but, I repeat, to crave your forgiveness at your feet, and to
comfort you, Martha, with my respect and love."</p>

<p>"Fine tale," she went on wearily; "you've got some new move on
the board, I suppose. It's all very well to come now with your
pretences, James, when I don't care whether I go out or stop in.
You could kill me, if you like, and I shouldn't care now. I want
none of your false-hearted respect and love, all I want is my
little Rosie." Now the poor Martha began to cry into her hands.</p>

<p>"Your little-Rosie?" said Hartwell with a stammer. He was
appalled, for he knew nothing of any little Rosie.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, you don't know where she is, do you? Oh no! you
wouldn't, of course," said Martha. "How could you be so cruel,
after all, so cruel, cruel, cruel, oh, my good God, as to take away
my little girl from me?"</p>

<p>Hartwell now knelt on a sudden, with a bowed head and back, at
her feet.</p>

<p>"She shall be recovered&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you mean 'recovered.' Where's she, James?"</p>

<p>Hartwell had no idea! He could not answer.</p>

<p>"You may as well let me have the child," she said. "What have
you done with her? You may as well let me know at once. You should
never have taken her from me. I always said: 'He's a right to do
what he likes with me, because I'm his wife, and I came from Africa
against his orders, but he shouldn't separate mother and child; oh,
no, he shouldn't do that: that isn't hardly right.' You may as well
let me know what you've done with the child. Have you locked her up
in a tower, too, with never a sight of God's sky, and not a rag to
her back five long years? She won't know her own mother when she
sees her. You may as well let me know if the child is well."</p>

<p>"She is well&mdash;forgive me&mdash;she is well."</p>

<p>"Is that the real downright truth, James?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;forgive me, forgive me."</p>

<p>"All right, I forgive you, if you give her back to me. You know
you never liked the child: anybody could see that much. You may as
well tell me whether I shall ever see the child again, or whether
this is only some new move on the board&mdash;"</p>

<p>He kissed the back of her hand several times with quick-repeated
pressures.</p>

<p>"Trust me, trust me this once," he said: "I really make no new
move on the board, having, perhaps, made enough. On the contrary,
my heart so yearns with fatherly pity for all your forlorn and
unprotected helplessness, that I present you my life as a
sin-offering for my sins against you, Martha. You shall see
her&mdash;let doubt be dismissed!&mdash;you shall certainly see
her, if you will but bear with me."</p>

<p>"It's too good to be true. You were always such a one for
telling lies, James. Shall I see her to-day?"</p>

<p>"Not to-day, I fear."</p>

<p>"Oh, then, go away"&mdash;she pushed his head&mdash;"it's only
some new move you're at: some other woman in the case, I'll
lay."</p>

<p>Hartwell kissed her hand again, and rose, saying:</p>

<p>"You shall see her, believe me. But now, come; and let these
prison-walls hear your lifelong farewell. Allow me to bear you in
my arms&mdash;"</p>

<p>He lifted and bore her down, step by step, through the darkness
of the spiral stair. She showed little interest, little joy, at
crossing that threshold; but when they emerged from the ruin, and
the full morning splendour struck the eyes of Martha, she gave a
little cry, wriggled from his hold, ran a little way with her bare
left foot through the dripping underwood, plucked a cowslip, and
then ran back from the excursion with a sort of Chinese woman
flurry in her shivering dress to his arms: thus Martha had her
momentary happiness.</p>

<p>Hartwell took her to Anderson's cottage; at the door of the
cottage he met four of the working men who were engaged in making
repairs on Oswald's behalf at the pavilion, and he ordered them to
finish the repairs, meaning to live there some time; then,
depositing Martha at the table, which was already laid, they sat to
Anderson's excellent breakfast of teal, with several sorts of eggs,
bread, butter, lettuce, and coffee.</p>

<p>After the breakfast Hartwell changed his wet clothes for some of
Anderson's, and after a search in the cottage for writing
materials, which ended in the finding of a pencil and some old
foolscap paper, he sat to write a number of letters, while Martha
sat on the outer step in her grotesque garment, wondering at the
sky, herself a wonder to the hunchback, who saw her at liberty from
that day forward with a stare of surprise.</p>

<p>Hartwell first wrote to Miss Scatchett, his housekeeper, telling
her to send him a trunk of clothes, also a certain packet of papers
in a certain drawer in his study, and instructing her also to buy
and send down a complete outfit for a lady of middle size. Miss
Scatchett, he said, was not to reveal his whereabouts to
anyone.</p>

<p>He next wrote to Bobbie Hartwell in St. James Street, saying: "I
want you to come down here immediately. You are not to reveal my
whereabouts to anyone."</p>

<p>He also wrote that day a letter to one Bathright, of Hong Kong,
enclosing a draft to pay for the return of the old countryman,
Gissing, to England.</p>

<p>He also wrote to the Chief Superintendent at Scotland Yard
asking for information as to the whereabouts of a man who one night
over four years before had received a mysterious wound in the
temple at No. 7, Twyford Buildings, W.C., which wound had made the
man dumb. He meant Barnes, the father of the murdered Letty.</p>

<p>Kirk, the stableman, who had tried to blackmail him, and Mary
Liskeard, who had wished to stab him, were dead: Bull, the mastiff,
which had taken him for a ghost, was dead; and because he could not
recall them, Hartwell's eye, as he thought of them, flashed
severely.</p>

<p>He also wrote next day to the Home Office, and to two London
morning papers, stating in equivocal language that Oswald Drayton,
condemned to four months' imprisonment, had not meant to steal the
bank notes found on him. The notes had been purposely placed in the
hanging coat by him, James Drayton, in order that Oswald might
mistake them for a letter which he meant to steal.</p>

<p>And now it occurred to Hartwell that he had not examined that
letter which Oswald had meant to steal. He had intended to do this
on the day after Oswald's trial, but the hurried trip to Gorton had
caused him to remit it. He now resolved to see, when he was next in
London, what that letter could be which Oswald had so wanted.</p>

<p>These letters, at any rate, Hartwell wrote, crushing himself
with grim lips; and Anderson took them on his cover-hack to
Felmingham.</p>

<p>The day after the liberation of Martha, in the afternoon, the
outfit for her and the trunk of clothes, for Hartwell, together
with the packet of papers which he had asked Miss Scatchett for,
arrived from London. He wanted that packet of letters because it
contained an old letter from one Elizabeth Seward, which said that
"the girl" had run away, "to go to her mother," but had been
recaptured. It had no address, no date, but the postmark on the
envelope indicated a village (Birdlip) in Gloucestershire: and
Hartwell knew that one Elizabeth Seward drew the half-yearly
interest of a fund placed by Drayton in a Cheltenham bank for her
use. He had never been able to find out who, or precisely where
this woman was; had once determined to go down there and seek her
out when he got a chance, but had never gone; and for over four
years he had had no word from her. At any rate, he concluded that
"the girl" with her must be Martha's daughter.</p>

<p>Two hours after the arrival of the packages at Corton, arrived
Mr Bobbie Hartwell, who was now grown into a slim, rosy-faced
Adonis of nineteen years, but an Adonis unrural to his glove-tips,
tinctured by Rugby, retinctured by Mayfair, and tinctured all
through again by St. John's Wood and the Quartier Latin&mdash;a
rather complex Adonis of nineteen. The young man was supposed to be
studying electrical engineering, but his hair was worn in longish
waves, and his father, who had seen his name in an art journal,
darkly suspected that Bobbie was more given to verses than to
volts.</p>

<p>Bobbie and Hartwell walked for an hour that evening in the
forest, where the father impressed upon the son the task that lay
before him: he was to start at once, and, making Cheltenham his
centre, search the country, especially about Birdlip, till he found
the girl, Rosie; the name "Elizabeth Seward" was to be Bobbie's
clue and pole-star; and he would take with him a trained
investigator from London.</p>

<p>"You will use your wits, and not fail me," said Hartwell; "it is
essential to my tranquillity that you find her within the week. I
may mention that she is black-haired, and her age under
sixteen."</p>

<p>But these details were quite wrong. Hartwell assumed that Rosie
was Drayton's daughter, and, since he knew the date of Drayton's
marriage, he could thus fix Rosie's maximum age; also, since both
Drayton and Martha were black-haired, he assumed that Rosie would
be, too; but, in fact, she was a daughter of Martha's first
husband, one Harper, was over seventeen, and fair-haired.</p>

<p>"And what do you say her name is, sir?" asked Bobbie.</p>

<p>"Rose Drayton."</p>

<p>Here again was a fatal direction, her name being Rose
Harper.</p>

<p>"Some relative of yours, perhaps, sir?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Quite so, sir. But I suppose you see, sir, that it will be
deucedly odd if I don't turn up at your wedding in three days'
time. I had to take Miss Aimee Drummond&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, deucedly odd, my friend if you don't turn up at my
wedding," answered Hartwell, "nothing so odd. Let it not, however,
be said, Bobbie, that you have a larger consciousness than your
protector. Do as I bid you&mdash;do as I Did you."</p>

<p>Hartwell's head dropped to his breast with a deep frown of pain,
his palm laid lightly on his brushed-back hair, which was growing
rather thin now.</p>

<p>"Do you feel bad, sir?" asked Bobbie.</p>

<p>"No! I feel well. Let us return to the cottage. I have only this
further hint to give you, Bobbie, which you may have already
gathered from my manner, that, in seeking this Rose Drayton, you
seek your wife; and, in finding her, you find what is a good thing
for youths of your age and hers&mdash;a mate."</p>

<p>"By Jove, sir&mdash;you&mdash;you, really, sir," went Bobbie,
with a lovely blush, "you&mdash;you overwhelm me with
distinction&mdash;Ah, Heaven! this is why I am sent to Birdlip! I
shall say Roselip&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"You displease me, Bobbie," said the lad's father: "I require
you to take my serious communications with a more becoming gravity.
It is my wish that you marry this girl, and at once, if she be
healthy&mdash;if she be alive! (She is, she must be, alive). Will
you marry her whom I wish, or whom you wish?"</p>

<p>"Whom you wish, sir, with pleasure," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"That's a man. Let us return."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>XXIII. &mdash; HARTWELL IS
TEMPTED</h2>

<p class="first">The "disappearance of Drayton," of course, caused
a flutter, especially in the west end of London. When the day of
his marriage with Julia arrived, and no one could guess what had
become of him, it was generally supposed that he had met with an
accident, and, perhaps, was dead. But the morning after that sad
wedding day, it was seen that he could not be dead, for there
appeared in two of the morning papers his extraordinary letter,
exculpating his "brother," Oswald, from intending to steal the bank
notes. Still, it could not be guessed what had happened to upset
the marriage, or where "Drayton" was.</p>

<p>Hartwell, meanwhile, remained at Corton, where he took up his
residence with Martha in the Pavilion. During the first three days
after finding Martha in her prison in the tower, he wrote several
letters to Julia, letters which were like groans expressed in
words, but he tore them all up. Only four brief lines on the day
before the wedding reached her from him: "It is better to say
briefly what has to be said. I cannot, after all, become to you
what I have hoped. And this is the last ill-usage that you will
receive at my hands."</p>

<p>Julia spent the forenoon of her wedding day in a long and
solitary ride over the downs, after which she returned to Garlot
Croft unwell, and was put to bed by her relatives in a sort of
sleep.</p>

<p>It was not till about a week after that disastrous wedding day,
that it got into the stream of general knowledge that "Drayton" was
at an out-of-the-way place called Corton, the information having by
then got abroad through Hartwell's several letters to the Home
Office, etc. By that time Julia, her aunt, and some other relatives
had gone away to the South of France. June, the month of the
marriage, passed into July. Hartwell, meanwhile, at Corton, was
looking out anxiously to see his son and Rosie, expecting their
arrival every day. But, strange to say, neither Bobbie and Rosie
came, nor Bobbie by himself.</p>

<p>Hartwell had received only one letter from Bobbie, dated at
Birdlip, saying that the search far Rosie was going forward: then
had followed a most mysterious silence.</p>

<p>At this delay Martha could not be consoled, could not be won, by
the excellent Hartwell; "You may as well tell me what you have done
with the child," said Martha wearily ten times a day in her little
nasal drawl; "you'd better tell that to the marines that you don't
know where the child is, James."</p>

<p>But Hartwell's patience with her little vulgarities of thought
and speech never failed her deadness to him, her continued lack of
any spark of gratitude or amity, had no influence on his dogged
devotion; like an automaton of chivalry he still hung about and
fostered her; and the more he served her, the more the reward of
having a genuine pity and affection for her was given to him.</p>

<p>From the first he had observed a certain facial resemblance
between her and himself, and had felt toward her some sort of
special affinity and friendship; and one day, a couple of weeks
after coming to live in the pavilion, a possible explanation, of
this was offered him: for she had an album brought from her empty
trunk in the tower, full of the faded photographs of some rather
obsolete people, the leaves of which she was fond of turning; and,
looking over her shoulder in the portico one morning while she was
going through the album, Hartwell, seeing an old daguerreotype
photograph which, being very much like himself, he took to be a
photograph of Drayton, said to her: "Ah, there I am, then;" but she
replied: "You know very well that's not you; it's my grandfather.
Denner, that shot at your mother on the ship."</p>

<p>Hartwell now for the first time saw into the mystery of his
bodily twinness with Drayton, having never before been struck by
the possibility that another mother might nave been affected in the
same way as his own had been by that old tragedy of the sea. He now
saw that this must have been so; and since that Captain Denner, the
quasi-father of his and Drayton's body, was also Martha's
grandfather, from that hour Hartwell looked upon the good Martha as
kith and kin, and added to his fatherly affection for her a
brotherly friendship.</p>

<p>He believed that Drayton, too, may have felt, something of this
affinity for Martha, and under its influence may have married her.
But, in Drayton's case, time and "the world" may have turned the
positive liking into a negative sentiment of actual dislike.</p>

<p>During all those weeks of June and July, while he waited for
Bobbie to come with Rosie, Hartwell did not weary of trying to call
up in Martha some little interest, trust, or affection toward him:
but it was always in vain; and her carping unfriendliness became an
added care to his great sorrow. Always she said to him. "You may as
well tell me where she is, James, and not be such a brute;" but he
could not tell: Bobbie Hartwell seemed to be dead; a letter
addressed to Bobbie at Birdlip was returned by the post office to
Hartwell and Hartwell would even kneel to Martha and say: "Bear
with me."</p>

<p>He spent nearly all his days with her, though he had now his
books in the pavilion, as well as the necessary apparatus for
research-work arranged in a back room on the first floor. The house
was a square, yellow-white building, moderately large, in a Moorish
tone, surrounded by a portico of arches on slender pillars; it lay
somewhat in a valley, all shut in by old forest, about a quarter of
a mile from the ruin. Some of its lonely, large rooms contained
furniture, faded tapestries and carpets, an old organ, cracked
spinets and pianos, historical Chippendales and Davids, coffers,
cabinets, bronzes, and a library of books which were just visible
through dust. Hartwell made five or six of the rooms habitable, and
had down three of the servants from Addison Road, with a young
groom named Gloucester, who brought down two of the horses, the
landau, and the trap. Sarah Gissing was made Martha's maid, and
Steve Anderson became the commissionaire of the establishment,
doing whatever odd jobs were to be done, but never losing his look
of wonder at the change in the aspect of his world. When Mrs
Gissing and her daughter Sarah arrived to await the coming of
Gissing, and occupied the second of the two chalk cottages, Steve
appeared before Hartwell to complain that things had now reached a
climax, that the water-fowl would be flushed, that the sky would
fall&mdash;But Hartwell was a new kind of Drayton, made to be
submitted to. "Let it not be said, Anderson," he said with a
smiling eye, "that the hare hunts the harrier;" and this was an
allusion which Steve could appreciate; but even so long as a month
after her liberation, if the sullen and daft Steve by chance saw
Martha alone in the forest, he would make a startled step, as if to
seeing a runaway; and a rumble was always in his chest at the way
things were looking.</p>

<p>Martha was, however, seldom to be seen alone, for her legs would
not bear her far; her vitality was almost gone.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would turn white, with flustered breath, as if
from heart-failure; she was quite light to lift. Suddenly she would
fall asleep, physically and mentally enfeebled and washed out.
Always it was Hartwell's arm which supported her, and his bosom was
her pillow.</p>

<p>Sometimes she had childish moods, picnic-fancies, and he would
take her all the summer's day to where the natural profusion of the
estate was wildest with flowers and fruit of blackberry and
honeysuckle, or into the depths of the pinewood where in some parts
the underwood was very thick and the scenery very romantic, or to
the north-east reaches of the estate where there was a frog pond in
the gloom of the forest, and all thereabouts festoons of dog rose
rioted over hedges that were three yards thick&mdash;rambles from
which Hartwell might return with Martha asleep in his arms, and in
her arms a load of flowers, roses and tall sunflowers which nodded
above their heads, and clematis and red-berried briony which
trailed on the ground, destined to fill her vases and her dark-blue
china bowl in the drawing room of the pavilion.</p>

<p>"Is it true," she asked one sunset, "that you got so rich, as I
heard before I left South Africa?"</p>

<p>They were sitting on the banks of the mere under the west wall
of the ruin, fishing, for Hartwell had tried to teach her angling,
though she always sailed the float of her rod about on the surface
of the water in an uninterested and very grotesque fashion; but
they often came and sat just there in the long twilights under a
gigantic old willow by a ground-baited patch of the mere.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Hartwell, "I got rich; hence my revolt against
my humble past when you were my lawful companion; and hence also
that lawless sense of power which you have bitterly felt, poor
woman;" with closed eyes he passed his hand back ward over his
hair, which had grown markedly more grey within the last four
weeks.</p>

<p>"At any rate," she said, ludicrously sailing the float about,
and fingering a new pearl necklet which lay over her muslin bodice,
"I haven't got much of the riches. That's been for other women, I
daresay, if the truth were only known. I think a husband should act
better by his wife than that, James: not lock her up in an old
tower five long years, and take the child away. If you'd only tell
me what you've done with my little Rosie, I'd let bygones be
bygones. Whatever has that poor child done to you? You may as well
give her back to me, James. Oh, my good Lord, I'd just like to lay
eyes on that little girl once again! I wonder if she'd know
me?"</p>

<p>"She is coming, she is assuredly coming, she is being earnestly
sought," said Hartwell.</p>

<p>"Ah, fine talk, no doubt: always coming but never come. You may
as well tell me what you've done with the child. Sought for what?
You know very well where the child is all the time: but you always
took the cake for telling lies, James."</p>

<p>The last rose and primrose blushes of the sunset faded in the
west, but still lingered like fragrant memories in the spirit of
the twilight; a faint evening breeze stirred the reeds and
bulrushes, where a few grebes and herons loitered, and the wild
duck suddenly shot up a bluff stern, like ships that dive when they
are about to sink, while yonder a little red woodcock "roaded,"
giving out in a strange language a sound which meant that that day
was done, though the air was still all alive with twitterings.
Martha pinned her sailor hat over the paltry little knot of her
hair, while Hartwell, putting together the rods and tackle, the can
of red worms, and two breams which he had caught, said to her:
"Take my word for it, Martha, that the greater number of the lies
which I was to tell you have been already told. As for the riches
of which you speak, they are yours, all yours, and have in store
for you a greater sum of pleasures than you at present dream of. I
am only waiting for you to grow a little stronger in this bracing
air of Corton, before presenting you to the world as my wife, and
settling you in that sphere which is yours by right; nor ever again
are you destined to find yourself without a protecting husband at
your side&mdash;take my word for it!&mdash;nor ever again will he
willingly cause to those eyes that have wept, one tear&mdash;If
only you will give me your pardon in return for my strong and
tender affection, Martha. Yes! you are rich enough: you possess an
excellent seat in the county of Bucks, one in Salop, houses, a
million at least in cash&mdash;"</p>

<p>Martha was not much interested; her confirmed insensibility to
him could not be moved. "You can keep all your grand things," she
said, leaning on him, as they walked down the steep forest path
from the ruin to the pavilion: "I want none of your palaver and
soft-soaping, you know; you've got the gift of the gab, since I
knew you, haven't you? and have learned to talk like grand people;
but that isn't going to get over me, James. I'd be quite happy
where I am, if you'd only give me the child to run about with me,
and pick the flowers. My goodness! that would be a treat."</p>

<p>"You shall have her&mdash;never fear! (Such an added calamity
could not befall me&mdash;)" Hartwell's eyes closed in pain. What
had become of Bobbie, he could not begin to conceive. The thought
that Bobbie had met foul play, that he might be dead, had occurred
to him, and at one time he had thought of giving notice of the
lad's disappearance to the police, and having him officially
searched for. But he had first written to Bobbie's man at Bobbie's
chambers in London to see if the man knew anything of Bobbie, and
it turned out that the man had quite recently received some
instructions from Bobbie, who was therefore apparently alive and
well. Why, then, even if his quest had failed, did Bobbie not write
to his father? It could not be guessed; but with that faith which
believes what it hopes for, pushed to make some promise, Hartwell
now said jauntily to Martha: "Yes! you shall have her. I have even
to tell you news the most auspicious! I have lately arranged for
Rosie to marry one of the healthiest, handsomest, richest, and
smartest young men in the Kingdom&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have? Is that the downright truth?" she asked, agaze.</p>

<p>"The gospel truth&mdash;let fears be dismissed! All is arranged,
and the wedding bells as it were already ring out! It is only a
matter of days when you will see her with her ideal bridegroom, a
young man as like a fairy prince as you can imagine&mdash;a poet!
rich! handsome."</p>

<p>"My goodness!" cried Martha, animated and laughing: "why
couldn't you tell me that before?"</p>

<p>"I had reasons&mdash;"</p>

<p>But now at once the worthy Martha fell into melancholy again,
saying "Seeing is believing; I'm not going to pluck any more
chickens before they're hatched: we'll wait and see."</p>

<p>After this they went in silence down the path to the pavilion,
till presently Martha said sleepily, with her head on Hartwell's
shoulder:</p>

<p>"Yes, you took away my few little jewels, didn't you, when I
came from Africa? and what have you given me since? this paltry
necklet and four paltry rings&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Hartwell: "you shall be well pleased."</p>

<p>He had discovered that she had a fondness for jewels, and one
day had gone to Cromer to buy her a few; he now determined to
choose her himself a load of the brightest and best the next day in
London, where he had also an appointment at the Home Office
concerning the case of Oswald.</p>

<p>After dinner Martha played, usually, a few old-fashioned airs on
the old piano, or they played cards, or he read to her, till she
fell asleep. The surrounding forest, which was grand with many huge
old trees, lay only a few steps away round the portico, and its
sombre presence, never unfelt, at all hours pervaded the faded old
house with some impression of mystery and enchantment; but this was
deepest at night, and often Hartwell and Martha sat silently
watching it in the portico all the evening till ten o'clock,
hearing two nightingales which lived near to the house, and sang
every night to the moonlight.</p>

<p>The morning following Martha's reproach to him for his meanness
in the matter of jewels, Hartwell, after recommending her to the
care of Sarah Gissing, started off tor Felmingham and thence for
London. But in the train he read a newspaper, and that day forgot
Martha and the jewels, forgot where he was, awoke as from a dream
when the train stopped; he had read in the newspaper a rumor, a
gossip, that Julia was engaged to the heir-apparent of the
hereditary Arch Duke P&mdash;-of B&mdash;-a "brilliant" young
soldier in the Austrian army, three years younger than Julia.</p>

<p>Hartwell had seen the young prince at Vienna, and considered him
a mere clockwork made of moustaches and spurs, who danced at state
balls. Julia's marriage with him would be like the marriage of a
peach with an artificial peach of cloth and stuffing; and Hartwell
felt that he would hardly be able to live and see it.</p>

<p>He could not suspect Julia of ambition. Her motive for entering
into such an engagement could only be resentment against him,
unless it was brought about by the pressure of her relatives. In
either case his pity for her and for himself now ached afresh in
his breast, as if no days had passed since the breakdown of their
hope.</p>

<p>Her resentment, her disdain: Hartwell had the thought that it
might not be so deep, if she only knew, if with the secretest of
whispers he went and whispered to her, "I have failed you because
of a living wife: yet she is not my wife&mdash;Drayton is
married&mdash;but I am not." Then she might think less ill of
him&mdash;at present her mind was wholly without explanation of his
conduct; she might even dare to give him a boundless forgiveness,
and say:</p>

<p>"I will have you so;" and that would avert the Austrian
tragedy.</p>

<p>But if he thus saved Julia and himself, he abandoned Martha:
Martha was wronged again. At the stubborn fact of Martha, Hartwell
groaned. He had vowed to himself that, while he was Drayton,
Drayton's wife should not be a wholly desolate widow. With the name
and estate henceforth Hartwell took the burdens.</p>

<p>But how if he threw off the name and estate of Drayton
entirely?&mdash;stood forth to the world as the penniless Hartwell,
exposed to scorn and punishment? It could be done&mdash;given a
courage such as did not at all belong to average man. Yet it could
be done. To lose all, yet thereby lessen the disdain for him of one
woman became Hartwell's temptation. Martha would then be a widow
like other widows, knowing that her husband was dead, and rich with
his wealth, not a widow thinking that her husband was alive; and
thinking herself abandoned by him; and Julia might even dare to
say, with a boundless bosom, "I will have you so."</p>

<p>But Hartwell could not face it absolutely naked. He had once
been very poor, and to men who have once felt the stark nakedness
of penury, it never quite ceases to be a motif of shame: he could
not present himself as a wholly upstart beggar of the
working-class. He thought that if he could slip off Drayton, and
yet be a passably rich and respectable Hartwell, then he might
dare. And now he remembered an electrical invention of his
working-days which he had lacked the money to patent. He
reconsidered and still found it a good thing, which is rare when
one reconsiders old ideas, unless they are genuinely good. The sale
of that invention might bring him in sixty, a hundred thousand
pounds, honestly his own.</p>

<p>The first night in London he sat up till near morning drawing
two plans of it in a warmth of new nope. Dulaunay, who had lately
gone from his chateau in Upper Auvergne to spend a week with Julia
at Cannes, was now again loitering in Addison Road; and he and
Hartwell the next morning went together to the city, where Hartwell
left one of the drawings at a model-maker's, the other one with a
patent agent, and afterwards had two interviews with business men
on the commercial aspects and floating of the invention.</p>

<p>Hartwell and the count then drove in a cab to the Home Office,
Dulaunay not knowing why, for, having been abroad, he had heard
nothing of Oswald's disgrace. At the office Hartwell learned that
the revoking of Oswald's sentence was under the consideration of
the secretary, but that, since Oswald had meant to steal some
thing, his term would almost be up before the necessary machinery
for his release could be got in motion. Hartwell, on rejoining
Dulaunay in the cab to drive home, was again thinking of that
letter which Oswald had meant to steal, and determined to see that
day what the letter could contain; but again that day something
prevented him, for as they turned westward into Cockspur Street
<i>en route</i> for Addison Road, Dulaunay nudged Hartwell with the
whisper "look," and Hartwell had a glimpse of Julia driving fast
eastward in a landau with her eldest brother? Colonel Lord
Forlong.</p>

<p>Hartwell had not known that she was in England (she had arrived
in London the previous night); and on a pretence of work, he shut
himself in the laboratory at Addison Road, sitting like a frowning
statue with a bowed head in one position till near nine in the
evening, when he suddenly went out in great haste, brushing aside
Dulaunay who tried to speak to him at the foot of the stairs.
Hartwell took a cab for Brook Street, driven by the uncontrollable
impulse to see Julia, to tell her something, he had not decided
what. But when he reached Kensington Gardens, he turned back,
saying to himself: "Let this be the last;" and he determined to fly
from any further temptation of the sort by returning to the country
early on the morrow.</p>

<p>But he would not have found Julia in Brook Street if he had gone
there; for when he had seen her that forenoon in the landau with
her brother, she was driving to Liverpool Street in order to go
down to Norfolk, and at about that hour of the evening when he was
in the cab going to her, she and her brother were moving down an
avenue in the Corton forest in a Felmingham basket-chaise. Julia
had now come from the Continent, a month after the breakdown of her
marriage, humbly enough to discover an explanation of Draytonism,
for none so far was conceivable to her. He had said to her that
evening in the rocca near Siena: "I am not married, that is the
God's truth;" and Julia still had no doubt that the God's truth
must be true.</p>

<p>Her brother's hand lay on hers in the chaise. They did not speak
a word to each other.</p>

<p>There was not a breath of wind, the birds were asleep in the
trees, the avenue was dark, save where, in bands and patches,
moonlight lay on the mossy underfoot.</p>

<p>Lord Forlong drove. They assumed that they would come to
somewhere, if they kept on, but they were not sure of the way:
presently, however, they came to an alley on the left, at the end
of which they could spy a glade in the wood; in the glade was a
well, a woman sitting on it, a girl, and a dog&mdash;a scene of
quiet moonlight and underwood; the dog was barking, and this
attracted the attention of the two in the chaise; whereupon Julia,
led by some instinct, as well as by the desire to learn the way,
said to her brother: "Stop, I will go and ask."</p>

<p>She got out and walked to meet the woman, who had now risen from
the well, and was coming to meet Julia.</p>

<p>"We want to come to Mr Drayton," said Julia, when they met: "do
you know in what direction he is to be found?"</p>

<p>For some seconds Martha could not answer; her breath was, as it
were, so taken away by this astonishing womanhood with the dainty
shoes, who was suddenly standing before and above her.</p>

<p>"You are going right," said Martha finally, "but he isn't here
now, he went to London this morning."</p>

<p>"That is disappointing, then. Is he gone for long? But perhaps
you don't know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, of course I know, if he's my husband. He's only gone for
the two days to buy me some jewels."</p>

<p>While one might count three, there was a pause, a shock, and a
silence; then Julia said with a sweet smile:</p>

<p>"That seems devoted."</p>

<p>This simple remark loosed Martha's tongue: her surprise at the
patrician presence before her was now abated; and Martha could not
let it be thought by anyone that James was devoted.</p>

<p>"Seems devoted is right," said she: "to seem is one thing, and
to be is another. It is only pretence, if you knew all. I'd say to
you what I'd say to any woman younger than myself: never let a man
get over you by his hypocrisies. It comes and it goes by fits and
by starts, and the men are all the same."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;but-when a man takes a train, he means business!"</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, I take little notice of what he does
mean," replied Martha with an indifferent laugh, glad of someone
new to talk to, and rushing at once, like a Boer-wife on the veldt,
into gossipy familiarity with a perfect stranger of her own sex:
"but after all, nobody can know a man but his own wife. He's one
thing to the world, and another thing to her. If I were to tell you
some of the things that that man has done to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, no, better not."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not going to screen him: how would you like to be
locked up five years in an old tower?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I mustn't hear!" cried Julia, laughing, with a pretty
movement of the palms towards her ears.</p>

<p>"And how would you like to have your child taken?"</p>

<p>"No, no, no, really, really, I mustn't hear!" laughed Julia
animatedly, with comic, self-protecting gestures: "he's an awful
friend of mine&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, he is. That accounts, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" Julia put out her hand with sharp decision, and
Martha had to take it.</p>

<p>"What name shall I say?" called Martha after her, as Julia
walked away.</p>

<p>"No name. I may write to him."</p>

<p>With rather a stumble in her walk she went back to the chaise,
got in and sat down with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked her brother.</p>

<p>For a minute Julia did not answer. She sat with her chin
supported on her palm and a gaze into the distance of her
long-lashed eyes, in a posture habitual to her in pensive moments;
and presently she said:</p>

<p>"That lady is his wife."</p>

<p>Nothing more was said. The chaise turned round, and drove away
from Corton.</p>

<p>The brother and sister took train the same night for London. But
the colonel found some pretext for accompanying Julia only as far
as Norwich; she went on to London, but he returned northward toward
Corton. He had a cane with him.</p>

<p>He slept at Felmingham that night, and the next afternoon at
three o'clock sent a stable-boy to inquire who was at Corton.</p>

<p>At that very hour of three Hartwell and Dulaunay, just come from
London, were driving down the forest lull from the ruin to the
pavilion. Hartwell sat silent in the trap, wondering how he was to
present Martha to the count. If he had really been a friend of
Drayton's he might possibly have known that Drayton was married. He
said presently:</p>

<p>"By the way, Dulaunay, do you recollect how long previous to my
motor car accident our friendship began?"</p>

<p>Dulaunay bridled with a grimace.</p>

<p>"But, sir," he now said boldly, "you are droll! I have never of
my life seen you before that night, when we met the one the other
at the station of Liverpool Street."</p>

<p>"Ha! What, then, were you doing in my brougham, my friend?"</p>

<p>"But I had put myself there for the shelter from the rain!"</p>

<p>"I see, I see. But is it possible, sir, that you have enjoyed
bed and board, salary and world-wide travel at my expense four
years and a half without the least formal claim upon my purse?"</p>

<p>"But!&mdash;has not sir enjoyed my society in return?" cried the
excellent Frenchman. "Devil! you are droll, "Draytong". How
possibly did you think to know me that night, when you never saw me
of your life before?"</p>

<p>"Let that remain unexplained, count, and do not puzzle your
brains in vain," said Hartwell: "I had reasons. As for your
society, certainly it has been worth the money, and, I sincerely
hope, will not fail me now or henceforth. If we are not quits, I
admit myself your debtor. But be that as it may. I am now,
Dulaunay, about to present you to my wife."</p>

<p>"Your wife! but no!" went Dulaunay, in a maze at all the
impossibilities which confronted him.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"But, sir," said the Frenchman hotly, "permit me in that case to
warn you frankly that your conduct to Lady Methwold excites the
resentment of a man of honor."</p>

<p>"Say nothing, my friend,"&mdash;Hartwell patted the count's
hand, his manner now much more elderly, sorrow-stricken, and humble
than heretofore&mdash;"say nothing: you are not my judge; and He
will take care that my sufferings are adequate."</p>

<p>The carriage containing Hartwell and Dulaunay drew up between
the Portico, and the statue of Pan, and there was Martha in her
lounge under the portico, roused from sleep to an instant thought
of her jewels.</p>

<p>She was duly presented to the count as Mrs Drayton, and before
dinner poured into Dulaunay's ears the whole story of her wrongs,
the tower, the child. After dinner she strolled, glittering with
the new diamonds, accompanied by Hartwell and the count, in the
forest; they sat for a time on the old well between the last of the
sunset and the pale risen moon; alter which, as they were strolling
again, Martha said to Hartwell:</p>

<p>"I forgot to tell you that two of your friends came to see you
in a chaise last night. It's little wonder you left me to follow
those sort of women, they're all so grand and fetching. Dear me,
they do know how to get themselves up, and no mistake! I never saw
such a creature, so tall, she seems to carry a wind with her that
blows people away&mdash;But I've let her know pretty plainly how
you've acted by me, James. Don't think I'm going to screen you, for
I'm not. I told her right out about the tower, and about taking
that poor child away&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hartwell stopped still, with a face in which the deepest pain
and shame were visible, for he guessed at once that "the tall
creature" of whom Martha spoke must have been Julia.</p>

<p>"And there, I believe," went on Martha, "comes the very
gentleman that was with her."</p>

<p>Hartwell, looking up, saw Colonel Lord Forlong coming down the
avenue in which they stood, and quickly he whispered to Dulaunay:
"Take her down that alley&mdash;" He himself then walked quickly to
meet the colonel, while Dulaunay and Martha walked back toward the
well. The colonel was a very tall man of forty, with a certain
straddle of the legs in his walk; his chin was a mere aristocratic
bone with a dent in the middle of it: he had cold grey eyes; and
Hartwell's eye flashed a little when he saw the expression of that
face of the colonel.</p>

<p>They met at a spot where the faint light that was neither of day
nor of night made a pattern through the leaves on the moss, for the
day was done, but the night was only so far come that the bright
colors of poppy, gorse, and tassels of the silver lime were going
out in a monotony of shadow.</p>

<p>The two men stood face to face, and looked at each other.</p>

<p>"Well, Drayton, is it true you're married?" asked the colonel,
whipping his right leg.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>"How long since?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a long time."</p>

<p>"Well, you escape with your life, Drayton; but you owe it only
to the fact that we are Englishmen, more's the pity for this once.
On the continent a mad dog like you would certainly not be
permitted to live. As it is, I'm sure I don't know what to do with
you, except flog you."</p>

<p>The cane lifted.</p>

<p>"Ah, my friend, wait, wait," said Hartwell quietly: "I see that
your cane is slender, and my jacket is thick&mdash;"</p>

<p>In two sharp movements Hartwell had his jacket off and dropped
to the ground; he then stood in his waistcoat and shirt-sleeves,
with a slightly bowed head and hanging arms, waiting. He had on no
hat; and his hair was now growing thin and grey.</p>

<p>Swish! the cane cut him on the head, with a flagrant brand all
down the left cheek; the colonel concentrated into it all the rage
of his arm, and struck as if to annihilate, with his lips nailed
together; Hartwell just winked a little.</p>

<p>Again it came, cutting the left arm; and again, at the neck.</p>

<p>Once more the cane lifted&mdash;But Hartwell's hand now went up
checkingly, and he said: "Enough&mdash;you are avenged:" nor was
there any disobeying that almost fatherly mildness and authority;
no further blow was struck; the colonel looked con tempt, turned
and strode away, more caned perhaps than caning; and still like a
statue with a bent head Hartwell stood there with the wheal ablaze
on his cheek, while a breath of wind stirred his hair; all the
little birds, the reed-wrens and titlarks and thrushes, tweeted
sleepily their last lingering good-nights in the nooks and cradles
of their great dormitory, where the lights wore going out: and the
worthy Hartwell heard in these little voices a new tone that
night.</p>

<p>But before the wheal on his face was quite faded, on the fourth
day after his flogging in the avenue, strange new bitterness was
raised in the cup of which Hartwell had to drink, for he received a
letter from Julia, dated at Berlin&mdash;a long and rambling
letter, which, though it said nothing in particular, and said it in
a cynical one, was yet touched with a great despair; ostensibly the
letter was only about the few presents which he had given her, but
between the lines he saw her desolate, overtaken by trouble, she
who had always fared prosperously through life and never known a
great sorrow; he could picture her sitting by herself for hours,
leaning forward with her chin on her palm, with an absent gaze of
her long-lashed eyes, in a posture habitual to her in certain
moods; and Hartwell asked himself as he read her letter, "Am I to
suffer her to die?"</p>

<p>The whole letter showed to Hartwell that she suffered greatly.
The temptation to see her, without any self-avowed object, now
again assailed Hartwell, stronger than ever before. He spent half a
day with her letter, hidden in the forest, reluctant to return to
the house, lest he should put on a coat, and take a train to go to
her; he felt that the power permanently to withstand this impulse
was not in him; that he would surely go: that it was only a matter
of time. On the other hand, to leave Martha desolate revolted him;
he wished desperately to stand by Drayton's wife; and in this
war-tug of motives his brow grew wrinkled with care and long
deliberation.</p>

<p>If only the young Bobbie would bring the girl, Rosie, then
Hartwell felt he might abandon Martha, and abandon her happy; each
day he expected Bobbie anew, or at least, a letter: but Bobbie did
not come, and did not write.</p>

<p>He returned toward evening to the pavilion on the day when he
received Julia's letter, determined to bear and wait, but to
despatch Dulaunay to seek Bobbie: and that very night Dulaunay
started away from Corton on that quest.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>XXIV. &mdash; HARTWELL WAITS IN
VAIN</h2>

<p class="first">In order to see what evil effects had befallen the
poor Bobbie Hartwell, that he did not write to his father, we must
go back some weeks to a slumbrous June afternoon, when Bobbie was
walking along a country road on which he might have imagined
himself the only living being in the world, it was so lonely there
though only two mites behind him lay Birdlip, a village in the
mountainous part of Gloucestershire. Not a cloud was in the sky,
and hardly a breath in the air: dust lay visibly on the wayside
cowslips and buttercups; the poet was in undress, scarfed at the
waist with something rare in silk with a Tyrolese hat on the back
of his curls, but his light boots, unsuited to that climate, were
growing hot; in his hand was a note-book, in which, as he went, he
pencilled down every fugitive thought which occurred to him; in
English elegiac verses.</p>

<p>After this he turned down into a shaded and secluded path, steep
and rough with stones, where he met a flushed tourist toiling up,
rolling his bicycle, proving that there was at least one other
person besides Bobbie in England; Bobbie and the bicyclist even
passed each other without any greeting, which they would hardly
have done on a really desert island. At the bottom of the hill
Bobbie saw an unpretentious but solid house a little to the left of
the path; .and he opened the gate, went up the garden walk, and
rapped at the door. Here in this secluded dell was just where the
Chancellor of the British Exchequer comes to bury himself when the
House rises, though Bobbie did not know that; he asked a very neat
young girl who answered to his rap whether by chance one Rose
Drayton lived there; her glance at his pretty face was approving,
and she smiled as she answered: No; my name is Rose, but not
Drayton." Did she by chance know the name of one Elizabeth Seward?
"No," she said.</p>

<p>They exchanged a smile as they parted, a Marconi kiss of their
lips and eyes; then Bobbie went on his way on the same path which
he had descended.</p>

<p>He went on up the path, till he came to an avenue of Spanish
chestnuts, with a stile at each end; beyond the further stile was a
wood on rough hilly ground; and into this wood Bobbie came. Here
was a bit of true England. Bobbie's heart was young: and, stopping
over his notebook, he scribbled an appropriate verse.</p>

<p>But as Bobbie scribbled, he walked on, not looking where he was
going to, and while scribbling the last word he was startled by a
silvery voice which cried out:</p>

<p>"You'd better look out, sir!"</p>

<p>Bobbie did look out, and in doing so, saw a sweet girl of
seventeen years, a mystery of muslin, roses, and a Dolly-Varden
hat, standing beyond a stream into which he had been on the point
of tumbling: and breathlessly Bobbie muttered under his breath: "By
Jove, that's rather a picture!"</p>

<p>"I am extremely obliged to you, he said aloud," catching off his
hat and they stood silent, she like an Etna of blushes, and he like
Vesuvius. She had rumpled reddish hair, some freckles, the bluest
eyes cast down, and seemed to him the sweetest loaf of of home-made
that the collusion of that Gloucestershire sun and earth could ever
have kneaded, baked, and turned out.</p>

<p>He suddenly remembered that he had a subject for talk
ready-made, though the stream was not very narrow, and one had to
lift one's voice a little.</p>

<p>"I have to ask, if I may," he said, unable to look directly at
her, "whether you know a black-haired girl hereabouts called Rose
Drayton?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, her eye resting aside on his silken girdle:
"but, then, I know hardly anyone. My name happens to be Rose, but
not Drayton; though I know that name, too, for my step-father was
named Drayton."</p>

<p>Bobbie hesitated a moment after this, and then remarked:</p>

<p>"One guesses your first name."</p>

<p>"How does one?" asked Rosie, and there was something very shy,
fresh, and wild about her, like the first snow-drop peeping through
the grasses, shy, yet quite brave and unashamed.</p>

<p>"If you had not been called Rose," answered the young poet,
"roses would have craved a new name so as to be like you in all
things."</p>

<p>Rosie very gravely pondered that answer, and gravely she
replied: "That doesn't seem very serious talk."</p>

<p>"It is absolutely serious talk," replied Bobbie with
considerable earnestness; "to express half that is in the heart,
the tongue must often be content, to seem extravagant."</p>

<p>"And what, then, sir, is in your heart, which makes you say that
roses crave to be like me?" asked Rosie.</p>

<p>"Why, admiration of you and of roses."</p>

<p>"It occurs to me to say that you admire me too quickly."</p>

<p>"Not quickly at all," protested Bobbie, "for I know you well,
since you are in all the woods and on the hedges, being a rose, and
I have plucked you and kissed you since I was a little chap."</p>

<p>"I felt nothing of it, then," said Rosie gravely, with a shaken
head, tearing a rose to pieces.</p>

<p>"No," explained Bobbie, "because I had to do only with copies of
you before, and my kisses were cold; but now, you see, I have found
the original of the roses."</p>

<p>"It may be possible that you don't mean quite so much as you
say, sir&mdash;not that I suppose that you would say it
otherwise."</p>

<p>"The truth is, that I do not say so much as I mean. But am I
permitted to come over to your side?'</p>

<p>"To mine?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How could you?"</p>

<p>"Is there no bridge anywhere?"</p>

<p>"There is one up yonder, but it does not lead into these
grounds. These grounds can only be got into by the gate in the
front wall, and that is always kept locked."</p>

<p>Two hedges, twenty yards apart, came down to the very brink of
the stream at right angles with it&mdash;hedges yards thick, all
bound up in bindweed and clematis; joining these two ran a similar
hedge parallel with the stream, with a white gate in it; and in the
space between the three hedges, the charming girl stood. Beyond the
cross-hedge could be seen a neat red cottage, breathing an
azure-grey smoke which no wind routed that day.</p>

<p>"Then, you are rather a prisoner," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am, sir."</p>

<p>"Shall I cross the bridge, up yonder, and go round to the
gate?"</p>

<p>"You would not be allowed to come in."</p>

<p>"Then I must only walk through the stream, if I may."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ob. no! If I had kept indoors, you would not have wished
to&mdash;I hardly know you yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it is simple for you to know me instantly through and
through," said Bobbie. "As for my name, it is Robert
Hartwell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then we have the selfsame initials to our name, sir!" cried
Rosie with meeting palms: "for I am Rose Harper, and we are both R.
H.!"</p>

<p>"Now isn't that an odd thing?" said</p>

<p>Robbie, "and you are a Rose and I am a Robert, for Robert means
the same thing as a Robber."</p>

<p>Rosie cast a shy, pleased underglance at him, for instantly to
the lively organs of her fancy he appeared in the light of a robber
of old romance, adventurous to the death, and gallant.</p>

<p>"Is it not strange? It seems to me now that half-an-hour since I
was just like those benighted savages that we send the gospel to,
who never heard of the fullness of life, but that now I know and
have everything. But&mdash;I will come over."</p>

<p>"Oh! I don't know why you wish to! Perhaps if you had never
come&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You would get wet."</p>

<p>"I might: but what can that matter?"</p>

<p>"No!&mdash;I don't know what to say to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, trust to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, I do! But why should you come to this side?"</p>

<p>"To hold your hand, and kneel, and kiss it, just once: then I
will call you the dearest saint&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am so certain that you will get wet&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"I think not," and now Bobbie no longer hesitated, but went down
the bank and waded to the knees through the stream to the other
side; and there he knelt in the blossoming grasses, as he had said
that he would, and kissed the little hand of Rosie, who looked down
at him with the demurest and gravest eyes.</p>

<p>"Come, here, then," slid said, suddenly brightening, and went
before him to an inner corner of the orchard, where there was a
slab of sandstone, supported askew on two low posts in the grasses
under the shadow of two of the hedges and of an apple-tree; the
rill flowed near it, and was at their feet when they sat on the
slab.</p>

<p>"Well, I said that you would get wet," remarked Rosie.</p>

<p>"One must cross Jordan to get into the Land of Promise,"
answered Bobbie; "and I was not even aware that I was wet, till now
you remind me; I rather thought that the waters had parted before
me. Isn't this a charming retreat in which you live?&mdash;so
shaded, so cool, so full of trees and flowers; and you in it. Oh, I
couldn't tell you what this day and the chance it contained is to
me! I never was half so much in luck's way, I never was half so
happy, and I do thank you for letting me be where you are. I think
you live in Heaven. I wonder if I shall be able to come again,
every day, for a long time, and just sit near you without saying a
word, and be blessed?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Rosie: "I hope so, since that would
please you, but I am not free to do all I like. If we were seen
now, I should be kept even more a prisoner than ever."</p>

<p>"How a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"It has been so with me for five years," she said, "I don't know
why. My mother brought me from South Africa when I was twelve years
old, and since then I have been kept a kind of prisoner, for I am
never allowed to go beyond the front gate, except to church on
Sunday mornings, and then I am led by the hand like a child. My
step-father, who was a terribly big man with a black beard, was
very angry with my mother for coming from South Africa when they
met in London, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>But at this point the interview was cut ruthlessly short, for
Rosie started and turned pale, and Bobbie's eyes, following hers,
saw a large, florid woman with her bare arms akimbo, standing at
the white gate in the cross-hedge, watching them. Rosie got up in a
scare to run to her, but understanding that this was the end of her
episode, unless she was both bold and cunning, with the swift
artfulness of her sex she turned back a little to Bobbie in the
nick of time, and whispered to him: "I shall be watched now: don't
come in the day, sir, but at night&mdash;when the clock strikes
twelve&mdash;"</p>

<p>The caught miss then ran with light heels toward the woman, in a
poetry of motion, as Bobbie thought, for he stood up to look after
her flight among the fruit trees; he saw the woman seem to scold
Rosie, though he could hear nothing, for the white gate was some
distance away from the slab, and he also saw her shake her finger
at himself; then she disappeared with Rosie a prisoner; and Bobbie
sat again on the slab alone for a long time, a new-hatched chick
fluttering in his boy's breast, and squalling with a wide bill
after Rosie, its little mother, for food.</p>

<p>Bobbie scribbled in his note-book no more cynic elegiacs that
day, finding Venus a "stern mother," not to be taken airily; that
notion which his father entertained for some time soon after this
date that the young man may have met with foul play was thus true
in the sense that Bobbie was seriously wounded, not in the head
with revolvers, but in the veins with an arrow. He forgot the smart
Mayfair mood, he forgot his father's mission, nothing was important
and fair to Bobbie but Rosie. Something of that affinity which
Hartwell felt toward Martha for reasons which have been hinted at,
undoubtedly made itself felt also between this son of Hartwell and
this daughter of Martha. They met again that midnight, "when the
clock struck twelve," as the romantic Rosie expressed the solemnity
of that hour, and at the sandstone slab, where the ooze from the
rill caused a growth of moss and violets between the
stepping-stones, Bobbie knelt to her again, and prayed to her,
"Tell me how to love you and thank you deeply enough for this
deigning;" and Rosie answered gravely to this, "Does it seem to you
so much that I come here to meet you, then, sir? It seems to me
that the way would have need to be long and rough, but I should
tramp all of it to meet you.</p>

<p>"Oh, immense of you to say it, really!" whispered Bobbie at her
ear. "Greatly good and sweet of you! you love me, too."</p>

<p>"Well, I think that I love you, sir," answered Rosie in a low
voice, while Bobbie felt her bosom struggle passionately like a
captured wild-fowl upon his heart, "if this giving up of myself is
loving."</p>

<p>They parted when the moon sank behind the west hedge, leaving
the orchard in shadow; but the next night they met again. Bobbie
then heard the little history of Rosie's life from the time when
her stepfather had separated her from her mother in London, brought
her to Gloucestershire, and committed her to the care of a woman,
on the understanding that Rosie was never to speak to anyone,
except to the lady who came thrice a week from Cheltenham to give
the girl her schooling; Rosie had twice run away from her "Aunt,"
or keeper, but had been retaken, and since the failure of her
second flight, had lived as shut away from the world as some fair
Rosamond or damsel enchanted in a maze.</p>

<p>The lawless and robustious Drayton had in fact, locked away from
the world the only two persons who knew that he was a married man,
namely, his wife in the tower at Corton, and her daughter in this
Gloucestershire nook, when they suddenly presented themselves
before him in England, he just at that moment being on the heights
of elation at Julia's astonishing consent to marry him.</p>

<p>While Rosie was telling her history to Bobbie, she happened to
mention her "aunt" (i.e., her keeper) by the name "Miss Seward;"
whereat Bobbie said, "Ah, if it were only Elizabeth Seward," and to
this Rosie replied, "Her name is Mary; there was an Elizabeth, my
aunt's sister, but she died years ago."</p>

<p>On the whole, no shadow of a suspicion that here might be the
very Rosie whom he was sent to seek occurred to Bobbie: for one
Rosie was objectionable, had black hair, under sixteen, and named
Drayton, the other was sweet, fair, seventeen, and named
Harper.</p>

<p>They met four midnights in all, and sat on the sandstone slab by
the rill in the shade of the hedges and the apple tree; and at the
darkening of the moon Bobbie kissed her goodnight, waded back into
the regions beyond Jordan, and trudged home to his inn at Birdlip,
unconscious of his wet trousers and of all the length of that
lonely walk: but on the fifth night when the excellent fellow waded
back through Jordan, he waded with Rosie in his arms. A vehicle was
waiting for them down in the glen, and they drove to
Cheltenham.</p>

<p>And so it was that when Dulaunay, despatched by an agonised
Hartwell, came down to hunt for Bobbie a month later, no trace of
Bobbie could be found. Bobbie was a married Adonis, occupying an
apartment in the Rue de Rome in Paris, and the charming Rosie was
learning to conjugate the verb "aimer."</p>

<p>Hartwell had said to Bobbie:</p>

<p>"Will you marry her whom I wish, or whom you wish?"</p>

<p>And Bobbie had replied:</p>

<p>"Whom you wish, sir, with pleasure."</p>

<p>Hence Bobbie was in a quandary. Each Sunday night, on returning
home with Rosie from some party or cafe, he resolved to make a
clean breast of his marriage that week: but he always put it off,
and after a month, still the more he delayed, the more ungrateful
became the task. The truant boy had a profound awe of Hartwell,
who, he felt, would be terribly outraged, and must, moreover, be in
trouble on account of the mysterious miscarriage of his own
marriage; and possessing, meantime, a substantial balance at his
bankers, Bobbie still put off the day of accounts, forgetting the
flight of time, or shutting his eyes to it, as people in such a
state of mind always do. Finally, he determined that before writing
the news of his marriage to Hartwell, he and Rosie would return to
Gloucestershire, together seek out Rose Drayton, and with her as
trophy and douceur, make their way, erring but still useful, to his
guardian. The young husband and wife accordingly started back for
England toward the end of September; but they could find no Rosie
Drayton; soon gave up the search; and returned to Paris for a
while.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>XXV. &mdash; HARTWELL MARRIES A
WIFE</h2>

<p class="first">Oswald Drayton's imprisonment was shortened only
two weeks by the Home Office, so that he did not get out until the
middle of September. On the morning when he emerged from the
Holloway gates, there was Hartwell and a carriage waiting to
receive him, and Oswald said "You?" with a curl of the lips.</p>

<p>The old club-land life was rather over for Oswald now, for
though some in that land do make short-cuts to fortune, and save
time by stealing, between saving and serving time a distinction is
made, the maxim being, as among the Spartans, "be not caught," or
as in the fairy-tales, "the hand of the princess, if you do it
well, beheadal, if you miscarry." Oswald, therefore, when Hartwell
asked him and insisted, went down to stay at Corton.</p>

<p>"How did the wedding come off?" he asked in the train; and his
mood of weary disgust was penetrated with astonishment when
Hartwell replied:</p>

<p>"I did not marry Lady Methwold, Oswald."</p>

<p>This was amazement enough, but at Corton amazement after
amazement awaited Oswald, first when Hartwell made the
introduction: "My wife, Oswald&mdash;my brother, Martha;" then
again, the same night, when Oswald met Barnes, with a paralysed
right arm, and saw Hartwell cutting Barnes' meat for him. Hartwell,
after an elaborate search, had finally unearthed Barnes in a
wayside alms house near Northrepps, and, almost by force, had
brought the afflicted inn-keeper to Corton. During the day Barnes
was under the care of Mrs Gissing in one of the two chalk cottages,
but he dined every night at the pavilion with the gentry: and
though he still dumbly scowled at the supposed slayer of his
daughter, that constant frown was growing day by day less
fierce.</p>

<p>But still greater was Oswald's astonishment to meet the next day
a woodman felling trees, with a beard grown back from the chin,
who, when asked his name, said: "Gissing."</p>

<p>Oswald's cigar brightened and burned quicker.</p>

<p>"Was it you, Gissing?" he asked, "who once lived with a wife and
daughter in a cottage called the old Manor Farm, near
Overstrand?"</p>

<p>"It wor, sir," said Gissing.</p>

<p>"Then, where have you been?"</p>

<p>"Been out to Hong Kong."</p>

<p>"What on earth for?"</p>

<p>"Seeking a bit o' work, sir; seeking a bit o' work."</p>

<p>Oswald threw out a breath of pleased laughter. Gissing, at any
rate, was now here; and Gissing, his wife, or his daughter would
furnish quite as good proof that Drayton had known Letty Barnes as
the shreds of Letty's letter which Oswald had tried in vain to
steal.</p>

<p>But for some days, Oswald's amazement was so engaged in watching
what seemed the dementia of Hartwell, that he did nothing with
regard to the Gissings: for a rapid series of events had caught
Hartwell, as it were, in a whirlwind, and hurried him into action
the most outre, as we shall now see.</p>

<p>The first of these events was the definite news, on the day
after Oswald's release from prison, that Julia was really affianced
to the young prince of the archducal house of M&mdash;&mdash;; it
was no longer a mere rumor, but was soon the chatter of society
over Europe; for this high marriage of a subject with a prince, of
course, could only be solemnised by a special dispensation of the
Emperor. Even the date was now fixed for the February of the coming
year.</p>

<p>Hartwell's eye flashed with the old vigor as he read it in his
study at Corton, and, pacing rather wildly, he thought to himself,
"Ah, she'd leave them all for me, if I only go to her. She'd leave
them all for me; and I I know that I shall go, too."</p>

<p>Hartwell's temptation to go to Julia was strong that day: for
Julia happened to be near him in London, whither she had just
returned from somewhere in Warwickshire.</p>

<p>But he decided to sleep, or rather to go to bed, upon it, and as
the next morning the same evil mind possessed him, he began to make
arrangements to go to her, not leaving his room meanwhile, nor
allowing himself to see Martha.</p>

<p>But at eleven o'clock Dulaunay arrived suddenly with the news
that neither Bobbie nor Rosie could be found in all Gloucestershire
after three weeks' search by himself and a hired agent: and at this
disaster Hartwell bowed his head.</p>

<p>Martha was every day growing more insistent for the promised
appearing of Rosie and the "fairy prince."</p>

<p>And that same afternoon that Dulaunay came back to Corton a
letter with the Birdlip postmark reached Hartwell, through London,
from one Mary Seward, who said:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">"I have to tell you, sir, the sad news that your
Rosie has disappeared from the house, no one knows where to, though
it is supposed to be with a young gentleman whom I saw in the
orchard with her one day two months and a half ago. Five mornings
after this she was missed, her bed had not been slept in, and
Britton, the stableman at West Bridge House, says that one foreday
he drove her and a young gentleman, who had hired a carriage at
West Bridge to Cheltenham. I should have written you this sad news
long before, sir, but to tell the truth, I was afraid you would say
it was my fault, which, God knows, it was not, and besides I did
not despair of finding the child. I hope you won't put the blame
upon me, or won't think much harm of it because I did not write to
tell you of the death of my sister Elizabeth four years since, as I
am a poor woman, and did not know but what you might be taking the
child from me and giving her to someone else, my sister being dead.
I have drawn the bank money in her name, and that, I know, was
wrong, but I hope, etc., etc."</p>
<br>

<p>A long rigmarole followed this.</p>

<p>Rosie, then, was gone; Bobbie, too, by the way, was gone; and
Hartwell's mind, numb with its constant care, did not once conceive
that Rosie and Bobbie may have gone in the same boat.</p>

<p>Hartwell had embarked on the grim task of "acting well:" he
wished to stick to the wronged and bereaved Martha. If he abandoned
Drayton's wife, he now felt that he must publicly abandon Drayton's
name and estate also, much as these had become part of himself by
old possession. That abandonment, too, of name and estate could be
made, should be made, if only he would not be left quite nakedly
poor: and that day when he received the news that Rosie had run
away, he telegraphed to Birmingham to know definitely the date of
the trial of his electrical invention.</p>

<p>After several failures he had got an efficient working-model of
it, though a certain bird of ill-omen, an expert, had predicted a
breakdown when the trial on the large scale should come to be made.
However, the thing was being installed, and was to be tested before
a board of experts that year: but the answer to his telegram that
day was that the trial could hardly take place before the end of
November.</p>

<p>That was two months away, and seemed two ages.</p>

<p>He felt that long before then, still retaining the name and
estate of Drayton, he would abandon Drayton's wife, who was not his
wife, in order to go to her, whom he loved; he felt that nothing
could save him from this&mdash;unless he married Martha before
witnesses who knew him well. And within five days after hearing
anew of the engagement of Julia and of the loss of Rosie, he had,
in fact, become Martha's legal husband.</p>

<p>He had taken Martha's hand two evenings after hearing of the
loss of Rosie, as he and Martha were sitting on the well in the
glade at sunset, and he had said to her:</p>

<p>"Martha, I have to make a painful confession to you, and to ask
you for what, I think, will not be denied me&mdash;your sympathy
and help. I am at present, Martha, in the pangs of a really serious
temptation, the temptation to abandon you again, as I abandoned you
before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, why don't you?" cried Martha. "I want none of you, so
don't think it! Go&mdash;go&mdash;don't you stay for me."</p>

<p>"No! by your side I stay&mdash;And do not be angry that I am
even tempted, Martha, but let me be pitied, let me be helped. The
temptation, I say, is not slight, and without support I must needs
succumb to it, in spite of my sincere affection for you. And since
I feel that this support would be furnished me, if I marry you
afresh?"</p>

<p>"Marry who afresh?"</p>

<p>"Marry you, Martha."</p>

<p>Oh! the excellent Martha clapped her two hands to her sides!
pierced and twisting with sudden, high laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is rich!" she laughed. "Why, what's the matter with
the man? people will say I'm gone crazy or turned spooney in my old
age! a man of your age having these harum-scarum larks running
through your head! You ought to be ashamed for your grey
hairs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am delighted to have made you merry," said Hartwell, with a
smiling eye, "which you too seldom are, Martha. My decision,
however, in this matter is fully formed, and cannot be laughed
away. The day after to-morrow we take a picnic to Norwich, and
there we will be married before a Registrar, you giving your self
as a widow, and I as a widower&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what's the matter with him?" she cried. "Think of my doing
such a ridiculous thing as that-my own lawful husband! This is only
some new move!"</p>

<p>"No! no new move. Say nothing, but listen to me, since I work,
not for myself, but for you. I am a new man to you of
late&mdash;admit that, Martha and though never again can those
closest relations which once existed between us be renewed, let a
new binding be effected since there are reasons which suggest it.
As to the assumption of people' that you were not married before,
only Oswald and the count will know of the new marriage, and
whatever they may tacitly assume will not, I think, much trouble
you or me."</p>

<p>In the end her merriment died wearily out, and two days later,
the party of four, Hartwell, Martha, Oswald, and Dulaunay, went to
Norwich, a special licence having been procured. Hartwell was
particularly careful that Oswald, whom he believed to be still his
enemy, should be there to see, so that no evasion of the bond might
ever be possible to him; and with grim lips and a bright eye,
wantonly throwing away his life, he went through that ceremony.
Oswald stood agape with mere wonderment at this rite in the
Registrar's room; Dulaunay was like a machine made to mutter to
itself a periodic "<i>mon Dieu</i>," but done before their eyes
that strange deed was.</p>

<p>Like people with a weakness for the bottle, Hartwell had "signed
the pledge," never more now to leave tea for wine, or Martha for
Julia.</p>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>XXVI. &mdash; HARTWELL SENDS
DULAUNAY</h2>

<p class="first">Autumn burned with slow combustion within the
forest; "the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness" passed into
chilly October, stripping the trees of their leaves, and turning
the brackens brown; but still Oswald Drayton could not reach the
end which he strove after.</p>

<p>From the first Gissing proved intractable, could not for the
life of him remember ever to have seen the master and any young
lady at Overstrand. "But, my good sir, I understand that they
stayed a week with you," said Oswald. "Not with me, master, not
with me," said Gissing, washing his hands of all knowledge of the
matter, whispering of it sparingly even to his good woman in the
dark nights on their bed.</p>

<p>"But you saw my man, Walker? You told him so?" said Oswald; and
Gissing thought to himself: "If Walker was his man, that only
proves that he don't wish no good to the master. Lord be praised, I
ain't let out aught." He denied that he had ever seen Walker,
cleaned himself of the whole matter, as one picks burrs from the
clothes: for in this old man's bosom was now a deep-seated fear,
reverence and gratitude for Hartwell.</p>

<p>Oswald, in his slow way, set himself to the siege of Gissing. He
would stroll out in the mornings after breakfast through the forest
and home coverts in the direction where Gissing, alone or with
Anderson, was engaged in trimming, clearing, felling or making
solid huts of dry twigs, and he would enter into leisurely chats
about the winter prospects, the harvest, the weather, east-coast
fishing, mould and bone dressing, Hong Kong, or how the birds were.
Gissing could talk with considerable information, and even as he
worked on, let his tongue run freely, but when it came to be a
question of his two lodgers of live years before, he shrank like
the sensitive plant, and lost his memory.</p>

<p>One evening, at the end of October, on returning home to his
chalk cottage, whom should Gissing meet but Oswald. At a table
covered with a clean, coarse cloth, on which were shrimps,
water-cress and bread and butter, sat Oswald drinking tea out of a
delf cup, and Mrs Gissing acting as the hostess. On the bench under
the ivied lattice window, through which the very last beams of the
sunset shone, sat Barnes, leaning forward with his left elbow on
his left knee, all his paralysed right side seeming to hang behind,
as if reluctant to follow the lead of the left: and there was a
curious eagerness in his eyes, as if what had been said between
Oswald and Mrs Gissing interested Barnes.</p>

<p>"Good evening to you, sir," said Gissing to Oswald, "this is an
honor, I'm sure. But you're having a late tea; it must be nigh the
dinner hour at the big house."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Oswald, "you had better take Barnes round now."
(Barnes always dined at the pavilion with Hartwell).</p>

<p>Gissing laid his axe and spade in a corner, saying with a
certain tone of irony in his voice: "Come along then, Mister
Barnes, come along" and he directed a look of warning toward his
wife.</p>

<p>Barnes was now almost like a child, enfeebled in mind as well as
body, and always meekly obeyed whatever was told him. He rose, took
Gissing's arm, and went with a trailing right leg down the two
broken doorsteps, and through the woods. As Gissing disappeared, he
shot one more meaning look at his wife.</p>

<p>Oswald lit a cigar, while Mrs Gissing, a large clean-faced
country woman, moved round the table, making a rattle with the
crockery, looking flushed and uncomfortable, for she could not
prevaricate reposefully, and the questions already asked before the
entrance of Gissing had flustered her. Such a visit, however, as
she was now undergoing had been foreseen in the household, and her
proper course of conduct in such a case had been frequently
discussed between her and Gissing.</p>

<p>"So, then, you do not wish to tell me," said Oswald. .</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! it ain't that I don't wish to," she answered, sitting
with an averted face, her arms rolled in her gingham apron, "but
you know yourself that it happened five years agone?"</p>

<p>"That what happened five years agone?"</p>

<p>"Why, what you're after hearing about, I should think! You want
to know if ever I saw master with a lady&mdash;is that it? or if
ever they lodged with us on the farm. I think that's it. And I say
it's too long ago for a body to call to mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You admit, however, that it did happen."</p>

<p>"Me? Admit? Oh, sir, don't say that o' me, sir! I declare he'd
put a saint out&mdash;! No, sir, it's the last thing I'd
do&mdash;admit. There were people always comin' and goin' at the
Old Manor Farm, and how is it likely I'd call to mind what you say
yourself happened five years agone? No, dunnot say that o' me,
sir."</p>

<p>"But Mr Drayton's face is one that one remembers. Be frank with
me: he is my brother, you know, little as he looks it, and you may
be sure that I have a good reason, for his sake, for wishing to
know. Surely you remember seeing him somewhere before he brought
you here?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say that I call it to mind."</p>

<p>"Then, how came you here?"</p>

<p>"He wanted a hand on the land."</p>

<p>"Hand on the land&mdash;How came Gissing to go to China of all
places?"</p>

<p>"Better ask him that himself, sir."</p>

<p>"You tell me."</p>

<p>"Seeking a bit o' work, sir, seeking a bit o' work."</p>

<p>"Preposterous nonsense! He has bribed you all well, hasn't he?"
muttered Oswald, rising with a flush of spite, envy, and defeat all
over his shining head, while Mrs Gissing, catching the word
"bribe," said sharply:</p>

<p>"We ain't received any bribe from master, sir, so don't think
that. Gissing 'ud lay down his life any day for master, I do
believe, without that, and so'd I, if it came to that, and so'd our
Sarah, I'm sure. It ain't any bribe that you, or he either, could
give us that 'ud buy what he's gotten o' us, and that's gratitude
and love o' the heart:&mdash;and that's why, sir."</p>

<p>"You mean that's why you wallow in lies?" said Oswald, flushed
with envy and jealousy: "how has he got from you this infernal love
o' the heart? The man must have bewitched you, my good woman!"</p>

<p>"Ey, he's a decent lot, the master!" said Mrs Gissing half to
herself, with a jerk of the head.</p>

<p>"And little Sarah is in the conspiracy of silence, too, is she?"
muttered Oswald, going out: "we shall see into that. It is their
own fault&mdash;"</p>

<p>He decided to get the truth from Sarah. But he walked to the
pavilion with a feeling of misgiving: for he had said too much to
Mrs Gissing, had openly showed enmity against Hartwell, and there
was the possibility that the Gissings might conceive the idea of
accusing him to Hartwell, who, for the present was his protector
against the world. He resolved, therefore, to hurry matters with
regard to Sarah.</p>

<p>On Friday nights&mdash;and this was one&mdash;whist parties had
become an institution at the pavilion. Martha, like many
old-fashioned people, had no small skill (of a technical,
hand-and-fast sort) in the conduct of her hand, and, with Hartwell
for her partner, generally won her rubber, though Oswald and
Dulaunay made a strong combination against them. As this was the
only item in their life at Corton in which Martha displayed the
least interest, the count made it a point always to be present,
even if he was away during the earlier part of the day.</p>

<p>That Friday night, accordingly, the party of four sat in the
room which was used as the drawing-room, a large, quaint apartment
on the ground floor, looking through French windows upon two
lengths of the portico.</p>

<p>Of the four only the count chattered and "made to laugh," or
rather made to smile in the case of Hartwell, for Martha did not
find him amusing after the first few days, when his foreign being
had ceased to excite her surprise at an undreamt-of-type. As for
Oswald, he had lost his smile in Holloway, and sat saturnine,
silent, prim, his handkerchief-corner stuck neatly, from the pocket
of his snuff-colored coat; now he largely handled his moustache,
now made a sound of lassitude or contempt of life with a corner of
his mouth; and his eyes remained fixed on the cards, save when he
let them rest a moment on Hartwell with an evil glance. The
Frenchman he regarded with the vague contempt which he felt for
whatever is more intelligent, bright and worldly than Pall Mall,
and anon his lips curved slightly downward at the mere sound of
Dulaunay's chatter. The count was telling an adventure which had
happened to him near Buda-Pesth with an attaman of zincali, and had
got to where the gipsy's daughter won his heart, when Sarah
Gissing, about ten o'clock&mdash;for the sitting-up was late on
whist-party nights&mdash;brought in two decanters, curious old
cut-glass vessels with "port" and "sherry" marked on bands of old
gold round their necks, and laid them on the table together with
cake and biscuits; and with her came the retriever, Mascotte, a
recent purchase of the count, which laid its neck on Hartwell's
thigh, and awaited a caress.</p>

<p>Sarah had just returned from taking Barnes to her parents'
cottage, and perhaps in consequence of a sharp walk back through
the wood, was already rather flushed: but this flush deepened to
the deepest carmine in that moment while she stood at the table.
Hartwell saw it&mdash;could hardly fail to see it&mdash;and divined
that the count had touched her foot with his under the small table.
But this time Dulaunay was innocent. The culprit was Oswald.</p>

<p>Sarah was a slight girl whose rustic simplicity one might
compare to the rabbit's, in spite of her nearly five years of exile
in Birmingham. She was rather pretty, though thin, and though her
eyes had a rather silly stare of preoccupation or flurry, and her
upper-lip only closed with effort, at all events, sufficient had
passed between her and Oswald in the way of gallant patronage on
his side to leave her in no doubt as to who had touched her foot,
and she blushed with that virgin excess, to the roots of her hair,
to the tips of her toes, a redundant flood, which is possible any
longer only to the rustic in these islands.</p>

<p>That betraying blush was seen not only by Hartwell but by
Dulaunay, who muttered to himself: "But hold, she knows to blush,
that girl there!" and Sarah put down the tray with such a clatter,
that Martha looked up with a suspended card, flaying, "My goodness,
what is the matter with Sarah?"</p>

<p>During three days after that night, Oswald's intrigue with Sarah
progressed apace, but into its progress it is needless to enter,
since it did not advance far, for on the third evening old Gissing,
returning homewards from some forest work, which lay in a different
direction from his usual haunts, spied Oswald and Sarah through
some bushes standing under a tree, Sarah's head bent and smiling,
and Oswald's forefinger under her chin. The old man's lips set
wilfully, and he called out: "Here, Sarah, I want you!&mdash;excuse
me, sir."</p>

<p>The girl at once followed him to the cottage; no word was
spoken; even on going in, Gissing said nothing to her, except with
his eyes; but he took Mrs Gissing into an inner room, and there
held a family council. The task of giving a piece of the family
mind to Sarah was left to Mrs Gissing, and she gave it without
stint, and Sarah was soon in a state of tears and filial
resentment. The altercation raged for an hour, while Gissing merely
paced and looked on, as Napoleon from a hill surveyed the drama of
Waterloo, expressing only with his eyes his scorn and
indignation.</p>

<p>And that night Martha and the household at the pavilion awaited
Sarah in vain: for Sarah, though now a woman of twenty-two, was
kept a prisoner in the cottage.</p>

<p>The next morning at ten, while Martha was sitting out on the
well, enjoying the 'Indian summer' with a novelette in her hand,
and Oswald and Dulaunay had gone out with Steve, the three dogs,
and double barrels, Gissing stood at the door of Hartwell's
impromptu laboratory and study. It was a small room at a back
corner of the pavilion on the upper floor, hung on three sides with
rugged arras, while on the fourth were some new shelves, a new
table, a new installation of gas and water, with a crowd of glass
objects, and the odds and ends of the apparatus of research.
Hartwell sat on an old oak chair at an old desk with a pen in his
hand, but with his brow on the desk, as Gissing could see through
the half-open door.</p>

<p>Gissing cleared his throat, and Hartwell lifted his head,
staring a moment without seeming to see anything.</p>

<p>"Come in, Gissing&mdash;What, then, has become of Saran?" he
said.</p>

<p>He shook the old man's hand with a long shake and a meaningful
pressure. There was only one chair, so Gissing stood, holding his
hat with both hands.</p>

<p>"It's her I come to talk about," said he. "I come to tell you
that I don't want her to come back here no more. My good woman is
sending her down Overstrand way to stop with a friend for a
time."</p>

<p>Hartwell looked at him with a smiling eye, remembering Sarah's
blush; and he said:</p>

<p>"You shall be well pleased. Do not send her away. I will speak
with the count."</p>

<p>"It ain't the count; it's your brother, Mr Oswald."</p>

<p>"Ah? Out of the dry cometh forth sweetness. Well, then, Mr
Oswald must be reasoned with."</p>

<p>Gissing was silent and scratched his head, seeking for
expression.</p>

<p>"Look you here," he said, presently, "you've done everything for
me, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Except what I have done against you, my friend," said Hartwell
in a lower voice.</p>

<p>"Ey, A' forget that, A' forget that there!&mdash;I give it all
back to ye with love and brotherly feeling. You're a hard man, and
what you once set your mind to it's got to be done; but for every
kick that ye gave to me and mine, you've given me a kiss for it,
when we was helpless, too, and ye didn't need to, save out o' the
love and kindness o' your heart&mdash;God bless you, good luck to
you!"</p>

<p>The back of the old man's rude hand slowly wiped a tear from his
eye.</p>

<p>"Gissing, I see that I must call you a Christian," said
Hartwell, "blessing them that have cursed you."</p>

<p>"There worn't no cursing," said Gissing; "what you did to me, it
wor my own fault, after all, trying to get money."</p>

<p>"No! it was my fault: as to that let doubt be now dismissed,
Gissing. What, however, has this to do with Mr Oswald's gallantries
toward Sarah?"</p>

<p>"That's why I come to you, to tell you that it ain't Sarah he's
after, not for herself, but it's the secret that he'd be winning of
her."</p>

<p>"Which secret?"</p>

<p>"Why about you and the young lady that stopped at the Manor
Farm."</p>

<p>Hartwell pondered that: Oswald wished to know about that.</p>

<p>Gissing brought his lips nearer to Hartwell's ear, saying in a
secret voice:</p>

<p>"The youngster, Walker, that come at the first to the farm five
year agone, seeking to ferret out about you and the young lady, he
was Mr Oswald's man! and Mr Oswald has been after me and the good
woman, too, of late, seekin' to make us own up to it, and seein' as
we wouldn't, now he's for pumping of Sarah. So you'd better be on
your guard."</p>

<p>"I will. Is that all you have to tell?"</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"Do not send the girl away. Good bye."</p>

<p>"Good-bye."</p>

<p>"And my thanks, Gissing!"</p>

<p>"That's all right between us."</p>

<p>The old man went away, and Hartwell, rising, paced the room.</p>

<p>What he now clearly saw was that Drayton must have done some
very serious wrong to this unknown girl; the fact that for five
years Oswald had been seeking a witness of Drayton's and the girl's
acquaintanceship proved this, as did also the fact that Oswald, a
poor man, had originally offered Gissing so large a bribe as £200
to bear witness against Drayton.</p>

<p>Where, then, was the girl? what was her name? In all that time
could Oswald not find her? Was she dead? What had Drayton done to
her? Had he&mdash;? Hartwell shrank from a terrible question which
presented itself to his mind. If he had now remembered Oswald's
interest in the murder of one Letty "Barton," and his own
reasonings about that murder, and if he had connected this memory
with Drayton and the girl seen by Gissing, the truth must have
dawned upon him that Letty "Barton" was really a girl done to death
by Drayton. But he did not think of that. A foreboding of calamity,
however, a definite expression of spirits, took possession of him;
he understood that here was a question of life and death.</p>

<p>Ant now his mind naturally recurred to the shreds of the letter
which Oswald had tried, and failed, to steal: for since Oswald was
so earnest in the matter of Drayton and the girl, it might well be
that those shreds related to the same matter. By what series of
chances, he, Hartwell, had not even now read those shreds he did
not know; but he resolved to read them at once.</p>

<p>He resolved also to let Oswald know that his unbrotherly
hostility was no secret, and that he was-disposed to resent it.</p>

<p>He waited till lunch-time, and while the three men and Martha
were at table, with Sarah serving, he said to Dulaunay: "Count, I
have to beg you to take a trip to London for me by the 2.21 train,
if you will. It is a question of opening a wardrobe in my bedroom
in Addison-Road with this key and searching something among the
pockets of the coats in the left hand compartment, till you find an
envelope containing some shreds of paper: these I want to examine
at once. Will you do this for me?"</p>

<p>Handing the key to Dulaunay, he fixed a look upon Oswald, who
became red and then white. Hartwell had not "an eye like Mars' to
threaten and command," but he had an eye like Ulysses' to threaten
while it smiled, an eye teeming with magnetic influence, which
Oswald felt, but which, unfortunately, could not terrify the Power
which arranges the course of events.</p>

<p>As they moved away from the table after lunch, he said close to
Oswald's ear, "I desire you, Oswald, to have no further talk with
Sarah Gissing."</p>

<p>Oswald made no reply, he had no time; he understood that the
order was final; and taking his hat from the hall, he went out
walking alone in the paths of the forest, with a bosom in which
boiled all the poisons of rage, hatred, a sense of weakness and
thwarted effort, humiliation and belittlement, shame and care.
Hartwell had given him the command in the tone in which one checks
a naughty schoolboy; and with Oswald's other bitterness was mingled
the bitterness of an enforced change of opinion, a revolution of
theory held through a life-time: for whereas since boyhood he had
despised "James," Oswald now found that willy-nilly he revered
"James," and suspected that he himself was despised, and rightly
despised, by that "James" whom he had despised, and had believed
that he had rightly despised. He had, therefore, to endure the
constant whisper of his consciousness: "You have been a fool in a
club, and nothing that you or Pall Mall ever thought was true;" and
this added to the other shames and rages of Oswald.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>XXVII. &mdash; THE SHREDS</h2>

<p class="first">Meantime, Dulaunay was getting ready to set out by
the 2.21 p.m. train. So small an incident as a trip to London,
which could not excite the most excitable of Britons, was an event
to the count, brought a light to his eyes, and formed, when it was
over, the subject of a detailed narrative in his journal. He came
down drawing on his gloves, in a frilled shirt-front, and a large
hat somewhat cocked aside, said a formal good-bye to Hartwell and
Martha in the portico, promised to be back by eleven p.m., and, as
the trap was not ready, went in a heat and hurry to the stables,
though there was no need for haste. He waited in the stable-yard, a
small quadrangle of red-brick in the heart of the forest behind the
pavilion, and hurried the young groom, who was called Gloucester,
in harnessing one of the two horses which were kept at Corton.
Gloucester then put on another jacket, and they set off.</p>

<p>But in the second avenue from the stables, a stoppage occurred:
for, in passing Oswald, Dulaunay waved a good-bye, and, as if this
action had inspired Oswald with the devil in the shape of a sudden
thought, he called out when the trap had passed six yards beyond
him: "Hi! I think I'll go with you&mdash;"</p>

<p>The trap stopped, Gloucester got out and sat on the drop-seat
behind, and Oswald drove to the station, where they took the train
for London, bidding Gloucester be there for them with the trap at
10.45.</p>

<p>Oswald could hardly have explained to himself this sudden
impulse to go to London: he had no definite object; a moment before
he had seen the trap in the avenue he had had no thought of going
from Corton; but precisely like an inspiration it had entered his
head, and there he was in the train.</p>

<p>It must be that the brain works independently of one's will, as
in dreams perhaps. Oswald's consciousness had contained in it the
fact that the count was going to bring those shreds of Letty's
letter, so long coveted, so greedily coveted by him; and his brain
must on a sudden, as a trap passed him, have evolved the conclusion
that it might possibly be as well if he were near Dulaunay during
the next hours.</p>

<p>During that journey to London some strange mists of thought
floated through Oswald's mind&mdash;thoughts of chloroform, of
knocks on the head, and main force. He saw himself holding a
saturated handkerchief to Dulaunay's face on the journey back to
Corton, or inflicting a blow with the head of his stick, or
wrestling with the Count in panting agony for the shreds of Letty
Barnes' letter. All the way such visions infested his spirit, even
as he smoked and chatted. But he knew that they were visions and
nothing more: Oswald was not made for such deeds; the most that he
could do was to conceive them, and be guilty of them in will. So
much was no different in action from his dead brother, James.</p>

<p>When they arrived it was not far from dinner-time, and not
expecting much in that way at Addison Road, they walked down the
Strand and dined in an underground club of Dulaunay's. There they
took a cab for Kensington, and, arriving there, were welcomed by
Miss Scatchett, who said to them in the inner hall with a certain
smirk of mystery:</p>

<p>"You are just too late, gentlemen, to meet the young married
couple: they had an early dinner, and left twenty minutes since for
Corton."</p>

<p>"Which young married couple?" asked Oswald.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr and Mrs Hartwell," answered Miss Scatchett, with the
same smirk of mystery.</p>

<p>Silence fell, while the minds of Oswald and Dulaunay digested
the words. Dulaunay's eyes travelled quickly to and fro between
Oswald and Miss Scatchett.</p>

<p>"But hold," said he, "is it Bobbie that she wishes to say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Mr Bobbie Hartwell!"</p>

<p>"Is Bobbie, then, married?"</p>

<p>"To as charming a bride as you could desire to see! I almost
imagined that you would know by this time, though I understood from
Mrs Bobbie that there is some difficulty He was extremely nervous
about going down, but I have not the least doubt, as I told him,
that all will be well, if he allows his bride to plead his cause.
She really is charming&mdash;rustic as a wood-nymph, yet quite
well-bred&mdash;in short, charming."</p>

<p>"Well, I was never so astonished," cried the Count; "that lost
Bobbie married! This, then, explains his long absence and silence,
Oswald: he had fear of what "Draytong" might say. And now at last
he returns married. It is as though the 'Prodigal Son,' returned to
his father with a lady on his arm, followed by a valet and a
chamber-woman&mdash;Have they attendants, Miss?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Miss Scatchett, "a man and a French maid, of
whom the man remains here and the maid has gone with them. They
came direct from Paris, intending to stay here only a few hours
before proceeding to Corton, but they stayed three days, hesitating
to face Mr Drayton. I understood in private from the bride that Mr
Bobbie had been intended by his guardian for someone else, and
hence the trouble. What makes the history delightfully romantic is
that Mr Bobbie appears to have been somehow despatched into the
country to 'seek' the lady who was intended for him&mdash;'seek' is
the word that was used&mdash;and while seeking her, he found the
actual Mrs Bobbie all too charming to be resisted, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is so, then: Bobbie is married!" exclaimed Dulaunay, with a
buffoon laugh; then seriously: "I fear that "Draytong" will not be
disposed to show himself content there."</p>

<p>"Serves the clown right," muttered Oswald, "this may check his
zeal in going about adopting strange boys."</p>

<p>"Well, so much for Mr Bobbie and his sweet bride!" said Miss
Scatchett. "But you, gentlemen, have you dined?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dulaunay, "we are not here but for a few minutes, to
get some papers from Mr "Draytong's" wardrobe, so we will not need
to give you any trouble. That would have been interesting, Oswald,
to witness the reception which "Draytong" gives to the two young
married! but they will be at Corton by ten, an hour before we
arrive there."</p>

<p>Little Miss Scatchett now rushed off in those brown silks which
were part of her personality, and the two men moved into the
morning room, where Dulaunay half sat on the table, his mind all
occupied still with the marriage of Bobbie, while Oswald threw
himself on a couch, palish and inwardly agitated at the thought
that those shreds of Letty's letter, which he had so longed for,
were about to be brought out from their secret place. The disgrace
and ruin which his attempt to get them had cost him only made them
the more infinitely an object of his greed; and they were about to
be carried carelessly in Dulaunay's pocket! yet Oswald's goaded
brain could invent no means of touching them.</p>

<p>Dulaunay's tongue still kept on running on the subject of
Bobbie's marriage, saying:</p>

<p>"'Draytong' will assuredly be very angry, I know it. He was most
eager that Bobbie should marry Rosie whom he sent him to seek, and
I believe it was the failure of Bobbie to return with her which
pushed him to the marriage with Martha."</p>

<p>"But who the deuce is the 'Rosie' whom he sent Bobbie to
'seek?'" asked Oswald, reclining with his hat over his brows: "what
is it all about?"</p>

<p>"Have I not explained it to you? Rosie is the good Martha's
daughter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear sir, I take, of course, no interest in the family-tree
of the good Martha," said Oswald with that half yawn of
indifference which men make when they are secretly agitated, "but
how on earth came this 'Rosie' to need any 'seeking'? There seems
to be a very absurd tangle somewhere."</p>

<p>"But have you not heard the good Martha recount her
history?"</p>

<p>"I may have," answered Oswald: "but one does not give oneself
the pains of storing up the gabble of low women like this good
Martha. I find the creature very offensive."</p>

<p>"But no, she is not offensive! at least I do not find her it!
What would you have? the average of humanity is not sublime, my
friend. At any rate, Martha has recounted me that the Rosie whom
Bobbie and then I were sent to seek is a daughter by her first
marriage, her first husband's name being Harper, so that Rosie's
name is Rose Harper. But here is that which is odd! that "Draytong"
was apparently ignorant of that fact, until I myself told him! for
he sent both me and Bobbie to seek this Rosie Harper in the name of
Rosie "Draytong"! What can be more singular, my friend?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the man's mad," said Oswald.</p>

<p>"Or is it not rather Martha whose mind is not of the strongest?"
asked the Count with perplexed brows: "it is certain that she has
made me statements which cannot be credited. She has said to me,
for instance, with insistence, that she and "Draytong" were really
married before the ceremony which you and I witnessed at Norwich.
This surely is among the things which do not permit themselves to
be believed!&mdash;that a man should remarry his own wife. The
truth must be that "Draytong" and Martha were together before
marriage, and only married when we saw them marry at Norwich. And
yet&mdash;strange circumstance! "Draytong" himself, on the day when
I was about to see Martha for the first time, said:-'I am about to
present you, Dulaunay, to my wife.' Moreover, "Draytong" once long
ago told the Lady Julia that he was married. Does not all this
confirm that which Martha says, that she was legally married to
"Draytong" long years before the ceremony which we witnessed at
Norwich? Only, it is not credible! One does not remarry one's wife
at any cost. If one commits the bigamy it is always with a third
person. And yet, if "Draytong" was not already married, what
possible power could have caused him to abandon the marriage with
his beloved Julia? <i>mon Dieu</i>, I understand nothing, nothing,
there!"</p>

<p>Dulaunay's two hands rose toward his head, as if inclined to
tear out his hair in an access of puzzlement. Oswald, too, who
understood nothing there, made a sound of contempt with is lips,
saying: "Queer people ought to be put into asylums. I have long
since ceased to puzzle out the vagaries of my excellent brother and
his distinguished wife. But very likely they were married before. I
have heard the woman say that she is from South Africa, and the man
was there a long time in his youth, I believe."</p>

<p>"But, if they were married before, what, then, could be the
motive of a second marriage? It is not conceivable!"</p>

<p>"Heaven knows. I don't care. Better go and get the shreds of
paper he sent you here for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But hold&mdash;you say that "Draytong" was in South Africa in
his youth? But no; there, I think, you are mistaken: for I remember
distinctly that Drayton said to me, when we were discussing a
voyage to South Africa in the yacht, that he had never been in
South Africa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He lied for some reason. He once lived there."</p>

<p>"Lied? But permit me to be frank, Oswald, and to say that the
tone which you adopt in discussing your brother is not pretty, my
friend. Mr "Draytong", I am able to assure you, is a man of strong
honor, though there may be some mysteries in his life. If we
consider his abandonment of the excellent Julia, it becomes clear
that his motives, whatever they may have been, were motives of the
highest sublimity, and so difficult to accomplish that, as we see,
they have even silvered his hair. To me personally "Draytong" is,
on the whole, the most venerable human being, the heaviest brain
and the strongest heart, which it has been my destiny to encounter:
and, you will admit, I am not without experience of men. As to his
statement that he had never been to South Africa, I am forced to
believe it, for I now remember several incidents which, when we
reached Cape Town, prove that he was a stranger to the country. If,
therefore, he did marry Martha before that inexplicable ceremony at
Norwich, it was certainly not in South Africa."</p>

<p>"My dear sir, think as you like; it is of no importance,"
murmured Oswald.</p>

<p>"No, the fact is," pursued Dulaunay, "that the good Martha is
not entirely credible on all points. She may have had an illness
which has weakened the mind, and indeed, she shows the traces of it
in all her air. The history, for instance, which she daily repeats
of having been locked up in the old tower five years by "Draytong"
belongs to the 'Thousand Nights and One Night.' It is not
compatible with "Draytong's" present devotion to her."</p>

<p>"But I have asked the man, Steve, if it is true about the
locking up in the tower," said Oswald, "and as far as I could
understand the fellow, he rather seemed to admit it. Beautiful
mediaevalism of the gentle James, that imprisonment in a tower! But
I think that I should myself have kept Martha under lock and key,
if she had been mine: the wonder is that he ever let her out to
bore the world."</p>

<p>"But I find her very well, the good Martha!" cried Dulaunay with
opening arms: "we cannot all be brilliant wits and great minds like
you, Oswald. But I see you are of a bad humour to-day. Well, then,
I will now go up and get the shreds of paper, and we will then at
once return to Corton, that we may hear how the two young married
have been received by "Draytong". That would have been a situation
worthy to be seen! "Draytong" will not have permitted himself to
flame into an anger, I think, but he will have looked at them
sideward with a certain vivacity of the eye, the significance of
which the gallant Bobbie will perhaps be likely to remember, oh,
la, la! Well, I go up&mdash;But no, you are wrong, Oswald, to
credit the statements of either Martha or Steve as to that
imprisonment in the tower. Steve is <i>toque, maboule,
loufoque</i>&mdash;how do you say?&mdash;'daft.'</p>

<p>"No, that would not nave been able to happen, my friend. The
unfailing chivalry of "Draytong" to the somewhat commonplace Martha
is in reality one of the sublimest of spectacles, and for us, who
daily witness it, it is not possible to imagine that he once shut
her up five years."</p>

<p>The Count said these last words on the stairs, going up for the
shreds, for Oswald had followed him out of the morning room, rather
to Dulaunay's surprise, since Oswald did not usually give himself
any unnecessary trouble; and still discussing "Draytong," Martha,
Rosie, Bobbie, and the position of affairs at Corton. They entered
Hartwell's room on the first floor, with Oswald, who was a shade
paler now, at Dulaunay's heels. And Dulaunay inserted the key which
Hartwell had given him into that wardrobe which contained the
shreds of Letty Barnes' letter to Julia.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>XXVIII. &mdash; HARTWELL IS
TRAPPED</h2>

<p class="first">It was nearly night, and as Dulaunay opened the
wardrobe, and began to feel in the pockets of the garments hung up
there, he reached aside and pressed down an electric switch, filing
the large room with light. Meantime, Oswald paced to and fro
between the heavy Henri Quatre bedstead and the wardrobe, conscious
of the preciousness of the seconds that were even then passing over
him, but conscious also of his lack of power to rise to the height
of their importance. He felt that if now, while the wardrobe was
open, and while the shreds wore not yet found by Dulaunay, he could
invent some means of making Dulaunay go out of the chamber for one
minute, some excuse, some ruse, in that minute he could secure the
shreds: here was the "Golden Opportunity," the chance that comes
only once for over: but even as the chance passed and passed,
Oswald was unequal to it. The flying moments, compared with the
action of his intellect, were like race-horses compared to an ox
stuffed with grass which heavily trots after them. The finding of
the shreds, meantime, was no momentary matter: Dulaunay dived into
pocket after pocket, sometimes bringing out other papers or
letters, which he opened to see if they contained any shreds,
half-absently running his eye over them, and still chatting about
Hartwell, Julia, Martha, and about Hartwell's great electrical
invention, the testing of which was to take place in three days'
time, on the Tuesday of the following week, this day being a
Saturday. Oswald, pacing to and fro, uttered not a word, nor heard
a word of what was being said; even his footsteps were inaudible in
the thick carpet; so that all at once, when the Count's talk was
arrested by one of the papers over which he had glanced, perfect
silence was in the chamber for a minute or two, broken only by a
whisper of "<i>Mon Dieu</i>!" uttered under his breath by
Dulaunay.</p>

<p>The paper at which Dulaunay was then staring was a
marriage-certificate. He had found it in a breast-pocket of a coat
of Hartwell's; and it recorded the marriage of James Drayton and
Martha Harper in the town of Colesberg, South Africa, over sixteen
years before.</p>

<p>Hartwell had found this certificate of marriage a couple of
years before this time in an old trunk of Drayton's at the estate
in Bucks; it had happened during his long yachting cruise over the
world, before he had fallen ill at Siena, had there seen Julia on
opening his eyes, and had become engaged to her; he had put the
certificate in the pocket of the coat in which it was now found by
Dulaunay, and had left it at Addison Road on his return journey
from the estate in Bucks to the yacht.</p>

<p>Again Dulaunay breathed the exclamation, "<i>mon Dieu</i>!" as
during a minute or two he stared at the old marriage lines. He had,
as he had just said to Oswald, proof on proof that "Draytong" had
never been in South Africa, apart from "Draytong's" own assertion
that he had never been there: yet, here was an equally strong proof
that "Draytong" had married there.</p>

<p>Now, two seeming facts, mutually contradictory, yet each equally
proved to be certain, always pressingly spur the mind to prove to
itself its own sanity by getting at the actual truth: and this was
what now happened to Dulaunay. He put the certificate into his
pocket, then after another half-minute's' hurried search found the
shreds for which he had been sent, put them, too, into his pocket,
said to Oswald, "I pray you to wait me here some minutes, Oswald,"
and, going out of the door, again murmured blankly to himself,
"<i>mon Dieu</i>! I understand nothing there."</p>

<p>He ran up the stair as if in haste to catch or find something
that was eluding him, entered his own room, closed the door upon
himself, threw himself upon a couch, shut his eyes, and lay
frowning with thought. He felt that he was on the verge of
unravelling some extraordinary thing, and that the darkness which
still surrounded his mind was like that dense darkness of the
foreday, when men yet have an instinct, of the coming light, and
wait with assurance for its appearance.</p>

<p>He lay in deep thought a considerable time with one hand on the
certificate of marriage, while below Oswald continued to pace,
thinking bitterly that now the shreds were in Dulaunay's pocket,
and the great chance, never to come again, had been allowed to
slip; there now occurred to Oswald more than one plan by which he
might have secured the shreds while Dulaunay had the wardrobe open,
and not only had he now the plans, but now, when it was too late,
he felt the courage, the capacity, the address, which three minutes
previously might have been sufficient to secure him the shreds,
while his breast broadened at the feeling which he spurred in
himself that for the future he would not fail to be equal to all
the exigencies of life; but at the very same time a remorseful
whisper of his consciousness&mdash;that whisper which is said to
increase the torments of hell&mdash;said within him: "A fool is a
man who is wise too late; and if you had a second chance, or a
hundredth, you would still be your self, and would still lack a
capable soul."</p>

<p>He waited so long, that he grew weary, stopped pacing, searched
without motive in all the pockets of the clothes in the wardrobe,
found nothing of any interest, and finally went to one of the front
windows of the room, looking out, leaning on his stick, with his
hard-felt hat, which was a delicate shade of brown, tilted on his
forehead. It was night now, the street lamps lit, and a pelting
shower of rain was falling; he saw the yard and the breadth of the
street beyond looking like a plain grown with a thick short crop of
white grass, caused by the rebound of the splashing rain; there
stood the cab in which he and Dulaunay had come, waiting for them;
and on the top of that, too, and all along the top of the front
wall, sprouted the crop of white grass; in dashed the cringing
figure of a butcher's man with a tray of meat for Miss Scatchett's
household, and disappeared behind an angle of the house; it was a
quarter of an hour before he dashed out again: and still Dulaunay
did not come. Oswald looked at his watch: it was ten minutes past
eight.</p>

<p>The Count still lay in the dark room above, thinking out the
mystery of Hartwell's life, and before his mental review passed
nearly every incident of his connection with Hartwell, begun just
about five years before, one rainy night at Liverpool Street
Station.</p>

<p>More than anything else the strangeness of that meeting now
struck him. He had sat down in "Draytong's" brougham to escape
from, the rain; and "Draytong," suddenly appearing, had proffered
him his hand. "Draytong" had asked him about things at Addison
Road, about the health of Miss Scatchett, had taken him for an old
acquaintance&mdash;. Was it not odd? Where could the mind begin to
penetrate a mystery so dark? The strangeness of the thing had more
or less faded from the consciousness of the Count in the course of
years: but when one sat and reconsidered it, then that strangeness
was even wild, was even exasperating to the reason. Reason said,
"It never could have happened"; but memory, at war with reason,
replied, "I did happen."</p>

<p>"Draytong" had said in the brougham as they drove toward Addison
Road: "You do not ask me anything about my motor-car
accident&mdash;" and at one time Dulaunay had thought that a blow
received in that accident may really have injured "Draytong's"
brain, as "Draytong" pretended, causing him to mistake Dulaunay for
someone else; later on Dulaunay had believed that "Draytong"
purposely played a comedy, pretending to an old acquaintanceship
with the Count, through having taken a fancy to him at first sight;
many theories, in fact, had at one time, or another been built up
by Dulaunay to explain that singular commencement of the friendship
between himself and Hartwell: but none of those theories had been
satisfactory, and they seemed wild enough this night when a host of
other incidents, all evidently connected with one great original
mystery, were called up in his memory, and passed before his
criticism.</p>

<p>There was the motor car accident&mdash;"Draytong's" mind had not
been injured thereby: that was certain; no sounder intelligence
existed than "Draytong's." But something had occurred at that
accident! some imbroglio with a man named "Hartwell!" There were
the ravings of "Draytong" during his illness at Siena; there, was
that perplexity depicted on his face when he had said: "Am I
Hartwell; or am I Drayton?" and when he had said again: "The faces
are one&mdash;how if the natures be one also? and which of the two
am I, am I?" Those had been words of no meaning then, either to
Julia or to Dulaunay; but Dulaunay remembered them, every one, and
now, when he faced and questioned them stubbornly, they seemed to
whisper to him a truth, though afar off, as it were, and in a
language which he did not understand. There were also the delirious
man's moments of agitation, his hoarse whispers: "The dead know not
anything&mdash;I will change clothes&mdash;Hartwell shall be
Drayton, the beggar the millionaire&mdash;the coat, the waistcoat,
now the collar&mdash;no one on the road, McCalmont dead!" And there
were the somnambulisms, those haggard, wandering nightmares, when,
staring blindly at the mirror, "Draytong" had often again repeated
in pain those names of Hartwell and Drayton, and been uncertain
which of the two he was.</p>

<p>The mystery seemed to be the mystery of two men, then, not of
one: two men "whose faces were one."</p>

<p>Dulaunay had been so sure that "Draytong" had never been to
South Africa before that trip in the yacht! but, the marriage
certificate proved that he had been there. As soon, however, as
Dulaunay took it for granted that "Draytong" had certainly been
there, had married Martha there, he found himself confronted with a
host of dark facts, such as that "Draytong" had not apparently
known that "Harper" was the name of the daughter of the woman whom
he had married as Martha Harper: "Draytong" had apparently supposed
that Rosie was his own daughter, and was named Drayton! How
account, moreover, for the fact that "Draytong" had remarried that
same Martha who had already been married by him in South Africa?
How account for the fact that "Draytong" had sworn to Julia in the
rocca at Siena that he was not married? Was "Draytong," then,
infamous? No, the truth must be that "Draytong" had never married
in South Africa, and "hat the marriage certificate related to
another man who had taken the name of "Draytong." And Dulaunay at
once rushed to the conclusion the name of that other man must be
Hartwell.</p>

<p>And "Draytong" and this unknown Hartwell were so precisely alike
that Martha, the wife of Hartwell, believed that they were one.</p>

<p>That was odd! and yet not so odd; the Count remembered how "Dray
tong" came to be so unlike his brother Oswald. Julia had told him
the story&mdash;How "Draytong" was the image of a captain who had
extravagantly terrified his mother. But since this South African
Hartwell, having "the same face" as "Draytong," must also be the
image of that captain, then there may have been two terrified
mothers&mdash;Dulaunay decided that this must really have been
so.</p>

<p>Hartwell, therefore, had taken the name of "Draytong" in South
Africa, and there married Martha Harper. This was what the Count at
first concluded; but at once this theory was faced with a great
number of difficulties. With what motive, then, had "Draytong," the
rich man, permitted Martha to think that he was Hartwell, the poor
man? With what motive had he abandoned the beloved Julia to marry
Martha, Hartwell's wife? How came Oswald to be so certain that
"Draytong," his brother, had not only been, but had lived, for
years, in South Africa? The Count felt that his theory was wrong
somewhere.</p>

<p>For some twenty minutes his thoughts toiled, without progress,
in this strait. Then there came a moment when he said to himself:
"Since one of the two men, Hartwell and "Draytong," has lived in
South Africa, but the other has never lived there; and since the
one who lived there was Oswald's brother, and the one who never
lived there is the man I know as "Draytong," therefore the man I
know as "Draytong" is not Oswald's brother; but Oswald's brother is
certainly named "Draytong"; therefore the man I know as "Draytong"
is not really named "Draytong", but is really named Hartwell; and
Hartwell took the name of "Draytong", not in South Africa, where he
never lived, but in England, at the motor-car accident, where the
real "Draytong" was killed, where 'the dead know not anything'
where 'the beggar became the millionaire'&mdash;and 'the clothes
were changed'&mdash;the coat, the waistcoat, now the
'collar'&mdash;'no one on the road&mdash;'McCalmont dead,' and 'the
dead know not anything."'</p>

<p>At this thought Dulaunay sat electrified, pale but for a stain
of crimson on one side of his face, as "when a great thought
strikes along the brain, and flashes all the cheek." The mystery
lay solved, and every incident which had arisen out of it, every
motive of Hartwell's conduct, was now clear to the understanding,
which was henceforth like a vault flooded with light, the key
having once been found to throw open the door.</p>

<p>Thus, with hardly any new facts to guide him through the maze,
Dulau nay, by the mere passage of time and ripeness of his
consciousness, together with a little thinking, came out into
daylight. He even wondered now why he had not seen, years before,
what he now saw; but this would not have been possible for that
very reason, that his consciousness had not been ripe, that a
sufficient length of time had not matured the fruit of knowledge,
even though he had had clues to the mystery of Hartwell's life
which no one else possessed. The knowledge of the truth is, really,
like a fruit which cannot be plucked much before it is ripe. It was
always, for instance, an open secret that it is the earth, not the
sun, which goes round: but men greater than Solomon could not
attain to it, till it somehow bent down to the grasp of men. The
fruit may, indeed, be plucked a little before it is ripe by the
"men in advance of their age," etc., but these Galileos suffer
those sharp cracks on the knuckles which one Mother Eve suffered,
whereas, if she had not plucked, but waited, the fruit of knowledge
would of itself, in time, have dropped over ripe, into her lap; she
might then have eaten it, and nothing would have been said.
Dulaunay, however, was not of this aggressive Galileo-type, but
simply a vivacious mind, receptive of ideas when they were
presented to him, so that only in the fullness of time was the
knowledge of the whole truth about Hartwell born of itself, after a
short travail, in him.</p>

<p>His first feeling was a natural exultation at his discovery, the
chuckle of self-congratulation, and the busybody zest of one who
alone holds the key to a scandal of great magnitude; he laughed
flippantly within himself, thinking: "Here is a history, this
affair here, oh, la, la!" Then, when the levity of his first
amazement passed off, he was struck by an impression of the
greatness and pity of it all, of the gravity of the issues which
spring from human action, and the abysm which the heart is.
Hartwell, whom he still in his thoughts called
"Draytong"&mdash;Hartwell, the respected, the grave thinker about
man and God, whose work had been crowned, whose tone suggested a
moral strength incapable of frailty, who was adored by one of the
most admirable of patrician women, this Hartwell was one of the
great impostors of modern society. Indignation and shame now
flushed Dulaunay's brow. He did not understand that Hartwell was
not bound by the moral code of "a good Catholic" and "a man of
honour" like himself; the excellent Count had accepted without
question "a moral code" and "a code of honour" which had been made
for him long before he was born, and he did not reflect that a man
of profoundly original and vigorous mind like Hartwell cannot
consider himself subject to any ready made code, but must needs
start afresh, as though he were the first man who ever lived,
looking into the nature of things with his own eyes, and making his
own code, which may be right or wrong, according to the depth of
his insight. Hartwell had never suffered one qualm for assuming the
name and estate of Drayton; the word "impostor" was a less
contemptuous word to his mind than the words "dervish" or "curate":
but to Dulaunay it was a word full of shame.</p>

<p>But that was only the first glaring fact about Hartwell which
struck the mind, that he was an impostor: there were other facts of
a different sort; and lying on the sofa in the dark room, the Count
saw them all in a clear light&mdash;saw them with murmurs of
reverence, and with pangs of pity. The motive with which Hartwell
had married Drayton's wife was no longer obscure: it was in order
that he might cut off with a ruthless knife from his heart the
temptation to abandon her for the beloved Julia; "In which case,"
thought the Count, "that is not astonishing that the hairs of that
erring, but venerable head, have silvered themselves." The truth of
what Martha constantly asserted, that she had been isolated from
the world for five years in the tower at Corton was now for the
first time believed by Dulaunay; it was the dead Drayton who had
thus isolated her, and it was Hartwell who had set her free, at a
moment when her freedom meant the ruin of all his hopes. The Count
was able to guess that at the time when Hartwell vowed to Julia at
Siena that he was not married, he probably did not know where
Martha was, or if she were dead or alive, though he must have known
of the fact of Drayton's marriage to her; then, on the eve of his
marriage with Julia, Hartwell had gone down to Corton, and had
discovered Martha in her prison. What a war in the mind or the
ill-fated Hartwell must then have taken place! The contrast between
the two women&mdash;Martha and Lady Julia&mdash;presented itself
strongly to the Count's mental vision: the one so special, and also
so beloved, the other so common and cheap, and hard to love. If on
that discovery in the tower at Corton, Hartwell desired, even to
madness, the death of Martha, that would have been only natural; he
must have desired it: it required no very deep sympathy to be able
to perceive what at that time could not have failed to transact
itself in Hartwell's soul. He had vowed to Julia at Siena that no
impediment existed in the way of their marriage, and the continued
existence of this Martha, this pseudo wife suddenly discovered in
the tower, meant not merely the wreck of his and Julia's happiness,
but it meant that Julia and all who knew of his vow, must needs
despise him as the most perjured of ruffians. What even "a man of
honour" and "a good Catholic" might, in so harassing a situation,
have done, or might have been tempted to do, was terrible to think
of; at least he might have left Martha in the isolation where
Drayton had placed her, running the risk of her existence some day
coming to light, and he might still, in spite of her, have married
Julia; this, indeed, would have been very natural: for Martha at
that time was nothing to Hartwell; she was Drayton's wife, and
Drayton had isolated her. But Hartwell had compassionated her, had
liberated, married her; and these reflections stirred emotions so
lively in the Count, that he had an impulse to hasten straight way
to Hartwell, to kiss his hand like a disciple, and to say: "I know
all! and I condemn, I pity, but above all I revere you."</p>

<p>How and why that marriage with Martha had been made necessary
was now very evident: Bobbie had been sent into the country to
seek, the girl, Rosie, in order that, when Rosie came, Hartwell
might be able to desert Martha without leavings her desolate; the
rash engagement, meantime, of Julia with the Arch-Duke's heir must
have powerfully spurred Hartwell to cast Martha to the winds, to
prostrate himself at the feet of his beloved, and to tell her that
he was not so perjured a wretch as she could not fail to suppose
him; but Bobbie had not come with Rosie: Bobbie had, apparently,
been occupying his time in conjugal escapades with another than
Rosie; and finally Hartwell, finding his human nature all too weak
for the task which he had assumed, finding that he could not be a
faithful husband to her who was not his wife, had brusquely ended
the conflict with in him by a suicide of his heart and hope, and
had made Martha his legal wife.</p>

<p>No great effort of penetration was needed on the part of the
excellent Count in order to make these conjectures about Hartwell's
late sufferings and motives; within the last few months he had seen
as it were years added to Hartwell's age, a resignation in
Hartwell's smile, a silent experience of grief in his glance, the
tufting of his hair with grey, and a stooping of his shoulders as
under a heavy burden. The Count had inwardly bemoaned his friend
without fathoming the full cause of all this: and now, fathoming
it, he muttered to himself at one moment: "Here, then, I think, is
a piece of human clay not without cracks, yet a master-man (<i>un
homme maître</i>), and worthy to be loved."</p>

<p>His first practical decision was to hie straight to Julia and
tell her all: and as this occurred to him, he leapt up from the
couch, at the same time hearing Oswald's voice outside on the
stairs calling: "I say, aren't you coming? We shall miss the
train." To which Dulaunay called back: "I come at the instant even!
Wait me!"</p>

<p>He stood a minute longer where he was, confirming himself in his
decision. Yes, he would go to Julia. Two days ago she was in
London, he knew, and probably still was. He would tell all that
very night. This would cause him to miss the train, but there was
no necessity for him to return to Corton that night: he would give
Oswald the shreds for which he had been sent; Oswald would take
them down to "Draytong," and he himself would at once call upon the
admirable Julia.</p>

<p>His nerves danced with excited anticipation at the greatness of
the effect which his revelation must produce upon Julia; the zeal
of a disciple to preach Hartwell to her so possessed him, that his
Gallic impetuosity forefelt the impatience which would be his
during the slow cab drive between Addison Road and Brook Street. He
knew that in preaching Hartwell to her, he would be preaching to
ears eager enough to hear; nor was he under any obligation to
Hartwell to keep secret what his own wits had unearthed. Next to
"Draytong's" friendship, his intimacy with Julia was the most
precious of his flighty life's experiences; here was the first
lovely woman whom he had learned to love without desiring for
himself; he desired her for another; and this unselfish flame had
long been the source within him of much pure, and rather novel,
emotion. She had taught him long before the rupture with Hartwell
to regard her as a dear friend and sister, unique among women, and
high aloof from his ordinary gallantries; but since the rupture she
had become to him that which is more than a friend&mdash;a friend
in despair, for whom he could do nothing, and her image in his
heart had now acquired something almost of saintship, halooed with
the sacredness which a great misfortune, borne with resignation,
confers. Since the rupture he had been much in her company, both in
London, and abroad; at a score of meetings had they discussed in
private intimacy the strange, disastrous conduct of Hartwell; but
the Count's words of consolation, in the dark as he himself was,
had had only the value which friendship and sincerity gave them: to
say and many times repeat that "Draytong for ever adores you,
Julia," or that "Draytong is the soul of honour," or that "Draytong
if not deranged" had not been to prove that it was true. He had
seen Julia desperately drifting into marriage with the Gross-Herzog
P&mdash;&mdash;, and for her sake, not for Hartwell's, had tried
his best to warn her back, but without effect. He now hoped that
what he was about to tell her might even yet avert that marriage.
He felt himself the good Providence of Julia and of Hartwell, and,
full of this busy, self-important feeling, he rushed out of the
room and down the stairs: Julia should know the whole shameful and
sublime truth of how "Draytong" had sinned, had achieved, and had
suffered: and she should judge him for herself.</p>

<p>He met Oswald awaiting him below at the door of the
morning-room, and he said hurriedly:</p>

<p>"I regret to have made you to wait, Oswald. Something has
arrived to me which will prevent me from returning to Corton
to-night."</p>

<p>"My dear sir, you are erratic," said Oswald: "I am not going to
stay here. I shall simply go back to Corton with out you."</p>

<p>"But, yes! why not? It is even that which I supposed that you
would do, my friend. We have little need, I think, of the
protection one of the other? I, of my part, will sleep here under
the auspices of the good Miss Scatchett, and perhaps you will tell
her this presently for me. On Monday, in the afternoon, I will
rejoin you at Corton. Only I pray you to let me take the cab which
waits us at the gate, and to find yourself another, since I am
pressed to arrive somewhere; you will perhaps also be good enough
to place in the hand of "Draytong" this envelope which he sent me
to seek, and to make for me my compliments and excuses to himself
and to the excellent Martha."</p>

<p>In saying this, he had taken the envelope containing the shreds
from his pocket, and he handed it to Oswald; nor would he have
believed even an angel, we may suppose, who had said to him then:
"This act of yours is a stroke of destiny by which you work the
total overthrow of him whom you love."</p>

<p>Oswald's hand went out and took that envelope which by no use of
his wits he had been able to touch, but which now of its own accord
came in to his possession.</p>

<p>He had learned at least one good habit in the distinguished
circles in which he had moved, the habit of hiding his emotions
under a reposeful exterior; but he was unhinged in a rather
singular way by this event, it was so great and sudden: he neither
reddened nor turned pale, but he became quite awkward; he took the
envelope sheepishly, like a man detected in a theft, and, having
taken it, still held it out a little toward Dulaunay, as if
offering it back, or as if afraid of seeming to be too greedy to
rush it into his pocket; and he smiled a maudlin smile, which, put
into words, would have said: "It is nothing to me, this envelope; I
am not really so very anxious as you may imagine to take charge of
it, nor so overjoyed to have it burning between my fingers; my
blood is not tingling with suppressed elation, nor shall I laugh
and shout the moment your back is turned, when I shall fully
realise that you are really gone, and have really left this thing
with me; no, all this is only your fancy, and you have still a
chance to change your mind, and take the envelope back from
me."</p>

<p>But Dulaunay did not even notice that shamefaced smile, much
less understand its meaning. He even now did not know anything
about Oswald's imprisonment by Hartwell, he had been abroad at his
chateau at the time, and the sensation caused by the scandal had
been mostly local in the West End clubland; nor had Hartwell
mentioned it since to Dulaunay, nor had Julia, nor Oswald himself.
Even if the Count had known it, he might still have given the
envelope to Oswald, for he had no reason to think that the shreds
were of any special weight or secrecy; he knew, indeed, that Oswald
did not seem to love his supposed brother; but then Oswald, who had
been specially glum of late, seemed to love no one with much heat.
On the whole, Dulaunay handed the envelope to him without a doubt
or afterthought in his mind, said <i>au revoir</i>, ran out into
the rain to the waiting cab, and started for Brook Street, in order
to tell Julia all.</p>

<p>Oswald, for his part, re-entered the morning room; threw the
envelope on the table; and began to pace with his usual limp, his
hat pushed back on his head, his two hands in his pockets, and a
flush now on his bald brow; for the moment he looked like an elated
book-maker, who has won something; as he paced, his glance rested
frequently on the envelope; and suddenly one breath of laughter,
which was hysterical in its essence, broke from his lips.</p>

<p>"James, James," he murmured presently in a deep voice, and
suddenly again gave vent to a short laugh.</p>

<p>In those minutes the whole look of life was moving before his
consciousness into transformation, like the gradual working of the
shades,of night into morning. This was the hour of Oswald's
exceeding satisfaction. After a life which had been hampered by a
chronic lack of funds, he loved money for its own sake, and that
simple-looking envelope on the table made him very rich. And beyond
the actual facts of his great luck, his fancy, becoming exalted,
painted him with a rapid brush many warm visions of happiness and
power: he hoped that by a display of his new wealth, he would now
regain a footing in those empyrean circles from which his false
step in attempting to steal the shreds had cast him like some
Lucifer; there even floated through his mind a thought of Julia,
and the possibility either of winning her after all, or of being
somehow revenged on her; but dearer than all else was the luxurious
power which he now held in his hand of crushing him whom he
supposed to be his brother.</p>

<p>His feeling toward Hartwell at this date was entirely different
from what it had been toward the real Drayton. He had disdained and
also disliked Drayton with a certain distinguished weariness; but
he respected and truly hated Hartwell. This new feeling was more
complex and far more heartfelt than the old. In real
hatred&mdash;though the statement may seem strange&mdash;there is
much of love; for hatred and love are different forms of the same
sickness or infection, and are so near akin that the hand that is
raised to strike sometimes falls with a caress. The fact about
Oswald was, that he had been caught in the draught of Hartwell's
stronger nature, as a boat is sucked into the wake of a ship: he
was compelled to feel deeply in some way toward Hartwell, to love
or to hate, and he hated; but this hatred suffered many of the
pangs of love. When, for instance, Hartwell had caused him to be
cast into prison, Oswald's heart had been wounded in a manner in
which the real Drayton never could have wounded it; he had sobbed
to himself: "I never supposed that he would crush me so; he
forgets; he does not care, that I am his brother." By the time he
had come out of prison, a settled venom against "James," a longing
for revenge, had taken possession of his mind; but this ill-feeling
was not a simple, but a complex, feeling: he had been glad to be
taken to Corton because Hartwell was at Corton, he liked the whist
party nights when for two hours and a half he might sit morose in
Hartwell's immediate presence; he was as jealous as a jealous lover
of the count, of Martha, of Julia, of Bobbie, because they occupied
some of Hartwell's thoughts; he was morbidly sensitive if Hartwell
in any trivial way in the routine of daily life at Corton seemed to
slight or despise him; Hartwell had become his heart's disease,
haunting all his emotions: and if Oswald had hot wished to stab his
"James," he would have wished to embrace him. Hence the doggedness
with which he had questioned the Gissings in order to obtain the
desired clue about Letty Barnes; for it was now necessary to his
peace to be in some sort of relation with Hartwell, to act upon
him, and be reacted upon by him in some way, to touch him at one
point, to be his master somehow, or his slave somehow: he was
inversely "in love"&mdash;<i>epris</i>, as the French say, "taken"
or "captivated," as we say; and because his hatred was this inverse
sort of morbid love, therefore it was all the more genuine,
heartfelt and terrible.</p>

<p>He rang the bell, and sat to the table. A footman in half-dress
came in. "John," said Oswald, "I want you to find me some gum and a
pair of scissors,&mdash;as quickly as you can."</p>

<p>The man went out and in a few minutes returned with the gum and
scissors. Oswald then spread the shreds before him on the table,
and began to fit their edges together. He found the work deeply
interesting, every fit being to him a childish pleasure of
achievement. He cut with the scissors small oblong patches from a
letter taken out of his pocket, put gum on them, and fastened the
shreds with them, without letting the patches cover any of the
writing. In the end he got a nickety, stiff letter, but easy enough
to read. Only one shred was missing in the centre, the one on which
was "cruel bru," and this he had safe, though not with him.</p>

<p>He now read the letter through. It was all that was needed to
prove Drayton's intimacy with Letty Barnes, and its nature. Letty
warned Lady Julia against marriage with Drayton, sketched the
history of her own relation with him, spoke of their meeting on
Cromer Pier, of their stay at the Gissing's cottage, of the
"scream" which she had heard coming from the tower at
Corton&mdash;just such a letter as a wronged and jealous girl would
write to her lover's future wife, full of self-pity, of
over-anxiety for the future wife's welfare, and an unbridled animus
against the wrongdoer. Adding to the letter the points which
Hartwell's own frequent reasonings on the murder had made clear,
the chain of proof against Hartwell as the author of Letty's death
was complete.</p>

<p>Oswald again paced the room, feeling now ill-at-ease, almost
wretched, the reason being that in this new world of happiness in
which he suddenly found himself he stood with nothing to do, while
all his being demanded instant and boisterous action. He did not
know how he was to live through the night, and longed for the
morrow. A rush of happiness always has this restless effect, as if
an increase of vitality were pumped into the limbs, impelling one
to run and exert one's vigour, but one finds oneself bound and must
remain inert: by the time one can act, one has worn oneself out
with inward fretting, and the pleasure of action is spoiled. Oswald
longed to fly to Corton; but he could hardly go that night, had
missed the train, and if he took a later train, Gloucester would
not be at the station to meet him with the trap. He thought of
telegraphing to Hartwell, and at first the telegram was short:
"Sleep well," then it grew in his thoughts into "Sleep well for my
sake, James," and then his thoughts added and added to it, till he
had quite a long telegram in his head, but he did not send it,
uncertain whether he should sign it "Oswald," or "your brother," or
"your dear brother."</p>

<p>After half an hour, in order to do something, Oswald rang again
and when the footman appeared, said to him, "You might send Miss
Scatchett to me John."</p>

<p>Presently the alert, bird-like figure of Miss Scatchett looked
in. There was always something out of joint between this lady's
littleness on the one hand, and the queenliness of her position; on
the other, she seemed ever stretching to be taller than she was;
her silks, however, her mistress air, and the real dignity of her
old-established maidenhood, combined to keep her on her throne of
state. She had been the real Drayton's housekeeper for seven years
before his death.</p>

<p>'"Miss Scatchett," said Oswald, "I wish to speak with you. Sit
down." He was now reclining on a lounge, pretending to himself and
tor her to be languid and uninterested. "I wanted to know how many
servants you keep here."</p>

<p>"Five at present," she said, without showing the surprise which
she felt; "the normal number is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, yon may at once send two of them away," he said wearily,
interrupting her: "treat them liberally, you know, but you have no
need of them. I have to tell you also that in a month or six weeks
I shall be shutting up or selling this place, and then, I suppose,
our connection will terminate, Miss Scatchett."</p>

<p>She perked the head as a somewhat startled canary might, and
with eyes just so innocent and mild as a bird's looked at him with
grave interest; The words seemed crazy to her, and she said: "I'm
afraid I do not quite follow you, sir."</p>

<p>"I suppose not. Well, then, I must tell you that you are no
longer in the employ of my brother, but in mine, Miss Scatchett.
This place is mine, all that he ever had is mine. I need not be at
the pains to explain how this has come about, but it is so. My good
brother has got himself into certain embarrassments, and has
transferred everything to me. I mean to make some enormous
changes&mdash;But do not let this upset you. I shall settle upon
you personally a substantial annuity, and probably gel you another
place as good us this, or better. I mean to be liberal to the
bounds of dissoluteness. Mr James Drayton has rather collapsed,
Miss Scatchett."</p>

<p>She continued to look with grave interest at Oswald; he seemed
sober, he seemed sane: yet in the words, even in his calm air,
there lurked something of lunacy, limbo, and intoxication. Miss
Scatchett had to believe, yet did not quite believe. "This is
surely surprising, sir," she said, at a loss what to say: "I heard
from Mr Drayton on Wednesday, and he said not one word&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No doubt. Yet it is as true, Miss Scatchett, as that that light
is shining. Who lives will see! My brother has run too far and too
fast, Miss Scatchett, and now has got into difficulties. He has
pretended to think nothing of me, to despise me; but now all, all,
depends on my whim. That's rather a good thing, don't you think?
where it says, 'The stone which the builders rejected, the same is
become the head of the corner'&mdash;that's rather good. Well, that
is all I had to-say for the present, Miss Scatchett. Good
night&mdash;. Who lives will see."</p>

<p>Miss Scatchett stood with a suspended air and mild eyes of
meditation; then she started slightly, and said: "What you say is
certainly startling, sir. I only hope that nothing lamentable has
occurred. But at least may I await instructions from Mr Drayton
himself before dismissing the two servants?"</p>

<p>"If you like," said Oswald, with a very heavy sigh and sudden
weariness of this playing at action: "be good enough to leave me
now."</p>

<p>"Do you sleep here to-night, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, I go home to my chambers."</p>

<p>"I presume that Mr Dulaunay has returned to Corton?"</p>

<p>"No. I believe he's coining back here to sleep. But you won't
see much of the Frenchman for the future, I fancy, Miss
Scatchett."</p>

<p>Miss Scatchett went out musing with a sideward head upon this
extraordinary interview; and a few minutes afterwards Oswald, to
avoid a meeting with Dulaunay, left the house.</p>

<p>He arrived in a cab near ten at his chambers, two top-rooms in a
small street of small houses running parallel with Piccadilly on
the south side. He found his Irish servant, Magee, whose only work
of late had been forwarding letters, entertaining two men and a
woman in the sitting room with Saturday night cordiality, whereat
Oswald grumbled, but not very loudly, for he was afraid of Magee,
whom he could not live without, whom he had thrice turned away,
only to take him back after a few days' misery in some new
servant's hands; and ordinarily the word "Magee" was the word more
frequently uttered by Oswald's lips than any other.</p>

<p>After the rout of Magee's party, Oswald threw himself into the
semi-circular lounge which shut in the copper-vaulted fireplace,
sighed, and seemed lost in reverie, while Magee, a handy, small
fellow, born to be a valet, stood expectant of orders. The small
room, in which taste was the rather self-conscious mistress, was
cosy with the red glamor of the lamp-shade and the fire flickering
on dull-red tiles; all was primly elegant; the few unobtrusive
pictures exactly fitted into the wall-spaces in which stood the
oak, the plain Donegal carpet, and the terracotta walls made a
harmony of color.</p>

<p>"I am sleeping here to-night Magee," said Oswald after a time.
"I suppose you wish me to the devil, if the truth were known, but I
am independent of you now, my friend. Why didn't you come down to
Corton to me?"</p>

<p>"Had no orders, sir," said Magee on one knee, unlacing Oswald's
boots.</p>

<p>"You don't wait for orders, when you want to do anything, Magee.
You didn't want to leave town, I suppose, of you would have come.
But I mean to make you skip for the future, if you don't look after
me. What's all the news about?"</p>

<p>"Only old news, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe your bulls are a pose, my friend. You are
conscious that if you didn't make bulls I should have kicked you to
the devil years ago, Magee."</p>

<p>"Sure, sir," said Magee, "you couldn't make a bull out of me not
if you were to kill me just now. I've been that put about by what
happened to you, sir. Thank God to see you looking so wonderfully
hearty, sir, after the miserable treatment you've been put to,
sir."</p>

<p>"I suppose you guessed that I was innocent, Magee. It wasn't
banknotes that I wanted to take, but a letter which I knew would
convict the ruffian of a crime. But I've got it now at last,
Magee."</p>

<p>"Sure, I knew that you were innocent, sir," said Magee, putting
Oswald into a dressing gown: "I knew it very well even before your
brother's letter to the paper saying that it wasn't any banknotes
that you were after taking from his wardrobe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which letter to which papers, you idiot?"</p>

<p>"Sure, I thought that you would know, sir! That's funny that
your brother himself hasn't told you, sir. He wrote to the papers
saying&mdash;well, I've still the papers put up in some hole in my
bedroom and you can look through them with your own hands, sir. It
is supposed that it is this letter of your brother that was the
means of narrowing down the length of your sentence at the
tail-end, sir; but, as I said to Lady Methwold's Thomas, 'It is all
very well for him to be writing letters to the papers now, but all
the ink in the world shall not whitewash Mr Oswald&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Better hold your tongue, Magee," said Oswald, whose lips from
old habit seemed to find a pleasure in uttering that word "Magee"
on every occasion. "I suppose you are more or less drunk again. I
smell, it on you. Haven't I many times forbidden you to carouse in
my rooms with your friends, and drink my spirits?"</p>

<p>"Sure, sir, I know that that much is all right between us,"
answered Magee. "What can you expect? when the cat's away, 'tis but
natural if the mice take a few liberties with his tail, sir."</p>

<p>"With his cocktail, you mean. Better hold your tongue, Magee.
What, by the way, is all the news? Is anything going on?"</p>

<p>"Nothing special, sir. You must 'er heard sir, of the bankruptcy
of Sir Aubrey Payne; then again, on Tuesday evening last Lord Cyril
Letchford struck her ladyship a back-handed blow with the palm of
his hand, as they were going up the great staircase at Rodeleigh
Hall after dinner, and her ladyship is reported to be laid up and
ear-marked for some time to come with a handsome black eye, sir;
then again, Lady Methwold and her aunt, Lady Wisden, left town
yesterday afternoon to spend a week at Marston House, in Norfolk,
with the Farnums&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They, did, did they?" muttered Oswald. "Lady Methwold is a
subject which will have to be considered; Magee, you had better go
to Pagani's and tell them to send a supper."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Supper for breakfast tomorrow, sir?"</p>

<p>"No, for supper to-night. I could eat something now, and drink,
too. I will have a bottle of Yquem. The little economies are over
now, Magee. I happen to have become a rich man since you saw me
last, so you can look out."</p>

<p>"A rich&mdash;? You, sir? Sure, I congratulate you and myself,
too, sir, if that's so?" said, Magee, standing in suspense.</p>

<p>"It's as true as that, that lamp's burning."</p>

<p>"Sure, this is a bit of news, then! How did it happen, sir?"</p>

<p>"You will see, if yon live. Go and get me the supper. First of
all bring me the newspaper that you say contains my brother's
letter."</p>

<p>Magee hurried out, soon returned with the newspaper from his
room in the basement, and hurried out again for the supper; and
while he was gone Oswald eagerly perused Hartwell's letter,
exculpating him from the full scandal of the charge which had been
brought against him. The letter was a short, and formal statement
of facts, in which, however, Hartwell did not spare himself for his
share in the false impression produced as to Oswald's guilt; and,
as he read it, strong emotions of hatred, not untinged with
emotions akin to love, like darkness streaked with fireflies,
boiled in Oswald's breast. He saw that "James" must have felt sorry
for the unbrotherly wrong done, and bitterly he murmured: "Too
late, James! too late!" The fact that "James" had felt sorry for
him stirred up afresh Oswald's self-pity and sense of injury; and
the fact that "James" had not felt sorry in time gave rise to a
tyrannnous longing in Oswald's mind to teach "James" a lesson for
some vague "next time."</p>

<p>"Too late, my friend! I'll teach you for next time," such was
Oswald's thought. He would crush even to the dust; he would not
spare; "James" should be without a five-pound note. But mixed with
all this spleen was the warm, tearful, maudlin feeling that, as
James had felt sorry, so at some distant day he, Oswald, too, would
relent, and be sorry; and he forefelt already the melodramatic joys
with which in that day he would turn again to James, shower royal
mercies upon him, and say: "You are my brother, after all, my own
flesh and blood." Such are the pranks which the feelings play in a
smitten and impoisoned heart.</p>

<p>He went to bed somewhat heated with wine after the supper; but
there was no sleep for him, his brain was so plagued with fiery
thought. After some hours all the food in his stomach was used up
by this work of the soul, and about four in the morning he had to
get up hollow with hunger, and eat a crust of bread, which was all
he had, in spite of his new riches. Thus the greatness of his
happiness, joined with nothing to do, became to, him a care to
groan at.</p>

<p>At sunrise he was up and writing in his dressing-gown to
Hartwell, though it was Sunday, and the letter would not pass
through the post for many hours; he covered three sheets with
writing, pouring out abuse, upbraidings, threats, a river of bile,
though he knew all the time that he would never let such a letter
go from him into the post. He tore it up presently, and afterwards
wrote a short command to Hartwell to meet him at his chambers at
two on Monday afternoon: and this was duly delivered at Corton on
the Monday morning.</p>

<p>As for the Count, he had returned to Addison Road soon after
Oswald left, and spent, for his part, almost as sleepless a night
as Oswald, thinking over that secret thing which he had found out
about "Draytong's" life, thinking, too, of his disappointment in
not meeting Julia, for, on going to her house in Brook Street, to
tell her all, he had heard that she had left London the day before
to stay at Marston House, in Norfolk, an estate only six miles from
Corton; and he was kept awake, too, by the strangeness of the fact,
of which Miss Scatchett had told him, that Oswald had not taken
down to Hartwell the envelope entrusted to him, but was sleeping at
his chambers in London.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>XXIX. &mdash; WHERE WAS
HARTWELL?</h2>

<p class="first">About the same hour that Dulaunay came back to
sleep at Addison Road that Saturday night after failing to find
Julia, a chaise containing Bobbie, Rosie, and Rosie's maid was
passing along the dark road from Felmingham to Corton. It was not
the Corton trap, for that passed them on the road at a slow walk
with Gloucester, the groom, who was going to Felmingham to bring
Oswald and Dulaunay home to Corton, though he was destined to await
them in vain that night. Bobbie's chaise was one of the peculiar
basket-chaises of Felmingham, which he had procured with some
trouble at that late hour, and the journey to Corton was long
drawn, for speed was not exactly the strong point of that
particular horse and driver of Felmingham; the road, moreover, was
not good and very gloomy of a dark night like this. That half-hour
of rain between eight and nine, when Oswald at a bedroom window had
seen the breadth of Addison Road like a plain sprouting with a crop
of white grass, was long since over but the forests here about
Corton still dripped with it through all their depths, the air was
still haunted by a drizzle, and the party in the chaise were in
waterproofs. Even where the sky would have been visible at another
time, neither sky nor star was now to be seen; the eye could not
pierce the darkness two yards ahead; and the silence was broken
only by weird sounds in the woods. The young bride, who was now
wearing loose jackets, clung to her husband's side, and when, they
spoke it was in melancholy murmurs.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he will be asleep, Bobbie," murmured Rosie, "he" being
the word by which Hartwell was now named in all their
talk&mdash;that terrible "he" who had, sooner or later, to be faced
and confessed to: and now the hour for it was come.</p>

<p>"He may be asleep, darling," said Bobbie, "people in the country
do go to sleep early, I know, though I don't feel that he is
asleep. It would be rather a good thing if he were, don't you
think?"</p>

<p>"Do you feel that you would like him to be, darling Bobbie?"
asked Rosie in a subdued voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, for then I should have one more whole night in which to
think out what I am to say to him."</p>

<p>"Haven't you thought it out yet, Bobbie?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I haven't, darling. I have thought, of course, for
months, but not thought out. Nothing possible has occurred to me to
say. The difficulty is to avoid being blatantly ridiculous! 'How do
you do, sir? this is my wife'&mdash;one can't say that, you know:
it is portentous, it really is <i>bete</i>. I do wish now that we
hadn't brought Ernestine with us, Rosie. I tried to hint to you not
to bring her and you would. It looks like springing a whole heavy
family, with hat-boxes and nursemaids upon him, I confess,
I&mdash;I&mdash;feel absurd."</p>

<p>Rosie had a minute's silent reflection, and then said:</p>

<p>"Miss Scatchett thinks&mdash;that&mdash;it! would be better, if
I go in first alone, and see him, while you pretend to be busy
outside with something. I&mdash;will, if you like, Bobbie."</p>

<p>"But do you think you could?" asked Bobbie, sorely tempted to
hide himself behind her bravery: "You might find it trying,
darling."</p>

<p>"But, I 'will,' Bobbie, if you like." she repeated, with a catch
of the breath, clinging to him: for she had never seen Hartwell,
who was to her merely some vague dragon.</p>

<p>"But what would you say, darling? How would you present,
yourself?" asked Bobbie, with a perplexed brow.</p>

<p>"I should say: 'I am Mr Robert Hartwell's lawful wife, and we
are come home,'" said Rosie bravely.</p>

<p>Bobbie could not resist a twinge of laughter at the "lawful," it
sounded so aggressive; and he said:</p>

<p>"No, I don't think that would do, Rosie. It might be the most
diplomatic way, but it would be too great an ordeal for you. No, we
will go in together, I a little in advance&mdash;ah, Heavens! I do
wish the thing was over, don't you? I shall say: 'Allow me to
present you, sir, my&mdash;' If we could only find some equivalent
to 'wife!' it sounds so deplorably heavy!"</p>

<p>"I don't see anything so very wrong with 'wife,'" remarked
Rosie. "But couldn't you say: 'How are you, sir? I am the husband,
sir, of this&mdash;?'"</p>

<p>"Oh, but 'husband' is worse! I'd rather say you are my wife than
say I am your husband: there is something apologetic in 'wife,' but
'husband' sounds like a challenge. Our tone must be calm, but not
self-assertive. I wish to goodness it was over, don't you? I wonder
what he will say! He wouldn't dare be cross with you, I think: if
he is, you won't say anything, but leave it to me to answer
him&mdash;Oh, well, I don't care: we must only trust to
Providence."</p>

<p>"I wish it was over, don't you?" sighed Rosie for the tenth
time. "I only hope he will be well asleep when we get there. Is it
far now?"</p>

<p>"It can't be very far now, I think," answered Bobbie: "I have
only been down here once and he told me then that he was going to
live in a place buried in timber which they call the Pavilion. So
that must be where he is. If he is asleep, we can probably get in
without his knowing till to-morrow: the servant who opens to us is
sure to know me."</p>

<p>"But perhaps the servants are asleep, too," suggested Rosie: "in
knocking them up, we may wake 'him.'"</p>

<p>"Heaven knows. I don't care, dear. We must only sit tight, and
trust to Providence."</p>

<p>"You see what a heap of trouble I have brought you into, Bobbie.
He must have had some deep reason for wishing you to marry the
other Rosie, and he will be terribly angry with us. He may cut you
off with a shilling."</p>

<p>"Let him do his worst. 'I' had a deep reason for wishing to
marry this Rosie, and no other, that's all. I only wish the
dreadful business was over. It can't be very far now."</p>

<p>"I am sorry now that I brought Ernestine, or wore this hat,"
said Rosie, after a silence: "he will think that I am fond of
dress, and can't move without a maid. But I didn't wish to leave
poor Ernestine by her self at Addison Road, where no one speaks
French. Oh, dear darling Bobbie, we must be getting very near now!
Just give me your hand&mdash;feel my heart, how it is beating. I
wish an accident would happen to the chaise to keep us back."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, dear, you make me nervous," said Bobbie.</p>

<p>"How cold your hand is!" murmured Rosie: "I can feel, it through
my glove; keep it here under the jacket to warm it. Don't be too
nervous, darling! perhaps it will be all right&mdash;Oh, dear! we
were too young to get married&mdash;What would dear Lulu and Paul
Schrapps and all those Paris people think to see us quaking in this
way to come home? That old Spanish fortune teller in the Rue de
Moscou told me that a calamity was hanging over us, Bobbie, and
that is why I kept you from coming; I am sure that my influence
helped to keep you from coming, but I am terribly sorry now, dear,
I ought, to have made you come long ago, and then it would have
been over now, and we should not have had to suffer to-night!"</p>

<p>"It will be all right; don't be afraid; we can't be far now,"
said Bobbie in a tone of nervous preoccupation. All their remarks
were disjointed and abrupt.</p>

<p>"His brother, Oswald, and Count Dulaunay may be up and with
him," remarked Rosie, "and they will be a protection perhaps. He
would hardly be very cross before them. I don't think I shall like
Oswald much from what you tell me, he is too short; but I shall
like the Count. Is it far now, I wonder? I wonder if Mr Dray ton
will notice me, or like me?"</p>

<p>"He notices every earthly thing the moment his eye rests on it,"
answered Bobbie: "he'll probably know how long we have been
married, where we have lived, and all about us in a wonderful way
by his first glance. That would be quite in his manner. He is a man
of science, trained in what they call 'expert
observation&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Oh, he must be very terrible, dear darling Bobbie!" murmured
Rosie.</p>

<p>"But he is not&mdash;don't think that," said Bobbie, patting her
hand absent-mindedly "you mustn't be afraid of him, darling. He is
only cold in manner. Remember all that he has done for me: I was a
poor working boy, as I have told you, and he&mdash;"</p>

<p>The chaise began to bump down the steep forest road that passes
by the little lawn where the statue of Pan is, before the Pavilion.
They were at Corton; and suddenly their hearts got colder as the
chaise stopped, and at some moment they saw a single light in the
Pavilion near by on their right.</p>

<p>Bobbie said something to Ernestine in French in a hushed voice,
she seized a valise and a hat-box, and the party got out; the
driver was then dismissed and, turning on the narrow road with
difficulty, rumbled very slowly away into dense darkness. The night
was indeed very dark, and the forest seemed to hide within itself
some unspeakable secret; from the Pavillon sounded the baying of a
dog.</p>

<p>The young husband put his arm round his wife's waist, and held
her to him, as if to protect her from the spirit of awe which was
in their situation and in the greatness of the gloom about
them.</p>

<p>They walked by the statue of Pan across the lawn to the
Pavilion. The single light came from the drawing room on the ground
floor, the old room used for the whist parties and for living in;
but it was so dark in the portico which surrounded the house, that
Bobbie stumbled over a cane chair there. The dog now bayed close
and angrily within one of the doors opening upon the portico, and
at this door Bobbie knocked with his umbrella; but he had to knock
thrice before a girl came rubbing her eyes&mdash;Sarah Gissing, who
had been sitting asleep in the drawing-room. She did not know
Bobbie, and stared at the visitors; as though they were part of her
late dream.</p>

<p>"Is Mr Drayton still awake?" Bobbie asked in a low confidential
tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir,"&mdash;Bobbie's and the poor Rosie's hearts
sank&mdash;"at least he has not gone to bed."</p>

<p>"Is he&mdash;there?" asked Bobbie in a low voice, indicating the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>"He isn't, sir. We dunnot know where Mr Drayton is, nor Mrs
neither. They must have gone out after dinner somewhere; but they
didn't say they were going, nor where they were going to. And I'm
sitting up, now, waiting for them."</p>

<p>Bobbie's and Rosie's hearts rose again: the ordeal was put by at
least some moments.</p>

<p>"But Mr Drayton's not married," said Bobbie: "you speak of Mrs
Drayton."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Mr Drayton is married."</p>

<p>"To whom?"</p>

<p>"To Mrs, sir."</p>

<p>"I see. But where would, he be? can't you guess?"</p>

<p>"I can't, sir," said Sarah. "There's nowhere for them to have
gone to. Gloucester&mdash;that's the groom, sir&mdash;has been
searching about the woods for them, but he couldn't find them; and
I'm sure there's nowhere for them to have gone to."</p>

<p>"How do you mean? they must be somewhere, you know. They haven't
gone in a carriage apparently, but mightn't they have gone on foot
to pay a visit somewhere?"</p>

<p>"No; sir, they never pay any visits."</p>

<p>"And Mr Oswald and the Count, are they up?"</p>

<p>"They went to London to-day, sir. Gloucester is gone to fetch
them, and they'll be here after eleven."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't' seem to know you, but I am Mr Drayton's ward,
and this is my lady, and her maid. We are going to stay here, so
you will prepare us two rooms, and meantime we shall sit up till Mr
Drayton comes home."</p>

<p>The party of travellers had now entered the drawing room;
Ernestine was sent up with Sarah to see to the rooms; Bobbie and
Rosie sat in their ulsters, and waited, with silent glances at each
other. It was half-past ten; it became eleven; and still Hartwell
and Martha did not appear. Bobbie poured some wine from a decanter,
with a gold ring marked "sherry" round its neck, and made Rosie
take it, with a biscuit from the whist table. Then Sarah and
Ernestine reappeared from above stairs, sat at a respectful
distance, and all waited as silently as a party at a wake. Rosie
sat with relaxed bent shoulders, and occasionally glanced at Bobbie
with a glance which said nothing but the obvious fact: "Well,
Bobbin, here we are, then, waiting. Destiny has brought us to this
point, so far and no farther;" and Bobbie's eyes rested on her with
a glance which said precisely the same obvious thing. Their sense
of relief at Hartwell's absence gradually ceased to be acute, and
even as they sat indolently enjoying that absence, they began
almost to wish that he would come; and the candles in the
candelabra burned lower.</p>

<p>"I suppose he is quite certain to come some time to-night,"
called Bobbie to Sarah.</p>

<p>"Oh, certain, sir," answered the good Sarah, who had very little
reasoning power, and, besides, was dying with sleep.</p>

<p>Ernestine, too, seemed very sleepy, and so did Rosie. At
half-past eleven Bobbie sent the two servants to bed, saying he
would sit up, and he wished to send Rosie also, but she would not
go; before midnight, however, she had thrown off the splendid hat,
and was asleep on his lap with her head on his shoulder, while
Bobbie watched alone.</p>

<p>A minute before midnight Dulaunay's retriever, Mascotte, which
had been asleep in the fireplace, again began to make a noise, and
soon a man's head peeped in at one of the windows&mdash;it was
Gloucester's, who had just returned from his useless drive to
Felmingham to bring home Oswald and Dulaunay. Instead of Sarah,
whom he expected to see in the lighted drawing room, he saw a young
gentleman with his lips laid on the forehead of a girl asleep on
his lap. Gloucester knew Bobbie, however, and called out: "Beg
pardon, sir, is Mr and Mrs Drayton come home yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, Gloucester," answered Bobbie, wondering who on earth
"Mrs" Drayton could be, since he knew that it was not Julia.</p>

<p>"It seems funny, sir," said Gloucester: "you not long come, I
suppose, sir?"</p>

<p>"I came by the 9.50."</p>

<p>"Everybody gone to bed, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I sent off the girl. What, then, can have become of Mr
Drayton?"</p>

<p>"There's no telling, sir. I was wondering, sir; whether anything
couldn't be done?"</p>

<p>"In what way do you mean? I suppose, Gloucester, that he has
gone to London or somewhere?"</p>

<p>"He'd hardly walk to Felmingham, sir. Mrs Drayton she couldn't
half walk it, I know, if she tried."</p>

<p>"Then where is he?"</p>

<p>"No telling, sir," said Gloucester, scratching his head.</p>

<p>"What about Mr Oswald and the Count&mdash;not turned up?" asked
Bobbie.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I went to fetch them, but they haven't come&mdash;I
feel a bit queer about Mr and Mrs Drayton, sir."</p>

<p>"But why so? there are no wolves to eat him, or precipices for
him to fall over. He must be somewhere, Gloucester."</p>

<p>"Can't think where they could have got to, sir&mdash;But no
doubt it's all right&mdash;Well, good night to you, sir."</p>

<p>"Good night."</p>

<p>Gloucester departed to the stables; put up his horses, and
sought, his bed with a head nodding toward sleep. And ten minutes
after him, Bobbie, too, gave up, took a candle, and, following the
directions which Sarah had left him, found his room, and was soon
floating in cloudland in the affectionate arms of a being who was
half Rosie and half Morpheus.</p>

<p>Where, then, meantime, were Hartwell and Martha?</p>

<p>After dinner that evening, at which he, Martha, and Barnes had
sat alone, Hartwell had gone up to his study to write a business
letter to Birmingham about the trial of his electrical machine,
which was to take place on the Tuesday following; he had left
Martha with Barnes in the drawing-room; she was then reading a
novelette at the dying fire&mdash;dying, for the night was very
warm for November, though inclement; but when Hartwell had come
down again near eight, Martha was no longer there: he had
questioned Barnes, and Barnes with his left hand had pointed dumbly
out ward, to show that Martha had gone for a stroll. Hartwell then
went into the portico and paced about, glancing anxiously anon at
the clouds, or peering down the path in the forest. Sarah Gissing
came presently and took Barnes, and Hartwell saw her lead him
slowly across the lawn to the edge of the forest on the left, where
the path commences to mount steeply toward the ruin and the chalk
cottages. Ten minutes passed after this, and still Martha did not
appear. Then suddenly that rain which in London, too, Oswald had
seen from Hartwell's bedroom window, came pelting, whereupon
Hartwell ran in, seized his hat and an umbrella, and ran down the
forest path to the right to find and cover Martha.</p>

<p>But he could see no sign of her in any direction.</p>

<p>One of her favorite spots for sitting and reading was the well
in a glade of the pines, and to this glade he went. It was a very
solitary spot, though only a ten minutes' walk from the Pavilion
stables, and here could be heard the many sounds which went on in
the pines, and the music that was made in there always, as it were
great choral happenings taking place far away in Heaven, the shout
of numbers without number, strange rumours of which seemed to be
brought on the breezes to the ear of the listener; one of the
pines, in fact, was so close to the well that Martha, sitting on
the coping, would often hear queer rumbling noises going on within
its trunk when the breezes swayed its tall top. The well had long
fallen into disuse, and was almost hidden by the grasses, nettles,
and coarse fern, which nested in it. On the side where the half lid
was, the ground was quite a swamp, but on the other side two slabs
in the mud made the approach dry. Hartwell had not liked Martha to
be there, for a mist arose from the depths of the well, and he had
even thought of filling it in, but had hesitated to do so, since
she seemed to like it.</p>

<p>When he now entered the little glade, which was called the Round
Point, Martha was not to be seen. He called to her in the pouring
rain, but received no answer. The night was getting very dark. He
ran from the glade in another direction.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>XXX. &mdash; IN THE WELL</h2>

<p class="first">Hartwell searched for an hour, till near nine, but
could not find Martha. He thought that she might have gone, not
down, but up hill, and up there might have taken shelter from the
rain in the Gissings' cottage or in Steve Anderson's; but she had
not been in either of them. He returned to the Pavilion with a
flash in the eye. The rain had now almost ceased. He went into the
drawing room; she had not come home. He stood in the middle of the
room, thinking it out; and there an intuition of the truth for the
first time flashed across his mind.</p>

<p>Martha's vitality, as has been said, did not amount to much: she
often fell asleep, or fainted, at hardly a moment's notice; and
Hartwell now thought that she might have sat to read on the well
alone, there fallen asleep or fainted, lost her balance, and
tumbled into the well.</p>

<p>He was not a man who easily lost command of himself, but this
thought turned him white, and his lip trembled. The instant feeling
in him was the ugly one that she might be dead, and that it was not
he who had killed her.</p>

<p>He was agitated inwardly; but his actions were cool enough! He
felt in his jacket-pocket, and found that a box of matches was
there; he then walked into the next room across the passage,
searched in a drawer, and found a ball of twine. He then came back
to the drawing room, took a candle, puffed out its light, and now
hastened out with these things through the drizzle toward the Round
Point.</p>

<p>As he made his way thither in the now confirmed darkness, some
sinister thoughts, or feelings rather than thoughts, like unclean
snakes lifting their heads, occurred in his mind. If he did not let
them speak aloud, they at least whispered and hissed in his
consciousness. Human nature has not yet rid itself of the traits of
its brutal ancestry, and is often not pretty, in spite of one's
long effort to live well; Hartwell was surprised and shaken by the
suddenness of this thing, and what he felt was that, if she were
dead, then he was free; that, if she were dead, he had not killed
her with his own hand, and yet he was free.</p>

<p>He felt that Julia's engagement with the young Archduke was of
no importance; that in the face of his freedom, of his
resurrection, all that would vanish out of existence like a
mist.</p>

<p>He did not know that at this very hour of 9.15 the shreds of
Letty Barnes' letter wore already in Oswald's hands in London, and
that he, Hartwell, stood that moment in peril of losing all, or of
being hanged. He made towards the Round Point, and his pace
quickened to a run.</p>

<p>Stopping over the two slabs in the mud, he stood by the well,
and gazed into its depths; and as he gazed, stooping over the
brickwork coping, the gold pin that was in his tie, shaken loose
perhaps by his run, fell out, and, down there below made a faint
splash and echo. He called down once the word "Martha," but the
well called back only the echo of his own voice.</p>

<p>He straightened himself, and tying the candle tight with the
twine at a point somewhat nearer to the wick than to the bottom
end, lit it under his hat, for it was drizzling; and he proceeded
to lower it carefully into the well, peering over. The candle, as
it went down, lay obliquely between upright and horizontal, but the
flame turned upright, and was scorching the string, seeing which,
Hartwell quickened the rate of paying out. In the impure air down
there the light burned feebly, but still it lived, and was a yard
or so from the surface of the water when the scorched string
parted, the candle splashed, and all was blackness down there
again. But for one moment Hartwell had seen something white&mdash;a
guess of the eyres, a mere glimpse of something; and this convinced
him that Martha was there.</p>

<p>Dead probably&mdash;but also possibly not. The well was hardly
so deep that she would necessarily strike the east side of its wall
in her fall; the water, he knew, was hardly so deep as to prevent
her from being broken to pieces on the bottom. It was possible that
she was not dead; she certainly soon would be&mdash;if he
waited&mdash;thinking about it&mdash;wilfully wasting time: and
from his bosom there came a growl of disgusted self-conviction
which uttered the words: "Robert Hartwell!"</p>

<p>He now ran fast enough&mdash;up a rising path in the pines, over
a ditch and a stile, down a stony way, to the stables; and as he
entered the quadrangle he called out sharply, angrily, with
flashing eyes, "Gloucester!"</p>

<p>Gloucester, however, did not happen to be there; he had been
smoking in the kitchen at the Pavilion since dinner, and at this
very time was out with a lantern and umbrellas, searching for the
master and mistress, Sarah Gissing having just before discovered
their absence.</p>

<p>Hartwell called him several times, and, not receiving any reply,
understood that whatever was to be done must be done by himself
alone; only one man, Gloucester, was on the place, beside Steve
Anderson, Gissing, and Barnes, who were far enough away. Oswald and
Dulaunay were in London; and Hartwell, not sure whether Gloucester
was at the Pavilion, would not spend the four minutes necessary to
run there, but, plunging into one of the stables, came out with a
coil of small new rope on his arm, and then started back again,
through the pines with running feet, which trod on a carpet made of
tiny stems, the dry stems of the pine-leaf; and as he ran he cast
away his jacket, and then his waistcoat, first placing the matches
in his bosom. His plan of action was already formed in his own
mind. He intended to let down over the axle of the old windlass a
length of the rope sufficiently long for the two ends to be within
his reach when he stood at the bottom of the well. He would then
fasten one of the two hanging ends under Martha's arms, and hauling
at the other part of the rope would thus hoist her to the windlass.
For his own descent into the well, he would cut off a length of the
rope&mdash;he had a penknife in his trouser pocket&mdash;and tie
one end round the axle. When he was down, and had Martha hoisted to
the axle, he would go up again by his own rope, grasping not only
it but Martha's rope as well, so that she should not slip down
again meantime. This would be almost equivalent to taking his own
weight plus Martha's up a swinging rope. But, he was still very
strong, though not what he had been, and, she being very light, he
was confident that he would manage it somehow, even if she slipped
back down a little as he climbed up. He might even possibly find a
projecting stone or something at the bottom, to which to fasten the
rope after she was hoisted, while he climbed by his own rope.</p>

<p>Coming therefore to the well, he set hurriedly to work. His
first care was to ascertain the depth, and this he did by tying a
stone in an end of the rope, lowering it, listening for the splash,
and marking the depth by a knot in the rope. He then proceeded to
cut off from the rope a length equivalent to double the well's
depth; but, having done this, he found that only about two yards of
the rope was left for his own descent. He had not thought of this
possibility of the rope running short; and he was eager now to have
the poor Martha safe in his arms.</p>

<p>For a moment or two, he did not know what to do: to run back to
the stables or to the Pavilion was to lose another fifteen minutes;
he soon remembered, however, the old rope attached to the wheel and
axle, reached out and felt it; a chain and hook hung at its end;
and there it had lain coiled round the axle under its tin hood for
many years. Hartwell had a doubt whether it would bear his weight.
It was so rotten and frayed, though quite three times stouter than
the rope from the stables. He set to turning the wheel, letting the
old rope move down through his outstretched left hand. It was
certainly thin at some points&mdash;he could not see, but he could
feel. That, however, was the only alternative to going back to the
stables, and he was afraid to go back lest, on the way, he should
feel glad at the delay. He decided to run the dreadful risk: and in
the depths of the soul, something darkly whispered him that, if
instead of killing Martha, as he had once thought of doing, he
should happen to die for her, then somehow that would not be a bad
thing for the stars above the glade to see, or for that music in
the pines to make a theme of.</p>

<p>Sitting on the brickwork he quickly had off boots, trousers,
shirt, threw the new rope over the axle with its two ends let down
to the bottom, and, as gently as he could, he hung his weight on
the old rope. He was very brawny, and in his working man days in
the Birmingham factory, had often tackled weights and tasks that
others had shied at. His descent into the darkness was attended,
therefore, with little trouble, save a growing unease in breathing
the stagnant air down there, and his feet safely touched the water
and the bottom slime.</p>

<p>Now, at the actual experience of that place, he no longer
believed that Martha could be alive, its mood was so chilling to
the lamp of life like caverns of the deep sea and the raw breath of
mermaids; an impression of awe touched Hartwell; his lips
pronounced in a low tone the name of Martha.</p>

<p>There was a slow dripping sound in the darkness. He did not know
whence it came; but it was water dripping from Martha's hat, and
from one end of the new rope.</p>

<p>He had the matches under his vest, and after some efforts got
one of them alight; it burned quite feebly, but he saw her; and at
once, seeing her, he realised afresh that she might be alive. She
seemed to be on both knees, with her back against the wall, her
head and neck above the surface of the water, her eyes closed, her
mouth open, her hat still on her head. He concluded that, after
falling, she must have been more or less conscious of drowning, and
in her struggles must have instinctively taken that position at the
moment of fainting; whether the water had protected her limbs from
fracture on the well's bottom, he could not tell; the expression of
her face was like death, but he saw no blood, and life was at least
possible. As the match went out, something half-floating touched
his left thigh. It was her handkerchief.</p>

<p>He lost not a moment now, but, putting back the matches under
his vest, where he also had his penknife in case of need, he made a
loop at one end of her rope with a knot that would not run. As he
now moved to take her into his arms, his foot struck upon
something, and slipped: It was a wooden pail or bucket,
water-logged and sunken to the bottom, there long years before. He
recovered his footing and standing over Martha, soon had her in his
left arm with a sense of surprise at her lightness, which the
pressure of the water caused to seem still greater than it was in
reality. Without stopping to ascertain if she were dead or alive,
he pressed her to his heart, for dearly Hartwell loved her, now
that he was there to save her, dearly "as a father pitieth his
children," and as he passed the loop under her arms, with her back
toward the length of the rope, his lips found and pressed her cold
cheek in a kiss more blessed than any which he had ever given to
Julia; more blessed and more blessing, for it is scientific to say,
that magnetic virtues streaming from so pure and fervent a kiss may
have given to Martha a fresh lease of life.</p>

<p>The loop having been well adjusted, under her arms, Hartwell
proceeded to hoist her up by pulling downwards at the other part of
her rope. The axle was smooth and the rope came easily, but his
difficulty was to keep on his legs; the ground was so slippy.
Several times there were jerks and narrow escapes from falling, and
when she was gone some yards up, as he was moving backward, to prop
himself against the wall, a nail standing in the mosses, on the
bottom, ran far into his left heel, causing him such pain that he
had to hold her weight with one trembling arm, while with the other
hand he slowly drew out the nail, which he put inside his vest. He
then continued to haul her up, and soon could dimly see her form as
she rose higher and still higher in to the less dense darkness, up
there above, while the well resounded with echoes at the continued
rain that dribbled down from her clothes and body into the water,
resounded too with echoes at the labor of Hartwell's breath; with
echoes even of the movement of the rope on the axle; he started
with something like a fright at the dropping of one of her shoes
when she was nearly up, it came with such a sudden hum, and then a
splash, and long reverberation; at last he felt the check up there
above and saw that she had reached the axle.</p>

<p>He now moved round the wall this way and that, the rope grasped
with the double turn round the right hand, feeling with the left to
see if he could find any projection such as are seen in some wells,
suitable for him to make the rope fast to; but he found none, and
lost little time in searching. He next groped with the left arm,
till he found the old bucket, against which he had stumbled; it had
an iron handle, and lifting it by this, but holding it still under
the water, so that its weight remained almost nil, Hartwell
contrived with his left hand to tie the rope to its handle; he then
let Martha down two or three feet, whereupon the bucket rose full
of water, above the surface, its weight now acting as a
considerable counterpoise to Martha's weight, for it was of large
size; so that Hartwell could now climb up his own rope with less
difficulty in holding Martha from slipping back down.</p>

<p>Grasping now his own old rope and Martha's new rope also in both
hands, he put his foot in the hook at the end of the old rope, and
began to climb&mdash;with a renewed misgiving in him as to whether
his rope would bear him, though he now thought of this with a less
chilly sense of peril than before, for use gives confidence. Up
then, he went, hand over hand, each clutch of the hand grasping not
one rope, but two&mdash;a -much more earnest business than his
coming down, more jerky, more swayed, more doubtful as to its
issue. The well was now full of sounds, hoots, omens; the bucket
was slipping up and up, foot by foot, drawn up by Martha's weight
in spite of his grinning effort to keep Martha steady, and he could
hear the water in the bucket wash over its rim, as it swung to this
side or to that anon, to splash in a mass into the water of the
well, these sounds interrupting the steady watery sound of the wet
which dribbled profusely down from his own clothes, and from
Martha's; he could hear, also, the echoes of his own respiration,
the echoes of his palms clapping in turn upon the ropes; the well
seemed to listen to everything, to mock everything, and to be a
gnome enjoying itself with banter at Hartwell's vain struggle to
escape and reach that remote top; terribly remote it more and more
seemed to him&mdash;a goal for a Hercules to reach, and then drop
dead at. When he had got to the middle of the height, it looked no
nearer than before; Martha had then slipped down several yards, and
a sort of rage to reach the goal akin to madness by this time
possessed Hartwell's whole being. With a wild face, with jerks and
gasps, and staring eyes, and a gaping mouth, he struggled on.</p>

<p>But a little beyond the half-way point, the old rope parted at a
thin place, and cut his labours short.</p>

<p>What now followed happened perhaps in two seconds, though it
cannot be so rapidly described. Hartwell felt that his rope was
gone&mdash;the instant splash into the water of the lower part was
reported by a shout of the well&mdash;yet he felt that he was not
all unsupported in empty space, though he was descending, for he
was clutching still to Martha's rope with one hand, and her weight
was counterbalancing his; if he had continued to hold on, slipping
meanwhile down Martha's rope, he could have reached the bottom with
perfect ease and safety; but he was instantly conscious&mdash;as
his own rope snapped&mdash;that if he clung on to Martha's rope,
his weight, and the weight of the bucket, would in some seconds
drag her back up the axle, from which she had slipped down a few
yards, and there crush in her chest, or break her back. At this
half a thought in that wild moment, his fingers relaxed from her
rope&mdash;and with a loud shout he fell back ward.</p>

<p>And at once up there above, at the axle, would have been
audible, but for the watery uproar of Hartwell's splash, a humming
which grew in vehemence: it was Martha coming down, and the haste
of her rope running over the axle made the humming. But though she
fell from the top, and Hartwell only from half-way, her fall was
much less terrible than his: for she was counterbalanced by the
weight of the bucket of water which, as she came down, moved up
with increasing speed. The bucket was tied near the middle point of
the rope's length, and happily she reached the water half a second
before the bucket reached the axle&mdash;happily, for if the water
had not broken the impetus of her fall, before the bucket struck
the axle, the shock of the sudden stoppage of the bucket at the
axle must have killed her; and as the water protected her, from the
shock of the bucket's stoppage, so the bucket as well as the water
protected her from the shock against the bottom of the well. For
though the bucket's handle was torn away from it by its impact upon
the axle, yet that temporary check must have lessened the force of
Martha's impact upon the bottom; however it was, she received
little or no injury from that second fall.</p>

<p>And she had no sooner struck the bottom than she was up again,
for Hartwell lifted her. He was still under the water, momentarily
stunned, when she had come; she had come more or less upon him, and
as he rose with a dislocated left shoulder, he brought her with him
on his breast, uttering a bubbling sound of calamity and pain, as
his head emerged from the drench.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, but tottered, slipped, floundered, and then
knelt with her against the wall, a long time, gasping, his eyes
closed, his face leant against the mosses and weeds, which all down
there covered the wall of the well.</p>

<p>While he knelt there, the facts of his situation passed dismally
and wearily through his mind; there were only two hopes: that the
bucket had been stopped at the axle, in which case, since the
bucket was at about the middle point of the rope's length, both
ends of the rope would still be at the bottom of the well; he could
thus draw Martha up again into the pure air, and find or invent
some means of making fast the end of her rope below while he slept;
for he knew that he must soon sleep, and then slowly die of the
narcotic poison contained in the air which he was breathing; it was
true that the candle and match had burned in it, and that where a
candle burns a man may breathe; but where the candle burns very
dimly it is certain that the man will not breathe very long. He
felt already that he would have sooner or later to give in and
sleep, as Martha slept, and his hope or finding the other end of
the rope was his only hope for her; for himself, he had no hope,
except a rather faint one, that they might be discovered and
rescued in time, either by Gloucester now, or by Dulaunay and
Oswald later on when they returned from London. He had little hope
that the women servants would have the instinct to make an
organised search because of the temporary absence of himself and
Martha; and as to Gloucester, he was a rather slow minded fellow.
Hartwell's hope in this direction, then must rest on the return of
Oswald and Dulaunay; they would hear from a servant of his absence;
might then very possibly come to the round point and would at once
see his clothes by the well. They would be at Corton by
12&mdash;two hours and a quarter; he believed that he might keep
awake till then.</p>

<p>But, as we know, they did not return to Corton at all that
night: Dulaunay's discovery of Hartwell's secret, and his drive to
Julia to tell her all, had made him miss his train; Oswald had the
shreds of Letty's letter, and instead of coming to Corton wrote a
command to Hartwell to come to him. Instead of Dulaunay and Oswald,
came Bobbie and his charming Rosie, but Bobbie, knowing nothing of
the habits of life at Corton, of its seclusion and uneventfulness,
did not see that the absence of Hartwell and Martha at that late
hour necessarily meant danger; he supposed that they were paying
some vague visit, and were "somewhere," while Sarah Gissing, on the
contrary, was of opinion that they could not possibly be
anywhere.</p>

<p>At the moment when Martha dropped back to the bottom of the
well, at about fifteen minutes to ten, Gloucester had actually been
seeking the missing pair with umbrellas, but had not come to the
round point, where he could not suppose them to be, since he knew
that in the round point there was no shelter from the rain which
was falling; he had now returned to the Pavilion, had left the
umbrellas there, had hurried to the stables to harness the horse,
and without discovering the removal, by Hartwell, of the coil of
rope from the stables, was off to Felmingham to bring home Oswald
and Dulaunay.</p>

<p>Whatever hopes, therefore, Hartwell had in Gloucester, or in
Oswald, and the Count, were not to be realised; his hope, also, of
hoisting Martha up again into the fresh air came to nothing: for,
when he painfully lifted himself from his knees, and groped for the
rope end knot attached to Martha, he could not find it, since, in
fact, it was yards above his reach, Martha having dragged
considerably more than half the rope's length over the axle with
her; nor did Hartwell need to grope long to guess how things were,
for his foot again struck on the bucket, which now again lay at the
bottom of the well, and he understood that, since it was there, its
handle must have been wrenched off at its impact on the axle, and
the rope must then have run well beyond its middle point on the
axle after Martha, taking the handle with it on one side of the
axle, while the bucket fell down on the other side.</p>

<p>He thought, however, that there was still a possibility that the
missing rope end might be within his reach, and with Martha at his
bosom in his right arm, he moved blindly about, forging through the
water which reached to his middle, feeling for the rope end with
moans and groans. He did not yet know that, even if he found the
missing rope end, he would be unable to draw up Martha a single
yard, since his left arm hung useless at his side; but there was
nothing else for him to do, except to seek and seek the rope with
hopeless obstinacy throughout the small circle of his dungeon. He
made no attempt to strike any of the marches under his vest, for he
knew that they were soaked, and the permanence of the darkness of
that place, where no ray came, soon had an inner darkening effect
upon his mind also, quenching the mind's power to hope, or to
picture to itself any reality save the well, and the water and
slime in it, and the dark sounds that had their old home in it
remote from light and the human world. The task of bearing Martha
on his bosom, and searching in the dark for the rope end, seemed to
have been born with him, while Gloucester, Oswald, Dulaunay, became
to his mind like people known an age ago in another state of being,
and the possibility that they might come to rescue him and that
burden which he bore like a doom on his breast seemed more and more
visionary to him. The semi-circle of only half-darkness above,
between the lid and the coping, ceased as the hours passed, to
speak to him of nearness with the upper world and the one star
visible in it to him not visible that dark night to people above,
finally seemed as more remote from his hopes and his powers than
the Pavilion, or Gloucester, or the coming of any human aid. He
could do nothing but grope, and groan and stare upward. A tight
feeling, as if his chest was tied up, oppressed him; at one time,
for about half an hour, he became conscious of great agony in his
left arm; but this gradually passed off as the narcotism of the
carbonic gases worked upon his senses. He became very heavy, more
and more disposed to give up and die.</p>

<p>But he endured till some time after Dulaunay and Oswald should
have come, till some time after Bobbie and Rosie and Gloucester
went nodding to their beds about midnight; and then he could
sustain his own weight and Martha's no longer; he mumbled
something, and abandoned himself to the charm of what was wooing
him.</p>

<p>In a sullen way, to save himself and her from death from
drowning (though he did not know at all if she were dead or alive),
he pulled down the rope from the axle, and placed the bucket with
its bottom upward against the wall; he then sat on the bucket, his
back to the wall, his head and part of his chest above the water;
and placing Martha between his legs with her feet on the well's
bottom he tied her to his body round and round with many whorls of
the rope, her face to the wall, and a considerable part of her body
above the water; so that, so long as he did not fall off the bucket
during sleep, she could not fall either, but if one drowned, both
would drown. And this done, Hartwell leant his head on the mosses
of the wall, and the well echoed his last waking sigh.</p>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>XXXI. &mdash; THE SEARCH</h2>

<p class="first">The next morning at an early hour there was
discussion in the servants' room at the Pavilion, between the women
servants, when Sarah announced that the master and mistress had not
come home; and at first the discussion was marked by mere surprise,
at a casual event, till the most original of the three uttered a
word of misgiving, whereupon it was not long but that misgiving
proved catching like fire or fever, a fear that had been asleep in
them all woke up, and finally they were telling to one another
their certainty that something was wrong: which proves that truth
is rank, and a gram of it once cast forth will grow.</p>

<p>"I'd better go and see if Gloucester has anything to say about
it," suggested Sarah.</p>

<p>Gloucester was sweet on Sarah, so that her errand to the stables
would combine something of coquetry with business; her mood at the
moment was grave enough, but the heart is deceitful, and subtly
mixed its own undercurrents in her motives. At once Sarah started
off with her rather silly scare of flurry, calling back over her
shoulder: "You had better take up the hot water to the young
gentleman and lady, Ethel, and try to wake up that lazy French girl
again." She ran to the kitchen door, where she met the milkman with
his hand raised to ring, dropped to him the news that the master
and mistress were missing, and ran up an alley in the pines toward
the stables.</p>

<p>It was a bright Sunday morning, after the rainy night,
everything, including the air itself, looking washed and fresh, and
the smell in the pines full of health and liveliness; but Sarah's
anticipated pleasure in rousing Gloucester to give him startling
news and saucy smiles was dashed by the appearance of Gloucester
himself in the alley bearing a sack of fir cones for the kitchen
fires.</p>

<p>"Master and mistress got home?" he asked at once, before Sarah
could speak.</p>

<p>"That's just what I was coming to you about," she replied: "you
ought to have searched for them when you got back from the station
last night, for something dreadful has happened."</p>

<p>The consensus of opinion in the servants' room that something
dreadful had happened was the same thing to her simple mind as a
proof that it had happened.</p>

<p>"What's happened?" asked Gloucester, startled.</p>

<p>"Something dreadful," she repeated, with certainty.</p>

<p>"That's only what you think," said Gloucester; "I had a talk
with young Mr Hartwell, who was in the drawing-room when I got back
from the station last night, and we both agreed that there wasn't
anything that could 'er happened"&mdash;and the mere agreement
between Bobbie and himself was as good proof to Gloucester of the
one view as the agreement in the servants' room was proof to Sarah
of the opposite view.</p>

<p>"Girls always know too much,"' remarked Gloucester.</p>

<p>"As much as the men, I dare say," said Sarah.</p>

<p>"Yes, they think so," retorted Gloucester.</p>

<p>"You must have had your head full of them last night, I should
think, or you would 'er done something," said Sarah.</p>

<p>"Well I don't know," replied Gloucester; "I might 'er had my
head full of them. I looked up to your window to see if I could see
any light&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I didn't come here to hear any sauce," said Sarah, not quite
truly. "Something must be done at once."</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do, then. Nothing that I know of couldn't
'er happened to them, not at Corton."</p>

<p>"But it stands to reason they must be somewhere, Gloucester,"
protested Sarah, though she had previously laid it down as a dogma
that they could not be anywhere; "and they haven't gone off the
estate, or master would have had the carriage, Ethel says, so they
wouldn't be far, and ought to be looked for."</p>

<p>Gloucester walked by her side with a puzzled brow; to seek them
on the estate, two grown up people, where there were no wild
beasts, except poachers, seemed to him childish; he could imagine
nothing, save the possibility that for some queer reason they had
slept at the Gissings' or at Anderson's cottage; but, as he and
Sarah came in sight of the back of the Pavilion, they saw old
Gissing, to whom, at that early hour, the day was already old, for
he was always up and abroad with the lark; he was now trudging
towards the kitchen, in his Sunday waistcoat, but without any
jacket, for a good morrow to his daughter and the others, when
Gloucester and Sarah came upon him, and told their tale of the
missing two.</p>

<p>The old man thought it over deliberately, with his wrinkled, lax
brow bent toward the ground, and the first thing that came into his
head was the possibility that Oswald had done some evil to his
brother.</p>

<p>"What does Mr Oswald and the French Count say about it," he
asked.</p>

<p>"They aren't at home," answered Gloucester, "They went to London
yesterday, and last night when I took the trap for them, they
hadn't come back."</p>

<p>Gissing thought it over again, and said: "Seen Anderson yet this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," was the answer.</p>

<p>"He'd likely be at that broad on the yon side of the ruin,
Gloucester, you run and fetch him, and I'll wait about here till
you come."</p>

<p>Gloucester hurried off, Sarah went into the house to wait on the
young married couple, and Gissing paced up and down the alley with
a look of care on his face till Gloucester returned with the sullen
Anderson striding like a giant in his top-boots. The three men then
held a council on the state of affairs, or rather, two of them, for
Anderson contributed only grunts, and finally Gissing said:</p>

<p>"Anderson 'll search all in them woods to the west of the ruins:
I'll take them grouse and low ground shootings to the north; and
you, Gloucester, will go all through the pines and the coppice
wood, down beyond that frog pond to the shooting range; and we'll
all meet again on the lawn in front."</p>

<p>The three men then separated, and spent three hours of search
without their breakfast, each in his agreed part of the estate.</p>

<p>Bobbie and Rosie, meanwhile, breakfasted gaily in the dining
room, inwardly enjoying the respite granted them by Hartwell's
absence with a childish zest in the present, and a child-like
freedom from the troubles of the future, and of the past. Unused to
the sorrows of life, they had no fear that any calamity had
happened to Hartwell; Rosie occupied most of her morning in going
over the old house, admiring its shabby antiquities, and feeling
the charm of its romantic situation there in the heart of the
forest.</p>

<p>Bobbie was looking out upon the portico near ten, when he saw
Steve Anderson come and take his stand near the statue of Pan on
the lawn, then in some minutes Gloucester, and finally Gissing; he
saw them lay their heads together, and understanding that they had
returned from the search for Hartwell, hurried out to join them,
leaving Rosie in vague misery.</p>

<p>When he came up to the men, he heard Anderson saying, for the
third time:</p>

<p>"I'll swear they aren't anywhere down there."</p>

<p>"No, and they aren't in the pines neither,'" said
Gloucester.</p>

<p>Gissing said nothing; the old man's face was the very expression
of care; and at no time was he a waster of words.</p>

<p>"Searched in the Round Point?" asked Gissing of Gloucester
presently.</p>

<p>"I looked into it," replied Gloucester: "they'd not be there,
you know.'"</p>

<p>Gissing looked hard at him, and after a minute said:</p>

<p>"Wait you here till I come back." He trudged away down the
forest path, and turned into an alley to the right, towards the
Round Point: for an instinct of the truth had been for three hours
ripening in the old fellow's mind, and now had ripened into a
thought.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>XXXII. &mdash; HARTWELL GOES
UNDER</h2>

<p class="first">Bobbie, Gloucester, and Anderson waited Gissing's
return for about fifteen minutes, wondering whither he had gone,
dropping occasional remarks and guesses. The sun was now high and
bright, with few clouds in the sky, and though winter was near
there were still many of the sounds made by birds and wildfowl in
the woods.</p>

<p>Then a running figure was seen in the shadow down the path,
beckoning, while still far off, and it was Gissing. When they
hastened to meet, him, they saw him pale with that touching pallor
of the flesh of an agitated old man. He gave no explanation, but
said hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Gloucester, you run and put the horse in the trap, make paces
for Felmingham, and fetch the doctor; tell him it may be a case o'
drowning; you, Anderson, and the young master, go with Gloucester
to the stables, and bring, between you, to the Round Point, them
two ladders, and all the rope you can find. Look sharp, now, I'll
be at the Round Point when you come."</p>

<p>The other three ran off behind the house, toward the stables,
while Gissing retraced his steps down the path; in the alley to the
right he unswung the door of an old hut, and took it with him; when
Bobbie and Anderson ran down the footpath in the pines to the Round
Point with the ladder and rope ends, they found Gissing bent down
over the coping, with a lost stare into the depths, and on the
coping they saw Hartwell's clothes, which the ferns and grasses had
hidden from Gloucester's running glance earlier in the morning.</p>

<p>The two ladders were lashed together, and lowered into the well;
but they did not reach the bottom; and it was necessary to lower
them with a rope, the other end of which was then made fast to the
nearest, of the pines. Few were the words spoken; Bobbie's face had
lost its roses, and was stamped with a painful distress; anon
Anderson growled to himself; Gissing seemed stricken dumb, and when
he wished anything done, made signs with his hand. Sweat-drops
stood on the old man's white brow, as he stripped off his Sunday
things, put his box of matches between his teeth, stepped over the
well, slid down the rope to the ladder, and thence went down to the
bottom.</p>

<p>He found Hartwell sitting just as he had set himself on the
bucket many hours before, and Martha lashed to him with her face to
the wall; Gissing struck a match, peered at their faces, and cast
up his eyes to heaven. There was some blood in the water.</p>

<p>He quickly found the rope end, unwound the rope from them, and
taking Martha with the rope under her arms to the foot of the
ladder, laid her on it, and, leaving her there, ran up with the
other rope end, which he threw to Anderson from the ladder head,
calling out: "When yon feel me jerk the rope, then pull away."</p>

<p>He then went down again, placed Martha with her back to the
wall, and jerked the rope; Anderson and Bobbie pulled above, and
Martha went up, raining her wet into the well.</p>

<p>Gissing next supported Hartwell in his arms, waited till the
rope came back, and getting the loop under his arms, jerked the
rope. As Hartwell, too, went up, but more slowly than Martha, the
old man accompanied him all the way on the ladder, step by step,
his eyes fixed loweringly on that pathetic figure, once so vigorous
and masterful, but now so helpless, so drenched in disaster, and
apparently in death.</p>

<p>At the top the faces of Hartwell and Martha were seen to be of a
fixed expression, with a bluish tinge in their pallor; there they
lay, Martha on the door in the grass, Hartwell on the coping with
some froth on his white lips, both with the look of the
drowned.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken now, Gissing signed to Anderson and Bobbie
to take up Martha, and to Anderson to help him take Hartwell upon
his own back, though Anderson would have been far better able to
carry all that weight than the old man, and it would have been
better to carry Martha on the back, and Hartwell on the door: but
Gissing arranged it otherwise. They then set off, Gissing bent
under his burden in front, the others bearing Martha on the door
behind. As they drew near the Pavilion, Bobbie wanted desperately
to put down the door a minute, in order to run and get Rosie shut
away from the terrible sight, but he could not venture to do this,
and when they came to the lawn, Rosie, who was looking out,
tearfully for Bobbie, saw the scene of tragedy slowly coming, and
while they were tramping by the corridor stairs, she caught a
glimpse of the two blue faces, and nearly fainted. By this time the
women servants had got a scent of the horror, by seeing Gloucester
dash off in his trap for the doctor, and they were in the corridor.
One of them relieved the winded Bobbie of his end of the door at
the foot, of the stairs, but Gissing bore his burden to the very
couch in Hartwell's room, where he deposited him, and then dropped
into a chair, panting painfully.</p>

<p>Martha meantime, was taken to her own room; brandy was poured
between the teeth of both, and they were in bed in dry clothes
before Gloucester arrived at noon with the doctor.</p>

<p>The doctor told Bobbie that Martha would not live, but that
Hartwell would do well, though his arm was seriously injured;
little could be done till the nurses, for whom he had sent from
Felmingham, should arrive. He himself waited at the Pavilion most
of the day, Gloucester meanwhile taking journeys to bring the
objects required by the doctor, and in the afternoon to bring the
nurses. Bobbie and Gissing sat with Hartwell, while Sarah and
another servant was with Martha. Rosie was below, looking out in
low spirits through one of the French windows of the drawing-room,
occasionally catching a sight of the Parisienne, Ernestine,
enjoying the beauties of nature down an avenue of the forest. Near
three, Rosie was called to a tardy lunch. In crossing a passage,
she saw Bobbie and the doctor coming down the stairs, lingered till
the doctor went into the dining-room, and retaining Bobbie outside
asked him in a low voice: "How are they Bobbie?"</p>

<p>"Looking better&mdash;You oughtn't to have peeped, you know,
Rosie."</p>

<p>"But, Bobbie, I have something to tell you: you mustn't
laugh&mdash;promise me first that you won't laugh, if I am
wrong."</p>

<p>"Well, I promise."</p>

<p>"Bobbie, you promised not to laugh," replied Rosie, "but when I
peeped and saw them, I seemed to recognise them both; she looked
something like my mother, and I'm sure he is the image of my
stepfather, for I remember him very well&mdash;and the same name,
too, 'Drayton.'"</p>

<p>Bobbie, after staring at her a moment, said: "That seems
odd."</p>

<p>"I am sure that there's a great resemblance," said Rosie.</p>

<p>"It must be some coincidence, I suppose," said Bobbie. "My
guardian has only lately married, apparently, so he couldn't very
well have been your stepfather five years ago; and yet&mdash;by
Jove, if it were only true! No, it is only some coincidence. Come,
have some lunch."</p>

<p>The coincidence, however, haunted the young couple that night,
and was much discussed between them; accordingly, the next
afternoon, three hours after Martha had opened her eyes, Bobbie let
Rosie go into Martha's room: for just the opposite of what the
doctor had foretold came true, since Martha recovered herself more
quickly than Hartwell, the fact being that Hartwell was a very
strong, still breather, so that during the hours in the well he had
breathed more of the poisonous air, and far more deeply, than the
worthy Martha; hence, by four o'clock on the Monday afternoon,
Martha had Rosie locked in her arms, but it was not till after five
that Hartwell became conscious.</p>

<p>Hartwell lay still for some time, till, turning his head a
little, with a twinkle in his eye he saw Bobbie, who was reading a
book by the bedside; in a far corner, looking down at the floor,
sat the old Gissing; a nurse was at the dressing-table, tidying. So
far Bobbie had heard nothing of how Rosie had fared in Martha's
room, which was some distance away: for Rosie was lying in bed with
her mother; who, all taken up with the gladsome fact of her
daughter's presence, would not let Rosie depart in order to call
and exhibit Bobbie to her; and presently Bobbie, looking up, beheld
the knowing twinkle in Hartwell's eye.</p>

<p>"Well. Bobbie, is that you?" asked Hartwell.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you so well, sir," said Bobbie, springing
up.</p>

<p>"What about my wife?"</p>

<p>"She has recovered consciousness, sir, and is doing very
well.",</p>

<p>"Excellent. When, then, were we brought up out of the well?"</p>

<p>"About 11 o'clock yesterday morning, sir. This is Monday
evening."</p>

<p>"Not till 11 in the morning? Who discovered us in the well?"</p>

<p>"Gissing, sir."</p>

<p>Hartwell's eye turned and dwelt with a grave meaning in it upon
Gissing in his corner, who made a sudden, glad gesture of greeting
with his arm toward the bed.</p>

<p>"And Martha is really doing well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What became of you, Bobbie?"</p>

<p>"I was in Paris, sir."</p>

<p>"Kidnapped, my friend? Imprisoned?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Why, then, did you not write to me?"</p>

<p>"It is rather a long; story, sir. I know that I was wrong, but
perhaps if we wait until you are a little stronger&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, tell me now."</p>

<p>"The fact is, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's a man: don't be afraid."</p>

<p>"I was married, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah! married! that solution never struck me. Of course, that was
it. I also&mdash;I also got married, Bobbie." And in these last
words was, a sorrow and reproach which wounded the young man,
though he did not understand why.</p>

<p>"I do hope that you will be able to forgive me, sir," said
Bobbie, earnestly. "I feel terribly that I have been undutiful and
a coward. I made you a promise which I have not kept; but in
looking for the girl of your choice, I found my wife, if one may
say so; and I was terribly tempted to disobey you by the
love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say nothing, my friend," said Hartwell. "Your existence was
probably not allotted you with the sole design of accomplishing my
wishes, and accordingly you do nothing of the kind. You have done
as your father before you did, married unadvisedly in your youth,
and as you have sown, so you will reap."</p>

<p>"I have hoped that you will be able to forgive me, sir. I think
if you only saw&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You have displeased and ill-used me, sir, more than you dream.
I had pledged my word that you should marry her whom I sent you to
seek; this marriage of yours places me in a doubly false position;
and at one period of my life&mdash;take my word for it&mdash;you
should have bitterly experienced my resentment. A letter from you
some weeks ago might have&mdash;well! but what has to be will be.
You are forgiven, if your companion proves to be us healthy in mind
as she seems to be in body."</p>

<p>"You are awfully good and kind, sir, really," said Bobbie,
warmly pressing his father's hand with a light feeling that the
ordeal was nearly over.</p>

<p>"I am sure that you will be fond of her, sir: she is quite as
healthy in mind as you seem to know that she is in body."</p>

<p>"I know from one of her red and crisp hairs, which you carry
about on your person, my friend. I will see your agreeable
companion, if you will bring her. First, go to Martha with my
compliments, and ask her how she does."</p>

<p>Bobbie turned to go, but before he had made a step, one of the
two doors of the room opened, and in the opening appeared Martha,
looking very weak and white, with a dressing gown thrown round her,
supported by Rosie and Sarah Gissing, and anxiously followed by a
nurse. Martha was all sighs, and yet was smiling. Hartwell sat up
on his elbow, considering her and Rosie with a vivacious eye, while
Bobbie ran to them, brought Martha, and placed her in the easy
chair, in which he had been sitting by Hartwell's bedside.</p>

<p>"Well, James," sighed Martha&mdash;"Rosie, is this the young
man?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma,'" answered Rosie, her eyes fixed upon Hartwell with
a rather scared and stand-offish expression, even though she now
knew that it must have been herself whom Bobbie had been sent to
seek; but she had acquired the habit of thinking of Hartwell with
awe ever since her marriage, and moreover now saw in him the
terrible stepfather who had separated her from her mother, and had
shut her away from the world five years ago.</p>

<p>As for Hartwell, when he heard Martha say "Rosie," and Rosie say
"Mamma," he understood all, that Bobbie had unknowingly married the
girl whom he had been sent to look for; and at once a feeling of
lightness and warm happiness, which communicated itself to every
heart, became his mood. He put out his hand and shook Rosie's,
saying, "I am glad to see you," while Rosie smiled and blushed like
a fresh rose.</p>

<p>The good Martha was sighing as much for joy as for her
feebleness, saying incoherently: "Well, he seems a nice young
man&mdash;Why don't you come and kiss your mother, boy? Look at the
pair of them! People say that marriages are made in
Heaven&mdash;but there's no love like a mother's love. James, why
ever didn't you tell me they were married!"</p>

<p>"I wished to surprise you, Martha," said the worthy and ever
artful Hartwell, with a benign and dancing eye.</p>

<p>"My goodness, that little girl, who would have believed it?"
sighed Martha: "Can you see how it is with her, James? It's a pair
of them, my goodness; I only hope that that young man is legally
married to her. I hardly know her, she's that grown, and such a
pretty girl she's got, too.</p>

<p>"Look at her colour, and her eyes, the image of Harper's, and
red hair like his; it used to be as black as mine when she was a
child. Boy, why don't you say something to your mother, and let me
hear you talk? He really is a very nice young man. She couldn't
have done much better. Well, everything turns out for the best,
after all. I never felt so strange and happy as to-day, like my
first find second wedding days, the third don't count, for though
I've been married thrice, I've only had two husbands&mdash;enough
to make anybody laugh&mdash;"</p>

<p>Martha laughed droopingly and faintingly; she was in a species
of happy distraction and flightiness of mind, almost, resembling
hysteria.</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad to see you happy, Martha," said Hartwell, "and
your happiness makes me happy also. Rosie, are you glad to have
found your mother?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, papa, thank you," said Rosie with a curtsey.</p>

<p>"Bobbie, I congratulate you on having found a charming wife and
an excellent mother. Let me now see you embrace your mother."</p>

<p>"I'm charmed, sir, I'm sure," said Bobbie, with his little
superior smile, and kissed Martha on each cheek.</p>

<p>Martha now began to cry for joy, saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it's good of you, James give the devil his due, after
all. You didn't act well by me, locking me up in that tower five
long years, and taking the child away. No one could say that you
did, James; but still, give the devil his due, you've made up for
it now; oh, yes, one must say that much for you, James."</p>

<p>"I have done nothing," said Hartwell, frankly, now, "the young
man will tell you that it is all a happy chance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no, it isn't," answered Martha, blindly: "you've given her
back to me, and married her to the fairy prince, as you said you
would. I never believed that you would, because I know that you are
always such a one for saying what you don't mean. But you've done
it right enough; and I daresay you've thought hard of me for
nagging at you when you meant all the time to do it. Oh, yes,
there's no saying but what you've acted well by me lately. I know
what you did in going down that well, after me, and nearly getting
drowned your self; for Rosie has told me; and you look about as
pale and weak as I do, I'm sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I couldn't help myself&mdash;" began Hartwell.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you could," drawled the worthy and excellent Martha.
"It's a wonder to me that you didn't leave my poor old hones down
there, so as to marry that other tall woman, got up like a
princess, who came to see you that night, for I shouldn't be
surprised if you have one of those sort of women in your eye all
the time. But you thought more of your old woman, than of all the
lot of them, when she was in danger, didn't you; and risked your
life, too&mdash;Oh, no, I've got to kiss you for that, James."</p>

<p>Martha at last gave to Hartwell her first kiss since he had
released her from the tower, lifting herself slowly on the arms of
the easy chair, bending over and laying her lips upon his&mdash;a
kiss so sweet to Hartwell that his eyes closed with rapture.</p>

<p>But Martha had not much room in her mind for any of the many
emotions which thronged in it that day, except for her love of
Rosie, her pride in her, and that sense of novelty and excitement
with which one receives a fortune or a rich present. She turned
from the bed to receive a cordial, which one of the nurses had
brought, and drank it, looking up into the charming face of Rosie,
with her arms around her; while Rosie looked at Hartwell&mdash;her
awe now partly gone, and smiled to him, and Hartwell returned her
smile with a beaming eye.</p>

<p>"And as to the Count and Oswald?" asked Hartwell, "where are
they, Bobbie?"</p>

<p>"They went to London on Saturday, I am told," answered Bobbie,
"and haven't come back yet."</p>

<p>"That is odd; haven't they written?"</p>

<p>"They may have: some letters came this morning."</p>

<p>Among those letters was one from Oswald, commanding Hartwell to
be at Oswald's rooms in London that (Monday) afternoon at three;
but as Bobbie made a movement to go and got the letters, Hartwell
said, "well, never mind, we shall see later," for at that moment
Rosie was at his head with a brush in her hand, about to brush his
rumpled hair, and Hartwell took her little hand and kissed it,
saying at the same time to Bobbie, "All's well that ends well."</p>

<p>"I'm charmed, sir, I'm sure, to have so exactly carried out your
wishes," said Bobbie, with his little smile of self-approval. "Saul
went out to seek his father's asses, sir, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And became one of them, Bobbie, though he found a kingdom. Let
nothing be said, my friend&mdash;Well, this is charming to have my
hair brushed by such interesting hands." Hartwell looked up at
Rosie, with soft eyes, and she smiled with him. "But you were a
naughty girl to run away; I heard all from Mary Seward, and was
cross with you.'"</p>

<p>"It was he who carried me away," answered Rosie, slyly, all
blushes and lowered lids, indicating Bobbie with the brush
handle.</p>

<p>"Ah, ah, it was he; let the blame be with him, then. But, tell
me, were you, on the whole, moderately happy with Miss Seward?'</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, only I was lonely sometimes. I wanted mamma."</p>

<p>"I see all; but you are to believe that if it were to do again,
I should not do it, but should keep you by my side, to protect and
cherish you."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa. It is all right now, since you sent Bobbie for me in
the end. But why did you tell him, papa, that I had black hair, and
that my name was Drayton?"</p>

<p>"You had black hair at one time," said Hartwell, for he had just
heard Martha say so, "and as for the name, let nothing be said; you
can readily conceive that since I now consider you my own dear
daughter, you were no longer Harper to me, but Drayton."</p>

<p>This equivocal answer fully satisfied the mind of Rosie and of
all, for they were all in that mental state in which the present
alone seems of importance, and whatever points remained mysterious
to any of them, were put in the background as of little moment in
the face of their actual happiness.</p>

<p>Martha meanwhile was plying Bobbie with questions as to the
place and date of his marriage, as to the strangeness of its
privacy, and of his long absence from Corton, or praising his good
looks and sprightly air, or giving vent to proverbs such as that
there is no love like a mother's love, and that marriages are made
in Heaven; then she turned to Hartwell, laying her cheek
affectionately on his right hand (the left was in a sling), causing
Hartwell's eyes to soften; and immediately afterwards, in her happy
restlessness of mind, she was ogling with mock propriety at Rosie's
condition, pretending to be scandalised that that little child, who
was only so high a short time ago, should think of being a
mother.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this, Martha's nurse came interposing with
the demand that Martha should return to bed. Martha protested, but
Hartwell said: "Go, Martha, and I will rejoin you presently in your
room." Whereupon Martha was lilted by Bobbie and accompanied out by
Rosie, who at the door, turned to give a parting smile to Hartwell,
for between her and him there had already sprung up a secret
understanding of amity and love.</p>

<p>When they were gone, Hartwell lay on his bed with closed eyes,
drawing together the frown of his brow with his fingers, feeling
that he had never been half so purely and deeply happy as in that
hour; for as it were, a taste of sweet waters was in his breast,
and a sound of that rhythm, which leaves the creation in a dancing
march; he called the old Gissing to him, after some minutes, and
with out saying anything, held the countryman's hand in his.</p>

<p>While he was doing this, there was a tap at that door of his
bedroom' which opened into his little laboratory and study, and in
came Dulaunay, with excited eyes, his hat on his head, and a
hand-camera in his hand, for, fresh from London, he had just heard
below, for the first time, the story of Hartwell's and Martha's
night in the well. Hartwell called out, "Ah, Count, here we are,
you see," and Dulaunay, going to the bed, took the sick man's hand
with a gaze of new interest in the "Draytong" who was no longer
"Draytong" to him, new interest, reverence and curiosity.</p>

<p>"I have heard&mdash;But, <i>mon Dieu</i>! you have the pale
air!" breathed the Count; "is the arm, then, broken, sir?"</p>

<p>"Is the arm broken, nurse?" asked Hartwell.</p>

<p>"Only dislocated at the shoulder, sir; it will be all right in a
few days," answered the nurse.</p>

<p>"I am conscious of no pain," said Hartwell: "I am well! I am
strong!"</p>

<p>"How many hours, for example, were you there&mdash;down in that
well," asked Dulaunay.</p>

<p>"Over twelve, my friend. If you had come back, as you promised,
you would have drawn me out."</p>

<p>"Yes, I avow my fault, but how could I have been able to divine
that which would arrive? In that which I did, my intention was
good. But as to the excellent Martha?"</p>

<p>"She goes well also."</p>

<p>"It is very well. But that which astonishes me is your audacity
to descend that well alone. I can feel the terror of it in my
nerves&mdash;phrrrrr. And it was Martha that you went to seek?"</p>

<p>"My wife, Count."</p>

<p>"Precisely sir, your wife."</p>

<p>The excellent Count said no more, but taking off his cap laid
his lips on Hartwell's hand.</p>

<p>"And as to the two young married!" he cried, with fresh
animation when this deep act of homage was over; "have you then
seen them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have seen them," said Hartwell, smiling.</p>

<p>"Oh, la, la, have you been, then, angry?"</p>

<p>"No, I have been content. The lady whom Bobbie has married is
the same whom I sent him and you to look for in
Gloucestershire."</p>

<p>"Not possible!"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank God."</p>

<p>The Count gave vent to a buffoon laugh, crying out:</p>

<p>"Oh, la, la, it is even the history of Oedipus. He has, then,
married, rightly, by mistake, the young Bobbie. Here is that which
it is to be tricked by the destiny. He wished to play the prodigal,
and finds himself, probably with disgust, the good son. Miss
Scatchett told me in London&mdash;By the way, "Draytong", have you
received the envelope with the shreds of paper from Oswald?"</p>

<p>At this question Hartwell's eyebrows lifted.</p>

<p>"You don't mean that you have given them to Oswald?" he asked,
struck by a pang of vague apprehension.</p>

<p>"But yes," answered the Count. "I was pressed to arrive
somewhere Sunday night, and gave the envelope to Oswald that he
might bring it to you, that which he undertook to do; but when I
returned to Addison-road more late, Miss Scatchett said me, to my
astonishment, that Oswald had not gone down to Corton, but had the
intention to sleep in London. Yesterday, therefore, I rendered
myself at Oswald's apartment in order to ask him why he had not
brought the envelope, since I knew that you wished to receive it at
once, but Oswald was not at home; this morning again I went to see
him, and again he was not at home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, let us hope that the matter may not prove serious,
Count."</p>

<p>"How? Do those shreds contain anything of secret, then?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea what they contain," said Hartwell. "I only know
that by this time Oswald has read them, and that that may mean
mischief."</p>

<p>"Oh, my head of magpie!" exclaimed Dulaunay in despair. "What
vexing circumstances. How could I have been able to be so stupid,
so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well never mind. Perhaps it is not of importance," said
Hartwell. "Oswald may even have sent the shreds, for I have not yet
seen my letters to-day. You might look for me, Count, on my desk in
the study, and see if there is anything in Oswald's writing, also
any Birmingham letters about my electrical machine, to be tested
to-morrow. Bring those, and leave the rest."</p>

<p>Dulaunay hurried into the next room, but immediately returned,
saying that there was no letters, for they had not been put, as
usual, on Hartwell's desk that morning, but handed to Bobbie, who
had put them somewhere else.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind; another time," said Hartwell, who was too
happy in Martha's happiness to be greatly troubled by vague
possibilities. "I have to go to Martha's room, where I hope you
will join us all, Count, after dinner."</p>

<p>By this time it was six o'clock, and the lamp was alight.
Dulaunay helped Hartwell to rise and dress, conducted his rather
feeble steps to Martha's room, was presented to the blushing Rosie,
and felicitated everyone. Then those that were well went down to
dinner, while Hartwell remained by Martha's bedside, till later on
all reassembled to spend the evening in Martha's room, an
old-fashioned apartment looking by two windows upon the lawn and
upon the forest, lighted by candies in sconces, and panelled in old
brown oak. Martha wished for whist, so a small table was drawn to
her bedside, where she and Hartwell played against Bobbie and
Dulaunay, while Rosie sat with her head on Bobbie's shoulder, and
one of her hands in Martha's. The Count acted the wild boy, with a
touch of the buffoon for Rosie's benefit, telling droll stories,
which when they tended to become too French were checked by a
glance of Hartwell's happy but doubtful eye, while Rosie had only
to lift her eyes to meet the Count's musing gaze of admiration. The
blinds were drawn, and a bright fire burned in the grate, for
outside a wintry moaning of the wind was heard. In a far corner of
the room sat the dumb Barnes, who had been brought upstairs after
dinner to see Hartwell, and had remained there ever since without a
movement, watching the family party at their game.</p>

<p>Martha for the first time played loosely, and lost a rubber. "I
can't believe my eyes," she said constantly. "Here have I been
expecting to see the same little girl that I lost five years ago,
and look at her now. Why, the boy and girl ought to be at school
instead of thinking of such things.</p>

<p>"No," said Hartwell, who approved of early marriages, "they have
done well."</p>

<p>"They are even in an excellent school," said the Count, "in
which they are the teachers one of the other. Bobbie, my friend, my
compliments. Your taste is even exquisite, if madame will permit me
to say it. I raise my glass to you both."</p>

<p>The Count clinked his glass with Bobbie's and Rosie's, then with
Hartwell's and Martha's and all round the glasses clinked. On the
table were the old decanters, with loose gold rings round their
necks marked Port and Sherry, together with cake and biscuits.</p>

<p>"Martha, I drink to your excellent health," said Hartwell with a
lifted glass.</p>

<p>"Thank you, James," replied Martha, "and I drink to yours, too,
James."</p>

<p>"Shall we always live here, and never go away anywhere, or be
separated?" asked Rosie.</p>

<p>"Would you like that?" asked Hartwell, gently.</p>

<p>"Oh, I should, papa," cried Rosie, "for I do so like Corton. I
never dreamt that there could be such a nice old place, looking
just like a fairy place. I hope that we shall be always here, and
just like this every night, you and mamma, and Bobbie and Monsieur
le Comte and I, and no one else. Bobbie, listen to the sound of the
wind in the woods."</p>

<p>"You shall be well pleased," said Hartwell. "Here we will stay,
and you shall be the young Queen of Corton, and we all your court,
for I see that you are fully worthy to be our Queen, and our
darling also."</p>

<p>Bobbie's eyes rested a moment on his guardian's face with a
grateful and reverent look.</p>

<p>"James, don't fill the child's mind with flattery and fancies,"
said Martha. "You are going to spoil her; I can see it already. I
daresay the child knows how sweet and pretty she is as it is,
without any telling. Just look at her!"</p>

<p>While Martha was saying this, Dulaunay was leaning over the
table to wards his partner, Bobbie, asking in a low voice, "Do you
know, by chance, where is Marston House? Somewhere in
Norfolk&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Someone told me yesterday that it is about six miles from
here," answered Bobbie. "Are you going to see Julia there?"</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h," went the Count, for Martha had just finished occupying
the attention of Hartwell, who, however, had heard the whispered
word Julia, and lowered his eyes awhile.</p>

<p>The lateness of the sitting-up that night was without precedent
at Corton. Dulaunay sang the Toreador's song without any
accompaniment, and Rosie, in a frail, sweet voice that trembled,
sang "La Bondeuse," in French. Several times the glasses clinked
together all round. Even to Dulaunay the charm of the domestic
pleasantness and peace in which he found himself communicated
itself.</p>

<p>Between all of them were continually interchanged fond glances,
smiles full of gentle meanings, pressure and touches of the hands,
and words of kindness and affection. Martha saw her James in a
milder light, with forgiveness and remorse for having so long
misunderstood his repentance and change of heart toward her, while
upon Rosie and Bobbie she looked with the fullest satisfaction of
her maternal yearnings. Hartwell, for his part, felt a pious joy at
Martha's friendship for him, which almost repaid him for all the
sacrifices that had at last won him it. He could easily forgive
Bobbie the pain and anxiety which Bobbie had caused him, seeing
that the young man's escapade had turned out so fortunately; while,
as to Rosie, every hour that passed seemed to water and endear the
happy understanding which had sprung up between Hartwell and the
charming girl.</p>

<p>The two nurses at last combined to interpose, and put an end to
the family reunion.</p>

<p>When Hartwell, after saying goodnight, had reached the beginning
of the corridor leading to his chamber, Rosie ran after him, and
embraced him there in the dark with an upturned face, for all her
fear of him had now turned into a hearty and sweet familiarity.</p>

<p>"My dear one," murmured Hartwell, as he strained her to him with
his right arm, and laid a kiss on her forehead.</p>

<p>The next (Tuesday) morning, every one met everyone else at
breakfast, for the new happiness had given to Martha new life, and
the night in the well was already being forgotten; after breakfast
the family went out, Martha among them, to the glade in the pine,
wood where the well is, that all might look down into the dark
depths, and enjoy a shudder at the contemplation of what had been,
and of what might have been.</p>

<p>They were all still there at half-past eleven in the forenoon,
when the Count proposed to photograph them in a family group, for
the excellent and erratic Frenchman had lately taken up photography
as a hobby. His proposal was hailed with delight by Rosie and
Martha, and Dulaunay ran away toward the pavilion for his camera,
plates, cloth, and tripod. It was a bright November day, a little
less than five years since Hartwell had taken upon himself the name
of Drayton; the air was rather crisp, and masses of cloud in the
sky betokened rain before very long; but still the day was sunshiny
and pleasant. Dulaunay returned with his apparatus, planted the
tripod amid the fern, and placed the party on the coping of the
well; Hartwell sat with his arm round Rosie's waist, and Rosie's
head on his shoulder; Bobbie, smiling the little smile with which
he scribbled his smart elegiacs, held Martha's hand, and waited.
The worthy and excellent Count, who was as busy and flushed as
though the late of kingdoms hung upon the outcome, dived under his
cloth, re-emerged, called out directions, pleaded with silent
motions of the palm, and subsided again under his cloth; he had
just cried out: "Now, rest tranquil, all!" and was about to let fly
his catch, when Oswald suddenly appeared on the scene within the
scope of the camera, spoiling everything.</p>

<p>Oswald had just arrived from London. He looked at all the
members of the group, and without a word or gesture of greeting to
anyone, to the alarm of all he said to Hartwell:</p>

<p>"James, I wish to speak to you at once."</p>

<p>Hartwell was about to tell Dulaunay to finish taking the
photograph, but a second glance at Oswald's face, which was as pale
as death, caused him to change his mind; he pronounced the words:
"I come," rose, said to the ladies, "You will excuse me," and went
after Oswald, who had turned again into the alley leading to the
road in the forest, which runs past the lawn before the
pavilion.</p>

<p>Up to this moment Hartwell had not read his Monday's letters,
nor those of that (Tuesday) morning, he was so preoccupied with the
new charms of family and home-life which had just arisen for him
like a little oasis in his desert; he was intending to read the
letters after lunch in his study, where he meant also to await the
telegram from Birmingham, which was to tell him the result of the
trial of his electrical machine. He had not therefore seen Oswald's
letter commanding him to go to London to meet Oswald; but judging
from Oswald's face and manner, and knowing that Oswald held those
shreds of whose contents Hartwell knew nothing, save that they must
be very important, Hartwell had a foreboding of calamity, as he
followed Oswald through the forest.</p>

<p>Oswald walked some five or six yards in advance, never looking
behind. His limp seemed to be accentuated that morning: he leant
markedly 011 his stick; his hat was tilted forward on his forehead.
Hartwell came behind, he too limping a little (on account of the
nail which had pierced his foot in the well), in a long silk jacket
and a broad hat, his left arm in its sling. The alarm upper most in
his mind was that in some unguessable way the shreds had revealed
to Oswald that Hartwell was not Drayton: but he was about to find
that the reality was even worse than this.</p>

<p>They passed across the lawn into the pavilion. Oswald turned
into the drawing room; but Hartwell, looking in after him, said,
"Come up to my study," and went up the main stairs. Oswald followed
to the back of the house. In the little study, or laboratory,
Hartwell sat on the chair before the desk, which was the only one
there, pushed up his hat from his brow, and said: "Now,
Oswald."</p>

<p>Oswald limped twice through the room before answering; in fact,
he could hardly speak at first, his breath was so short. He had
come to the great moment of his life, and it was too much for
Oswald. The previous night he had written a second letter to
"James," ordering "James" to come to London; but early that morning
he had been unable to bear his impatience any longer, and had taken
a train for Norfolk; and now that he was here, he could hardly
command his breath sufficiently to speak; the mounting of the
stairs had had upon him the effect of the climbing of an Alp; his
chest heaved; his face for a minute or two was the picture of
agitation.</p>

<p>"That's a man," said Hartwell, encouragingly, "let us hear."</p>

<p>"I wrote you," panted Oswald, "why did you not come?'"</p>

<p>"I have been ill; you see my arm in the sling; I have not seen
your letter," replied Hartwell.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, worse luck for you: you have kept me waiting and
looking out; you have made me suffer"&mdash;and as Oswald said
this, a little colour returned to his face, he got some breath, and
his agitation at the presence of Hartwell's personality began to
change rapidly into a mood of fierceness and tyranny.</p>

<p>"I am sorry," said Hartwell, to have made you suffer. But what
is the matter?"</p>

<p>"You know: the Frenchman has told you that I have Letty Barnes'
letter."</p>

<p>Hartwell's mind was clear, for his pulses continued to beat
quietly: and he at once concluded that this "Letty Barnes" was the
girl with whom Drayton had stayed at the Gissings', as Gissing had
told him; that Drayton may have murdered her; that she must have
been Barnes' daughter; and that this explained Barnes' old mania
for taking his life; but he said, in order to be sure:</p>

<p>"Who is this Letty Barnes?"</p>

<p>Oswald put his hand to his breast pocket, drew out Letty's old
photograph, which he had one day stolen from an album at the Anchor
Inn, five years before, and held it some distance from Hartwell's
eyes, with a cruel smile, saying: "I think you know her,
James?"</p>

<p>"Letty 'Barton!'" breathed Hartwell, remembering with a pang all
his reasonings about the murder of that girl.</p>

<p>"You have yourself told me, and proved to me, all the facts
about the murder which are necessary to hang you," said Oswald;
"all that was needed was some proof that you were acquainted with
her on the night when you stopped at the 'Anchor' in your motor
car, and her letter proves that you were then her lover. You
haven't a leg to stand on. Why didn't you burn those shreds long
ago, James? What a fool you are, after all! Oh, you are a
fool&mdash;you are, you know, you are. Writing pamphlets on
evolution! turning man-of-science, eh? adopting strange boys? but
what a fool you are! Will you ever put me into any more prisons
again, James?&mdash;for doing nothing? Couldn't you see how rash
and blind that was? Didn't you understand that my day would come?
that though I might wait for years, yet I never, never fail in the
end? and that when I strike I always strike dead! Ah, you are a
fool!"</p>

<p>Oswald limped about striking the floor with his stick, beside
himself in a rage of wounded self-love, as he pronounced this
speech; all his pallor was gone, and his face was now flushed,
though even so, he hardly looked like one who "always strikes
dead." As for Hart well, his lip trembled a little; with a rapid
mind he had already reviewed the facts of the situation, and,
without having any need to read Letty's letter, he understood that
the net of proof was complete about him, that at last the evil
doings of Drayton had brought him into a fix from which there was
hardly any way of escape: for, from Oswald's intense words, he saw
that Oswald was in a state of mind morbidly inflamed, jealous, and
spiteful, and would not spare. Hartwell's shoulders seemed to bend
lower under this sudden infliction of fate; he smiled steadily,
mincingly, as usual, but with paler lips; his eye wandered to the
side of the room, at which the research apparatus stood: all that
was over for him now; he thought of the dear ones whom he had left
in the glade of the pinewood: that was over, too; in a singular way
he saw the complete vision of his history so far, what he had done,
what he had suffered, the course in which his life had been
destined to run, and had run; and this was the end. He stood
confronted with the gallows.</p>

<p>"So, Oswald, you accuse me of the murder of Letty Barnes?" he
said, quietly.</p>

<p>"You are merely a poor fool," answered Oswald, with a laugh,
revelling in this abuse, in this word "fool," as men sometimes rush
in and trample with a profane joy on what they have long been
forced to revere, and revelling all the more in it, because he
suspected that Hartwell considered him to be the very thing which
he called Hartwell, and that Hartwell's silent opinion was worth
something, whereas what he himself loudly insisted on was worth
nothing. "You are merely a poor fool; why that shred with the
'cruel brute' I got out of a coat that yon gave me yourself, and
all that about a struggle for a letter and the rest might never
have been discovered, if you hadn't blabbed it."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I have been a poor fool, as you say, not only in
respect of this matter, but in others, in all others,
perhaps&mdash;" Hartwell said this with a bowed head, and an almost
elderly meekness and resignation.</p>

<p>"You put me into prison, James,"' said Oswald, smiling: "was
that sweet to you? Did you forget that I was your brother? That
first night in the cell I felt sure that you would do something the
next day to get me out; but you stuck to it, Jimmy; even the
magistrate tried to turn you; everybody felt pity for me; only you,
who alone knew that I was innocent, were hard. Are you sorry, now,
Jimmy? Do you bitterly repent now? Down to your knees, you beast!
Too late! Too late!"</p>

<p>Oswald's fist suddenly lifted to strike, while Hartwell held his
head away from the blow with winking eyes; but it did not descend;
Oswald turned and limped about the room, all breathless again.</p>

<p>"Do not any more embitter yourself by such reflections, Oswald,
than you are already bitter," said Hartwell: "I understand your
resentment, and consider it just. Tell me now how you intend me to
expiate my transgressions."</p>

<p>"You wrote a letter to the papers, clearing me," said Oswald;
"Magee says that you got my sentence shortened by two weeks. Yes,
you did that. For that I don't mind letting you live; and if you
have any cash here at Corton you may keep that much. All else you
will hand over to me to-day, all scrip, title deeds, banking
accounts, ownerships, and policies. I have stamps with me for the
conveyance and authorisations; and you are not to leave this room
without me, or send any letter or telegram, until all is duly
done."</p>

<p>There was a silence when this was said. Hartwell was bent over
his knee, his brow on his hand; he turned upon Oswald a look, not
fierce, but full of power and import; and he said:</p>

<p>"But, Oswald, the terms are hard."</p>

<p>"Pretty ruffian you must have been, ah Heavens! to maul in that
way a poor girl!"</p>

<p>"Let my transgressions be admitted. But, Oswald, you reduce me
in one day to poverty.'"</p>

<p>"To the very dregs of beggary!"</p>

<p>"You forget my wife, my ward, and my ward's young wife, who will
be left unprovided for.'"</p>

<p>(In his prison in Hobham House five years before this, the old
Gissing had once used almost these identical words to Hartwell,
which Hartwell now used to Oswald).</p>

<p>"I cannot forget what I never remembered," answered Oswald.
"There is no question of those people, who ever they may be. Let
them work, or beg. Your wife is almost worthy of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She is more than worthy of me: as to that say nothing, my
friend, lest yon incur my displeasure. But, Oswald, I say that the
terms are cruelly hard: you must modify them; you must relent and
be merciful."</p>

<p>"I am sparing your beastly life; don't flatter yourself, my good
fellow, that you have anything more to hope from me. You might as
well plead to that wall. I detest you cordially, and should enjoy
seeing you starve on the streets; I daresay Lady Methwold would,
too, and might toss you half-a-crown."</p>

<p>"Be that as it may&mdash;But, Oswald, your terms are hard."</p>

<p>"We had better get to work. You are not to argue."</p>

<p>"But, Oswald, I am a crafty man: are you not afraid that, if you
pressed me so hard, I may do something to baulk you of that
affluent future to which you now confidently look forward?"</p>

<p>"No, I am not afraid, Jimmy. A 'crafty man,' are
you?&mdash;impotent fool. Show me one sign of your craft to day,
and I break off everything, and send a telegram to Magee to hand
over the girl's letter to the police. Come, we had better get to
work."</p>

<p>"No, you must give me time. I am not alone concerned. I refuse
to decide without reflection. I will tell you my decision at five
this evening, if you will so far accommodate me."</p>

<p>"I don't see why I should, but I suppose that I may," said
Oswald.</p>

<p>"You remain a prisoner here though, if I do; you are not going
to send any messages to your bankers; I shall lock these
doors."</p>

<p>"I have no intention of sending any message to anyone, I assure
you. But lock my doors, if it pleases you to make me your prisoner.
When I have come to a decision, I shall ring for you."</p>

<p>"No, you won't be able to ring, I am going to break the bell
ropes," said Oswald: "I will come to you at five."</p>

<p>By this time Oswald was quite calm and well mannered again. He
locked the study door, broke the bell ropes in the study and in the
bedroom, locked the bedroom door on the outside, and put the two
keys in his pocket.</p>

<p>As he passed by, the study door again, on its outside, to
descend one of the back stairs of the house, he saw the back of
Dulaunay hurrying away down the stairs: for the Count had been
listening outside the study door to what had been said. Alarmed by
Oswald's sudden appearance in the glade, and by Oswald's order to
Hartwell, Dulaunay had followed them, understanding that something
grave must have happened; and since that something undoubtedly
arose out of his own fault in handing over the shreds to Oswald,
the Count had thought it within his right to listen to the outcome.
He went away from the study door appalled by what he had heard,
made his way to his own room, and there remained in great distress
of mind a long while.</p>

<p>Hartwell, meanwhile, sat a prisoner where Oswald had left him,
with a back bent as it were under the load of sorrows which the
dead Drayton had left behind for him. He found himself touched by
the grim Hand.</p>

<p>Death stared him in the face. His enemy was as relentless as
Hartwell himself had once been to others.</p>

<p>However "crafty" he might be, there seemed to be only two
possible courses of action open to him now, apart from consenting
to Oswald's terms; firstly he could declare that he had not killed
Letty Barnes, that he was not Drayton; or, secondly, he could shoot
himself. Any of the three would save him from the gallows, which he
had no intention of undergoing: and between these three he had now
choose.</p>

<p>If he chose to declare that he was not Drayton, nothing could be
easier for him than to prove it: there were those who had known him
familiarly as a working man in Birmingham, while Drayton was a
financier in South Africa and London; as to that there was no
difficulty. There were a thousand proofs, if he chose to call them
up, any one of which would be conclusive, that he was not
Drayton.</p>

<p>But if he said he was not Drayton, then Martha, Bobbie, and
Rosie would be beggared: for Martha was no longer Drayton's widow,
she was Hartwell's wife; Oswald had seen her married to Hartwell;
and the moment Hartwell, Martha's husband, ceased to possess
Drayton's wealth, Martha would possess nothing; Rosie, Bobbie,
would possess nothing; everything would be Oswald's, who was
Drayton's heir.</p>

<p>Willingly enough would Hartwell have cast off Drayton's name
now, and have returned to the working man life in the old scenes,
in order to clear himself of this loathsome charge; he was weary of
all the cark, which Drayton's name had brought, him, all the
frustrate longing, the hunger of the heart in the midst of wealth,
the indigestion&mdash;staring at a banquet; even the laboratory he
could now have left with little regret, for at the age 43 he
already felt elderly, and he knew that Nature will not show Her
secrets to weary men, but only to "the violent." He could have
cast, it all off with a sigh of relief, or at least of resignation.
But, if he escaped from the fix in this easy way, he saw in fancy
his dear ones suffering that poverty which he had known well and
still remembered, whose cruel spur had urged him that, night on the
Norwich Road to put on the clothes of the dead Drayton.</p>

<p>That way of escape, then, would not do. It would not be right
for him to be Drayton so long as that was convenient, and cease to
be Drayton the moment it became a question of bearing the brunt of
Drayton's crimes at the expense of others, who were innocent; nor
could Hartwell let his marriage with Martha prove Martha's ruin,
and the ruin of her daughter, and of his son.</p>

<p>If, again, he accepted Oswald's terms, still retaining Drayton's
name, and bearing the stigma of Drayton's crime, that, too, was a
way of escape; but the result to the others would be the same:
Oswald would have all, the others nothing. The third way of escape
was suicide.</p>

<p>Hartwell sat several hours brooding over all this on his chair
by the desk: but all the time he was conscious of what the end of
his reflections would be, nor was he the man to shirk that terrible
end. Suicide was not immoral, to his point of view, especially such
a suicide, not committed for his own sake. He would die that day as
Drayton. His will was already made, leaving all to Martha.</p>

<p>But there was still one other loophole of escape&mdash;his
electrical machine.</p>

<p>He expected to hear the result of the testing not later than
4.30 that day, and hence had put off giving his answer to Oswald
till five. If that turned out well, he could declare himself not
Drayton, and still be fairly rich; Martha, Rosie, Bobbie, would
still have an arm to protect them; and somewhere in Hartwell's mind
was even a thought, a hope, illogical and vague, of Julia.</p>

<p>All, then, depended on what, even as he sat a prisoner, was
going on in Birmingham.</p>

<p>Between twelve and three o'clock, he heard three several
tappings at the locked study and bedroom doors, the handles of
which were turned by someone. The first time it was a servant who
came to call him for lunch; the second time he heard the call,
"James," in Martha's voice; the third time it was Rosie, who, in a
low and awed voice, called, "papa," and afterwards went away on
tiptoe. Hartwell did not answer any of them. About three o'clock he
got up, his decision fully formed: if the news from Birmingham was
good, as he quite hoped, that would be well; if it was bad, he
would end his life, and that might be well also. He went into the
bedroom, and stood at a window looking from the east side of the
house upon the forest quite near it. It was now raining heavily and
drearily. Hartwell tapped idly upon his teeth with the handle of a
pen, watching the rain beat on the flat roof of the portico, and on
the sodden bed leaves which were everywhere; a few wet sparrows on
the portico and in the branches moped like children in punishment,
and seemed to wait upon heaven for the rain to pass, before
resuming their life of movement; there was no wind, and no sound in
the house or without it, but the sound of the rain and the rain
water in the spouts.</p>

<p>Hartwell presently turned to get what he had come from the study
for, his will. One by one, during the course of months, his trunks
had all found their way down to Corton, and now rather cumbered his
room; from one of them he took out a cash box which contained his
will and three five-pound notes, this being all the money which he
had with him. He put the notes on the mantelpiece, intending them
to be useful, till the household should adjust itself to the fact
of his death, if he died; as he was doing this, he heard a tap at
the bedroom door, and a voice say at the keyhole, "'Draytong', can
I speak with you at the hole of the lock?" It was Dulaunay.
Hartwell stood quite still; looking at his door, without making any
answer. After waiting two or three minutes, he went softly into the
study, sat at the desk, spread the will before him, and read
it.</p>

<p>During the next hour he was adding codicils to it, which he knew
that the main legatee and executors would carry out. To Bobbie,
personally, he left an annuity of £1000; to Oswald, one of £800; to
the Count D'Artenset-Villiers, one of £500; to the Gissings and to
Barnes, conjointly, one of £300, directing that Barnes should
continue to live with the Gissings; to Miss Scatchett one of £100;
to Steve Anderson, one of £70, with some other small bequests to
his captain, stewards, Drayton's old mistresses etc. To Julia he
left the manuscript of a half-written book, which he was writing at
the time when they were to have been married, but had not continued
since, also some little things which she had given him; to Rosie he
left the ring which he had worn for years on his little finger; and
he directed his body to be cremated three days after his death.</p>

<p>When this was done, he wrote a little note to Rosie in a tone of
gallantry, telling her to be as kind and good as she was sweet and
charming; he added in a postscript that health was the main
business of a human being, and gave her a few simple rules how to
keep healthy and live happily; and under all he put three crosses,
meaning kisses. He then took the will back into the bedroom, locked
it in to the cash box, and the cash box into the trunk, for he had
told Martha where he kept it; and now again he stood by the window,
looking out at the rain.</p>

<p>It was now past four o'clock, and already the day was darkening.
He began to be rather anxious about the expected telegram from
Birmingham for, assuming that by now everybody in the house must
know that he was Oswald's prisoner, whoever took in the telegram
might hand it to Oswald and Oswald might not give it to him. But
his doubts were laid to rest at 20 minutes past four, when there
was a tap, and he saw a telegram envelope pushed under the door. He
went softly, and picked it up. The envelope had been torn open by
Oswald, for below Oswald was playing the tyrant, and ordering
everything with, a high hand; but he had not probably understood
the meaning of the words on the telegram, and not caring, had let
it come to Hartwell. Hartwell's hands trembled as he picked it up,
and, seeing this, he would not read it at once, but put it on the
table, went and stood by the window till he was quite calm, and
then returned and read the telegram on which his life hung.</p>

<p>When he understood its meaning, his eye flashed, he pressed the
leaf of paper to his lips, and looking away towards the forest, he
pronounced the two words: "I come."</p>

<p>The telegram consisted of the words:</p>
<br>

<p class="telegram">SURPLUS WORK COUNTERBALANCED MORE THAN 5 PER
CENT BY FRICTION. CONDENSERS DO NOT ATTAIN LIMIT OF CHARGE. TENSION
TOO GREAT, QUANTITY TOO LITTLE. CRANK BROKEN. BROWN AND LISTER
WITHDRAW. FULLER DETAILS TO-NIGHT AFTER INTERVIEW WITH GANOT.
PRICE.</p>
<br>

<p>This as much as to say that the invention had not been a success
in practice.</p>

<p>Hartwell looked at his watch. In half an hour his time of grace
would be up, and Oswald would come. He did not mean to see Oswald
again and at once, lifting a big trunk off another, he unlocked the
bottom one; it was full of things and he could not see well, for
though it was only half past four, the day had turned out very
cheerless and wintry, and the room was dim. Hartwell placed two old
brass candlesticks on a chair by the trunk, lit the candles, and
sat on the floor to search the trunk. After throwing out some of
the clothes, he found a brace of revolvers, which, he knew were
ready loaded, and these he took.</p>

<p>In putting back the clothes he saw some rude clothes of his
working man days a pair of boots much worn and torn, cord trousers,
a greasy old jacket, a cloth hat, a dirty old scarf, and two red
handkerchiefs; Bobbie had had them five years before, as the last
relics of the father whom he supposed to be dead; and Hartwell, who
prized them, had taken them from Bobbie. His eye smiled now upon
them, and he replaced them carefully. In putting back the tray of
the trunk into its place, his eye rested fondly upon the little
packet of letters in it which Julia had written to him He took off
the elastic band from them and read them over by the candle
light.</p>

<p>Among them was her last letter to him, written at Berlin, weeks
after the rupture, and this, too, he re-read, till he came to where
she said "We seem to be the perfectly helpless victims of some
freak which has occurred somewhere; we can't help anything, not
being born or dreaming, nor crying, nor dying," and at this
Hartwell's heart was wrung, some travail in the nerve of tears
overpowered his hard-headedness, and for the first time since
boyhood the strong man gave way to weeping which distorted his
mouth and shook his frame; he laid his forehead on the trunk and
wept; nor was it mere self-pity that so keenly and deeply probed
the worthy Hartwell, but pity for the littleness of man, and the
bigness of his care; in his thoughts was that old haze of fire,
that "nebulae," the living Father of our world and of ourselves,
which held in the humor of its loins every tear that has since been
shed, every frenzy every oddity, every rhythm, and all the pathetic
tale of our earthly lot; and since it had held those very sobs
which shook Hartwell, those sobs were too potent to be choked down,
and had to break out. He was hungry, too, and cold, for there was
no fire in either of the two rooms.</p>

<p>He got up presently, took the two candlesticks, and one of the
revolvers, and, going into the study, put them on his desk. He sat
to the desk. He had little time to lose before Oswald should come.
His eye rested fondly a minute on his letter to Rosie, which lay on
the desk before him. Then he drew, or tried to draw, two deep
breaths, and, without looking at the weapon, he put out his hand,
and took it up. The bitterness of death made him sick. But his face
was grim, though a little pale. He opened his mouth and pointed the
revolver into it; his eyelids were closed, and winked a little.</p>

<p>But he was interrupted by a violent shaking of the study door;
and by the shout: "'Draytong', 'Draytong'!" Dulaunay had been
peeping through the key-holes, from which Oswald had removed the
keys, had heard Hartwell's sobs by the trunk, had seen the
revolvers taken out, and the sitting with one of them to the desk
in the light of the candles. All the afternoon, in fact, the
Frenchman had been spying with a boundless agitation upon Hartwell;
he had spent a day of flurry and distraction of mind, trying to
soothe the two distressed ladies, trying to reason with Oswald,
who, however, had insulted him, trying to torture out of his own
wits some plan of action. At his call Hartwell started and sprang
to his feet, shaken with ague from his head to his feet, shaken
even more violently than the Count was shaking outside the door:
for the nervous disorder caused by the interruption at the moment
of death was, of course, shocking, and nearly deprived Hartwell of
reason.</p>

<p>"Let me speak with you! come to the keyhole!" pleaded the Count
in French.</p>

<p>Hartwell could not have answered, if he would, and would not, if
he could.</p>

<p>"In the name of God, Drayton!" pleaded the Count outside.</p>

<p>Hartwell did not answer. He fell again into the chair, and his
head dropped upon his arms over the desk, his right hand clutching
the weapon; and so he remained several minutes, while the Count
stooped at the key hole, trembling violently, and staring at
Hartwell.</p>

<p>But all at once the Count was gone from the door under the
impulse of a sudden decision; with a wild face, without any hat, he
flew out of the house toward the stables, found Gloucester in his
room, made him saddle quickly one of the two horses, and, while
Gloucester was doing this, made him describe carefully the way to
Marston House, where Julia was, six miles away to the east of
Corton; and Dulaunay set off at a gallop through the wet and now
dark evening.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>XXXIII. &mdash; A FORTUNATE
MEETING</h2>

<p class="first">Hartwell, meantime, sat with his head on his arms,
incapable, for the time being of accomplishing the act of
self-destruction, not only because he thought that Dulaunay might
be still spying, and there is something immodest in the act of
suicide before a witness, but because he was so unmanned by the
interruption. But as he sat so, a key was put into the study door,
and Oswald, again with a very agitated face, entered the room.
"Now, James," said Oswald, with his hand on the inner handle of the
door.</p>

<p>Hartwell had quickly pushed the revolver into a pigeon hole,
where it was hidden; and he turned a haggard face to Oswald.</p>

<p>"I say no, Oswald," said he. "Oh, you do?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Aha!"</p>

<p>"My friend, is their no compromise possible?"</p>

<p>"None, by God! your chance is past&mdash;" At once, Oswald
slipped quickly out of the door in a flame of rage; locked it again
upon Hartwell, and, almost as wildly as Dulaunay had run, ran to
the stable. There, Gloucester, at his command, put his own saddle
on the other carriage horse, and Oswald galloped away to ward
Felmingham to charge Hartwell with the murder of Letty Barnes, and
bring about his immediate arrest.</p>

<p>Hartwell, for his part, knew why and in what mind Oswald had
gone, and did not intend to be arrested. Those unexpected words "I
say no" had shattered Oswald's dream of affluence, and he ran from
the study door a mere missile of hatred, forgetting or ignoring
everything, except the hunger to be avenged which drove him. But
however he might hurry, Hartwell knew that he could not return with
the police in less than two or perhaps three hours. Hartwell,
therefore had that much space to live in.</p>

<p>He got up and paced the rooms. To the most jaded man, to the man
of strongest and coldest mind, suicide must be bitter when it comes
to the point; but tenfold bitter must it be for a man who has come
to the point, and been baulked, to come to the point again. The
instinct of escape now arose in Hartwell; but it arose without any
accompanying hope. He had the thought how excellent that would be,
if he could get to the coast, escape to France, Belgium, or
Holland, and in some obscure country place make his living as a
laborer. But he almost knew that it could not be done: his
appearance was too well marked, the police of the country too well
organised; and he would not put upon himself the indignity of
shaving off his beard. If he put on his working man clothes,
however, that might prove a slight disguise.</p>

<p>About half-past 7 he decided to try this, taking with him a
revolver to be used against himself at the first sign of any danger
of arrest. He went back to the trunk from which he had taken out
the revolver, took out his working-man clothes and boots, and,
after undressing put them on. He tied the old scarf round his neck,
put on the old cloth hat; and, looking now into the mirror, he
smiled, recognising his old self. He then put into his pocket one
of the three £5-pound notes, which he had laid on the mantelpiece
for Martha's use; and in one of the two old red handkerchiefs, he
tied up his watch and chain, two books, a few trinkets, and some
biscuits from a box which he generally kept in his room to eat out
of during the night. He ate some the biscuits. He then took his oak
stick, hung the little red bundle on it, shouldered it. He gave a
last look round the bedroom and stood a minute by his laboratory
table; he took the revolver from his jacket pocket, examined it,
replaced it; lastly, he put out the candles, and stepped from a
window on to the roof of the portico on the east side of the house.
The leap from there to the bottom was considerable, nor could he
climb down by one of the slender pillars which supported the
portico arches, for the roof projected somewhat; but he ventured
the leap and came down safely in a patch of fern and mimosa.</p>

<p>He sat some time where he had fallen, listening if anyone had
heard, for the kitchen was not far from there; but no sound save
the rain fell upon his ear. He went under the portico, stepped on
tip-toe northward along its east length, until he came to the
drawing-room windows, and between the curtains of one of them he
warily peeped. The candles were alight in the rooms, and there was
Martha asleep on a couch with her head on Rosie's shoulder, and
Rosie looking disconsolate with inflamed eyelids, and Bobbie
sitting near her. Hartwell looked at them sorrowfully, some
minutes, and then went away eastward through the forest,
shouldering the bundle in his working man clothes, as on that night
five years before when he tramped the Norwich Road, before he had
seen Drayton: but this time he went with his left arm in a sling,
and a limp in his walk: for after five years no one is the same
man, but the hand of God has been upon him, and has changed
him.</p>

<p>He went, however, with some buoyancy, glad that at least one
more night was left him to continue to live in.</p>

<p>This night was quite as dark as that night on the Norwich Road
five years gone, and much mare rainy, though the air was very
still, and, as it were, breathless, with that breathless stillness
which suggests the phrase "a dead calm." It was about 8 o'clock;
the forest was black, desolate, and dripping, and brought back to
Hartwell's mind the impression of one of the scenes in that
terrible long dream, in which the spirit of Drayton had seemed to
converse with him in these woods six months before. He passed
through the Round Point, with its well, and thence onward through
the pines by a narrow path, soft though uneven underfoot, which
mounted till he came to a ditch and a stile, and from that point
bent downward. The dullest yokel, if he were belated thereabouts,
must have been touched with some awe at this place, for few things
could be more benighted and awful at such an hour than that
congregation of pines with no leafage but at their tops, towering
among the fern in a sort of lank stand-at-ease like a host of
sentinels, and though no wind blew, there was still an everlasting
echo of music among them, if one listened reverently to hear it;
and anon a cone dropped and broke the stillness, as though one of
the strange great sentinels spat.</p>

<p>After 10 minutes, however, as Hartwell trudged on, the pines
became sparser, and he entered upon a fairly large open space,
surrounded by pines, on the outskirts of the estate; in the middle
of the space being a frog pond covered with moss, and not far from
the pond an old hut. Hartwell had hardly entered this open space,
when he was startled by the neigh of a horse; he stopped and
listened, for there was no question of seeing anything move more
than 6 yards from the eye; but the neigh was not repeated; and
hearing nothing, he continued on his way, which leaf him close by
the hut, between it and the frog-pond; but as he passed the hut, a
figure peeped out of it after him, ran softly after him, and,
peering into his face, put a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"James," said the voice of Julia, for it was she.</p>

<p>"Julia!" breathed Hartwell with a lifted hand.</p>

<p>At the 'same time Dulaunay came out of the hut and joined
them.</p>

<p>The Count had gone to bring Julia from Marston House as the last
possible means of stopping the suicide of Hartwell, and she had
promptly ordered a horse and come. On the way Dulaunay had told her
all, how that Drayton was dead, and Hartwell was not Drayton, but a
working man; how and why Hartwell had married Martha; how Drayton
had murdered Letty Barnes, and how Hartwell was reduced to suicide
by Oswald's terms, for Martha's sake; all Hartwell's motives had
been made clear to Julia; and the telling of all this, on
horseback, had left them no time to discuss what Julia should do
when they came to Corton. They had therefore dismounted on coming
to rough ground, tied their horses among the pines, and taken
shelter from the rain in the hut, while they spoke of what should
be done. Dulaunay was about to run to the pavilion to see if
Hartwell still lived, when Hartwell's' step was heard by them, and
Hartwell passed the door of the hut.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, James?" asked Julia.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;But how and why are you here?" asked Hartwell.</p>

<p>"The Count fetched me to stop you from suicide, James. Am I
able?"</p>

<p>"Julia, the Count does not know my reasons."</p>

<p>"He does, and he has told me, everything. I still call you
'James,' but I mean 'Robert&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah? the Count knew that. But you are getting wet, let me take
you back into the hut."</p>

<p>They turned to the hut, and stood at its door discussing what
could be done, Dulaunay in a hat borrowed from Marston House, Julia
looking tall and shadowy in a waterproof which she struck with her
whip, for she was high-strung, and her words came fast from her
lips, though with a perfectly business-like detachment; some
strings of her wet hair draped her face under her hard felt hat.
She led the council, and on her shoulders mainly the burden of the
situation seemed to rest; Hartwell only spoke when he was asked a
question; Julia, and the Count briskly exchanged their views.</p>

<p>"He will be caught not later than to-morrow," said Julia, "if he
attempts to escape like this."</p>

<p>"He should accept the terms of Oswald,"' said Dulaunay; "Martha
and Bobbie will not starve."</p>

<p>"Will you, James?" asked Julia, "and I undertake that your wife
and son shall be suitably provided for."</p>

<p>"You are kind," answered Hartwell, "but that must not be."</p>

<p>"What is far better," said Julia, "would be for him to say
openly that he is not Drayton, and snap his fingers at
everything."</p>

<p>"I divine that he does not do that," answered Dulaunay, "because
Martha and the rest would equally in that case be reduced to
poverty."</p>

<p>"If you are arrested, James, do you mean to do what the Count
stopped you in doing this afternoon," asked Julia.</p>

<p>"That might be wise," answered Hartwell.</p>

<p>Julia after a short silence said:</p>

<p>"If you will undertake, James, not to do that in case you are
arrested, but to declare yourself innocent and not Drayton, then I
make you the business offer to become your wife."</p>

<p>"You cannot become my wife," answered Hartwell, "for I am
married."</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand that that has been a merely formal marriage,"
said Julia; "I should not hesitate on that account to become your
wife in fact, though not in law, if that will induce you to keep
alive. I make you the offer, if you will undertake."</p>

<p>"You are kind. But Drayton's widow will at once be reduced to
poverty, the moment I say that I am not Drayton."</p>

<p>"But you would have me. And as my husband you would be
rich."</p>

<p>"I thought you were affianced?" said Hartwell, with some touch
of chronic irony in his tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, do not jest. I can manage that, then. Do you
undertake?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>The decision came sharply, whereat Julia, in a hurried movement,
stopped and laid her lips on Hartwell's hand, understanding the
terrible strength of the temptation which he had refused.</p>

<p>Then at once the busy discussion recommenced between her and
Dulaunay, a mere series of remarks revolving round a few ideas,
without reaching any end, while all were conscious of the
preciousness of the moments that were being wasted. Finally, the
Count said: "Oswald must be returning with the police or it may be,
has returned," and at this Hartwell, who was inwardly distressed,
and ashamed at this discussion of his hapless lot, and was eager to
be gone and alone in the dark, said: "I will go."</p>

<p>Julia now turned ghastly pale, and her womanly strength giving
way, she suddenly cried out, "Oh, is there no way out?" and began
to weep with her forehead on the Count's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Dulaunay, you are to blame!" murmured Hartwell, with some
bitterness. "I thought, my dear Julia, that I had caused you the
last distress which you were to owe to me," said Hartwell, "but
there was still this last. Let me be forgiven ."</p>

<p>He could say no more. Julia had now sat down on the stump of a
tree with a smooth top, which was used as a seat, in the middle of
the hut: she had soon dried up her tears, and with her chin on her
palm, sat gazing out. Hartwell stood awkward and burdened, not
knowing whether to go or stay, and for some minutes nothing was
said. Then, suddenly, Julia rose, and without, saying a word,
walked suddenly out of the hut, looking meditatively downward with
a bent head. She went toward the frog pond, and was soon lost to
the eyes of Hartwell and Dulaunay, for her walk quickened, and the
rainy murk of the night was so thickened, that all that the two men
could guess of her movements was that she was about, for some
reason, to make a circuit of the pond (she wished, in fact, to be
alone to carry out a thought which had risen in her mind). She was
absent five minutes. Neither of the men cared to follow her; and
Hartwell was again reproving Dulaunay for bringing her there, when
Julia was again with them, re-appearing even more suddenly than she
had gone, for she had come running a little, and was rather
breathless.</p>

<p>"I have it," she said, in a rapid speech, laying hold of
Hartwell's sleeve. "Emile, be prepared for a long ride to the
coast. James, this is what I think is the way out: to-night you, as
Drayton, commit suicide. I and Emile will take a hat and coat of
yours to the cliffs at the coast, and leave them there with a
confession of the murder and its discovery by Oswald, written by
you, in one of the pockets, to explain your suicide; I know a spot
near Happsburg, where the sea washes high up to the cliffs. Your
jacket and hat will be found there; you will be supposed to have
thrown yourself into the sea, and your body lost, as it may well be
just there; you, as Drayton, die; you will, as Drayton, is made.
Drayton's widow inherits; to-morrow morning you, as Hartwell, turn
up again in Birmingham, mix with your old acquaintances&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, adorable Julia!" murmured the Count, at Julia's ear.</p>

<p>"Now, that is feasible," said Hartwell, reflectively: "it never
occurred to me."</p>

<p>"Let us not lose time," said Julia: "has anyone got matches to
write the confession by? You, Emile, will hurry to the house, and
get the hat and jacket. I will await you here; and then we two will
ride to the coast. James will walk all night, making westward, and
take a train in the morning at some village station for Birmingham.
After a month or so in Birmingham among his old friends, he can
fearlessly emerge upon society, as Hartwell; and then, if he does
not still consider himself married, he can marry, or take whom he
pleases."</p>

<p>"You are ingenious," remarked Hartwell, at Julia's ear, in a
confidential tone of banter.</p>

<p>"I derive it from contact with Birmingham, James. But what about
matches?"</p>

<p>"See, here are some matches!" answered the Count, "also a
pencil, and the white half of a letter."</p>

<p>"That's splendid. Be careful, Emile, to bring a jacket with some
Drayton papers in it, so as to heap proof on proof. Better run now.
The only thing is the sick arm; that may identify Hartwell with
Drayton; could you manage without the sling, James?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is of no importance. But you are very ingenious."</p>

<p>"I do not desire any ironical flatteries, Robert," answered
Julia, ironically; "I might have been ingenious before, if you had
done me the honour to make me your confidante; but you chose to be
reserved. Now, Emile, you are to run."</p>

<p>"You can easily break open the study door to get the hat and
jacket, Count," said Hartwell.</p>

<p>The Count wrung Hartwell's hand, and crying: "Till we meet
again!" vanished into the darkness.</p>

<p>"The farther westward you are when morning breaks the better,
James," said Julia; "let us hurry with the confession."</p>

<p>Hartwell stood silent in the darkness, strange motions at work
in his breast, and then said: "You are in the right. I will
write."</p>

<p>Julia struck one of the matches, and handed him the paper and
pencil. Hartwell put the paper on the stump, and knelt at it to
write. Julia knelt beside him, and struck another match. Their
faces, beshone by the faint light, were close together. Hartwell
began to write in Drayton's hand. The match went out, and Julia
struck another.</p>

<p>Their silence was full of ecstasy, Hartwell was amazed at his
salvation, and foresaw a wonderful future; while Julia marvelled at
the happy clairvoyance of her own heart, for she knew that she was
out of the maze by the womanly instinct of a heart driven to bay
and at its last resort.</p>

<p>"Have I won you now, James?" she asked in a strained low voice,
"in actual truth, at last?"</p>

<p>"Let me write," said Hartwell with a certain mock dryness: "I am
an imposter."</p>

<p>The sound of water dripping from the eaves of the hut was heard,
the rushing sound of the rain, which was just then pouring hard,
the dark sound of a frog splashing in the pond, and no other sound
but these watery ones; a drop of water from the not very sound roof
fell upon Julia's cheek, another in the dry dust, another on
Hartwell's old greasy jacket; they were very alone there together,
and might have fancied themselves the only survivors of a flood
which was not vet over, and might last for ever. Their hearts beat,
poignantly. When the matches went out, Julia struck another, and
held it in a hand which rather shook.</p>

<p>"Oh, as to that," she said, "what Emile has told me has caused
me to know no more of you than I knew before, only more of your
history. I knew you were in proportion as I liked you, and two
weeks after that night when we first met in Garlot Park I knew you
inside out. Nothing could add to that knowledge. If Emile had
proved to me that you had committed crimes, I should still know of
you what I know, that you are a great mass of integrity."</p>

<p>"Well if ever I have meant well, and have suffered for doing it,
this is my consolation," said Hartwell, more to himself than to
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not blinded by any infatuation," said Julia presently:
"Emile or my brothers, for instance, would certainly condemn what
you have done in taking Drayton's place and all that, and I should
think the same as they, if you were not you: but what my heart
knows is that you could not have considered it wrong, since you did
it, and that your opinion of right and wrong must be worth very
much more than theirs or mine."</p>

<p>"That may be," said Hartwell: "but having once admitted that
anything can be wrong, as I do now reverently admit, a wrong does
not become right because one considers it right. I say that my
iniquities have been many, Julia."</p>

<p>"But still grand, dear, as your confession of them is grand, and
your suffering for them. It is all very well for shallow
people&mdash;No, don't be humble before me, I beg of you, or I
shall cry for pity. I heard, you know, of my brother Charlie's
escapade with you down here, and how you took it; he meant well,
but I told him after I heard it that it was merely upstart of him
in your case just when you were sacrificing everything, too, for
that poor woman; who was nothing to you, as if some quixote had
taken upon himself to cane Jephthah&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let that be forgotten," said Hartwell: "your brother did well,
nor was his action a discomfort to me, but rather brought me
something of the relief which lies in an expiation. But I cannot at
present look behind&mdash;It seems incredible, Julia, that such a
future as you present to me can still be mine."</p>

<p>"We have deserved it, James, if patience is anything," said
Julia, striking a match: "does it, seem, then, very bright to
you?"</p>

<p>"It seems bright enough!"</p>

<p>"What, to have me always with you?"</p>

<p>"Julia, no, let me write."</p>

<p>"Just think, I shall have a stool in your study, if I ever let
you go there; I shall cook; and make your slippers, and pamper you;
we shall live a year on an island; at midnight if you are haunted
by a ghost, it will be I; in the morning on opening your eyes the
first thing which you shall see will be my smile. I shall be with
you; you shall be mine&mdash;no more biology&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Julia, you talk. Julia, sweet name, graven in my
heart&mdash;-but, you see, I cannot write&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We have waited enough. We have lost life. It is time
now&mdash;I do so love you&mdash;" Julia whispered this, as it were
secretly, in a voice of passion; her face happened to touch
Hartwell's; a heavy drop leaked through the roof, splashed upon the
match, and put it out, for outside the deluge of water now washed
down lavishly with a loud noise, so that at several points the
leakage, more and more invading and menacing their little island of
dryness, was going on actively, dripping upon their hands, their
heads, the paper, the dust, and trickling down one side of Julia's
face; in that wet darkness their breasts caught fire; suddenly
their lips met by an impulse beyond the power of their wills; and
for some time only the noise of the storm of water was heard, and a
dark splash in the frog pond.</p>

<p>When at last Julia lighted another match, no more was said for a
long while; they breathed hard, their faces were pale with only
hall-smothered emotion. Hartwell wrote the confession of murder in
silence on the wet paper; and Julia, like a bondmaiden, struck
matches, from minute to minute to see to write.</p>

<h2><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>XXXIV. &mdash; HARTWELL
RE-EMERGES</h2>

<p class="first">Three pages of notes, taken down from the mouth of
my principal with regard to the history of Hartwell still remain to
me: but they do not seem to me to contain anything of great
importance. It need only be stated that the admirable Julia's plot
was duly carried out; the next day at noon, Hartwell, on stepping
to the platform at Birmingham from his train, was arrested as
Drayton for the affair of Letty Barnes: but he was once and for all
liberated, two hours afterwards, for the proofs which he had that
he was not Drayton were overwhelming; moreover, by the hour of his
liberation the jacket and hat of Drayton, who had "committed
suicide," were found at the coast: if Drayton was dead, and
Hartwell was alive, then Hartwell could hardly be Drayton.</p>

<p>Some time before the marriage of Hartwell and Julia, it was a
disputed point between two lawyers, to whom a supposed case had
been put by Julia, whether Hartwell was legally married to Martha.
Even if this had been so, it would not have prevented the union of
Hartwell and Julia; but the lawyers differed; for the law on the
point is far from clear. The fact that Martha supposed the man whom
she married to be another than he really was made the marriage
invalid in the opinion of one expert especially as it had never
been, as lawyers say "consummated," but from this view the other
expert differed. However the truth was, the death of Martha a month
before the marriage put an end to the importance of the question,
Martha's vitality, never strong, was reduced to a thread by her
night in the well, and the excellent woman passed quietly out of
life in a sleep.</p>

<p>She left all her recently gained wealth to Bobbie, the husband
of her daughter: whereupon Bobbie, who was soon let into the secret
by Julia and Dulaunay that his guardian was his father, insisted
upon making over the whole, with Rosie's consent, to Hartwell. So
that Hartwell in the end rightly possessed all that wealth of
Drayton which he had so wrongfully possessed; and Corton became the
favorite residence not only of Rosie and Bobbie, but of Julia and
Hartwell, and of their respective families.</p>

<p>As to Oswald, when he saw his dead "James" re-appear one night
before him at a dinner, calling himself Hartwell, with Julia on his
arm, the astonishment in the jaded brain of the poor Oswald may be
imagined. In spite of all the explanations that were heaped upon
him, he spent the rest of his life in an uneasy sense of
bewilderment at this matter. Hartwell gave him a considerable
annuity out of the widow Drayton's estate, and had him often with
him at Corton and elsewhere.</p>

<p>So much has been given me to write, and I have cast it into the
conventional "novel" form, with conversations, chapters with
titles, etc. If in this form the facts do not give that sense of
romance which properly belongs to fiction, I have at least tried to
effect this by the addition of fanciful details here and there, and
my failure, if I have failed, must be put down to the essential
difference of aspect between a chain of invented details and such
matters of fact as happen in our midst. Still, fact has always a
certain value of its own, nor are our characters mere cut-and-dried
photographs of living people, but to whatever extent they are
lifelike, the author is deserving of some of the credit, for though
they have been described to him, he has seen only one of them in
the flesh (the one called "Oswald"), a short time nine years ago,
together with a photograph of Hartwell (or rather not of Hartwell,
but of Captain Jenner, of the <i>Africa</i>), and a miniature of
the really beautiful Julia. Nor, on the whole, is it of much
importance, so long as an indulgent reader has been amused, and has
understood the moral significance of the man's fate which has been
sketched.</p>
