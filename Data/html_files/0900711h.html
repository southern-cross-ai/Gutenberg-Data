  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I. &mdash; THE FANTASTIC FRIENDS</a></h2>

  <p class="first">The inn called the Rising Sun had an exterior rather
  suggesting the title of the Setting Sun. It stood in a narrow triangle of
  garden, more grey than green, with broken-down hedges mingling with the
  melancholy reeds of a river; with a few dark and dank arbours, of which the
  roofs and the seats had alike collapsed; and a dingy dried-up fountain, with
  a weather-stained water-nymph and no water. The house itself seemed rather
  devoured by ivy than decorated with it; as if its old bones of brown brick
  were slowly broken by the dragon coils of that gigantic parasite. On the
  other side it looked on a lonely road leading across the hills down to a ford
  across the river; now largely disused since the building of a bridge lower
  down. Outside the door was a wooden bench and table, and above it a wooden
  sign, much darkened, with the gold of the sun's disc faded to a brown; and
  under the sign stood the inn-keeper, gazing gloomily up the road. His hair
  was black and flat, and his face, of a congested purple, had all the
  sombreness, if not all the beauty, of sunset.</p>

  <p>The only person in the place who exhibited any liveliness was the person
  who was leaving it. He was the first and last customer for many months; a
  solitary swallow who had conspicuously failed to make a summer; and the
  swallow was now flitting. He was a medical man on a holiday; young, and of an
  agreeable ugliness, with a humorous hatchet face and red hair; and the
  cat-like activity of his movements contrasted with the stagnant inertia of
  the inn by the ford. He was strapping up his own bag on the table under the
  sign; and neither his host, who stood a yard off, nor the single servant, who
  moved heavily and obscurely within, offered to help him; possibly through
  sulkiness, possibly merely through dreaminess and disuse.</p>

  <p>The long silence, idle or busy, was broken for the first time by two sharp
  and explosive sounds. The first was the abrupt bursting of the strap which
  the doctor was tightening round the bag on the table; and the second was the
  loud and cheerful "Damn!" which was his comment upon it.</p>

  <p>"Here's a pretty go," observed the medical gentleman, who went by the name
  of Garth; "I shall have to tie it up with something. Have you got a cord or a
  rope or anything?"</p>

  <p>The melancholy inn-keeper turned very slowly and went indoors, coming out
  presently with a length of dusty rope in a loop like a halter, probably for
  tethering a donkey or a calf.</p>

  <p>"That's all I've got," he said; "I'm pretty well at the end of my own
  tether anyhow."</p>

  <p>"You seem a bit depressed," observed Dr. Garth; "you probably want a
  tonic. Perhaps this medicine chest burst open to give you one."</p>

  <p>"Prussic acid is the kind of tonic I feel inclined for," answered the
  landlord of the Rising Sun.</p>

  <p>"I never recommend it," observed the doctor cheerfully. "It's very
  pleasant at the moment, no doubt; but I never feel I can guarantee a complete
  recovery afterwards. But you certainly seem down in the mouth; you didn't
  even brighten up when I indulged in such an eccentricity as paying my
  bill."</p>

  <p>"Much obliged to you, sir," observed the other gruffly, "but it would want
  a lot more bills to keep this rotten old show from going to pot. It was a
  good business once, when the right-of-way was open beyond the river, and
  everybody used this ford. But the last squire shut up the path somehow; and
  now everything goes by the new bridge a mile away. Nobody comes this way;
  and, saving your presence, I don't know why anybody should."</p>

  <p>"Well, they say the new squire is nearly bankrupt himself," observed Dr.
  Garth. "So history brings its revenges. Westermaine's his name, isn't it? I'm
  told there's a brother and sister living in the big house over there, with
  precious little to live on. I suppose the whole countryside's rather gone
  downhill. But you're wrong about nobody coming here," he added suddenly, "for
  there are two men coming over the hill now."</p>

  <p>The road ran across the valley at right angles to the river; beyond the
  ford the forgotten right-of-way could be traced more faintly up the slope to
  where the ruined gate that marked Westermaine Abbey stood dark against clouds
  of a pallor that was faintly lurid, as with a hint of storm. But on the other
  side of the valley the sky was clear; and the early afternoon seemed as
  bright and brisk as morning. And on this side, where the white road curved
  over the hill, two figures were advancing, which seemed, even when they were
  hardly more than dots in the distance, to be markedly dissimilar.</p>

  <p>As they came nearer to the inn, the contrast increased, and was
  accentuated by the very fact of their air of mutual familiarity; as if they
  were almost walking arm in arm. One was comparatively short and very sturdy;
  the other unusually tall and slender. They were both fair; but the blond hair
  of the shorter man was neatly parted and smoothly plastered down; while that
  of the other stood up in erratic wisps and tufts that looked fantastic. The
  shorter man had a full square face sharpened by a very pointed nose, and a
  pair of bright, bird-like eyes, that made it look like a small beak. There
  was something of the cock sparrow about him; and, indeed, he seemed more of a
  town bird than a country bird. His clothes were as neat and commonplace as a
  clerk's; and he carried a business-like little bag as if he was going up to
  the City; while his tall companion had bundled on his back a loose knapsack,
  and what was evidently the paraphernalia of a painter. He had a long,
  slightly cadaverous face, with absent-minded eyes; but the chin beneath
  jutted forward, almost as if it had formed an unconscious resolution of its
  own, of which the blank blue eyes were still unaware. They were both young;
  and they both walked without hats, probably through the heat of walking; for
  the one held a hard straw hat in his hand, and the other had a loose grey
  felt stuffed anyhow into his knapsack.</p>

  <p>They came to a halt before the inn; and the shorter man said jovially to
  his companion, "Here's a field for your efforts, anyhow."</p>

  <p>Then he called out with breezy civility to the inn-keeper, asking him to
  bring out two pots of ale; and when that gloomy character had disappeared
  into his gloomy place of entertainment, he turned to the doctor with the same
  radiant loquacity:</p>

  <p>"My friend's a painter," he explained, "but rather a special sort of
  painter. You might call him a house-painter; but he's not quite what most
  people mean by one. It may surprise you, sir, but he's an R.A., and not the
  stuffy sort that sometimes suggests, either. One of the first among the young
  geniuses, and exhibits at all their cranky galleries. But his whole aim and
  glory in life is to go about repainting inn-signs. There; you don't meet a
  genius with that little fancy every day. What's the name of this pub?"</p>

  <p>And he stood on tiptoe, craning and peering at the blackened sign with an
  extraordinary contained vivacity in his curiosity.</p>

  <p>"The Rising Sun," he commented, turning eagerly again to his silent
  friend. "That's what you would call an omen, after what you were saying this
  morning about reviving the real inns. My friend is very poetical; and he said
  it would make a sunrise all over England."</p>

  <p>"Well, they say the sun never sets on the British Empire," observed the
  doctor, with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"I don't feel it about the Empire so much," said the painter simply,
  breaking his silence like one spontaneously thinking aloud. "After all, one
  doesn't fancy an English inn on the top of Mount Everest, or somewhere on the
  Suez Canal. But one's life would be well spent in waking up the dead inns of
  England and making them English and Christian again. If I could do it, I
  would do nothing else till I die."</p>

  <p>"Of course you can do it," replied his travelling companion. "A picture by
  an artist like you, and hung outside a public-house, makes it fashionable for
  miles round."</p>

  <p>"Is it really true, then," inquired Dr. Garth, "that you employ all your
  serious powers on subjects like public-house signs?"</p>

  <p>"What finer subjects are there, even as subjects?" asked the painter; he
  was now evidently full of his favourite subject and he was one of those who
  are either abstractedly silent or ardently argumentative. "Is it more
  dignified to paint an Academy portrait of some snobbish mayor in a gold
  chain, or some swindling millionaire's wife in a diamond tiara, than to paint
  the heads of great English admirals, to be toasted in good ale? Is it better
  to paint some nepotistical old noodle wearing his George and Garter than to
  paint St. George himself in the very act of killing the Dragon? I've
  repainted six old signs of St. George and the Dragon, or even the Dragon
  without St. George; a sign called the Green Dragon is usually very suggestive
  to anybody with a little imagination; you can make him a sort of spirit and
  terror of tropical forests. Even a Blue Boar is suggestive; something
  nocturnal with stars like the Great Bear; like that dim monstrous boar that
  stood for chaos and old night in the Celtic mythology."</p>

  <p>And he reached for his pewter pot, and applied himself to it with
  absorption.</p>

  <p>"He's a poet as well as a painter, you know," explained the smaller man,
  still regarding his companion with an absurd air of proprietorship, as if he
  himself were the keeper and showman of some singular wild animal; "You've
  probably heard of the poems of Gabriel Gale, illustrated by himself? I can
  get you a copy if you are interested in these things. I'm his agent and
  business man; my name's Hurrel...James Hurrel. People laugh at us and call us
  the Heavenly Twins, because we're inseparable, and I never let him out of my
  sight. Have to look after him... eccentricities of genius, you know."</p>

  <p>The painter took his face off the pewter pot, a face fiery with
  controversy.</p>

  <p>"Genius oughtn't to be eccentric!" he cried in some excitement. "Genius
  ought to be centric. It ought to be in the core of the cosmos, not on the
  revolving edges. People seem to think it a compliment to accuse one of being
  an outsider, and to talk about the eccentricities of genius. What would they
  think, if I said I only wish to God I had the centricities of genius?"</p>

  <p>"I fear they would think it was the beer," replied Dr. Garth, "that had
  slightly confused your polysyllables. Well, it may be a romantic idea to
  revive the old signs, as you say. Romance is not much in my line."</p>

  <p>Mr. Hurrel, the agent, cut in sharply, and even eagerly. "But it isn't
  only a romantic idea," he explained; "it's a real, practical idea, too. I'm a
  business man, and you may believe me it's really a business proposition. Not
  only for us, but for the other people too...for the inn-keepers and the
  villagers and the squires, and everybody. Why, look at this broken-down
  ale-house they call the Rising Sun. If everyone would work together, they
  could have this empty hole humming like a hive in a year. If the squire would
  open the old road and let people visit the ruins, if he'd build a bridge here
  by the inn and hang out a sign painted by Gabriel Gale, you'd have all the
  cultivated sightseers in Europe stopping here for lunch."</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" cried the doctor. "It looks as if they were coming to lunch
  already. Really, our pessimistic friend inside talked as if this were a ruin
  in the desert; but I begin to believe it does a trade like the Savoy."</p>

  <p>They had all been standing with their backs to the road, looking at the
  dark tavern under discussion; but even before the doctor began to speak,
  Gabriel Gale, the painter and poet, had become in some odd fashion conscious
  of an addition to the company. Perhaps it was because the elongated shadows
  of a horse and two human figures had for some little time rested on the sunny
  road beside him. He turned his head over his shoulder, and remained staring
  at what he saw.</p>

  <p>A high dog-cart had drawn up on the other side of the road. The reins were
  in the gloved hands of a tall, dark young lady, clad in dark blue of the
  tailor-made type, neat but not particularly new. By her side was a man,
  perhaps ten years older than herself, but seeming in many ways much more, for
  his high-featured face was wasted as with sickness, and there was a great
  anxiety in his large grey eyes.</p>

  <p>In the momentary silence the clear voice of the girl came like an echo of
  the doctor's phrase, saying: "I am sure we can get some lunch here." She
  slipped lightly to the ground and stood by the horse's head, while her
  companion descended with a little more hesitation. He was dressed in light
  tweeds, which seemed somehow slightly incongruous with his invalid air, and
  he addressed Hurrel with a rather nervous smile.</p>

  <p>"I hope you won't regard me as an eavesdropper, sir; but you were not
  exactly speaking as if you were talking secrets."</p>

  <p>Hurrel, indeed, had been talking as if he were a cheap-jack dominating the
  noise of the fair; and he smiled and answered quite pleasantly:</p>

  <p>"I was only saying what anybody might about what a squire might do with a
  property like this. I don't in the least mind anybody listening who happens
  to be interested."</p>

  <p>"I happen to be a little interested," answered the man in tweeds,
  "because, as it happens, I am the squire if there are any squires
  nowadays."</p>

  <p>"I sincerely apologize," answered the agent, still smiling; "but, if you
  will play Haroun Alraschid..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm not at all offended," answered the other. "To tell the truth, I'm
  rather wondering whether you aren't quite right."</p>

  <p>Gabriel Gale had been looking at the girl in dark blue rather longer than
  was quite polite; but painters and absent-minded persons may sometimes be
  excused in such cases. His friend would probably have infuriated him by
  calling it one of the eccentricities of genius, but it might have been
  disputed whether his admiration was entirely eccentric. Lady Diana
  Westermaine would have made a most satisfactory sign for an inn...a bush
  worthy of the best wine...or might even have uplifted the lowly estate of an
  Academy picture, though it was long since her unfortunate family could have
  easily afforded one. She had hair of a curious dark brown, which in ordinary
  shades looked black, while the lights in it looked almost red; her dark
  eyebrows had a touch of temper both in the good and the bad sense; her eyes
  were even larger and greyer than her brother's, but less filled with mere
  worry and more with a more spiritual weariness. Gale had the sense that her
  soul was more hungry than her body. But he had also the thought that people
  are only hungry because they are healthy. He thought all this in the brief
  moments before he remembered his manners, and turned to consider the other
  group.</p>

  <p>When he had left off looking at her, she began looking at him, but with a
  somewhat cooler curiosity.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Mr. James Hurrel had been working wonders, not to say miracles.
  With something more than the tenacity of a tout, with something of the
  eloquence of the born diplomatist, he had already wound round the squire a
  web of suggestions and proposals and possibilities. There was really
  something about him of that imaginative business man of whom we hear so much
  and see so little. Affairs which a man like Westermaine could never normally
  have conceived as being settled except by long lawyers' letters extending
  over several months, seemed to be arranging themselves before him in several
  minutes. A new bridge of the most artistic woodwork seemed already to point
  across the river to the open road; a new and higher class of rents seemed
  already to be dotting the valley with artistic villages; and a new golden
  sign of the Rising Sun, with the signature of Gabriel Gale, already blazed
  above them, a symbol that the sun had risen indeed.</p>

  <p>Before they knew where they were the whole company had been bustled in the
  most friendly fashion through the inn, and set down to a luncheon that was
  really a committee round the table in the dreary garden beside the river.
  Hurrel was drawing plans on the wooden table and making calculations on
  pieces of paper, and reeling off figures and answering objections and growing
  every moment more restless and radiant. He had one piece of magic for making
  others believe...the fact that he evidently believed himself; and the squire,
  who had never met such a person before, had no weapons with which to fight
  him, even if it had been his interest to do so. Amid all this whirl Lady
  Diana looked across at Gale, who sat at the opposite corner of the table,
  somewhat detached and dreamy.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of it, Mr. Gale?" she said; but Mr. Gale's business
  adviser answered for him, as he answered for everybody and answered for
  everything.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's no good asking him about business," he cried boisterously. "He's
  only one of the assets; he brings in all the artistic people. He's a great
  painter; but we only want a painter to paint. Lord bless you, he won't mind
  my saying that; he never minds what I say, or what anybody says, for that
  matter. He doesn't answer a question for about half an hour, as a rule."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the painter answered the lady's question under the time
  specified; but all he said was, "I think we ought to consult the
  inn-keeper."</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well," cried the resilient Hurrel, leaping up. "I'll do that
  now, if you like. Back in a minute." And he disappeared again through the
  dark interior of the inn.</p>

  <p>"Our friend is very eager," said the squire, smiling; "but, after all,
  those are the sort of people who get things done. I mean practical
  things."</p>

  <p>The lady was again looking at the painter with a slightly constricted
  brow; she seemed to be almost sorry for him in his comparative eclipse; but
  he only smiled and said: "No, I'm no good at practical things."</p>

  <p>Almost as he spoke a noise like a sort of cry came through the inn from
  the road beyond, and Dr. Garth sprang to his feet and stood peering in at the
  door. The next moment Gale also seemed to rouse himself with a sort of sudden
  agitation; and the moment after that the others were all following the
  doctor, who had already started through the house. But when he came to the
  front door Gale turned for a moment, barring the exit with his tall figure,
  and said:</p>

  <p>"Don't let the lady come out."</p>

  <p>The squire had already seen over the painter's shoulder a horrible
  instantaneous image. It was the black figure of a man hanging from the
  signboard of the Rising Sun.</p>

  <p>It was only instantaneous; for the next moment Dr. Garth had cut him down,
  with the assistance of Hurrel, who had presumably uttered the first cry of
  alarm. The man over whom the doctor was bending was the unfortunate
  inn-keeper; and this was apparently the form in which he took his prussic
  acid.</p>

  <p>After being busy in silence for a few moments, the doctor gave a grunt of
  relief and said:</p>

  <p>"He's not dead; in fact he'll be all right presently." Then he said, with
  a sort of disgust: "Why the devil did I leave that rope there instead of
  tying up my bag like a tidy professional man? I forgot all about it in all
  this fuss. Well, Mr. Hurrel, the sun nearly rose too late for somebody."</p>

  <p>Hurrel and the doctor carried the unfortunate inn-keeper into his inn, the
  latter declaring that the would-be suicide would soon be in a position to be
  questioned, if questioning was necessary. Gale paced up and down outside in
  his aimless fashion, frequently frowning at the sign that had served as a
  gallows (and the table that had probably served as the proverbial stool
  kicked away) with a frown that seemed not only pained but puzzled.</p>

  <p>"This is a most distressing business," said the squire. "Of course I am a
  magistrate and all that, but I should hate to have to trouble the poor fellow
  with the police." At the sound of the word, Gabriel Gale swung round and said
  in a loud harsh voice:</p>

  <p>"Oh, I forgot the police. Of course, he must be locked up in a cell to
  show him that life is worth living after all, and the world a bright, happy
  place to live in."</p>

  <p>He laughed shortly and frowned heavily, and then after ruminating a
  moment, said with a certain abruptness:</p>

  <p>"Look here, I want to ask you a favour, which may seem an odd one. I want
  you to let me question this poor chap when he comes to. Give me ten minutes
  alone with him, and I will promise to cure him of suicidal mania better than
  a policeman could."</p>

  <p>"But why you especially?" asked the doctor, in some natural annoyance.</p>

  <p>"Because I am no good at practical things," answered Gale, "and you have
  got beyond practical things."</p>

  <p>There was another silence, and he spoke again with the same strange air of
  authority.</p>

  <p>"What you want is an unpractical man. That is what people always want in
  the last resort and the worst conditions. What can practical men do here?
  Waste their practical time in running after the poor fellow and cutting him
  down from one pub sign after another? Waste their practical lives watching
  him day and night, to see he doesn't get hold of a rope or a razor? Do you
  call that practical? You can only forbid him to die. Can you persuade him to
  live? Believe me, that is where we come in. A man must have his head in the
  clouds and his wits wool-gathering in fairyland, before he can do anything so
  practical as that."</p>

  <p>The group felt a growing bewilderment at his new attitude; it seemed to
  fill the stage in a strange fashion; nor was it lessened when he actually or
  apparently fulfilled his undertaking, coming out of the inn twenty minutes
  afterwards, and cheerfully announcing that the inn-keeper would not hang
  himself again. The next moment he had jumped on to the table under the sign
  with a large piece of chalk in his hand, and was making sketchy and slashing
  strokes of design on the brown face of the Rising Sun.</p>

  <p>Lady Diana was looking on at the operation with a dark and watchful face.
  She was of a type more intellectual than the others, and she recognized a
  real thread of thought running through all that seemed to them transcendental
  tomfoolery. She had understood the implied irony of his first reference to
  their host; the moral that had come before the frightful fable. After all,
  they had certainly been thinking of everything about the inn except the
  inn-keeper. She could see there was an intelligent case, and a practical
  example, of the occasions when the poet can be more useful than the
  policeman. But she was conscious also of something baffling about him above
  and beyond all this; of a disquiet in him with some deeper cause, and
  something in his eye that belied the new levity of his manner. His
  draughtsmanship, however, was proceeding in the most dashing and even
  dazzling fashion, when Lady Diana spoke:</p>

  <p>"I can't think how you can do it," she said, "on the very place where a
  man has hung himself like Judas."</p>

  <p>"It was the treason, not the despair of Judas, that was really bad," he
  answered. "I was just thinking of something like that for the picture. I
  prefer it to Apollo and all that, for a treatment of the sunrise. Look here,
  you have a big head blocked in with some shadows, in the centre," and he made
  some bold markings on the sun's disc. "His dark face hidden in his hands like
  that, but a burst of golden dawn behind like a glory. Red bars of level cloud
  and a red cock, just there. The greatest of sinners and of saints; his
  reproach the cock, and his halo the Rising Sun."</p>

  <p>The nameless shadow seemed to have fallen from him as he talked and
  worked; and by an almost symbolic coincidence the strong afternoon sun fell
  with a strange fullness and splendour upon him and his work, which shone out
  against a blackening background of clouds continually gathering and darkening
  on the stormy side of the valley, beyond the ford. Against those masses of
  sinister purple and indigo, his figure looked like that of some legendary
  craftsman clad in gold and painting the frescoes of a golden chapel. The
  impression increased as the head and halo of St. Peter grew under his hand;
  and the lady was of the sort not disinclined to dream herself back in some
  distant period, about which she did not know too much. She felt herself back
  among the sacred arts and crafts of the medieval world; which were all she
  knew of the medieval world.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, a shadow came between her and the sun in a shape that did
  not remind her of the medieval world. Mr. James Hurrel, the agent, his stiff
  hat a little on one side, jumped on to the same table on which the artist
  stood, and sat within two yards of him, with dangling legs, and somewhat
  aggressive cigar. "Always have to keep an eye on him, your ladyship, or he'd
  be giving 'em away," he called out, and somehow his voice and figure failed
  to fit in with the picture of pious and primitive craftsmanship.</p>

  <p>Diana Westermaine explained to herself lucidly that she had no sort of
  reason to be angry; but she was exceedingly angry. The conversation of the
  two had been of no particular intimacy; but its increase to three had a very
  practical and painful effect of intrusion. She could not imagine why the
  artist, who was a gentleman, should go about with such a little bounder as
  his business adviser; and she wanted to hear more about the picture of St.
  Peter, or something interesting. As the agent sat down he had audibly
  observed something about making room for a little one. If he, at that moment,
  had been suddenly suspended from the sign, it is doubtful if the lady would
  have cut him down.</p>

  <p>At this moment a much quieter voice said in her ear: "Excuse me, but might
  I have one word with you?"</p>

  <p>She turned and found Dr. Garth, with his bag in his hand, evidently about
  to resume his journey at last.</p>

  <p>"I'm going," he said, "and I feel I really ought to tell you something
  before I go."</p>

  <p>He drew her a little way up the road of his departure, and then turned
  with an abrupt and hurried air of farewell.</p>

  <p>"Doctors are often in delicate situations," he said, "and a troublesome
  sense of duty drives me to saying a rather delicate thing. I tell it to you
  and not your brother, because I think you have a long way the better nerve of
  the two. There is something I suspect about those two men who go about
  painting signs."</p>

  <p>From where they stood on the higher ground she could still see the sign
  itself shining with its new accretion of colours, and the tall, actively
  moving figure, shining also with sunlight, and from that distance altogether
  dwarfing the small and dingy figure near his feet. There returned on her
  still more strongly the vision of a true creator, making pure colours in the
  innocent morning of the world.</p>

  <p>"They are called the Heavenly Twins," went on the doctor, "because they
  are inseparable. Well, there are many kinds of couples that are inseparable,
  and many causes for their never separating. But there is one sort that
  specially concerns me, and I should be sorry to see mixed up with you."</p>

  <p>"I haven't the least idea what you mean," replied Lady Diana.</p>

  <p>"What about a lunatic and his keeper?" said the doctor, and walked on
  rapidly along the road, leaving her behind him.</p>

  <p>She had the sensation of furiously flinging a suggestion from her, from
  the top of a high tower to the bottom of an abyss, combined with the
  sensation that the tower was not high enough nor the abyss deep enough; she
  even had the novel sensation that there was something weak about her
  throwing. While the tower of her mind was still rocking with the effort, she
  was interrupted by her brother, who came hastily, and even excitedly, towards
  her.</p>

  <p>"I've just asked these gentlemen across to our place," he said, "to fix up
  this business better. And we'd better be starting, for there's a storm
  beating up, and even the ford sometimes gets pretty dicky. As it is, we shall
  have to cross two at a time in our own rotten old cart."</p>

  <p>It was in a sort of dream that she found herself again untethering the
  horse and again taking the reins. It was in a dream that she heard the voice
  that irritated her so much saying, "Heavenly Twins, you know, Heavenly Twins;
  we mustn't be parted"; and then the voice of the squire replying, "Oh, it'll
  only be for a minute, anyhow; she'll send Wilson back with the dog-cart at
  once. There's only room for two at a time, I'm afraid." They stood a little
  way back in the doorway of the inn as they talked, and Gabriel Gale had just
  stepped from the table and was standing nearer to the dog-cart.</p>

  <p>Then there surged up in her suddenly she knew not what movement of
  impatience or defiance; and she said in a matter-of-fact tone: "Are you
  coming first, Mr. Gale?"</p>

  <p>The face of the artist blanched as if he were blasted with white lightning
  in the sun-light. He gave one look over his shoulder and then leapt into the
  seat beside her, and the horse threw up his head and began to move towards
  the ford. The rain must have already fallen further upstream, for there was
  already the sensation of water flowing more deeply about the horse's legs;
  and, though they were only fording a river, she had a hazy sensation of
  crossing a Rubicon.</p>

  <p>Enoch Wilson, the groom, one of the small group left at Westermaine Abbey,
  died and was gathered to his fathers without having the faintest notion of
  the determining part which he played in the dark events of that night. And
  his private life, though, like that of other immortal spirits, of an intense
  interest, does not in any other point affect this story. It is enough to say
  that he was rather deaf, and, like many grooms, more sympathetic with the
  moods of horses than of men. Lady Diana sought him out in the stable, which
  stood far from the house and near the river, and told him to take the
  dog-cart back for the rest of the party. She spoke hurriedly and told him to
  hurry, because the rain would soon make the ford difficult; and her phrases,
  combined with his own bias, turned his mind chiefly to a consideration of the
  horse. He drove across under the gathering storm, and as he drew near the
  dark inn he heard high and excited voices. Mr. Hurrel was evidently hot upon
  his hobby or campaign. The groom got the impression that there was a quarrel;
  and took a few testy words from his master as meaning that he was not to be
  disturbed. So the careful Wilson took the horse back across the ford and back
  into the stable, congratulating himself on having saved the valuable
  quadruped from the worst inconveniences of what threatened to be a flood.
  Then he betook himself to his own occupations, leaving a trail of destiny
  behind him.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Diana Westermaine had left the stable and made her way across
  the grounds to rejoin the guest who had gone in front of her. As she went up
  through a lane of hollyhocks and tall plants, she saw the vast flying island
  or continent of rain cloud, with its volcanic hues and outline, come sailing
  slowly over the dark, wooded ridge that was the wall of the valley. There was
  already something faintly lurid about the twilight with which it covered the
  rich colours of the garden; but higher up the climbing path a strip of lawn
  was golden in a chance gleam of sunlight, and against it she saw the figure
  she had come to seek. She recognized it by the light-brown clothes that had
  looked like gold in the evening light, but there was something very
  extraordinary about the shape as distinct from the colour. He seemed to be
  waving his arms slowly like branches in a breeze, and she fancied the arms
  were unnaturally long. For an instant she had the ugly fancy that the figure
  was deformed; and yet the more unearthly fancy that it had no head. Then the
  nightmare turned into ordinary nonsense, for the man threw a sort of
  cartwheel and alighted on his feet laughing. He had actually been standing on
  his head, or rather on his hands.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," he said, "I often do that. It's a very good thing for a
  landscape-painter to see the landscape upside down. He sees things then as
  they really are; yes, and that's true in philosophy as well as art." He
  brooded and then explained explosively.</p>

  <p>"It's all very well to talk about being topsy-turvy. But when the angels
  hang head downwards, we know they come from above. It's only those that come
  from below that always have their noses in the air."</p>

  <p>Despite his hilarious manner, she approached him with a certain
  sub-conscious fear; which was not lessened when he lowered his voice and
  added: "Shall I tell you a secret?"</p>

  <p>At the same moment were heard overhead the first heavy movements of the
  thunder, through which his voice came, perhaps, with an accidental air as of
  loud whispering.</p>

  <p>"The world is upside down. We're all upside down. We're all flies crawling
  on a ceiling, and it's an everlasting mercy that we don't drop off."</p>

  <p>At that instant the twilight turned to a white blaze of lightning; and she
  was shocked to see that his face was quite serious.</p>

  <p>She said with a sort of irritation, "You do say such crazy things," and
  the next moment her voice was lost in the thronging echoes of the thunder,
  which seemed to shake everything, shouting the same word again and
  again...crazy, crazy, crazy. She had unconsciously given a word for the worst
  thought in her mind.</p>

  <p>As yet no rain had fallen on the garden slopes, though the noise of it was
  already troubling the river beyond. But even had it done so, she herself
  doubted if the man would have noticed it. Even in more normal moments he
  seemed to be one who singly pursued a solitary train of thought, and he was
  still talking, like a man talking to himself, about the rationality of
  topsy-turvydom.</p>

  <p>"We were talking about St. Peter," he said; "you remember that he was
  crucified upside down. I've often fancied his humility was rewarded by seeing
  in death the beautiful vision of his boyhood. He also saw the landscape as it
  really is: with the stars like flowers, and the clouds like hills, and all
  men hanging on the mercy of God."</p>

  <p>Then a heavy drop of rain fell on him; and the effect of it was
  indescribable. It seemed to sting him like a wasp and wake him out of a
  trance. He started and stared round; and then said in a new and more natural
  voice:</p>

  <p>"My God, where is Hurrel? What are the others doing? Aren't they here
  yet?"</p>

  <p>With an impulse not to be analysed, Diana dashed through the swaying
  plants to the top of a neighbouring hillock, and looked across the valley to
  the inn of the Rising Sun. And she saw flowing between them and that place a
  heavier and wider flood, which in that wild moment looked impassable, like
  the river of death.</p>

  <p>In a strange way it seemed to her a symbol of something greater than the
  mere grim realism that would have told her, now only too plainly, that she
  was left alone with a lunatic. Somehow it seemed that the lunacy itself was
  only a sort of abominable accident and obstacle between her and something
  that might have been beautiful and a satisfaction of the soul. Another dark
  river was flowing between her and her own fairyland.</p>

  <p>At the same moment Gabriel Gale gave a terrible cry; he also had seen afar
  off the sundering flood.</p>

  <p>"You were right, after all," he said. "You spoke of Judas, when I dared to
  speak of Peter. I have blasphemed and done the unpardonable sin. I am the
  traitor now." Then he added in lower and heavier tones: "Yes, I am the man
  who sold God."</p>

  <p>The girl's mind was growing clearer with the cold pain of reality. She had
  heard that maniacs sometimes accused themselves of the unpardonable sin.
  Something of her natural courage returned also, and she was ready to do
  anything, though she did not yet see very clearly what to do. As she was
  fighting for a solution, the question was settled for her in some degree by
  her companion himself, who started running down the slope.</p>

  <p>"I must get across again if I swim the river," he said. "I ought never to
  be away from Hurrel like this. I can never tell what will happen next."</p>

  <p>She followed his descent, and was rather surprised to see him deflect it
  to dart towards the stable. Before she knew where she was, he was struggling
  with the horse and dragging it out into the shafts; and she felt an
  irrational pleasure in the fact that he had the strength of a man, if it was
  the strength of a madman. But her own high spirit and self-respect had
  returned to her, and there rose in her a furious refusal to be a passive
  spectator of what might well be merely a suicide. After all, however mad he
  might be, the man was doing the right thing in trying to rejoin his medical
  attendant; and she would not have the last effort of his sanity frustrated by
  the antics of his disease.</p>

  <p>"I'll drive if we must," she said in a ringing tone. "He'll go better with
  me."</p>

  <p>The sun had set behind the hills opposite, and night was already deepening
  the darkness of the storm. As the rocking vehicle splashed up to the hub of
  its wheel in the eddying water, she could only faintly see the long
  water-rushes streaming with the stream, as if they were indeed the shades of
  the underworld hovering without hope beside the Styx. But she had no longer
  need to call it, merely in metaphor, a river of death. Death was driving hard
  against horse and cart, staggering the insecure foothold of the one, and
  swaying the human burden of the other; the thunder was about their ears, and
  on their dreadful path scarce any light but the lightning; and her human
  companion was a man uttering a monologue, of which she heard snatches, more
  shocking than the thunder. All the reason and realism in her told her that he
  might at any moment tear her in pieces. But underneath all such things there
  was something else contrary and incredible; something in the need and the
  companionship, and the courage and heroism she was showing; and it was too
  deep in her dizzy soul for her to know that it was exultation.</p>

  <p>The horse almost fell just as they came to the end of the ford, but Gale
  sprang from the cart and held it, standing knee-deep in water.</p>

  <p>In a lull in the noise of the storm she heard for the first time voices
  from the inn beside the river...voices high, and even shrill, as if the
  altercation that the groom had heard had risen steadily like the rise of the
  storm. Then there came what sounded like the crash of a falling chair. Gale
  dragged the horse to land with the energy of a demon, then dropped the
  bridle, and set off running towards the inn.</p>

  <p>Even as he did so a piercing shriek rose into the night from the doors of
  that solitary and sinister tavern by the river. It died away in a wailing
  echo along the reedy banks of the river itself, as if the reeds were indeed
  the lost spirits by the river of Hades; and the very thunder seemed to have
  stopped and held its breath to hear it. Then before the thunder moved again
  came one wide flash of lightning, as wide as an instantaneous daylight,
  picking out the most minute details of the distance, of the branches and
  twigs upon the wooded heights, and the clover in the flat fields beside the
  river. And with the same clarity she saw for an instant something incredible
  and abominable, and yet not wholly new or unfamiliar...something that
  returned in the waking world as a detested nightmare will return in sleep. It
  was the black figure of a man dangling from the painted gallows of the Rising
  Sun. But it was not the same man.</p>

  <p>Diana was convinced for the moment that she herself had gone mad. She
  could only imagine dully that her own mind had snapped under the strain, and
  that the dark objects she saw were but dancing dots upon a void. But one of
  those black dots had certainly seemed to be the figure of her own brother
  thus lassoed to the beam; and the other black dot, literally a dancing dot,
  had been the figure of that energetic business man, Mr. James Hurrel. For
  just then his energy was taking the form of dancing; he was hopping and
  capering with excitement in front of that frightful signboard.</p>

  <p>Darkness followed the flash, and a moment after she heard the great voice
  of Gale himself, a larger and louder voice than she had imagined him to
  possess, bellowing through the darkness and the stress of wind. "It's all
  right...he's quite safe now." Little as she understood of anything yet, she
  understood with a cold thrill that they had come just in time.</p>

  <p>She was still dazed when she staggered somehow through the din and
  distraction of the tempest into the inn parlour, with a smoky lamp on the
  table, and the three figures of that frustrated tragedy around it. The
  squire, her brother, in a sort of collapse of convalescence, sat or lay in an
  arm-chair with a stiff dose of brandy in front of him. Gabriel Gale was
  standing up, like one who had taken command, with a face as white but as hard
  as marble. He was speaking to the man named Hurrel in low level, and quiet
  tones, but with one finger pointed, as when a man speaks to a dog.</p>

  <p>"Go over there and sit by the window," he said. "You must keep quite
  quiet."</p>

  <p>The man obeyed, taking a seat at the other end of the room, and looked out
  of the window at the storm, without hearing or seeking to hear the talk of
  the others.</p>

  <p>"What does it all mean?" asked Diana at last. "I thought you...the truth
  is Dr. Garth gave me a hint that you were only a lunatic and his keeper."</p>

  <p>"And so we are, as you see," answered Gale; "but the keeper has behaved
  far worse than the lunatic."</p>

  <p>"But I thought you were the lunatic," she said with simplicity.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied; "I am the criminal."</p>

  <p>They had drawn nearer to the doorway, and their voices also were covered
  by the noise of the elements, so that they were almost as much alone as when
  they stood beyond the river. She remembered the earlier dialogue, and the
  violent and mysterious language he had used in it; and she said
  doubtfully:</p>

  <p>"You said things like that and worse over the other side, and that's what
  made me think so. I couldn't understand why you should say such wild things
  against yourself."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I do talk rather wildly," he said. "Perhaps you were not so
  wrong, after all, and I have a streak of sympathy with lunatics...and that's
  why I can manage them. Anyhow, I happen to be the only person who can manage
  this particular lunatic. It's a long story, and perhaps I shall tell it some
  day. This poor fellow once did me a great service, and I feel I can only
  repay it by looking after him and saving him from the infernal brutality of
  officials. You see, the truth is they say I have a talent for it...a sort of
  psychological imagination. I generally know what they're going to do or fancy
  next. I've known a lot of them, one way or another...religious maniacs who
  thought they were divine or damned, or what not, and revolutionary maniacs,
  who believed in dynamite or doing without clothes; or philosophical lunatics,
  of whom I could tell you some tall stories, too...men who behaved as if they
  lived in another world and under different stars, as I suppose they did. But
  of all the maniacs I have tried to manage, the maddest of all maniacs was the
  man of business."</p>

  <p>He smiled rather sourly, and then the tragedy returned to his face as he
  went on:</p>

  <p>"As for your other question, I may have talked wildly against myself, but
  I didn't talk worse than I deserve. Hadn't I deserted my post, like a
  traitor? Didn't I leave my wretched friend in the lurch, like a Judas? It's
  true he'd never broken out like this before; but I was sure in my heart there
  was one of his antics mixed up with that first affair of the inn-keeper. But
  the inn-keeper really was suicidal, and I fancy Hurrel only helped him, so to
  speak; but it was that that put the damnable notion in his head. I never
  dreamed he would break out against your brother, or I would...but why do I
  try to make excuses when there is no excuse? I followed my own will till it
  went within an inch of murder; and it's I who ought to be hanging from the
  wooden sign, if hanging weren't too good for me."</p>

  <p>"But why..." she began automatically, and then stopped dead, with the
  sense of a whole new world surging up against her.</p>

  <p>"Ah, why," he repeated with a changed voice; "but I think you know why. It
  is not your fault, but you know why. You know what has often made a sentinel
  leave his post. You know what brought Troilus out of Troy and perhaps Adam
  out of Eden. And I have neither the need nor the right to tell you."</p>

  <p>She stood looking out into the darkness, and her face wore a singular
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's the other story you promised to tell some day," she said.
  "Perhaps you will tell it me if we meet again." And she held out her hand in
  farewell.</p>

  <p>The sinister and fantastic partners had set off again next morning when
  the sun first shone upon the road; the storm had rolled away along the valley
  and the birds were singing after the rain. Stranger things yet were to happen
  before he and she should meet again; but for the moment she had a curious
  relapse into repose and contemplation. She reminded herself of the words
  about the world being upside down; and thought it had indeed turned upside
  down many times in that single night. And she could not analyse the sensation
  that, in spite of everything, it had come the right side up.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2">II. &mdash; THE YELLOW BIRD</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Five men had halted at the top of a hill overlooking a
  valley beautiful enough to be called a vision, but too neglected ever to have
  been vulgarised by being called a view. They were a sketching club on a
  walking tour; but when they had come to that place they did no more walking,
  and, strangely enough, very little sketching. It was as if they had come to
  some quiet end of the world; that corner of the earth seemed to have a
  curious effect on them, varying with their various personalities, but acting
  on all as something arresting and vaguely final. Yet the quality was as
  nameless as it was unique; there was nothing definably different from twenty
  other wooded valleys in those western shires upon the marches of Wales. Green
  slopes dived into a fringe of dark forests that looked black by comparison,
  but the grey columns of which were mirrored in the curving river like a long
  winding colonnade. Only a little way along, on one side of the river, the
  bank was cleared of timber, and formed a platform for old gardens and
  orchards, in the midst of which stood an old tall house, of a rich brown
  brick with blue shutters, and rather neglected creepers clinging to it, more
  like moss to a stone than like flowers to a flower-bed. The roof was flat,
  with a chimney near the centre of it, from which a thin thread of smoke was
  drawn up into the sky; the only sign that the house was not wholly deserted.
  Of the five men who looked down at the landscape, only one had any special
  reason for looking at the house.</p>

  <p>The eldest of the artists, a dark, active, ambitious man in spectacles,
  destined to be famous afterwards under the name of Luke Walton, was affected
  by the place in a curious fashion. It seemed to tease him like a fly or
  something elusive; he could not please himself with a point of view, but was
  perpetually shifting his camp-stool from place to place, crossing and
  recrossing the theatre of these events amid the jeers of his companions. The
  second, a heavy, fair-haired man named Hutton, stared at the scene in a
  somewhat bovine fashion, made a few lines on a sketching block, and then
  announced in a loud voice that it was a good place for a picnic, and that he
  was going to have his lunch. The third painter agreed with him; but as he was
  said to be a poet as well as a painter, he was expected to show a certain
  fervour for any opportunities of avoiding work. Indeed, this particular
  artist, whose name was Gabriel Gale, did not seem disposed even to look at
  the landscape, far less to paint it; but after taking a bite out of a ham
  sandwich, and a swig at somebody else's flask of claret, incontinently lay
  down on his back under a tree and stared up at the twilight of twinkling
  leaves; some believing him to be asleep, while others more generously
  supposed him to be composing poetry. The fourth, a smaller and more alert man
  named Garth, could only be regarded as an honorary member of the artistic
  group; for he was more interested in science than in art, and carried not a
  paint-box but a camera. Nevertheless, he was, not without an intelligent
  appreciation of scenery, and he was in the act of fixing up his photographic
  apparatus so that it covered the angle of the river where stood the neglected
  garden and the distant house. And at that moment the fifth man, who had not
  yet moved or spoken, made so abrupt and arresting a gesture that one might
  say that he struck up the camera, like a gun pointed to kill.</p>

  <p>"Don't," he said; "it's bad enough when they try to paint it."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked Garth. "Don't you like that house?"</p>

  <p>"I like it too much," said the other, "or rather, I love it too much to
  like it at all."</p>

  <p>The fifth man who spoke was the youngest of the party, but he had already
  at least some local success and celebrity; partly because he had devoted his
  talent to the landscape and legends of that countryside, and partly because
  he came of a family of small squires whose name was historic in those hills.
  He was tall, with dark-brown hair and a long brown face, with a high-bridged
  nose that looked rather distinguished than handsome; and there was a
  permanent cloud of consideration on his brow that made him seem much older
  than his years. He alone of all these men had made no gesture, either of
  labour or relaxation, on coming to the crest of the hill. While Walton went
  to and fro, and Hutton started cheerfully on his meal, and Gale flung himself
  on the couch of leaves to look up into the tree-tops, this man had stood like
  a statue looking across the valley to the house, and it was only when Garth
  pointed his camera that he had even lifted a hand.</p>

  <p>Garth turned on him a humorous face, in spite of its hard angular
  features; for the little scientist was a man of admirable good temper.</p>

  <p>"I suppose there's a story about it," he said; "you look as if you were in
  quite a confidential mood. If you like to tell me, I assure you I can keep a
  secret. I'm a medical man and have to keep secrets, especially those of the
  insane. That ought to encourage you."</p>

  <p>The younger man, whose name was John Mallow, continued to gaze moodily
  across the valley, but there was something about him that suggested that the
  other had guessed right, and he was about to speak.</p>

  <p>"Don't bother about the others," said Garth, "they can't hear; they're too
  busy doing nothing. Hutton," he called out in much more strident tones,
  "Gale, are you fellows listening?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I'm listening to the birds," came the half-buried voice of Gale out
  of his leafy lair.</p>

  <p>"Hutton's asleep," observed Garth with satisfaction. "No wonder, after all
  that lunch. Are you asleep, Gale?"</p>

  <p>"Not asleep, but dreaming," answered the other. "If you look up long
  enough, there isn't any more up or down, but a sort of green, dizzy dream;
  with birds that might as well be fishes. They're just odd shapes of different
  colours against the green, brown and grey, and one of them looks quite
  yellow."</p>

  <p>"A yellow-hammer, I suppose," remarked Garth.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't look like a hammer," said Gale, sleepily; "not such an odd
  shape as all that."</p>

  <p>"Ass!" said Garth briefly. "Did you expect it to look like an auctioneer's
  hammer? You poets who are so strong about Nature are generally weak in
  natural history. Well, Mallow," he added, turning to his companion, "you've
  nothing to fear from them, if you like to talk in an ordinary voice. What
  about this house of yours?"</p>

  <p>"It's not mine," said Mallow. "As a matter of fact, it belongs to an old
  friend of my mother's, a Mrs. Verney, a widow. The place has very much run to
  seed now, as you see, for the Verneys have got poorer and poorer, and don't
  know what to do next, which is the beginning of the trouble. But I have
  passed happier times there than I shall probably ever have again."</p>

  <p>"Was Mrs. Verney so enchanting a character?" asked his friend softly; "or
  may I take the liberty of supposing there was a rising generation?"</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately for me, it is a very rising generation," replied Mallow.
  "It rises in a sort of small revolution; and it rises rather above my head."
  Then, after a silence, he said somewhat abruptly, "Do you believe in lady
  doctors?"</p>

  <p>"I don't believe in any doctors," answered Garth. "I'm one myself."</p>

  <p>"Well, it isn't exactly lady doctors, I believe, but it's something of
  that sort," went on Mallow; "study of psychological science, and so on. Laura
  has got it very badly, and is helping some Russian psychologist or
  other."</p>

  <p>"Your narrative style is a little sketchy," remarked Dr. Garth, "but I
  suppose I may infer that Laura is a daughter of Mrs. Verney, and also that
  Laura has some logical connexion with the happy days that will not
  return."</p>

  <p>"Suppose it all, and have done with it," replied the young man. "You know
  what I mean; but the real point is this. Laura has all the new ideas, and has
  persuaded her mother to come down off the high horse of genteel poverty in
  all sorts of ways. I don't say she's not right in that; but as it works out
  there are some curious complications. For one thing, Laura not only earns her
  own living but earns it in the laboratory of this mysterious Muscovite; and
  for another, she has bounced her mother into taking a paying guest. And the
  paying guest is the mysterious Muscovite again, who wants a quiet rest in the
  country."</p>

  <p>"And I suppose, I may take it," said the doctor, "that you feel there is a
  little too much of the Muscovite in your young life?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, he moved into the house late last night," continued
  Mallow, "and I suppose that's really why I drifted in this direction this
  morning, trailing you all at my heels. I said it was a beautiful place, and
  so it is; but I don't want to paint it, and I don't even want to visit it;
  but all the same, I had a vague sort of feeling I should like to be somewhere
  near."</p>

  <p>"And, as you couldn't get rid of us, you brought us along," said Garth
  with a smile. "Well, I think I can understand all that. Do you know anything
  about this Russian professor?"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing whatever against him," answered the other. "He is a very
  famous man both in science and politics. He escaped from a Siberian prison in
  the old days, by blowing up the wall with a bomb of his own construction;
  it's quite an exciting story, and he must at least be a man of courage. He
  has written a great book called <i>The Psychology of Liberty,</i> I believe;
  and Laura is very keen on his views. It's rather an indescribable thing
  altogether; she and I are very fond of each other, and I don't think she
  mistakes me for a fool, and I don't think I am a fool. But whenever we have
  met lately it has been literally like a meeting on a high road, when two
  people are going opposite ways. And I think I know what it is; she is always
  going outwards, and I am always going inwards. The more I see of the world,
  and the more men I meet or books I read or questions I answer, the more I
  come back with increased conviction to those places where I was born or
  played as a boy, narrowing my circles like a bird going back to a nest. That
  seems to me the end of all travel, and especially of the widest travel...to
  get home. But she has another idea in her mind. It's not only that she says
  that old brown brick house is like a prison, or that the hills are like walls
  shutting her in; I dare say things do get pretty dull in such a place.
  There's a theory in it, too, which I suppose she's got from her psychological
  friend. She says that even in her own valley, and in her own garden, the
  trees only grow because they radiate outwards, which is only the Latin for
  branching. She says the very word 'radiant' shows it is the secret of
  happiness. There is something in it, I suppose; but I radiate inwards, so to
  speak; that is why I paint all my pictures of this little corner of the
  world. If I could only paint this valley, I might go on to paint that garden;
  and, if only I could paint that garden, I might be worthy to paint the
  creeper under her window."</p>

  <p>The sleeping Hutton awoke with an uproarious yawn, and lifting himself
  from his bed of leaves, wandered away to where the more industrious Walton
  had at last settled down to work on the other side of the hill. But the poet
  Gale still lay gazing at his topsy-turvydom of tree-tops. And the only reply
  he would make to a further challenge from Garth was to say heavily. "They've
  driven the yellow one away."</p>

  <p>"Who have driven what away?" demanded Mallow, rather irritably.</p>

  <p>"The other birds attacked the yellow one and drove it away," said the
  poet.</p>

  <p>"Regarded it as an undesirable alien, no doubt," said Garth.</p>

  <p>"The Yellow Peril," said Gale, and relapsed into his dreams.</p>

  <p>Mallow had already resumed his monologue:</p>

  <p>"The name of this psychologist is Ivanhov, and he's said to be writing
  another great book in his country retreat; I believe she is acting as his
  secretary. It is to embody some mathematical theory about the elimination of
  limits and..."</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" cried Garth. "This moated grange of yours is actually coming to
  life. Somebody is actually beginning to open a window."</p>

  <p>"You haven't been looking at it as I have," answered Mallow quietly. "Just
  round the angle on the left there's a little window that's been open all the
  time. That belongs to the little sitting-room out of the spare bedroom. It
  used to be Laura's room, and still has a lot of her things in it; but I think
  they give it now to their guests."</p>

  <p>"Including, doubtless, their paying guest," observed Garth.</p>

  <p>"He's a queer sort of guest. I only hope he's a paying one," returned the
  other. "That big window where they just opened the shutters is at the end of
  the long library; all these windows belong to it. I expect they'll stick the
  philosopher in there if he wants to philosophise."</p>

  <p>"The philosopher seems to be philosophical about draughts," observed Dr.
  Garth; "he or somebody else has opened three more windows, and seems to be
  struggling with another."</p>

  <p>Even as he spoke the fifth window burst open, and even from where they
  stood they could see a creeper that had strayed across it snap and drop with
  the gesture. It had the look of the snapping of some green chain securing the
  house like a prison. It had almost the look of the breaking of the seal of a
  tomb.</p>

  <p>For Mallow, against all his prejudices, felt the presence and pressure of
  that revolutionary ideal which he recognized as his rival. All along the
  shattered faade of the old brown house the windows were opening one after
  another like the eyes of an Argus waking from his giant sleep. He was forced
  to admit to himself that he had never seen the place thus coming to life from
  within, as a plant unfolds itself. The last three windows were now open to
  the morning; the long room must already be full of light, to say nothing of
  air. Garth had spoken of a philosopher enduring draughts; but it seemed more
  as if a pagan priest had been turned into a temple of the winds. But there
  was more in that morning vision than the mere accident of a row of windows
  open when they were commonly closed. The same fancy about unfolding life
  seemed to fill the whole scene like a new atmosphere. It was as if a fresh
  air had streamed out of the windows instead of into them. The sun was already
  fairly high, but it came out of the morning mists above the house with
  something of the silent explosion of daybreak. The very shapes of the forest
  trees, spreading themselves like fans, seemed to repeat the original word
  "radiant", which he had thought of almost as a Latin pun. Sailing over his
  head, as if sent flying by a sort of centrifugal force, the clouds still
  carried into the height of noon the colours of sunrise. He felt all the fresh
  things that he feared coming at him by an irrepressible expansion. Everything
  seemed to enlarge itself. Even when his eye fell on a stunted gate-post
  standing alone in the old garden, he could fancy that it swelled as he stared
  at it.</p>

  <p>A sharp exclamation from his friend woke him from his unnatural day-dream,
  which might rather be called, by a contradiction, a white nightmare of
  light.</p>

  <p>"By blazes! he's found another window," cried the doctor; "a window in the
  roof."</p>

  <p>There was, indeed, the gleam of a skylight which caught the sun at an
  angle as it was forced upwards, and out of the opening emerged the moving
  figure of a man. Little could be seen of him at that distance, except that he
  was tall and slim and had yellow hair which looked like gold in the strong
  sun. He was dressed in some long, light-coloured garment, probably a
  dressing-gown, and he stretched his long limbs as if with the sleepy
  exultation of one arisen from sleep.</p>

  <p>"Look here!" said Mallow suddenly, an indescribable expression flashing
  across his face and vanishing; "I'm going to pay a call."</p>

  <p>"I rather thought you might," answered Garth. "Do you want to go
  alone?"</p>

  <p>As he spoke he looked round for the rest of the company, but Walton and
  Hutton were still chatting some distance away on the other side of the hill,
  and only Gale still lay in the shadow of the thick trees staring up at the
  birds, as if he had never stirred. Garth called to him by name, but it was
  only after a silence that Gale spoke. What he said was:</p>

  <p>"Were you ever an isosceles triangle?</p>

  <p>"Very seldom," replied Garth with restraint. "May I ask what the devil you
  are talking about?"</p>

  <p>"Only something I was thinking about," answered the poet, lifting himself
  on to one elbow. "I wondered whether it would be a cramping sort of thing to
  be surrounded by straight lines, and whether being in a circle would be any
  better. Did anybody ever live in a round prison?"</p>

  <p>"Where do you get these cracked notions?" inquired the doctor.</p>

  <p>"A little bird told me," Gale said gravely. "Oh, it's quite true."</p>

  <p>He had risen to his feet by this time, and came slowly forward to the brow
  of the hill, looking across at the house by the river. As he looked his
  dreamy blue eyes seemed to wake up, like the windows opening in the house he
  gazed at.</p>

  <p>"Another bird," he said softly, "like a sparrow on the house-tops. And
  that fits in with it exactly."</p>

  <p>There was some suggestion of truth in the phrase, for the strange figure
  was standing on the very edge of the roof, with space below him and his hands
  spread out almost as if he wished to fly. But the last sentence, and still
  more the strange manner in which it was spoken, puzzled the doctor
  completely.</p>

  <p>"Fits in with what?" he asked, rather sharply.</p>

  <p>"He's like that yellow bird," said Gale vaguely. "In fact, he is a yellow
  bird, with that hair and the sun on him. What did you say you thought it
  was...a yellow-hammer?"</p>

  <p>"Yellow-hammer yourself," retorted Garth; "you're quite as yellow as he
  is. In fact, with your long legs and straw-coloured hair, you're really
  rather like him."</p>

  <p>Mallow, in his more mystical mood, looked strangely from one to the other,
  for indeed there was a certain vague similarity between the two tall,
  fair-haired figures, the one on the house and the other on the hill.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am rather like him," said Gale quietly. "Perhaps I'm just
  sufficiently like him to learn not to be like him, so to speak. We may both
  be birds of a feather, the yellow feather; but we don't flock together,
  because he likes to flock by himself. And as to being a hammer, yellow or
  otherwise, well, that also is an allegory."</p>

  <p>"I decline to make head or tail of your allegories," said Dr. Garth
  shortly.</p>

  <p>"I used to want a hammer to smash things with," continued Gale; "but I've
  learnt to do something else with a hammer, which is what a hammer is meant
  for; and every now and then I manage to do it."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" inquired the doctor.</p>

  <p>"I can hit the right nail on the head," answered the poet.</p>

  <p>It was not, in fact, until later in the day that Mallow paid his call at
  Mrs. Verney's house. Mrs. Verney was going up to the neighbouring village for
  the afternoon; and Mallow had more than one motive for making his attack when
  the stranger was alone with his secretary. He had a general idea of using his
  friends to detach or detain the stranger while he himself sought for
  explanation from the secretary; so he dragged Garth and Gale along with him
  to Mrs. Verney's drawing-room; or rather he would have done so if Gale had
  been an easy person to drag successfully anywhere. But Gale had a tendency to
  get detached from any such group, and was always being left behind. Large as
  he was, he had a way of getting mislaid. His friends forgot him, as they had
  almost forgotten him when he was lying under the tree. It was not that he was
  unsociable; on the contrary, he was very fond of his friends and very fond of
  his opinions, and always delighted to detail the latter to the former.
  Strangers would have said that he was very fond of the sound of his own
  voice, but friends who were fond of him knew better. They knew that he had
  hardly ever heard his own voice, in the sense of listening to it. What made
  his movements incalculable was that his thinking or talking would start from
  any small thing that seemed to him a large thing. What are to most men
  impressions, or half impressions, were to him incidents; and the chief
  incidents of the day. Many imaginative people know what is meant by saying
  that certain empty rooms or open doors are suggestive; but he always acted on
  the suggestion. Most of them understand that there can be something vaguely
  inviting about a gap in a garden hedge, or the abrupt angle of a path; but he
  always accepted the invitation. The shape of a hill, or the corner of a
  house, checked him like a challenge. He wrestled with it seriously till it
  had given up something of its secret, till he could put something like a name
  to his nameless fancy; and these things were the active adventures of his
  life. Hence it was that he would sometimes follow one train of thought for
  hours, as steadily as a bird winging its way homewards. But it might start
  anywhere; and hence, in his actual movements, he looked more like a floating
  tuft of thistledown caught upon any thorn.</p>

  <p>On this occasion his friends lost him, or left him behind, as they turned
  the corner of the house just after passing an old-fashioned bow-window
  looking out on the garden. Inside the window stood a small round table on
  which was a bowl of goldfish; and Gale stopped abruptly and stared at it as
  if he had never seen such a thing before. He had often maintained that the
  main object of a man's life was to see a thing as if he had never seen it
  before. But in this case the twilight of the little empty room, touched here
  and there with the late afternoon sunlight, seemed somehow a subtle but
  suitable background for the thing that he saw. The heart of a dark green
  sphere was alive with little living flames.</p>

  <p>"Why the devil do they call them goldfish?" he asked almost irritably.
  "They're a much more gorgeous colour than gold; I've never seen it anywhere
  except in very rare red clouds in a sunset. Gold suggests yellow, and not the
  best yellow either; not half so good as the clear lemon yellow of that bird I
  saw today. They're more like copper than gold. And copper is twenty times
  finer than gold. Why isn't copper the most precious metal, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>He paused a moment and then said reflectively:</p>

  <p>"Would it do, I wonder, when one changed a cheque into gold, to give a man
  coppers instead, and explain that they have more of the rich tones of
  sunset?"</p>

  <p>His inquiry remained unanswered, for he made it to the empty air. His
  companions were deficient in his sense of the importance of goldfish, and had
  gone on impatiently to the main entrance of the house, leaving him lingering
  by the bowl near the bow-window. He continued to look at it for a
  considerable time, and when at last he turned away, it was not to follow his
  friends, but to pace the paths of the garden in the deepening and darkening
  twilight, revolving in his mind some occult romance beginning with a bowl of
  fish.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, his more practical friends, pursuing the main purpose of the
  story, had penetrated into the house and found at least some members of the
  household. There had been many things in the garden or the gateway over which
  Mallow also might have been disposed to linger if his mood had been merely
  sentimental; an old swing standing by the corner of the orchard, the angle of
  a faded tennis lawn, the fork of a pear-tree, all of which had stories
  attached to them. But he was possessed of a passionate curiosity far too
  practical for sentiment of the merely reminiscent sort; he was resolved to
  run to earth the mystery of the new man in the old house. He felt that a
  change had come over everything with the man's mere presence; and wished to
  know how far that change had gone. He half expected to see those familiar
  rooms swept bare, or filled with strange furniture where the stranger had
  passed.</p>

  <p>Accident, indeed, gave to their passage through those empty rooms an air
  of pursuit, as if something were escaping. For, as they passed from an outer
  room into the long library, the stranger, who was at the other end by the
  window, emphasized his restless love of the open air by putting one long leg
  over the low window-sill and stepping out on to the lawn. He had evidently,
  however, no real desire to avoid them, for he stood there smiling in the
  sunlight, and uttered some greeting very pleasantly with a slight foreign
  accent. He was still wearing the long lemon-coloured dressing-gown which,
  along with his yellow hair, had suggested the comparison of a yellow bird.
  Under the yellow hair his brow was broad but not high, and the nose was not
  only long and straight, but came down in a single line from the forehead in
  the manner that may be seen on many Greek coins and carvings, but which has
  an unnatural and even sinister symmetry when seen in real life. There was
  nothing else eccentric or exuberant about him; his manners were casual, but
  not ungraceful; and nothing contradicted the sunny ease of his situation and
  demeanour except, perhaps, a slightly strained look in the eyes, which were
  eager and prominent. Until his acquaintances grew accustomed to it, as a
  fixed involuntary feature of his face, they occasionally had a sort of shock
  when catching his quiet face in shadow and realizing that the round eyes were
  standing out of his head.</p>

  <p>The first thing the eyes seemed to encounter was Dr. Garth's hand-camera;
  and, as soon as introductions and salutations had passed, he plunged into
  talk about photography. He prophesied its extension at the expense of
  painting, and brushed aside the objection, which even the doctor offered,
  that painting had the superiority in colour.</p>

  <p>"Colour-photography will soon be completed," he said hastily; "or rather,
  it will never be completed, but will always be improved. That is the point of
  science. You know more or less finally what can be done, well or ill, with a
  draughtsman's chalk or a sculptor's chisel. But with us the instruments
  themselves are always changing. That's the real triumph of a telescope...that
  it is telescopic."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mallow grimly, "I shall wait for one more change in the
  camera as a scientific instrument before I cut up my old easel for
  firewood."</p>

  <p>"What change is that?" asked the Russian with a kind of eagerness.</p>

  <p>"I shall wait till one of those tall cameras walks on its own three legs
  along a country lane to pick out the view it likes best."</p>

  <p>"Even something like that may be more possible than you think," replied
  the other. "In these days when a man has his eyes and ears at the end of long
  wires; his own nerves, so to speak, spread over a city in the form of
  telephones and telegraphs. A great modern city will become a great machine
  with its handle in the human hand. Thus only can a man become a giant."</p>

  <p>John Mallow looked at the man rather darkly for a moment, and then
  said:</p>

  <p>"If you are so very fond of a big modern city," he said, "why do you hide
  yourself in such a quiet little hole in the country?"</p>

  <p>For a flash the stranger's face seemed to wince and alter in the white
  sunlight; but the next instant he was still smiling, though he spoke a little
  more apologetically.</p>

  <p>"There is certainly more space" he answered. "I confess I like a lot of
  space. But even there the science of the city will ultimately provide its own
  remedy. The answer is in one word...aviation."</p>

  <p>Before the other could reply the speaker went on, his prominent eye
  kindling and his whole figure filling out with animation. He made a movement
  with his hand like a man throwing a stone into the air.</p>

  <p>"It's upwards the new extension will be," he cried. "That road is wide
  enough, and that window is always open. The new roads will stand up like
  towers. The new harbours will stand far out in that sea above our heads...a
  sea you can never find the end of. It would only be a beginning to conquer
  the planets and colonize the fixed stars."</p>

  <p>"I think," said Mallow, "that you will have conquered the remotest star
  before you really conquer this one old corner of the earth. It has a magic of
  its own which I think will outlast all such conjuring tricks. This was the
  house of Merlin; and, though they say Merlin himself fell under a spell, it
  was not that of Marconi."</p>

  <p>"No," answered the stranger, still smiling. "We all know the spell under
  which Merlin fell."</p>

  <p>Mallow knew enough about Russian intellectuals not to be surprised at the
  wide knowledge of the poetry and culture of the West; but here it seemed the
  almost satiric symbol of a deeper familiarity, and a mocking whisper told him
  what might have chained this magician in that western valley.</p>

  <p>Laura Verney was coming across the garden towards them with some papers in
  her hand. She was of a red-haired, full-blooded type, handsome in a fashion
  which seemed to have a certain pagan exuberance till she came near enough to
  show the concentrated seriousness of her clear eyes; she might be called a
  pagan with the eyes of a puritan. She saluted her guests without any change
  of countenance, and handed the papers to the professor without any word of
  comment. Something in her automatic manner seemed to sting Mallow to a final
  impatience; and, picking up his hat from the window-sill, he called out in a
  loud and careless voice:</p>

  <p>"Laura, will you show me the way out of this garden? I've forgotten the
  way."</p>

  <p>It was some time afterwards, however, that he said any sort of final
  farewell to her, under the shadow of the outer wall, and near the ultimate
  gate of the garden. In the somewhat bitter intensity of his mood, he seemed
  rather to be exaggerating the finality of the farewell; not only touching
  herself, but all the things which he had always felt to be full of her
  presence.</p>

  <p>"You will pull down that old swing, I suppose?" he had said as they went
  through the garden, "and put up an electric steel swing that will take
  anybody in ten seconds to the moon."</p>

  <p>"I can't pull down the moon, anyhow," replied the girl, with a smile, "and
  I don't know that I want to."</p>

  <p>"That's rather reactionary of you," remarked Mallow. "The moon is a very
  extinct volcano, valuable only to old-fashioned romanticists. And I suppose
  you'll turn our old lawn-tennis lawn into a place where tennis can be played
  by machinery, by pressing buttons a hundred miles away. I'm not sure whether
  they've yet finished the plans for a pear-tree that grows pears by
  electricity."</p>

  <p>"But surely," she replied, looking a little troubled, "the world can go on
  without losing the things it seems to leave behind. And, after all, surely
  the world must go on; at least, it must go on growing. I think that's where
  you misunderstand. It isn't only going on; it's more like growing
  outwards.</p>

  <p>"It's expansion, that's the word; growing broader, always describing wider
  and wider circles; but that only means more self-fulfilment, and therefore
  serenity and peace; it means..."</p>

  <p>She stopped short, as if at a spoken answer, but it was only because the
  moon had flung a new shadow across her. It was from a figure standing on the
  wall. The moonshine made a halo of pale yellow round the head; and for a
  moment they thought it was the Russian, standing on the wall as he had stood
  on the roof. Then Mallow looked more closely at the face in shadow, and
  uttered, with some astonishment, the name of Gale.</p>

  <p>"You must get away from here at once," said the poet sharply; "everybody
  who can must get away from this house. There's no time to explain."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, he sprang from the wall and alighted beside them, and his
  friend, catching his face in a new light, saw that it was quite pale.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you?" he demanded. "Have you seen a ghost?"</p>

  <p>"The ghost of a fish," answered the poet; "three little grey ghosts of
  three little fishes. We must get away at once."</p>

  <p>Without turning his head again, he led the way up the rising ground beyond
  the garden towards the clump of trees where the party had first encamped.
  Both Mallow and the girl pursued him with questions; but to only one of them
  did he give any answer. When Laura insisted on knowing whether her mother had
  come home yet, he answered shortly, "No; thank God! I sent Garth off to stop
  her on the road from the village. She's all right, anyhow."</p>

  <p>But Laura Verney was a lady who could not be indefinitely dragged at the
  tail of a total stranger talking in a tone of authority; and by the time they
  came to the top of a hill, and the trees in whose shadow the poet had
  indulged in his meditations on birds, she halted and resolutely demanded his
  reasons.</p>

  <p>"I won't go a step farther," she said firmly, "till you've given me some
  sort of proofs."</p>

  <p>He turned with passion in his pale face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, proofs!" he cried; "I know the sort of proofs you want. The
  foot-prints of the remarkable boots. The bloody finger-print carefully
  compared with the one at Scotland Yard. The conveniently mislaid matchbox,
  and the ashes of the unique tobacco. Do you suppose I've never read any
  detective stories? Well, I haven't got any proofs...of that sort. I haven't
  got any proofs at all, in that sense. If I told you my reasons, you'd think
  them the most rambling nonsense in the world. You must either do as I tell
  you and thank me afterwards; or you must let me talk as I like, and as long
  as I like, and thank your God you've come as far as this towards safety."</p>

  <p>Mallow was looking at the poet in his quiet and intense fashion; and after
  a moment's pause, he said:</p>

  <p>"You'd better tell us your own reasons in your own way. I know you
  generally have pretty good ones, really."</p>

  <p>Gale's eyes wandered from the staring face of the girl to that of his
  friend, and then to the drift of dead leaves under the tree where he had once
  rested.</p>

  <p>"I was lying there looking up at the sky, or, rather, the tree-tops," he
  said slowly. "I didn't hear what the others were talking about, because I was
  listening to the birds and looking at them. You know what happens when you go
  on staring at something like that; it turns into a sort of pattern like a
  wall-paper; and this was a quiet pattern of green and grey and brown. It
  seemed as if the whole world was that pattern; as if God had never made
  anything except a world of birds; of tree-tops hung in space."</p>

  <p>Laura made a half-protest that sounded like a laugh, but Mallow said
  steadily: "Go on!"</p>

  <p>"And then I slowly became conscious that there was a spot of yellow in the
  pattern. I slowly realized that it was another bird, and then what sort of
  bird. Somebody said it must be a yellow-hammer; but, little as I knew about
  it, I knew better than that. It was a canary."</p>

  <p>The girl, who had already turned away, looked back at him with her first
  flash of interest.</p>

  <p>"I wondered vaguely how a canary would get on in the world of birds, and
  how it had got there. I didn't think of any human being in particular. Only I
  saw in a sort of vision, somewhere against the morning sky, a window standing
  open, and the door of a cage standing open. Then I saw that all the brown
  birds were trying to kill the yellow one, and that started my thoughts off as
  it might anybody's. Is it always kind to set a bird at liberty? What exactly
  is liberty? First and foremost, surely, it is the power of a thing to be
  itself. In some ways the yellow bird was free in the cage. It was free to be
  alone. It was free to sing. In the forest its feathers would be torn to
  pieces and its voice choked for ever. Then I began to think that being
  oneself, which is liberty, is itself limitation. We are limited by our brains
  and bodies; and if we break out, we cease to be ourselves, and, perhaps, to
  be anything. That was when I asked you whether an isosceles triangle felt
  itself in prison, and if there were such a thing as a round prison. We shall
  hear more of the round prison before this story is over.</p>

  <p>"Then I saw the man on the roof, with his hands spread like wings to the
  sky. I knew nothing of him; but I knew on the instant that he was the man who
  had given a bird its freedom at any risk. As we went down the hill I heard a
  little more about him; how he had escaped by blowing up his prison; and I
  felt that one fact had filled all his life with a philosophy of emancipation
  and escape. Always at the back of his mind, I was certain, was that one
  bursting moment when he saw white daylight shining through the shattered
  wall. I knew why he let birds out of cages and why he had written a book on
  the psychology of liberty. Then I stopped outside a window to stare at those
  gorgeous goldfish, merely because I had a fancy for such things; they
  coloured my thoughts, so to speak, with a sort of orange or scarlet, for long
  afterwards. And long afterwards I was again passing that window; and I found
  their colours were faded and their positions changed. At that time it was
  already dark, with a rising moon; and what forms I could see scattered in the
  shadow seemed almost grey, and even outlined in lines of grey light, which
  might have been moonlight, but I think was the corpse-light of
  phosphorescence. They lay scattered at random on the round table; and I saw
  by the faint glimmer that the glass bowl was broken. So I found my romance
  when I returned to it; for those fantastic fishes had been to me like the
  hieroglyphics of a message, which the fiery finger of God had thus written in
  red-hot gold. But when I looked again, the finger had written another lesson
  in letters of an awful and ashen silver. And what the new message said was:
  'The man is mad.'</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you think I am as mad as he; and I have told you that I am at
  once like him and unlike him. I am like him because I also can go on the wild
  journeys of such wild minds, and have a sympathy with his love of liberty. I
  am unlike him because, thank God, I can generally find my way home again. The
  lunatic is he who loses his way and cannot return. Now, almost before my
  eyes, this man had made the great stride from liberty to lunacy. The man who
  opened the bird-cage loved freedom; possibly too much; certainly very much.
  But the man who broke the bowl merely because he thought it a prison for the
  fish, when it was their only possible house of life...that man was already
  outside the world of reason, raging with a desire to be outside everything.
  In a most literal and living sense, he was out of his wits. And there was
  another thing revealed to me by the grey ghosts of the fishes. The rise of
  the insanity had been very rapid and steep. To send the bird into danger was
  only a disputable kindness, to fling the fish to death was a dance of raving
  destruction. What would he do next?</p>

  <p>"I have spoken of a round prison. After all, to any mind that can move
  parallel to a mood like this, there really is a round prison. The sky itself,
  studded with stars, the serene arch of what we call infinity..."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he staggered, clutched at the air, and fell all his great
  length on the grass. At the same moment Mallow was hurled against a tree, and
  the girl collapsed against him, clinging to him in a way which even in that
  blinding whirl, was an answer to many of his questionings. It was only when
  they had picked themselves up and pulled themselves together that they were
  fully conscious that the valley was still resounding with echoes of one
  hideous and rending uproar; or that the darkness had just shut down upon a
  blaze that blinded them like red lightning. For the instant that it lasted it
  was a standing glory, like a great sunrise. There rose to the surface of
  Mallow's memory only one word for it; the word radiant.</p>

  <p>Mallow found himself reflecting in a dull fashion that it was lighter than
  it might have been at that hour, because of a friendly flame that was licking
  itself in a lively fashion a few yards away. Then he saw that it was the
  smouldering ruin of the blue wooden gate-post at which he had gazed that
  morning, flung all the way through the air like a flaming thunderbolt. They
  had come just far enough from the house to be out of danger. Then he looked
  again at the blue-painted wood curling with golden flames, and for the first
  time began to tremble.</p>

  <p>The next moment he caught sight of the faces of his other friends, Walton
  and Hutton, pale in the flame as they hurried up the road from the remoter
  inn to which they had retired for the evening.</p>

  <p>"What was it?" Walton was calling out.</p>

  <p>"An explosion," said Hutton rather hazily.</p>

  <p>"An expansion," replied Mallow, and mastered himself with the effort of a
  grim smile.</p>

  <p>By this time, more people were running out from remote cottages, and
  Gabriel Gale turned his face to something like a small crowd.</p>

  <p>"It was only the prison gun," he said, "the signal that a prisoner has
  escaped."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3">III. &mdash; THE SHADOW OF THE SHARK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It is notable that the late Mr. Sherlock Holmes, in the
  course of those inspiring investigations for which we can never be
  sufficiently grateful to their ingenious author, seems only twice to have
  ruled out an explanation as intrinsically impossible. And it is curious to
  notice that in both cases the distinguished author himself has since come to
  regard that impossible thing as possible, and even as positively true. In the
  first case the great detective declared that he never knew a crime committed
  by a flying creature. Since the development of aviation, and especially the
  development of German aviation, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, patriot and war
  historian, has seen a good many crimes committed by flying creatures. And in
  the other case the detective implied that no deed need be attributed to
  spirits or supernatural beings; in short, to any of the agencies to which Sir
  Arthur is now the most positive and even passionate witness. Presumably, in
  his present mood and philosophy, the Hound of the Baskervilles might well
  have been a really ghostly hound; at least, if the optimism which seems to go
  with spiritualism would permit him to believe in such a thing as a
  hell-hound. It may be worth while to note this coincidence, however, in
  telling a tale in which both these explanations necessarily played a part.
  The scientists were anxious to attribute it to aviation, and the
  spiritualists to attribute it to spirits; though it might be questioned
  whether either the spirit or the flying-man should be congratulated on his
  utility as an assassin.</p>

  <p>A mystery which may yet linger as a memory, but which was in its time a
  sensation, revolved round the death of a certain Sir Owen Cram, a wealthy
  eccentric, chiefly known as a patron of learning and the arts. And the
  peculiarity of the case was that he was found stabbed in the middle of a
  great stretch of yielding sand by the sea-shore, on which there was
  absolutely no trace of any foot-prints but his own. It was admitted that the
  wound could not have been self-inflicted; and it grew more and more difficult
  even to suggest how it could have been inflicted at all. Many theories were
  suggested, ranging, as we have said, from that of the enthusiasts for
  aviation to that of the enthusiasts for psychical research; it being
  evidently regarded as a feather in the cap either of science or spiritualism
  to have effected so neat an operation. The true story of this strange
  business has never been told; it certainly contained elements which, if not
  supernatural, were at least supernormal. But to make it clear, we must go
  back to the scene with which it began; the scene on the lawn of Sir Owen's
  seaside residence, where the old gentleman acted as a sort of affable umpire
  in the disputes of the young students who were his favourite company; the
  scene which led up to the singular silence and isolation, and ultimately to
  the rather eccentric exit of Mr. Amos Boon.</p>

  <p>Mr. Amos Boon had been a missionary, and still dressed like one; at any
  rate, he dressed like nothing else. His sturdy, full-bearded figure carried a
  broad-brimmed hat combined with a frock-coat; which gave him an air at once
  outlandish and dowdy. Though he was no longer a missionary, he was still a
  traveller. His face was brown and his long beard was black; there was a
  furrow of thought in his brow and a rather strained look in his eyes, one of
  which sometimes looked a little larger than the other, giving a sinister
  touch to what was in some ways so commonplace. He had ceased to be a
  missionary through what he himself would have called the broadening of his
  mind. Some said there had been a broadening of his morals as well as of his
  mind; and that the South Sea Islands, where he had lived, had seen not a
  little of such ethical emancipation. But this was possibly a malicious
  misrepresentation of his very human curiosity and sympathy in the matter of
  the customs of the savages; which to the ordinary prejudice was
  indistinguishable from a white man going <i>fantee.</i> Anyhow, travelling
  about alone with nothing but a big Bible, he had learned to study it
  minutely, first for oracles and commandments, and afterwards for errors and
  contradictions; for the Bible-smasher is only the Bible-worshipper turned
  upside down. He pursued the not very arduous task of proving that David and
  Saul did not on all occasions merit the Divine favour; and always concluded
  by roundly declaring that he preferred the Philistines. Boon and his
  Philistines were already a byword of some levity among the young men who, at
  that moment, were arguing and joking around him.</p>

  <p>At that moment Sir Owen Cram was playfully presiding over a dispute
  between two or three of his young friends about science and poetry. Sir Owen
  was a little restless man, with a large head, a bristly grey moustache, and a
  grey fan of hair like the crest of a cockatoo. There was something sprawling
  and splayfooted about his continuous movement which was compared by
  thoughtless youth to that of a crab; and it corresponded to a certain
  universal eagerness which was really ready to turn in all directions. He was
  a typical amateur, taking up hobby after hobby with equal inconsistency and
  intensity. He had impetuously left all his money to a museum of natural
  history, only to become immediately swallowed up in the single pursuit of
  landscape painting; and the groups around him largely represented the stages
  of his varied career. At the moment a young painter, who was also by way of
  being a poet, was defending some highly poetical notions against the smiling
  resistance of a rising doctor, whose hobby was biology. The data of agreement
  would have been difficult to find, and few save Sir Owen could have claimed
  any common basis of sympathy; but the important matter just then was the
  curious effect of the young men's controversy upon Mr. Boon.</p>

  <p>"The subject of flowers is hackneyed, but the flowers are not," the poet
  was insisting. "Tennyson was right about the flower in the crannied wall; but
  most people don't look at flowers in a wall, but only in a wall-paper. If you
  generalize them, they are dull, but if you simply see them they are always
  startling. If there's a special providence in a falling star, there's more in
  a rising star; and a live star at that."</p>

  <p>"Well, I can't see it," said the man of science, good-humouredly; he was a
  red-haired, keen-faced youth in pince-nez, by the name of Wilkes. "I'm afraid
  we fellows grow out of the way of seeing it like that. You see, a flower is
  only a growth like any other, with organs and all that; and its inside isn't
  any prettier or uglier than an animal's. An insect is much the same pattern
  of rings and radiations. I'm interested in it as I am in an octopus or any
  sea-beast you would think a monster."</p>

  <p>"But why should you put it that way round?" retorted the poet. "Why isn't
  it quite as logical the other way round? Why not say the octopus is as
  wonderful as the flower, instead of the flower as ordinary as the octopus?
  Why not say that crackens and cuttles and all the sea-monsters are themselves
  flowers; fearful and wonderful flowers in that terrible twilight garden of
  God. I do not doubt that God can be as fond of a shark as I am of a
  buttercup."</p>

  <p>"As to God, my dear Gale," began the other quietly, and then he seemed to
  change his form of words. "Well, I am only a man...nay, only a scientific
  man, which you may think lower than a sea-beast. And the only interest I have
  in a shark is to cut him up; always on the preliminary supposition that I
  have prevented him from cutting me up."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever met a shark?" asked Amos Boon, intervening suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Not in society," replied the poet with a certain polite discomposure,
  looking round with something like a flush under his fair hair; he was a long,
  loose-limbed man named Gabriel Gale, whose pictures were more widely known
  than his poems.</p>

  <p>"You've seen them in the tanks, I suppose," said Boon; "but I've seen them
  in the sea. I've seen them where they are lords of the sea, and worshipped by
  the people as great gods. I'd as soon worship those gods as any other."</p>

  <p>Gale the poet was silent, for his mind always moved in a sort of sympathy
  with merely imaginative pictures; and he instantly saw, as in a vision,
  boiling purple seas and plunging monsters. But another young man standing
  near him, who had hitherto been rather primly silent, cut in quietly; a
  theological student, named Simon, the deposit of some epoch of faith in Sir
  Owen's stratified past. He was a slim man with sleek, dark hair and darting,
  mobile eyes, in spite of his compressed lips. Whether in caution or contempt,
  he had left the attack on medical materialism to the poet, who was always
  ready to plunge into an endless argument with anybody. Now he intervened
  merely to say:</p>

  <p>"Do they only worship a shark? It seems rather a limited sort of
  religion."</p>

  <p>"Religion!" repeated Amos Boon, rudely; "what do you people know about
  religion? You pass the plate round, and when Sir Owen puts a penny in it, you
  put up a shed where a curate can talk to a congregation of maiden-aunts.
  These people have got something like a religion. They sacrifice things to
  it...their beasts, their babies, their lives. I reckon you'd turn green with
  fear if you'd ever so much as caught a glimpse of Religion. Oh, it's not just
  a fish in the sea; rather it's the sea round a fish. The sea is the blue
  cloud he moves in, or the green veil or curtain hung about him, the skirts of
  which trail with thunder."</p>

  <p>All faces were turned towards him, for there was something about him
  beyond his speech. Twilight was spreading over the garden, which lay near the
  edge of a chalk cliff above the shore, but the last light of sunset still lay
  on a part of the lawn, painting it yellow rather than green, and glowing
  almost like gold against the last line of the sea, which was a sombre indigo
  and violet, changing nearer land to a lurid, pale green. A long cloud of a
  jagged shape happened to be trailing across the sun; and the broad-hatted,
  hairy man from the South Seas suddenly pointed at it.</p>

  <p>"I know where the shape of that cloud would be called the shadow of the
  shark," he cried, "and a thousand men would fall on their faces ready to fast
  or fight, or die. Don't you see the great black dorsal fin, like the peak of
  a moving mountain? And then you lads discuss him as if he were a stroke at
  golf; and one of you says he would cut him up like birthday cake; and the
  other says your Jewish Jehovah would condescend to pat him like a pet
  rabbit."</p>

  <p>"Come, come," said Sir Owen, with a rather nervous waggishness, "we
  mustn't have any of your broad-minded blasphemies."</p>

  <p>Boon turned on him a baneful eye; literally an eye, for one of his eyes
  grew larger till it glowed like the eye of the Cyclops. His figure was black
  against the fiery turf, and they could almost hear his beard bristling.</p>

  <p>"Blasphemy!" he cried in a new voice, with a crack in it. "Take care it is
  not you who blaspheme."</p>

  <p>And then, before anyone could move, the black figure against the patch of
  gold had swung round and was walking away from the house, so impetuously that
  they had a momentary fear that he would walk over the cliff. However, he
  found the little wooden gate that led to a flight of wooden steps; and they
  heard him stumbling down the path to the fishing village below.</p>

  <p>Sir Owen seemed suddenly to shake off a paralysis like a fit of slumber.
  "My old friend is a little eccentric," he said. "Don't go, gentlemen; don't
  let him break up the party. It is early yet."</p>

  <p>But growing darkness and a certain social discomfort had already begun to
  dissolve the group on the lawn; and the host was soon left with a few of the
  most intimate of his guests. Simon and Gale, and his late antagonist, Dr.
  Wilkes, were staying to dinner; the darkness drove them indoors, and
  eventually found them sitting round a flask of green Chartreuse on the table;
  for Sir Owen had his expensive conventions as well as his expensive
  eccentricities. The talkative poet, however, had fallen silent, and was
  staring at the green liquid in his glass as if it were the green depth of the
  sea. His host attacked with animation the other ordinary topics of the
  day.</p>

  <p>"I bet I'm the most industrious of the lot of you," he said. "I've been at
  my easel on the beach all day, trying to paint this blessed cliff, and make
  it look like chalk and not cheese."</p>

  <p>"I saw you, but I didn't like to disturb you," said Wilkes. "I generally
  try to put in an hour or so looking for specimens at high tide: I suppose
  most people think I'm shrimping or only paddling and doing it for my health.
  But I've got a pretty good nucleus of that museum we were talking about, or
  at least the aquarium part of it. I put in most of the rest of the time
  arranging the exhibits; so I deny the implication of idleness. Gale was on
  the sea-shore, too. He was doing nothing as usual; and now he's saying
  nothing, which is much more uncommon."</p>

  <p>"I have been writing letters," said Simon, in his precise way, "but
  letters are not always trivial. Sometimes they are rather tremendous."</p>

  <p>Sir Owen glanced at him for a moment, and a silence followed, which was
  broken by a thud and a rattle of glasses as Gale brought his fist down on the
  table like a man who had thought of something suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Dagon!" he cried, in a sort of ecstasy.</p>

  <p>Most of the company seemed but little enlightened; perhaps they thought
  that saying "Dagon" was his poetical and professional fashion of saying
  "Damn". But the dark eyes of Simon brightened, and he nodded quickly.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course you're right," he said. "That must be why Mr. Boon is so
  fond of the Philistines."</p>

  <p>In answer to a general stare of inquiry, he said smoothly: "The
  Philistines were a people from Crete, probably of Hellenic origin, who
  settled on the coast of Palestine, carrying with them a worship which may
  very well have been that of Poseidon, but which their enemies, the
  Israelites, described as that of Dagon. The relevant matter here is that the
  carved or painted symbol of the god seems always to have been a fish."</p>

  <p>The mention of the new matter seemed to reawaken the tendency of the talk
  to turn into a wrangle between the poet and the professional scientist.</p>

  <p>"From my point of view," said the latter, "I must confess myself somewhat
  disappointed with your friend Mr. Boon. He represented himself as a
  rationalist like myself, and seemed to have made some scientific studies of
  folk-lore in the South Seas. But he seemed a little unbalanced; and surely he
  made a curious fuss about some sort of a fetish, considering it was only a
  fish."</p>

  <p>"No, no, no!" cried Gale, almost with passion. "Better make a fetish of
  the fish. Better sacrifice yourself and everybody else on the horrible huge
  altar of the fish. Better do anything than utter the star-blasting blasphemy
  of saying it is <i>only</i> a fish. It's as bad as saying the other thing is
  only a flower."</p>

  <p>"All the same, it <i>is</i> only a flower," answered Wilkes, "and the
  advantage of looking at these things in a cool and rational way from the
  outside is that you can..."</p>

  <p>He stopped a moment and remained quite still, as if he were watching
  something. Some even fancied that his pale, aquiline face looked paler as
  well as sharper.</p>

  <p>"What was that at the window?" he asked. "Is anybody outside this
  house?"</p>

  <p>"What's the matter? What did you see?" asked his host, in abrupt
  agitation.</p>

  <p>"Only a face," replied the doctor, "but it was not...it was not like a
  man's face. Let's get outside and look into this."</p>

  <p>Gabriel Gale was only a moment behind the doctor, who had impetuously
  dashed out of the room. Despite his lounging demeanour, the poet had already
  leapt to his feet with his hand on the back of the chair, when he stiffened
  where he stood; for he had seen it. The faces of the others showed that they
  had seen it too.</p>

  <p>Pressed against the dark window-pane, but only wanly luminous as it
  protruded out of the darkness, was a large face looking at first rather like
  a green goblin mask in a pantomime. Yet it was in no sense human; its eyes
  were set in large circles, rather in the fashion of an owl. But the
  glimmering covering that faintly showed on it was not of feathers, but of
  scales.</p>

  <p>The next moment it had vanished. The mind of the poet, which made images
  as rapidly as a cinema, even in a crisis of action, had already imagined a
  string of fancies about the sort of creature he saw it to be. He had thought
  involuntarily of some great flying fish winging its way across the foam, and
  the flat sand and the spire and roofs of the fishing village. He had
  half-imagined the moist sea air thickening in some strange way to a greener
  and more liquid atmosphere in which the marine monsters could swim about in
  the streets. He had entertained the fancy that the house itself stood in the
  depths of the sea, and that the great goblin-headed fishes were nosing round
  it, as round the cabin windows of a wreck.</p>

  <p>At that moment a loud voice was heard outside crying in distinct
  accents:</p>

  <p>"The fish has legs."</p>

  <p>For that instant, it seemed to give the last touch to the monstrosity. But
  the meaning of it came back to them, a returning reality, with the laughing
  face of Dr. Wilkes as he reappeared in the doorway, panting.</p>

  <p>"Our fish had two legs, and used them," he said. "He ran like a hare when
  he saw me coming; but I could see plainly enough it was a man playing you a
  trick of some sort. So much for that psychic phenomenon."</p>

  <p>He paused and looked at Sir Owen Cram with a smile that was keen and
  almost suspicious.</p>

  <p>"One thing is very clear to me," he said. "You have an enemy."</p>

  <p>The mystery of the human fish, however, did not long remain even a primary
  topic of conversation in a social group that had so many topics of
  conversation. They continued to pursue their hobbies and pelt each other with
  their opinions; even the smooth and silent Simon being gradually drawn into
  the discussions, in which he showed a dry and somewhat cynical dexterity. Sir
  Owen continued to paint with all the passion of an amateur. Gale continued to
  neglect to paint, with all the nonchalance of a painter. Mr. Boon was
  presumably still as busy with his wicked Bible and his good Philistines as
  Dr. Wilkes with his museum and his microscopic marine animals, when the
  little seaside town was shaken as by an earthquake with the incomprehensible
  calamity which spread its name over all the newspapers of the country.</p>

  <p>Gabriel Gale was scaling the splendid swell of turf that terminated in the
  great chalk cliff above the shore, in a mood consonant to the sunrise that
  was storming the skies above him. Clouds haloed with sunshine were already
  sailing over his head as if sent flying from a flaming wheel; and when he
  came to the brow of the cliff he saw one of those rare revelations when the
  sun does not seem to be merely the most luminous object in a luminous
  landscape, but itself the solitary focus and streaming fountain of all light.
  The tide was at the ebb, and the sea was only a strip of delicate turquoise
  over which rose the tremendous irradiation. Next to the strip of turquoise
  was a strip of orange sand, still wet, and nearer the sand was a desert of a
  more dead yellow or brown, growing paler in the increasing light. And as he
  looked down from the precipice upon that plain of pale gold, he saw two black
  objects lying in the middle of it. One was a small easel, still standing,
  with a camp-stool fallen beside it; the other was the flat and sprawling
  figure of a man.</p>

  <p>The figure did not move, but as he stared he became conscious that another
  human figure was moving, was walking over the flat sands towards it from
  under the shadow of the cliff. Looking at it steadily, he saw that it was the
  man called Simon; and in an instant he seemed to realize that the motionless
  figure was that of Sir Owen Cram. He hastened to the stairway down the cliff
  and so to the sands; and soon stood face to face with Simon; for they both
  looked at each other for a moment before they both looked down at the body.
  The conviction was already cold in his heart that it was a dead body.
  Nevertheless, he said sharply: "We must have a doctor; where is Dr.
  Wilkes?"</p>

  <p>"It is no good, I fear," said Simon, looking away at the sea.</p>

  <p>"Wilkes may only confirm our fears that he is dead," said Gale, "but he
  may have something to say about how he died."</p>

  <p>"True," said the other, "I will go for him myself." And he walked back
  rapidly towards the cliff in the track of his own foot-prints.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it was at the foot-prints that Gale was gazing in a bemused
  fashion at that moment. The tracks of his own coming were clear enough, and
  the tracks of Simon's coming and going; and the third rather more rambling
  track of the unmistakable boots of the unfortunate Sir Owen, leading up to
  the spot where his easel was planted. And that was all. The sand was soft, so
  that the lightest foot would disturb it; it was well above the tides; and
  there was not the faintest trace of any other human being having been near
  the body. Yet the body had a deep wound under the angle of the jaw; and there
  was no sign of any weapon of suicide.</p>

  <p>Gabriel Gale was a believer in commonsense, in theory if not always in
  practice. He told himself repeatedly that these things were the practical
  clues in such a case; the wound, the weapon or absence of weapon, the
  foot-prints or absence of foot-prints. But there was also a part of his mind
  which was always escaping from his control and playing tricks; fixing on his
  memory meaningless things as if they were symbols, and then haunting him with
  them as mysteries. He made no point of it; it was rather sub-conscious than
  self-conscious; but the parts of any living picture that he saw were seldom
  those that others saw, or that it seemed sensible to see. And there were one
  or two details in the tragedy before him that haunted him then and long
  afterwards. Cram had fallen backwards in a rather twisted fashion, with his
  feet towards the shore; and a few inches from the left foot lay a starfish.
  He could not say whether it was merely the bright orange colour of the
  creature that irrationally riveted his eye, or merely some obscure fancy of
  repetition, in that the human figure was itself spread and sprawling flat
  like a starfish, with four limbs instead of five. Nor did he attempt to
  analyse this aesthetic antic of his psychology; it was a suppressed part of
  his mind which still repeated that the mystery of the untrodden sands would
  turn out to be something quite simple; but that the starfish possessed the
  secret.</p>

  <p>He looked up to see Simon returning with the doctor, indeed with two
  doctors; for there was more than one medical representative in the mob of Sir
  Owen's varied interests. The other was a Dr. Garth, a little man with an
  angular and humorous face; he was an old friend of Gale's but the poet's
  greeting was rather <i>distrait.</i> Garth and his colleague, however, got to
  work on a preliminary examination, which made further talk needless. It could
  not be a full examination till the arrival of the police, but it was
  sufficient to extinguish any hope of life, if any such had lingered. Garth,
  who was bent over the body in a crouching posture, spoke to his fellow
  physician without raising his head.</p>

  <p>"There seems to be something rather odd about this wound. It goes almost
  straight upwards, as if it was struck from below. But Sir Owen was a very
  small man; and it seems queer that he should be stabbed by somebody smaller
  still."</p>

  <p>Gale's sub-consciousness exploded with a strange note of harsh
  mockery.</p>

  <p>"What," he cried, "you don't think the starfish jumped up and killed
  him?"</p>

  <p>"No, of course not," said Garth, with his gruff good humour. "What on
  earth is the matter with you?"</p>

  <p>"Lunacy, I think," said the poet, and began to walk slowly towards the
  shore.</p>

  <p>As time went on he almost felt disposed to fancy that he had correctly
  diagnosed his own complaint. The image began to figure even in his dreams,
  but not merely as a natural nightmare about the body on the sea-shore. The
  significant sea creature seemed more vivid even than the body. As he had
  originally seen the corpse from above, spread flat out beneath him, he saw it
  in his visions as something standing, as if propped against a wall or even
  merely drawn or graven on a wall. Sometimes the sandy ground had become a
  ground of old gold in some decoration of the Dark Ages, with the figure in
  the stiff agonies of a martyr, but the red star always showed like a lamp by
  his feet. Sometimes it was a hieroglyphic of a more Eastern sort, as of some
  stone god rigidly dancing; but the five-pointed star was always in the same
  place below. Sometimes it seemed a rude, red-sandstone sort of drawing; yet
  more archaic; but the star was always the reddest spot in it. Now and again,
  while the human figure was as dry and dark as a mummy, the star would seem to
  be literally alive, waving its flaming fingers as if it were trying to tell
  him something. Now and then even the whole figure was upside down, as if to
  restore the star to its proper place in the skies.</p>

  <p>"I told Wilkes that a flower was a living star," he said to himself. "A
  starfish is more literally a living star. But this is like going crazy. And
  if there is one thing I strongly object to, it is going crazy. What use
  should I be to all my brother lunatics, if I once really lost my balance on
  the tight-rope over the abyss?"</p>

  <p>He sat staring into vacancy for some time, trying to fit in this small and
  stubborn fancy with a much steadier stream of much deeper thoughts that were
  already driving in a certain direction. At last, the light of a possibility
  began to dawn in his eyes; and it was evidently something very simple when it
  was realized; something which he felt he ought to have thought of before; for
  he laughed shortly and scornfully at himself as he rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"If Boon goes about everywhere introducing his shark and I go into society
  always attended by my starfish," he murmured to himself, "we shall turn the
  world into an aquarium bigger and better than Dr. Wilkes is fixing up. I'm
  going down to make some inquiries in the village."</p>

  <p>Returning thence across the sands at evening, after several conversations
  with skippers and fishermen, he wore a more satisfied expression.</p>

  <p>"I always did believe," he reflected, "that the foot-print business would
  be the simplest thing in the affair. But there are some things in it that are
  by no means simple."</p>

  <p>Then he looked up, and saw far off on the sands, lonely and dark against
  the level evening light, the strange hat and stumpy figure of Amos Boon.</p>

  <p>He seemed to consider for a moment the advisability of a meeting; then he
  turned away and moved towards the stairway up the cliff. Mr. Boon was
  apparently occupied in idly drawing lines on the sand with his shabby
  umbrella; like one drawing plans for a child's sand-castle, but apparently
  without any such intelligent object or excuse. Gale had often seen the man
  mooning about with equally meaningless and automatic gestures; but as the
  poet mounted the rocky steps, climbing higher and higher, he had a return of
  the irrational feeling of a visionary vertigo. He told himself again, as if
  in warning, that it was his whole duty in life to walk on a tight-rope above
  a void in which many imaginative men were swallowed up. Then he looked down
  again at the drop of the dizzy cliffs to the flats that seemed to be swimming
  below him like a sea. And he saw the long, loose lines drawn in the sand
  unified into a shape, as flat as a picture on a wall. He had often seen a
  child, in the same fashion, draw on the sand a pig as large as a house. But
  in this case he could not shake off his former feeling of something archaic,
  like a palaeolithic drawing, about the scratching of the brown sand. And Mr.
  Boon had not drawn a pig, but a shark; conspicuous with its jagged teeth and
  fin like a horn exalted.</p>

  <p>But he was not the only person overlooking this singular decorative
  scheme. When he came to the short railings along the brow of the cliff in
  which the stairway terminated, he found three figures leaning on it and
  looking down; and instantly realized how the case was closing in. For even in
  their outlines against the sky he had recognized the two doctors and an
  inspector of police.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Gale," observed Wilkes, "may I present you to Inspector Davies; a
  very active and successful officer."</p>

  <p>Garth nodded. "I understand the inspector will soon make an arrest," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"The inspector must be getting back to his work and not talking about it,"
  said that official good-humouredly. "I'm going down to the village. Anybody
  coming my way?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Wilkes assented and followed him, but Dr. Garth stopped a moment,
  being detained by the poet, who caught hold of his sleeve with unusual
  earnestness.</p>

  <p>"Garth," he said, "I want to apologise. I'm afraid I was wool-gathering
  when we met the other day, and didn't hail you as I ought to hail an old
  friend. You and I have been in one or two queer affairs together, and I want
  to talk to you about this one. Shall we sit down on that seat over
  there?"</p>

  <p>They seated themselves on an iron seat set up on the picturesque headland;
  and Gale added, "I wish you could tell me roughly how you got as far as you
  seem to have got."</p>

  <p>Garth gazed silently out to sea, and said at last:</p>

  <p>"Do you know that man Simon?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the poet, "that's the way it works is it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, the investigation soon began to show that Simon knew rather more
  than he said. He was on the spot before you; and for some time he wouldn't
  admit what it was he saw before you turned up. We guessed it was because he
  was afraid to tell the truth; and in one sense he was."</p>

  <p>"Simon doesn't talk enough," said Gale thoughtfully. "He doesn't talk
  about himself enough; so he thinks about himself too much. A man like that
  always gets secretive; not necessarily in the sense of being criminal, or
  even of being malicious, but merely of being morbid. He is the sort that is
  ill-treated at school and never says so. As long as a thing terrified him, he
  couldn't talk about it."</p>

  <p>"I don't know how you guessed it," said Garth, "but that is something like
  the line of discoveries. At first they thought that Simon's silence was
  guilt, but it was only a fear of something more than guilt; of some diabolic
  destiny and entanglement. The truth is, that when he went up before you to
  the cliff-head at daybreak, he saw something that hag-rode his morbid spirit
  ever since. He saw the figure of this man Boon poised on the brink of the
  precipice, black against the dawn, and waving his arms in some unearthly
  fashion as if he were going to fly. Simon thought the man was talking to
  himself, and perhaps even singing. Then the strange creature passed on
  towards the village and was lost in the twilight; but when Simon came to the
  edge of the cliff he saw Sir Owen lying dead far out on the sands below,
  beside his easel."</p>

  <p>"And ever since, I suppose," observed Gale, "Simon has seen sharks
  everywhere."</p>

  <p>"You are right again," said the doctor. "He has admitted since that a
  shadow on the blind or a cloud on the moon would have the unmistakable shape
  of the fish with the fin erect. But, in fact, it is a very mistakable shape;
  anything with a triangular top to it would suggest it to a man in his state
  of nerves. But the truth is that so long as he thought Boon had dealt death
  from a distance by some sort of curse or spell, we could get nothing out of
  him. Our only chance was to show him that Boon might have done it even by
  natural means. And we did show it, after all."</p>

  <p>"What is your theory, then?" asked the other.</p>

  <p>"It is too general to be called a theory yet," replied the doctor; "but,
  honestly, I do not think it at all impossible that Boon might have killed a
  man on the sands from the top of a cliff, without falling back on any
  supernatural stuff. You've got to consider it like this: Boon has been very
  deep in the secrets of savages, especially in that litter of islands that lie
  away towards Australia. Now, we know that such savages, for all they are
  called ignorant, have developed many dexterities and many unique tools. They
  have blow-pipes that kill at a considerable distance; they harpoon and lasso
  things, and draw them in on a line. Above all, the Australian savages have
  discovered the boomerang that actually returns to the hand. Is it quite so
  inconceivable that Boon might know some way of sending a penetrating
  projectile from a distance, and even possibly of recovering it in some way?
  Dr. Wilkes and I, on examining the wound, found it a very curious one: it was
  made by some tapering, pointed tool, with a slight curve; and it not only
  curved upwards, but even slightly outwards, as if the curve were returning on
  itself. Does not that suggest to you some outlandish weapon of a strange
  shape, and possibly with strange properties? And always remember that such an
  explanation would explain something else as well, which is generally regarded
  as the riddle. It would explain why the murderer left no foot-prints round
  the body."</p>

  <p>Gale gazed out to sea in silence, as if considering; then he said
  simply:</p>

  <p>"An extremely shrewd argument. But I know why he left no foot-prints. It
  is a much simpler explanation than that."</p>

  <p>Garth stared at him for a few moments; and then observed gravely:</p>

  <p>"May I then ask, in return, what is your theory?"</p>

  <p>"My theory will seem a maze of theories, and nothing else," said Gale. "It
  is, as many would say, of such stuff as dreams are made of. Most modern
  people have a curious contradiction; they abound in theories, yet they never
  see the part that theories play in practical life. They are always talking
  about temperament and circumstances and accident; but most men are what their
  theories make them; most men go in for murder or marriage, or mere lounging
  because of some theory of life, asserted or assumed. So I can never manage to
  begin my explanations in that brisk, pointed, practical way that you doctors
  and detectives do. I see a man's mind first, sometimes almost without any
  particular man attached to it. I could only begin this business by describing
  a mental state...which can't be described. Our murderer or maniac, or
  whatever you call him, is certainly affected by some of the elements
  attributed to him. His view has reached an insane degree of simplicity, and
  in that sense of savagery. But I doubt whether he would necessarily transfer
  the savagery from the end to the means. In one sense, indeed, his view might
  be compared to the barbaric. He saw every creature and even every object
  naked. He did not understand that what clothes a thing is sometimes the most
  real part of it. Have you ever noticed how true is that old phrase, 'clothed
  and in his right mind'? Man is not in his right mind when he is not clothed
  with the symbols of his social dignity. Humanity is not even human when it is
  naked. But in a lower sense it is so of lesser things, even of lifeless
  things. A lot of nonsense is talked about auras; but this is the truth behind
  it. Everything has a halo. Everything has a sort of atmosphere of what it
  signifies, which makes it sacred. Even the little creatures he studied had
  each of them its halo; but he would not see it."</p>

  <p>"But what little creatures did Boon study?" asked Garth in some wonder.
  "Do you mean the cannibals?"</p>

  <p>"I was not thinking about Boon," replied Gabriel Gale.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" cried the other, in sudden excitement. "Why, Boon is
  almost in the hands of the police."</p>

  <p>"Boon is a good man," said Gale, calmly; "he is very stupid; that is why
  he is an atheist. There are intelligent atheists, as we shall see presently;
  but that stunted, stupid, sort is much commoner, and much nicer. But he is a
  good man; his motive is good; he originally talked all that tosh of the
  superiority of the savage because he thought he was the under-dog. He may be
  a trifle cracked, by now, about sharks and other things; but that's only
  because his travels have been too much for his intellect. They say travel
  broadens the mind; but you must have the mind. He had a mind for a suburban
  chapel, and there passed before it all the panorama of gilded nature-worship
  and purple sacrifice. He doesn't know if he's on his head or his heels, any
  more than a good many others. But I shouldn't wonder if heaven is largely
  populated with atheists of that sort, scratching their heads and wondering
  where they are.</p>

  <p>"But Boon is a parenthesis; that is all he is. The man I am talking about
  is very much the point, and a sharp one at that. He dealt in something very
  different from muddled mysticism about human sacrifice. Human sacrifice is
  quite a human weakness. He dealt in assassination; direct, secret, straight
  from a head as inhuman as hell. And I knew it when I first talked to him over
  the tea-cups and he said he saw nothing pretty in a flower."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow!" remonstrated Dr. Garth.</p>

  <p>"I don't mean that a man merely dissecting a daisy must be on the road to
  the gallows," conceded the poet, magnanimously, "but I do say that to mean it
  as he meant it is to be on a straight road of logic that leads there if he
  chooses to follow it. God is inside everything. But this man wanted to be
  outside everything; to see everything hung in a vacuum, simply its own dead
  self. It's not only not the same, it's almost the opposite of scepticism in
  the sense of Boon or the Book of Job. That's a man overwhelmed by the
  mysteries; but this man denies that there are any mysteries. It's not, in the
  ordinary sense, a matter of theology, but psychology. Most good pagans and
  pantheists might talk of the miracles of nature; but this man denies that
  there are any miracles, even in the sense of marvels. Don't you see that
  dreadful dry light shed on things must at last wither up the moral mysteries
  as illusions, respect for age, respect for property, and that the sanctity of
  life will be a superstition? The men in the street are only organisms, with
  their organs more or less displayed. For such a one there is no longer any
  terror in the touch of human flesh, nor does he see God watching him out of
  the eyes of a man."</p>

  <p>"He may not believe in miracles, but he seems to work them," remarked the
  doctor. "What else was he doing, when he struck a man down on the sand
  without leaving a mark to show where he stood?"</p>

  <p>"He was paddling," answered Gale.</p>

  <p>"As high up on the shore as that?" inquired the other.</p>

  <p>Gale nodded. "That was what puzzled me; till something I saw on the sand
  started a train of thought that led to my asking the seafaring people about
  the tides. It's very simple; the night before we found the body was a
  flood-tide, and the sea came up higher than usual; not quite to where Cram
  was sitting, but pretty near. So that was the way that the real human fish
  came out of the sea. That was the way the divine shark really devoured the
  sacrifice. The man came paddling in the foam, like a child on a holiday."</p>

  <p>"Who came?" asked Garth; but he shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Who did go dredging for sea-beasts with a sort of shrimping-net along the
  shore every evening? Who did inherit the money of the old man for his
  ambitious museum and his scientific career? Who did tell me in the garden
  that a cowslip was only a growth like a cancer?"</p>

  <p>"I am compelled to understand you," said the doctor gloomily. "You mean
  that very able young man named Wilkes?"</p>

  <p>"To understand Wilkes you must understand a good deal," continued his
  friend. "You must reconstruct the crime, as they say. Look out over that long
  line of darkening sea and sand, where the last light runs red as blood; that
  is where he came dredging every day, in the same bloodshot dusk, looking for
  big beasts and small; and in a true sense everything was fish that came to
  his net. He was constructing his museum as a sort of cosmos; with everything
  traced from the fossil to the flying fish. He had spent enormous sums on it,
  and had got quite disinterestedly into debt; for instance he had had
  magnificent models made, in wax or papier mach, of small fish magnified, or
  extinct fish restored; things that South Kensington cannot afford, and
  certainly Wilkes could not afford. But he had persuaded Cram to leave his
  money to the museum, as you know; and for him Cram was simply a silly old
  fool, who painted pictures he couldn't paint, and talked of sciences he
  didn't understand; and whose only natural function was to die and save the
  museum. Well, when every morning Wilkes had done polishing the glass cases of
  his masks and models, he came round by the cliff and took a turn at the
  fossils in the chalk with his geological hammer; then he put it back in that
  great canvas bag of his, and unslung his long shrimping-net and began to
  wade. This is where I want you to look at that dark red sand and see the
  picture; one never understands anything till one sees the picture. He went
  for miles along the shallows of that desolate shore, long inured to seeing
  one queer creature or another stranded on the sand; here a sea-hedgehog, and
  there a starfish, and then a crab, and then another creature. I have told you
  he had reached a stage when he would have looked at an angel with the eye of
  an ornithologist. What would he think of a man, and a man looking like that?
  Don't you see that poor Cram must have looked like a crab or a sea-urchin;
  his dwarfed, hunched figure seen from behind, with his fan of bristling
  whiskers, his straggling bow legs and restless twisting feet all tangled up
  with the three legs of his stool; making him look as if he had five limbs
  like a starfish? Don't you see he looked like a Common Object of the
  Sea-shore? And Wilkes had only to collect this specimen, and all his other
  specimens were safe. Everything was fish that came to his net, and...</p>

  <p>"He stretched out the long pole in his hand to its full extent, and drew
  the net over the old man's head as if he were catching a great grey moth. He
  plucked him backwards off his stool so that he lay kicking on his back on the
  sand; and doubtless looking more like a large insect than ever. Then the
  murderer bent forward, propped by one hand upon his pole, and the other armed
  with his geological hammer. With the pick at the back of that instrument he
  struck in what he well knew to be a vital spot. The curve you noticed in the
  wound is due to that sharp side of the hammer being shaped like a pickaxe.
  But the unusual position of it, and the puzzle of how such a blow could be
  struck upwards, was due to the queer posture of the two figures. The murderer
  struck at a head that was upside down. It could only occur as a rule if the
  victim were standing on his head, a posture in which few persons await the
  assassin. But with the flourish and sweep of the great net, I fancy a
  starfish caught in it fell out of it, just beyond the dead man's foot. At any
  rate, it was that starfish and the accident of its flying so high on the
  shore, that set my mind drifting in the general direction of tides; and the
  possibility of the murderer having been moving about in the water. If he made
  any prints the breakers washed them out; and I should never have begun to
  think of it but for that red five-fingered little monster."</p>

  <p>"Then do you mean to tell me," demanded Garth, "that all this business
  about the shadow of the shark had nothing to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"The shadow of the shark had everything to do with it," replied Gale. "The
  murderer hid in the shadow of the shark, and struck from under the shadow of
  the shark. I doubt if he would have struck at all, if he had not had the
  shadow of that fantastic fin in which to hide. And the proof is that he
  himself took the trouble to emphasize and exaggerate the legend of poor Boon
  dancing before Dagon. Do you remember that queer incident of the fish's face
  at the window? How did anybody merely playing a practical joke get hold of a
  fish's face? It was very life-like; for it was one of the masks modelled for
  the Wilkes museum; and Wilkes had left it in the hall in his great canvas
  bag. It seems simple, doesn't it, for a man to raise an alarm inside a house,
  walk out to see, and instantly put on a mask and look in at a window? That's
  all he did; and you can see his idea, from the fact that he proceeded to warn
  Sir Owen of an enemy. He wanted all this idolatrous and mystical murder
  business worked for all it was worth, that his own highly reasonable murder
  might not be noticed. And you see he has succeeded. You tell me that Boon is
  in the hands of the police."</p>

  <p>Garth sprang to his feet. "What is to be done?" he said.</p>

  <p>"You will know what to do," said the poet. "You are a good and just man,
  and a practical man, too. I am not a practical man." He rose with a certain
  air of apology. "You see, you want an unpractical man for finding out this
  sort of thing."</p>

  <p>And once more he gazed down from the precipice into the abysses below.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV. &mdash; THE CRIME OF GABRIEL GALE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Dr. Butterworth, the famous London physician, was sitting in
  his summer-house in his shirt sleeves, for it was a hot day and he had been
  playing tennis on the sunny lawns outside. He had a solid face and figure and
  carried everywhere an atmosphere of bodily health and good humour which
  helped him not a little in his profession; but he was not serious or
  self-conscious about it. He was not one of those in whom health has
  degenerated into hygiene. He played tennis when he felt inclined and left off
  when he felt inclined; as on the present occasion, when he had retired to
  smoke a pipe in the shade. He enjoyed a game as he enjoyed a joke; which was
  interpreted by some as meaning that he would never be a player, and by
  himself as meaning that he would always be able to play. And he enjoyed a
  joke very much, even the most minute and trivial joke that his roving eye
  encountered; and at this moment it encountered a quaint detail, which was
  something of a quaint contrast, in the glowing garden outside. Framed in the
  dark doorway of the summer-house, like a lighted scene on the stage, was the
  perspective of a garden path, bordered with very gay and flamboyant beds of
  tulips, having something of the gorgeous formality of the borders of a
  Persian illumination. And down the centre of the central path was advancing a
  figure that looked by comparison almost completely black, with black top-hat,
  black clothes and black umbrella; it might have been the mythical Black Tulip
  come to life and a walking parody of the tall, top-heavy garden flowers. The
  next moment all such fancies had faded from the doctor's day-dream; for he
  had recognized a familiar face under the top-hat; he knew that the contrast
  was not merely grotesque; and was shocked with the gravity of the visitor's
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Garth," he said in a hearty manner, "sit down and tell us all
  about yourself. You look as if you were going to a funeral."</p>

  <p>"So I am," replied Dr. Garth, putting his black hat on a chair; he was a
  small, red-haired, shrewd-faced man and he looked pale and harassed.</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry," said Butterworth quickly, "if I spoke without thinking.
  I'm afraid you're really rather cut up.</p>

  <p>"I am going to a queer sort of funeral," said Dr. Garth grimly; "the sort
  of funeral where we take special precautions to ensure premature burial."</p>

  <p>"What in the world do you mean?" asked his colleague, staring.</p>

  <p>"I mean I've got to bury a man alive," said Garth with a ghastly calm.
  "But it's the sort of burial that requires two doctors' certificates instead
  of one."</p>

  <p>Butterworth stared at the patch of sun-light and sucked in his cheeks with
  a soundless whistle. "Oh...I see," he said.</p>

  <p>Then he added abruptly: "Of course it's always a sad business; but I'm
  afraid it's rather personal for you. A friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>"One of my best friends, I think, barring yourself," replied Garth; "and
  one of the best and brightest young men of our time as well. I was afraid
  something of the sort might happen; but I hoped it wouldn't be so bad as
  this." He stopped for an instant and then said almost explosively:</p>

  <p>"It's poor old Gale; and he's done it once too often."</p>

  <p>"Done what?" asked Dr. Butterworth.</p>

  <p>"It's rather difficult to explain, unless you know him," said Garth.
  "Gabriel Gale is a poet, also a painter and other wild things of that sort;
  but he has also a wild theory of his own about how to cure lunatics. In
  short, the amateur set up as a mad doctor and now the doctor is really mad.
  It's a horrid tragedy; but really he was asking for it."</p>

  <p>"I don't yet understand what it's all about," said the other doctor
  patiently.</p>

  <p>"I tell you he had a theory," said Garth. "He thought he could cure
  cracked people by what he called sympathy. But it didn't mean what you would
  mean by sympathy; he meant following their thoughts and going half-way with
  them, or all the way with them if he could. I used to joke with him, poor
  fellow, and say that if a lunatic thought he was made of glass, Gale would
  try hard to feel a little transparent. Anyhow, that was his notion, that he
  could really look at things to some extent from the lunatic's point of view;
  and talk to him in his own language. He admitted himself that it was a risky
  business, to walk on the edge of the precipice like that; and now, as I say,
  he's done it once too often. I always distrusted it myself."</p>

  <p>"I should think so," said Dr. Butterworth, all his solid sanity stiffening
  against the suggestion. "He might as well say that a doctor ought to limp all
  the way to cure a lame man, or shut his eyes in order to help the blind."</p>

  <p>"If the blind lead the blind," assented the other gloomily. "Well, he's
  fallen into the ditch this time."</p>

  <p>"Why especially this time?" asked Butterworth.</p>

  <p>"Well, if he doesn't go to an asylum, he'll go to jail," said Garth
  grimly. "That's why I'm in such a hurry to have him certified; God knows I
  don't like doing that. But he's broken out this time in a way he never did
  before. He was always fanciful and eccentric, of course; but I'm bound to say
  he had a very sane streak in him somewhere. It's exactly because he's never
  done anything like this before that I'm sure the end has really come. For one
  thing, he's committed a perfectly crazy assault and apparently tried to
  murder a man with a pitchfork. But what hits me much harder, who knew him, is
  that he tried to murder a perfectly mild and shy and inoffensive person; in
  fact a rather gauche youth from Cambridge, half developed into a curate. Now
  that's quite unlike Gabriel, even at his maddest. The men with whom he
  wrestled in spirit, if not in body, were intellectual bullies or mesmerists,
  the sort of men who wanted somebody to stand up to them; like that
  thin-lipped Dr. Wilkes, or that Russian Professor. I can no more see him
  savaging somebody like poor young Saunders than I can see him kicking a
  crippled child. And yet I <i>did</i> see him do it. The only explanation is
  that he wasn't himself.</p>

  <p>"There was another thing which made me sure he wasn't himself. The weather
  had been very trying for everybody for some time; hot and stormy and
  electric; but it was the first time I've ever known him upset by such storms.
  I've known him to do the silliest things; I've known him stand on his head in
  the garden; but that was only showing that he was <i>not</i> affected by the
  storm. But this time I'm sure these queer semi-tropical tempests have been
  too much for him; so that even the very subject of the storm upset him in
  some way. For this tragedy arose out of the most trivial sort of triviality.
  The whole terrible unnatural business began with talking about the
  weather.</p>

  <p>"Lady Flamborough said to a guest at her rather damp garden-party, 'You
  brought bad weather with you.' Anybody might say that to anybody; but she did
  say it to young Herbert Saunders, who is awfully awkward and shy, one of
  those long, loose boys with large feet, who seem to have outgrown their
  clothes and their wits; the last sort of person who would want to be singled
  out by any remark, however trifling. So Saunders only gaped and gurgled or
  was dumb, but somehow the lady's remark seemed to get on Gale's nerves from
  the first. A little while afterwards Gale met Lady Flamborough again, at
  another reception where it was raining, and he suddenly pointed, like some
  comic conspirator, at the tall ungainly figure of Saunders in the distance
  and said: 'He still brings bad weather.' Then happened one of those
  coincidences that are quite natural but seem to drive madmen really mad. The
  next time all that set happened to get together was on a really beautiful
  afternoon at Mrs. Blakeney's; with a clear blue sky without a cloud in it, so
  that old Blakeney went pottering round and showed all the first comers his
  gardens and glasshouses. But after that they all went in to tea, which was
  served in the great peacock-green drawing-room in the middle of the house;
  and so it happened that Saunders came late and there was a good deal of
  laughter as he sat down, much to his embarrassment; because the weather joke
  had been repeated and people were quite pleased to see it falsified for once.
  Then they all went out into the rooms nearer the entrance; and Gabriel Gale
  was walking towards the doorway. Between two pillars he caught sight of one
  of the outer windows and stood rooted to the spot, rigidly pointing with one
  arm. That gesture alone warned me that something was really rather wrong with
  him; but when I looked I could hardly help sharing his shock of surprise. For
  the windows that had been painted blue with summer sky were painted black
  with rain. On every side of the house the rain dripped and pattered as
  dismally as if it had been raining for a hundred years. And ten minutes
  before the whole garden had seemed a garden of gold like the Hesperides. Gale
  stood staring at this flying storm from nowhere, that had so suddenly struck
  the house; then he turned slowly and looked, with an expression not to be
  forgotten, at the man who was standing a few yards away. It was Herbert
  Saunders.</p>

  <p>"You can imagine it's not much in my line to believe in witchcraft or
  magicians who control the elements; but there did really seem something funny
  about that cloudless day having so rapidly overclouded, with the coming of
  the one man whose name was already associated with it, if only by a jest. It
  was a mere coincidence, of course; but what worried me was the possible
  effect on my friend's already rather rickety psychology. He and Saunders were
  both standing and staring out of the same wide window, looking at the
  deluge-darkened garden and the swaying and tormented trees; but Saunder's
  simple face seemed to express only amiable bewilderment; indeed, he was
  smiling vaguely and shyly, as he did when he received a compliment. For he
  was one of those whose face after a compliment always looks as if it has
  received a buffet. He obviously saw nothing in it but a repetition of the
  joke; perhaps he thought that the English climate was keeping up the joke.
  And, compared with his face, the face of Gabriel was like the face of a
  fiend. So it seemed at least, as it sprang white out of the growing dark to
  meet the first white burst of the lightning; then there followed only thunder
  and the noise of the roaring rain; but I knew that he stood there rocking
  with that inexplicable excitement. Through the thunder I heard his voice
  saying, 'It makes one feel like God.'</p>

  <p>"Immediately under the windows a little path ran on the edge of some
  meadow land attached to the garden, where the Blakeneys had been getting in
  their hay; and a moderately large mound of hay looked almost mountainously
  dark against that low and lowering sky; a two-pronged pitchfork lying across
  it had certainly something grim about its black outline, which may have
  captured poor Gale's fancy; for he was always prone to be taken by odd sights
  as if they were signals. Anyhow at that moment the host and hostess and other
  guests came hurrying by; the old man lamenting over the ruin of his hay; but
  the lady of the house apparently much more concerned about the fate of some
  highly ornamental garden-chairs, which had apparently been left out on the
  lawn just adjoining the meadow, under the large apple-tree whose boughs were
  now tossing and twisting in the storm.</p>

  <p>"Gabriel Gale, when in his right mind, is the most chivalrous of men, and
  would have regained the lady's chairs at a bound. But now he could do nothing
  but glare at the unfortunate Saunders; who awoke trembling to his social
  duties, in that agony of self-consciousness in which a man is afraid to do
  the right thing and afraid not to do it. At length, however, he jerked
  himself forward, fumbled with the door, flung it open and ran out into the
  reverberating rain. Then Gale followed him to the open door and shouted
  something after him. For most of the company, I think, it was lost in the
  din; but even if they had heard it, they certainly could not have understood
  it. I heard it; and I thought I understood it only too well. For what Gale
  shouted through the storm was, 'Why don't you call the chairs and they'll
  come to you.'</p>

  <p>"A second or so afterwards he added, as if it were an afterthought, 'You
  might as well tell the tree to come here as well.' Naturally there was no
  answer; and indeed Saunders, partly by his natural clumsiness and partly in
  the distraction of the driving elements, seemed for the moment to have lost
  his way and was staggering up the steeper path of the meadow some way to the
  left of the tree. I could just see his long figure and angular awkward elbows
  traced against the sky. Then followed the sudden, violent and utterly
  unintelligible incident. A rope happened to lie half round one of the swathes
  in the foreground; and Gale, leaping out of the door, caught it up and seemed
  to be knotting it in a sort of savage haste. The next moment there swept
  across the sky the great swirling curves of a noose thrown in the manner of a
  lasso. And I could see the wavering figure on the dark ridge alter its
  attitude and rear up as against an invisible obstacle, as the rope tightened
  and tugged it back.</p>

  <p>"I looked round for assistance; and was surprised and somewhat alarmed to
  find I was alone. The host and hostess, and the others, having despatched the
  obliging Saunders after the chairs, had rushed off to summon the servants or
  secure other doors and windows, or look after other fittings threatened by
  the weather; and there was no one but myself to watch the unmeaning and
  apparently imbecile tragedy outside. I saw Gale drag Saunders like a sack at
  the end of a rope along the whole length of windows and disappear round a
  corner of the house. But I turned cold with a new fear when, even as he
  rushed past, he snatched the hay-fork from the mound and seemed to disappear
  brandishing it, like the fabulous fork of a demon. I rushed after them, but
  slipping on the wet stones, hurt my foot and had to limp; the raving storm
  seemed to have swallowed up that lunatic and all his antics; and it was not
  until some time afterwards that men found how that dance had ended. Herbert
  Saunders was found tied to a tree, still alive and even unwounded, but
  presenting the appearance of having barely missed a murderous attack; for the
  prongs of the pitchfork were driven by sheer fury into the tree on each side
  of his neck, holding him pinned there as by an iron ring. Gabriel Gale was
  not found for nearly a day, until after the storm was spent and the sunshine
  had returned; and he was loitering about in an adjoining meadow blowing the
  clocks off dandelions. I have seldom known him so serene."</p>

  <p>There was a short silence. "How is the other fellow...Saunders?" asked
  Butterworth, after a pause of frowning consideration. "Was he much hurt?"</p>

  <p>"Had a shock and is still shaky, of course," answered Garth. "Had to go
  for a rest-cure or something; but I believe he's all right now. Only you can
  hardly expect a harmless person who's been half murdered in a raving attack
  like that to feel very friendly or forgiving. So I'm afraid they will make it
  a case of attempted murder unless we can get our friend off on medical
  grounds. As a matter of fact, I have him waiting outside in the car."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said the London doctor, rising with abrupt composure and
  buttoning up his coat. "We had better go along to see him now and get it
  over."</p>

  <p>The interview between Gale and the two doctors, at an adjacent hotel, was
  so short and so extraordinary that they went away with their very level heads
  turning like wind-mills. For Gale displayed nothing even of the merely
  childish innocence of levity attributed to him in the tale of the dandelions.
  He listened with patience, and a humorous and benevolent mildness which made
  the two doctors, who were considerably his seniors, feel as if they were
  being treated as juniors. When Garth began to break it to him gently that
  some sort of rest-cure was required in his own interests, he laughed heartily
  and anticipated all such periphrases.</p>

  <p>"Don't be nervous, old man," he said, "you mean I ought to be in a
  madhouse; and I'm sure you mean well."</p>

  <p>"You know I am your friend," said Garth earnestly; "and all your friends
  would say what I say."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," said Gale, smiling. "Well, if that is the opinion of my friends,
  perhaps it would be better to get the opinion of my enemies."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean," demanded the other. "Of your enemies?"</p>

  <p>"Shall we say of my enemy?" continued Gale in level tones. "Of the man to
  whom I have done this perfectly outrageous thing. Well, really, that is all I
  ask; that before you lock me up for this outrage, you ask Herbert Saunders
  himself what he thinks about it."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean," broke in Butterworth rather impatiently, "that we are to
  ask him whether he liked being half-throttled and impaled on a
  pitchfork?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Gale nodding, "I want you to ask him whether he liked being
  half throttled and impaled on a pitchfork."</p>

  <p>He slightly knitted his brows as if considering a new and merely practical
  point and then, added:</p>

  <p>"I should send him a telegram now...say anything...'How do you like being
  lassoed?' or, 'What price pitchforks?' or something playful of that
  sort."</p>

  <p>"We could telephone, if it comes to that," said Garth.</p>

  <p>The poet shook his head. "No," he said, "that sort of man feels much more
  free in writing. He will only stammer on the telephone. He won't stammer
  anything like what you imagine, even then; but he will stammer. But writing
  with his head in one of those little cubicles at the telegraph office, he
  will feel as free as in a confessional box."</p>

  <p>The two doctors, when they parted in some bewilderment, but tacitly
  accepting this suggestion of a respite, lost no time in fulfilling the
  condition required. They sent off a carefully worded telegram to Saunders,
  who had now returned home to his mother's house, asking him what were his
  impressions and views about the extraordinary conduct of Gabriel Gale. The
  reply came back with remarkable promptitude; and Garth came to Butterworth
  with the open telegram in his hand and a rather dazed expression on his face.
  For the exact terms of the message were:</p>

  <p>"Can never be sufficiently grateful to Gale for his great kindness which
  more than saved my life."</p>

  <p>The two doctors looked at each other in silence; and in almost as complete
  a silence got into a car and drove across the hills once more to the
  Blakeney's house, where Gale was still staying.</p>

  <p>They drove across the hilly country and descended into the wide and
  shallow valley where stood the house which sheltered that dangerous
  character, Mr. Gabriel Gale. Garth could recall, and Butterworth could
  imagine, all the irony suggested to the imagination by such a story about
  such a scene. The house of the Blakeneys stood high and plain just beyond the
  river; it was one of those houses that strike the eye as old-fashioned and
  yet not old. Certainly it was not old enough to be beautiful; but it had
  everything that recalls, to those that faintly remember them, the last
  traditions of Early Victorian lingering into Mid-Victorian times. The tall
  pillars looked so very pallid; the long plain windows looked in dismally upon
  high-ceilinged rooms; the curtains that hung parallel with the pillars were
  strips of dull red; and even from that distance the humorous Butterworth was
  certain that they had heavy and quite useless tassels. It was a strange house
  to have been the scene of an incredible crime or lunacy. It was an even
  stranger house to have been, as was alleged, the scene of a yet more
  incredible or mysterious mercy. All about it lay its ordered gardens and its
  mown or unmown meadows; its plantations of trees and deep alleys and
  shrubberies; all the things which on that wild night had been given over to
  the withering splendour of the lightning and the wind. Now the whole
  landscape was laid bare in a golden calm of summer; and the blue heavens
  above it were so deep and still that the sound of a humming fly hung there
  and was heard as far away as the skylark. Thus glittered in the sun, all
  solid and objective, the stage properties of that hideous farce. Garth saw
  all the blank and staring windows which he had last beheld streaming with
  rain and swept by the wind and the wild dance of the lunatic and his victim.
  He saw the forked tree to which the victim had been bound, still with the two
  black holes in it where the fork had pierced it, looking like the hollow eyes
  of a skull, and making the whole seem like some horned goblin. There was the
  heaped up hay, still to some extent disordered and scattered as by the dizzy
  dance of a small cyclone; and beyond it rose the high green wall of the
  unmown and standing grass of the next meadow. From the very thick of this
  mild jungle or miniature forest, a long thin line of smoke was drawn up into
  the sky; as if from a very small fire of weeds. Nothing else human or alive
  was visible in the sultry summer landscape; but Garth seemed to know and
  recognize the significance of the smoke. He sent a far halloo across the
  fields, calling out, "Is that you, Gale?"</p>

  <p>Two feet pointed skyward and two long legs upside down rose vertically out
  of the tall grass, just beyond the smoke; and waved to them like arms, as if
  according to a preconcerted science of signalling. Then the legs seemed to
  give a leap and dive and the owner of the legs came the right side up and
  rose or surged slowly out of the depths of green, gazing across at them with
  a misty and benevolent expression. He was smoking a long thin cigar: the fire
  behind the smoke.</p>

  <p>He received them and their news with no air of triumph, still less of
  surprise. Abandoning his grassy nest, he sat down with them on the
  garden-chairs which had also played their part in the mystery; and only
  smiled a little as he handed back the telegram.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said; "do you still think I am mad?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Butterworth, "I can't help wondering whether he is."</p>

  <p>Gale leaned across, showing his first eagerness, and said, "He isn't. But
  he jolly nearly was."</p>

  <p>Then he leaned slowly back again and stared abstractedly at a daisy on the
  lawn, almost as if he had forgotten their presence. When he spoke again it
  was in a clear but rather colourless tone, like a lecturer:</p>

  <p>"A very large number of young men nearly go mad. But nearly all of them
  only nearly do it; and normally they recover the normal. You might almost say
  it's normal to have an abnormal period. It comes when there's a lack of
  adjustment in the scale of things outside and within. Lots of those boys,
  those big healthy schoolboys you hear about, who care for nothing but cricket
  or the tuckshop, are bursting with a secret and swelling morbidity. But in
  this young man it was rather symbolically expressed even in the look of him.
  It was like his growing out of his clothes, or being too big for his boots.
  The inside gets too big for the outside. He doesn't know how to relate the
  two things; and generally he doesn't relate them at all. In one way his own
  mind and self seem to be colossal and cosmic and everything outside them
  small or distant. In another way the world is much too big for him; and his
  thoughts are fragile things to be hidden away. There are any number of cases
  of that disproportionate secretiveness. You know how silent boys have been
  about incredible abuses in bad schools. Whether or no it's false to say a
  girl can't keep a secret, it's often really the ruin of a boy that he can
  keep a secret.</p>

  <p>"Now in that dangerous time, there's a dreadfully dangerous moment; when
  the first connexion is made between the subjective and objective: the first
  real bridge between the brain and real things. It all depends what it is;
  because, while it confirms his self-consciousness, it may happen to confirm
  his self-deception. That young man had never really been noticed by anybody
  until Lady Flamborough happened to tell him that he had brought the bad
  weather. It came just at the moment when his whole sense of proportions and
  possibilities had gone wild. I think the first thing that made me suspect he
  was....By the way," added Gale abruptly, "what was it that made you first
  suspect <i>me</i> of being mad?"</p>

  <p>"I think," said Garth slowly, "it was when you were staring out of the
  window at the storm."</p>

  <p>"The storm? Was there a storm?" asked Gale vaguely. "Oh yes, now I come to
  think of it, there was."</p>

  <p>"But, hang it all," replied the doctor, "what else could you have been
  staring out of the window at, except the storm?"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't staring out of the window," answered Gale.</p>

  <p>"Really, my dear fellow," remonstrated Dr. Garth.</p>

  <p>"I was staring at the window," said the poet. "I often stare at windows.
  So few people ever look at windows, unless they are stained glass-windows.
  But glass is a very beautiful thing, like diamonds; and transparency is a
  sort of transcendental colour. Besides, in this case there was something
  else; and something far more awful and thrilling than a thunderstorm."</p>

  <p>"Well, what <i>were</i> you looking at, that was more awful than a
  thunderstorm?"</p>

  <p>"I was looking at two raindrops running down the pane," said Gale. "And so
  was Saunders."</p>

  <p>Seeing the others staring at him he continued: "Oh yes, it's quite true;
  as the poet says," and he recited with great and unusual gravity:</p>

  <p>"'Little drops of water, Little grains of sand, Make the soul to stagger
  Till the stars can hardly stand.'</p>

  <p>"Haven't I told you a thousand times," he continued with increasing
  earnestness and animation, "that I always find myself looking at some little
  thing, a stone or a starfish or what not, and that's the only way I can ever
  learn anything? But when I looked at Saunders, I saw his eyes were fixed on
  the same spot on the window-pane; and I shuddered from head to foot, for I
  knew I had guessed right. He was wearing a certain kind of unobtrusive
  smile.</p>

  <p>"You know that incurable gamblers sometimes bet on a race between two
  raindrops. But there is this specially about the sport; that it is abstract
  and equal and gives one a sense of impartiality. If you bet on a dog-fight,
  you may find you really sympathize with a Scotch terrier against an Irish
  terrier, or vice versa; you may like the look of a billiard player or even
  the colours of a jockey. Therefore the event may go <i>against</i> your
  sympathies; and you will realize your limitations. But in the case of those
  two crystal spheres hung in a void of transparency, there is something like
  the equal scales of an abstract justice; you feel that whichever wins might
  be the one you had chosen. You may easily, in a certain secret megalomania,
  persuade yourself it is the one you have chosen. It is easy to imagine
  oneself controlling things hung so evenly. That was when I said to him, to
  test whether I was following his train of thought, 'It makes you feel like
  God.' Did you think I was talking about the storm? Storm! Pooh! Why should a
  storm make a man think he's God? If he'd got any sense it might make him feel
  he wasn't. But I knew that Saunders was just at the delicate crisis, where he
  was half trying to believe he was. He was half trying to think he had really
  changed the weather and might change everything; and a game like that of the
  raindrops was just the thing to encourage him. He really felt as if he were
  Omnipotence looking at two falling stars: and he was the special providence
  in them.</p>

  <p>"Remember that there is always something double about morbidity; the sound
  old popular phrase said the madman was 'beside himself'. There is a part of
  him encouraging itself to go mad; and a part that still doesn't quite believe
  in the mania. He would delight in easy self deceptions, as in the raindrops.
  He would also sub-consciously <i>avoid</i>tests too decisive. He would avoid
  <i>wanting</i> to want something incredible; as that a tree should dance. He
  would avoid it; partly for fear it should and partly for fear it shouldn't.
  And I was suddenly and furiously certain, with every cell of my brain, that
  he must stop himself instantly, violently, by telling the tree to dance; and
  finding it wouldn't.</p>

  <p>"That was when I shouted to him to tell the chairs and the tree to move. I
  was certain that unless he learnt his human limitations sharply and
  instantly, something illimitable and inhuman would take hold of him in that
  very hour. He took no notice; he rushed out into the garden; he forgot all
  about the chairs; he ran up that steep meadow with a leap like that of a wild
  goat; and I knew he had broken loose from reality and was out of the world.
  He would go careering through waste places, with the storm within and
  without; and when he returned from that country walk he would never be the
  same again. He would leap and dance on that lonely road; he would be horribly
  happy; nothing would stop him. I was already resolved that something must
  stop him. It must be something abrupt, arresting, revealing the limit of real
  things; the throttling shock with which a thing comes to the end of its
  tether. Then I saw the rope and threw it, catching him back like a wild
  horse. Somehow there rose in my imagination the image of the pagan Centaur
  rearing backwards, bridled, and rampant against heaven: for the Centaur, like
  all paganism, is at once natural and unnatural; a part of nature-worship and
  yet a monster.</p>

  <p>"I went through with the whole wild business; and I was sure I was right;
  as he himself is now sure I was right. Nobody knew but I how far he had
  already gone along that road; and I knew that there was nothing for it but
  acute, practical, painful discovery that he could not control matter or the
  elements; that he could not move trees or remove pitchforks; that he could
  struggle for two hours with a rope and a pair of prongs and still be
  bound.</p>

  <p>"It was certainly rather a desperate remedy; there is really nothing to be
  said for it except that it was a remedy. And I believe profoundly that there
  was no other remedy. Anything in the nature of soothing or quieting him would
  only have made him yet more secretive and yet more swollen-headed. As for
  humouring him, it's the very worst thing to do with people who are losing
  their sense of humour. No; there was something he was beginning to believe
  about himself; and it was still possible to prove that it wasn't true."</p>

  <p>"Do you think," asked Dr. Butterworth, frowning, "that there was really
  anything in that theological imagery in the matter? Do you suppose
  <i>he</i>put it in the form that he could bring the rain and thunder because
  he was God Almighty? Of course there are cases of religious mania that are
  rather like that."</p>

  <p>"You must remember," said Gale, "that he was a theological student and was
  going to be a clergyman; and he may have brooded upon doubt and inspiration
  and prophecy till they began to work the wrong way. The worst is always very
  near the best; there is something much worse than atheism which is Satanism;
  otherwise known as Being God. But as a matter of mere philosophy, apart from
  theology, the thing is much nearer to the nerve of all thinking than you
  might think. That's why it was so insinuating and so difficult to see or to
  stop. That's what I mean when I say I had a sympathy with the young lunatic.
  After all, it was a very natural mistake."</p>

  <p>"My dear Gale," protested his friend Garth. "You are getting a little too
  fond of paradox. A young tadpole of a curate thinks he can control the skies
  and uproot trees and call up the thunder and you call it a natural
  mistake."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever lain on your back in a field and stared at the sky and
  kicked your heels in the air?" asked the poet.</p>

  <p>"Not in a public or professional way," answered the doctor. "It's not
  generally considered the best bedside manner. But suppose I did?"</p>

  <p>"If you think like that, and go back to primitive things," said Gale, "you
  will find yourself wondering why you can control some things and not others.
  After all, your legs look a long way off when you wave them in the sky. You
  can wave legs about, but you can't wave trees about. I'm not sure it's so
  unnatural, in the abstract, for a man to fancy the whole material universe is
  his own body; since it all seems equally, in one sense, to be outside his own
  mind. But when he is in hell is when he fancies it is inside his own
  mind."</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I don't bother much about all this metaphysical business,"
  said Butterworth. "I suppose I really don't understand it. I know what I mean
  by a man being outside his mind in the sense of being out of his mind; and I
  suppose you're right in saying that Saunders was morbid enough to be nearly
  out of his mind. And as for being outside his body, I know what it means in
  the sense of his blowing his brains out or his body being left for dead. And
  really, to be candid, you seem to have come precious near to knocking him out
  of his body to cure him of being out of his mind. It certainly was an
  exceedingly desperate remedy; and though it may have been defensible, I
  shouldn't much like to have to go into a law-court as an expert witness to
  defend it. I can only go by results, and he certainly seems to be all the
  better for it. But when it comes to all your mystical explanations, about how
  it is hell to have everything inside your mind, frankly I give up trying to
  follow. I'm afraid I'm rather a materialist."</p>

  <p>"Afraid!" cried Gale, as if with indignation; "<i>afraid</i> you are a
  materialist! You haven't got much notion of what there really is to be afraid
  of! Materialists are all right; they are at least near enough to heaven to
  accept the earth and not imagine they made it. The dreadful doubts are not
  the doubts of the materialist. The dreadful doubts, the deadly and damnable
  doubts, are the doubts of the idealist."</p>

  <p>"I always imagined you were an idealist," said Garth.</p>

  <p>"I use the word idealist in its philosophical sense. I mean the real
  sceptic who doubts matter and the minds of others and everything except his
  own ego. I have been through it myself; as I have been through nearly every
  form of infernal idiocy. That is the only use I am in the world; having been
  every kind of idiot. But believe me, the worst and most miserable sort of
  idiot is he who seems to create and contain all things. Man is a creature;
  all his happiness consists in being a creature; or, as the Great Voice
  commanded us, in becoming a child. All his fun is in having a gift or
  present; which the child, with profound understanding, values because it is
  'a surprise'. But surprise implies that a thing comes from outside ourselves;
  and gratitude that it comes from someone other than ourselves. It is thrust
  through the letter-box; it is thrown in at the window; it is thrown over the
  wall. Those limits are the lines of the very plan of human pleasure.</p>

  <p>"I also dreamed that I had dreamed of the whole creation. I had given
  myself the stars for a gift; I had handed myself the sun and moon. I had been
  behind and at the beginning of all things; and without me nothing was made
  that was made. Anybody who has been in that centre of the cosmos knows that
  it is to be in hell. And there is only one cure for it. Oh, I know that
  people have written all kinds of cant and false comfort about the cause of
  evil; and of why there is pain in the world. God forbid that we should add
  ourselves to such a chattering monkey-house of moralists. But for all that,
  this truth is true; objectively and experimentally true. There is no cure for
  that nightmare of omnipotence except pain; because that is the thing a man
  <i>knows</i> he would not tolerate if he could really control it. A man must
  be in some place from which he would certainly escape if he could, if he is
  really to realize that all things do not come from within. That is the
  meaning of that mad parable or mystery play you have seen acted here like an
  allegory. I doubt whether any of our action is really anything but an
  allegory. I doubt whether any truth can be told except in a parable. There
  was a man who saw himself sitting in the sky; and his servants the angels
  went to and fro in coloured garments of cloud and flame and the pageant of
  the seasons; but he was over all and his face seemed to fill the heavens.
  And, God forgive me for blasphemy, but I nailed him to a tree."</p>

  <p>He had risen to his feet in a suppressed and very unusual excitement; and
  his face was pale in the sunlight. For he spoke indeed in parables; and the
  things of which he was thinking were far away from that garden or even from
  that tale. There swelled up darkly and mountainously in his memory the slopes
  of another garden against another storm. The skeleton arch of a ruined abbey
  stood gaunt against the ghastly light, and beyond the racing river was the
  low and desolate inn among the reeds; and all that grey landscape was to him
  one purple patch of Paradise...and of Paradise Lost.</p>

  <p>"It is the only way," he kept repeating; "it is the only answer to the
  heresy of the mystic; which is to fancy that mind is all. It is to break your
  heart. Thank God for hard stones; thank God for hard facts; thank God for
  thorns and rocks and deserts and long years. At least I know now that I am
  not the best or strongest thing in the world. At least I know now that I have
  not dreamed of everything."</p>

  <p>"You look very strange," said his friend Garth.</p>

  <p>"I know it now," said Gale. "For there is one who would be here, if
  dreaming could do it."</p>

  <p>There was again an utter stillness in which the fly could be heard buzzing
  in the blue; and when he spoke again, though in the same brooding vein, they
  had an indescribable intuition that a door in his mind had stood open for an
  instant and had now again closed finally with a clang. He said after the long
  silence:</p>

  <p>"We are all tied to trees and pinned with pitchforks. And as long as these
  are solid we know the stars will stand and the hills will not melt at our
  word. Can't you imagine the huge tide of healthy relief and thanks, like a
  hymn of praise from all nature, that went up from that captive nailed to the
  tree, when he had wrestled till the dawn and received at last the great
  glorious news; the news that he was only a man?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Butterworth was looking across the table with a restrained but
  somewhat amused expression; for the poet's eyes were shining like lamps and
  he was speaking on a note not often heard in any man speaking prose.</p>

  <p>"If I hadn't got a good deal of special knowledge and experience," he
  said, rising, "I should think there was a bit of a doubt about you after
  all."</p>

  <p>Gabriel Gale looked sharply over his shoulder and the note of his voice
  changed once more.</p>

  <p>"Don't say that," he said rather curtly. "That's the only sort of danger I
  really run."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," said Butterworth. "Do you mean the danger of being
  certified?"</p>

  <p>"Certify me till all is blue," said Gale contemptuously. "Do you suppose I
  should particularly mind if you did? Do you suppose I couldn't be reasonably
  happy in a lunatic asylum, so long as there was dust in a sunbeam or shadows
  on a wall...so long as I could look at ordinary things and think how
  extraordinary they are? Do you suppose I couldn't praise God with tolerable
  piety for the shape of my keeper's nose or anything else calculated to give
  pleasure to a thoughtful mind? I should imagine that a madhouse would be an
  excellent place to be sane in. I'd a long sight rather live in a nice quiet
  secluded madhouse than in intellectual clubs full of unintellectual people,
  all chattering nonsense about the newest book of philosophy; or in some of
  those earnest, elbowing sort of Movements that want you to go in for Service
  and help to take away somebody else's toys. I don't much mind to what place I
  may wander to think in, before I die; so long as the thoughts do not wander
  too much; or wander down the wrong road. And what you said just now does
  touch the real danger. It does touch the danger that Garth was really
  thinking about, when he suggested that I had reclaimed lunatics and might
  myself become a castaway. If people tell me they really do not understand
  what I mean...if they say they cannot see so simple a truth as that it is
  best for a man to be a man, that it is dangerous to give oneself divine
  honours...if they say they do not see <i>that</i> for themselves, but imagine
  it to be some sort of mysticism out of my own head, <i>then</i> I am myself
  again in peril. I am in peril of thinking something that may be wilder and
  worse than thinking I am God Almighty."</p>

  <p>"And still I don't understand," said the smiling physician.</p>

  <p>"I shall think I am the only sane man," said Gabriel Gale.</p>

  <p>There was a sort of sequel which came to Garth's ears long afterwards; an
  epilogue to the crazy comedy of the pitchfork and the apple-tree. Garth
  differed from Gale in having a more obvious turn for the rational, or at
  least the rationalistic; and he often found himself debating with the
  sceptics of various scientific clubs and groups; finding them a very worthy
  race, often genuinely hard-headed and sometimes tending rather to be
  wooden-headed. In a particular country place, the name of which is not
  material, the post of village atheist had become vacant, so to speak, by the
  regrettable perversity of the cobbler in being a Congregationalist. His
  official functions were performed by a more prosperous person named Pond, a
  worthy hatter who was rather more famous as a cricketer. On the cricket field
  he was often pitted against another excellent cricketer, who was Vicar of the
  parish; indeed they contended more frequently on the field of cricket than on
  the field of spiritual speculation. For the clergyman was one of the type
  that is uproariously popular and successful chiefly by his proficiency in
  such sports. He was the sort of parson whom people praise by saying he is not
  a bit like a parson. He was a big, beefy, jolly man, red-faced and resolute
  of manner; still young but the father of a boisterous family of boys, and in
  most ways very like a boy himself. Nevertheless, as was natural, certain
  passages of chaff, that could hardly be called controversy, occasionally
  passed between the parson and the village atheist. There was no need to
  commiserate the clergyman upon the pin-pricks of the scientific materialist;
  for a pin has no effect on a pachyderm. The parson was the sort of man who
  seems to be rolled in layers within layers of solid substance resisting
  anything outside his own cheery and sensible mode of life. But one curious
  episode had clung to the memory of Pond, and he recounted it to Garth, in
  something of the puzzled tone in which a materialist tells a ghost story. The
  rival cricketers had been chipping each other in the usual friendly fashion,
  which did not go very much below the surface. The Vicar was doubtless a
  sincere Christian, though chiefly what used to be called a muscular
  Christian. But it is not unfair to him to say that he was more deeply moved
  in saying that some action was not Cricket than in saying it was not
  Christianity. On this and other occasions, however, he relied chiefly on
  ragging his opponent with rather obvious jokes; such as the oft-repeated
  inquiry as to how often the hatter might be expected to do the hat-trick.
  Perhaps the repetition of this epigram eventually annoyed the worthy
  freethinker; or perhaps there was something in the deeper and more positive
  tones with which the parson dealt with more serious matters, that had the
  same effect. It was with more than his usual breeziness that the reverend
  gentleman on this occasion affirmed the philosophy of his life. "God wants
  you to play the game," he said. "That's all that God wants; people who will
  play the game."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" asked Mr. Pond rather snappishly and in unusual
  irritation. "How do you know what God wants? You never were God, were
  you?"</p>

  <p>There was a silence; and the atheist was seen to be staring at the red
  face of the parson in a somewhat unusual fashion.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the clergyman in a queer quiet voice. "I was God once; for
  about fourteen hours. But I gave it up. I found it was too much of a
  strain."</p>

  <p>With these words the Rev. Herbert Saunders went back to the cricket tent,
  where he mingled with Boy Scouts and village girls with all his usual
  heartiness and hilarity. But Mr. Pond the atheist, sat for some time staring,
  like one who has seen a miracle. And he afterwards confided to Garth that for
  a moment the eyes of Saunders had looked out of his red, good-humoured face
  as out of a mask; with an instantaneous memory of something awful and
  appalling, and at the same time empty; something the other man could only
  figure to himself in vague thoughts of some flat stark building with blank
  windows in a blind alley; and peering out of one of the windows the pale face
  of an idiot.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5">V. &mdash; THE FINGER OF STONE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Three young men on a walking tour came to a halt outside the
  little town of Carillon, in the south of France; which is doubtless described
  in the guide books as famous for its fine old Byzantine monastery, now the
  seat of a university; and for having been the scene of the labours of Boyg.
  At that name, at least, the reader will be reasonably thrilled; for he must
  have seen it in any number of newspapers and novels. Boyg and the Bible are
  periodically reconciled at religious conferences; Boyg broadens and slightly
  bewilders the minds of numberless heroes of long psychological stories, which
  begin in the nursery and nearly end in the madhouse. The journalist, writing
  rapidly his recurrent reference to the treatment meted out to pioneers like
  Galileo, pauses in the effort to think of another example, and always rounds
  off the sentence either with Bruno or with Boyg. But the mildly orthodox are
  equally fascinated, and feel a glow of agnosticism while they continue to say
  that, since the discoveries of Boyg, the doctrine of the Homoousian or of the
  human conscience does not stand where it did; wherever that was. It is
  needless to say that Boyg was a great discoverer, for the public has long
  regarded him with the warmest reverence and gratitude on that ground. It is
  also unnecessary to say what he discovered; for the public will never display
  the faintest curiosity about that. It is vaguely understood that it was
  something about fossils, or the long period required for petrifaction; and
  that it generally implied those anarchic or anonymous forces of evolution
  supposed to be hostile to religion. But certainly none of the discoveries he
  made while he was alive was so sensational, in the newspaper sense, as the
  discovery that was made about him when he was dead. And this, the more
  private and personal matter, is what concerns us here.</p>

  <p>The three tourists had just agreed to separate for an hour, and meet again
  for luncheon at the little caf opposite; and the different ways in which
  they occupied their time and indulged their tastes will serve for a
  sufficient working summary of their personalities. Arthur Armitage was a dark
  and grave young man, with a great deal of money, which he spent on a
  conscientious and continuous course of self-culture, especially in the matter
  of art and architecture; and his earnest aquiline profile was already set
  towards the Byzantine monastery, for the exhaustive examination of which he
  had already prepared himself, as if he were going to pass an examination
  rather than to make one. The man next him, though himself an artist, betrayed
  no such artistic ardour. He was a painter who wasted most of his time as a
  poet; but Armitage, who was always picking up geniuses, had become in some
  sense his patron in both departments. His name was Gabriel Gale; a long,
  loose, rather listless man with yellow hair; but a man not easy for any
  patron to patronize.</p>

  <p>He generally did as he liked in an abstracted fashion; and what he very
  often liked to do was nothing. On this occasion he showed a lamentable
  disposition to drift towards the caf first; and having drunk a glass or two
  of wine, he drifted not into the town but out of it, roaming about the steep
  bare slope above, with a rolling eye on the rolling clouds; and talking to
  himself until he found somebody else to talk to, which happened when he put
  his foot through the glass roof of a studio just below him on the steep
  incline. As it was an artist's studio, however, their quarrel fortunately
  ended in an argument about the future of realistic art; and when he turned up
  to lunch, that was the extent of his acquaintance with the quaint and
  historic town of Carillon.</p>

  <p>The name of the third man was Garth; he was shorter and uglier and
  somewhat older than the others, but with a much livelier eye in his hatchet
  face; he stepped much more briskly, and in the matter of a knowledge of the
  world, the other two were babies under his charge. He was a very able medical
  practitioner, with a hobby of more fundamental scientific inquiry; and for
  him the whole town, university and studio, monastery and caf, was only the
  temple of the presiding genius of Boyg. But in this case the practical
  instinct of Dr. Garth would seem to have guided him rightly; for he
  discovered things considerably more startling than anything the antiquarian
  found in the Romanesque arches or the poet in the rolling clouds. And it is
  his adventures, in that single hour before lunch, upon which this tale must
  turn.</p>

  <p>The caf tables stood on the pavement under a row of trees opposite the
  old round gate in the wall, through which could be seen the white gleam of
  the road up which they had just been walking. But the steep hills were so
  high round the town that they rose clear above the wall, in a more enormous
  wall of smooth and slanting rock, bare except for occasional clumps of
  cactus. There was no crack in that sloping wilderness of stone except the
  rather shallow and stony bed of a little stream. Lower down, where the stream
  reached the level of the valley, rose the dark domes of the basilica of the
  old monastery; and from this a curious stairway of rude stones ran some way
  up the hill beside the watercourse, and stopped at a small and solitary
  building looking little more than a shed made of stones. Some little way
  higher the gleam of the glass roof of the studio, with which Gale had
  collided in his unconscious wanderings, marked the last spot of human
  habitation in all those rocky wastes that rose about the little town.</p>

  <p>Armitage and Gale were already seated at the table when Dr. Garth walked
  up briskly and sat down some what abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Have you fellows heard the news?" he asked.</p>

  <p>He spoke somewhat sharply, for he was faintly annoyed by the attitudes of
  the antiquarian and the artist, who were deep in their own dreamier and less
  practical tastes and topics. Armitage was saying at the moment:</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose I've seen today some of the very oldest sculpture of the
  veritable Dark Ages. And it's not stiff like some Byzantine work; there's a
  touch of the true grotesque you generally get in Gothic."</p>

  <p>"Well, I've seen today some of the newest sculpture of the Modern Ages,"
  replied Gale, "and I fancy they are the veritable Dark Ages. Quite enough of
  the true grotesque up in that studio, I can tell you."</p>

  <p>"Have you heard the news, I say?" rapped out the doctor. "Boyg is
  dead."</p>

  <p>Gale stopped in a sentence about Gothic architecture, and said seriously,
  with a sort of hazy reverence:</p>

  <p>"<i>Requiescat in pace.</i> Who was Boyg?"</p>

  <p>"Well, really," replied the doctor, "I did think every baby had heard of
  Boyg."</p>

  <p>"Well, I dare say you've never heard of Paradou," answered Gale. "Each of
  us lives in his little cosmos with its classes and degrees. Probably you
  haven't heard of the most advanced sculptor, or perhaps of the latest
  lacrosse expert or champion chess player."</p>

  <p>It was characteristic of the two men that while Gale went on talking in
  the air about an abstract subject, till he had finished his own train of
  thought, Armitage had a sufficient proper sense of the presence of something
  more urgent to relapse into silence. Nevertheless, he unconsciously looked
  down at his notes; at the name of the advanced sculptor he looked up.</p>

  <p>"Who is Paradou?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Why, the man I've been talking to this morning," replied Gale. "His
  sculpture's advanced enough for anybody. He's no end of a chap; talks more
  than I do, and talks very well. Thinks too; I should think he could do
  everything except sculpt. There his theories get in his way. As I told him,
  this notion of the new realism..."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we might drop realism and attend to reality," said Dr. Garth
  grimly. "I tell you Boyg is dead. And that's not the worst either."</p>

  <p>Armitage looked up from his notes with something of the vagueness of his
  friend the poet. "If I remember right," he said, "Professor Boyg's discovery
  was concerned with fossils."</p>

  <p>"Professor Boyg's discovery involved the extension of the period required
  for petrifaction as distinct from fossilization," replied the doctor stiffly,
  "and thereby relegated biological origins to a period which permits the
  chronology necessary to the hypothesis of natural selection. It may affect
  you as humorous to interject the observation 'loud cheers', but I assure you
  the scientific world, which happens to be competent to judge, was really
  moved with amazement as well as admiration."</p>

  <p>"In fact it was petrified to hear it couldn't be petrified," suggested the
  poet.</p>

  <p>"I have really no time for your flippancy," said Garth. "I am up against a
  great ugly fact."</p>

  <p>Armitage interposed in the benevolent manner of a chairman. "We must
  really let Garth speak; come, doctor, what is it all about? Begin at the
  beginning."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said the doctor, in his staccato way. "I'll begin at the
  beginning. I came to this town with a letter of introduction to Boyg himself;
  and as I particularly wanted to visit the geological museum, which his own
  munificence provided for this town, I went there first. I found all the
  windows of the Boyg Museum were broken; and the stones thrown by the rioters
  were actually lying about the room within a foot or two of the glass cases,
  one of which was smashed."</p>

  <p>"Donations to the geological museum, no doubt," remarked Gale. "A
  munificent patron happens to pass by, and just heaves in a valuable exhibit
  through the window. I don't see why that shouldn't be done in what you call
  the world of science; I'm sure it's done all right in the world of art. Old
  Paradou's busts, and bas-reliefs are just great rocks chucked at the public
  and..."</p>

  <p>"Paradou may go to...Paradise, shall we say?" said Garth, with pardonable
  impatience. "Will nothing make you understand that something has really
  happened that isn't any of your ideas and isms? It wasn't only the geological
  museum; it was the same everywhere. I passed by the house Boyg first lived
  in, where they very properly put up a medallion; and the medallion was all
  splashed with mud. I crossed the market-place, where they put up a statue to
  him just recently. It was still hung with wreaths of laurel by his pupils and
  the party that appreciates him; but they were half torn away, as if there had
  been a struggle, and stones had evidently been thrown, for a piece of the
  hand was chipped off."</p>

  <p>"Paradou's statue, no doubt," observed Gale. "No wonder they threw things
  at it."</p>

  <p>"I think not," replied the doctor, in the same hard voice. "It wasn't
  because it was Paradou's statue, but because it was Boyg's statue. It was the
  same business as the museum and the medallion. No, there's been something
  like a French Revolution here on the subject; the French are like that. You
  remember the riot in the Breton village where Renan was born, against having
  a statue of him. You know, I suppose, that Boyg was a Norwegian by birth, and
  only settled here because the geological formation, and the supposed mineral
  properties of that stream there, offered the best field for his
  investigations. Well, besides the fits the parsons were in at his theories in
  general, it seems he bumped into some barbarous local superstition as well;
  about it being a sacred stream that froze snakes into ammonites at a wink; a
  common myth, of course, for the same was told about St. Hilda at Whitby. But
  there are peculiar conditions that made it pretty hot in this place. The
  theological students fight with the medical students, one for Rome and the
  other for Reason; and they say there's a sort of raving lunatic of a Peter
  the Hermit, who lives in that hermitage on the hill over there, and every now
  and then comes out waving his arms and setting the place on fire."</p>

  <p>"I heard something about that," remarked Armitage. "The priest who showed
  me over the monastery; I think he was the head man there... anyhow, he was a
  most learned and eloquent gentleman...told me about a holy man on the hill
  who was almost canonized already."</p>

  <p>"One is tempted to wish he were martyred already; but the martyrdom, if
  any, was not his," said Garth darkly. "Allow me to continue my story in
  order. I had crossed the market-place to find Professor Boyg's private house,
  which stood at the corner of it. I found the shutters up and the house
  apparently empty, except for one old servant, who refused at first to tell me
  anything; indeed, I found a good deal of rustic reluctance on both sides to
  tell a foreigner anything. But when I had managed to make the nature of my
  introduction quite plain to him, he finally broke down; and told me his
  master was dead."</p>

  <p>There was a pause, and then Gale, who seemed for the first time somewhat
  impressed, asked abstractedly:</p>

  <p>"Where is his tomb? Your tale is really rather strange and dramatic, and
  obviously it must go on to his tomb. Your pilgrimage ought to end in finding
  a magnificent monument of marble and gold, like the tomb of Napoleon, and
  then finding that even the grave had been desecrated."</p>

  <p>"He has no tomb," replied Garth sternly, "though he will have many
  monuments. I hope to see the day when he will have a statue in every town, he
  whose statue is now insulted in his own town. But he will have no tomb."</p>

  <p>"And why not?" asked the staring Armitage.</p>

  <p>"His body cannot be found," answered the doctor; "no trace of him can be
  found anywhere."</p>

  <p>"Then how do you know he is dead?" asked the other.</p>

  <p>There was an instant of silence, and then the doctor spoke out in a voice
  fuller and stronger than before:</p>

  <p>"Why, as to that," he said, "I think he is dead because I am sure he is
  murdered."</p>

  <p>Armitage shut his note book, but continued to look down steadily at the
  table. "Go on with your story," he said.</p>

  <p>"Boyg's old servant," resumed the doctor, "who is a queer, silent,
  yellow-faced old card, was at last induced to tell me of the existence of
  Boyg's assistant, of whom I think he was rather jealous. The Professor's
  scientific helper and right-hand man is a man of the name of Bertrand, and a
  very able man, too, eminently worthy of the great man's confidence, and
  intensely devoted to his cause. He is carrying on Boyg's work so far as it
  can be carried on; and about Boyg's death or disappearance he knows the
  little that can be known. It was when I finally ran him to earth in a little
  house full of Boyg's books and instruments, at the bottom of the hill just
  beyond the town, that I first began to realize the nature of this sinister
  and mysterious business. Bertrand is a quiet man, though he has a little of
  the pardonable vanity which is not uncommon in assistants. One would
  sometimes fancy the great discovery was almost as much his as his master's;
  but that does no harm, since it only makes him fight for his master's fame
  almost as if it were his. But in fact he is not only concerned about the
  discovery; or rather, he is not only concerned about that discovery. I had
  not looked for long at the dark bright eyes and keen face of that quiet young
  man before I realized that there was something else that he is trying to
  discover. As a matter of fact, he is no longer merely a scientific assistant,
  or even a scientific student. Unless I am much mistaken, he is playing the
  part of an amateur detective.</p>

  <p>"Your artistic training, my friends, may be an excellent thing for
  discovering a poet, or even a sculptor; but you will forgive me for thinking
  a scientific training rather better for discovering a murderer. Bertrand has
  gone to work in a very workmanlike way, I consider, and I can tell you in
  outline what he has discovered so far. Boyg was last seen by Bertrand
  descending the hillside by the watercourse, having just come away from the
  studio of Gale's friend the sculptor, where he was sitting for an hour every
  morning. I may say here, rather for the sake of logical method than because
  it is needed by the logical argument, that the sculptor at any rate had no
  quarrel with Boyg, but was, on the contrary, an ardent admirer of him as an
  advanced and revolutionary character."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Gale, seeming to take his head suddenly out of the clouds.
  "Paradou says realistic art must be founded on the modern energy of science;
  but the fallacy of that..."</p>

  <p>"Let me finish with the facts first before you retire into your theories,"
  said the doctor firmly. "Bertrand saw Boyg sit down on the bare hillside for
  a smoke; and you can see from here how bare a hillside it is; a man walking
  for hours on it would still be as visible as a fly crawling on a ceiling.
  Bertrand says he was called away to the crisis of an experiment in the
  laboratory; when he looked again he could not see his master, and he has
  never seen him from that day to this.</p>

  <p>"At the foot of the hill, and at the bottom of the flight of steps which
  runs up to the hermitage, is the entrance to the great monastic buildings on
  the very edge of the town. The very first thing you come to on that side is
  the great quadrangle, which is enclosed by cloisters, and by the rooms or
  cells of the clerical or semi-clerical students. I need not trouble you with
  the tale of the political compromise by which this part of the institution
  has remained clerical, while the scientific and other schools beyond it are
  now entirely secular. But it is important to fix in your mind the fact
  itself: that the monastic part is on the very edge of the town, and the other
  part bars its way, so to speak, to the inside of the town. Boyg could not
  possibly have gone past that secular barrier, dead or alive, without being
  under the eyes of crowds who were more excited about him than about anything
  else in the world. For the whole place was in a fuss, and even a riot for him
  as well as against him. Something happened to him on the hillside, or anyhow
  before he came to the internal barrier. My friend the amateur detective set
  to work to examine the hillside, or all of it that could seriously count; an
  enormous undertaking, but he did it as if with a microscope. Well, he found
  that rocky field, when examined closely, very much what it looks even from
  here. There are no caves or even holes, there are no chasms or even cracks in
  that surface of blank stone for miles and miles. A rat could not be hidden in
  those few tufts of prickly pear. He could not find a hiding-place; but for
  all that, he found a hint. The hint was nothing more than a faded scrap of
  paper, damp and draggled from the shallow bed of the brook, but faintly
  decipherable on it were words in the writing of the Master. They were but
  part of a sentence, but they included the words, 'will call on you tomorrow
  to tell you something you ought to know.'</p>

  <p>"My friend Bertrand sat down and thought it out. The letter had been in
  the water, so it had not been thrown away in the town, for the highly
  scientific reason that the river does not flow uphill. There only remained on
  the higher ground the sculptor's studio and the hermitage. But Boyg would not
  write to the sculptor to warn him that he was going to call, since he went to
  his studio every morning. Presumably the person he was going to call on was
  the hermit; and a guess might well be made about the nature of what he had to
  say. Bertrand knew better than anybody that Boyg had just brought his great
  discovery to a crushing completeness, with fresh facts and ratifications; and
  it seems likely enough that he went to announce it to his most fanatical
  opponent, to warn him to give up the struggle."</p>

  <p>Gale, who was gazing up into the sky with his eye on a bird, again
  abruptly intervened.</p>

  <p>"In these attacks on Boyg," he said, "were there any attacks on his
  private character?"</p>

  <p>"Even these madmen couldn't attack that," replied Garth with some heat.
  "He was the best sort of Scandinavian, as simple as a child, and I really
  believe as innocent. But they hated him for all that; and you can see for
  yourself that their hatred begins to appear on the horizon of our inquiry. He
  went to tell the truth in the hour of triumph; and he never reappeared to the
  light of the sun."</p>

  <p>Armitage's far-away gaze was fixed on the solitary cell half-way up the
  hill. "You don't mean seriously," he said, "that the man they talk about as a
  saint, the friend of my friend the abbot, or whatever he is, is neither more
  nor less than an assassin?"</p>

  <p>"You talked to your friend the abbot about Romanesque sculpture," replied
  Garth. "If you had talked to him about fossils, you might have seen another
  side of his character. These Latin priests are often polished enough, but you
  bet they're pointed as well. As for the other man on the hill, he's allowed
  by his superiors to live what they call the eremitical life; but he's jolly
  well allowed to do other things, too. On great occasions he's allowed to come
  down here and preach, and I can tell you there is Bedlam let loose when he
  does. I might be ready to excuse the man as a sort of a maniac; but I haven't
  the slightest difficulty in believing that he is a homicidal maniac."</p>

  <p>"Did your friend Bertrand take any legal steps on his suspicions?" asked
  Armitage, after a pause.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's where the mystery begins," replied the doctor.</p>

  <p>After a moment of frowning silence, he resumed. "Yes, he did make a formal
  charge to the police, and the Juge d'Instruction examined a good many people
  and so on, and said the charge had broken down. It broke down over the
  difficulty of disposing of the body; the chief difficulty in most murders.
  Now the hermit, who is called Hyacinth, I believe, was summoned in due
  course; but he had no difficulty in showing that his hermitage was as bare
  and as hard as the hill-side. It seemed as if nobody could possibly have
  concealed a corpse in those stone walls, or dug a grave in that rocky floor.
  Then it was the turn of the abbot, as you call him, Father Bernard of the
  Catholic College. And he managed to convince the magistrate that the same was
  true of the cells surrounding the college quadrangle, and all the other rooms
  under his control. They were all like empty boxes, with barely a stick or two
  of furniture; less than usual, in fact, for some of the sticks had been
  broken up for the bonfire demonstration I told you of. Anyhow, that was the
  line of defence, and I dare say it was well conducted, for Bernard is a very
  able man, and knows about many other things besides Romanesque architecture;
  and Hyacinth, fanatic as he is, is famous as a persuasive orator. Anyhow, it
  was successful, the case broke down; but I am sure my friend Bertrand is only
  biding his time, and means to bring it up again. These difficulties about the
  concealment of a corpse...Hullo! why here he is in person."</p>

  <p>He broke off in surprise as a young man walking rapidly down the street
  paused a moment, and then approached the caf table at which they sat. He was
  dressed with all the funereal French respectability: his black stove-pipe
  hat, his high and stiff black neck-cloth resembling a stock, and the curious
  corners of dark beard at the edges of his chin, gave him an antiquated air
  like a character out of Gaboriau. But if he was out of Gaboriau, he was
  nobody less than Lecocq; the dark eyes in his pale face might indeed be
  called the eyes of a born detective. At this moment, the pale face was paler
  than usual with excitement, and as he stopped a moment behind the doctor's
  chair, he said to him in a low voice:</p>

  <p>"I have found out."</p>

  <p>Dr. Garth sprang to his feet, his eyes brilliant with curiosity; then,
  recovering his conventional manner, he presented M. Bertrand to his friends,
  saying to the former, "You may speak freely with us, I think; we have no
  interest except an interest in the truth."</p>

  <p>"I have found the truth," said the Frenchman, with compressed lips. "I
  know now what these murderous monks have done with the body of Boyg."</p>

  <p>"Are we to be allowed to hear it?" asked Armitage gravely.</p>

  <p>"Everyone will hear it in three days' time," replied the pale Frenchman.
  "As the authorities refuse to reopen the question, we are holding a public
  meeting in the market-place to demand that they do so. The assassins will be
  there, doubtless, and I shall not only denounce but convict them to their
  faces. Be there yourself, monsieur, on Thursday at half-past two, and you
  will learn how one of the world's greatest men was done to death by his
  enemies. For the moment I will only say one word. As the great Edgar Poe said
  in your own language, 'Truth is not always in a well.' I believe it is
  sometimes too obvious to be seen."</p>

  <p>Gabriel Gale, who had rather the appearance of having gone to sleep,
  seemed to rouse himself with an unusual animation.</p>

  <p>"That's true," he said, "and that's the truth about the whole
  business."</p>

  <p>Armitage turned to him with an expression of quiet amusement.</p>

  <p>"Surely you're not playing the detective, Gale," he said. "I never
  pictured such a thing as your coming out of fairyland to assist Scotland
  Yard."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps Gale thinks he can find the body," suggested Dr. Garth
  laughing.</p>

  <p>Gale lifted himself slowly and loosely from his seat, and answered in his
  dazed fashion:</p>

  <p>"Why, yes, in a way," he said; "in fact, I'm pretty sure I can find the
  body. In fact, in a manner of speaking, I've found it."</p>

  <p>Those with any intimations of the personality of Mr. Arthur Armitage will
  not need to be told that he kept a diary; and endeavoured to note down his
  impressions of foreign travel with atmospheric sympathy and the <i>mot
  juste.</i> But the pen dropped from his hand, so to speak, or at least
  wandered over the page in a mazy desperation, in the attempt to describe the
  great mob meeting, or rather the meeting of two mobs, which took place in the
  picturesque market-place in which he had wandered alone a few days before,
  criticising the style of the statue, or admiring the sky-line of the
  basilica. He had read and written about democracy all his life; and when
  first he met it, it swallowed him like an earthquake. One actual and
  appalling difference divided this French mob in a provincial market from all
  the English mobs he had ever seen in Hyde Park or Trafalgar Square. These
  Frenchmen had not come there to get rid of their feelings, but to get rid of
  their enemies. Something would be done as a result of this sort of public
  meeting; it might be murder, but it would be something.</p>

  <p>And although, or rather because, it had this militant ferocity, it had
  also a sort of military discipline. The clusters of men voluntarily deployed
  into cordons, and in some rough fashion followed the command of leaders.
  Father Bernard was there, with a face of bronze, like the mask of a Roman
  emperor, eagerly obeyed by his crowd of crusading devotees, and beside him
  the wild preacher, Hyacinth, who looked himself like a dead man brought out
  of the grave, with a face built out of bones, and cavernous eye-sockets deep
  and dark enough to hide the eyes. On the other side were the grim pallor of
  Bertrand and the rat-like activity of the red-haired Dr. Garth; their own
  anti-clerical mob was roaring behind them, and their eyes were alight with
  triumph. Before Armitage could collect himself sufficiently to make proper
  notes of any of these things, Bertrand had sprung upon a chair placed near
  the pedestal of the statue, and announced almost without words, by one
  dramatic gesture, that he had come to avenge the dead.</p>

  <p>Then the words came, and they came thick and fast, telling and terrible;
  but Armitage heard them as in a dream till they reached the point for which
  he was waiting; the point that would awaken any dreamer. He heard the prose
  poems of laudation, the hymn to Boyg the hero, the tale of his tragedy so far
  as he knew it already. He heard the official decision about the impossibility
  of the clerics concealing the corpse, as he had heard it already. And then he
  and the whole crowd leapt together at something they did not know before; or
  rather, as in all such riddles, something they did know and did not
  understand.</p>

  <p>"They plead that their cells are bare and their lives simple," Bertrand
  was saying, "and it is true that these slaves of superstition are cut off
  from the natural joys of men. But they have their joys; oh, believe me, they
  have their festivities. If they cannot rejoice in love, they can rejoice in
  hatred. And everybody seems to have forgotten that on the very day the Master
  vanished, the theological students in their own quadrangle burnt him in
  effigy. In effigy."</p>

  <p>A thrill that was hardly a whisper, but was wilder than a cry, went
  through the whole crowd; and men had taken in the whole meaning before they
  could keep pace with the words that followed.</p>

  <p>"Did they burn Bruno in effigy? Did they burn Dolet in effigy?" Bertrand
  was saying, with a white, fanatical face. "Those martyrs of the truth were
  burned alive for the good of their Church and for the glory of their God. Oh,
  yes, progress has improved them; and they did not burn Boyg alive. But they
  burned him dead; and that is how they obliterated the traces of the way they
  had done him to death. I have said that truth is not always hidden in a well,
  but rather high on a tower. And while I have searched every crevice and
  cactus bush for the bones of my master, it was in truth in public, under the
  open sky, before a roaring crowd in the quadrangle, that his body vanished
  from the sight of men."</p>

  <p>When the last cheer and howl of a whole hell of such noises had died away,
  Father Bernard succeeded in making his voice heard.</p>

  <p>"It is enough to say in answer to this maniac charge that the atheists who
  bring it against us cannot induce their own atheistic Government to support
  them. But as the charge is against Father Hyacinth rather than against me, I
  will ask him to reply to it."</p>

  <p>There was another tornado of conflicting noises when the eremitical
  preacher opened his mouth; but his very tones had a certain power of
  piercing, and quelling it. There was something strange in such a voice coming
  out of such a skull-and-cross-bones of a countenance; for it was unmistakably
  the musical and moving voice that had stirred so many congregations and
  pilgrimages. Only in this crisis it had an awful accent of reality, which was
  beyond any arts of oratory. But before the tumult had yet died away Armitage,
  moved by some odd nervous instinct, had turned abruptly to Garth and said,
  "What's become of Gale? He said he was going to be here. Didn't he talk some
  nonsense about bringing the body himself?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Garth shrugged his shoulders. "I imagine he's talking some other
  nonsense at the top of the hill somewhere else. You mustn't ask poets to
  remember all the nonsense they talk."</p>

  <p>"My friends," Father Hyacinth was saying, in quiet but penetrating tones.
  "I have no answer to give to this charge. I have no proofs with which to
  refute it. If a man can be sent to the guillotine on such evidence, to the
  guillotine I will go. Do you fancy I do not know that innocent men have been
  guillotined? M. Bertrand spoke of the burning of Bruno, as if it is only the
  enemies of the Church that have been burned. Does any Frenchman forget that
  Joan of Arc was burned; and was she guilty? The first Christians were
  tortured for being cannibals, a charge as probable as the charge against me.
  Do you imagine because you kill men now by modern machinery and modern law,
  that we do not know that you are as likely to kill unjustly as Herod or
  Heliogabalus? Do you think we do not know that the powers of the world are
  what they always were, that your lawyers who oppress the poor for hire will
  shed innocent blood for gold? If I were here to bandy such lawyer's talk, I
  could use it against you more reasonably than you against me. For what reason
  am I supposed to have imperilled my soul by such a monstrous crime? For a
  theory about a theory; for a hypothesis about a hypothesis, for some thin
  fantastic notion that a discovery about fossils threatened the everlasting
  truth. I could point to others who had better reasons for murder than that. I
  could point to a man who by the death of Boyg has inherited the whole power
  and position of Boyg. I could point to one who is truly the heir and the man
  whom the crime benefits; who is known to claim much of the discovery as his
  own; who has been not so much the assistant as the rival of the dead. He
  alone has given evidence that Boyg was seen on the hill at all on that fatal
  day. He alone inherits by the death anything solid, from the largest
  ambitions in the scientific world, to the smallest magnifying glass in his
  collection. The man lives, and I could stretch out my hand and touch
  him."</p>

  <p>Hundreds of faces were turned upon Bertrand with a frightful expression of
  inhuman eagerness; the turn of the debate had been too dramatic to raise a
  cry. Bertrand's very lips were pale, but they smiled as they formed the
  words:</p>

  <p>"And what did I do with the body?"</p>

  <p>"God grant you did nothing with it, dead or alive," answered the other. "I
  do not charge you; but if ever you are charged as I am unjustly, you may need
  a God on that day. Though I were ten times guillotined, God could testify to
  my innocence; if it were by bidding me walk these streets, like St. Denis,
  with my head in my hand. I have no other proof. I can call no other witness.
  He can deliver me if He will."</p>

  <p>There was a sudden silence, which was somehow stronger than a pause; and
  in it Armitage could be heard saying sharply, and almost querulously:</p>

  <p>"Why, here's Gale again, after all. Have you dropped from the sky?"</p>

  <p>Gale was indeed sauntering in a clear space round the corner of the statue
  with all the appearance of having just arrived at a crowded At Home; and
  Bertrand was quick to seize the chance of an anti-climax to the hermit's
  oratory.</p>

  <p>"This," he cried, "is a gentleman who thinks he can find the body himself.
  Have you brought it with you, monsieur?"</p>

  <p>The joke about the poet as detective had already been passed round among
  many people, and the suggestion received a new kind of applause. Somebody
  called out in a high, piping voice, "He's got it in his pocket"; and another,
  in deep sepulchral tones, "His waistcoat pocket."</p>

  <p>Mr. Gale certainly had his hands in his pockets, whether or no he had
  anything else in them; and it was with great nonchalance that he replied:</p>

  <p>"Well, in that sense, I suppose I haven't got it. But you have."</p>

  <p>The next moment he had astonished his friends, who were not used to seeing
  him so alert, by leaping on the chair, and himself addressing the crowd in
  clear tones, and in excellent French:</p>

  <p>"Well, my friends," he said, "the first thing I have to do is to associate
  myself with everything said by my honourable friend, if he will allow me to
  call him so, about the merits and high moral qualities of the late Professor
  Boyg. Boyg, at any rate, is in every way worthy of all the honour you can pay
  to him. Whatever else is doubtful, whatever else we differ about, we can all
  salute in him that search for truth which is the most disinterested of all
  our duties to God. I agree with my friend Dr. Garth that he deserves to have
  a statue, not only in his own town, but in every town in the world."</p>

  <p>The anti-clericals began to cheer warmly, while their opponents watched in
  silence, wondering where this last eccentric development might lead. The poet
  seemed to realize their mystification, and smiled as he continued:</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you wonder why I should say that so emphatically. Well, I suppose
  you all have your own reasons for recognizing this genuine love of truth in
  the late Professor. But I say it because I happen to know something that
  perhaps you don't know, which makes me specially certain about his
  honesty."</p>

  <p>"And what is that?" asked Father Bernard, in the pause that followed.</p>

  <p>"Because," said Gale, "he was going to see Father Hyacinth to own himself
  wrong."</p>

  <p>Bertrand made a swift movement forward that seemed almost to threaten an
  assault: but Garth arrested it, and Gale went on, without noticing it.</p>

  <p>"Professor Boyg had discovered that his theory was wrong after all. That
  was the sensational discovery he had made in those last days and with those
  last experiments. I suspected it when I compared the current tale with his
  reputation as a simple and kindly man. I did not believe he would have gone
  merely to triumph over his worst enemy; it was far more probable that he
  thought it a point of honour to acknowledge his mistake. For, without
  professing to know much about these things, I am sure it was a mistake.
  Things do not, after all, need all those thousand years to petrify in that
  particular fashion. Under certain conditions, which chemists could explain
  better than I, they do not need more than one year, or even one day.
  Something in the properties of the local water, applied or intensified by
  special methods, can really in a few hours turn an animal organism into a
  fossil. The scientific experiment has been made; and the proof is before
  you."</p>

  <p>He made a gesture with his hand, and went on, with something more like
  excitement:</p>

  <p>"M. Bertrand is right in saying that truth is not in a well, but on a
  tower. It is on a pedestal. You have looked at it every day. There is the
  body of Boyg!"</p>

  <p>And he pointed to the statue in the middle of the market-place, wreathed
  with laurel and defaced with stones, as it had stood so long in that quiet
  square, and looked down at so many casual passers-by.</p>

  <p>"Somebody suggested just now," he went on, glancing over a sea of gaping
  faces, "that I carried the statue in my waistcoat pocket. Well, I don't carry
  all of it, of course, but this is a part of it," and he took out a small
  object like a stick of grey chalk; "this is a finger of it knocked off by a
  stone. I picked it up by the pedestal. If anybody who understands these
  things likes to look at it, he will agree that the consistency is precisely
  the same as the admitted fossils in the geological museum."</p>

  <p>He held it out to them, but the whole mob stood still as if it also was a
  mob of men turned to stone.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you think I'm mad," he said pleasantly. "Well, I'm not exactly
  mad, but I have an odd sort of sympathy with madmen. I can manage them better
  than most people can, because I can fancy somehow the wild way their minds
  will work. I understand the man who did this. I know he did, because I talked
  to him for half the morning; and it's exactly the sort of thing he would do.
  And when first I heard talk of fossil shells and petrified insects and so on,
  I did the same thing that such men always do. I exaggerated it into a sort of
  extravagant vision, a vision of fossil forests, and fossil cattle, and fossil
  elephants and camels; and so, naturally, to another thought: a coincidence
  that somehow turned me cold. A Fossil Man.</p>

  <p>"It was then that I looked up at the statue; and knew it was not a statue.
  It was a corpse petrified by the curious chemistry of your strange
  mountain-stream. I call it a fossil as a loose popular term; of course I know
  enough geology to know it is not the correct term. But I was not exactly
  concerned with a problem of geology. I was concerned with what some prefer to
  call criminology and I prefer to call crime. If that extraordinary erection
  was the corpse, who and where was the criminal? Who was the assassin who had
  set up the dead man to be at once obvious and invisible; and had, so to
  speak, hidden him in the broad daylight? Well, you have all heard the
  arguments about the stream and the scrap of paper, and up to a point I have
  entirely followed them. Everyone agreed that the secret was somewhere hidden
  on that bare hill where there was nothing but the glass-roofed studio and the
  lonely hermitage; and suspicion centred entirely upon the hermitage. For the
  man in the studio was a fervent friend of the man who was murdered, and one
  of those rejoicing most heartily at what he had discovered. But perhaps you
  have rather forgotten what he really had discovered. His real discovery was
  of the sort that infuriates friends and not foes. The man who has the courage
  to say he is wrong has to face the worst hatred; the hatred of those who
  think he is right. Boyg's final discovery, like our final discovery, rather
  reverses the relations of those two little houses on the hill. Even if Father
  Hyacinth had been a fiend instead of a saint, he had no possible motive to
  prevent his enemy from offering him a public apology. It was a believer in
  Boygism who struck down Boyg. It was his follower who became his pursuer and
  persecutor; who at last turned in unreasonable fury upon him. It was Paradou
  the sculptor who snatched up a chisel and struck his philosophical teacher,
  at the end of some furious argument about the theory which the artist had
  valued only as a wild inspiration, being quite indifferent to the tame
  question of its truth. I don't think he meant to kill Boyg; I doubt whether
  anybody could possibly prove he did; and even if he did, I rather doubt
  whether he can be held responsible for that or for anything else. But though
  Paradou may be a lunatic, he is also a logician; and there is one more
  interesting logical step in this story.</p>

  <p>"I met Paradou myself this morning; owing to my good luck in putting my
  leg through his skylight. He also has his theories and controversies; and
  this morning he was very controversial. As I say, I had a long argument with
  him, all about realism in sculpture. I know many people will tell you that
  nothing has ever come out of arguments; and I tell you that everything has
  always come out of arguments; and anyhow, if you want to know what has come
  out of this, you've got to understand this argument. Everybody was always
  jeering at poor old Paradou as a sculptor and saying he turned men into
  monsters; that his figures had flat heads like snakes, or sagging knees like
  elephants, or humps like human camels. And he was always shouting back at
  them, 'Yes, and eyes like blindworms when it comes to seeing your own hideous
  selves! This is what you <i>do</i> look like, you ugly brutes! These are the
  crooked, clownish, lumpish attitudes in which you really do stand; only a lot
  of lying fashionable portrait-painters have persuaded you that you look like
  Graces and Greek gods.' He was at it hammer and tongs with me this morning;
  and I dare say I was lucky he didn't finish that argument with a chisel. But
  anyhow the argument wasn't started then. It all came upon him with a rush,
  when he had committed his real though probably unintentional killing. As he
  stood staring at the corpse, there arose out of the very abyss of his
  disappointment the vision of a strange vengeance or reparation. He began to
  see the vast outlines of a joke as gigantic as the Great Pyramid. He would
  set up that grim granite jest in the market-place, to grin forever at his
  critics and detractors. The dead man himself had just been explaining to him
  the process by which the water of that place would rapidly petrify organic
  substances. The notes and documents of his proof lay scattered about the
  studio where he had fallen. His own proof should be applied to his own body,
  for a purpose of which he had never dreamed. If the sculptor simply lifted
  the body in the ungainly attitude in which it had actually fallen, if he
  froze or fixed it in the stream, or set it upon the public pedestal, it would
  be the very thing about which he had so bitterly debated; a real man, in a
  real posture, held up to the scorn of men.</p>

  <p>"That insane genius promised himself a lonely laughter, and a secret
  superiority to all his enemies, in hearing the critics discuss it as the
  crazy creation of a crank sculptor. He looked forward to the groups that
  would stand before the statue, and prove the anatomy to be wrong, and clearly
  demonstrate the posture to be impossible. And he would listen, and laugh
  inwardly like a true lunatic, knowing that they were proving the utter
  unreality of a real man. That being his dream, he had no difficulty in
  carrying it out. He had no need to hide the body; he had it brought down from
  his studio, not secretly but publicly and even pompously, the finished work
  of a great sculptor escorted by the devotees of a great discoverer. But
  indeed, Boyg was something more than a man who made a discovery; and there
  is, in comparison, a sort of cant even in the talk of a man having the
  courage to discover it. What other man would have had the courage to
  undiscover it? That monument that hides a strange sin, hides a much stranger
  and much rarer virtue. Yes, you do well to hail it as a true scientific
  trophy. That is the statue of Boyg the Undiscoverer. That cold chimera of the
  rock is not only the abortion born of some horrible chemical change; it is
  the outcome of a nobler experiment, which attests for ever the honour and
  probity of science. You may well praise him as a man of science; for he, at
  least, in an affair of science, acted like a man. You may well set up statues
  to him as a hero of science; for he was more of a hero in being wrong than he
  could ever have been in being right. And though the stars have seen rise,
  from the soils and substance of our native star, no such monstrosity as that
  man of stone, heaven may look down with more wonder at the man than at the
  monster. And we of all schools and of all philosophies can pass it like a
  funeral procession taking leave of an illustrious grave and, like soldiers,
  salute it as we pass."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI. &mdash; THE HOUSE OF THE PEACOCK</a></h2>

  <p class="first">It happened that some years ago, down a sunny and empty
  street of suburban gardens and villas, a young man was walking; a young man
  in rather outlandish clothes and almost prehistoric hat; for he was newly
  come to London from a very remote and sleepy small town in the West Country.
  There was nothing else especially remarkable about him, except what happened
  to him; which was certainly remarkable, not to say regrettable. There
  cannonaded into him an elderly gentleman running down the street, breathless,
  bare-headed, and in festive evening dress, who immediately caught him by the
  lapels of his antiquated coat and asked him to dinner. It would be truer to
  say that he implored him to come to dinner. As the bewildered provincial did
  not know him, or anybody else for miles round, the situation seemed singular;
  but the provincial, vaguely supposing it to be a hospitable ceremony peculiar
  to London town, where the streets were paved with gold, finally consented. He
  went to the hospitable mansion, which was only a few doors down the road; and
  he was never seen again in the land of the living.</p>

  <p>None of the ordinary explanations would seem to have fitted the case. The
  men were total strangers. The man from the country carried no papers or
  valuables or money worth mentioning; and certainly did not look in the least
  as if he were likely to carry them. And, on the other hand, his host had the
  outward marks of almost offensive prosperity; a gleam of satin in the linings
  of his clothes, a glitter of opalescent stones in his studs and cuff-links, a
  cigar that seemed to perfume the street. The guest could hardly have been
  decoyed with the ordinary motive of robbery, or of any form of fraud. And
  indeed the motive with which he really was decoyed was one of the queerest in
  the world; so queer that a man might have a hundred guesses before he hit on
  it.</p>

  <p>It is doubtful whether anyone ever would have hit on it, but for the extra
  touch of eccentricity which happened to distinguish another young man, who
  happened to be walking down the same street an hour or two afterwards on the
  same sunny afternoon. It must not be supposed that he brought to the problem
  any of the dexterities of a detective; least of all of the usual detective of
  romance, who solves problems by the closest attention to everything and the
  promptest presence of mind. It would be truer to say of this man that he
  sometimes solved them by absence of mind. Some solitary object he was staring
  at would become fixed in his mind like a talisman, and he stared at it till
  it began to speak to him like an oracle. On other occasions a stone, a
  starfish, or a canary had thus riveted his eye and seemed to reply to his
  questions. On the present occasion his text was less trivial from an ordinary
  standpoint; but it was some time before his own standpoint could be ordinary.
  He had drifted along the sunny suburban road, drinking in a certain drowsy
  pleasure in seeing where the laburnum made lines of gold in the green, or
  patches of white or red thorn glowed in the growing shadows; for the sunshine
  was taking on the tinge of sunset. But for the most part he was contented to
  see the green semicircles of lawn repeat themselves like a pattern of green
  moons; for he was not one to whom repetition was merely monotony. Only in
  looking over a particular gate at a particular lawn, he became pleasantly
  conscious, or half-conscious, of a new note of colour in the greenness; a
  much bluer green, which seemed to change to vivid blue, as the object at
  which he was gazing moved sharply, turning a small head on a long neck. It
  was a peacock. But he had thought of a thousand things before he thought of
  the obvious thing. The burning blue of the plumage on the neck had reminded
  him of blue fire, and blue fire had reminded him of some dark fantasy about
  blue devils, before he had fully realized even that it was a peacock he was
  staring at. And the tail, that trailing tapestry of eyes, had led his
  wandering wits away to those dark but divine monsters of the Apocalypse whose
  eyes were multiplied like their wings, before he had remembered that a
  peacock, even in a more practical sense, was an odd thing to see in so
  ordinary a setting.</p>

  <p>For Gabriel Gale, as the young man was called, was a minor poet, but
  something of a major painter; and, in his capacity of celebrity and lover of
  landscape, he had been invited often enough into those larger landscape
  gardens of the landed aristocracy, where peacocks as pets are not uncommon.
  The very thought of such country seats brought back to him the memory of one
  of them, decayed and neglected indeed compared with most, but having for him
  the almost unbearable beauty of a lost paradise. He saw standing for a moment
  in such glimmering grass a figure statelier than any peacock, the colours of
  whose dress burned blue with a vivid sadness that might indeed be symbolized
  by a blue devil. But when intellectual fancies and emotional regrets had
  alike rolled away, there remained a more rational perplexity. After all, a
  peacock was an unusual thing to see in the front garden of a small suburban
  villa. It seemed somehow too big for the place, as if it would knock down the
  little trees when it spread its tail. It was like visiting a maiden lady in
  lodgings, who might be expected to keep a bird, and finding that she kept an
  ostrich.</p>

  <p>These more practical reflections in their turn had passed through his mind
  before he came to the most practical reflection of all...that for the last
  five minutes he had been leaning on somebody else's front gate with all the
  air of repose and finality of a rustic leaning on his own stile. Comment
  might have been aroused if anybody had come out; but nobody came out. On the
  contrary, somebody went in. As the peacock again turned its tiny crown and
  trailed away towards the house, the poet calmly opened the garden gate and
  stepped across the grass, following in the track of the bird. The darkening
  twilight of that garden was enriched by masses of red may, and altogether the
  villa had the look of being cruder and more cockney than the grounds in which
  it stood. Indeed, it was either actually unfinished or undergoing some new
  alterations and repairs, for a ladder leaned against the wall apparently to
  allow workmen to reach an upper storey and, moreover, there were marks of
  bushes having been cut or cleared away, perhaps for some new plan of
  building. Red bunches thus gathered from the bushes were stacked on the
  window-sill of the upper storey, and a few petals seemed to have dropped on
  the ladder, indicating that they had been carried up by that route. All these
  things the gaze of Gale gradually took in, as he stood with a rather
  bewildered air at the foot of the ladder. He felt the contrast between the
  unfinished house with the ladder and the rich garden with the peacock. It was
  almost as if the aristocratic birds and bushes had been there before the
  bourgeois bricks and mortar.</p>

  <p>He had a curious innocence which often appeared as impudence. Like other
  human beings, he was quite capable of doing wrong knowingly and being ashamed
  of it. But so long as he meant no wrong, it never even occurred to him that
  there could be anything to be ashamed of. For him burglary meant stealing;
  and he might have strolled, so to speak, down the chimney into a king's
  bed-chamber, so long as he had no intent to steal. The invitation of the
  leaning ladder and the open window was something almost too obvious even to
  be called an adventure. He began to mount the ladder as if he were going up
  the front steps of an hotel. But when he came to the upper rungs he seemed to
  stop a moment, frowned at something; and, accelerating his ascent, slipped
  quickly over the window-sill into the room.</p>

  <p>The twilight of the room seemed like darkness after the golden glare of
  the evening sunlight, and it was a second or two before the glimmer of light
  reflected from a round mirror opposite enabled him to make out the main
  features of the interior. The room itself seemed dusty and even defaced; the
  dark blue-green hangings, of a peacock pattern, as if carrying out the same
  scheme as the living decoration of the garden, were themselves, nevertheless,
  a background of dead colours; and, peering into the dusty mirror, he saw it
  was cracked. Nevertheless, the neglected room was evidently partly
  redecorated for a new festivity, for a long table was elaborately laid out
  for a dinner-party. By every plate was a group of quaint and varied glasses
  for the wines of every course; and the blue vases on the table and the
  mantelpiece were filled with the same red and white blooms from the garden
  which he had seen on the window-sill. Nevertheless, there were odd things
  about the dinner-table, and his first thought was that it had already been
  the scene of some struggle or stampede, in which the salt-cellar had been
  knocked over and, for all he knew, the looking-glass broken. Then he looked
  at the knives on the table, and a light was beginning to dawn in his eyes,
  when the door opened and a sturdy, grey-haired man came rapidly into the
  room.</p>

  <p>And at that he came back to common sense like a man flung from a flying
  ship into the cold shock of the sea. He remembered suddenly where he was and
  how he had got there. It was characteristic of him that, though he saw a
  practical point belatedly...and, perhaps, too late...when he did see it he
  saw it lucidly in all its logical ramifications. Nobody would believe in any
  legitimate reason for entering a strange house by the window instead of
  knocking at the door. Also, as it happened, he had no legitimate reason...or
  none that he could explain without a lecture on poetry and philosophy. He
  even realized the ugly detail that he was at that very moment fidgeting with
  the knives on the table, and that a large number of them were silver. After
  an instant of hesitation, he put down the knife and politely removed his
  hat.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said at last, with inconsequent irony, "I shouldn't shoot if I
  were you; but I suppose you'll send for the police."</p>

  <p>The new-comer, who was apparently the householder, was also fixed for the
  moment in a somewhat baffling attitude. When first he opened the door he had
  given a convulsive start, had opened his mouth as if to shout, and shut it
  again grimly, as if he was not even going to speak. He was a man with a
  strong, shrewd face, spoilt by painfully prominent eyes which gave him a look
  of perpetual protest. But by some accident it was not at these accusing eyes
  that the sleepy blue eyes of the poetical burglar were directed. The trick by
  which his rambling eye was so often riveted by some trivial object led him to
  look no higher at the moment than the stud in the old gentleman's
  shirt-front, which was an unusually large and luminous opal. Having uttered
  his highly perverse and even suicidal remark, the poet smiled as if in
  relief, and waited for the other to speak.</p>

  <p>"Are you a burglar?" asked the owner of the house at last.</p>

  <p>"To make a clean breast of it, I'm not," answered Gale. "But if you ask me
  what else I am, I really don't know."</p>

  <p>The other man came rapidly round the table towards him, and made a motion
  as if offering his hand, or even both his hands.</p>

  <p>"Of course you're a burglar," he said; "but it doesn't matter. Won't you
  stay to dinner?"</p>

  <p>Then, after a sort of agitated pause, he repeated:</p>

  <p>"Come, you really must stay to dinner; there's a place laid for you."</p>

  <p>Gale looked gravely along the table and counted the number of places laid
  for dinner. The number disposed of any final doubts he might have had about
  the meaning of this string of eccentricities. He knew why the host wore
  opals, and why the mirror had been deliberately broken and why the salt was
  spilt, and why the knives shone on the table in a pattern of crosses, and why
  the eccentric householder brought may into the house, and why he decorated it
  with peacocks' feathers, and even had a peacock in the garden. He realized
  that the ladder did not stand where it did to permit people to climb by it to
  the window, but merely that they might pass under it on entering the door.
  And he realized that he was the thirteenth man to sit down at that
  banquet.</p>

  <p>"Dinner is just coming in," said the man with the opals with eager
  amiability. "I'm just going down to fetch the other fellows up. You'll find
  them very interesting company, I assure you; no nonsense about them; shrewd,
  sharp fellows out against all this superstitious nonsense. My name is
  Crundle. Humphrey Crundle, and I'm pretty well known in the business world. I
  suppose I must introduce myself in order to introduce you to the others."</p>

  <p>Gale was vaguely conscious that his absent-minded eye had often rested on
  the name of Crundle, associated with some soap or lozenge or fountain-pen;
  and, little as he knew of such things, he could imagine that such an
  advertiser, though he lived in a little villa, could afford peacocks and five
  different kinds of wine. But other thoughts were already oppressing his
  imagination, and he looked in a somewhat sombre fashion out on to the garden
  of the peacock, where the sunset light was dying on the lawn.</p>

  <p>The members of the Thirteen Club, as they came trooping up the stairs and
  settled into their seats, seemed for the most part to be at least quite ready
  for their dinner. Most of them had a rather rollicking attitude, which in
  some took the more vivid form of vulgarity. A few who were quite young,
  clerks and possibly dependents, had foolish and nervous faces, as if they
  were doing something a little too daring. Two of them stood out from the
  company by the singularity of being obviously gentlemen. One of these was a
  little dried-up old gentleman, with a face that was a labyrinth of wrinkles,
  on the top of which was perched a very obvious chestnut wig. He was
  introduced as Sir Daniel Creed, and was apparently a barrister of note in his
  day, though the day seemed a little distant. The other, who was merely
  presented as Mr. Noel, was more interesting: a tall, stalwart man of dubious
  age but indubitable intelligence, even in the first glance of his eyes. His
  features were handsome in a large and craggy fashion; but the hollows of the
  temples and the sunken framework of the eyes gave him a look of fatigue that
  was mental and not physical. The poet's impalpable intuitions told him that
  the appearance was not misleading...that the man who had thus come into this
  odd society had been in many odd societies, probably seeking for something
  more odd than he had ever found.</p>

  <p>It was some time, however, before any of these guests could show anything
  of their quality, owing to the abounding liveliness and loquacity of their
  host. Mr. Crundle may, perhaps, have thought it appropriate in a President of
  a Thirteen Club to talk thirteen to the dozen. Anyhow, for some time he
  talked for the whole company, rolling about in his chair in radiant
  satisfaction, like a man who has at last realized his wildest vision of
  happiness. Indeed, there was something almost abnormal about the gaiety and
  vivacity of this grey-haired merchant; it seemed to be fed from a fountain
  within him that owed nothing to the circumstances of festivity. The remarks
  with which he pelted everybody were often rather random, but always
  uproariously entertaining to himself. Gale could only dimly speculate on what
  he would be like when he had emptied all the five glasses in front of him.
  But, indeed, he was destined to show himself in more than one strange aspect
  before those glasses were emptied.</p>

  <p>It was after one of his repeated assertions that these stories about bad
  luck were all the same sort of damned nonsense that the keen though quavering
  voice of old Creed got a word in edgeways.</p>

  <p>"There, my dear Crundle, I would make a distinction," he said in a legal
  manner. "They are all damned nonsense, but they are not all the same sort of
  damned nonsense. As a point of historical research, they seem to me to differ
  in rather a singular fashion. The origin of some is obvious, of others highly
  obscure. The fancies about Friday and thirteen have probably a religious
  basis; but what, for instance, can be the basis of objecting to peacocks'
  feathers?"</p>

  <p>Crundle was replying with a joyful roar that it was some infernal rubbish
  or other, when Gale, who had quickly slipped into a seat beside the man
  called Noel, interposed in a conversational manner.</p>

  <p>"I fancy I can throw a little light on that. I believe I found a trace of
  it in looking at some old illuminated manuscripts of the ninth or tenth
  century. There is a very curious design, in a stiff Byzantine style,
  representing the two armies preparing for the war in heaven. But St. Michael
  is handing out spears to the good angels; while Satan is elaborately arming
  the rebel angels with peacocks' feathers."</p>

  <p>Noel turned his hollow eyes sharply in the direction of the speaker. "That
  is really interesting," he said; "you mean it was all that old theological
  notion of the wickedness of pride?"</p>

  <p>"Well, there's a whole peacock in the garden for you to pluck," cried
  Crundle in his boisterous manner, "if any of you want to go out fighting
  angels."</p>

  <p>"They are not very effective weapons," said Gale gravely, "and I fancy
  that is what the artist in the Dark Ages must have meant. There seems to me
  to be something that rather hits the wrong imperialism in the right place,
  about the contrast in the weapon; the fact that the right side was arming for
  a real and therefore doubtful battle, while the wrong side was already, so to
  speak, handing out the palms of victory. You cannot fight anybody with the
  palms of victory."</p>

  <p>Crundle showed a curious restlessness as this conversation proceeded; and
  a much less radiant restlessness than before. His prominent eyes shot
  questions at the speakers, his mouth worked, and his fingers began to drum on
  the table. At last he broke out:</p>

  <p>"What's all this mean, eh? One would think you were half on the side of
  all the stuff and nonsense...all of you talking about it with those long
  faces."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," interposed the old lawyer, with a relish for repeating the
  logical point, "my suggestion was very simple, I spoke of causes, not of
  justifications. I say the cause of the peacock legend is less apparent than
  that of the bad luck of Friday."</p>

  <p>"Do you think Friday unlucky?" demanded Crundle, like one at bay, turning
  his starting eyes on the poet.</p>

  <p>"No, I think Friday lucky," answered Gale. "All Christian people, whatever
  their lighter superstitions, have always thought Friday lucky. Otherwise they
  would have talked about Bad Friday instead of Good Friday."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Christians be..." began Mr. Crundle with sudden violence; but he was
  stopped by something in the voice of Noel that seemed to make his violence a
  vain splutter.</p>

  <p>"I'm not a Christian," said Noel in a voice like stone. "It is useless now
  to wonder whether I wish I were. But it seems to me that Mr. Gale's point is
  a perfectly fair one; that such a religion might well actually contradict
  such a superstition. And it seems to me also that the truth might be applied
  yet further. If I believed in God, I should not believe in a God who made
  happiness depend on knocking over a salt-cellar or seeing a peacock's
  feather. Whatever Christianity teaches, I presume it does not teach that the
  Creator is crazy."</p>

  <p>Gale nodded thoughtfully, as if in partial assent, and answered rather as
  if he were addressing Noel alone, in the middle of a wilderness.</p>

  <p>"In that sense of course you are right," he said. "But I think there is a
  little more to be said on the matter. I think most people, as I say, have
  really taken these superstitions rather lightly, perhaps more lightly than
  you do. And I think they mostly referred to lighter evils, in that world of
  rough-and-tumble circumstance which they thought of rather as connected with
  elves than with angels. But, after all, Christians admit more than one kind
  even of angels; and some of them are fallen angels...like the people with the
  peacocks' feathers. Now I have a feeling that <i>they</i> might really have
  to do with peacocks' feathers. Just as lower spirits play low tricks with
  tables and tambourines, they might play low tricks with knives and
  salt-cellars. Certainly our souls do not depend on a broken mirror; but
  there's nothing an unclean spirit would like better than to make us think so.
  Whether he succeeds depends on the spirit in which we break it. And I can
  imagine that breaking the mirror in a certain moral spirit...as, for
  instance, a spirit of scorn and inhumanity...might bring one in touch with
  lower influences. I can imagine that a cloud might rest on the house where
  such a thing was done, and evil spirits cluster about it."</p>

  <p>There was a rather singular silence, a silence that seemed to the speaker
  to brood and settle even upon the gardens and streets beyond; no one spoke;
  the silence was punctuated at last by the thin and piercing cry of a
  peacock.</p>

  <p>Then it was that Humphrey Crundle startled them all with his first
  outbreak. He had been staring at the speaker with bursting eyeballs; at
  length, when he found his voice, it was so thick and hoarse that the first
  note of it was hardly more human than the bird's. He stuttered and stammered
  with rage, and it was only towards the end of the first sentence that he was
  even intelligible. "...Coming here and jabbering blasted drivel and drinking
  my burgundy like a lord; talking rubbish against our whole...against the very
  first...why don't you pull our noses as well? Why the hell don't you pull our
  noses?"</p>

  <p>"Come, come," cut in Noel in his trenchant tones, "you are getting
  unreasonable, Crundle; I understand that this gentleman came here at your own
  invitation, to take the place of one of our friends."</p>

  <p>"I understood Arthur Bailey sent a wire that he was detained," observed
  the more precise lawyer, "and that Mr. Gale had kindly taken his place."</p>

  <p>"Yes," snapped Crundle, "I asked him to sit down as thirteenth man, and
  that alone smashes your superstition; for considering how he came in, he's
  jolly lucky to get a good dinner."</p>

  <p>Noel again interposed with a remonstrance; but Gale had already risen to
  his feet. He did not seem annoyed, but rather distrait; and he addressed
  himself to Creed and Noel, neglecting his excitable host.</p>

  <p>"I am much obliged to you gentlemen," he said, "but I think I shall be
  going. It is quite true that I was invited to the dinner, but hardly to the
  house...well, I can't help having a curious notion about it."</p>

  <p>He played for a moment with the crossed knives on the table; then he said,
  looking out into the garden...</p>

  <p>"The truth is I'm not sure the thirteenth man has been so lucky after
  all."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" cried his host sharply. "Dare you say you haven't had
  a good dinner? You're not going to pretend you've been poisoned."</p>

  <p>Gale was still looking out of the window; and he said without moving:</p>

  <p>"I am the fourteenth man, and I did not pass under the ladder."</p>

  <p>It was characteristic of old Creed that he could only follow the logical
  argument in a literal fashion, and missed the symbol and the spiritual
  atmosphere which the subtler Noel had already understood. For the first time
  the old lawyer in the red wig really looked a little senile. He blinked at
  Gale and said querulously: "You don't mean to say you'd bother to keep all
  those rules about ladders and things?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure I should bother to keep them," replied Gale, "but I am sure
  I shouldn't bother to break them. One seems to break so many other things
  when one begins to break them. There are many things that are almost as easy
  to break as a looking-glass." He paused a moment, and added as if in apology:
  "There are the Ten Commandments, you know."</p>

  <p>There was another abrupt accidental silence, and Noel found himself
  listening with irrational rigidity for the ugly voice of the beautiful bird
  outside. But it did not speak. He had the sub-conscious and still more
  meaningless fancy that it had been strangled in the dark.</p>

  <p>Then the poet for the first time turned his face to Humphrey Crundle, and
  looked straight into the goggling eyes as he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Peacocks may not be unlucky; but pride is unlucky. And it was in
  insolence and contempt that you set yourself to trample on the traditions or
  the follies of humbler men; so that you have come to trample on a holier
  thing at last. Cracked mirrors may not be unlucky; but cracked brains are
  unlucky; and you have gone mad on reason and common sense till you are a
  criminal lunatic this day. And red may need not be unlucky; but there is
  something that is more red and much more unlucky; and there are spots of it
  on the window-sill and on the steps of the ladder. I took it for the red
  petals myself."</p>

  <p>For the first time in his restless hour of hospitality the man at the head
  of the table sat perfectly still. Something in his sudden and stony
  immobility seemed to startle all the rest into life, and they all sprang to
  their feet with a confused clamour of protest and question. Noel alone seemed
  to keep his head under the shock.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Gale," he said firmly, "you have said too much or too little. A good
  many people would say you were talking a lot of lurid nonsense, but I have a
  notion that what you talk is not always such nonsense as it sounds. But if
  you leave it as it is, it will be simply unsupported slander. In plain words
  you say there has been a crime here. Whom do you accuse; or are we all to
  accuse each other?"</p>

  <p>"I do not accuse you," answered Gale, "and the proof is that if it must be
  verified, you had better verify it yourself. Sir Daniel Creed is a lawyer,
  and may very properly accompany you. Go and look yourselves at the marks on
  the ladder. You will find some more in the grass round the foot of the
  ladder, leading away in the direction of that big dust-bin in the corner of
  the garden. I think it would be as well if you looked in the dust-bin. It may
  be the end of your search."</p>

  <p>Old Crundle continued to sit like a graven image; and something told them
  that his goggle eyes were now, as it were, turned inward. He was revolving
  some enigma of his own which seemed to baffle and blind him, so that the
  whole disordered scene broke about him unnoticed. Creed and Noel left the
  room and could be heard running down the stairs and talking in low voices
  under the window. Then their voices died away in the direction of the
  dust-bin; and still the old man sat with the opal on his breast, as still as
  an Eastern idol with its sacred gem. Then he seemed suddenly to dilate and
  glow as if a monstrous lamp had been lit within him. He sprang to his feet,
  brandished his goblet as if for a toast, and brought it down again on the
  table so that the glass was shattered and the wine spilt in a blood-red
  star.</p>

  <p>"I've got it; I was right," he cried in a sort of exaltation. "I was
  right; I was right after all. Don't you see, all of you? Don't you see? That
  man out there isn't the thirteenth man. He's really the fourteenth man, and
  the fellow here is the fifteenth. Arthur Bailey's the real thirteenth man,
  and he's all right, isn't he? He didn't actually come to the house, but why
  should that matter? Why the devil should that matter? He's the thirteenth
  member of the club, isn't he? There can't be any more thirteenth men
  afterwards, can there? I don't care a curse about all the rest; I don't care
  what you call me or what you do to me. I say all this fool's poetical stuff
  goes to pot, because the man in the dust-bin isn't number thirteen at all,
  and I challenge anybody..."</p>

  <p>Noel and Creed were standing in the room with very grim faces as the man
  at the head of the table gabbled on with a frightful volubility. When he
  gasped and choked for a moment with the rush of his own words, Noel said in a
  voice of steel:</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to say that you were right."</p>

  <p>"Most horrible thing I ever saw in my life," said old Creed, and sat down
  suddenly, lifting a liqueur glass of cognac with a shaking hand.</p>

  <p>"The body of an unfortunate man with his throat cut has been concealed in
  the dust-bin," went on Noel in a lifeless voice. "By the mark on his clothes,
  which are curiously old-fashioned for a comparatively young man, he seems to
  have come from Stoke-under-Ham."</p>

  <p>"What was he like?" asked Gale with sudden animation.</p>

  <p>Noel looked at him curiously. "He was very long and lank, with hair like
  tow," he replied. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I guessed he must have looked a little like me," answered the poet.</p>

  <p>Crundle had collapsed in his chair again after his last and strangest
  outbreak, and made no attempt at explanation or escape. His mouth was still
  moving, but he was talking to himself; proving with ever-increasing lucidity
  and repetition that the man he had murdered had no right to the number
  thirteen. Sir Daniel Creed seemed for the moment almost as stricken and
  silent a figure; but it was he who broke the silence. Lifting his bowed head
  with its grotesque wig, he said suddenly: "This blood cries for justice. I am
  an old man, but I would avenge it on my own brother."</p>

  <p>"I am just going to telephone for the police," said Noel quietly. "I can
  see no cause for hesitation." His large figure and features looked notably
  less languid, and his hollow eyes had a glow in them.</p>

  <p>A big florid man named Bull, of the commercial traveller type, who had
  been very noisy and convivial at the other end of the table, now began to
  take the stage like the foreman of a jury. It was rather typical of him that
  he waited for more educated people to lead, and then proceeded to lead
  them.</p>

  <p>"No cause for hesitation. No case for sentimentalism," he trumpeted as
  healthily as an elephant. "Painful business, of course; old member of the
  club and all that. But I say I'm no sentimentalist; and whoever did this
  deserves hanging. Well, there's no doubt of who did it. We heard him
  practically confess a minute ago, when these gentlemen were out of the
  room."</p>

  <p>"Always thought he was a bad lot," said one of the clerks; possibly a
  clerk with an old score of his own.</p>

  <p>"I am all for acting at once," said Noel. "Where is the telephone?"</p>

  <p>Gabriel Gale stepped in front of the collapsed figure in the chair, and
  turned his face to the advancing crowd.</p>

  <p>"Stop," he cried, "let me say a word."</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it?" asked Noel steadily.</p>

  <p>"I do not like boasting," said the poet, "but unfortunately the argument
  can only take that form. I am a sentimentalist, as Mr. Bull would say; I am
  by trade a sentimentalist; a mere scribbler of sentimental songs. You are all
  very hard-headed, rational, sensible people who laugh at superstitions; you
  are practical men, and men of common sense. But your common sense didn't
  discover the dead body. You would have smoked your practical cigars and drunk
  your practical grog and gone home all over smiles, leaving it to rot in the
  dust-bin. <i>You</i> never found out where your rational sceptical road can
  lead a man, as it has led that poor gibbering idiot in the chair. A
  sentimentalist, a dabbler in moonshine, found out that for you; perhaps
  because he was a sentimentalist. For I really have a streak in me of the
  moonshine that leads such men astray; that is why I can follow them. And now
  the lucky sentimentalist must say a word for the unlucky one."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean for the criminal?" asked Creed in his sharp but shaky
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Gale. "I discovered him and I defend him."</p>

  <p>"So you defend murderers, do you?" demanded Bull.</p>

  <p>"Some murderers," answered Gale calmly. "This one was a rather unique sort
  of murderer. In fact, I am far from certain that he was a murderer at all. It
  may have been an accident. It may have been a sort of mechanical action,
  almost like an automaton."</p>

  <p>The light of long-lost cross-examinations gleamed in Creed's aged eyes,
  and his sharp voice no longer shook.</p>

  <p>"You mean to say," he said, "that Crundle read a telegram from Bailey,
  realized there was a vacant place, went out into the street and talked to a
  total stranger, brought him in here, went somewhere to fetch a razor or a
  carving knife, cut his guest's throat, carried the corpse down the ladder,
  and carefully covered it with the lid of the dust-bin. And he did all that by
  accident, or by an automatic gesture."</p>

  <p>"Very well put, Sir Daniel," answered Gale; "and now let me put you a
  question, in the same logical style. In your legal language, what about
  motive? You say he could not assassinate a total stranger by accident; but
  why should he assassinate a total stranger on purpose? On what purpose? It
  not only served no end he had in view; it actually ruined everything he had
  in view. Why in the world should he want to make a gap in his Thirteen Club
  dinner? Why in the name of wonder should <i>he</i> want to make the
  thirteenth man a monument of disaster? His own crime was at the expense of
  his own creed, or cranky doubt, denial, or whatever you call it."</p>

  <p>"That is true," assented Noel, "and what is the meaning of it all?"</p>

  <p>"I do believe," replied Gale, "that nobody can tell you but myself; and I
  will tell you why. Do you realize how full life is of awkward attitudes? You
  get them in snapshots; I suppose the new ugly schools of art are trying to
  snap them; figures leaning stiffly, standing on one leg, resting unconscious
  hands on incongruous objects. This is a tragedy of awkward positions. I can
  understand it because I myself, this very afternoon, was in the devil of an
  awkward position.</p>

  <p>"I had climbed in through that window simply out of silly curiosity, and I
  was standing at the table like a fool, picking up the knives and putting them
  straight. I still had my hat on, but when Crundle came in I made a movement
  to take it off with the knife still in my hand; then I corrected myself and
  put the knife down first. You know those tiny confused movements one
  sometimes has. Now Crundle, when he first saw me, and before he saw me close,
  staggered as if I had been God Almighty or the hangman waiting in his
  dining-room; and I think I know why. I am awkward and tall and tow-haired,
  too; and I was standing there dark against the daylight where the other had
  stood. It must have seemed as if the corpse had lifted the dust-bin lid and
  crawled back up the ladder, and taken up his station like a ghost. But
  meanwhile my own little irresolute gesture with the half-lifted knife had
  told me something. It had told me what really happened.</p>

  <p>"When that poor rustic from Somerset strayed into this room he was what
  perhaps none of us can be, he was shocked. He came of some old rural type
  that really did believe in such omens. He hastily picked up one of the
  crossed knives and was putting it straight when he caught sight of the heap
  of spilt salt. Possibly he thought his own gesture had spilt it. At that
  crucial instant Crundle entered the room, adding to the confusion of his
  guest and hastening his hurried attempt at doing two things at once. The
  unhappy guest, with fingers still clutched round the knife-handle, made a
  grab at the salt and tried to toss some of it over his shoulder. In the same
  flash the fanatic in the doorway had leapt upon him like a panther and was
  tugging at the lifted wrist.</p>

  <p>"For all Crundle's crazy universe was rocking in that instant. You, who
  talk of superstitions, have you realized that this house is a house of
  spells? Don't you know it is chock full of charms and magic rites, only they
  are all done backwards, as the witches said the Lord's Prayer? Can you
  imagine how a witch would feel if two words of the prayer came right by
  accident? Crundle saw that this clown from the country was reversing all the
  spells of his own black art. If salt was once thrown over the shoulder, all
  the great work might yet be undone. With all the strength he could call from
  hell he hung on to the hand with the knife, caring only to prevent a few
  grains of silver dust from drifting to the floor.</p>

  <p>"God alone knows if it was an accident. I do not say it as an idle phrase.
  That single split second, and all that was really hidden in it, lies open
  before God as large and luminous as an eternity. But I am a man and he is a
  man; and I will not give a man to the gallows, if I can help it, for what may
  have been accidental or automatic or even a sort of self-defence. But if any
  of you will take a knife and a pinch of salt and put yourself in the poor
  fellow's position, you will see exactly what happened. All I say is this;
  that at no time and in no way, perhaps, could things have been precisely in
  that posture, and the edge of a knife been so near to a man's throat without
  intention on either side, except by this one particular tangle of
  trivialities that has led up to this one particular tragedy. It is strange to
  think of that poor yokel setting out from his far-off Somerset village, with
  his little handful of local legends, and this brooding eccentric and scoffer
  rushing out of this villa full of rage of his hobby, and their ending locked
  in this one unique and ungainly grapple, a wrestle between two
  superstitions."</p>

  <p>The figure at the head of the table had been almost forgotten like a piece
  of furniture; but Noel turned his eyes slowly towards it, and said with a
  cold patience as if to an exasperating child: "Is all this true?"</p>

  <p>Crundle sprang unsteadily to his feet, his mouth still working, and they
  saw at the edge of it a touch of foam.</p>

  <p>"What I want to know," he began in a resonant voice; and then the voice
  seemed to dry up in his throat and he swayed twice and pitched forward on the
  table amid the wreck of his own wine and crystal.</p>

  <p>"I don't know about a policeman," said Noel; "but we shall have to send
  for a doctor."</p>

  <p>"You will want two doctors for what will have to be done to him," said
  Gale; and walked towards the window by which he had come in.</p>

  <p>Noel walked with him to the garden gate, past the peacock and the green
  lawn, that looked almost as blue as the peacock under a strong moonlight.
  When the poet was outside the gate, he turned and said a last word.</p>

  <p>"You are Norman Noel, the great traveller, I think. You interest me more
  than that unfortunate monomaniac did; and I want to ask you a question.
  Forgive me if I imagine things for you, so to speak; it is a way I have. You
  have studied superstitions all over the world, and you have seen things
  compared with which all that talk of salt and table-knives is like a child's
  game of consequences. You have been in the dark forests over which the
  vampire seems to pass more vast than a dragon; or in the mountains of the
  werewolf, where men say a man can see in the face of his friend or his wife
  the eyes of a wild beast. You have known people who had real superstitions;
  black, towering, terrific superstitions; you have lived with those people;
  and I want to ask you a question about them."</p>

  <p>"You seem to know something about them yourself," answered Noel; "but I
  will answer any question you like."</p>

  <p>"Were they not happier men than you?"</p>

  <p>Gale paused a moment as he put the question, and then went on. "Did they
  not in fact sing more songs, and dance more dances, and drink wine with more
  real merriment? That was because they believed in evil. In evil spells,
  perhaps, in evil luck, in evil under all sorts of stupid and ignorant
  symbols; but still in something to be fought. They at least read things in
  black and white, and saw life as the battlefield it is. But you are unhappy
  because you disbelieve in evil, and think it philosophical to see everything
  in the same light of grey. And I speak to you thus tonight; because tonight
  you have had an awakening. You saw something worthy of hate and you were
  happy. A mere murder might not have done it. If it had been some old man
  about town, or even some young man about town, it might never have touched
  the nerve. But I know what you felt; there was something shameful beyond
  speech in the death of that poor clumsy country cousin."</p>

  <p>Noel nodded. "I think it was the shape of his coat-tails," he said.</p>

  <p>"I thought so," answered Gale. "Well, that is the road to reality. Good
  night."</p>

  <p>And he continued his walk along the suburban road, unconsciously taking in
  the new tint of the lawns by moonlight. But he did not see any more peacocks;
  and it may be accounted probable that he did not want to see any.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7">VII. &mdash; THE PURPLE JEWEL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Gabriel Gale was a painter and poet; he was the last person
  to pretend to be even a very private detective. It happened that he had
  solved several mysteries; but most of them were the sort of mysteries more
  attractive to a mystic. Nevertheless, it also happened once or twice that he
  had to step out of the clouds of mysticism into the more brisk and bracing
  atmosphere of murder. Sometimes he succeeded in showing that a murder was a
  suicide, sometimes that a suicide was a murder; sometimes he was even
  involved in the study of lighter occupations like forgery and fraud. But the
  connexion was generally a coincidence; it concerned some point at which his
  imaginative interest in men's strange motives and moods happened to lead him,
  or at any rate them, across the border-line of legality. And in most cases,
  as he himself pointed out, the motives of murderers and thieves are perfectly
  sane and even conventional.</p>

  <p>"I am no good at such a sensible job," he would say. "The police could
  easily make me look a fool in any practical matter such as they discuss in
  detective stories. What is the good of asking me to measure the marks made by
  somebody's feet all over the ground, to show why he was walking about, or
  where he was going? If you will show me the marks of somebody's hands all
  over the ground, I will tell you why he was walking upside down. But I shall
  find it out in the only way I ever do find out anything. And that is simply
  because I am mad, too, and often do it myself."</p>

  <p>A similar brotherhood in folly probably led him into the very baffling
  mystery of the disappearance of Phineas Salt, the famous author and
  dramatist. Some of the parties involved may have accepted the parallel of
  setting a thief to catch a thief, when they set a poet to find a poet. For
  the problem did involve, in all probability, some of the purely poetical
  motives of a poet. And even practical people admitted that these might
  possibly be more familiar to a poet than to a policeman.</p>

  <p>Phineas Salt was the sort of man whose private life was rather a public
  life; like that of Byron or D'Annunzio. He was a remarkable man, and perhaps
  rather remarkable than respectable. But there was much to be really admired
  in him; and there were of course any number of people who admired even what
  was not so admirable. The pessimistic critics claimed him as a great
  pessimist; and this was widely quoted in support of the theory that his
  disappearance was in fact a suicide. But the optimistic critics had always
  obstinately maintained that he was a True Optimist (whatever that may be) and
  these in their natural rosy rapture of optimism, dwelt rather on the idea
  that he had been murdered. So lurid and romantic had his whole career been
  made in the eyes of all Europe, that very few people kept their heads enough
  to reflect, or summoned their courage to suggest, that there is no particular
  principle in the nature of things to prevent a great poet falling down a well
  or being attacked by cramp while swimming at Felixstowe. Most of his
  admirers, and all those who were by profession journalists, preferred more
  sublime solutions.</p>

  <p>He left no family, of the regular sort, except a brother in a small
  commercial way in the Midlands, with whom he had had very little to do; but
  he left a number of other people who stood to him in conspicuous spiritual or
  economic relations. He left a publisher, whose emotions were of mingled grief
  and hope in the cessation of his production of books and the high-class
  advertisement given to those already produced. The publisher was himself a
  man of considerable social distinction, as such distinctions go today; a
  certain Sir Walter Drummond, the head of a famous and well-established firm;
  and a type of a certain kind of successful Scotchman who contradicts the
  common tradition by combining being business-like with being extremely
  radiant and benevolent. He left a theatrical manager in the very act of
  launching his great poetical play about Alexander and the Persians; this was
  an artistic but adaptable Jew, named Isidore Marx, who was similarly balanced
  between the advantages and disadvantages of an inevitable silence following
  the cry of "Author". He left a beautiful but exceedingly bad-tempered leading
  actress, who was about to gain fresh glory in the part of the Persian
  Princess; and who was one of the persons, not indeed few, with whom (as the
  quaint phrase goes) his name had been connected. He left a number of literary
  friends; some at least of whom were really literary and a few of whom had
  really been friendly. But his career had been itself so much like a
  sensational drama on the stage that it was surprising, when it came to real
  calculations about his probable conduct, how little anybody seemed to know
  about the essentials of his real character. And without any such clue, the
  circumstances seemed to make the poet's absence as disturbing and
  revolutionary as his presence.</p>

  <p>Gabriel Gale, who also moved in the best literary circles, knew all this
  side of Phineas Salt well enough. He also had been in literary negotiations
  with Sir Walter Drummond. He also had been approached for poetical plays by
  Mr. Isidore Marx. He had managed to avoid having "his name connected" with
  Miss Hertha Hathaway, the great Shakespearean actress; but he knew her well
  enough, in a world where everybody knows everybody. But being somewhat
  carelessly familiar with these noisy outer courts of the fame of Phineas, it
  gave him a mild shock of irony to pass into the more private and prosaic
  interior. He owed his connexion with the case, not to this general knowledge
  he shared with the world of letters, but to the accident that his friend, Dr.
  Garth, had been the family physician of the Salts. And he could not but be
  amused, when he attended a sort of family council of the matter, to discover
  how very domestic and even undistinguished the family council was; and how
  different from the atmosphere of large rumour and loose reputation that
  roared like a great wind without. He had to remind himself that it is only
  natural, after all, that anybody's private affairs should be private. It was
  absurd to expect that a wild poet would have a wild solicitor or a strange
  and fantastic doctor or dentist. But Dr. Garth, in the very professional
  black suit he always wore, looked such a very family physician. The solicitor
  looked such a very family solicitor. He was a square-faced, silver-haired
  gentleman named Gunter; it seemed impossible that his tidy legal files and
  strong-boxes could contain such material as the prolonged scandal of Phineas
  Salt. Joseph Salt, the brother of Phineas Salt, come up specially from the
  provinces, seemed so very provincial. It was hard to believe that this
  silent, sandy-haired, big, embarrassed tradesman, in his awkward clothes, was
  the one other remaining representative of such a name. The party was
  completed by Salt's secretary, who also seemed disconcertingly secretarial to
  be closely connected with such an incalculable character. Again Gale had to
  remind himself that even poets can only go mad on condition that a good many
  people connected with them remain sane. He reflected, with a faint and
  dawning interest, that Byron probably had a butler; and possibly even a good
  butler. The disconnected fancy crossed his mind that even Shelley may have
  gone to the dentist. He also reflected that Shelley's dentist was probably
  rather like any other dentist.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he did not lose the sense of contrast in stepping into this
  inner chamber of immediate and practical responsibilities. He felt rather out
  of place in it; for he had no illusions about himself as a business adviser,
  or one to settle things with the private secretary and the family lawyer.
  Garth had asked him to come, and he sat patiently looking at Garth; while
  Gunter, the solicitor, laid the general state of things before the informal
  committee.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Hatt has been telling us," said the lawyer, glancing for a moment at
  the secretary who sat opposite, "that he last saw Mr. Phineas Salt at his own
  flat two hours after lunch on Friday last. Until about an hour ago, I should
  have said that this interview (which was apparently very short) was the last
  occasion on which the missing man had been seen. Rather more than an hour
  ago, however, I was rung up by a person, a complete stranger to me, who
  declared that he had been with Phineas Salt for the six or seven hours
  following on that meeting at the flat and that he was coming round to this
  office as soon as possible, to lay all the facts before us. This evidence, if
  we find it in any way worthy of credit, will at least carry the story a
  considerable stage further and perhaps provide us with some important hint
  about Mr. Salt's whereabouts or fate. I do not think we can say much more
  about it until he comes."</p>

  <p>"I rather fancy he has come," said Dr. Garth. "I heard somebody answering
  the door; and that sounds like boots scaling these steep legal stairs"; for
  they had met in the solicitor's office in Lincoln's Inn.</p>

  <p>The next moment a slim, middle-aged man slipped rather than stepped into
  the room; there was indeed something smooth and unobtrusive about the very
  look of his quiet grey suit, at once shabby and shiny and yet carrying
  something like the last glimmer of satin and elegance. The only other
  seizable thing about him was that he not only had rather long dark hair
  parted down the middle, but his long olive face was fringed with a narrow
  dark beard, which was also parted in the middle, drooping in two separated
  strands. But as he entered he laid on a chair a soft black hat with a very
  large brim and a very low crown; which somehow called up instantly to the
  fancy the cafs and the coloured lights of Paris.</p>

  <p>"My name is James Florence," he said in a cultivated accent. "I was a very
  old friend of Phineas Salt; and in our younger days I have often travelled
  about Europe with him. I have every reason to believe that I travelled with
  him on his last journey."</p>

  <p>"His last journey," repeated the lawyer, looking at him with frowning
  attention; "are you prepared to say that Mr. Salt is dead, or are you saying
  this for sensationalism?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he is either dead or something still more sensational," said Mr.
  James Florence.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked the other sharply. "What could be more
  sensational than his death?"</p>

  <p>The stranger looked at him with a fixed and very grave expression and then
  said simply: "I cannot imagine."</p>

  <p>Then, when the lawyer made an angry movement, as if suspecting a joke, the
  man added equally gravely: "I am still trying to imagine."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Gunter, after a pause, "perhaps you had better tell your
  story and we will put the conversation on a regular footing. As you probably
  know, I am Mr. Salt's legal adviser; this is his brother, Mr. Joseph Salt,
  whom I am advising also; this is Dr. Garth, his medical adviser. This is Mr.
  Gabriel Gale."</p>

  <p>The stranger bowed to the company and took a seat with quiet
  confidence.</p>

  <p>"I called on my old friend Salt last Friday afternoon about five o'clock.
  I think I saw this gentleman leaving the flat as I came in." He looked across
  at the secretary, Mr. Hatt, a hard-faced and reticent man, who concealed with
  characteristic discretion, the American name of Hiram; but could not quite
  conceal a certain American keenness about the look of his long chin and his
  spectacles. He regarded the newcomer with a face of wood, and said nothing as
  usual.</p>

  <p>"When I entered the flat, I found Phineas in a very disordered and even
  violent condition, even for him. In fact somebody seemed to have been
  breaking the furniture, a statuette was knocked off its pedestal and a bowl
  of irises upset; and he was striding up and down the room like a roaring lion
  with his red mane rampant and his beard a bonfire. I thought it might be
  merely an artistic mood, a fine shade of poetical feeling; but he told me he
  had been entertaining a lady. Miss Hertha Hathaway, the actress, had only
  just left."</p>

  <p>"Here, wait a minute," interposed the solicitor. "It would appear that Mr.
  Hatt, the secretary, had also only just left. But I don't think you said
  anything about a lady, Mr. Hatt."</p>

  <p>"It's a pretty safe rule," said the impenetrable Hiram. "You never asked
  me about any lady. I've got my own work to do and I told you how I left when
  I'd done it."</p>

  <p>"This is rather important, though," said Gunter doubtfully. "If Salt and
  the actress threw bowls and statues at each other...well, I suppose we may
  cautiously conclude there was some slight difference of opinion."</p>

  <p>"There was a final smash-up," said Florence frankly. "Phineas told me he
  was through with all that sort of thing and, as far as I could make out, with
  everything else as well. He was in a pretty wild state; I think he had been
  drinking a little already; then he routed out a dusty old bottle of absinthe
  and said that he and I must drink it again in memory of old days in Paris;
  for it was the last time, or the last day, or some expression of that sort.
  Well, I hadn't drunk it myself for a long time; but I knew enough about it to
  know that he was drinking a great deal too much, and it's not a thing like
  ordinary wine or brandy; the state it can get you into is quite
  extraordinary; more like the clear madness that comes from hashish. And he
  finally rushed out of the house with that green fire in his brain and began
  to get out his car; starting it quite correctly and even driving it well, for
  there is a lucidity in such intoxication; but driving it faster and faster
  down the dreary vistas of the Old Kent Road and out into the country towards
  the south-east. He had dragged me with him with the same sort of hypnotic
  energy and uncanny conviviality; but I confess I felt pretty uncomfortable
  spinning out along the country roads with twilight turning to dark. We were
  nearly killed several times; but I don't think he was trying to be
  killed...at least not there on the road by an ordinary motor accident. For he
  kept on crying out that he wanted the high and perilous places of the earth;
  peaks and precipices and towers; that he would like to take his last leap
  from some such pinnacle and either fly like an eagle or fall like a stone.
  And all that seemed the more blind and grotesque because we were driving
  further and further into some of the flattest country in England, where he
  certainly would never find any mountains such as towered and toppled in his
  dream. And then, after I don't know how many hours, he gave a new sort of
  cry; and I saw, against the last grey strip of the gloaming and all the flat
  land towards the east, the towers of Canterbury."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said Gabriel Gale suddenly, like a man coming out of a dream,
  "how they did upset the statuette. Surely the woman threw it, if anybody did.
  He'd hardly have done a thing like that, even if he was drunk."</p>

  <p>Then he turned his head slowly and stared rather blankly at the equally
  blank face of Mr. Hatt; but he said no more and, after a slightly impatient
  silence, the man called Florence went on with his narrative.</p>

  <p>"Of course I knew that the moment he saw the great Gothic towers of the
  cathedral they would mingle with his waking nightmare and in a way fulfil and
  crown it. I cannot say whether he had taken that road in order to reach the
  cathedral; or whether it was merely a coincidence; but there was naturally
  nothing else in all that landscape that could so fit in with his mood about
  steep places and dizzy heights. And so of course he took up his crazy parable
  again and talked about riding upon gargoyles, as upon demon horses, or
  hunting with hell-hounds above the winds of heaven. It was very late before
  we reached the cathedral; and though it stands more deeply embedded in the
  town than is common in cathedral cities, it so happened that the houses
  nearest to us were all barred and silent and we stood in a deep angle of the
  building, which had something of seclusion and was covered with the vast
  shadow of the tower. For a strong moon was already brightening behind the
  cathedral and I remember the light of it made a sort of ring in Salt's ragged
  red hair like a dull crimson fire. It seemed a rather unholy halo; and it is
  a detail I remember the more, because he himself was declaiming in praise of
  moonshine and especially of the effect of stained-glass windows seen against
  the moon rather than the sun, as in the famous lines in Keats. He was wild to
  get inside the building and see the coloured glass, which he swore was the
  only really successful thing religion ever did; and when he found the
  cathedral was locked up (as was not unusual at that hour) he had a grand
  final reaction of rage and scorn and began to curse the dean and chapter and
  everyone else. Then a blast of boyish historical reminiscence seemed to sweep
  through his changing mind; and he caught up a great ragged stone from the
  border of the turf and struck thunderous blows on the door with it, as with a
  hammer, and shouted aloud, 'King's men! King's men! Where is the traitor? We
  have come to kill the archbishop.' Then he laughed groggily and said, 'Fancy
  killing Dr. Randall Davidson....But Becket was really worth killing. He had
  lived, by God! He had really made the best of both worlds, in a bigger sense
  than they use the phrase for. Not both at once and both tamely, as the snobs
  do. But one at a time and both wildly and to the limit. He went clad in
  crimson and gold and gained laurels and overthrew great knights in
  tournaments; and then suddenly became a saint, giving his goods to the poor,
  fasting, dying a martyr. Ah, that is the right way to do it! The right way to
  live a Double Life! No wonder miracles were worked at his tomb.' Then he
  hurled the heavy flint from him; and suddenly all the laughter and historical
  rant seemed to die out of his face and to leave it rather sad and sober; and
  as stony as one of the stone faces carved above the Gothic doors. 'I shall
  work a miracle tonight,' he said stolidly, 'after I have died.'</p>

  <p>"I asked him what in the world he meant; and he made no answer. But he
  began abruptly to talk to me in quite a quiet and friendly and even
  affectionate way; thanking me for my companionship on this and many
  occasions; and saying that we must part; for his time was come. But when I
  asked him where he was going, he only pointed a finger upwards; and I could
  not make out at all whether he meant metaphorically that he was going to
  heaven or materially that he was going to scale the high tower. Anyhow, the
  only stairway for scaling it was inside and I could not imagine how he could
  reach it. I tried to question him and he answered, 'I shall ascend...; I
  shall be lifted up...but no miracles will be worked at my tomb. For my body
  will never be found.'</p>

  <p>"And then, before I could move, and without a gesture of warning, he leapt
  up and caught a stone bracket by the gateway; in another second he was
  astride it; in a third standing on it; and in a fourth vanished utterly in
  the vast shadow of the wall above. Once again I heard his voice much higher
  up and even far away, crying, 'I shall ascend.' Then all was silence and
  solitude. I cannot undertake to say whether he did ascend. I can only say
  with tolerable certainty that he did not descend."</p>

  <p>"You mean," said Gunter gravely, "that you have never seen him since."</p>

  <p>"I mean," answered James Florence equally gravely, "that I doubt whether
  anybody on earth has seen him since."</p>

  <p>"Did you make inquiries on the spot?" pursued the lawyer.</p>

  <p>The man called Florence laughed in a rather embarrassed fashion. "The
  truth is," he said, "that I knocked up the neighbours and even questioned the
  police; and I couldn't get anybody to believe me. They said I had had
  something to drink, which was true enough; and I think they fancied I had
  seen myself double, and was trying to chase my own shadow over the cathedral
  roofs. I dare say they know better now there has been a hue and cry in the
  newspapers. As for me, I took the last train back to London."</p>

  <p>"What about the car?" asked Garth, sharply; and a light of wonder or
  consternation came over the stranger's face.</p>

  <p>"Why, hang it all!" he cried. "I forgot all about poor Salt's car! We left
  it backed into a crack between two old houses just by the cathedral. I never
  thought of it again till this minute."</p>

  <p>Gunter got up from his desk and went into the inner room in which he was
  heard obscurely telephoning. When he came back, Mr. Florence had already
  picked up his round black hat in his usual unembarrassed manner and suggested
  that he had better be going; for he had told all that he knew about the
  affair. Gunter watched him walking away with an interested expression; as if
  he were not quite so certain of the last assertion as he would like to be.
  Then he turned to the rest of the company and said:</p>

  <p>"A curious yarn. A very curious yarn. But there's another curious thing
  you ought to know, that may or may not be connected with it." For the first
  time he seemed to take notice of the worthy Joseph Salt, who was present as
  the nearest surviving relative of the deceased or disappearing person. "Do
  you happen to know, Mr. Salt, what was your brother's exact financial
  position?"</p>

  <p>"I don't," said the provincial shopkeeper shortly, and contrived to convey
  an infinite degree of distance and distaste. "Of course you understand,
  gentlemen, that I'm here to do anything I can for the credit of the family. I
  wish I could feel quite certain that finding poor Phineas will be for the
  credit of the family. He and I hadn't much in common, as you may imagine; and
  to tell the truth, all these newspaper stories don't do a man like me very
  much good. Men may admire a poet for drinking green fire or trying to fly
  from a church tower; but they don't order their lunch from a pastry-cook's
  shop kept by his brother; they get a fancy there might be a little too much
  green fire in the ginger-ale. And I've only just opened my shop in Croydon;
  that is, I've bought a new business there. Also," and he looked down at the
  table with an embarrassment rather rustic but not unmanly, "I'm engaged to be
  married; and the young lady is very active in church work."</p>

  <p>Garth could not suppress a smile at the incongruous lives of the two
  brothers; but he saw that there was, after all, a good deal of common sense
  in the more obscure brother's attitude.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "I quite see that; but you can hardly expect the public
  not to be interested."</p>

  <p>"The question I wanted to ask," said the solicitor, "has a direct bearing
  on something I have just discovered. Have you any notion even a vague one, of
  what Phineas Salt's income was, or if he had any capital?"</p>

  <p>"Well," said Joseph Salt reflectively, "I don't think he really had much
  capital; he may have had the five thousand we each of us got from the old
  dad's business. In fact, I think he had; but I think he lived up to the edge
  of his income and a bit beyond. He sometimes made big scoops on a successful
  play or so; but you know the sort of fellow he was; and the big scoop went in
  a big splash. I should guess he had two or three thousand in the bank when he
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," said the solicitor gravely. "He had two thousand five hundred
  in the bank on the day he disappeared. And he drew it all out on the day he
  disappeared. And it entirely disappeared on the day he disappeared."</p>

  <p>"Do you think he's bolted to foreign climes or something?" asked the
  brother.</p>

  <p>"Ah," answered the lawyer, "he may have done so. Or he may have intended
  to do so and not done so."</p>

  <p>"Then how did the money disappear?" asked Garth.</p>

  <p>"It may have disappeared," replied Gunter, "while Phineas was drunk and
  talking nonsense to a rather shady Bohemian acquaintance, with a remarkable
  gift of narration."</p>

  <p>Garth and Gale both glanced sharply across at the speaker; and both,
  observant in such different ways, realized that the lawyer's face was a shade
  too grim to be called merely cynical.</p>

  <p>"Ah," cried the doctor with something like a catch in his breath. "And you
  mean something worse than theft."</p>

  <p>"I have no right to assert even theft," said the lawyer, without relaxing
  his sombre expression; "but I have a right to suspect things that go rather
  deep. To begin with, there is some evidence for the start of Mr. Florence's
  story, but none for its conclusion. Mr. Florence met Mr. Hatt; I take it,
  from the absence of contradiction, that Mr. Hatt also met Mr. Florence."</p>

  <p>On the poker face of Mr. Hatt there was still an absence of contradiction;
  that might presumably be taken for confirmation.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, I have found some evidence corroborating the story of Salt
  starting with Florence in the car. There is no evidence corroborating all
  that wild moonlight antic on the roads of Kent; and if you ask me, I think it
  very likely that this particular joy-ride ended in some criminal den in the
  Old Kent Road. I telephoned a moment ago to ask about the car left in
  Canterbury; and they cannot at present find traces of any such car. Above
  all, there is the damning fact that this fellow Florence forgot all about his
  imaginary car, and contradicted himself by saying that he went back by train.
  That alone makes me think his story is false."</p>

  <p>"Does it?" asked Gale, looking at him with childlike wonder. "Why, that
  alone makes me think his story is true."</p>

  <p>"How do you mean?" asked Gunter; "that alone?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Gale; "that one detail is so true that I could almost believe
  the truth of all the rest, if he'd described Phineas as flying from the tower
  on a stone dragon."</p>

  <p>He sat frowning and blinking for a moment and then said rather testily:
  "Don't you see it's just the sort of mistake that would be made by that sort
  of man? A shabby, impecunious man, a man who never travels far except in
  trains, is caught up for one wild ride in a rich friend's car, drugged into a
  sort of dream of absinthe, dragged into a topsy-turvy mystery like a
  nightmare, wakes up to find his friend caught up into the sky and everybody,
  in broad daylight, denying that the thing had ever happened. In that sort of
  chilly, empty awakening, a poor man talking to contemptuous policemen, he
  would no more have remembered any responsibility for the car than if it had
  been a fairy chariot drawn by griffins. It was part of the dream. He would
  automatically fall back on his ordinary way of life and take a third-class
  ticket home. But he would never make such a blunder in a story he had
  entirely made up for himself. The instant I heard him make that howler, I
  knew he was telling the truth."</p>

  <p>The others were gazing at the speaker in some mild surprise, when the
  telephone bell, strident and prolonged, rang in the adjoining office. Gunter
  got hastily to his feet and went to answer it, and for a few moments there
  was no sound but the faint buzz of his questions and replies. Then he came
  back into the room, his strong face graven with a restrained
  stupefaction.</p>

  <p>"This is a most remarkable coincidence," he said; "and, I must admit, a
  confirmation of what you say. The police down there have found the marks of a
  car, with tyres and general proportions like Phineas Salt's, evidently having
  stood exactly where James Florence professed to have left it standing. But
  what is even more odd, it has gone; the tracks show it was driven off down
  the road to the south-east by somebody. Presumably by Phineas Salt."</p>

  <p>"To the south-east," cried Gale, and sprang to his feet. "I thought
  so!"</p>

  <p>He took a few strides up and down the room and then said: "But we mustn't
  go too fast. There are several things. To begin with, any fool can see that
  Phineas would drive to the east; it was nearly daybreak when he disappeared.
  Of course, in that state, he would drive straight into the sunrise. What else
  could one do? Then, if he was really full of that craze for crags or towers,
  he would find himself leaving the last towers behind and driving into flatter
  and flatter places; for that road leads down into Thanet. What would he do?
  He must make for the chalk cliffs that look down at least on sea and sand;
  but I fancy he would want to look down on people, too; just as he might have
  looked down on the people of Canterbury from the cathedral tower....I know
  that south-eastern road...."</p>

  <p>Then he faced them solemnly and, like one uttering a sacred mystery, said,
  "Margate."</p>

  <p>"And why?" asked the staring Garth.</p>

  <p>"A form of suicide, I suppose," said the solicitor dryly. "What could a
  man of that sort want to do at Margate except commit suicide?"</p>

  <p>"What could any man want at Margate except suicide?" asked Dr. Garth, who
  had a prejudice against such social resorts.</p>

  <p>"A good many millions of God's images go there simply for fun," said Gale;
  "but it remains to be shown why one of them should be Phineas Salt...there
  are possibilities...those black crawling masses seen from the white cliffs
  might be a sort of vision for a pessimist; possibly a dreadful destructive
  vision of shutting the gates in the cliffs and inundating them all in the
  ancient awful sea...or could he have some cranky notion of making Margate
  glorious by his creative or destructive acts; changing the very sound of the
  name, making it heroic or tragic for ever? There have been such notions in
  such men...but wherever this wild road leads I am sure it ends in
  Margate."</p>

  <p>The worthy tradesman of Croydon was the first to get to his feet after
  Gale had risen, and he fingered the lapels of his outlandish coat with all
  his native embarrassment. "I'm afraid all this is beyond me, gentlemen," he
  said, "gargoyles and dragons and pessimists and such are not in my line. But
  it does seem that the police have got a clue that points down the Margate
  road; and if you ask me, I think we'd better discuss this matter again when
  the police have investigated a little more."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Salt is perfectly right," said the lawyer heartily. "See what it is
  to have a business man to bring us back to business. I will go and make some
  more inquiries; and soon, perhaps, I may have a little more to tell you."</p>

  <p>If Gabriel Gale was, and felt himself to be, an incongruous figure in the
  severe framework of leather and parchment, of law and commerce, represented
  by the office of Mr. Gunter, it might well have been supposed that he would
  feel even more of a fish out of water in the scene of the second family
  council. For it was held at the new head-quarters of the family, or all that
  remained of the family; the little shop in Croydon over which the lost poet's
  very prosaic brother was presiding with a mixture of the bustle of a new
  business and the last lingering formalities of a funeral. Mr. J. Salt's
  suburban shop was a very suburban shop. It was a shop for selling
  confectionery and sweetmeats and similar things; with a sort of sideshow of
  very mild refreshments, served on little round shiny tables and apparently
  chiefly consisting of pale green lemonade. The cakes and sweets were arranged
  in decorative patterns in the window, to attract the eye of Croydon youth,
  and as the building consisted chiefly of windows, it seemed full of a sort of
  cold and discolouring light. A parlour behind, full of neat but illogical
  knicknacks and mementoes, was not without a sampler, a testimonial from a
  Provident Society and a portrait of George V. But it was never easy to
  predict in what place or circumstances Mr. Gale would find a certain
  intellectual interest. He generally looked at objects, not objectively in the
  sense of seeing them as themselves, but in connexion with some curious trains
  of thought of his own; and, for some reason or other, he seemed to take quite
  a friendly interest in Mr. Salt's suburban shop. Indeed, he seemed to take
  more interest in this novel scene than in the older and more serious problem
  which he had come there to solve. He gazed entranced at the china dogs and
  pink pincushions on the parlour mantelpiece; he was with difficulty drawn
  away from a rapt contemplation of the diamond pattern of lemon-drops and
  raspberry-drops which decorated the window; and he looked even at the
  lemonade as if it were as important as that pale green wine of wormwood,
  which had apparently played a real part in the tragedy of Phineas Salt.</p>

  <p>He had been indeed unusually cheerful all the morning, possibly because it
  was a beautiful day, possibly for more personal reasons; and had drawn near
  to the rendezvous through the trim suburban avenues with a step of unusual
  animation. He saw the worthy confectioner himself, stepping out of a villa of
  a social shade faintly superior to his own; a young woman with a crown of
  braided brown hair, and a good grave face, came with him down the garden
  path. Gale had little difficulty in identifying the young lady interested in
  church work. The poet gazed at the pale squares of lawn and the few thin and
  dwarfish trees with quite a sentimental interest, almost as if it were a
  romance of his own; nor did his universal good humour fail him even when he
  encountered, a few lamp-posts further down the road, the saturnine and
  somewhat unsympathetic countenance of Mr. Hiram Hatt. The lover was still
  lingering at the garden gate, after the fashion of his kind, and Hatt and
  Gale walked more briskly ahead of him towards his home. To Hatt the poet made
  the somewhat irrelevant remark: "Do you understand that desire to be one of
  the lovers of Cleopatra?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Hatt, the secretary, indicated that, had he nourished such a desire,
  his appearance on the historical scene would have lacked something of true
  American hustle and punctuality.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there are plenty of Cleopatras still," answered Gale; "and plenty of
  people who have that strange notion of being the hundredth husband of an
  Egyptian cat. What could have made a man of real intellect, like that
  fellow's brother, break himself all up for a woman like Hertha Hathaway?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm all with you there," said Hatt. "I didn't say anything about
  the woman, because it wasn't my business; but I tell you, sir, she was just
  blue ruin and vitriol. Only the fact that I didn't mention her seems to have
  set your friend the solicitor off on another dance of dark suspicions. I
  swear he fancies she and I were mixed up in something; and probably had to do
  with the disappearance of Phineas Salt."</p>

  <p>Gale looked hard at the man's hard face for a moment and then said
  irrelevantly: "Would it surprise you to find him at Margate?"</p>

  <p>"No; nor anywhere else," replied Hatt. "He was restless just then and
  drifted about into the commonest crowds. He did no work lately; sometimes sat
  and stared at a blank sheet of paper as if he had no ideas."</p>

  <p>"Or as if he had too many," said Gabriel Gale.</p>

  <p>With that they turned in at the confectioner's door: and found Dr. Garth
  already in the outer shop, having only that moment arrived. But when they
  penetrated to the parlour, they came on a figure that gave them,
  indescribably, a cold shock of sobriety. The lawyer was already seated in
  that gimcrack room, resolutely and rather rudely, with his top hat on his
  head, like a bailiff in possession; but they all sensed something more
  sinister, as of the bearer of the bowstring.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mr. Joseph Salt?" he asked. "He said he would be home at
  eleven."</p>

  <p>Gale smiled faintly and began to fiddle with the funny little ornaments on
  the mantelpiece. "He is saying farewell," he said. "Sometimes it is rather a
  long word to say."</p>

  <p>"We must begin without him," said Gunter. "Perhaps it is just as
  well."</p>

  <p>"You mean you have bad news for him?" asked the doctor, lowering his
  voice. "Have you the last news of his brother?"</p>

  <p>"I believe it may fairly be called the last news," answered the lawyer
  dryly. "In the light of the latest discoveries...Mr. Gale, I should be much
  obliged if you would leave off fidgeting with those ornaments and sit down.
  There is something that somebody has got to explain."</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Gale rather hazily. "Isn't <i>this</i> what he has got to
  explain?"</p>

  <p>He picked up something from the mantelpiece and put it on the central
  table. It was a very absurd object to be stared at thus, as an exhibit in a
  grim museum of suicide or crime. It was a cheap, childish, pink and white
  mug, inscribed in large purple letters, "A Present from Margate."</p>

  <p>"There is a date inside," said Gale, looking down dreamily into the depths
  of this remarkable receptacle. "This year. And we're still at the beginning
  of the year, you know."</p>

  <p>"Well, it may be one of the things," said the solicitor. "But I have got
  some other Presents from Margate."</p>

  <p>He took a sheaf of papers from his breast-pocket and laid them out
  thoughtfully on the table before he spoke.</p>

  <p>"Understand, to begin with, that there really is a riddle and the man
  really has vanished. Don't imagine a man can easily melt into a modern crowd;
  the police have traced his car on the road and could have traced him, if he
  had left it. Don't imagine anybody can simply drive down country roads
  throwing corpses out of cars. There are always a lot of fussy people about,
  who notice a little thing like that. Whatever he did, sooner or later the
  explanation would probably be found; and we have found it."</p>

  <p>Gale put down the mug abruptly and stared across, still open-mouthed, but
  as it were more dry-throated, coughing and stammering now with a real
  eagerness.</p>

  <p>"Have you really found out?" he asked. "Do you know all about the Purple
  Jewel?"</p>

  <p>"Look here!" cried the doctor, as if with a generous indignation; "this is
  getting too thick. I don't mind being in a mystery, but it needn't be a
  melodrama. Don't say that we are after the Rajah's Ruby. Don't say, oh, don't
  say, that it is in the eye of the god Vishnu."</p>

  <p>"No," replied the poet. "It is in the eye of the Beholder."</p>

  <p>"And who's he?" asked Gunter. "I don't know exactly what you're talking
  about, but there may have been a theft involved. Anyhow, there was more than
  a theft."</p>

  <p>He sorted out from his papers two or three photographs of the sort that
  are taken casually with hand-cameras in a holiday crowd. As he did so he
  said:</p>

  <p>"Our investigations at Margate have not been fruitless; in fact they have
  been rather fruitful. We have found a witness, a photographer on Margate
  beach, who testifies to having seen a man corresponding to Phineas Salt,
  burly and with a big red beard and long hair, who stood for some time on an
  isolated crag of white chalk, which stands out from the cliff, and looked
  down at the crowds below. Then he descended by a rude stairway cut in the
  chalk and, crossing a crowded part of the beach, spoke to another man who
  seemed to be an ordinary clerk or commonplace holiday-maker; and, after a
  little talk, they went up to the row of bathing-sheds, apparently for the
  purpose of having a dip in the sea. My informant thinks they did go into the
  sea; but cannot be quite so certain. What he is quite certain of is that he
  never saw the red-bearded man again, though he did see the common-place
  clean-shaven man, both when he returned in his bathing-suit and when he
  resumed his ordinary, his very ordinary, clothes. He not only saw him, but he
  actually took a snapshot of him, and there he is."</p>

  <p>He handed the photograph to Garth, who gazed at it with slowly rising
  eyebrows. The photograph represented a sturdy man with a bulldog jaw but
  rather blank eyes, with his head lifted, apparently staring out to sea. He
  wore very light holiday clothes, but of a clumsy, unfashionable cut; and, so
  far as he could be seen under the abrupt shadow and rather too jaunty angle
  of his stiff straw hat, his hair was of some light colour. Only, as it
  happened, the doctor had no need to wait for the development of colour
  photography. For he knew exactly what colour it was. He knew it was a sort of
  sandy red; he had often seen it, not in the photograph, but on the head where
  it grew. For the man in the stiff straw hat was most unmistakably Mr. Joseph
  Salt, the worthy confectioner and new social ornament to the suburb of
  Croydon.</p>

  <p>"So Phineas went down to Margate to meet his brother," said Garth. "After
  all, that's natural enough in one way. Margate is exactly the sort of place
  his brother would go to."</p>

  <p>"Yes; Joseph went there on one of those motor-charabanc expeditions, with
  a whole crowd of other trippers, and he seems to have returned the same night
  on the same vehicle. But nobody knows when, where or <i>if</i> his brother
  Phineas returned."</p>

  <p>"I rather gather from your tone," said Garth very gravely, "that you think
  his brother Phineas never did return."</p>

  <p>"I think his brother never will return," said the lawyer, "unless it
  happens (by a curious coincidence) that he was drowned while bathing and his
  body is some day washed up on the shore. But there's a strong current running
  just there that would carry it far away."</p>

  <p>"The plot thickens, certainly," said the doctor. "All this bathing
  business seems to complicate things rather."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," said the lawyer, "that it simplifies them very much."</p>

  <p>"What," asked Garth sharply. "Simplifies?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the other, gripping the arms of his chair and rising abruptly
  to his feet. "I think this story is as simple as the story of Cain and Abel.
  And rather like it".</p>

  <p>There was a shocked silence, which was at length broken by Gale, who was
  peering into the Present from Margate, crying or almost crowing, in the
  manner of a child.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it a funny little mug! He must have bought it before he came back
  in the charabanc. Such a jolly thing to buy, when you have just murdered your
  own brother."</p>

  <p>"It does seem a queer business," said Dr. Garth frowning. "I suppose one
  might work out some explanation of how he did it. I suppose a man might drown
  another man while they were bathing, even off a crowded beach like that. But
  I'm damned if I can understand why he did it. Have you discovered a motive as
  well as a murder?"</p>

  <p>"The motive is old enough and I think obvious enough," answered Gunter.
  "We have in this case all the necessary elements of a hatred, of that slow
  and corroding sort that is founded on jealousy. Here you had two brothers,
  sons of the same insignificant Midland tradesman; having the same education,
  environment, opportunities; very nearly of an age, very much of one type,
  even of one physical type, rugged, red-haired, rather plain and heavy, until
  Phineas made himself a spectacle with that big Bolshevist beard and bush of
  hair; not so different in youth but that they must have had ordinary
  rivalries and quarrels on fairly equal terms. And then see the sequel. One of
  them fills the world with his name, wears a laurel like the crown of Petrach,
  dines with kings and emperors and is worshipped by women like a hero on the
  films. The other...isn't it enough to say that the other has had to go on
  slaving all his life in a room like this?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you like the room?" inquired Gale with the same simple eagerness.
  "Why, I think some of the ornaments are so nice!"</p>

  <p>"It is not yet quite clear," went on Gunter, ignoring him, "how the
  pastry-cook lured the poet down to Margate and a dip in the sea. But the poet
  was admittedly rather random in his movements just then, and too restless to
  work; and we have no reason to suppose that he knew of the fraternal hatred
  or that he in any way reciprocated it. I don't think there would be much
  difficulty in swimming with a man beyond the crowd of bathers and holding him
  under water, till you could send his body adrift on a current flowing away
  from the shore. Then he went back and dressed and calmly took his place in
  the charabanc."</p>

  <p>"Don't forget the dear little mug," said Gale softly. "He stopped to buy
  that and then went home. Well, it's a very able and thorough explanation and
  reconstruction of the crime, my dear Gunter, and I congratulate you. Even the
  best achievements have some little flaw; and there's only one trifling
  mistake in yours. You've got it the wrong way round."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" asked the other quickly.</p>

  <p>"Quite a small correction," explained Gale. "You think that Joseph was
  jealous of Phineas. As a matter of fact, Phineas was jealous of Joseph."</p>

  <p>"My dear Gale, you are simply playing the goat," said the doctor very
  sharply and impatiently. "And let me tell you I don't think it's a decent
  occasion for doing it. I know all about your jokes and fancies and paradoxes,
  but we're all in a damned hard position, sitting here in the man's own house,
  and knowing we're in the house of a murderer."</p>

  <p>"I know...it's simply infernal," said Gunter, his stiffness shaken for the
  first time; and he looked up with a shrinking jerk, as if he half expected to
  see the rope hanging from that dull and dusty ceiling.</p>

  <p>At the same moment the door was thrown open and the man they had convicted
  of murder stood in the room. His eyes were bright like a child's over a new
  toy, his face was flushed to the roots of his fiery hair, his broad shoulders
  were squared backwards like a soldier's; and in the lapel of his coat was a
  large purple flower, of a colour that Gale remembered in the garden-beds of
  the house down the road. Gale had no difficulty in guessing the reason of
  this triumphant entry.</p>

  <p>Then the man with the buttonhole saw the tragic faces on the other side of
  the table and stopped, staring.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said at last, in a rather curious tone. "What about your
  search?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer was about to open his locked lips with some such question as
  was once asked of Cain by the voice out of the cloud, when Gale interrupted
  him by flinging himself backwards in a chair and emitting a short but cheery
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"I've given up the search," said Gale gaily. "No need to bother myself
  about that any more."</p>

  <p>"Because you know you will never find Phineas Salt," said the tradesman
  steadily.</p>

  <p>"Because I have found him," said Gabriel Gale. Dr. Garth got to his feet
  quickly and remained staring at them with bright eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Gale, "because I am talking to him." And he smiled across at
  his host, as if he had just been introduced.</p>

  <p>Then he said rather more gravely: "Will you tell us all about it, Mr.
  Phineas Salt? Or must I guess it for you all the way through?"</p>

  <p>There was a heavy silence.</p>

  <p>"You tell the story," said the shopkeeeper at last. "I am quite sure you
  know all about it."</p>

  <p>"I only know about it," answered Gale gently, "because I think I should
  have done the same thing myself. It's what some call having a sympathy with
  lunatics...including literary men."</p>

  <p>"Hold on for a moment," interposed the staring Mr. Gunter. "Before you get
  too literary, am I to understand that this gentleman who owns this shop,
  actually is the poet, Phineas Salt? In that case, where is his brother?"</p>

  <p>"Making the Grand Tour, I imagine," said Gale. "Gone abroad for a holiday,
  anyhow; a holiday which will be not the less enjoyable for the two thousand
  five hundred pounds that his brother gave him to enjoy himself with. His
  slipping away was easy enough; he only swam a little bit further along the
  shore to where they had left another suit of clothes. Meanwhile our friend
  here went back and shaved off his beard and effected the change of appearance
  in the bathing-tent. He was quite sufficiently like his brother to go back
  with a crowd of strangers. And then, you will doubtless note, he opened a new
  shop in an entirely new neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>"But <i>why?</i>" cried Garth in a sort of exasperation. "In the name of
  all the saints and angels, why? That's what I can't make any sense of."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you why," said Gabriel Gale, "but you won't make any sense of
  it."</p>

  <p>He stared at the mug on the table for a moment and then said: "This is
  what you would call a nonsense story; and you can only understand it by
  understanding nonsense; or, as some politely call it, poetry. The poet
  Phineas Salt was a man who had made himself master of everything, in a sort
  of frenzy of freedom and omnipotence. He had tried to feel everything,
  experience everything, imagine everything that could be or could not be. And
  he found, as all such men have found, that that illimitable liberty is itself
  a limit. It is like the circle, which is at once an eternity and a prison. He
  not only wanted to do everything. He wanted to be everybody. To the Pantheist
  God is everybody: to the Christian He is also Somebody. But this sort of
  Pantheist will not narrow himself by a choice. To want everything is to will
  nothing. Mr. Hatt here told me that Phineas would sit staring at a blank
  sheet of paper; and I told him it was not because he had nothing to write
  about, but because he could write about anything. When he stood on that cliff
  and looked down on that mazy crowd, so common and yet so complex, he felt he
  could write ten thousand tales and then that he could write none; because
  there was no reason to choose one more than another.</p>

  <p>"Well, what is the step beyond that? What comes next? I tell you there are
  only two steps possible after that. One is the step over the cliff; to cease
  to be. The other is to <i>be</i> somebody, instead of writing about
  everybody. It is to become incarnate as one real human being in that crowd;
  to begin all over again as a real person. Unless a man be born again...</p>

  <p>"He tried it and found that this was what he wanted; the things he had not
  known since childhood; the silly little lower middle-class things; to have to
  do with lollipops and ginger-beer; to fall in love with a girl round the
  corner and feel awkward about it; to be young. That was the only paradise
  still left virgin and unspoilt enough, in the imagination of a man who has
  turned the seven heavens upside down. That is what he tried as his last
  experiment, and I think we can say it has been a success."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the confectioner with a stony satisfaction, "it has been a
  great success."</p>

  <p>Mr. Gunter, the solicitor, rose also with a sort of gesture of despair.
  "Well, I don't think I understand it any better for knowing all about it," he
  said; "but I suppose it must be as you say. But how in the world did you know
  it yourself?"</p>

  <p>"I think it was those coloured sweets in the window that set me off," said
  Gale. "I couldn't take my eyes off them. They were so pretty. Sweets are
  better than jewellery: the children are right. For they have the fun of
  eating rubies and emeralds. I felt sure they were speaking to me in some way.
  And then I realized what they were saying. Those violet or purple raspberry
  drops were as vivid and glowing as amethysts, when you saw them from
  <i>inside</i> the shop; but from outside, with the light on them, they would
  look quite dingy and dark. Meanwhile, there were plenty of other things,
  gilded or painted with opaque colours, that would have looked much more gay
  in the shop-window, to the customer looking in at it. Then I remembered the
  man who said he must break into the cathedral to see the coloured windows
  from inside, and I knew it in an instant. The man who had arranged that
  shop-window was not a shopkeeper. He was not thinking of how things looked
  from the street, but of how they looked to his own artistic eye from inside.
  From there he saw purple jewels. And then, thinking of the cathedral, of
  course I remembered something else. I remembered what the poet had said about
  the Double Life of St. Thomas of Canterbury; and how when he had all the
  earthly glory, he had to have the exact opposite. St. Phineas of Croydon is
  also living a Double Life."</p>

  <p>"Well," broke out Gunter, heaving with a sort of heavy gasp, "with all
  respect to him, if he has done all this, I can only say that he must have
  gone mad."</p>

  <p>"No," said Gale, "a good many of my friends have gone mad and I am by no
  means without sympathy with them. But you can call this the story of 'The Man
  Who went Sane'."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; THE ASYLUM OF ADVENTURE</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A very small funeral procession passed through a very small
  churchyard on the rocky coast of Cornwall; carrying a coffin to its grave
  under the low and windy wall. The coffin was quite formal and unobtrusive;
  but the knot of fishermen and labourers eyed it with the slanted eyes of
  superstition; almost as if it had been the misshapen coffin of legend that
  was said to contain a monster. For it contained the body of a near neighbour,
  who had long lived a stone's throw from them, and whom they had never
  seen.</p>

  <p>The figure following the coffin, the chief and only mourner, they had seen
  fairly often. He had a habit of disappearing into his late friend's house and
  being invisible for long periods, but he came and went openly. No one knew
  when the dead man had first come, but he probably came in the night; and he
  went out in the coffin. The figure following it was a tall figure in black,
  bare-headed, with the sea-blast whistling through his wisps of yellow hair as
  through the pale sea grasses. He was still young and none could have said
  that his mourning suit sat ill upon him; but some who knew him would have
  seen it with involuntary surprise and felt that it showed him in a new phase.
  When he was dressed, as he generally was, in the negligent tweeds and
  stockings of the pedestrian landscape-painter, he looked merely amiable and
  absent-minded; but the black brought out something more angular and fixed
  about his face. With his black garb and yellow hair he might have been the
  traditional Hamlet; and indeed the look in his eyes was visionary and vague;
  but the traditional Hamlet would hardly have had so long and straight a chin
  as that which rested unconsciously on his black cravat. After the ceremony,
  he left the village church and walked towards the village post office,
  gradually lengthening and lightening his stride, like a man who, with all
  care for decency, can hardly conceal that he is rid of a duty.</p>

  <p>"It's a horrible thing to say," he said to himself, "but I feel like a
  happy widower."</p>

  <p>He then went in to the post office and sent off a telegram addressed to a
  Lady Diana Westermaine, Westermaine Abbey: a telegram that said: "I am coming
  tomorrow to keep my promise and tell you the story of a strange
  friendship."</p>

  <p>Then he went out of the little shop again and walked eastwards out of the
  village, with undisguised briskness, till he had left the houses far behind,
  and his funeral hat and habit were an almost incongruous black spot upon
  great green uplands and the motley forests of autumn. He had walked for about
  half a day, lunched on bread and cheese and ale at a little public-house, and
  resumed his march with unabated cheerfulness, when the first event of that
  strange day befell him. He was threading his way by a river that ran in a
  hollow of the green hills; and at one point his path narrowed and ran under a
  high stone wall. The wall was built of very large flat stones of ragged
  outline, and a row of them ran along the top like the teeth of a giant. He
  would not normally have taken so much notice of the structure of the wall;
  indeed he did not take any notice of it at all until after something had
  happened. Until (in fact) there was a great gap in the row of craggy teeth,
  and one of the crags lay flat at his feet, shaking up dust like the smoke of
  an explosion. It had just brushed one of his long wisps of light hair as it
  fell.</p>

  <p>Looking up, a shade bewildered by the shock of his hairbreadth escape, he
  saw for an instant in the dark gap left in the stone-work a face, peering and
  malignant. He called out promptly:</p>

  <p>"I see you; I could send you to jail for that!"</p>

  <p>"No you can't," retorted the stranger, and vanished into the twilight of
  trees as swiftly as a squirrel.</p>

  <p>The gentleman in black, whose name was Gabriel Gale, looked up
  thoughtfully at the wall, which was rather too high and smooth to scale;
  besides the fugitive had already far too much of a start. Mr. Gale finally
  said aloud, in a reflective fashion: "Now I wonder why he did that!" Then he
  frowned with an entirely new sort of gravity, and after a moment or two of
  grim silence he added: "But after all its much more odd and mysterious that
  he should <i>say</i> that."</p>

  <p>In truth, though the three words uttered by the unknown person seemed
  trivial enough, they sufficed to lead Gale's memories backwards to the
  beginning of the whole business that ended in the little Cornish churchyard;
  and as he went briskly on his way he rehearsed all the details of that old
  story, which he was to tell to the lady at his journey's end.</p>

  <p>Nearly fourteen years before, Gabriel Gale had come of age and inherited
  the moderate debts and the small freehold of a rather unsuccessful gentleman
  farmer. But though he grew up with the traditions of a sort of small squire,
  he was not the sort of person, especially at that age, to have no opinions
  except those traditions. In early youth his politics were the very reverse of
  squires' politics; he was very much of a revolutionary and locally rather a
  firebrand. He intervened on behalf of poachers and gipsies: he wrote letters
  to the local papers which the editors thought too eloquent to be printed. He
  denounced the county magistracy in controversies that had to be impartially
  adjudged by the county magistrates. Finding, curiously enough, that all these
  authorities were against him, and seemed to be in legal control of all his
  methods of self-expression, he invented a method of his own which gave him
  great amusement and the authorities great annoyance. He fell, in fact, to
  employing a talent for drawing and painting which he was conscious of
  possessing, along with another talent for guessing people's thoughts and
  getting a rapid grasp of their characters, which he was less conscious of
  possessing, but which he certainly possessed. It is a talent very valuable to
  a portrait-painter: in this case, however, he became a rather peculiar sort
  of portrait-painter. It was not exactly what is generally called a
  fashionable portrait-painter. Gale's small estate contained several outhouses
  with white-washed walls or palings abutting on the high road; and whenever a
  magnate or magistrate did anything that Gale disapproved of, Gale was in the
  habit of painting his portrait in public and on a large scale. His pictures
  were hardly in the ordinary sense caricatures, but they were portraits of
  souls. There was nothing crude about the picture of the great merchant prince
  now honoured with a peerage; the eyes looking up from under lowered brows,
  the sleek hair parted low on the forehead, were hardly exaggerated; but the
  smiling lips were certainly saying: "And the next article?" One even knew
  that it was not really a very superior article. The picture of the formidable
  Colonel Ferrars did justice to the distinction of the face, with its frosty
  eyebrows and moustaches; but it also very distinctly discovered that it was
  the face of a fool, and of one sub-consciously frightened of being found to
  be a fool.</p>

  <p>With these coloured proclamations did Mr. Gale beautify the countryside
  and make himself beloved among his equals. They could not do very much in the
  matter; it was not libel, for nothing was said; it was not nuisance or
  damage, for it was done on his own property, though in sight of the whole
  world. Among those who gathered every day to watch the painter at work, was a
  sturdy, red-faced, bushy-whiskered farmer, named Banks, seemingly one of
  those people who delight in any event and are more or less impenetrable by
  any opinion. He never could be got to bother his head about the sociological
  symbolism of Gale's caricatures; but he regarded the incident with exuberant
  interest as one of the great stories calculated to be the glory of the
  country, like a calf born with five legs or some pleasant ghost story about
  the old gallows on the moor. Though so little of a theorist he was far from
  being a fool, and had a whole tangle of tales both humorous and tragic, to
  show how rich a humanity was packed within the four corners of his
  countryside. Thus it happened that he and his revolutionary neighbour had
  many talks over the cakes and ale, and went on many expeditions together to
  fascinating graves or historic public-houses. And thus it happened that on
  one of these expeditions Banks fell in with two of his other cronies, who
  made a party of four, making discoveries not altogether without interest.</p>

  <p>The first of the farmer's friends, introduced to Gale under the name of
  Starkey, was a lively little man with a short stubbly beard and sharp eyes,
  which he was in the habit however of screwing up with a quizzical smile
  during the greater part of a conversation. Both he and his friend Banks were
  eagerly interested in the story of Gale's political protests, if they
  regarded them only too much as practical jokes. And they were both
  particularly anxious to introduce a friend of theirs named Wolfe, always
  referred to as Sim, who had a hobby, it would seem, in such matters, and
  might have suggestions to make. With a sort of sleepy curiosity which was
  typical of him, Gale found himself trailed along in an expedition for the
  discovery of Sim; and Sim was discovered at a little obscure hostelry called
  the Grapes a mile or so up the river. The three men had taken a boat, with
  the small Starkey for coxswain; it was a glorious autumn morning but the
  river was almost hidden under high banks and overhanging woods, intersected
  with great gaps of glowing sunlight, in one of which the lawns of the little
  riverside hotel sloped down to the river. And on the bank over-hanging the
  river a man stood waiting for them; a remarkable looking man with a fine
  sallow face rather like an actor's and very curly grizzled hair. He welcomed
  them with a pleasant smile, and then turned towards the house with something
  of a habit of command or at least of direction. "I've ordered something for
  you," he said. "If we go in now it will be ready."</p>

  <p>As Gabriel Gale brought up the rear of the single file of four men going
  up the straight paved path to the inn door, his roaming eye took in the rest
  of the garden, and something stirred in his spirit, which was also prone to
  roaming, and even in a light sense to a sort of rebellion. The steep path was
  lined with little trees, looking like the plan of a sampler. He did not see
  why he should walk straight up so very straight a path, and many things in
  the garden took his wandering fancy. He would much rather have had lunch at
  one of the little weather-stained tables standing about on the lawn. He would
  have been delighted to grope in the dark and tumble-down arbour in the
  corner, of which he could dimly see the circular table and semi-circular seat
  in the shadow of its curtain of creepers. He was even more attracted by the
  accident by which an old children's swing, with its posts and ropes and
  hanging seat, stood close up to the bushes of the river bank. In fact, the
  last infantile temptation was irresistible; and calling out, "I'm going over
  here," he ran across the garden towards the arbour, taking the swing with a
  sort of leap on his way. He landed in the wooden seat and swung twice back
  and forth, leaving it again with another flying leap. Just as he did so,
  however, the rope broke at its upper attachment, and he fell all askew,
  kicking his legs in the air. He was on his feet again immediately, and found
  himself confronted by his three companions who had followed in doubt or
  remonstrance. But the smiling Starkey was foremost, and his screwed-up eyes
  expressed good humour and even sympathy.</p>

  <p>"Rotten sort of swing of yours," he said. "These things are all falling to
  pieces," and he gave the other rope a twitch, bringing that down also. Then
  he added: "Want to feast in the arbour, do you? Very well; you go in first
  and break the cobwebs. When you've collected all the spiders, I'll follow
  you."</p>

  <p>Gale dived laughing into the dark corner in question and sat down in the
  centre of the crescent-shaped seat. The practical Mr. Banks had apparently
  entirely refused to carouse in this leafy cavern; but the figures of the two
  other men soon darkened the entrance and they sat down, one at each horn of
  the crescent.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that was a sudden impulse of yours," said the man named Wolfe,
  smiling. "You poets often have sudden impulses, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"It's not for me to say it was a poet's impulse," replied Gale; "but I'm
  sure it would need a poet to describe it. Perhaps I'm not one; anyhow I never
  could describe those impulses. The only way to do it would be to write a poem
  about the swing and a poem about the arbour, and put them both into a longer
  poem about the garden. And poems aren't produced quite so quickly as all
  that, though I've always had a notion that a real poet would never talk
  prose. He would talk about the weather in rolling stanzas like the
  storm-clouds, or ask you to pass the potatoes in an impromptu lyric as
  beautiful as the blue flower of the potato."</p>

  <p>"Make it a prose poem, then," said the man whose name was Simeon Wolfe,
  "and tell us how you felt about the garden and the garden-swing."</p>

  <p>Gabriel Gale was both sociable and talkative; he talked a great deal about
  himself because he was not an egoist. He talked a great deal about himself on
  the present occasion. He was pleased to find these two intelligent men
  interested and attentive; and he tried to put into words the impalpable
  impulses to which he was always provoked by particular shapes or colours or
  corners of the straggling road of life. He tried to analyse the attraction of
  a swing, with its rudiments of aviation; and how it made a man feel more like
  a boy, because it made a boy feel more like a bird. He explained that the
  arbour was fascinating precisely because it was a den. He told them at some
  length of the psychological truth; that dismal and decayed objects raise a
  man's spirits higher, if they really are already high. His two companions
  talked in turn; and as luncheon progressed and passed they turned over
  between them many strange strata of personal experience, and Gale began to
  understand their personalities and their point of view. Wolfe had travelled a
  great deal, especially in the East; Starkey's experiences had been more local
  but equally curious, and they both had known many psychological cases and
  problems about which to compare notes. They both agreed that Gale's mental
  processes in the matter, though unusual, were not unique.</p>

  <p>"In fact," observed Wolfe, "I think your mind belongs to a particular
  class, and one of which I have had some experience. Don't you think so,
  Starkey?"</p>

  <p>"I quite agree," said the other man, nodding.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that Gale looked out dreamily at the light upon the
  lawn, and in the stillness of his inmost mind a light broke on him like
  lightning; one of the terrible intuitions of his life.</p>

  <p>Against the silver light on the river the dark frame of the forsaken swing
  stood up like a gallows. There was no trace of the seat or the ropes, not
  merely in their proper place, but even on the ground where they had fallen.
  Sweeping his eye slowly and searchingly round the scene, he saw them at last,
  huddled and hidden in a heap behind the bench where Starkey was sitting. In
  an instant he understood everything. He knew the profession of the two men on
  each side of him. He knew why they were asking him to describe the processes
  of his mind. Soon they would be taking out a document and signing it. He
  would not leave that arbour a free man.</p>

  <p>"So you are both doctors," he observed cheerfully, "and you both think I
  am mad."</p>

  <p>"The word is really very unscientific," said Simeon Wolfe in a soothing
  fashion. "You are of a certain type which friends and admirers will be wise
  to treat in a certain way, but it need in no sense be an unfriendly or
  uncomfortable way. You are an artist with that form of the artistic
  temperament which is necessarily a mode of modified megalomania, and which
  expresses itself in the form of exaggeration. You cannot see a large blank
  wall without having an uncontrollable appetite for covering it with large
  pictures. You cannot see a swing hung in the air without thinking of flying
  ships careering through the air. I will venture to guess that you never see a
  cat without thinking of a tiger or a lizard without thinking of a
  dragon."</p>

  <p>"That is perfectly correct," said Gale gravely; "I never do."</p>

  <p>Then his mouth twisted a little, as if a whimsical idea had come into his
  mind. "Psychology is certainly very valuable," he said. "It seems to teach us
  how to see into each other's minds. You, for instance, have a mind which is
  very interesting: you have reached a condition which I think I recognize. You
  are in that particular attitude in which the subject, when he thinks of
  anything, never thinks of the centre of anything. You see only edges eaten
  away. Your malady is the opposite to mine, to what you call making a tiger
  out of a cat, or what some call making a mountain out of a molehill. You do
  not go on and make a cat more of a cat; you are always trying to work back
  and prove that it is less than a cat; that it is a defective cat or a
  mentally deficient cat. But a cat is a cat; that is the supreme sanity which
  is so thickly clouded in your mind. After all, a molehill is a hill and a
  mountain is a hill. But you have got into the state of the mad queen, who
  said she knew hills compared with which this was a valley. You can't grasp
  the thing called a thing. Nothing for you has a central stalk of sanity.
  There is no core to your cosmos. Your trouble began with being an
  atheist."</p>

  <p>"I have not confessed to being an atheist," said Wolfe staring.</p>

  <p>"I have not confessed to being an artist," replied Gale, "or to have
  uncontrolled artistic appetites or any of that stuff. But I will tell you one
  thing: I can only exaggerate things the way they are going. But I'm not often
  wrong about the way they are going. You may be as sleek as a cat but I knew
  you were evolving into a tiger. And I guessed this little lizard could be
  turned by black magic into a dragon."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he was looking grimly at Starkey and out under the dark arch
  of the arbour, as out of a closing prison, with these two ghouls sitting on
  each side of the gate. Beyond was the gaunt shape like a gallows and beyond
  that the green and silver of the garden and the stream shone like a lost
  paradise of liberty. But it was characteristic of him that even when he was
  practically hopeless, he liked being logically triumphant; he liked turning
  the tables on his critics even when, so to speak, they were as abstract as
  multiplication tables.</p>

  <p>"Why, my learned friends," he went on contemptuously, "do you really
  suppose you are any fitter to write a report on my mind than I am on yours?
  You can't see any further into me than I can into you. Not half so far.
  Didn't you know a portrait-painter has to value people at sight as much as a
  doctor? And I do it better than you; I have a knack that way. That's why I
  can paint those pictures on the wall; and I could paint your pictures as big
  as a house. I know what is at the back of your mind, Doctor Simeon Wolfe; and
  it's a chaos of exceptions with no rule. You could find anything abnormal,
  because you have no normal. You could find anybody mad; and as for why you
  specially want to find me mad...why that is another disadvantage of being an
  atheist. You do not think anything will smite you for the vile treachery you
  have sold yourself to do today."</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt about your condition now," said Dr. Wolfe with a
  sneer.</p>

  <p>"You look like an actor, but you are not a very good actor," answered Gale
  calmly. "I can see that my guess was correct. These rack-renters and usurers
  who oppress the poor, in my own native valley, could not find any
  pettifogging law to prevent me from painting the colours of their souls in
  hell. So they have bribed you and another cheap doctor to certify me for a
  madhouse. I know the sort of man you are. I know this is not the first dirty
  trick you have done to help the rich out of a hole. You would do anything for
  your paymasters. Possibly the murder of the unborn."</p>

  <p>Wolfe's face was still wrinkled with its Semitic sneer, but his olive tint
  had turned to a sort of loathsome yellow. Starkey called out with sudden
  shrillness, as abrupt as the bark of a dog.</p>

  <p>"Speak more respectfully!"</p>

  <p>"There is Dr. Starkey, too," continued the poet lazily. "Let us turn our
  medical attention to the mental state of Dr. Starkey."</p>

  <p>As he rolled his eyes with ostentatious languor in the new direction, he
  was arrested by a change in the scene without. A strange man was standing
  under the frame of the swing, looking up at it with his head on one side like
  a bird's. He was a small, sturdy figure, quite conventionally clad; and Gale
  could only suppose he was a stray guest of the hotel. His presence did not
  help very much; for the law was probably on the side of the doctors; and Gale
  continued his address to them.</p>

  <p>"The mental deficiency of Dr. Starkey," he said, "consists in having
  forgotten the truth. You, Starkey, have no sceptical philosophy like your
  friend. You are a practical man, my dear Starkey; but you have told lies so
  incessantly and from so early an age that you never see anything as it is,
  but only as it could be made to look. Beside each thing stands the unreal
  thing that is its shadow; and you see the shadow first. You are very quick in
  seeing it; you go direct to the deceptive potentialities of anything; you see
  at once if anything could be used as anything else. You are the original man
  who went straight down the crooked lane. I could see how quickly you saw that
  the swing would provide ropes to tie me up if I were violent; and that going
  first into this arbour, I should be cornered, with you on each side of me.
  Yet the swing and the arbour were my own idea; and that again is typical of
  you. You're not a scientific thinker like the other scoundrel; you have
  always picked up other men's ideas, but you pick as swiftly as a pickpocket.
  In fact, when you see an idea sticking out of a pocket you can hardly help
  picking it. That's where you're mad; you can't resist being clever, or rather
  borrowing cleverness. Which means you have sometimes been too clever to be
  lucky. You are a shabbier sort of scamp; and I rather fancy you have been in
  prison."</p>

  <p>Starkey sprang to his feet, snatching up the ropes and throwing them on
  the table.</p>

  <p>"Tie him up and gag him," he cried; "he is raving."</p>

  <p>"There again," observed Gale, "I enter with sympathy into your thoughts.
  You mean that I must be gagged at once; for if I were free for half a day, or
  perhaps half an hour, I could find out the facts about you and tear your
  reputation to rags."</p>

  <p>As he spoke he again followed with an interested eye the movements of the
  strange man outside. The man had recrossed the garden, calmly picking up a
  chair from one of the little tables, and returned carrying it lightly in the
  direction of the arbour. To the surprise of all, he set it down at the round
  table in the very entrance of that retreat, and sat down on it with his hands
  in his pockets, staring at Gabriel Gale. With his face in shadow, his square
  head, short hair and bulk of shoulders took on a new touch of mystery.</p>

  <p>"Hope I don't interrupt," he said. "Perhaps it would be more honest to say
  I hope I do interrupt. Because I want to interrupt. Honestly, I think you
  medical gentlemen would be very unwise to gag your friend here, or try to
  carry him off."</p>

  <p>"And why?" asked Starkey sharply.</p>

  <p>"Only because I should kill you if you did," replied the stranger.</p>

  <p>They all stared at him; and Wolfe sneered again as he said: "You might
  find it awkward to kill us both at once."</p>

  <p>The stranger took his hands out of his pockets; and with the very gesture
  there was a double flash of metal. For the hands held two revolvers which
  pointed at them, fixed them like two large fingers of steel.</p>

  <p>"I shall only kill you if you run or call out," said the strange gentleman
  pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"If you do you'll be hanged," cried Wolfe violently.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, I shan't," said the stranger; "not unless two dead men can get up
  and hang me on that nursery gallows in the garden. I'm allowed to kill
  people. There's a special Act of Parliament permitting me to go about killing
  anybody I like. I'm never punished, whatever I do. In fact, to tell you the
  truth, I'm the King of England, and the Constitution says I can do no
  wrong."</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about?" demanded the doctor. "You must be mad."</p>

  <p>The stranger uttered a sudden shout of laughter that shook the shed and
  the nerves of all three hearers.</p>

  <p>"You've hit it first shot," he cried. "He said you were quick, didn't he?
  Yes, I'm mad all right; I've just escaped from the same sanatorium next door,
  where you want to take your friend to. I escaped in a way of my own; through
  the chief doctor's private apartments; and he's kind enough to keep two
  pistols in his drawer. I may be recaptured; but I shan't be hanged. I may be
  recaptured; but I particularly don't want your young friend to be captured at
  all. He's got his life before him; I don't choose he should suffer as I've
  suffered. I like the look of him; I like the way he turned all your medical
  tomfoolery upside down. So you'll understand I am at present wielding the
  power of a perfectly irresponsible sultan. I shall merely be rounding off a
  very pleasant holiday by blowing both your brains out, unless you will sit
  quite still and allow your young friend to tie you up with the ropes. That
  will give us a good start for our escape."</p>

  <p>How he passed through the topsy-turvy transformation scene that followed
  Gale could afterwards barely remember; it seemed like a sort of dream
  pantomime, but its results were solid enough. Ten minutes later he and his
  strange deliverer were walking free in the woods beyond the last hedge of the
  garden, leaving the two medical gentlemen behind them in the arbour, tied up
  like two sacks of potatoes.</p>

  <p>For Gabriel Gale the wood in which he walked was a new world of wonders.
  Every tree was a Christmas tree bearing gifts; and every gap in the woods was
  like a glimpse through the curtain for a child with a toy theatre. For a few
  moments before all these things had nearly disappeared in the darkness of
  something worse than death; till heaven had sent him a guardian angel in the
  shape of an escaped lunatic.</p>

  <p>Gale was very young and his youth had not then found its vent and vocation
  by falling in love. There was in him something of those young Crusaders who
  made wild vows not to cut their hair till they found the Holy City. His
  liberty was looking and longing for something to bind itself; and at this
  moment he could think of but one thing in the world.</p>

  <p>Two hundred yards along the path by the river he halted and spoke to his
  companion:</p>

  <p>"It is you who have given me all this," he said. "Under God, and so far as
  my life goes, it is you who have created heaven and earth. You set up along
  my triumphal way these trees like seven-branched candlesticks with their grey
  branches silver in the sun. You spread before my feet these red leaves that
  are better than roses. You shaped clouds. You invented birds. Do you think I
  could enjoy all these things when I knew you were back again in the hell that
  you hate? I should feel I had tricked you out of everything you have given
  me. I should feel like a thief who had stolen the stars. You shan't go back
  there if I can help it; you saved me and I am going to save you. I owe you my
  life and I give it you; I vow I will share anything you suffer; God do so to
  me and more also, if aught but death part thee and me."</p>

  <p>Thus were spoken in that wild place the wild words that determined the
  life of Gabriel Gale for so many years afterwards; and the walk that began in
  that wood turned into a wandering over the whole country by those two
  fantastic outlaws. As a matter of fact a sort of armed truce fell between
  them and their enemies, for each had something to fear from the other. Gale
  did not use all he discovered against the two doctors lest they should press
  the pursuit of his friend; and they did not press it lest he should retaliate
  with his own revelations. Thus the two came to roam practically unmolested
  until the day of that adventure, already described in the beginning of all
  these things, when he fell in love, and his crazy companion fell into a
  paroxysm which went very near to murder.</p>

  <p>In every sense that dreadful day had changed all. That murderous outbreak
  had at last convinced a sadder and wiser Gabriel that he had other
  responsibilities besides those of his chivalric vow to his companion-in-arms;
  and he concluded that their companionship could only be rightly continued in
  some safe and more secluded form. Then it was that he put his friend into the
  comfortable and secret house in Cornwall, and spent most of his own time
  there, leaving a trustworthy servant on guard during his brief absences. His
  companion, whose name was James Hurrel, had been a business man of great
  ability and even audacity, until his schemes grew a little too big for his
  brain; and he lived happily enough in Cornwall, covering the tables with
  prospectuses and the walls with posters relative to various financial
  enterprises of the most promising kind. There he died, to all appearance
  equally happily; and Gale walked back from his funeral a free man.</p>

  <p>* * * * *</p>

  <p>Next morning, after a few hours' walking a rise and change in the rolling
  and wooded country told him that he was on the borders of his enchanted
  ground. He remembered something in the grouping of the trees, and how they
  seemed to huddle and stand on tiptoe with their backs to him, looking into
  the happy valley. He came to where the road curved over the hill, as he had
  come with his friend in former times; and saw below him the meadows falling
  steeply as thatched roofs and flattening out till they reached the wide and
  shallow river, and the ford and the dark inn called the Rising Sun.</p>

  <p>The gloomy inn-keeper of old days was gone, having found it less gloomy to
  take service in some stables in the neighbourhood; and a brisker individual
  with the look of a groom was the recipient of Gale's expansive praises of the
  beauty of the scene. Gale was good enough to inform the inn-keeper of the
  beauty of the skies in the neighbourhood of his own inn, telling how he,
  Gale, had once seen a sunset in that valley quite peculiar to it and
  unequalled anywhere in the world; and how even the storm that had followed
  the sunset had been something very sublime in that style. His generalizations
  however were somewhat checked and diverted by a note which the inn-keeper put
  into his hand, a note from the great house across the river. It was without
  any formal opening, as if the writer had hesitated about a form of address;
  and it ran:</p>

  <p>"I want to hear the story and hope you will come over tomorrow (Thursday).
  I fear I shall be out today, as I have to go to see a Dr. Wilson in Wimbledon
  about some work I have a chance of doing. I suppose you know we are pretty
  hard up in these days. D.W."</p>

  <p>The whole landscape seemed to him to darken for an instant as he read the
  letter, but he did not lose his brisk demeanour and breezy mode of
  speech.</p>

  <p>"I find I made a mistake," he said, putting the note in his pocket, "and I
  must leave here almost at once. I have to visit another spot, if possible
  more picturesque and poetical than this one. It is Wimbledon that has skies
  of a strange and unique character at the present time. The sunsets of
  Wimbledon are famous throughout the world. A storm in Wimbledon would be an
  apocalypse. But I hope I shall come back here again sooner or later.
  Good-bye."</p>

  <p>The proceedings of Mr. Gale after this were rather more calculated and
  peculiar. First he sat on a stile and frowned heavily as if thinking hard.
  Then he sent off a telegram to a certain Dr. Garth, who was a friend of his,
  and one or two other telegrams to persons in rather responsible positions.
  When he got to London he went into the offices of the vulgarest and most
  sensational newspaper he knew, and looked up the back files for the details
  of forgotten crimes. When he got to Wimbledon he had a long interview with a
  local house agent and ended up towards evening, outside a high garden wall
  with a green door, in a wide but empty and silent suburban road. He went
  quietly up to the door and barely touched it with his finger, as if seeing if
  the paint were wet. But the door, which was barred across with bands of
  decorative metal work and had every appearance of being shut, immediately
  fell ajar, showing the patchy colours of garden beds within. "I thought so,"
  said Gale to himself and slipped into the garden, leaving the door ajar
  behind him.</p>

  <p>The suburban family which he was presumably visiting, and with which the
  impoverished Diana Westermaine was presumably to take some post as governess
  or secretary, was evidently the sort who combined a new neatness with a
  certain early Victorian comfort and indifference to cost. The conservatories
  were of antiquated pattern, but full of rich and exotic things; there were
  things still more old-fashioned, such as a grey and rather featureless
  classical statue in the centre. Within a few yards of it were things so
  Victorian as croquet hoops and croquet mallets, as if a game had been in
  progress, and beyond it under the tree was a table set out with tea things,
  for people for whom tea was not a trifle. All these human things, unused at
  the moment by human beings, seemed to emphasize the emptiness of the garden.
  Or rather, so far as he was concerned, they emphasized the fact that it was
  almost empty, save for the one thing that could so strangely fill it with
  life. For far away down one of the paths pointing towards the kitchen garden
  he saw a figure moving as yet unconsciously towards him. It came out under an
  arch crowned with creepers and there, after so many years, they met. There
  seemed something symbolical of seriousness and crisis in the accident that
  they were both in black.</p>

  <p>He had always been able to call up the memory of her dark vivid eyebrows
  and the high-tinted distinction of her face in connexion with corners of the
  blue dress she had worn; but when he saw her again he wondered that the face
  had not always annihilated all its lesser associations. She looked at him for
  a moment with bright motionless eyes and then said:</p>

  <p>"Well, really. You seem to be a rather impatient person."</p>

  <p>"Possibly," he replied; "and yet I have waited four years."</p>

  <p>"They are coming out to tea in a moment," she said somewhat awkwardly. "I
  suppose I must introduce you to them. I only accepted the post this morning;
  but they asked me to stay. I was going to wire to you."</p>

  <p>"Thank God I followed you," he answered. "I doubt if the wire would have
  reached me...from this house."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked, "and how did you follow?"</p>

  <p>"I did not like your Wimbledon address," he said: and with that, strange
  figures began to fill the garden, and she walked across to the tea-table. Her
  face was somewhat paler and more severe than it used to be, but in her grey
  eyes there was a light not altogether extinguished, curiosity still shot with
  defiance. By the time they reached the table two or three people had
  collected round it; and the somewhat irregular visitor had saluted them in a
  regular and even punctilious fashion.</p>

  <p>The host or hostess had apparently not yet become visible; there were only
  three gentlemen, presumably guests and perhaps members of a house-party. One
  was introduced as Mr. Wolmer, a young man with a fair moustache and a tall
  fine figure that made his head look small; with a fine bridged nose that
  ought to have been like a hawk's if the prominence of the eyes and some
  deficiency of the chin had not somehow made it more like a parrot's. The
  second was a Major Bruce, a very short man with a very long head streaked
  with iron grey hair, and an expression which suggested, truly enough, that he
  very seldom opened his mouth. The third was an elderly person with a black
  skull-cap on his bald head and a fringe or fan of red beard or whiskers; he
  was evidently a person of some importance and known as Professor
  Patterson.</p>

  <p>Gale partook of tea and indulged in polite conversation in quite an
  animated fashion, wondering all the time who it was who ought to have been at
  the head of the table, where Diana Westermaine was pouring out the tea. The
  demeanour of the man named Wolmer was rather restless; and in a little while
  he stood up and began, as if from the necessity of doing something, to knock
  the croquet balls about on the lawn. Gale, who was watching him with some
  interest, followed suit by picking up a mallet and trying some particular
  trick of putting two balls through a hoop. It was a trick which needed a test
  of some minuteness, for he went down on his hands and knees to examine the
  position more closely.</p>

  <p>"Going to put your head through the hoop?" asked Wolmer rudely; for he had
  been growing more and more impatient, almost as if he had taken a mysterious
  dislike to the newcomer.</p>

  <p>"Not quite," answered Gale good-humouredly as he rolled the balls away.
  "Uncomfortable position, I should think. Like being guillotined."</p>

  <p>Wolmer was glaring balefully at the hoop and said something in a thick
  voice that sounded like "Serve you right." Then he suddenly whirled his
  mallet above his head like a battle-axe and brought it down with a crash on
  the hoop, driving it deep into the turf. There was something indescribably
  shocking about the pantomime, following instantly on the image that had just
  been suggested of a human head in the hoop. They felt as if an act of
  decapitation had been done before their very eyes.</p>

  <p>"Better put down that mallet now," said the professor in a soothing voice,
  putting a rather shaky hand on the other's arm.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll put it down then," said Wolmer, and slung it away over his
  shoulder like a man putting the hammer at the Highland Sports. It flew
  through the air like a thunderbolt, striking the forlorn plaster statue in
  the centre and breaking it off short at the top. Mr. Wolmer laughed in a
  rather uncontrolled fashion; and then strode away into the house.</p>

  <p>The girl had been watching these things with her dark brows bent and her
  pallor growing somewhat more marked. There was an unpleasant silence, and
  then Major Bruce spoke for the first time.</p>

  <p>"It's the atmosphere of this place," he said. "It is not very
  wholesome."</p>

  <p>The atmosphere of the suburban garden as a matter of fact was very clear,
  sunny and pleasant, and Diana looked round with a growing and even creeping
  mystification at the gay flower-pots and the lawns golden in the evening
  light.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it is my own misfortune," resumed the Major reflectively. "The
  truth is there is something serious the matter with me. I have a malady which
  makes this particular place rather awful."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>There was a short silence and then he answered stolidly.</p>

  <p>"I am sane."</p>

  <p>Then she looked once more at the warm sunshiny garden and began to shudder
  as if with cold. A thousand things came back to her out of the last few
  hours. She knew why she had dimly distrusted her new home. She knew now that
  there is only one place in the world where men say that they are sane.</p>

  <p>As the little man with the long head walked away as stiffly as a wooden
  automaton, she looked round for Gale and found he had vanished. An appalling
  emptiness, a vast vacuum of terror, opened around her on every side. In that
  moment she had admitted many things to herself that had been but half
  conscious: and no one on earth mattered but the man who had vanished into a
  void. For the moment she balanced the possibility that she was really mad
  against the possibility that nobody else was sane; when she caught sight,
  through the gap of a hedge, of figures moving at the other end of the garden.
  The old professor in the skull-cap was moving rapidly but with trepidation,
  as if running on tiptoe, his long lean hands flapping like fins and his red
  chin-beard wagging in the wind. And behind him following, equally softly and
  swiftly, at the distance of a few yards, was the long grey figure of Gabriel
  Gale. She could fit together no fancy about what it all meant; she could only
  continue to stare across the flower-beds at the glass-houses full of
  monstrous flowers and be vaguely conscious of a sort of symbol in the
  headless statue in the centre; the god of that garden of unreason.</p>

  <p>The next moment she saw Gale reappear at the other extremity of the long
  hedge and come towards her smiling in the sunshine. He stopped when he saw
  her white face.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what this place is?" she whispered. "It is a madhouse."</p>

  <p>"It's a very easy one to escape from," said Gale in a serene manner. "I've
  just seen the professor escape from it. He escapes regularly; probably on
  Wednesdays and Saturdays."</p>

  <p>"This is no time for your jokes," she cried. "I tell you we've been
  trapped inside a madhouse."</p>

  <p>"And I tell you we shall soon be outside the madhouse," he replied firmly.
  "And under those circumstances, I don't mind telling you that I regret to say
  it is not a madhouse."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"It is something worse," replied Gale.</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you mean," she repeated. "Tell me what you know about this
  horrible place."</p>

  <p>"For me it will always be a holy place," he said. "Was it not under that
  arch there that you appeared out of the abyss of memory? And after all, it's
  a beautiful garden and I'm almost sorry to leave it. The house, too, makes a
  romantic background; and really we might be very comfortable here...if only
  it were a madhouse." And he sighed with regret.</p>

  <p>Then after a pause he added, "I might say all I want to say to you in a
  nice, friendly, comfortable lunatic asylum...but not in a place like this.
  There are practical things to be done now; and here come the people who will
  do them!"</p>

  <p>She was never able to fit together again the fragments of that bad dream
  and its wilder way of breaking up. To her astonishment she beheld a new group
  advancing up the garden path; in front was a red-haired man in a top hat,
  whose shrewd and good-humoured features were faintly familiar to her; behind
  were two stalwart figures, obviously in "plain clothes", and between them the
  unexpected apparition of Professor Patterson in handcuffs.</p>

  <p>"Caught him setting fire to a house," said the red-haired man briefly.
  "Valuable documents."</p>

  <p>Later in that bewildering stretch of hours, the friends seated themselves
  on a garden seat for explanations. "You remember Dr. Garth, I think," said
  Gale to the lady. "He has been helping me to clear up this queer business.
  The truth is, the police have suspected the nature of this Wimbledon retreat
  for some time. No; it is not a lunatic asylum; it is a den of very
  accomplished professional criminals. They have hit on the ingenious idea of
  being certified as irresponsible by a medical confederate; so that the worst
  that can happen is that he may be censured for laxity in letting them escape.
  Look up the records, and you will find them responsible, or irresponsible,
  for quite a long catalogue of crimes. I happened to follow the notion up,
  because I happened to guess where the notion came from. By the way, I suppose
  this is the gentleman who engaged you as a typist."</p>

  <p>As he spoke a small alert figure strode out of the house and across the
  lawns; his short beard thrust forward with something of the gesture of a
  terrier.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is Dr. Wilson; I made arrangements with him only this morning,"
  answered Diana, still staring.</p>

  <p>The doctor came to a halt in front of them, turning his head right and
  left in the terrier fashion, and looking at them with wrinkled brows and
  lids.</p>

  <p>"So this is Dr. Wilson," said Gale politely. "Good day, Dr. Starkey."</p>

  <p>Then as the plain-clothes men shifted and closed round the doctor, Gale
  added reflectively:</p>

  <p>"I knew you would never fail to take a hint."</p>

  <p>A street or two away from the strange madhouse there was a sort of toy
  park, not much bigger than a back garden, but laid out in ornamental paths
  and planted with flowering shrubs, as an oasis for nomadic nurses trailing
  about the babies of that suburb. It was also ornamented with long seats with
  curly backs, and one of these seats in its turn was ornamented by a couple
  clad in black and endeavouring, with some bewilderment, to appear
  respectable. Wild as were the events of that afternoon, they had moved very
  rapidly and it was barely evening. The sunset was settling down about the
  corners of the sky and of the quaint little public garden, and there was
  little noise except the shrill but faint calling of some children lingering
  over some long-drawn-out-game.</p>

  <p>It was here that he told her the whole story of the rash vow and all that
  happened between the rescue in the riverside garden and the funeral in the
  Cornish churchyard.</p>

  <p>"The only thing I don't understand," she said at last, "is why you thought
  they had got me to that place; or why you thought there was any such
  place."</p>

  <p>"Why, because," he said looking at the gravel path with a slight
  embarrassment, "because I really was not bragging when I told Starkey at the
  beginning that I understood the sort of mind he had, and could exaggerate it
  in the way it was going. Starkey never missed a chance of applying or
  misapplying an idea, especially anybody else's idea. When poor Jimmy Hurrel
  boasted of being free from punishment because he was an escaped lunatic, I
  was sure that a seed had been sown in Starkey's mind that would sprout. I was
  sure he would follow it up and use it, as he used my fancy for the swing or
  the arbour. While Jim was alive he knew I had a motive for silence; but the
  moment Jim died he struck. He was very quick; his mind is like a flash of
  lightning; quick but crooked. He sent one of his chartered maniacs to brain
  me with a stone on my way to you. He intercepted my telegram, and lured you
  away before you could be told the whole story. But what I want to know is
  what you think of the whole story."</p>

  <p>"The vow was certainly rash enough," she said. "All that time you might
  have been painting pictures and doing all sorts of good. It doesn't seem
  right that a genius should be tied to a lunatic by a few words."</p>

  <p>He sat up very suddenly. "For God's sake don't say that!" he cried. "Don't
  say one oughtn't to tie oneself to a lunatic by a few words! Don't say that's
  wrong, I implore you, whatever else you say! A shocking thought! A perfectly
  foul idea!"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked. "Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Because," he said, "I want you to make a rash vow. I want you to tie
  yourself with a few words to a lunatic."</p>

  <p>There was a silence, at the end of which she smiled suddenly and put her
  hand on his arm.</p>

  <p>"No," she said, "only a silly...I always liked you, even when I thought
  you really were a lunatic; that day when you stood on your head. But now I
  don't think my vow will be so very rash....What on earth are you doing
  now?...Oh, I say...for heaven's sake...."</p>

  <p>"What else should I do," he answered calmly, "after what you have just
  said? I'm going to stand on my head again."</p>

  <p>The children in the corner of the little garden gazed with interest at a
  gentleman in funeral full-dress behaving in a somewhat unusual manner.</p>
