<br>
<p style="line-height:150%;"><span class="uu">SIR</span>,<br>
<br>
<span class="aa">Your Majesty</span> having been graciously
pleased to permit my late brother <span class="uu">Captain George
Vancouver</span>, to present to <span class="aa">Your
Majesty</span> the Narrative of his labours during the execution
of your commands in the Pacific Ocean, I presume to hope, that,
since it has pleased the Divine Providence to withdraw him from
<span class="aa">Your Majesty</span>'s service, and from the
society of his friends, before he could avail himself of that
condescension, <span class="aa">Your Majesty</span> will, with
the same benignity, vouchsafe to accept it from my hands, in
discharge of the melancholy duty which has devolved upon me by
that unfortunate event.</p>
<p style="line-height:150%;">I cannot but indulge the hope that
the following pages will prove to <span class="aa">Your
Majesty</span>, that Captain Vancouver was not undeserving the
honour of the trust reposed in him; and that he has fulfilled the
object of his commission from <span class="aa">Your
Majesty</span> with diligence and fidelity.</p>
<p style="line-height:150%;">Under the auspices of <span class=
"aa">Your Majesty</span>, the late indefatigable Captain Cook had
already shewn that a southern continent did not exit, and had
ascertained the important fact of the near approximation of the
northern shores of Asia to those of America. To those great
discoveries the exertions of <span class="uu">Captain
Vancouver</span> will, I trust, be found to have added the
complete certainty, that, within the limits of his researches on
the continental shore of North-West America, <span class="uu">no
internal sea, or other navigable communication</span> whatever
exists, uniting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<br>
<p><span class="aa">In</span> contemplating the rapid progress of
improvement in the sciences, and the general diffusion of
knowledge, since the commencement of the eighteenth century, we
are unavoidably led to observe, with admiration, that active
spirit of discovery, by means of which the remotest regions of
the earth have been explored; a friendly communication opened
with their inhabitants; and various commodities, of a most
valuable nature, contributing either to relieve their
necessities, or augment their comforts, introduced among the
less-enlightened part of our species. A mutual intercourse has
been also established, in many instances, on the solid basis of a
reciprocity of benefits; and the productive labour of the
civilized world has found new markets for the disposal of its
manufactures. Nor has the balance of trade been wholly against
the people of the newly-discovered countries; for, whilst some
have been enabled to supply their visitors with an abundance of
food, and the most: valuable refreshments, in exchange for iron,
copper, useful implements, and articles of ornament; the industry
of others has been stimulated to procure the skins of animals,
and other articles of a commercial nature; which they have found
to be eagerly fought for by the traders who now resort to their
shores from Europe, Asia, and the eastern side of North
America.</p>
<p>The great naval powers of Europe, inspired with a desire not
only of acquiring, but also of communicating, knowledge, had
extended their researches, in the 16th and 17th centuries, as far
into the pacific ocean as their limited information of the
geography of the earth, at that time, enabled them to penetrate.
Some few attempts had also been made by this country towards the
conclusion of each of those centuries; but it was not until the
year 1764 that Great-Britain, benefiting by the experience of
former enterprizes, laid the foundation for that vast accession
of geographical knowledge, which she has since obtained by the
persevering spirit of her successive distinguished
circumnavigators.</p>
<p>By the introduction of nautical astronomy into marine
education, we are taught to sail on the hypothenuse, instead of
traversing two sides of a triangle, which was the usage in
earlier times; by this means, the circuitous course of all
voyages from place to place is considerably shortened; and it is
now become evident, that sea officers of the most common-rate
abilities, who will take the trouble of making themselves
acquainted with the principles of this science, will, on all
suitable occasions, with proper and correct instruments, be
enabled to acquire a knowledge of their situation in the
atlantic, indian, or pacific oceans, with a degree of accuracy
sufficient to steer on a meridional or diagonal line, to any
known spot; provided it be sufficiently conspicuous to be visible
at any distance from five to ten leagues.</p>
<p>This great improvement, by which the most remote parts of the
terrestrial globe are brought so easily within our reach, would,
nevertheless, have been, comparatively, of little utility, had
not those happy means been discovered, for preserving the lives
and health of the officers and seamen engaged in such distant and
perilous undertakings; which were so successfully practised by
Captain Cook, the first great discoverer of this salutary system,
in all his latter voyages round the globe. But in none have the
effects of his wife regulations, regimen, and discipline, been
more manifest, than in the course of the expedition of which the
following pages are designed to treat. To an unremitting
attention, not only to food, cleanliness, ventilation, and an
early administration of antiseptic provisions and medicines, but
also to prevent, as much as possible, the chance of
indisposition, by prohibiting individuals from carelessly
exposing themselves to the influence of climate, or unhealthy
indulgences in times of relaxation, and by relieving them from
fatigue and the inclemency of the weather the moment the nature
of their duty would permit them to retire; is to be ascribed the
preservation of the health and lives of sea-faring people on long
voyages. Instead of vessels returning from parts, by no means
very remote, with the loss of one half, and sometimes two thirds,
of their crews, in consequence of scorbutic, and other contagious
disorders; instances are now not wanting of laborious services
having been performed in the most distant regions, in which,
after an absence of more than three or four years, during which
time the vessels had been subjected to all the vicissitudes of
climate, from the scorching heat of the torrid zone to the
freezing blasts of the arctic or antarctic circles, the crews
have returned in perfect health, and consisting nearly of every
individual they had carried out; whilst those who unfortunately
had not survived, either from accident or disease, did not exceed
in number the mortality that might reasonably have been expected,
during the same period of time, in the most healthy situations of
this country. To these valuable improvements, Great Britain is,
at this time, in a great measure indebted, for her present
exalted Ration amongst the nations of the earth; and it should
seem, that the reign of George the Third had been reserved, by
the Great Disposer of all things, for the glorious task of
establishing the grand key-stone to that expansive arch, over
which the arts and sciences should pass to the furthermost
corners of the earth, for the instruction and happiness of the
most lowly children of nature. Advantages so highly beneficial to
the untutored parts of the human race, and so extremely important
to that large proportion of the subjects of this empire who are
brought up to the sea service, deserve to be justly appreciated;
and it becomes of very little importance to the bulk of our
society, whose enlightened humanity teaches them to entertain a
lively regard for the welfare and interest of those who engage in
such adventurous undertakings for the advancement of science, or
for the extension of commerce, what may be the animadversions or
sarcasms of those few unenlightened minds that may peevishly
demand, "what beneficial consequences, if any, have followed, or
are likely to follow, to the discoverers, or to the discovered,
to the common interests of humanity, or to the increase of useful
knowledge, from all our boasted attempts to explore the distant
recesses of the globe?" The learned editor,* who has so justly
anticipated this injudicious remark, has, in his very
comprehensive introduction to Captain Cook's last Voyage, from
whence the above quotation is extracted, given to the public, not
only a complete and satisfactory answer to that question, but has
treated every other part of the subject of Discovery so ably, as
to render any further observations on former voyages of this
description totally unnecessary, for the purpose of bringing the
reader acquainted with what had been accomplished, previously to
my being honored with His Majesty's commands to follow up the
labours of that illustrious navigator Captain James Cook; to
whose steady, uniform, indefatigable, and undiverted attention to
the several objects on which the success of his enterprizes
ultimately depended, the world is indebted for such eminent and
important benefits.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Dr. Douglas, now Bishop of Salisbury.]</p>
<p>Those benefits did not long remain unnoticed by the commercial
part of the British nation. Remote and distant voyages being now
no longer objects of terror, enterprizes were projected, and
carried into execution, for the purpose of establishing new and
lucrative branches of commerce between North West America and
China; and parts of the coast of the former that had not been
minutely examined by Captain Cook, became now the general resort
of the persons thus engaged.</p>
<p>Unprovided as these adventurers were with proper astronomical
and nautical instruments, and having their views directed almost
intirely to the object of their employers, they had neither the
means, nor the leisure, that were indispensably requisite for
amassing any certain geographical information. This became
evident, from the accounts of their several voyages given to the
public; in which, notwithstanding that they positively
contradicted each other, as well in geographical and nautical
fads as in those of a commercial nature, they yet agreed in
filling up the blanks in the charts of Captain Cook with
extensive islands, and a coast apparently much broken by
numberless inlets, which they had left almost intirely
unexplored.</p>
<p>The charts accompanying the accounts of their voyages,
representing the North West coast of America to be so much broken
by the waters of the pacific, gave encouragement once more to
hypotheses; and the favorite opinion that had slept since the
publication of Captain Cook's last voyage, of a north-eastern
communication between the waters of the pacific and atlantic
oceans, was again roused from its state of slumber, and brought
forward with renovated vigour. Once more the archipelago of St.
Lazarus was called forth into being, and its existence almost
assumed, upon the authority of a Spanish admiral named De Fonte,
De Fonta, or De Fuentes; and of a Mr. Nicholas Shapely, from
Boston in America, who was stated to have penetrated through this
archipelago, by sailing through a mediterranean sea, on the coast
of North-West America, within a few leagues of the oceanic shores
of that archipelago; where he is said to have met the Admiral.
The straits said to have been navigated by Juan De Fuca were also
brought forward in support of this opinion; and, although the
existence or extent of these discoveries remained still to be
proved by an authenticated survey of the countries which had been
thus stated to have been seen and passed through, yet the
enthusiasm of modern <i>closet philosophy</i>, eager to revenge
itself for the refutation of its former fallacious speculations,
ventured to accuse Captain Cook of "hastily exploding" its
systems; and, ranking him amongst <i>the pursuers of peltry</i>,
dared even to drag him forward himself in support of its
visionary conjectures.</p>
<p>With what reason, or with what justice, such animadversions
have been cast upon one, who, unhappily for the world, does not
survive to enforce his own judicious opinions; influenced as they
were, by no prejudice, nor biassed by any pre-conceived theory or
hypothesis, but founded on the solid principles of experience,
and of ocular demonstration; it is not my province to decide: let
it suffice to say, that the labours of that distinguished
character will remain a monument of his pre-eminent abilities,
and dispassionate investigation of the truth, as long as science
shall be reflected in the civilized world; or as long as
succeeding travellers, who shall unite in bearing testimony to
the profundity of his judgment, shall continue to obtain credit
with the public.</p>
<p>Although the ardour of the present age, to discover and
delineate the true geography of the earth, had been rewarded with
uncommon and unexpected success, particularly by the persevering
exertions of this great man, yet all was not completed; and
though, subsequent to his last visit to the coast of North-West
America, no expedition had been projected by Government, for the
purpose of acquiring a more exact knowledge of that extensive and
interesting country; yet a voyage was planned by His Majesty for
exploring some of the Southern regions; and in the autumn of the
year 1789, directions were given for carrying it into effect.</p>
<p>Captain Henry Roberts, of known and tried abilities, who had
served under Captain Cook during his two last voyages, and whose
attention to the scientific part of his profession had afforded
that great navigator frequent opportunities of naming him with
much respect, was called upon to take charge of, and to command,
the proposed expedition.</p>
<p>At that period, I had just returned from a station at Jamaica
under the command of Commodore (now Vice-Admiral) Sir Alan
Gardner, who mentioned me to Lord Chatham and the Board of
Admiralty; and I was solicited to accompany Captain Roberts as
his second. In this proposal I acquiesced, and found myself very
pleasantly situated, in being thus connected with a
fellow-traveller for whose abilities I bore the greatest respect,
and in whose friendship and good opinion I was proud to possess a
place. And as we had sailed together with Captain Cook on his
voyage towards the south pole, and as both had afterwards
accompanied him with Captain Clerke in the Discovery during his
last voyage, I had no doubt that we were engaged in an
expedition, which would prove no less interesting to my friend
than agreeable to my wishes.</p>
<p>A ship, proper for the service under contemplation, was
ordered to be provided. In the yard of Messrs. Randall and Brent,
on the banks of the Thames, a vessel of 340 tons burthen was
nearly finished; and as me would demand but few alterations to
make her in every respect fit for the purpose, she was purchased;
and, on her being launched, was named the Discovery.</p>
<p>The first day of the year 1790 the Discovery was commissioned
by Captain Roberts; some of the other officers were also
appointed, and the ship was conducted to His Majesty's dock-yard
at Deptford, where she was put into a state of equipment; which
was ordered to be executed, with all the dispatch that the nature
of the service required.</p>
<p>For some time previous to this period the Spaniards, roused by
the successful efforts of the British nation, to obtain a more
extended knowledge of the earth, had awoke, as it were, from a
state of lethargy, and had not only ventured to visit some of the
newly-discovered islands in the tropical regions of the pacific
ocean, but had also, in the year 1775, with a spirit somewhat
analogous to that which prompted their first discovery of
America, extended their researches to the northward, along the
coast of North-West America. But this undertaking did not seem to
have reached beyond the acquirement of a very superficial
knowledge of the shores; and though these were found to be
extremely broken, and divided by the waters of the pacific, yet
it does not appear that any measures were pursued by them for
ascertaining the extent, to which those waters penetrated into
the interior of the American continent.</p>
<p>This apparent indifference in exploring new countries, ought
not, however, to be attributed to a deficiency in skill, or to a
want of spirit for enterprize, in the commander * of that
expedition; because there is great reason to believe, that the
extreme caution which has so long and so rigidly governed the
court of Madrid, to prevent, as much as possible, not only their
American, but likewise their Indian, establishments from being
visited by any Europeans, (unless they were subjects of the crown
of Spain, and liable to a military tribunal) had greatly
conspired, with other confederations of a political nature, to
repress that deli re of adding to the fund of geographical
knowledge, which has so eminently distinguished this country. And
hence it is not extraordinary, that the discovery of a
north-western navigable communication between the atlantic and
pacific oceans, should not have been considered as an object much
to be desired by the Spanish court. Since that expedition,
however, the Spaniards seem to have considered their former
national character as in some measure at flake; and they have
certainly become more acquainted than they were with the
extensive countries immediately adjoining to their immense empire
in the new world; yet the measures that they adopted, in order to
obtain that information, were executed in so defective a manner,
that all the important questions to geography still remained
undecided, and in the same state of uncertainty.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Sen<sup>r.</sup> Quadra.]</p>
<p>Towards the end of april, the Discovery was, in most respects,
in a condition to proceed down the river, when intelligence was
received that the Spaniards had committed depredations on
different branches of the British commerce on the coast of
North-West America, and that they had seized on the English
vessels and factories in Nootka sound. This intelligence gave
rise to disputes between the courts of London and Madrid, which
had the threatening appearance of being terminated by no other
means than those of reprizal. In consequence of this an armament
took place, and the further pacific equipment of the Discovery
was suspended; her stores and provisions were returned to the
respective offices, and her officers and men were engaged in more
active service. On this occasion I resumed my profession under my
highly-esteemed friend Sir Alan Gardner, then captain of the
Courageux, where I remained until the 17th of the november
following; when I was ordered to repair to town for the purpose
of attending to the commands of the Board of Admiralty.</p>
<p>The uncommon celerity, and unparalleled dispatch, which
attended the equipment of one of the noblest fleets that
Great-Britain ever saw, had probably its due influence upon the
court of Madrid, for, in the Spanish convention, which was
consequent on that armament, restitution was offered to this
country for the captures and aggressions made by the subjects of
His Catholic Majesty; together with an acknowledgment of an equal
right with Spain to the exercise and prosecution of all
commercial undertakings in those seas, reputed before to belong
only to the Spanish crown. The extensive branches of the
fisheries, and the fur trade to China, being considered as
objects of very material importance to this country, it was
deemed expedient, that an officer should be sent to Nootka to
receive back, in form, a restitution of the territories on which
the Spaniards had seized, and also to make an accurate survey of
the coast, from the 30th degree of north latitude north-westward
toward Cook's river; and further, to obtain every possible
information that could be collected respecting the natural and
political state of that country.</p>
<p>The outline of this intended expedition was communicated to
me, and I had the honor of being appointed to the command of it.
At this juncture it appeared to be of importance, that all
possible exertion should be made in its equipment; and as the
Discovery, which had been selected on the former occasion, was
now rigged, some of her shores provided, and she herself
considered, in most respects, as a vessel well calculated for the
voyage under contemplation, she was accordingly directed to be
got ready for that service; and the Chatham armed tender, of 135
tons burthen, built at Dover, having been destined to accompany
the Discovery in the voyage which had been abandoned, she was
ordered to be equipped to attend on the voyage now to be
undertaken, and was sent to Woolwich to receive such necessary
repairs and alterations as were deemed requisite for the
occasion.</p>
<p>The Discovery was copper-fastened, sheathed with plank, and
coppered over; the Chatham only sheathed with copper. The former
mounted ten four-pounders, and ten swivels; the latter, four
three-pounders and six swivels. The following list will exhibit
the establishment of the officers and men in the two vessels.</p>

<p>I had great reason to be satisfied with these arrangements;
the second and third lieutenants, and the matter of the
Discovery, whom I had the honor of being allowed to name for this
service, had all served some years with me, under the command of
Sir Alan Gardner, both at home, and in the Welt-Indies; the other
officers were men of known character, possessing good abilities,
and excellent dispositions, which their subsequent conduct and
zeal, exhibited on all occasions, sufficiently demonstrated.</p>
<p>In the former equipment of the Discovery, Captain Roberts and
myself had undertaken to make all such astronomical and nautical
observations, as the circumstances occurring in the voyage might
demand. This task now devolved upon me alone; but with the
assistance of Mr. Whidbey, I entertained little doubt of
accomplishing the proposed object, at least in an useful manner;
for which purpose we were supplied by the Navy Board with such an
assortment of instruments as I considered to be necessary.</p>
<p>It was with infinite satisfaction that I saw, amongst the
officers and young gentlemen of the quarter-deck, some who, with
little instruction, would soon be enabled to construct charts,
take plans of bays and harbours, draw landscapes, and make
faithful portraits of the several headlands, coasts, and
countries, which we might discover; thus, by the united efforts
of our little community, the whole of our proceedings, and the
information we might obtain in the course of the voyage, would be
rendered profitable to those who might succeed us in traversing
the remote parts of the globe that we were destined to explore,
without the assistance of professional persons, as astronomers or
draftsmen.</p>
<p>Botany, however, was an object of scientific inquiry with
which no one of us was much acquainted; but as, in expeditions of
a similar nature, the most valuable opportunities had been
afforded for adding to the ge[ne]ral flock of botanical
information, Mr. Archibald Menzies, a surgeon in the royal navy,
who had before visited the pacific ocean in one of the vessels
employed in the fur trade, was appointed for the specific purpose
of making such researches; and had, doubtless, given sufficient
proof of his abilities, to qualify him for the station it was
intended he should fill. For the purpose of preserving such new
or uncommon plants as he might deem worthy of a place amongst His
Majesty's very valuable collection of exotics at Kew, a glazed
frame was erected on the after part of the quarter-deck, for the
reception of those he might have an opportunity of
collecting.</p>
<p>The Board of Admiralty, greatly attentive to our personal
comforts, gave directions that the Discovery and Chatham should
each be supplied with all such articles as might be considered in
any way likely to become necessary, during the execution of the
long and arduous service in which we were about to engage. Our
stores, from the naval arsenals, were ordered to be selected of
the very best sorts, and to be made with materials of the best
quality. In addition to the ordinary establishment, we were
supplied with a large assortment of seines and other useful
fishing geer of various kinds. The provisions were furnished at
the victualling-office with the greatest care, all of which
proved to be excellent, and manifested the judgment which had
been exercised in the selection and preparation of the several
articles. To these were added a large proportion of sour-krout,
portable soup, wheat instead of the usual supply of oatmeal for
breakfast, the essence of malt and spruce, malt, hops, dried
yeast, flour, and seed mustard; which may all be considered as
articles of food. Those of a medicinal nature, with which we were
amply supplied, were Dr. James's powders; vitriolic elixir; the
rob of lemons and oranges, in such quantities and proportions as
the surgeon thought requisite; together with an augmentation to
the usual allowance, amounting to a hundred weight, of the best
peruvian bark.</p>
<p>To render our visits as acceptable as possible to the
inhabitants of the islands or continent in the pacific ocean, and
to establish on a firm basis a friendly intercourse with the
several tribes we might occasionally meet with, Lord Grenville
directed that a liberal assortment of various European
commodities, both of a useful and ornamental nature, should be
sent on board from the Secretary of State's office. From the
Board of Ordnance the vessels were supplied with every thing
necessary for our defence, and amongst other articles were four
well-contrived three pound field pieces, for the protection of
our little encampment against any hostile attempts of the native
Indians, amongst whom we should necessarily have frequent
occasion to reside on shore; and for the amusement and
entertainment of such as were peaceably and friendly disposed
towards us, we were furnished with a most excellent assortment of
well-prepared fireworks. So that nothing seemed to have been
forgotten, or omitted, that might render our equipment as
complete, as the nature of the service we were about to execute
could be considered to demand. But as I have hitherto only
pointed out in general terms the outline of the intended
expedition; the various objects it proposed to embrace, and the
end it was expected to answer, will be more clearly perceived by
the perusal of the instructions under which I was to sail, and by
which I was to govern my conduct; which will enable the reader to
form a judgment, how far His Majesty's commands, during this
voyage, have been properly carried into execution.</p>
<br>
<p class="negindent4">"By the Commissioners for executing the
office of Lord High Admiral of Great-Britain and Ireland,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>"The <span class="aa">King</span> having judged it expedient,
that an expedition should be immediately undertaken for acquiring
a more complete knowledge, than has yet been obtained, of the
north-west coast of America; and, the sloop you command, together
with the Chatham armed tender, (the Lieutenant commanding which,
has been directed to follow your orders) having been equipped for
that service; you are, in pursuance of His Majesty's pleasure,
signified to us by Lord Grenville, one of His principal
Secretaries of State, hereby required and directed, to proceed,
without loss of time, with the said sloop and tender, to the
Sandwich islands in the north pacific ocean, where you are to
remain during the next winter; employing yourself very diligently
in the examination and survey of the said islands; and, as soon
as the weather shall be favorable, (which may be expected to be
in february, or at latest in march, 1792) you are to repair to
the north-west coast of America, for the purpose of acquiring a
more complete knowledge of it, as above mentioned.</p>
<p>"It having been agreed, by the late convention between His
Majesty and the Catholic King, (a printed copy of which you will
receive herewith) that the buildings and tracts of land, situated
on the north-west coast above mentioned, or on islands adjacent
thereto, of which the subjects of His Britannic Majesty were
dispossessed about the month of april, 1789, by a Spanish
officer, shall be restored to the said British subjects, the
court of Spain has agreed to fend orders, for that purpose, to
its officers in that part of the world; but, as the particular
specification of the parts to be restored may still require some
further time, it is intended that the King's orders, for this
purpose, shall be sent out to the Sandwich islands, by a vessel
to be employed to carry thither a further store of provisions for
the sloop and armed tender above mentioned, which it is meant
shall sail from this country in time to reach those islands in
the course of next winter.</p>
<p>"If, therefore, in consequence of the arrangement to be made
with the court of Spain, it should hereafter be determined that
you should proceed, in the first instance, to Nootka, or
elsewhere, in order to receive, from the Spanish officers, such
lands or buildings as are to be restored to the British subjects;
orders, to that effect, will be sent out by the vessel above
mentioned. But, if no such orders should be received by you
previous to the end of January, 1792, you are not to wait for
them at the Sandwich islands, but to proceed, in such course as
you may judge most expedient for the examination of the coast
above mentioned, comprized between latitude 60° north and 30°
north.</p>
<p>"In which examination the principal objects which you are to
keep in view, are,</p>
<p>"1st, The acquiring accurate information with respect to the
nature and extent of any water-communication which may tend, in
any considerable degree, to facilitate an intercourse, for the
purposes of commerce, between the north-west coast, and the
country upon the opposite side of the continent, which are
inhabited or occupied by His Majesty's subjects.</p>
<p>"2dly, The ascertaining, with as much precision as possible,
then umber, extent, and situation of any settlements which have
been made within the limits above mentioned, by any European
nation, and the time when such settlement was first made.</p>
<p>"With respect to the first object, it would be of great
importance if it should be found that, by means of any
considerable inlets of the sea, or even of large rivers,
communicating with the lakes in the interior of the continent,
such an intercourse, as hath been already mentioned, could be
established; it will therefore be necessary, for the purpose of
ascertaining this point, that the survey should be so conducted,
as not only to ascertain the general line of the sea coast, but
also the direction and extent of all such considerable inlets,
whether made by arms of the sea, or by the mouths of large
rivers, as may be likely to lead to, or facilitate, such
communication as is above described.</p>
<p>"This being the principal object of the examination, so far as
relates to that part of the subject, it necessarily follows, that
a considerable degree of discretion must be left, and is
therefore left to you, as to the means of executing the service
which His Majesty has in view; but, as far as any general
instructions can here be given on the subject, it seems desirable
that, in Order to avoid any unnecessary loss of time, you should
not, and are therefore hereby required and directed not to pursue
any inlet or river further than it shall appear to be navigable
by vessels of such burthen as might safely navigate the pacific
ocean: but, as the navigation of such inlets or rivers, to the
extent here stated, may possibly require that you should proceed
up them further than it might be safe for the sloop you command
to go, you are, in such case, to take the command of the armed
tender in person, at all such times, and in such situations as
you mail judge it necessary and expedient.</p>
<p>"The particular course of the survey must depend on the
different circumstances which may arise in the execution of a
service of this nature; it is, however, proper that you should,
and you are therefore hereby required and directed to pay a
particular attention to the examination of the supposed straits
of Juan de Fuca, said to be situated between 48° and 49° north
latitude, and to lead to an opening through which the sloop
Washington is reported to have passed in 1789, and to have come
out again to the northward of Nootka. The discovery of a near
communication between any such sea or strait, and any river
running into, or from the lake of the woods, would be
particularly useful.</p>
<p>"If you should fail of discovering any such inlet, as is above
mentioned, to the southward of Cook's river, there is the
greatest probability that it will be found that the said river
rises in some of the lakes already known to the Canadian traders,
and to the servants of the Hudson's bay company; which point it
would, in that case, be material to ascertain; and you are,
therefore, to endeavour to ascertain accordingly, with as much
precision as the circumstances existing at the time may allow:
but the discovery of any similar communication more to the
southward (should any such exist) would be much more advantageous
for the purposes of commerce, and should, therefore, be
preferably attended to, and you are, therefore, to give it a
preferable attention accordingly.</p>
<p>"With respect to the second object above mentioned, it is
probable that more particular instructions will be given you by
the vessel to be sent to the Sandwich islands as aforesaid; but,
if not, you are to be particularly careful in the execution of
that, and every other part of the service with which you are
entrusted, to avoid, with the utmost caution, the giving any
ground of jealousy or complaint to the subjects of His Catholic
Majesty; and, if you should fall in with any Spanish ships
employed on any service similar to that which is hereby committed
to you, you are to afford to the officer commanding such ships
every possible degree of assistance and information, and to offer
to him, that you, and he, should make to each other,
reciprocally, a free and unreserved communication of all plans
and charts of discoveries made by you and him in your respective
voyages.</p>
<p>"If, in the course of any part of this service, you, or the
officers or the people under your command, should meet with the
subjects or vessels of any other power or state, you and they are
to treat them in the most friendly manner, and to be careful not
to do any thing which may give occasion to any interruption of
that peace which now happily subsists between His Majesty and all
other powers.</p>
<p>"The whole of the survey above mentioned (if carried on with a
view to the objects before Mated, without too minute and
particular an examination of the detail of the different parts of
the coast laid down by it) may, as it is understood, probably be
completed in the summers of 1792 and 1793; and, in the
intermediate winter, it will be proper for you to repair, and you
are hereby required and directed to repair accordingly, to the
Sandwich islands; and, during your stay there, you are to
endeavour to complete any part which may be unfinished of your
examination of those islands.</p>
<p>"After the conclusion of your survey in the summer of 1793,
you are, if the state and circumstances of the sloop and tender
under your command will admit of it, to return to England by Cape
Horn, (for which the season will then probably be favorable;)
repairing to Spithead, where you are to remain until you receive
further order; and fending to our secretary an account of your
arrival and proceedings.</p>
<p>"It seems doubtful, at present, how far the time may admit of
your making any particular examination of the western coast of
South America; but, if it should be practicable, you are to begin
such examination from the south point of the island of Chiloe,
which is in about 44 south latitude; and you are, in that case,
to direct: your attention to ascertaining what is the most
southern Spanish settlement on that coast, and what harbours
there are south of that settlement.</p>
<p>"In the execution of every part of this service, it is very
material that you should use, and you are therefore hereby
strictly charged to use every possible care to avoid disputes
with the natives of any of the parts where you may touch, and to
be particularly attentive to endeavour, by a judicious
distribution of the presents, (which have been put on board the
sloop and tender under your command, by order of Lord Grenville)
and by all other means, to conciliate their friendship and
confidence. Given under our hands the 8th of March, 1791."</p>

<h3>ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS.</h3>
<p class="negindent4">"By the Commissioners for executing the
office of Lord High Admiral of Great-Britain and Ireland,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Hergest, commanding the Dædalus transport, (by
whom you will receive this) being directed to put himself under
your command, and to follow your orders for his further
proceedings; you are hereby required and directed, to take him,
and the said transport, under your command accordingly; receiving
from her the provisions and stores intended for the use of the
sloop you command, and the Chatham armed tender, or such part
thereof as the said ship and tender shall be able to stow.</p>
<p>"And whereas you will receive herewith a duplicate of a letter
from Count Florida Blanca, to the Spanish officer commanding at
Nootka, (together with a translation thereof) signifying His
Catholic Majesty's orders to cause such officer as may be
appointed on the part of His Britannic Majesty, <i>to be put in
possession of the buildings, and districts, or parcels of lands
therein described, which were occupied by His Majesty's subjects
in the month of april, 1789, agreeable to the first article of
the late convention</i>, (a copy of which has been sent to you)
and to deliver up any persons in the service of British subjects
who may have been detained in those parts; in case, therefore,
you shall receive this at Nootka, you are to deliver to the
Spanish officer, commanding at that port, the above-mentioned
letter from Count Florida Blanca, and to receive from him,
conformably thereto, on the part of His Britannic Majesty,
possession of the buildings and districts, and parcels of land,
of which His Majesty's subjects were possessed at the
above-mentioned period.</p>
<p>"In case, however, this shall not find you at Nootka, when
Lieutenant Hergest arrives there, but be delivered to you at the
Sandwich islands, or elsewhere, and the said lieutenant shall not
have then carried into execution the service above mentioned,
(which in the event of his not falling in with you he is directed
to do) you are immediately to proceed to Nootka, and to carry
that service into execution as above directed, taking the said
lieutenant and transport with you if you shall judge it
necessary. But as they are intended afterwards to proceed to New
South Wales, to be employed there, under the orders of Commodore
Phillip, you are not to detain them at Nootka, the Sandwich
islands, or elsewhere, longer than may be absolutely necessary,
but to direct Lieutenant Hergest to repair with the said
transport to port Jackson, with such live stock, and other
refreshments, as may be likely to be of use in the settlements
there; and to touch at New Zealand in his way, from whence he is
to use his best endeavours to take with him one or two
flax-dressers, in order that the new settlers at port Jackson
may, if possible, be properly instructed in the management of
that valuable plant.</p>
<p>"Previous, however, to your dispatching him to port Jackson,
you are to consider whether, in case of your not being able to
take on board the whole of the transport's cargo, any future
supply of the articles of which it is composed, will be necessary
to enable you to continue your intended survey; and, if so, you
are to be careful to fend notice thereof to Commodore Phillip,
who will have directions, on the receipt of your application, to
re-dispatch the transport, or to fend such other vessel to you
with the remainder of those supplies (as well as any others he
may be able to furnish) to such rendezvous as you mail
appoint.</p>
<p>"And whereas Mr. Dundas has transmitted to us a sketch of the
coast of North America, extending from Nootka down to the
latitude of 47° 30", including the inlet or gulph of Juan de
Fuca; and as from the declarations which have lately been made,
there appears to be the strongest disposition, on the part of the
Spanish court, that every assistance and information should be
given to His Britannic Majesty's officers employed on that coast,
with a view to the enabling them to carry their orders into
execution; we fend you the said sketch herewith, for your
information and use, and do hereby require and direct you, to do
every thing in your power to cultivate a good understanding with
the officers and subjects of His Catholic Majesty who may fall in
your way, in order that you may reap the good effects of this
disposition of the Spanish court.</p>
<p>"You are to take the utmost care in your power, on no account
whatever, to touch at any port on the continent of America, to
the southward of the latitude of 30° north, nor to the north of
that part of South America, where, on your return home, you are
directed to commence your intended survey; unless, from any
accident, you shall find it absolutely necessary, for your
immediate safety, to take shelter there: and, in case of such an
event, to continue there no longer than your necessities require,
in order that any complaint on the part of Spain on this point
may, if possible, be prevented.</p>
<p>"If, during your continuance on the American coast, you should
meet with any of the Chinese who were employed by Mr. Meares and
his associates, or any of His Majesty's subjects, who may have
been in captivity, you are to receive them on board the sloop you
command, and to accommodate them in the best manner you may be
able, until such time as opportunities may be found of sending
them to the different places to which they may be desirous of
being conveyed; victualling them during their continuance on
board, in the same manner as the other persons on board the said
sloop are victualled,</p>
<p>"Given under our hands the 20th of august, 1791."</p>

<p>Amongst other objects demanding my attention, whilst engaged
in carrying these orders into execution, no opportunity was
neglected to remove, as far as I was capable, all such errors as
had crept into the science of navigation, and to establish, in
their place, such facts as would tend to facilitate the grand
object of finding the longitude at sea; which now seems to be
brought nearly to a certainty, by pursuing the lunar method,
assisted by a good chronometer. On this, as well as some other
subjects, it is highly probable, that great prolixity and
repetition will be found in the following pages; it will,
however, readily appear to the candid perusers of this voyage,
that, as the primary design of the undertaking was to obtain
useful knowledge, so it became an indispensable duty, on my part,
to use my utmost exertions and abilities in doing justice to the
original intention; by detailing the information that arose in
the execution of it, in a way calculated to <i>instruct</i>, even
though it should fail to <i>entertain</i>. And when the writer
alleges, that from the age of thirteen, his whole life, to the
commencement of this expedition, (fifteen months only excepted)
has been devoted to constant employment in His Majesty's naval
service, he feels, and with all possible humility, that he has
some claims to the indulgence of a generous public; who, under
such circumstances, will not expect to find elegance of
direction, purity of style, or unexceptionable grammatical
accuracy: but will be satisfied with "a plain unvarnished"
relation, given with a rigid attention to the truth of such
transactions and circumstances as appeared to be worthy of
recording by a naval officer, whose greatest pride is to deserve
the appellation of being zealous in the service of his king and
country.</p>

<h4><i>Advertisement from the Editor</i>.</h4>
<blockquote><span class="uu">As</span> a considerable delay has
necessarily taken place in the publication of this work, in
consequence of the decease of the late Captain Vancouver, it
becomes of absolute necessity to give an accurate account of the
state of the work at the period when his last fatal indisposition
rendered him incapable of attending any more to business; lest
the melancholy event which has retarded its completion should
tend to affect its authenticity in the public opinion.<br>
<br>
The two first volumes, excepting the introduction, and as far as
page 288 of the third and last volume, were printed; and Captain
Vancouver had finished a laborious examination of the impression,
and had compared it with the engraved charts and headlands of his
discoveries, from the commencement of his survey in the year
1791, to the conclusion of it at the port of Valparaiso, on his
return to England in the year 1795. He has also prepared the
introduction, and a further part of the journal as far as page
408 of the last volume. The whole, therefore, of the important
part of the work, which comprehends his geographical discoveries
and improvements, is now presented to the public, exactly as it
would have been had Captain Vancouver been still living. The
notes which he had made on his journey from the port of
Valparaiso to his arrival at St. Jago de Chili, the capital of
that kingdom, were unfortunately lost; and I am indebted to
Captain Puget for having assisted me with his observations on
that occasion.<br>
<br>
Ever since Captain Vancouver's last return to England, his health
had been in a very debilitated state, and his constitution was
evidently so much impaired by the arduous services in which, from
his earliest youth, he had been constantly engaged,* that his
friends dared to indulge but little hope that he would continue
many years amongst them. Notwithstanding that it pleased the
Divine Providence to spare his life until he had been able to
revise and complete the account of the geographical part of his
late Voyage of Discovery, a circumstance which must ever be
regarded as most fortunate by all the friends of science, and
especially by those professional persons who may hereafter be
likely to follow him, through the intricate labyrinth which he
has so minutely explored; yet it will ever be a confederation of
much regret, that he did not survive to perfect the narrative of
his labours. He had made many curious observations on the natural
history of the several countries he had visited, and on the
manners, customs, laws and religion, of the various people with
whom he had met, or amongst whom he had occasionally resided; but
had been induced to postpone these miscellaneous matters, lest
the regular diary of the voyage should be interrupted by the
introduction of such desultory observations. These he had
intended to present in the form of a supplementary or concluding
chapter, but was prevented from so doing by the unfortunate event
of his illness.</blockquote>
<p class="foot">[* The late Captain Vancouver was appointed to
the Resolution by Captain Cook in the autumn of the year 1771,
and on his return from that voyage round the world, he undertook
to assist in the outfit and equipment of the Discovery, destined
to accompany Captain Cook on his last voyage to the North pole,
which was concluded in october, 1780. On the 9th of december
following he was made a lieutenant into the Martin sloop: in this
vessel he continued until he was removed into the Fame, one of
Lord Rodney's fleet in the West-Indies, where he remained until
the middle of the year 1783. In the year 1784 he was appointed
to, and sailed in the Europa to Jamaica, on which station he
continued until her return to England in September 1789. On the
1st of January, 1790, he was appointed to the Discovery, but soon
afterwards was removed to the Courageux: here he remained until
december, 1750, when he was made master and commander, and
appointed to the Discovery. In august, 1794, he was, without
felicitation, promoted to the rank of post captain, and was paid
off on the conclusion of his last voyage in november, 1795. After
this period he was constantly employed, until within a few weeks
of his decease, in may, 1798, in preparing the following journal
for publication.]</p>
<blockquote>Most of the papers, which contain these interesting
particulars, are too concise and too unconnected for me to
attempt any arrangement of them, or to submit them to the reader
without hazarding Captain Vancouver's judgment as an observer, or
his reputation as a narrator, rigidly devoted to the truth. But
as some of the notes, which he made upon the spot, are of too
valuable a nature to be intirely lost, I shall venture to subjoin
them to the History of the Voyage, as nearly as possible in his
own words, without attempting any such arrangement of them, as
might tend to diminish their authenticity, or bring into doubt
that scrupulous veracity from which Captain Vancouver never
departed.<br>
<br>
The whole narrative of the Voyage of Discovery having been
brought to its conclusion at Valparaiso, by Captain Vancouver
himself, there only remains for me to add, that in preparing for
the press the small remainder of his journal, comprehending the
passage round Cape Horn to St. Helena, and from thence to
England, I have strictly adhered to the rough documents before
me; but as no new incidents occurred in this part of the voyage,
and as the insertion of log-book minutes, over a space which is
now so frequently traversed, cannot either be useful or
entertaining, I have endeavoured to compress this portion of the
journal into as few pages as possible.<br>
<br>
In performing this painful task, I have had severe and ample
cause to lament the melancholy office to which I have been
compelled, by the loss of him whose early departure from this
life has deprived His Majesty of an active and able officer,
truth and science of a steady supporter, society of an uniformly
valuable member, and in addition to the feelings of many who live
to regret the loss of a sincere friend, I have to deplore that of
a most affectionate brother.</blockquote>

<hr class="tenth">
<br>
<p><span class="aa">On</span> the 15th of December, 1790, I had
the honor of receiving my commission as commander of His
Majesty's sloop the Discovery, then lying at Deptford, where, the
next morning, I joined her, and began entering men.</p>
<p>Lieutenant William Robert Broughton having been selected as a
proper officer to command the Chatham, he was accordingly
appointed; but the repairs she demanded prevented her equipment
keeping pace with that of the Discovery; which in most respects
being completed by thursday the 6th of January, 1791, the sails
were bent, and the ship got in readiness to proceed down the
river. With a favorable wind on the following day we sailed, and
anchored in Long Reach about five in the evening. Although this
trial of the ship may appear very insignificant, yet as she had
never been under sail, it was not made without some anxiety. The
construction of her upper works, for the fake of adding to the
comfort of the accommodations, differing materially from the
general fashion, produced an unsightly appearance; and gave rise
to various opinions unfavorable to her qualities as a sea-boat;
for which reason it was natural to pay the minutest attention to
her steering, and other properties when in motion; and we
obtained in the course of this short expedition, the pleasing
prospect of her proving handy, and in all other respects a very
comfortable vessel. Various necessary occupations detained us in
Long Reach until the 26th, when, having taken on board all our
ordnance Mores, and such things as were wanted from Deptford dock
yard, we proceeded down the river on our way to Portsmouth. My
orders for this purpose were accompanied by another, to receive
on board and convey to his native country <i>Towraro</i>, an
Indian, from one of the Sandwich Islands, who had been brought
from thence by some of the north west American traders in July
1789. This man had lived, whilst in England, in great obscurity,
and did not seem in the least to have benefited by his residence
in this country.</p>
<p>Unfavorable winds prevented our reaching the Downs until the
30th; where they still continued, and, being attended with very
boisterous weather, detained us until the 3d of february; when,
with a strong gale from the northward, we proceeded down channel.
About noon we passed the South Foreland, and had the misfortune
to lose John Brown, who fell overboard, and was drowned. He was
one of the Carpenter's mates, an exceedingly good man, and very
much regretted. About noon on the 5th we anchored at Spithead,
where Rear-Admiral Goodall's flag was flying on board His
Majesty's ship Vanguard, in company with twelve sail of the line,
and several frigates.</p>
<p>Some defects in the ship's head were already evident, as the
bumkins, and a considerable part of the head were now washed
away. These repairs, with such other duties as were necessary, I
gave orders to have executed; and my presence being required in
London, I repaired thither; where I remained until the 27th, when
I returned to Portsmouth, with orders to proceed to Falmouth.</p>
<p>On former voyages of this description, it had been customary
to pay the officers and ship's company, the wages that had become
due whilst they had been employed in the equipment of the
vessels, which in general had occupied six months or upwards;
enabling them by such means more effectually to provide
themselves with those comforts which such long and remote
services ever demand. But as a similar payment to the crews of
the Discovery and Chatham, (whose complements were now complete)
for the short time they had been in pay, would have been of
little assistance; the Lords of the Admiralty, at my
felicitation, had the goodness to grant them three months pay in
advance; which was accordingly received free of all
deductions.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned that the Navy Board had supplied me
with an assortment of mathematical instruments; and the Board of
Longitude, in compliance with the wishes of the Admiralty,
provided in addition two chronometers; one made by the late
eminent Mr. Kendall, (the excellence of which had been manifested
on board the Discovery during Captain Cook's last voyage, and
which had lately been cleaned and put into order by its very
worthy and ingenious maker, a short time before his decease;) the
other lately made by Mr. Arnold. These had both been deposited at
the observatory of the Portsmouth academy, for the purpose of
finding their respective errors, and for ascertaining their rate
of going. The former was delivered to me, with such observations
as had been made to that effect; whence it appeared to be fast of
mean time at Greenwich, on the 1st of March at noon, 1' 30" 18'",
and to be gaining on mean time at the rate of 6" 12'" per day.
The latter was directed to be put on board the Chatham, which
vessel had now arrived from the river.</p>
<p>Having completely finished our business with the dock-yard on
thursday evening, we dropped down to St. Helen's, and the next
morning proceeded down channel, leaving the Chatham behind, not
as yet quite ready to accompany us; in our way we Hopped at
Guernsey, and on the 12th arrived at Falmouth, where I was to
wait the arrival of the Chatham, and to receive my final
instructions for the prosecution of the voyage. An Admiralty
messenger presented me with the latter on sunday the 20th; but
the Chatham did not arrive until the 31st, when Lieutenant
Broughton, who had orders to put himself under my command,
received such signals and instructions as were necessary on this
occasion. He informed me, that they had experienced a very
boisterous passage from Spithead, and that the Chatham had proved
so very crank, as, in some instances, to occasion considerable
alarm. The length of time I had already waited for her arrival
rendered this intelligence very unpleasant; as, demanding
immediate attention, it would cause further delay, which I much
wished to avoid; especially as a favorable gale for clearing the
channel now prevailed. The apprehension of further detention by
contrary winds, should we lose the present opportunity by
breaking up the Chatham's hold for the reception of more ballast,
induced me to resort to another expedient, that of lending her
all our shot, which when flowed amidships as low down as
possible, and every weight removed from above, we flattered
ourselves would be the means of affording a temporary relief to
this inconvenience.</p>
<p>A gentle breeze from the <span class="aa">n.e</span>. at day
dawn on friday the 1st of april, enabled us to sail out of
Carrack road, in company with the Chatham; and at midnight we
took a long farewell of our native shores. The Lizard lights bore
by compass <span class="aa">n.n.w</span>. ½ <span class=
"aa">w.</span> about eight leagues distant; and the wind being in
the western quarter, we stood to the southward. Towards the
morning of the 2d, on the wind's shifting to the south, we stood
to the westward, clear of the English channel; with minds, it may
easily be conceived, not entirely free from serious and
contemplative reflections. The remote and barbarous regions,
which were now destined, for some years, to be our transitory
places of abode, were not likely to afford us any means of
communicating with our native soil, our families, our friends or
favorites, whom we were now leaving far behind; and to augment
these painful reflections, His Majesty's proclamation had arrived
at Falmouth, the evening prior to our departure, offering
bounties for manning the fleet; several sail of the line were put
into commission, and flag officers appointed to different
commands: these were circumstances similar to those under which,
in august, 1776, I had sailed from England in the Discovery,
commanded by Captain Clerke, on a voyage which in its object
nearly resembled the expedition we were now about to undertake.
This very unexpected armament could not be regarded without
causing various opinions in those who, from day to day, would
have opportunities of noticing the several measures inclining to
war or peace; but to us, destined, as it were, to a long and
remote exile, and precluded, for an indefinite period of time,
from all chance of becoming acquainted with its result, it was
the source of inexpressible solicitude, and our feelings on the
occasion may be better conceived than described.</p>
<p>Having no particular route to the pacific ocean pointed out in
my instructions, and being left at perfect liberty to pursue that
which appeared the most eligible, I did not hesitate to prefer
the passage by way of the cape of Good Hope, intending to visit
the Madeiras, for the purpose of procuring wine and refreshments.
Our course was accordingly so directed against winds very
unfavorable to our wishes. At noon on the 3d we reached the
latitude of 48°48' north, longitude, by the chronometer, 6° 55'
west; where the cloudy weather preventing our making the
necessary observations on the sun eclipsed produced no small
degree of concern; as with the late improvement of applying deep
magnifying powers to the telescopes of sextants, the observations
on solar eclipses are rendered very easy to be made at sea; and
although we were not fortunate enough on this occasion to procure
such, at the interesting periods of the eclipse, as would have
put this improvement fully to the test, yet it was evident that
these observations to persons not much accustomed to astronomical
pursuits would be rendered plain and easy, by the reflected image
of the sun being brought down to the horizon; so that the
beginning and the end of the eclipse would be ascertained by the
help of these deep magnifying telescopes with great precision;
and probably it may not be unworthy the attention of the Board of
Longitude to contrive, and cause such calculations to be
published, as would tend to render these observations generally
useful in the various parts of the globe, without the tedious
process of calculating eclipses. The wind, continuing in the
southern quarter, rendered our progress slow; the weather,
however, being clear, afforded us employment in taking some good
lunar observations; which, reduced to the 12th at noon, gave the
mean result of four sets, taken by me, 12° 24' west longitude;
four sets taken by Mr. Whidbey, 12° 30'; the chronometer at the
same time shewing 12° 9'; and as I considered the latter to be
nearest the truth, the lunar observations appeared to be 15' to
21' too far to the westward. The longitude, by dead reckoning,
13° 22', and the latitude 44° 22' north. The error in reckoning
amounting almost to a degree, seemed most likely to have been
occasioned by our not having made sufficient allowance for the
variation of the compass on our first sailing, as, instead of
allowing from 22° to 25°, which was what we esteemed the
variation, our observations for ascertaining this fact, when the
ship was sufficiently steady, shewed the variation to be 28° and
29° ½ westwardly. These opportunities, however, had not occurred
so frequently as I could have wished, owing to a constant
irregular swell that had accompanied us since leaving the land,
and caused so much motion and pitching, that the whole head
railings, bumkins, &amp;c. were again warned away.</p>
<p>In latitude 42° 34' north, longitude 12° 31' west, the
variation of the compass, by the mean result of six sets of
observations taken by three compasses differing from 25° 57' to
27° 35', was observed to be 26° 29' westwardly. The current was
found to set in a direction <span class="aa">e.n.e</span>. at the
rate of a quarter of a mile per hour. The whole of the day being
perfectly calm, with remarkably fine weather, induced me to
embrace the opportunity of unbending all our sails which wanted
alteration, and to bend an entire new suit; these I caused to be
soaked over board for some hours, that the sea water might
dissolve the size used in making the canvass, and by that means
act as a preventive against the mildew in hot rainy weather. This
process might probably be found useful in the operation of
bleaching.</p>
<p>On our departure from England, I did not intend using any
antiseptic provisions, until the refreshments which we might be
enabled to procure at the Madeiras should be exhausted; but light
baffling winds, together with the crank situation and bad sailing
of the Chatham, having so retarded our progress, that, by the
21st, we were advanced no further than the latitude of 35° 7'
north, longitude 14° 40' west: sour krout and portable broth had,
for some days, been served on board each of the vessels; the
store rooms had been cleared, cleaned, and warned with vinegar,
and the ship had been smoked with gunpowder mixed with vinegar.
As I had ever considered fire the most likely and efficacious
means to keep up a constant circulation of fresh and pure air
throughout a ship; in the fore part of every day good fires were
burning between decks, and in the well. Both decks were kept
clean, and as dry as possible, and notwithstanding the weather
was hot, and the smoke and heat thence arising was considered as
inconvenient and disagreeable, yet I was confident that a due
attention to this particular, and not warning too frequently
below, were indispensable precautions, and would be productive of
the most salubrious and happy effects in preferring the health
and lives of our people. These preventive measures becoming the
Handing orders of the Discovery, it will be unnecessary hereafter
to repeat that they were regularly enforced, as they were
observed throughout the voyage with the strictest. attention. It
may not, however, on this subject, be improper to remark that if
instead of biscuit, seamen were provided with fresh soft bread,
which can easily be made very good at sea, and a large proportion
of wholesome water, where the nature of the services will admit
of such a supply, they would add greatly to the preservation of
that most valuable of all blessings, health.</p>
<p>The evening of the 23d, being remarkably fine and serene,
brought us in sight of the island Porto Sancto, bearing by
compass <span class="aa">s.w.</span> ½ <span class="aa">w.</span>
20 leagues distant; the next afternoon we passed its meridian,
when the chronometer shewing its longitude to be 16° 24' 15",
varying only one minute to the westward of the true longitude of
that island, proved itself to be going very well. As Madeira was
our object, every effort was exerted to gain Funchal Road, until
the evening of the 25th, when the wind becoming excessively
variable, and the weather gloomy and unsettled, that station
seemed ineligible for executing the service of which the Chatham
stood in need; namely, the breaking up her hold, for the purpose
of receiving a large portion of ballast. Considering therefore
the roadstead of S<sup>ta</sup> Cruz as better calculated for
this business, we proceeded towards Teneriffe. The wind which had
been generally from the west, veered round by the north, as we
advanced to the southward, and settled in the <span class=
"aa">n.e</span>. trade, accompanied with fine pleasant weather,
which, on the 26th, in latitude 30° 54' north, afforded me an
opportunity of obtaining several sets of lunar distances with the
different sextants in the ship. These were twelve in number, of
the following eminent makers in London, (viz.) Ramsden, Dollond,
Troughton, Adams, and Gilbert, though the greater number were
made by Mr. Ramsden. They all agreed exceedingly well together,
and their mean result shewed the longitude to be 16° 21' 32"; the
chronometer made the longitude 16° 31' 15" west; and as there
could be no doubt of the latter being nearest the truth, the
result of the lunar observations, by the several sextants,
appeared to be 9' 43" too far to the eastward. On the other side
of the moon, my lunar observations were 15' to the west of the
true, or nearly the true, longitude, as was proved on our making
the Madeiras. This evinces the accuracy with which these
observations are in general capable of being made with good
instruments, and by a careful observer.</p>
<p>In the morning of the 28th, the pic of Teneriffe was seen
bearing by compass <span class="aa">s.w.</span> about sixteen
leagues distant; and, in the evening, as we approached the
roadstead of S<sup>ta</sup> Cruz, we were met by the master
attendant, who placed the ship in what, he said, he conceived the
best birth in the roadstead, and the Chatham in our immediate
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>When the ship was secured, an officer was sent to inform the
governor of our arrival, and to solicit his permission to take on
board such wine, and refreshments as we required; but having
understood that he had waved a return of salute to some of His
Majesty's ships that had lately visited Teneriffe; I did not
choose to risk a refusal, however polite, to comply with this
compliment. The officer was civilly received; and the contractor
was, the next morning, directed to supply the different articles
of which we stood in need.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Mr. Broughton, Mr. Menzies, and some of the
other officers, on friday forenoon, I waited on his excellency
Sen<sup>r</sup> Don Antonio Guitierres, the governor general of
the Canaries, who then resided in the city of S<sup>ta</sup>
Cruz. His excellency received us with the politeness usual on
these occasions, and assured us of his readiness to afford us
every assistance; but apologized that the poverty of the country
prevented his inviting us to his table. Attended by the same
party, on sunday I visited the city of Lagoona, and after
satisfying our curiosity with its external appearance, we
returned to S<sup>ta</sup> Cruz, and dined with Mr. Rhoney, an
Irish gentleman, to whose hospitality we were greatly indebted.
Had we not fortunately met with him immediately on our landing,
we should have been much inconvenienced, as there did not appear
another person on the island who was inclinable to offer us
shelter from the scorching rays of the sun, or to afford us the
smallest refreshment.</p>
<p>We had the mortification, this morning, of finding the small
bower cable cut through nearly in the middle, which seemed to
have been occasioned by an anchor lying at the bottom. The loss
of an anchor in a situation where no other could be procured, was
a matter of serious concern; no pains were spared to regain it
until the afternoon of the 5th, when all our exertions proved
ineffectual; and being apprehensive that other lost anchors might
be in its vicinity, we weighed, went further out, and again
anchored in 30 fathoms water on a soft dark oozy bottom
intermixed with small white shells, having the northernmost
church steeple in a line with the center of the jetty, bearing by
compass <span class="aa">n.</span> 48 <span class="aa">w.</span>
and the southernmost sort <span class="aa">s.</span> 71
<span class="aa">w.</span> about three quarters of a mile from
the town. This anchorage appeared to be far preferable to our
former situation, being nearly as convenient to the landing
place, without the hazard of damaging the cables by anchors which
small vessels might have lost nearer in shore; and which is the
only danger to be apprehended here, as the bottom is good holding
ground, and, to all appearance, perfectly free from rocks.</p>
<p>The surf that had beaten with great violence on the shores for
some days past, and for flickering against which the pier of
S<sup>ta</sup> Cruz is but ill contrived, had much retarded the
Chatham's business of taking on board mingle ballast and
prevented the completion of that object: until late on saturday
night, when we put to sea, and directed our course to the
southward.</p>
<p>The ballast which the Chatham had now taken on board certainly
prevented her being so very crank, but it did not seem to have
contributed to her sailing, as the Discovery still preserved a
great superiority in that respect.</p>
<p>Not having supposed we should have been so long detained at
Teneriffe, I took no steps for making astronomical observations
on shore; those taken on board shewed the longitude by the
chronometer to be 16° 17' 5", only 50" to the west ward of the
true longitude, as laid down in the requisite tables: the
latitude by our observations was 28° 28' 38", and the variation,
by the mean result of all our cards and compasses, was 16° 38',
differing from 15° 58' to 17° 17' westwardly.</p>
<p>For the information of those who may be induced to visit
Teneriffe at this season of the year with the hope of procuring
refreshments, I must remark, that we found the wine, water, and
beef exceedingly good, and were induced to take some days supply
of the latter to sea; but fruit, vegetables, poultry, and all
kinds of live stock were very indifferent, and most extravagantly
expensive.</p>
<p>Towards noon of the 8th, we lost sight of the Canaries. The
trade wind blew a pleasant gale, the sea was smooth, and the
weather, being fine, enabled us to make some excellent lunar
observations; those I took shewed the longitude to be 16° 52'
36"; those taken by Mr. Whidbey 16° 52' 30"; and the chronometer
shewed 16° 47' 45". The latitude, at this time, was 27° 5' north;
and the variation, by three compasses differing from 15° 10' to
18° 51', was 17° 33' 40" westwardly.</p>
<p>Our course from the Canaries was directed to the westward of
the cape De Verds, which we gained sight of and passed on the
forenoon of the 14th. The <span class="aa">n.w</span>. extremity
of the island of St. Antonio appeared, by our observations, to be
situated in 17° 10' north latitude, and 25° 3' 22" west
longitude; the variation of the compass 12° 32' 15" westwardly.
The fresh beef that we had brought from Teneriffe being
exhausted, on the 18th, portable broth and sour krout were again
served to the ship's crews; at this time we had reached the
latitude of 9° 35' north, longitude 23° 27' west, when the
weather, which had been pleasant and attended with a fresh gale
from the <span class="aa">n.e</span>. very materially altered:
the wind slackened and veered round to the north, and the
atmosphere, though not cloudy, was encumbered with a bright haze
nearly approaching to a fog but without the least dampness or
humidity. Through this medium the heavenly bodies were
sufficiently visible whilst terrestrial objects were only
discernible at small distances. This very singular appearance
continued a few days until the 21st, when, in latitude 6° 20'
north, and longitude 22° 40' west, the northerly breeze died
away, the dense atmosphere disappeared, and they were succeeded
by calm, cloudy, hot weather, the thermometer standing from 80°
to 83°, attended with some heavy showers of rain and gusts of
wind in various directions, though generally from the eastern
quarter between <span class="aa">n.e.</span> and south. Our
progress, with this kind of weather, was slow until the 24th,
when, in latitude 4° 25' north, longitude 21° 36' west, we seemed
to have patted the line of those unpleasant and frequently
unhealthy regions. The steadiness of the gentle gale, and the
serenity of the weather indicated our having reached the
<span class="aa">s.e</span>. trade; these conjectures were soon
established by the wind gradually increasing, so that, about
midnight on the 27th, we crossed the equator in 25° 15' west
longitude. The variation to this point had gradually, though not
very regularly, decreased to about 9° westwardly; and the lunar
observations, lately taken, had corresponded within a few minutes
with the longitude shewn by the chronometer.</p>
<p>Crossing the equator so far to the westward has been
frequently objected to, as being liable to entangle ships with
the coast of Brazil. I am, however, of a different opinion, and
conceive many advantages are derived by thus crossing the line;
such as, pursuing a track destitute of those calms and heavy
rains, which are ever attendant on a more eastwardly route. By
every information I have been enabled to collect, it does not
appear that much is to be gained in point of distance by crossing
the equator in a more eastwardly longitude; since it seems that
vessels which have pursued their southerly course to cross the
line under the 10th, 15th, or 20th meridian of west longitude,
have, by the trade wind blowing there in a more southerly
direction, been driven equally as far west, to the 25th, 26th,
and 27th degrees of west longitude before they have been enabled
to gain the variable winds, without the benefit of a constant
breeze and fair weather, which with the very little interruption
between the 21st and 24th, was experienced during this
passage.</p>
<p>From the equator, with a brisk trade wind, we steered with a
full sail and flowing meet; which by the 1st of june brought us
to the latitude of 7° 52' south, longitude 29° 7' west; whence we
ceased stretching further to the westward, and made a course good
a few degrees to the eastward of south; so that on the 9th we had
reached the latitude of 19° 47' south, longitude 27° 27' west,
approaching to the parallel of the islands Trinadada and Martin
Vas. The wind now permitted our steering well to the eastward of
south; but lest an error should have existed in our longitude, or
in that of those islands, I directed the Chatham to increase her
distance from us by holding a south course, for the purpose of
gaining a view of that land; by sun-set we were in the latitude
of 20° 9' south, the parallel of those islands, but saw nothing
of them. The longitude of the former is stated to be 28° 50',
that of the latter 28° 34' west; allowing their longitude, and
that of the ship, to have been accurately ascertained, we passed
them at the distance of 24 and 19 leagues.</p>
<p>On the 12th we crossed the southern tropic in 25° 18' west
longitude; the variation of the compass had now gradually
decreased to 4° 30' westwardly, and having lately taken many very
good lunar distances of the sun and stars on different sides of
the moon, I assumed their mean result as the true longitude, or
nearly so; by which, the observations for the longitude,
according to the chronometer, appeared to be 14' 25" too far to
the eastward; whence it should appear, that it was not gaining
quite so much as had been allowed in consequence of its rate, as
ascertained at Portsmouth. After crossing the tropic of Cancer,
the wind became very variable, as well in point of strength as in
direction, so that on the 28th we had only advanced to the
latitude of 31° 56' south, longitude 4° 18' west.</p>
<p>The weather was in general very pleasant: and the Chatham, to
our great mortification, continued to sail equally slow in light
as in fresh gales, which materially affected the progress of our
voyage; the object of which was of such a nature' that it would
allow of no opportunity being passed by, that, with propriety,
could be embraced for the advancement of geography and
navigation; and as Captain Cook's chart of the Sandwich islands
presented little field for any improvement that could occupy the
several winters we were likely to pass in their vicinity, I
resolved in our way to the pacific ocean to visit the
<span class="aa">s.w</span>. part of New Holland, and endeavour
to acquire some information of that unknown, though interesting
country. Having much business to perform at the cape of Good Hope
in the carpenter's department, it became expedient, for the
carrying into execution the whole of my plan, that no time should
be lost; particularly as our passage from England had already
exceeded the limits of my expectations. These reasons induced me
to make the best of our way in the Discovery to the cape of Good
Hope, and should the Chatham be able to keep up with us, she was
directed so to do; if otherways, Mr. Broughton was provided with
sufficient instructions.</p>
<p>The wind was light and variable, until the 1st july, in
latitude 33° 54' south, longitude 58' 40" west, it blew a fine
gale from the <span class="aa">n.n.e</span>. attended with
pleasant weather; the Chatham until this evening remained in
sight, but in the morning was not within the limits of our
horizon. As we approached the African shore the weather became
very unsettled, with sudden transitions from calms to heavy
gales, attended with much thunder, lightning, and a heavy swell
from the westward and <span class="aa">s.w</span>. One of these
gales, on the 5th, reduced us for a few hours to our courses. The
wind became southwardly with pleasant weather on the 7th, when a
strange sail was descried to the <span class="aa">n.e</span>.
holding a course, as if intending to pass the Cape, and some of
us thinking the sea was discoloured, we tried for soundings, but
found no bottom with 140 fathoms of line. After passing the 27°
of south latitude, many oceanic birds were our constant
companions, consisting of three kinds of albatrosses, the
quebrantahuessos, pintadoes, the sooty, the black, and small blue
petrels, with some few other small birds of the same tribe;
amongst which were but few of the storm petrel, which in these
regions are generally numerous. Most of these, by the 7th, had
disappeared, and, in their place, were seen the blue petrel of
the larger sort, though comparatively in small numbers; at noon
the observed latitude was 35° 13' south, longitude 14° east. The
wind blew a strong gale from <span class="aa">w.s.w</span>. in
the afternoon of the 8th, when judging the cape of Good Hope to
bear from us <span class="aa">n.</span> 66 <span class=
"aa">e.</span> true, distant 18 leagues, we experienced, for the
space of about seven miles, a most extraordinary agitation in the
sea, comparable only to a large cauldron of boiling water; this
was supposed to be the effect of two contending currents, and for
that reason I did not try soundings. I was also particularly
anxious to gain sight of the land, which, in the event of the
chronometer proving correct, there was great probability of doing
before dark; but not seeing it we stood on till ten in the
evening; when, by our lunar observations, supposing the Cape land
to be about eight leagues distant, we hauled to the wind, and
plied in order to preserve our then situation until morning. At
day light the Cape was in sight, bearing east by compass, eight
leagues distant. This instance will, I trust, be not the only one
I shall be able to adduce, to prove the utility of the lunar
method of finding the longitude, and the very great importance
that such information must be of to every sea officer.</p>
<p>At this season of the year, the boisterous weather and the
prevailing winds from the <span class="aa">n.w</span>. rendering
Table Bay not only excessively unpleasant but insecure, our
course was directed to False Bay. At noon, the observed latitude
was 34° 26' south, the cape of Good Hope then bearing
<span class="aa">e.n.e</span>. 5 or 6 miles distant. This
promontory, and the dangerous rocks that lie in its
neighbourhood, we passed, and stood into False Bay, where in the
evening, the weather falling calm, we anchored in 40 fathoms
water; the Cape bearing west by compass, 10 miles distant;
Simon's Bay <span class="aa">n.n.w</span>. and the False Cape
<span class="aa">s.e</span>. in this situation the chronometer
shewed the longitude to be 18° 52' 45", making an error, or
variation in its rate of going, as ascertained at Portsmouth, of
18' 30" equal to 1' 14" of time since the first day of March;
which will, without doubt, be received and considered as being
very correct; it also corresponded with my observations, and what
on that subject I had noticed on the 12th of june.</p>
<p>Our passage through the atlantic ocean being thus
accomplished, it becomes requisite, in compliance with the method
proposed in the introduction for correcting the errors of
navigation, to have some retrospect to this passage, especially
since passing the Cape de Verd islands.</p>
<p>From the island of St. Antonio, until we had crossed the
latitude of cape St. Augustine, we were materially affected by
currents; and between the latitude of 6° north and the equator,
strong riplings were conspicuous on the surface of the sea. These
currents, contrary to the general opinion, seem to possess no
regularity, as we found ourselves, day after day, driven in
directions very contrary to our expectations from the impulse we
had experienced on the former day, and by no means attended with
that periodical uniformity, pointed out by Mr. Nicholson in his
lately revised and corrected Indian directory, published in the
year 1787. On the contrary, instead of the currents at this
season of the year, agreeably to his hypothesis, setting to the
northward, the most prevailing stream we experienced set to the
south, and more in a south eastern than a south western
direction. This very able mariner, hull wedded to formerly
adopted opinions, strongly recommends the variation of the
compass, as a means for ascertaining the longitude at sea: yet,
had we been no better provided, we might have searched for the
cape of Good Hope agreeably with his proportions, to little
effect: for when we were in latitude 35° 7' south, with 20° 16'
west variation, we had only reached the longitude of 6° 30' east;
and again, when in latitude 35° 22' south, with 22° 7' west
variation, we had only advanced to the longitude of 11° 25' east,
instead of being, according to Mr. Nicholson's hypothesis, in the
first instance nearly under the meridian of the cape of Good
Hope, and in the second, under that of cape Aguilas; and it was
not until we had near 26° of west variation, that we approached
the meridian of the cape of Good Hope. The observations for the
variation were made with the greatest care and attention; and
though generally considered as very correct, they differed from
one to three, and sometimes four degrees, not only when made by
different compasses placed in different situations on board, and
the ship on different tacks, but by the same compass in the same
situation, made at moderate intervals of time; the difference in
the results of such observations, at the same time, not
preserving the least degree of uniformity. Hence the assertion
amounts nearly to an absurdity, which states, "that with 20° to
20° 10', or 20° 30' westwardly variation, you will be certain" of
such and such longitude; and it is greatly to be apprehended,
that navigators who rely on such means for ascertaining their
situation in the ocean, will render themselves liable to errors
that may be attended with the most fatal consequences. Other
methods are, I trust, in a fair train for accomplishing this
desirable object; and I yet hope to see the period arrive, when
every seafaring person capable of using a quadrant, will, on due
instruction, be enabled by lunar observations to determine his
longitude at sea. It has been already observed, that such
information may be acquired with ease, and without laborious
study or tedious application; this was further warranted by our
example on board the Discovery; where, on our departure from
England, Mr. Whidbey and myself could be considered as the only
proficients in this branch of science; but now, amongst the
officers and gentlemen of the quarter deck, there were several
capable of ascertaining their situation in the ocean, with every
degree of accuracy necessary for all the important purposes of
navigation.</p>
<p>With a light southwardly breeze in the morning of the 10th we
weighed anchor, and with the assistance of our boats a-head,
towing the ship, we reached Simon's Bay at about seven in the
evening, where we anchored in 12 fathoms water; False Cape
bearing by compass in a line with the south point of the bay
<span class="aa">s.</span> 37 <span class="aa">e.</span> Noah's
ark <span class="aa">s.</span> 51 <span class="aa">e.</span> the
Roman rocks <span class="aa">s.</span> 86 <span class=
"aa">e.</span> and the flag-staff on the battery <span class=
"aa">s.</span> 89 <span class="aa">w.</span> about a quarter of a
mile from the shore.</p>
<p>The day before a brig was seen in shore of us, which was
supposed to be the Chatham; but as the private signal was not
acknowledged by her, we concluded ourselves mistaken. Our first
conjectures, however, proved to be right, as Mr. Broughton now
informed me the signal had escaped their attention. Since we had
separated, the Discovery had outsailed her consort only the
night's run; the Chatham not having hauled her wind or shortened
sail on friday night, she was the next morning within the same
distance of the land as the Discovery. Nothing had occurred
during this separation worthy of notice. I was made excessively
happy to understand from Mr. Broughton, that the officers and
crew of the Chatham, like those of the Discovery, were in general
very healthy. Beside the Chatham, we found here His Majesty's
ship the Gorgon; the Warren Hangings, and Earl Fitzwilliam
Indiamen, from Bengal; two port Jackson transports from China
bound home; three with convicts bound to port Jackson; two
American, and some Dutch and Danish merchant ships; the total
amounting to seventeen sail in the bay.</p>
<p>In the morning, an officer was sent on shore to acquaint the
resident commandant of the port, Mr. Brandt, of our arrival, and
to request his permission to procure such refreshments and stores
as our wants now demanded, and to erect our observatory and such
tents on shore as might be requisite for carrying into execution
the necessary refitment of the vessels; with all which Mr. Brandt
very politely complied; and, on the return of the officer, the
garrison was saluted with eleven guns; which compliment being
equally returned, attended by Mr. Broughton and some of the
officers I waited on Mr. Brandt, who received us with the
greatest politeness and hospitality; the well known
characteristics of that gentleman. Having, on a former occasion,
benefited by his good offices in the excellency of the supplies
provided for the Resolution and Discovery, I concerted measures
with him, on the present, for the like purpose. Mr. Brandt
undertook, in conjunction with Mr. De Wit of Cape Town, to see
all our necessities provided for with the bed of the several
commodities the country afforded. The Discovery's bowsprit, being
found infinitely too weak, was taken out in order to be
strengthened by one of the fishes we had on board; the whole of
the head railing, having been washed away, was to be replaced;
the vessels wanted caulking fore and aft; the rigging,
overhauling; casks to be set up for receiving provisions and
water; the sails repairing, and several materially altering; the
powder airing; and the fields and booms raising, for the better
enabling of the people to work upon deck; the ship proving
sufficiently stiff to admit of such accommodation. Artificers
were hired to assist our own in these several duties; which being
in a state of forwardness by the 14th, Mr. Broughton and myself
paid our respects to Mr. Rhenias, the acting governor at Cape
Town, with the further view of inspecting the stores and
provisions, the major part of which were to come from thence.
Four of our seamen, whose constitutions seemed unequal to the
service in which they had engaged, and whom I had now an
opportunity of replacing, were sent on board the Warren Hastings;
and, with her, on the 18th, sailed for England.</p>
<p>All our stores and provisions being forwarded from Cape Town
by the 5th, we took leave of the governor and our Cape friends,
from whom we had experienced the most attentive civility; and
having completed such observations as were wanted, the
observatory with the instruments were, on the 9th, sent on
board.</p>
<p>By the 11th all our transactions were finished with the shore;
having obtained for each vessel a supply of provisions, which
completed our flock for eighteen months at full allowance, and a
due proportion of stores for the like period. I took on board
also seven ewes and six rams; an assortment of garden seeds, vine
cuttings, and other plants that were likely to grow, and prove
valuable acquisitions to our friends in the South-Sea islands. As
I intended putting to sea the next day, we were busily employed
in preparing the ship for that purpose, which on the morning of
the 12th we attempted; but the wind shifting to the <span class=
"aa">s.s.e</span>. permitted our taking only a more outside birth
for the better convenience of sailing when the wind should prove
more favorable.</p>
<p>It is customary at the cape of Good Hope for so many of the
officers as can conveniently be spared, to take up their
residence on shore. In this respect I had conformed to old
practices, but was excessively mortified, at my return on board,
to find that several of our people had within a few days become
indisposed with a dysentery, which at first seemed of little
importance, but had now put on a very serious appearance; and
some of the patients were extremely ill. The cause of this
unfortunate malady it was hard to ascertain: the crew had not
been subject to inebriety; their provisions had been of the best
quality, and most wholesome nature; and every precaution had been
taken to prevent their sleeping on deck, or exposing themselves
to the dew or night air. No neglect of the salutary measures
generally observed, or individual indiscretion of any sort seemed
to have produced this lamentable visitation, whose contagious
influence suffered no one to escape unattacked; although myself
and officers did not feel its effects so violently as they were
experienced by the people. The same disorder had not only
appeared on board the Chatham, and the transports bound to port
Jackson, but on shore; and at length it was attributed to a large
Dutch ship lately arrived from Batavia, from which many men had
been sent on shore to the hospital very ill, and dying with that
and other infectious disorders. The surgeon of the Discovery was
seized in a very sudden and singular manner, and reduced to an
extreme state of delirium, without any other symptoms which
indicated fever.</p>
<p>To persons, situated as we were, on the eve of quitting the
civilized world, and destitute of all help and resources, but
such as we carried with us, such a calamity was of the most
serious and distressing nature; and was not only severely felt at
the moment, but tended to destroy the good effects we had every
reason to expect from the very excellent and abundant supply of
refreshments the Cape had afforded. I now became excessively
anxious to get to sea, lest the Batavian ship should communicate
any other disorder, or a worse species of that with which we were
already attacked. This earned desire, a <span class=
"aa">s.e</span>. wind and calms prevented our accomplishing until
the 17th, when, about noon, a light breeze springing up from the
<span class="aa">n.w</span>. we sailed, in company with the
Chatham, out of Simon's Bay, and saluted the garrison with eleven
guns which were equally returned.</p>
<p>Few of our transactions, whilst at our last station, appeared
worthy of recording excepting the occurrences at the observatory,
where I did not think any observations were at all necessary for
ascertaining the longitude; as that must have been accurately
determined long ago by persons of greater information and
superior abilities. The latitude; the rate and error of the
chronometer, and the variation and dip of the magnetic needle
were the principal objects that occupied our attention. The
former would not have attracted much of my notice had it not
appeared by the first day's observations, that a very material
difference existed between the latitude shewn by my observations,
and the latitude of Simon's Bay as stated by Captain King in the
3d vol. of Cook's Voyage to the northern hemisphere, where, in
page 484, it is said that "the latitude of the anchorage place in
Simon's Bay is, by observation, 34° 20' south." This however is,
most probably, an error of the press, since, immediately
afterwards, we find the Cape point is said to be in 34° 23'
south; which point is at least 12 or 13 miles to the southward of
Simon's Bay. Our observatory was situated near the south point of
this bay, and its latitude, deduced from 26 meridional altitudes
of the sun and stars, was 34° 11' 40"; this, on allowing the
distance to the Cape point, will be nearly found to agree with
its latitude; which was further confirmed by our observations on
passing it the day we entered False Bay.</p>
<p>By the first observations, made on shore, the chronometer
shewed the longitude to be 18° 39' 45", which was 17' 45" to the
eastward of the truth, and corresponded with what has been stated
before, that it was not gaining at the rate we had allowed:
further observations however demonstrated that, although it might
have been gaining less during the passage, it was now evidently
gaining on its Portsmouth rate, and was found on the 8th of
august at noon, to be fast of mean time at Greenwich 17' 49" 6'",
and gaining on mean time at the rate of 9" 28'" per day. Mr.
Arnold's chronometer was found to have gone but indifferently on
board the Chatham; and, at the observatory, it was fast of mean
time at Greenwich 1 h 18' 48" 6", and gaining on mean time at the
rate of 16" 11'" 8"" per day. The variation of the magnetic
needle, taken at the observatory by our different compasses and
cards, in twenty sets of azimuths, varied from 24° 3' to 27° 48';
the mean result being 25° 40' west variation.</p>
<p>The vertical inclination of the south point of the magnetic
needle was observed to be</p>

<br>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> nature of our voyage rendering
every precaution necessary to prevent, as far as was possible, a
separation of the vessels, Mr. Broughton, in case of parting
company, was provided with a list of rendezvous; and, the better
to insure our rejoining, I now deemed it expedient that he should
be furnished with a copy of my instructions, and the route I
intended to pursue; together with ample directions, that, in the
event of a total separation, he might be enabled to carry the
objects of the expedition into execution.</p>
<p>Although our stay at the Cape had far exceeded my
expectations, yet I did not abandon the design of visiting the
<span class="aa">s.w</span>. part of New Holland. The season
would probably be too far advanced for acquiring so much
information as I could have wished, yet there still remained a
fair prospect of obtaining some intelligence, which would render
the task less difficult to those, whose particular object it
might hereafter be to explore that country. I therefore on
sailing out of False Bay, appointed our next rendezvous off, what
in the charts is called, Lyon's Land, in about the 35th degree of
south latitude&mdash;in case of separation to cruise there two
days; and, not meeting with the Discovery, then to proceed
agreeably to other instructions.</p>
<p>The Albemarle, Admiral Barrington, and Britannia transports
bound to port Jackson, followed us out of the bay: of these
ships, as well as of the African coast, we took leave in the
evening, and directed our course to the southward. During the
night, the wind veered to the <span class="aa">n.w</span>. and
blew so hard a gale that we were obliged to double reave the
topsails and take in the foresail, as the Chatham was a great
distance astern; and not being in sight at day-break, we hauled
to the wind: about seven she was seen to the westward, and,
having joined company, we steered to the <span class=
"aa">s.s.e</span>. together. The <span class="aa">n.w</span>.
wind gradually increased, attended with violent squalls and heavy
rain, until the 20th; when it became a perfect storm, obliging us
to strike the top gallant masts, and reducing us to the foresail,
which we were necessitated to carry, though under great
apprehension of its being blown to pieces, in order that we might
reach a more temperate region. The sea ran excessively high, and
the wind in violent flurries raised the spray into a kind of fog,
or mist, which, at intervals, was quite salt when not mixed with
the showers of rain, which were frequent, and very heavy: in one
of these we again lost sight of the Chatham, and seeing nothing
of her on its clearing away, the foresail was furled, and the
ship brought to, under the storm staysails. In this situation,
the Discovery proved much easier and drier than we had reason to
expect, as she was now extremely deep with stores and provisions.
At this time, we were visited by many albatrosses, and an
innumerable variety of birds of the petrel tribe. About noon our
consort was again in sight, and, on her joining company, we
resumed our course to the <span class="aa">s.e</span>. under the
foresail. This very boisterous weather, accompanied with much
thunder and lightning, continued with intermissions sufficient
only to tempt our spreading some additional canvas, (which was
scarcely unfurled before it was again necessary to take it in)
until the 22d; when it so far moderated as to permit the close
reaved topsails to be kept set. In the afternoon, we passed the
Albemarle and Admiral Barrington. The sight of these vessels was
very grateful to our feelings, particularly of the latter, which
we had understood was an old debilitated ship, for whose safety
during the late violent stormy weather we had been greatly
apprehensive. The wind, in the morning of the 23d, being
moderate, the top-gallant, and studding-sails were set; the
weather, however, was unsettled, with showers of hail and rain;
and a heavy irregular swell rolled at the same time from the
northward and south west. In the intervals of fine weather, I got
some lunar observations which shewed the longitude at noon to be
31° 55'; the chronometer by the Portsmouth rate 31° 29'; by the
Cape rate 31° 42'; the latitude 39° 8'. Many whales were now
playing about the ship, but a less number of oceanic birds
attended us than usual.</p>
<p>The weather being tolerably fair on the 24th, enabled me to
make some further lunar observations. The mean result of these,
and those taken the preceding day <i>brought forward by the
chronometer</i>, shewed the longitude at noon to be 34° 13'. By
this expression is to be understood the space east or west, which
the ship may have passed over in the interval of time between the
taking one set of lunar observations and that of another; the
extent of which space is ascertained, not according to the vague
mode of the ship's run, as appears by the log, but from the
distance shewn by the chronometer; where by the result of many
observations made in different situations are reduced to any one
particular point. The chronometer at this time, by the Portsmouth
rate, shewed 33° 50', by the Cape rate 34° 5', the latitude 39°
28', and the longitude by account 36° 17'. The weather continued
very changeable; but the wind being gentle in the northern
quarter afforded an opportunity of fending on board the Chatham,
whence we understood that, in consequence of a violent sea having
stove in the midship stern window on the morning of the 20th, it
had been necessary to bring to until that damage was
repaired.</p>
<p>The wind freshened, attended with frequent squalls, on the
26th; when, having reached latitude 39° 45', longitude 37° 53',
we were able for the first time since our departure from the Cape
to observe the variation; which, by the mean result of two
compasses, differing from 32° 53' to 35° 5', was found to be 32°
59' westwardly. In the space we were now approaching, namely,
between the meridians of 38° 33' and 43° 47' east longitude, and
the parallels of 34° 24', and 38° 20' south latitude, seven
different shoals are said to exist. To acquire some information
respecting a circumstance so interesting to navigation, I had
held this southerly course; but the very stormy weather we had
lately contended with, and the appearance of its again returning,
rendered a search for these shoals not altogether prudent. To
attempt the examination of the whole space I considered as not
more necessary than discreet; but since in the event of their
existence, it was highly probable they would be found connected,
I was induced to shape a course so as to fall in with the south
easternmost, said to lie in latitude 38° 20', longitude 43° 43',
which had been reported to have been seen by several Dutch
vessels. On the 28th, in latitude 38° 56', longitude 42° 30', the
wind at <span class="aa">w.s.w</span>. increasing with great
violence obliged me to desist from this enquiry, and for our own
safety, in the event of these shoals having existence, to hawl to
the <span class="aa">s.e</span>. The gale soon became a storm,
attended with heavy squalls, hail, rain, and a most tremendous
sea, from the westward and <span class="aa">s.w</span>. which
made it necessary to strike the top-gallant masts, and reduced us
to the foresail; which, with great apprehension of losing it, we
were obliged to carry in order to pass clear of the space
assigned to these hidden dangers. It is, however, worthy of
remark, that, notwithstanding our course was directed so wide of
the allotted spot, we certainly passed it at no great distance in
the night, as by our observations the next day, instead of making
fourteen miles southing, which the reckoning gave, we found
ourselves twelve miles to the north of the latitude we were in
the preceding day, the longitude 45° 4'. Whether this difference
is to be ascribed to any current produced by the interruption
these shoals may give to the oceanic waters, when pressed
eastwardly by the prevailing westwardly winds, or to the bad
steerage of the ship, cannot be positively determined; but as the
Chatham steered precisely the same course, the inference seems
rather favorable to our having been influenced by a current
occasioned probably by the existence of such shoals. On the
violence of the storm abating, we made sail and resumed our
eastwardly course, intending to pass in sight of the islands of
St. Paul and Amsterdam. During the gale we were visited by a
great number of the various kinds of oceanic birds; yet these by
no means seemed to indicate the vicinity of land or shoals, since
they are constantly met with throughout the southern ocean.</p>
<p>The weather that succeeded this storm being delightfully
pleasant, attended with a smooth sea, and a gentle gale between
the north and <span class="aa">n.e</span>. made me regret that we
had not experienced this favorable change somewhat earlier, as it
would probably have enabled us to acquire some satisfactory
information as to the existence of the shoals in question; but
having now no leisure for this enquiry, I was obliged to rest
contented with having exerted our fruitless endeavours in the
attempt, and embraced this valuable opportunity of getting
ourselves and ship clean, dry, and comfortable; which since our
leaving the land had been very ill effected.</p>
<p>The flux still continued amongst us, and some of our patients
were yet very much indisposed; we however were in hopes that the
present fair weather would soon restore to us the blessings of
health. Some good observations were procured in the course of
this and of the preceding day with our different compasses: those
taken on the 31st differed from 30° 45' to 35° 45'; and those on
the 1st of september from 30° 58' to 35° 7'; the mean result of
seven sets of azimuths was 32° 47' westwardly variation; the
latitude at noon 38° 19', and the longitude 51° 21'. We were not
long indulged with a continuance of the fine weather: the wind
gradually veered to the <span class="aa">n.w</span>. and
westward, and increased to a fresh gale; which, however, did not
reduce us below the top-sails; although the weather bore a very
threatening appearance; the sky was obscured with dark gloomy
clouds, from which some rain fell; yet the sea was smooth, and
the weather altogether was infinitely more pleasant than we had
lately experienced.</p>
<p>At noon on the 4th, in latitude 38° 6', longitude 61° 36', the
first seal we had seen since our departure from the Cape amused
itself in playing about the ship for some time; but our
companions, the oceanic birds, had not lately been very numerous;
these visitors were mostly pintadoes, and other small birds of
the petrel tribe.</p>
<p>Four sets of lunar observations were obtained on the 5th,
which shewed the longitude to be 64° 14' 40"; the chronometer by
the Portsmouth rate 63° 46', and by the Cape rate 64° 10', the
latitude 37° 52'. The variation on the 7th, in latitude 38° 15'
and longitude 69° 33', was observed to be 25° 52' westwardly. The
same gloomy weather continued with a fresh gale at <span class=
"aa">n.n.w</span>. In the night we had the misfortune to lose
Neil Coil, one of the marines, who fell a sacrifice to the
baneful effects of the flux caught at the Cape, which attacked
him with much greater violence than any other person on board. He
was an exceedingly good man, and his loss was sensibly felt, and
much regretted. In addition to this calamity, disasters of the
same nature seemed not likely to terminate: another of our
people, who had suffered very severely by this dreadful
contagion, but who was so much recovered as to be nearly equal to
his duty, was so affected by his poor fellow's dissolution, that
he relapsed with very unfavorable symptoms. Our convalescents
were still numerous; and the work of death having commenced, we
knew not where it might end, or where we could recruit the
strength which we might thus lose; our whole complement being
scarcely equal, when in the highest health, to the service we had
to perform. One reflection was, however, highly satisfactory;
that, in point of comfort, and professional assistance, no one
thing within our power to supply, had been omitted for the
present relief of the distress, or for the prevention of any
melancholy consequences in future; and we trusted, with the
Divine blessing, and a steady adherence to the conduct, which we
had observed, finally to subdue and extirpate this dreadful
malady.</p>
<p>In the evening of the 8th I took some lunar distances with the
star Antares, which, with those taken on the 5th, shewed the
longitude by their mean result, to be 73° 44'; the chronometer by
the Portsmouth rate 73° 1', and by the Cape rate 73° 27'; the
latitude 38 45', and the variation 23° 36' westwardly.</p>
<p>The next evening, agreeably to our reckoning, we were passing
between the islands of St. Paul and Amsterdam, distant from the
latter about five or six leagues. The weather was thick and
rainy, yet I continued to hope that a favorable interval would
enable us to see one or both of these islands, having steered
this eastwardly course with a wish to correct an error that
appears in captain Cook's charts of the southern hemisphere. In
these the island of St. Paul is laid down in the latitude of 37°
50', corresponding with the situation assigned to it in the
requisite tables; and to the north of this island, in about the
latitude of 36° 40' is placed another called the island of
Amsterdam: now the island which Mr. Cox in the Mercury stopped
at, and called Amsterdam, is in sight of and situated 17 leagues
to the south of the island of St. Paul. Captain Bligh, in the
Bounty, also saw the same island, and allots to it nearly the
same situation as does Mr. Cox. For these reasons, if there be an
island to the north of St. Paul, in latitude 36° 40', there must
be three instead of two of these islands, which I believe has
never been understood to be the fact. The weather, however,
precluded my forming a just opinion as to this point, which I
fully intended to ascertain, could we have seen either of the
islands; but the rain and haze continuing to obscure every object
at the distance of two leagues, we perceived no indication of the
vicinity of land, notwithstanding the immense number of whales
and seals which are laid to frequent these islands. Of the latter
we did not see any, and of the former but one; which was the only
whale we had observed since that mentioned on the 23d of last
month. From hence towards the coast of New Holland, our course
was directed between the tracks of Dampier and M. Marion, over a
space, I believe, hitherto unfrequented. In this route, assisted
by a fine gale between north and <span class="aa">w.n.w</span>.
we made great progress, so that our observed latitude on the 18th
was 36° 49', longitude 103° 48': for some days past we had
experienced a very heavy swell from the <span class=
"aa">s.w</span>. though the wind prevailed from the
northward.</p>
<p>The situation of that part of New Holland for which we were
now steering, being ill defined, and a probability existing that
banks might extend a considerable distance into the ocean, we
tried, but gained no soundings with 180 fathoms of line. On the
19th, in latitude 36° 45', longitude 105° 47', the variation was
observed to be 14° 10' westwardly. The wind at <span class=
"aa">n.n.e</span>. attended with heavy squalls and rain,
increased with such violence, as to oblige us to strike the
top-gallant masts, and to furl the topsails. The pintado birds
that, for some days past, had nearly disappeared, again visited
the ship, accompanied by a great variety of the petrel tribe,
with some albatrosses; and it now seemed evident, that the
appearance of these inhabitants of the ocean, was increased in
point of numbers and in variety, in proportion to the violence of
the wind; as in moderate weather few only were visible. We
continued to try for soundings at certain intervals, but did not
reach bottom at the depth of 180 fathoms. The wind at
<span class="aa">w.s.w</span>. blew a strong gale, and the night
of the 20th being dark and squally, we hauled to the wind, and
plied; lest the land, which is represented as very low, or
shoals, might be nearer than we expected; at day break we again
resumed our eastwardly course, observing every night the like
precautions.</p>
<p>In the morning of the 23d [September, 1791], conceiving that the
land could not be at any great distance, and that the coast might
lie to the north of the course we were steering, the Chatham's
signal was made to look out on the larboard beam. The wind from
the westward blew a strong gale, accompanied with a very heavy
sea; but the sky being clear, permitted me to obtain some good
lunar observations, which, with those taken on the 21st, shewed
the longitude at noon to be 114° 14'; the chronometer, by the
Portsmouth rate 113° 32', by the Cape rate 113° 55', the latitude
35° 7'. Soon after mid-day, the wind at <span class=
"aa">w.s.w</span>. increased to a very heavy gale; and not
choosing, under such circumstances, to make too free with a coast
entirely unexplored; we hauled the wind to the southward, under
the foresail and storm staysails. Towards sun-set, land was said
to be seen from the mast-head to the <span class=
"aa">e.n.e</span>. and, although this was not absolutely certain,
yet it was extremely probable, as we had passed several leagues
over the space assigned to Lyon's Land in most of the maps. A
press of sail was now carried in order to keep to the windward,
having no bottom at the depth of 120 fathoms; in consequence of
which, and a very heavy sea, the larboard side of the head, with
the bumkin, &amp;c. was entirely torn away. On the gale's
moderating the next morning, we stood to the north, in quest of
the land; but some of the officers conceiving they saw land to
the <span class="aa">s.e</span>. we hauled our wind again in that
direction until noon, in latitude 35° 28', longitude 115° 10',
when, being disappointed, we again stood to the north, under
double reefed topsails, until eight in the evening: we then
tacked to spend the night, which bore a very threatening
appearance, over a space we were already acquainted with, and
found bottom at 70 fathoms depth, composed of white sand, and
broken shells; the latitude at this time was 34° 51', the
longitude 115° 12'. The very gloomy appearance of the night
rendered our carrying a press of sail indispensably necessary to
preserve an offing, as the soundings strongly indicated the land
not to be distant. During the night we did not reach the bottom
with 100 fathoms of line; and the morning evinced our conjectures
respecting the weather not to be ill founded; as, about 4
o'clock, the slings of the main yard were carried away: to
replace which, we were compelled to furl all the sails on the
main-mast; but, before this could be accomplished, the increased
violence of the storm obliged us to take in all our canvas but
the foresail, to strike the top gallant-masts, and to get in the
jib-boom and sprit-sail yard. In this situation we continued
until towards sun-set, when having no bottom with 110 fathoms of
line, we stood to the <span class="aa">n.w</span>. under
close-reefed topsails, in the full assurance of meeting the land
in that direction. In the course of the night, the gale gradually
abated, and in the forenoon of the next day, the wind became
perfectly calm, and an opportunity was afforded us of repairing
the many damages which our rigging had sustained in the late
boisterous weather. At noon the observed latitude was 35 23', the
longitude 115 52'; in this situation, soundings could not be
gained at the depth of 220 fathoms. In the afternoon a light
breeze sprang up from the northward, with which we steered to the
north-eastward, and soon discovered land from the mast-head,
bearing by compass <span class="aa">n.e</span>. to <span class=
"aa">n.</span> 27 <span class="aa">e.</span> It seemed of a
moderate height, resembling in appearance the land in the British
Channel, and was supposed to be about ten or twelve leagues
distant&mdash;No soundings with 120 fathoms of line. The wind
veering to the <span class="aa">n.w</span>. enabled us to steer
for the land, and having neared it about three leagues, it was
seen from the deck bearing <span class="aa">n.</span> 7
<span class="aa">e.</span> to <span class="aa">n.</span> 73
<span class="aa">e.</span> by compass; at which time, bottom was
found at the depth of 65 fathoms, composed of coarse sand, and
broken coral. The depth of water had, at eight in the evening,
gradually decreased to 50 fathoms; when, having advanced about
four miles nearer, we tacked and plied in order to preserve our
situation with the land until morning.</p>
<p>By the result of our soundings during the night, 70 fathoms
would seem to be the edge of a bank about 9 leagues from the
shore, consisting of fine sand, and broken shells, corresponding
with the soundings we had found on the 24th; for had that depth
of water been nearer in shore, we could hardly have avoided
seeing the land before dark on that evening.</p>
<p>At the dawning of day on the 27th, we made all sail for the
land, having a gentle gale from the <span class="aa">n.w</span>.
with a smooth sea and pleasant weather. The depth of water, as we
proceeded, gradually decreased to 24 fathoms, with a bottom of
coral, coarse sand, and shells: about nine we were well in with
the land, and bore away along the coast, keeping within a league
or two of the shores; which by the compass stretched from
<span class="aa">n.</span> 44 <span class="aa">w.</span> to
<span class="aa">n</span>. 81 <span class="aa">e.</span> and
appeared nearly straight and compact, consisting of steep rocky
cliffs to the water's edge, interspersed with, here and there,
some small open sandy bays, and a few islets and rocks, which
extended near a mile from the main. The westernmost land now in
sight, (being the northernmost seen the preceding night) is
remarkable for its high cliffs, falling perpendicularly into the
sea; and if it be detached, which is by no means certain, is
about a league in circuit. It forms a conspicuous promontory, to
which I gave the name of <span class="aa">Cape Chatham</span>; in
honor of that noble earl, who presided at the Board of Admiralty
on our departure from England. The land to the westward takes a
direction from cape Chatham <span class="aa">n.</span> 59
<span class="aa">w.</span> and the land to the eastward
<span class="aa">s.</span> 81 <span class="aa">e.</span> This
Cape, by our observations is situated in latitude 35° 3', and in
116° 35' 30" of longitude.</p>
<p>The flux still continued to affect the health of some in both
vessels; and although the patients were daily assisted with fresh
provisions, and might be considered in a state of recovery, yet
they remained in a very debilitated and reduced condition. In the
hope that a little recreation, from change of scene and what the
soil of this country might afford, would prove salutary to their
enfeebled constitutions, I determined to put into the first port
we should be so fortunate as to discover; and, that an eligible
situation might not escape our vigilance, we ranged the coast
within three or four miles of its shores, which are of moderate
elevation, and may in general be deemed steep and bold. The
verdure on all the projecting points is removed to a considerable
height on the rocks, whose naked bases sufficiently prove how
excessively they are beaten by a turbulent ocean. The country,
immediately along the sea side, consists of a range of dreary
hills, producing little herbage, of a brownish green hue, from a
soil that seems principally composed of white sand; through which
protrude large masses of white rock of various sizes and forms:
these singular protuberances on the summits of many of the hills,
strongly resembled the remains of lofty edifices in ruin. The
interior country afforded a more agreeable appearance, being
pleasantly interspersed with hills and dales, and covered with
lofty forest trees of considerable magnitude, which our glasses
plainly distinguished; though we could nowhere perceive any smoke
or other indication of the country being inhabited. Towards noon,
the Chatham made the signal for having discovered a port to the
northward; into which they were directed to lead; but finding it
only a shallow bay, we soon bore away along the coast. Our
observed latitude was 35° 8', longitude 117° 6' 30". In this
situation, the coast, by compass, extended from <span class=
"aa">n.</span> 68 <span class="aa">w.</span> to <span class=
"aa">s.</span> 83 <span class="aa">e.</span> the nearest shore
bearing <span class="aa">n.</span> 6 <span class="aa">w.</span>
about a league distant; in the morning the variation by our
surveying compass was observed to be 6° 30' westwardly. The coast
we passed along in the afternoon differed little from that
noticed in the morning, but the inland country was not
sufficiently elevated to be seen beyond the hills near the sea
side. At six in the evening, a small detached islet bore, by
compass, <span class="aa">s.</span> 87 <span class="aa">e.</span>
the easternmost part of the main in sight <span class=
"aa">n.</span> 86 <span class="aa">e.</span> a projecting point
whence extends westward a long range of white cliffs <span class=
"aa">n.</span> 76 <span class="aa">e.</span> the nearest shore
<span class="aa">n.</span> 24 <span class="aa">e.</span> distant
5 miles; and the westernmost land in sight, the same which formed
the eastern extreme at noon, <span class="aa">n.</span> 45
<span class="aa">w.</span> The wind was very gentle with
alternate calms, and the weather, during the night, was mild and
pleasant. In the morning of the 28th, we found our progress had
been very slow along the coast, although our distance from the
shore had increased, with soundings from 40 to 50 fathoms. We had
again an opportunity of observing the sun eclipsed, but were not
so fortunate as to notice its commencement, or greatest
obscuration; the end was however observed by Mr. Whidbey to be at
19° 43' 53", and by myself 19° 43' 46" apparent time; this was
ascertained by our sextant telescope, as recommended on a former
occasion. I much regretted that we had not gained a port on this
coast, where, on shore, we might have compared such observations
with the results from better instruments, which would have tended
to establish the utility of the process. The latitude at this
juncture was 35° 25'. It was now proved, that the white cliffs
seen the preceding night, formed the southernmost point of this
part of the coast, which I distinguished by the name of Cape
Howe, in honor of that noble earl. It is situated in latitude 35°
17', longitude 117° 52'. The small detached islet lies from cape
Howe <span class="aa">s.</span> 68 <span class="aa">e.</span>
distant 3 leagues. The land considered on tuesday night as the
easternmost part of the main now appeared to be an island, beyond
which were seen a high rocky bluff point, and a high mountain
forming the easternmost land in sight. A light breeze from the
<span class="aa">n.n.w</span>. permitted us to draw in with the
coast; which at noon bore by compass from <span class=
"aa">n.</span> 50 <span class="aa">w.</span> to <span class=
"aa">n.</span> 37 <span class="aa">e.</span> the high mountain
<span class="aa">n.</span> 35 <span class="aa">e.</span> to the
eastward of which, a round hummock, seemingly detached
<span class="aa">n.</span> 52 <span class="aa">e.</span> the land
appearing like an island, <span class="aa">n.</span> 16
<span class="aa">w.</span> to <span class="aa">n.</span> 24
<span class="aa">w.</span> was now seen to comprehend a cluster
of barren rocky isles, which being the nearest land was about 10
miles distant; and the high rocky bluff point <span class=
"aa">n.</span> 8 <span class="aa">e.</span> In this situation,
the observed latitude was 35° 22', longitude 118° 16'; which was
8 miles further south, and 11 miles further east than the log
shewed. Many whales were playing about the ship during the
morning. The high mountain conspicuously remarkable for its
superior elevation above the neighbouring hills, I distinguished,
after my highly esteemed friend Sir Alan Gardner, by the name of
<span class="aa">Mount Gardner</span>; and the barren rocky
cluster of isles, by the name of <span class="aa">Eclipse
Islands</span>. The weather was pleasant; and aided by a gentle
breeze, a port, round the high rocky bluff point, soon presented
itself, into which the Chatham was directed to lead, and, by
four, was sufficiently advanced to determine on its eligibility.
The weather by this time had become thick and rainy, with much
thunder and lightning; but as the soundings continued regular, we
stood into the port, and passed the high rocky bluff point in 30
fathoms water; directing our course close along its shore, which
is a high and nearly perpendicular cliff; the sounding suddenly
shoaled to 12 fathoms, and gradually decreased afterwards, until
abreast of the second white sandy beach; where we anchored in 6
fathoms water, having a clear bottom of fine white sand.</p>
<p>A continuation of the thick weather prevented our seeing about
us until the morning of the 29th; which being delightfully serene
and pleasant, discovered our situation to be very snug and secure
in a spacious sound, open 13° of the compass only to the sea. The
high rocky bluff point forming the <span class="aa">s.w</span>.
extremity of the sound, which, from its smooth appearance, and
being destitute of verdure, obtained the name <span class=
"aa">Bald-Head</span>, bore by compass <span class="aa">s.</span>
85 <span class="aa">e.</span>; a high rocky island in the
entrance, which, from its beaten appearance by its opposition to
the sea, and <span class="aa">s.w</span>. wind, obtained the name
of <span class="aa">Break-Sea Island</span>, <span class=
"aa">n.</span> 82 <span class="aa">e.</span> to <span class=
"aa">n.</span> 69 <span class="aa">e.</span>; Mount Gardner
<span class="aa">n.</span> 70 <span class="aa">e.</span>; another
high island named <span class="aa">Michaelmas Island</span>
<span class="aa">n</span>. 62 <span class="aa">e.</span>; a small
high island called <span class="aa">Seal Island</span>, being a
great resort of those animals, north; a low flat rock
<span class="aa">s.</span> 75 <span class="aa">w.</span> and to
the <span class="aa">n.w</span>. was an extensive white sandy
beach; which promising success to the seine, a boat was
dispatched with Lieutenant Puget on a fishing party. After
breakfast, accompanied by Mr. Broughton in the Chatham's cutter,
Mr. Menzies, Mr. Whidbey, and myself, proceeded in the yawl,
first to attend the success of the fishermen, and then to examine
if the sound would afford a more eligible situation than that
which we now occupied. The seine was hauled on the third sandy
beach from Bald-Head with little success. A stream of fresh water
drained there through the beach, which, although nearly of the
colour of brandy, was exceedingly well tasted; by this stream was
a clump of trees, sufficient to answer our present want of fuel.
At the borders of this clump was found the most miserable human
habitation my eyes ever beheld, which had not long been deserted
by its proprietor, as on its top was lying a fresh skin of a
fish, commonly called leather jacket, and by its side, was the
excrement of some carnivorous animal, apparently a dog. The shape
of the dwelling was that of half a beehive, or a hive vertically
divided into two equal parts, one of which formed the hut, in
height about three feet, and in diameter about four feet and an
half; it was however constructed with some degree of uniformity,
with flight twigs, of no greater substance than those used for
large baker's baskets: the horizontal and vertical twigs formed
intervals from four to six inches square, and the latter flicking
a few inches into the earth, were its security and fixed it to
the ground. This kind of basket hut was covered with the bark of
trees, and small green boughs; its back was opposed to the
<span class="aa">n.w</span>. whence we concluded those to be the
most prevailing winds; just within its front, which was open the
whole of its diameter, a fire had been made, but excepting the
skin of the fish before mentioned, there were neither bones,
shells, nor other indication on what its poor inhabitant had
subsisted. The reflections which naturally arose on seeing so
miserable a contrivance for shelter against the inclemency of
seasons, were humiliating in the highest degree; as they
suggested in the strongest manner the lowly condition of some of
our fellow creatures, rendered yet more pitiable by the apparent
solitude and the melancholy aspect of the surrounding country,
which presented little less than famine and distress.</p>
<p>The shores consisted either of steep naked rocks, or a
milk-white barren sand, beyond which dreary boundary, the surface
of the ground seemed covered by a deadly green herbage, with,
here and there, a few groveling shrubs or dwarf trees scattered
at a great distance from each other. This very unfavorable
appearance may not, however, originate from the general sterility
of the soil, since it was evident, so far as we traversed the
sides of the hills, that the vegetation had recently undergone
the action of fire; the largest of the trees had been burnt,
though slightly; every shrub had some of its branches completely
charred; and the plants lying close to the ground had not escaped
without injury. Thus entertaining no very high opinion of the
country, but in the hope of meeting with some of the wretched
inhabitants, we proceeded along the shores of the sound, to the
northward, to a high rocky point that obtained the name of
<span class="aa">Point Possession</span>; and, on reaching its
summit, we gained an excellent view of the sound in all
directions. When on board, we had supposed that the sound
branched into three arms, but it now became evident that there
were only two. One, immediately behind this point which is also
its southern point of entrance, extended in a circular form,
about a league across, bounded by a country much resembling that
before described, though producing more trees, and with verdure
of a livelier hue, and approaching more nearly to the water's
edge. The other, lying about 3 miles to the <span class=
"aa">n.e</span>. seemed almost as spacious, though its entrance
appeared very narrow. The surrounding country in its
neighbourhood presented a far more fertile and pleasing aspect.
Nearly in the center of that harbour, was an island covered with
the most beautiful herbage; and instead of the naked rocks and
barren sands that compose the coast of the sound, the cliffs
which bounded these shores seemed of a reddish clay, and the
general texture or character of the soil, appeared to be more
favorable to the vegetable kingdom, as from the summits of the
hills to the water side was seen a stately and luxuriant
forest.</p>
<p>The necessary observations being made at this station, the
British colours were displayed, and having drank His Majesty's
health, accompanied by the usual formalities on such occasions,
we took possession of the country from the land we saw
north-westward of Cape Chatham, so far as we might explore its
coasts, in the name of His present Majesty, for him and for his
heirs and successors. This port, the first which we had
discovered, I honored with the name of <span class="aa">King
George the Third's Sound</span>; and this day being the
anniversary of Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte Augusta
Matilda's birth, the harbour behind Point Possession I called
<span class="aa">Princess Royal Harbour</span>; which with the
sound formed Point Possession into a peninsula, united to the
main by a very narrow barren sandy beach. Here although we could
not discover the least trace of its having at any time been the
resort of the natives, yet in every part where we strayed, were
seen the same effects of fire on all the vegetable
productions.</p>

<br>
<p>The ceremony of taking possession being finished, we found a
passage, narrow and shoal for some distance, into the
north-eastern harbour; where a bar was found to extend across its
entrance, on which there was only three fathoms water. Within the
harbour, the deep water seemed to occupy some space to the
<span class="aa">n.e</span>. and <span class="aa">n.w</span>.;
but the day was too far advanced to permit our making any
particular examination. The verdant island covered with luxuriant
grass and other vegetables terminated the extent of our
researches; and as the situation of the vessels seemed as
convenient as any other for procuring what the sound might
afford, I determined to return on board, and lose no time in
availing myself of the benefits it presented. In our way out of
this harbour, the boats grounded on a bank we had not before
perceived; this was covered with oysters of a most delicious
flavour, on which we sumptuously regaled; and, loading in about
half an hour, the boats for our friends on board, we commemorated
the discovery by calling it <span class="aa">Oyster
Harbour</span>.</p>
<p>In the morning of the 30th, we began cutting wood and
providing water, which sufficiently employed all our healthy men;
whilst those who were still indisposed were directed to amuse
themselves on shore. Finding it practicable to place the ship
much nearer to the spot whence the wood and water were procured,
the next day she was removed; and, by sunday, we had made such
progress, that the yawl could be spared for the further
examination of the sound. In her I proceeded to Princess Royal
harbour, where, near a rocky cliff, on the <span class=
"aa">s.w.</span> side, was found a small shallow stream of
excellent water. On tracing its meanders through a copse it
brought us to a deserted village of the natives, amidst the
trees, on nearly a level spot of ground, consisting of about two
dozen miserable huts mostly of the same fashion and dimensions,
with that before described, though no one of them seemed so
recently erected. This village had, probably, been the residence
of, what may in this country be esteemed, a considerable tribe;
and the construction of it afforded us an opportunity of
concluding, that however humble the state of their existence
might be, they were not destitute of distinctions. Two or three
huts were larger, and differed in shape from the rest, as if a
couple were fixed close to the side of each other; but the parts
which in that case would have caused a separation were removed,
and the edges joined close together, as described in the plate,
leaving the whole of their fronts open, and increasing their
diameter about one third more than the rest. Yet were they not an
inch loftier, nor were they of greater extent from the front to
the back than the single one before mentioned. Fires had been
made in the fronts of all, but not recently; and, excepting some
branches of trees that seemed to have been lately broken down,
there were not any signs of this place having been visited for
some time; and although we were very industrious to ascertain the
food on which the inhabitants of this village subsisted, we still
remained in ignorance of it; as neither shells, bones, nor any
other relicts, which might serve as indications, could be found,
notwithstanding this place had the appearance of a principal
resort; for besides the habitations already mentioned, which were
in pretty good repair, there were many others in different states
of decay. This spot was intersected with several small streams of
water, yet the same marks of fire were evident on all the
vegetable kingdom; although none of the huts seemed to have been
affected by it, which led me to suppose that this general fire,
was of a less recent date than at first I had imagined. In one of
the larger huts, probably the residence of a chief, towards which
were several paths leading in different directions, some beads,
nails, knives, looking glasses, and medals, were deposited as
tokens of our friendly disposition, and to induce any of the
natives, who might, unperceived by us, have been in the
neighbourhood, to favour us with a visit. Having gratified our
curiosity, though at the expence of our feelings, in
contemplating these very wretched and humiliating efforts of
human ingenuity, we returned on board, and having by the morning
of the 4th replenished our water, and taken on board a supply of
firewood, Messrs. Puget and Whidbey went to Oyster Harbour, with
three boats, for the purpose of hauling the seine, and obtaining
a quantity of those shell fish, previously to our proceeding the
following morning to sea. In this part of our plan, however, we
were disappointed, as the wind which had blown a steady moderate
breeze from the <span class="aa">n.w</span>. towards the evening
blew a strong gale from the <span class="aa">s.e</span>. with a
heavy swell, and prevented the return of the boats; at the same
time that the cloudiness of the weather precluded me from making
those lunar observations, for the sole purpose of obtaining which
I had remained on board.</p>
<p>The gale moderating the next morning, the boats returned, not
having been very successful with the seine, but bringing a
sufficient supply of oysters not only for our convalescents, but
for the affording also of two or three excellent meals for all
hands. As the <span class="aa">s.e</span>. wind and a heavy sea
in the offing prevented our departure, Mr. Broughton was employed
in examining the eastern side of the sound from Oyster Harbour to
Mount Gardner: this was found nearly a straight and compact
shore, on which Mr. Broughton landed in several places, where the
same effects of fire were evident, although there were not any
traces of the natives or of their habitations to be
discovered.</p>
<p>The like causes of detention still operating, on friday the
7th a party was made for the further examination of Oyster
Harbour, and by a little excursion into the country on that side
to acquire some information of its natural productions, and, if
possible also, of the natives. After examining the channel as we
proceeded to the upper part of the harbour, our attention was
directed to several large black swans in very stately attitudes
swimming on the water, and, when flying, discovering the under
parts of their wings and breast to be white: this is all the
description we were enabled to give of them, since they were
excessively shy, and we very indifferent marksmen. In the
northern corner of the harbour, we landed near a rivulet
navigable only for canoes and small boats. It meandered in a
northern direction between the hills, which opening to the east
and west, presented a spacious plain with forest trees occupying
the banks of the rivulet, and the sides of the hills, even to
their very summits. We proceeded about a league by the side of
the rivulet, which flowed through so dead a flat, that its motion
was scarcely perceptible, and continued to be brackish, although
in its passage it received several other smaller streams of most
excellent water. In it were an abundance of very fine fish, and
on its banks were many black swans, ducks, curlews, and other
wild fowl. On the sides of this stream, as well as on the shores
in Oyster Harbour, were seen the remains of several fish wears,
about eight or nine inches high, evidently the sorry contrivance
of the wretched inhabitants of the country: some of these were
constructed with loose stones, others with sticks, and stumps of
wood; but none of them were likely to be of much utility at this
season, as several were placed nearly at, and others above, what
now seemed the high water mark; but we supposed at times, when
the rain or other cause should extend the rivulet beyond its
present bounds, which in width did not exceed thirty yards, and
in depth four or five feet, these humble contrivances might
arrest some small fish. Great bodies of water evidently pass down
this stream at certain seasons, as appeared by the river's course
occupying from two to three hundred yards on each side the
rivulet, the soil of which was composed of sea sand and broken
shells, and was destitute of any vegetable production. This space
when overflowed must, from its winding course, form a most
beautiful sheet of water. The wears for the taking fish, and
steps made in the bark for the purpose of ascending some of the
largest trees, though both excessively rude, were undoubtedly the
effects of manual labour, and, with the huts, formed the only
indications of the country being inhabited, that we were able to
discern. There were no paths in the woods, nor were any smokes to
be seen over the extensive country we beheld, which fully
satisfied us, that any further search for the natives would be
fruitless; and therefore we returned by a different route to the
boats. In our way we saw the remains of two similar huts. Near
these was an ants nest much of the same shape and magnitude,
though finished in a very superior style and manner, and shewing
how very humble is the state of human existence, when unassisted
by civil society, and undirected by the sciences. Having eaten
our salt beef we proceeded homewards, much mortified that the
many wild fowl we had seen had escaped our vigilance; but that we
might not return empty handed, we stopped at one of the oyster
banks, where in about half an hour we loaded our boat, and
returned on board about 9 o'clock in the evening. The bank on
which we found them in greatest plenty and the best flavoured, is
that which extends from the north or low point of the entrance
towards the little verdant island. The wind blew a strong gale
from the <span class="aa">e.s.e.</span> and a very heavy sea ran
without the sound; but the vessels within rode perfectly quiet.
This sort of weather, with much rain, continued until monday,
when we entertained hopes of getting to sea, as the wind veered
to the south; but soon again resuming its former direction,
attended by the heavy sea in the offing, we remained at anchor
until the next day; which being more favourable to our purpose,
though the wind was still adverse, we weighed, and turned out of
the sound. About 4 in the afternoon, we regained the ocean; but
the wind at <span class="aa">e.n.e</span>. prevented our steering
along the coast, and obliged us to stand to the south-eastward.
Whilst we were getting under weigh, I caused to be deposited in
the hut at the watering place, some beads, knives,
looking-glasses, and other trinkets, as a compensation to its
solitary owner, should he ever return, for the wood we had cut
down, and deprived him of: and to commemorate our visit, near the
stump of one of the trees we had felled, in a pile of stones,
raised for the purpose of attracting the attention of any
European, was left a bottle sealed up, containing a parchment on
which were inscribed the names of the vessels, and of the
commanders; with the name given to the sound, and the date of our
arrival and departure. Another bottle, containing a similar
memorandum, was likewise deposited on the top of Seal Island,
with a staff erected to conduct any visitor to it, on which was
affixed a medal of the year 1789. Those who may meet with the
staff will most probably discover the bottle hidden near it. This
precaution was here taken, on a presumption that Seal Island was
entirely out of the reach of the inhabitants, which might not be
the case where the first bottle was secreted.</p>
<p>At sun-set the Eclipse Islands by compass bore <span class=
"aa">n.</span> 74 <span class="aa">w.</span> Bald-head
<span class="aa">n</span>. 45 <span class="aa">w.</span> Mount
Gardner <span class="aa">n.</span> 13 <span class="aa">e.</span>
the hummock mentioned on the 28th, now evidently an island,
<span class="aa">n.</span> 56 <span class="aa">e.</span> to
<span class="aa">n.</span> 51 <span class="aa">e.</span> and the
easternmost part of the main in sight <span class="aa">n.</span>
42 <span class="aa">e.</span> whence the coast appeared to take a
sharp turn to the northward. As we stood to the <span class=
"aa">s.e</span>. the wind gradually veered to the north, which,
by day light, led us out of sight of the coast; but as in the
forenoon it was calm and the atmosphere very clear, Mount Gardner
was seen bearing <span class="aa">n.w</span>. 18 leagues distant.
In this situation we had much swell from the eastward; and
soundings could not be gained at the depth of 200 fathoms. The
observed latitude was 35° 37', longitude 119° 24', which was 2'
to the south, and 16' to the east, of what the log shewed. The
wind was light and variable until the evening, when it settled in
a steady breeze at <span class="aa">s.w</span>.; the swell from
the east, and <span class="aa">e.s.e</span>. still continuing,
indicated the land in that direction to be at some distance. Our
unexpected detention by the late eastwardly winds, and the
advanced season, conspired greatly against prosecuting researches
on this coast; I determined, however, not to abandon that
favorite object, provided the task should not prove too
dangerous, and intricate; or that the direction of the coast
should not lead us too far out of our way; as, in respect of the
former, I acted without any authority in the investigation; and,
in respect of the latter, our time would not now admit of
sufficient leisure to persevere in the pursuit. Under these
considerations our course was directed to the <span class=
"aa">n.e</span>. during the night, in hopes of passing within
sight of the land lying to the eastward of Mount Gardner, so as
to connect our survey. Not gaining bottom with 110 to 140 fathoms
of line; and there being at daybreak no appearance of the coast,
we steered north, which soon brought us within sight of land to
the <span class="aa">n.w</span>. making like three islands; but
on a nearer approach, the two westernmost were evidently
connected by low land to the main: but the connecting of the
northernmost being uncertain, it obtained the name of
<span class="aa">Doubtful Island</span>.</p>
<p>From the westernmost land seen this morning, to the
easternmost land seen on tuesday evening, is a space of 14
leagues, stretching <span class="aa">s.</span> 58 <span class=
"aa">w.</span> and <span class="aa">n</span>. 58 <span class=
"aa">e.</span> in which no land was seen. The depth of water was
at this time 30 fathoms; the bottom coarse sand, with broken
shells and coral. The weather was delightfully pleasant; and,
with a gentle gale at <span class="aa">s.w</span>. we steered
along the coast, which now took a direction <span class=
"aa">n.</span> 55 <span class="aa">e.</span> our distance from
the shore from 2 to 4 leagues. Doubtful Island, and the shores to
the <span class="aa">s.w</span>. of it, nearly resembled the rest
of the coast; but to the <span class="aa">n.e</span>. the coast
presented a very different prospect being composed of high
detached clusters of craggy mountains, on a base of low and to
all appearance level land, well wooded, particularly to the
<span class="aa">n.w</span>. of Doubtful Island, where the land
falls back to a considerable distance, forming either a deep
well-sheltered bay, or a low flat country. At noon, a high bluff
point, extending from the northernmost cluster of mountains, the
easternmost land then in sight, bore by compass <span class=
"aa">n.</span> 24 <span class="aa">e.</span> the most western and
conspicuous cluster of apparently disunited mountains
<span class="aa">n</span>. 67 <span class="aa">w.</span> about 9
leagues distant; and the east point of Doubtful Island, the
westernmost land at that time visible, <span class="aa">s.</span>
73 <span class="aa">w.</span> This land forms a remarkable point
on the coast, and is in latitude 34° 23', longitude 119 49';
which, after admiral Lord Hood, I distinguished by the name of
<span class="aa">Point Hood</span>. In this situation, our
observed latitude was 34° 18', longitude 120° 14'; being 13' more
to the north, and 6' more to the east, than appeared by the log.
Soon after mid-day, low land was descried, stretching out from
the high bluff point, which we found situated not immediately on
the shore, but some distance inland, whence a very low country
extends to the sea coast, which takes a direction <span class=
"aa">s.</span> 70 <span class="aa">e.</span> breakers in two
detached places were discovered at this time lying at some
distance from the land; the nearest of these about 1 o'clock,
bore by compass <span class="aa">n.e.</span> 4 miles distant; the
other, visible only from the masthead, appeared to lie from the
former <span class="aa">e.</span> by <span class="aa">n.</span> 2
leagues distant. At this time the depth of water was 35 fathoms;
and as the wind blew directly on the shore, and the main land,
though not more than 4 leagues off, was not sufficiently high to
be distinctly seen from the deck; we hauled our tacks on board,
and stood to the <span class="aa">s.e</span>. increasing our
distance very slowly. At six in the evening, the nearest land was
a rocky island, about 2 miles in circuit, which bore by compass
<span class="aa">n.</span> 13 <span class="aa">e.</span> 8 miles
distant; and from the mast-head, the flat low coast was visible
as far as <span class="aa">e.n.e</span>.; at 9 the depth of water
had gradually increased to 40 fathoms. Considering our present as
the most prudent tack to remain upon until we should meet shoals,
or other impediments, I directed the Chatham to lead and sound;
our depth gradually increased to 54 fathoms, and the coast in the
morning was in sight from <span class="aa">n.e</span>. to east.
The wind blew a light breeze from the <span class=
"aa">s.s.e</span>. with which we steered for the land until about
nine, when we tacked in 60 fathoms. The land in sight, at that
time, from the mast-head bore by compass from <span class=
"aa">n.n.w.</span> to <span class="aa">e.</span> by <span class=
"aa">n.</span> each extremity 5 or 6 leagues distant; all this
was supposed to be the main, though between north and
<span class="aa">e.n.e</span>. the land appeared somewhat broken,
occasioned perhaps by some of its parts being elevated a little
above the rest of the shore, off which breakers were seen to lie
at some distance; and the land, which in the morning bore east,
and now bore by compass <span class="aa">n.</span> 87
<span class="aa">e.</span> 8 miles distant, was evidently a rocky
island about a league in circuit, much resembling that which we
passed the preceding evening. It proved the termination of our
researches on this coast, and thence obtained the name of
<span class="aa">Termination Island</span>; on it the sea broke
with much violence, and between it, and the main, was a small low
islet. The great depth of water indicated that the bank of
soundings, which we had hitherto found extending along the coast,
terminated also on its approach to this island, as we had no
where found so great a depth of water at this small distance from
the shore; which, on being increased a few miles only, put the
ship intirely out of soundings. At noon, the observed latitude
was 34° 34'. longitude 121° 52'; 22 miles further east, and 4
further north than shewn by the log. In this situation the main
land from the mail-head was seen bearing by compass <span class=
"aa">n.n.w</span>. to <span class="aa">e.n.e</span>. ½
<span class="aa">e.</span>; and Termination Island situated in
latitude 34° 32', longitude 122° 8½'; <span class="aa">n.</span>
84 <span class="aa">e.</span> Between the easternmost part of the
main, seen the preceding evening, and the westernmost seen this
morning, is a space of 10 leagues, which we passed in the night
without observing land; yet, from the regularity of the
soundings, there can be little doubt of its being one continued
coast, and that the course by us made good <span class=
"aa">s.</span> 76 <span class="aa">e.</span> is nearly parallel
to its direction. The whole of this low country presented a
dreary aspect, destitute of wood, or herbage, and interspersed
with white and brown patches, occasioned, most probably, by the
different colours of sand or rock, of which it is composed. We
here noticed more coast and oceanic birds, than we had seen on
any other part of the shores: as, besides gunnets, and two or
three different sorts of tern, albatrosses, and petrels,
particularly the black and sooty, were in great abundance. The
weather continued very fine, with a light variable breeze in the
eastern quarter, which drew us, not only out of sight, and some
distance from the coast, but prevented our making much progress
in the direction, in which it seemed to bend, until the 16th;
when the wind, settling in the western board, we steered to the
<span class="aa">e.n.e</span>. in hopes of falling in with the
land; and in the event of its taking a more northerly direction,
the Chatham was ordered to look out 3 leagues on the larboard
beam. At noon, the observed latitude was 35° 30', the longitude
122° 40'. At this time, the wind suddenly shifted to the
southward, and was accompanied by a very heavy swell in that
direction, which strongly indicating the approach of boisterous
weather, the Chatham's signal was made to join, and our course
was directed to <span class="aa">e.s.e</span>.; not daring, under
all the circumstances of our situation, to run the risk of
encountering bad weather on an unexplored coast, that presented
to us so many dangers. Besides, as the lowness of the shores
which we had lately seen, and the distant shoals that we had
found extending from them, would exact particular caution as we
proceeded, more time would necessarily be required in the
prosecution of such an inquiry, than the main object of our
voyage would at present allow. I was therefore compelled to
relinquish, with great reluctance, the favorite project of
further examining the coast of this unknown though interesting
country; and, directing our route over an hitherto untraversed
part of these seas, we proceeded without further delay towards
the pacific ocean.</p>

<br>
<hr class="tenth">
<br>
<p><span class="aa">Although</span> the considerations adverted
to in the foregoing chapter, rendered it impracticable to explore
the <span class="aa">s.w</span>. coast of New Holland to the
extent my wishes first led me to imagine, and prevented our
ascertaining its boundary and connection with, or separation
from, Van Dieman's Land; yet the information we have acquired,
will open a field to those whose duty it may hereafter be to
perform that task; by shewing, that its <span class=
"aa">s.w</span>. part may be approached with the greatest safety,
as its shores are bold with regular soundings to the distance of
8 or 9 leagues; and by the discovery of the very excellent
harbour in King George the Third's Sound. Considering therefore
its situation and conveniences as likely to become of material
importance to those whose pursuits may induce them to navigate
this and the pacific ocean, it may not be uninteresting to
detail, in a more particular manner, the circumstances that
occurred during our visit to a country hitherto so little known
to Europeans.</p>
<p>Our survey comprehended an extent of 110 leagues, in which
space we saw no other haven or place of security for shipping
than the sound before mentioned; notwithstanding the opinion of
Dampier, who has considered the whole of the western part of New
Holland as consisting of a cluster of islands. He was undoubtedly
a judicious observer, of very superior talents; and, it is most
likely, formed his opinion from the many islands which he found
composing the exterior coast of the <span class="aa">n.w</span>.
part of this extensive country. However just may be his
conclusions as to that part of New Holland, they certainly do not
apply to its south western side, as no very material separation,
either by rivers, or arms of the sea, was discovered in the
neighbourhood of our survey. Had such breaks in the coast
existed, and had they escaped our observation, it is highly
probable we should have met in the sea, or seen driven on its
shores, drift wood and other productions of the interior country.
The very deep colour also of the several streams of water may
possibly be occasioned by the quality of the soil through which
they flow; whence it may be inferred that, if any considerable
inland waters had their source far in the country, or if any
great body descended from its shores, the sea along the coast
would in some measure have been discoloured; but neither of these
evidences existed, for, on our approach to the land, there was no
previous appearance to indicate its vicinity. This opinion was
further corroborated on inspecting the habitations and places of
the natives' resort; where not the least remains of canoes, or
other circumstance presented itself, which could convey the most
distant idea of these people having ever trusted themselves on
the water; a circumstance which it is reasonable to suppose would
sometimes have happened, had their country been insulated, or
their travelling interrupted by large rivers or arms of the sea;
especially as all appearances favored the conjecture of their
being, by no means, a stationary people. There was great reason,
however, to conclude, that the country was well supplied with
fresh water; as wherever we chanced to land, we easily procured
that valuable article, not only where the soil was of
considerable depth, but from streamlets issuing out of the solid
rocks. This seemed to be the case even on the most elevated land,
which caused a very singular appearance when the sun shone in
certain directions on those mountains whose surfaces were
destitute of soil; for on these made humid by the continually
oozing of the water, a bright glare was produced that gave them
the resemblance of hills covered with snow.</p>
<p>Our researches afforded little matter worthy of notice
excepting such as appertained to King George the Third's Sound.
This port has its entrance in latitude 35° 5', longitude 118°
17'. It is easily known on approaching it from the westward, as
it is the first opening in the coast that presents any appearance
like an harbour, eastward of cape Chatham. The Eclipse Islands
being the only detached <i>land</i> that can be so regarded, are
an excellent guide to the sound, having, between them and
Bald-head, some rocks on which the sea breaks with great
violence. The port is safe, and easy of access any where between
its outer points of entrance, Bald-head, and Mount Gardner, lying
<span class="aa">n.</span> 62 <span class="aa">e.</span> and
<span class="aa">s.</span> 62 <span class="aa">w.</span> 11 miles
distant from each other. Mount Gardner is not less conspicuous
and useful in pointing out the sound from the eastern quarter,
than in its being rendered very remarkable by its handsome shape,
and its rocky, and almost uninterrupted polished surface to its
summit. Its base may be said rather to form the eastern extent of
the coast, than the opposite point of the sound, there being
within it a projection which more properly forms the <span class=
"aa">n.e</span>. point of the sound, lying from Bald-head
<span class="aa">n.</span> 30 <span class="aa">e.</span> about 5
miles distant. Between these latter points are Michaelmas, and
Break Sea islands, each about a league in circuit, one mile
apart, nearly equidistant between the two points, and affording
to all appearance good channels on every side. The water suddenly
decreases in its depth from 30 to 12 fathoms; the latter depth
uniformly continuing across from point [t]o point, I should
conceive, must be an additional means of preventing any very
heavy sea from rolling into the sound; which, in the most exposed
place of anchorage convenient to the shore, is only open from
<span class="aa">e.</span> by <span class="aa">n.</span> to
<span class="aa">s.e.</span> by <span class="aa">e.</span>
Between these limits are situated the two islands above
mentioned, whence the sound extends <span class="aa">w.</span> by
<span class="aa">n.</span> about two leagues to Point Possession,
and from our anchorage to Oyster Harbour, north about the same
distance, with regular soundings in mid-channel of 12 to 15, and
10 to 6 fathoms close to the shore, excepting near Seal Island,
where there is a hole of 21 fathoms. The Discovery and Chatham
were moored in a situation, not only very convenient as to
communication with the shore, but I believe, in perfect security
as it respected the element: for although the sea broke sometimes
with such violence on Break Sea Island, that the surf ranged to
its elevated summit, during a continuance of the boisterous
weather; yet it did not occasion us the least inconvenience. A
more eligible situation if required in the sound might very
probably be met with above the flat rock, as vessels would be
there more completely land locked; and a convenient sandy cove,
easily to be discovered in that neighbourhood, a stream of
excellent fresh water flows into, which though to all appearance
not better in quality than the water we received on board, was
yet more pleasing to the eye, not being of so deep a colour.</p>
<p>Princess Royal's Harbour admits of a passage into it about a
quarter of a mile wide; nearest to the northern shore the depth
is 5 or 6 fathoms, but on the southern, not more than 2½ and 3
fathoms water; occasioned by banks of coral rock which are very
conspicuous, and, not being liable to any of the violent
agitations of the sea, are by no means dangerous. Within the
points of entrance, the depth is regularly from 4 to 7 fathoms,
and the bottom clear, good holding ground. This depth, though
occupying part only of the harbour, yet affords a sufficient
space for several vessels to ride in safety.</p>
<p>Oyster Harbour is rendered admissible alone for vessels of a
middle size, by the shallowness of the water on the bar,
extending from shore to shore, on which we found 17 feet water
only, although the depth increased from 5 to 7 fathoms on each
side. The deep water within the harbour did not seem of any great
extent. In both these harbours the communication with the country
is rendered unpleasant by the shallow depth of water in most
places extending to a great distance from the shore. This
inconveniency could easily be remedied, should it ever be an
object so to do, by wharfs; although it is not unlikely that on a
more minute inspection the necessity for such a measure would
cease to appear.</p>
<p>In navigating the sound, we did not observe any danger that
was not sufficiently conspicuous to be avoided: circumstances
however did not admit of our acquiring that satisfactory
information respecting Princess Royal and Oyster harbours which
fall into it, that could have been wished; yet so far as relates
to the sound, the annexed sketch will I believe be found to
contain no very material error.</p>
<p>The appearance of this country along the coasts, resembles, in
most respects, that of Africa about the cape of Good Hope. The
surface seemed to be chiefly composed of sand mixed with decayed
vegetables, varying exceedingly in point of richness; and
although bearing a great similarity, yet indicating a soil
superior in quality to that in the immediate neighbourhood of
Cape Town. The principal component part of this country appeared
to be coral; and it would seem that its elevation above the ocean
is of modern date, not only from the shores, and the bank which
extends along the coast being, generally speaking, composed of
coral, as was evident by our lead never descending to the bottom
without bringing up coral on its return; but by coral being found
on the highest hills we ascended; particularly on the summit of
Bald-Head, which is sufficiently above the level of the sea to be
seen at 12 or 14 leagues distance. Here the coral was entirely in
its original state; particularly in one level spot, comprehending
about eight acres, which produced not the least herbage on the
white sand that occupied this space; through which the branches
of coral protruded, and were found standing exactly like those
seen in the beds of coral beneath the surface of the sea, with
ramifications of different sizes, some not half an inch, others
four or five inches in circumference. In these fields of coral,
(if the term field be allowable,) of which there were several,
sea shells were in great abundance, some nearly in a perfect
state still adhering to the coral, others in different stages of
decay. The coral was friable in various degrees; the extremities
of the branches, some of which were nearly four feet above the
sand, were easily reduced to powder, whilst those close to, or
under the surface, required some small force to break them from
the rocky foundation from whence they appeared to spring. I have
seen coral in many places at a considerable distance from the
sea; but in no other instance have I seen it so elevated, and in
such a state of perfection.</p>
<p>In the lower lands we frequently met with extensive tracts
occupied by a kind of okerish swampy peat, or moorish soil of a
very dark brown colour, forming as it were a crust, which shook
and trembled when walked upon; with water oozing through, or
running over the surface, in all directions. Through this soil
most of the streams take their course, and it is to their
impregnation in the passage, that the general high colour of the
water is to be attributed. These swamps were not always confined
to low and level spots, but were found on the acclivity of the
higher lands; and where these did not occupy the sides of the
hills, the soil was deep, and appeared infinitely more productive
than the surface of the plains; especially that through which the
rivulet in Oyster Harbour has been mentioned to flow. In that
plain we found, at irregular intervals, just beneath the surface,
a substratum of an apparently imperfect chalk, or a rich white
marle, seemingly formed of the same decayed shells, with which
the course of the river abounded. These strata, about eight or
ten yards broad, run perpendicularly to the rivulet; their depth
we had not leisure to examine, although there seemed little doubt
of finding this substance in sufficient abundance for the
purposes of manure, should the cultivation of this country ever
be in contemplation. The general structure of it seems very
favorable to such an attempt, as the mountains are neither steep
nor numerous; nor do the rising grounds form such hills as bid
defiance to the plough, while they produce that sort of diversity
which is grateful to the eye, and not unpleasant to the
traveller.</p>
<p>This chalky earth was also found in the neighbourhood of a
moorish soil; and, on a more minute examination, seemed much to
resemble an earth described in Cronstadt's Mineralogy at the
bottom of his note (<i>y</i>), page 21. It did not shew any signs
of effervescence with acids, nor did it burn into lime; but, like
the earth alluded to, contains a number of small transparent
crystals. These were visible without a microscope; and as, on
applying the blow pipe, vitrification took place, it might
probably be usefully appropriated in making a sort of
porcelain.</p>
<p>The stones we found were chiefly of coral, with a few black
and brown pebbles, slate, quartz, two or three sorts of granite,
with some sand stones, but none seeming to possess any metallic
quality.</p>
<p>The climate, if a judgment may be formed by so short a visit,
seemed delightful: for though we contended with some boisterous
weather on our approach to the coast, nothing less ought
reasonably to have been expected at the season of the vernal
equinox, and breaking up of the winter. The gales we experienced
in King George the Third's Sound, were not of such violence as to
put vessels at sea past their topsails; although whilst the
<span class="aa">s.w</span>. wind continued a most violent sea
broke with incredible fury on the exterior shores. This however
can easily be imagined, when the extensive uninterrupted range
which the wind in that direction has over the Indian ocean is
taken into consideration; during the continuance of this wind the
atmosphere was tolerably clear, though the air was keen.
Farenheit's thermometer, at the time of year answering to the
beginning of april in the northern hemisphere, stood at 53°; but
at all other times during our stay, varied between 58° and 64°,
and the barometer from 29° 90' to 30° 50'. Slight colds were
caught by the crew, which ought rather to be imputed to their own
want of care than to the climate, as, on getting to sea, the
parties soon recovered. Our convalescents in the flux received
much benefit, though their health could not yet be considered as
thoroughly re-established. These circumstances induced an
opinion, that the climate and soil bid fair to be capable of
producing all the essentials, and many of the luxuries of life;
although on the subject: of agricultural improvement, I felt
myself as unqualified to determine, as to enumerate
scientifically the several trees, shrubs, and plants with which
the country abounds. Of the two latter there appeared a great
variety, and I believe afforded to Mr. Menzies much entertainment
and employment. Amongst the most remarkable was the gum plant,
found every where in great abundance, and answering, in all its
characters, to the description and representation of that plant
found at port Jackson, as mentioned in Philips's voyage. Wild
celery was found in quantities sufficient for our pea-soup, and
daily to supply the people by way of sauce to their salted meat:
this with samphire were the only eatable vegetables we procured.
Other plants were numerous, and afforded a great variety of
beautiful flowers. The shrubs also were abundant, and of many
species; but neither these nor the trees grew so closely together
as materially to incommode travelling, even in the neighbourhood
of Oyster Harbour, where the country is very well wooded; and as
the branches of the trees do not approach within several feet of
the ground, an extensive view is admitted in every direction. The
forest trees seemed of four different sorts. The most common much
resembled the holly, but these were not of the larger sort; that
which I took to be the gum tree of New South Wales, by its
foliage and its producing a considerable quantity of gum, seemed
to be a hard, ponderous, close-grained wood: of this description
the larger trees seemed chiefly to consist; one of these measured
9 feet 4 inches in girth, and was of a proportionable height.
Those from which our fuel was procured were of the myrtle tribe,
not unlike the pimento of the West Indies, in shape, appearance,
and aromatic flavor of the foliage; and in the hard and close
texture of the wood, which makes an excellent and pleasant fire,
burning cheerfully yet consuming slow; whilst, from the smoke, a
very spicy agreeable fragrance is exhaled. These do not, in
general, grow to large timbers; but there is another species much
resembling them, with rather broader leaves, and possessing like
them an aromatic flavor, which grow to a considerable size.
These, with a species not unlike the silver tree of the cape of
Good Hope, were the trees that were found generally to compose
the forest.</p>
<p>For the benefit of those who may visit the country hereafter,
some vine-cuttings and water-cresses were planted on the island
in Oyster Harbour, and at the place from whence we procured our
fuel; and an assortment of garden seeds, with some almonds,
orange, lemon and pumkin seeds were sown. The whole being the
produce of Africa, I should have entertained little doubt of
their success, had it not been, that there was much to apprehend
in their being over-run by the natural productions of the
country.</p>
<p>Of the animal kingdom, so far as relates to the tenants of the
earth, little information was derived. The only quadruped seen
was one dead kangaroo; the dung, however, of these or some other
animals feeding on vegetables, was almost every where met with,
and frequently so fresh as to indicate that the animal could not
be far removed.</p>
<p>Of the birds that live in or resort to the woods, the vulture
may be said to be the most common, as we saw several of this
species, or at least, birds that were so considered. Hawks of the
falcon tribe, with several others of that genus; a bird much
resembling the English crow, parrots, parroquets, and a variety
of small birds, some of which sung very melodiously, were those
which attracted our attention the most; but all were so
excessively wild and watchful, that few specimens could be
procured. Of the water fowl, the black swan seemed as numerous as
any other species of aquatic birds in the neighbourhood of Oyster
Harbour, but they were seen in no other place. There were also
black and white pelicans of a large sort, seen at a distance; and
though ducks were in great numbers, we were very unsuccessful in
taking them. A very peculiar one was shot, of a darkish grey
plumage, with a bag like that of a lizard hanging under its
throat; which smelt so intolerably of musk that it scented nearly
the whole ship. There were also many grey curlews, and sea-pies;
of the latter we procured a few, which were excellent eating. The
aquatic birds before enumerated, with shags, the common gull, two
or three sorts of tern, and a few small penguins of a blueish
colour, included the whole of the feathered tribe in the vicinity
of the shores.</p>
<p>With the productions of the sea, we were not much more
acquainted; which is rather to be attributed to our want of skill
as fishermen than to its want of bounty. Some of the few fish we
caught were very excellent, particularly of the larger sort; one
much resembling the snook, and another the calipevar of Jamaica,
both of high flavor; as was a kind of fish not unlike, nor
inferior in quality to, the English red mullet. These, with the
common white mullet, rock fish, mackerel, herrings, and a variety
of small fish, were those we procured, though not in any
abundance.</p>
<p>Whilst on the coast, whales and seals were frequently playing
about the ship; of the latter, we saw about a score at one time
on Seal Island. The little trouble these animals took to avoid
us, indicated their not being accustomed to such visitors. The
throat and belly of these seals, which were of a large sort, were
nearly white; between the head and shoulders, the neck rises in a
kind of crest, which, with the back, was of a light brown colour;
their hair was exceedingly coarse; the carcase very poor, and
afforded little blubber; which, however, may be imputable to the
season.</p>
<p>Reptiles and noxious animals seemed by no means to be
numerous, as only two or three yellow, and bronze-coloured snakes
were seen, which were good eating; these, with a few lizards of
the common sort, and some about eight or nine inches long of a
thick clumsy make, dark colour, and altogether excessively ugly,
were what composed that race of animals. Some beautiful beetles,
common flies, and muskitoes, were occasionally met with, but not
in such numbers as to produce inconvenience.</p>
<p>It would now remain to say something of the human species, the
inhabitants or this country; but as we were not so fortunate to
procure an interview with any one of them, all that can be
advanced on this subject must be founded on conjecture or nearly
so, and consequently very liable to error: it may, however, not
be unacceptable to state such circumstances as, on the spot,
occurred to our observation.</p>
<p>The natives appeared to be a wandering people, who sometimes
made their excursions individually, at other times in
considerable parties; this was apparent by their habitations
being found single and alone, as well as composing tolerably
large villages.</p>
<p>Besides the village I visited, Mr. Broughton discovered
another about two miles distant from it, of nearly the same
magnitude; but it appeared to be of a much later date, as all the
huts had been recently built, and seemed to have been very lately
inhabited. It was situated in a swamp, which might probably have
been preferred to a higher and firmer land for the convenience of
water. One or two huts of a larger size were here also observed;
the rest were precisely of the same description with those in the
neighbourhood. The larger trees in the vicinity of both villages,
had been hollowed out by fire, sufficiently to afford the shelter
these people seemed to require. Upon stones placed in the inside
of these hollow trees fires had been made, which proved that they
had been used as habitations, either for the inferior of the
party, which would argue a further degree of subordination
amongst them, or for those who were too indolent to build
themselves the wattled huts before described. No one species of
furniture or utensil was discovered in any of the houses; the
only implements seen, were pieces of sticks intended as spears,
rudely wrought, and the operation of manual labour upon them but
slightly discernible. The bark was stripped off, and the thickest
end, after having been burnt in the fire, was scraped and reduced
to a blunt point, on one of which some blood was found still
adhering.</p>

<br>
<small>A DESERTED INDIAN VILLAGE in KING GEORGE III
SOUND.</small></p>
<br>
<p>Destitute (as they seemed) of the means, and totally ignorant
of every mode of embarkation, it is not likely that they place
much dependence on marine productions for their subsistence; yet
it was evident from the wears on the shores, and from the mouths
of the brooks near the villages being stopped up, that they
sometimes resort to the rivulets and to the sea for provisions.
On this account, it was considered rather extraordinary, that the
bones of the fishes on which they had fed were no where to be
found; and this led to a supposition that those which their
endeavours enabled them to procure were very small. It appeared
still more extraordinary that, since they drew a certain
proportion of their food from the sea, they should not have
discovered so excellent a part of its produce as oysters and
clams; notwithstanding that the latter show themselves on the
beaches over which they must frequently walk; and that the former
at low water require only wading half-leg deep on the shoals that
extend from the main land to gather in a few minutes a day's
subsistence. Neither did it appear that they had any knowledge of
these, the limpets, nor any other shell fish found amongst the
rocks; or if they had, for some reason not easily to be imagined,
they certainly made no use of them; otherwise their shells in all
human probability would have been seen near the places of their
resort. Hence it may naturally be inferred, that the land
principally supplies their wants, or hunger would long since have
conducted them to such excellent resources. This opinion is
supported by the extreme shyness of the feathered creation, and
the wildness of the quadrupeds, whose footing, and the other
signs of their being at no great distance without our obtaining
any sight of them, sufficiently proved that they were constantly
pursued. This circumstance may furnish a probable conjecture on
the cause of the very extraordinary devastation by fire, which
the vegetable productions had suffered throughout the whole
country we traversed. Fire is frequently resorted to by rude
nations, either for the purpose of encouraging a sweeter growth
of herbage in their hunting grounds, or as toils for taking their
wild animals, of which they are in pursuit. When the forest is
set on fire for such purposes in a dry season, its ravages may
become very extensive; and the inflammatory quality of the gum
plant, which is here in great abundance, may operate to promote
that general havock which we observed in the vegetable
kingdom.</p>
<p>The destructive operations of fire were, however, evident in
places where the gum-plant was not found for a considerable
distance; and, positively speaking, in our excursion on shore, we
did not see a spot that produced any vegetables, which had not
visibly felt its effects. Where the country was well wooded, the
loftiest timbers had the topmost of their branches burned; yet
none seemed totally destroyed by it; and where the luxuriance of
the soil had obliterated its baneful appearance amongst the
growing shrubs and plants, the ground, on examination, was found
strewed over with the remains of branches and stumps that had
been partially consumed by fire. Had this conflagration been
occasioned, as some of us supposed, by repeated storms of violent
lightning and thunder, it is reasonable to imagine we should have
seen the forest trees much torn and shattered to pieces; which in
no instance was observed.</p>
<p>As nothing further occurred, worthy any particular notice, I
shall conclude my remarks on this country by dating the
astronomical and nautical observations that were made for
ascertaining its situation, and for other purposes of
navigation.</p>

<p>Our observations with regard to the tides were rather
indecisive, as their fluctuation in the sound seemed to be
greatly influenced by the force and direction of the wind; our
last visit however to Oyster Harbour afforded an opportunity of
noticing, that the rise and fall appeared on that day to be about
four feet, and that it was high water 3h 42' after the moon
passes the meridian. Whilst on the coast the vessels were
constantly found to be further advanced, than what the run of the
log intimated; but whether this was occasioned by errors in this
practice, or by a current continually pressing eastward along the
coast, we had no positive means of discovering; though, from our
conclusions at the time, the latter should seem to be the case,
as the log was not only used with much circumspection, but the
line was frequently remeasured, and always found according to its
due proportions.</p>

<p>By the last rate the chronometer was 17½' to the east of
Captain Cook's longitude of this rock, and made the mean
difference of the longitude of this coast, 18' 45", to the
eastward of Captain Cook's calculations; whence it would appear,
that either the chronometer had acquired that error since our
departure from King George the Third's Sound, or that we had
placed that port a few miles too far to the eastward. The nearest
land at six in the evening, was the south cape of Van Dieman's,
which bore by compass <span class="aa">n.</span> 24 <span class=
"aa">w.</span> 6 or 7 leagues distant. Having now a fine gale at
<span class="aa">n.n.e</span>. we took two reefs in the topsails;
shaped a course for Dusky Bay in New Zealand; and by signal to
the Chatham, appointed Facile Harbour in that bay as the next
place of rendezvous.</p>
<p>The dysentery, though nearly subdued on board both vessels,
had left those who had been afflicted with it in a very feeble
and reduced state; and not knowing of any place so easily within
our reach, where such excellent refreshments could be procured
with so much facility, together with timber for planks, spars for
tent poles, &amp;c. &amp;c. of which we stood in great need, I
was induced to make choice of Dusky Bay, notwithstanding the
inconvenience it labours under from the great depth of water, and
want of anchorage in its entrance.</p>
<p>A favorable wind, attended in general with tolerably fine
weather, varied between the <span class="aa">n.</span> and
<span class="aa">w.</span> and afterwards between the
<span class="aa">w.</span> and <span class="aa">s.</span> with
fresh gales, until the 2d of november; when about 9 in the
forenoon we were brought within sight of the coast of New
Zealand, bearing by compass <span class="aa">e.n.e</span>. 12 or
14 leagues distant. We stood for the land, making all sail with a
fresh breeze at <span class="aa">s.w.</span>; but the weather was
so exceedingly hazy, that it was one o'clock in the afternoon
before it was plainly distinguished; when Five Finger Point was
seen bearing by compass <span class="aa">n.e</span>. 7 leagues
distant, and the west cape <span class="aa">e.</span> by
<span class="aa">n.</span> ½ <span class="aa">n.</span> The wind
in the evening veered round to the <span class="aa">n.n.w</span>.
and being light, with alternate calms, the boats were hoisted out
to tow; by which means, and with the additional assistance of a
heavy swell rolling up Dusky Bay, we anchored about 9 that
evening in 40 fathoms soft bottom, in the arm leading into Facile
Harbour. Five Finger Point by compass bore <span class=
"aa">s.</span> 38 <span class="aa">w.</span>; the west point of
Parrot Island <span class="aa">n.</span> 35 <span class=
"aa">e.</span> and the nearest shore <span class=
"aa">w.n.w</span>. half a mile distant. About 11 the Chatham
anchored, and, though within us, was in 60 fathoms water.</p>
<p>Although in the year 1773, I had visited Dusky Bay with
Captain Cook in the Resolution, I had never been in Facile
Harbour; for this reason I deemed it expedient, previous to
moving the vessels, to examine and determine on a situation there
most convenient for our several employments. On this occasion I
was accompanied by Mr. Broughton and Mr. Whidbey. Having made our
choice, we were greatly alarmed on our return by the report of
two guns; but as the wind had much increased since our departure
from the ships, we were not long at a loss how to account for
this signal, and concluded that one, or both, of the vessels had
driven from their anchorage.</p>
<p>We were no sooner clear of the islands, than our conjectures
were in part confirmed. The Chatham was stationary, but the
Discovery was moving; and by the time we reached her, about one
o'clock, she was nearly a-breast of Five Finger Point. We found
that, on the ship's driving, a second anchor had been resorted
to; but the depth of water being upwards of 70 fathoms, she was
not brought up; that anchor was again at the bows, and the other
nearly up; so that we were shortly enabled to set the sails; and,
having a strong gale at <span class="aa">n.n.w</span>. though
attended with heavy squalls, I was not without hopes of reaching
our destination in Facile Harbour before dusk. But about five, a
very violent guff of wind carried away the strap of the
fore-topsail meet block; the staysail sheets and haulyards gave
way; and the fore-topmast staysail split: the gale seemed to be
increasing, and as we were in too narrow a channel to repair
these damages before we should have lost all the distance we had
gained, it was exceedingly fortunate that we had Anchor Island
Harbour to leeward of us, for which we immediately steered; and
running in by the western entrance, anchored at the mouth of the
cove in 26 fathoms, soft muddy bottom; and after veering to half
a cable, our stern was in 13 fathoms water, about forty yards
from the island that lies at the bottom of the cove. The ship was
Readied by hawsers, from the bows to the points of the cove, and
from the quarters to the trees on each side. The gale increased
during the night; and it became necessary to strike the lower
yards, and top-gallant masts. Our apprehensions for the safety of
the Chatham were not relieved until, by rowing over to the Petrel
Islands the next forenoon, and by walking across the land, we had
the happiness to see her ride in perfect safety; but as she was
directly to windward, and the gale continued to increase, Mr.
Broughton was unable to get on board. Satisfied with the security
of her station, we returned to the Discovery, when the violence
of the gale from the <span class="aa">n.w</span>. obliged us to
strike the topmasts, it not being in our power to vere more
cable, or allow the ship to drive, without her being on the rocks
astern; of which even with these precautions we entertained some
fears; although in a situation perfectly land locked, and the
weather shores not more than five cables length distant. The
violence of the gale still continuing, the small bower anchor was
dropped under foot. In the evening the wind moderated a little,
which seemed to be for the sole purpose of acquiring and
returning with new vigor, as, by two on saturday morning, the
gale increased to so violent a storm, as to oblige us to lower
the top-masts close down to the cap, and to get our yards and
top-gallant masts fore and aft on the deck. From five o'clock
until eight, it blew a perfect hurricane, attended with torrents
of rain. We were happily in a very snug, secure little harbour,
yet the sea beat with such unremitted violence against the rocks
immediately astern of us, that had either the anchor, or cable
given way, little else but inevitable destruction must have
followed. Our anxiety was infinitely increased, by our solicitude
for the welfare of the Chatham; but as the storm with us at
<span class="aa">n.w</span>. by <span class="aa">w.</span> was
directly from off the highland under which she rode, we comforted
ourselves with the hope she might not experience its fury to the
degree it affected us. About nine a most tremendous guff caused
the ship to roll excessively; this was immediately followed by a
flash of lightning, and a heavy crash of thunder which broke up
the storm; and in the space of half an hour, the weather might be
considered, comparatively speaking, as fair and pleasant. Mr.
Broughton immediately repaired to the Chatham, and had the
inexpressible pleasure of finding, that she had rode out the gale
in a manner far beyond all expectation. At her station the storm
had blown from the <span class="aa">n.n.e.</span> directly down
the arm in which she was at anchor; the sea broke intirely over
her, though it had not a fetch of three miles, and in a channel
not three quarters of a mile wide; yet with her yards and
topmasts close lowered and two anchors down, she rode out this
heavy storm in perfect security. Mr. Broughton lost no time in
getting under weigh, and worked into Facile Harbour; to which
place, notwithstanding our having been obliged to seek shelter
here, it was my intention to have gone; but as we were now
completely dismantled, and finding that from these shores all our
wants could conveniently be supplied, I determined to remain
quiet, and to set about the several repairs we required with all
possible dispatch. Parties were immediately employed on the
different fer vices of cutting wood for fuel, timber for spars,
and planks; brewing spruce beer; repairing the sails and rigging,
casks, &amp;c. &amp;c. which necessary and essential duties
engaged every person on board. A small boat with four men, daily
employed in fishing, never returned without an abundance of
excellent fish for present use, and a supply for every one who
chose to salt them for future occasions. The <span class=
"aa">n.w</span>. gale did not intirely abandon us, it again blew
with considerable violence on sunday, after which it moderated,
and the weather became settled, serene and pleasant, particularly
when the wind, which was generally the case, had its direction
from the south or western quarters; by which means our several
duties were executed pleasantly, and with great ease.</p>
<p>By the 13th, these necessary operations were in such a date of
forwardness, as to allow a large party of officers and gentlemen
in two boats, accompanied by Mr. Broughton in the Chatham's
cutter, to attend me on an excursion over this spacious bay, with
the hope of becoming acquainted with some of the inhabitants;
and, if circumstances permitted, to explore the upper part of the
northern arm, which by Captain Cook was called, "<span class=
"aa">No body knows what</span>," and the only part he did not
thoroughly examine.</p>
<p>We found the arm in which Captain Cook places Apparent Island,
to be divided into two branches, leaving that land a peninsula
joined to the main land, by a very high, though narrow ridge of
mountains. The perpendicular height, and very extraordinary
shape, of the rocky part fronting the arm, render it a most
singular and majestic promontory. Mr. Broughton undertook the
right hand, or southern branch, which he found winding, first in
a direction nearly <span class="aa">n.e</span>. by <span class=
"aa">e.</span> about 3½ miles; then <span class=
"aa">e.s.e</span>. about half a league; and there, in a northern
direction, terminating in a small cove. The northern arm we found
to run nearly straight about <span class="aa">n.e</span>. for 5
miles, then turning round to the northward, for half a league
further, and ending in a small cove with very shallow water, in a
north western direction. The heads of these arms, in conformity
with Captain Cook's name of their entrance, I have called
<span class="aa">Some body knows what</span>. We were exceedingly
fortunate in having most delightful weather for these
examinations, and returned on board on tuesday afternoon; though
not without some disappointment that, after three days excursion,
and landing in many places, particularly in Cascade and Indian
Coves, which were formerly the resort of the natives, we no where
found any traces of them, or any circumstance that in the least
indicated the country being at present inhabited; if one or two
referable huts be excepted which the officers of the Chatham met
with in the neighbourhood of Facile Harbour, but which had not
the appearance of having been lately occupied. Pleasant weather
still continuing, on the 16th I took a survey of Anchor Island
Harbour. It appeared to be perfectly secure, and may be found
convenient, when accident may prevent vessels getting into Facile
Harbour. It has two entrances; that to the north of the Petrel
islands is a fair and clear channel, though of great depth; its
general soundings being from 33 to 38 fathoms; in the narrowest
part it is about a cable's length wide, and, I believe, free from
any danger; as the shores are steep, without any sunken rocks or
shoals, excepting within the passage close under the south side
of large Petrel Island, where they are discoverable by the weeds
growing upon them, and are quite out of the way of its
navigation. The other passage is to the southward of the Petrel
islands; and as, in all probability, a strong northerly wind
would alone induce any person to make choice of this in
preference to Facile Harbour, the <span class="aa">s.w</span>.
point of large Petrel Island should be kept close on board,
(which may be safely done) in order to weather the rock that
appears above water in the middle of the harbour, and to avoid a
sunken one of which there is not the least indication, and on
which there is no greater depth than twelve feet at low water.
Between this sunken rock, and the point from off which it lies
about three quarters of a cable's length, and nearly in the
direction to what I have called <span class="aa">Entry
Island</span>, are sixteen fathoms. Keeping the rock in the
harbour, which is always visible, in a line with what I have
called <span class="aa">North Entry Island</span>, will be
sufficient direction, to pass within the above-mentioned point
and the sunken rock. This, however, with some other particulars,
is better illustrated by the annexed sketch; which, with one of
Facile Harbour taken by Mr. Broughton, I have subjoined to a copy
of captain Cook's most excellent chart of this port, with such
trifling additions as in the course of our observations we have
been able to make; and on this head, I shall only further remark,
that Anchor Island harbour, although a very safe and secure port,
is not a very convenient one to get to sea from, owing to its
narrow limits, great depth of water, and the above sunken rock
which we discovered in its western entrance.</p>
<p>Most of our business with the shore being finished, our
rigging overhauled, sails bent, and the ship ready for sea, with
very fine weather and a gentle breeze from <span class=
"aa">s.s.e</span>., on the morning of the 18th we sailed out of
the cove. The Chatham was not yet in readiness to depart; in
order, however, that we might be conveniently Rationed to proceed
together when circumstances should admit, I intended to place the
ship abreast of Facile Harbour; but the breeze sailing, and the
tide setting us towards the islands that lie from it, we were
obliged to anchor sooner than I wished in 38 fathoms soft bottom.
Five Finger Point by compass bore <span class="aa">s.</span> 40
<span class="aa">w.</span>; west point of Anchor Island
<span class="aa">s.</span> 12 <span class="aa">w.</span> and the
south point of Parrot Island <span class="aa">n.</span> 53
<span class="aa">w.</span> a quarter of a mile distant. The day
was nearly calm, but the next morning brought with it a fresh
breeze from the southward. The Chatham having completed her
business, stood out into the roadstead, which obtained the name
of <span class="aa">Tempest Road</span>, from the storm she there
rode out on our arrival: but not seeing any probability of
getting to sea, she returned into Facile Harbour. The gale
increased towards noon, but in the evening the weather again
became delightfully pleasant.</p>
<p>On sunday morning about 7 o'clock, a fresh breeze from the
<span class="aa">s.w</span>. set in, accompanied by an unusually
heavy swell, which giving us reason to apprehend some violence
from the wind in that direction, we weighed, ran into Facile
Harbour, and anchored abreast of the passage leading out through
Parrot and Pigeon islands, in 38 fathoms soft bottom. This
passage, though not exceeding a cable's length in width, we found
to be a very excellent one, with soundings from 9 to 5 fathoms
close to the shores. These soundings are on a ridge from island
to island, as the water deepened to upwards of 30 fathoms
immediately on either side. The Chatham was at anchor near us,
and both vessels were conveniently stationed for proceeding to
sea on a favorable opportunity presenting itself. The wind
continued to blow very strong from the <span class=
"aa">s.w</span>. and brought with it a surf which broke very
heavily on the shores in the bay; yet the vessels rode perfectly
quiet. On monday, the sky became intirely obscured, the former
serenity gave place to dark gloomy weather, and the wind became
variable with much rain. The next morning was perfectly calm, and
although it did not rain, the heavy atmosphere continued. We were
now employed in completing our flock of water, and in procuring
wood, spruce, or rather a species or cypress, and the tea plant,
for brewing at sea. Towards noon, a breeze springing up from the
<span class="aa">n.w</span>. both vessels sailed out of Dusky
Bay. A very heavy swell rolled from the <span class=
"aa">s.w</span>. and westward; but having a fresh breeze, by 4
o'clock Five Finger Point bore <span class="aa">n.</span> by
<span class="aa">e.</span> a league distant.</p>
<p>Thus we quitted Dusky Bay, greatly indebted to its most
excellent refreshments, and the salubrity of its air. The good
effects of a plentiful supply of fish, and spruce beer, were
evident in the appearance of every individual in our little
society. The health of our convalescents was perfectly
re-established, and excepting one with a chronic complaint, and
two wounded by cuts in their legs, we had not a man on the
surgeon's list; though, on the most trifling occasion of
indisposition, no person was ever permitted to attend his duty.
Some wild fowl were procured, though they were by no means found
in such numbers as when the Resolution was here in the year 1773,
owing, in all probability, to the difference of the season; to
which, possibly, is to be ascribed, our being unable to ascertain
whether the geese then left here had propagated.</p>
<p>Captain Cook's very excellent description of this place
precludes any material additions; and leaves me, as a transitory
visitor, little else than the power of confirming his judicious
remarks and opinions. One circumstance, however, may not be
unworthy notice. Mr. Menzies here found the true winter's bark;
exactly the same plant as that found at Terra del Fuego; but
which escaped the observation of Captain Cook and our botanical
gentlemen in 1773; of this, with the antarctic birch, flax, and
one or two other plants, we took specimens on board, though the
period of our reaching England seemed too distant to entertain
hopes of their continuing alive. Captain Cook's recommendation of
Facile Harbour to vessels bound to the southward, is highly
judicious, as it is in all respects a safe, commodious, and
convenient station; capable of supplying every article that can
be ex peeled from this country, without going out of sight of the
vessel: and it is rendered still more eligible, by our having
found so good an outlet with northerly or <span class=
"aa">n.w</span>. winds, between Pigeon and Parrot islands; as, in
consequence of the high land drawing those winds directly down
the harbour, the western entrance will be found less convenient.
No time should be lost on arriving in this bay, to seek security
in some of its harbours; which, as Captain Cook very truly
observes, "are numerous, safe, and convenient." For although the
weather we experienced after the storm on our arrival, may justly
be considered as delightful summer weather, yet it cannot be
denied that the northerly winds blow with incredible fury; and as
they always take the direction of the arms of the bay, they cause
in them, though they are very narrow, a considerable sea, which,
in addition to their great depth of water, render such anchoring
places neither pleasant nor secure. I should not, however,
suppose these storms to be very frequent, for two reasons. First,
during our stay here, from the 26th of march until the 11th of
may in the year 1773, which maybe considered as comprehending
part of the winter season, we had no gale of wind comparable in
point of violence to that, which we had lately experienced. This
was my fifth visit to New Zealand and its neighbourhood; and
although I have certainly seen much boisterous and tempestuous
weather, I never before contended with so violent a storm.
Secondly, the mountains in Anchor Island, Resolution Island, and
all those of moderate height round the Bay, (the land of
Five-Finger Point alone excepted,) which on our arrival were
perfectly free from snow, were after the storm covered with it a
considerable way down. Were such falls of snow to happen
frequently, it is natural to conclude that vegetation would be
severely checked, and that its productions would not have been
found to flourish, as they certainly do in a most luxuriant
manner. A few days fine weather soon removed the greater part of
the snow; and that which remained on the high, distant, barren
mountains, which for some days past had been entirely free from
clouds, was observed to be greatly diminished.</p>
<p>I shall conclude our transactions in Dusky Bay, by noticing
the few astronomical and nautical observations that were made in
Anchor Island harbour.</p>
<p>The badness of the weather on our first arrival, and the short
time I proposed to remain, made me conclude that the erection of
the observatory on shore would be to little purpose. The latitude
of the harbour was found to be one minute south of Captain Cook's
calculation, or 45° 45' 36" His determination is, however, most
likely to be correct, as mine was deduced from one day's
observation only, with an artificial horizon; and, having agreed
so nearly, any further investigation I deemed unnecessary.</p>
<p>The mean result of ten sets of altitudes taken between the 9th
and 16th of November, for ascertaining the longitude of the
chronometer, and to form some judgment as to its rate of going,

<p>Esteeming the true longitude of Anchor Island harbour to be
166° 15' 54", the chronometer was fast of mean time at Greenwich
on the 16th at noon 26' 34"; whence it appeared, that it had gone
nearly at mean time since leaving King George the Third's Sound,
and that its having differed from Captain Cook's assigned
longitude of Van Dieman's land was occasioned by its not having
gained at the rate we allowed, and of course the longitude of
King George the Third's Sound was not wrong. By the result of our
observations here, it gained on an average about 3" per day,
which error I shall allow, until a better opportunity of
ascertaining its rate may offer.</p>

<p>As we increased our distance from the land, the <span class=
"aa">n.w</span>. wind increased also. A swell at this time coming
very heavily from the <span class="aa">s.w</span>. made me
apprehensive the wind would shift round, and blow hard in that
direction. The state of the mercury in the barometer, the
gloominess of the weather, and every other appearance of the
evening, indicated more wind from the <span class=
"aa">s.w</span>. than would be pleasant to be caught in on this
dreary coast: we therefore steered south, under as much sail as
we could carry, and made the necessary signals to the Chatham for
the like purpose. Our lofty canvass was, however, spread a very
short time before it blew so hard a gale, that we were under the
necessity of close reefing the topsails, getting down the
top-gallant yards, and striking the masts. The night was
extremely dark; which, by ten, prevented our seeing the Chatham.
The wind was now at <span class="aa">n.n.w</span>. very happily
not on the shore, as by three in the morning its increased
violence obliged us to furl the topsails. At this moment we were
alarmed by finding six feet water in the hold, which the ship
felt excessively, labouring much by being pressed down forward
with that weight of water. This very unpleasant circumstance
obliged us to feud directly before the wind and sea, for the
purpose of freeing the ship; when, by receiving much water in the
waste, the casks of beer and water flowed upon deck, broke from
their securities and were stove to pieces. The cause of so much
water in the hold, at first a matter of great surprize, was soon
accounted for. The hand pumps had been, and were still, choaked;
which induced the carpenter to believe, that because they
discharged no water there was none in the ship. This, in all
probability, had governed his examination all the latter part of
the time we had been in port, and produced an accumulation that
might have been attended with the most serious consequences, had
not one of the quarter-masters heard in the tier, the water
ruining about in the hold. The hand pumps were soon in order;
and, to relieve the ship as soon as possible, the cross piece of
the bits was unshipped, the launch got forward, and with the
chain pumps the vessel by seven o'clock was made perfectly dry.
The gale had now increased to a most furious storm, nearly equal
to that we had experienced in Dusky Bay. The torrents of rain
which fell, mixing with the sea raised by the violent flurries of
the wind, kept us so much in darkness that we could not perceive
any thing at the distance of an hundred yards in any direction;
nor were we able to resume our southwardly course; the wind and
sea obliging us to steer <span class="aa">s.s.e</span>. or right
before the storm. We had not seen the Chatham since eleven
o'clock the preceding evening, but concluding she would stand on
if able to pursue a southerly course, I did not wish to bring to
for her; particularly, as the wind was such as would soon set us
clear of the coast of New Zealand, which was doubtless a very
desirable object.</p>
<p>Towards nine in the forenoon the storm began to abate; at ten
the wind veered round to the <span class="aa">w.s.w</span>.; the
rain ceased, and the atmosphere became clear, but the Chatham was
not to be discovered in any direction. There was, however, great
probability of her being to windward; and as I was still
apprehensive of a <span class="aa">s.w</span>. gale before we
should be clear of this coast, I determined to lose no time in
getting far enough to the southward to enable us to sail round
the land and the Traps with such a wind. As Matavai Bay in
Otaheite was the next appointed rendezvous, I concluded Mr.
Broughton would do the same, and make the best of his way with
the Chatham to that port. The mainsail and close-reefed topsails
(all the sail the ship would bear) were now set, and keeping the
wind on the beam, we steered <span class="aa">s.s.e</span>.; when
about eleven o'clock, to our great astonishment land was
discovered, bearing east 4 or 5 leagues distant. We knew of no
land nearer than the south cape of New Zealand; and, by the
courses we had steered there was scarcely a possibility of our
being within less than 18 or 20 leagues of the Cape; but being
flattered with the prospect of a meridional observation for the
latitude, our decision was postponed until that should be
ascertained. Noon brought us nearer the land, which by compass
bore <span class="aa">n.e</span>. by <span class="aa">e.</span>
to <span class="aa">e.n.e</span>. at the distance of three or
four leagues only. By a tolerably good observation in latitude
48° 5' it was clearly proved, that this land could not, from its
situation, be any part of New Zealand, as it was nearly three
fourths of a degree to the southward of the most southern
promontory of that country. Our longitude by the chronometer, was
at this time 166° 4'; which situation was 18' more south, and 13'
more east, than the log gave. The weather, though very hazy,
being something clearer than before noon, we beheld, as we passed
this land at the distance of two or three leagues, the sea
breaking upon its shores with great violence, and discovered it
to be composed of a cluster of seven craggy islands, extending
about six miles in a direction <span class="aa">n</span>. 70
<span class="aa">e.</span> and <span class="aa">s.</span> 70
<span class="aa">w.</span> They appeared destitute of verdure,
and it is more than probable they never produce any. The largest,
which is the north-easternmost, I should suppose to be in extent
equal to all the rest; it is about three leagues in circuit,
sufficiently elevated to be seen in clear weather eight or nine
leagues off, and is situated in latitude 48° 3', longitude 166°
20'. The latitude was ascertained by three sextants which nearly
agreed; and the longitude reduced by the chronometer from Dusky
Bay, by three sets of altitudes in the afternoon; viz. one set
before we passed its meridian; another under it; the third after
we had passed it. As these severally corresponded within a mere
trifle, when reduced to the same point, I should presume that the
longitude above stated is not likely to be materially incorrect.
It was matter of some surprize how these islands could have
escaped the attention of Captain Cook; but on laying them down in
his chart of New Zealand, I found his tracks had not at any time
reached within at least ten leagues of them. From the south cape
they bear <span class="aa">s.</span> 40 <span class=
"aa">w.</span> 19 leagues, and from the southernmost part of the
Traps <span class="aa">s.</span> 62½ <span class="aa">w.</span>
20 leagues distant. These islands, or rather rocks, for they
appeared perfectly steril, I have named, on account of their
situation, and the sort of weather there is great reason to
expect in their vicinity, <span class="aa">The Snares</span>; as
being very likely to draw the unguarded mariner into alarming
difficulties. At four o'clock in the afternoon, the Snares bore
by compass <span class="aa">n.</span> 30 <span class=
"aa">w.</span> five or six leagues distant. At day-light the next
morning, we hauled to the <span class="aa">n.e</span>. By noon,
the gale had sufficiently moderated to admit the spreading of all
our canvass; at noon the observed latitude was 48° 18', longitude
169° 33'. I cannot avoid here mentioning the concern I felt in
beholding the last of our sheep thrown overboard; the race of
animals of the brute creation on board the Discovery, had
certainly been very ill fated; out of thirty sheep taken on board
at Portsmouth, no more than two came to the table, the rest died
before we reached the equator; nor were we much more fortunate in
the like number of wethers received at the Cape; two thirds of
these, with seven ewes and six rams, intended as presents to our
friends in the South-Sea islands, were at this time dead;
notwithstanding they were all taken on board in exceedingly high
condition, and had neither wanted care, plenty of wholesome food,
nor good lodging.</p>
<p>With a pleasant, favorable gale; sometimes in the <span class=
"aa">n.w</span>. but chiefly from the <span class=
"aa">s.w</span>. quarter, and with tolerably fine weather, we
stood to the <span class="aa">e.n.e</span>.; and made such
progress, that by noon on the 8th of december we had reached the
latitude of 37° 27'; longitude 207°14'. The wind veered round to
the north with a moderate breeze, attended by dark gloomy weather
and some rain. On saturday we were surrounded by a very thick
fog, which, with much rain at intervals, continued until the
13th; when having a fine breeze at <span class="aa">s.s.w</span>.
the fog cleared away, but it still remained very cloudy. We were
however enabled to ascertain our situation for the first time
since the 8th, to be in latitude 36° 13', longitude 214° 33',
varying since that day 53' more to the north, and 28° 28' more to
the east, than was shewn by the log. We stood to the north, under
all the sail we could spread, but were not suffered long to
pursue this course. In the latitude of 31° 43', longitude 214°
11', at noon on the 15th the wind veered round, and settled
between the <span class="aa">n.e</span>. and <span class=
"aa">n.n.e</span>., obliging us to ply with a moderate breeze to
the northward; in doing which so little was gained, that on
saturday we had only reached the latitude of 31° 8', longitude
214° 34'. The wind now blew a fresh gale from the north, the
topsails were reefed, the weather was very dark, gloomy, and
excessively sultry, with continued lightning and thunder at some
distance, until the morning; when the wind died away, and in its
stead, extremely vivid forked lightning, with incessant peals of
thunder, accompanied by torrents of rain, attended us, without
intermission, until sunday noon. The thunder and lightning then
ceased, but the rain still continued; and, contrary to our
expectation, the wind resumed its <span class="aa">n.n.e</span>.
direction, and blew so hard as to make the sinking our topgallant
yards necessary. A remarkably smooth sea, with heavy, damp,
close, cloudy weather, and little alteration in the wind,
attended us until the 20th; it then moderated, and the
top-gallant sails were spread.</p>
<p>Since the 17th we had not obtained any correct observations;
but, by our reckoning, the latitude at noon was 30° 17',
longitude 215° 22'. Although the wind from the north and
<span class="aa">n.n.e</span>. was attended with hidden and
violent flurries, yet the sea continued smooth, which indicated,
that land, probably of some extent, existed not very far distant
in that direction. After noon, we stood to the eastward about
four leagues; when, suddenly, a very heavy swell was met from
<span class="aa">n.n.e</span>. which was soon followed by such an
increase of wind from that quarter, as reduced us to our
close-reefed topsails. This gale, which proved the breaking up of
the northerly wind, was of short duration: in the evening it
moderated, and veered round by the east to the <span class=
"aa">s.s.w</span>. We made all sail to the north by west; but it
was not until the wind became a very fresh breeze, that we were
enabled to steer that course against the northerly swell, which
drove the ship astern. This evening there were several small
white tern hovering about the ship, seemingly with great
inclination to alight on board. On wednesday morning, the head
sea had for the most part subsided, and the wind seemed to have
settled in the southern quarter; and blowing a gentle breeze with
very pleasant weather, enabled me to obtain six sets of lunar
distances, whose mean result reduced to noon gave the longitude
215° 22' 45". The chronometer, by the last rate shewed 215° 16'
45", the latitude was 29° 15'; which was, at this time, 6'
further north than we expected.</p>
<p>We continued our route to the northward; which, with a gentle
gale at <span class="aa">s.s.e</span>. and pleasant weather,
brought us, by day-light on the 22d, in sight of land, bearing by
compass <span class="aa">n.e.</span> ½ <span class="aa">n.</span>
At first it appeared like three small high islands, the
easternmost much resembling a vessel under sail. This land being
at a considerable distance from the tracks of former navigators,
I steered for it, in order to be satisfied of its extent,
productions, and other circumstances worthy observation. In the
forenoon, eight sets of lunar distances were obtained; which, as
before, nearly corresponding with each other, gave, by their mean
result, when reduced to noon, 215° 42' 40", these, with those
taken the preceding day, comprehending 14 sets of distances, gave
by their mean result 215° 39'. The latitude, by several sextants,
was determined to be 27° 54'.</p>
<p>Since seeing the land in the morning, we had run eleven
leagues; and had approached it sufficiently near to perceive,
that all we had at first seen was united. It now bore, by
compass, from <span class="aa">n.</span> 29 <span class=
"aa">e.</span> to <span class="aa">n.</span> 43 <span class=
"aa">e.</span> about 5 leagues distant, with a small island lying
off its eastern side <span class="aa">n.</span> 45 <span class=
"aa">e.</span></p>
<p>Assisted by a gentle <span class="aa">s.e</span>. gale, with
fine pleasant weather, at three in the afternoon we were within
about a league of the shore; yet no bottom was to be gained at
the depth of 180 fathoms. Several canoes came off to the ship,
and all means were used to invite them on board. They declined
our entreaties, but seemed very solicitous that we should accept
their invitations to land: which they signified by waving their
paddles towards the coast, and by desiring us, in the language of
the Great South-Sea nation, to go nearer to the shore. We bore
away with that intent, but soon again brought to, on observing
that two or three canoes were paddling in great haste towards the
ship. After some persuasion, four men in one of the canoes came
near enough to receive some presents, which seemed to please them
exceedingly; and though their countrymen appeared to rebuke them
for their rashness, the example was shortly followed by several
others. It was not, however, without shewing every assurance of
friendship, that any could be prevailed upon to come on board,
until at length, the man who had brought about this intercourse
seemed determined to establish it, by complying with our desires.
On his entering the ship, he trembled and was much agitated;
apprehension, astonishment, and admiration, equally appearing at
the same instant; and though, on his being made welcome after the
usual fashion, and presented with a small iron adz, his
countenance became more serene and cheerful, yet he still
appeared in a state of great anxiety. He soon communicated his
reception and treatment to his surrounding countrymen; and we
shortly had as many visitors as it was pleasant to entertain.
They all seemed perfectly well acquainted with the uses to which
they could apply iron, and how to estimate its value amongst
themselves; as also the manner in which it was regarded by
Europeans. They made no scruple, even with some force, to take
articles of iron out of our hands; and, in lieu of them, with
great courtesy and address presented, in return, some few fish,
fishing-hooks, lines, and other trifles, which they seemed to
wish should be accepted as presents, and not received in
exchange. Looking-glasses, beads, and other trinkets of little
importance, at first attracted their attention, and were gladly
accepted; but no sooner did they discover that articles made of
iron were common amongst us, than they refused all other
presents, and wanted to barter every other gift for iron. I could
not prevail on any of them to accept a few medals.</p>
<p>Their visit seemed prompted only by curiosity, as they were
completely unarmed, and brought with them neither articles of
food, nor manufacture. A few spears, and a club or two, were seen
in one or two of the canoes only; two or three indifferent slings
for stones were also noticed; with which they parted without the
least reluctance.</p>
<p>We lay to until five o'clock in the hope of obtaining the name
of this island, or of any other which might exist in its
neighbourhood, since these people were evidently of the Great
South-Sea nation; speaking, with some little difference of
dialect, the same language; and resembling the Friendly
islanders, more than the inhabitants of any other country. On
this occasion, <i>Towereroo</i> the Sandwich islander was of
little assistance; having been taken at an early period from
home, and having been long absent, he had so much forgotten his
mother tongue, as to be scarcely able to understand the language
of these people better than ourselves. Two or three of them
remained on board nearly an hour; but so unfixed and unsteady was
their attention, which wandered from object to object, that it
was impossible to gain from them any information. Their answers
to almost every question were in the affirmative; and our
enquiries as to the name of their island, &amp;c. were
continually interrupted by incessant invitations to go on shore.
At length, I had reason to believe the name of the island was,
Oparo; and that of their chief, <i>Korie</i>. Although I could
not positively determine that these names were correctly
ascertained, yet as there was a probability of their being so, I
distinguished the island by the name of <span class=
"aa">Oparo</span>, until it might be found more properly entitled
to another. By six in the evening, we had nearly seen round the
island, which is of little extent; and not choosing to lose the
advantage of a fine southwardly wind, we proceeded to the
<span class="aa">n.n.w</span>. under all the sail we could
spread.</p>
<p>As it was not my intention to stop at Oparo, no delay was
occasioned by examining for anchorage, which probably may be
found on both sides of its <span class="aa">n.w</span>. point. To
the southward of that point is a small bay with a stony beach,
through which there was the appearance of a considerable stream
of water falling into the sea. The shores in most parts were so
perfectly smooth, that landing might have been effected without
the least difficulty. Round to the north of that point is another
small bay, in which are a small islet and some rocks; behind
these, the shore may be approached with great ease at any time.
Indeed, there was not any part of the island which appeared to
have been acted upon by heavy violent surfs, as the verdure in
many places reached to the water's edge. The south extremity of
the island appeared in some points of view to form a right angle,
without the least interruption in the sides; about half a mile to
the <span class="aa">s.e.</span> is a small detached islet; the
shores are interspersed with sandy beaches; its greatest extent,
which is in a <span class="aa">n.</span> 18 <span class=
"aa">w.</span> and <span class="aa">s</span>. 18 <span class=
"aa">e.</span> direction, is about six miles and a half, and it
may possibly be about eighteen miles in circuit. This island is
situated in the latitude of 27 36'; and, by our lunar
observations of the two preceding days reduced to its center by
the chronometer, is in longitude * 215° 58' 28"; the mean of the
variation was 5° 40' eastwardly.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Vide Astronomical observations at
Otaheite.]</p>
<p>Its principal character is a cluster of high craggy mountains,
forming, in several places, most romantic pinnacles, with
perpendicular cliffs nearly from their summits to the sea; the
vacancies between the mountains would more probably be termed
chasms than vallies, in which there was no great appearance of
plenty, fertility, or cultivation; they were chiefly clothed with
shrubs and dwarf trees. Neither the plantain, nor other
spontaneous vegetable productions common to the inhabited
tropical islands, presented themselves. The tops of six of the
highest hills bore the appearance of fortified places, resembling
redoubts; having a sort of block house, in the shape of an
English glass house, in the center of each, with rows of
pallisadoes a considerable way down the sides of the hills,
nearly at equal distances. These, overhanging, seemed intended
for advanced works, and apparently capable of defending the
citadel by a few against a numerous host of assailants. On all of
them, we noticed people, as if on duty, constantly moving about.
What we considered as block houses, from their great similarity
in appearance to that sort of building, were sufficiently large
to lodge a considerable number of persons, and were the only
habitations we saw. Yet from the number of canoes that in so
short a time assembled around us, it is natural to conclude that
the inhabitants are very frequently afloat, and to infer from
this circumstance that the shores, and not those fortified hills
which appeared to be in the center of the island, would be
preferred for their general residence. We saw about thirty double
and single canoes, though most of them were of the double sort:
the single canoes were supported by an outrigger on one side, and
all built much after the fashion of the Society Islands, without
having their very high sterns, though the sterns of some of these
were considerably elevated; and their bows were not without some
little ornament. They were very neatly constructed, though the
narrower canoes I ever saw. When it is considered that the
builders of them are nearly destitute of iron, and possessed of
very few implements of that valuable metal; and when the
miserable tools they have generally recourse to for such
operations are regarded, the mind is filled with admiration at
their ingenuity, and persevering industry. The island did not
appear to afford any large timber; the broadest planks of which
the canoes were made, not exceeding twelve inches, confirmed us
in this opinion, as they were probably cut out of the largest
trees. Some of the stoutest double canoes accommodated from
twenty-five to thirty men, of whom, on a moderate computation,
three hundred were supposed to have been seen near the ship.
These were all adults, and apparently none exceeding a middle
age; so that the total number of inhabitants on the island can
hardly be estimated at less than fifteen hundred. In this respect
it must be considered prolific, notwithstanding its uncultivated
appearance. The natives, however, appeared to be exceedingly well
fed, of middling stature, extremely well made; and in general,
their countenances were open, cheerful, and strongly marked with
indications of hospitality. They were all, to a man, very
solicitous that some of us should accompany them to the shore;
and those who last quitted the ship, endeavoured with all their
powers of persuasion, and some efforts of compulsion, to effect
their purpose. On their departure they took hold of the hand of
every one near them, with a view to get him into their canoe.
They all had their hair cut short; and, excepting a wreath made
of a broad long-leaved green plant, worn by some about the waist,
they were intirely without clothing. Although the custom of
tatowing prevails so generally with all the islanders of this
ocean, these people were destitute of any such marks.</p>
<p>Independent of the protection their fortified retreats may
afford, it did not appear that they were subject to much
hostility, as scarcely any fears from wounds or other marks of
violence were observed on their bodies. Their elevated fortified
places (for certainly they had every appearance of being such)
led some of us to conjecture, that they were frequently annoyed
by troublesome neighbours from some other islands not far
distant. But, as the canoes we saw were not even furnished with
sails, nor had any appearance of having been ever equipped for an
expedition beyond their own coast, it may reasonably be inferred,
that they were not accustomed to voyages of any length. Yet, on
the other hand, when the small extent of their island is taken
into consideration, it is hard to reconcile that it is not the
fear of foreign enemies, but the apprehension of domestic
insurrection, that has induced the laborious construction of
their fortified retreats; and as to the <span class=
"aa">s.e</span>. of this island there is an extensive space in
the ocean hitherto but little frequented; it is not improbable
that some islands may exist there, the inhabitants of which may
occasionally make unfriendly visits to these people.</p>
<p>Leaving Oparo, we had pleasant weather with a gentle breeze
from the <span class="aa">s.e</span>. At eight in the morning,
the island was still visible from the deck, bearing by compass
<span class="aa">s.s.e</span>. ½ <span class="aa">e.</span> at
the distance of 18 leagues. The breeze between <span class=
"aa">e.</span> and <span class="aa">s.e</span>. carried us
rapidly to the <span class="aa">n.n.w</span>. and brought us on
sunday evening into the vicinity of some low islands discovered
by Captain Carteret, and named the Duke of Gloucester's Islands.
The evening was dark and gloomy, and not choosing to pass the
spot assigned to them in the night, we continued to make short
trips under our top-sails, until day light; after which we again
resumed our course. Our latitude at noon was 19° 58', longitude
211° 46', which was 9' further south, and 23' further west, than
was shewn by the log. At about 1° 33' to the west of the
situation of the Duke of Gloucester's Islands according to
Captain Carteret, we passed their latitude, without seeing any
appearance of land. Having now a fresh gale at east, we
entertained the pleasing hope of reaching Otaheite the next day;
this flattering prospect was of short duration. Towards the
evening, the wind veered to the <span class="aa">n.e.</span> and
its violence obliged us to close reef the topsails. The gale was
attended with very heavy squalls, and a torrent of rain continued
almost without intermission until wednesday evening, when it
ceased, and the wind still at <span class="aa">n.e</span>. became
moderate. By standing onto the <span class="aa">n.n.w</span>.,
day light the next morning presented us with a view of Matavai,
or Osnaburgh Island, at the distance of seven or eight leagues,
bearing by compass <span class="aa">n.e</span>. by <span class=
"aa">e.</span> Our course was immediately shaped for Otaheite,
the south point of which was visible by eleven o'clock, bearing
by compass <span class="aa">s</span>. 70 <span class=
"aa">w.</span> 8 or 9 leagues distant. The wind coming to the
north prevented our reaching Matavai Bay, and obliged us to ply
to windward during the night. In the morning, with a gentle
breeze from the <span class="aa">n.e</span>. we stood for Matavai
under all the sail we could spread. About eight o'clock, a canoe
came alongside with two pigs and some vegetables; a present from
a sister of Otoo, residing in that part of the island of which we
were then abreast. The natives informed me that we had been
expected, and that they had been looking out for us two days, in
consequence of information they laid they had received from an
English vessel, then at anchor in Matavai Bay; and their
description of her being perfectly intelligible, I did not
hesitate to believe it was the Chatham, of which we shortly
experienced the happiness of being convinced. Mr. Broughton soon
visited us, and brought with him an early and acceptable supply,
of the excellent productions of this fertile country. About ten,
we anchored in Matavai Bay. Our mutual gratulations on meeting
were extremely heightened, by receiving and communicating the
happy tidings, that every individual composing the society of
each vessel was in a most perfect state of health. Mr. Broughton
had, since his arrival, received repeated marks of friendship and
attention from the good people of the island. Having deemed it
expedient to establish the following regulations on board the
Discovery, I delivered a copy of them to Mr. Broughton, and
directed that the rules might be strictly observed and attended
to on board the Chatham; after which, Mr. Broughton presented me
with a narrative of his proceedings during the time of our
separation.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Rules</span> and <span class=
"aa">Orders</span> for the guidance and conduct of all persons
in, or belonging to, his Majesty's sloop Discovery and Chatham
tender; enjoined to be most strictly observed in all intercourse
with the natives of the several South Sea islands.</p>
<p>The principal, and indeed sole design, of the Discovery and
Chatham calling at the islands in the pacific ocean, being to
acquire such refreshments as those islands may be found to
afford; and as these refreshments are to be purchased with
articles which Europeans esteem of little value;&mdash;if each
individual be permitted to make such bargains as he may think
proper, not only the value of these articles will soon be reduced
in the estimation of the Indians, but, until a proper and good
understanding be established between the natives of the different
islands, and ourselves, it may subject us to such disturbances as
may be attended with the most fatal consequences. And as a due
proportion of time will be allowed before the vessels depart from
any island, (circumstances admitting thereof) for the providing
such articles of curiosity, &amp;c. as any person may be inclined
and able to purchase:</p>
<p>It is, First, strictly enjoined, that no officer, seaman, or
other person, in such commerce with the Indians, do give such
articles of value, for any article of curiosity, as may tend
hereafter to depreciate the value of iron, beads, &amp;c.
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Secondly, That every fair means be used to cultivate a
friendship with the different Indians, and on all occasions to
treat them with every degree of kindness and humanity.</p>
<p>Thirdly, As proper persons will be appointed by the respective
commanders to trade with the natives, tor the necessary
provisions and refreshments; it is strictly enjoined that no
officer, seaman, or other person, excepting him or them so
appointed, do on any pretence, presume to trade, or offer to
trade, for any article whatever, until permission shall have been
granted for so doing.</p>
<p>Fourthly, Every person employed on shore, on any duty
whatever, is strictly to attend to the same: and if it should
appear that by neglect, any of the arms, working tools, boats
furniture, or other matters committed to the charge of one or
more persons, be lost, or suffered to be stolen, the full value
of the same will be charged against his, or their wages, and he
or they will likewise suffer such other punishment, as the nature
of the offence may deserve; and as the additional pay, and the
emoluments of the artificers, serving in his Majesty's navy, is
for their encouragement, and the diligent performance of their
duty in their respective trades or occupations, and for providing
themselves with the requisite working tools, all such implements
or tools belonging to the several artificers of the two vessels,
are by their respective owners to be carefully preserved, that
they may be always able to perform the duties of their respective
departments; and should any one be hardy enough to sail in his
obedience to this order, he shall be disrated from his employment
during the continuance of the voyage, and suffer such other
punishment as the crime may deserve.</p>
<p>Lastly, The same penalty will be inflicted on every person,
who shall be found to embezzle, or be concerned in embezzling, or
offering to trade with, any part of the ships or boats stores,
furniture, &amp;c. &amp;c. be these of what nature soever.</p>
