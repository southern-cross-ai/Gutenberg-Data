     id="ref1"></a>PROLOGUE</h3>

  <p>The three of us in that winter camp in the Selkirks were talking the slow
  aimless talk of wearied men.</p>

  <p>The Soldier, who had seen many campaigns, was riding his hobby of the
  Civil War and descanting on Lee's tactics in the last Wilderness struggle. I
  said something about the stark romance of it&mdash;of Jeb Stuart flitting
  like a wraith through the forests; of Sheridan's attack at Chattanooga, when
  the charging troops on the ridge were silhouetted against a harvest moon; of
  Leonidas Polk, last of the warrior Bishops, baptising his fellow generals by
  the light of a mess candle. "Romance," I said, "attended the sombre grey and
  blue levies as faithfully as she ever rode with knight-errant or
  crusader."</p>

  <p>The Scholar, who was cutting a raw-hide thong, raised his wise eyes.</p>

  <p>"Does it never occur to you fellows that we are all pretty mixed in our
  notions? We look for romance in the well-cultivated garden-plots, and when it
  springs out of virgin soil we are surprised, though any fool might know it
  was the natural place for it."</p>

  <p>He picked up a burning stick to relight his pipe.</p>

  <p>"The things we call aristocracies and reigning houses are the last places
  to look for masterful men. They began strongly, but they have been too long
  in possession. They have been cosseted and comforted and the devil has gone
  out of their blood. Don't imagine that I undervalue descent. It is not for
  nothing that a great man leaves posterity. But who is more likely to inherit
  the fire&mdash;the elder son with his flesh-pots or the younger son with his
  fortune to find? Just think of it! All the younger sons of younger sons back
  through the generations! We none of us know our ancestors beyond a little
  way. We all of us may have kings' blood in our veins. The dago who blacked my
  boots at Vancouver may be descended by curious byways from Julius Caesar.</p>

  <p>"Think of it!" he cried. "The spark once transmitted may smoulder for
  generations under ashes, but the appointed time will come, and it will flare
  up to warm the world. God never allows waste. And we fools rub our eyes and
  wonder, when we see genius come out of the gutter. It didn't begin there. We
  tell ourselves that Shakespeare was the son of a wool pedlar, and Napoleon of
  a farmer, and Luther of a peasant, and we hold up our hands at the marvel.
  But who knows what kings and prophets they had in their ancestry!"</p>

  <p>After that we turned in, and as I lay looking at the frosty stars a fancy
  wove itself in my brain. I saw the younger sons carry the royal blood far
  down among the people, down even into the kennels of the outcast. Generations
  follow, oblivious of the high beginnings, but there is that in the stock
  which is fated to endure. The sons and daughters blunder and sin and perish,
  but the race goes on, for there is a fierce stuff of life in it. It sinks and
  rises again and blossoms at haphazard into virtue or vice, since the ordinary
  moral laws do not concern its mission. Some rags of greatness always cling to
  it, the dumb faith that sometime and somehow that blood drawn from kings it
  never knew will be royal again. Though nature is wasteful of material things,
  there is no waste of spirit And then after long years there comes, unheralded
  and unlooked-for, the day of the Appointed Time... </p>

  <p>This is the story which grew out of that talk by the winter fire.</p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref2"
     id="ref2"></a>CHAPTER 1</h3>

  <h2>HIGHTOWN UNDER SUNFELL</h2>

  <p>When Biorn was a very little boy in his father's stead at Hightown he had
  a play of his own making for the long winter nights. At the back end of the
  hall, where the men sat at ale, was a chamber which the thralls used of a
  morning&mdash;a place which smelt of hams and meal and good provender. There
  a bed had been made for him when he forsook his cot in the women's quarters.
  When the door was shut it was black dark, save for a thin crack of light from
  the wood fire and torches of the hall. The crack made on the earthen floor a
  line like a golden river. Biorn, cuddled up on a bench in his little
  bear-skin, was drawn like a moth to that stream of light. With his heart
  beating fast he would creep to it and stand for a moment with his small body
  bathed in the radiance. The game was not to come back at once, but to foray
  into the farther darkness before returning to the sanctuary of bed. That took
  all the fortitude in Biorn's heart, and not till the thing was dared and done
  could he go happily to sleep.</p>

  <p>One night Leif the Outborn watched him at his game. Sometimes the man was
  permitted to sleep there when he had been making sport for the housecarls.
  <a href="#endnote1">[1]</a></p>

  <p>"Behold an image of life!" he had said in his queer outland speech. "We
  pass from darkness to darkness with but an instant of light between. You are
  born for high deeds, princeling. Many would venture from the dark to the
  light, but it takes a stout breast to voyage into the farther dark."</p>

  <p>And Biorn's small heart swelled, for he detected praise, though he did not
  know what Leif meant.</p>

  <p>In the long winter the sun never topped Sunfell, and when the gales blew
  and the snow drifted there were lights in the hall the day long. In Biorn's
  first recollection the winters were spent by his mother's side, while she and
  her maids spun the wool of the last clipping. She was a fair woman out of the
  Western Isles, all brown and golden as it seemed to him, and her voice was
  softer than the hard ringing speech of the Wick folk. She told him island
  stories about gentle fairies and good-humoured elves who lived in a green
  windy country by summer seas, and her air would be wistful as if she thought
  of her lost home. And she sang him to sleep with crooning songs which had the
  sweetness of the west wind in them. But her maids were a rougher stock, and
  they stuck to the Wicking <a href="#endnote2">[2]</a> lullaby which ran
  something like this:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Hush thee, my bold one, a boat will I buy thee,<br>
  A boat and stout oars and a bright sword beside,<br>
  A helm of red gold and a thrall to be nigh thee,<br>
  When fair blows the wind at the next wicking-tide."</p>

  <p>There was a second verse, but it was rude stuff, and the Queen had
  forbidden the maids to sing it.</p>

  <p>As he grew older he was allowed to sit with the men in the hall, when bows
  were being stretched and bowstrings knotted and spear-hafts fitted. He would
  sit mum in a corner, listening with both ears to the talk of the old
  franklins <a href="#endnote3">[3]</a> , with their endless grumbles about
  lost cattle and ill neighbours. Better he liked the bragging of the young
  warriors, the Bearsarks <a href="#endnote4">[4]</a> , who were the spear-head
  in all the forays. At the great feasts of Yule-tide he was soon sent packing,
  for there were wild scenes when the ale flowed freely, though his father,
  King Ironbeard, ruled his hall with a strong hand. From the speech of his
  elders Biorn made his picture of the world beyond the firths. It was a world
  of gloom and terror, yet shot with a strange brightness. The High Gods might
  be met with in beggar's guise at any ferry, jovial fellows and good friends
  to brave men, for they themselves had to fight for their lives, and the End
  of All Things hung over them like a cloud. Yet till the day of Ragnarok there
  would be feasting and fine fighting and goodly fellowship, and a stout heart
  must live for the hour.</p>

  <p>Leif the Outborn was his chief friend. The man was no warrior, being lame
  of a leg and lean and sharp as a heron. No one knew his begetting, for he had
  been found as a child on the high fells. Some said he was come of the Finns,
  and his ill-wishers would have it that his birthplace had been behind a foss,
  and that he had the blood of dwarves in him. Yet though he made sport for the
  company, he had respect from them, for he was wise in many things, a skilled
  leech, a maker of runes, and a crafty builder of ships. He was a master hand
  at riddles, and for hours the housecarls would puzzle their wits over his
  efforts. This was the manner of them. "Who," Leif would ask, "are the merry
  maids that glide above the land to the joy of their father; in winter they
  bear a white shield, but black in summer?" The answer was "Snowflakes and
  rain." Or "I saw a corpse sitting on a corpse, a blind one riding on a
  lifeless steed?" to which the reply was "A dead horse on an ice-floe." Biorn
  never guessed any of the riddles, but the cleverness of them he thought
  miraculous, and the others roared with glee at their own obtuseness.</p>

  <p>But Leif had different moods, for sometimes he would tell tales, and all
  were hushed in a pleasant awe. The fire on the hearth was suffered to die
  down, and men drew closer to each other, as Leif told of the tragic love of
  Helgi and Sigrun, or how Weyland outwitted King Nidad, or how Thor went as
  bride to Thrym in Giantland, and the old sad tale of how Sigurd Fafnirsbane,
  noblest of men, went down to death for the love of a queen not less noble.
  Leif told them well, so that his hearers were held fast with the spell of
  wonder and then spurred to memories of their own. Tongues would be loosened,
  and there would be wild recollections of battles among the skerries of the
  west, of huntings in the hills where strange sights greeted the benighted
  huntsman, and of voyaging far south into the lands of the sun where the
  poorest thrall wore linen and the cities were all gold and jewels. Biorn's
  head would be in such a whirl after a night of story-telling that he could
  get no sleep for picturing his own deeds when he was man enough to bear a
  sword and launch his ship. And sometimes in his excitement he would slip
  outside into the darkness, and hear far up in the frosty sky the whistle of
  the swans as they flew southward, and fancy them the shield-maids of Odin on
  their way to some lost battle.</p>

  <p>His father, Thorwald Thorwaldson, was king over all the firths and wicks
  between Coldness in the south and Flatness and the mountain Rauma in the
  north, and inland over the Uplanders as far as the highest springs of the
  rivers. He was king by more than blood, for he was the tallest and strongest
  man in all the land, and the cunningest in battle. He was for ordinary
  somewhat grave and silent, a dark man with hair and beard the colour of
  molten iron, whence came his by-name. Yet in a fight no Bearsark could vie
  with him for fury, and his sword Tyrfing was famed in a thousand songs. On
  high days the tale of his descent would be sung in the hall&mdash;not by
  Leif, who was low-born and of no account, but by one or other of the chiefs
  of the Shield-ring. Biorn was happy on such occasions, for he himself came
  into the songs, since it was right to honour the gentle lady, the Queen. He
  heard how on the distaff side he was sprung from proud western earls,
  Thorwolf the Black, and Halfdan and Hallward Skullsplitter. But on the spear
  side he was of still loftier kin, for Odin was first in his pedigree, and
  after him the Volsung chiefs, and Gothfred the Proud, and&mdash;that no
  magnificence might be wanting&mdash;one Karlamagnus, whom Biorn had never
  heard of before, but who seemed from his doings to have been a puissant
  king.</p>

  <p>On such occasions there would follow a bragging match among the warriors,
  for a recital of the past was meant as an augury for the future. The time was
  towards the close of the Wicking-tide, and the world was becoming hard for
  simple folk. There were endless bickerings with the Tronds in the north and
  the men of More in the south, and a certain Shockhead, an upsetting king in
  Norland, was making trouble with his neighbours. Likewise there was one
  Kristni, a king of the Romans, who sought to dispute with Odin himself. This
  Kristni was a magic-worker, who clad his followers in white linen instead of
  byrnies <a href="#endnote5">[5]</a> , and gave them runes in place of swords,
  and sprinkled them with witch water. Biorn did not like what he heard of the
  warlock, and longed for the day when his father Ironbeard would make an end
  of him.</p>

  <p>Each year before the coming of spring there was a lean season in Hightown.
  Fish were scarce in the ice-holes, the stock of meal in the meal-ark grew
  low, and the deep snow made poor hunting in wood or on fell-side. Belts were
  tightened, and there were hollow cheeks among the thralls. And then one
  morning the wind would blow from the south, and a strange smell come into the
  air. The dogs left their lair by the fire and, led by the Garm the old blind
  patriarch, made a tour of inspection among the outhouses to the edge of the
  birch woods. Presently would come a rending of the ice on the firth, and
  patches of inky water would show between the floes. The snow would slip from
  the fell-side, and leave dripping rock and clammy bent, and the river would
  break its frosty silence and pour a mighty grey-green flood to the sea. The
  swans and geese began to fly northward, and the pipits woke among the
  birches. And at last one day the world put on a new dress, all steel-blue and
  misty green, and a thousand voices woke of flashing streams and nesting birds
  and tossing pines, and the dwellers in Hightown knew that spring had fairly
  come.</p>

  <p>Then was Biorn the happy child. All through the long day, and through much
  of that twilight which is the darkness of a Norland summer, he was abroad on
  his own errands. With Grim the Hunter he adventured far up on the fells and
  ate cheese and bannocks in the tents of the wandering Skridfinns, or stalked
  the cailzie-cock <a href="#endnote6">[6]</a> with his arrows in the great
  pine forest, which in his own mind he called Mirkwood and feared exceedingly.
  Or he would go fishing with Egil the Fisherman, spearing salmon in the tails
  of the river pools. But best he loved to go up the firth in the boat which
  Leif had made him&mdash;a finished, clinker-built little model of a war
  galley, christened the Joy-maker&mdash;and catch the big sea fish. Monsters
  he caught sometimes in the deep water under the cliffs, till he thought he
  was destined to repeat the exploit of Thor when he went fishing with the
  giant Hymi, and hooked the Midgard Serpent, the brother of Fenris-wolf, whose
  coils encircle the earth.</p>

  <p>Nor was his education neglected. Arnwulf the Bearsark taught him axe-play
  and sword-play, and he had a small buckler of his own, not of linden-wood
  like those of the Wick folk, but of wickerwork after the fashion of his
  mother's people. He learned to wrestle toughly with the lads of his own age,
  and to throw a light spear truly at a mark. He was fleet of foot and scoured
  the fells like a goat, and he could breast the tide in the pool of the great
  foss up to the very edge of the white water where the trolls lived.</p>

  <p>There was a wise woman dwelt on the bay of Sigg. Katla was her name, a
  woman still black-browed though she was very old, and clever at mending
  hunters' scars. To her house Biorn went with Leif; and when they had made a
  meal of her barley-cakes and sour milk, and passed the news of the coast,
  Leif would fall to probing her craft and get but surly answers. To the boy's
  question she was kinder. "Let the dead things be, prince," she said. "There's
  small profit from foreknowledge. Better to take fates as they come sudden
  round a turn of the road than be watching them with an anxious heart all the
  way down the hill. The time will come soon enough when you must stand by the
  Howe of the Dead and call on the ghost-folk."</p>

  <p>But Leif coaxed and Biorn harped on the thing, as boys do, and one night
  about the midsummer time her hour came upon Katla and she spoke without their
  seeking. There in the dim hut with the apple-green twilight dimming the fells
  Biorn stood trembling on the brink of the half-world, the woman huddled on
  the floor, her hand shading her eyes as if she were looking to a far horizon.
  Her body shook with gusts of passion, and the voice that came from her was
  not her own. Never so long as he lived did Biorn forget the terrible hour
  when that voice from beyond the world spoke things he could not understand.
  "I have been snowed on with snow," it said, "I have been beaten with the
  rain, I have been drenched with the dew, long have I been dead." It spoke of
  kings whose names he had never heard, and of the darkness gathering about the
  Norland, and famine and awe stalking upon the earth.</p>

  <p>Then came a whisper from Leif asking the fortune of the young prince of
  Hightown.</p>

  <p>"Death," said the weird-wife, "death&mdash;but not yet. The shears of the
  Norns are still blunt for him, and Skuld has him in keeping."</p>

  <p>There was silence for a space, for the fit was passing from Katla. But the
  voice came again in broken syllables. "His thread runs westward...  beyond
  the Far Isles...  not he but the seed of his loins shall win great kingdoms
 ...  beyond the sea-walls...  The All-Father dreams...  Nay, he wakes...  he
  wakes... "</p>

  <p>There was a horrible choking sound, and the next Biorn knew was that Leif
  had fetched water and was dashing it on Katla's face.</p>

  <p>It was nearly a week before Biorn recovered his spirits after this
  adventure, and it was noticeable that neither Leif nor he spoke a word to
  each other on the matter. But the boy thought much, and from that night he
  had a new purpose. It seemed that he was fated to travel far, and his fancy
  forsook the homely life of his own wicks and fells and reached to that
  outworld of which he had heard in the winter's talk by the hall fire.</p>

  <p>There were plenty of folk in Hightown to satisfy his curiosity. There were
  the Bearsarks, who would spin tales of the rich Frankish lands and the green
  isles of the Gael. From the Skridfinns he heard of the bitter country in the
  north where the Jotuns dwelt, and the sun was not and the frost split the
  rocks to dust, while far underground before great fires the dwarves were
  hammering gold. But these were only old wives' tales, and he liked better the
  talk of the sea-going franklins, who would sail in the summer time on trading
  ventures and pushed farther than any galleys of war. The old sailor, Othere
  Cranesfoot, was but now back from a voyage which had taken him to Snowland,
  or, as we say, Iceland. He could tell of the Curdled Sea, like milk set apart
  for cheese-making, which flowed as fast as a river, and brought down ghoulish
  beasts and great dragons in its tide. He told, too, of the Sea-walls which
  were the end of the world, waves higher than any mountain, which ringed the
  whole ocean. He had seen them, blue and terrible one dawn, before he had
  swung his helm round and fled southwards. And in Snowland and the ports of
  the Isles this Othere had heard talk from others of a fine land beyond the
  sunset, where corn grew unsown like grass, and the capes looked like crusted
  cow-pats they were so thick with deer, and the dew of the night was
  honey-dew, so that of a morning a man might breakfast delicately off the face
  of the meadows.</p>

  <p>Full of such marvels, Biorn sought Leif and poured out his heart to him.
  For the first time he spoke of the weird-wife's spaeing. <a href=
  "#endnote7">[7]</a> If his fortune lay in the west, there was the goal to
  seek. He would find the happy country and reign over it. But Leif shook his
  head, for he had heard the story before. "To get there you will have to ride
  over Bilrost, the Rainbow Bridge, like the Gods. I know of the place. It is
  called Gundbiorn's Reef and it is beyond the world."</p>

  <p>All this befell in Biorn's eleventh summer. The winter which followed
  brought ill luck to Hightown and notably to Ironbeard the King. For in the
  autumn the Queen, that gentle lady, fell sick, and, though leeches were
  sought for far and near, and spells and runes were prepared by all who had
  skill of them, her life ebbed fast and ere Yule she was laid in the Howe of
  the Dead. The loss of her made Thorwald grimmer and more silent than before,
  and there was no feasting at the Yule high-tide and but little at the spring
  merry-making. As for Biorn he sorrowed bitterly for a week, and then,
  boy-like, forgot his grief in the wonder of living.</p>

  <p>But that winter brought death in another form. Storms never ceased, and in
  the New Year the land lay in the stricture of a black frost which froze the
  beasts in the byres and made Biorn shiver all the night through, though in
  ordinary winter weather he was hardy enough to dive in the ice-holes. The
  stock of meal fell low, and when spring tarried famine drew very near. Such a
  spring no man living remembered. The snow lay deep on the shore till far into
  May. And when the winds broke they were cold sunless gales which nipped the
  young life in the earth. The ploughing was backward, and the seed-time was a
  month too late. The new-born lambs died on the fells and there fell a wasting
  sickness among the cattle. Few salmon ran up the streams, and the sea-fish
  seemed to have gone on a journey. Even in summer, the pleasant time, food was
  scarce, for the grass in the pastures was poor and the cows gave little milk,
  and the children died. It foreboded a black harvest-time and a blacker
  winter.</p>

  <p>With these misfortunes a fever rose in the blood of the men of Hightown.
  Such things had happened before for the Norland was never more than one stage
  distant from famine; and in the old days there had been but a single remedy.
  Food and wealth must be won from a foray overseas. It was years since
  Ironbeard had ridden Egir's road to the rich lowlands, and the Bearsarks were
  growing soft from idleness. Ironbeard himself was willing, for his hall was
  hateful to him since the Queen's death. Moreover, there was no other way.
  Food must be found for the winter or the folk would perish.</p>

  <p>So a hosting was decreed at harvest-tide, for few men would be needed to
  win the blasted crops; and there began a jointing of shields and a burnishing
  of weapons, and the getting ready of the big ships. Also there was a great
  sortilege-making <a href="#endnote8">[8]</a> . Whither to steer, that was the
  question. There were the rich coasts of England, but they were well guarded,
  and many of the Norland race were along the wardens. The isles of the Gael
  were in like case, and, though they were the easier prey, there was less to
  be had from them. There were soon two parties in the hall, one urging
  Ironbeard to follow the old track of his kin westward, another looking south
  to the Frankish shore. The King himself, after the sacrifice of a black
  heifer, cast the sacred twigs, and they seemed to point to Frankland. Old
  Arnwulf was deputed on a certain day to hallow three ravens and take their
  guidance, but, though he said three times the Ravens' spell, he got no clear
  counsel from the wise birds. Last of all, the weird-wife Katla came from
  Sigg, and for the space of three days sat in the hall with her head shrouded,
  taking no meat or drink. When at last she spoke she prophesied ill. She saw a
  red cloud and it descended on the heads of the warriors, yea of the King
  himself. As for Hightown she saw it frozen deep in snow like Jotunheim, and
  rime lay on it like a place long dead. But she bade Ironbeard go to
  Frankland, for it was so written. "A great kingdom waits," she
  said&mdash;"not for you, but for the seed of your loins." And Biorn
  shuddered, for they were the words spoken in her hut on that unforgotten
  midsummer night.</p>

  <p>The boy was in an agony lest he should be left behind. But his father
  decreed that he should go. "These are times when manhood must come fast," he
  said. "He can bide within the Shield-ring when blows are going. He will be
  safe enough if it holds. If it breaks, he will sup like the rest of us with
  Odin."</p>

  <p>Then came days of bustle and preparation. Biorn was agog with excitement
  and yet solemnised, for there was strange work afoot in Hightown. The King
  made a great festival in the Gods' House, the dark hall near the Howe of the
  Dead, where no one ventured except in high noon. Cattle were slain in honour
  of Thor, the God who watched over forays, and likewise a great boar for Frey.
  The blood was caught up in the sacred bowls, from which the people were
  sprinkled, and smeared on the altar of blackened fir. Then came the
  oath-taking, when Ironbeard and his Bearsarks swore brotherhood in battle
  upon the ship's bulwarks, and the shield's rim, and the horse's shoulder, and
  the brand's edge. There followed the mixing of blood in the same footprint, a
  rite to which Biorn was admitted, and a lesser oath for all the people on the
  great gold ring which lay on the altar. But most solemn of all was the vow
  the King made to his folk, warriors and franklins alike, when he swore by the
  dew, the eagle's path, and the valour of Thor.</p>

  <p>Then it was Biorn's turn. He was presented to the High Gods as the prince
  and heir.</p>

  <p>Old Arnwulf hammered on his left arm a torque of rough gold, which he must
  wear always, in life and in death.</p>

  <p>"I bring ye the boy, Biorn Thorwaldson When the Gods call for Thorwald it
  will be his part to lead the launchings and the seafarings and be first when
  blows are going. Do ye accept him, people of Hightown?"</p>

  <p>There was a swelling cry of assent and a beating of hafts on shields.
  Biorn's heart was lifted with pride, but out of a corner of his eye he saw
  his father's face. It was very grave, and his gaze was on vacancy.</p>

  <p>Though it was a time of bustle, there was no joy in it, as there had been
  at other hostings. The folk were too hungry, the need was too desperate, and
  there was something else, a shadow of fate, which lay over Hightown. In the
  dark of night men had seen the bale-fires burning on the Howe of the Dead. A
  grey seal had been heard speaking with tongues off Siggness, and speaking ill
  words, said the fishermen who saw the beast. A white reindeer had appeared on
  Sunfell, and the hunter who followed it had not been seen again. By day, too,
  there was a brooding of hawks on the tide's edge, which was strange at that
  season. Worst portent of all, the floods of August were followed by high
  north-east winds that swept the clouds before them, so that all day the sky
  was a scurrying sea of vapour, and at night the moon showed wild grey shapes
  moving ever to the west. The dullest could not mistake their meaning; these
  were the dark horses, and their riders, the Helmed Maidens, mustering for the
  battle to which Hightown was faring.</p>

  <p>As Biorn stared one night at the thronged heavens, he found Leif by his
  elbow. In front of the dark company of the sky a white cloud was scudding,
  tinged with the pale moon. Leif quoted from the speech of the Giant-wife
  Rimegerd to Helgi in the song:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Three nines of maiden, ride,<br>
  But one rides before them,<br>
  A white maid helmed:<br>
  From their manes the steeds shake<br>
  Dew into the deep dales,<br>
  Hail upon the high woods."</p>

  <p>"It bodes well," said Biorn. "They ride to choose those whom we slay.
  There will be high doings ere Yule."</p>

  <p>"Not so well," said Leif. "They come from the Norland, and it is our folk
  they go to choose. I fear me Hightown will soon be full of widow women."</p>

  <p>At last came the day of sailing. The six galleys of war were brought down
  from their sheds, and on the rollers for the launching he-goats were bound so
  that the keels slid blood-stained into the sea. This was the
  'roller-reddening,' a custom bequeathed from their forefathers, though the
  old men of the place muttered darkly that the ritual had been departed from,
  and that in the great days it was the blood not of goats, but of captive
  foemen that had reddened the galleys and the tide.</p>

  <p>The thralls sat at the thwarts, for there was no breeze that day in the
  narrow firth. Then came the chief warriors in short fur jackets, splendid in
  glittering helms and byrnies, and each with his thrall bearing his
  battle-axe. Followed the fighting commonalty with axe and spear. Last came
  Ironbeard, stern as ever, and Biorn with his heart torn between eagerness and
  regret. Only the children, the women, and the old men were left in Hightown,
  and they stood on the shingle watching till the last galley had passed out of
  sight beyond Siggness, and was swallowed up in the brume that cloaked the
  west. There were no tears in that grim leave-taking. Hightown had faced the
  like before with a heavy heart, but with dry eyes and a proud head. Leif,
  though a cripple, went with the Wickings, for he had great skill of the
  sea.</p>

  <p>There was not a breath of wind for three days and three nights, as they
  coasted southward, with the peaks of the Norland on their port, and to
  starboard the skerries that kept guard on the firths. Through the haze they
  could now and then see to landward trees and cliffs, but never a human face.
  Once there was an alarm of another fleet, and the shields were slung
  outboard, but it proved to be only a wedding-party passing from wick to wick,
  and they gave it greeting and sailed on. These were eerie cheerless days. The
  thralls sweated in shifts at the oars, and the better-born talked low among
  themselves, as if the air were full of ears. "Ran is heating her ovens," said
  Leif, as he watched the warm fog mingle with the oarthresh.</p>

  <p>On the fourth morning there came a break in the clouds, and the sight of a
  high hill gave Leif the clue for his reckoning. The prows swung seaward, and
  the galleys steered for the broad ocean. That afternoon there sprang up the
  north-east wind for which they had been waiting. Sails were hoisted on the
  short masts, oars were shipped and lashed under the bulwarks, and the thralls
  clustered in the prows to rest their weary limbs and dice with knucklebones.
  The spirits of all lightened, and there was loud talk in the sterns among the
  Bearsarks. In the night the wind freshened, and the long shallow boats rolled
  filthily so that the teeth shook in a man's head, and over the swish of the
  waves and the creaking of the sheets there was a perpetual din of arms
  clashing. Biorn was miserably ill for some hours, and made sport for the
  seasoned voyagers.</p>

  <p>"It will not hold," Leif prophesied. "I smell rime ahead and quiet
  seas."</p>

  <p>He had spoken truly, for the sixth day the wind fell and they moved once
  more over still, misty waters. The thralls returned to their oars and the
  voices of the well-born fell low again These were ghoulish days for Biorn,
  who had been accustomed to the clear lights and the clear darkness of his own
  land. Only once in four days they saw the sun, and then it was as red as
  blood, so that his heart trembled.</p>

  <p>On the eleventh day Ironbeard summoned Leif and asked his skill of the
  voyage. "I know not," was the answer. "I cannot steer a course except under
  clean skies. We ran well with the wind aback, but now I am blind and the Gods
  are pilots. Some day soon we must make landfall, but I know not whether on
  English or Frankish shores."</p>

  <p>After that Leif would sit in long spells of brooding, for he had a sense
  in him of direction to which he sought to give free play&mdash;a sense built
  up from old voyages over these very seas. The result of his meditations was
  that he swung more to the south, and events proved him wise. For on the
  fifteenth day came a lift in the fog and with it the noise of tides washing
  near at hand on a rough coast. Suddenly almost overhead they were aware of a
  great white headland, on the summit of which the sun shone on grass.</p>

  <p>Leif gave a shout. "My skill has riot failed me," he cried. "We enter the
  Frankish firth. See, there is the butt of England!"</p>

  <p>After that the helms were swung round, and a course laid south by west.
  And then the mist came again, but this time it was less of a shroud, for
  birds hovered about their wake, so that they were always conscious of land.
  Because of the strength of the tides the rowers made slow progress, and it
  was not till the late afternoon of the seventeenth day that Leif approached
  Ironbeard with a proud head and spoke a word. The King nodded, and Leif took
  his stand in the prow with the lead in his hand. The sea mirroring the mist
  was leaden dull, but the old pilot smelt shoal water.</p>

  <p>Warily he sounded, till suddenly out of the gloom a spit of land rose on
  the port, and it was clear that they were entering the mouth of a river. The
  six galleys jolted across the sandbar, Leif in the foremost peering ahead and
  shouting every now and then an order. It was fine weather for a surprise
  landing. Biorn saw only low sand-dunes green with coarse grasses and,
  somewhere behind, the darkness of a forest. But he could not tear his eyes
  from it, for it was the long-dreamed-of Roman land.</p>

  <p>Then a strange thing befell. A madness seemed to come on Leif. He left his
  pilot's stand and rushed to the stern where the King stood. Flinging himself
  on his knees, he clasped Ironbeard's legs and poured out supplications.</p>

  <p>"Return!" he cried. "While there is yet time, return. Seek England,
  Gael-land, anywhere, but not this place. I see blood in the stream and blood
  on the strand. Our blood, your blood, my King! There is doom for the folk of
  Thorwald by this river!"</p>

  <p>The King's face did not change. "What will be, will be," he said gravely.
  "We abide by our purpose and will take what Thor sends with a stout heart.
  How say you, my brave ones?"</p>

  <p>And all shouted to go forward, for the sight of a new country had fired
  their blood. Leif sat huddled by the bulwarks, with a white face and a gasp
  in his throat, like one coming out of a swoon.</p>

  <p>They went ashore at a bend of the stream where was a sandy cape, beached
  the galleys, felled trees from the neighbouring forest and built them a
  stockade. The dying sun flushed water and wood with angry crimson, and Biorn
  observed that the men wrought as it were in a world of blood. "That is the
  meaning of Leif's whimsies," he thought, and so comforted himself.</p>

  <p>That night the Northmen slept in peace, but the scouts brought back word
  of a desert country, no men or cattle, and ashes where once had been
  dwellings.</p>

  <p>"Our kinsfolk have been here before us," said King Ironbeard grimly. He
  did not love the Danes, though he had fought by their side.</p>

  <p>Half the force was left as a guard by the ships, and next day the rest
  went forward up the valley at a slant from the river's course. For that way,
  ran the tale, lay a great Roman house, a palace of King Kristni, where much
  gold was to be had for the lifting. By midday they were among pleasant
  meadows, but the raiders had been there, for the houses were fired and the
  orchards hacked down. Then came a shout and, turning back, they saw a flame
  spring to the pale autumn skies. "The ships!" rose the cry, and the lightest
  of foot were sent back for news.</p>

  <p>They returned with a sorry tale. Of the ships and the stockade nothing
  remained but hot cinders. Half the guard were dead, and old Arnwulf, the
  captain, lay blood-eagled on the edge of the tide. The others had gone they
  knew not where, but doubtless into the forests.</p>

  <p>"Our kinsfolks' handiwork," said Ironbeard. "We are indeed forestalled, my
  heroes."</p>

  <p>A council was held and it was resolved to make a camp by the stream and
  defend it against all comers, till such time as under Leif's guidance new
  ships could be built.</p>

  <p>"Axes will never ring on them," said Leif under his breath. He walked now
  like a man who was fey and his face was that of another world.</p>

  <p>He spoke truth, for as they moved towards the riverbank, just before the
  darkening, in a glade between two forests Fate met them. There was barely
  time to form the Shield-ring ere their enemies were upon them&mdash;a mass of
  wild men in wolves' skins and at their head mounted warriors in byrnies, with
  long swords that flashed and fell.</p>

  <p>Biorn saw little of the battle, wedged in the heart of the Shield-ring. He
  heard the shouts of the enemy, and the clangour of blows, and the sharp
  intake of breath, but chiefly he heard the beating of his own heart. The ring
  swayed and moved as it gave before the onset or pressed to an attack of its
  own, and Biorn found himself stumbling over the dead. "I am Biorn, and my
  father is King," he repeated to himself, the spell he had so often used when
  on the fells or the firths he had met fear.</p>

  <p>Night came and a young moon, and still the fight continued. But the
  Shield-ring was growing ragged, for the men of Hightown were fighting one to
  eight, and these are odds that cannot last. Sometimes it would waver, and an
  enemy would slip inside, and before he sank dead would have sorely wounded
  one of Ironbeard's company.</p>

  <p>And now Biorn could see his father, larger than human, it seemed, in the
  dim light, swinging his sword Tyrfing, and crooning to himself as he laid low
  his antagonists. At the sight a madness rose in the boy's heart. Behind in
  the sky clouds were banking, dark clouds like horses, with one ahead white
  and moon-tipped, the very riders he had watched with Leif from the firth
  shore. The Valkyrie were come for the chosen, and he would fain be one of
  them. All fear had gone from him. His passion was to be by his father's side
  and strike his small blow, beside those mighty ones which Thor could not have
  bettered.</p>

  <p>But even as he was thus uplifted the end came. Thorwald Thorwaldson
  tottered and went down, for a hurled axe had cleft him between helm and
  byrnie. With him fell the last hope of Hightown and the famished clan under
  Sunfell. The Shield-ring was no more. Biorn found himself swept back as the
  press of numbers overbore the little knot of sorely wounded men. Someone
  caught him by the arm and snatched him from the mellay <a href=
  "#endnote9">[9]</a> into the cover of a thicket. He saw dimly that it was
  Leif.</p>

  <p>He was giddy and retching from weariness, and something inside him was
  cold as ice, though his head burned. It was not rage or grief, but awe, for
  his father had fallen and the end of the world had come. The noise of the
  battle died, as the two pushed through the undergrowth and came into the open
  spaces of the wood. It was growing very dark, but still Leif dragged him
  onwards. Then suddenly he fell forward on his face, and Biorn, as he stumbled
  over him. found his hands wet with blood.</p>

  <p>"I am for death," Leif whispered. "Put your ear close, prince. I am Leif
  the Outborn and I know the hidden things...  You are the heir of Thorwald
  Thorwaldson and you will not die...  I see a long road, but at the end a
  great kingdom. Farewell, little Biorn. We have been good comrades, you and I.
  Katla from Sigg spoke the true word... "</p>

  <p>And when Biorn fetched water in his horn from a woodland pool he found
  Leif with a cold brow.</p>

  <p>Blind with sorrow and fatigue, the boy stumbled on, without purpose. He
  was lonely in the wide world, many miles from his home, and all his kin were
  slain. Rain blew from the south-west and beat in his face, the brambles tore
  his legs, but he was dead to all things. Would that the Shield Maids had
  chosen him to go with that brave company to the bright hall of Odin! But he
  was only a boy and they did not choose striplings.</p>

  <p>Suddenly in a clearing a pin-point of light pricked the darkness.</p>

  <p>The desire for human companionship came over him, even though it were that
  of enemy or outcast. He staggered to the door and beat on it feebly. A voice
  spoke from within, but he did not hear what it said.</p>

  <p>Again he beat and again the voice came. And now his knocking grew feebler,
  for he was at the end of his strength.</p>

  <p>Then the bar was suddenly withdrawn and he was looking inside a poor hut,
  smoky from the wood-fire in the midst of it. An old woman sat by it with a
  bowl in her hand, and an oldish man with a cudgel stood before him. He did
  not understand their speech, but he gathered he was being asked his
  errand.</p>

  <p>"I am Biorn," he said, "and my father was Ironbeard, the King."</p>

  <p>They shook their heads, but since they saw only a weary, tattered boy they
  lost their fears. They invited him indoors, and their voices were kindly.
  Nodding with exhaustion, he was given a stool to sit on and a bowl of coarse
  porridge was put into his hands. They plied him with questions, but he could
  make nothing of their tongue.</p>

  <p>Then the thrall rose, yawned, and dropped the bar over the door. The sound
  was to the boy like the clanging of iron gates on his old happy world. For a
  moment he was on the brink of tears. But he set his teeth and stiffened his
  drooping neck.</p>

  <p>"I am Biorn," he said aloud, "and my father was a king."</p>

  <p>They nodded to each other and smiled. They though his words were a grace
  before meat.</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref3"
     id="ref3"></a>CHAPTER 2</h3>

  <h2>THE ENGLISHMAN</h2>

  <h3>PART 1</h3>

  <p>The little hut among the oak trees was dim in the October twilight on the
  evening of St. Callixtus' Day. It had been used by swineherds, for the
  earthen floor was puddled by the feet of generations of hogs, and in the
  corner lay piles of rotting acorns. Outside the mist had filled the forest,
  and the ways were muffled with fallen leaves, so that the four men who
  approached the place came as stealthily as shades.</p>

  <p>They reconnoitred a moment at the entrance, for it was a country of
  war.</p>

  <p>"Quarters for the night," said one, and put his shoulder to the door of
  oak-toppings hinged on strips of cowhide.</p>

  <p>But he had not taken a step inside before he hastily withdrew.</p>

  <p>"There is something there," he cried&mdash;"something that breathes. A
  light, Gil."</p>

  <p>One of the four lit a lantern from his flint and poked it within. It
  revealed the foul floor and the rotting acorns, and in the far corner, on a
  bed of withered boughs, something dark which might be a man. They stood still
  and listened. There was the sound of painful breathing, and then the gasp
  with which a sick man wakens. A figure disengaged itself from the shadows.
  Seeing it was but one man, the four pushed inside, and the last pulled the
  door to behind him.</p>

  <p>"What have we here?" the leader cried. A man had dragged himself to his
  feet, a short, square fellow who held himself erect with a grip on a
  side-post. His eyes were vacant, dazzled by the light and also by pain. He
  seemed to have had hard usage that day, for his shaggy locks were matted with
  blood from a sword-cut above his forehead, one arm hung limp, and his tunic
  was torn and gashed. He had no weapons but a knife which he held blade
  upwards in the hollow of his big hand.</p>

  <p>The four who confronted him were as ill-looking a quartet as Duke
  William's motley host could show. One, the leader, was an unfrocked priest of
  Rouen; one was a hedge-robber from the western marches who had followed Alan
  of Brittany; a third had the olive cheeks and the long nose of the south; and
  the fourth was a heavy German from beyond the Rhine. They were the kites that
  batten on the offal of war, and the great battle on the seashore having been
  won by better men, were creeping into the conquered land for the first fruits
  of its plunder.</p>

  <p>An English porker," cried the leader. "We will have the tusks off him."
  Indeed, in the wild light the wounded man, with his flat face and forked
  beard, had the look of a boar cornered by hounds.</p>

  <p>"'Ware his teeth," said the one they called Gil. "He has a knife in his
  trotter."</p>

  <p>The evil faces of the four were growing merry. They were worthless
  soldiers, but adepts in murder. Loot was their first thought, but after that
  furtive slaying. There seemed nothing to rob here, but there was weak flesh
  to make sport of.</p>

  <p>Gil warily crept on one side, where he held his spear ready. The
  ex-priest, who had picked up somewhere a round English buckler, gave the
  orders. "I will run in on him, and take his stroke, so you be ready to close.
  There is nothing to be feared from the swine. See, he is blooded and
  faints."</p>

  <p>The lantern had been set on the ground by the door and revealed only the
  lower limbs of the four. Their heads were murky in shadow. Their speech was
  foreign to the wounded man, but he saw their purpose. He was clearly foredone
  with pain, but his vacant eyes kindled to slow anger, and he shook back his
  hair so that the bleeding broke out again on his forehead. He was as silent
  as an old tusker at bay.</p>

  <p>The ex-priest gave the word and the four closed in on him. He defeated
  their plan by hurling himself on the leader's shield, so that his weight bore
  him backwards and he could not use his weapon. The spears on the flanks
  failed for the same reason, and the two men posted there had well-nigh been
  the death of each other. The fourth, the one from the south, whose business
  it had been to support the priest, tripped and fell sprawling beside the
  lantern.</p>

  <p>The Englishman had one arm round the priest's neck and was squeezing the
  breath out of him. But the blood of the four was kindling, and they had
  vengeance instead of sport to seek. Mouthing curses, the three of them went
  to the rescue of the leader, and a weaponless and sore-wounded man cannot
  strive with such odds. They overpowered him, bending his arms viciously back
  and kicking his broken head. Their oaths filled the hut with an ugly clamour,
  but no sound came from their victim.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a gust of air set the lantern flickering, and a new-comer stood
  in the doorway. He picked up the light and looked down on the struggle. He
  was a tall, very lean man, smooth faced, and black haired, helmetless and
  shieldless, but wearing the plated hauberk of the soldier. There was no
  scabbard on his left side, but his right hand held a long bright sword.</p>

  <p>For a second he lifted the light high, while he took in the scene. His
  eyes were dark and dancing, like the ripples on a peat stream. "So-ho!" he
  said softly. "Murder! And by our own vermin!"</p>

  <p>He appeared to brood for a second, and then he acted. For he set the light
  very carefully in the crook of a joist so that it illumined the whole hut.
  Then he reached out a hand, plucked the ex-priest from his quarry, and,
  swinging him in both arms, tossed him through the door into the darkness. It
  would seem that he fell hard, for there was a groan and then silence.</p>

  <p>"One less," he said softly.</p>

  <p>The three had turned to face him, warned by Gil's exclamation, and found
  themselves looking at the ominous bar of light which was his sword. Cornered
  like rats, they took small comfort from the odds. They were ready to
  surrender, still readier to run, and they stood on their defence with no
  fight in their faces, whining in their several patois. All but the man from
  the south. He was creeping round in the darkness by the walls, and had in his
  hands a knife. No mailed hauberk protected the interloper's back and there
  was a space there for steel to quiver between his shoulder blades.</p>

  <p>The newcomer did not see, but the eyes of the wounded man seemed to have
  been cleared by the scuffle. He was now free, and from the floor he snatched
  the round shield which the ex-priest had carried, and hurled it straight at
  the creeping miscreant. It was a heavy oaken thing with rim and boss of iron,
  and it caught him fairly above the ear, so that he dropped like a poled ox.
  The stranger turned his head to see what was happening. "A lucky shot,
  friend," he cried. "I thank you." And he addressed himself to the two pitiful
  bandits who remained.</p>

  <p>But their eyes were looking beyond him to the door, and their jaws had
  dropped in terror. For from outside came the sound of horses' hooves and
  bridles, and two riders had dismounted and were peering into the hut. The
  first was a very mountain of a man, whose conical helmet surmounted a vast
  pale face, on which blond moustaches hung like the teeth of a walrus. The
  said helmet was grievously battered, and the nose-piece was awry as if from
  some fierce blow, but there was no scar on the skin. His long hauberk was
  wrought in scales of steel and silver, and the fillets which bound his great
  legs were of fine red leather. Behind him came a grizzled squire, bearing a
  kite-shaped shield painted with the cognisance of a dove.</p>

  <p>"What have we here?" said the knight in a reedy voice like a boy's. His
  pale eyes contemplated the figures&mdash;the wounded man, now faint again
  with pain and half-fallen on the litter of branches; his deliverer, tall and
  grim, but with laughing face; the two murderers cringing in their fear; in a
  corner the huddled body of the man from the south half hidden by the shield.
  "Speak, fellow," and he addressed the soldier. "What work has been toward?
  Have you not had your bellyful of battles that you must scrabble like rats in
  this hovel? What are you called, and whence come you?"</p>

  <p>The soldier lifted his brow, looked his questioner full in the face, and,
  as if liking what he found there, bowed his head in respect. The huge man had
  the air of one to be obeyed.</p>

  <p>"I am of the Duke's army," he said, "and was sent on to reconnoitre the
  forest roads I stumbled on this hut and found four men about to slay a
  wounded English. One lies outside where I flung him, another is there with a
  cracked skull, and you have before you the remnant."</p>

  <p>The knight seemed to consider. "And why should a soldier of the Duke's be
  so careful of English lives?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I would help my lord Duke to conquer this land," was the answer. "We have
  broken their army and the way is straight before us. We shall have to fight
  other armies, but we cannot be fighting all our days, and we do not conquer
  England till England accepts us. I have heard enough of that stubborn people
  to know that the way to win them is not by murder. At fair fight, and then
  honest dealing and mercy, say I."</p>

  <p>The knight laughed. "A Solomon in judgement," he cried. "But who are you
  that bear a sword and wear gold on your finger?"</p>

  <p>The old squire broke in. "My lord Count, I know the man. He is a hunter of
  the Lord Odo's, and has a name for valour. He wrought mightily this morning
  on the hill. They call him Jehan the Hunter, and sometimes Jehan the Outborn,
  for no man knows his comings. There is a rumour that he is of high blood, and
  truly in battle he bears himself like a prince. The monks loved him not, but
  the Lord Odo favoured him."</p>

  <p>The knight looked steadily for the space of a moment at the tall soldier,
  and his light eyes seemed to read deep. "Are you that man," he asked at last,
  and got the reply: "I am Jehan the Hunter."</p>

  <p>"Bid my fellows attend to yon scum," he told his squire. "The camp marshal
  will have fruit for his gallows. The sweepings of all Europe have drifted
  with us to England, and it is our business to make bonfire of them before
  they breed a plague...  See to the wounded man, likewise. He may be one of
  the stout housecarls who fought with Harold at Stamford, and to meet us raced
  like a gale through the length of England. By the Mount of the Archangel, I
  would fain win such mettle to our cause."</p>

  <p>Presently the hut was empty save for the two soldiers, who faced each
  other while the lantern flickered to its end on the rafters.</p>

  <p>"The good Odo is dead," said the knight. "An arrow in the left eye has
  bereft our Duke of a noble ally and increased the blessedness of the City of
  Paradise. You are masterless now. Will you ride with me on my service, you
  Jehan the Hunter? It would appear that we are alike in our ways of thinking.
  They call me the Dove from the shield I bear, and a dove I seek to be in the
  winning of England. The hawk's task is over when the battle is won, and he
  who has but the sword for weapon is no hawk, but carrion-crow. We have to set
  our Duke on the throne, but that is but the first step. There are more
  battles before us, and when they are ended begins the slow task of the
  conquest of English hearts. How say you, Jehan? Will you ride north with me
  on this errand, and out of the lands which are granted me to govern have a
  corner on which to practise your creed?"</p>

  <p>So it befell that Jehan the Hunter, sometimes called Jehan the Outborn,
  joined the company of Ivo of Dives, and followed him when Duke William swept
  northward laughing his gross jolly laughter and swearing terribly by the
  splendour of God.</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always">PART 2</h3>

  <p>Two years later in the same month of the year Jehan rode east out of Ivo's
  new castle of Belvoir to visit the manor of which, by the grace of God and
  the King and the favour of the Count of Dives, he was now the lord. By the
  Dove's side he had been north to Durham and west to the Welsh marches, rather
  on falcon's than on dove's errands, for Ivo held that the crooning of peace
  notes came best after hard blows. But at his worst he was hawk and not crow,
  and malice did not follow his steps. The men he beat had a rude respect for
  one who was just and patient in victory, and whose laughter did not spare
  himself. Like master like man; and Jehan was presently so sealed of Ivo's
  brotherhood that in the tales of the time the two names were rarely separate.
  The jealous, swift to deprecate good fortune, spared the Outborn, for it was
  observed that he stood aside while others scrambled for gain. Also, though no
  man knew his birth, he bore himself with the pride of a king.</p>

  <p>When Ivo's raw stone towers faded in the blue distance, the road led from
  shaggy uplands into a forested plain, with knolls at intervals which gave the
  traveller a prospect of sullen levels up to the fringe of the fens and the
  line of the sea. Six men-at-arms jolted at his back on little country-red
  horses, for Jehan did his tasks with few helpers; and they rode well in the
  rear, for he loved to be alone. The weather was all October gleams and
  glooms, now the sunshine of April, now the purple depths of a thunderstorm.
  There was no rain in the air, but an infinity of mist, which moved in
  fantastic shapes, rolling close about the cavalcade, so that the very road
  edge was obscured, now dissolving into clear light, now opening up corridors
  at the end of which some landmark appeared at an immeasurable distance. In
  that fantastic afternoon the solid earth seemed to be dissolving, and Jehan's
  thoughts as he journeyed ranged like the mists.</p>

  <p>He told himself that he had discovered his country. He, the Outborn, had
  come home; the landless had found his settlement. He loved every acre of this
  strange England&mdash;its changing skies, the soft pastures in the valleys,
  the copses that clung like moss to the hills, the wide moorland that lay
  quiet as a grave from mountain to mountain. But this day something new had
  been joined to his affection. The air that met him from the east had that in
  it which stirred some antique memory. There was brine in it from the unruly
  eastern sea, and the sourness of marsh water, and the sweetness of marsh
  herbage. As the forest thinned into scrub again it came stronger and fresher,
  and he found himself sniffing it like a hungry man at the approach of food.
  "If my manor of Highstead is like this," he told himself, "I think I will lay
  my bones there."</p>

  <p>At a turn of the road where two grassy tracks forked, he passed a graven
  stone now chipped and moss-grown, set on noble eminence among reddening
  thorns. It was an altar to the old gods of the land, there had been another
  such in the forest of his childhood. The priest had told him it was the
  shrine of the Lord Apollo and forbade him on the pain of a mighty cursing to
  do reverence to it. Nevertheless he had been wont to doff his cap when he
  passed it, for he respected a god that lived in the woods instead of a clammy
  church. Now the sight of the ancient thing seemed an omen. It linked up the
  past and the present. He waved a greeting to it. "Hail, old friend," he said.
  "Bid your master be with me, whoever he be, for I go to find a home."</p>

  <p>One of his fellows rode up to his side. "We are within a mile of
  Highstead," he told him. "Better go warily, for the King's law runs limpingly
  in the fenlands. I counsel that a picket be sent forward to report if the way
  be clear. Every churl that we passed on the road will have sent news of our
  coming."</p>

  <p>"So much the better," said Jehan. "Man, I come not as a thief in the
  night. This is a daylight business. If I am to live my days here I must make
  a fair conquest."</p>

  <p>The man fell back sullenly, and there were anxious faces in the retinue
  jogging twenty yards behind. But no care sat on Jehan's brow. He plucked
  sprays of autumn berries and tossed and caught them, he sang gently to
  himself and spoke his thoughts to his horse. Harm could not come to him when
  air and scene woke in his heart such strange familiarity.</p>

  <p>A last turn of the road showed Highstead before him, two furlongs distant.
  The thatched roof of the hall rose out of a cluster of shingled huts on a
  mound defended by moat and palisade. No smoke came from the dwelling, and no
  man was visible, but not for nothing was Jehan named the Hunter. He was aware
  that every tuft of reed and scrog of wood concealed a spear or a bowman. So
  he set his head stiff and laughed, and hummed a bar of a song which the
  ferry-men used to sing on Seine side. "A man does not fight to win his home,"
  he told his horse, "but only to defend it when he has won it. If God so wills
  I shall be welcomed with open gates: otherwise there will be burying ere
  nightfall."</p>

  <p>In this fashion he rode steadfastly toward the silent burg. Now he was
  within a stone's throw of it, and no spear had been launched; now he was
  before the massive oaken gate. Suddenly it swung open and a man came out. He
  was a short, square fellow who limped, and, half hidden by his long hair, a
  great scar showed white on his forehead.</p>

  <p>"In whose name?" he asked in the English tongue.</p>

  <p>"In the name of our lord the King and the Earl Ivo."</p>

  <p>"That is no passport," said the man.</p>

  <p>"In my own name, then,&mdash;in the name of Jehan the Hunter."</p>

  <p>The man took two steps forward and laid a hand on the off stirrup. Jehan
  leaped to the ground and kissed him on both cheeks.</p>

  <p>"We have met before, friend," he said, and he took between his palms the
  joined hands of his new liege.</p>

  <p>"Two years back on the night of Hastings," said the man. "But for that
  meeting, my lord, you had tasted twenty arrows betwixt Highstead and the
  forest."</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always">PART 3</h3>

  <p>"I go to visit my neighbours," said Jehan next morning.</p>

  <p>Arn the Steward stared at his master with a puzzled face. "You will get a
  dusty welcome," he said. "There is but the Lady Hilda at Galland, and her
  brother Aelward is still at odds with your Duke."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless Jehan rode out in a clear dawn of St. Luke's summer, leaving
  a wondering man behind him, and he rode alone, having sent back his
  men-at-arms to Ivo. "He has the bold heart," said Arn to himself. "If there
  be many French like him there will assuredly be a new England."</p>

  <p>At Galland, which is low down in the fen country, he found a sullen girl.
  She met him at the bridge of the Galland fen and her grey eyes flashed fire.
  She was a tall maid, very fair to look upon, and the blue tunic which she
  wore over her russet gown was cunningly embroidered. Embroidered too with
  gold was the hood which confined her plaited yellow hair.</p>

  <p>"You find a defenceless house and a woman to conquer," she railed.</p>

  <p>"Long may it need no other warder," said Jehan, dismounting and looking at
  her across the water.</p>

  <p>"The fortune of war has given me a home, mistress. I would dwell in amity
  with my neighbours."</p>

  <p>"Amity!" she cried in scorn. "You will get none from me. My brother
  Aelward will do the parleying."</p>

  <p>"So be it," he said. "Be assured I will never cross this water into
  Galland till you bid me."</p>

  <p>He turned and rode home, and for a month was busied with the work of his
  farms. When he came again it was on a dark day in November, and every runnel
  of the fens was swollen. He got the same answer from the girl, and with it a
  warning "Aelward and his men wait for you in the oakshaw," she told him. "I
  sent word to them when the thralls brought news of you." And her pretty face
  was hard and angry.</p>

  <p>Jehan laughed. "Now, by your leave, mistress, I will wait here the hour or
  two till nightfall. I am Englishman enough to know that your folk do not
  strike in the dark."</p>

  <p>He returned to Highstead unscathed, and a week later came a message from
  Aelward. "Meet me," it ran, "to-morrow by the Danes' barrow at noon, and we
  will know whether Englishman or Frenchman is to bear rule in this land."</p>

  <p>Jehan donned his hauberk and girt himself with his long sword. "There will
  be hot work to-day in that forest," he told Arn, who was busied with the
  trussing of his mail.</p>

  <p>"God prosper you, master," said the steward. "Frenchman or no, you are
  such a man as I love. Beware of Aelward and his downward stroke, for he has
  the strength of ten."</p>

  <p>At noon by the Danes' barrow Jehan met a young tow-headed giant, who spoke
  with the back of his throat and made surly-response to the other's greeting.
  It was a blue winter's day, with rime still white on the grass, and the
  forest was very still. The Saxon had the shorter sword and a round buckler;
  Jehan fought only with his blade.</p>

  <p>At the first bout they strove with steel, and were ill-matched at that,
  for the heavy strength of the fenman was futile against the lithe speed of
  the hunter. Jehan ringed him in circles of light, and the famous downward
  stroke was expended on vacant air. He played with him till he breathed
  heavily like a cow, and then by a sleight of hand sent his sword spinning
  among the oak mast. The young giant stood sulkily before him, unarmed, deeply
  shamed, waiting on his death, but with no fear in his eyes.</p>

  <p>Jehan tossed his own blade to the ground, and stripped off his hauberk.
  "We have fought with weapons," he said, "now we will fight in the ancient
  way."</p>

  <p>There followed a very different contest. Aelward lost his shamefastness
  and his slow blood fired as flesh met flesh and sinew strained against sinew.
  His great arms crushed the Frenchman till the ribs cracked, but always the
  other slipped through and evaded the fatal hug. And as the struggle continued
  Aelward's heart warmed to his enemy. When their swords crossed he had hated
  him like death; now he seemed to be striving with a kinsman.</p>

  <p>Suddenly, when victory looked very near, he found the earth moving from
  beneath him, and a mountain descended on his skull. When he blinked himself
  into consciousness again, Jehan was laving his head from a pool in an
  oak-root.</p>

  <p>"I will teach you that throw some-day, friend," he was saying. "Had I not
  known the trick of it, you had mauled me sadly. I had liefer grapple with a
  bear.</p>

  <p>Aelward moistened his lips. "You have beat me fairly, armed and
  weaponless," he said, and his voice had no anger in it.</p>

  <p>"Talk not of beating between neighbours," was the answer. "We have played
  together and I have had the luck of it. It will be your turn to break my head
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Head matters little," grumbled Aelward. "Mine has stood harder dints. But
  you have broken my leg, and that means a month of housekeeping."</p>

  <p>Jehan made splints of ash for the leg, and set him upon his horse, and in
  this wise they came to the bridge of Galland fen. On the far side of the
  water stood the Lady Hilda. He halted and waited on her bidding. She gazed
  speechless at the horse whereon sat her brother with a clouted scalp.</p>

  <p>"What ails you, Frenchman?" said Aelward. "It is but a half-grown girl of
  my father's begetting."</p>

  <p>"I have vowed not to pass that bridge till yonder lady bids me."</p>

  <p>"Then for the pity of Christ bid him, sister. He and I are warm with play
  and yearn for a flagon."</p>

  <p>In this manner did Jehan first enter the house of Galland, whence in the
  next cowslip-time he carried a bride to Highstead.</p>

  <p>The months passed smoothly in the house on the knoll above the fat fen
  pastures. Jehan forsook his woodcraft for the work of byre and furrow and
  sheepfold, and the yield of his lands grew under his wardenship. He brought
  heavy French cattle to improve the little native breed, and made a garden of
  fruit trees where once had been only bent and sedge. The thralls wrought
  cheerfully for him, for he was a kindly master, and the freemen of the manor
  had no complaint against one who did impartial justice and respected their
  slow and ancient ways. As for skill in hunting, there was no fellow to the
  lord of Highstead between Trent and Thames.</p>

  <p>Inside the homestead the Lady Hilda moved happily, a wife smiling and well
  content. She had won more than a husband; it seemed she had made a convert;
  for daily Jehan grew into the country-side as if he had been born in it.
  Something in the soft woodland air and the sharper tang of the fens and the
  sea awoke response from his innermost soul. An aching affection was born in
  him for every acre of his little heritage. His son, dark like his father, who
  made his first diffident pilgrimages in the sunny close where the pigeons
  cooed, was not more thirled to English soil.</p>

  <p>They were quiet years in that remote place, for Aelward over at Galland
  had made his peace with the King. But when the little Jehan was four years
  old the tides of war lapped again to the forest edges. One Hugo of Auchy, who
  had had a usurer to his father and had risen in an iron age by a merciless
  greed, came a-foraying from the north to see how he might add to his
  fortunes. Men called him the Crane, for he was tall and lean and
  parchment-skinned, and to his banner resorted all malcontents and broken men.
  He sought to conduct a second Conquest, making war on the English who still
  held their lands, but sparing the French manors. The King's justice was
  slow-footed, and the King was far away, so the threatened men, banded
  together to hold their own by their own might.</p>

  <p>Aelward brought the news from Galland that the Crane had entered their
  borders. The good Ivo was overseas, busy on the Brittany marches, and there
  was no ruler in Fenland.</p>

  <p>"You he will spare," Aelward told his sister's husband. "He does not war
  with you new-comers. But us of the old stock he claims as his prey. How say
  you, Frenchman? Will you reason with him? Hereaways we are peaceful folk, and
  would fain get on with our harvest."</p>

  <p>"I will reason with him," said Jehan, "and by the only logic that such
  carrion understands. I am by your side, brother. There is but the one cause
  for all us countrymen."</p>

  <p>But that afternoon as he walked abroad in his corn-lands he saw a portent.
  A heron rose out of the shallows, and a harrier-hawk swooped to the pounce,
  but the long bird flopped securely into the western sky, and the hawk dropped
  at his feet, dead but with no mark of a wound.</p>

  <p>"Here be marvels," said Jehan, and with that there came on him the
  foreknowledge of fate, which in the brave heart wakes awe, but no fear. He
  stood silent for a time and gazed over his homelands. The bere <a href=
  "#endnote10">[10]</a> was shaking white and gold in the light evening wind;
  in the new orchard he had planted the apples were reddening; from the edge of
  the forest land rose wreaths of smoke where the thralls were busy with
  wood-clearing. There was little sound in the air, but from the steading came
  the happy laughter of a child. Jehan stood very still, and his wistful eyes
  drank the peace of it.</p>

  <p>"<i>Non nobis, Domine</i> <a href="#endnote11">[11]</a> ," he said, for a
  priest had once had the training of him. "But I leave that which shall not
  die."</p>

  <p>He summoned his wife and told her of the coming of the Crane. From a
  finger of his left hand he took the thick ring of gold which Ivo had marked
  years before in the Wealden hut.</p>

  <p>"I have a notion that I am going a long journey," he told her. "If I do
  not return, the Lord Ivo will confirm the little lad in these lands of ours.
  But to you and for his sake I make my own bequest. Wear this ring for him
  till he is a man, and then bid him wear it as his father's guerdon. I had it
  from my father, who had it from his, and my grandfather told me the tale of
  it. In his grandsire's day it was a mighty armlet, but in the famine years it
  was melted and part sold, and only this remains. Some one of us far back was
  a king, and this is the badge of a king's house. There comes a day, little
  one, when the fruit of our bodies shall possess a throne. See that the lad be
  royal in thought and deed, as he is royal in blood."</p>

  <p>Next morning he kissed his wife and fondled his little son, and with his
  men rode northward, his eyes wistful but his mouth smiling.</p>

  <p>What followed was for generations a tale among humble folk in England, who
  knew nothing of the deeds of the King's armies. By cottage fires they wove
  stories about it and made simple songs, the echo of which may still be traced
  by curious scholars. There is something of it in the great saga of Robin
  Hood, and long after the fens were drained women hushed their babies with
  snatches about the Crane and the Falcon, and fairy tales of a certain John of
  the Shaws, who became one with Jack the Giant-killer and all the nursery
  heroes.</p>

  <p>Jehan and his band met Aelward at the appointed rendezvous, and soon were
  joined by a dozen knots of lusty yeomen, who fought not only for themselves
  but for the law of England and the peace of the new king. Of the little force
  Jehan was appointed leader, and once again became the Hunter, stalking a
  baser quarry than wolf or boar. For the Crane and his rabble, flushed with
  easy conquest, kept ill watch, and the tongues of forest running down to the
  fenland made a good hunting ground for a wary forester.</p>

  <p>Jehan's pickets found Hugo of Auchy by the Sheen brook and brought back
  tidings. Thereupon a subtle plan was made. By day and night the invaders'
  camp was kept uneasy; there would be sudden attacks, which died down after a
  few blows; stragglers disappeared, scouts never returned; and when a peasant
  was brought in and forced to speak, he told with scared face a tale of the
  great mustering of desperate men in this or that quarter. The Crane was a
  hardy fighter, but the mystery baffled him, and he became cautious,
  and&mdash;after the fashion of his kind credulous. Bit by bit Jehan
  shepherded him into the trap he had prepared. He had but one man to the
  enemy's six, and must drain that enemy's strength before he struck. Meantime
  the little steadings went up in flames, but with every blaze seen in the
  autumn dusk the English temper grew more stubborn. They waited confidently on
  the reckoning.</p>

  <p>It came on a bleak morning when the east wind blew rain and fog from the
  sea. The Crane was in a spit of open woodland, with before him and on either
  side deep fenland with paths known only to its dwellers. Then Jehan struck.
  He drove his enemy to the point of the dry ground, and thrust him into the
  marshes. Not since the time of the Danes had the land known such a slaying.
  The refuse of France and the traitor English who had joined them went down
  like sheep before wolves. When the Lord Ivo arrived in the late afternoon,
  having ridden hot-speed from the south coast when he got the tidings, he
  found little left of the marauders save the dead on the land and the scum of
  red on the fen pools.</p>

  <p>Jehan lay by a clump of hazels, the blood welling from an axe-wound in the
  neck. His face was ashen with the oncoming of death, but he smiled as he
  looked up at his lord.</p>

  <p>"The Crane pecked me," he said. "He had a stout bill, if a black
  heart."</p>

  <p>Ivo wept aloud, being pitiful as he was brave. He would have scoured the
  country for a priest.</p>

  <p>"Farewell, old comrade," he sobbed. "Give greeting to Odo in Paradise, and
  keep a place for me by your side. I will nourish your son, as if he had been
  that one of my own whom Heaven has denied me. Tarry a little, dear heart, and
  the Priest of Glede will be here to shrive you."</p>

  <p>Through the thicket there crawled a mighty figure, his yellow hair dabbled
  in blood, and his breath labouring like wind in a threshing-floor. He lay
  down by Jehan's side, and with a last effort kissed him on the lips.</p>

  <p>"Priest!" cried the dying Aelward. "What need is there of priest to help
  us two English on our way to God?"</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref4"
     id="ref4"></a>CHAPTER 3</h3>

  <h2>THE WIFE OF FLANDERS</h2>

  <p>From the bed set high on a dais came eerie spasms of laughter, a harsh
  cackle like fowls at feeding time.</p>

  <p>"Is that the last of them, Anton?" said a voice.</p>

  <p>A little serving-man with an apple-hued face bowed in reply. He bowed with
  difficulty, for in his arms he held a huge grey cat, which still mewed with
  the excitement of the chase. Rats had been turned loose on the floor, and it
  had accounted for them to the accompaniment of a shrill urging from the bed.
  Now the sport was over, and the domestics who had crowded round the door to
  see it had slipped away, leaving only Anton and the cat.</p>

  <p>"Give Tib a full meal of offal," came the order, "and away with yourself.
  Your rats are a weak breed. Get me the stout grey monsters like Tuesday
  se'ennight."</p>

  <p>The room was empty now save for two figures both wearing the habit of the
  religious. Near the bed sat a man in the full black robe and hood of the
  monks of Cluny. He warmed plump hands at the brazier and seemed at ease and
  at home. By the door stood a different figure in the shabby clothes of a
  parish priest, a curate from the kirk of St. Martin's who had been a
  scandalised spectator of the rat hunt. He shuffled his feet as if uncertain
  of his next step&mdash;a thin, pale man with a pinched mouth and timid
  earnest eyes.</p>

  <p>The glance from the bed fell on him "What will the fellow be at?" said the
  voice testily. "He stands there like a sow about to litter, and stares and
  grunts. Good e'en to you, friend. When you are wanted you will be sent for
  Jesu's name, what have I done to have that howlet glowering at me?"</p>

  <p>The priest at the words crossed himself and turned to go, with a tinge of
  red in his sallow cheeks. He was faithful to his duties and had come to
  console a death bed, though he was well aware that his consolations would be
  spurned.</p>

  <p>As he left there came again the eerie laughter from the bed. "Ugh, I am
  weary of that incomparable holiness. He hovers about to give me the St.
  John's Cup, and would fain speed my passing. But I do not die yet, good
  father. There's life still in the old wolf."</p>

  <p>The monk in a bland voice spoke some Latin to the effect that mortal times
  and seasons were ordained of God. The other stretched out a skinny hand from
  the fur coverings and rang a silver bell. When Anton appeared she gave the
  order "Bring supper for the reverend father," at which the Cluniac's face
  mellowed into complacence.</p>

  <p>It was a Friday evening in a hard February. Out-of-doors the snow lay deep
  in the streets of Bruges, and every canal was frozen solid so that carts
  rumbled along them as on a street. A wind had risen which drifted the powdery
  snow and blew icy draughts through every chink. The small-paned windows of
  the great upper-room were filled with oiled vellum, but they did not keep out
  the weather, and currents of cold air passed through them to the doorway,
  making the smoke of the four charcoal braziers eddy and swirl. The place was
  warm, yet shot with bitter gusts, and the smell of burning herbs gave it the
  heaviness of a chapel at high mass. Hanging silver lamps, which blazed blue
  and smoky, lit it in patches, sufficient to show the cleanness of the
  rush-strewn floor, the glory of the hangings of cloth-of-gold and damask, and
  the burnished sheen of the metal-work. There was no costlier chamber in that
  rich city.</p>

  <p>It was a strange staging for death, for the woman on the high bed was
  dying. Slowly, fighting every inch of the way with a grim tenacity, but
  indubitably dying. Her vital ardour had sunk below the mark from which it
  could rise again, and was now ebbing as water runs from a little crack in a
  pitcher. The best leeches in all Flanders and Artois had come to doctor her.
  They had prescribed the horrid potions of the age: tinctures of earth-worms;
  confections of spiders and wood-lice and viper's flesh; broth of human
  skulls, oil, wine, ants' eggs, and crabs' claws; the <i>bufo preparatus</i>,
  which was a live toad roasted in a pot and ground to a powder; and
  innumerable plaisters and electuaries <a href="#endnote12">[12]</a> . She had
  begun by submitting meekly, for she longed to live, and had ended, for she
  was a shrewd woman, by throwing the stuff at the apothecaries' heads. Now she
  ordained her own diet, which was of lamb's flesh lightly boiled, and woman's
  milk, got from a wench in the purlieus of St. Sauveur. The one medicine which
  she retained was powdered elk's horn, which had been taken from the beast
  between two festivals of the Virgin. This she had from the foresters in the
  Houthulst woods, and swallowed it in white wine an hour after every dawn.</p>

  <p>The bed was a noble thing of ebony, brought by the Rhine road from Venice,
  and carved with fantastic hunting scenes by Hainault craftsmen. Its hangings
  were stiff brocaded silver, and above the pillows a great unicorn's horn, to
  protect against poisoning, stood out like the beak of a ship. The horn cast
  an odd shadow athwart the bed, so that a big claw seemed to lie on the
  coverlet curving towards the throat of her who lay there. The parish priest
  had noticed this at his first coming that evening, and had muttered fearful
  prayers.</p>

  <p>The face on the pillows was hard to discern in the gloom, but when Anton
  laid the table for the Cluniac's meal and set a lamp on it, he lit up the
  cavernous interior of the bed, so that it became the main thing in the
  chamber. It was the face of a woman who still retained the lines and the
  colouring of youth. The voice had harshened with age, and the hair was white
  as wool, but the cheeks were still rosy and the grey eyes still had fire.
  Notable beauty had once been there. The finely arched brows, the oval of the
  face which the years had scarcely sharpened, the proud, delicate nose, all
  spoke of it. It was as if their possessor recognised those things and would
  not part with them, for her attire had none of the dishevelment of a
  sickroom. Her coif of fine silk was neatly adjusted, and the great robe of
  marten's fur which cloaked her shoulders was fastened with a jewel of rubies
  which glowed in the lamplight like a star.</p>

  <p>Something chattered beside her. It was a little brown monkey which had
  made a nest in the warm bedclothes.</p>

  <p>She watched with sharp eyes the setting of the table. It was a Friday's
  meal and the guest was a monk, so it followed a fashion, but in that house of
  wealth, which had links with the ends of the earth, the monotony was
  cunningly varied. There were oysters from the Boulogne coast, and lampreys
  from the Loire, and pickled salmon from England. There was a dish of liver
  dressed with rice and herbs in the manner of the Turk, for liver, though
  contained in flesh, was not reckoned as flesh by liberal churchmen. There was
  a roast goose from the shore marshes, that barnacle bird which pious epicures
  classed as shell-fish and thought fit for fast days. A silver basket held a
  store of thin toasted rye-cakes, and by the monk's hand stood a flagon of
  that drink most dear to holy palates, the rich syrupy hippocras. <a href=
  "#endnote13">[13]</a></p>

  <p>The woman looked on the table with approval, for her house had always
  prided itself upon its good fare. The Cluniac's urbane composure was stirred
  to enthusiasm. He said a <i>Confiteor tibi, Domine</i>, rolling the words on
  his tongue as if in anticipation of the solider mouthfuls awaiting him. The
  keen weather had whetted his appetite and he thanked God that his northern
  peregrinations had brought him to a house where the Church was thus honoured.
  He had liked the cavalier treatment of the lean parish priest, a sour dog who
  brought his calling into disfavour with the rich and godly. He tucked back
  his sleeves, adjusted the linen napkin comfortably about his neck, and fell
  to with a will. He raised his first glass of hippocras and gave thanks to his
  hostess. A true mother in Israel!</p>

  <p>She was looking at him with favour. He was the breed of monk that she
  liked, suave, well-mannered, observant of men and cities. Already he had told
  her entertaining matter about the French King's court, and the new Burgrave
  of Ghent, and the escapades of Count Baldwin. He had lived much among
  gentlefolk and kept his ears open...  She felt stronger and cheerfuller than
  she had been for days. That rat-hunt had warmed her blood. She was a long way
  from death in spite of the cackle of idiot chirurgeons, and there was much
  savour still in the world. There was her son, too, the young Philip...  Her
  eye saw clearer, and she noted the sombre magnificence of the great room, the
  glory of the brocade, the gleam of silver. Was she not the richest woman in
  all Bruges, aye, and in all Hainault and Guelderland? And the credit was her
  own. After the fashion of age in such moods her mind flew backward, and she
  saw very plain a narrow street in a wind-swept town looking out on a bleak
  sea. She had been cold, then, and hungry, and deathly poor. Well, she had
  travelled some way from that hovel. She watched the thick carved stems of the
  candlesticks and felt a spacious ease and power.</p>

  <p>The Cluniac was speaking. He had supped so well that he was in love with
  the world.</p>

  <p>"Your house and board, my lady, are queen-like. I have seen worse in
  palaces."</p>

  <p>Her laugh was only half pleased. "Too fine, you would add, for a burgher
  wife. Maybe, but rank is but as man makes it. The Kings of England are sprung
  of a tanner. Hark you, father! I made a vow to God when I was a maid, and I
  have fulfilled my side of the bargain. I am come of a nobler race than any
  Markgrave, aye, than the Emperor himself, and I swore to set the seed of my
  body, which the Lord might grant me, again among the great ones. Have I not
  done it? Is not Philip, my son, affianced to that pale girl of Avesnes, and
  with more acres of pleasant land to his name than any knightlet in
  Artois?"</p>

  <p>The Cluniac bowed a courtly head. "It is a great alliance&mdash;but not
  above the dignity of your house."</p>

  <p>"House you call it, and I have had the making of it. What was Willebald
  but a plain merchant-man, one of many scores at the Friday Market? Willebald
  was clay that I moulded and gilded till God put him to bed under a noble lid
  in the New Kirk. A worthy man, but loutish and slow like one of his own
  hookers. Yet when I saw him on the plainstones by the English harbour I knew
  that he was a weapon made for my hand."</p>

  <p>Her voice had become even and gentle as of one who remembers far-away
  things. The Cluniac, having dipped his hands in a silver basin, was drying
  them in the brazier's heat. Presently he set to picking his teeth daintily
  with a quill, and fell into the listener's pose. From long experience he knew
  the atmosphere which heralds confidences, and was willing to humour the
  provider of such royal fare.</p>

  <p>"You have never journeyed to King's Lynn?" said the voice from the bed.
  "There is little to see there but mud-bars and fens and a noisy sea. There I
  dwelt when I was fifteen years of age, a maid hungry in soul and body. I knew
  I was of the seed of Forester John and through him the child of a motley of
  ancient kings, but war and famine had stripped our house to the bone. And now
  I, the last of the stock, dwelt with a miserly mother's uncle who did
  shipwright's work for the foreign captains. The mirror told me that I was
  fair to look on, though ill-nourished, and my soul assured me that I had no
  fear. Therefore I had hope, but I ate my heart out waiting on fortune."</p>

  <p>She was looking at the monk with unseeing eyes, her head half turned
  towards him.</p>

  <p>"Then came Willebald one March morning. I saw him walk up the jetty in a
  new red cloak, a personable man with a broad beard and a jolly laugh. I knew
  him by repute as the luckiest of the Flemish venturers. In him I saw my
  fortune. That night he supped at my uncle's house and a week later he sought
  me in marriage. My uncle would have bargained, but I had become a grown woman
  and silenced him. With Willebald I did not chaffer, for I read his heart and
  knew that in a little he would be wax to me. So we were wed, and I took to
  him no dowry but a ring which came to me from my forebears, and a brain that
  gold does not buy."</p>

  <p>The monkey by her side broke into a chattering.</p>

  <p>"Peace, Peterkin," she said. "You mind me of the babbling of the
  merchant-folk, when I spurred Willebald into new roads. He had done as his
  father before him, and bought wool and salted fish from the English, paying
  with the stuffs of our Flemish looms. A good trade of small and sure profits,
  but I sought bigger quarries. For, mark you, there was much in England that
  had a value in this country of ours which no Englishman guessed."</p>

  <p>"Of what nature?" the monk asked with curiosity in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Roman things. Once in that land of bogs and forests there were bustling
  Roman towns and rich Roman houses, which disappeared as every tide brought in
  new robbers from the sea. Yes, but not all. Much of the preciousness was
  hidden and the place of its hiding forgotten. Bit by bit the churls found the
  treasure-trove, but they did not tell their lords. They melted down jewels
  and sold them piecemeal to Jews for Jews' prices, and what they did not
  recognise as precious they wantonly destroyed. I have seen the marble heads
  of heathen gods broken with the hammer to make mortar of, and great cups of
  onyx and alabaster used as water troughs for a thrall's mongrels...  Knowing
  the land, I sent pedlars north and west to collect such stuff, and what I
  bought for pence I sold for much gold in the Germanies and throughout the
  French cities. Thus Willebald amassed wealth, till it was no longer worth his
  while to travel the seas. We lived snug in Flanders, and our servants
  throughout the broad earth were busy getting us gear."</p>

  <p>The Cluniac was all interest. The making of money lay very near the heart
  of his Order. "I have heard wondrous tales of your enterprise," he told her.
  "I would fain know the truth."</p>

  <p>"Packman's tricks," she laughed. "Nevertheless it is a good story. For I
  turned my eyes to the East, whence come those things that make the pride of
  life. The merchants of Venice were princes, and it was in my head to make
  those of Bruges no worse. What did it profit that the wind turned daily the
  sails of our three hundred mills if we limited ourselves to common burgher
  wares and the narrow northern markets? We sent emissaries up the Rhine and
  beyond the Alps to the Venice princes, and brought hither the spices and
  confections of Egypt and the fruits and wines of Greece, and the woven stuffs
  of Asia till the marts of Flanders had the savour of Araby. Presently in our
  booths could be seen silks of Italy, and choice metals from Innsbruck, and
  furs from Muscovy, and strange birds and beasts from Prester John's country,
  and at our fairs such a concourse of outlandish traders as put Venice to
  shame. 'Twas a long fight and a bitter for Willebald and me, since, mark you,
  we had to make a new road over icy mountains, with a horde of freebooters
  hanging on the skirts of our merchant trains and every little burg on the way
  jealous to hamper us. Yet if the heart be resolute, barriers will fall. Many
  times we were on the edge of beggary, and grievous were our losses, but in
  the end we triumphed. There came a day when we had so many bands of the Free
  Companions in our pay that the progress of our merchandise was like that of a
  great army, and from rivals we made the roadside burgs our allies, sharing
  modestly in our ventures. Also there were other ways. A pilgrim travels
  unsuspect, for who dare rob a holy man? and he is free from burgal dues; but
  if the goods be small and very precious, pilgrims may carry them."</p>

  <p>The monk, as in duty bound, shook a disapproving head.</p>

  <p>"Sin, doubtless," said the woman, "but I have made ample atonement. Did I
  not buy with a bushel of gold a leg of the blessed St. George for the New
  Kirk, and give to St. Martin's a diamond as big as a thumb nail and so bright
  that on a dark day it is a candle to the shrine? Did not I give to our Lady
  at Aix a crown of ostrich feathers the marrow of which is not in
  Christendom?"</p>

  <p>"A mother in Israel, in truth," murmured the cleric.</p>

  <p>"Yea, in Israel," said the old wife with a chuckle. "Israel was the kernel
  of our perplexities. The good Flemings saw no farther than their noses, and
  laughed at Willebald when he began his ventures. When success came, it was
  easy to win them over, and by admitting them to a share in our profits get
  them to fling their caps in the air and huzza for their benefactors. But the
  Jews were a tougher stock. Mark you, father, when God blinded their eyes to
  the coming of the Lord Christ, He opened them very wide to all lower matters.
  Their imagination is quick to kindle, and they are as bold in merchantcraft
  as Charlemagne in war. They saw what I was after before I had been a month at
  it, and were quick to profit by my foresight. There are but two ways to deal
  with Israelites&mdash;root them from the face of the earth or make them
  partners with you. Willebald would have fought them; I, more wise, bought
  them at a price. For two score years they have wrought faithfully for me. You
  say well, a mother in Israel!"</p>

  <p>"I could wish that a Christian lady had no dealings with the accursed
  race," said the Cluniac.</p>

  <p>"You could wish folly," was the tart answer. "I am not as your burgher
  folk, and on my own affairs I take no man's guiding, be he monk or merchant.
  Willebald is long dead; may he sleep in peace, He was no mate for me, but for
  what he gave me I repaid him in the coin he loved best. He was a proud man
  when he walked through the Friday Market with every cap doffed. He was ever
  the burgher, like the child I bore him."</p>

  <p>"I had thought the marriage more fruitful. They spoke of two children, a
  daughter and a son."</p>

  <p>The woman turned round in her bed so that she faced him. The monkey
  whimpered and she cuffed its ears. Her face was sharp and exultant, and for a
  sick person her eyes were oddly bright.</p>

  <p>"The girl was Willebald's. A poor slip of vulgar stock with the spirit of
  a house cat. I would have married her well, for she was handsome after a
  fashion, but she thwarted me and chose to wed a lout of a huckster in the
  Bredestreet. She shall have her portion from Willebald's gold, but none from
  me. But Philip is true child of mine, and sprung on both sides of high race.
  Nay, I name no names, and before men he is of my husband's getting. But to
  you at the end of my days I speak the truth. That son of wrath has rare blood
  in him. Philip... "</p>

  <p>The old face had grown kind. She was looking through the monk to some
  happy country of vision. Her thoughts were retracing the roads of time, and
  after the way of age she spoke them aloud. imperiously she had forgotten her
  company.</p>

  <p>"So long ago," came the tender voice. "It is years since they told me he
  was dead among the heathen, fighting by the Lord Baldwin's side. But I can
  see him as if it were yesterday, when he rode into these streets in spring
  with April blooms at his saddle-bow. They called him Phadbus in jest, for his
  face was like the sun...  Willebald, good dull man, was never jealous, and
  was glad that his wife should be seen in brave company. Ah, the afternoons at
  the baths when we sported like sea-nymphs and sang merry ballads! And the
  proud days of Carnival where men and women consorted freely and without guile
  like the blessed in Paradise! Such a tide for lovers!...  Did I not lead the
  dance with him at the Burgrave's festival, the twain of us braver than
  morning? Sat I not with him in the garden of St. Vaast, his head in my lap,
  while he sang me virelays <a href="#endnote14">[14]</a> of the south? What
  was Willebald to me or his lean grey wife to him? He made me his queen, me
  the burgher wife, at the jousting at Courtrai, when the horses squealed like
  pigs in the mellay and I wept in fear for him. Ah, the lost sweet days!
  Philip, my darling, you make a brave gentleman, but you will not equal him
  who loved your mother."</p>

  <p>The Cluniac was a man of the world whom no confidences could scandalise.
  But he had business of his own to speak of that night, and he thought it wise
  to break into this mood of reminiscence.</p>

  <p>"The young lord, Philip, your son, madam? You have great plans for him?
  What does he at the moment?"</p>

  <p>The softness went out of the voice and the woman's gaze came back to the
  chamber. "That I know not. Travelling the ways of the world and plucking
  roadside fruits, for he is no home-bred and womanish stripling. Wearing his
  lusty youth on the maids, I fear. Nay, I forget. He is about to wed the girl
  of Avesnes and is already choosing his bridal train. It seems he loves her.
  He writes me she has a skin of snow and eyes of vair. <a href=
  "#endnote15">[15]</a> I have not seen her. A green girl, doubtless with a
  white face and cat's eyes. But she is of Avesnes, and that blood comes pure
  from Clovis, and there is none prouder in Hainault. He will husband her well,
  but she will be a clever woman if she tethers to her side a man of my
  bearing. He will be for the high road and the battle-front."</p>

  <p>"A puissant and peaceable knight, I have heard tell," said the
  Cluniac.</p>

  <p>"Puissant beyond doubt, and peaceable when his will is served. He will
  play boldly for great things and will win them. Ah, monk! What knows a
  childless religious of a mother's certainty? 'Twas not for nothing that I
  found Willebald and changed the cobbles of King's Lynn for this fat country.
  It is gold that brings power, and the stiffest royal neck must bend to him
  who has the deep coffers. It is gold and his high hand that will set my
  Philip by the side of kings. Lord Jesus, what a fortune I have made for him!
  There is coined money at the goldsmiths' and in my cellars, and the ships at
  the ports, and a hundred busy looms, and lands in Hainault and Artois, and
  fair houses in Bruges and Ghent. Boats on the Rhine and many pack trains
  between Antwerp and Venice are his, and a wealth of preciousness lies in his
  name with the Italian merchants. Likewise there is this dwelling of mine,
  with plenishing <a href="#endnote16">[16]</a> which few kings could buy. My
  sands sink in the glass, but as I lie a-bed I hear the bustle of wains and
  horses in the streets, and the talk of shipfolk, and the clatter of my
  serving men beneath, and I know that daily, hourly, more riches flow hither
  to furnish my son's kingdom."</p>

  <p>The monk's eyes sparkled at this vision of wealth, and he remembered his
  errand.</p>

  <p>"A most noble heritage. But if the Sire God in His inscrutable providence
  should call your son to His holy side, what provision have you made for so
  mighty a fortune? Does your daughter then share?"</p>

  <p>The face on the pillows became suddenly wicked and very old. The eyes were
  lit with hate.</p>

  <p>"Not a bezant of which I have the bequeathing. She has something from
  Willebald, and her dull husband makes a livelihood. 'Twill suffice for the
  female brats, of whom she has brought three into the world to cumber it...
  By the Gospels, she will lie on the bed she has made. I did not scheme and
  toil to make gold for such leaden souls."</p>

  <p>"But if your most worthy son should die ere he has begot children, have
  you made no disposition?" The monk's voice was pointed with anxiety, for was
  not certainty on this point the object of his journey? The woman perceived it
  and laughed maliciously.</p>

  <p>"I have made dispositions. Such a chapel will be builded in the New Kirk
  as Rome cannot equal. Likewise there will be benefactions for the poor and a
  great endowment for the monks at St. Sauveur. If my seed is not to continue
  on earth I will make favour in Paradise."</p>

  <p>"And we of Cluny, madam?" The voice trembled in spite of its training.</p>

  <p>"Nay I have not forgotten Cluny. Its Abbot shall have the gold flagons
  from Jerusalem and some wherewithal in money. But what is this talk? Philip
  will not die, and like his mother he loves Holy Church and will befriend her
  in all her works...  Listen, father, it is long past the hour when men cease
  from labour, and yet my provident folk are busy. Hark to the bustle below.
  That will be the convoy from the Vermandois. Jesu, what a night!"</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p><br>

  <p>Flurries of snow beat on windows, and draughts stirred the hot ashes in
  the braziers and sent the smoke from them in odd spirals about the chamber.
  It had become perishing cold, and the monkey among the bedclothes whimpered
  and snuggled closer into his nest. There seemed to be a great stir about the
  house-door. Loud voices were heard in gusts, and a sound like a woman's cry.
  The head on the pillow was raised to listen.</p>

  <p>"A murrain on those folk. There has been bungling among the pack-riders.
  That new man Derek is an oaf of oafs."</p>

  <p>She rang her silver bell sharply and waited on the ready footsteps. But
  none came. There was silence now below, an ominous silence.</p>

  <p>"God's curse upon this household," the woman cried. The monkey whimpered
  again, and she took it by the scruff and tossed it to the floor. "Peace, ape,
  or I will have you strangled. Bestir yourself, father, and call Anton. There
  is a blight of deafness in this place."</p>

  <p>The room had suddenly lost its comfort and become cold and desolate. The
  lamps were burning low and the coloured hangings were in deep shadow. The
  storm was knocking fiercely at the lattice.</p>

  <p>The monk rose with a shiver to do her bidding, but he was forestalled.
  Steps sounded on the stairs and the steward entered. The woman in the bed had
  opened her mouth to upbraid, when something in his dim figure struck her
  silent.</p>

  <p>The old man stumbled forward and fell on his knees beside her.</p>

  <p>"Madam, dear madam," he stammered, "ill news has come to this house...
  There is a post in from Avesnes...  The young master... "</p>

  <p>"Philip," and the woman's voice rose to a scream. "What of my son?"</p>

  <p>"The lord has taken away what He gave. He is dead, slain in a scuffle with
  highway robbers...  Oh, the noble young lord! The fair young knight! Woe upon
  this stricken house!"</p>

  <p>The woman lay very still, white the old man on his knees drifted into
  broken prayers. Then he observed her silence, scrambled to his feet in a
  panic, and lit two candles from the nearest brazier. She lay back on the
  pillows in a deathly faintness, her face drained of blood. Only her tortured
  eyes showed that life was still in her.</p>

  <p>Her voice came at last, no louder than a whisper. It was soft now, but
  more terrible than the old harshness.</p>

  <p>"I follow Philip," it said. "<i>Sic transit gloria</i>...  Call me Arnulf
  the goldsmith and Robert the scrivener...  Quick, man, quick. I have much to
  do ere I die."</p>

  <p>As the steward hurried out, the Cluniac, remembering his office, sought to
  offer comfort, but in his bland worldling's voice the consolations sounded
  hollow. She lay motionless, while he quoted the Scriptures. Encouraged by her
  docility, he spoke of the certain reward promised by Heaven to the rich who
  remembered the Church at their death. He touched upon the high duties of his
  Order and the handicap of its poverty. He bade her remember her debt to the
  Abbot of Cluny.</p>

  <p>She seemed about to speak and he bent eagerly to catch her words.</p>

  <p>"Peace, you babbler," she said. "I am done with your God. When I meet Him
  I will outface Him. He has broken His compact and betrayed me. My riches go
  to the Burgrave for the comfort of this city where they were won. Let your
  broken rush of a Church wither and rot!"</p>

  <p>Scared out of all composure by this blasphemy, the Cluniac fell to
  crossing himself and mumbling invocations. The diplomat had vanished and only
  the frightened monk remained. He would fain have left the room had he dared,
  but the spell of her masterful spirit held him. After that she spoke nothing
 ... </p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p><br>

  <p>Again there was a noise on the stairs and she moved a little, as if
  mustering her failing strength for the ultimate business. But it was not
  Arnulf the gold smith. It was Anton, and he shook like a man on his way to
  the gallows.</p>

  <p>"Madam, dear madam," he stammered, again on his knees. "There is another
  message. One has come from the Bredestreet with word of your lady daughter.
  An hour ago she has borne a child...  A lusty son, madam."</p>

  <p>The reply from the bed was laughter.</p>

  <p>It began low and hoarse like a fit of coughing, and rose to the high
  cackling mirth of extreme age. At the sound both Anton and the monk took to
  praying. Presently it stopped, and her voice came full and strong as it had
  been of old.</p>

  <p>"<i>Mea culpa,</i>" it said, "<i>mea maxima culpa</i>. I judged the Sire
  God over hastily. He is merry and has wrought a jest on me. He has kept His
  celestial promise in His own fashion. He takes my brave Philip and gives me
  instead a suckling...  So be it. The infant has my blood, and the race of
  Forester John will not die. Arnulf will have an easy task.</p>

  <p>"He need but set the name of this new-born in Philip's place. What manner
  of child is he, Anton? Lusty, you say, and well-formed? I would my arms could
  have held him...  But I must be about my business of dying. I will take the
  news to Philip."</p>

  <p>Hope had risen again in the Cluniac's breast. It seemed that here was a
  penitent. He approached the bed with a raised crucifix, and stumbled over the
  whimpering monkey. The woman's eyes saw him and a last flicker woke in
  them.</p>

  <p>"Begone, man," she cried. "I have done with the world. Anton, rid me of
  both these apes. And fetch the priest of St. Martin's, for I would confess
  and be shriven. Yon curate is no doubt a fool, but he serves my jesting
  God."</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref5"
     id="ref5"></a>CHAPTER 4</h3>

  <h2>EYES OF YOUTH</h2>

  <p>On the morning of Shrove Tuesday, in the year of our Lord 1249, Sir Aimery
  of Beaumanoir, the envoy of the most Christian king, Louis of France, arrived
  in the port of Acre, having made the voyage from Cyprus with a fair wind in a
  day and a night in a ship of Genoa flying the red and gold banner of the
  Temple. Weary of the palms and sun-baked streets of Limasol and the eternal
  wrangling of the Crusading hosts, he looked with favour at the noble
  Palestine harbour, and the gilt steeples and carven houses of the fair city.
  From the quay he rode to the palace of the Templars and was admitted
  straightway to an audience with the Grand Master. For he had come in a
  business of some moment.</p>

  <p>The taste of Cyprus was still in his mouth; the sweet sticky air of the
  coastlands; the smell of endless camps of packed humanity, set among
  mountains of barrels and malodorous sprouting forage-stuffs; the narrow
  streets lit at night by flares of tarry staves; and over all that rotting yet
  acrid flavour which is the token of the East. The young damoiseau of
  Beaumanoir had grown very sick of it all since the royal dromonds <a href=
  "#endnote17">[17]</a> first swung into Limasol Bay. He had seen his friends
  die like flies of strange maladies, while the host waited on Hugh of
  Burgundy. Egypt was but four days off across the waters, and on its sands
  Louis had ordained that the War of the Cross should begin.</p>

  <p>...  But the King seemed strangely supine. Each day the enemy was the
  better forewarned, and each day the quarrels of Templar and Hospitaller grew
  more envenomed, and yet he sat patiently twiddling his thumbs, as if all time
  lay before him and not a man's brief life. And now when at long last the
  laggards of Burgundy and the Morea were reported on their way, Sir Aimery had
  to turn his thoughts from the honest field of war. Not for him to cry
  Montjole St. Denis by the Nile. For behold he was now speeding on a crazy
  errand to the ends of the earth.</p>

  <p>There had been strange councils in the bare little chamber of the Most
  Christian King. Those locusts of the dawn whom men called Tartars, the evil
  seed of the Three Kings who had once travelled to Bethlehem, had, it seemed,
  been vouchsafed a glimpse of grace. True, they had plundered and eaten the
  faithful and shed innocent blood in oceans, but they hated the children of
  Mahound worse than the children of Christ. On the eve of Christmas-tide four
  envoys had come from their Khakan, monstrous men with big heads that sprang
  straight from the shoulder, and arms that hung below the knee, and short thin
  legs like gnomes. For forty weeks they had been on the road, and they brought
  gifts such as no eye had seen before&mdash;silks like gossamer woven with
  wild alphabets, sheeny jars of jade, and pearls like moons. Their Khakan,
  they said, had espoused the grandchild of Prester John, and had been baptised
  into the Faith. He marched against Baghdad, and had sworn to root the heresy
  of Mahound from the earth. Let the King of France make a league with him, and
  between them, pressing from east and west, they would accomplish the holy
  task. Let him send teachers to expound the mysteries of Cod, and let him send
  knights who would treat on mundane things. The letter, written in halting
  Latin and sealed with a device like a spider's web, urged instant warfare
  with Egypt. "For the present we dwell far apart," wrote the Khakan;
  "therefore let us both get to business. "</p>

  <p>So Aimery had been summoned to the King's chamber, where he found his good
  master, the Count of St. Pol, in attendance with others. After prayer, Louis
  opened to them his mind. Pale from much fasting and nightly communing with
  God, his face was lit again with that light which had shone in it when on the
  Friday after Pentecost the year before he had received at St. Denis the
  pilgrim's scarf and the oriflamme of France.</p>

  <p>"God's hand is in this, my masters," he said. "Is it not written that many
  shall come from the east and from the west to sit down with Abraham in his
  kingdom? I have a duty towards those poor folk, and I dare not fail."</p>

  <p>There was no man present bold enough to argue with the white fire in the
  King's eyes. One alone cavilled. He was a Scot, Sir Patrick, the Count of
  Dunbar, who already shook with the fever which was to be his death.</p>

  <p>"This Khakan is far away, sire," he said. "If it took his envoys forty
  weeks to reach us, it will be a good year before his armies are on the skirts
  of Egypt. As well make alliance with a star."</p>

  <p>But Louis was in missionary mood. "God's ways are not as our ways. To Him
  a thousand years are a day, and He can make the weakest confound a multitude.
  This far-away King asks for instruction, and I will send him holy men to
  fortify his young faith. And this knight, of whom you, my lord of St. Pol,
  speak well, shall bear the greetings of a soldier."</p>

  <p>Louis' face, which for usual was grave like a wise child's, broke into a
  smile which melted Aimery's heart. He scarcely heard the Count of St. Pol as
  that stout friend enlarged on his merits. "The knight of Beaumanoir," so ran
  the testimony, "has more learning than any clerk. In Spain he learned the
  tongues of the heathen, and in Paris he read deep in their philosophy. Withal
  he is a devout son of Holy Church."</p>

  <p>The boy blushed at the praise and the King's kindly regard. But St. Pol
  spoke truth, for Aimery, young as he was, had travelled far both on the
  material globe and in the kingdom of the spirit. As a stripling he had made
  one of the Picardy Nation in the schools of Paris. He had studied the
  metaphysics of Aristotle under Aquinas, and voyaged strange seas of thought
  piloted by Roger, the white-bearded Englishman. Thence, by the favour of the
  Queen-mother, he had gone as squire to Alphonso's court of Castile, where the
  Spanish doctors had opened windows for him into the clear dry wisdom of the
  Saracens. He had travelled with an embassy to the Emperor, and in Sicily had
  talked with the learned Arabs who clustered around the fantastic Frederick.
  In Italy he had met adventurers of Genoa and Venice who had shown him charts
  of unknown oceans and maps of Prester John's country and the desert roads
  that led to Cambaluc, that city farther than the moon, and told him tales of
  awful and delectable things hidden beyond the dawn. He had returned to his
  tower by the springs of Canche, a young man with a name for uncanny
  knowledge, a searcher after concealed matters, negligent of religion and ill
  at ease in his world.</p>

  <p>Then Louis cast his spell over him. He saw the King first at a great
  hunting in Avesnes and worshipped from afar the slight body, royal in every
  line of it, and the blue eyes which charmed and compelled, for he divined
  there a spirit which had the secret of both earth and heaven. While still
  under the glamour he was given knighthood at the royal hands, and presently
  was weaned from unwholesome fancies by falling in love. The girl, Alix of
  Val&eacute;ry, was slim like a poplar and her eyes were grey and deep as her
  northern waters. She had been a maid of Blanche the Queen, and had a nun's
  devoutness joined to a merry soul. Under her guiding Aimery made his peace
  with the Church, and became notable for his gifts to God, for he derived
  great wealth from his Flemish forbears. Yet the yeast of youth still wrought
  in him, and by Alix's side at night he dreamed of other lands than his
  grey-green Picardy. So, when the King took the <i>croix d'outre mer</i>
  <a href="#endnote18">[18]</a> and summoned his knights to the freeing of
  Jerusalem, Sir Aimery of Beaumanoir was the first to follow. For to him, as
  to others like him, the goal was no perishable city made by mortal hands, but
  that <i>beata urbs</i> <a href="#endnote19">[19]</a> without foundations
  which youth builds of its dreams.</p>

  <p>He heard mass by the King's side and, trembling with pride, kissed the
  royal hands and set out on his journey. His last memory of Louis was of a
  boyish figure in a surcoat of blue samite, gazing tenderly on him as of
  bidding farewell to a brother.</p>

  <p>The Grand Master of the Templars, sitting in a furred robe in a warm upper
  chamber, for he had an ague on him, spoke gloomily of the mission. He would
  have preferred to make alliance with the Soldan of Egypt, and by his aid
  recover the Holy Cities. "What Khakan is this?" he cried, "to whom it is a
  journey of a lifetime to come nigh? What kind of Christian will you make of
  men that have blood for drink and the flesh of babes for food, and blow
  hither and thither on horses like sandstorms? Yours is a mad venture, young
  sir, and I see no good that can come of it." Nevertheless he wrote letters of
  commendation to the Prince of Antioch and the Constable of Armenia; and he
  brought together all those about the place who had travelled far inland to
  make a chart of the journey.</p>

  <p>Aimery heeded little the Templar's forebodings, for his heart had grown
  high again and romance was kindling his fancy. There was a knuckle of caution
  in him, for he had the blood of Flemish traders in his veins, though enriched
  by many nobler streams. "The profit is certain," a cynic had whispered to him
  ere they left Aigues Mortes. "Should we conquer we shall grow rich, and if we
  fail we shall go to heaven." The phrase had fitted some of his moods, notably
  the black ones at Limasol, but now he was all aflame with the quixotry of the
  Crusader. He neither needed nor sought wealth, nor was he concerned about
  death. His feet trod the sacred soil of his faith, and up in the hills which
  rimmed the seaward plain lay all the holiness of Galilee and Nazareth, the
  three tabernacles built by St. Peter on the Mount of Transfiguration, the
  stone whence Christ ascended into heaven, the hut at Bethlehem which had been
  the Most High's cradle, the sanctuary of Jerusalem whose every stone was
  precious. Presently his King would win it all back for God. But for him was
  the sterner task&mdash;no clean blows in the mellay among brethren, but a
  lone pilgrimage beyond the east wind to the cradle of all marvels. The King
  had told him that he carried the hopes of Christendom in his wallet; he knew
  that he bore within himself the delirious expectation of a boy. Youth swelled
  his breast and steeled his sinews and made a golden mist for his eyes. The
  new, the outlandish, the undreamed-of!&mdash;Surely no one of the Seven
  Champions had had such fortune! Scribes long after would write of the deeds
  of Aimery of Beaumanoir, and minstrels would sing of him as they sang of
  Roland and Tristan.</p>

  <p>The Count of Jaffa, whose tower stood on the borders and who was therefore
  rarely quit of strife, convoyed him a stage or two on his way. It was a
  slender company: two Franciscans bearing the present of Louis to the
  Khakan&mdash;a chapel-tent of scarlet cloth embroidered inside with pictures
  of the Annunciation and the Passion; two sumpter mules with baggage; Aimery's
  squire, a lad from the Boulonnais; and Aimery himself mounted on a Barbary
  horse warranted to go far on little fodder. The lord of Jaffa turned back
  when the snows of Lebanon were falling behind on their right. He had nodded
  towards the mountains.</p>

  <p>"There lives the Old Man and his Ishmaelites. Fear nothing, for his fangs
  are drawn." And when Aimery asked the cause of the impotence of the renowned
  Assassins, he was told&mdash;"That Khakan whom ye seek."</p>

  <p>After that they made good speed to the city of Antioch, where not so long
  before angels from heaven had appeared as knights in white armour to do
  battle for the forlorn Crusaders. There they were welcomed by the Prince and
  sent forward into Armenia, guided by the posts of the Constable of that
  harassed kingdom. Everywhere the fame of the Tartars had gone abroad, and
  with each mile they journeyed the tales became stranger. Conquerors and
  warriors beyond doubt, but grotesque paladins for the Cross. Men whispered
  their name with averted faces, and in the eyes of the travelled ones there
  was the terror of sights remembered outside the mortal pale. Aimery's heart
  was stout, but he brooded much as the road climbed into the mountains. Far
  off in Cyprus the Khakan had seemed a humble devotee at Christ's footstool,
  asking only to serve and learn; but now he had grown to some monstrous
  Cyclops beyond the stature of man, a portent like a thundercloud brooding
  over unnumbered miles. Besides, the young lord was homesick, and had long
  thoughts of Alix his wife and the son she had borne him. As he looked at the
  stony hills he remembered that it would now be springtide in Picardy, when
  the young green of the willows fringed every watercourse and the plovers were
  calling on the windy downs.</p>

  <p>The Constable of Armenia dwelt in a castle of hewn stone about which a
  little city clustered, with mountains on every side to darken the sky, He was
  as swarthy as a Saracen and had a long nose like a Jew, but he was a good
  Christian and a wise ruler, though commonly at odds with his cousin of
  Antioch. From him Aimery had more precise news of the Khakan.</p>

  <p>There were two, said the Constable. "One who rules all Western Asia east
  of the Sultan's principates. Him they call the Ilkhan for title, and Houlagou
  for name. His armies have eaten up the Chorasmians and the Muscovites and
  will presently bite their way into Christendom, unless God change their
  heart. By the Gospels, they are less and more than men. Swinish drinkers and
  gluttons, they rise from their orgies to sweep the earth like a flame. Here
  inside our palisade of rock we wait fearfully."</p>

  <p>"And the other?" Aimery asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah, he is as much the greater as the sun is greater than a star. Kublai
  they name him, and he is in some sort the lord of Houlagou. I have never met
  the man who has seen him, for he dwells as far beyond the Ilkhan as the
  Ilkhan is far from the Pillars of Hercules. But rumour has it that he is a
  clement and beneficent prince, terrible in battle, but a lover of peace and
  all good men. They tell wonders about his land of Cathay, where strips of
  parchment stamped with the King's name take the place of gold among the
  merchants, so strong is that King's honour. But the journey to Cambaluc, the
  city of Kublai, would fill a man's lifetime."</p>

  <p>One April morning they heard mass after the odd Syrian fashion, and turned
  their faces eastward. The Constable's guides led them through the mountains,
  up long sword-cuts of valleys and under frowning snowdrifts, or across stony
  barrens where wretched beehive huts huddled by the shores of unquiet lakes.
  Presently they came into summer, and found meadows of young grass and green
  forests on the hills' skirts, and saw wide plains die into the blueness of
  morning. There the guides left them, and the little cavalcade moved east into
  unknown anarchies.</p>

  <p>The sky grew like brass over their heads, and the land baked and rutted
  with the sun's heat. It seemed a country empty of man, though sometimes they
  came on derelict ploughlands and towns of crumbling brick charred and glazed
  by fire. In sweltering days they struggled through flats where the grass was
  often higher than a horse's withers, and forded the tawny streams which
  brought down the snows of the hills. Now and then they would pass wandering
  herdsmen, who fled to some earth-burrow at their appearance. The Constable
  had bidden them make for the rising sun, saying that sooner or later they
  would foregather with the Khakan's scouts. But days passed into weeks and
  weeks into months, and still they moved through a tenantless waste. They
  husbanded jealously the food they had brought, but the store ran low, and
  there were days of empty stomachs and light heads. Unless, like the King of
  Babylon, they were to eat grass in the fashion of beasts, it seemed they must
  soon famish.</p>

  <p>But late in summertime they saw before them a wall of mountain, and in
  three days climbed by its defiles to a pleasant land, where once more they
  found the dwellings of man. It appeared that they were in a country where the
  Tartars had been for some time settled and which had for years been free of
  the ravages of war. The folks were hunters and shepherds who took the
  strangers for immortal beings and offered food on bent knees like oblations
  to a god. They knew where the Ilkhan dwelt, and furnished guides for each
  day's journey. Aimery, who had been sick of a low fever in the plains, and
  had stumbled on in a stupor torn by flashes of homesickness, found his
  spirits reviving. He had cursed many times the futility of his errand. While
  the Franciscans were busied with their punctual offices and asked nothing of
  each fresh day but that it should be as prayerful as the last, he found a
  rebellious unbelief rising in his heart. He was travelling roads no Christian
  had ever trod, on a wild-goose errand, while his comrades were winning fame
  in the battle-front. Alas! that a bright sword should rust in these
  barrens!</p>

  <p>But with the uplands peace crept into his soul and some of the mystery of
  his journey. It was a brave venture, whether it failed or no, for he had
  already gone beyond the pale even of men's dreams. The face of Louis hovered
  before him. It needed a great king even to conceive such a mission...  He had
  been sent on a king's errand too. He stood alone for France and the Cross in
  a dark world. Alone, as kings should stand, for to take all the burden was
  the mark of kingship. His heart bounded at the thought, for he was young. His
  father had told him of that old Flanders grandam, who had sworn that his
  blood came from proud kings.</p>

  <p>But chiefly he thought of Louis with a fresh warmth of love. Surely the
  King loved him, or he would not have chosen him out of many for this fateful
  work. He had asked of him the ultimate service, as a friend should. Aimery
  reconstructed in his inner vision all his memories of the King: the close
  fair hair now thinning about the temples; the small face still contoured like
  a boy's; the figure strung like a bow; the quick, eager gestures; the blue
  dove's eyes, kindly and humble, as became one whose proudest title was to be
  a "sergeant of the Crucified." But those same eyes could also steel and
  blaze, for his father had been called the Lion, his mother Semiramis, and his
  grandsire Augustus. In these wilds Aimery was his vicegerent and bore himself
  proudly as the proxy of such a monarch.</p>

  <p>The hour came when they met the Tartar outposts. A cloud of horse swept
  down on them, each man riding loose with his hand on a taut bowstring. In
  silence they surrounded the little party, and their leader made signs to
  Aimery to dismount. The Constable had procured for him a letter in Tartar
  script, setting out the purpose of his mission. This the outpost could not
  read, but they recognised some word among the characters, and pointed it out
  to each other with uncouth murmurings. They were strange folk, with eyes like
  pebbles and squat frames and short, broad faces, but each horse and man moved
  in unison like a centaur.</p>

  <p>With gestures of respect the Tartars signalled to the Christians to
  follow, and led them for a day and a night southward down a broad valley,
  where vines and fruit trees grew and peace dwelt in villages. They passed
  encampments of riders like themselves, and little scurries of horsemen would
  ride athwart their road and exchange greetings. On the second morning they
  reached a city, populous in men but not in houses. For miles stretched lines
  of skin tents, and in the heart of them by the river's edge stood a great
  hall of brick, still raw from the builders.</p>

  <p>Aimery sat erect on his weary horse with the hum of an outlandish host
  about him, himself very weary and very sick at heart. For the utter folly of
  it all had come on him like the waking from a dream. These men were no allies
  of the West. They were children of the Blue Wolf, as the Constable had said,
  a monstrous brood, swarming from the unknown to blight the gardens of the
  world. A Saracen compared to such was a courteous knight...  He thought of
  Kublai, the greater Khakan. Perhaps in his court might dwell gentlehood and
  reason. But here was but a wolf pack in the faraway guise of man.</p>

  <p>They gave the strangers food and drink&mdash;half-cooked fish and a
  porridge of rye and sour spiced milk, and left them to sleep until sundown.
  Then the palace guards led them to the presence.</p>

  <p>The hall was immense, dim and shapeless like the inside of a hill, not
  built according to the proportions of mankind. Flambeaux and wicks floating
  in great basins of mutton fat showed a dense concourse of warriors, and
  through an aisle of them Aimery approached the throne. In front stood a tree
  of silver, springing from a pedestal of four lions whose mouths poured
  streams of wine, syrup, and mead into basins, which were emptied by a host of
  slaves, the cup-bearers of the assembly. There were two thrones side by side,
  on one of which sat a figure so motionless that it might have been wrought of
  jasper. Weighted with a massive head-dress of pearls and a robe of gold
  brocade, the little grandchild of Prester John seemed like a doll on which
  some princess had lavished wealth and fancy. The black eyelashes lay quiet on
  her olive cheeks, and her breathing did not stir her stiff, jewelled
  bodice.</p>

  <p>"I have seen death in life," thought Aimery as he shivered and looked
  aside.</p>

  <p>Houlagou, her husband, was a tall man compared with the others. His face
  was hairless, and his mouth fine and cruel. His eyes were hard like agates,
  with no light in them. A passionless power lurked in the low broad forehead,
  and the mighty head sunk deep between the shoulders; but the power not of a
  man, but of some abortion of nature, like storm or earthquake. Again Aimery
  shivered. Had not the prophets foretold that one day Antichrist would be
  reborn in Babylon?</p>

  <p>Among the Ilkhan's scribes was a Greek who spoke a bastard French and
  acted as interpreter. King Louis' letter was read, and in that hall its
  devout phrases seemed a mockery. The royal gifts were produced, the
  tent-chapel with its woven pictures and the sacred utensils. The half-drunk
  captains fingered them curiously, but the eyes from the throne scarcely
  regarded them.</p>

  <p>"These are your priests," said the Khakan "Let them talk with my priests
  and then go their own way. I have little concern with priestcraft."</p>

  <p>Then Aimery spoke, and the Greek with many haltings translated. He
  reminded Houlagou of the Tartar envoys who had sought from his King
  instruction in the Christian faith and had proclaimed his baptism.</p>

  <p>"Of that I know nothing," was the answer. "Maybe 'twas some whim of my
  brother Kublai. I have all the gods I need."</p>

  <p>With a heavy heart Aimery touched on the proposed alliance, the advance on
  Baghdad, and the pinning of the Saracens between two fires. He spoke as he
  had been ordered, but with a bitter sense of futility, for what kind of ally
  could be looked for in this proud pagan?</p>

  <p>The impassive face showed no flicker of interest.</p>

  <p>"I am eating up the Caliphs," he said, "but that food is for my own table.
  As for allies, I have need of none. The children of the Blue Wolf do not make
  treaties."</p>

  <p>Then he spoke aside to his captains, and fixed Aimery with his agate eyes.
  It was like listening to a voice from a stone.</p>

  <p>"The King of France has sent you to ask for peace. Peace, no doubt, is
  good, and I will grant it of my favour. A tribute will be fixed in gold and
  silver, and while it is duly paid your King's lands will be safe from my
  warriors. Should the tribute fail, France will be ours. I have heard that it
  is a pleasant place."</p>

  <p>The Ilkhan signed that the audience was over. The fountains of liquor
  ceased to play, and the drunken gathering stood up with a howling like wild
  beasts to acclaim their King. Aimery went back to his hut, and sat deep in
  thought far into the night.</p>

  <p>He perceived that the shadows were closing in upon him. He must get the
  friars away, and with them a message to his master. For himself there could
  be no return, for he could not shame his King who had trusted him. In the
  bestial twilight of this barbaric court the memory of Louis shone like a
  star. He must attempt to reach Kublai, of whom men spoke well, though the
  journey cost him his youth and his life. It might mean years of wandering,
  but there was a spark of hope in it. There, in the bleak hut, he suffered the
  extreme of mental anguish A heavy door seemed to have closed between him and
  all that he held dear. He fell on his knees and prayed to the saints to
  support his loneliness. And then he found comfort, for had not God's Son
  suffered even as he, and left the bright streets of Paradise for loneliness
  among the lost?</p>

  <p>Next morning he faced the world with a clearer eye. It was not difficult
  to provide for the Franciscans. They, honest men, understood nothing save
  that the Tartar king had not the love of holy things for which they had
  hoped. They explained the offices of the Church as well as they could to
  ribald and uncomprehending auditors, and continued placidly in their
  devotions. As it chanced, a convoy was about to start for Muscovy, whence by
  ship they might come to Constantinople. The Tartars made no objection to
  their journey, for they had some awe of these pale men and were glad to be
  quit of foreign priestcraft. With them Aimery sent a letter in which he told
  the King that the immediate errand had been done. but that no good could be
  looked for from this western Khakan. "I go," he said," to Kublai the Great,
  in Cathay, who has a heart more open to God. If I return not, know, Sire,
  that I am dead in your most loving service, joyfully and pridefully as a
  Christian knight dies for the Cross, his King, and his lady." He added some
  prayers on behalf of the little household at Beaumanoir and sealed it with
  his ring. It was the ring he had got from his father, a thick gold thing in
  which had been cut his cognisance of three lions' heads.</p>

  <p>This done, he sought an audience with the Ilkhan, and told him of his
  purpose. Houlagou did not speak for a little, and into his set face seemed to
  creep an ill-boding shadow of a smile. "Who am I," he said at length, "to
  hinder your going to my brother Kublai? I will give you an escort to my
  eastern borders."</p>

  <p>Aimery bent his knee and thanked him, but from the courtiers rose a hubbub
  of mirth which chilled his gratitude. He was aware that he sailed on very
  desperate waters.</p>

  <p>Among the Tartars was a recreant Genoese who taught them metal work and
  had once lived at the court of Cambaluc. The man had glimmerings of honesty,
  and tried hard to dissuade Aimery from the journey. "It is a matter of
  years," he told him, "and the road leads through deserts greater than all
  Europe and over mountains so high and icy that birds are frozen in the
  crossing. And a word in your ear, my lord. The Ilkhan permits few to cross
  his eastern marches. Beware of treason, I say. Your companions are the
  blood-thirstiest of the royal guards."</p>

  <p>But from the Genoese he obtained a plan of the first stages of the road,
  and one morning in autumn he set out from the Tartar city, his squire from
  the Boulonnais by his side, and at his back a wild motley of horsemen,
  wearing cuirasses of red leather stamped with the blue wolf of Houlagou's
  house.</p>

  <p>October fell chill and early in those uplands, and on the fourth day they
  came into a sprinkling of snow. At night round the fires the Tartars made
  merry, for they bad strong drink in many skin bottles, and Aimery was left to
  his own cold meditations. If he had had any hope, it was gone now, for the
  escort made it clear that he was their prisoner Judging from the chart of the
  Genoese, they were not following any road to Cambaluc, and the sight of the
  sky told him that they were circling round to the south. The few Tartar words
  he had learned were not enough to communicate with them, and in any case it
  was clear that they would take no orders from him. He was trapped like a bird
  in the fowler's hands. Escape was folly, for in an hour their swift horses
  would have ridden him down. He had thought he had grown old, but the
  indignity woke his youth again, and he fretted passionately. If death was his
  portion, he longed for it to come cleanly in soldier fashion.</p>

  <p>One night his squire disappeared. The Tartars, when he tried to question
  them, only laughed and pointed westward. That was the last he heard of the
  lad from the Boulonnais.</p>

  <p>And then on a frosty dawn, when the sun rose red-rimmed over the barrens,
  he noted a new trimness in his escort. They rode in line, and they rode
  before and behind him, so that his captivity was made patent. On a ridge far
  to the west he saw a great castle, and he knew the palace of Houlagou. His
  guess had been right; he had been brought back by a circuit to his
  starting-point.</p>

  <p>Presently he was face to face with the Ilkhan, who was hunting. The Greek
  scribe was with him, so the meeting had been foreseen. The King's face was
  dark with the weather and his stony eyes had a glow in them.</p>

  <p>"O messenger of France," he said, "there is a little custom of our people
  that I had forgotten. When a stranger warrior visits us it is our fashion to
  pit him in a bout against one of our own folk, so that if he leaves us alive
  he may speak well of his entertainment."</p>

  <p>"I am willing," said Aimery. "I have but my sword for weapon."</p>

  <p>"We have no lack of swordsmen," said the Ilkhan. "I would fain see the
  Frankish way of it."</p>

  <p>A man stepped out from the ring, a great square fellow shorter by a head
  than Aimery, and with a nose that showed there was Saracen blood in him. He
  had a heavy German blade, better suited for fighting on horseback than on
  foot. He had no buckler, and no armour save a headpiece, so the combatants
  were fairly matched.</p>

  <p>It was a contest of speed and deftness against a giant's strength, for a
  blow from the great weapon would have cut deep into a man's vitals. Aimery
  was weary and unpractised, but the clash of steel gave life to him. He found
  that he had a formidable foe, but one who lacked the finer arts of the
  swordsman. The Tartar wasted his strength in the air against the new French
  parries and guards, though he drew first blood and gashed his opponent's left
  arm. Aimery's light blade dazzled his eyes, and presently when breath had
  grown short claimed its due. A deft cut on the shoulder paralysed the
  Tartar's sword arm, and a breaststroke brought him to his knees.</p>

  <p>"Finish him," said the Ilkhan.</p>

  <p>"Nay, sire," said Aimery, "it is not our custom to slay a disabled
  foe."</p>

  <p>Houlagou nodded to one of his guards, who advanced swinging his sword. The
  defeated man seemed to know his fate, and stretched out his neck. With a
  single blow his head rolled on the earth.</p>

  <p>"You have some skill of the sword, Frenchman," said the Ilkhan. "Hear,
  now, what I have decreed concerning you. I will have none of this journey to
  my brother Kublai. I had purposed to slay you, for you have defied my
  majesty. You sought to travel to Cathay instead of bearing my commands
  forthwith to your little King. But I am loath to kill so stout a warrior.
  Swear to me allegiance, and you shall ride with me against the Caliphs."</p>

  <p>"And if I refuse?" Aimery asked.</p>

  <p>"Then you die ere sundown."</p>

  <p>"I am an envoy, sire, from a brother majesty, and of such it is the custom
  to respect the persons."</p>

  <p>"Tush!" said the Ilkhan, "there is no brother majesty save Kublai. Between
  us we rule the world."</p>

  <p>"Hear me, then," said Aimery. The duel had swept all cobwebs from his
  brain and doubts from his heart. "I am a knight of the Sire Christ and of the
  most noble King Louis, and I can own no other lord. Do your work, King. I am
  solitary among your myriads, but you cannot bend me."</p>

  <p>"So be it," said Houlagou.</p>

  <p>"I ask two boons as one about to die. Let me fall in battle against your
  warriors. And let me spend the hours till sundown alone, for I would prepare
  myself for my journey."</p>

  <p>"So be it," said Houlagou, and turned to his hounds.</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p><br>

  <p>The damoiseau of Beaumanoir sat on a ridge commanding for fifty miles the
  snow-sprinkled uplands. The hum of the Tartars came faint from a hollow to
  the west, but where he sat he was in quiet and alone.</p>

  <p>He had forgotten the ache of loss which had preyed on him...  His youth
  had not been squandered. The joy of young manhood which had been always like
  a tune in his heart had risen to a nobler song. For now, as it seemed to him,
  he stood beside his King, and had found a throne in the desert. Alone among
  all Christian men he had carried the Cross to a new world, and had been
  judged worthy to walk in the footprints of his captain Christ. A great
  gladness and a great humility possessed him.</p>

  <p>He had ridden beyond the ken of his own folk, and no tale of his end would
  ever be told in that northern hall of his when the hearth-fire flickered on
  the rafters. That seemed small loss, for they would know that he had ridden
  the King's path, and that can have but the one ending...  Most clear in his
  memory now were the grey towers by Canche, where all day long the slow river
  made a singing among the reeds. He saw Alix his wife, the sun on her hair,
  playing in the close with his little Philip. Even now in the pleasant autumn
  weather that curly-pate would be scrambling in the orchard for the ripe
  apples which his mother rolled to him. He had thought himself born for a high
  destiny. Well, that destiny had been accomplished. He would not die, but live
  in the son of his body, and his sacrifice would be eternally a spirit moving
  in the hearts of his seed. He saw the thing clear and sharp, as if in a magic
  glass. There was a long road before the house of Beaumanoir, and on the
  extreme horizon a great brightness.</p>

  <p>Now he remembered that he had always known it, known it even when his head
  had been busy with ardent hopes. He had loved life and had won life
  everlasting. He had known it when he sought learning from wise books. When he
  kept watch by his armour in the Abbey church of Corbie and questioned
  wistfully the darkness, that was the answer he had got. In the morning, when
  he had knelt in snow-white linen and crimson and steel before the high altar
  and received back his sword from God, the message had been whispered to his
  heart. In the June dawn when, barefoot, he was given the pilgrim's staff and
  entered on his southern journey, he had had a premonition of his goal. But
  now what had been dim, like a shadow in a mirror, was as clear as the colours
  in a painted psaltery. "Jerusalem, Jerusalem," he sighed, as his King was
  wont to sigh. For he was crossing the ramparts of the secret city.</p>

  <p>He tried to take the ring from his finger that he might bury it, for it
  irked him that his father's jewel should fall to his enemies. But the wound
  had swollen his left hand, and he could not move the ring.</p>

  <p>He was looking westward, for that way lay the Holy Places, and likewise
  Alix and Picardy. His minutes were few now, for he heard the bridles of the
  guards, as they closed in to carry him to his last fight...  He had with him
  a fragment of rye-cake and beside him on the ridge was a little spring. In
  his helmet he filled a draught, and ate a morsel. For, by the grace of the
  Church to the knight in extremity, he was now sealed of the priesthood, and
  partook of the mystic body and blood of his Lord... </p>

  <p>Somewhere far off there was a grass fire licking the hills, and the sun
  was setting in fierce scarlet and gold. The hollow of the sky seemed a vast
  chapel ablaze with lights, like the lifting of the Host at Candlemas.</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p><br>

  <p>The tale is not finished. For, as it chanced, one Maffeo of Venice, a
  merchant who had strayed to the court of Cambaluc and found favour there, was
  sent by Kublai the next year on a mission to Europe, and his way lay through
  the camp of Houlagou. He was received with honour, and shown the riches of
  the Tartar armies. Among other things he heard of a Frankish knight who had
  fallen in battle with Houlagou's champions, and won much honour, they said,
  having slain three. He was shown the shrivelled arm of this knight, with a
  gold ring on the third finger. Maffeo was a man of sentiment, and begged for
  and was given the poor fragment, meaning to accord it burial in consecrated
  ground when he should arrive in Europe. He travelled to Bussorah, whence he
  came by sea to Venice. Now at Venice there presently arrived the Count of St.
  Pol with a company of Frenchmen, bound on a mission to the Emperor. Maffeo,
  of whom one may still read in the book of Messer Marco Polo, was become a
  famous man in the city, and strangers resorted to his house to hear his tales
  and see his treasures. From him St. Pol learned of the dead knight, and,
  reading the cognisance on the ring, knew the fate of his friend. On his
  return journey he bore the relic to Louis at Paris, who venerated it as the
  limb of a saint; and thereafter took it to Beaumanoir, where the Lady Alix
  kissed it with proud tears. The arm in a rich casket she buried below the
  chapel altar, and the ring she wore till her death.</p><br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref6"
     id="ref6"></a>CHAPTER 5</h3>

  <h2>THE MAID</h2>

  <p>The hostel of the &Acirc;ne Ray&eacute; poured from its upper and lower
  windows a flood of light into the gathering August dusk. It stood, a little
  withdrawn among its beeches, at a cross-roads, where the main route southward
  from the Valois cut the highway from Paris to Rheims and Champagne. The roads
  at that hour made ghostly white ribbons, and the fore-court of dusty grasses
  seemed of a verdure which daylight would disprove. Weary horses nuzzled at a
  water-trough, and serving-men in a dozen liveries made a bustle around the
  stables, which formed two sides of the open quadrangle. At the foot of the
  inn signpost beggars squatted&mdash;here a leper whining monotonously, there
  lustier vagrants dicing for supper. At the main door a knot of young squires
  stood talking in whispers&mdash;impatient, if one judged from the restless
  clank of metal, but on duty, as appeared when a new-comer sought entrance and
  was brusquely denied. For in an upper room there was business of great folk,
  and the commonalty must keep its distance.</p>

  <p>That upper room was long and low-ceiled, with a canopied bed in a corner
  and an oaken table heaped with saddle-bags. A woman sat in a chair by the
  empty hearth, very bright and clear in the glow of the big iron lantern hung
  above the chimney. She was a tall girl, exquisitely dressed, from the fine
  silk of her horned cap to the amethyst buckles on her Spanish shoes. The
  saddle-bags showed that she was fresh from a journey, but her tirewoman's
  hands must have been busy, for she bore no marks of the road.</p>

  <p>Her chin was in her hands, and the face defined by the slim fingers was
  small and delicate, pale with the clear pallor of perfect health, and now
  slowly flushing to some emotion. The little chin was firm, but the mouth was
  pettish. Her teeth bit on a gold chain, which encircled her neck and held a
  crystal reliquary. A spoiled pretty child, she looked, and in a mighty ill
  temper.</p>

  <p>The cause of it was a young man who stood disconsolately by a settle a
  little way out of the lantern's glow. The dust of the white roads lay on his
  body-armour and coated the scabbard of his great sword. He played nervously
  with the plume of a helmet which lay on the settle, and lifted his face now
  and then to protest a word. It was an honest face, ruddy with wind and sun
  and thatched with hair which his mislikers called red but his friends
  golden.</p>

  <p>The girl seemed to have had her say. She turned wearily aside, and drew
  the chain between her young lips with a gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>"Since when have you become Burgundian, Catherine?" the young man asked
  timidly. The Sieur Guy de Laval was most notable in the field but he had few
  arts for a lady's chamber.</p>

  <p>"I am no Burgundian," she said, "but neither am I Armagnac. What concern
  have we in these quarrels? Let the Kings who seek thrones do the fighting.
  What matters it to us whether knock-kneed Charles or fat Philip reign in
  Paris?"</p>

  <p>The young man shuddered as if at a blasphemy "This is our country of
  France. I would rid it of the English and all foreign bloodsuckers "</p>

  <p>"And your way is to foment the quarrel among Frenchmen? You are a fool,
  Guy. Make peace with Burgundy and in a month there will be no Goddams left in
  France."</p>

  <p>"It is the voice of La Tremouille."</p>

  <p>"It is the voice of myself, Catherine of Beaumanoir. And if my kinsman of
  La Tremouille say the same, the opinion is none the worse for that. You
  meddle with matters beyond your understanding...  But have done with
  statecraft, for that is not the heart of my complaint. You have broken your
  pledged word, sir. Did you not promise me when you set out that you would
  abide the issue of the Bourbon's battle before you took arms? Yet I have
  heard of you swashbuckling in that very fight at Rouvray, and only the
  miracle of God brought you out with an unbroken neck."</p>

  <p>"The Bourbon never fought," said de Laval sullenly. "Only Stewart and his
  Scots stood up against Fastolf's spears. You would not have me stay idle in
  face of such odds. I was not the only French knight who charged. There was La
  Hire and de Saintrailles and the Bastard himself."</p>

  <p>"Yet you broke your word," was the girl's cold answer. "Your word to me.
  You are forsworn, sir."</p>

  <p>The boy's face flushed deeply. "You do not understand, my sweet Catherine.
  There have been mighty doings in Touraine, which you have not heard of in
  Picardy. Miracles have come to pass. Orleans has been saved, and there is now
  a great army behind Charles. In a little while we shall drive the English
  from Paris, and presently into the sea. There is hope now and a clear road
  for us Frenchmen. We have heard the terrible English 'Hurra' grow feeble, and
  'St. Denis' swell like a wind in heaven. For God has sent us the Maid
 ... "</p>

  <p>The girl had risen and was walking with quick, short steps from hearth to
  open window.</p>

  <p>"Tell me of this maid," she commanded.</p>

  <p>"Beyond doubt she is a daughter of God," said de Laval.</p>

  <p>"Beyond doubt. But I would hear more of her."</p>

  <p>Her tone was ominously soft, and the young man was deceived by it. He
  launched into a fervid panegyric of Jeanne of Arc. He told of her doings at
  Orleans, when her standard became the oriflamme of France, and her voice was
  more stirring than trumpets; of her gentleness and her wisdom. He told of his
  first meeting with her, when she welcomed him in her chamber. "She sent for
  wine and said that soon she would drink it with me in Paris. I saw her mount
  a plunging black horse, herself all in white armour, but unhelmeted. Her eyes
  were those of a great captain, and yet merciful and mild like God's Mother.
  The sight of her made the heart sing like a May morning. No man could fear
  death in her company. They tell how... "</p>

  <p>But he got no farther. The girl's face was pale with fury, and she tore at
  her gold neck-chain till it snapped.</p>

  <p>"Enough of your maid!" she cried. "Maid, forsooth! The shame of her has
  gone throughout the land. She is no maid, but a witch, a light-of-love, a
  blasphemer. By the Rood, Sir Guy, you choose this instant between me and your
  foul peasant. A daughter of Beaumanoir does not share her lover with a
  crack-brained virago."</p>

  <p>The young man had also gone pale beneath his sunburn. "I will not listen,"
  he cried. "You blaspheme a holy angel."</p>

  <p>"But listen you shall," and her voice quivered with passion. She marched
  up to him and faced him, her slim figure as stiff as a spear. "This very hour
  you break this mad allegiance and conduct me home to Beaumanoir. Or, by the
  Sorrows of Mary, you and I will never meet again."</p>

  <p>De Laval did not speak, but stood gazing sadly at the angry loveliness
  before him. His own face had grown as stubborn as hers.</p>

  <p>"You do not know what you ask," he said at length. "You would have me
  forswear my God, and my King, and my manhood."</p>

  <p>"A fig for such manhood," she cried with ringing scorn. "If that is a
  man's devotion, I will end my days in a nunnery. I will have none of it, I
  tell you. Choose, my fine lover choose between me and your peasant."</p>

  <p>The young man looked again at the blazing eyes and then without a word
  turned slowly and left the room. A moment later the sound of horses told that
  a company had taken the road</p>

  <p>The girl stood listening till the noise died away. Then she sank all limp
  in a chair and began to cry. There was wrath in her sobs, and bitter
  self-pity. She had made a fine tragedy scene, but the glory of it was short.
  She did not regret it, but an immense dreariness had followed on her heroics.
  Was there ever, she asked herself, a more unfortunate lady?</p>

  <p>And she had been so happy. Her lover was the bravest gallant that ever
  came out of Brittany; rich too, and well beloved, and kin to de Richemont,
  the Constable. In the happy days at Beaumanoir he was the leader in jousts
  and valiances, the soul of hunting parties, the lightest foot in the dance.
  The Beaumanoirs had been a sleepy stock, ever since that Sir Aimery, long
  ago, who had gone crusading with Saint Louis and ridden out of the ken of
  mortals. Their wealth had bought them peace, and they had kept on good terms
  alike with France and Burgundy, and even with the unruly captains of England.
  Wars might sweep round their marches, but their fields were unravaged.
  Shrewd, peaceable folk they were, at least the males of the house. The women
  had been different, for the daughters of Beaumanoir had been notable for
  beauty and wit and had married proudly, till the family was kin to half the
  nobleness of Artois and Picardy and Champagne. There was that terrible
  great-aunt at Coucy, and the aunts at Beaulieu and Avranches, and the endless
  cousinhood stretching as far south as the Nivernais...  And now the main
  stock had flowered in her, the sole child of her father, and the best match
  to be found that side of the Loire.</p>

  <p>She sobbed in the chagrin of a new experience. No one in her soft
  cushioned life had ever dared to gainsay her. At Beaumanoir her word was law.
  She had loved its rich idleness for the power it gave her. Luxurious as she
  was, it was no passive luxury that she craved, but the sense of mastery, of
  being a rare thing set apart. The spirit of the women of Beaumanoir burned
  fiercely in her...  She longed to set her lover in the forefront of the
  world. Let him crusade if he chose, but not in a beggars' quarrel. And now
  the palace of glass was shivered, and she was forsaken for a peasant beguine.
  The thought set her pacing to the window.</p>

  <p>There seemed to be a great to-do without. A dozen lanterns lit up the
  forecourt, and there was a tramping of many horses. A shouting, too, as if a
  king were on the move. She hurriedly dried her eyes and arranged her dress,
  tossing the reliquary and its broken chain on the table. Some new guests; and
  the inn was none too large. She would have the landlord flayed if he dared to
  intrude on the privacy which she had commanded. Nay, she would summon her
  people that instant and set off for home, for her company was strong enough
  to give security in the midnight forests.</p>

  <p>She was about to blow a little silver whistle to call her steward when a
  step at the door halted her. A figure entered, a stranger. It was a tall
  stripling, half armed like one who is not for battle but expects a brush at
  any corner of the road. A long surcoat of dark green and crimson fell stiffly
  as if it covered metal, and the boots were spurred and defended in front with
  thin plates of steel. The light helm was open and showed a young face. The
  stranger moved wearily as if from a long journey.</p>

  <p>"Good even to you, sister," said the voice, a musical voice with the broad
  accent of Lorraine. "Help me to get rid of this weariful harness."</p>

  <p>Catherine's annoyance was forgotten in amazement. Before she knew what she
  did her fingers were helping the bold youth to disarm. The helm was removed,
  the surcoat was stripped, and the steel corslet beneath it. With a merry
  laugh the stranger kicked off the great boots which were too wide for his
  slim legs.</p>

  <p>He stretched himself, yawning, and then laughed again. "By my staff," he
  said, "but I am the weary one." He stood now in the full glow of the lantern,
  and Catherine saw that he wore close-fitting breeches of fine linen, a dark
  pourpoint <a href="#endnote20">[20]</a> , and a tunic of blue. The black hair
  was cut short like a soldier's, and the small secret face had the clear tan
  of one much abroad in wind and sun. The eyes were tired and yet merry, great
  grey eyes as clear and deep as a moorland lake...  Suddenly she understood.
  It may have been the sight of the full laughing lips, or the small maidenly
  breasts outlined by the close-fitting linen. At any rate she did not draw
  back when the stranger kissed her cheek.</p>

  <p>"Ah, now I am woman again," said the crooning voice. The unbuckled sword
  in its leather sheath was laid on the table beside the broken reliquary. "Let
  us rest side by side, sister, for I long for maids' talk."</p>

  <p>But now Catherine started and recoiled. For on the blue tunic she had
  caught sight of an embroidered white dove bearing in its beak the scroll De
  par le Roy du ciel. It was a blazon the tale of which had gone through
  France.</p>

  <p>"You are she!" she stammered. "The witch of Lorraine!"</p>

  <p>The other looked wonderingly at her. "I am Jeanne of Arc," she said
  simply. "She whom they call the Pucelle. Do you shrink from me, sister?"</p>

  <p>Catherine's face was aflame. She remembered her lost lover, and the tears
  scarcely dry. "Out upon you!" she cried. "You are that false woman that
  corrupt men's hearts." And again her fingers sought the silver whistle.</p>

  <p>Jeanne looked sadly upon her. Her merry eyes had grown grave.</p>

  <p>"I pray you forbear. I do not heed the abuse of men, but a woman's taunts
  hurt me. They have spoken falsely of me, dear sister. I am no witch, but a
  poor girl who would fain do the commands of God."</p>

  <p>She sank on the settle with the relaxed limbs of utter fatigue. "I was
  happy when they told me there was a lady here. I bade Louis and Raymond and
  the Sieur d'Aulon leave me undisturbed till morning, for I would fain rest.
  Oh, but I am weary of councils! They are all blind. They will not hear the
  plain wishes of God...  And I have so short a time! Only a year, and now half
  is gone!"</p>

  <p>The figure had lost all its buoyancy, and become that of a sad,
  overwrought girl. Catherine found her anger ebbing and pity stealing into her
  heart. Could this tired child be the virago against whom she had sworn
  vengeance? It had none of a woman's allure' no arts of the light-of-love. Its
  eyes were as simple as a boy's...  She looked almost kindly at the drooping
  Maid.</p>

  <p>But in a moment the languor seemed to pass from her. Her face lit up, as
  to the watcher in the darkness a window in a tower suddenly becomes a square
  of light. She sank on her knees, her head thrown back, her lips parted, the
  long eyelashes quiet on her cheeks. A sudden stillness seemed to fall on
  everything. Catherine held her breath, and listened to the beating of her
  heart.</p>

  <p>Jeanne's lips moved, and then her eyes opened. She stood up again, her
  face entranced and her gaze still dwelling on some hidden world...  Never had
  Catherine seen such happy radiance.</p>

  <p>"My Brothers of Paradise spoke with me. They call me sometimes when I am
  sad. Their voices said to me, 'Daughter of God, go forward. We are at your
  side.'"</p>

  <p>Catherine trembled. She seemed on the edge of a world of which in all her
  cosseted life she had never dreamed, a world of beautiful and terrible
  things. There was rapture in it, and a great awe. She had forgotten her
  grievances in wonder.</p>

  <p>"Do not shrink from me," said the voice which seemed to have won an
  unearthly sweetness. "Let us sit together and tell our thoughts. You are very
  fair. Have you a lover?"</p>

  <p>The word brought the girl to earth. "I had a lover, but this night I
  dismissed him. He fights in your company, and I see no need for this
  war."</p>

  <p>Jeanne's voice was puzzled. "Can a man fight in a holier cause than to
  free his country?"</p>

  <p>"The country... " But Catherine faltered. Her argument with Guy now seemed
  only pettishness.</p>

  <p>"You are a great lady," said Jeanne, "and to such as you liberty may seem
  a little thing. You are so rich that you need never feel constraint. But to
  us poor folk freedom is life itself. It sweetens the hind's pottage, and
  gives the meanest an assurance of manhood...  Likewise it is God's will. My
  Holy Ones have told me that sweet France shall be purged from bondage. They
  have bidden me see the King crowned and lead him to Paris...  After that they
  have promised me rest."</p>

  <p>She laid an arm round Catherine's neck and looked into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are hungry, sister mine," she said.</p>

  <p>The girl started. For the eyes were no longer those of a boy, but of a
  mother&mdash;very wise, very tender. Her own mother had died so long ago that
  she scarcely remembered her. A rush of longing came over her for something
  she had never known. She wanted to lay her head on that young breast and
  weep.</p>

  <p>"You are hungry&mdash;and yet I think you have been much smiled on by
  fortune. You are very fair, and for most women to be beautiful is to be
  happy. But you are not content, and I am glad of it. There is a hunger that
  is divine... "</p>

  <p>She broke off, for the girl was sobbing. Crumpled on the floor, she bent
  her proud head to the Maid's lap "What must I do?" she cried piteously. "The
  sight of you makes me feel my rottenness. I have been proud of worthless
  things and I have cherished that wicked pride that I might forget the doubts
  knocking on my heart. You say true, I am not content. I shall never be
  content, I am most malcontent with myself...  Would to God that like you I
  had been born a peasant!"</p>

  <p>The tragic eyes looked up to find the Maid laughing&mdash;a kind, gentle
  merriment. Catherine flushed as Jeanne took her tear-stained face in her
  hands.</p>

  <p>"You are foolish, little sister. I would I had been born to your station.
  My task would have been easier had I been Yoland of Sicily or that daughter
  of the King of Scots from whom many looked for the succour of France. Folly,
  folly! There is no virtue in humble blood. I would I had been a queen! I love
  fine clothes and rich trappings and the great horse which d'Alen&ccedil;on
  gave me. God has made a brave world and I would that all His people could get
  the joy of it. I love it the more because I have only a little time in
  it."</p>

  <p>"But you are happy," said the girl, "and I want such happiness."</p>

  <p>"There is no happiness," said the Maid, "save in doing the will of God our
  Father."</p>

  <p>"But I do not know His will...  I am resolved now. I will take the vows
  and become a religious, and then I shall find peace. I am weary of all this
  confusing world."</p>

  <p>"Foolish one," and Jeanne played with the little curls which strayed
  around Catherine's ear. "You were not born for a nunnery. Not that way God
  calls you."</p>

  <p>"Show me His way," the girl implored. "He shows His way privily to each
  heart, and His ways are many. For some the life of devout contemplation, but
  not for you, sister. Your blood is too fiery and your heart too passionate
 ...  You have a lover? Tell me his name.</p>

  <p>Docilely Catherine whispered it, and Jeanne laughed merrily.</p>

  <p>"Sir Guy! My most loyal champion. By my staff, you are the blessed maid.
  There is no more joyous knight in all the fields of France."</p>

  <p>"I do not seek wedlock. Oh, it is well for you who are leading armies and
  doing the commands of God. Something tells me that in marriage I shall lose
  my soul."</p>

  <p>The girl was on her knees with her hands twined. "Let me follow you," she
  cried. "I will bring a stout company behind me. Let me ride with you to the
  freeing of France. I promise to be stalwart."</p>

  <p>The Maid shook her head gently.</p>

  <p>"Then I take the vows." The obstinate little mouth had shut and there were
  no tears now in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"Listen, child," and Jeanne took the suppliant hands in hers. "It is true
  that God has called me to a holy task. He has sent His angels to guide me and
  they talk with me often. The Lady of Fierbois has given me a mystic sword. I
  think that in a little while this land will be free again...  But I shall not
  see it, for God's promise is clear, and for me it does not give length of
  days. I did not seek this errand of mine. I resisted the command, till God
  was stern with me and I submitted with bitter tears. I shall die a maid, and
  can never know the blessedness of women. Often at night I weep to think that
  I shall never hold a babe next my heart."</p>

  <p>The face of Jeanne was suddenly strained with a great sadness. It was
  Catherine's turn to be the comforter. She sat herself beside her and drew her
  head to her breast.</p>

  <p>"For you I see a happier fate&mdash;a true man's wife&mdash;the mother of
  sons. Bethink you of the blessedness. Every wife is like the Mother of
  God&mdash;she has the hope of bearing a saviour of mankind. She is the
  channel of the eternal purpose of Heaven. Could I change&mdash;could I
  change! What fortunate wife would envy a poor maid that dwells in the glare
  of battle?...  Nay, I do not murmur. I do God's will and rejoice in it. But I
  am very lonely."</p>

  <p>For a little there was silence, an ecstatic silence. Something hard within
  Catherine melted and she felt a gush of pity. No longer self-pity, but
  compassion for another. Her heart grew suddenly warm. It was as if a window
  had been opened in a close room to let in air and landscape.</p>

  <p>"I must rest, for there is much ado to-morrow. Will you sleep by me, for I
  have long been starved of a woman's comradeship?"</p>

  <p>In the great canopied bed the two girls lay till morning. Once in the
  darkness Catherine started and found her arms empty. Jeanne was kneeling by
  the window, her head thrown back and the moonlight on her upturned face. When
  she woke in the dawn the Maid was already up, trussing the points of her
  breeches and struggling with her long boots. She was crooning the verse of a
  ballad:</p>

  <p class="poem">"<i>Serais je nonette. Crois que non... </i>" <a href=
  "#endnote21">[21]</a></p>

  <p>and looking with happy eyes at the cool morning light on the forest.</p>

  <p>"Up, sleepy-head," she cried. "Listen to the merry trampling of the
  horses. I must start, if I would spare the poor things in the noon. Follow me
  with your prayers, for France rides with me. I love you, sweet sister; Be
  sure I will hasten to you when my work is done."</p>

  <p>So the Maid and her company rode off through the woods to
  Compi&egrave;gne, and a brooding and silent Catherine took the north road to
  Picardy.</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p><br>

  <p>The promise was kept. Once again Catherine saw and had speech of Jeanne.
  It was nearly two years later, when she sat in a May gloaming in the house of
  Beaumanoir, already three months a bride. Much had happened since she had
  ridden north from the inn at the forest cross-roads. She had summoned de
  Laval to her side, and the lovers had been reconciled. Her father had died in
  the winter and the great fortune and wide manors of the family were now her
  own. Her lover had fought with Jeanne in the futile battles of the spring,
  but he had been far away when in the fatal sortie at Compi&egrave;gne the
  Maid was taken by her enemies. All the summer of that year he had made
  desperate efforts at rescue, but Jeanne was tight in English hands, and
  presently was in prison at Rouen awaiting judgment, while her own king and
  his false councillors stirred not hand or foot to save her. Sir Guy had
  hurled himself on Burgundy, and with a picked band made havoc of the eastern
  roads, but he could not break the iron cordon of Normandy. In February they
  had been wed, but after that Beaumanoir saw him little, for he was reading
  Burgundy a lesson in the Santerre.</p>

  <p>Catherine sat at home, anxious, tremulous, but happy. A new-made wife
  lives in a new world, and though at times she grieved for the shame of her
  land, her mind was too full of housewifely cares, and her heart of her
  husband, for long repining. But often the thought of Jeanne drove a sword
  into her contentment...  So when she lifted her eyes from her embroidery and
  saw the Maid before her, relief and gladness sent her running to greet
  her.</p>

  <p>Long afterwards till she was very old Catherine would tell of that hour.
  She saw the figure outlined against a window full of the amethyst sky of
  evening. The white armour and the gay surcoat were gone.</p>

  <p>Jeanne was still clad like a boy in a coarse grey tunic and black
  breeches, but her boots did not show any dust of the summer roads. Her face
  was very pale, as if from long immurement, and her eyes were no more merry.
  They shone instead with a grave ardour of happiness, which checked
  Catherine's embrace and set her heart beating.</p>

  <p>She walked with light steps and kissed the young wife's cheek&mdash;a kiss
  like thistledown.</p>

  <p>"You are free?" Catherine stammered. Her voice seemed to break unwillingly
  in a holy quiet.</p>

  <p>"I am free," the Maid answered. "I have come again to you as I promised.
  But I cannot bide long. I am on a journey."</p>

  <p>"You go to the King?" said Catherine.</p>

  <p>"I go to my King."</p>

  <p>The Maid's hand took Catherine's, and her touch was like the fall of
  gossamer. She fingered the girl's broad ring which had come from distant
  ancestors, the ring which Sir Aimery of Beaumanoir had worn in the Crusades.
  She raised it and pressed it to her</p>

  <p>Catherine's limbs would not do her bidding. She would fain have risen in a
  hospitable bustle, but she seemed to be held motionless. Not by fear, but by
  an exquisite and happy awe. She remembered afterwards that from the Maid's
  rough clothes had come a faint savour of wood-smoke, as from one who has been
  tending a bonfire in the autumn stubble</p>

  <p>"God be with you, lady, and with the good knight, your husband. Remember
  my word to you, that every wife is like Mary the Blessed and may bear a
  saviour of mankind. The road is long, but the ways of Heaven are sure."</p>

  <p>Catherine stretched out her arms, for a longing so fierce had awoke in her
  that it gave her power to move again. Never in her life had she felt such a
  hunger of wistfulness. But Jeanne evaded her embrace. She stood poised as if
  listening.</p>

  <p>"They are calling me. I go. Adieu, sweet sister."</p>

  <p>A light shone in her face which did not come from the westering sun. To
  Catherine there was no sound of voices, but the Maid seemed to hear and
  answer. She raised her hand as if in blessing and passed out.</p>

  <p>Catherine sat long in an entranced silence. Waves of utter longing flowed
  over her, till she fell on her knees and prayer passionately to her saints,
  among whom not the least was that grey-tunicked Maid whose eyes seemed
  doorways into heaven. Her tirewoman found her asleep on her faldstool.

  <p>Early next morning there came posts to Beaumanoir, men on weary horses
  with a tragic message. On the day before, in the market-place of Rouen, the
  chief among the daughters of God had journeyed through the fire to
  Paradise.</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref7"
     id="ref7"></a>CHAPTER 6</h3>

  <h2>THE WOOD OF LIFE</h2>

  <p>The Lady Catherine de Laval, in her own right Countess of Beaumanoir, and
  mistress of fiefs and manors, rights of chase and warren, mills and hospices,
  the like of which were not in Picardy, was happy in all things but her
  family. Her one son had fallen in his youth in an obscure fray in Guienne,
  leaving two motherless boys who, after her husband's death, were the chief
  business of life to the Countess Catherine. The elder, Aimery, grew to
  manhood after the fashion of the men of her own house, a somewhat heavy
  country gentleman, much set upon rustic sports, slow at learning, and averse
  alike from camps and cities. The ambition of the grandmother found nothing to
  feed upon in the young lord of Beaumanoir. He was kind, virtuous and honest,
  but dull as a pool on a winter's highway.</p>

  <p>Catherine would fain have had the one youth a soldier and the other a
  saint, and of the two ambitions she most cherished the latter. The first made
  shipwreck on the rustic Aimery, and therefore the second burned more
  fiercely. She had the promise from the saints that her line had a great
  destiny, and the form of it she took to be sanctitude. For, all her married
  days she had ruled her life according to the canons of God, fasting and
  praying, cherishing the poor, tending the afflicted, giving of her great
  wealth bountifully to the Church. She had a name for holiness as far as the
  coasts of Italy. Surely from the blood of Beaumanoir one would arise to be in
  dark times a defender of the Faith, a champion of Christ whom after death the
  Church should accept among the beatified. Such a fate she desired for her
  seed more hungrily than any Emperor's crown.</p>

  <p>In the younger, Philip, there was hope. He had been an odd child, slim and
  pale while Aimery was large and ruddy, shy where his brother was bold and
  bold where he was shy. He was backward in games and unready in a quarrel, but
  it was observed that he had no fear of the dark, or of the Green Lady that
  haunted the river avenue. Father Ambrose, his tutor, reported him of quick
  and excellent parts, but marred by a dreaminess which might grow into
  <i>desidia</i> <a href="#endnote23">[23]</a> , that deadly sin. He had a
  peculiar grace of body and a silken courtesy of manner which won hearts. His
  grey eyes, even as a small boy, were serious and wise. But he seemed to dwell
  aloof, and while his brother's moods were plain for all to read, he had from
  early days a self-control which presented a mask to his little world. With
  this stoicism went independence. Philip walked his own way with a gentle
  obstinacy. "A saint, maybe," Father Ambrose told his grandmother. "But the
  kind of saint that the Church will ban before it blesses."</p>

  <p>To the old dame of Beaumanoir the child was the apple of her eye; and her
  affection drew from him a tenderness denied to others. But it brought no
  confidences. The dreaming boy made his own world, which was not, like his
  grandmother's, one of a dark road visited rarely by angels, with heaven as a
  shining city at the end of it; or, like his brother's, a green place of
  earthy jollity. It was as if the Breton blood of the Lavals and Rohans had
  brought to the solid stock of Beaumanoir the fairy whimsies of their dim
  ancestors. While the moors and woodlands were to Aimery only places to fly a
  hawk or follow a stag, to Philip they were a wizard land where dreams grew.
  And the mysteries of the Church were also food for his gold fancy, which by
  reshaping them stripped them of all terrors. He was extraordinarily happy,
  for he had the power to make again each fresh experience in a select inner
  world in which he walked as king, since he was its creator.</p>

  <p>He was a child of many fancies, but one especially stayed with him. When
  still very small, he slept in a cot in his grandmother's room, the walls of
  which were hung with tapestry from the Arras looms. One picture caught his
  eye, for the morning sun struck it, and when he woke early it glowed
  invitingly before him. It represented a little river twining about a coppice.
  There was no figure in the piece, which was bounded on one side by a great
  armoire, and on the other by the jamb of the chimney; but from extreme corner
  projected the plume of a helmet and the tip of a lance. There was someone
  there; someone riding towards the trees. It grew upon Philip that that little
  wood was a happy place, most happy and desirable. He fancied himself the
  knight, and he longed to be moving up the links of the stream. He followed
  every step of the way, across the shallow ford, past the sedges of a
  backwater, between two clumps of willows, and then over smooth green grass to
  the edge of the wood. But he never tried to picture what lay inside. That was
  sacred&mdash;even from his thoughts.</p>

  <p>When he grew older and was allowed to prowl about in the scriptorium of
  the Abbey of Montmirail which lay by the Canche side, he found his wood
  again. It was in a Psaltery on which a hundred years before some Flemish monk
  had lavished his gold and vermilion. Opposite the verse of Psalm XXIII.,
  "<i>In loco pascuae</i> <a href="#endnote24">[24]</a> ," was a picture almost
  the same as that in the bedroom arras. There were the river, the meadows, and
  the little wood, painted in colours far brighter than the tapestry. Never was
  such bloom of green or such depth of blue. But there was a difference. No
  lance or plume projected from the corner. The traveller had emerged from
  cover, and was walking waist-deep in the lush grasses. He was a thin,
  nondescript pilgrim, without arms save a great staff like the crozier of a
  Bishop. Philip was disappointed in him and preferred the invisible knight,
  but the wood was all he had desired. It was indeed a blessed place, and the
  old scribe had known it, for a scroll of gold hung above it with the words
  "<i>Sylva Vitae</i>." <a href="#endnote25">[25]</a></p>

  <p>At the age of ten the boy had passed far beyond Father Ambrose, and was
  sucking the Abbey dry of its learning, like some second Abelard. In the
  cloisters of Montmirail were men who had a smattering of the New Knowledge,
  about which Italy had gone mad, and, by the munificence of the Countess
  Catherine, copies had been made by the Italian <i>stationarii</i> <a href=
  "#endnote26">[26]</a> of some of the old books of Rome which the world had
  long forgotten. In the Abbey library, among a waste of antiphonaries and
  homilies and monkish chronicles, were to be found texts of Livy and Lucretius
  and the letters of Cicero. Philip was already a master of Latin, writing it
  with an elegance worthy of Niccolo the Florentine. At fourteen he entered the
  college of Robert of Sorbonne, but found little charm in its scholastic
  pedantry. But in the capital he learned the Greek tongue from a Byzantine,
  the elder Lascaris, and copied with his own hand a great part of Plato and
  Aristotle. His thirst grew with every draught of the new vintage. To Pavia he
  went and sat at the feet of Lorenzo Vallo. The company of Pico della
  Mirandola at Florence sealed him of the Platonic school, and like his master
  he dallied with mysteries and had a Jew in his house to teach him Hebrew that
  he might find a way of reconciling the Scriptures and the classics, the Jew
  and the Greek. From the verses which he wrote at this time, beautifully
  turned hexameters with a certain Lucretian cadence, it is clear that his mind
  was like Pico's, hovering about the borderland of human knowledge, clutching
  at the eternally evasive. Plato's Banquet was his gospel, where the quest of
  truth did not lack the warmth of desire. Only a fragment remains now of the
  best of his poems, that which earned the praise of Ficino and the great
  Lorenzo, and it is significant that the name of the piece was "The Wood of
  Life."</p>

  <p>At twenty Philip returned to Beaumanoir after long wanderings. He was the
  perfect scholar who had toiled at books and not less at the study of mankind.
  But his well-knit body and clear eyes showed no marks of bookishness, and
  Italy had made him a swordsman. A somewhat austere young man, he had kept
  himself unspotted in the rotting life of the Italian courts, and though he
  had learned from them suavity had not lost his simplicity. But he was more
  aloof than ever. There was little warmth in the grace of his courtesy, and
  his eyes were graver than before. It seemed that they had found much, but had
  had no joy of it, and that they were still craving. It was a disease of the
  time and men called it <i>aegritudo</i> <a href="#endnote27">[27]</a> . "No
  saint," the aged Ambrose told the Countess. "Virtuous, indeed, but not with
  the virtue of the religious. He will never enter the Church. He has drunk at
  headier streams." The Countess was nearing her end. All her days, for a
  saint, she had been a shrewd observer of life, but with the weakening of her
  body's strength she had sunk into the ghostly world which the Church devised
  as an ante-room to immortality. Her chamber was thronged with lean friars
  like shadows. To her came the Bishop of Beauvais, once a star of the Court,
  but now in his age a grim watch-dog of the Truth. To him she spoke of her
  hopes for Philip.</p>

  <p>"An Italianate scholar!" cried the old man. "None such shall pollute the
  Church with my will. They are beguiled by such baubles as the holy Saint
  Gregory denounced, <i>poetarum figmenta sive deliramenta</i>. <a href=
  "#endnote28">[28]</a> If your grandson, madame, is to enter the service of
  God he must renounce these pagan follies."</p>

  <p>The Bishop went, but his words remained. In the hour of her extremity the
  vision of Catherine was narrowed to a dreadful antagonism of light and
  darkness&mdash;God and Antichrist&mdash;the narrow way of salvation and a
  lost world. She was obsessed by the peril of her darling. Her last act must
  be to pluck him from his temptress. Her mood was fanned by the monks who
  surrounded her, narrow men whose honesty made them potent.</p>

  <p>The wan face on the bed moved Philip deeply. Tenderness filled his heart,
  and a great sense of alienation, for the dying woman spoke a tongue he had
  forgotten. Their two worlds were divided by a gulf which affection could not
  bridge. She spoke not with her own voice but with that of her confessors when
  she pled with him to do her wishes.</p>

  <p>"I have lived long," she said, "and know that the bread of this world is
  ashes. There is no peace but in God. You have always been the child of my
  heart, Philip, and I cannot die at ease till I am assured of your salvation
 ...  I have the prevision that from me a saint shall be born. It is God's
  plain commandment to you. Obey, and I go to Him with a quiet soul."</p>

  <p>For a moment he was tempted. Surely it was a little thing this, to gladden
  the dying. The rich Abbey of Montmirail was his for the taking, and where
  would a scholar's life be more happily lived than among its cool cloisters? A
  year ago, when he had been in the mood of seeing all contraries but as
  degrees in an ultimate truth, he might have assented. But in that dim
  chamber, with burning faces around him and the shadow of death overhead, he
  discovered in himself a new scrupulousness. It was the case of Esau; he was
  bidden sell his birthright for pottage, and affection could not gloss over
  the bargain.</p>

  <p>"I have no vocation," he said sadly. "I would fain do the will of God, but
  God must speak His will to each heart, and He does not speak thus to me."</p>

  <p>There was that in the words which woke a far-away memory of her girlhood.
  Once another in a forest inn had spoken thus to her. She stretched out her
  hand to him, and he covered it with kisses.</p>

  <p>But in the night the priests stirred her fears again, and next morning
  there was another tragic pleading, from which Philip fled almost in tears.
  Presently he found himself denied her chamber, unless he could give assurance
  of a changed mind. And so the uneasy days went on, till in a dawn of wind
  amid a great praying and chanting the soul of the Countess Catherine passed,
  and Aimery reigned in Beaumanoir.</p>

  <p>The place had grown hateful to Philip and he made ready to go. For him in
  his recalcitrancy there was only a younger son's portion, the little
  seigneury of Eaucourt, which had been his mother's. The good Aimery would
  have increased the inheritance, but Philip would have none of it. He had made
  his choice, and to ease his conscience must abide strictly by the
  consequences. Those days at Beaumanoir had plucked him from his moorings. For
  the moment the ardour of his quest for knowledge had burned low. He stifled
  in the air of the north, which was heavy with the fog of a furious ignorance.
  But his mind did not turn happily to the trifling of his Italian friends.
  There was a tragic greatness about such as his grandmother, a salt of
  nobility which was lacking among the mellow Florentines. Truth, it seemed to
  him, lay neither with the old Church nor the New Learning, and not by either
  way could he reach the desire of his heart.</p>

  <p>Aimery bade him a reluctant farewell. "If you will not keep me company
  here, I go to the wars. At Beaumanoir I grow fat. Ugh, this business of dying
  chills me." And then with a very red face he held out a gold ring. "Take it,
  Philip. She cherished it, and you were her favourite and should wear it. God
  knows I have enough."</p>

  <p>Likewise he presented him with a little vellum-bound book. "I found this
  yesterday, and you being the scholar among us should have it. See, the
  grandmother's name is written within."</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p><br>

  <p>It was a bright May morning when Philip, attended by only two lackeys as
  became a poor man, rode over the bridge of Canche with eyes turned southward.
  In the green singing world the pall lifted from his spirits. The earth which
  God had made was assuredly bigger and better than man's philosophies. "It
  would appear," he told himself, "that like the younger son in the tale, I am
  setting out to look for fortune."</p>

  <p>At an inn in the city of Orleans he examined his brother's gift. It was a
  volume of careful manuscript, entitled <i>Imago Mundi</i> <a href=
  "#endnote29">[29]</a> , and bearing the name of one Pierre d'Ailly, who had
  been Bishop of Cambray when the Countess Catherine was a child. He opened it
  and read of many marvels&mdash;how that the world was round, as Pythagoras
  held, so that if a man travelled west he would come in time to Asia where the
  sun rose. Philip brooded over the queer pages, letting his fancy run free,
  for he had been so wrapped up in the mysteries of man's soul that he had
  forgotten the mysteries of the earth which is that soul's place of
  pilgrimage. He read of cities with silver walls and golden towers waiting on
  the discoverer, and of a river on whose banks "<i>virescit sylva vitae</i>."
  <a href="#endnote30">[30]</a> And at that phrase he fell to dreaming of his
  childhood, and a pleasant unrest stirred in his heart. "Aimery has given me a
  precious viaticum," <a href="#endnote31">[31]</a> he said.</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p><br>

  <p>He travelled by slow stages into Italy, for he had no cause for haste. At
  Pavia he wandered listlessly among the lecture halls. What had once seemed to
  him the fine gold of eloquence was now only leaden rhetoric. In his lodging
  at Florence he handled once again his treasures&mdash;his books from Ficino's
  press; his manuscripts, some from Byzantium yellow with age, some on clean
  white vellum new copied by his order; his busts and gems and intaglios. What
  had become of that fervour with which he had been used to gaze on them? What
  of that delicious world into which, with drawn curtains and a clear lamp, he
  could retire at will? The brightness had died in the air.</p>

  <p>He found his friends very full of quarrels. There was a mighty feud
  between two of them on the respective merits of Cicero and Quintilian as
  lawgivers in grammar, and the air was thick with libels. Another pair
  wrangled in public over the pre-eminence of Scipio and Julius Caesar; others
  on narrow points of Latinity. There was a feud among the Platonists on a
  matter of interpretation, in which already stilettos had been drawn. More
  bitter still was the strife about mistresses&mdash; kitchen-wenches and
  courtesans, where one scholar stole shamelessly from the other and decked
  with names like Leshia and Erinna...  Philip sickened at what he had before
  tolerated, for he had brought back with him from the north a quickened sense
  of sin. Maybe the Bishop of Beauvais had been right. What virtue was there in
  this new knowledge if its prophets were apes and satyrs! Not here grew the
  Wood of Life. Priapus did not haunt its green fringes.</p>

  <p>His mind turned towards Venice. There the sea was, and there men dwelt
  with eyes turned to spacious and honourable quests, not to monkish hells and
  heavens or inward to unclean hearts. And in Venice in a tavern off the
  Merceria he spoke with destiny.</p>

  <p>It was a warm evening, and, having dined early, he sought the balcony
  which overlooked the canal. It was empty but for one man who sat at a table
  with a spread of papers before him on which he was intently engaged. Philip
  bade him good evening, and a face was raised which promptly took his fancy.
  The stranger wore a shabby grey doublet, but he had no air of poverty, for
  round his neck hung a massive chain of gold, and his broad belt held a richly
  chased dagger. He had unbuckled his sword, and it lay on the table holding
  down certain vagrant papers which fluttered in the evening wind. His face was
  hard and red like sandstone, and around his eyes were a multitude of fine
  wrinkles. It was these eyes that arrested Philip. They were of a pale brown
  as if bleached by weather and gazing over vast spaces; cool and quiet and
  friendly, but with a fire burning at the back of them. The man assessed
  Philip at a glance, and then, as if liking what he found in him, smiled so
  that white furrows appeared in his tanned cheeks. With a motion of his hand
  he swept aside his papers and beckoned the other to sit with him. He called
  on the drawer to bring a flask of Cyprus.</p>

  <p>"I was about to have my evening draught," he said. "Will you honour me
  with your company, sir?"</p>

  <p>The voice was so pleasant that Philip, who was in a mood to shun talk,
  could not refuse. He sat down by the board, and moved aside a paper to make
  room for the wine. He noticed that it was a map.</p>

  <p>The Bishop of Cambray had made him curious about such things. He drew it
  to him, and saw that it was a copy of Andrea Bianco's chart, drawn nearly
  half a century before, showing the Atlantic Sea with a maze of islands
  stretching westwards.</p>

  <p>The other shook his head. "A poor thing and out of date. Here," and he
  plucked a sheet from below the rest, "here is a better, which Fra Mauro of
  this city drew for the great prince, Henry of Portugal."</p>

  <p>Philip looked at the map, which showed a misshapen sprawling Africa, but
  with a clear ocean way round the south of it. His interest quickened. He
  peered at the queer shapes in the dimming light.</p>

  <p>"Then there is a way to the Indies by sea? Beyond doubt. I myself have
  turned the butt of Africa...  If these matters interest you? But the thought
  of that dry land has given me an African thirst. Hey, drawer!"</p>

  <p>He filled his glass from a fresh bottle. "'Twas in June four years back. I
  was in command of a caravel in the expedition of Diaz. The court of Lisbon
  had a fit of cold ague and we sailed with little goodwill; therefore it was
  our business to confound the doubters or perish. Already our seamen had
  reached the mouth of that mighty river they called the Congo, and clearly the
  butt of Africa could not be distant. We had the course of Cam and Behaim to
  guide us thus far, but after that was the darkness."</p>

  <p>The man's face had the intent look of one who remembers with passion. He
  told of the struggle to cross the Guinea Deep instead of hugging the shore;
  of blue idle days of calm when magic fish flew aboard and Leviathan wallowed
  so near that the caravels were all but overwhelmed by the wave of him; of a
  storm which swept the decks and washed away the Virgin on the bows of the
  Admiral's ship; of landfall at last in a place where the forests were knee
  deep in a muddy sea, strange forests where the branches twined like snakes;
  of a going ashore at a river mouth full of toothed serpents and giant apes,
  and of a fight with Behemoth among the reeds. Then a second storm blowing
  from the east had flung them seaward, and for weeks they were out of sight of
  land, steering by strange stars. They had their magnets and astrolabes, but
  it was a new world they had entered, and they trusted God rather than their
  wits. At last they turned eastward.</p>

  <p>"What distance before the turn?" Philip asked.</p>

  <p>"I know not. We were far from land and no man can measure a course on
  water."</p>

  <p>"Nay, but the ancients could," Philip cried, and he explained how the
  Romans had wheels of a certain diameter fixed to their ships' sides which the
  water turned in its passing, and which flung for each revolution a pebble
  into a tally-box."</p>

  <p>The other's eyes widened. "A master device! I would hear more of it. What
  a thing it is to have learning. We had only the hour-glass and
  guesswork."</p>

  <p>Then he told how on a certain day the crews would go no farther, being
  worn out by storms, for in those seas the tides were like cataracts and the
  waves were mountains. The admiral, Bartholomew Diaz, was forced to put about
  with a heavy heart, for he believed that a little way to the east he should
  find the southern cape of Africa. He steered west by north, looking for no
  land till Guinea was sighted. "But on the second morning we saw land to the
  northward, and following it westward came to a mighty cape so high that the
  top was in the clouds. There was such a gale from the east that we could do
  no more than gaze on it as we scudded past. Presently, still keeping land in
  sight, we were able to bend north again, and when we came into calm waters we
  captains went aboard the admiral's ship and knelt and gave thanks to God for
  His mercies. For we, the first of mortals, had rounded the butt of Africa and
  prepared the sea-road to the Indies."</p>

  <p>"A vision maybe."</p>

  <p>"Nay, it was no vision. I returned there under mild skies, when it was no
  longer a misty rock, but a green mountain. We landed, and set up a cross and
  ate the fruits and drank the water of the land. Likewise we changed its name
  from the Cape of Storms, as Diaz had dubbed it, to the Bona Esperanza, for
  indeed it seemed to us the hope of the world."</p>

  <p>"And beyond it?"</p>

  <p>"Beyond it we found a pleasant country, and would doubtless have made the
  Indies, if our ships had not grown foul and our crews mutinous from fear of
  the unknown. It is clear to me that we must establish a port of victualling
  in that southern Africa before we can sail the last stage to Cathay."</p>

  <p>The man spoke modestly and simply as if he were talking of a little
  journey from one village to another. Something in his serious calm powerfully
  caught Philip's fancy. In all his days he had never met such a one.</p>

  <p>"I have not your name, Signor," he said.</p>

  <p>"They call me Battista de Cosca, a citizen of Genoa, but these many years
  a wanderer. And yours?"</p>

  <p>Philip gave it and the stranger bowed. The de Lavals were known as a great
  house far beyond the confines of France.</p>

  <p>"You contemplate another voyage?"</p>

  <p>The brown man nodded. "I am here on the quest of maps, for these Venetians
  are the princes of map-making. Then I sail again."</p>

  <p>"To Cathay?"</p>

  <p>A sudden longing had taken Philip. It was as if a bright strange world had
  been spread before him compared with which the old was tarnished and
  dingy.</p>

  <p>Battista shook his head. "Not Cathay. To go there would be only to make
  assurance of that which we already know. I have shown the road: let others
  plan its details and build hostelries. For myself I am for a bolder
  venture."</p>

  <p>The balcony was filling up. A noisy group of young men were chattering at
  one table, and at others some of the merchants from the Merceria were at
  wine. But where the two sat it was quiet and dusky, though without on the
  canal the sky made a golden mirror. Philip could see his companion's face in
  the reflected light, and it reminded him of the friars who had filled the
  chamber of his dying grandmother. It was strained with a steadfast
  ardour.</p>

  <p>Battista leaned his elbows on the board and his eyes searched the
  other's.</p>

  <p>"I am minded to open my heart to you," he said. "You are young and of a
  noble stock. Likewise you are a scholar. I am on a mission, Sir
  Philip&mdash;the loftiest, I think, since Moses led Israel over the deserts.
  I am seeking a promised land. Not Cathay, but a greater. I sail presently,
  not the African seas, but the Sea of Darkness, the Mare Atlanticum." He
  nodded towards Bianco's map. "I am going beyond the Ultimate Islands."</p>

  <p>"Listen," he went on, and his voice fell very low and deep. "I take it we
  live in these latter days of which the prophets spoke. I remember a monk in
  Genoa who said that the Blessed Trinity ruled in turn, and that the reign of
  the Father was accomplished and that of the Son nearing its close; and that
  now the reign of the Spirit was at hand. It may have been heresy&mdash;I am
  no scholar&mdash;but he pointed a good moral. For, said he, the old things
  pass away and the boundaries of the world are shifting. Here in Europe we
  have come to knowledge of salvation, and brought the soul and mind of man to
  an edge and brightness like a sword. Having perfected the weapon, it is now
  God's will that we enter into possession of the new earth which He has kept
  hidden against this day, and He has sent His Spirit like a wind to blow us
  into those happy spaces...  Now, mark you, sir, this earth is not a flat
  plain surrounded by outer darkness, but a sphere hung in the heavens and
  sustained by God's hand. Therefore if a man travel east or west he will, if
  God prosper him, return in time to his starting-point."</p>

  <p>The speaker looked at Philip as if to invite contradiction, but the other
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is the belief of the best sailors," Battista went on; "it is the
  belief of the great Paolo Toscanelli in this very land of Italy."</p>

  <p>"It was the belief of a greater than he. The ancients&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ay, what of your ancients?" Battista asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>Philip responded with a scholar's zest. "Four centuries before our Lord's
  birth Aristotle taught the doctrine, from observing in different places the
  rise and setting of the heavenly bodies. The sages Eratosthenes, Hipparchus
  and Ptolemy amplified the teaching. It is found in the poetry of Manilius and
  Seneca, and it was a common thought in the minds of Virgil and Ovid and
  Pliny. You will find it in St. Augustine, and St. Isidore and Beda, and in
  many of the moderns. I myself have little knowledge of such things, but on
  the appeal to high authority your doctrine succeeds.'</p>

  <p>"What a thing is learning!" Battista exclaimed with reverence. "Here have
  I and such as I been fumbling in the dark when the great ones of old saw
  clearly!...  It follows, then, that a voyage westward will bring a man to
  Cathay?"</p>

  <p>"Assuredly. But how will he return? If the earth is a sphere, his course
  will be a descent, and on his way back he will have to climb a great steep of
  waters."</p>

  <p>"It is not so," said Battista vigorously. "Though why it is not so I
  cannot tell. Travelling eastward by land there is no such descent, and in
  this Mediterranean sea of ours one can sail as easily from Cadiz to Egypt as
  from Egypt to Cadiz. There is a divine alchemy in it which I cannot fathom,
  but the fact stands."</p>

  <p>"Then you would reach Cathay by the west?"</p>

  <p>"Not Cathay." The man's voice was very earnest. "There is a land between
  us and Cathay, a great island land beyond the Seven Cities of Antillia."</p>

  <p>"Cipango," said Philip, who had read Marco Polo's book in the Latin
  version published a year or two before.</p>

  <p>"Nay, not Cipango. On this side Cipango. Of Cipango the Venetians have
  told us much, but the land I seek is not Cipango."</p>

  <p>He drew closer to Philip and spoke low. "There was a Frenchman, a
  Rochellois he is dead these ten years&mdash;but I have spoken with him. He
  was whirled west by storms far beyond Antillia, and was gripped by a great
  ocean stream and carried to land. What think you it was? No less than
  Hy-Brasil. There he found men, broad-faced dusky men, with gentle souls, and
  saw such miracles as have never been vouchsafed to mortals. 'Twas not Cipango
  or Cathay' for there were no Emperors or cities, but a peaceful race dwelling
  in innocence. The land was like Eden, bringing forth five harvests in the
  year, and vines and all manner of fruits grew without tillage. Tortorel was
  the man's name, and some thought him mad, but I judged differently. I have
  talked with him and I have copied his charts. I go to find those Fortunate
  Islands."</p>

  <p>"Alone?"</p>

  <p>"I have friends. There is a man of my own city&mdash; Cristoforo Colombo,
  they call him. He is a hard man and a bitter, but a master seaman, and there
  is a fire in him that will not be put out. And there may be others."</p>

  <p>His steadfast burning eyes held Philip's.</p>

  <p>"And you&mdash;what do you seek?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Philip was aware that he had come to a cross roads in life. The easy path
  he had planned for himself was barred by his own nature. Something of his
  grandmother's blood clamoured within him for a sharper air than the
  well-warmed chamber of the scholar. This man, chance met in a tavern, had
  revealed to him his own heart.</p>

  <p>"I am looking for the Wood of Life," he said simply and was amazed at his
  words.</p>

  <p>Battista stared at him with open mouth, and then plucked feverishly at his
  doublet. From an inner pocket he produced a packet rolled in fine leather,
  and shook papers on the table. One of these was a soiled and worn slip of
  parchment, covered with an odd design. "Look," he said hoarsely. "Tortorel's
  map!"</p>

  <p>It showed a stretch of country, apparently a broad valley running east to
  a seashore. Through it twined a river and on both sides were hills dotted
  with trees. The centre seemed to be meadows, sown with villages and gardens.
  In one crook of the stream lay a little coppice on which many roads
  converged, and above it was written the words "<i>Sylva Vitae</i>."</p>

  <p>"It is the finger of God," said Battista. "Will you join me and search out
  this Wood of Life?"</p>

  <p>At that moment there was a bustle at the door giving on the main room of
  the tavern. Lights were being brought in and a new company were entering.
  They talked in high-pitched affected voices and giggled like bona-robas
  <a href="#endnote32">[32]</a> . There were young men with them, dressed in
  the height of the fashion; a woman or two, and a man who from the richness of
  his dress seemed to be one of the princely merchants who played Maecenas to
  the New Learning. But what caught Philip's sight was a little group of
  Byzantines who were the guests of honour. They wore fantastic headdresses and
  long female robes, above which their flowing dyed beards and their painted
  eyebrows looked like masks of Carnival time. After Battista's gravity their
  vain eyes and simpering tones seemed an indecent folly. These were the folk
  he had called friends, this the life he had once cherished. Assuredly he was
  well rid of it.</p>

  <p>He grasped Battista's hand.</p>

  <p>"I will go with you," he said, "over the edge of the world."</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p><br>

  <p>As it happened Philip de Laval did not sail with Columbus in that first
  voyage which brought him to San Salvador in the Bahamas. But he and Battista
  were in the second expedition, when the ship under the command of the latter
  was separated by a storm from her consorts, and driven on a westerly course
  when the others had turned south. It was believed to be lost, and for two
  years nothing was heard of its fate. At the end of that time a tattered
  little vessel reached Bordeaux, and Philip landed on the soil of Franc. He
  had a strange story to tell. The ship had been caught up by a current which
  had borne it north for the space of fifteen days till landfall was made on
  the coast of what we now call South Carolina. There it had been beached in an
  estuary, while the crew adventured inland. The land was rich enough, but the
  tribes were not the gentle race of Battista's imagining. There had been a
  savage struggle for mastery, till the strangers made alliances and were
  granted territory between the mountains and the sea. But they were only a
  handful and Philip was sent back for further colonists and for a cargo of
  arms and seeds and implements.</p>

  <p>The French court was in no humour for his tale, being much involved in its
  own wars. It may be that he was not believed; anyhow he got no help from his
  king. At his own cost and with the aid of friends he fitted out his ship for
  the return. After that the curtain falls. It would appear that the colony did
  not prosper, for it is on record that Philip in the year 1521 was living at
  his house at Eaucourt, a married man, occupied with books and the affairs of
  his little seigneury. A portrait of him still extant by an Italian artist
  shows a deeply furrowed face and stern brows, as of one who had endured much,
  but the eyes are happy. It is believed that in his last years he was one of
  the first of the gentlemen of Picardy to adhere to the Reformed
  faith.</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref8"
     id="ref8"></a>CHAPTER 7</h3>

  <h2>EAUCOURT BY THE WATERS</h2>

  <p>The horseman rode down the narrow vennel which led to the St. Denis gate
  of Paris, holding his nose like a fine lady. Behind him the city reeked in a
  close August twilight. From every entry came the smell of coarse cooking and
  unclean humanity, and the heaps of garbage in the gutters sent up a fog of
  malodorous dust when they were stirred by prowling dogs or hasty
  passengers.</p>

  <p>"Another week of heat and they will have the plague here, he muttered. Oh
  for Eaucourt&mdash;Eaucourt by the waters! I have too delicate a stomach for
  this Paris."</p>

  <p>His thoughts ran on to the country beyond the gates, the fields about St.
  Denis, the Clermont downs. Soon he would be stretching his bay on good
  turf.</p>

  <p>But the gates were closed, though it was not yet the hour of curfew. The
  lieutenant of the watch stood squarely before him with a forbidding air,
  while a file of arquebusiers lounged in the archway.</p>

  <p>"There's no going out to-night," was the answer to the impatient
  rider.</p>

  <p>"Tut, man, I am the Sieur de Laval, riding north on urgent affairs. My
  servants left at noon. Be quick. Open!"</p>

  <p>"Who ordered this folly?"</p>

  <p>"The Marshal Tavannes. Go argue with him, if your mightiness has the
  courage."</p>

  <p>The horseman was too old a campaigner to waste time in wrangling. He
  turned his horse's head and retraced his path up the vennel. "Now what in
  God's name is afoot to-night?" he asked himself, and the bay tossed his
  dainty head, as if in the same perplexity. He was a fine animal with the deep
  barrel and great shoulders of the Norman breed, and no more than his master
  did he love this place of alarums and stenches.</p>

  <p>Gaspard de Laval was a figure conspicuous enough even in that city of
  motley. For one thing he was well over two yards high, and, though somewhat
  lean for perfect proportions, his long arms and deep chest told of no common
  strength. He looked more than his thirty years, for his face was burned the
  colour of teak by hot suns, and a scar just under the hair wrinkled a broad
  low forehead. His small pointed beard was bleached by weather to the hue of
  pale honey. He wore a steel back and front over a doublet of dark taffeta,
  and his riding cloak was blue velvet lined with cherry satin. The man's habit
  was sombre except for the shine of steel and the occasional flutter of the
  gay lining. In his velvet bonnet he wore a white plume. The rich clothing
  became him well, and had just a hint of foreignness, as if commonly he were
  more roughly garbed. Which was indeed the case, for he was new back from the
  Western Seas, and had celebrated his home-coming with a brave suit.</p>

  <p>As a youth he had fought under Conde in the religious wars, but had
  followed Jean Ribaut to Florida, and had been one of the few survivors when
  the Spaniards sacked St. Caroline. With de Gourgues he had sailed west again
  for vengeance, and had got it. Thereafter he had been with the privateers of
  Brest and La Rochelle, a hornet to search out and sting the weak places of
  Spain on the Main and among the islands. But he was not born to live
  continually in outland parts, loving rather to intercalate fierce adventures
  between spells of home-keeping. The love of his green Picardy manor drew him
  back with gentle hands. He had now returned like a child to his playthings,
  and the chief thoughts in his head were his gardens and fishponds, the
  spinneys he had planted and the new German dogs he had got for boar-hunting
  in the forest. He looked forward to days of busy idleness in his modest
  kingdom.</p>

  <p>But first he must see his kinsman the Admiral about certain affairs of the
  New World which lay near to that great man's heart. Coligny was his
  godfather, from whom he was named; he was also his kinsman, for the Admiral's
  wife, Charlotte de Laval, was a cousin once removed. So to Chatillon Gaspard
  journeyed, and thence to Paris, whither the Huguenot leader had gone for the
  marriage f&ecirc;tes of the King of Navarre. Reaching the city on the Friday
  evening, he was met by ill news. That morning the Admiral's life had been
  attempted on his way back from watching the King at tennis. Happily the
  wounds were slight, a broken right forefinger and a bullet through the left
  forearm, but the outrage had taken away men's breath. That the Admiral of
  France, brought to Paris for those nuptials which were to be a pledge of a
  new peace, should be the target of assassins shocked the decent and alarmed
  the timid. The commonwealth was built on the side of a volcano, and the
  infernal fires were muttering. Friend and foe alike set the thing down to the
  Guises' credit, and the door of Coligny's lodging in the Rue de Bethisy was
  thronged by angry Huguenot gentry, clamouring to be permitted to take order
  with the Italianate murderers.</p>

  <p>On the Saturday morning Gaspard was admitted to audience with his kinsman,
  but found him so weak from Monsieur Ambrose Par&eacute;'s drastic surgery
  that he was compelled to postpone his business. "Get you back to Eaucourt,"
  said Coligny, "and cultivate your garden till I send for you. France is too
  crooked just now for a forthright fellow like you to do her service, and I do
  not think that the air of Paris is healthy for our house." Gaspard was fain
  to obey, judging that the Admiral spoke of some delicate state business for
  which he was aware he had no talent. A word with M. de Teligny reassured him
  as to the Admiral's safety, for according to him the King now leaned heavily
  against the Guises.</p>

  <p>But lo and behold! the gates of Paris were locked to him, and he found
  himself interned in the sweltering city.</p>

  <p>He did not like it. There was an ugly smack of intrigue in the air,
  puzzling to a plain soldier. Nor did he like the look of the streets now dim
  in the twilight. On his way to the gates they had been crammed like a barrel
  of salt fish, and in the throng there had been as many armed men as if an
  enemy made a leaguer beyond the walls. There had been, too, a great number of
  sallow southern faces, as if the Queen-mother had moved bodily thither a city
  of her countrymen. But now as the dark fell the streets were almost empty.
  The houses were packed to bursting&mdash;a blur of white faces could be seen
  at the windows, and every entry seemed to be alive with silent men. But in
  the streets there was scarcely a soul except priests, flitting from door to
  door, even stumbling against his horse in their preoccupation. Black, brown,
  and grey crows, they made Paris like Cartagena. The man's face took a very
  grim set as he watched these birds of ill omen. What in God's name had
  befallen his honest France?...  He was used to danger, but this secret
  massing chilled even his stout heart. It was like a wood he remembered in
  Florida where every bush had held an Indian arrow, but without sight or sound
  of a bowman. There was hell brewing in this foul cauldron of a city.</p>

  <p>He stabled his horse in the yard in the Rue du Coq, behind the glover's
  house where he had lain the night before. Then he set out to find supper. The
  first tavern served his purpose. Above the door was a wisp of red wool, which
  he knew for the Guise colours. Inside he looked to find a crowd, but there
  was but one other guest. Paris that night had business, it seemed, which did
  not lie in the taverns.</p>

  <p>That other guest was a man as big as himself, clad wholly in black, save
  for a stiff cambric ruff worn rather fuller than the fashion. He was heavily
  booted, and sat sideways on a settle with his left hand tucked in his belt
  and a great right elbow on the board. Something in his pose, half rustic,
  half braggart, seemed familiar to Gaspard. The next second the two were in
  each other's arms.</p>

  <p>"Gawain Champernoun!" cried Gaspard. "When I left you by the Isle of Pines
  I never hoped to meet you again in a Paris inn? What's your errand, man, in
  this den of thieves?"</p>

  <p>"Business of state," the Englishman laughed. "I have been with Walsingham,
  her Majesty's Ambassador, and looked to start home to-night. But your city is
  marvellous unwilling to part with her guests. What's toward, Gaspard?"</p>

  <p>"For me, supper," and he fell with zest to the broiled fowl he had
  ordered. The other sent for another flask of the wine of Anjou, observing
  that he had a plaguey thirst.</p>

  <p>"I think," said Gaspard, at last raising his eyes from his food, "that
  Paris will be unwholesome to-night for decent folk."</p>

  <p>"There's a murrain of friars about," said Champernoun, leisurely picking
  his teeth.</p>

  <p>"The place hums like a bee-hive before swarming. Better get back to your
  Ambassador, Gawain. There's sanctuary for you under his cloak."</p>

  <p>The Englishman made a pellet of bread and flicked it at the other's face.
  "I may have to box your ears, old friend. Since when have I taken to shirking
  a fracas? We were together at St. John d'Ulloa, and you should know me
  better."</p>

  <p>"Are you armed?" was Gaspard's next question.</p>

  <p>Champernoun patted his sword. "Also there are pistols in my holsters."</p>

  <p>"You have a horse, then?"</p>

  <p>"Stabled within twenty yards. My rascally groom carried a message to Sir
  Francis, and as he has been gone over an hour, I fear he may have come to an
  untimely end."</p>

  <p>"Then it will be well this night for us two to hold together. I know our
  Paris mob and there is nothing crueller out of hell. The pistolling of the
  Admiral de Coligny has given them a taste of blood, and they may have a fancy
  for killing Luteranos. Two such as you and I, guarding each other's backs,
  may see sport before morning, and haply rid the world of a few miscreants.
  What say you, camerado?"</p>

  <p>"Good. But what account shall we give of ourselves if someone questions
  us?"</p>

  <p>"Why, we are Spanish esquires in the train of King Philip's Mission. Our
  clothes are dark enough for the dons' fashion, and we both speak their tongue
  freely. Behold in me the Se&ntilde;or Juan Gonzalez de Mendoza, a poor knight
  of Castile, most earnest in the cause of Holy Church."</p>

  <p>"And I," said the Englishman with the gusto of a boy in a game, "am named
  Rodriguez de Bobadilla. I knew the man, who is dead, and his brother owes me
  ten crowns...  But if we fall in with the Spanish Ambassador's
  gentlemen?"</p>

  <p>"We will outface them."</p>

  <p>"But if they detect the imposture?"</p>

  <p>"Why, wring their necks. You are getting as cautious as an apple-wife,
  Gawain."</p>

  <p>"When I set out on a business I like to weigh it, that I may know how much
  is to be charged to my own wits and how much I must leave to God. To-night it
  would appear that the Almighty must hold us very tight by the hand. Well, I
  am ready when I have I drunk another cup of wine." He drew his sword and
  lovingly fingered its edge, whistling all the while.</p>

  <p>Gaspard went to the door and looked into the street. The city was still
  strangely quiet. No roysterers swaggered home along the pavements, no tramp
  of cuirassiers told of the passage of a great man. But again he had the sense
  that hot fires were glowing under these cold ashes. The mist had lifted and
  the stars were clear, and over the dark mass of the Louvre a great planet
  burned. The air was warm and stifling, and with a gesture of impatience he
  slammed the door. By now he ought to have been drinking the cool night on the
  downs beyond Oise.</p>

  <p>The Englishman had called for another bottle, and it was served in the
  empty tavern by the landlord himself. As the wine was brought in the two fell
  to talking Spanish, at the sound of which the man visibly started. His
  furtive sulky face changed to a sly friendliness. "Your excellencies have
  come to town for the good work," he said, sidling and bowing.</p>

  <p>With a more than Spanish gravity Gaspard inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"When does it start?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that we common folk do not know. But there will be a signal. Father
  Antoine has promised us a signal. But messieurs have not badges. Perhaps they
  do not need them for their faces will be known. Nevertheless for better
  security it might be well... " He stopped with the air of a huckster crying
  his wares.</p>

  <p>Gaspard spoke a word to Champernoun in Spanish. Then to the landlord: "We
  are strangers, so must bow to the custom of your city. Have you a man to send
  to the Hotel de Guise?"</p>

  <p>"Why trouble the Duke, my lord?" was the answer. "See, I will make you
  badges."</p>

  <p>He tore up a napkin, and bound two white strips crosswise on their left
  arms, and pinned a rag to their bonnets. "There, messieurs, you are now
  wearing honest colours for all to see. It is well, for presently blood will
  be hot and eyes blind."</p>

  <p>Gaspard flung him a piece of gold, and he bowed himself out. "Bonne
  fortune, lordships," were his parting words. "'Twill be a great night for our
  Lord Christ and our Lord King."</p>

  <p>"And his lord the Devil," said Champernoun. "What madness has taken your
  good France? These are Spanish manners, and they sicken me. Cockades and
  signals and such-like flummery!"</p>

  <p>The other's face had grown sober. "For certain hell is afoot to-night. It
  is the Admiral they seek. The Guisards and their reiters <a href=
  "#endnote33">[33]</a> and a pack of 'prentices maddened by sermons. I would
  to God he were in the Palace with the King of Navarre and the young
  Conde."</p>

  <p>"But he is well guarded. I heard that a hundred Huguenots' swords keep
  watch by his house."</p>

  <p>"Maybe. But we of the religion are too bold and too trustful. We are not
  match for the Guises and their Italian tricks. I think we will go to
  Coligny's lodgings. Mounted, for a man on a horse has an advantage if the mob
  are out!"</p>

  <p>The two left the tavern, both sniffing the air as if they found it
  tainted. The streets were filling now, and men were running as if to a
  rendezvous, running hot-foot without speech and without lights. Most wore
  white crosses on their left sleeve. The horses waited, already saddled, in
  stables not a furlong apart, and it was the work of a minute to bridle and
  mount. The two as if by a common impulse halted their beasts at the mouth of
  the Rue du Coq, and listened. The city was quiet on the surface, but there
  was a low deep undercurrent of sound, like the soft purring of a lion before
  he roars. The sky was bright with stars. There was no moon, but over the Isle
  was a faint tremulous glow.</p>

  <p>"It is long past midnight," said Gaspard; "in a little it will be
  dawn."</p>

  <p>Suddenly a shot cracked out. It was so sharp a sound among the muffled
  noises that it stung the ear like a whip-lash. It came from the dark mass of
  the Louvre, from somewhere beyond the Grand Jardin. It was followed instantly
  by a hubbub far down the Rue St. Honor&eacute; and a glare kindled where that
  street joined the Rue d'Arbre Sec.</p>

  <p>"That way lies the Admiral," Gaspard cried. "I go to him," and he clapped
  spurs to his horse.</p>

  <p>But as his beast leapt forward another sound broke out, coming apparently
  from above their heads. It was the clanging of a great bell.</p>

  <p>There is no music so dominant as bells. Their voice occupies sky as well
  as earth, and they overwhelm the senses, so that a man's blood must keep pace
  with their beat. They can suit every part, jangling in wild joy, or copying
  the slow pace of sorrow, or pealing in ordered rhythm, blithe but with a
  warning of mortality in their cadence. But this bell played dance music. It
  summoned to an infernal jig. Blood and fever were in its broken fall, hate
  and madness and death.</p>

  <p>Gaspard checked his plunging horse. "By God, it is from St. Germains
  l'Auxerrois! The Palace church. The King is in it. It is a plot against our
  faith. They have got the pick of us in their trap and would make an end of
  us."</p>

  <p>From every house and entry men and women and priests were pouring to swell
  the army that pressed roaring eastwards. No one heeded the two as they sat
  their horses like rocks in the middle of a torrent.</p>

  <p>"The Admiral is gone," said Gaspard with a sob in his voice. "Our few
  hundred spears cannot stand against the King's army. It remains for us to die
  with him."</p>

  <p>Champernoun was cursing steadily in a mixture of English and Spanish, good
  mouth-filling oaths delivered without heat. "Die we doubtless shall, but not
  before we have trounced this bloody rabble."</p>

  <p>Still Gaspard did not move. "After to-night there will be no gentlemen
  left in France, for we of the religion had all the breeding. Then he laughed
  bitterly. "I mind Ribaut's last words, when Menendez slew him. 'We are of
  earth,' says he, 'and to earth we must return, and twenty years more or less
  can matter little!' That is our case to-night, old friend."</p>

  <p>"Maybe," said the Englishman. "But why talk of dying? You and I are
  Spanish caballeros. Walsingham told me that the King hated that nation, and
  that the Queen-mother loved it not, but it would appear that now we are very
  popular in Paris."</p>

  <p>"Nay, nay, this is no time to play the Nicodemite. It is the hour for
  public confession "I'm off to the dead Admiral to avenge him on his
  assassins."</p>

  <p>"Softly, Gaspard. You and I are old companions in war, and we do not ride
  against a stone wall if there be a gate. It was not thus that Gourgues
  avenged Ribaut at St. John's. Let us thank God that we hold a master card in
  this game. We are two foxes in a flock of angry roosters, and by the Lord's
  grace we will take our toll of them. Cunning, my friend. A stratagem of war!
  We stand outside this welter and, having only the cold passion of revenge,
  can think coolly. God's truth, man, have we fought the Indian and the
  Spaniard for nothing? Wily is the word...  Are we two gentlemen, who fear
  God, to be worsted by a rabble of Papegots and Marannes?"</p>

  <p>It was the word "Marannes," or, as we say, "halfcastes," which brought
  conviction to Gaspard. Suddenly he saw his enemies as less formidable, as
  something contemptible&mdash;things of a lower breed, dupers who might
  themselves be duped.</p>

  <p>"Faith, Gawain, you are the true campaigner. Let us forward, and trust to
  Heaven to show us a road."</p>

  <p>They galloped down the Rue St. Honor&eacute;, finding an open space in the
  cobbles of the centre, but at the turning into the Rue d'Arbre Sec they met a
  block. A great throng with torches was coming in on the right from the
  direction of the Bourbon and d'Alen&ccedil;on hotels. Yet by pressing their
  horses with whip and spur, and by that awe which the two tall dark cavaliers
  inspired even in a mob which had lost its wits, they managed to make their
  way to the entrance of the Rue de Bethisy. There they came suddenly upon
  quiet.</p>

  <p>The crowd was held back by mounted men who made a ring around the gate of
  a high dark building. Inside its courtyard there were cries and the rumour of
  fighting, but out in the street there was silence. Every eye was turned to
  the archway, which was bright as day with the glare of fifty lanterns.</p>

  <p>The two rode straight to the ring of soldiers.</p>

  <p>"Make way," Gaspard commanded, speaking with a foreign accent.</p>

  <p>"For whom, monsieur?" one asked who seemed to be of a higher standing than
  the rest.</p>

  <p>"For the Ambassador of the King of Spain."</p>

  <p>The man touched his bonnet and opened up a road by striking the adjacent
  horses with the flat of his sword, and the two rode into the ring so that
  they faced the archway. They could see a little way inside the courtyard,
  where the light gleamed on armour. The men there were no rabble, but Guise's
  Swiss.</p>

  <p>A priest came out, wearing the Jacobin habit, one of those preaching
  friars who had been fevering the blood of Paris. The crowd behind the
  men-at-arms knew him, for even in its absorption it sent up shouts of
  greeting. He flitted like a bat towards Gaspard and Champernoun and peered up
  at them. His face was lean and wolfish, with cruel arrogant eyes.</p>

  <p>"Hail, father!" said Gaspard in Spanish. "How goes the good work?"</p>

  <p>He replied in the same tongue. "Bravely, my children. But this is but the
  beginning. Are you girt and ready for the harvesting?"</p>

  <p>"We are ready," said Gaspard. His voice shook with fury, but the Jacobin
  took it for enthusiasm. He held up his hand in blessing and fluttered back to
  the archway.</p>

  <p>From inside the courtyard came the sound of something falling, and then a
  great shout. The mob had jumped to a conclusion. "That is the end of old
  Toothpick," a voice cried, using the Admiral's nickname There was a wild
  surge round the horsemen, but the ring held. A body of soldiers poured out of
  the gate, with blood on their bare swords. Among them was one tall fellow all
  in armour, with a broken plume on his bonnet. His face was torn and
  disfigured and he was laughing horribly. The Jacobin rushed to embrace him,
  and the man dropped on his knees to receive a blessing.</p>

  <p>"Behold our hero," the friar cried. "His good blade has rid us of the
  arch-heretic," and the mob took up the shout.</p>

  <p>Gaspard was cool now. His fury had become a cold thing like a glacier.</p>

  <p>"I know him!" he whispered to Champernoun. He is the Italian Petrucci. He
  is our first quarry."</p>

  <p>The second will be that damned friar," was the Englishman's answer.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the ring of men-at-arms drew inward as a horseman rode out of the
  gate followed by half a dozen attendants. He was a tall young man, very noble
  to look upon, with a flushed face like a boy warm from the game of paume
  <a href="#endnote34">[34]</a> . His long satin coat was richly embroidered,
  and round his neck hung the thick gold collar of some Order. He was wiping a
  stain from his sleeve with a fine lawn handkerchief.</p>

  <p>What is that thing gilt like a chalice?" whispered Champernoun.</p>

  <p>"Henry of Guise," said Gaspard.</p>

  <p>The Duke caught sight of the two men in the centre of the ring. The
  lanterns made the whole place bright and he could see every detail of their
  dress and bearing. He saluted them courteously.</p>

  <p>"We make your Grace our compliments," said Gaspard. "We are of the
  household of the Ambassador of Spain, and could not rest indoors when great
  deeds were being done in the city."</p>

  <p>The young man smiled pleasantly. There was a boyish grace in his
  gesture.</p>

  <p>"You are welcome, gentlemen. I would have every good Catholic in Europe
  see with his own eyes the good work of this Bartholomew's day. I would ask
  you to ride with me, but I leave the city in pursuit of the Count of
  Montgomery, who is rumoured to have escaped. There will be much for you to
  see on this happy Sunday. But stay! You are not attended, and our streets are
  none too safe for strangers. Presently the Huguenots will counterfeit our
  white cross, and blunders may be made by the overzealous."</p>

  <p>He unclasped the jewel which hung at the end of his chain. It was a little
  Agnus of gold and enamel, surmounting a lozenge-shaped shield charged with an
  eagle.</p>

  <p>"Take this," he said, "and return it to me when the work is over. Show it
  if any man dares to question you. It is a passport from Henry of Guise...
  And now forward," he cried to his followers. "Forward for Montgomery and the
  Vidame."</p>

  <p>The two looked after the splendid figure. "That bird is in fine feather,"
  said Champernoun.</p>

  <p>Gaspard's jaw was very grim. "Some day he will lie huddled under the
  assassin's knife. He will die as he has made my chief die, and his body will
  be cast to the dog's... </p>

  <p>But he has given me a plan," and he spoke in his companion's ear.</p>

  <p>The Englishman laughed. His stolidity had been slow to quicken, but his
  eyes were now hot and he had altogether ceased to swear.</p>

  <p>"First let me get back to Walsingham's lodging. I have a young kinsman
  there, they call him Walter Raleigh, who would dearly love this venture."</p>

  <p>"Tut, man, be serious. We play a desperate game, and there is no place for
  boys in it. We have Guise's jewel, and by the living God we will use it. My
  mark is Petrucci."</p>

  <p>"And the priest," said Champernoun.</p>

  <p>The crowd in the Rue de Bethisy was thinning, as bands of soldiers, each
  with its tail of rabble, moved off to draw other coverts. There was fighting
  still in many houses, and on the roof-tops as the pale dawn spread could be
  seen the hunt for fugitives. Torches and lanterns still flickered obscenely,
  and the blood in the gutters shone sometimes golden in their glare and
  sometimes spread drab and horrid in the waxing daylight.</p>

  <p>The Jacobin stood at their elbow. "Follow me, my lords of Spain," he
  cried. "No friends of God and the Duke dare be idle this happy morn. Follow,
  and I will show you wonders."</p>

  <p>He led them east to where a broader street ran to the river.</p>

  <p>"Somewhere here lies Teligny," he croaked. "Once he is dead the second
  head is lopped from the dragon of Babylon. Oh that God would show us where
  Conde and Navarre are hid, for without them our task is incomplete.</p>

  <p>There was a great crowd about the door of one house, and into it the
  Jacobin fought his way with prayers and threats. Some Huguenot&mdash;Teligny
  it might be&mdash;was cornered there, but in the narrow place only a few
  could join in the hunt, and the hunters, not to be impeded by the multitude,
  presently set a guard at the street door. The mob below was already drunk
  with blood, and found waiting intolerable; but it had no leader and foamed
  aimlessly about the causeway. There were women in it with flying hair like
  Maenads, who shrilled obscenities, and drunken butchers and watermen and
  grooms who had started out for loot and ended in sheer lust of slaying, and
  dozens of broken desperadoes and led-captains who looked on the day as their
  carnival. But to the mob had come one of those moments of indecision when it
  halted and eddied like a whirlpool.</p>

  <p>Suddenly in its midst appeared two tall horsemen.</p>

  <p>"Men of Paris," cried Gaspard with that masterful voice which is born of
  the deep seas. "You see this jewel. It was given me an hour back by Henry of
  Guise."</p>

  <p>A ruffian examined it. "Ay," he murmured with reverence, "it is our
  Duke's. I saw it on his breast before Coligny's house."</p>

  <p>The mob was all ears. "I have the Duke's command," Gaspard went on. "He
  pursues Montgomery and the Vidame of Chartres. Coligny is dead. Teliguy in
  there is about to die. But where are all the others? Where is La
  Rochefoucault? Where is Rosny? Where is Grammont? Where, above all, are the
  young Conde and the King of Navarre?"</p>

  <p>The names set the rabble howling. Every eye was on the speaker.</p>

  <p>Gaspard commanded silence. "I will tell you. The Huguenots are cunning as
  foxes. They planned this very day to seize the King and make themselves
  masters of France. They have copied your badge," and he glanced towards his
  left arm. "Thousands of them are waiting for revenge, and before it is full
  day they will be on you. You will not know them, you will take them for your
  friends, and you will have your throats cut before you find out your
  error."</p>

  <p>A crowd may be wolves one moment and chickens the next, for cruelty and
  fear are cousins. A shiver of apprehension went through the soberer part. One
  drunkard who shouted was clubbed on the head by his neighbour. Gaspard saw
  his chance.</p>

  <p>"My word to you&mdash;the Duke's word&mdash;is to forestall this devilry.
  Follow me, and strike down every band of white-badged Huguenots. For among
  them be sure is the cub of Navarre."</p>

  <p>It was the leadership which the masterless men wanted. Fifty swords were
  raised, and a shout went up which shook the windows of that lodging where
  even now Teliguy was being done to death. With the two horsemen at their head
  the rabble poured westwards towards the Rue d'Arbre Sec and the Louvre, for
  there in the vicinity of the Palace were the likeliest coverts.</p>

  <p>"Now Heaven send us Petrucci," said Gaspard. "Would that the Little Man
  had been alive and with us! This would have been a ruse after his own
  heart,"</p>

  <p>"I think the great Conde would have specially misliked yon monk," said the
  Englishman.</p>

  <p>"Patience, Gawain. One foe at a time. My heart tells me that you will get
  your priest."</p>

  <p>The streets, still dim in the dawn, were thickly carpeted with dead. The
  mob kicked and befouled the bodies, and the bravos in sheer wantonness spiked
  them with their swords. There were women there, and children, lying twisted
  on the causeway. Once a fugitive darted out of an entry, to be brought down
  by a butcher's axe.</p>

  <p>"I have never seen worse in the Indies," and Champernoun shivered. "My
  stomach turns. For heaven's sake let us ride down this rabble!"</p>

  <p>"Patience," said Gaspard, his eyes hard as stones. "Cursed be he that
  putteth his hand to the plough and then turns back."</p>

  <p>They passed several small bodies of Catholic horse, which they greeted
  with cheers. That was in the Rue des Poulies; and at the corner where it
  abutted on the quay before the Hotel de Bourbon, a ferret-faced man ran
  blindly into them. Gaspard caught him and drew him to his horse's side, for
  he recognised the landlord of the tavern where he had supped.</p>

  <p>"What news, friend?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The man was in an anguish of terror, but he recognised his former
  guest.</p>

  <p>"There is a band on the quay," he stammered. "They are mad and do not know
  a Catholic when they see him. They would have killed me, had not the good
  Father Antoine held them till I made off."</p>

  <p>"Who leads them?" Gaspard asked, having a premonition.</p>

  <p>"A tall man in crimson with a broken plume."</p>

  <p>"How many?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe a hundred, and at least half are men-at-arms."</p>

  <p>Gaspard turned to Champernoun.</p>

  <p>"We have found our quarry," he said.</p>

  <p>Then he spoke to his following, and noted with comfort that it was now
  some hundred strong, and numbered many swords. "There is a Huguenot band
  before us," he cried. "They wear our crosses, and this honest fellow has
  barely escaped from them. They are less than three score. On them, my gallant
  lads, before they increase their strength, and mark specially the long man in
  red, for he is the Devil. It may be Navarre is with them."</p>

  <p>The mob needed no second bidding. Their chance had come, and they swept
  along with a hoarse mutter more fearful than any shouting.</p>

  <p>"Knee to knee, Gawain," said Gaspard, "as at St. John d'Ulloa. Remember,
  Petrucci is for me."</p>

  <p>The Italian's band, crazy with drink and easy slaying, straggled across
  the wide quay and had no thought of danger till the two horsemen were upon
  them. The songs died on their lips as they saw bearing down on them an
  avenging army. The scared cries of "The Huguenots!" "Montgomery!" were to
  Gaspard's following a confirmation of their treachery. The swords of the
  bravos and the axes and knives of the Parisian mob made havoc with the
  civilian rabble, but the men-at-arms recovered themselves and in knots fought
  a stout battle. But the band was broken at the start by the two grim horsemen
  who rode through it as through meadow grass, their blades falling terribly,
  and then turned and cut their way back. Yet a third time they turned, and in
  that last mowing they found their desire. A tall man in crimson appeared
  before them. Gaspard flung his reins to Champernoun and in a second was on
  the ground, fighting with a fury that these long hours had been stifled.
  Before his blade the Italian gave ground till he was pinned against the wall
  of the Bourbon hotel. His eyes were staring with amazement and dawning fear.
  "I am a friend," he stammered in broken French and was answered in curt
  Spanish. Presently his guard weakened and Gaspard gave him the point in his
  heart. As he drooped to the ground, his conqueror bent over him. "The Admiral
  is avenged," he said. "Tell your master in hell that you died at the hands of
  Coligny's kinsman."</p>

  <p>Gaspard remounted, and, since the fight had now gone eastward, they rode
  on to the main gate of the Louvre, where they met a company of the royal
  Guards coming out to discover the cause of an uproar so close to the Palace.
  He told his tale of the Spanish Embassy and showed Guise's jewel. "The
  streets are full of Huguenots badged as Catholics. His Majesty will be well
  advised to quiet the rabble or he will lose some trusty servants."</p>

  <p>In the Rue du Coq, now almost empty, the two, horsemen halted.</p>

  <p>"We had better be journeying, Gawain. Guise's jewel will open the gates.
  In an hour's time all Paris will be on our trail."</p>

  <p>"There is still that priest," said Champernoun doggedly. He was breathing
  heavily, and his eyes were light and daring. Like all his countrymen, he was
  slow to kindle but slower to cool.</p>

  <p>"In an hour, if we linger here, we shall be at his mercy. Let us head for
  the St. Antoine gate."</p>

  <p>The jewel made their way easy, for through that gate Henry of Guise
  himself had passed in the small hours. "Half an hour ago," the lieutenant of
  the watch told them, "I opened to another party which bore the Duke's
  credentials. They were for Amiens to spread the good news."</p>

  <p>"Had they a priest with them?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, a Jacobin monk, who cried on them to hasten and not spare their
  horses. He said there was much to do in the north."</p>

  <p>"I think the holy man spoke truth," said Gaspard, and they rode into open
  country.</p>

  <p>They broke their fast on black bread and a cup of wine at the first inn,
  where a crowd of frightened countrymen were looking in the direction of
  Paris. It was now about seven o'clock, and a faint haze, which promised heat,
  cloaked the ground. From it rose the towers and high-peaked roofs of the
  city, insubstantial as a dream.</p>

  <p>"Eaucourt by the waters!" sighed Gaspard. "That the same land should hold
  that treasure and this foul city!"</p>

  <p>Their horses, rested and fed, carried them well on the north road, but by
  ten o'clock they had overtaken no travellers, save a couple of servants, on
  sorry nags, who wore the Vidame of Amiens' livery. They were well beyond Oise
  ere they saw in the bottom of a grassy vale a little knot of men.</p>

  <p>"I make out six," said Champernoun, who had a falcon's eye. "Two priests
  and four men-at-arms. Reasonable odds, such as I love. Faith, that monk
  travels fast!"</p>

  <p>"I do not think there will be much fighting," said Gaspard.</p>

  <p>Twenty minutes later they rode abreast of the party, which at first had
  wheeled round on guard, and then had resumed its course at the sight of the
  white armlets. It was as Champernoun had said. Four lusty arquebusiers
  escorted the Jacobin. But the sixth man was no priest. He was a Huguenot
  minister whom Gaspard remembered with Conde's army, an elderly frail man
  bound with cruel thongs to a horse's back and his legs tethered beneath its
  belly.</p>

  <p>Recognition awoke in the Jacobin's eye. "Ah, my lords of Spain! What
  brings you northward?"</p>

  <p>Gaspard was by his side, while Champernoun a pace behind was abreast the
  minister.</p>

  <p>"To see the completion of the good work begun this. morning."</p>

  <p>"You have come the right road. I go to kindle the north to a holy
  emulation. That heretic dog behind is a Picard, and I bring him to Amiens
  that he may perish there as a warning to his countrymen."</p>

  <p>"So?" said Gaspard, and at the word the Huguenot's horse, pricked
  stealthily by Champernoun's sword, leaped forward and dashed in fright up the
  hill, its rider sitting stiff as a doll in his bonds. The Jacobin cried out
  and the soldiers made as if to follow, but Gaspard's voice checked them. "Let
  be. The beast will not go far. I have matters of importance to discuss with
  this reverend father."</p>

  <p>The priest's face sharpened with a sudden suspicion. "Your manners are
  somewhat peremptory, sir Spaniard. But speak and let us get on."</p>

  <p>"I have only the one word. I told you we had come north to see the
  fruition of the good work, and you approved. We do not mean the same. By good
  work I mean that about sunrise I slew with this sword the man Petrucci, who
  slew the Admiral. By its fruition I mean that I have come to settle with
  you."</p>

  <p>"You...  ?" the other stammered.</p>

  <p>"I am Gaspard de Laval, a kinsman and humble follower of Goligny."</p>

  <p>The Jacobin was no coward. "Treason!" he cried. "A Huguenot! Cut them
  down, my men," and he drew a knife from beneath his robe.</p>

  <p>But Gaspard's eye and voice checked the troopers. He held in his hand the
  gold trinket. "I have no quarrel with you. This is the passport of your
  leader, the Duke. I show it to you, and if you are questioned about this
  day's work you can reply that you took your orders from him who carried
  Guise's jewel. Go your ways back to Paris if you would avoid trouble."</p>

  <p>Two of the men seemed to waver, but the maddened cry of the priest
  detained them. "They seek to murder me," he screamed. "Would you desert God's
  Church and burn in torment for ever?" He hurled himself on Gaspard, who
  caught his wrist so that the knife tinkled on the high road while the man
  overbalanced himself and fell. The next second the mellay had begun.</p>

  <p>It did not last long. The troopers were heavy fellows, cumbrously armed,
  who, even with numbers on their side, stood little chance against two swift
  swordsmen, who had been trained to fight together against odds. One Gaspard
  pulled from the saddle so that he lay senseless on the ground. One
  Champernoun felled with a sword cut of which no morion <a href=
  "#endnote35">[35]</a> could break the force. The two others turned tail and
  fled, and the last seen of them was a dust cloud on the road to Paris.</p>

  <p>Gaspard had not drawn his sword. They stood by the bridge of a little
  river, and he flung Guise's jewel far into its lilied waters.</p>

  <p>"A useful bauble," he smiled, "but its purpose is served."</p>

  <p>The priest stood in the dust, with furious eyes burning in an ashen
  face.</p>

  <p>"What will you do with me?"</p>

  <p>"This has been your day of triumph, father. I would round it off worthily
  by helping you to a martyr's crown. Gawain," and he turned to his companion,
  "go up the road and fetch me the rope which binds the minister."</p>

  <p>The runaway was feeding peaceably by the highway. Champernoun cut the old
  man's bonds, and laid him fainting on the grass. He brought back with him a
  length of stout cord.</p>

  <p>"Let the brute live," he said. "Duck him and truss him up, but don't dirty
  your hands with him. I'd as lief kill a woman as a monk."</p>

  <p>But Gaspard's smiling face was a rock. "This is no Englishman's concern.
  To-day's shame is France's and a Frenchman alone can judge it. Innocent blood
  is on this man's hands, and it is for me to pay the first instalment of
  justice. The rest I leave to God."</p>

  <p>So when an hour later the stunned troopers recovered their senses they
  found a sight which sent them to their knees to patter prayers. For over the
  arch of the bridge dangled the corpse of the Jacobin. And on its breast it
  bore a paper setting forth that this deed had been done by Gaspard de Laval,
  and the Latin words "<i>O si sic omnes!</i>" <a href=
  "#endnote36">[36]</a></p>

  <p>Meantime far up in the folds of the Santerre a little party was moving
  through the hot afternoon. The old Huguenot, shaken still by his rough
  handling, rode as if in a trance. Once he roused himself and asked about the
  monk.</p>

  <p>"I hanged him like a mad dog," said Gaspard.</p>

  <p>The minister shook his head. "Violence will not cure violence."</p>

  <p>"Nay, but justice may follow crime. I am no Nicodemite. This day I have
  made public confession of my faith, and abide the consequences. From this day
  I am an exile from France so long as it pleases God to make His Church an
  anvil for the blows of His enemies."</p>

  <p>"I, too, am an exile," said the old man. "If I come safe to Calais I shall
  take ship for Holland and find shelter with the brethren there. You have
  preserved my life for a few more years in my blaster's vineyard.</p>

  <p>You say truly, young sir, that God's Church is now an anvil, but remember
  for your consolation that it is an anvil which has worn out many
  hammers."</p>

  <p>Late in the evening they came over a ridge and looked down on a shallow
  valley all green and gold in the last light. A slender river twined by alder
  and willow through the meadows. Gaspard reined in his horse and gazed on the
  place with a hand shading his eyes.</p>

  <p>"I have slain a man to my hurt," he said. "See, there are my new fishponds
  half made, and the herb garden, and the terrace that gets the morning sun.
  There is the lawn which I called my quarter-deck, the place to walk of an
  evening. Farewell, my little grey dwelling."</p>

  <p>Champernoun laid a kindly hand on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"We will find you the mate of it in Devon, old friend," he said.</p>

  <p>But Gaspard was not listening. "Eaucourt by the waters," he repeated like
  the refrain of a song, and his eyes were full of tears.</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref9"
     id="ref9"></a>CHAPTER 8</h3>

  <h2>THE HIDDEN CITY</h2>

  <p>The two ports of the cabin were discs of scarlet, that pure translucent
  colour which comes from the reflection of sunset in leagues of still water.
  The ship lay at anchor under the high green scarp of an island, but on the
  side of the ports no land was visible&mdash;only a circle in which sea and
  sky melted into the quintessence of light. The air was very hot and very
  quiet. Inside a lamp had been lit, for in those latitudes night descends like
  a thunderclap. Its yellow glow joined with the red evening to cast orange
  shadows. On the wall opposite the ports was a small stand of arms, and beside
  it a picture of the Magdalen, one of two presented to the ship by Lord
  Huntingdon; the other had been given to the wife of the Governor of Gomera in
  the Canaries when she sent fruit and sugar to the voyagers. Underneath on a
  couch heaped with deerskins lay the Admiral.</p>

  <p>The fantastic light revealed every line of the man as cruelly as spring
  sunshine. It showed a long lean face cast in a high mould of pride. The jaw
  and cheekbones were delicate and hard; the straight nose and the strong arch
  of the brows had the authority of one who all his days had been used to
  command. But age had descended on this pride, age and sickness. The peaked
  beard was snowy white, and the crisp hair had thinned from the forehead. The
  forehead itself was high and broad, crossed with an infinity of small
  furrows. The cheeks were sallow, with a patch of faint colour showing as if
  from a fever. The heavy eyelids were grey like a parrot's. It was the face of
  a man ailing both in mind and body. But in two features youth still lingered.
  The lips under their thatch of white moustache were full and red, and the
  eyes, of some colour between blue and grey, had for all their sadness a
  perpetual flicker of quick fire.</p>

  <p>He shivered, for he was recovering from the fifth fever he had had since
  he left Plymouth. The ailment was influenza, and he called it a calenture. He
  was richly dressed, as was his custom even in outlandish places, and the
  furred robe which he drew closer round his shoulders hid a doublet of fine
  maroon velvet. For comfort he wore a loose collar and band instead of his
  usual cut ruff. He stretched out his hand to the table at his elbow where lay
  the Latin version of his Discovery of Guiana, of which he had been turning
  the pages, and beside it a glass of whisky, almost the last of the thirty-two
  gallon cask which Lord Boyle had given him in Cork on his way out. He
  replenished his glass with water from a silver carafe, and sipped it, for it
  checked his cold rigours. As he set it down he looked up to greet a man who
  had just entered.</p>

  <p>The new-comer was not more than forty years old, like the Admiral, but he
  was lame of his left leg, and held himself with a stoop. His left arm, too
  hung limp and withered by his side. The skin of his face was gnarled like the
  bark of a tree, and seamed with a white scar which drooped over the corner of
  one eye and so narrowed it to half the size of the other. He was the captain
  of Raleigh's flagship, the Destiny, an old seafarer, who in twenty years had
  lived a century of adventure.</p>

  <p>"I wish you good evening, Sir Walter," he said in his deep voice. "They
  tell me the fever is abating."</p>

  <p>The Admiral smiled wanly, and in his smile there was still a trace of the
  golden charm which had once won all men's hearts.</p>

  <p>"My fever will never abate this side the grave," he said. "Jasper, old
  friend, I would have you sit with me tonight. I am like King Saul, the sport
  of devils. Be you my David to exorcise them. I have evil news. Tom Keymis is
  dead."</p>

  <p>The other nodded. Tom Keymis had been dead for ten days, since before they
  left Trinidad. He was aware of the obsession of the Admiral, which made the
  tragedy seem fresh news daily.</p>

  <p>"Dead," said Raleigh. "I slew him by my harshness. I see him stumbling off
  to his cabin, an old bent man, though younger than me. But he failed me. He
  betrayed his trust...  Trust, what does that matter? We are all dying. Old
  Tom has only gone on a little way before the rest. And many went before
  him."</p>

  <p>The voice had become shrill and hard. He was speaking to himself.</p>

  <p>"The best&mdash;the very best. My brave young Walter, and Cosmor and
  Piggot and John Talbot and Ned Coffyn...  Ned was your kinsman, Jasper?"</p>

  <p>"My cousin&mdash;the son of my mother's brother." The man spoke, like
  Raleigh, in a Devon accent, with the creamy slur in the voice and the
  sing-song fall of West England.</p>

  <p>"Ah, I remember. Your mother was Cecily Coffyn, from Combas on the Moor at
  the back of Lustleigh. A pretty girl&mdash;I mind her long ago. I would I
  were on the Moor now, where it is always fresh and blowing...  And your
  father&mdash;the big Frenchman who settled on one of Gawain Champernoun's
  manors. I loved his jolly laugh. But Cecily sobered him, for the Coffyns were
  always a grave and pious race. Gawain is dead these many years. Where is your
  father?</p>

  <p>"He died in '82 with Sir Humfrey Gilbert."</p>

  <p>Raleigh bowed his head. "He went to God with brother Humfrey! Happy fate!
  Happy company! But he left a brave son behind him, and I have lost mine. Have
  you a boy, Jasper?"</p>

  <p>"But the one. My wife died ten years ago come Martinmas. The child is with
  his grandmother on the Moor."</p>

  <p>"A promising child?"</p>

  <p>"A good lad, so far as I have observed him, and that is not once a
  twelvemonth."</p>

  <p>"You are a hungry old sea-dog. That was not the Coffyn fashion. Ned was
  for ever homesick out of sight of Devon. They worshipped their bleak acres
  and their fireside pieties. Ah, but I forget. You are de Laval on one side,
  and that is strong blood. There is not much in England to vie with it. You
  were great nobles when our Cecils were husbandmen."</p>

  <p>He turned on a new tack. "You know that Whitney and Wollaston have
  deserted me. They would have had me turn pirate, and when I refused they
  sailed off and left me. This morning I saw the last of their topsails. Did I
  right?," he asked fiercely.</p>

  <p>"In my judgement you did right."</p>

  <p>"But why&mdash;why?" Raleigh demanded. "I have the commission of the King
  of France. What hindered me to use my remnant like hounds to cut off the
  stragglers of the Plate Fleet? That way lies much gold, and gold will buy
  pardon for all offences. What hindered me, I say?"</p>

  <p>"Yourself, Sir Walter."</p>

  <p>Raleigh let his head fall back on the couch and smiled bitterly.</p>

  <p>"You say truly&mdash;myself. 'Tis not a question of morals, mark ye. A
  better man than I might turn pirate with a clear conscience. But for Walter
  Raleigh it would be black sin. He has walked too brazenly in all weathers to
  seek common ports in a storm...  It becomes not the fortune in which he once
  lived to go journeys of picory <a href="#endnote37">[37]</a>...  And there is
  another reason. I have suddenly grown desperate old. I think I can still
  endure, but I cannot institute. My action is by and over and my passion has
  come."</p>

  <p>"You are a sick man," said the captain with pity in his voice.</p>

  <p>"Sick! Why, yes. But the disease goes very deep. The virtue has gone out
  of me, old comrade. I no longer hate or love, and once I loved and hated
  extremely. I am become like a frail woman for tolerance. Spain has worsted
  me, but I bear her no ill will, though she has slain my son. Yet once I held
  all Spaniards the devil's spawn."</p>

  <p>"You spoke kindly of them in your History," said the other, "when you
  praised their patient virtue."</p>

  <p>"Did I? I have forgot. Nay, I remember. When I wrote that sentence I was
  thinking of Berreo. I loved him, though I took his city. He was a valiant and
  liberal gentleman, and of a great heart. I mind how I combated his
  melancholy, for he was most melancholic. But now I have grown like him.
  Perhaps Sir Edward Coke was right and I have a Spanish heat. I think a man
  cannot strive whole-heartedly with an enemy unless he have much in common
  with him, and as the strife goes on he gets liker...  Ah, Jasper, once I had
  such ambitions that they made a fire all around me. Once I was like Kit
  Marlowe's Tamburlaine:</p>

  <p>"'Threatening the world with high astounding terms, And scourging kingdoms
  with his conquering sword.'</p>

  <p>But now the flame has died and the ashes are cold. And I would not revive
  them if I could. There is nothing under heaven that I desire."</p>

  <p>The seaman's face was grave and kindly.</p>

  <p>"I think you have flown too high, Sir Walter. You have aimed at the moon
  and forgotten the merits of our earthly hills."</p>

  <p>"True, true!" Raleigh's mien was for a moment more lively. "That is a
  shrewd comment. After three-score years I know my own heart. I have been
  cursed with a devil of pride, Jasper...  Man, I have never had a friend.
  Followers and allies and companions, if you please, but no friend.
  Others&mdash;simple folk&mdash; would be set singing by a May morning, or a
  warm tavern fire, or a woman's face. I have known fellows to whom the earth
  was so full of little pleasures that after the worst clouts they rose like
  larks from a furrow. A wise philosophy&mdash;but I had none of it. I saw
  always the little pageant of man's life like a child's peep-show beside the
  dark wastes of eternity. Ah, I know well I struggled like the rest for gauds
  and honours, but they were only tools for my ambition. For themselves I never
  valued them. I aimed at a master-fabric, and since I have failed I have now
  no terrestrial cover."</p>

  <p>The night had fallen black, but the cabin windows were marvellously
  patined by stars. Raleigh's voice had sunk to the hoarse whisper of a man
  still fevered. He let his head recline again on the skins and closed his
  eyelids. Instantly it became the face of an old and very weary man.</p>

  <p>The sailor Jasper Lauval&mdash;for so he now spelled his name on the rare
  occasions when he wrote it&mdash;thought he was about to sleep and was rising
  to withdraw, when Raleigh's eyes opened.</p>

  <p>"Stay with me," he commanded. "Your silence cheers me. If you leave me I
  have thoughts that might set me following Tom Keymis. Kit Marlowe again! I
  cannot get rid of his accursed jingles. How do they go?</p>

  <p class="poem">"'Hell hath no limite, nor is circumscribed<br>
  In one self-place, for where we are is hell<br>
  And where hell is there must we ever be.'"</p>

  <p>Lauval stretched out a cool hand and laid it on the Admiral's hot
  forehead. He had a curiously steadfast gaze for all his drooping left eye.
  Raleigh caught sight of the withered arm.</p>

  <p>"Tell me of your life, Jasper. How came you by such a mauling? Let the
  tale of it be like David's harping and scatter my demons."</p>

  <p>The seaman sat himself in a chair. "That was my purpose, Sir Walter. For
  the tale is in some manner a commentary on your late words."</p>

  <p>"Nay, I want no moral. Let me do the moralising. The tale's the thing.
  See, fill a glass of this Irish cordial. Twill keep off the chill from the
  night air. When and where did you get so woefully battered?"</p>

  <p>"'Twas six years back when I was with Bovill."</p>

  <p>Raleigh whistled. "You were with Robert Bovill' What in Heaven's name did
  one of Coffyn blood with Robert? If ever man had a devil, 'twas he. I mind
  his sullen black face and his beard in two prongs. I have heard he is
  dead&mdash;on a Panama gibbet?"</p>

  <p>"He is dead; but not as he lived. I was present when he died. He went to
  God a good Christian, praying and praising. Next day I was to follow him, but
  I broke prison in the night with the help of an Indian, and went down the
  coast in a stolen patache <a href="#endnote38">[38]</a> to a place where
  thick forests lined the sea. There I lay hid till my wounds healed, and by
  and by I was picked up by a Bristol ship that had put in to water."</p>

  <p>"But your wounds&mdash;how got you them?"</p>

  <p>"At the hands of the priests. They would have made a martyr of me, and
  used their engines to bend my mind. Being obstinate by nature I mocked them
  till they wearied of the play. But they left their marks on this arm and leg.
  The scar I had got some months before in a clean battle."</p>

  <p>"Tell me all. What did Robert Bovill seek? And where?"</p>

  <p>"We sought the Mountain of God," said the seaman reverently.</p>

  <p>"I never heard o't. My own Manoa, maybe, where gold is quarried like
  stone."</p>

  <p>"Nay, not Manoa. The road to it is from the shore of the Mexican gulf.
  There was much gold."</p>

  <p>"You found it?"</p>

  <p>"I found it and handled it. Enough, could we have brought it off, to
  freight a dozen ships. Likewise jewels beyond the imagining of kings."</p>

  <p>Raleigh had raised himself on his elbow, his face sharp and eager.</p>

  <p>I cannot doubt you, for you could not lie were it to win salvation. But,
  heavens! man, what a tale! Why did I not know of this before I broke my
  fortune on Tom Keymis' mine?"</p>

  <p>"I alone know of it, the others being dead."</p>

  <p>"Who first told you of it?"</p>

  <p>"Captain Bovill had the rumour from a dying Frenchman who was landed in
  his last hours at Falmouth. The man mentioned no names, but the tale set the
  captain inquiring and he picked up the clue in Bristol. But 'twas in north
  Ireland that he had the whole truth and a chart of the road."</p>

  <p>"These charts!" sighed Raleigh. "I think the fairies have the making of
  them, for they bewitch sober men. A scrap of discoloured paper and a rag of
  canvas; some quaint lines drawn often in a man's blood, and a cross in a
  corner marking 'much gold.' We mortals are eternally babes, and our heads are
  turned by toys."</p>

  <p>"This chart was no toy, and he who owned it bought it with his life. Nay,
  Sir Walter, I am of your mind. Most charts are playthings from the devil. But
  this was in manner of speaking sent from God. Only we did not read it right.
  We were blind men that thought only of treasure."</p>

  <p>"It is the common story," said Raleigh. "Go on, Jasper."</p>

  <p>"We landed in the Gulf, at the point marked. It was at the mouth of a wide
  river so split up by sand bars that no ship could enter. But by portage and
  hard rowing we got our boats beyond the shoals and found deep water. We had
  learned beforehand that there were no Spanish posts within fifty miles, for
  the land was barren and empty even of Indians. So for ten days we rowed and
  poled through a flat plain, sweating mightily, till we came in sight of
  mountains. At that we looked for more comfort, for the road on our chart now
  led away from the river up a side valley. There we hoped for fruits, since it
  was their season, and for deer; and 'twas time, for our blood was thick with
  rotten victuals."</p>

  <p>The man shivered, as if the recollection had still terrors for him.</p>

  <p>"If ever the Almighty permitted hell on earth 'twas that valley. There was
  no stream in it and no verdure. Oathsome fleshy shrubs, the colour of mouldy
  copper, dotted the slopes, and a wilderness of rocks through which we could
  scarce find a road. There was no living thing in it but carrion birds. And
  serpents. They dwelt in every cranny of stone, and the noise of them was like
  bees humming. We lost two stout fellows from their poison. The sky was brass
  above us and our tongues were dry sticks, and by the foul vapours of the
  place our scanty food was corrupted. Never have men been nearer death. I
  think we would have retreated but for our captain; who had a honest heart. He
  would point out to us the track in the chart running through that accursed
  valley, and at the end the place lettered 'Mountain of God.' I mind how his
  hand shook as he pointed, for he was as sick as any. He was very gentle too,
  though for usual a choleric man."</p>

  <p>"Choleric, verily," said Raleigh. "It must have been no common sufferings
  that tamed Robert Bovill. How long were you in the valley?"</p>

  <p>The better part of three days. 'Twas like sword-cut in a great mountain
  plain, and on the third day we came to a wall of rock which was the head of
  it. This we scaled, how I do not know, by cracks and fissures, the stronger
  dragging up the weaker by means of the tow-rope which by the mercy of God we
  carried with us. There we lost Francis Derrick, who fell a great way and
  crushed his skull on a boulder. You knew the man?"</p>

  <p>"He sailed with me in '95. So that was the end of Francis?"</p>

  <p>"We were now eleven, and two of them dying. Above the rocks on the plain
  we looked for ease, but found none. 'Twas like the bottom of a dry sea, all
  sand and great clefts, and in every hollow monstrous crabs that scattered the
  sand like spindrift as they fled from us. Some of the beasts we slew, and the
  blood of them was green as ooze, and their stench like a charnel house.
  Likewise there were everywhere fat vultures that dropped so close they fanned
  us with their wings. And in some parts there were cracks in the ground
  through which rose the fumes of sulphur that set a man's head reeling."</p>

  <p>Raleigh shivered. "Madre de Dios, you portray the very floor of hell."</p>

  <p>"Beyond doubt the floor of hell. There was but one thing that could get us
  across that devil's land, for our bones were molten with fear. At the end
  rose further hills, and we could see with our eyes they were green...
  Captain Bovill was like one transfigured. 'See,' he cried, 'the Mountain of
  God! Paradise is before you, and the way to Paradise, as is well known, lies
  through the devil's country. A little longer, brave hearts, and we shall be
  in port.' And so fierce was the spirit of that man that it lifted our weary
  shanks and fevered bodies through another two days of torment. I have no
  clear memory of those hours. Assuredly we were all mad and spoke with strange
  voices. My eyes were so gummed together that I had often to tear the lids
  apart to see. But hourly that green hill came nearer, and towards dusk of the
  second day it hung above us. Also we found sweet water, and a multitude of
  creeping vines bearing a wholesome berry. Then as we lay down to sleep, the
  priest came to us."</p>

  <p>Raleigh exclaimed. "What did a priest in those outlands? A Spaniard?"</p>

  <p>"Ay. But not such as you and I have ever known elsewhere. Papegot or no,
  he was a priest of the Most High. He was white and dry as a bone, and his
  eyes burned glassily. Captain Bovill, who liked not the dark brothers, would
  have made him prisoner, for he thought him a forerunner of a Spanish force,
  but he held up a ghostly hand and all of us were struck with a palsy of
  silence. For the man was on the very edge of death.</p>

  <p>"'<i>Moriturus te saluto</i> <a href="#endnote39">[39]</a> ,' he says, and
  then he fell to babbling in Spanish, which we understood the better. Food,
  such as we had, he would not touch, nor the sweet well-water. 'I will drink
  no cup,' he said, 'till I drink the new wine with Christ in His Father's
  Kingdom. For I have seen what mortal eyes have not seen, and I have spoken
  with God's ministers, and am anointed into a new priesthood.'</p>

  <p>"I mind how he sat on the grass, his voice drifting faint and small like a
  babe's crying. He told us nothing of what he was or whence he came, for his
  soul was possessed of a revelation. 'These be the hills of God,' he cried.
  'In a little you will come to a city of the old kings where gold is as
  plentiful as sand of the sea. There they sit frozen in metal waiting the
  judgement. Yet they are already judged, and, I take it, justified, for the
  dead men sit as warders of a greater treasure-house.</p>

  <p>"I think that we eleven&mdash;and two of us near death&mdash;were already
  half out of the body, for weariness and longing shift the mind from its
  moorings. I can hear yet Captain Bovill asking very gently of this greater
  treasure-house, and I can hear the priest, like one in a trance, speaking
  high and strange. 'It is the Mountain of God, he said, 'which lies a little
  way further. There may be seen the heavenly angels ascending and
  descending.'"</p>

  <p>Raleigh shook his head. "Madness, Jasper&mdash;the madness begot of too
  much toil...  I know it...  And yet I do not know. 'Tis not for me to set
  limits to the marvels that are hid in that western land. What next, man?"</p>

  <p>"In the small hours of the morning the priest died. Likewise our two sick.
  We dug graves for them, and the Captain bade me say prayers over them. The
  nine of us left were shaking with a great awe. We felt lifted up in bodily
  strength, as if for a holy labour. Captain Bovill's stout countenance wore an
  air of humility. 'We be dedicate,' he said, 'to some high fortune. Let us go
  humbly and praise God.' The first steps we took that morning we walked like
  men going into church. Up a green valley we journeyed, where every fruit grew
  and choirs of birds sang&mdash;up a crystal river to a cup in the hills. And
  I think there was no one of us but had his mind more on the angels whom the
  priest had told of than on the golden kings."</p>

  <p>Raleigh had raised himself from the couch, and sat with both elbows on the
  table, staring hard at the speaker. "You found them? The gold kings?"</p>

  <p>"We found them. Before noon we came into a city of tombs. Grass grew in
  the streets and courts, and the bronze doors hung broken on their hinges. But
  no wild things had laired there. The place was clean and swept and silent. In
  each dwelling the roof was of beaten gold, and the square pillars were
  covered with gold plates, and where the dead sat was a wilderness of jewels
 ...  I tell you, all the riches that Spain has drawn from all her Indies since
  the first conquistador set foot in them would not vie with the preciousness
  of a single one among those dead kings' houses."</p>

  <p>"And the kings ?" Raleigh interjected.</p>

  <p>"They sat stiff in gold on their thrones, their bodies fashioned in the
  likeness of men. But they had no faces only golden plates set with gems'"</p>

  <p>"What fortune! What fortune! And what did you then?</p>

  <p>"We went mad." The seaman's voice was slow and melancholy. "We, who an
  hour before had been filled with high contemplations, went mad like common
  bravos at the sight of plunder. No man thought of the greater treasure which
  these gold things warded. We laughed and cried like children, and tore at the
  plated dead...  I mind how I wrenched off one jewelled face with the haft of
  my dagger, and a thin trickle of bones fell inside...  And yet, as we ravened
  and plundered we would fall into fits of shivering, for the thing was not of
  this world. Often a man would stop and fall to weeping. But the lust of gold
  consumed us, and presently we only sorrowed because we had no sumpter mules
  to aid its transit, and had a terror of the infernal plain and valley we had
  travelled... </p>

  <p>"Captain Bovill made camp in a mead outside the city, and one of us shot a
  deer, so that we supped full. He unfolded his purpose, which was that we
  should pack about our persons such jewels as were the smallest and most
  precious, and some gold likewise as an earnest, and by striking northward
  through the mountains seek to reach at a higher point in its course the river
  by which we had entered from the sea. I mistrusted the plan, for the chart
  had shown but the one way, but the terror of the road we had come was strong
  on me and I made no protest. So we packed our treasure, so that each man
  staggered under it, and before noon left the place of the kings."</p>

  <p>"And then? Was the road desperate?" Raleigh's pale eyes had the ardour of
  a boy's.</p>

  <p>"Desperate beyond all telling. An escalade of sheer mountains and a
  battling through vales choked with unbelievable thorns. Yet there was water
  and food, and the hardships were not beyond mortal endurance. 'Twas not a
  haunted hell like the way up. Wherefore I knew it would lead us to disaster,
  for 'twas not ordained as the path in the chart had been."</p>

  <p>Raleigh laughed. "Faith, you show your mother's race. All Coffyns have in
  their souls the sour milk of Jean Calvin."</p>

  <p>"Judge if I speak not the truth. Bit by bit we had to cast our burdens
  till only the jewels remained. And on the seventh day, when we were in sight
  of the river, we met a Spanish party, a convoy from their northern mines. We
  marched loosely and blindly, and they came on us unawares. We had all but
  reached the river's brink, so had the stream for a defence on one side, but
  before we knew they had taken us on flank and rear."</p>

  <p>"Many?"</p>

  <p>"A matter of three score, fresh and well armed, against nine weary men
  mortally short of powder. That marked the end of our madness and we became
  again sober Christians. Most notable was Captain Bovill. 'We have seen what
  we have seen,' he told us, as we cast up our defences under Spanish bullets,
  'and none shall wrest the secret from us. If God wills that we perish, 'twill
  perish too. The odds are something heavier than I like, and if the worst
  befall I trust every man to fling into the river what jewels he carries
  sooner than let them become spoil of war. For if they see such preciousness
  they will be fired to inquiry and may haply stumble on our city. Such of us
  as live will some day return there...  I have said we had little powder, but
  for half a day we withstood the assault, and time and again when the enemy
  leapt inside our lines we beat him back. At the end, when hope was gone, you
  would hear little splashes in the waters as this man or that put his
  treasures into eternal hiding. A Spanish sword was like to have cleft my
  skull, but before I lost my senses I noted Captain Bovill tearing the chart
  in shreds and using them to hold down the last charges for his matchlock. He
  was crying, too, in English that some day we would return the road we had
  come."</p>

  <p>"And you returned?"</p>

  <p>The seaman shook his head. Not with earthly feet. Two of us they slew
  outright, and two more died on the way coastwards. For long I was between
  death and life, and knew little till I woke in the Almirante's cell at Panama
 ...  The rest you have heard. Captain Bovill died praising God, and with him
  three stout lads out of Somerset. I escaped and tell you the tale."</p>

  <p>Raleigh meditation. With a sudden motion he rose to his feet and stared
  through the port, which was now tremulous with the fore-glow of the tropic
  dawn. He put his head out and sniffed the sweet cold air. Then he turned to
  his companion.</p>

  <p>"You know the road back to the city?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded. "I alone of men."</p>

  <p>"What hinders, Jasper?" Raleigh's face was sharp and eager, and his eyes
  had the hunger of an old hound on a trail. "They are all deserting me and
  look but to save their throats. Most are scum and have no stomach for great
  enterprises. I can send Herbert home with three shiploads of faint hearts,
  while you and I take the Destiny and steer for fortune. Ned King will
  come&mdash;ay, and Pommerol. What hinders, old friend?"</p>

  <p>The seaman shook his head. "Not for me, Sir Walter."</p>

  <p>"Why, man, will you let that great marvel lie hid till the hills crumble
  and bury it?"</p>

  <p>"I will return&mdash;but not yet. When I have seen my son a man, I go
  back, but I go alone."</p>

  <p>"To the city of the gold kings?"</p>

  <p>"Nay, to the Mount of the Angels, of which the priest told."</p>

  <p>There was silence for a minute. The light dawn wind sent a surge of little
  waves against the ship's side, so that it seemed as if the now flaming sky
  was making its song of morning. Raleigh blew out the flickering lamp, and the
  cabin was filled with a clear green dusk like palest emerald. The air from
  the sea flapped the pages of the book upon the table. He flung off his furred
  gown, and stretched his long arms to the ceiling.</p>

  <p>"I think the fever has left me...  You said your tale was a commentary on
  my confessions. Wherefore, O Ulysses?"</p>

  <p>"We had the chance of immortal joys, but we forsook them for lesser
  things. For that we were thoroughly punished and failed even in our baseness.
  You, too, Sir Walter, have glanced aside after gauds."</p>

  <p>"For certain I have," and Raleigh laughed.</p>

  <p>"Yet not for long. You have cherished most resolutely an elect purpose and
  in that you cannot fail."</p>

  <p>"I know not. I know not. I have had great dreams and I have striven to
  walk in the light of them. But most men call them will o' the wisps, Jasper.
  What have they brought me? I am an old sick man, penniless and disgraced. His
  slobbering Majesty will give me a harsh welcome. For me the Mount of the
  Angels is like to be a scaffold."</p>

  <p>"Even so. A man does not return from those heights. When I find my
  celestial hill I will lay my bones there. But what matters the fate of these
  twisted limbs or even of your comely head: All's one in the end, Sir Walter.
  We shall not die. You have lit a fire among Englishmen which will kindle a
  hundred thousand hearths in a cleaner world."</p>

  <p>Raleigh smiled, sadly yet with a kind of wistful pride.</p>

  <p>"God send it! And you?"</p>

  <p>"I have a son of my body. That which I have sowed he may reap. He or his
  son, or his son's son."</p>

  <p>The morning had grown bright in the little room. Of the two the Admiral
  now looked the younger. The fresh light showed the other like a wrinkled
  piece of driftwood. He rose stiffly and moved towards the door.</p>

  <p>"You have proved my David in good truth," said Raleigh. "This night has
  gone far to heal me in soul and body. Faith, I have a mind to breakfast...
  What a miracle is our ancient England! French sire or no, Jasper, you have
  that slow English patience that is like the patience of God."</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref10"
     id="ref10"></a>CHAPTER 9</h3>

  <h2>THE REGICIDE</h2>

  <p>There was a sharp grue <a href="#endnote40">[40]</a> of ice in the air, as
  Mr. Nicholas Lovel climbed the rickety wooden stairs to his lodgings in
  Chancery Lane hard by Lincoln's Inn. That morning he had ridden in from his
  manor in the Chilterns, and still wore his heavy horseman's cloak and the
  long boots splashed with the mud of the Colne fords. He had been busy all day
  with legal matters&mdash;conveyances on which his opinion was sought, for,
  though it was the Christmas vacation, his fame among the City merchants kept
  him busy in term and out of it. Rarely, he thought, had he known London in so
  strange a temper. Men scarcely dared to speak above their breath of public
  things, and eyed him fearfully&mdash;even the attorneys who licked his
  boots&mdash;as if a careless word spoken in his presence might be their ruin.
  For it was known that this careful lawyer stood very near Cromwell, had
  indeed been his comrade at bed and board from Marston to Dunbar, and, though
  no Commons man, had more weight than any ten in Parliament. Mr. Lovel could
  not but be conscious of the tension among his acquaintances, and had he
  missed to note it there he would have found it in the streets. Pride's
  troopers were everywhere, riding in grim posses or off duty and sombrely
  puffing tobacco, vast, silent men, lean from the wars. The citizens on the
  causeway hurried on their errand, eager to find sanctuary from the biting air
  and the menace of unknown perils. Never had London seen such a Christmastide.
  Every man was moody and careworn, and the bell of Paul's as it tolled the
  hours seemed a sullen prophet of woe.</p>

  <p>His servant met him on the stair.</p>

  <p>"He is here," he said. "I waited for him in the Bell Yard and brought him
  in secretly."</p>

  <p>Lovel nodded, and stripped off his cloak, giving it to the man. "Watch the
  door like a dragon, Matthew," he told him. "For an hour we must be alone.
  Forbid anyone, though it were Sir Harry himself."</p>

  <p>The little chamber was bright with the glow of a coal fire. The red
  curtains had been drawn and one lamp lit. The single occupant sprawled in a
  winged leather chair, his stretched-out legs in the firelight, but his head
  and shoulders in shadow. A man entering could not see the face, and Lovel,
  whose eyes had been weakened by study, peered a second before he closed the
  door behind him.</p>

  <p>"I have come to you, Nick, as always when my mind is in tribulation."</p>

  <p>The speaker had a harsh voice, like a bellman's which has been ruined by
  shouting against crowds. He had got to his feet and seemed an elderly man,
  heavy in body, with legs too short for the proportions of his trunk. He wore
  a soldier's coat and belt, but no sword. His age might have been fifty, but
  his face was so reddened by weather that it was hard to judge. The thick
  straight black locks had little silver in them, but the hair that sprouted
  from a mole on the chin was grey. His cheeks were full and the heavy mouth
  was pursed like that of a man in constant painful meditation. He looked at
  first sight a grazier from the shires or some new-made squire of a moderate
  estate. But the eyes forbade that conclusion. There was something that
  brooded and commanded in those eyes, something that might lock the jaw like
  iron and make their possessor a hammer to break or bend the world.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lovel stirred the fire very deliberately and sat himself in the second
  of the two winged chairs.</p>

  <p>"The King?" he queried. "You were in two minds when we last spoke on the
  matter. I hoped I had persuaded you. Has some new perplexity arisen?"</p>

  <p>The other shook his big head, so that for a moment he had the look of a
  great bull that paws the ground before charging.</p>

  <p>"I have no clearness," he said, and the words had such passion behind them
  that they were almost a groan.</p>

  <p>Lovel lay back in his chair with his finger tips joined, like a
  jurisconsult in the presence of a client. "Clearness in such matters is not
  for us mortals," he said. "You are walking dark corridors which the lamp of
  the law does not light. You are not summoned to do justice, being no judge,
  but to consider the well-being of the State. Policy, Oliver. Policy, first
  and last."</p>

  <p>The other nodded. "But policy is two-faced, and I know not which to
  choose."</p>

  <p>"Is it still the business of the trial?" Lovel asked sharply. "We argued
  that a fortnight since, and I thought I had convinced you. The case has not
  changed. Let me recapitulate. Imprimis, the law of England knows no court
  which can bring the King of England before it."</p>

  <p>"Tchut, man. Do not repeat that. Vane has been clacking it in my ear. I
  tell you, as I told young Sidney, that we are beyond courts and lawyer's
  quibbles, and that if England requires it I will cut off the King's head with
  the crown on it."</p>

  <p>Lovel smiled. "That is my argument. You speak of a trial, but in justice
  there can be no trial where there is neither constituted court nor valid law.
  If you judge the King, 'tis on grounds of policy. Can you defend that policy,
  Oliver? You yourself have no clearness. Who has; Not Vane. Not Fairfax. Not
  Whitelocke, or Widdrington, or Lenthall. Certes, not your old comrade Nick
  Lovel."</p>

  <p>"The Army desires it&mdash;notably those in it who are most earnest in
  God's cause."</p>

  <p>"Since when have you found a politic judgement in raw soldiers? Consider,
  my friend. If you set the King on his trial it can have but the one end. You
  have no written law by which to judge him, so your canon will be your view of
  the public weal, against which he has most grievously offended. It is
  conceded Your verdict must be guilty and your sentence death. Once put him on
  trial and you unloose a great stone in a hill-side which will gather speed
  with every yard it journeys. You will put your King to death, and in whose
  name?</p>

  <p>Cromwell raised his head which he had sunk between his hands. "In the name
  of the Commons of Parliament and all the good people of England."</p>

  <p>Folly, man. Your Commons are a disconsidered rump of which already you
  have made a laughingstock. As for your good people of England, you know well
  that ten out of any dozen are against you. The deed will be done in your own
  name and that of the hotheads of the Army. 'Twill be an act of war. Think you
  that by making an end of the King you will end the Kings party? Nay, you will
  give it a martyr. You will create for every woman in England a new saint. You
  will outrage all sober folk that love order and at the very moment when you
  seek to lay down the sword you make it the sole arbitrament. What say you to
  that?"</p>

  <p>"There is no need to speak of his death. What if the Court depose him
  only?"</p>

  <p>"You deceive yourself. Once put him on trial and you must go through with
  it to the end. A deposed king will be like a keg of gunpowder set by your
  hearth. You cannot hide him so that he ceases to be a peril. You cannot bind
  him to terms."</p>

  <p>"That is naked truth," said Cromwell grimly. "The man is filled with a
  devil of pride. When Denbigh and the other lords went to him he shut the door
  in their face. I will have no more of ruining hypocritical agreements. If
  God's poor people are to be secure we must draw his fangs and destroy his
  power for ill. But how to do it?" And he made a gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>"A way must be found. And let it not be that easy way which will most
  utterly defeat your honest purpose. The knots of the State are to be
  unravelled, not cut with the sword."</p>

  <p>Cromwell smiled sadly, and his long face had for the moment a curious look
  of a puzzled child.</p>

  <p>"I believe you to be a godly man, friend Nicholas. But I fear your soul is
  much overlaid with worldly things, and you lean too much on frail
  understanding. I, too, am without clearness. I assent to your wisdom, but I
  cannot think it concludes the matter. In truth, we have come in this dark
  hour to the end of fleshly reasonings. It cannot be that the great marvels
  which the Lord has shown us can end in barrenness. His glorious dispensations
  must have an honest fruition, for His arm is not shortened."</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet and tightened the belt which he had unbuckled. "I
  await a sign," he said. "Pray for me, friend, for I am a man in sore
  perplexity. I lie o' nights at Whitehall in one of the King's rich beds, but
  my eyes do not close. From you I have got the ripeness of human wisdom, but
  my heart is not satisfied. I am a seeker, with my ear intent to hear God's
  command, and I doubt not that by some providence He will yet show me His
  blessed way."</p>

  <p>Lovel stood as if in a muse while the heavy feet tramped down the
  staircase. He heard a whispering below and then the soft closing of a door.
  For maybe five minutes he was motionless: then he spoke to himself after the
  habit he had. "The danger is not over," he said, "but I think policy will
  prevail. If only Vane will cease his juridical chatter...  Oliver is still at
  the cross-roads, but he inclines to the right one...  I must see to it that
  Hugh Peters and his crew manufacture no false providences. Thank God, if our
  great man is one-third dreamer, he is two-thirds doer, and can weigh his
  counsellors."</p>

  <p>Whereupon, feeling sharp-set with the cold and the day's labour, he
  replenished the fire with a beech faggot, resumed the riding cloak he had
  undone and, after giving his servant some instructions, went forth to sup in
  a tavern. He went unattended, as was his custom. The city was too sunk in
  depression to be unruly.</p>

  <p>He crossed Chancery Lane and struck through the narrow courts which lay
  between Fleet Street and Holborn. His goal was Gilpin's in Fetter Lane, a
  quiet place much in favour with those of the long robe. The streets seemed
  curiously quiet. It was freezing hard and threatening snow, so he flung a
  fold of his cloak round his neck, muffling his ears. This deadened his
  hearing, and his mind also was busy with its own thoughts, so that he did not
  observe that soft steps dogged him. At the corner of an alley he was tripped
  up, and a heavy garment flung over his head. He struggled to regain his feet,
  but an old lameness, got at Naseby, impeded him. The cobbles, too, were like
  glass, and he fell again, this time backward. His head struck the ground, and
  though he did not lose consciousness, his senses were dazed. He felt his legs
  and arms being deftly tied, and yards of some soft stuff enveloping his head.
  He ceased to struggle as soon as he felt the odds against him, and waited on
  fortune. Voices came to his ears, and it seemed that one of them was a
  woman's.</p>

  <p>The crack on the causeway must have been harder than it appeared, for Mr.
  Lovel fell into a doze. When he woke he had some trouble in collecting his
  wits. He felt no bodily discomfort except a little soreness at the back of
  his scalp. His captors had trussed him tenderly, for his bonds did not hurt,
  though a few experiments convinced him that they were sufficiently secure.
  His chief grievance was a sharp recollection that he had not supped; but,
  being a philosopher, he reflected that, though hungry, he was warm. He was in
  a glass coach driven rapidly on a rough road, and outside the weather seemed
  to be wild, for the snow was crusted on the window. There were riders in
  attendance; he could hear the click-clack of ridden horses. Sometimes a
  lantern flashed on the pane, and a face peered dimly through the frost. It
  seemed a face that he had seen before.</p>

  <p>Presently Mr. Lovel began to consider his position. Clearly he had been
  kidnapped, but by whom and to what intent? He reflected with pain that it
  might be his son's doing, for that gentleman had long been forbidden his
  door. A rakehell of the Temple and married to a cast-off mistress of
  Goring's, his son was certainly capable of any evil, but he reminded himself
  that Jasper was not a fool and would scarcely see his profit in such an
  escapade. Besides, he had not the funds to compass an enterprise which must
  have cost money. He thought of the King's party, and dismissed the thought.
  His opponents had a certain regard for him, and he had the name of moderate.
  No, if politics touched the business, it was Ireton's doing. Ireton feared
  his influence with Cromwell. But that sober man of God was no bravo. He
  confessed himself at a loss.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lovel had reached this point in his meditations when the coach
  suddenly stopped. The door opened, and as he peered into the semicircle of
  wavering lamp light he observed a tall young lady in a riding coat white with
  snowflakes. She had dismounted from her horse, and the beast's smoking
  nostrils were thawing the ice on her sleeve. She wore a mask, but she did not
  deceive her father.</p>

  <p>"Cecily," he cried, astounded out of his calm. "What madcap trick is
  this?"</p>

  <p>The girl for answer flung her bridle to a servant and climbed into the
  coach beside him. Once more the wheels moved.</p>

  <p>"Oh, father, dearest father, pray forgive me. I have been so anxious. When
  you fell I begged Tony to give up the plan, but he assured me you had taken
  no hurt. Tell me you are none the worse."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lovel began to laugh, and there was relief in his laugh, for he had
  been more disquieted than he would have confessed.</p>

  <p>"I am very greatly the worse.!" He nodded to his bonds. "I do not like
  your endearments, Cis."</p>

  <p>"Promise me not to try to escape, and I will cut them." The girl was very
  grave as she drew from a reticule beneath her cloak a pair of housewife's
  scissors.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lovel laughed louder. "I promise to bide where I am in this foul
  weather."</p>

  <p>Neatly and swiftly she cut the cords and he stretched arms and legs in
  growing comfort.</p>

  <p>"Also I have not supped."</p>

  <p>"My poor father. But in two hours' time you will have supper. We sleep
  at&mdash;but that I must not say."</p>

  <p>"Where does this journey end? Am I to have no news at all, my dear?"</p>

  <p>"You promised, remember, so I will tell you. Tony and I are taking you to
  Chastlecote."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lovel whistled. "A long road and an ill. The wind blows bitter on
  Cotswold in December. I would be happier in my own house."</p>

  <p>"But not safe." The girl's voice was very earnest. "Believe me, dearest
  father, we have thought only of you. Tony says that London streets will soon
  be running blood. He has it from secret and sure sources. There is a King's
  faction in the Army and already it is in league with the Scots and our own
  party to compass the fall of Cromwell. He says it will be rough work and the
  innocent will die with the guilty...  When he told me that, I feared for your
  life&mdash;and Tony, too, for he loves you. So we carry you to Chastlecote
  till January is past, for by then Tony says there will be peace in
  England."</p>

  <p>"I thank you, Cis,&mdash;and Tony also, who loves me. But if your news be
  right, I have a duty to do. I am of Cromwell's party, as you and Tony are of
  the King's. You would not have me run from danger."</p>

  <p>She primmed her pretty mouth. "You do not run, you are carried off.
  Remember your promise."</p>

  <p>"But a promise given under duress is not valid in law."</p>

  <p>"You are a gentleman, sir, before you are a lawyer. Besides, there are six
  of Tony's men with us&mdash;and all armed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lovel subsided with a chuckle. This daughter of his should have been a
  man. Would that Heaven had seen fit to grant him such a son!</p>

  <p>Two hours to supper," was what he said. "By the slow pace of our cattle I
  judge we are on Denham hill. Permit me to doze, my dear. 'Tis the best
  antidote to hunger. Whew, but it is cold! If you catch a quinsy, blame that
  foolish Tony of yours."</p>

  <p>But, though he closed his eyes, he did not sleep. All his life he had been
  something of a fatalist, and this temper had endeared him to Cromwell, who
  held that no man travelled so far as he who did not know the road he was
  going. But while in Oliver's case the belief came from an ever-present sense
  of a directing God, in him it was more of a pagan philosophy. Mr. Lovel was
  devout after his fashion, but he had a critical mind and stood a little apart
  from enthusiasm. He saw man's life as a thing foreordained, yet to be
  conducted under a pretence of freedom, and while a defender of liberty his
  admiration inclined more naturally to the rigour of law. He would oppose all
  mundane tyrannies, but bow to the celestial bondage.</p>

  <p>Now it seemed that fate had taken charge of him through the medium of two
  green lovers. He was to be spared the toil of decision and dwell in an
  enforced seclusion. He was not averse to it. He was not Cromwell with
  Cromwell's heavy burden; he was not even a Parliament man; only a private
  citizen who wished greatly for peace. He had laboured for peace both in field
  and council, and that very evening he had striven to guide the ruler of
  England. Assuredly he had done a citizen's duty and might now rest.</p>

  <p>His thoughts turned to his family&mdash;the brave girl and the worthless
  boy. He believed he had expunged Jasper from his mind, but the recollection
  had still power to pain him. That was the stuff of which the King's faction
  was made, half-witted rakes who were arrogant without pride and volcanic
  without courage...  Not all, perhaps. The good Tony was a welcome enough
  son-in-law, though Cecily would always be the better man. The young
  Oxfordshire squire was true to his own royalties, and a mortal could be no
  more. He liked the flaxen poll of him, which contrasted well with Cecily's
  dark beauty&mdash;and his jolly laugh and the noble carriage of his head. Yet
  what wisdom did that head contain which could benefit the realm of
  England?</p>

  <p>This story of a new plot! Mr. Lovel did not reject it. It was of a piece
  with a dozen crazy devices of the King. The man was no Englishman, but an
  Italian priest who loved dark ways. A little good sense, a little honesty,
  and long ago there would have been a settlement. But to treat with Charles
  was to lay foundations on rotten peat.</p>

  <p>Oddly enough, now that he was perforce quit of any share in the business,
  he found his wrath rising against the King. A few hours back he had spoken
  for him. Had he after all been wrong? He wondered. Oliver's puzzled face rose
  before him. He had learned to revere that strange man's perplexities. No
  brain was keener to grasp an argument, for the general was as quick at a
  legal point as any lawyer. When, therefore, he still hesitated before what
  seemed a final case, it was well to search for hidden flaws. Above all when
  he gave no reason it was wise to hasten to him, for often his mind flew ahead
  of logic, and at such times he was inspired. Lovel himself and Vane and
  Fairfax had put the politic plea which seemed unanswerable, and yet Oliver
  halted and asked for a sign. Was it possible that the other course, the wild
  course, Ireton's course, was the right one?</p>

  <p>Mr. Lovel had bowed to fate and his captors, and conscious that no action
  could follow on any conclusion he might reach, felt free to indulge his
  thoughts. He discovered these growing sterner. He reviewed his argument
  against the King's trial. Its gravamen lay in the certainty that trial meant
  death. The plea against death was that it would antagonise three-fourths of
  England, and make a martyr out of a fool. Would it do no more? Were there no
  gains to set against that loss? To his surprise he found himself confessing a
  gain.</p>

  <p>He had suddenly become impatient with folly. It was Cromwell's mood, as
  one who, living under the eye of God, scorned the vapourings of pedestalled
  mortals. Mr. Lovel by a different road reached the same goal. An abiding
  sense of fate ordering the universe made him intolerant of trivial claims of
  prerogative and blood. Kingship for him had no sanctity save in so far as it
  was truly kingly. Were honest folk to be harried because of the whims of a
  man whose remote ancestor had been a fortunate bandit? Charles had time and
  again broke faith with his people and soaked the land in blood. In law he
  could do no wrong, but, unless God slept, punishment should follow the crime,
  and if the law gave no aid the law must be dispensed with. Man was not made
  for it, but it for man.</p>

  <p>The jurist in him pulled up with a start. He was arguing against all his
  training...  But was the plea false? He had urged on Cromwell that the matter
  was one of policy. Agreed. But which was the politic road? If the King lost
  his head, there would beyond doubt be a sullen struggle ahead. Sooner or
  later the regicides would fall&mdash;of that he had no doubt. But what of the
  ultimate fate of England? They would have struck a blow against privilege
  which would never be forgotten. In future all kings would walk warily. In
  time the plain man might come to his own. In the long run was not this
  politic?</p>

  <p>"'Tis a good thing my mouth is shut for some weeks," he told himself. "I
  am coming round to Ireton. I am no fit company for Oliver."</p>

  <p>He mused a little on his inconstancy. It had not been a frequent
  occurrence in his life. But now he seemed to have got a sudden illumination,
  such as visited Cromwell in his prayers. He realised how it had come about.
  Hitherto he had ridden his thoughts unconsciously on the curb of caution, for
  a conclusion reached meant deeds to follow. But, with the possibility of
  deeds removed, his mind had been freed. What had been cloudy before now
  showed very bright, and the little lamp of reason he had once used was put
  out by an intolerable sunlight. He felt himself quickened to an unwonted
  poetry...  His whole outlook had changed, but the change brought no impulse
  to action. He submitted to be idle, since it was so fated. He was rather glad
  of it, for he felt weary and giddy in mind.</p>

  <p>But the new thoughts once awakened ranged on their courses. To destroy the
  false kingship would open the way for the true. He was no leveller; he
  believed in kings who were kings in deed. The world could not do without its
  leaders. Oliver was such a one, and others would rise up. Why reverence a
  brocaded puppet larded by a priest with oil, when there were men who needed
  no robes or sacring <a href="#endnote41">[41]</a> to make them kingly? Teach
  the Lord's Anointed his mortality, and there would be hope in the years to
  come of a true anointing.</p>

  <p>He turned to his daughter.</p>

  <p>"I believe your night's work, Cis, has been a fortunate thing for our
  family."</p>

  <p>She smiled and patted his hand, and at the moment with a great jolting the
  coach pulled up. Presently lanterns showed at the window, the door was
  opened, and Sir Anthony Colledge stood revealed in the driving snow. In the
  Chilterns it must have been falling for hours, for the road was a foot deep,
  and the wind had made great drifts among the beech boles. The lover looked
  somewhat sheepish as he swept a bow to his prisoner.</p>

  <p>"You are a noted horse-doctor, sir," he said. "The off leader has gotten a
  colic. Will you treat him? Then I purpose to leave him with a servant in some
  near-by farm, and put a ridden horse in his place."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lovel leaped from the coach as nimbly as his old wound permitted. It
  was true that the doctoring of horses was his hobby. He loved them and had a
  way with them.</p>

  <p>The medicine box was got out of the locker and the party grouped round the
  grey Flemish horses, which stood smoking in the yellow slush. The one with
  the colic had its legs stretched wide; its flanks heaved and spasms shook its
  hindquarters. Mr. Lovel set to work and mixed which a dose of spiced oil and
  spirits which he coaxed down its throat. Then he very gently massaged certain
  corded sinews in its belly. "Get him under cover now, Tony," he said ``and
  tell your man to bed him warm and give him a bucket of hot water strained
  from oatmeal and laced with this phial. In an hour he will be easy."</p>

  <p>The beast was led off, another put in its place, and the postilions were
  cracking their whips, when out of the darkness a knot of mounted men rode
  into the lamplight. There were at least a dozen of them, and at their head
  rode a man who at the sight of Lovel pulled up sharp.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lovel!" he cried. "What brings you into these wilds in such weather?
  Can I be of service? My house is not a mile off."</p>

  <p>"I thank you, Colonel Flowerdue, but I think the mischief is now righted.
  I go on a journey into Oxfordshire with my daughter, and the snow has delayed
  us."</p>

  <p>He presented the young Parliament soldier, a cousin of Fairfax, to Cecily
  and Tony, the latter of whom eyed with disfavour the posse of grave Ironside
  troopers.</p>

  <p>"You will never get to Wendover this night," said Flowerdue. "The road
  higher up is smothered four feet deep. See, I will show you a woodland road
  which the wind has kept clear, and I protest that your company sleep the
  night with me at Downing."</p>

  <p>He would take no denial, and indeed in the face of his news to proceed
  would have been folly. Even Sir Anthony Colledge confessed it wryly. One of
  Flowerdue's men mounted to the postilion's place, and the coach was guided
  through a belt of beeches, and over a strip of heath to the gates of a
  park.</p>

  <p>Cecily seized her father's hand. "You have promised, remember."</p>

  <p>"I have promised," he replied. "To-morrow, if the weather clears, I will
  go with you to Chastlecote."</p>

  <p>He spoke no more till they were at the house door, for the sense of fate
  hung over him like a cloud. His cool equable soul was stirred to its depths.
  There was surely a grim fore-ordering in this chain of incidents. But for the
  horse's colic there would have been no halt. But for his skill in horse
  doctoring the sick beast would have been cut loose, and Colonel Flowerdue's
  party would have met only a coach labouring through the snow and would not
  have halted to discover its occupants...  He was a prisoner bound by a
  promise, but this meeting with Flowerdue had opened up a channel to
  communicate with London and that was not forbidden. It flashed on him
  suddenly that the change of mind which he had suffered was no longer a
  private matter. He had now the power to act upon it.</p>

  <p>He was extraordinarily averse to the prospect. Was it mere petulance that
  had swung round his opinions so violently during the journey? He examined
  himself and found his new convictions unshaken. It was what the
  hot-gospellers would call a "Holy Ghost conversion." Well, let it rest there.
  Why spread the news beyond his own home? There were doctors enough inspecting
  the health of the State. Let his part be to stand aside.</p>

  <p>With something like fear he recognised that that part was no longer
  possible. He had been too directly guided by destiny to refuse the last
  stage. Cromwell was waiting on a providence, and of that providence it was
  clear that fate had made him the channel. In the coach he had surrendered
  himself willingly to an unseen direction, and now he dared not refuse the
  same docility. He, who for usual was ripe, balanced, mellow in judgement,
  felt at the moment the gloomy impulsion of the fanatic. He was only a pipe
  for the Almighty to sound through.</p>

  <p>In the hall at Downing the logs were stirred to a blaze, and food and
  drink brought in a hospitable stir.</p>

  <p>"I have a letter to write before I sleep," Mr. Lovel told his daughter. "I
  will pray from Colonel Flowerdue the use of his cabinet."</p>

  <p>Cecily looked at him inquiringly, and he laughed.</p>

  <p>"The posts at Chastlecote are infrequent, Cis, and I may well take the
  chance when it offers. I assure you I look forward happily to a month of
  idleness stalking Tony's mallards and following Tony's hounds."</p>

  <p>In the cabinet he wrote half a dozen lines setting out simply the change
  in his views. "If I know Oliver," he told himself, "I have given him the sign
  he seeks. I am clear it is God's will, but Heaven help the land&mdash;Heaven
  help us all." Having written, he lay back in his chair and mused.</p>

  <p>When Colonel Flowerdue entered he found a brisk and smiling gentleman,
  sealing a letter.</p>

  <p>"Can you spare a man to ride express with this missive to town? It is for
  General Cromwell's private hand."</p>

  <p>"Assuredly. He will start at once lest the storm worsens. It is business
  of State?"</p>

  <p>"High business of State, and I think the last I am likely to meddle
  with."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lovel had taken from his finger a thick gold ring carved with a
  much-worn cognisance. He held it up in the light of the candle.</p>

  <p>"This thing was once a king's," he said. "As the letter touches the
  affairs of his Majesty, I think it fitting to seal it with a king's
  signet."</p><br>

  <h2>THE MARPLOT</h2>

  <p>At a little after six o'clock on the evening of Saturday, 12th October, in
  the year 1678, the man known commonly as Edward Copshaw came to a halt
  opposite the narrow entry of the Savoy, just west of the Queen's palace of
  Somerset House. He was a personage of many names. In the register of the
  Benedictine lay-brothers he had been entered as James Singleton. Sundry Paris
  tradesmen had known him as Captain Edwards, and at the moment were longing to
  know more of him. In a certain secret and tortuous correspondence he figured
  as Octavius, and you may still read his sprawling script in the Record
  Office. His true name, which was Nicholas Lovel, was known at Weld House, at
  the White Horse Tavern, and the town lodgings of my lords Powis and Bellasis,
  but had you asked for him by that name at these quarters you would have been
  met by a denial of all knowledge. For it was a name which for good reasons he
  and his patrons desired to have forgotten.</p>

  <p>He was a man of not yet forty, furtive, ill-looking and lean to
  emaciation. In complexion he was as swarthy as the King, and his feverish
  black eyes were set deep under his bushy brows. A badly dressed peruke
  concealed his hair. His clothes were the remnants of old finery, well cut and
  of good stuff, but patched and threadbare. He wore a sword, and carried a
  stout rustic staff. The weather was warm for October, and the man had been
  walking fast, for, as he peered through the autumn brume into the dark entry,
  he mopped his face with a dirty handkerchief.</p>

  <p>The exercise had brought back his ailment and he shivered violently.
  Punctually as autumn came round he had these fevers, the legacy of a year
  once spent in the Pisan marshes. He had doped himself with Jesuits' powder
  got from a woman of Madame Carwell's, so that he was half deaf and blind. Yet
  in spite of the drug the fever went on burning.</p>

  <p>But to anyone looking close it would have seemed that he had more to
  trouble him than a malarial bout. The man was patently in an extreme terror.
  His lantern-jaw hung as loose as if it had been broken. His lips moved
  incessantly. He gripped savagely at his staff, and next moment dropped it. He
  fussed with the hilt of his sword...  He was a coward, and yet had come out
  to do murder.</p>

  <p>It had taken real panic to bring him to the point. Throughout his tattered
  life he had run many risks, but never a peril so instant as this. As he had
  followed his quarry that afternoon his mind had been full of broken memories.
  Bitter thoughts they were, for luck had not been kind to him. A childhood in
  cheap lodgings in London and a dozen French towns, wherever there was a
  gaming-table and pigeons for his father to pluck. Then drunken father and
  draggletailed mother had faded from the scene, and the boy had been left to a
  life of odd jobs and fleeting patrons. His name was against him, for long
  before he reached manhood the King had come back to his own, and his
  grandfather's bones had jangled on a Tyburn gibbet. There was no hope for one
  of his family, though Heaven knew his father had been a stout enough
  Royalist. At eighteen the boy had joined the Roman Church, and at twenty
  relapsed to the fold of Canterbury. But his bread-and-butter lay with Rome,
  and in his trade few questions were asked about creed provided the work were
  done. He had had streaks of fortune, for there had been times when he lay
  soft and ate delicately and scattered money. But nothing lasted. He had no
  sooner made purchase with a great man and climbed a little than the
  scaffolding fell from his feet. He thought meanly of human nature for in his
  profess he must cringe or snarl, always the undermost dog. Yet he had some
  liking for the priests, who had been kind to him, and there was always a glow
  in his heart for the pale wife who dwelt with his child in the attic in
  Billingsgate. Under happier circumstances Mr. Nicholas Lovel might have shone
  with the domestic virtues.</p>

  <p>Business had been good of late, if that could ever be called good which
  was undertaken under perpetual fear. He had been given orders which took him
  into Whig circles, and had made progress among the group of the King's Head
  Tavern. He had even won an entrance into my Lord Shaftesbury's great house in
  Aldersgate Street. He was there under false colours, being a spy of the other
  camp, but something in him found itself at home among the patriots. A resolve
  had been growing to cut loose from his old employers and settle down among
  the Whigs in comparative honesty. It was the winning cause, he thought, and
  he longed to get his head out of the kennels...  But that had happened
  yesterday which scattered his fine dreams and brought him face to face with
  terror. God's curse on that ferrety Justice, Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey.</p>

  <p>He had for some time had his eye on the man. The year before he had run
  across him in Montpelier, being then engaged in a very crooked business, and
  had fancied that the magistrate had also his eye on him. Taught by long
  experience to watch potential enemies, he had taken some trouble over the
  lean high-beaked dignitary. Presently he had found out curious things. The
  austere Protestant was a friend of the Duke's man, Ned Coleman, and used to
  meet him at Colonel Weldon's house. This hinted at blackmailable stuff in the
  magistrate, so Lovel took to haunting his premises in Hartshorn Lane by
  Charing Cross, but found no evidence which pointed to anything but a
  prosperous trade in wood and sea-coal. Faggots, but not the treasonable kind!
  Try as he might, he could-get no farther with that pillar of the magistracy,
  my Lord Danly's friend, the beloved of Aldermen. He hated his solemn face,
  his prim mouth, his condescending stoop. Such a man was encased in proof
  armour of public esteem, and he heeded Mr. Lovel no more than the rats in the
  gutter.</p>

  <p>But the day before had come a rude awakening. All this talk of a Popish
  plot, discovered by the Salamanca Doctor, promised a good harvest to Mr.
  Lovel. He himself had much to tell and more to invent. Could he but manage it
  discreetly, he might assure his fortune with the Whigs and get to his feet at
  last. God knew it was time, for the household in the Billingsgate attic was
  pretty threadbare. His busy brain had worked happily on the plan. He would be
  the innocent, cursed from childhood with undesired companions, who would
  suddenly awaken in horror to the guilt of things he had not understood. There
  would be a welcome for a well-informed penitent...  But he must move slowly
  and at his own time...  And now he was being himself hustled into the dock,
  perhaps soon to the gallows.</p>

  <p>For the afternoon before he had been sent for by Godfrey and most
  searchingly examined. He had thought himself the spy, when all the while he
  had been the spied upon. The accursed Justice knew everything. He knew a
  dozen episodes each enough to hang a poor man. He knew of Mr. Lovel's
  dealings with the Jesuits Walsh and Phayre, and of a certain little hovel in
  Battersea whose annals were not for the public ear. Above all, he knew of the
  great Jesuit consult in April at the Duke of York's house. That would have
  mattered little&mdash;indeed the revelation of it was part of Mr. Lovel's
  plans&mdash;but he knew Mr. Lovel's precise connection with it, and had
  damning evidence to boot. The spy shivered when he remembered the scene in
  Hartshorn Lane. He had blundered and stuttered and confessed his alarm by his
  confusion, while the Justice recited what he had fondly believed was known
  only to the Almighty and some few whose mortal interest it was to be silent
 ...  He had been amazed that he had not been there and then committed to
  Newgate. He had not gone home that night, but wandered the streets and slept
  cold under a Marylebone hedge. At first he had thought of flight, but the
  recollection of his household detained him. He would not go under. One
  pompous fool alone stood between him and safety&mdash;perhaps fortune. Long
  before morning he had resolved that Godfrey should die.</p>

  <p>He had expected a difficult task, but lo! it was unbelievably easy. About
  ten o'clock that day he had found Sir Edmund in the Strand. He walked
  hurriedly as if on urgent business, and Lovel had followed him up through
  Covent Garden, across the Oxford road, and into the Marylebone fields. There
  the magistrate's pace had slackened, and he had loitered like a truant
  schoolboy among the furze and briars. His stoop had deepened, his head was
  sunk on his breast, his hands twined behind him.</p>

  <p>Now was the chance for the murderer lurking in the brambles. It would be
  easy to slip behind and give him the sword-point. But Mr. Lovel tarried. It
  may have been compunction, but more likely it was fear. It was also
  curiosity, for the magistrate's face, as he passed Lovel's hiding-place, was
  distraught and melancholy. Here was another man with bitter
  thoughts&mdash;perhaps with a deadly secret. For a moment the spy felt a
  certain kinship.</p>

  <p>Whatever the reason he let the morning go by. About two in the afternoon
  Godfrey left the fields and struck westward by a bridle-path that led through
  the Paddington Woods to the marshes north of Kensington. He walked slowly,
  but with an apparent purpose. Lovel stopped for a moment at the White House,
  a dirty little hedge tavern, to swallow a mouthful of ale, and tell a
  convincing lie to John Rawson, the innkeeper, in case it should come in handy
  some day. Then occurred a diversion. Young Mr. Forset's harriers swept past,
  a dozen riders attended by a ragged foot following. They checked by the path,
  and in the confusion of the halt Godfrey seemed to vanish. It was not till
  close on Paddington village that Mr. Lovel picked him up again. He was
  waiting for the darkness, for he knew that he could never do what he purposed
  in cold daylight. He hoped that the magistrate would make for Kensington, for
  that was a lonely path.</p>

  <p>But Sir Edmund seemed to be possessed of a freakish devil. No sooner was
  he in Paddington than, after buying a glass of milk from a milk-woman, he set
  off citywards again by the Oxford road. Here there were many people, foot
  travellers and coaches, and Mr. Lovel began to fear for his chance. But at
  Tyburn Godfrey struck into the fields and presently was in the narrow lane
  called St. Martin's Hedges, which led to Charing Cross. Now was the occasion.
  The dusk was falling, and a light mist was creeping up from Westminster.
  Lovel quickened his steps, for the magistrate was striding at a round pace.
  Then came mischance. First one, then another of the Marylebone cow-keepers
  blocked the lane with their driven beasts. The place became as public as
  Bartholomew's Fair. Before he knew it he was at Charing Cross.</p>

  <p>He was now in a foul temper. He cursed his weakness in the morning, when
  fate had given him every opportunity. He was in despair too. His case was
  hopeless unless he struck soon. If Godfrey returned to Hartshorn Lane he
  himself would be in Newgate on the morrow...  Fortunately the strange man did
  not seem to want to go home. He moved east along the Strand, Lovel a dozen
  yards behind him.</p>

  <p>Out from the dark Savoy entry ran a woman, screaming, and with her hair
  flying. She seized on Godfrey and clutched his knees. There was a bloody fray
  inside, in which her husband fought against odds. The watch was not to be
  found. Would he, the great magistrate, intervene? The very sight of his
  famous face would quell riot.</p>

  <p>Sir Edmund looked up and down the street, pinched his chin and peered down
  the precipitous Savoy causeway. Whatever the burden on his soul he did not
  forget his duty.</p>

  <p>"Show me," he said, and followed her into the gloom.</p>

  <p>Lovel outside stood for a second hesitating. His chance had come. His foe
  had gone of his own will into the place in all England where murder could be
  most safely done. But now that the moment had come at last, he was all of a
  tremble and his breath choked. Only the picture, always horribly clear in his
  mind, of a gallows dark against a pale sky and the little fire beneath where
  the entrails of traitors were burned&mdash;a nightmare which had long ridden
  him&mdash;nerved him to the next step. "His life or mine," he told himself,
  as he groped his way into a lane as steep, dank, and black as the sides of a
  well.</p>

  <p>For some twenty yards he stumbled in an air thick with offal and garlic.
  He heard steps ahead, the boots of the doomed magistrate and the slipshod
  pattens <a href="#endnote42">[42]</a> of the woman. Then. they stopped; his
  quarry seemed to be ascending a stair on the right. It was a wretched
  tenement of wood, two hundred years old, once a garden house attached to the
  Savoy palace. Lovel scrambled up some rickety steps and found himself on the
  rotten planks of a long passage, which was lit by a small window giving to
  the west. He heard the sound of a man slipping at the other end, and
  something like an oath. Then a door slammed violently, and the place shook.
  After that it was quiet. Where was the bloody fight that Godfrey had been
  brought to settle?</p>

  <p>It was very dark there; the window in the passage was only a square of
  misty grey. Lovel felt eerie, a strange mood for an assassin. Magistrate and
  woman seemed to have been spirited away...  He plucked up courage and
  continued, one hand on the wall on his left. Then a sound broke the
  silence&mdash;a scuffle, and the long grate of something heavy dragged on a
  rough floor. Presently his fingers felt a door. The noise was inside that
  door. There were big cracks in the panelling through which an eye could look,
  but all was dark within. There were human beings moving there, and speaking
  softly. Very gingerly he tried the hasp, but it was fastened firm inside.</p>

  <p>Suddenly someone in the room struck a flint and lit a lantern. Lovel set
  his eyes to a crack and stood very still. The woman had gone, and the room
  held three men. One lay on the floor with a coarse kerchief, such as grooms
  wear, knotted round his throat. Over him bent a man in a long coat with a
  cape, a man in a dark peruke, whose face was clear in the lantern's light.
  Lovel knew him for one Bedloe, a led-captain and cardsharper, whom he had
  himself employed on occasion. The third man stood apart and appeared from his
  gesticulations to be speaking rapidly. He wore his own sandy hair, and every
  line of his mean freckled face told of excitement and fear. Him also Lovel
  recognised&mdash; Carstairs, a Scotch informer who had once made a handsome
  living through spying on conventicles, but had now fallen into poverty owing
  to conducting an affair of Buckingham's with a brutality which that
  fastidious nobleman had not bargained for...  Lovel rubbed his eyes and
  looked again. He knew likewise the man on the floor. It was Sir Edmund
  Godfrey, and Sir Edmund Godfrey was dead.</p>

  <p>The men were talking. "No blood-letting," said Bedloe "This must be a dry
  job. Though, by God, I wish I could stick my knife into him&mdash;once for
  Trelawney, once for Frewen, and a dozen times for myself. Through this swine
  I have festered a twelvemonth in Little Ease."</p>

  <p>Lovel's first thought, as he stared, was an immense relief. His business
  had been done for him, and he had escaped the guilt of it. His second, that
  here lay a chance of fair profit. Godfrey was a great man, and Bedloe and
  Carstairs were the seediest of rogues. He might make favour for himself with
  the Government if he had them caught red-handed. It would help his status in
  Aldersgate Street...  But he must act at once or the murderers would be gone.
  He tiptoed back along the passage, tumbled down the crazy steps, and ran up
  the steep entry to where he saw a glimmer of light from the Strand.</p>

  <p>At the gate he all but fell into the arms of a man&mdash;a powerful
  fellow, for it was like running against a brick wall. Two strong arms gripped
  Lovel by the shoulder, and a face looked into his. There was little light in
  the street, but the glow from the window of a Court perruquier was sufficient
  to reveal the features. Lovel saw a gigantic face, with a chin so long that
  the mouth seemed to be only half-way down it. Small eyes, red and fiery, were
  set deep under a beetling forehead. The skin was a dark purple, and the wig
  framing it was so white and fleecy that the man had the appearance of a
  malevolent black-faced sheep.</p>

  <p>Lovel gasped, as he recognised the celebrated Salamanca Doctor. He was the
  man above all others whom he most wished to see.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Oates!" he cried. "There's bloody work in the Savoy. I was passing
  through a minute agone and I saw that noble Justice, Sir Edmund Berry
  Godfrey, lie dead, and his murderers beside the body. Quick, let us get the
  watch and take them red-handed."</p>

  <p>The big paws, like a gorilla's, were withdrawn from his shoulders. The
  purple complexion seemed to go nearly black, and the wide mouth opened as if
  to bellow. But the sound which emerged was only a whisper.</p>

  <p>"By the maircy of Gaad we will have 'em!... </p>

  <p>A maist haarrid and unnaitural craime. I will take 'em with my own haands.
  Here is one who will help." And he turned to a man who had come up and who
  looked like a city tradesman. "Lead on, honest fellow, and we will see
  justice done. 'Tis pairt of the bloody plaat...  I foresaw it. I warned Sir
  Edmund, but he flouted me. Ah, poor soul, he has paid for his unbelief."</p>

  <p>Lovel, followed by Oates and the other whom he called Prance, dived again
  into the darkness. Now he had no fears. He saw himself acclaimed with the
  Doctor as the saviour of the nation, and the door of Aldersgate Street open
  at his knocking. The man Prance produced a lantern, and lighted them up the
  steps and into the tumbledown passage. Fired with a sudden valour, Lovel drew
  his sword and led the way to the sinister room. The door was open, and the
  place lay empty, save for the dead body.</p>

  <p>Oates stood beside it, looking, with his bandy legs great shoulders, and
  bull neck, like some forest baboon.</p>

  <p>"Oh, maist haunourable and noble victim!" he cried. "England will maarn
  you, and the spawn of Raam will maarn you, for by this deed they have rigged
  for thaimselves the gallows. Maark ye, Sir Edmund is the proto-martyr of this
  new fight for the Praatestant faith. He has died that the people may live,
  and by his death Gaad has given England the sign she required...  Ah, Prance,
  how little Tony Shaston will exult in our news! 'Twill be to him like a bone
  to a cur-dog to take his ainemies thus red-haanded."</p>

  <p>By your leave, sir," said Lovel, "those same enemies have escaped us. I
  saw them here five minutes since, but they have gone to earth. What say you
  to a hue-and-cry&mdash;though this Savoy is a snug warrin to hide
  vermin."</p>

  <p>Oates seemed to be in no hurry. He took the lantern from Prance and
  scrutinised Lovel's face with savage intensity.</p>

  <p>"Ye saw them, ye say...  I think, friend, I have seen ye before, and I
  doubt in no good quaarter. There's a Paapist air about you."</p>

  <p>"If you have seen me, 'twas in the house of my Lord Shaftesbury, whom I
  have the honour to serve," said Lovel stoutly.</p>

  <p>"Whoy, that is an haanest house enough. Whaat like were the villains,
  then? Jaisuits, I'll warrant? Foxes from St. Omer's airth?"</p>

  <p>"They were two common cutthroats whose names I know."</p>

  <p>"Tools, belike. Fingers of the Paape's hand...  Ye seem to have a good
  acquaintance among rogues, Mr. Whaat's-you-name."</p>

  <p>The man Prance had disappeared, and Lovel suddenly saw his prospects less
  bright. The murderers were being given a chance to escape, and to his
  surprise he found himself in a fret to get after them. Oates had clearly no
  desire for their capture, and the reason flashed on his mind. The murder had
  come most opportunely for him, and he sought to lay it at Jesuit doors. It
  would ill suit his plans if only two common rascals were to swing for it. Far
  better let it remain a mystery open to awful guesses. <i>Omne ignotum pro
  horrifico</i>...  Lovel's temper was getting the better of his prudence, and
  the sight of this monstrous baboon with his mincing speech stirred in him a
  strange abhorrence.</p>

  <p>"I can bear witness that the men who did the deed were no more Jesuits
  than you. One is just out of Newgate, and the other is a blackguard Scot late
  dismissed the Duke of Buckingham's service."</p>

  <p>"Ye lie," and Oates' rasping voice was close to his ear. "'Tis an
  incraidible tale. Will ye outface me, who alone discovered the plaat, and
  dispute with me on high poalicy?...  Now I come to look at it, ye have a true
  Jaisuit face. I maind of ye at St. Omer. I judge ye an accoamplice... "</p>

  <p>At that moment Prance returned and with him another, a man in a dark
  peruke, wearing a long coat with a cape. Lovel's breath went from him as he
  recognised Bedloe.</p>

  <p>"There is the murderer," he cried in a sudden fury "I saw him handle the
  body. I charge you to hold him.</p>

  <p>Bedloe halted and looked at Oates, who nodded. Then he strode up to Lovel
  and took him by the throat</p>

  <p>"Withdraw your words, you dog," he said, "or I will cut your throat. I
  have but this moment landed at the river stairs and heard of this horrid
  business. If you say you have ever seen me before you lie most foully. Quick,
  you ferret. Will Bedloe suffers no man to charge his honour."</p>

  <p>The strong hands on his neck, the fierce eyes of the bravo, brought back
  Lovel's fear and with it his prudence. He saw very plainly the game, and he
  realised that he must assent to it. His contrition was deep and voluble.</p>

  <p>"I withdraw," he stammered, "and humbly crave pardon. I have never seen
  this honest gentleman before."</p>

  <p>"But ye saw this foul murder, and though the laight was dim ye saw the
  murderers, and they had the Jaisuitical air?"</p>

  <p>Oates' menacing voice had more terror for Lovel than Bedloe's truculence.
  "Beyond doubt," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Whoy, that is so far good," and the Doctor laughed. "Ye will be helped
  later to remember the names for the benefit of his Maajesty's Court...  'Tis
  time we set to work. Is the place quiet?"</p>

  <p>"As the grave, doctor," said Prance.</p>

  <p>"Then I will unfold to you my pairpose. This noble magistrate is foully
  murdered by pairsons unknown as yet, but whom this haanest man will swear to
  have been disguised Jaisuits. Now in the sairvice of Goad and the King 'tis
  raight to pretermit no aiffort to bring the guilty to justice. The paiple of
  England are already roused to a holy fairvour, and this haarrid craime will
  be as the paistol flash to the powder caask. But that the craime may have its
  full effaict on the paapulace 'tis raight to take some trouble with the
  staging. 'Tis raight so to dispose of the boady that the complaicity of the
  Paapists will be clear to every doubting fool. I, Taitus Oates, take upon
  myself this responsibility, seeing that under Goad I am the chosen
  ainstrument for the paiple's salvation. To Soamersait Haase with it, say I,
  which is known for a haaunt of the paapistically-minded...  The postern ye
  know of is open, Mr. Prance?"</p>

  <p>"I have seen to it," said the man, who seemed to conduct himself in this
  wild business with the decorum of a merchant in his shop.</p>

  <p>"Up with him, then," said Oates.</p>

  <p>Prance and Bedloe swung the corpse on their shoulders and moved out, while
  the doctor, gripping Lovel's arm like a vice, followed at a little
  distance.</p>

  <p>The Savoy was very quiet that night, and very dark. The few loiterers who
  observed the procession must have shrugged their shoulders and turned aside,
  zealous only to keep out of trouble. Such sights were not uncommon in the
  Savoy. They entered a high ruinous house on the east side, and after
  threading various passages reached a door which opened on a flight of broken
  steps where it was hard for more than one to pass at a time. Lovel heard the
  carriers of the dead grunting as they squeezed up with their burden. At the
  top another door gave on an outhouse in the yard of Somerset House between
  the stables and the west water-gate...  Lovel, as he stumbled after them with
  Oates' bulk dragging at his arm, was in a confusion of mind such as his mean
  time-serving life had never known.</p>

  <p>He was in mortal fear, and yet his quaking heart would suddenly be braced
  by a gust of anger. He knew he was a rogue, but there were limits to roguery,
  and something in him&mdash; conscience, maybe, or forgotten
  gentility&mdash;sickened at this outrage. He had an impulse to defy them, to
  gain the street and give the alarm to honest men. These fellows were going to
  construct a crime in their own way which would bring death to the innocent
 ...  Mr. Lovel trembled at himself, and had to think hard on his family in the
  Billingsgate attic to get back to his common-sense. He would not be believed
  if he spoke out. Oates would only swear that he was the culprit, and Oates
  had the ear of the courts and the mob. Besides , he had too many dark patches
  in his past. It was not for such as he to be finicking.</p>

  <p>The body was pushed under an old truckle-bed which stood in the corner,
  and a mass of frails, such as gardeners use, flung over it for concealment.
  Oates rubbed his hands.</p>

  <p>"The good work goes merrily," he said. "Sir Edmund dead, and for a week
  the good fawk of London are a-fevered. Then the haarrid discovery, and such a
  Praatestant uprising as will shake the maightiest from his pairch. Wonderful
  are Goad's ways and surprising His jaidgements! Every step must be weighed,
  since it is the Laard's business. Five days we must give this city to grow
  uneasy, and then...  The boady will be safe here?"</p>

  <p>"I alone have the keys," said Prance.</p>

  <p>The doctor counted on his thick fingers. "Monday&mdash;
  Tuesday&mdash;Waidnesday&mdash;aye, Waidneday's the day. Captain Bedloe, ye
  have chairge of the removal. Before dawn by the water-gate, and then a chair
  and a trusty man to cairry it to the plaace of discovery. Ye have appainted
  the spoat?"</p>

  <p>"Any ditch in the Marylebone fields," said Bedloe.</p>

  <p>"And before ye remove it&mdash;on the Tuesday naight haply&mdash;ye will
  run the boady through with his swaard&mdash;Sir Edmund's swaard."</p>

  <p>"So you tell me," said Bedloe gruffly, "but I see no reason in it. The
  foolishest apothecary will be able tell how the man met his death."</p>

  <p>Oates grinned and laid his finger to his nose. "Ye laack subtelty,
  fraiend. The priests of Baal must be met with their own waipons. Look ye.
  This poor man is found with his swaard in his braist. He has killed himself,
  says the fool. Not so, say the apothecaries. Then why the swaard" asks the
  coroner. Because of the daivilish cunning of his murderers, says Doctor
  Taitus Oates. A clear proof that the Jaisuits are in it, says every honest
  Praatistant. D'ye take me?"</p>

  <p>Bedloe declared with oaths his admiration of the Doctor's wit, and good
  humour filled the hovel; All but Lovel, who once again was wrestling with
  something elemental in him that threatened to ruin every thing. He remembered
  the bowed stumbling figure that had gone before him in the Marylebone
  meadows. Then he had been its enemy; now by a queer contortion of the mind he
  thought of himself as the only protector of that cold clay under the
  bed&mdash;honoured in life, but in death a poor pawn in a rogue's cause. He
  stood a little apart from the others near the door, and his eyes sought it
  furtively. He was not in the plot, and yet the plotters did not trouble about
  him. They assumed his complaisance. Doubtless they knew his shabby past.</p>

  <p>He was roused by Oates' voice. The Doctor was arranging his plan of
  campaign with gusto. Bedloe was to disappear to the West Country till the
  time came for him to offer his evidence. Prance was to go about his peaceful
  trade till Bedloe gave him the cue. It was a masterly stratagem&mdash;Bedloe
  to start the ball, Prance to be accused as accomplice and then on his own
  account to give the other scoundrel corroboration.</p>

  <p>"Attend, you sir," the doctor shouted to Lovel. "Ye will be called to
  swear to the murderers whom this haanest man will name. If ye be a true
  Praatestant ye will repeat the laisson I taich you. If not, ye will be set
  down as one of the villains and the good fawk of this city will tear the
  limbs from ye at my nod. Be well advaised, my friend, for I hold ye in my
  haand." And Oates raised a great paw and opened and shut it.</p>

  <p>Lovel mumbled assent. Fear had again descended on him. He heard dimly the
  Doctor going over the names of those to be accused.</p>

  <p>"Ye must bring in one of the sairvants of this place," he said. "Some
  common paarter, who has no friends."</p>

  <p>"Trust me," said Prance. "I will find a likely fellow among the Queen's
  household. I have several in my mind for the honour."</p>

  <p>"Truly the plaace is a nest of Paapists," said Oates. "And not such as
  you, Mr. Prance, who putt England before the Paape. Ye are worth a score of
  Praatestants to the good caause, and it will be remaimbered. Be assured it
  will be remaimbered...  Ye are clear about the main villains? Walsh, you say,
  and Pritchard and the man called Le Fevre?"</p>

  <p>"The last most of all. But they are sharp-nosed as hounds, and unless we
  go wiarily they will give us the slip, and we must fall back on lesser
  game."</p>

  <p>"Le Fevre." Oates mouthed the name. "The Queen's confessor. I was spit
  upon by him at St. Omer, and would waipe out the affront. A dog of a Frainch
  priest! A man I have long abhaarred."</p>

  <p>"So also have I." Prance had venom in his level voice. "But he is no
  Frenchman. He is English as you&mdash;a Phayre out of Huntingdon."</p>

  <p>The name penetrated Lovel's dulled wits. Phayre! It was the one man who in
  his father's life had shown him unselfish kindness. Long ago in Paris this
  Phayre had been his teacher, had saved him from starvation, had treated him
  with a gentleman's courtesy. Even his crimes had not estranged this friend.
  Phayre had baptised his child, and tended his wife when he was in hiding. But
  a week ago he had spoken a kindly word in the Mall to one who had rarely a
  kind word from an honest man.</p>

  <p>That day had been to the spy a revelation of odd corners in his soul. He
  had mustered in the morning the resolution to kill one man. Now he discovered
  a scruple which bade him at all risks avert the killing of another. He
  perceived very clearly what the decision meant&mdash;desperate peril, perhaps
  ruin and death. He dare not delay, for in a little he would be too deep in
  the toils. He must escape and be first with the news of Godfrey's death in
  some potent quarter. Buckingham, who was a great prince. Or Danby. Or the
  King himself... </p>

  <p>The cunning of a lifetime failed him in that moment. He slipped through
  the door, but his coat caught in a splinter of wood, and the rending of it
  gave the alarm. As with quaking heart he ran up the silent stable-yard
  towards the Strand gate he felt close on him the wind of the pursuit. In the
  dark he slipped on a patch of horse-dung and was down. Something heavy fell
  atop of him, and the next second a gross agony tore the breath from
  him.</p><br>

  <p class="cp">* * * * *</p><br>

  <p>Five minutes later Bedloe was unknotting a coarse kerchief and stuffing it
  into his pocket. It was the same that had strangled Godfrey</p>

  <p>"A good riddance," said Oates. "The fool had seen too much and would have
  proved but a saarry witness. Now by the mairciful dispensation of Goad he has
  ceased to trouble us. Ye know him, Captain Bedloe?"</p>

  <p>A Papistical cur, and white-livered at that," the bravo answered.</p>

  <p>"And his boady? It must be praamptly disposed of."</p>

  <p>"An easy task. There is the Savoy water-gate and in an hour the tide will
  run. He has no friends to inquire after him."</p>

  <p>Oates rubbed his hands and cast his eyes upward. Great are the doings of
  the Laard," he said, "and wonderful in our saight!"</p><br>

  <h2>THE LIT CHAMBER</h2>

  <p>He was hoisted on his horse by an ostler and two local sots from the
  tap-room, his valise was strapped none too securely before him, and with a
  farewell, which was meant to be gracious but was only foolish, he tittuped
  into the rain. He was as drunk as an owl, though he did not know it. All
  afternoon he had been mixing strong Cumberland ale with the brandy he had got
  from the Solway free-traders, and by five o'clock had reached that state when
  he saw the world all gilt and rosy and himself as an applauded actor on a
  splendid stage. He had talked grandly to his fellow topers, and opened to
  their rustic wits a glimpse of the great world. They had bowed to a master,
  even those slow Cumbrians who admired little but fat cattle and blood horses.
  He had made a sensation, had seen wonder and respect in dull eyes, and tasted
  for a moment that esteem which he had singularly failed to find
  elsewhere.</p>

  <p>But he had been prudent. The Mr. Gilbert Craster who had been travelling
  on secret business in Nithsdale and the Ayrshire moorlands had not been
  revealed in the change-house of Newbigging. There he had passed by the name,
  long since disused, of Gabriel Lovel, which happened to be his true one. It
  was a needful ,precaution, for the times were crooked. Even in a Border
  hamlet the name of Craster might be known and since for the present it had a
  Whig complexion it was well to go warily in a place where feeling ran high
  and at an hour when the Jacobites were on the march. But that other name of
  Lovel was buried deep in the forgotten scandal of London by-streets.</p>

  <p>The gentleman late re-christened Lovel had for the moment no grudge
  against life. He was in the pay of a great man, no less than the lord Duke of
  Marlborough, and he considered that he was earning his wages. A soldier of
  fortune, he accepted the hire of the best paymaster; only he sold not a
  sword, but wits. A pedant might have called it honour, but Mr. Lovel was no
  pedant. He had served a dozen chiefs on different sides. For Blingbroke he
  had scoured France and twice imperilled his life in Highland bogs. For Somers
  he had travelled to Spain, and for Wharton had passed unquiet months on the
  Welsh marches. After his fashion he was an honest servant and reported the
  truth so far as his ingenuity could discern it. But, once quit of a great
  man's service, he sold his knowledge readily to an opponent, and had been
  like to be out of employment, since unless his masters gave him an engagement
  for life he was certain some day to carry the goods they had paid for to
  their rivals. But Marlborough had seen his uses, for the great Duke sat loose
  to parties and earnestly desired to know the facts. So for Marlborough he
  went into the conclaves of both Whig and Jacobite, making his complexion suit
  his company.</p>

  <p>He was new come from the Scottish south-west, for the Duke was eager to
  know if the malcontent moorland Whigs were about to fling their blue bonnets
  for King James. A mission of such discomfort Mr. Lovel had never known, not
  even when he was a go-between for Ormonde in the Irish bogs. He had posed as
  an emissary from the Dutch brethren, son of an exiled Brownist, and for the
  first time in his life had found his regicide great-grandfather useful. The
  jargon of the godly fell smoothly from his tongue, and with its aid and that
  of certain secret letters he had found his way to the heart of the sectaries.
  He had sat through weary sermons in Cameronian sheilings <a href=
  "#endnote43">[43]</a> , and been present at the childish parades of the
  Hebronite remnant. There was nothing to be feared in that quarter, for to
  them all in authority were idolaters and George no worse than James. In those
  moorland sojournings, too, he had got light on other matters, for he had the
  numbers of Kenmure's levies in his head, had visited my lord Stair at his
  grim Galloway castle, and had had a long midnight colloquy with Roxburghe on
  Tweedside. He had a pretty tale for his master, once he could get to him. But
  with Northumberland up and the Highlanders at Jedburgh and Kenmure coming
  from the west, it had been a ticklish business to cross the Border. Yet by
  cunning and a good horse it had been accomplished, and he found himself in
  Cumberland with the road open southward to the safe Lowther country.
  Wherefore Mr. Lovel had relaxed, and taken his ease in an inn.</p>

  <p>He would not have admitted that he was drunk, but he presently confessed
  that he was not clear about his road. He had meant to lie at Brampton, and
  had been advised at the tavern of a short cut, a moorland bridle-path. Who
  had told him of it? The landlord, he thought, or the merry fellow in brown
  who had stood brandy to the company? Anyhow, it was to save him five miles,
  and that was something in this accursed weather. The path was clear&mdash;he
  could see it squelching below him, pale in the last wet daylight&mdash;but
  where the devil did it lead? Into the heart of a moss, it seemed, and yet
  Brampton lay out of the moors in the tilled valley.</p>

  <p>At first the fumes in his head raised him above the uncertainty of his
  road and the eternal downpour. His mind was far away in a select world of his
  own imagining. He saw himself in a privy chamber, to which he had been
  conducted by reverent lackeys, the door closed, the lamp lit, and the Duke's
  masterful eyes bright with expectation. He saw the fine thin lips, like a
  woman's, primmed in satisfaction. He heard words of compliment&mdash;"none so
  swift and certain as you"&mdash;"in truth, a master-hand"&mdash;"I know not
  where to look for your like." Delicious speeches seemed to soothe his ear.
  And gold, too, bags of it, the tale of which would never appear in any
  accompt-book. Nay, his fancy soared higher. He saw himself presented to
  Ministers as one of the country's saviours, and kissing the hand of Majesty.
  What Majesty and what Ministers he knew not, and did not greatly
  care&mdash;that was not his business. The rotundity of the Hanoverian and the
  lean darkness of the Stuart were one to him. Both could reward an adroit
  servant...  His vanity, terribly starved and cribbed in his normal existence,
  now blossomed like a flower. His muddled head was fairly ravished with
  delectable pictures. He seemed to be set at a great height above mundane
  troubles, and to look down on men like a benignant God. His soul glowed with
  a happy warmth.</p>

  <p>But somewhere he was devilish cold. His wretched body was beginning to cry
  out with discomfort. A loop of his hat was broken and the loose flap was a
  conduit for the rain down his back. His old riding-coat was like a
  dish-clout, and he felt icy about the middle. Separate streams of water
  entered the tops of his riding-boots&mdash;they were a borrowed pair and too
  big for him&mdash;and his feet were in puddles. It was only by degrees that
  he realised this misery. Then in the boggy track his horse began to stumble.
  The fourth or fifth peck woke irritation, and he jerked savagely at the
  bridle, and struck the beast's dripping flanks with his whip. The result was
  a jib and a flounder, and the shock squeezed out the water from his garments
  as from a sponge. Mr. Lovel descended from the heights of fancy to prosaic
  fact, and cursed.</p>

  <p>The dregs of strong drink were still in him, and so soon as exhilaration
  ebbed they gave edge to his natural fears. He perceived that it had grown
  very dark and lonely. The rain, falling sheer, seemed to shut him into a
  queer wintry world. All around the land echoed with the steady drum of it,
  and the rumour of swollen runnels. A wild bird wailed out of the mist and
  startled Mr. Lovel like a ghost. He heard the sound of men talking and drew
  rein; it was only a larger burn foaming by the wayside. The sky was black
  above him, yet a faint grey light seemed to linger, for water glimmered and
  he passed what seemed to be the edge of a loch...  At another time the
  London-bred citizen would have been only peevish, for Heaven knew he had
  faced ill weather before in ill places. But the fiery stuff he had swallowed
  had woke a feverish fancy. Exaltation suddenly changed to foreboding.</p>

  <p>He halted and listened. Nothing but the noise of the weather, and the
  night dark around him like a shell. For a moment he fancied he caught the
  sound of horses, but it was not repeated. Where did this accursed track mean
  to lead him? Long ago he should have been in the valley and nearing Brampton.
  He was as wet as if he had wallowed in a pool, cold, and very weary. A sudden
  disgust at his condition drove away his fears and he swore lustily at
  fortune. He longed for the warmth and the smells of his favourite
  haunts&mdash;Gilpin's with oysters frizzling in a dozen pans, and noble
  odours stealing from the tap-room, the Green Man with its tripe-suppers,
  Wanless's Coffee House, noted for its cuts of beef and its white puddings. He
  would give much to be in a chair by one of those hearths and in the thick of
  that blowsy fragrance. Now his nostrils were filled with rain and bog water
  and a sodden world. It smelt sour, like stale beer in a mouldy cellar. And
  cold! He crushed down his hat on his head and precipitated a new deluge.</p>

  <p>A bird skirled again in his ear, and his fright returned. He felt small
  and alone in a vast inhospitable universe. And mingled with it all was
  self-pity, for drink had made him maudlin. He wanted so little&mdash;only a
  modest comfort, a little ease. He had forgotten that half an hour before he
  had been figuring in princes' cabinets. He would give up this business and be
  quit of danger and the high road. The Duke must give him a reasonable reward,
  and with it he and his child might dwell happily in some country place. He
  remembered a cottage at Guildford all hung with roses...  But the Duke was
  reputed a miserly patron, and at the thought Mr. Lovel's eyes overflowed.
  There was that damned bird again, wailing like a lost soul. The eeriness of
  it struck a chill to his heart, so that if he had been able to think of any
  refuge he would have set spurs to his horse and galloped for it in blind
  terror. He was in the mood in which men compose poetry, for he felt himself a
  midget in the grip of immensities. He knew no poetry, save a few tavern
  songs; but in his youth he had had the Scriptures drubbed into him. He
  remembered ill-omened texts&mdash;one especially about wandering through dry
  places seeking rest. Would to Heaven he were in a dry place now!... </p>

  <p>The horse sprang aside and nearly threw him. It had blundered against the
  stone pillar of a gateway. It was now clear even to Mr. Lovel's confused wits
  that he was lost. This might be the road to Tophet, but it was no road to
  Brampton. He felt with numbed hands the face of the gateposts. Here was an
  entrance to some dwelling, and it stood open. The path led through it, and if
  he left the path he would without doubt perish in a bog-hole. In his
  desolation he longed for a human face. He might find a good fellow who would
  house him; at the worst he would get direction about the road. So he passed
  the gateway and entered an avenue.</p>

  <p>It ran between trees which took the force of the downpour, so that it
  seemed a very sanctuary after the open moor. His spirits lightened. The
  infernal birds had stopped crying, but again he heard the thud of hooves.
  That was right, and proved the place was tenanted. Presently he turned a
  corner and faced a light which shone through the wet, rayed like a heraldic
  star.</p>

  <p>The sight gave him confidence, for it brought him back to a familiar
  world. He rode straight to it, crossing a patch of rough turf, where a fallen
  log all but brought him down. As he neared it the light grew till he saw its
  cause. He stood before the main door of a house and it was wide open. A great
  lantern, hung from a beam just inside, showed a doorway of some size and
  magnificence. And below it stood a servant, an old man, who at the sight of
  the stranger advanced to hold his stirrup.</p>

  <p>"Welcome, my lord," said the man. "All is ready for you."</p>

  <p>The last hour had partially sobered the traveller, but, having now come
  safe to port, his drunkenness revived. He saw nothing odd in the open door or
  the servant's greeting. As he scrambled to the ground he was back in his
  first exhilaration. "My lord!" Well, why not? This was an honest man who knew
  quality when he met it.</p>

  <p>Humming a tune and making a chain of little pools on the stone flags of
  the hall, Mr. Lovel followed his guide, who bore his shabby valise, another
  servant having led away the horse. The hall was dim with flickering shadows
  cast by the lamp in the doorway, and smelt raw and cold as if the house had
  been little dwelt in. Beyond it was a stone passage where a second lamp
  burned and lit up a forest of monstrous deer horns on the wall. The butler
  flung open a door.</p>

  <p>"I trust your lordship will approve the preparations," he said. "Supper
  awaits you, and when you have done I will show you your chamber. There are
  dry shoes by the hearth." He took from the traveller his sopping overcoat and
  drew from his legs the pulpy riding-boots. With a bow which might have graced
  a court he closed the door, leaving Mr. Lovel alone to his entertainment.</p>

  <p>It was a small square room panelled to the ceiling in dark oak, and lit by
  a curious magnificence of candles. They burned in sconces on the walls and in
  tall candlesticks on the table, while a log fire on the great stone hearth so
  added to the glow that the place was as bright as day. The windows were
  heavily shuttered and curtained, and in the far corner was a second door. On
  the polished table food had been laid&mdash;a noble ham, two virgin pies, a
  dish of fruits, and a group of shining decanters. To one coming out of the
  wild night it was a transformation like a dream, but Mr. Lovel, half drunk,
  accepted it as no more than his due. His feather brain had been fired by the
  butler's "my lord," and he did not puzzle his head with questions. From a
  slim bottle he filled himself a glass of brandy, but on second thoughts set
  it down untasted. He would sample the wine first and top off with the spirit.
  Meantime he would get warm.</p>

  <p>He stripped off his coat, which was dampish, and revealed a dirty shirt
  and the dilapidated tops of his small clothes. His stockings were torn and
  soaking, so he took them off, and stuck his naked feet into the furred
  slippers which stood waiting by the hearth. Then he sat himself in a great
  brocaded arm-chair and luxuriously stretched his legs to the blaze.</p>

  <p>But his head was too much afire to sit still. The comfort soaked into his
  being through every nerve and excited rather than soothed him. He did not
  want to sleep now, though little before he had been crushed by weariness...
  There was a mirror beside the fireplace, the glass painted at the edge with
  slender flowers and cupids in the Caroline fashion. He saw his reflection and
  it pleased him. The long face with the pointed chin, the deep-set dark eyes,
  the skin brown with weather&mdash;he seemed to detect a resemblance to
  Wharton. Or was it Beaufort? Anyhow, now that the shabby coat was off, he
  might well be a great man in undress. "My lord!" Why not? His father had
  always told him he came of an old high family. Kings, he had said&mdash;of
  France, or somewhere...  A gold ring he wore on his left hand slipped from
  his finger and jingled on the hearthstone. It was too big for him, and when
  his fingers grew small with cold or wet it was apt to fall off. He picked it
  up and laid it beside the decanters on the table. That had been his father's
  ring, and he congratulated himself that in all his necessities he had never
  parted from it. It was said to have come down from ancient kings.</p>

  <p>He turned to the table and cut himself a slice of ham. But he found he had
  no appetite. He filled himself a bumper of claret. It was a ripe velvety
  liquor and cooled his hot mouth. That was the drink for gentlemen. Brandy in
  good time, but for the present this soft wine which was in keeping with the
  warmth and light and sheen of silver...  His excitement was dying now into
  complacence. He felt himself in the environment for which Providence had
  fitted him. His whole being expanded in the glow of it. He understood how
  able he was, how truly virtuous&mdash; a master of intrigue, but one whose
  eye was always fixed on the star of honour. And then his thoughts wandered to
  his son in the mean London lodgings. The boy should have his chance and walk
  some day in silks and laces. Curse his aliases! He should be Lovel, and carry
  his head as high as any Villiers or Talbot.</p>

  <p>The reflection sent his hand to an inner pocket of the coat now drying by
  the hearth. He took from it a thin packet of papers wrapped in oil-cloth.
  These were the fruits of his journey, together with certain news too secret
  to commit to writing which he carried in his head. He ran his eye over them,
  approved them, and laid them before him on the table. They started a train of
  thought which brought him to the question of his present quarters...  A
  shadow of doubt flickered over his mind. Whose house was this and why this
  entertainment? He had been expected, or someone like him. An old campaigner
  took what gifts the gods sent, but there might be questions to follow. There
  was a coat of arms on the plate, but so dim that he could not read it. The
  one picture in the room showed an old man in a conventional suit of armour.
  He did not recognise the face or remember any like it...  He filled himself
  another bumper of claret, and followed it with a little brandy. This latter
  was noble stuff, by which he would abide. His sense of ease and security
  returned. He pushed the papers farther over, sweeping the ring with them, and
  set his elbows on the table, a gentleman warm, dry, and content, but much
  befogged in the brain.</p>

  <p>He raised his eyes to see the far door open and three men enter. The sight
  brought him to his feet with a start, and his chair clattered on the oak
  boards. He made an attempt at a bow, backing steadily towards the fireplace
  and his old coat.</p>

  <p>The faces of the new-comers exhibited the most lively surprise. All three
  were young, and bore marks of travel, for though they had doffed their riding
  coats, they were splashed to the knees with mud and their unpowdered hair lay
  damp on their shoulders. One was a very dark man who might have been a
  Spaniard but for his blue eyes. The second was a mere boy with a ruddy face
  and eyes full of dancing merriment. The third was tall and red-haired, tanned
  of countenance and lean as a greyhound. He wore trews of a tartan which Mr.
  Lovel, trained in such matters, recognised as that of the house of
  Atholl.</p>

  <p>Of the three he only recognised the leader, and the recognition sobered
  him. This was that Talbot, commonly known from his swarthiness as the Crow,
  who was Ormonde's most trusted lieutenant. He had once worked with him; he
  knew his fierce temper, his intractable honesty. His bemused wits turned
  desperately to concocting a conciliatory tale.</p>

  <p>But he seemed to be unrecognised. The three stared at him in wild-eyed
  amazement.</p>

  <p>Who the devil are you, sir?" the Highlander stammered.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lovel this time brought off his bow. "A stormstayed traveller," he
  said, his eyes fawning, "who has stumbled on this princely hospitality. My
  name at your honour's service is Gabriel Lovel."</p>

  <p>There was a second of dead silence and then the boy laughed. It was merry
  laughter and broke in strangely on the tense air of the room.</p>

  <p>"Lovel," he cried, and there was an Irish burr in his speech. "Lovel! And
  that fool Jobson mistook it for Lovat! I mistrusted the tale, for Simon is
  too discreet even in his cups to confess his name in a changehouse. It seems
  we have been stalking the cailzie-cock and found a common thrush."</p>

  <p>The dark man Talbot did not smile. "We had good reason to look for Lovat.
  Widrington had word from London that he was on his way to the north by the
  west marches. Had we found him we had found a prize, for he will play hell
  with Mar if he crosses the Highland line. What say you, Lord Charles?"</p>

  <p>The Highlander nodded. "I would give my sporran filled ten times with gold
  to have my hand on Simon. What devil's luck to be marching south with that
  old fox in our rear!"</p>

  <p>The boy pulled up a chair to the table. "Since we have missed the big
  game, let us follow the less. I'm for supper, if this gentleman will permit
  us to share a feast destined for another. Sit down, sir, and fill your glass.
  You are not to be blamed for not being a certain Scots lord. Lovel, I dare
  say, is an honester name than Lovat!"</p>

  <p>But Talbot was regarding the traveller with hard eyes. "You called him a
  thrush, Nick, but I have a notion he is more of a knavish jackdaw. I have
  seen this gentleman before. You were with Ormonde?"</p>

  <p>"I had once the honour to serve his Grace," said Lovel, still feverishly
  trying to devise a watertight tail. "Ah, I remember now. You thought his star
  descending and carried your wares to the other side. And who is your new
  employer, Mr. Lovel? His present Majesty?"</p>

  <p>His glance caught the papers on the table and he swept them towards
  him.</p>

  <p>"What have we here?" and his quick eye scanned the too legible
  handwriting. Much was in cipher and contractions, but some names stood out
  damningly. In that month of October in that year 1715 "Ke" could only stand
  for "Kenmure" and "Ni" for "Nithsdale."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lovel made an attempt at dignity.</p>

  <p>"These are my papers, sir," he blustered. "I know not by what authority
  you examine them." But his protest failed because of the instability of his
  legs, on which his potations early and recent had suddenly a fatal effect. He
  was compelled to collapse heavily in the arm-chair by the hearth.</p>

  <p>"I observe that the gentleman has lately been powdering his hair," said
  the boy whom they called Nick.</p>

  <p>Mr. Lovel was wroth. He started upon the usual drunkard's protestations,
  but was harshly cut short by Talbot.</p>

  <p>"You ask me my warrant 'Tis the commission of his Majesty King James in
  whose army I have the honour to hold a command."</p>

  <p>He read on, nodding now and then, pursing his mouth at a word, once
  copying something on to his own tablets. Suddenly he raised his head.</p>

  <p>"When did his Grace dismiss you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Now Ormonde had been the Duke last spoken of, but Mr. Lovel's precarious
  wits fell into the trap. He denied indignantly that he had fallen from his
  master's favour.</p>

  <p>A grim smile played round Talbot's mouth.</p>

  <p>You have confessed," he said. Then to the others: This fellow is one of
  Malbrouck's pack. He has been nosing in the Scotch westlands. Here are the
  numbers of Kenmure and Nithsdale to enable the great Duke to make up his
  halting mind. See, he has been with Roxburghe too...  We have a spy before
  us, gentlemen, delivered to our hands by a happy incident. Whig among the
  sectaries and with Stair and Roxburghe, and Jacobite among our poor honest
  folk, and wheedling the secrets out of both sides to sell to one who disposes
  of them at a profit in higher quarters. Faug! I know the vermin. An honest
  Whig like John Argyll I can respect and fight, but for such rats as
  this&mdash;What shall we do with it now that we have trapped it?"</p>

  <p>"Let it go," said the boy, Nick Wogan. "The land crawls with them and we
  cannot go rat-hunting when we are aiming at a throne." He picked up Lovel's
  ring and spun it on a finger tip. "The gentleman has found more than news in
  the north. He has acquired a solid lump of gold."</p>

  <p>The implication roused Mr. Lovel out of his embarrassment. "I wear the
  ring by right. I had it from my father. His voice was tearful with offended
  pride</p>

  <p>The creature claims gentility," said Talbot, as he examined the trinket.
  "Lovel you call yourself. But Lovel bears barry <a href="#endnote44">[44]</a>
  nebuly <a href="#endnote45">[45]</a> or chevronels <a href=
  "#endnote46">[46]</a>. This coat has three plain charges. Can you read them,
  Nick, for my eyes are weak! I am curious to know from whom he stole it.</p>

  <p>The boy scanned it closely. "Three of something I think they are
  fleur-de-lys, which would spell Montgomery. Or lions' heads, maybe, for
  Buchan?"</p>

  <p>He passed it to Lord Charles, who held it to a candle's light. "Nay, I
  think they are Cummin garbs <a href="#endnote46">[47]</a>. Some poor fellow
  dirked and spoiled."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lovel was outraged and forgot his fears. He forgot, indeed, most
  things which he should have remembered. He longed only to establish his
  gentility in the eyes of those three proud gentlemen. The liquor was ebbing
  in him and with it had flown all his complacence. He felt small and mean and
  despised, and the talents he had been pluming himself on an hour before had
  now shrunk to windlestraws <a href="#endnote46">[48]</a>.</p>

  <p>"I do assure you, sirs," he faltered, "the ring is mine own. I had it from
  my father, who had it from his. I am of an ancient house, though somewhat
  decayed."</p>

  <p>His eyes sought those of his inquisitors with the pathos of a dog. But he
  saw only hostile faces&mdash;Talbot's grave and grim, Lord Charles'
  contemptuous, the boy's smiling ironically.</p>

  <p>"Decayed, indeed," said the dark man, "pitifully decayed. If you be gentle
  the more shame on you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lovel was almost whining. "I swear I am honest. I do my master's
  commissions and report what I learn."</p>

  <p>"Aye, sir, but how do you learn it? By playing the imposter and winning
  your way into an unsuspecting confidence. To you friendship is a tool and
  honour a convenience. You cheat in every breath you draw. And what a man
  gives you in his innocence may bring him to the gallows. By God! I'd rather
  slit throats on a highway for a purse or two than cozen men to their death by
  such arts as yours."</p>

  <p>In other circumstances Mr. Lovel might have put up a brazen defence, but
  now he seemed to have lost assurance. "I do no ill," was all he could
  stammer, "for I have no bias. I am for no side in politics."</p>

  <p>"So much the worse. A man who spies for a cause in which he believes may
  redeem by that faith a dirty trade. But in cold blood you practise
  infamy."</p>

  <p>The night was growing wilder, and even in that sheltered room its echoes
  were felt. Wind shook the curtains and blew gusts of ashes from the fire. The
  place had become bleak and tragic and Mr. Lovel felt the forlornness in his
  bones. Something had woke in him which shivered the fabric of a lifetime. The
  three faces, worn, anxious, yet of a noble hardihood, stirred in him a
  strange emotion. Hopes and dreams, long forgotten, flitted like spectres
  across his memory. He had something to say, something which demanded
  utterance, and his voice grew bold.</p>

  <p>"What do you know of my straits?" he cried. "Men of fortune like you! My
  race is old, but I never had the benefit of it. I was bred in a garret and
  have all my days been on nodding terms with starvation...  What should I know
  about your parties? What should I care for Whig and Tory or what king has his
  hinder-end on the throne? Tell me in God's name how should such as I learn
  loyalty except to the man who gives me gold to buy food and shelter? Heaven
  knows I have never betrayed a master while I served him."</p>

  <p>The shabby man with the lean face had secured an advantage. For a moment
  the passion in his voice dominated the room.</p>

  <p>"Cursed if this does not sound like truth," said the boy, and his eyes
  were almost friendly.</p>

  <p>But Talbot did not relax.</p>

  <p>"By your own confession you are outside the pale of gentility. I do not
  trouble to blame you, but I take leave to despise you. By your grace, sir, we
  will dispense with your company."</p>

  <p>The ice of his scorn did not chill the strange emotion which seemed to
  have entered the air. The scarecrow by the fire had won a kind of
  dignity.</p>

  <p>"I am going," he said. "Will you have the goodness to send for my horse?
 ...  If you care to know, gentleman, you have cut short a promising career...
  To much of what you say I submit. You have spoken truth&mdash;not all the
  truth, but sufficient to unman me. I am a rogue by your reckoning, for I
  think only of my wages. Pray tell me what moves you to ride out on what at
  the best is a desperate venture?"</p>

  <p>There was nothing but sincerity in the voice, and Talbot answered.</p>

  <p>"I fight for the King ordained by God and for a land which cannot flourish
  under the usurper. My loyalty to throne, Church, and fatherland constrains
  me."</p>

  <p>Lovel's eye passed to Lord Charles. The Highlander whistled very softly a
  bar or two of a wild melody with longing and a poignant sorrow in it.</p>

  <p>"That," he said. "I fight for the old ways and the old days that are
  passing."</p>

  <p>Nick Wogan smiled. "And I for neither&mdash;wholly. I have a little of
  Talbot in me and more of Charles. But I strike my blow for romance&mdash;the
  little against the big, the noble few against the base many. I am for youth
  against all dull huckstering things."</p>

  <p>Mr. Lovel bowed. I am answered. I congratulate you, gentlemen, on your
  good fortune. It is my grief that I do not share it. I have not Mr. Talbot's
  politics, nor am I a great Scotch lord, nor have I the felicity to be young
 ...  I would beg you not to judge me harshly."</p>

  <p>By this time he had struggled into his coat and boots He stepped to the
  table and picked up the papers.</p>

  <p>"By your leave," he said, and flung them into the fire.</p>

  <p>You were welcome to them," said Talbot. "Long ere they got to Marlborough
  they would be useless."</p>

  <p>"That is scarcely the point," said Lovel "I am somewhat dissatisfied with
  my calling and contemplate a change."</p>

  <p>"You may sleep here if you wish," said Lord Charles.</p>

  <p>"I thank you, but I am no fit company for you. I am better on the
  road."</p>

  <p>Talbot took a guinea from his purse "Here's to help your journey," he was
  saying, when Nick Wogan flushing darkly, intervened. "Damn you, James don't
  be a boor," he said.</p>

  <p>The boy picked up the ring and offered it to Mr. Lovel as he passed
  through the door. He also gave him his hand.</p><br>

  <p>The traveller spurred his horse into the driving rain, but he was
  oblivious of the weather. When he came to Brampton he discovered to his
  surprise that he had been sobbing. Except in liquor, he had not wept since he
  was a child.</p><br>

  <h2>IN THE DARK LAND</h2>

  <p>The fire was so cunningly laid that only on one side did it cast a glow,
  and there the light was absorbed by a dark thicket of laurels. It was built
  under an overhang of limestone so that the smoke in the moonlight would be
  lost against the grey face of the rock. But, though the moon was only two
  days past the full, there was no sign of it, for the rain had come and the
  world was muffled in it. That morning the Kentucky vales, as seen from the
  ridge where the camp lay, had been like a furnace with the gold and scarlet
  of autumn, and the air had been heavy with sweet October smells. Then the
  wind had suddenly shifted, the sky had grown leaden, and in a queer dank
  chill the advance-guard of winter had appeared&mdash;that winter which to men
  with hundreds of pathless miles between them and their homes was like a
  venture into an uncharted continent,</p>

  <p>One of the three hunters slipped from his buffalo robe and dived into the
  laurel thicket to replenish the fire from the stock of dry fuel. His figure
  revealed itself fitfully in the firelight, a tall slim man with a curious
  lightness of movement like a cat's. When he had done his work he snuggled
  down in his skins in the glow, and his two companions shifted their positions
  to be near him. The fire-tender was the leader of the little party The light
  showed a face very dark with weather. He had the appearance of wearing an
  untidy peruke, which was a tight-fitting skin-cap with the pelt hanging
  behind. Below its fringe straggled a selvage of coarse black hair. But his
  eyes were blue and very bright, and his eyebrows and lashes were flaxen, and
  the contrast of light and dark had the effect of something peculiarly bold
  and masterful. Of the others one was clearly his brother, heavier in build,
  but with the same eyes and the same hard pointed chin and lean jaws. The
  third man was shorter and broader, and wore a newer hunting shirt than his
  fellows and a broad belt of wool and leather.</p>

  <p>This last stretched his moccasins to the blaze and sent thin rings of
  smoke from his lips into the steam made by the falling rain.</p>

  <p>He bitterly and compendiously cursed the weather. The little party had
  some reason for ill-temper. There had been an accident in the creek with the
  powder supply, and for the moment there were only two charges left in the
  whole outfit. Hitherto they had been living on ample supplies of meat, though
  they were on short rations of journey-cake, for their stock of meal was low.
  But that night they had supped poorly, for one of them had gone out to perch
  a turkey, since powder could not be wasted, and had not come back.</p>

  <p>"I reckon we're the first as ever concluded to winter in Kaintuckee," he
  said between his puffs. "Howard and Salling went in in June, I've heerd. And
  Finley? What about Finley, Dan'l?"</p>

  <p>He never stopped beyond the fall, though he was once near gripped by the
  snow. But there ain't no reason why winter should be worse on the O-hio than
  on the Yadkin. It's a good hunting time, and snow'll keep the redskins quiet.
  What's bad for us is wuss for them, says I...  I won't worry about winter nor
  redskins, if old Jim Lovelle 'ud fetch up. It beats me whar the man has got
  to."</p>

  <p>"Wandered, maybe?" suggested the first speaker, whose name was Neely.</p>

  <p>"I reckon not. Ye'd as soon wander a painter. There ain't no sech hunter
  as Jim ever came out of Virginny, no, nor out of Caroliny, neither. It was
  him that fust telled me of Kaintuck'. 'The dark and bloody land, the Shawnees
  calls it,' he says, speakin' in his eddicated way, and dark and bloody it is,
  but that's man's doing and not the Almighty's. The land flows with milk and
  honey, he says, clear water and miles of clover and sweet grass, enough to
  feed all the herds of Basham, and mighty forests with trees that thick ye
  could cut a hole in their trunks and drive a wagon through, and sugar-maples
  and plums and cherries like you won't see in no set orchard, and black soil
  fair crying for crops. And the game, Jim says, wasn't to be told about
  without ye wanted to be called a liar&mdash;big black-nosed buffaloes that
  packed together so the whole placed seemed moving, and elk and deer and bar
  past counting...  Wal, neighbours, ye've seen it with your own eyes and can
  jedge if Jim was a true prophet. I'm Moses, he used to say, chosen to lead
  the Children of Israel into a promised land, but I reckon I'll leave my old
  bones on some Pisgah-top on the borders. He was a sad man, Jim, and didn't
  look for much comfort this side Jordan...  I wish I know'd whar he'd gotten
  to."</p>

  <p>Squire Boone, the speaker's brother, sniffed the air dolefully. "It's
  weather that 'ud wander a good hunter."</p>

  <p>"I tell ye, ye couldn't wander Jim," said his brother fiercely. "He come
  into Kaintuckee alone in '52, and that was two years before Finley. He was on
  the Ewslip all the winter of '58. He was allus springing out of a bush when
  ye didn't expect him. When we was fighting the Cherokees with Montgomery in
  '61 he turned up as guide to the Scotsmen, and I reckon if they'd attended to
  him there'ud be more of them alive this day. He was like a lone wolf, old
  Jim, and preferred to hunt by hisself, but you never knowed that he wouldn't
  come walking in and say 'Howdy' while you was reckoning you was the fust
  white man to make that trace. Wander Jim? Ye might as well speak of wandering
  a hawk."</p>

  <p>"Maybe the Indians have got his sculp," said Neely.</p>

  <p>"I reckon not," said Boone. "Leastways if they have, he must ha' struck a
  new breed of redskin. Jim was better nor any redskin in Kaintuck', and they
  knowed it. I told ye, neighbours, of our doings before you come west through
  the Gap. The Shawnees cotched me and Jim in a cane-brake, and hit our trace
  back to camp, so that they cotched Finley too, and his three Yadkiners with
  him. Likewise they took our hosses, and guns and traps and the furs we had
  gotten from three months' hunting. Their chief made a speech saying we had no
  right in Kaintuckee and if they cotched us again our lives 'ud pay for it.
  They'd ha' sculped us if it hadn't been for Jim, but you could see they knew
  him, and was feared of him. Wal, Finley reckoned the game was up, and started
  back with the Yadkiners. Cooley and Joe Holden and Mooneyiye mind them,
  Squire! But I was feeling kinder cross and wanted my property back, and old
  Jim&mdash;why, he wasn't going to be worsted by no redskins. So we trailed
  the Shawnees, us two, and come up with them one night encamped beside a
  salt-lick. Jim got into their camp while I was lying shivering in the cane,
  and blessed if he didn't snake back four of our hosses and our three best
  Deckards <a href="#endnote49">[49]</a>. Tha's craft for ye. By sunrise we was
  riding south on the Warriors' Path but the hosses was plumb tired, and afore
  midday them pizonous Shawnees had cotched up with us. I can tell ye,
  neighbours, the hair riz on my head, for I expected nothing better than a
  bloody sculp and six feet of earth...  But them redskins didn't hurt us. And
  why, says ye? 'Cos they was scared of Jim. It seemed they had a name for him
  in Shawnee which meant the 'old wolf that hunts by night. They started out to
  take us way north of the Ohio to their Scioto villages, whar they said we
  would be punished. Jim telled me to keep up my heart, for he reckoned we
  wasn't going north of no river. Then he started to make friends with them
  redskins, and in two days he was the most popular fellow in that company. He
  was a quiet man and for general melancholious, but I guess he could be
  amusing when he wanted to. You know the way an Indian laughs grunts in his
  stomach and looks at the ground. Wal, Jim had them grunting all day, and,
  seeing he could speak all their tongues, he would talk serious too. Ye could
  see them savages listening, like he was their own sachem."</p>

  <p>Boone reached for another faggot and tossed it on the fire. The downpour
  was slacking, but the wind had risen high and was wailing in the
  sycamores.</p>

  <p>"Consekince was," he went on, "for prisoners we wasn't proper guarded. By
  the fourth day we was sleeping round the fire among the Shawnees and marching
  with them as we pleased, though we wasn't allowed to go near the hosses. On
  the seventh night we saw the Ohio rolling in the hollow, and Jim says to me
  it was about time to get quit of the redskins. It was a wet night with a
  wind, which suited his plan, and about one in the morning, when Indians sleep
  soundest, I was woke by Jim's hand pressing my wrist. Wal, I've trailed a bit
  in my day, but I never did such mighty careful hunting as that night. An inch
  at a time we crawled out of the circle&mdash;we was lying well back on
  purpose&mdash;and got into the canes. I lay there while Jim went back and
  fetched guns and powder. The Lord knows how he done it without startling the
  hosses. Then we quit like ghosts, and legged it for the hills. We was aiming
  for the Gap, but it took us thirteen days to make it, travelling mostly by
  night, and living on berries, for we durstn't risk a shot. Then we made up
  with you. I reckon we didn't look too pretty when ye see'd us first."</p>

  <p>"Ye looked," said his brother soberly, "Like two scare-crows that had took
  to walkin'. There was more naked skin than shirt about you Dan'l. But Lovelle
  wasn't complaining, except about his empty belly."</p>

  <p>"He was harder nor me, though twenty years older. He did the leading, too,
  for he had forgotten more about woodcraft than I ever know'd... "</p>

  <p>The man Neely, who was from Virginia, consumed tobacco as steadily as a
  dry soil takes in water.</p>

  <p>"I've heerd of this Lovelle," he said. "I've seed him too, I guess. A long
  man with black eyebrows and hollow eyes like as he was hungry. He used ter
  live near my folks in Palmer Country. What was he looking for in those
  travels of his?"</p>

  <p>"Hunting maybe," said Boone. "He was the skilfullest hunter, I reckon,
  between the Potomac and the Cherokee. He brought in mighty fine pelts, but he
  didn't seem to want money. Just so much as would buy him powder and shot and
  food for the next venture, ye understand...  He wasn't looking for land to
  settle on, neighber, for one time he telled me he had had all the settling he
  wanted in this world...  But he was looking for something else. He never
  talked about it, but he'd sit often with his knees hunched up and his eyes
  staring out at nothing like a bird's. I never know'd who he was or whar he
  come from. You say it was Virginny?"</p>

  <p>"Aye, Palmer County. I mind his old dad, who farmed a bit of land by
  Nelson's Cross Roads, when he wasn't drunk in Nelson's tavern. The boys used
  to follow him to laugh at his queer clothes, and hear his fine London speech
  when he cursed us. By thunder, he was the one to swear. Jim Lovelle used to
  clear us off with a whip, and give the old man his arm into the shack. Jim
  too was a queer one, but it didn't do to make free with him, unless ye was
  lookin' for a broken head. They was come of high family, I've heerd."</p>

  <p>"Aye, Jim was a gentleman and no mistake, said Boone. "The way he held his
  head and looked straight through the man that angered him. I reckon it was
  that air of his and them glowering eyes that made him powerful with the
  redskins. But he was mighty quiet always. I've seen Cap'n Evan Shelby roaring
  at him like a bull and Jim just staring back at him, as gentle as a girl,
  till the Cap'n began to stutter and dried up. But, Lordy, he had a pluck in a
  fight, for I've seen him with Montgomery...  He was eddicated too, and could
  tell you things out of books. I've knowed him sit up all night talking law
  with Mr. Robertson...  He was always thinking. Queer thoughts they was
  sometimes."</p>

  <p>"Whatten kind of thoughts, Dan'l?" his brother asked.</p>

  <p>Boone rubbed his chin as if he found it hard to explain. "About this
  country of Ameriky," he replied. "He reckoned it would soon have to cut loose
  from England, and him knowing so much about England I used ter believe him.
  He allowed there 'ud be bloody battles before it happened, but he held that
  the country had grown up and couldn't be kept much longer in short clothes.
  He had a power of larning about things that happened to folks long ago called
  Creeks and Rewmans that pinted that way, he said. But he held that when we
  had fought our way quit of England, we was in for a bigger and bloodier fight
  among ourselves. I mind his very words. 'Dan'l,' he says, 'this is the
  biggest and best slice of the world which we Americans has struck, and for
  fifty years or more, maybe, we'll be that busy finding out what we've got
  that we'll have no time to quarrel. But there's going to come a day, if
  Ameriky's to be a great nation, when she'll have to sit down and think and
  make up her mind about one or two things. It won't be easy, for she won't
  have the eddication or patience to think deep, and there'll be plenty selfish
  and short-sighted folk that won't think at all. I reckon she'll have to set
  her house in order with a hickory stick. But if she wins through that all
  right, she'll be a country for our children to be proud of and happy
  in.'"</p>

  <p>"Children? Has he any belongings?" Squire Boone</p>

  <p>Daniel looked puzzled. "I've heerd it said he had a wife, though he never
  telled nie of her."</p>

  <p>"I've seed her," Neely put in. "She was one of Jake Early's daughters up
  to Walsing Springs. She didn't live no more than a couple of years after they
  was wed. She left a gal behind her, a mighty fine-looking gal. They tell me
  she's married on young Abe Hanks, I did hear that Abe was thinking of coming
  west, but them as told me allowed that Abe hadn't got the right kinder wife
  for the Border. Polly Hanker they called her, along of her being Polly Hanks,
  and likewise wantin' more than other folks had to get along with. See?"</p>

  <p>This piece of news woke Daniel Boone to attention. "Tell me about Jim's
  gal," he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Pretty as a peach," said Neely "Small, not higher nor Abe's shoulder, and
  as light on her feet as a deer. She had a softish laughing look in her eyes
  that made the lads wild for her. But she wasn't for them and I reckon she
  wasn't for Abe neither. She was nicely eddicated, though she had jest had
  field-schooling like the rest, for her dad used to read books and tell her
  about 'em. One time he took her to Richmond for the better part of a winter,
  where she larned dancing and music. The neighbours allowed that turned her
  head. Ye couldn't please her with clothes, for she wouldn't look at the
  sun-bonnets and nettle-linen that other gals wore. She must have a neat
  little bonnet and send to town for pretty dresses...  The women couldn't
  abide her, for she had a high way of looking at 'em and talking at 'em as if
  they was jest black trash. But the men 'ud walk miles to see her on a Sunday
 ...  I never could jest understand why she took Abe Hanks. 'Twasn't for lack
  of better offers."</p>

  <p>"I reckon that's women's ways," said Boone meditatively. "She must ha'
  favoured Jim, though he wasn't partickler about his clothes. Discontented, ye
  say she was?"</p>

  <p>"Aye. Discontented. She was meant for a fine lady, I reckon. I dunno what
  she wanted, but anyhow it was something that Abe Hanks ain't likely to give
  her. I can't jest picture her in Kaintuck'!"</p>

  <p>Squire Boone was asleep, and Daniel drew the flap of his buffalo robe over
  his head and prepared to follow suit. His last act was to sniff the air.
  "Please God the weather mends," he muttered. "I've got to find old Jim."</p>

  <p>Very early next morning there was a consultation. Lovelle had not appeared
  and hunting was impossible on two shoots of powder. It was arranged that two
  of them should keep camp that day by the limestone cliff while Daniel Boone
  went in search of the missing man, for it was possible that Jim Lovelle had
  gone to seek ammunition from friendly Indians. If he did not turn up or if he
  returned without powder, there would be nothing for it but to send a
  messenger back through the Gap for supplies.</p>

  <p>The dawn was blue and cloudless and the air had the freshness of a second
  spring. The autumn colour glowed once more, only a little tarnished; the gold
  was now copper, the scarlet and vermilion were dulling to crimson. Boone took
  the road at the earliest light and made for the place where the day before he
  had parted from Lovelle. When alone he had the habit of talking to himself in
  an undertone. "Jim was hunting down the west bank of that there crick, and I
  heard a shot about noon beyond them big oaks, so I reckon he'd left the water
  and gotten on the ridge." He picked up the trail and followed it with
  difficulty, for the rain had flattened out the prints. At one point he halted
  and considered. "That's queer," he muttered. "Jim was running here. It wasn't
  game, neither, for there's no sign of their tracks." He pointed to the
  zig-zag of moccasin prints in a patch of gravel. "That's the way a man sets
  his feet when he's in a hurry,"</p>

  <p>A little later he stood and sniffed, with his brows wrinkled. He made an
  epic figure as he leaned forward, every sense strained, every muscle alert,
  slim and shapely as a Greek&mdash; the eternal pathfinder. Very gently he
  smelled the branches of a mulberry thicket.</p>

  <p>"There's been an Indian here," he meditated. "I kinder smell the grease on
  them twigs. In a hurry, too, or he wouldn't have left his stink behind...  In
  war trim, I reckon." And he took a tiny wisp of scarlet feather from a
  fork.</p>

  <p>Like a hound he nosed about the ground till he found something. "Here's
  his print;" he said "He was a-followin' Jim, for see! he has his foot in
  Jim's track. I don't like it. I'm fear'd of what's comin'."</p>

  <p>Slowly and painfully he traced the footing, which led through the thicket
  towards a long ridge running northward. In an open grassy place he almost
  cried out. "The redskin and Jim was friends. See, here's their prints side by
  side, going slow. What in thunder was old Jim up to?"</p>

  <p>The trail was plainer now, and led along the scarp of the ridge to a
  little promontory which gave a great prospect over the flaming forests and
  yellow glades. Boone found a crinkle of rock where he flung himself down.
  "It's plain enough," he said. "They come up here to spy. They were fear'd of
  something, and whatever it was it was coming from the west. See, they kep'
  under the east side of this ridge so as not to be seen, and they settled down
  to spy whar they couldn't be obsarved from below. I reckon Jim and the
  redskin had a pretty good eye for cover."</p>

  <p>He examined every inch of the eyrie, sniffing like. a pointer dog. "I'm
  plumb puzzled about this redskin," he confessed. "Shawnee, Cherokee,
  Chickasaw&mdash;it ain't likely Jim would have dealings with 'em. It might be
  one of them Far Indians."</p>

  <p>It appeared as if Lovelle had spent most of the previous afternoon on the
  ridge, for he found the remains of his night's fire half way down the north
  side in a hollow thatched with vines. It was now about three o'clock. Boone,
  stepping delicately, examined the ashes, and then sat himself on the ground
  and brooded.</p>

  <p>When at last he lifted his eyes his face was perplexed.</p>

  <p>"I can't make it out nohow. Jim and this Indian was good friends. They
  were feelin' pretty safe, for they made a mighty careless fire and didn't
  stop to tidy it up. But likewise they was restless, for they started out long
  before morning...  I read it this way. Jim met a redskin that he knowed
  before and thought he could trust anyhow, and he's gone off with him seeking
  powder. It'd be like Jim to dash off alone and play his hand like that. He
  figured he'd come back to us with what we needed and that we'd have the sense
  to wait for him. I guess that's right. But I'm uneasy about the redskin. If
  he's from north of the river, there's a Mingo camp somewhere about and
  they've gone there...  I never had much notion of Seneca Indians, and I
  reckon Jim's took a big risk."</p>

  <p>All evening he followed the trail, which crossed the low hills into the
  corn-brakes and woodlands of a broader valley. Presently he saw that he had
  been right, and that Lovelle and the Indian had begun their journey in the
  night, for the prints showed like those of travellers in darkness. Before
  sunset Boone grew very anxious. He found traces converging, till a clear path
  was worn in the grass like a regulation war trail. It was not one of the
  known trails, so it had been made for a purpose; he found on tree trunks the
  tiny blazons of the scouts who had been sent ahead to survey it. It was a war
  party of Mingos, or whoever they might be, and he did not like it. He was
  puzzled to know what purchase Jim could have with those outland folk...  And
  yet he had been on friendly terms with the scout he had picked up...  Another
  fact disturbed him. Lovelle's print had been clear enough till the other
  Indians joined him. The light was bad, but now that print seemed to have
  disappeared. It might be due to the general thronging of marks in the trail,
  but it might be that Jim was a prisoner, trussed and helpless.</p>

  <p>He supped off cold jerked bear's meat and slept two hours in the canes,
  waiting on the moonrise. He had bad dreams, for he seemed to hear drums
  beating the eerie tattoo which he remembered long ago in Border raids. He
  woke in a sweat, and took the road again in the moonlight. It was not hard to
  follow, and it seemed to be making north for the Ohio. Dawn came on him in a
  grassy bottom, beyond which lay low hills that he knew alone separated him
  from the great river. Once in the Indian Moon of Blossom he had been thus
  far, and had gloried in the riches of the place, where a man walked knee deep
  in honeyed clover. "The dark and bloody land!" He remembered how he had
  repeated the name to himself, and had concluded that Lovelle had been right
  and that it was none of the Almighty's giving. Now in the sharp autumn
  morning he felt its justice. A cloud had come over his cheerful soul. "If
  only I knowed about Jim," he muttered "I wonder if I'll ever clap eyes or his
  old face again." Never before had he known such acute anxiety. Pioneers are
  wont to trust each other and in their wild risks assume that the odd chance
  is on their side. But now black forebodings possessed him, born not of
  reasoning but of instinct. His comrade somewhere just ahead of him was in
  deadly peril.</p>

  <p>And then came the drums.</p>

  <p>The sound broke into the still dawn with a harsh challenge. They were war
  drums, beaten as he remembered them in Montgomery's campaign. He quickened
  his steady hunter's lope into a run, and left the trail for the thickets of
  the hill-side. The camp was less than a mile off and he was taking no
  chances.</p>

  <p>As he climbed the hill the drums grew louder, till it seemed that the
  whole world rocked with their noise. He told himself feverishly that there
  was nothing to fear; Jim was with friends, who had been south of the river on
  their own business and would give him the powder he wanted. Presently they
  would be returning to the camp together, and in the months to come he and Jim
  would make that broad road through the Gap, at the end of which would spring
  up smiling farmsteads and townships of their own naming. He told himself
  these things, but he knew that he lied.</p>

  <p>At last, flat on the earth, he peered through the vines on the north edge
  of the ridge. Below him, half a mile off, rolled the Ohio, a little swollen
  by the rains There was a broad ford, and the waters had spilled out over the
  fringe of sand. Just under him, between the bluff and the river, lay the
  Mingo camp, every detail of it plain in the crisp weather.</p>

  <p>In the heart of it a figure stood bound to a stake, and a smoky fire
  burned at its feet...  There was no mistaking that figure.</p>

  <p>Boone bit the grass in a passion of fury. His first impulse was to rush
  madly into the savages' camp and avenge his friend. He had half risen to his
  feet when his reason told him it was folly. He had no weapon but axe and
  knife, and would only add another scalp to their triumph. His Deckard was
  slung on his back, but he had no powder. Oh, to be able to send a bullet
  through Jim's head to cut short his torment! In all his life he had never
  known such mental anguish, waiting there an impotent witness of the agony of
  his friend. The blood trickled from his bitten lips and film was over his
  eyes...  Lovelle was dying for him and the others. He saw it all with bitter
  clearness. Jim had been inveigled to the Mingo camp taking risks as he always
  did, and there been ordered to reveal the whereabouts of the hunting party.
  He had refused, and endured the ordeal...  Memories of their long comradeship
  rushed through Boone's mind and set him weeping in a fury of affection. There
  was never such a man as old Jim, so trusty and wise and kind, and now that
  great soul was being tortured out of that stalwart body and he could only
  look on like a baby and cry.</p>

  <p>As he gazed, it became plain that the man at the stake was dead. His head
  had fallen on his chest, and the Indians were cutting the green withies that
  bound him. Boone looked to see them take his scalp, and so wild was his rage
  that his knees were already bending for the onslaught which should be the
  death of him and haply of one or two of the murderers.</p>

  <p>But no knife was raised. The Indians seemed to consult together, and one
  of them gave an order. Deerskins were brought and the body was carefully
  wrapped in them and laid on a litter of branches. Their handling of it seemed
  almost reverent. The camp was moving, the horses were saddled, and presently
  the whole band began to file off towards the forest. The sight held Boone
  motionless. His fury had gone and only wonder and awe remained. As they
  passed the dead, each Indian raised his axe in salute&mdash;the salute to a
  great chief. The next minute they were splashing through the ford.</p>

  <p>An hour later, when the invaders had disappeared on the northern levels,
  Boone slipped down from the bluff to the camping place. He stood still a long
  time by his friend, taking off his deerskin cap, so that his long black hair
  was blown over his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Jim, boy," he said softly. "I reckon you was the general of us all. The
  likes of you won't come again. I'd like ye to have Christian burial."</p>

  <p>With his knife he hollowed a grave, where he placed the body, still
  wrapped in its deerskins. He noted on a finger of one hand a gold ring, a
  queer possession for a backwoodsman. This he took off and dropped into the
  pouch which hung round his neck. "I reckon it'd better go to Mis' Hanks.
  Jim's gal 'ud valley it mor'n a wanderin' coyote."</p>

  <p>When he had filled in the earth he knelt among the grasses and repeated
  the Lord's Prayer as well as he could remember it. Then he stood up and
  rubbed with his hard brown knuckles the dimness from his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Ye was allus lookin' for something, Jim," he said. "I guess ye've found
  it now. Good luck to ye, old comrade."</p><br>

  <h2>THE LAST STAGE</h2>

  <p>A small boy crept into the darkened hut. The unglazed windows were roughly
  curtained with skins, but there was sufficient light from the open doorway to
  show him what he wanted. He tiptoed to a corner where an old travelling trunk
  lay under a pile of dirty clothes. He opened it very carefully, and after a
  little searching found the thing he sought. Then he gently closed it, and,
  with a look towards the bed in the other corner, he slipped out again into
  the warm October afternoon.</p>

  <p>The woman on the bed stirred uneasily and suddenly became fully awake,
  after the way of those who are fluttering very near death. She was still
  young, and the little face among the coarse homespun blankets looked almost
  childish. Heavy masses of black hair lay on the pillow, and the depth of its
  darkness increased the pallour of her brow. But the cheeks were flushed, and
  the deep hazel eyes were burning with a slow fire...  For a week the
  milk-sick fever had raged furiously, and in the few hours free from delirium
  she had been racked with omnipresent pain and deadly sickness. Now those had
  gone, and she was drifting out to sea on a tide of utter weakness. Her
  husband, Tom Linkhorn, thought she mending, and was even now
  whistling&mdash;the first time for weeks&mdash;by the woodpile. But the woman
  knew that she was close to the great change, and so deep was her weariness
  that the knowledge remained an instinct rather than a thought. She was as
  passive as a dying animal. The cabin was built of logs, mortised into each
  other&mdash;triangular in shape, with a fireplace in one corner. Beside the
  fire stood a table made of a hewn log, on which lay some pewter dishes
  containing the remains of he last family meal. One or two three-legged stools
  made up the rest of the furniture, except for the trunk in the corner and the
  bed. This bed was Tom Linkhorn's pride, which he used to boast about to his
  friends, for he was a tolerable carpenter. It was made of plank stuck between
  the logs of the wall, and supported at the other end by crotched sticks. By
  way of a curtain top a hickory post had been sunk in the floor and bent over
  the bed, the end being fixed in the log wall. Tom meant to have a fine skin
  curtain fastened to it when winter came. The floor was of beaten earth, but
  there was a rough ceiling of smaller logs, with a trap in it which could be
  reached by pegs stuck the centre post. In that garret the children slept.
  Tom's building zeal had come to an end with the bed. Some day he meant to fit
  in a door and windows, but these luxuries could wait till he got his clearing
  in better order.</p>

  <p>On a stool by the bed stood a wooden bowl containing gruel. The woman had
  not eaten for days, and the stuff had a thick scum on it. The place was very
  stuffy, for it was a hot and sickly autumn day and skins which darkened the
  window holes kept out the little freshness that was in the air. Beside the
  gruel was a tin pannikin of cold water which the boy ,Abe fetched every hour
  from the spring. She saw the water, but was too weak to reach it.</p>

  <p>The shining doorway was blocked by a man's entrance. Tom Linkhorn was a
  little over middle height, with long muscular arms, and the corded neck
  sinews which tell of great strength. He had a shock of coarse black hair,
  grey eyes and a tired sallow face, as of one habitually overworked and
  underfed. His jaw was heavy, but loosely put together, so that he presented
  an air of weakness and irresolution. His lips were thick and pursed in a kind
  of weary good humour. He wore an old skin shirt and a pair of tow-linen
  pants, which flapped about his bare brown ankles. A fine sawdust coated his
  hair and shoulders, for he had been working in the shed where he eked out his
  farming by making spinning wheels for his neighbours.</p>

  <p>He came softly to the bedside and looked down at his wife. His face was
  gentle and puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Reckon you're better, dearie," he said in a curious harsh toneless
  voice.</p>

  <p>The sick woman moved her head feebly in the direction of the stool and he
  lifted the pannikin of water to her lips.</p>

  <p>"Cold enough?" he asked, and his wife nodded. "Abe fetches it as reg'lar
  as a clock."</p>

  <p>"Where's Abe?" she asked, and her voice for all its feebleness had a
  youthful music in it.</p>

  <p>"I heerd him sayin' he was goin' down to the crick to cotch a fish. He
  reckoned you'd fancy a fish when you could eat a piece. He's a mighty
  thoughtful boy, our Abe. Then he was comin' to read to you. You'd like that,
  dearie?"</p>

  <p>The sick woman made no sign. Her eyes were vacantly regarding the
  doorway.</p>

  <p>"I've got to leave you now. I reckon I'll borrow the Dawneys' sorrel horse
  and ride into Gentryville. I've got the young hogs to sell, and I'll fetch
  back the corn-meal from Hickson's. Sally Hickson was just like you last fall,
  and I want to find out from Jim how she got her strength up."</p>

  <p>He put a hand on her brow, and felt it cool.</p>

  <p>"Glory! You're mendin' fast, Nancy gal. You'll be well in time to can the
  berries that the childern's picked. He fished from below the bed a pair of
  skin brogues and slipped them on his feet. "I'll be back before night."</p>

  <p>"I want Abe," she moaned.</p>

  <p>"I'll send him to you," he said as he went out</p>

  <p>Left alone the woman lay still for a little in a stupor of weariness.
  Waves of that terrible lassitude, which is a positive anguish and not a mere
  absence of strength, flowed over her. The square of the doorway, which was
  directly before her eyes, began to take strange forms. It was filled with
  yellow sunlight, and a red glow beyond told of the sugar-maples at the edge
  of the clearing. Now it seemed to her unquiet sight to be a furnace. Outside
  the world was burning; she could feel the heat of it in the close cabin. For
  a second acute fear startled her weakness. It passed, her eyes cleared, and
  she saw the homely doorway as it was, and heard the gobble of a turkey in the
  forest.</p>

  <p>The fright had awakened her mind and senses. For the first time she fully
  realised her condition. Life no longer moved steadily in her body; it
  flickered and wavered and would soon gutter out...  Her eyes marked every
  detail of the squalor around her&mdash;the unwashed dishes, the foul earthen
  floor, the rotting apple pile, the heap of rags which had been her only
  clothes. She was leaving the world, and this was all she had won from it.
  Sheer misery forced a sigh which seemed to rend her frail body, and her eyes
  filled with tears. She had been a dreamer, an adept at make-believe, but the
  poor coverings she had wrought for a dingy reality were now too threadbare to
  hide it.</p>

  <p>And once she had been so rich in hope. She would make her husband a great
  man, and&mdash;when that was manifestly impossible without a rebirth of Tom
  Linkhorn&mdash;she would have a son who would wear a black coat like Lawyer
  Macneil and Colonel Hardin way back in Kentucky, and make fine speeches
  beginning "Fellow countrymen and gentlemen of this famous State." She had a
  passion for words, and sonorous phrases haunted her memory. She herself would
  have a silk gown and a bonnet with roses in it; once long ago she had been to
  Elizabethtown and seen just such a gown and bonnet...  Or Tom would be
  successful in this wild Indiana country and be, like Daniel Boone, the father
  of a new State, and have places and towns called for him&mdash; a Nancyville
  perhaps or a Linkhorn County. She knew about Daniel Boone, for her
  grandfather Hanks had been with him...  And there had been other dreams,
  older dreams, dating far back to the days when she was a little girl with
  eyes like a brown owl. Someone had told her fairy-tales about princesses and
  knights, strange beings which she never quite understood, but of which she
  made marvellous pictures in her head She had learned to read in order to
  follow up the doings of those queer bright folk, but she had never tracked
  them down again. But one book she had got called The Pilgrim's Progress,
  printed by missionaries in a far-away city called Philadelphia, which told of
  things as marvellous, and had pictures, too&mdash;one especially of a young
  man covered with tin, which she supposed was what they called armour. And
  there was another called The Arabian Knights, a close-printed thing difficult
  to read by the winter fire, full of wilder doings than any she could imagine
  for herself; but beautiful, too, and delicious to muse over, though Tom, when
  she read a chapter to him, had condemned it as a pack of lies...  Clearly
  there was a world somewhere, perhaps outside America altogether, far more
  wonderful than even the magnificence of Colonel Hardin. Once she had hoped to
  find it herself; then that her children should find it. And the end was this
  shack in the wilderness, a few acres of rotting crops, bitter starving
  winters, summers of fever, the deeps of poverty, a penniless futureless
  family, and for herself a coffin of green lumber and a yard or two of stony
  soil.</p>

  <p>She saw everything now with the clear unrelenting eyes of childhood. The
  films she had woven for self-protection were blown aside. She was
  dying&mdash;she had often wondered how she should feel when
  dying&mdash;humble and trustful, she had hoped, for she was religious after a
  fashion, and had dreamed herself into an affection for a kind fatherly God.
  But now all that had gone. She was bitter, like one defrauded She had been
  promised something, and had struggled on in the assurance of it. And the
  result was nothing&mdash;nothing. Tragic tears filled her eyes. She had been
  so hungry' and there was to be no satisfying that hunger this side the grave
  or beyond it. She was going the same way as Betsy Sparrow, a death like a
  cow's, with nothing to show for life, nothing to leave. Betsy had been a poor
  crushed creature, and had looked for no more. But she was different. She had
  been promised something, something fine&mdash;she couldn't remember what, or
  who had promised it, but it had never been out of her mind.</p>

  <p>There was the ring, too. No woman in Indiana had the like of that. An ugly
  thing, but very ancient and of pure gold. Once Tom had wanted to sell it when
  he was hard-pressed back at Nolin Creek, but she had fought for it like a
  tigress and scared the life out of Tom. Her grandfather had left it her
  because she was his favourite and it had been her grandmothers, and long ago
  had come from Europe. It was lucky, and could cure rheumatism if worn next
  the heart in a skin bag...  All her thoughts were suddenly set on the ring,
  her one poor shred of fortune. She wanted to feel it on her finger, and press
  its cool gold with the queer markings on her eyelids.</p>

  <p>But Tom had gone away and she couldn't reach the trunk in the corner.
  Tears trickled down her cheeks and through the mist of them she saw that the
  boy Abe stood at the foot of the bed.</p>

  <p>"Feelin' comfortabler?" he asked. He had a harsh untunable voice, his
  father's, but harsher, and he spoke the drawling dialect of the
  backwoods.</p>

  <p>His figure stood in the light, so that the dying mother saw only its
  outline. He was a boy about nine years old, but growing too fast, so that he
  had lost the grace of childhood and was already lanky and ungainly. As he
  turned his face crosswise to the light he revealed a curiously rugged
  profile&mdash;a big nose springing sharply from the brow, a thick, underhung
  lower lip, and the beginning of a promising Adam's apple. His stiff black
  hair fell round his great ears, which stood out like the handles of a
  pitcher. He was barefoot, and wore a pair of leather breeches and a ragged
  homespun shirt. Beyond doubt he was ugly.</p>

  <p>He moved round to the right side of the bed where he was wholly in
  shadow.</p>

  <p>"My lines is settin' nicely," he said. "I'll have a fish for your supper.
  And then I'm goin' to take dad's gun and fetch you a turkey. You could eat a
  slice of a fat turkey, I reckon."</p>

  <p>The woman did not answer, for she was thinking. This uncouth boy was the
  son she had put her faith in. She loved him best of all things on earth, but
  for the moment she saw him in the hard light of disillusionment. A loutish
  backwoods child, like Dennis Hanks or Tom Sparrow or anybody else. He had
  been a comfort to her, for he had been quick to learn and had a strange
  womanish tenderness in his ways. But she was leaving him, and he would grow
  up like his father before him to a life of ceaseless toil with no daylight or
  honour in it...  She almost hated the sight of him, for he was the memorial
  of her failure.</p>

  <p>The boy did not guess these thoughts. He pulled up a stool and sat very
  close to the bed, holding his mother's frail wrist in a sunburnt hand so big
  that it might have been that of a lad half-way through his teens. He had
  learned in the woods to be neat and precise in his ways, and his movements,
  for all his gawky look, were as soft as a panther's.</p>

  <p>"Like me to tell you a story?" he asked. "What about Uncle Mord's tale of
  Dan'l Boone at the Blue Licks Battle?"</p>

  <p>There was no response, so he tried again.</p>

  <p>Or read a piece? It was the Bible last time, but the words is mighty
  difficult. Besides you don't need it that much now. You're gettin' better...
  Let's hear about the ol' Pilgrim."</p>

  <p>He found a squat duodecimo in the trunk, and shifted the skin curtain from
  one of the window holes to get light to read by. His mother lay very still
  with her eyes shut, but he knew by her breathing that she was not asleep. He
  ranged through the book, stopping to study the crude pictures, and then
  started laboriously to read the adventures of Christian and Hopeful after
  leaving Vanity Fair&mdash;the mine of Demas, the plain called Ease, Castle
  Doubting, and the Delectable Mountains. He boggled over some of the words,
  but on the whole he read well, and his harsh voice dropped into a pleasant
  sing-song.</p>

  <p>By and by he noticed that his mother was asleep. He took the tin pannikin
  and filled it with fresh water from the spring. Then he kissed the hand which
  lay on the blanket, looked about guiltily to see if anyone had seen him, for
  kisses were rare in that household and tiptoes out again.</p>

  <p>The woman slept, but not wholly. The doorway, which was now filled with
  the deeper gold of the westering sun, was still in her vision. It had grown
  to a great square of light, and instead of being blocked in the foreground by
  the forest it seemed to give on an infinite distance. She had a sense not of
  looking out of a hut, but of looking from without into a great chamber. Peace
  descended on her which she had never known before in her feverish dreams,
  peace and a happy expectation.</p>

  <p>She had not listened to Abe's reading, but some words of it had caught her
  ear. The phrase "delectable mountains" for one. She did not know what
  "delectable" meant, but it sounded good; and mountains, though she had never
  seen more of them than a far blue line, had always pleased her fancy. Now she
  seemed to be looking at them through that magical doorway...  The country was
  not like anything she remembered in the Kentucky bluegrass, still less like
  the shaggy woods of Indiana. The turf was short and very green, and the hills
  fell into gracious folds that promised homesteads in every nook of them. It
  was a "delectable" country&mdash;yes, that was the meaning of the word that
  had puzzled her...  She had seen the picture before in her head. She
  remembered one hot Sunday afternoon when she was a child hearing a Baptist
  preacher discoursing on a Psalm, something about the "little hills
  rejoicing." She had liked the words and made a picture in her mind. These
  were the little hills and they were joyful.</p>

  <p>There was a white road running straight through them till it disappeared
  over a crest. That was right, of course. The road which the Pilgrims
  travelled...  And there, too, was a Pilgrim.</p>

  <p>He was a long way off, but she could see him quite clearly. He was a boy,
  older than Abe, but about the same size&mdash;a somewhat forlorn figure, who
  seemed as if he had a great way to go and was oppressed by the knowledge of
  it. He had funny things on his legs and feet, which were not proper
  moccasins. Once he looked back, and she had a glimpse of fair hair. He could
  not be any of the Hanks or Linkhorn kin, for they were all dark...  But he
  had something on his left arm which she recognised&mdash;a thick ring of
  gold. It was her own ring, the ring she kept in the trunk and she smiled
  comfortably. She had wanted it a little while ago, and now there it was
  before her eyes. She had no anxiety about its safety, for somehow it belonged
  to that little boy as well as to her.</p>

  <p>His figure moved fast and was soon out of sight round a turn of the hill.
  And with that the landscape framed in the doorway began to waver and dislimn.
  The road was still there, white and purposeful, but the environs were
  changing...  She was puzzled, but with a pleasant confusion. Her mind was not
  on the landscape, but on the people, for she was assured that others would
  soon appear on the enchanted stage.</p>

  <p>He ran across the road, shouting with joy, a dog at his heels and a bow in
  his hand. Before he disappeared she marked the ring, this time on his finger
 ...  He had scarcely gone ere another appeared on the road, a slim pale child,
  dressed in some stuff that gleamed like satin, and mounted on a pony...  The
  spectacle delighted her, for it brought her in mind of the princes she had
  been told of in fairy-tales. And there was the ring, worn over a saffron
  riding glove... </p>

  <p>A sudden weakness made her swoon; and out of it she woke to a
  consciousness of the hut where she lay. She had thought she was dead and in
  heaven among fair children, and the waking made her long for her own child.
  Surely that was Abe in the doorway...  No, it was a taller and older lad,
  oddly dressed, but he had a look of Abe&mdash;something in his eyes. He was
  on the road too, and marching purposefully&mdash;and he had the ring. Even in
  her mortal frailty she had a quickening of the heart. These strange people
  had something to do with her, something to tell her, and that something was
  about her son... </p>

  <p>There was a new boy in the picture. A dejected child who rubbed the ring
  on his small breeches and played with it, looking up now and then with a
  frightened start. The woman's heart ached for him, for she knew her own
  life-long malady. He was hungry for something which he had small hope of
  finding...  And then a wind seemed to blow out-of-doors and the world
  darkened down to evening. But her eyes pierced the gloaming easily, and she
  saw very plain the figure of a man.</p>

  <p>He was sitting hunched up, with his chin in his hands, gazing into
  vacancy. Without surprise she recognised something in his face that was her
  own. He wore the kind of hunter's clothes that old folk had worn in her
  childhood, and a long gun lay across his knees. His air was sombre and
  wistful, and yet with a kind of noble content in it. He had Abe's puckered-up
  lips and Abe's steady sad eyes...  Into her memory came a verse of the
  Scriptures which had always fascinated her. "These all died in faith, not
  having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were
  persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers
  and pilgrims upon the earth "</p>

  <p>She saw it all in a flash of enlightenment. These seekers throughout the
  ages had been looking for something and had not found it. But Abe, her son,
  was to find it. That was why she had been shown those pictures.</p>

  <p>Once again she looked through the door into bright sunshine. It was a
  place that she knew beside the Ohio she remembered the tall poplar clump. She
  did not see the Jacksons' farm which stood south of the trees, but there was
  the Indian graveyard, which as a little girl she had been afraid to pass. Now
  it seemed to be fresh made, for painted vermilion wands stood about the
  mounds. On one of them was a gold trinket, tied by a loop of hide, rattled in
  the wind. It was her ring. The seeker lay buried there with the talisman
  above him.</p>

  <p>She was awake now, oblivious of the swift sinking of her vital energy. She
  must have the ring, for it was the pledge of a great glory... </p>

  <p>A breathless little girl flung herself into the cabin. It was Sophy Hanks,
  one of the many nieces who squattered like ducks about the settlement.</p>

  <p>"Mammy!" she cried shrilly. "Mammy Linkorn!" She stammered with the
  excitement of the bearer of ill news. "Abe's lost your ring in the crick. He
  took it for a sinker to his lines, for Indian Jake telled him a piece of gold
  would cotch the grit fish. And a grit fish has cotched it. Abe's bin divn'
  and divn' and can't find it nohow. He reckons it's plumb Ain't he a bad 'un,
  Mammy Linkhorn?"</p>

  <p>It was some time before the dying woman understood. Then she began feebly
  to cry. For the moment her ring loomed large in her eyes: it was the earnest
  of the promise, and without it the promise might fail. She had not strength
  to speak or even to sob, and the tears trickled over her cheeks in dumb
  impotent misery.</p>

  <p>She was roused by the culprit Abe. He stood beside her with his wet hair
  streaked into a fringe along his brow. The skin of his neck glistened wet in
  the opening of his shirt. His cheeks too glistened, but not with the water of
  the creek. He was crying bitterly.</p>

  <p>He had no words of explanation or defence. His thick underlip stuck out
  and gave him the appeal of a penitent dog; the tears had furrowed paler
  channels down grimy cheeks; he was the very incarnation of uncouth
  misery.</p>

  <p>But his mother saw none of these things...  On the instant he seemed to
  her transfigured. Something she saw in him of all the generations of pleading
  boys that had passed before her, something of the stern confidence of the man
  over whose grave the ring had fluttered. But more&mdash;far more. She was
  assured that the day of the seekers had passed and that the finder had come
 ...  The young features were transformed into the lines of a man's strength.
  The eyes dreamed but also commanded, the loose mouth had the gold of wisdom
  and the steel of resolution. The promise had not failed her...  She had won
  everything from life, for she had given the world a master. Words seemed to
  speak themselves in her ear...  "Bethink you of the blessedness. Every wife
  is like the Mother of God and has the hope of bearing a saviour of
  mankind."</p>

  <p>She lay very still in her great joy. The boy in a fright sprang to her
  side, knocking over the stool with the pannikin of water. He knelt on the
  floor and hid his face in the bed-clothes. Her hand found his shaggy
  head.</p>

  <p>Her voice was very faint now, but he heard it.</p>

  <p>"Don't cry, little Abe," she said. "Don't you worry about the ring,
  dearie. It ain't needed no more.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later, when the cabin door was dim with twilight, the hand
  which the boy held grew cold.</p><br>

  <h2>THE END OF THE ROAD</h2>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p>When Edward M. Stanton was associated at Cincinnati in 1857 with Abraham
  Lincoln in the great McCormick Reaper patent suit, it was commonly assumed
  that this was the first time the two men had met. Such was Lincoln's view,
  for his memory was apt to have blind patches in it. But in fact there had
  been a meeting fifteen years before, the recollection of which in Stanton's
  mind had been so overlaid by the accumulations of a busy life that it did not
  awake till after the President's death.</p>

  <p>In the early fall of 1842 Stanton had occasion to visit Illinois. He was
  then twenty-five years of age, and had already attained the position of
  leading lawyer in his native town of Steubenville in Ohio and acted as
  reporter of the Supreme Court of that State. He was a solemn reserved young
  man, with a square fleshy face and a strong ill-tempered jaw. His tight lips
  curved downwards at the corners and, combined with his bold eyes, gave him an
  air of peculiar shrewdness and purpose. He did not forget that he came of
  good professional stock&mdash;New England on one side and Virginia on the
  other&mdash;and that he was college-bred, unlike the common backwoods
  attorney. Also he was resolved on a great career, with the White House at the
  end of it, and was ready to compel all whom he met to admit the justice of
  his ambition The conscious of uncommon talent and a shining future gave him a
  self-possession rare in a young man, and a complacence not unlike arrogance.
  His dress suited his pretensions&mdash;the soft rich broadcloth which tailors
  called doeskin, and linen of a fineness rare outside the eastern cities. He
  was not popular in Ohio, but he was respected for his sharp tongue, subtle
  brain, and intractable honesty.</p>

  <p>His business finished, he had the task of filling up the evening, for he
  could not leave for home till the morrow. His host, Mr. George Curtin, was a
  little shy of his guest and longed profoundly to see the last of him. It was
  obvious that this alert lawyer regarded the Springfield folk as
  mossbacks&mdash;which might be well enough for St. Louis and Chicago, but was
  scarcely becoming in a man from Steubenville. Another kind of visitor he
  might have taken to a chicken-fight, but one glance at Stanton barred that
  solution. So he compromised on Speed's store.</p>

  <p>"There's one or two prominent citizens gathered there most nights," he
  explained. "Like as not we'll find Mr. Lincoln. I reckon you've heard of Abe
  Lincoln?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Stanton had not. He denied the imputation as if he were annoyed.</p>

  <p>"Well, we think a mighty lot of him round here. He's Judge Logan's law
  partner and considered one of the brightest in Illinois. He's been returned
  to the State Legislature two or three times, and he's a dandy on the stump. A
  hot Whig and none the worse of that, though I reckon them's not your politics
 ...  We're kind of proud of him in Sangamon county. No, not a native. Rode
  into the town one day five years back from New Salem with all his belongings
  in a saddle-bag, and started business next morning in Joe Speed's back room
 ...  He's good company, Abe, for you never heard a better man to tell a story.
  You'd die of laughing. Though I did hear he was a sad man just now along of
  being crossed in love, so I can't promise you he'll be up to his usual, if
  he's at Speed's to-night."</p>

  <p>"I suppose the requirements for a western lawyer," said Mr. Stanton
  acidly, "are a gift of buffoonery and a reputation for gallantry." He was
  intensely bored, and had small desire to make the acquaintance of provincial
  celebrities.</p>

  <p>Mr. Curtin was offended, but could think of no suitable retort, and as
  they were close on Speed's store he swallowed his wrath and led the way
  through alleys of piled merchandise to the big room where the stove was
  lighted.</p>

  <p>It was a chilly fall night and the fire was welcome. Half a dozen men sat
  smoking round it, with rummers of reeking toddy at their elbows. They were
  ordinary citizens of the place, and they talked of the last horse-races. As
  the new-comers entered they were appealing to a figure perched on a high
  barrel to decide some point in dispute.</p>

  <p>This figure climbed down from its perch, as they entered, with a sort of
  awkward courtesy. It was a very tall man, thin almost to emaciation, with
  long arms and big hands and feet. He had a lean, powerful-looking head,
  marred by ugly projecting ears and made shapeless by a mass of untidy black
  hair. The brow was broad and fine, and the dark eyes set deep under it; the
  nose, too, was good, but the chin and mouth were too small for the
  proportions of the face. The mouth, indeed, was so curiously puckered, and
  the lower lip so thick and prominent, as to give something of a comic effect.
  The skin was yellow, but stretched so firm and hard on the cheek bones that
  the sallowness did not look unhealthy. The man wore an old suit of blue jeans
  and his pantaloons did not meet his coarse unblacked shoes by six inches. His
  scraggy throat was adorned with a black neckerchief like a boot-lace.</p>

  <p>"Abe," said Mr. Curtin, "I would like to make you known to my friend Mr.
  Stanton of Ohio."</p>

  <p>The queer face broke into a pleasant smile, and the long man held out his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Glad to know you, Mr. Stanton," he said, and then seemed to be stricken
  with shyness. His wandering eye caught sight of a new patent churn which had
  just been added to Mr. Speed's stock. He took two steps to it and was
  presently deep in its mechanism. He turned it all ways, knelt beside it on
  the floor, took off the handle and examined it, while the rest of the company
  pressed Mr. Stanton to a seat by the fire.</p>

  <p>"I heard Abe was out at Rochester helping entertain Ex-President Van
  Buren," said Mr. Curtin to the store-keeper.</p>

  <p>"I reckon he was," said Speed. "He kept them roaring till morning. Judge
  Peck told me he allowed Mr. Van Buren would be stiff for a month with
  laughing at Abe's tales. It's curious that a man who don't use tobacco or
  whisky should be such mighty good company."</p>

  <p>"I wish Abe'd keep it up," said another. "Most of the time now he goes
  about like a sick dog. What's come to him, Joe?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Speed hushed his voice. "He's got his own troubles...  He's a
  deep-feeling man, and can't forget easily like you and me...  But things is
  better with him, and I kind of hope to see him wed by Thanks. giving Day...
  Look at him with that churn. He's that inquisitive he can't keep his hands
  off no new thing."</p>

  <p>But the long man had finished his inquiry and rejoined the group by the
  stove.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were a lawyer, Mr. Lincoln," said Stanton, "but you seem to
  have the tastes of a mechanic."</p>

  <p>The other grinned. "I've a fancy for any kind of instrument, for I was a
  surveyor in this county before I took to law."</p>

  <p>"George Washington also was a surveyor."</p>

  <p>"Also, but not <i>likewise</i>. I don't consider I was much of a hand with
  the compass and chains."</p>

  <p>"It is the fashion in Illinois, I gather, for the law to be the last in a
  series of many pursuits&mdash;the pool where the driftwood from many streams
  comes to rest." Mr. Stanton spoke with the superior air of one who took his
  profession seriously and had been trained for it in the orthodox fashion.</p>

  <p>"It was so in my case. I've kept a post-office, and I've had a store, and
  I've had a tavern, and I kept them so darned bad that I'm still paying off
  the debts I made in them." The long man made the confession with a comic
  simplicity.</p>

  <p>"There's a deal to be said for the habit," said Speed. "Having followed
  other trades teaches a lawyer something about human nature. I reckon Abe
  wouldn't be the man he is if he had studied his books all his days."</p>

  <p>"There is another side to that," said Mr. Stanton and his precise accents
  and well-modulated voice seemed foreign in that homely place. "You are also a
  politician, Mr. Lincoln?"</p>

  <p>The other nodded. "Of a kind. I'm a strong Henry Clay man."</p>

  <p>"Well, there I oppose you. I'm no Whig or lover of Whigs. But I'm a lover
  of the Constitution and the law of the country, and that Constitution and
  that country are approaching perilous times. There's explosive stuff about
  which is going to endanger the stability of the noble heritage we have
  received from our fathers, and if that heritage is to be saved it can only be
  by those who hold fast to its eternal principles. This land can only be saved
  by its lawyers, sir. But they must be lawyers profoundly read in the history
  and philosophy of their profession, and no catchpenny advocates with a glib
  tongue and an elastic conscience. The true lawyer must approach his task with
  reverence and high preparation; for as his calling is the noblest of human
  activities, so it is the most exacting."</p>

  <p>The <i>Point-Device</i> young man spoke with a touch of the schoolmaster,
  but his audience, who had an inborn passion for fine words, were impressed.
  Lincoln sat squatted on his heels on a bit of sacking, staring into the open
  door of the stove.</p>

  <p>"There's truth in that," he said slowly. His voice had not the mellow
  tones of the other's, being inclined to shrillness, but it gave the
  impression of great power waiting on release somewhere in his massive chest.
  "But I reckon it's only half the truth, for truth's like a dollar-piece, it's
  got two sides, and both are wanted to make it good currency. The law and the
  constitution are like a child's pants. They've got to be made wider and
  longer as the child grows so as to fit him. If they're kept too tight, he'll
  burst them; and if you're in a hurry and make them too big all at once,
  they'll trip him up."</p>

  <p>"Agreed," said Stanton, "but the fashion and the fabric should be kept of
  the same good American pattern."</p>

  <p>The long man ran a hand through his thatch of hair.</p>

  <p>"There's only one fashion in pants&mdash;to make them comfortable. And
  some day that boy is going to grow so big you won't be able to make the old
  ones do and he'll have to get a new pair. If he's living on a farm he'll want
  the same kind of good working pants, but for all that they'll have to be new
  made."</p>

  <p>Stanton laughed with some irritation</p>

  <p>"I hate arguing in parables, for in the nature of things they can't be
  exact. That's a mistake you westerners make. The law must change in detail
  with changing conditions, but its principles cannot alter, and the respect
  for these principles is our only safeguard against relapse into savagery.
  Take slavery. There are fools in the east who would abolish it by act of
  Congress. For myself I do not love the system, but I love anarchy and
  injustice less, and if you abolish slavery you abolish also every-right of
  legal property, and that means chaos and barbarism. A free people such as
  ours cannot thus put the knife to their throat. If we were the serfs of a
  monarchy, accustomed to bow before the bidding of a king, it might be
  different, but a republic cannot do injustice to one section of its citizens
  without destroying itself."</p>

  <p>Lincoln had not taken his eyes from the stove. He seemed to be seeing
  things in the fire, for he smiled to himself.</p>

  <p>"Well," he drawled, "I reckon that some day we may have to find some sort
  of a king. The new pants have got to be made."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stanton shrugged his shoulders, and the other, quick to detect
  annoyance, scrambled to his feet and stood looking down from his great height
  at his dapper antagonist. A kindly quizzical smile lit his homely face.
  "We'll quit arguing, Mr. Stanton, for I admit I'm afraid of you. You're some
  years younger than me, but I expect you would have me convinced on your side
  if we went on. And maybe I'd convince you too, and then we'd be like old Jim
  Fletcher at New Salem. You'll have heard about Jim. He had a mighty quarrel
  with his neighbour about a hog, Jim alleging it was one of his lot and the
  neighbour claiming it for his. Well, they argued and argued, and the upshot
  was that Jim convinced the neighbour that the hog was Jim's, and the
  neighbour convinced Jim that the hog was the neighbour's, and neither of them
  would touch that hog, and they were worse friends than ever."</p>

  <p>Mr. Curtin rose and apologised to his companion. He had to see a man about
  a buggy and must leave Mr. Stanton to find his way back alone.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry, George," said the long man. "I'm going round your way and
  I'll see your friend home." As Mr. Stanton professed himself ready for bed,
  the little party by the stove broke up. Lincoln fetched from a corner a
  dilapidated carpet-bag full of papers, and an old green umbrella,
  handle-less, tied with string about the middle, and having his name sewn
  inside in straggling letters cut out of white muslin. He and Stanton went
  out-of-doors into the raw autumn night.</p>

  <p>The town lay very quiet in a thin fog made luminous by a full moon. The
  long man walked with his feet turned a little inwards, accommodating his gait
  to the shorter stride of his companion. Mr. Stanton, having recovered from
  his momentary annoyance, was curious about this odd member of his own
  profession. Was it possible that in the whirligig of time a future could lie
  before one so uncouth and rustical? A democracy was an unaccountable thing,
  and these rude westerners might have to be reckoned with.</p>

  <p>"You are ambitious of a political career, Mr. Lincoln?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The other looked down with his shy crooked smile, and the Ohio lawyer
  suddenly realised that the man had his own attractiveness.</p>

  <p>"Why, no, sir. I shouldn't like to say I was ambitious. I've no call to
  be, for the Almighty hasn't blessed me with any special gifts. You're
  different. It would be a shame to you if you didn't look high, for you're a
  young man with all the world before you. I'm getting middle-aged and I
  haven't done anything to be proud of yet, and I reckon I won't get the
  chance, and if I did I couldn't take advantage of it. I'm pretty fond of the
  old country, and if she wants me, why, she's only got to say so and I'll do
  what she tells me. But I don't see any clear road I want to travel... "</p>

  <p>He broke off suddenly, and Stanton, looking up at him, saw that his face
  had changed utterly. The patient humorous look had gone and it was like a
  tragic mask, drawn and strained with suffering. They were passing by a little
  town cemetery and, as if by some instinct, had halted.</p>

  <p>The place looked strange and pitiful in the hazy moonlight. It was badly
  tended, and most of the headstones were only of painted wood, warped and
  buckled by the weather. But in the dimness the rows of crosses and slabs
  seemed to extend into the far distance, and the moon gave them a cold, eerie
  whiteness as if they lay in the light of another world. A great sign came
  from Lincoln, and Stanton thought that he had never seen on mortal
  countenance such infinite sadness.</p>

  <p>"Ambition!" he said. "How dare we talk of ambition, when this is the end
  of it? All these people&mdash;decent people, kind people, once full of joy
  and purpose, and now all forgotten! It is not the buried bodies I mind, it is
  the buried hearts...  I wonder if it means peace... "</p>

  <p>He stood there with head bowed and he seemed to be speaking to himself.
  Stanton caught a phrase or two and found it was verse&mdash;banal verses,
  which were there and then fixed in his fly-paper memory. "Tell me, my secret
  soul," it ran:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Oh, tell me, Hope and Faith,<br>
  Is there no resting-place<br>
  From sorrow, sin, and death?<br>
  Is there no happy spot<br>
  Where mortals may be blessed,<br>
  Where grief may find a balm<br>
  And weariness a rest?"</p>

  <p>The figure murmuring these lines seemed to be oblivious of his companion.
  He stood gazing under the moon, like a gaunt statue of melancholy. Stanton
  spoke to him but got no answer, and presently took his own road home. He had
  no taste for histrionic scenes. And as he went his way he meditated. Mad,
  beyond doubt. Not without power in him, but unbalanced, hysterical,
  alternating between buffoonery and these schoolgirl emotions. He reflected
  that if the American nation contained much stuff of this kind it might prove
  a difficult team to drive. He was thankful that he was going home next day to
  his orderly life.</p>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always">II</h3>

  <p>Eighteen years have gone, and the lanky figure of Speed's store is
  revealed in new surroundings. In a big square room two men sat beside a table
  littered with the debris of pens, foolscap, and torn fragments of paper which
  marked the end of a Council. It was an evening at the beginning of April, and
  a fire burned in the big grate. One of the two sat at the table with his
  elbows on the mahogany, and his head supported by a hand. He was a man well
  on in middle life with a fine clean-cut face and the shapely mobile lips of
  the publicist and orator. It was the face of one habituated to platforms and
  assemblies, full of a certain self-conscious authority. But to-night its
  possessor seemed ill at ease. His cheeks were flushed and his eye
  distracted.</p>

  <p>The other had drawn his chair to the fire, so that one side of him was lit
  by the late spring sun and one by the glow from the hearth. That figure we
  first saw in the Springfield store had altered little in the eighteen years.
  There was no grey in the coarse black hair, but the lines in the sallow face
  were deeper, and there were dark rings under the hollow. eyes. The old suit
  of blue jeans had gone; and he wore now a frock-coat, obviously new, which
  was a little too full for his gaunt frame. His tie, as of old, was like a
  boot-lace. A new silk hat, with the nap badly ruffled, stood near on the top
  of a cabinet.</p>

  <p>He smiled rather wearily. "We're pretty near through the appointments now,
  Mr. Secretary. It's a mean business, but I'm a minority President and I've
  got to move in zig-zags so long as I don't get off the pike. I reckon that
  honest statesmanship is just the employment of individual meannesses for the
  public good. Mr. Sumner wouldn't agree. He calls himself the slave of
  principles and says he owns no other master. Mr. Sumner's my notion of a
  bishop."</p>

  <p>The other did not seem to be listening. "Are you still set on re-enforcing
  Fort Sumter?" he asked, his bent brows making a straight line above his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>Lincoln nodded. He was searching in the inside pocket of his frock-coat,
  from which he extracted a bundle of papers. Seward saw what he was after, and
  his self-consciousness increased.</p>

  <p>"You have read my letter?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have," said Lincoln, fixing a pair of cheap spectacles on his nose. He
  had paid thirty-seven cents for them in Bloomington five years before. "A
  mighty fine letter. Full of horse sense."</p>

  <p>"You agree with it?" asked the other eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Why, no. I don't agree with it, but I admire it a lot and I admire its
  writer."</p>

  <p>"Mr. President," said Seward solemnly, "on one point I am adamant. We
  cannot suffer the dispute to be about slavery. If we fight on that issue we
  shall have the Border States against us."</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking all the time about the Border States. We've got to keep
  them. If there's going to be trouble I'd like to have the Almighty on my
  side, but I must have Kentucky."</p>

  <p>"And yet you will go forward about Sumter, which is regarded by everyone
  as a slavery issue."</p>

  <p>"The issue is as God has made it. You can't go past the bed-rock facts. I
  am the trustee for the whole property of the nation, of which Sumter is a
  piece, and if I give up one stick or stone to a rebellious demand I am an
  unfaithful steward. Surely, Mr. Secretary, if you want to make the issue
  union or disunion you can't give up Sumter without fatally prejudicing your
  case."</p>

  <p>"It means war."</p>

  <p>Lincoln looked again at the document in his hand. "It appears that you are
  thinking of war in any event. You want to pick a quarrel with France over
  Mexico and with Spain over St. Domingo, and unite the nation in a war against
  foreigners. I tell you honestly I don't like the proposal. It seems to me
  downright wicked.</p>

  <p>If the Lord sends us war, we have got to face it like men, but God forbid
  we should manufacture war, and use it as an escape from our domestic
  difficulties. You can't expect a blessing on that."</p>

  <p>The Secretary of State flushed. "Have you considered the alternative, Mr.
  President?" he cried. "It is civil war, war between brothers in blood. So
  soon as the South fires a shot against Sumter the sword is unsheathed. You
  cannot go back then."</p>

  <p>"I am fully aware of it. I haven't been sleeping much lately, and I've
  been casting up my accounts. It s a pretty weak balance sheet. I would like
  to tell you the main items, Mr. Secretary, so that you may see that I'm not
  walking this road blindfold."</p>

  <p>The other pushed back his chair from the table with a gesture of despair.
  But he listened. Lincoln had risen and stood in front of the fire, his
  shoulders leaning on the mantelpiece, and his head against the lower part of
  the picture of George Washington.</p>

  <p>"First," he said, "I'm a minority President, elected by a minority vote of
  the people of the United States. I wouldn't have got in if the Democrats
  hadn't been split. I haven't a majority in the Senate. Yet I've got to decide
  for the nation and make the nation follow me. Have I the people's confidence?
  I reckon I haven't&mdash;yet. I haven't even got the confidence of the
  Republican party."</p>

  <p>Seward made no answer. He clearly assented.</p>

  <p>"Next, I haven't got much in the way of talents. I reckon Jeff Davis a far
  abler man than me. My friends tell me I haven't the presence and dignity for
  a President. My shaving-glass tells me I'm a common-looking fellow." He
  stopped and smiled. "But perhaps the Lord prefers common-looking people, and
  that's why He made so many of them.</p>

  <p>"Next," he went on, "I've a heap of critics and a lot of enemies. Some
  good men say I've no experience in Government, and that's about true. Up in
  New England the papers are asking who is this political huckster, this county
  court advocate? Mr. Stanton says I'm an imbecile, and when he's cross calls
  me the original gorilla, and wonders why fools wander about in Africa when
  they could find the beast they are looking for in Washington. The pious
  everywhere don't like me, because I don't hold that national policy can be
  run on the lines of a church meeting. And the Radicals are looking for me
  with a gun, because I'm not prepared right here and now to abolish slavery.
  One of them calls me 'the slave hound of Illinois.' I'd like to meet that
  man, for I guess he must be a humorist."</p>

  <p>Mr. Seward leaned forward and spoke earnestly. "Mr. President, no man
  values your great qualities more than I do or reprobates more heartily such
  vulgar libels. But it is true that you lack executive experience. I have been
  the Governor of the biggest State in the Union, and possess some knowledge of
  the task. It is all at your service. Will you not allow me to ease your
  burden?"</p>

  <p>Lincoln smiled down kindly upon the other. "I thank you with all my heart.
  You have touched on that matter in your letter...  But, Mr. Secretary, in the
  inscrutable providence of God it is I who have been made President. I cannot
  shirk the duty. I look to my Cabinet, and notably to you for advice and loyal
  assistance, and I am confident that I shall get it. But in the end I and I
  only must decide."</p>

  <p>Seward looked up at the grave face and said nothing. Lincoln went on:</p>

  <p>"I have to make a decision which may bring war&mdash;civil war. I don't
  know anything about war, though I served a month or two in the Black Hawk
  campaign and yet, if war comes, I am the Commander-in-Chief of the Union. Who
  among us knows anything of the business. General Scott is an old man, and he
  doesn't just see eye to eye with me; for I'm told he talks about 'letting the
  wayward sisters go in peace.' Our army and navy's nothing much to boast of,
  and the South is far better prepared. You can't tell how our people will take
  war, for they're all pulling different ways just now. Blair says the whole
  North will spring to arms, but I guess they've first got to find the arms to
  spring to...  I was reviewing some militia the other day, and they looked a
  deal more like a Fourth of July procession than a battlefield. Yes, Mr.
  Secretary, if we have to fight, we've first got to make an army."</p>

  <p>Remember, too, that it will he civil war&mdash;kin against kin, brother
  against brother."</p>

  <p>"I remember. All war is devilish, but ours will be the most devilish that
  the world has ever known. It isn't only the feeding of fresh young boys to
  rebel batteries that grieves me, though God knows that's not a thing that
  bears thinking about. It's the bitterness and hate within the people. Will it
  ever die down, Mr. Secretary?"</p>

  <p>Lincoln was very grave, and his face was set like a man in anguish.
  Seward, deeply moved, rose and stood beside him, laying a hand on his
  shoulder</p>

  <p>"And for what, Mr. President?" he cried. "That is the question I ask
  myself. We are faced by such a problem as no man ever before had to meet. If
  five and a half million white men deeply in earnest are resolved to secede,
  is there any power on earth that can prevent them? You may beat them in
  battle, but can you ever force them again inside the confines of the nation?
  Remember Chatham's saying: 'Conquer a free population of three million
  souls&mdash;the thing is impossible.' They stand on the rights of democracy,
  the right of self-government, the right to decide their own future."</p>

  <p>Lincoln passed a hand over his brow. His face had suddenly became very
  worn and weary.</p>

  <p>"I've been pondering a deal over the position of the South," he said. "I
  reckon I see their point of view, and I'll not deny there's sense in it.
  There's a truth in their doctrine of State rights, but they've got it out of
  focus. If I had been raised in South Carolina, loving the slave-system
  because I had grown up with it and thinking more of my State than of the
  American nation, maybe I'd have followed Jeff Davis. I'm not saying there's
  no honesty in the South, I'm not saying there's not truth on their side, but
  I do say that ours is the bigger truth and the better truth. I hold that a
  nation is too sacred a thing to tamper with&mdash;even for good reasons. Why,
  man, if you once grant the right of a minority to secede you make popular
  government foolish. I'm willing to fight to prevent democracy becoming a
  laughing-stock."</p>

  <p>"It's a fine point to make war about," said the other.</p>

  <p>"Most true points are fine points. There never was a dispute between
  mortals where both sides hadn't a bit of right. I admit that the margin is
  narrow, but if it's made of good rock it's sufficient to give us a foothold.
  We've got to settle once for all the question whether in a free Government
  the minority have a right to break up the Government whenever they choose. If
  we fail, then we must conclude that we've been all wrong from the start, and
  that the people need a tyrant, being incapable of governing themselves."</p>

  <p>Seward wrung his hands. "If you put it that way I cannot confute you. But,
  oh, Mr. President, is there not some means of building a bridge? I cannot
  think that honest Southerners would force war on such a narrow issue.</p>

  <p>"They wouldn't but for this slavery. It is that accursed system that
  obscures their reason. If they fight, the best of them will fight out of a
  mistaken loyalty to their State, but most will fight for the right to keep
  their slaves...  If you are to have bridges, you must have solid ground at
  both ends. I've heard a tale of some church members that wanted to build a
  bridge over a dangerous river. Brother Jones suggested one Myers, and Myers
  answered that, if necessary, he could build one to hell. This alarmed the
  church members, and Jones, to quiet them, said he believed his friend Myers
  was so good an architect that he could do it if he said he could, though he
  felt bound himself to express some doubt about the abutment on the infernal
  side."</p>

  <p>A queer quizzical smile had relieved the gravity of the President's face.
  But Seward was in no mood for tales.</p>

  <p>"Is there no other way?" he moaned, and his suave voice sounded cracked
  and harsh.</p>

  <p>"There is no other way but to go forward. I've never been a man for
  cutting across lots when I could go round by the road, but if the roads are
  all shut we must take to open country. For it is altogether necessary to go
  forward."</p>

  <p>Seward seemed to pull himself together. He took a turn down the room and
  then faced Lincoln.</p>

  <p>"Mr. President," he said, "you do not know whether you have a majority
  behind you even in the North." You have no experience of government and none
  of war. The ablest men in your party are luke-warm or hostile towards you.
  You have no army to speak of, and will have to make everything from the
  beginning. You feel as I do about the horror of war, and above all the
  horrors of civil war. You do not know whether the people will support you.
  You grant that there is some justice in the contention of the South, and you
  claim for your own case only a balance of truth. You admit that to coerce the
  millions of the South back into the Union is a kind of task which has never
  been performed in the world before and one which the wise of all ages have
  pronounced impossible. And yet, for the sake of a narrow point, you are
  ready, if the need arises, to embark on a war which must be bloody and long,
  which must stir the deeps of bitterness, and which in all likelihood will
  achieve nothing. Are you entirely resolved?"</p>

  <p>Lincoln's sad eyes rested on the other. "I am entirely resolved. I have
  been set here to decide for the people according to the best of my talents,
  and the Almighty has shown me no other road."</p>

  <p>Seward held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Then, by God, you must be right. You are the bravest man in this land,
  sir, and I will follow you to the other side of perdition."</p>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always">III</h3>

  <p>The time is two years later&mdash;a warm evening in early May. There had
  been no rain for a week in Washington, and the President, who had ridden in
  from his summer quarters in the Soldiers' Home, had his trousers grey with
  dust from the knees down. He had come round to the War Department, from which
  in these days he was never long absent, and found the Secretary for War busy
  as usual at his high desk. There had been the shortest of greetings, and,
  while Lincoln turned over the last telegrams, Stanton wrote steadily.</p>

  <p>Stanton had changed much since the night in the Springfield store. A
  square beard, streaked with grey, covered his chin, and his face had grown
  heavier. There were big pouches below the short-sighted eyes, and deep lines
  on each side of his short shaven upper lip. His skin had an unhealthy
  pallour, like that of one who works late and has little fresh air. The mouth,
  always obstinate, was now moulded into a settled grimness. The ploughs of war
  had made deep furrows on his soul.</p>

  <p>Lincoln, too, had altered. He had got a stoop in his shoulders as if his
  back carried a burden. A beard had been suffered to grow in a ragged fringe
  about his jaw and cheeks, and there were silver threads in it. His whole face
  seemed to have been pinched and hammered together, so that it looked like a
  mask of pale bronze&mdash;a death mask, for it was hard to believe that blood
  ran below that dry tegument. But the chief change was in his eyes. They had
  lost the alertness they once possessed, and had become pits of brooding
  shade, infinitely kind, infinitely patient, infinitely melancholy.</p>

  <p>Yet there was a sort of weary peace in the face, and there was still
  humour in the puckered mouth and even in the sad eyes. He looked less
  harassed than the Secretary for War. He drew a small book from his pocket, at
  which the other glanced malevolently.</p>

  <p>I give you fair warning, Mr. President," said Stanton. "If you've come
  here to read me the work of one of your tom-fool funny men, I'll fling it out
  of the window.</p>

  <p>"This work is the Bible," said Lincoln, with the artlessness of a
  mischievous child. I looked in to ask how the draft was progressing."</p>

  <p>"It starts in Rhode Island on July 7, and till it starts I can say
  nothing. We've had warning that there will be fierce opposition in New York.
  It may mean that we have a second civil war on our hands. And of one thing I
  am certain&mdash;it will cost you your re-election."</p>

  <p>The President did not seem perturbed. "In this war we've got to take one
  step at a time," he said. "Our job is to save the country, and to do that
  we've got to win battles. But you can't win battles without armies, and if
  men won't enlist of their own will they've got to be compelled. What use is a
  second term to me if I have no country...  You're not weakening on the policy
  of the draft, Mr. Stanton?"</p>

  <p>The War Minister shrugged his shoulders. "No. In March it seemed
  inevitable. I still think it is essential, but I am forced to admit the
  possibility that it may be a rank failure. It is the boldest step you have
  taken, Mr. President. Have you ever regretted it?"</p>

  <p>Lincoln shook his head. "It don't do to start regretting. This war is
  managed by the Almighty, and if it's his purpose that we should win He will
  show us how. I regard our fallible reasoning and desperate conclusions as
  part of His way of achieving His purpose. But about that draft. I'll answer
  you in the words of a young Quaker woman who against the rules had married a
  military man. The elders asked her if she was sorry, and she replied that she
  couldn't truly say that she was sorry, but that she could say she wouldn't do
  it again. I was for the draft, and I was for the war, to prevent democracy
  making itself foolish."</p>

  <p>"You'll never succeed in that," said Stanton gravely.</p>

  <p>"If Congress is democracy, there can't be a more foolish gathering outside
  a monkey-house."</p>

  <p>The President grinned broadly. He was humming the air of a nigger song,
  "The Blue-tailed Fly," which Lamon had taught him.</p>

  <p>"That reminds me of Artemus Ward. He observes that at the last election he
  voted for Henry Clay. It's true, he says, that Henry was dead, but Since all
  the politicians that he knew were fifteenth-rate he preferred to vote for a
  first-class corpse."</p>

  <p>Stanton moved impatiently. He hated the President's pocket humorists and
  had small patience with his tales. "Was ever a great war fought," he cried,
  with such a camp-following as our Congressmen?"</p>

  <p>Lincoln looked comically surprised.</p>

  <p>"You're too harsh, Mr. Stanton. I admit there are one or two rascals who'd
  be better hanged. But the trouble is that most of them are too
  high-principled. They are that set on liberty that they won't take the
  trouble to safeguard it. They would rather lose the war than give up their
  little notions. I've a great regard for principles, but I have no use for
  them when they get so high that they become foolishness."</p>

  <p>"Every idle pedant thinks he knows better how to fight a war than the men
  who are labouring sixteen hours a day at it," said Stanton bitterly.</p>

  <p>They want to hurry things quicker than the Almighty means them to go. I
  don't altogether blame them either, for I'm mortally impatient myself. But
  it's no good thinking that saying a thing should be so will make it so. We're
  not the Creator of this universe. You've got to judge results according to
  your instruments. Horace Greeley is always telling me what I should do, but
  Horace omits to explain how I am to find the means. You can't properly manure
  a fifty-acre patch with only a bad smell."</p>

  <p>Lincoln ran his finger over the leaves of the small Bible he had taken
  from his pocket "Seems to me Moses had the same difficulties to contend with.
  Read the sixteenth chapter of the book of Numbers at your leisure, Mr.
  Secretary. It's mighty pertinent to our situation. The people have been a
  deal kinder to me than I deserve and I've got more cause for thankfulness
  than complaint. But sometimes I get just a little out of patience with our
  critics. I want to say to them as Moses said to Korah, Dathan, and
  Abiram&mdash;'Ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi!'"</p>

  <p>Lincoln's speech had broadened into something like the dialect of his
  boyhood. Stanton finished the paper on which he had been engaged and stepped
  aside from his desk. His face was heavily preoccupied and he kept an eye
  always on the door leading to his private secretary's room.</p>

  <p>"At this moment," he said, "Hooker is engaged with Lee." He put a finger
  on a map which was stretched on a frame behind him. "There! On the
  Rappahannock, where it is joined by the Rapidan...  Near the hamlet of
  Chancellorsville...  Battle was joined two days ago, and so far it has been
  indecisive. Tonight we should know the result. That was the news you came
  here to-night about, Mr. President?"</p>

  <p>Lincoln nodded. "I am desperately anxious. I needn't conceal that from
  you, Mr. Stanton."</p>

  <p>"So am I. I wish to God I had more confidence in General Hooker. I never
  liked that appointment, Mr. President. I should have preferred Meade or
  Reynolds. Hooker is a blustering thick-headed fellow, good enough, maybe, for
  a division or even a corps, but not for an army."</p>

  <p>"I visited him three weeks back," said Lincoln, "and I'm bound to say he
  has marvellously pulled round the Army of the Potomac. There's a new spirit
  in their ranks. You're unjust to Joe Hooker, Mr. Stanton. He's a fine
  organiser, and he'll fight&mdash;he's eager to fight, which McClellan and
  Burnside never were."</p>

  <p>"But what on earth is the good of being willing to fight if you're going
  to lose? He hasn't the brains to command. And he's opposed by Lee and
  Jackson. Do you realise the surpassing ability of those two men? We have no
  generals fit to hold a candle to them."</p>

  <p>"We've a bigger and a better army. I'm not going to be depressed, Mr.
  Stanton. Joe has two men to every one of Lee's, he's safe over the
  Rappahannock, and I reckon he will make a road to Richmond. I've seen his
  troops, and they are fairly bursting to get at the enemy. I insist on being
  hopeful. What's the last news from the Mississippi?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing new. Grant has got to Port Gibson and has his base at Grand Gulf.
  He now proposes to cut loose and make for Vicksburg. So far he has done well,
  but the risk is terrific. Still, I am inclined to think you were right about
  that man. He has capacity."</p>

  <p>"Grant stops still and saws wood," said Lincoln "He don't talk a great
  deal, but he fights. I can't help feeling hopeful to-night, for it seems to
  me we have the enemy in a fix. You've heard me talk of the shrinking
  quadrilateral, which is the rebel States, as I see the proposition."</p>

  <p>"Often," said the other drily.</p>

  <p>"I never could get McClellan rightly to understand it. I look on the
  Confederacy as a quadrilateral of which at present we hold two
  sides&mdash;the east and the south&mdash;the salt-water sides. The north side
  is Virginia, the west side the line of the Mississippi. If Grant and Farragut
  between them can win the control of the Father of Waters, we've got the west
  side. Then it's the business of the Armies on the Mississippi to press east
  and the Army of the Potomac to press south. It may take a time, but if we
  keep a stiff upper lip we're bound to have the rebels whipped. I reckon
  they're whipped already in spite of Lee. I've heard of a turtle that an old
  nigger man decapitated. Next day he was amusing himself poking sticks at it
  and the turtle was snapping back. His master comes along and says to him,
  'Why, Pomp, I thought that turtle was dead.' 'Well, he am dead, massa,' says
  Pompey, 'but the critter don't know enough ter be sensible of it.' I reckon
  the Confederacy's dead, but Jeff Davis don't know enough to be sensible of
  it."</p>

  <p>A young man in uniform came hurriedly through the private secretary's door
  and handed the Secretary for War a telegram. He stood at attention, and the
  President observed that his face was pale. Stanton read the message, but gave
  no sign of its contents. He turned to the map behind him and traced a line on
  it with his forefinger.</p>

  <p>"Any more news?" he asked the messenger.</p>

  <p>"Nothing official, sir," was the answer. "But there is a report that
  General Jackson has been killed in the moment of victory."</p>

  <p>The officer withdrew and Stanton turned to the President. Lincoln's face
  was terrible in its strain, for the words "in the moment of victory" had rung
  the knell of his hopes.</p>

  <p>When Stanton spoke his voice was controlled and level. "Unlike your
  turtle," he said, "the Confederacy is suddenly and terribly alive. Lee has
  whipped Hooker to blazes. We have lost more than fifteen thousand men. To-day
  we are back on the north side of the Rappahannock."</p>

  <p>Lincoln was on his feet and for a moment the bronze mask of his face was
  distorted by suffering.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he cried. "What will the country say? What will the country
  say?"</p>

  <p>"It matters little what the country says. The point is what will the
  country suffer. In a fortnight Lee will be in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Your
  quadrilateral will not shrink, it will extend. In a month we shall be
  fighting to hold Washington and Baltimore, aye, and Philadelphia."</p>

  <p>The bitterness of the words seemed to calm Lincoln. He was walking up and
  down the floor, with his hands clasped behind his back, and his expression
  was once again one of patient humility</p>

  <p>"I take all the blame," he said. "You have done nobly, Mr. Stanton, and
  all the mistakes are mine. I reckon I am about the poorest effigy of a War
  President that ever cursed an unhappy country."</p>

  <p>The other did not reply. He was an honest man who did not deal in smooth
  phrases.</p>

  <p>"I'd resign to-morrow," Lincoln went on. "No rail-splitter ever laid down
  his axe at the end of a hard day so gladly as I would lay down my office. But
  I've got to be sure first that my successor will keep faith with this nation.
  I've got to find a man who will keep the right course."</p>

  <p>"Which is?" Stanton asked.</p>

  <p>"To fight it out to the very end. To the last drop of blood and the last
  cent. There can be no going back. If I surrendered my post to any successor,
  though he were an archangel from heaven, who would weaken on that great
  purpose, I should deserve to be execrated as the betrayer of my country."</p>

  <p>Into Stanton's sour face there came a sudden gleam which made it almost
  beautiful.</p>

  <p>"Mr. President," he said, "I have often differed from you. I have used
  great freedom in criticism of your acts, and I take leave to think that I
  have been generally in the right. You know that I am no flatterer. But I tell
  you, sir, from my inmost heart that you are the only man to lead the people,
  because you are the only man whose courage never fails. God knows how you
  manage it. I am of the bull-dog type and hold on because I do not know how to
  let go. Most of my work I do in utter hopelessness. But you, sir, you never
  come within a mile of despair. The blacker the clouds get the more confident
  you are that there is sunlight behind them. I carp and cavil at you, but I
  also take off my hat to you, for you are by far the greatest of us."</p>

  <p>Lincoln's face broke into a slow smile, which made the eyes seem curiously
  child-like.</p>

  <p>"I thank you, my old friend," he said. "I don't admit I have your courage,
  for I haven't half of it. But if a man feels that he is only a pipe for
  Omnipotence to sound through, he is not so apt to worry. Besides, these last
  weeks God has been very good to me and I've been given a kind of assurance. I
  know the country will grumble a bit about my ways of doing things, but will
  follow me in the end. I know that we shall win a clean victory. Jordan has
  been a hard road to travel, but I feel that in spite of all our frailties
  we'll be dumped on the right side of that stream. After that... "</p>

  <p>"After that," said Stanton, with something like enthusiasm in his voice,
  "you'll be the first President of a truly united America, with a power and
  prestige the greatest since Washington."</p>

  <p>Lincoln's gaze had left the other's face and was fixed on the blue dusk
  now gathering in the window.</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that," he said. "When the war's over, I think I'll go
  home."</p>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always">IV</h3>

  <p>Two years passed and once again it was spring in Washington&mdash;about
  half-past ten of the evening of the 14th of April&mdash;Good Friday&mdash;the
  first Eastertide of peace. The streets had been illuminated for victory, and
  the gas jets were still blazing, while a young moon, climbing the sky, was
  dimming their murky yellow with its cold pure light. Tenth Street was packed
  from end to end by a silent mob. As a sponge cleans a slate, so exhilaration
  had been wiped off their souls. On the porch of Ford's Theatre some gaudy
  posters advertised Tom Taylor's comedy, Our American Cousin, and the steps
  were littered with paper and orange peel and torn fragments of women's
  clothes, for the exit of the audience had been hasty. Lights still blazed in
  the building, for there was nobody to put them out. In front on the side-walk
  was a cordon of soldiers.</p>

  <p>Stanton elbowed his way through the throng to the little house, Mr.
  Peterson's, across the street. The messenger from the War Department had
  poured wild news into his ear,&mdash; wholesale murder, everybody&mdash;the
  President&mdash;Seward&mdash;Grant. Incredulous he had hurried forth and the
  sight of that huge still crowd woke fear in him. The guards at Mr. Peterson's
  door recognised him and he was admitted. As he crossed the threshold he saw
  ominous dark stains.</p>

  <p>A kitchen candle burned below the hat-rack in the narrow hall, and showed
  further stains on the oilcloth. From a room on the left hand came the sound
  of women weeping.</p>

  <p>The door at the end of the passage was ajar. It opened on a bare little
  place, once perhaps the surgery of some doctor in small practice, but now a
  bedroom. A door gave at the farther side on a tiny veranda, and this and the
  one window were wide open. An oil lamp stood on a table by the bed and
  revealed a crowd of people. A man lay on the camp-bed, lying aslant for he
  was too long for it. A sheet covered his lower limbs, but his breast and
  shoulders had been bared. The head was nearest to the entrance, propped on an
  outjutting bolster.</p>

  <p>A man was leaving whom Stanton recognised as Dr. Stone, the Lincoln family
  physician. The doctor answered his unspoken question. "Dying," he said.
  "Through the brain. The bullet is now below the left eye. He may live for a
  few hours&mdash;scarcely the night."</p>

  <p>Stanton moved to the foot of the bed like one in a dream. He saw that
  Barnes, the Surgeon-General, sat on a deal chair on the left side, holding
  the dying man's hand. Dr. Gurley, the minister, sat beside the bed. He noted
  Sumner and Welles and General Halleck and Governor Dennison, and back in the
  gloom the young Robert Lincoln. But he observed them only as he would have
  observed figures in a picture. They were but shadows; the living man was he
  who was struggling on the bed with death.</p>

  <p>Lincoln's great arms and chest were naked, and Stanton, who had thought of
  him as meagre and shrunken, was amazed at their sinewy strength. He
  remembered that he had once heard of him as a village Hercules. The President
  was unconscious, but some tortured nerve made him moan like an animal in
  pain. It was a strange sound to hear from one who had been wont to suffer
  with tight lips. To Stanton it heightened the spectral unreality of the
  scene. He seemed to be looking at a death in a stage tragedy.</p>

  <p>The trivial voice of Welles broke the silence. He had to give voice to the
  emotion which choked him.</p>

  <p>"His dream has come true," he said&mdash;"the dream he told us about at
  the Cabinet this morning. His ship is nearing the dark shore. He thought it
  signified good news from Sherman."</p>

  <p>Stanton did not reply. To save his life he could not have uttered a
  word.</p>

  <p>Then Gurley, the minister, spoke, very gently, for he was a simple man
  sorely moved.</p>

  <p>"He has looked so tired for so long. He will have rest now, the deep rest
  of the people of God...  He has died for us all...  To-day nineteen hundred
  years ago the Son of Man gave His life for the world...  The President has
  followed in his Master's steps."</p>

  <p>Sumner was repeating softly to himself, like a litany, that sentence from
  the second Inaugural&mdash;"With malice toward none, with charity for
  all."</p>

  <p>But Stanton was in no mood for words. He was looking at the figure on the
  bed, the great chest heaving with the laboured but regular breath, and living
  again the years of colleagueship and conflict. He had been Loyal to him: yes,
  thank God he had been loyal. He had quarrelled, thwarted, criticised, but he
  had never failed him in a crisis. He had held up his hands as Aaron and Hur
  held up the hands of Moses... </p>

  <p>The Secretary for War was not in the habit of underrating his own talents
  and achievements. But in that moment they seemed less than nothing. Humility
  shook him like a passion. Till his dying day his one boast must be that he
  had served that figure on the camp-bed. It had been his high fortune to have
  his lot cast in the vicinity of supreme genius. With awe he realised that he
  was looking upon the passing of the very great...  There had never been such
  a man. There could never be such an one again. So patient and enduring, so
  wise in all great matters, so potent to inspire a multitude, so secure in his
  own soul...  Fools would chatter about his being a son of the people and his
  career a triumph of the average man. Average! Great God, he was a ruler of
  princes, a master, a compeller of men...  He could imagine what noble
  nonsense Sumner would talk...  He looked with disfavour at the classic face
  of the Bostonian.</p>

  <p>But Sumner for once seemed to share his feelings. He, too, was looking
  with reverent eyes towards the bed, and as he caught Stanton's gaze he
  whispered words which the Secretary for War did not condemn: "The beauty of
  Israel is slain upon thy high places."</p>

  <p>The night hours crawled on with an intolerable slowness. Some of the
  watchers sat, but Stanton remained rigid at the bed-foot. He had not been
  well of late and had been ordered a long rest by his doctor, but he was not
  conscious of fatigue. He would not have left his post for a king's ransom,
  for he felt himself communing with the dying, sharing the last stage in his
  journey as he had shared all the rough marches. His proud spirit found a
  certain solace in the abasement of its humbleness.</p>

  <p>A little before six the morning light began to pale the lamps. The window
  showed a square of grey cloudy sky, and outside on the porch there was a drip
  of rain. The faces revealed by the cold dawn were as haggard and yellow as
  that of the dying man. Wafts of the outer air began to freshen the stuffiness
  of the little room.</p>

  <p>The city was waking up. There came the sound of far-away carts and horses,
  and a boy in the lane behind the house began to whistle, and then to sing.
  "When I was young," he sang&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"When I was young I used to wait<br>
  At Magea 'n table 'n' hand de plate<br>
  An' pais de bottle when he was dry,<br>
  An' brush away de blue-tailed fly."</p>

  <p>"It's his song," Stanton said to himself, and with the air came a rush of
  strange feelings. He remembered a thousand things, which before had been only
  a background of which he had been scarcely conscious. The constant
  kindliness, the gentle healing sympathy, the homely humour which he once
  thought had irritated but which he now knew had soothed him...  This man had
  been twined round the roots of every heart. All night he had been in an
  ecstasy of admiration, but now that was forgotten in a yearning love. The
  President had been part of his being, closer to him than wife or child. The
  boy sang&mdash;</p>

  <p class="poem">"But I can't forget, until I die<br>
  Ole Massa an' de blue-tailed fly."</p>

  <p>Stanton's eyes filled with hot tears. He had not wept since his daughter
  died.</p>

  <p>The breathing from the bed was growing faint. Suddenly the Surgeon-General
  held up his hand. He felt the heart and shook his head. "Fetch your mother,"
  he said to Robert Lincoln. The minister had dropped on his knees by the
  bedside and was praying.</p>

  <p>"The President is dead," said the Surgeon-General, and at the words it
  seemed that every head in the room was bowed on the breast.</p>

  <p>Stanton took a step forward with a strange appealing motion of the arms.
  It was noted by more than one that his pale face was transfigured.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday he was America's," he cried. "Our very own. Now he is all the
  world's...  Now he belongs to the ages."</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref16"
     id="ref16"></a>EPILOGUE</h3>

  <p>Mr. Francis Hamilton, an honorary attach&eacute; of the British Embassy,
  stood on the steps of the Capitol watching the procession which bore the
  President's body from the White House to lie in state in the great Rotunda.
  He was a young man of some thirty summers, who after a distinguished Oxford
  career was preparing himself with a certain solemnity for the House of
  Commons. He sought to be an authority on Foreign affairs, and with this aim
  was making a tour among the legations. Two years before he had come to
  Washington, intending to remain for six months, and somewhat to his own
  surprise had stayed on, declining to follow his kinsman Lord Lyons to
  Constantinople. Himself a staunch follower of Mr. Disraeli, and an abhorrer
  of Whiggery in all its forms, he yet found in America's struggle that which
  appealed both to his brain and his heart. He was a believer, he told himself,
  in the Great State and an opponent of parochialism; so, unlike most of his
  friends at home, his sympathies were engaged for the Union. Moreover he
  seemed to detect in the protagonists a Roman simplicity pleasing to a good
  classic.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hamilton was sombrely but fashionably dressed and wore a gold eyeglass
  on a black ribbon, because he fancied that a monocle adroitly used was a
  formidable weapon in debate. He had neat small side-whiskers, and a pleasant
  observant eye. With him were young Major Endicott from Boston and the eminent
  Mr. Russell Lowell, who, as Longfellow's successor in the Smith Professorship
  and one of the editors of The North American Review, was a great figure in
  cultivated circles. Both were acquaintances made by Mr. Hamilton on a recent
  visit to Harvard. He found it agreeable to have a few friends with whom he
  could have scholarly talk.</p>

  <p>The three watched the procession winding through the mourning streets.
  Every house was draped in funeral black, the passing bell tolled from every
  church, and the minute-guns boomed at the City Hall and on Capitol Hill. Mr.
  Hamilton regarded the cort&egrave;ge at first with a critical eye. The events
  of the past week had wrought in him a great expectation, which he feared
  would be disappointed. It needed a long tradition to do fitting honour to the
  man who had gone. Had America such a tradition? he asked himself...  The
  coloured troops marching at the head of the line pleased him. That was a
  happy thought. He liked, too, the business-like cavalry and infantry, and the
  battered field-pieces...  He saw his Chief among the foreign Ministers,
  bearing a face of portentous solemnity...  But he liked best the Illinois and
  Kentucky delegates; he thought the dead President would have liked them
  too.</p>

  <p>Major Endicott was pointing out the chief figures. There's Grant...  and
  Stanton, looking more cantankerous than ever. They say he's broken-hearted."
  But Mr. Hamilton had no eye for celebrities. He was thinking rather of those
  plain mourners from the west, and of the poorest house in Washington decked
  with black. This is a true national sorrow, he thought. He had been brought
  up as a boy from Eton to see Wellington's funeral, and the sight had not
  impressed him like this. For the recent months had awakened odd emotions in
  his orderly and somewhat cynical soul. He had discovered a hero.</p>

  <p>The three bared their heads as the long line filed by. Mr. Lowell said
  nothing. Now and then he pulled at his moustaches as if to hide some emotion
  which clamoured for expression. The mourners passed into the Capitol, while
  the bells still tolled and the guns boomed. The cavalry escort formed up on
  guard; from below came the sound of sharp commands.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hamilton was shaken out of the admirable detachment which he had
  cultivated. He wanted to sit down and sob like a child. Some brightness had
  died in the air, some great thing had gone for ever from the world and left
  it empty. He found himself regarding the brilliant career which he had
  planned for himself with a sudden disfavour. It was only second-rate after
  all, that glittering old world of courts and legislatures and embassies. For
  a moment he had had a glimpse of the first-rate, and it had shivered his
  pretty palaces. He wanted now something which he did not think he would find
  again.</p>

  <p>The three turned to leave, and at last Mr. Lowell spoke.</p>

  <p>"There goes," he said, "the first American!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Hamilton heard the words as he was brushing delicately with his sleeve
  a slight berufflement of his silk hat.</p>

  <p>"I dare say you are right, Professor," he said. "But I think it is also
  the last of the Kings."</p><br>
