  <h3>TO W. P. KER</h3>

  <p class="dedication">If the Professor of Poetry in the University of Oxford
  has not forgotten the rock whence he was hewn, this simple story may give an
  hour of entertainment. I offer it to you because I think you have met my
  friend Dickson McCunn, and I dare to hope that you may even in your many
  sojournings in the Westlands have encountered one or other of the Gorbals
  Die-Hards. If you share my kindly feeling for Dickson, you will be interested
  in some facts which I have lately ascertained about his ancestry. In his
  veins there flows a portion of the redoubtable blood of the Nicol Jarvies.
  When the Bailie, you remember, returned from his journey to Rob Roy beyond
  the Highland Line, he espoused his housekeeper Mattie, "an honest man's
  daughter and a near cousin o' the Laird o' Limmerfield." The union was
  blessed with a son, who succeeded to the Bailie's business and in due course
  begat daughters, one of whom married a certain Ebenezer McCunn, of whom there
  is record in the archives of the Hammermen of Glasgow. Ebenezer's grandson,
  Peter by name, was Provost of Kirkintilloch, and his second son was the
  father of my hero by his marriage with Robina Dickson, oldest daughter of one
  Robert Dickson, a tenant-farmer in the Lennox. So there are coloured threads
  in Mr. McCunn's pedigree, and, like the Bailie, he can count kin, should he
  wish, with Rob Roy himself through "the auld wife ayont the fire at
  Stuckavrallachan."</p>

  <p class="dedication">Such as it is, I dedicate to you the story, and ask for
  no better verdict on it than that of that profound critic of life and
  literature, Mr. Huckleberry Finn, who observed of the <i>Pilgrim's
  Progress</i> that he "considered the statements interesting, but tough."

     id="ref2">PROLOGUE</a></h2>

  <p>The girl came into the room with a darting movement like a swallow, looked
  round her with the same birdlike quickness, and then ran across the polished
  floor to where a young man sat on a sofa with one leg laid along it.</p>

  <p>"I have saved you this dance, Quentin," she said, pronouncing the name
  with a pretty staccato. "You must be lonely not dancing, so I will sit with
  you. What shall we talk about?"</p>

  <p>The young man did not answer at once, for his gaze was held by her face.
  He had never dreamed that the gawky and rather plain little girl whom he had
  romped with long ago in Paris would grow into such a being. The clean
  delicate lines of her figure, the exquisite pure colouring of hair and skin,
  the charming young arrogance of the eyes&mdash;this was beauty, he reflected,
  a miracle, a revelation. Her virginal fineness and her dress, which was the
  tint of pale fire, gave her the air of a creature of ice and flame.</p>

  <p>"About yourself, please, Saskia," he said. "Are you happy now that you are
  a grown-up lady?"</p>

  <p>"Happy!" Her voice had a thrill in it like music, frosty music. "The days
  are far too short. I grudge the hours when I must sleep. They say it is sad
  for me to make my debut in a time of war. But the world is very kind to me,
  and after all it is a victorious war for our Russia. And listen to me,
  Quentin. Tomorrow I am to be allowed to begin nursing at the Alexander
  Hospital. What do you think of that?"</p>

  <p>The time was January 1916, and the place a room in the great Nirski
  Palace. No hint of war, no breath from the snowy streets, entered that
  curious chamber where Prince Peter Nirski kept some of the chief of his
  famous treasures. It was notable for its lack of drapery and
  upholstering&mdash;only a sofa or two and a few fine rugs on the cedar floor.
  The walls were of a green marble veined like malachite, the ceiling was of
  darker marble inlaid with white intaglios. Scattered everywhere were tables
  and cabinets laden with celadon china, and carved jade, and ivories, and
  shimmering Persian and Rhodian vessels. In all the room there was scarcely
  anything of metal and no touch of gilding or bright colour. The light came
  from green alabaster censers, and the place swam in a cold green radiance
  like some cavern below the sea. The air was warm and scented, and though it
  was very quiet there, a hum of voices and the strains of dance music drifted
  to it from the pillared corridor in which could be seen the glare of lights
  from the great ballroom beyond.</p>

  <p>The young man had a thin face with lines of suffering round the mouth and
  eyes. The warm room had given him a high colour, which increased his air of
  fragility. He felt a little choked by the place, which seemed to him for both
  body and mind a hot-house, though he knew very well that the Nirski Palace on
  this gala evening was in no way typical of the land or its masters. Only a
  week ago he had been eating black bread with its owner in a hut on the
  Volhynian front.</p>

  <p>"You have become amazing, Saskia," he said. "I won't pay my old playfellow
  compliments; besides, you must be tired of them. I wish you happiness all the
  day long like a fairy-tale Princess. But a crock like me can't do much to
  help you to it. The service seems to be the wrong way round, for here you are
  wasting your time talking to me."</p>

  <p>She put her hand on his. "Poor Quentin! Is the leg very bad?"</p>

  <p>He laughed. "O, no. It's mending famously. I'll be able to get about
  without a stick in another month, and then you've got to teach me all the new
  dances."</p>

  <p>The jigging music of a two-step floated down the corridor. It made the
  young man's brow contract, for it brought to him a vision of dead faces in
  the gloom of a November dusk. He had once had a friend who used to whistle
  that air, and he had seen him die in the Hollebeke mud. There was something
  macabre in the tune...  He was surely morbid this evening, for there seemed
  something macabre about the house, the room, the dancing, all Russia...
  These last days he had suffered from a sense of calamity impending, of a dark
  curtain drawing down upon a splendid world. They didn't agree with him at the
  Embassy, but he could not get rid of the notion.</p>

  <p>The girl saw his sudden abstraction.</p>

  <p>"What are you thinking about?" she asked. It had been her favourite
  question as a child.</p>

  <p>"I was thinking that I rather wished you were still in Paris."</p>

  <p>"But why?"</p>

  <p>"Because I think you would be safer."</p>

  <p>"Oh, what nonsense, Quentin dear! Where should I be safe if not in my own
  Russia, where I have friends&mdash;oh, so many, and tribes and tribes of
  relations? It is France and England that are unsafe with the German guns
  grumbling at their doors...  My complaint is that my life is too cosseted and
  padded. I am too secure, and I do not want to be secure."</p>

  <p>The young man lifted a heavy casket from a table at his elbow. It was of
  dark green imperial jade, with a wonderfully carved lid. He took off the lid
  and picked up three small oddments of ivory&mdash;a priest with a beard, a
  tiny soldier, and a draught-ox. Putting the three in a triangle, he balanced
  the jade box on them.</p>

  <p>"Look, Saskia! If you were living inside that box you would think it very
  secure. You would note the thickness of the walls and the hardness of the
  stone, and you would dream away in a peaceful green dusk. But all the time it
  would be held up by trifles&mdash;brittle trifles."</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "You do not understand. You cannot understand. We are
  a very old and strong people with roots deep, deep in the earth."</p>

  <p>"Please God you are right," he said. "But, Saskia, you know that if I can
  ever serve you, you have only to command me. Now I can do no more for you
  than the mouse for the lion&mdash;at the beginning of the story. But the
  story had an end, you remember, and some day it may be in my power to help
  you. Promise to send for me."</p>

  <p>The girl laughed merrily. "The King of Spain's daughter," she quoted,</p>

  <p>"Came to visit me, And all for the love Of my little nut-tree."</p>

  <p>The other laughed also, as a young man in the uniform of the Preobrajenski
  Guards approached to claim the girl. "Even a nut-tree may be a shelter in a
  storm," he said.</p>

  <p>"Of course I promise, Quentin," she said. "Au revoir. Soon I will come and
  take you to supper, and we will talk of nothing but nut-trees."</p>

  <p>He watched the two leave the room, her gown glowing like a tongue of fire
  in that shadowy archway. Then he slowly rose to his feet, for he thought that
  for a little he would watch the dancing. Something moved beside him, and he
  turned in time to prevent the jade casket from crashing to the floor. Two of
  the supports had slipped.</p>

  <p>He replaced the thing on its proper table and stood silent for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"The priest and the soldier gone, and only the beast of burden left. If I
  were inclined to be superstitious, I should call that a dashed bad
  omen."</p><br>

     id="ref3">CHAPTER 1</a></h3>

  <h2>HOW A RETIRED PROVISION MERCHANT<br>
  FELT THE IMPULSE OF SPRING</h2>

  <p>Mr. Dickson McCunn completed the polishing of his smooth cheeks with the
  towel, glanced appreciatively at their reflection in the looking-glass, and
  then permitted his eyes to stray out of the window. In the little garden
  lilacs were budding, and there was a gold line of daffodils beside the tiny
  greenhouse. Beyond the sooty wall a birch flaunted its new tassels, and the
  jackdaws were circling about the steeple of the Guthrie Memorial Kirk. A
  blackbird whistled from a thorn-bush, and Mr. McCunn was inspired to follow
  its example. He began a tolerable version of "Roy's Wife of Aldivalloch."</p>

  <p>He felt singularly light-hearted, and the immediate cause was his safety
  razor. A week ago he had bought the thing in a sudden fit of enterprise, and
  now he shaved in five minutes, where before he had taken twenty, and no
  longer confronted his fellows, at least one day in three, with a countenance
  ludicrously mottled by sticking-plaster. Calculation revealed to him the fact
  that in his fifty-five years, having begun to shave at eighteen, he had
  wasted three thousand three hundred and seventy hours&mdash;or one hundred
  and forty days&mdash;or between four and five months&mdash;by his neglect of
  this admirable invention. Now he felt that he had stolen a march on Time. He
  had fallen heir, thus late, to a fortune in unpurchasable leisure.</p>

  <p>He began to dress himself in the sombre clothes in which he had been
  accustomed for thirty-five years and more to go down to the shop in Mearns
  Street. And then a thought came to him which made him discard the
  grey-striped trousers, sit down on the edge of his bed, and muse.</p>

  <p>Since Saturday the shop was a thing of the past. On Saturday at half-past
  eleven, to the accompaniment of a glass of dubious sherry, he had completed
  the arrangements by which the provision shop in Mearns Street, which had
  borne so long the legend of D. McCunn, together with the branches in
  Crossmyloof and the Shaws, became the property of a company, yclept the
  United Supply Stores, Limited. He had received in payment cash, debentures
  and preference shares, and his lawyers and his own acumen had acclaimed the
  bargain. But all the week-end he had been a little sad. It was the end of so
  old a song, and he knew no other tune to sing. He was comfortably off,
  healthy, free from any particular cares in life, but free too from any
  particular duties. "Will I be going to turn into a useless old man?" he asked
  himself.</p>

  <p>But he had woke up this Monday to the sound of the blackbird, and the
  world, which had seemed rather empty twelve hours before, was now brisk and
  alluring. His prowess in quick shaving assured him of his youth. "I'm no'
  that dead old," he observed, as he sat on the edge of he bed, to his
  reflection in the big looking-glass.</p>

  <p>It was not an old face. The sandy hair was a little thin on the top and a
  little grey at the temples, the figure was perhaps a little too full for
  youthful elegance, and an athlete would have censured the neck as too fleshy
  for perfect health. But the cheeks were rosy, the skin clear, and the pale
  eyes singularly childlike. They were a little weak, those eyes, and had some
  difficulty in looking for long at the same object, so that Mr. McCunn did not
  stare people in the face, and had, in consequence, at one time in his career
  acquired a perfectly undeserved reputation for cunning. He shaved clean, and
  looked uncommonly like a wise, plump schoolboy. As he gazed at his simulacrum
  he stopped whistling "Roy's Wife" and let his countenance harden into a noble
  sternness. Then he laughed, and observed in the language of his youth that
  there was "life in the auld dowg yet." In that moment the soul of Mr. McCunn
  conceived the Great Plan.</p>

  <p>The first sign of it was that he swept all his business garments
  unceremoniously on to the floor. The next that he rootled at the bottom of a
  deep drawer and extracted a most disreputable tweed suit. It had once been
  what I believe is called a Lovat mixture, but was now a nondescript subfusc,
  with bright patches of colour like moss on whinstone. He regarded it
  lovingly, for it had been for twenty years his holiday wear, emerging
  annually for a hallowed month to be stained with salt and bleached with sun.
  He put it on, and stood shrouded in an odour of camphor. A pair of thick
  nailed boots and a flannel shirt and collar completed the equipment of the
  sportsman. He had another long look at himself in the glass, and then
  descended whistling to breakfast. This time the tune was "Macgregors'
  Gathering," and the sound of it stirred the grimy lips of a man outside who
  was delivering coals&mdash;himself a Macgregor&mdash;to follow suit. Mr
  McCunn was a very fountain of music that morning.</p>

  <p>Tibby, the aged maid, had his newspaper and letters waiting by his plate,
  and a dish of ham and eggs frizzling near the fire. He fell to ravenously but
  still musingly, and he had reached the stage of scones and jam before he
  glanced at his correspondence. There was a letter from his wife now
  holidaying at the Neuk Hydropathic. She reported that her health was
  improving, and that she had met various people who had known somebody else
  whom she had once known herself. Mr. McCunn read the dutiful pages and
  smiled. "Mamma's enjoying herself fine," he observed to the teapot. He knew
  that for his wife the earthly paradise was a hydropathic, where she put on
  her afternoon dress and every jewel she possessed when she rose in the
  morning, ate large meals of which the novelty atoned for the nastiness, and
  collected an immense casual acquaintance, with whom she discussed ailments,
  ministers, sudden deaths, and the intricate genealogies of her class. For his
  part he rancorously hated hydropathics, having once spent a black week under
  the roof of one in his wife's company. He detested the food, the Turkish
  baths (he had a passionate aversion to baring his body before strangers), the
  inability to find anything to do and the compulsion to endless small talk. A
  thought flitted over his mind which he was too loyal to formulate. Once he
  and his wife had had similar likings, but they had taken different roads
  since their child died. Janet! He saw again&mdash;he was never quite free
  from the sight&mdash;the solemn little white-frocked girl who had died long
  ago in the Spring.</p>

  <p>It may have been the thought of the Neuk Hydropathic, or more likely the
  thin clean scent of the daffodils with which Tibby had decked the table, but
  long ere breakfast was finished the Great Plan had ceased to be an airy
  vision and become a sober well-masoned structure. Mr. McCunn&mdash;I may
  confess it at the start&mdash;was an incurable romantic.</p>

  <p>He had had a humdrum life since the day when he had first entered his
  uncle's shop with the hope of some day succeeding that honest grocer; and his
  feet had never strayed a yard from his sober rut. But his mind, like the
  Dying Gladiator's, had been far away. As a boy he had voyaged among books,
  and they had given him a world where he could shape his career according to
  his whimsical fancy. Not that Mr. McCunn was what is known as a great reader.
  He read slowly and fastidiously, and sought in literature for one thing
  alone. Sir Walter Scott had been his first guide, but he read the novels not
  for their insight into human character or for their historical pageantry, but
  because they gave him material wherewith to construct fantastic journeys. It
  was the same with Dickens. A lit tavern, a stage-coach, post-horses, the
  clack of hoofs on a frosty road, went to his head like wine. He was a
  Jacobite not because he had any views on Divine Right, but because he had
  always before his eyes a picture of a knot of adventurers in cloaks, new
  landed from France among the western heather.</p>

  <p>On this select basis he had built up his small library&mdash;Defoe,
  Hakluyt, Hazlitt and the essayists, Boswell, some indifferent romances, and a
  shelf of spirited poetry. His tastes became known, and he acquired a
  reputation for a scholarly habit. He was president of the Literary Society of
  the Guthrie Memorial Kirk, and read to its members a variety of papers full
  of a gusto which rarely became critical. He had been three times chairman at
  Burns Anniversary dinners, and had delivered orations in eulogy of the
  national Bard; not because he greatly admired him&mdash;he thought him rather
  vulgar&mdash;but because he took Burns as an emblem of the un-Burns-like
  literature which he loved. Mr. McCunn was no scholar and was sublimely
  unconscious of background. He grew his flowers in his small garden-plot
  oblivious of their origin so long as they gave him the colour and scent he
  sought. Scent, I say, for he appreciated more than the mere picturesque. He
  had a passion for words and cadences, and would be haunted for weeks by a
  cunning phrase, savouring it as a connoisseur savours a vintage. Wherefore
  long ago, when he could ill afford it, he had purchased the Edinburgh
  Stevenson. They were the only large books on his shelves, for he had a liking
  for small volumes&mdash;things he could stuff into his pocket in that sudden
  journey which he loved to contemplate.</p>

  <p>Only he had never taken it. The shop had tied him up for eleven months in
  the year, and the twelfth had always found him settled decorously with his
  wife in some seaside villa. He had not fretted, for he was content with
  dreams. He was always a little tired, too, when the holidays came, and his
  wife told him he was growing old. He consoled himself with tags from the more
  philosophic of his authors, but he scarcely needed consolation. For he had
  large stores of modest contentment.</p>

  <p>But now something had happened. A spring morning and a safety razor had
  convinced him that he was still young. Since yesterday he was a man of a
  large leisure. Providence had done for him what he would never have done for
  himself. The rut in which he had travelled so long had given place to open
  country. He repeated to himself one of the quotations with which he had been
  wont to stir the literary young men at the Guthrie Memorial Kirk:</p>

  <p class="poem">"What's a man's age? He must hurry more, that's all;<br>
  Cram in a day, what his youth took a year to hold:<br>
  When we mind labour, then only, we're too old&mdash;<br>
  What age had Methusalem when he begat Saul?<br>
  He would go journeying&mdash;who but he?&mdash;pleasantly."</p>

  <p>It sounds a trivial resolve, but it quickened Mr. McCunn to the depths of
  his being. A holiday, and alone! On foot, of course, for he must travel
  light. He would buckle on a pack after the approved fashion. He had the very
  thing in a drawer upstairs, which he had bought some years ago at a sale.
  That and a waterproof and a stick, and his outfit was complete. A book, too,
  and, as he lit his first pipe, he considered what it should be. Poetry,
  clearly, for it was the Spring, and besides poetry could be got in pleasantly
  small bulk. He stood before his bookshelves trying to select a volume,
  rejecting one after another as inapposite. Browning&mdash;Keats,
  Shelley&mdash;they seemed more suited for the hearth than for the roadside.
  He did not want anything Scots, for he was of opinion that Spring came more
  richly in England and that English people had a better notion of it. He was
  tempted by the Oxford Anthology, but was deterred by its thickness, for he
  did not possess the thin-paper edition. Finally he selected Izaak Walton. He
  had never fished in his life, but The Compleat Angler seemed to fit his mood.
  It was old and curious and learned and fragrant with the youth of things. He
  remembered its falling cadences, its country songs and wise meditations.
  Decidedly it was the right scrip for his pilgrimage.</p>

  <p>Characteristically he thought last of where he was to go. Every bit of the
  world beyond his front door had its charms to the seeing eye. There seemed
  nothing common or unclean that fresh morning. Even a walk among coal-pits had
  its attractions. But since he had the right to choose, he lingered over it
  like an epicure. Not the Highlands, for Spring came late among their sour
  mosses. Some place where there were fields and woods and inns, somewhere,
  too, within call of the sea. It must not be too remote, for he had no time to
  waste on train journeys; nor too near, for he wanted a countryside untainted.
  Presently he thought of Carrick. A good green land, as he remembered it, with
  purposeful white roads and public-houses sacred to the memory of Burns; near
  the hills but yet lowland, and with a bright sea chafing on its shores. He
  decided on Carrick, found a map, and planned his journey.</p>

  <p>Then he routed out his knapsack, packed it with a modest change of
  raiment, and sent out Tibby to buy chocolate and tobacco and to cash a cheque
  at the Strathclyde Bank. Till Tibby returned he occupied himself with
  delicious dreams. He saw himself daily growing browner and leaner, swinging
  along broad highways or wandering in bypaths. He pictured his seasons of
  ease, when he unslung his pack and smoked in some clump of lilacs by a
  burnside&mdash;he remembered a phrase of Stevenson's somewhat like that. He
  would meet and talk with all sorts of folk; an exhilarating prospect, for Mr.
  McCunn loved his kind. There would be the evening hour before he reached his
  inn, when, pleasantly tired, he would top some ridge and see the welcoming
  lights of a little town. There would be the lamp-lit after-supper time when
  he would read and reflect, and the start in the gay morning, when tobacco
  tastes sweetest and even fifty-five seems young. It would be holiday of the
  purest, for no business now tugged at his coat-tails. He was beginning a new
  life, he told himself, when he could cultivate the seedling interests which
  had withered beneath the far-reaching shade of the shop. Was ever a man more
  fortunate or more free?</p>

  <p>Tibby was told that he was going off for a week or two. No letters need be
  forwarded, for he would be constantly moving, but Mrs. McCunn at the Neuk
  Hydropathic would be kept informed of his whereabouts. Presently he stood on
  his doorstep, a stocky figure in ancient tweeds, with a bulging pack slung on
  his arm, and a stout hazel stick in his hand. A passer-by would have remarked
  an elderly shopkeeper bent apparently on a day in the country, a common
  little man on a prosaic errand. But the passer-by would have been wrong, for
  he could not see into the heart. The plump citizen was the eternal pilgrim;
  he was Jason, Ulysses, Eric the Red, Albuquerque, Cortez&mdash;starting out
  to discover new worlds.</p>

  <p>Before he left Mr. McCunn had given Tibby a letter to post. That morning
  he had received an epistle from a benevolent acquaintance, one Mackintosh,
  regarding a group of urchins who called themselves the "Gorbals Die-Hards."
  Behind the premises in Mearns Street lay a tract of slums, full of
  mischievous boys, with whom his staff waged truceless war. But lately there
  had started among them a kind of unauthorised and unofficial Boy Scouts, who,
  without uniform or badge or any kind of paraphernalia, followed the banner of
  Sir Robert Baden-Powell and subjected themselves to a rude discipline. They
  were far too poor to join an orthodox troop, but they faithfully copied what
  they believed to be the practices of more fortunate boys. Mr. McCunn had
  witnessed their pathetic parades, and had even passed the time of day with
  their leader, a red-haired savage called Dougal. The philanthropic Mackintosh
  had taken an interest in the gang and now desired subscriptions to send them
  to camp in the country.</p>

  <p>Mr. McCunn, in his new exhilaration, felt that he could not deny to others
  what he proposed for himself. His last act before leaving was to send
  Mackintosh ten pounds.</p><br>

     id="ref4">CHAPTER 2</a></h3>

  <h2>OF MR. JOHN HERITAGE<br>
  AND THE DIFFERENCE IN POINTS OF VIEW</h2>

  <p>Dickson McCunn was never to forget the first stage in that pilgrimage. A
  little after midday he descended from a grimy third-class carriage at a
  little station whose name I have forgotten. In the village nearby he
  purchased some new-baked buns and ginger biscuits, to which he was partial,
  and followed by the shouts of urchins, who admired his pack&mdash;"Look at
  the auld man gaun to the schule"&mdash;he emerged into open country. The late
  April noon gleamed like a frosty morning, but the air, though tonic, was
  kind. The road ran over sweeps of moorland where curlews wailed, and into
  lowland pastures dotted with very white, very vocal lambs. The young grass
  had the warm fragrance of new milk. As he went he munched his buns, for he
  had resolved to have no plethoric midday meal, and presently he found the
  burnside nook of his fancy, and halted to smoke. On a patch of turf close to
  a grey stone bridge he had out his Walton and read the chapter on "The
  Chavender or Chub." The collocation of words delighted him and inspired him
  to verse. "Lavender or Lub"&mdash;"Pavender or Pub"&mdash;"Gravender or
  Grub"&mdash;but the monosyllables proved too vulgar for poetry. Regretfully
  he desisted.</p>

  <p>The rest of the road was as idyllic as the start. He would tramp steadily
  for a mile or so and then saunter, leaning over bridges to watch the trout in
  the pools, admiring from a dry-stone dyke the unsteady gambols of new-born
  lambs, kicking up dust from strips of moor-burn on the heather. Once by a
  fir-wood he was privileged to surprise three lunatic hares waltzing. His
  cheeks glowed with the sun; he moved in an atmosphere of pastoral, serene and
  contented. When the shadows began to lengthen he arrived at the village of
  Cloncae, where he proposed to lie. The inn looked dirty, but he found a
  decent widow, above whose door ran the legend in home-made lettering, "Mrs.
  Brockie - Tea and Coffee," and who was willing to give him quarters. There he
  supped handsomely off ham and eggs, and dipped into a work called Covenanting
  Worthies, which garnished a table decorated with sea-shells. At half-past
  nine precisely he retired to bed and unhesitating sleep.</p>

  <p>Next morning he awoke to a changed world. The sky was grey and so low that
  his outlook was bounded by a cabbage garden, while a surly wind prophesied
  rain. It was chilly, too, and he had his breakfast beside the kitchen fire.
  Mrs. Brockie could not spare a capital letter for her surname on the
  signboard, but she exalted it in her talk. He heard of a multitude of
  Brockies, ascendant, descendant, and collateral, who seemed to be in a fair
  way to inherit the earth. Dickson listened sympathetically, and lingered by
  the fire. He felt stiff from yesterday's exercise, and the edge was off his
  spirit.</p>

  <p>The start was not quite what he had pictured. His pack seemed heavier, his
  boots tighter, and his pipe drew badly. The first miles were all uphill, with
  a wind tingling his ears, and no colours in the landscape but brown and grey.
  Suddenly he awoke to the fact that he was dismal, and thrust the notion
  behind him. He expanded his chest and drew in long draughts of air. He told
  himself that this sharp weather was better than sunshine. He remembered that
  all travellers in romances battled with mist and rain. Presently his body
  recovered comfort and vigour, and his mind worked itself into
  cheerfulness.</p>

  <p>He overtook a party of tramps and fell into talk with them. He had always
  had a fancy for the class, though he had never known anything nearer it than
  city beggars. He pictured them as philosophic vagabonds, full of quaint turns
  of speech, unconscious Borrovians. With these samples his disillusionment was
  speedy. The party was made up of a ferret-faced man with a red nose, a
  draggle-tailed woman, and a child in a crazy perambulator. Their conversation
  was one-sided, for it immediately resolved itself into a whining chronicle of
  misfortunes and petitions for relief. It cost him half a crown to be rid of
  them.</p>

  <p>The road was alive with tramps that day. The next one did the accosting.
  Hailing Mr. McCunn as "Guv'nor," he asked to be told the way to Manchester.
  The objective seemed so enterprising that Dickson was impelled to ask
  questions, and heard, in what appeared to be in the accents of the Colonies,
  the tale of a career of unvarying calamity. There was nothing merry or
  philosophic about this adventurer. Nay, there was something menacing. He eyed
  his companion's waterproof covetously, and declared that he had had one like
  it which had been stolen from him the day before. Had the place been lonely
  he might have contemplated highway robbery, but they were at the entrance to
  a village, and the sight of a public-house awoke his thirst. Dickson parted
  with him at the cost of sixpence for a drink.</p>

  <p>He had no more company that morning except an aged stone-breaker whom he
  convoyed for half a mile. The stone-breaker also was soured with the world.
  He walked with a limp, which, he said, was due to an accident years before,
  when he had been run into by "ane of thae damned velocipeeds." The word
  revived in Dickson memories of his youth, and he was prepared to be friendly.
  But the ancient would have none of it. He inquired morosely what he was
  after, and, on being told remarked that he might have learned more sense.
  "It's a daft-like thing for an auld man like you to be traivellin' the roads.
  Ye maun be ill-off for a job." Questioned as to himself, he became, as the
  newspapers say, "reticent," and having reached his bing of stones, turned
  rudely to his duties. "Awa' hame wi' ye," were his parting words. "It's idle
  scoondrels like you that maks wark for honest folk like me."</p>

  <p>The morning was not a success, but the strong air had given Dickson such
  an appetite that he resolved to break his rule, and, on reaching the little
  town of Kilchrist, he sought luncheon at the chief hotel. There he found that
  which revived his spirits. A solitary bagman shared the meal, who revealed
  the fact that he was in the grocery line. There followed a well-informed and
  most technical conversation. He was drawn to speak of the United Supply
  Stores, Limited, of their prospects and of their predecessor, Mr. McCunn,
  whom he knew well by repute but had never met. "Yon's the clever one." he
  observed. "I've always said there's no longer head in the city of Glasgow
  than McCunn. An old-fashioned firm, but it has aye managed to keep up with
  the times. He's just retired, they tell me, and in my opinion it's a big loss
  to the provision trade...  " Dickson's heart glowed within him. Here was
  Romance; to be praised incognito; to enter a casual inn and find that fame
  had preceded him. He warmed to the bagman, insisted on giving him a liqueur
  and a cigar, and finally revealed himself. "I'm Dickson McCunn," he said,
  "taking a bit holiday. If there's anything I can do for you when I get back,
  just let me know." With mutual esteem they parted.</p>

  <p>He had need of all his good spirits, for he emerged into an unrelenting
  drizzle. The environs of Kilchrist are at the best unlovely, and in the wet
  they were as melancholy as a graveyard. But the encounter with the bagman had
  worked wonders with Dickson, and he strode lustily into the weather, his
  waterproof collar buttoned round his chin. The road climbed to a bare moor,
  where lagoons had formed in the ruts, and the mist showed on each side only a
  yard or two of soaking heather. Soon he was wet; presently every part of
  him&mdash;boots, body, and pack&mdash;was one vast sponge. The waterproof was
  not water-proof, and the rain penetrated to his most intimate garments.
  Little he cared. He felt lighter, younger, than on the idyllic previous day.
  He enjoyed the buffets of the storm, and one wet mile succeeded another to
  the accompaniment of Dickson's shouts and laughter. There was no one abroad
  that afternoon, so he could talk aloud to himself and repeat his favourite
  poems. About five in the evening there presented himself at the Black Bull
  Inn at Kirkmichael a soaked, disreputable, but most cheerful traveller.</p>

  <p>Now the Black Bull at Kirkmichael is one of the few very good inns left in
  the world. It is an old place and an hospitable, for it has been for
  generations a haunt of anglers, who above all other men understand comfort.
  There are always bright fires there, and hot water, and old soft leather
  armchairs, and an aroma of good food and good tobacco, and giant trout in
  glass cases, and pictures of Captain Barclay of Urie walking to London and
  Mr. Ramsay of Barnton winning a horse-race, and the three-volume edition of
  the Waverley Novels with many volumes missing, and indeed all those things
  which an inn should have. Also there used to be&mdash;there may still
  be&mdash;sound vintage claret in the cellars. The Black Bull expects its
  guests to arrive in every stage of dishevelment, and Dickson was received by
  a cordial landlord, who offered dry garments as a matter of course. The pack
  proved to have resisted the elements, and a suit of clothes and slippers were
  provided by the house. Dickson, after a glass of toddy, wallowed in a hot
  bath, which washed all the stiffness out of him. He had a fire in his
  bedroom, beside which he wrote the opening passages of that diary he had
  vowed to keep, descanting lyrically upon the joys of ill weather. At seven
  o'clock, warm and satisfied in soul, and with his body clad in raiment
  several sizes too large for it, he descended to dinner.</p>

  <p>At one end of the long table in the dining-room sat a group of anglers.
  They looked jovial fellows, and Dickson would fain have joined them; but,
  having been fishing all day in the Lock o' the Threshes, they were talking
  their own talk, and he feared that his admiration for Izaak Walton did not
  qualify him to butt into the erudite discussions of fishermen. The landlord
  seemed to think likewise, for he drew back a chair for him at the other end,
  where sat a young man absorbed in a book. Dickson gave him good evening, and
  got an abstracted reply. The young man supped the Black Bull's excellent
  broth with one hand, and with the other turned the pages of his volume. A
  glance convinced Dickson that the work was French, a literature which did not
  interest him. He knew little of the tongue and suspected it of
  impropriety.</p>

  <p>Another guest entered and took the chair opposite the bookish young man.
  He was also young&mdash;not more than thirty-three&mdash;and to Dickson's eye
  was the kind of person he would have liked to resemble. He was tall and free
  from any superfluous flesh; his face was lean, fine-drawn, and deeply
  sunburnt, so that the hair above showed oddly pale; the hands were brown and
  beautifully shaped, but the forearm revealed by the loose cuffs of his shirt
  was as brawny as a blacksmith's. He had rather pale blue eyes, which seemed
  to have looked much at the sun, and a small moustache the colour of ripe hay.
  His voice was low and pleasant, and he pronounced his words precisely, like a
  foreigner.</p>

  <p>He was very ready to talk, but in defiance of Dr. Johnson's warning, his
  talk was all questions. He wanted to know everything about the
  neighbourhood&mdash;who lived in what houses, what were the distances between
  the towns, what harbours would admit what class of vessel. Smiling agreeably,
  he put Dickson through a catechism to which he knew none of the answers. The
  landlord was called in, and proved more helpful. But on one matter he was
  fairly at a loss. The catechist asked about a house called Darkwater, and was
  met with a shake of the head. "I know no sic-like name in this countryside,
  sir," and the catechist looked disappointed.</p>

  <p>The literary young man said nothing, but ate trout abstractedly, one eye
  on his book. The fish had been caught by the anglers in the Loch o' the
  Threshes, and phrases describing their capture floated from the other end of
  the table. The young man had a second helping, and then refused the excellent
  hill mutton that followed, contenting himself with cheese. Not so Dickson and
  the catechist. They ate everything that was set before them, topping up with
  a glass of port. Then the latter, who had been talking illuminatingly about
  Spain, rose, bowed, and left the table, leaving Dickson, who liked to linger
  over his meals, to the society of the ichthyophagous student.</p>

  <p>He nodded towards the book. "Interesting?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The young man shook his head and displayed the name on the cover. "Anatole
  France. I used to be crazy about him, but now he seems rather a back number."
  Then he glanced towards the just-vacated chair. "Australian," he said.</p>

  <p>"How d'you know?"</p>

  <p>"Can't mistake them. There's nothing else so lean and fine produced on the
  globe to-day. I was next door to them at Pozieres and saw them fight. Lord!
  Such men! Now and then you had a freak, but most looked like Phoebus
  Apollo."</p>

  <p>Dickson gazed with a new respect at his neighbour, for he had not
  associated him with battle-fields. During the war he had been a fervent
  patriot, but, though he had never heard a shot himself, so many of his
  friends' sons and nephews, not to mention cousins of his own, had seen
  service, that he had come to regard the experience as commonplace. Lions in
  Africa and bandits in Mexico seemed to him novel and romantic things, but not
  trenches and airplanes which were the whole world's property. But he could
  scarcely fit his neighbour into even his haziest picture of war. The young
  man was tall and a little round-shouldered; he had short-sighted, rather
  prominent brown eyes, untidy black hair and dark eyebrows which came near to
  meeting. He wore a knickerbocker suit of bluish-grey tweed, a pale blue
  shirt, a pale blue collar, and a dark blue tie&mdash;a symphony of colour
  which seemed too elaborately considered to be quite natural. Dickson had set
  him down as an artist or a newspaper correspondent, objects to him of lively
  interest. But now the classification must be reconsidered.</p>

  <p>"So you were in the war," he said encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"Four blasted years," was the savage reply. "And I never want to hear the
  name of the beastly thing again."</p>

  <p>"You said he was an Australian," said Dickson, casting back. "But I
  thought Australians had a queer accent, like the English."</p>

  <p>"They've all kind of accents, but you can never mistake their voice. It's
  got the sun in it. Canadians have got grinding ice in theirs, and Virginians
  have got butter. So have the Irish. In Britain there are no voices, only
  speaking-tubes. It isn't safe to judge men by their accent only. You yourself
  I take to be Scotch, but for all I know you may be a senator from Chicago or
  a Boer General."</p>

  <p>"I'm from Glasgow. My name's Dickson McCunn." He had a faint hope that the
  announcement might affect the other as it had affected the bagman at
  Kilchrist.</p>

  <p>"Golly, what a name!" exclaimed the young man rudely.</p>

  <p>Dickson was nettled. "It's very old Highland," he said. "It means the son
  of a dog."</p>

  <p>"Which&mdash;Christian name or surname?" Then the young man appeared to
  think he had gone too far, for he smiled pleasantly. "And a very good name
  too. Mine is prosaic by comparison. They call me John Heritage."</p>

  <p>"That," said Dickson, mollified, "is like a name out of a book. With that
  name by rights you should be a poet."</p>

  <p>Gloom settled on the young man's countenance. "It's a dashed sight too
  poetic. It's like Edwin Arnold and Alfred Austin and Dante Gabriel Rossetti.
  Great poets have vulgar monosyllables for names, like Keats. The new
  Shakespeare when he comes along will probably be called Grubb or Jubber, if
  he isn't Jones. With a name like yours I might have a chance. You should be
  the poet."</p>

  <p>"I'm very fond of reading," said Dickson modestly.</p>

  <p>A slow smile crumpled Mr. Heritage's face. "There's a fire in the
  smoking-room," he observed as he rose. "We'd better bag the armchairs before
  these fishing louts take them." Dickson followed obediently. This was the
  kind of chance acquaintance for whom he had hoped, and he was prepared to
  make the most of him.</p>

  <p>The fire burned bright in the little dusky smoking-room, lighted by one
  oil-lamp. Mr. Heritage flung himself into a chair, stretched his long legs,
  and lit a pipe.</p>

  <p>"You like reading?" he asked. "What sort? Any use for poetry?"</p>

  <p>"Plenty," said Dickson. "I've aye been fond of learning it up and
  repeating it to myself when I had nothing to do. In church and waiting on
  trains, like. It used to be Tennyson, but now it's more Browning. I can say a
  lot of Browning."</p>

  <p>The other screwed his face into an expression of disgust. "I know the
  stuff. 'Damask cheeks and dewy sister eyelids.' Or else the Ercles
  vein&mdash;'God's in His Heaven, all's right with the world.' No good, Mr.
  McCunn. All back numbers. Poetry's not a thing of pretty round phrases or
  noisy invocations. It's life itself, with the tang of the raw world in
  it&mdash;not a sweetmeat for middle-class women in parlours."</p>

  <p>"Are you a poet, Mr. Heritage?"</p>

  <p>"No, Dogson, I'm a paper-maker."</p>

  <p>This was a new view to Mr. McCunn. "I just once knew a paper-maker," he
  observed reflectively, "They called him Tosh. He drank a bit."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't drink," said the other. "I'm a paper-maker, but that's for
  my bread and butter. Some day for my own sake I may be a poet."</p>

  <p>"Have you published anything?"</p>

  <p>The eager admiration in Dickson's tone gratified Mr. Heritage. He drew
  from his pocket a slim book. "My first fruits," he said, rather shyly.</p>

  <p>Dickson received it with reverence. It was a small volume in grey paper
  boards with a white label on the back, and it was lettered: <i>Whorls - John
  Heritage's Book</i>. He turned the pages and read a little. "It's a nice wee
  book," he observed at length.</p>

  <p>"Good God, if you call it nice, I must have failed pretty badly," was the
  irritated answer.</p>

  <p>Dickson read more deeply and was puzzled. It seemed worse than the worst
  of Browning to understand. He found one poem about a garden entitled
  "Revue."</p>

  <p class="poem">"Crimson and resonant clangs the dawn,"</p>

  <p>said the poet. Then he went on to describe noonday:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Sunflowers, tall Grenadiers, ogle the roses' short-skirted
  ballet.<br>
  The fumes of dark sweet wine hidden in frail petals<br>
  Madden the drunkard bees... "</p>

  <p>This seemed to him an odd way to look at things, and he boggled over a
  phrase about an "epicene lily." Then came evening: "The painted gauze of the
  stars flutters in a fold of twilight crape," sang Mr. Heritage; and again,
  "The moon's pale leprosy sloughs the fields."</p>

  <p>Dickson turned to other verses which apparently enshrined the writer's
  memory of the trenches. They were largely compounded of oaths, and rather
  horrible, lingering lovingly over sights and smells which every one is aware
  of, but most people contrive to forget. He did not like them. Finally he
  skimmed a poem about a lady who turned into a bird. The evolution was
  described with intimate anatomical details which scared the honest
  reader.</p>

  <p>He kept his eyes on the book, for he did not know what to say. The trick
  seemed to be to describe nature in metaphors mostly drawn from music-halls
  and haberdashers' shops, and, when at a loss, to fall to cursing. He thought
  it frankly very bad, and he laboured to find words which would combine
  politeness and honesty.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said the poet.</p>

  <p>"There's a lot of fine things here, but&mdash;but the lines don't just
  seem to scan very well."</p>

  <p>Mr. Heritage laughed. "Now I can place you exactly. You like the meek
  rhyme and the conventional epithet. Well, I don't. The world has passed
  beyond that prettiness. You want the moon described as a Huntress or a gold
  disc or a flower&mdash;I say it's oftener like a beer barrel or a cheese. You
  want a wealth of jolly words and real things ruled out as unfit for poetry. I
  say there's nothing unfit for poetry. Nothing, Dogson! Poetry's everywhere,
  and the real thing is commoner among drabs and pot-houses and rubbish-heaps
  than in your Sunday parlours. The poet's business is to distil it out of
  rottenness, and show that it is all one spirit, the thing that keeps the
  stars in their place. I wanted to call my book <i>Drains</i>, for drains are
  sheer poetry carrying off the excess and discards of human life to make the
  fields green and the corn ripen. But the publishers kicked. So I called it
  <i>Whorls</i>, to express my view of the exquisite involution of all things.
  Poetry is the fourth dimension of the soul. Well, let's hear about your taste
  in prose."</p>

  <p>Mr. McCunn was much bewildered, and a little inclined to be cross. He
  disliked being called Dogson, which seemed to him an abuse of his
  etymological confidences. But his habit of politeness held.</p>

  <p>He explained rather haltingly his preferences in prose.</p>

  <p>Mr. Heritage listened with wrinkled brows.</p>

  <p>"You're even deeper in the mud than I thought," he remarked. "You live in
  a world of painted laths and shadows. All this passion for the picturesque!
  Trash, my dear man, like a schoolgirl's novelette heroes. You make up
  romances about gipsies and sailors, and the blackguards they call pioneers,
  but you know nothing about them. If you did, you would find they had none of
  the gilt and gloss you imagine. But the great things they have got in common
  with all humanity you ignore. It's like&mdash;it's like sentimentalising
  about a pancake because it looked like a buttercup, and all the while not
  knowing that it was good to eat."</p>

  <p>At that moment the Australian entered the room to get a light for his
  pipe. He wore a motor-cyclist's overalls and appeared to be about to take the
  road. He bade them good night, and it seemed to Dickson that his face, seen
  in the glow of the fire, was drawn and anxious, unlike that of the agreeable
  companion at dinner.</p>

  <p>"There," said Mr. Heritage, nodding after the departing figure. "I dare
  say you have been telling yourself stories about that chap&mdash;life in the
  bush, stockriding and the rest of it. But probably he's a bank-clerk from
  Melbourne. Your romanticism is one vast self-delusion, and it blinds your eye
  to the real thing. We have got to clear it out, and with it all the damnable
  humbug of the Kelt."</p>

  <p>Mr. McCunn, who spelt the word with a soft "C," was puzzled. "I thought a
  kelt was a kind of a no-weel fish," he interposed.</p>

  <p>But the other, in the flood-tide of his argument, ignored the
  interruption. "That's the value of the war," he went on. "It has burst up all
  the old conventions, and we've got to finish the destruction before we can
  build. It is the same with literature and religion, and society and politics.
  At them with the axe, say I. I have no use for priests and pedants. I've no
  use for upper classes and middle classes. There's only one class that
  matters, the plain man, the workers, who live close to life."</p>

  <p>"The place for you," said Dickson dryly, "is in Russia among the
  Bolsheviks."</p>

  <p>Mr. Heritage approved. "They are doing a great work in their own fashion.
  We needn't imitate all their methods&mdash;they're a trifle crude and have
  too many Jews among them&mdash;but they've got hold of the right end of the
  stick. They seek truth and reality."</p>

  <p>Mr. McCunn was slowly being roused.</p>

  <p>"What brings you wandering hereaways?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Exercise," was the answer. "I've been kept pretty closely tied up all
  winter. And I want leisure and quiet to think over things."</p>

  <p>"Well, there's one subject you might turn your attention to. You'll have
  been educated like a gentleman?"</p>

  <p>"Nine wasted years&mdash;five at Harrow, four at Cambridge."</p>

  <p>"See here, then. You're daft about the working-class and have no use for
  any other. But what in the name of goodness do you know about working-men? I
  come out of them myself, and have lived next door to them all my days. Take
  them one way and another, they're a decent sort, good and bad like the rest
  of us. But there's a wheen daft folk that would set them up as models&mdash;
  close to truth and reality, says you. It's sheer ignorance, for you're about
  as well acquaint with the working-man as with King Solomon. You say I make up
  fine stories about tinklers and sailor-men because I know nothing about them.
  That's maybe true. But you're at the same job yourself. You ideelise the
  working man, you and your kind, because you're ignorant. You say that he's
  seeking for truth, when he's only looking for a drink and a rise in wages.
  You tell me he's near reality, but I tell you that his notion of reality is
  often just a short working day and looking on at a footba'-match on Saturday.
  And when you run down what you call the middle-classes that do three-quarters
  of the world's work and keep the machine going and the working-man in a job,
  then I tell you you're talking havers. Havers!"</p>

  <p>Mr. McCunn, having delivered his defence of the bourgeoisie, rose abruptly
  and went to bed. He felt jarred and irritated. His innocent little private
  domain had been badly trampled by this stray bull of a poet. But as he lay in
  bed, before blowing out his candle, he had recourse to Walton, and found a
  passage on which, as on a pillow, he went peacefully to sleep:</p>

  <p>"As I left this place, and entered into the next field, a second pleasure
  entertained me; 'twas a handsome milkmaid, that had not yet attained so much
  age and wisdom as to load her mind with any fears of many things that will
  never be, as too many men too often do; but she cast away all care, and sang
  like a nightingale; her voice was good, and the ditty fitted for it; it was
  the smooth song that was made by Kit Marlow now at least fifty years ago. And
  the milkmaid's mother sung an answer to it, which was made by Sir Walter
  Raleigh in his younger days. They were old-fashioned poetry, but choicely
  good; I think much better than the strong lines that are now in fashion in
  this critical age."</p><br>

  <h2>HOW CHILDE ROLAND AND ANOTHER<br>
  CAME TO THE DARK TOWER</h2>

  <p>Dickson woke with a vague sense of irritation. As his recollections took
  form they produced a very unpleasant picture of Mr. John Heritage. The poet
  had loosened all his placid idols, so that they shook and rattled in the
  niches where they had been erstwhile so secure. Mr. McCunn had a mind of a
  singular candour, and was prepared most honestly at all times to revise his
  views. But by this iconoclast he had been only irritated and in no way
  convinced. "Sich poetry!" he muttered to himself as he shivered in his bath
  (a daily cold tub instead of his customary hot one on Saturday night being
  part of the discipline of his holiday). "And yon blethers about the
  working-man!" he ingeminated as he shaved. He breakfasted alone, having
  outstripped even the fishermen, and as he ate he arrived at conclusions. He
  had a great respect for youth, but a line must be drawn somewhere. "The man's
  a child," he decided, "and not like to grow up. The way he's besotted on
  everything daftlike, if it's only new. And he's no rightly young
  either&mdash;speaks like an auld dominie, whiles. And he's rather impident,"
  he concluded, with memories of "Dogson." He was very clear that he never
  wanted to see him again; that was the reason of his early breakfast. Having
  clarified his mind by definitions, Dickson felt comforted. He paid his bill,
  took an affectionate farewell of the landlord, and at 7.30 precisely stepped
  out into the gleaming morning.</p>

  <p>It was such a day as only a Scots April can show. The cobbled streets of
  Kirkmichael still shone with the night's rain, but the storm clouds had fled
  before a mild south wind, and the whole circumference of the sky was a
  delicate translucent blue. Homely breakfast smells came from the houses and
  delighted Mr. McCunn's nostrils; a squalling child was a pleasant reminder of
  an awakening world, the urban counterpart to the morning song of birds; even
  the sanitary cart seemed a picturesque vehicle. He bought his ration of buns
  and ginger biscuits at a baker's shop whence various ragamuffin boys were
  preparing to distribute the householders' bread, and took his way up the
  Gallows Hill to the Burgh Muir almost with regret at leaving so pleasant a
  habitation.</p>

  <p>A chronicle of ripe vintages must pass lightly over small beer. I will not
  dwell on his leisurely progress in the bright weather, or on his luncheon in
  a coppice of young firs, or on his thoughts which had returned to the
  idyllic. I take up the narrative at about three o'clock in the afternoon,
  when he is revealed seated on a milestone examining his map. For he had come,
  all unwitting, to a turning of the ways, and his choice is the cause of this
  veracious history.</p>

  <p>The place was high up on a bare moor, which showed a white lodge among
  pines, a white cottage in a green nook by a burnside, and no other marks of
  human dwelling. To his left, which was the east, the heather rose to a low
  ridge of hill, much scarred with peat-bogs, behind which appeared the blue
  shoulder of a considerable mountain. Before him the road was lost momentarily
  in the woods of a shooting-box, but reappeared at a great distance climbing a
  swell of upland which seemed to be the glacis of a jumble of bold summits.
  There was a pass there, the map told him, which led into Galloway. It was the
  road he had meant to follow, but as he sat on the milestone his purpose
  wavered. For there seemed greater attractions in the country which lay to the
  westward. Mr. McCunn, be it remembered, was not in search of brown heath and
  shaggy wood; he wanted greenery and the Spring.</p>

  <p>Westward there ran out a peninsula in the shape of an isosceles triangle,
  of which his present high-road was the base. At a distance of a mile or so a
  railway ran parallel to the road, and he could see the smoke of a goods train
  waiting at a tiny station islanded in acres of bog. Thence the moor swept
  down to meadows and scattered copses, above which hung a thin haze of smoke
  which betokened a village. Beyond it were further woodlands, not firs but old
  shady trees, and as they narrowed to a point the gleam of two tiny estuaries
  appeared on either side. He could not see the final cape, but he saw the sea
  beyond it, flawed with catspaws, gold in the afternoon sun, and on it a small
  herring smack flopping listless sails.</p>

  <p>Something in the view caught and held his fancy. He conned his map, and
  made out the names. The peninsula was called the Cruives&mdash;an old name
  apparently, for it was in antique lettering. He vaguely remembered that
  "cruives" had something to do with fishing, doubtless in the two streams
  which flanked it. One he had already crossed, the Laver, a clear tumbling
  water springing from green hills; the other, the Garple, descended from the
  rougher mountains to the south. The hidden village bore the name of
  Dalquharter, and the uncouth syllables awoke some vague recollection in his
  mind. The great house in the trees beyond&mdash;it must be a great house, for
  the map showed large policies&mdash;was Huntingtower.</p>

  <p>The last name fascinated and almost decided him. He pictured an ancient
  keep by the sea, defended by converging rivers, which some old Comyn lord of
  Galloway had built to command the shore road, and from which he had sallied
  to hunt in his wild hills. He liked the way the moor dropped down to green
  meadows, and the mystery of the dark woods beyond. He wanted to explore the
  twin waters, and see how they entered that strange shimmering sea. The odd
  names, the odd cul-de-sac of a peninsula, powerfully attracted him. Why
  should he not spend a night there, for the map showed clearly that
  Dalquharter had an inn? He must decide promptly, for before him a side-road
  left the highway, and the signpost bore the legend, "Dalquharter and
  Huntingtower."</p>

  <p>Mr. McCunn, being a cautious and pious man, took the omens. He tossed a
  penny&mdash;heads go on, tails turn aside. It fell tails.</p>

  <p>He knew as soon as he had taken three steps down the side-road that he was
  doing something momentous, and the exhilaration of enterprise stole into his
  soul. It occurred to him that this was the kind of landscape that he had
  always especially hankered after, and had made pictures of when he had a
  longing for the country on him&mdash;a wooded cape between streams, with
  meadows inland and then a long lift of heather. He had the same feeling of
  expectancy, of something most interesting and curious on the eve of
  happening, that he had had long ago when he waited on the curtain rising at
  his first play. His spirits soared like the lark, and he took to singing. If
  only the inn at Dalquharter were snug and empty, this was going to be a day
  in ten thousand. Thus mirthfully he swung down the rough grass-grown road,
  past the railway, till he came to a point where heath began to merge in
  pasture, and dry-stone walls split the moor into fields. Suddenly his pace
  slackened and song died on his lips. For, approaching from the right by a
  tributary path was the Poet.</p>

  <p>Mr. Heritage saw him afar off and waved a friendly hand. In spite of his
  chagrin Dickson could not but confess that he had misjudged his critic.
  Striding with long steps over the heather, his jacket open to the wind, his
  face a-glow and his capless head like a whin-bush for disorder, he cut a more
  wholesome figure than in the smoking-room the night before. He seemed to be
  in a companionable mood, for he brandished his stick and shouted
  greetings.</p>

  <p>"Well met!" he cried; "I was hoping to fall in with you again. You must
  have thought me a pretty fair cub last night."</p>

  <p>"I did that," was the dry answer.</p>

  <p>"Well, I want to apologize. God knows what made me treat you to a
  university-extension lecture. I may not agree with you, but every man's
  entitled to his own views, and it was dashed poor form for me to start jawing
  you."</p>

  <p>Mr. McCunn had no gift of nursing anger, and was very susceptible to
  apologies.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," he murmured. "Don't mention it. I'm wondering what
  brought you down here, for it's off the road."</p>

  <p>"Caprice. Pure caprice. I liked the look of this butt-end of nowhere."</p>

  <p>"Same here. I've aye thought there was something terrible nice about a wee
  cape with a village at the neck of it and a burn each side."</p>

  <p>"Now that's interesting," said Mr. Heritage. "You're obsessed by a
  particular type of landscape. Ever read Freud?"</p>

  <p>Dickson shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Well, you've got an odd complex somewhere. I wonder where the key lies.
  Cape&mdash;woods&mdash;two rivers&mdash;moor behind. Ever been in love,
  Dogson?"</p>

  <p>Mr. McCunn was startled. "Love" was a word rarely mentioned in his circle
  except on death-beds, "I've been a married man for thirty years," he said
  hurriedly.</p>

  <p>"That won't do. It should have been a hopeless affair-the last sight of
  the lady on a spur of coast with water on three sides&mdash;that kind of
  thing, you know, or it might have happened to an ancestor. But you don't look
  the kind of breed for hopeless attachments. More likely some scoundrelly old
  Dogson long ago found sanctuary in this sort of place. Do you dream about
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Not exactly."</p>

  <p>"Well, I do. The queer thing is that I've got the same prepossession as
  you. As soon as I spotted this Cruives place on the map this morning, I saw
  it was what I was after. When I came in sight of it I almost shouted. I don't
  very often dream but when I do that's the place I frequent. Odd, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>Mr. McCunn was deeply interested at this unexpected revelation of romance.
  "Maybe it's being in love," he daringly observed.</p>

  <p>The Poet demurred. "No. I'm not a connoisseur of obvious sentiment. That
  explanation might fit your case, but not mine. I'm pretty certain there's
  something hideous at the back of MY complex&mdash;some grim old business
  tucked away back in the ages. For though I'm attracted by the place, I'm
  frightened too!"</p>

  <p>There seemed no room for fear in the delicate landscape now opening before
  them. In front, in groves of birch and rowan, smoked the first houses of a
  tiny village. The road had become a green "loaning," on the ample margin of
  which cattle grazed. The moorland still showed itself in spits of heather,
  and some distance off, where a rivulet ran in a hollow, there were signs of a
  fire and figures near it. These last Mr. Heritage regarded with
  disapproval.</p>

  <p>"Some infernal trippers!" he murmured. "Or Boy Scouts. They desecrate
  everything. Why can't the <i>tunicatus popellus</i> keep away from a paradise
  like this!" Dickson, a democrat who felt nothing incongruous in the presence
  of other holiday-makers, was meditating a sharp rejoinder, when Mr.
  Heritage's tone changed.</p>

  <p>"Ye gods! What a village!" he cried, as they turned a corner. There were
  not more than a dozen whitewashed houses, all set in little gardens of
  wallflower and daffodil and early fruit blossom. A triangle of green filled
  the intervening space, and in it stood an ancient wooden pump. There was no
  schoolhouse or kirk; not even a post-office&mdash;only a red box in a cottage
  side. Beyond rose the high wall and the dark trees of the demesne, and to the
  right up a by-road which clung to the park edge stood a two-storeyed building
  which bore the legend "The Cruives Inn."</p>

  <p>The Poet became lyrical. "At last!" he cried. "The village of my dreams!
  Not a sign of commerce! No church or school or beastly recreation hall!
  Nothing but these divine little cottages and an ancient pub! Dogson, I warn
  you, I'm going to have the devil of a tea." And he declaimed:</p>

  <p>"Thou shalt hear a song After a while which Gods may listen to; But place
  the flask upon the board and wait Until the stranger hath allayed his thirst,
  For poets, grasshoppers, and nightingales Sing cheerily but when the throat
  is moist."</p>

  <p>Dickson, too, longed with sensual gusto for tea. But, as they drew nearer,
  the inn lost its hospitable look. The cobbles of the yard were weedy, as if
  rarely visited by traffic, a pane in a window was broken, and the blinds hung
  tattered. The garden was a wilderness, and the doorstep had not been scoured
  for weeks. But the place had a landlord, for he had seen them approach and
  was waiting at the door to meet them.</p>

  <p>He was a big man in his shirt sleeves, wearing old riding breeches
  unbuttoned at the knees, and thick ploughman's boots. He had no leggings, and
  his fleshy calves were imperfectly covered with woollen socks. His face was
  large and pale, his neck bulged, and he had a gross unshaven jowl. He was a
  type familiar to students of society; not the innkeeper, which is a thing
  consistent with good breeding and all the refinements; a type not unknown in
  the House of Lords, especially among recent creations, common enough in the
  House of Commons and the City of London, and by no means infrequent in the
  governing circles of Labour; the type known to the discerning as the Licensed
  Victualler.</p>

  <p>His face was wrinkled in official smiles, and he gave the travellers a
  hearty good afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Can we stop here for the night?" Dickson asked.</p>

  <p>The landlord looked sharply at him, and then replied to Mr. Heritage. His
  expression passed from official bonhomie to official contrition.</p>

  <p>"Impossible, gentlemen. Quite impossible. Ye couldn't have come at a worse
  time. I've only been here a fortnight myself, and we haven't got right shaken
  down yet. Even then I might have made shift to do with ye, but the fact is
  we've illness in the house, and I'm fair at my wits' end. It breaks my heart
  to turn gentlemen away and me that keen to get the business started. But
  there it is!" He spat vigorously as if to emphasize the desperation of his
  quandary.</p>

  <p>The man was clearly Scots, but his native speech was overlaid with
  something alien, something which might have been acquired in America or in
  going down to the sea in ships. He hitched his breeches, too, with a nautical
  air.</p>

  <p>"Is there nowhere else we can put up?" Dickson asked.</p>

  <p>"Not in this one-horse place. Just a wheen auld wives that packed
  thegither they haven't room for an extra hen. But it's grand weather, and
  it's not above seven miles to Auchenlochan. Say the word and I'll yoke the
  horse and drive ye there."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. We prefer to walk," said Mr. Heritage. Dickson would have
  tarried to inquire after the illness in the house, but his companion hurried
  him off. Once he looked back, and saw the landlord still on the doorstep
  gazing after them.</p>

  <p>"That fellow's a swine," said Mr. Heritage sourly. "I wouldn't trust my
  neck in his pot-house. Now, Dogson, I'm hanged if I'm going to leave this
  place. We'll find a corner in the village somehow. Besides, I'm determined on
  tea."</p>

  <p>The little street slept in the clear pure light of an early April evening.
  Blue shadows lay on the white road, and a delicate aroma of cooking
  tantalized hungry nostrils. The near meadows shone like pale gold against the
  dark lift of the moor. A light wind had begun to blow from the west and
  carried the faintest tang of salt. The village at that hour was pure
  Paradise, and Dickson was of the Poet's opinion. At all costs they must spend
  the night there.</p>

  <p>They selected a cottage whiter and neater than the others, which stood at
  a corner, where a narrow lane turned southward. Its thatched roof had been
  lately repaired, and starched curtains of a dazzling whiteness decorated the
  small, closely-shut windows. Likewise it had a green door and a polished
  brass knocker.</p>

  <p>Tacitly the duty of envoy was entrusted to Mr. McCunn. Leaving the other
  at the gate, he advanced up the little path lined with quartz stones, and
  politely but firmly dropped the brass knocker. He must have been observed,
  for ere the noise had ceased the door opened, and an elderly woman stood
  before him. She had a sharply-cut face, the rudiments of a beard, big
  spectacles on her nose, and an old-fashioned lace cap on her smooth white
  hair. A little grim she looked at first sight, because of her thin lips and
  roman nose, but her mild curious eyes corrected the impression and gave the
  envoy confidence.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, mistress," he said, broadening his voice to something
  more rustical than his normal Glasgow speech. "Me and my friend are paying
  our first visit here, and we're terrible taken up with the place. We would
  like to bide the night, but the inn is no' taking folk. Is there any chance,
  think you, of a bed here?"</p>

  <p>"I'll no tell ye a lee," said the woman. "There's twae guid beds in the
  loft. But I dinna tak' lodgers and I dinna want to be bothered wi' ye. I'm an
  auld wumman and no' as stoot as I was. Ye'd better try doun the street. Eppie
  Home micht tak' ye."</p>

  <p>Dickson wore his most ingratiating smile. "But, mistress, Eppie Home's
  house is no' yours. We've taken a tremendous fancy to this bit. Can you no'
  manage to put up with us for the one night? We're quiet auld-fashioned folk
  and we'll no' trouble you much. Just our tea and maybe an egg to it, and a
  bowl of porridge in the morning."</p>

  <p>The woman seemed to relent. "Whaur's your freend?" she asked, peering over
  her spectacles towards the garden gate. The waiting Mr. Heritage, seeing he
  eyes moving in his direction, took off his cap with a brave gesture and
  advanced. "Glorious weather, madam," he declared.</p>

  <p>"English," whispered Dickson to the woman, in explanation.</p>

  <p>She examined the Poet's neat clothes and Mr. McCunn's homely garments, and
  apparently found them reassuring. "Come in," she said shortly. "I see ye're
  wilfu' folk and I'll hae to dae my best for ye."</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour later the two travellers, having been introduced to
  two spotless beds in the loft, and having washed luxuriously at the pump in
  the back yard, were seated in Mrs. Morran's kitchen before a meal which
  fulfilled their wildest dreams. She had been baking that morning, so there
  were white scones and barley scones, and oaten farles, and russet pancakes.
  There were three boiled eggs for each of them; there was a segment of an
  immense currant cake ("a present from my guid brither last Hogmanay"); there
  was skim milk cheese; there were several kinds of jam, and there was a pot of
  dark-gold heather honey. "Try hinny and aitcake," said their hostess. "My man
  used to say he never fund onything as guid in a' his days."</p>

  <p>Presently they heard her story. Her name was Morran, and she had been a
  widow these ten years. Of her family her son was in South Africa, one
  daughter a lady's-maid in London, and the other married to a schoolmaster in
  Kyle. The son had been in France fighting, and had come safely through. He
  had spent a month or two with her before his return, and, she feared, had
  found it dull. "There's no' a man body in the place. Naething but auld
  wives."</p>

  <p>That was what the innkeeper had told them. Mr. McCunn inquired concerning
  the inn.</p>

  <p>"There's new folk just came. What's this they ca'
  them?&mdash;Robson&mdash;Dobson&mdash;aye, Dobson. What far wad they no' tak'
  ye in? Does the man think he's a laird to refuse folk that gait?"</p>

  <p>"He said he had illness in the house."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Morran meditated. "Whae in the world can be lyin' there? The man
  bides his lane. He got a lassie frae Auchenlochan to cook, but she and her
  box gaed off in the post-cairt yestreen. I doot he tell't ye a lee, though
  it's no for me to juidge him. I've never spoken a word to ane o' thae new
  folk."</p>

  <p>Dickson inquired about the "new folk."</p>

  <p>"They're a' now come in the last three weeks, and there's no' a man o' the
  auld stock left. John Blackstocks at the Wast Lodge dee'd o' pneumony last
  back-end, and auld Simon Tappie at the Gairdens flitted to Maybole a year
  come Mairtinmas. There's naebody at the Gairdens noo, but there's a man come
  to the Wast Lodge, a blackavised body wi' a face like bend-leather. Tam
  Robison used to bide at the South Lodge, but Tam got killed about Mesopotamy,
  and his wife took the bairns to her guidsire up at the Garpleheid. I seen the
  man that's in the South Lodge gaun up the street when I was finishin' my
  denner&mdash;a shilpit body and a lameter, but he hirples as fast as ither
  folk run. He's no' bonny to look at.. I canna think what the factor's ettlin'
  at to let sic ill-faured chiels come about the toun."</p>

  <p>Their hostess was rapidly rising in Dickson's esteem. She sat very
  straight in her chair, eating with the careful gentility of a bird, and
  primming her thin lips after every mouthful of tea.</p>

  <p>"Wha bides in the Big House?" he asked. "Huntingtower is the name, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"When I was a lassie they ca'ed it Dalquharter Hoose, and Huntingtower was
  the auld rickle o' stanes at the sea-end. But naething wad serve the last
  laird's father but he maun change the name, for he was clean daft about what
  they ca' antickities. Ye speir whae bides in the Hoose? Naebody, since the
  young laird dee'd. It's standin' cauld and lanely and steikit, and it aince
  the cheeriest dwallin' in a' Carrick."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Morran's tone grew tragic. "It's a queer warld wi'out the auld
  gentry. My faither and my guidsire and his faither afore him served the
  Kennedys, and my man Dauvit Morran was gemkeeper to them, and afore I
  mairried I was ane o' the table-maids. They were kind folk, the Kennedys,
  and, like a' the rale gentry, maist mindfu' o' them that served them. Sic
  merry nichts I've seen in the auld Hoose, at Hallowe'en and Hogmanay, and at
  the servants' balls and the waddin's o' the young leddies! But the laird bode
  to waste his siller in stane and lime, and hadna that much to leave to his
  bairns. And now they're a' scattered or deid."</p>

  <p>Her grave face wore the tenderness which comes from affectionate
  reminiscence.</p>

  <p>"There was never sic a laddie as young Maister Quentin. No' a week gaed by
  but he was in here, cryin', 'Phemie Morran, I've come till my tea!' Fine he
  likit my treacle scones, puir man. There wasna ane in the countryside sae
  bauld a rider at the hunt, or sic a skeely fisher. And he was clever at his
  books tae, a graund scholar, they said, and ettlin' at bein' what they ca' a
  dipplemat, But that' a' bye wi'."</p>

  <p>"Quentin Kennedy&mdash;the fellow in the Tins?" Heritage asked. "I saw him
  in Rome when he was with the Mission."</p>

  <p>"I dinna ken. He was a brave sodger, but he wasna long fechtin' in France
  till he got a bullet in his breist. Syne we heard tell o' him in far awa'
  bits like Russia; and syne cam' the end o' the war and we lookit to see him
  back, fishin' the waters and ridin' like Jehu as in the auld days. But wae's
  me! It wasna permitted. The next news we got, the puir laddie was deid o'
  influenzy and buried somewhere about France. The wanchancy bullet maun have
  weakened his chest, nae doot. So that's the end o' the guid stock o' Kennedy
  o' Huntingtower, whae hae been great folk sin' the time o' Robert Bruce. And
  noo the Hoose is shut up till the lawyers can get somebody sae far left to
  himsel' as to tak' it on lease, and in thae dear days it's no' just onybody
  that wants a muckle castle."</p>

  <p>"Who are the lawyers?" Dickson asked.</p>

  <p>"Glendonan and Speirs in Embro. But they never look near the place, and
  Maister Loudon in Auchenlochan does the factorin'. He's let the public an'
  filled the twae lodges, and he'll be thinkin' nae doot that he's done
  eneuch."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Morran had poured some hot water into the big slop-bowl, and had
  begun the operation known as "synding out" the cups. It was a hint that the
  meal was over, and Dickson and Heritage rose from the table. Followed by an
  injunction to be back for supper "on the chap o' nine," they strolled out
  into the evening. Two hours of some sort of daylight remained, and the
  travellers had that impulse to activity which comes to all men who, after a
  day of exercise and emptiness, are stayed with a satisfying tea.</p>

  <p>"You should be happy, Dogson," said the Poet. "Here we have all the
  materials for your blessed romance&mdash;old mansion, extinct family, village
  deserted of men, and an innkeeper whom I suspect of being a villain. I feel
  almost a convert to your nonsense myself. We'll have a look at the
  House."</p>

  <p>They turned down the road which ran north by the park wall, past the inn,
  which looked more abandoned than ever, till they came to an entrance which
  was clearly the West Lodge. It had once been a pretty, modish cottage, with a
  thatched roof and dormer windows, but now it was badly in need of repair. A
  window-pane was broken and stuffed with a sack, the posts of the porch were
  giving inwards, and the thatch was crumbling under the attentions of a colony
  of starlings. The great iron gates were rusty, and on the coat of arms above
  them the gilding was patchy and tarnished. Apparently the gates were locked,
  and even the side wicket failed to open to Heritage's vigorous shaking.
  Inside a weedy drive disappeared among ragged rhododendrons.</p>

  <p>The noise brought a man to the lodge door. He was a sturdy fellow in a
  suit of black clothes which had not been made for him. He might have been a
  butler <i>en deshabill&eacute;</i>, but for the presence of a pair of field
  boots into which he had tucked the ends of his trousers. The curious thing
  about him was his face, which was decorated with features so tiny as to give
  the impression of a monstrous child. Each in itself was well enough formed,
  but eyes, nose, mouth, chin were of a smallness curiously out of proportion
  to the head and body. Such an anomaly might have been redeemed by the
  expression; good-humour would have invested it with an air of agreeable
  farce. But there was no friendliness in the man's face. It was set like a
  judge's in a stony impassiveness.</p>

  <p>"May we walk up to the House?" Heritage asked. "We are here for a night
  and should like to have a look at it."</p>

  <p>The man advanced a step. He had either a bad cold, or a voice comparable
  in size to his features.</p>

  <p>"There's no entrance here," he said huskily. "I have strict orders."</p>

  <p>"Oh, come now," said Heritage. "It can do nobody any harm if you let us in
  for half an hour."</p>

  <p>The man advanced another step.</p>

  <p>"You shall not come in. Go away from here. Go away, I tell you. It is
  private." The words spoken by the small mouth in the small voice had a kind
  of childish ferocity.</p>

  <p>The travellers turned their back on him and continued their way.</p>

  <p>"Sich a curmudgeon!" Dickson commented. His face had flushed, for he was
  susceptible to rudeness. "Did you notice? That man's a foreigner."</p>

  <p>"He's a brute," said Heritage. "But I'm not going to be done in by that
  class of lad. There can be no gates on the sea side, so we'll work round that
  way, for I won't sleep till I've seen the place."</p>

  <p>Presently the trees grew thinner, and the road plunged through thickets of
  hazel till it came to a sudden stop in a field. There the cover ceased
  wholly, and below them lay the glen of the Laver. Steep green banks descended
  to a stream which swept in coils of gold into the eye of the sunset. A little
  farther down the channel broadened, the slopes fell back a little, and a
  tongue of glittering sea ran up to meet the hill waters. The Laver is a
  gentle stream after it leaves its cradle heights, a stream of clear pools and
  long bright shallows, winding by moorland steadings and upland meadows; but
  in its last half-mile it goes mad, and imitates its childhood when it tumbled
  over granite shelves. Down in that green place the crystal water gushed and
  frolicked as if determined on one hour of rapturous life before joining the
  sedater sea.</p>

  <p>Heritage flung himself on the turf.</p>

  <p>"This is a good place! Ye gods, what a good place! Dogson, aren't you glad
  you came? I think everything's bewitched to-night. That village is bewitched,
  and that old woman's tea. Good white magic! And that foul innkeeper and that
  brigand at the gate. Black magic! And now here is the home of all
  enchantment&mdash;'island valley of Avilion'&mdash;'waters that listen for
  lovers'&mdash;all the rest of it!"</p>

  <p>Dickson observed and marvelled.</p>

  <p>"I can't make you out, Mr. Heritage. You were saying last night you were a
  great democrat, and yet you were objecting to yon laddies camping on the
  moor. And you very near bit the neb off me when I said I liked Tennyson. And
  now...  " Mr. McCunn's command of language was inadequate to describe the
  transformation.</p>

  <p>"You're a precise, pragmatical Scot," was the answer. "Hang it, man, don't
  remind me that I'm inconsistent. I've a poet's licence to play the fool, and
  if you don't understand me, I don't in the least understand myself. All I
  know is that I'm feeling young and jolly, and that it's the Spring."</p>

  <p>Mr. Heritage was assuredly in a strange mood. He began to whistle with a
  far-away look in his eye.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what that is?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>Dickson, who could not detect any tune, said "No."</p>

  <p>"It's an aria from a Russian opera that came out just before the war. I've
  forgotten the name of the fellow who wrote it. Jolly thing, isn't it? I
  always remind myself of it when I'm in this mood, for it is linked with the
  greatest experience of my life. You said, I think, that you had never been in
  love?"</p>

  <p>Dickson replied in the native fashion. "Have you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I have, and I am&mdash;been for two years. I was down with my battalion
  on the Italian front early in 1918, and because I could speak the language
  they hoicked me out and sent me to Rome on a liaison job. It was Easter time
  and fine weather, and, being glad to get out of the trenches, I was pretty
  well pleased with myself and enjoying life. In the place where I stayed there
  was a girl. She was a Russian, a princess of a great family, but a refugee,
  and of course as poor as sin. I remember how badly dressed she was among all
  the well-to-do Romans. But, my God, what a beauty! There was never anything
  in the world like her. She was little more than a child, and she used to sing
  that air in the morning as she went down the stairs. They sent me back to the
  front before I had a chance of getting to know her, but she used to give me
  little timid good mornings, and her voice and eyes were like an angel's. I'm
  over my head in love, but it's hopeless, quite hopeless. I shall never see
  her again."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I'm honoured by your confidence," said Dickson reverently.</p>

  <p>The Poet, who seemed to draw exhilaration from the memory of his sorrows,
  arose and fetched him a clout on the back. "Don't talk of confidence, as if
  you were a reporter," he said. "What about that House? If we're to see it
  before the dark comes we'd better hustle."</p>

  <p>The green slopes on their left, as they ran seaward, were clothed towards
  their summit with a tangle of broom and light scrub. The two forced their way
  through it, and found to their surprise that on this side there were no
  defences of the Huntingtower demesne. Along the crest ran a path which had
  once been gravelled and trimmed. Beyond, through a thicket of laurels and
  rhododendrons, they came on a long unkempt aisle of grass, which seemed to be
  one of those side avenues often found in connection with old Scots dwellings.
  Keeping along this they reached a grove of beech and holly through which
  showed a dim shape of masonry. By a common impulse they moved stealthily,
  crouching in cover, till at the far side of the wood they found a sunk fence
  and looked over an acre or two of what had once been lawn and flower-beds to
  the front of the mansion.</p>

  <p>The outline of the building was clearly silhouetted against the glowing
  west, but since they were looking at the east face the detail was all in
  shadow. But, dim as it was, the sight was enough to give Dickson the surprise
  of his life. He had expected something old and baronial. But this was new,
  raw and new, not twenty years built. Some madness had prompted its creator to
  set up a replica of a Tudor house in a countryside where the thing was
  unheard of. All the tricks were there&mdash;oriel windows, lozenged panes,
  high twisted chimney stacks; the very stone was red, as if to imitate the
  mellow brick of some ancient Kentish manor. It was new, but it was also
  decaying. The creepers had fallen from the walls, the pilasters on the
  terrace were tumbling down, lichen and moss were on the doorsteps. Shuttered,
  silent, abandoned, it stood like a harsh memento mori of human hopes.</p>

  <p>Dickson had never before been affected by an inanimate thing with so
  strong a sense of disquiet. He had pictured an old stone tower on a bright
  headland; he found instead this raw thing among trees. The decadence of the
  brand-new repels as something against nature, and this new thing was
  decadent. But there was a mysterious life in it, for though not a chimney
  smoked, it seemed to enshrine a personality and to wear a sinister aura. He
  felt a lively distaste, which was almost fear. He wanted to get far away from
  it as fast as possible. The sun, now sinking very low, sent up rays which
  kindled the crests of a group of firs to the left of the front door.</p>

  <p>He had the absurd fancy that they were torches flaming before a bier.</p>

  <p>It was well that the two had moved quietly and kept in shadow. Footsteps
  fell on their ears, on the path which threaded the lawn just beyond the
  sunk-fence. It was the keeper of the West Lodge and he carried something on
  his back, but both that and his face were indistinct in the half-light.</p>

  <p>Other footsteps were heard, coming from the other side of the lawn. A
  man's shod feet rang on the stone of a flagged path, and from their irregular
  fall it was plain that he was lame. The two men met near the door, and spoke
  together. Then they separated, and moved one down each side of the house. To
  the two watchers they had the air of a patrol, or of warders pacing the
  corridors of a prison.</p>

  <p>"Let's get out of this," said Dickson, and turned to go.</p>

  <p>The air had the curious stillness which precedes the moment of sunset,
  when the birds of day have stopped their noises and the sounds of night have
  not begun. But suddenly in the silence fell notes of music. They seemed to
  come from the house, a voice singing softly but with great beauty and
  clearness.</p>

  <p>Dickson halted in his steps. The tune, whatever it was, was like a fresh
  wind to blow aside his depression. The house no longer looked sepulchral. He
  saw that the two men had hurried back from their patrol, had met and
  exchanged some message, and made off again as if alarmed by the music. Then
  he noticed his companion... </p>

  <p>Heritage was on one knee with his face rapt and listening. He got to his
  feet and appeared to be about to make for the House. Dickson caught him by
  the arm and dragged him into the bushes, and he followed unresistingly, like
  a man in a dream. They ploughed through the thicket, recrossed the grass
  avenue, and scrambled down the hillside to the banks of the stream.</p>

  <p>Then for the first time Dickson observed that his companion's face was
  very white, and that sweat stood on his temples. Heritage lay down and lapped
  up water like a dog. Then he turned a wild eye on the other.</p>

  <p>"I am going back," he said. "That is the voice of the girl I saw in Rome,
  and it is singing her song!"</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref6"
     id="ref6">CHAPTER 4</a></h3>

  <h2>DOUGAL</h2>

  <p>"You'll do nothing of the kind," said Dickson. "You're coming home to your
  supper. It was to be on the chap of nine."</p>

  <p>"I'm going back to that place."</p>

  <p>The man was clearly demented and must be humoured. "Well, you must wait
  till the morn's morning. It's very near dark now, and those are two ugly
  customers wandering about yonder. You'd better sleep the night on it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Heritage seemed to be persuaded. He suffered himself to be led up the
  now dusky slopes to the gate where the road from the village ended. He walked
  listlessly like a man engaged in painful reflection. Once only he broke the
  silence.</p>

  <p>"You heard the singing?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Dickson was a very poor hand at a lie. "I heard something," he
  admitted.</p>

  <p>"You heard a girl's voice singing?"</p>

  <p>"It sounded like that," was the admission. "But I'm thinking it might have
  been a seagull."</p>

  <p>"You're a fool," said the Poet rudely.</p>

  <p>The return was a melancholy business, compared to the bright speed of the
  outward journey. Dickson's mind was a chaos of feelings, all of them
  unpleasant. He had run up against something which he violently, blindly
  detested, and the trouble was that he could not tell why. It was all
  perfectly absurd, for why on earth should an ugly house, some overgrown
  trees, and a couple of ill-favoured servants so malignly affect him? Yet this
  was the fact; he had strayed out of Arcady into a sphere that filled him with
  revolt and a nameless fear. Never in his experience had he felt like this,
  this foolish childish panic which took all the colour and zest out of life.
  He tried to laugh at himself but failed. Heritage, stumbling along by his
  side, effectually crushed his effort to discover humour in the situation.
  Some exhalation from that infernal place had driven the Poet mad. And then
  that voice singing! A seagull, he had said. More like a nightingale, he
  reflected&mdash;a bird which in the flesh he had never met.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Morran had the lamp lit and a fire burning in her cheerful kitchen.
  The sight of it somewhat restored Dickson's equanimity, and to his surprise
  he found that he had an appetite for supper. There was new milk, thick with
  cream, and most of the dainties which had appeared at tea, supplemented by a
  noble dish of shimmering "potted-head." The hostess did not share their meal,
  being engaged in some duties in the little cubby-hole known as the back
  kitchen.</p>

  <p>Heritage drank a glass of milk but would not touch food.</p>

  <p>"I called this place Paradise four hours ago," he said. "So it is, but I
  fancy it is next door to Hell. There is something devilish going on inside
  that park wall, and I mean to get to the bottom of it."</p>

  <p>"Hoots! Nonsense!" Dickson replied with affected cheerfulness. "To-morrow
  you and me will take the road for Auchenlochan. We needn't trouble ourselves
  about an ugly old house and a wheen impident lodge-keepers."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow I'm going to get inside the place. Don't come unless you like,
  but it's no use arguing with me. My mind is made up."</p>

  <p>Heritage cleared a space on the table and spread out a section of a
  large-scale Ordnance map.</p>

  <p>"I must clear my head about the topography, the same as if this were a
  battle-ground. Look here, Dogson, the road past the inn that we went by
  to-night runs north and south." He tore a page from a note-book and proceeded
  to make a rough sketch. "One end we know abuts on the Laver glen, and the
  other stops at the South Lodge. Inside the wall which follows the road is a
  long belt of plantation&mdash;mostly beeches and ash&mdash;then to the west a
  kind of park, and beyond that the lawns of the house. Strips of plantation
  with avenues between follow the north and south sides of the park. On the sea
  side of the House are the stables and what looks like a walled garden, and
  beyond them what seems to be open ground with an old dovecot marked, and the
  ruins of Huntingtower keep. Beyond that there is more open ground, till you
  come to the cliffs of the cape. Have you got that? It looks possible from the
  contouring to get on to the sea cliffs by following the Laver, for all that
  side is broken up into ravines. But look at the other side&mdash;the Garple
  glen. It's evidently a deep-cut gully, and at the bottom it opens out into a
  little harbour. There's deep water there, you observe. Now the House on the
  south side&mdash;the Garple side&mdash;is built fairly close to the edge of
  the cliffs. Is that all clear in your head? We can't reconnoitre unless we've
  got a working notion of the lie of the land."</p>

  <p>Dickson was about to protest that he had no intention of reconnoitring,
  when a hubbub arose in the back kitchen. Mrs. Morran's voice was heard in
  shrill protest.</p>

  <p>"Ye ill laddie! Eh&mdash;ye&mdash;ill&mdash;laddie! (crescendo) Makin' a
  hash o' my back door wi' your dirty feet! What are ye slinkin' roond here
  for, when I tell't ye this mornin' that I wad sell ye nae mair scones till ye
  paid for the last lot? Ye're a wheen thievin' hungry callants, and if there
  were a polisman in the place I'd gie ye in chairge. What's that ye say? Ye're
  no' wantin' meat? Ye want to speak to the gentlemen that's bidin' here? Ye
  ken the auld ane, says you? I believe it's a muckle lee, but there's the
  gentlemen to answer ye theirsels."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Morran, brandishing a dish-clout dramatically, flung open the door,
  and with a vigorous push propelled into the kitchen a singular figure.</p>

  <p>It was a stunted boy, who from his face might have been fifteen years old,
  but had the stature of a child of twelve. He had a thatch of fiery red hair
  above a pale freckled countenance. His nose was snub, his eyes a sulky
  grey-green, and his wide mouth disclosed large and damaged teeth. But
  remarkable as was his visage, his clothing was still stranger. On his head
  was the regulation Boy Scout hat, but it was several sizes too big, and was
  squashed down upon his immense red ears. He wore a very ancient khaki shirt,
  which had once belonged to a full-grown soldier, and the spacious sleeves
  were rolled up at the shoulders and tied with string, revealing a pair of
  skinny arms. Round his middle hung what was meant to be a kilt&mdash;a kilt
  of home manufacture, which may once have been a tablecloth, for its bold
  pattern suggested no known clan tartan. He had a massive belt, in which was
  stuck a broken gully-knife, and round his neck was knotted the remnant of
  what had once been a silk bandanna. His legs and feet were bare, blue,
  scratched, and very dirty, and this toes had the prehensile look common to
  monkeys and small boys who summer and winter go bootless. In his hand was a
  long ash-pole, new cut from some coppice.</p>

  <p>The apparition stood glum and lowering on the kitchen floor. As Dickson
  stared at it he recalled Mearns Street and the band of irregular Boy Scouts
  who paraded to the roll of tin cans. Before him stood Dougal, Chieftain of
  the Gorbals Die-Hards. Suddenly he remembered the philanthropic Mackintosh,
  and his own subscription of ten pounds to the camp fund. It pleased him to
  find the rascals here, for in the unpleasant affairs on the verge of which he
  felt himself they were a comforting reminder of the peace of home.</p>

  <p>"I'm glad to see you, Dougal," he said pleasantly. "How are you all
  getting on?" And then, with a vague reminiscence of the Scouts' code&mdash;
  "Have you been minding to perform a good deed every day?"</p>

  <p>The Chieftain's brow darkened.</p>

  <p>"'Good Deeds!'" he repeated bitterly. "I tell ye I'm fair wore out wi'
  good deeds. Yon man Mackintosh tell't me this was going to be a grand
  holiday. Holiday! Govey Dick! It's been like a Setterday night in Main
  Street&mdash;a' fechtin', fechtin'."</p>

  <p>No collocation of letters could reproduce Dougal's accent, and I will not
  attempt it. There was a touch of Irish in it, a spice of music-hall patter,
  as well as the odd lilt of the Glasgow vernacular. He was strong in vowels,
  but the consonants, especially the letter "t," were only aspirations.</p>

  <p>"Sit down and let's hear about things," said Dickson.</p>

  <p>The boy turned his head to the still open back door, where Mrs. Morran
  could be heard at her labours. He stepped across and shut it. "I'm no'
  wantin' that auld wife to hear," he said. Then he squatted down on the
  patchwork rug by the hearth, and warmed his blue-black shins. Looking into
  the glow of the fire, he observed, "I seen you two up by the Big Hoose the
  night."</p>

  <p>"The devil you did," said Heritage, roused to a sudden attention. "And
  where were you?"</p>

  <p>"Seven feet from your head, up a tree. It's my chief hidy-hole, and Gosh!
  I need one, for Lean's after me wi' a gun. He had a shot at me two days
  syne."</p>

  <p>Dickson exclaimed, and Dougal with morose pride showed a rent in his kilt.
  "If I had had on breeks, he'd ha' got me."</p>

  <p>"Who's Lean?" Heritage asked.</p>

  <p>"The man wi' the black coat. The other&mdash;the lame one&mdash;they ca'
  Spittal."</p>

  <p>"How d'you know?"</p>

  <p>"I've listened to them crackin' thegither."</p>

  <p>"But what for did the man want to shoot at you?" asked the scandalized
  Dickson.</p>

  <p>"What for? Because they're frightened to death o' onybody going near their
  auld Hoose. They're a pair of deevils, worse nor any Red Indian, but for a'
  that they're sweatin' wi' fright. What for? says you. Because they're hiding
  a Secret. I knew it as soon as I seen the man Lean's face. I once seen the
  same kind o' scoondrel at the Picters. When he opened his mouth to swear, I
  kenned he was a foreigner, like the lads down at the Broomielaw. That looked
  black, but I hadn't got at the worst of it. Then he loosed off at me wi' his
  gun."</p>

  <p>"Were you not feared?" said Dickson.</p>

  <p>"Ay, I was feared. But ye'll no' choke off the Gorbals Die-Hards wi' a
  gun. We held a meetin' round the camp fire, and we resolved to get to the
  bottom o' the business. Me bein' their Chief, it was my duty to make what
  they ca' a reckonissince, for that was the dangerous job. So a' this day I've
  been going on my belly about thae policies. I've found out some queer
  things."</p>

  <p>Heritage had risen and was staring down at the small squatting figure.</p>

  <p>"What have you found out? Quick. Tell me at once." His voice was sharp and
  excited.</p>

  <p>"Bide a wee," said the unwinking Dougal. "I'm no' going to let ye into
  this business till I ken that ye'll help. It's a far bigger job than I
  thought. There's more in it than Lean and Spittal. There's the big man that
  keeps the public&mdash;Dobson, they ca' him. He's a Namerican, which looks
  bad. And there's two-three tinklers campin' down in the Garple Dean. They're
  in it, for Dobson was colloguin' wi' them a' mornin'. When I seen ye, I
  thought ye were more o' the gang, till I mindit that one o' ye was auld
  McCunn that has the shop in Mearns Street. I seen that ye didna' like the
  look o' Lean, and I followed ye here, for I was thinkin' I needit help."</p>

  <p>Heritage plucked Dougal by the shoulder and lifted him to his feet.</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, boy," he cried, "tell us what you know!"</p>

  <p>"Will ye help?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, you little fool."</p>

  <p>"Then swear," said the ritualist. From a grimy wallet he extracted a limp
  little volume which proved to be a damaged copy of a work entitled <i>Sacred
  Songs and Solos</i>. "Here! Take that in your right hand and put your left
  hand on my pole, and say after me. 'I swear no' to blab what is telled me in
  secret, and to be swift and sure in obeyin' orders, s'help me God!' Syne kiss
  the bookie."</p>

  <p>Dickson at first refused, declaring that it was all havers, but Heritage's
  docility persuaded him to follow suit. The two were sworn.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Heritage.</p>

  <p>Dougal squatted again on the hearth-rug, and gathered the eyes of his
  audience. He was enjoying himself.</p>

  <p>"This day," he said slowly, "I got inside the Hoose."</p>

  <p>"Stout fellow," said Heritage; "and what did you find there?"</p>

  <p>"I got inside that Hoose, but it wasn't once or twice I tried. I found a
  corner where I was out o' sight o' anybody unless they had come there seekin'
  me, and I sklimmed up a rone pipe, but a' the windies were lockit and I verra
  near broke my neck. Syne I tried the roof, and a sore sklim I had, but when I
  got there there were no skylights. At the end I got in by the coal-hole.
  That's why ye're maybe thinkin' I'm no' very clean."</p>

  <p>Heritage's patience was nearly exhausted.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to hear how you got in. What did you find, you little
  devil?"</p>

  <p>"Inside the Hoose," said Dougal slowly (and there was a melancholy sense
  of anti-climax in his voice, as of one who had hoped to speak of gold and
  jewels and armed men)&mdash;"inside that Hoose there's nothing but two
  women."</p>

  <p>Heritage sat down before him with a stern face.</p>

  <p>"Describe them," he commanded.</p>

  <p>"One o' them is dead auld, as auld as the wife here. She didn't look to me
  very right in the head."</p>

  <p>"And the other?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, just a lassie."</p>

  <p>"What was she like?"</p>

  <p>Dougal seemed to be searching for adequate words. "She is... " he began.
  Then a popular song gave him inspiration. "She's pure as the lully in the
  dell!"</p>

  <p>In no way discomposed by Heritage's fierce interrogatory air, he
  continued: "She's either foreign or English, for she couldn't understand what
  I said, and I could make nothing o' her clippit tongue. But I could see she
  had been greetin'. She looked feared, yet kind o' determined. I speired if I
  could do anything for her, and when she got my meaning she was terrible
  anxious to ken if I had seen a man&mdash;a big man, she said, wi' a yellow
  beard. She didn't seem to ken his name, or else she wouldna' tell me. The
  auld wife was mortal feared, and was aye speakin' in a foreign langwidge. I
  seen at once that what frightened them was Lean and his friends, and I was
  just starting to speir about them when there came a sound like a man walkin'
  along the passage. She was for hidin' me in behind a sofy, but I wasn't going
  to be trapped like that, so I got out by the other door and down the kitchen
  stairs and into the coal-hole. Gosh, it was a near thing!"</p>

  <p>The boy was on his feet. "I must be off to the camp to give out the orders
  for the morn. I'm going back to that Hoose, for it's a fight atween the
  Gorbals Die-Hards and the scoondrels that are frightenin' thae women. The
  question is, Are ye comin' with me? Mind, ye've sworn. But if ye're no, I'm
  going mysel', though I'll no' deny I'd be glad o' company. You anyway&mdash;"
  he added, nodding at Heritage. "Maybe auld McCunn wouldn't get through the
  coal-hole."</p>

  <p>"You're an impident laddie,' said the outraged Dickson. "It's no' likely
  we're coming with you. Breaking into other folks' houses! It's a job for the
  police!"</p>

  <p>"Please yersel'," said the Chieftain, and looked at Heritage.</p>

  <p>"I'm on," said that gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Well, just you set out the morn as if ye were for a walk up the Garple
  glen. I'll be on the road and I'll have orders for ye."</p>

  <p>Without more ado Dougal left by way of the back kitchen. There was a brief
  denunciation from Mrs. Morran, then the outer door banged and he was
  gone.</p>

  <p>The Poet sat still with his head in his hands, while Dickson, acutely
  uneasy, prowled about the floor. He had forgotten even to light his pipe.
  "You'll not be thinking of heeding that ragamuffin boy," he ventured.</p>

  <p>"I'm certainly going to get into the House tomorrow," Heritage answered,
  "and if he can show me a way so much the better. He's a spirited youth. Do
  you breed many like him in Glasgow?"</p>

  <p>"Plenty," said Dickson sourly. "See here, Mr. Heritage. You can't expect
  me to be going about burgling houses on the word of a blagyird laddie. I'm a
  respectable man&mdash;aye been. Besides, I'm here for a holiday, and I've no
  call to be mixing myself up in strangers' affairs."</p>

  <p>"You haven't. Only you see, I think there's a friend of mine in that
  place, and anyhow there are women in trouble. If you like, we'll say goodbye
  after breakfast, and you can continue as if you had never turned aside to
  this damned peninsula. But I've got to stay."</p>

  <p>Dickson groaned. What had become of his dream of idylls, his gentle
  bookish romance? Vanished before a reality which smacked horribly of crude
  melodrama and possibly of sordid crime. His gorge rose at the picture, but a
  thought troubled him. Perhaps all romance in its hour of happening was rough
  and ugly like this, and only shone rosy in retrospect. Was he being false to
  his deepest faith?</p>

  <p>"Let's have Mrs. Morran in," he ventured. "She's a wise old body and I'd
  like to hear her opinion of this business. We'll get common sense from
  her."</p>

  <p>"I don't object," said Heritage. "But no amount of common sense will
  change my mind."</p>

  <p>Their hostess forestalled them by returning at that moment to the
  kitchen.</p>

  <p>"We want your advice, mistress," Dickson told her, and accordingly, like a
  barrister with a client, she seated herself carefully in the big easy chair,
  found and adjusted her spectacles, and waited with hands folded on her lap to
  hear the business. Dickson narrated their pre-supper doings, and gave a
  sketch of Dougal's evidence. His exposition was cautious and colourless, and
  without conviction. He seemed to expect a robust incredulity in his
  hearer.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Morran listened with the gravity of one in church. When Dickson
  finished she seemed to meditate. "There's no blagyird trick that would
  surprise me in thae new folk. What's that ye ca' them&mdash;Lean and Spittal?
  Eppie Home threepit to me they were furriners, and these are no furrin
  names."</p>

  <p>"What I want to hear from you, Mrs. Morran,' said Dickson impressively,
  "is whether you think there's anything in that boy's story?"</p>

  <p>"I think it's maist likely true. He's a terrible impident callant, but
  he's no' a leear."</p>

  <p>"Then you think that a gang of ruffians have got two lone women shut up in
  that house for their own purposes?"</p>

  <p>"I wadna wonder."</p>

  <p>"But it's ridiculous! This is a Christian and law-abiding country. What
  would the police say?"</p>

  <p>"They never troubled Dalquharter muckle. There's no' a polisman nearer
  than Knockraw&mdash;yin Johnnie Trummle, and he's as useless as a frostit
  tattie."</p>

  <p>"The wiselike thing, as I think," said Dickson, "would be to turn the
  Procurator-Fiscal on to the job. It's his business, no' ours."</p>

  <p>"Well, I wadna say but ye're richt,' said the lady.</p>

  <p>"What would you do if you were us?" Dickson's tone was subtly
  confidential. "My friend here wants to get into the House the morn with that
  red-haired laddie to satisfy himself about the facts. I say no. Let sleeping
  dogs lie, I say, and if you think the beasts are mad, report to the
  authorities. What would you do yourself?"</p>

  <p>"If I were you," came the emphatic reply, "I would tak' the first train
  hame the morn, and when I got hame I wad bide there. Ye're a dacent body, but
  ye're no' the kind to be traivellin' the roads."</p>

  <p>"And if you were me?' Heritage asked with his queer crooked smile.</p>

  <p>"If I was young and yauld like you I wad gang into the Hoose, and I wadna
  rest till I had riddled oot the truith and jyled every scoondrel about the
  place. If ye dinna gang, 'faith I'll kilt my coats and gang mysel'. I havena
  served the Kennedys for forty year no' to hae the honour o' the Hoose at my
  hert. Ye've speired my advice, sirs, and ye've gotten it. Now I maun clear
  awa' your supper."</p>

  <p>Dickson asked for a candle, and, as on the previous night, went abruptly
  to bed. The oracle of prudence to which he had appealed had betrayed him and
  counselled folly. But was it folly? For him, assuredly, for Dickson McCunn,
  late of Mearns Street, Glasgow, wholesale and retail provision merchant,
  elder in the Guthrie Memorial Kirk, and fifty-five years of age. Ay, that was
  the rub. He was getting old. The woman had seen it and had advised him to go
  home. Yet the plea was curiously irksome, though it gave him the excuse he
  needed. If you played at being young, you had to take up the obligations of
  youth, and he thought derisively of his boyish exhilaration of the past days.
  Derisively, but also sadly. What had become of that innocent joviality he had
  dreamed of, that happy morning pilgrimage of Spring enlivened by tags from
  the poets? His goddess had played him false. Romance had put upon him too
  hard a trial.</p>

  <p>He lay long awake, torn between common sense and a desire to be loyal to
  some vague whimsical standard. Heritage a yard distant appeared also to be
  sleepless, for the bed creaked with his turning. Dickson found himself
  envying one whose troubles, whatever they might be, were not those of a
  divided mind.</p><br>

     id="ref7">CHAPTER 5</a></h3>

  <h2>OF THE PRINCESS IN THE TOWER</h2>

  <p>Very early the next morning, while Mrs. Morran was still cooking
  breakfast, Dickson and Heritage might have been observed taking the air in
  the village street. It was the Poet who had insisted upon this walk, and he
  had his own purpose. They looked at the spires of smoke piercing the windless
  air, and studied the daffodils in the cottage gardens. Dickson was glum, but
  Heritage seemed in high spirits. He varied his garrulity with spells of
  cheerful whistling.</p>

  <p>They strode along the road by the park wall till they reached the inn.
  There Heritage's music waxed peculiarly loud. Presently from the yard,
  unshaven and looking as if he had slept in this clothes, came Dobson the
  innkeeper.</p>

  <p>"Good morning," said the poet. "I hope the sickness in your house is on
  the mend?"</p>

  <p>"Thank ye, it's no worse," was the reply, but in the man's heavy face
  there was little civility. His small grey eyes searched their faces.</p>

  <p>"We're just waiting for breakfast to get on the road again. I'm jolly glad
  we spent the night here. We found quarters after all, you know."</p>

  <p>"So I see. Whereabouts, may I ask?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Morran's. We could always have got in there, but we didn't want to
  fuss an old lady, so we thought we'd try the inn first. She's my friend's
  aunt."</p>

  <p>At this amazing falsehood Dickson started, and the man observed his
  surprise. The eyes were turned on him like a searchlight. They roused
  antagonism in his peaceful soul, and with that antagonism came an impulse to
  back up the Poet. "Ay," he said, "she's my auntie Phemie, my mother's
  half-sister."</p>

  <p>The man turned on Heritage.</p>

  <p>"Where are ye for the day?"</p>

  <p>"Auchenlochan," said Dickson hastily. He was still determined to shake the
  dust of Dalquharter from his feet.</p>

  <p>The innkeeper sensibly brightened. "Well, ye'll have a fine walk. I must
  go in and see about my own breakfast. Good day to ye, gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"That," said Heritage as they entered the village street again, "is the
  first step in camouflage, to put the enemy off his guard."</p>

  <p>"It was an abominable lie," said Dickson crossly.</p>

  <p>"Not at all. It was a necessary and proper <i>ruse de guerre</i>. It
  explained why we spent the right here, and now Dobson and his friends can get
  about their day's work with an easy mind. Their suspicions are temporarily
  allayed, and that will make our job easier."</p>

  <p>"I'm not coming with you."</p>

  <p>"I never said you were. By 'we' I refer to myself and the red-headed
  boy."</p>

  <p>"Mistress, you're my auntie," Dickson informed Mrs. Morran as she set the
  porridge on the table. "This gentleman has just been telling the man at the
  inn that you're my Auntie Phemie."</p>

  <p>For a second their hostess looked bewildered. Then the corners of her prim
  mouth moved upwards in a slow smile.</p>

  <p>"I see," she said. "Weel, maybe it was weel done. But if ye're my nevoy
  ye'll hae to keep up my credit, for we're a bauld and siccar lot."</p>

  <p>Half an hour later there was a furious dissension when Dickson attempted
  to pay for the night's entertainment. Mrs. Morran would have none of it.
  "Ye're no' awa' yet," she said tartly, and the matter was complicated by
  Heritage's refusal to take part in the debate. He stood aside and grinned,
  till Dickson in despair returned his notecase to his pocket, murmuring darkly
  the "he would send it from Glasgow."</p>

  <p>The road to Auchenlochan left the main village street at right angles by
  the side of Mrs. Morran's cottage. It was a better road than that by which
  they had come yesterday, for by it twice daily the postcart travelled to the
  post-town. It ran on the edge of the moor and on the lip of the Garple glen,
  till it crossed that stream and, keeping near the coast, emerged after five
  miles into the cultivated flats of the Lochan valley. The morning was fine,
  the keen air invited to high spirits, plovers piped entrancingly over the
  bent and linnets sang in the whins, there was a solid breakfast behind him,
  and the promise of a cheerful road till luncheon. The stage was set for good
  humour, but Dickson's heart, which should have been ascending with the larks,
  stuck leadenly in his boots. He was not even relieved at putting Dalquharter
  behind him. The atmosphere of that unhallowed place lay still on his soul. He
  hated it, but he hated himself more. Here was one, who had hugged himself all
  his days as an adventurer waiting his chance, running away at the first
  challenge of adventure; a lover of Romance who fled from the earliest
  overture of his goddess. He was ashamed and angry, but what else was there to
  do? Burglary in the company of a queer poet and a queerer urchin? It was
  unthinkable.</p>

  <p>Presently, as they tramped silently on, they came to the bridge beneath
  which the peaty waters of the Garple ran in porter-coloured pools and tawny
  cascades. From a clump of elders on the other side Dougal emerged. A barefoot
  boy, dressed in much the same parody of a Boy Scout's uniform, but with
  corduroy shorts instead of a kilt, stood before him at rigid attention. Some
  command was issued, the child saluted, and trotted back past the travellers
  with never a look at them. Discipline was strong among the Gorbals Die-Hards;
  no Chief of Staff ever conversed with his General under a stricter
  etiquette.</p>

  <p>Dougal received the travellers with the condescension of a regular towards
  civilians.</p>

  <p>"They're off their gawrd," he announced. Thomas Yownie has been shadowin'
  them since skreigh o' day, and he reports that Dobson and Lean followed ye
  till ye were out o' sight o' the houses, and syne Lean got a spy-glass and
  watched ye till the road turned in among the trees. That satisfied them, and
  they're both away back to their jobs. Thomas Yownie's the fell yin. Ye'll no
  fickle Thomas Yownie."</p>

  <p>Dougal extricated from his pouch the fag of a cigarette, lit it, and
  puffed meditatively. "I did a reckonissince mysel' this morning. I was up at
  the Hoose afore it was light, and tried the door o' the coal-hole. I doot
  they've gotten on our tracks, for it was lockit&mdash;aye, and wedged from
  the inside."</p>

  <p>Dickson brightened. Was the insane venture off?</p>

  <p>"For a wee bit I was fair beat. But I mindit that the lassie was allowed
  to walk in a kind o' a glass hoose on the side farthest away from the Garple.
  That was where she was singin' yest'reen. So I reckonissinced in that
  direction, and I fund a queer place." <i>Sacred Songs and Solos</i> was
  requisitioned, and on a page of it Dougal proceeded to make marks with the
  stump of a carpenter's pencil. "See here," he commanded. "There's the glass
  place wi' a door into the Hoose. That door maun be open or the lassie maun
  hae the key, for she comes there whenever she likes. Now' at each end o' the
  place the doors are lockit, but the front that looks on the garden is open,
  wi' muckle posts and flower-pots. The trouble is that that side there' maybe
  twenty feet o' a wall between the pawrapet and the ground. It's an auld wall
  wi' cracks and holes in it, and it wouldn't be ill to sklim. That's why they
  let her gang there when she wants, for a lassie couldn't get away without
  breakin' her neck."</p>

  <p>"Could we climb it?" Heritage asked.</p>

  <p>The boy wrinkled his brows. "I could manage it mysel'&mdash;I
  think&mdash;and maybe you. I doubt if auld McCunn could get up. Ye'd have to
  be mighty carefu' that nobody saw ye, for your hinder end, as ye were
  sklimmin', wad be a grand mark for a gun."</p>

  <p>"Lead on," said Heritage. "We'll try the verandah."</p>

  <p>They both looked at Dickson, and Dickson, scarlet in the face, looked back
  at them. He had suddenly found the thought of a solitary march to
  Auchenlochan intolerable. Once again he was at the parting of the ways, and
  once more caprice determined his decision. That the coal-hole was out of the
  question had worked a change in his views, Somehow it seemed to him less
  burglarious to enter by a verandah. He felt very frightened but&mdash;for the
  moment&mdash;quite resolute.</p>

  <p>"I'm coming with you," he said.</p>

  <p>"Sportsman," said Heritage, and held out his hand. "Well done, the auld
  yin," said the Chieftain of the Gorbals Die-Hards. Dickson's quaking heart
  experienced a momentary bound as he followed Heritage down the track into the
  Garple Dean.</p>

  <p>The track wound through a thick covert of hazels, now close to the rushing
  water, now high upon the bank so that clear sky showed through the fringes of
  the wood. When they had gone a little way Dougal halted them.</p>

  <p>"It's a ticklish job," he whispered. "There's the tinklers, mind, that's
  campin' in the Dean. If they're still in their camp we can get by easy
  enough, but they're maybe wanderin' about the wud after rabbits. Then we maun
  ford the water, for ye'll no' cross it lower down where it's deep. Our road
  is on the Hoose side o' the Dean, and it's awfu' public if there's onybody on
  the other side, though it's hid well enough from folk up in the policies. Ye
  maun do exactly what I tell ye. When we get near danger I'll scout on ahead,
  and I daur ye to move a hair o' your heid till I give the word."</p>

  <p>Presently, when they were at the edge of the water, Dougal announced his
  intention of crossing. Three boulders in the stream made a bridge for an
  active man, and Heritage hopped lightly over. Not so Dickson, who stuck fast
  on the second stone, and would certainly have fallen in had not Dougal
  plunged into the current and steadied him with a grimy hand. The leap was at
  last successfully taken, and the three scrambled up a rough scaur, all
  reddened with iron springs, till they struck a slender track running down the
  Dean on its northern side. Here the undergrowth was very thick, and they had
  gone the better part of half a mile before the covert thinned sufficiently to
  show them the stream beneath. Then Dougal halted them with a finger on his
  lips, and crept forward alone.</p>

  <p>He returned in three minutes. "Coast's clear," he whispered. "The tinklers
  are eatin' their breakfast. They're late at their meat though they're up
  early seekin' it."</p>

  <p>Progress was now very slow and secret, and mainly on all fours. At one
  point Dougal nodded downward, and the other two saw on a patch of turf, where
  the Garple began to widen into its estuary, a group of figures round a small
  fire. There were four of them, all men, and Dickson thought he had never seen
  such ruffianly-looking customers. After that they moved high up the slope, in
  a shallow glade of a tributary burn, till they came out of the trees and
  found themselves looking seaward.</p>

  <p>On one side was the House, a hundred yards or so back from the edge, the
  roof showing above the precipitous scarp. Half-way down the slope became
  easier, a jumble of boulders and boiler-plates, till it reached the waters of
  the small haven, which lay calm as a mill-pond in the windless forenoon. The
  haven broadened out at its foot and revealed a segment of blue sea. The
  opposite shore was flatter, and showed what looked like an old wharf and the
  ruins of buildings, behind which rose a bank clad with scrub and surmounted
  by some gnarled and wind-crooked firs.</p>

  <p>"There's dashed little cover here," said Heritage.</p>

  <p>"There's no muckle," Dougal assented. "But they canna see us from the
  policies, and it's no' like there's anybody watchin' from the Hoose. The
  danger is somebody on the other side, but we'll have to risk it. Once among
  thae big stones we're safe. Are ye ready?"</p>

  <p>Five minutes later Dickson found himself gasping in the lee of a boulder,
  while Dougal was making a cast forward. The scout returned with a hopeful
  report. "I think we're safe till we get into the policies. There's a road
  that the auld folk made when ships used to come here. Down there it's deeper
  than Clyde at the Broomielaw. Has the auld yin got his wind yet? There's no
  time to waste."</p>

  <p>Up that broken hillside they crawled, well in the cover of the tumbled
  stones, till they reached a low wall which was the boundary of the garden.
  The House was now behind them on their right rear, and as they topped the
  crest they had a glimpse of an ancient dovecot and the ruins of the old
  Huntingtower on the short thymy turf which ran seaward to the cliffs. Dougal
  led them along a sunk fence which divided the downs from the lawns behind the
  house, and, avoiding the stables, brought them by devious ways to a thicket
  of rhododendrons and broom. On all fours they travelled the length of the
  place, and came to the edge where some forgotten gardeners had once tended a
  herbaceous border. The border was now rank and wild, and, lying flat under
  the shade of an azalea, and peering through the young spears of iris, Dickson
  and Heritage regarded the north-western facade of the house.</p>

  <p>The ground before them had been a sunken garden, from which a steep wall,
  once covered with creepers and rock plants, rose to a long verandah, which
  was pillared and open on that side; but at each end built up half-way and
  glazed for the rest. There was a glass roof, and inside untended shrubs
  sprawled in broken plaster vases.</p>

  <p>"Ye maun bide here," said Dougal, "and no cheep above your breath. Afore
  we dare to try that wall, I maun ken where Lean and Spittal and Dobson are.
  I'm off to spy the policies.' He glided out of sight behind a clump of pampas
  grass.</p>

  <p>For hours, so it seemed, Dickson was left to his own unpleasant
  reflections. His body, prone on the moist earth, was fairly comfortable, but
  his mind was ill at ease. The scramble up the hillside had convinced him that
  he was growing old, and there was no rebound in his soul to counter the
  conviction. He felt listless, spiritless&mdash;an apathy with fright
  trembling somewhere at the back of it. He regarded the verandah wall with
  foreboding. How on earth could he climb that? And if he did there would be
  his exposed hinder-parts inviting a shot from some malevolent gentleman among
  the trees. He reflected that he would give a large sum of money to be out of
  this preposterous adventure.</p>

  <p>Heritage's hand was stretched towards him, containing two of Mrs. Morran's
  jellied scones, of which the Poet had been wise enough to bring a supply in
  his pocket. The food cheered him, for he was growing very hungry, and he
  began to take an interest in the scene before him instead of his own
  thoughts. He observed every detail of the verandah. There was a door at one
  end, he noted, giving on a path which wound down to the sunk garden. As he
  looked he heard a sound of steps and saw a man ascending this path.</p>

  <p>It was the lame man whom Dougal had called Spittal, the dweller in the
  South Lodge. Seen at closer quarters he was an odd-looking being, lean as a
  heron, wry-necked, but amazingly quick on his feet. Had not Mrs. Morran said
  that he hobbled as fast as other folk ran? He kept his eyes on the ground and
  seemed to be talking to himself as he went, but he was alert enough, for the
  dropping of a twig from a dying magnolia transferred him in an instant into a
  figure of active vigilance. No risks could be run with that watcher. He took
  a key from his pocket, opened the garden door and entered the verandah. For a
  moment his shuffle sounded on its tiled floor, and then he entered the door
  admitting from the verandah to the House. It was clearly unlocked, for there
  came no sound of a turning key.</p>

  <p>Dickson had finished the last crumbs of his scones before the man emerged
  again. He seemed to be in a greater hurry than ever as he locked the garden
  door behind him and hobbled along the west front of the House till he was
  lost to sight. After that the time passed slowly. A pair of yellow wagtails
  arrived and played at hide-and-seek among the stuccoed pillars. The little
  dry scratch of their claws was heard clearly in the still air. Dickson had
  almost fallen asleep when a smothered exclamation from Heritage woke him to
  attention. A girl had appeared in the verandah.</p>

  <p>Above the parapet he saw only her body from the waist up. She seemed to be
  clad in bright colours, for something red was round her shoulders and her
  hair was bound with an orange scarf. She was tall&mdash;that he could tell,
  tall and slim and very young. Her face was turned seaward, and she stood for
  a little scanning the broad channel, shading her eyes as if to search for
  something on the extreme horizon. The air was very quiet and he thought that
  he could hear her sigh. Then she turned and re-entered the House, while
  Heritage by his side began to curse under his breathe with a shocking
  fervour.</p>

  <p>One of Dickson's troubles had been that he did not believe Dougal's story,
  and the sight of the girl removed one doubt. That bright exotic thing did not
  belong to the Cruives or to Scotland at all, and that she should be in the
  House removed the place from the conventional dwelling to which the laws
  against burglary applied.</p>

  <p>There was a rustle among the rhododendrons and the fiery face of Dougal
  appeared. He lay between the other two, his chin on his hands, and grunted
  out his report.</p>

  <p>"After they had their dinner Dobson and Lean yokit a horse and went off to
  Auchenlochan. I seen them pass the Garple brig, so that's two accounted for.
  Has Spittal been round here?"</p>

  <p>"Half an hour ago," said Heritage, consulting a wrist watch.</p>

  <p>"It was him that keepit me waitin' so long. But he's safe enough now, for
  five minutes syne he was splittin' firewood at the back door o' his hoose.
  I've found a ladder, an auld yin in yon lot o' bushes. It'll help wi' the
  wall. There! I've gotten my breath again and we can start."</p>

  <p>The ladder was fetched by Heritage and proved to be ancient and wanting
  many rungs, but sufficient in length. The three stood silent for a moment,
  listening like stags, and then ran across the intervening lawn to the foot of
  the verandah wall. Dougal went up first, then Heritage, and lastly Dickson,
  stiff and giddy from his long lie under the bushes. Below the parapet the
  verandah floor was heaped with old garden litter, rotten matting, dead or
  derelict bulbs, fibre, withies, and strawberry nets. It was Dougal's
  intention to pull up the ladder and hide it among the rubbish against the
  hour of departure. But Dickson had barely put his foot on the parapet when
  there was a sound of steps within the House approaching the verandah
  door.</p>

  <p>The ladder was left alone. Dougal's hand brought Dickson summarily to the
  floor, where he was fairly well concealed by a mess of matting. Unfortunately
  his head was in the vicinity of some upturned pot-plants, so that a cactus
  ticked his brow and a spike of aloe supported painfully the back of his neck.
  Heritage was prone behind two old water-butts, and Dougal was in a hamper
  which had once contained seed potatoes. The house door had panels of opaque
  glass, so the new-comer could not see the doings of the three till it was
  opened, and by that time all were in cover.</p>

  <p>The man&mdash;it was Spittal&mdash;walked rapidly along the verandah and
  out of the garden door. He was talking to himself again, and Dickson, who had
  a glimpse of his face, thought he looked both evil and furious. Then came
  some anxious moments, for had the man glanced back when he was once outside,
  he must have seen the tell-tale ladder. But he seemed immersed in his own
  reflections, for he hobbled steadily along the house front till he was lost
  to sight.</p>

  <p>"That'll be the end o' them the day," said Dougal, as he helped Heritage
  to pull up the ladder and stow it away. "We've got the place to oursels, now.
  Forward, men, forward." He tried the handle of the House door and led the way
  in.</p>

  <p>A narrow paved passage took them into what had once been the garden room,
  where the lady of the house had arranged her flowers, and the tennis racquets
  and croquet mallets had been kept. It was very dusty, and on the cobwebbed
  walls still hung a few soiled garden overalls. A door beyond opened into a
  huge murky hall, murky, for the windows were shuttered, and the only light
  came through things like port-holes far up in the wall. Dougal, who seemed to
  know his way about, halted them. "Stop here till I scout a bit. The women
  bide in a wee room through that muckle door." Bare feet stole across the oak
  flooring, there was the sound of a door swinging on its hinges, and then
  silence and darkness. Dickson put out a hand for companionship and clutched
  Heritage's; to his surprise it was cold and all a-tremble. They listened for
  voices, and thought they could detect a far-away sob.</p>

  <p>It was some minutes before Dougal returned. "A bonny kettle o' fish," he
  whispered. "They're both greetin'. We're just in time. Come on, the pair o'
  ye."</p>

  <p>Through a green baize door they entered a passage which led to the kitchen
  regions, and turned in at the first door on their right. From its situation
  Dickson calculated that the room lay on the seaward side of the House next to
  the verandah. The light was bad, for the two windows were partially
  shuttered, but it had plainly been a smoking-room, for there were pipe-racks
  by the hearth, and on the walls a number of old school and college
  photographs, a couple of oars with emblazoned names, and a variety of stags'
  and roebucks' heads. There was no fire in the grate, but a small oil-stove
  burned inside the fender. In a stiff-backed chair sat an elderly woman, who
  seemed to feel the cold, for she was muffled to the neck in a fur coat.
  Beside her, so that the late afternoon light caught her face and head, stood
  a girl.</p>

  <p>Dickson's first impression was of a tall child. The pose, startled and
  wild and yet curiously stiff and self-conscious, was that of a child striving
  to remember a forgotten lesson. One hand clutched a handkerchief, the other
  was closing and unclosing on a knob of the chair back. She was staring at
  Dougal, who stood like a gnome in the centre of the floor. "Here's the
  gentlemen I was tellin' ye about," was his introduction, but her eyes did not
  move.</p>

  <p>Then Heritage stepped forward. "We have met before, Mademoiselle," he
  said. "Do you remember Easter in 1918&mdash;in the house in the Trinita dei
  Monte?"</p>

  <p>The girl looked at him.</p>

  <p>"I do not remember," she said slowly.</p>

  <p>"But I was the English officer who had the apartments on the floor below
  you. I saw you every morning. You spoke to me sometimes."</p>

  <p>"You are a soldier?" she asked, with a new note in her voice.</p>

  <p>"I was then&mdash;till the war finished."</p>

  <p>"And now? Why have you come here?"</p>

  <p>"To offer you help if you need it. If not, to ask your pardon and go
  away."</p>

  <p>The shrouded figure in the chair burst suddenly into rapid hysterical talk
  in some foreign tongue which Dickson suspected of being French. Heritage
  replied in the same language, and the girl joined in with sharp questions.
  Then the Poet turned to Dickson.</p>

  <p>"This is my friend. If you will trust us we will do our best to help
  you."</p>

  <p>The eyes rested on Dickson's face, and he realized that he was in the
  presence of something the like of which he had never met in his life before.
  It was a loveliness greater than he had imagined was permitted by the
  Almighty to His creatures. The little face was more square than oval, with a
  low broad brow and proud exquisite eyebrows. The eyes were of a colour which
  he could never decide on; afterwards he used to allege obscurely that they
  were the colour of everything in Spring. There was a delicate pallor in the
  cheeks, and the face bore signs of suffering and care, possibly even of
  hunger; but for all that there was youth there, eternal and triumphant! Not
  youth such as he had known it, but youth with all history behind it, youth
  with centuries of command in its blood and the world's treasures of beauty
  and pride in its ancestry. Strange, he thought, that a thing so fine should
  be so masterful. He felt abashed in every inch of him.</p>

  <p>As the eyes rested on him their sorrowfulness seemed to be shot with
  humour. A ghost of a smile lurked there, to which Dickson promptly responded.
  He grinned and bowed.</p>

  <p>"Very pleased to meet you, Mem. I'm Mr. McCunn from Glasgow."</p>

  <p>"You don't even know my name," she said.</p>

  <p>"We don't," said Heritage.</p>

  <p>"They call me Saskia. This," nodding to the chair, "is my cousin Eugenie
 ...  We are in very great trouble. But why should I tell you? I do not know
  you. You cannot help me."</p>

  <p>"We can try," said Heritage. "Part of your trouble we know already through
  that boy. You are imprisoned in this place by scoundrels. We are here to help
  you to get out. We want to ask no questions&mdash;only to do what you bid
  us."</p>

  <p>"You are not strong enough," she said sadly. "A young man&mdash;an old
  man&mdash;and a little boy. There are many against us, and any moment there
  may be more."</p>

  <p>It was Dougal's turn to break in, "There's Lean and Spittal and Dobson and
  four tinklers in the Dean&mdash;that's seven; but there's us three and five
  more Gorbals Die-hards&mdash;that's eight."</p>

  <p>There was something in the boy's truculent courage that cheered her.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," she said, and her eyes fell on each in turn.</p>

  <p>Dickson felt impelled to intervene.</p>

  <p>"I think this is a perfectly simple business. Here's a lady shut up in
  this house against her will by a wheen blagyirds. This is a free country and
  the law doesn't permit that. My advice is for one of us to inform the police
  at Auchenlochan and get Dobson and his friends took up and the lady set free
  to do what she likes. That is, if these folks are really molesting her, which
  is not yet quite clear to my mind."</p>

  <p>"Alas! It is not so simple as that," she said. "I dare not invoke your
  English law, for perhaps in the eyes of that law I am a thief."</p>

  <p>"Deary me, that's a bad business," said the startled Dickson.</p>

  <p>The two women talked together in some strange tongue, and the elder
  appeared to be pleading and the younger objecting. Then Saskia seemed to come
  to a decision.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you all," and she looked straight at Heritage. "I do not
  think you would be cruel or false, for you have honourable faces...  Listen,
  then. I am a Russian, and for two years have been an exile. I will not now
  speak of my house, for it is no more, or how I escaped, for it is the common
  tale of all of us. I have seen things more terrible than any dream and yet
  lived, but I have paid a price for such experience. First I went to Italy
  where there were friends, and I wished only to have peace among kindly
  people. About poverty I do not care, for, to us, who have lost all the great
  things, the want of bread is a little matter. But peace was forbidden me, for
  I learned that we Russians had to win back our fatherland again, and that the
  weakest must work in that cause. So I was set my task, and it was very hard
 ...  There were others still hidden in Russia which must be brought to a safe
  place. In that work I was ordered to share."</p>

  <p>She spoke in almost perfect English, with a certain foreign precision.
  Suddenly she changed to French, and talked rapidly to Heritage.</p>

  <p>"She has told me about her family," he said, turning to Dickson. "It is
  among the greatest in Russia, the very greatest after the throne." Dickson
  could only stare.</p>

  <p>"Our enemies soon discovered me," she went on. "Oh, but they are very
  clever, these enemies, and they have all the criminals of the world to aid
  them. Here you do not understand what they are. You good people in England
  think they are well-meaning dreamers who are forced into violence by the
  persecution of Western Europe. But you are wrong. Some honest fools there are
  among them, but the power&mdash;the true power&mdash;lies with madmen and
  degenerates, and they have for allies the special devil that dwells in each
  country. That is why they cast their nets as wide as mankind."</p>

  <p>She shivered, and for a second her face wore a look which Dickson never
  forgot, the look of one who has looked over the edge of life into the outer
  dark.</p>

  <p>"There were certain jewels of great price which were about to be turned
  into guns and armies for our enemies. These our people recovered, and the
  charge of them was laid on me. Who would suspect, they said, a foolish girl?
  But our enemies were very clever, and soon the hunt was cried against me.
  They tried to rob me of them, but they failed, for I too had become clever.
  Then they asked for the help of the law&mdash;first in Italy and then in
  France. Ah, it was subtly done. Respectable bourgeois, who hated the
  Bolsheviki but had bought long ago the bonds of my country, desired to be
  repaid their debts out of the property of the Russian crown which might be
  found in the West. But behind them were the Jews, and behind the Jews our
  unsleeping enemies. Once I was enmeshed in the law I would be safe for them,
  and presently they would find the hiding-place of the treasure, and while the
  bourgeois were clamouring in the courts it would be safe in their pockets. So
  I fled. For months I have been fleeing and hiding. They have tried to kidnap
  me many times, and once they have tried to kill me, but I, too, have become
  clever&mdash;oh, so clever. And I have learned not to fear."</p>

  <p>This simple recital affected Dickson's honest soul with the liveliest
  indignation. "Sich doings!" he exclaimed, and he could not forbear from
  whispering to Heritage an extract from that gentleman's conversation the
  first night at Kirkmichael. "We needn't imitate all their methods, but
  they've got hold of the right end of the stick. They seek truth and reality."
  The reply from the Poet was an angry shrug.</p>

  <p>"Why and how did you come here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I always meant to come to England, for I thought it the sanest place in a
  mad world. Also it is a good country to hide in, for it is apart from Europe,
  and your police, as I thought, do not permit evil men to be their own law.
  But especially I had a friend, a Scottish gentleman, whom I knew in the days
  when we Russians were still a nation. I saw him again in Italy, and since he
  was kind and brave I told him some part of my troubles. He was called Quentin
  Kennedy, and now he is dead. He told me that in Scotland he had a lonely
  ch&acirc;teau, where I could hide secretly and safely, and against the day
  when I might be hard-pressed he gave me a letter to his steward, bidding him
  welcome me as a guest when I made application. At that time I did not think I
  would need such sanctuary, but a month ago the need became urgent, for the
  hunt in France was very close on me. So I sent a message to the steward as
  Captain Kennedy told me."</p>

  <p>"What is his name?" Heritage asked.</p>

  <p>She spelt it, "Monsieur Loudon&mdash;L-O-U-D-O-N in the town of
  Auchenlochan."</p>

  <p>"The factor," said Dickson, "And what then?"</p>

  <p>"Some spy must have found me out. I had a letter from this Loudon bidding
  me come to Auchenlochan. There I found no steward to receive me, but another
  letter saying that that night a carriage would be in waiting to bring me
  here. It was midnight when we arrived, and we were brought in by strange ways
  to this house, with no light but a single candle. Here we were welcomed
  indeed, but by an enemy."</p>

  <p>"Which?" asked Heritage. "Dobson or Lean or Spittal?"</p>

  <p>"Dobson I do not know. Leon was there. He is no Russian, but a Belgian who
  was a valet in my father's service till he joined the Bolsheviki. Next day
  the Lett Spidel came, and I knew that I was in very truth entrapped. For of
  all our enemies he is, save one, the most subtle and unwearied."</p>

  <p>Her voice had trailed off into flat weariness. Again Dickson was reminded
  of a child, for her arms hung limp by her side; and her slim figure in its
  odd clothes was curiously like that of a boy in a school blazer. Another
  resemblance perplexed him. She had a hint of Janet&mdash;about the
  mouth&mdash;Janet, that solemn little girl those twenty years in her
  grave.</p>

  <p>Heritage was wrinkling his brows. "I don't think I quite understand. The
  jewels? You have them with you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"These men wanted to rob you. Why didn't they do it between here and
  Auchenlochan? You had no chance to hide them on the journey. Why did they let
  you come here where you were in a better position to baffle them?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "I cannot explain&mdash;except, perhaps, that Spidel
  had not arrived that night, and Leon may have been waiting instructions."</p>

  <p>The other still looked dissatisfied. "They are either clumsier villains
  than I take them to be, or there is something deeper in the business than we
  understand. These jewels&mdash;are they here?"</p>

  <p>His tone was so sharp that she looked startled&mdash;almost suspicious.
  Then she saw that in his face which reassured her. "I have them hidden here.
  I have grown very skilful in hiding things."</p>

  <p>"Have they searched for them?"</p>

  <p>"The first day they demanded them of me. I denied all knowledge. Then they
  ransacked this house&mdash;I think they ransack it daily, but I am too clever
  for them. I am not allowed to go beyond the verandah, and when at first I
  disobeyed there was always one of them in wait to force me back with a pistol
  behind my head. Every morning Leon brings us food for the day&mdash;good
  food, but not enough, so that Cousin Eugenie is always hungry, and each day
  he and Spidel question and threaten me. This afternoon Spidel has told me
  that their patience is at an end. He has given me till tomorrow at noon to
  produce the jewels. If not, he says I will die."</p>

  <p>"Mercy on us!" Dickson exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"There will be no mercy for us," she said solemnly. "He and his kind think
  as little of shedding blood as of spilling water. But I do not think he will
  kill me. I think I will kill him first, but after that I shall surely die. As
  for Cousin Eugenie, I do not know."</p>

  <p>Her level matter-of-fact tone seemed to Dickson most shocking, for he
  could not treat it as mere melodrama. It carried a horrid conviction. "We
  must get you out of this at once," he declared.</p>

  <p>"I cannot leave. I will tell you why. When I came to this country I
  appointed one to meet me here. He is a kinsman who knows England well, for he
  fought in your army. With him by my side I have no fear. It is altogether
  needful that I wait for him."</p>

  <p>"Then there is something more which you haven't told us?" Heritage
  asked.</p>

  <p>Was there the faintest shadow of a blush on her cheek? "There is something
  more," she said.</p>

  <p>She spoke to Heritage in French, and Dickson caught the name "Alexis" and
  a word which sounded like "prance." The Poet listened eagerly and nodded. "I
  have heard of him," he said.</p>

  <p>"But have you not seen him? A tall man with a yellow beard, who bears
  himself proudly. Being of my mother's race he has eyes like mine."</p>

  <p>"That's the man she was askin' me about yesterday," said Dougal, who had
  squatted on the floor.</p>

  <p>Heritage shook his head. "We only came here last night. When did you
  expect Prince&mdash;your friend."</p>

  <p>"I hoped to find him here before me. Oh, it is his not coming that
  terrifies me. I must wait and hope. But if he does not come in time another
  may come before him."</p>

  <p>"The ones already here are not all the enemies that threaten you?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed, no. The worst has still to come, and till I know he is here I do
  not greatly fear Spidel or Leon. They receive orders and do not give
  them."</p>

  <p>Heritage ran a perplexed hand through his hair. The sunset which had been
  flaming for some time in the unshuttered panes was now passing into the dark.
  The girl lit a lamp after first shuttering the rest of the windows. As she
  turned up the wick the odd dusty room and its strange company were revealed
  more clearly, and Dickson saw with a shock how haggard was the beautiful
  face. A great pity seized him and almost conquered his timidity.</p>

  <p>"It is very difficult to help you," Heritage was saying. "You won't leave
  this place, and you won't claim the protection of the law. You are very
  independent, Mademoiselle, but it can't go on for ever. The man you fear may
  arrive at any moment. At any moment, too, your treasure may by
  discovered."</p>

  <p>"It is that that weighs on me," she cried. "The jewels! They are my solemn
  trust, but they burden me terribly. If I were only rid of them and knew them
  to be safe I should face the rest with a braver mind."</p>

  <p>"If you'll take my advice," said Dickson slowly, "you'll get them
  deposited in a bank and take a receipt for them. A Scotch bank is no' in a
  hurry to surrender a deposit without it gets the proper authority."</p>

  <p>Heritage brought his hands together with a smack. "That's an idea. Will
  you trust us to take these things and deposit them safely?"</p>

  <p>For a little she was silent and her eyes were fixed on each of the trio in
  turn. "I will trust you," she said at last. "I think you will not betray
  me."</p>

  <p>"By God, we won't!" said the Poet fervently. "Dogson, it's up to you. You
  march off to Glasgow in double quick time and place the stuff in your own
  name in your own bank. There's not a moment to lose. D'you hear?"</p>

  <p>"I will that." To his own surprise Dickson spoke without hesitation.
  Partly it was because of his merchant's sense of property, which made him
  hate the thought that miscreants should acquire that to which they had no
  title; but mainly it was the appeal in those haggard childish eyes. "But I'm
  not going to be tramping the country in the night carrying a fortune and
  seeking for trains that aren't there. I'll go the first thing in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>"Where are they?" Heritage asked.</p>

  <p>"That I do not tell. But I will fetch them."</p>

  <p>She left the room, and presently returned with three odd little parcels
  wrapped in leather and tied with thongs of raw hide. She gave them to
  Heritage, who held them appraisingly in his hand and then passed them on to
  Dickson.</p>

  <p>"I do not ask about their contents. We take them from you as they are,
  and, please God, when the moment comes they will be returned to you as you
  gave them. You trust us, Mademoiselle?"</p>

  <p>"I trust you, for you are a soldier. Oh, and I thank you from my heart, my
  friends." She held out a hand to each, which caused Heritage to grow suddenly
  very red.</p>

  <p>"I will remain in the neighbourhood to await developments," he said. "We
  had better leave you now. Dougal, lead on."</p>

  <p>Before going, he took the girl's hand again, and with a sudden movement
  bent and kissed it. Dickson shook it heartily. "Cheer up, Mem," he observed.
  "There's a better time coming." His last recollection of her eyes was of a
  soft mistiness not far from tears. His pouch and pipe had strange company
  jostling them in his pocket as he followed the others down the ladder into
  the night.</p>

  <p>Dougal insisted that they must return by the road of the morning. "We
  daren't go by the Laver, for that would bring us by the public-house. If the
  worst comes to the worst, and we fall in wi' any of the deevils, they must
  think ye've changed your mind and come back from Auchenlochan."</p>

  <p>The night smelt fresh and moist as if a break in the weather were
  imminent. As they scrambled along the Garple Dean a pinprick of light below
  showed where the tinklers were busy by their fire. Dickson's spirits suffered
  a sharp fall and he began to marvel at his temerity. What in Heaven's name
  had he undertaken? To carry very precious things, to which certainly he had
  no right, through the enemy to distant Glasgow. How could he escape the
  notice of the watchers? He was already suspect, and the sight of him back
  again in Dalquharter would double that suspicion. He must brazen it out, but
  he distrusted his powers with such tell-tale stuff in his pockets. They might
  murder him anywhere on the moor road or in an empty railway carriage. An
  unpleasant memory of various novels he had read in which such things happened
  haunted his mind...  There was just one consolation. This job over, he would
  be quit of the whole business. And honourably quit, too, for he would have
  played a manly part in a most unpleasant affair. He could retire to the
  idyllic with the knowledge that he had not been wanting when Romance called.
  Not a soul should ever hear of it, but he saw himself in the future tramping
  green roads or sitting by his winter fireside pleasantly retelling himself
  the tale.</p>

  <p>Before they came to the Garple bridge Dougal insisted that they should
  separate, remarking that "it would never do if we were seen thegither."
  Heritage was despatched by a short cut over fields to the left, which
  eventually, after one or two plunges into ditches, landed him safely in Mrs.
  Morran's back yard. Dickson and Dougal crossed the bridge and tramped
  Dalquharter-wards by the highway. There was no sign of human life in that
  quiet place with owls hooting and rabbits rustling in the undergrowth. Beyond
  the woods they came in sight of the light in the back kitchen, and both
  seemed to relax their watchfulness when it was most needed. Dougal sniffed
  the air and looked seaward.</p>

  <p>"It's coming on to rain," he observed. "There should be a muckle star
  there, and when you can't see it it means wet weather wi' this wind."</p>

  <p>"What star?" Dickson asked.</p>

  <p>"The one wi' the Irish-lukkin' name. What's that they call it? O'Brien?"
  And he pointed to where the constellation of the hunter should have been
  declining on the western horizon.</p>

  <p>There was a bend of the road behind them, and suddenly round it came a
  dogcart driven rapidly. Dougal slipped like a weasel into a bush, and
  presently Dickson stood revealed in the glare of a lamp. The horse was pulled
  up sharply and the driver called out to him. He saw that it was Dobson the
  innkeeper with Leon beside him.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" cried the voice. "Oh, you! I thought ye were off the
  day?"</p>

  <p>Dickson rose nobly to the occasion.</p>

  <p>"I thought myself I was. But I didn't think much of Auchenlochan, and I
  took a fancy to come back and spend the last night of my holiday with my
  Auntie. I'm off to Glasgow first thing the morn's morn."</p>

  <p>"So!" said the voice. "Queer thing I never saw ye on the Auchenlochan
  road, where ye can see three mile before ye."</p>

  <p>"I left early and took it easy along the shore."</p>

  <p>"Did ye so? Well, good-sight to ye."</p>

  <p>Five minutes later Dickson walked into Mrs. Morran's kitchen, where
  Heritage was busy making up for a day of short provender.</p>

  <p>"I'm for Glasgow to-morrow, Auntie Phemie," he cried. "I want you to loan
  me a wee trunk with a key, and steek the door and windows, for I've a lot to
  tell you."</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref8"
     id="ref8">CHAPTER 6</a></h3>

  <h2>HOW MR. MCCUNN DEPARTED WITH RELIEF<br>
  AND RETURNED WITH RESOLUTION</h2>

  <p>At seven o'clock on the following morning the post-cart, summoned by an
  early message from Mrs. Morran, appeared outside the cottage. In it sat the
  ancient postman, whose real home was Auchenlochan, but who slept alternate
  nights in Dalquharter, and beside him Dobson the innkeeper. Dickson and his
  hostess stood at the garden-gate, the former with his pack on his back, and
  at his feet a small stout wooden box, of the kind in which cheeses are
  transported, garnished with an immense padlock. Heritage for obvious reasons
  did not appear; at the moment he was crouched on the floor of the loft
  watching the departure through a gap in the dimity curtains.</p>

  <p>The traveller, after making sure that Dobson was looking, furtively
  slipped the key of the trunk into his knapsack.</p>

  <p>"Well, good-bye, Auntie Phemie," he said. "I'm sure you've been awful kind
  to me, and I don't know how to thank you for all you're sending."</p>

  <p>"Tuts, Dickson, my man, they're hungry folk about Glesca that'll be glad
  o' my scones and jeelie. Tell Mirren I'm rale pleased wi' her man, and haste
  ye back soon."</p>

  <p>The trunk was deposited on the floor of the cart, and Dickson clambered
  into the back seat. He was thankful that he had not to sit next to Dobson,
  for he had tell-tale stuff on his person. The morning was wet, so he wore his
  waterproof, which concealed his odd tendency to stoutness about the
  middle.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Morran played her part well, with all the becoming gravity of an
  affectionate aunt, but as soon as the post-cart turned the bend of the road
  her demeanour changed. She was torn with convulsions of silent laughter. She
  retreated to the kitchen, sank into a chair, wrapped her face in her apron
  and rocked. Heritage, descending, found her struggling to regain composure.
  "D'ye ken his wife's name?" she gasped. "I ca'ed her Mirren! And maybe the
  body's no' mairried! Hech sirs! Hech sirs!"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Dickson was bumping along the moor-road on the back of the
  post-cart. He had worked out a plan, just as he had been used aforetime to
  devise a deal in foodstuffs. He had expected one of the watchers to turn up,
  and was rather relieved that it should be Dobson, whom he regarded as "the
  most natural beast" of the three. Somehow he did not think that he would be
  molested before he reached the station, since his enemies would still be
  undecided in their minds. Probably they only wanted to make sure that he had
  really departed to forget all about him. But if not, he had his plan
  ready.</p>

  <p>"Are you travelling to-day?" he asked the innkeeper.</p>

  <p>"Just as far as the station to see about some oil-cake I'm expectin'.
  What's in your wee kist? Ye came here wi' nothing but the bag on your
  back."</p>

  <p>"Ay, the kist is no' mine. It's my auntie's. She's a kind body, and
  nothing would serve but she must pack a box for me to take back. Let me see.
  There's a baking of scones; three pots of honey and one of rhubarb
  jam&mdash;she was aye famous for her rhubarb jam; a mutton ham, which you
  can't get for love or money in Glasgow; some home-made black puddings, and a
  wee skim-milk cheese. I doubt I'll have to take a cab from the station."</p>

  <p>Dobson appeared satisfied, lit a short pipe, and relapsed into meditation.
  The long uphill road, ever climbing to where far off showed the tiny
  whitewashed buildings which were the railway station, seemed interminable
  this morning. The aged postman addressed strange objurgations to his aged
  horse and muttered reflections to himself, the innkeeper smoked, and Dickson
  stared back into the misty hollow where lay Dalquharter. The south-west wind
  had brought up a screen of rain clouds and washed all the countryside in a
  soft wet grey. But the eye could still travel a fair distance, and Dickson
  thought he had a glimpse of a figure on a bicycle leaving the village two
  miles back. He wondered who it could be. Not Heritage, who had no bicycle.
  Perhaps some woman who was conspicuously late for the train. Women were the
  chief cyclists nowadays in country places.</p>

  <p>Then he forgot about the bicycle and twisted his neck to watch the
  station. It was less than a mile off now, and they had no time to spare, for
  away to the south among the hummocks of the bog he saw the smoke of the train
  coming from Auchenlochan. The postman also saw it and whipped up his beast
  into a clumsy canter. Dickson, always nervous being late for trains, forced
  his eyes away and regarded again the road behind him. Suddenly the cyclist
  had become quite plain&mdash;a little more than a mile behind&mdash;a man,
  and pedalling furiously in spite of the stiff ascent. It could only be one
  person&mdash;Leon. He must have discovered their visit to the House yesterday
  and be on the way to warn Dobson. If he reached the station before the train,
  there would be no journey to Glasgow that day for one respectable
  citizen.</p>

  <p>Dickson was in a fever of impatience and fright. He dared not abjure the
  postman to hurry, lest Dobson should turn his head and descry his colleague.
  But that ancient man had begun to realize the shortness of time and was
  urging the cart along at a fair pace, since they were now on the flatter
  shelf of land which carried the railway.</p>

  <p>Dickson kept his eyes fixed on the bicycle and his teeth shut tight on his
  lower lip. Now it was hidden by the last dip of hill; now it emerged into
  view not a quarter of a mile behind, and its rider gave vent to a shrill
  call. Luckily the innkeeper did not hear, for at that moment with a jolt the
  cart pulled up at the station door, accompanied by the roar of the incoming
  train.</p>

  <p>Dickson whipped down from the back seat and seized the solitary porter.
  "Label the box for Glasgow and into the van with it, Quick, man, and there'll
  be a shilling for you." He had been doing some rapid thinking these last
  minutes and had made up his mind. If Dobson and he were alone in a carriage
  he could not have the box there; that must be elsewhere, so that Dobson could
  not examine it if he were set on violence, somewhere in which it could still
  be a focus of suspicion and attract attention from his person, He took his
  ticket, and rushed on to the platform, to find the porter and the box at the
  door of the guard's van. Dobson was not there. With the vigour of a fussy
  traveller he shouted directions to the guard to take good care of his
  luggage, hurled a shilling at the porter, and ran for a carriage. At that
  moment he became aware of Dobson hurrying through the entrance. He must have
  met Leon and heard news from him, for his face was red and his ugly brows
  darkening.</p>

  <p>The train was in motion. "Here, you" Dobson's voice shouted. "Stop! I want
  a word wi' ye." Dickson plunged at a third-class carriage, for he saw faces
  behind the misty panes, and above all things then he feared an empty
  compartment. He clambered on to the step, but the handle would not turn, and
  with a sharp pang of fear he felt the innkeeper's grip on his arm. Then some
  Samaritan from within let down the window, opened the door, and pulled him
  up. He fell on a seat, and a second later Dobson staggered in beside him.</p>

  <p>Thank Heaven, the dirty little carriage was nearly full. There were two
  herds, each with a dog and a long hazel crook, and an elderly woman who
  looked like a ploughman's wife out for a day's marketing. And there was one
  other whom Dickson recognized with peculiar joy&mdash;the bagman in the
  provision line of business whom he had met three days before at
  Kilchrist.</p>

  <p>The recognition was mutual. "Mr. McCunn!" the bagman exclaimed. "My, but
  that was running it fine! I hope you've had a pleasant holiday, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Very pleasant. I've been spending two nights with friends down hereaways.
  I've been very fortunate in the weather, for it has broke just when I'm
  leaving."</p>

  <p>Dickson sank back on the hard cushions. It had been a near thing, but so
  far he had won. He wished his heart did not beat so fast, and he hoped he did
  not betray his disorder in his face. Very deliberately he hunted for his pipe
  and filled it slowly. Then he turned to Dobson, "I didn't know you were
  travelling the day. What about your oil-cake?"</p>

  <p>"I've changed my mind," was the gruff answer.</p>

  <p>"Was that you I heard crying on me when we were running for the
  train?"</p>

  <p>"Ay. I thought ye had forgot about your kist."</p>

  <p>"No fear," said Dickson. "I'm no' likely to forget my auntie's
  scones."</p>

  <p>He laughed pleasantly and then turned to the bagman. Thereafter the
  compartment hummed with the technicalities of the grocery trade. He exerted
  himself to draw out his companion, to have him refer to the great firm of D.
  McCunn, so that the innkeeper might be ashamed of his suspicions. What
  nonsense to imagine that a noted and wealthy Glasgow merchant&mdash;the
  bagman's tone was almost reverential&mdash;would concern himself with the
  affairs of a forgotten village and a tumble-down house!</p>

  <p>Presently the train drew up at Kirkmichael station. The woman descended,
  and Dobson, after making sure that no one else meant to follow her example,
  also left the carriage. A porter was shouting: "Fast train to Glasgow&mdash;
  Glasgow next stop." Dickson watched the innkeeper shoulder his way through
  the crowd in the direction of the booking office. "He's off to send a
  telegram," he decided. "There'll be trouble waiting for me at the other
  end."</p>

  <p>When the train moved on he found himself disinclined for further talk. He
  had suddenly become meditative, and curled up in a corner with his head hard
  against the window pane, watching the wet fields and glistening roads as they
  slipped past. He had his plans made for his conduct at Glasgow, but, Lord!
  how he loathed the whole business! Last night he had had a kind of gusto in
  his desire to circumvent villainy; at Dalquharter station he had enjoyed a
  momentary sense of triumph; now he felt very small, lonely, and forlorn. Only
  one thought far at the back of his mind cropped up now and then to give him
  comfort. He was entering on the last lap. Once get this detestable errand
  done and he would be a free man, free to go back to the kindly humdrum life
  from which he should never have strayed. Never again, he vowed, never again.
  Rather would he spend the rest of his days in hydropathics than come within
  the pale of such horrible adventures. Romance, forsooth! This was not the
  mild goddess he had sought, but an awful harpy who battened on the souls of
  men.</p>

  <p>He had some bad minutes as the train passed through the suburbs and along
  the grimy embankment by which the southern lines enter the city. But as it
  rumbled over the river bridge and slowed down before the terminus his
  vitality suddenly revived. He was a business man, and there was now something
  for him to do.</p>

  <p>After a rapid farewell to the bagman, he found a porter and hustled his
  box out of the van in the direction of the left-luggage office. Spies,
  summoned by Dobson's telegram, were, he was convinced, watching his every
  movement, and he meant to see that they missed nothing. He received his
  ticket for the box, and slowly and ostentatiously stowed it away in his pack.
  Swinging the said pack on his arm, he sauntered through the entrance hall to
  the row of waiting taxi-cabs, and selected the oldest and most doddering
  driver. He deposited the pack inside on the seat, and then stood still as if
  struck with a sudden thought.</p>

  <p>"I breakfasted terrible early," he told the driver. "I think I'll have a
  bite to eat. Will you wait?"</p>

  <p>"Ay," said the man, who was reading a grubby sheet of newspaper. "I'll
  wait as long as ye like, for it's you that pays."</p>

  <p>Dickson left his pack in the cab and, oddly enough for a careful man, he
  did not shut the door. He re-entered the station, strolled to the bookstall,
  and bought a Glasgow Herald. His steps then tended to the refreshment-room,
  where he ordered a cup of coffee and two Bath buns, and seated himself at a
  small table. There he was soon immersed in the financial news, and though he
  sipped his coffee he left the buns untasted. He took out a penknife and cut
  various extracts from the Herald, bestowing them carefully in his pocket. An
  observer would have seen an elderly gentleman absorbed in market
  quotations.</p>

  <p>After a quarter of an hour had been spent in this performance he happened
  to glance at the clock and rose with an exclamation. He bustled out to his
  taxi and found the driver still intent upon his reading. "Here I am at last,"
  he said cheerily, and had a foot on the step, when he stopped suddenly with a
  cry. It was a cry of alarm, but also of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"What's become of my pack? I left it on the seat, and now it's gone!
  There's been a thief here."</p>

  <p>The driver, roused from his lethargy, protested in the name of his gods
  that no one had been near it. "Ye took it into the station wi' ye," he
  urged.</p>

  <p>"I did nothing of the kind. Just you wait here till I see the inspector. A
  bonny watch <i>you</i> keep on a gentleman's things."</p>

  <p>But Dickson did not interview the railway authorities. Instead he hurried
  to the left-luggage office. "I deposited a small box here a short time ago. I
  mind the number. Is it here still?"</p>

  <p>The attendant glanced at the shelf. "A wee deal box with iron bands. It
  was took out ten minutes syne. A man brought the ticket and took it away on
  his shoulder."</p>

  <p>"Thank you. There's been a mistake, but the blame's mine. My man mistook
  my orders."</p>

  <p>Then he returned to the now nervous taxi-driver. "I've taken it up with
  the station-master and he's putting the police on. You'll likely be wanted,
  so I gave him your number. It's a fair disgrace that there should be so many
  thieves about this station. It's not the first time I've lost things. Drive
  me to West George Street and look sharp." And he slammed the door with the
  violence of an angry man.</p>

  <p>But his reflections were not violent, for he smiled to himself. "That was
  pretty neat. They'll take some time to get the kist open, for I dropped the
  key out of the train after we left Kirkmichael. That gives me a fair start.
  If I hadn't thought of that, they'd have found some way to grip me and ripe
  me long before I got to the Bank." He shuddered as he thought of the dangers
  he had escaped. "As it is, they're off the track for half an hour at least,
  while they're rummaging among Auntie Phemie's scones." At the thought he
  laughed heartily, and when he brought the taxi-cab to a standstill by rapping
  on the front window, he left it with a temper apparently restored. Obviously
  he had no grudge against the driver, who to his immense surprise was rewarded
  with ten shillings.</p>

  <p>Three minutes later Mr. McCunn might have been seen entering the head
  office of the Strathclyde Bank and inquiring for the manager. There was no
  hesitation about him now, for his foot was on his native heath. The chief
  cashier received him with deference in spite of his unorthodox garb, for he
  was not the least honoured of the bank's customers. As it chanced he had been
  talking about him that very morning to a gentleman from London. "The strength
  of this city," he had said, tapping his eyeglasses on his knuckles, "does not
  lie in its dozen very rich men, but in the hundred or two homely folk who
  make no parade of wealth. Men like Dickson McCunn, for example, who live all
  their life in a semi-detached villa and die worth half a million." And the
  Londoner had cordially assented.</p>

  <p>So Dickson was ushered promptly into an inner room, and was warmly greeted
  by Mr. Mackintosh, the patron of the Gorbals Die-Hards.</p>

  <p>"I must thank you for your generous donation, McCunn. Those boys will get
  a little fresh air and quiet after the smoke and din of Glasgow. A little
  country peace to smooth out the creases in their poor little souls."</p>

  <p>"Maybe," said Dickson, with a vivid recollection of Dougal as he had last
  seen him. Somehow he did not think that peace was likely to be the portion of
  that devoted band. "But I've not come here to speak about that."</p>

  <p>He took off his waterproof; then his coat and waistcoat; and showed
  himself a strange figure with sundry bulges about the middle. The manager's
  eyes grew very round. Presently these excrescences were revealed as linen
  bags sewn on to his shirt, and fitting into the hollow between ribs and hip.
  With some difficulty he slit the bags and extracted three hide-bound
  packages.</p>

  <p>"See here, Mackintosh," he said solemnly. "I hand you over these parcels,
  and you're to put them in the innermost corner of your strong room. You
  needn't open them. Just put them away as they are, and write me a receipt for
  them. Write it now."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mackintosh obediently took pen in hand.</p>

  <p>"What'll I call them?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Just the three leather parcels handed to you by Dickson McCunn, Esq.,
  naming the date."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mackintosh wrote. He signed his name with his usual flourish and
  handed the slip to his client.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Dickson, "you'll put that receipt in the strong box where you
  keep my securities and you'll give it up to nobody but me in person and
  you'll surrender the parcels only on presentation of the receipt. D'you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly. May I ask any questions?"</p>

  <p>"You'd better not if you don't want to hear lees.'</p>

  <p>"What's in the packages?" Mr. Mackintosh weighed them in his hand.</p>

  <p>"That's asking," said Dickson. "But I'll tell ye this much. It's
  jools."</p>

  <p>"Your own?"</p>

  <p>"No, but I'm their trustee."</p>

  <p>"Valuable?"</p>

  <p>"I was hearing they were worth more than a million pounds."</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul," said the startled manager. "I don't like this kind of
  business, McCunn."</p>

  <p>"No more do I. But you'll do it to oblige an old friend and a good
  customer. If you don't know much about the packages you know all about me.
  Now, mind, I trust you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mackintosh forced himself to a joke. "Did you maybe steal them?"</p>

  <p>Dickson grinned. "Just what I did. And that being so, I want you to let me
  out by the back door."</p>

  <p>When he found himself in the street he felt the huge relief of a boy who
  had emerged with credit from the dentist's chair. Remembering that here would
  be no midday dinner for him at home, his first step was to feed heavily at a
  restaurant. He had, so far as he could see, surmounted all his troubles, his
  one regret being that he had lost his pack, which contained among other
  things his Izaak Walton and his safety razor. He bought another razor and a
  new Walton, and mounted an electric tram car en route for home.</p>

  <p>Very contented with himself he felt as the car swung across the Clyde
  bridge. He had done well&mdash;but of that he did not want to think, for the
  whole beastly thing was over. He was going to bury that memory, to be
  resurrected perhaps on a later day when the unpleasantness had been
  forgotten. Heritage had his address, and knew where to come when it was time
  to claim the jewels. As for the watchers, they must have ceased to suspect
  him, when they discovered the innocent contents of his knapsack and Mrs.
  Morran's box. Home for him, and a luxurious tea by his own fireside; and then
  an evening with his books, for Heritage's nonsense had stimulated his
  literary fervour. He would dip into his old favourites again to confirm his
  faith. To-morrow he would go for a jaunt somewhere&mdash;perhaps down the
  Clyde, or to the South of England, which he had heard was a pleasant, thickly
  peopled country. No more lonely inns and deserted villages for him;
  henceforth he would make certain of comfort and peace.</p>

  <p>The rain had stopped, and, as the car moved down the dreary vista of
  Eglinton street, the sky opened into fields of blue and the April sun
  silvered the puddles. It was in such place and under such weather that
  Dickson suffered an overwhelming experience.</p>

  <p>It is beyond my skill, being all unlearned in the game of psycho-analysis,
  to explain how this thing happened. I concern myself only with facts.
  Suddenly the pretty veil of self-satisfaction was rent from top to bottom,
  and Dickson saw a figure of himself within, a smug leaden little figure which
  simpered and preened itself and was hollow as a rotten nut. And he hated
  it.</p>

  <p>The horrid truth burst on him that Heritage had been right. He only played
  with life. That imbecile image was a mere spectator, content to applaud, but
  shrinking from the contact of reality. It had been all right as a provision
  merchant, but when it fancied itself capable of higher things it had deceived
  itself. Foolish little image with its brave dreams and its swelling words
  from Browning! All make-believe of the feeblest. He was a coward, running
  away at the first threat of danger. It was as if he were watching a tall
  stranger with a wand pointing to the embarrassed phantom that was himself,
  and ruthlessly exposing its frailties! And yet the pitiless showman was
  himself too&mdash;himself as he wanted to be, cheerful, brave, resourceful,
  indomitable.</p>

  <p>Dickson suffered a spasm of mortal agony. "Oh, I'm surely not so bad as
  all that," he groaned. But the hurt was not only in his pride. He saw himself
  being forced to new decisions, and each alternative was of the blackest. He
  fairly shivered with the horror of it. The car slipped past a suburban
  station from which passengers were emerging&mdash;comfortable black-coated
  men such as he had once been. He was bitterly angry with Providence for
  picking him out of the great crowd of sedentary folk for this sore ordeal.
  "Why was I tethered to sich a conscience?" was his moan. But there was that
  stern inquisitor with his pointer exploring his soul. "You flatter yourself
  you have done your share," he was saying. "You will make pretty stories about
  it to yourself, and some day you may tell your friends, modestly disclaiming
  any special credit. But you will be a liar, for you know you are afraid. You
  are running away when the work is scarcely begun, and leaving it to a few
  boys and a poet whom you had the impudence the other day to despise. I think
  you are worse than a coward. I think you are a cad."</p>

  <p>His fellow-passengers on the top of the car saw an absorbed middle-aged
  gentleman who seemed to have something the matter with his bronchial tubes.
  They could not guess at the tortured soul. The decision was coming nearer,
  the alternatives loomed up dark and inevitable. On one side was submission to
  ignominy, on the other a return to that place which he detested, and yet
  loathed himself for detesting. "It seems I'm not likely to have much peace
  either way," he reflected dismally.</p>

  <p>How the conflict would have ended had it continued on these lines I cannot
  say. The soul of Mr. McCunn was being assailed by moral and metaphysical
  adversaries with which he had not been trained to deal. But suddenly it leapt
  from negatives to positives. He saw the face of the girl in the shuttered
  House, so fair and young and yet so haggard. It seemed to be appealing to him
  to rescue it from a great loneliness and fear. Yes, he had been right, it had
  a strange look of his Janet&mdash;the wide-open eyes, the solemn mouth. What
  was to become of that child if he failed her in her need?</p>

  <p>Now Dickson was a practical man, and this view of the case brought him
  into a world which he understood. "It's fair ridiculous," he reflected.
  "Nobody there to take a grip of things. Just a wheen Gorbals keelies and the
  lad Heritage. Not a business man among the lot."</p>

  <p>The alternatives, which hove before him like two great banks of cloud,
  were altering their appearance. One was becoming faint and tenuous; the
  other, solid as ever, was just a shade less black. He lifted his eyes and saw
  in the near distance the corner of the road which led to his home. "I must
  decide before I reach that corner," he told himself.</p>

  <p>Then his mind became apathetic. He began to whistle dismally through his
  teeth, watching the corner as it came nearer. The car stopped with a jerk.
  "I'll go back," he said aloud, clambering down the steps. The truth was he
  had decided five minutes before when he first saw Janet's face.</p>

  <p>He walked briskly to his house, entirely refusing to waste any more energy
  on reflection. "This is a business proposition," he told himself, "and I'm
  going to handle it as sich." Tibby was surprised to see him and offered him
  tea in vain. "I'm just back for a few minutes. Let's see the letters."</p>

  <p>There was one from his wife. She proposed to stay another week at the Neuk
  Hydropathic and suggested that he might join her and bring her home. He sat
  down and wrote a long affectionate reply, declining, but expressing his
  delight that she was soon returning. "That's very likely the last time Mamma
  will hear from me," he reflected, but&mdash;oddly enough&mdash;without any
  great fluttering of the heart.</p>

  <p>Then he proceeded to be furiously busy. He sent out Tibby to buy another
  knapsack and to order a cab and to cash a considerable cheque. In the
  knapsack he packed a fresh change of clothing and the new safety razor, but
  no books, for he was past the need of them. That done, he drove to his
  solicitors.</p>

  <p>"What like a firm are Glendonan and Speirs in Edinburgh?" he asked the
  senior partner.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very respectable. Very respectable indeed. Regular Edinburgh W.S.
  Lot. Do a lot of factoring."</p>

  <p>"I want you to telephone through to them and inquire about a place in
  Carrick called Huntingtower, near the village of Dalquharter. I understand
  it's to let, and I'm thinking of taking a lease of it."</p>

  <p>The senior partner after some delay got through to Edinburgh, and was
  presently engaged in the feverish dialectic which the long-distance telephone
  involves. "I want to speak to Mr. Glendonan himself...  Yes, yes, Mr. Caw of
  Paton and Linklater...  Good afternoon...  Huntingtower. Yes, in Carrick. Not
  to let? But I understand it's been in the market for some months. You say
  you've an idea it has just been let. But my client is positive that you're
  mistaken, unless the agreement was made this morning...  You'll inquire? Ah,
  I see. The actual factoring is done by your local agent, Mr. James Loudon, in
  Auchenlochan. You think my client had better get into touch with him at once.
  Just wait a minute, please."</p>

  <p>He put his hand over the receiver. "Usual Edinburgh way of doing
  business," he observed caustically. "What do you want done?"</p>

  <p>"I'll run down and see this Loudon. Tell Glendonan and Spiers to advise
  him to expect me, for I'll go this very day."</p>

  <p>Mr. Caw resumed his conversation. "My client would like a telegram sent at
  once to Mr. Loudon introducing him. He's Mr. Dickson McCunn of Mearns
  Street&mdash;the great provision merchant, you know. Oh, yes! Good for any
  rent. Refer if you like to the Strathclyde Bank, but you can take my word for
  it. Thank you. Then that's settled. Good-bye."</p>

  <p>Dickson's next visit was to a gunmaker who was a fellow-elder with him in
  the Guthrie Memorial Kirk.</p>

  <p>"I want a pistol and a lot of cartridges," he announced. "I'm not caring
  what kind it is, so long as it is a good one and not too big."</p>

  <p>"For yourself?" the gunmaker asked. "You must have a license, I doubt, and
  there's a lot of new regulations."</p>

  <p>"I can't wait on a license. It's for a cousin of mine who's off to Mexico
  at once. You've got to find some way of obliging an old friend, Mr.
  McNair."</p>

  <p>Mr. McNair scratched his head. "I don't see how I can sell you one. But
  I'll tell you what I'll do&mdash;I'll lend you one. It belongs to my nephew,
  Peter Tait, and has been lying in a drawer ever since he came back from the
  front. He has no use for it now that he's a placed minister."</p>

  <p>So Dickson bestowed in the pockets of his water-proof a service revolver
  and fifty cartridges, and bade his cab take him to the shop in Mearns Street.
  For a moment the sight of the familiar place struck a pang to his breast, but
  he choked down unavailing regrets. He ordered a great hamper of
  foodstuffs&mdash;the most delicate kind of tinned goods, two perfect hams,
  tongues, Strassburg pies, chocolate, cakes, biscuits, and, as a last thought,
  half a dozen bottles of old liqueur brandy. It was to be carefully packed,
  addressed to Mrs. Morran, Dalquharter Station, and delivered in time for him
  to take down by the 7.33 train. Then he drove to the terminus and dined with
  something like a desperate peace in his heart.</p>

  <p>On this occasion he took a first-class ticket, for he wanted to be alone.
  As the lights began to be lit in the wayside stations and the clear April
  dusk darkened into night, his thoughts were sombre yet resigned. He opened
  the window and let the sharp air of the Renfrewshire uplands fill the
  carriage. It was fine weather again after the rain, and a bright
  constellation&mdash;perhaps Dougal's friend O'Brien&mdash;hung in the western
  sky. How happy he would have been a week ago had he been starting thus for a
  country holiday! He could sniff the faint scent of moor-burn and ploughed
  earth which had always been his first reminder of Spring. But he had been
  pitchforked out of that old happy world and could never enter it again. Alas!
  for the roadside fire, the cosy inn, the Compleat Angler, the Chavender or
  Chub!</p>

  <p>And yet&mdash;and yet! He had done the right thing, though the Lord alone
  knew how it would end. He began to pluck courage from his very melancholy,
  and hope from his reflections upon the transitoriness of life. He was
  austerely following Romance as he conceived it, and if that capricious lady
  had taken one dream from him she might yet reward him with a better. Tags of
  poetry came into his head which seemed to favour this
  philosophy&mdash;particularly some lines of Browning on which he used to
  discourse to his Kirk Literary Society. Uncommon silly, he considered, these
  homilies of his must have been, mere twitterings of the unfledged. But now he
  saw more in the lines, a deeper interpretation which he had earned the right
  to make.</p>

  <p>"Oh world, where all things change and nought abides, Oh life, the long
  mutation&mdash;is it so? Is it with life as with the body's change?&mdash;
  Where, e'en tho' better follow, good must pass."</p>

  <p>That was as far as he could get, though he cudgelled his memory to
  continue. Moralizing thus, he became drowsy, and was almost asleep when the
  train drew up at the station of Kirkmichael.</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref9"
     id="ref9">CHAPTER 7</a></h3>

  <h2>SUNDRY DOINGS IN THE MIRK</h2>

  <p>From Kirkmichael on the train stopped at every station, but no passenger
  seemed to leave or arrive at the little platforms white in the moon. At
  Dalquharter the case of provisions was safely transferred to the porter with
  instructions to take charge of it till it was sent for. During the next few
  minutes Dickson's mind began to work upon his problem with a certain
  briskness. It was all nonsense that the law of Scotland could not be summoned
  to the defence. The jewels had been safely got rid of, and who was to dispute
  their possession? Not Dobson and his crew, who had no sort of title, and were
  out for naked robbery. The girl had spoken of greater dangers from new
  enemies&mdash;kidnapping, perhaps. Well, that was felony, and the police must
  be brought in. Probably if all were known the three watchers had criminal
  records, pages long, filed at Scotland Yard. The man to deal with that side
  of the business was Loudon the factor, and to him he was bound in the first
  place. He had made a clear picture in his head of this Loudon&mdash;a
  derelict old country writer, formal, pedantic, lazy, anxious only to get an
  unprofitable business off his hands with the least possible trouble, never
  going near the place himself, and ably supported in his lethargy by conceited
  Edinburgh Writers to the Signet. "Sich notions of business!" he murmured. "I
  wonder that there's a single county family in Scotland no' in the bankruptcy
  court!" It was his mission to wake up Mr. James Loudon.</p>

  <p>Arrived at Auchenlochan he went first to the Salutation Hotel, a
  pretentious place sacred to golfers. There he engaged a bedroom for the night
  and, having certain scruples, paid for it in advance. He also had some
  sandwiches prepared which he stowed in his pack, and filled his flask with
  whisky. "I'm going home to Glasgow by the first train in the to-morrow," he
  told the landlady, "and now I've got to see a friend. I'll not be back till
  late." He was assured that there would be no difficulty about his admittance
  at any hour, and directed how to find Mr. Loudon's dwelling.</p>

  <p>It was an old house fronting direct on the street, with a fanlight above
  the door and a neat brass plate bearing the legend "Mr. James Loudon,
  Writer." A lane ran up one side leading apparently to a garden, for the
  moonlight showed the dusk of trees. In front was the main street of
  Auchenlochan, now deserted save for a single roisterer, and opposite stood
  the ancient town house, with arches where the country folk came at the spring
  and autumn hiring fairs. Dickson rang the antiquated bell, and was presently
  admitted to a dark hall floored with oilcloth, where a single gas-jet showed
  that on one side was the business office and on the other the living-rooms.
  Mr. Loudon was at supper, he was told, and he sent in his card. Almost at
  once the door at the end on the left side was flung open and a large figure
  appeared flourishing a napkin. "Come in, sir, come in," it cried. "I've just
  finished a bite of meat. Very glad to see you. Here, Maggie, what d'you mean
  by keeping the gentleman standing in that outer darkness?"</p>

  <p>The room into which Dickson was ushered was small and bright, with a red
  paper on the walls, a fire burning, and a big oil lamp in the centre of a
  table. Clearly Mr. Loudon had no wife, for it was a bachelor's den in every
  line of it. A cloth was laid on a corner of the table, in which stood the
  remnants of a meal. Mr. Loudon seemed to have been about to make a brew of
  punch, for a kettle simmered by the fire, and lemons and sugar flanked a
  pot-bellied whisky decanter of the type that used to be known as a "mason's
  mell."</p>

  <p>The sight of the lawyer was a surprise to Dickson and dissipated his
  notions of an aged and lethargic incompetent. Mr. Loudon was a strongly built
  man who could not be a year over fifty. He had a ruddy face, clean shaven
  except for a grizzled moustache; his grizzled hair was thinning round the
  temples; but his skin was unwrinkled and his eyes had all the vigour of
  youth. His tweed suit was well cut, and the buff waistcoat with flaps and
  pockets and the plain leather watchguard hinted at the sportsman, as did the
  half-dozen racing prints on the wall. A pleasant high-coloured figure he
  made; his voice had the frank ring due to much use out of doors; and his
  expression had the singular candour which comes from grey eyes with large
  pupils and a narrow iris.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Mr. McCunn. Take the arm-chair by the fire. I've had a wire
  from Glendonan and Speirs about you. I was just going to have a glass of
  toddy&mdash;a grand thing for these uncertain April nights. You'll join me?
  No? Well, you'll smoke anyway. There's cigars at your elbow. Certainly, a
  pipe if you like. This is Liberty Hall."</p>

  <p>Dickson found some difficulty in the part for which he had cast himself.
  He had expected to condescend upon an elderly inept and give him sharp
  instructions; instead he found himself faced with a jovial, virile figure
  which certainly did not suggest incompetence. It has been mentioned already
  that he had always great difficulty in looking any one in the face, and this
  difficulty was intensified when he found himself confronted with bold and
  candid eyes. He felt abashed and a little nervous.</p>

  <p>"I've come to see you about Huntingtower House," he began.</p>

  <p>"I know, so Glendonans informed me. Well, I'm very glad to hear it. The
  place has been standing empty far too long, and that is worse for a new house
  than an old house. There's not much money to spend on it either, unless we
  can make sure of a good tenant. How did you hear about it?"</p>

  <p>"I was taking a bit holiday and I spent a night at Dalquharter with an old
  auntie of mine. You must understand I've just retired from business, and I'm
  thinking of finding a country place. I used to have the provision shop in
  Mearns Street&mdash;now the United Supply Stores, Limited. You've maybe heard
  of it?"</p>

  <p>The other bowed and smiled. "Who hasn't? The name of Dickson McCunn is
  known far beyond the city of Glasgow."</p>

  <p>Dickson was not insensible of the flattery, and he continued with more
  freedom. "I took a walk and got a glisk of the House, and I liked the look of
  it. You see, I want a quiet bit a good long way from a town, and at the same
  time a house with all modern conveniences. I suppose Huntingtower has
  that?"</p>

  <p>"When it was built fifteen years ago it was considered a model&mdash;six
  bathrooms, its own electric light plant, steam heating, and independent
  boiler for hot water, the whole bag of tricks. I won't say but what some of
  these contrivances will want looking to, for the place has been some time
  empty, but there can be nothing very far wrong, and I can guarantee that the
  bones of the house are good."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's all right," said Dickson. "I don't mind spending a little
  money myself if the place suits me. But of that, of course, I'm not yet
  certain, for I've only had a glimpse of the outside. I wanted to get into the
  policies, but a man at the lodge wouldn't let me. They're a mighty uncivil
  lot down there."</p>

  <p>"I'm very sorry to hear that," said Mr. Loudon in a tone of concern.</p>

  <p>"Ay, and if I take the place I'll stipulate that you get rid of the
  lodgekeepers."</p>

  <p>"There won't be the slightest difficulty about that, for they are only
  weekly tenants. But I'm vexed to hear they were uncivil. I was glad to get
  any tenant that offered, and they were well recommended to me."</p>

  <p>"They're foreigners."</p>

  <p>"One of them is&mdash;a Belgian refugee that Lady Morewood took an
  interest in. But the other&mdash;Spittal, they call him&mdash;I thought he
  was Scotch."</p>

  <p>"He's not that. And I don't like the innkeeper either. I would want him
  shifted."</p>

  <p>Dr. Loudon laughed. "I dare say Dobson is a rough diamond. There's worse
  folk in the world all the same, but I don't think he will want to stay. He
  only went there to pass the time till he heard from his brother in Vancouver.
  He's a roving spirit, and will be off overseas again."</p>

  <p>"That's all right!" said Dickson, who was beginning to have horrid
  suspicions that he might be on a wild-goose chase after all. "Well, the next
  thing is for me to see over the House."</p>

  <p>"Certainly. I'd like to go with you myself. What day would suit you? Let
  me see. This is Friday. What about this day week?"</p>

  <p>"I was thinking of to-morrow. Since I'm down in these parts I may as well
  get the job done."</p>

  <p>Mr. Loudon looked puzzled. "I quite see that. But I don't think it's
  possible. You see, I have to consult the owners and get their consent to a
  lease. Of course they have the general purpose of letting, but&mdash;well,
  they're queer folk the Kennedys," and his face wore the half-embarrassed
  smile of an honest man preparing to make confidences. "When poor Mr. Quentin
  died, the place went to his two sisters in joint ownership. A very bad
  arrangement, as you can imagine. It isn't entailed, and I've always been
  pressing them to sell, but so far they won't hear of it. They both married
  Englishmen, so it will take a day or two to get in touch with them. One, Mrs.
  Stukely, lives in Devonshire. The other&mdash;Miss Katie that was&mdash;
  married Sir Frances Morewood, the general, and I hear that she's expected
  back in London next Monday from the Riviera. I'll wire and write first thing
  to-morrow morning. But you must give me a day or two."</p>

  <p>Dickson felt himself waking up. His doubts about his own sanity were
  dissolving, for, as his mind reasoned, the factor was prepared to do anything
  he asked&mdash;but only after a week had gone. What he was concerned with was
  the next few days.</p>

  <p>"All the same I would like to have a look at the place to-morrow, even if
  nothing comes of it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Loudon looked seriously perplexed. "You will think me absurdly fussy,
  Mr. McCunn, but I must really beg of you to give up the idea. The Kennedys,
  as I have said, are&mdash;well, not exactly like other people, and I have the
  strictest orders not to let any one visit the house without their express
  leave. It sounds a ridiculous rule, but I assure you it's as much as my job
  is worth to disregard it."</p>

  <p>"D'you mean to say not a soul is allowed inside the House?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul."</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Loudon, I'm going to tell you a queer thing, which I think you
  ought to know. When I was taking a walk the other night&mdash;your Belgian
  wouldn't let me into the policies, but I went down the glen&mdash;what's that
  they call it? the Garple Dean&mdash;I got round the back where the old ruin
  stands and I had a good look at the House. I tell you there was somebody in
  it."</p>

  <p>"It would be Spittal, who acts as caretaker."</p>

  <p>"It was not. It was a woman. I saw her on the verandah."</p>

  <p>The candid grey eyes were looking straight at Dickson, who managed to
  bring his own shy orbs to meet them. He thought that he detected a shade of
  hesitation. Then Mr. Loudon got up from his chair and stood on the hearthrug
  looking down at his visitor. He laughed, with some embarrassment, but ever so
  pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"I really don't know what you will think of me, Mr. McCunn. Here are you,
  coming to do us all a kindness, and lease that infernal white elephant, and
  here have I been steadily hoaxing you for the last five minutes. I humbly ask
  your pardon. Set it down to the loyalty of an old family lawyer. Now, I am
  going to tell you the truth and take you into our confidence, for I know we
  are safe with you. The Kennedys are&mdash;always have been&mdash;just a wee
  bit queer. Old inbred stock, you know. They will produce somebody like poor
  Mr. Quentin, who was as sane as you or me, but as a rule in every generation
  there is one member of the family&mdash;or more&mdash;who is just a little
  bit&mdash;" and he tapped his forehead. "Nothing violent, you understand, but
  just not quite 'wise and world-like,' as the old folk say. Well, there's a
  certain old lady, an aunt of Mr. Quentin and his sisters, who has always been
  about tenpence in the shilling. Usually she lives at Bournemouth, but one of
  her crazes is a passion for Huntingtower, and the Kennedys have always
  humoured her and had her to stay every spring. When the House was shut up
  that became impossible, but this year she took such a craving to come back,
  that Lady Morewood asked me to arrange it. It had to be kept very quiet, but
  the poor old thing is perfectly harmless, and just sits and knits with her
  maid and looks out of the seaward windows. Now you see why I can't take you
  there to-morrow. I have to get rid of the old lady, who in any case was
  travelling south early next week. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," said Dickson with some fervour. He had learned exactly what
  he wanted. The factor was telling him lies. Now he knew where to place Mr.
  Loudon.</p>

  <p>He always looked back upon what followed as a very creditable piece of
  play-acting for a man who had small experience in that line.</p>

  <p>"Is the old lady a wee wizened body, with a black cap and something like a
  white cashmere shawl round her shoulders?"</p>

  <p>"You describe her exactly," Mr. Loudon replied eagerly.</p>

  <p>"That would explain the foreigners."</p>

  <p>"Of course. We couldn't have natives who would make the thing the clash of
  the countryside."</p>

  <p>"Of course not. But it must be a difficult job to keep a business like
  that quiet. Any wandering policeman might start inquiries. And supposing the
  lady became violent?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, there's no fear of that. Besides, I've a position in this
  country&mdash;Deputy Fiscal and so forth&mdash;and a friend of the Chief
  Constable. I think I may be trusted to do a little private explaining if the
  need arose."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Dickson. He saw, indeed, a great deal which would give him
  food for furious thought. "Well, I must possess my soul in patience. Here's
  my Glasgow address, and I look to you to send me a telegram whenever you're
  ready for me. I'm at the Salutation to-night, and go home to-morrow with the
  first train. Wait a minute"&mdash;and he pulled out his watch&mdash; "there's
  a train stops at Auchenlochan at 10.17. I think I'll catch that...  Well Mr.
  Loudon, I'm very much obliged to you, and I'm glad to think that it'll no' be
  long till we renew our acquaintance."</p>

  <p>The factor accompanied him to the door, diffusing geniality. "Very pleased
  indeed to have met you. A pleasant journey and a quick return."</p>

  <p>The street was still empty. Into a corner of the arches opposite the moon
  was shining, and Dickson retired thither to consult his map of the
  neighbourhood. He found what he wanted, and, as he lifted his eyes, caught
  sight of a man coming down the causeway. Promptly he retired into the shadow
  and watched the new-comer. There could be no mistake about the figure; the
  bulk, the walk, the carriage of the head marked it for Dobson. The innkeeper
  went slowly past the factor's house; then halted and retraced his steps;
  then, making sure that the street was empty, turned into the side lane which
  led to the garden.</p>

  <p>This was what sailors call a cross-bearing, and strengthened Dickson's
  conviction. He delayed no longer, but hurried down the side street by which
  the north road leaves the town.</p>

  <p>He had crossed the bridge of Lochan and was climbing the steep ascent
  which led to the heathy plateau separating that stream from the Garple before
  he had got his mind quite clear on the case. <i>First</i>, Loudon was in the
  plot, whatever it was; responsible for the details of the girl's
  imprisonment, but not the main author. That must be the Unknown who was still
  to come, from whom Spidel took his orders. Dobson was probably Loudon's
  special henchman, working directly under him. <i>Secondly</i>, the immediate
  object had been the jewels, and they were happily safe in the vaults of the
  incorruptible Mackintosh. But, <i>third</i>&mdash;and this only on Saskia's
  evidences&mdash;the worst danger to her began with the arrival of the
  Unknown. What could that be? Probably, kidnapping. He was prepared to believe
  anything of people like Bolsheviks. And, <i>fourth</i>, this danger was due
  within the next day or two. Loudon had been quite willing to let him into the
  house and to sack all the watchers within a week from that date. The natural
  and right thing was to summon the aid of the law, but, <i>fifth</i>, that
  would be a slow business with Loudon able to put spokes in the wheels and
  befog the authorities, and the mischief would be done before a single
  policeman showed his face in Dalquharter. Therefore, <i>sixth</i>, he and
  Heritage must hold the fort in the meantime, and he would send a wire to his
  lawyer, Mr. Caw, to get to work with the constabulary. <i>Seventh</i>, he
  himself was probably free from suspicion in both Loudon's and Dobson's minds
  as a harmless fool. But that freedom would not survive his reappearance in
  Dalquharter. He could say, to be sure, that he had come back to see his
  auntie, but that would not satisfy the watchers, since, so far as they knew,
  he was the only man outside the gang who was aware that people were dwelling
  in the House. They would not tolerate his presence in the neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>He formulated his conclusions as if it were an ordinary business deal, and
  rather to his surprise was not conscious of any fear. As he pulled together
  the belt of his waterproof he felt the reassuring bulges in its pockets which
  were his pistol and cartridges. He reflected that it must be very difficult
  to miss with a pistol if you fired it at, say, three yards, and if there was
  to be shooting that would be his range. Mr. McCunn had stumbled on the
  precious truth that the best way to be rid of quaking knees is to keep a busy
  mind.</p>

  <p>He crossed the ridge of the plateau and looked down on the Garple glen.
  There were the lights of Dalquharter&mdash;or rather a single light, for the
  inhabitants went early to bed. His intention was to seek quarters with Mrs.
  Morran, when his eye caught a gleam in a hollow of the moor a little to the
  east. He knew it for the camp-fire around which Dougal's warriors bivouacked.
  The notion came to him to go there instead, and hear the news of the day
  before entering the cottage. So he crossed the bridge, skirted a plantation
  of firs, and scrambled through the broom and heather in what he took to be
  the right direction.</p>

  <p>The moon had gone down, and the quest was not easy. Dickson had come to
  the conclusion that he was on the wrong road, when he was summoned by a voice
  which seemed to arise out of the ground.</p>

  <p>"Who goes there?"</p>

  <p>"What's that you say?"</p>

  <p>"Who goes there?" The point of a pole was held firmly against his
  chest.</p>

  <p>"I'm Mr. McCunn, a friend of Dougal's."</p>

  <p>"Stand, friend." The shadow before him whistled and another shadow
  appeared. "Report to the Chief that there's a man here, name o' McCunn,
  seekin' for him."</p>

  <p>Presently the messenger returned with Dougal and a cheap lantern which he
  flashed in Dickson's face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's you," said that leader, who had his jaw bound up as if he had
  the toothache. "What are ye doing back here?"</p>

  <p>"To tell the truth, Dougal," was the answer, "I couldn't stay away. I was
  fair miserable when I thought of Mr. Heritage and you laddies left to
  yourselves. My conscience simply wouldn't let me stop at home, so here I
  am."</p>

  <p>Dougal grunted, but clearly he approved, for from that moment he treated
  Dickson with a new respect. Formerly when he had referred to him at all it
  had been as "auld McCunn." Now it was "Mister McCunn." He was given rank as a
  worthy civilian ally. The bivouac was a cheerful place in the wet night. A
  great fire of pine roots and old paling posts hissed in the fine rain, and
  around it crouched several urchins busy making oatmeal cakes in the embers.
  On one side a respectable lean-to had been constructed by nailing a plank to
  two fir-trees, running sloping poles thence to the ground, and thatching the
  whole with spruce branches and heather. On the other side two small
  dilapidated home-made tents were pitched. Dougal motioned his companion into
  the lean-to, where they had some privacy from the rest of the band.</p>

  <p>"Well, what's your news?" Dickson asked. He noticed that the Chieftain
  seemed to have been comprehensively in the wars, for apart from the bandage
  on his jaw, he had numerous small cuts on his brow, and a great rent in one
  of his shirt sleeves. Also he appeared to be going lame, and when he spoke a
  new gap was revealed in his large teeth.</p>

  <p>"Things," said Dougal solemnly, "has come to a bonny cripus. This very
  night we've been in a battle."</p>

  <p>He spat fiercely, and the light of war burned in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"It was the tinklers from the Garple Dean. They yokit on us about seven
  o'clock, just at the darkenin'. First they tried to bounce us. We weren't
  wanted here, they said, so we'd better clear. I telled them that it was them
  that wasn't wanted. 'Awa' to Finnick,' says I. 'D'ye think we take our orders
  from dirty ne'er-do-weels like you?' 'By God,' says they, 'we'll cut your
  lights out,' and then the battle started."</p>

  <p>"What happened?' Dickson asked excitedly.</p>

  <p>"They were four muckle men against six laddies, and they thought they had
  an easy job! Little they kenned the Gorbals Die-Hards! I had been expectin'
  something of the kind, and had made my plans. They first tried to pu' down
  our tents and burn them. I let them get within five yards, reservin' my fire.
  The first volley&mdash;stones from our hands and our catties&mdash;halted
  them, and before they could recover three of us had got hold o' burnin'
  sticks frae the fire and were lammin' into them. We kinnled their claes, and
  they fell back swearin' and stampin' to get the fire out. Then I gave the
  word and we were on them wi' our pales, usin' the points accordin' to
  instructions. My orders was to keep a good distance, for if they had grippit
  one o' us he'd ha' been done for. They were roarin' mad by now, and twae had
  out their knives, but they couldn't do muckle, for it was gettin' dark, and
  they didn't ken the ground like us, and were aye trippin' and tumblin'. But
  they pressed us hard, and one o' them landed me an awful clype on the jaw.
  They were still aiming at our tents, and I saw that if they got near the fire
  again it would be the end o' us. So I blew my whistle for Thomas Yownie, who
  was in command o' the other half of us, with instructions to fall upon their
  rear. That brought Thomas up, and the tinklers had to face round about and
  fight a battle on two fronts. We charged them and they broke, and the last
  seen o' them they were coolin' their burns in the Garple."</p>

  <p>"Well done, man. Had you many casualties?"</p>

  <p>"We're a' a wee thing battered, but nothing to hurt. I'm the worst, for
  one o' them had a grip o' me for about three seconds, and Gosh! he was
  fierce."</p>

  <p>"They're beaten off for the night, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, for the night. But they'll come back, never fear. That's why I said
  that things had come to a cripus."</p>

  <p>"What's the news from the House?"</p>

  <p>"A quiet day, and no word o' Lean or Dobson."</p>

  <p>Dickson nodded. "They were hunting me."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Heritage has gone to bide in the Hoose. They were watchin' the Garple
  Dean, so I took him round by the Laver foot and up the rocks. He's a souple
  yin, yon. We fund a road up the rocks and got in by the verandy. Did ye ken
  that the lassie had a pistol? Well, she has, and it seems that Mr. Heritage
  is a good shot wi' a pistol, so there's some hope thereaways...  Are the
  jools safe?"</p>

  <p>"Safe in the bank. But the jools were not the main thing."</p>

  <p>Dougal nodded. "So I was thinkin'. The lassie wasn't muckle the easier for
  gettin' rid o' them. I didn't just quite understand what she said to Mr.
  Heritage, for they were aye wanderin' into foreign langwidges, but it seems
  she's terrible feared o' somebody that may turn up any moment. What's the
  reason I can't say. She's maybe got a secret, or maybe it's just that she's
  ower bonny."</p>

  <p>"That's the trouble," said Dickson, and proceeded to recount his interview
  with the factor, to which Dougal gave close attention. "Now the way I read
  the thing is this. There's a plot to kidnap that lady for some infernal
  purpose, and it depends on the arrival of some person or persons, and it's
  due to happen in the next day or two. If we try to work it through the police
  alone, they'll beat us, for Loudon will manage to hang the business up until
  it's too late. So we must take on the job ourselves. We must stand a siege,
  Mr. Heritage and me and you laddies, and for that purpose we'd better all
  keep together. It won't be extra easy to carry her off from all of us, and if
  they do manage it we'll stick to their heels...  Man, Dougal, isn't it a
  queer thing that whiles law-abiding folk have to make their own laws?...  So
  my plan is that the lot of us get into the House and form a garrison. If you
  don't, the tinklers will come back and you'll no' beat them in the
  daylight."</p>

  <p>"I doubt no'," said Dougal. "But what about our meat?"</p>

  <p>"We must lay in provisions. We'll get what we can from Mrs. Morran, and
  I've left a big box of fancy things at Dalquharter station. Can you laddies
  manage to get it down here?"</p>

  <p>Dougal reflected. "Ay, we can hire Mrs. Sempill's powny, the same that
  fetched our kit."</p>

  <p>"Well, that's your job to-morrow. See, I'll write you a line to the
  station-master. And will you undertake to get it some way into the
  House?"</p>

  <p>"There's just the one road open&mdash;by the rocks. It'll have to be done.
  It CAN be done."</p>

  <p>"And I've another job. I'm writing this telegram to a friend in Glasgow
  who will put a spoke in Mr. Loudon's wheel. I want one of you to go to
  Kirkmichael to send it from the telegraph office there."</p>

  <p>Dougal placed the wire to Mr. Caw in his bosom. "What about yourself? We
  want somebody outside to keep his eyes open. It's bad strawtegy to cut off
  your communications."</p>

  <p>Dickson thought for a moment. "I believe you're right. I believe the best
  plan for me is to go back to Mrs. Morran's as soon as the old body's like to
  be awake. You can always get at me there, for it's easy to slip into her back
  kitchen without anybody in the village seeing you...  Yes, I'll do that, and
  you'll come and report developments to me. And now I'm for a bite and a pipe.
  It's hungry work travelling the country in the small hours."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to introjuice ye to the rest o' us," said Dougal. "Here, men!"
  he called, and four figures rose from the side of the fire. As Dickson
  munched a sandwich he passed in review the whole company of the Gorbals
  Die-Hards, for the pickets were also brought in, two others taking their
  places. There was Thomas Yownie, the Chief of Staff, with a wrist wound up in
  the handkerchief which he had borrowed from his neck. There was a burly lad
  who wore trousers much too large for him, and who was known as Peer Pairson,
  a contraction presumably for Peter Paterson. After him came a lean tall boy
  who answered to the name of Napoleon. There was a midget of a child,
  desperately sooty in the face either from battle or from fire-tending, who
  was presented as Wee Jaikie. Last came the picket who had held his pole at
  Dickson's chest, a sandy-haired warrior with a snub nose and the mouth and
  jaw of a pug-dog. He was Old Bill, or, in Dougal's parlance, "Auld Bull."</p>

  <p>The Chieftain viewed his scarred following with a grim content. "That's a
  tough lot for ye, Mr. McCunn. Used a' their days wi' sleepin' in coal-rees
  and dunnies and dodgin' the polis. Ye'll no beat the Gorbals Die-Hards."</p>

  <p>"You're right, Dougal," said Dickson. "There's just the six of you. If
  there were a dozen, I think this country would be needing some new kind of a
  government."</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref10"
     id="ref10">CHAPTER 8</a></h3>

  <h2>HOW A MIDDLE-AGED CRUSADER<br>
  ACCEPTED A CHALLENGE</h2>

  <p>The first cocks had just begun to crow and clocks had not yet struck five
  when Dickson presented himself at Mrs. Morran's back door. That active woman
  had already been half an hour out of bed, and was drinking her morning cup of
  tea in the kitchen. She received him with cordiality, nay, with relief.</p>

  <p>"Eh, sir, but I'm glad to see ye back. Guid kens what's gaun on at the
  Hoose thae days. Mr. Heritage left here yestreen, creepin' round by
  dyke-sides and berry-busses like a wheasel. It's a mercy to get a responsible
  man in the place. I aye had a notion ye wad come back, for, thinks I, nevoy
  Dickson is no the yin to desert folk in trouble...  Whaur's my wee kist?...
  Lost, ye say. That's a peety, for it's been my cheesebox thae thirty
  year."</p>

  <p>Dickson ascended to the loft, having announced his need of at least three
  hours' sleep. As he rolled into bed his mind was curiously at ease. He felt
  equipped for any call that might be made on him. That Mrs. Morran should
  welcome him back as a resource in need gave him a new assurance of
  manhood.</p>

  <p>He woke between nine and ten to the sound of rain lashing against the
  garret window. As he picked his way out of the mazes of sleep and recovered
  the skein of his immediate past, he found to his disgust that he had lost his
  composure. All the flock of fears, that had left him when on the top of the
  Glasgow tram-car he had made the great decision, had flown back again and
  settled like black crows on his spirit. He was running a horrible risk and
  all for a whim. What business had he to be mixing himself up in things he did
  not understand? It might be a huge mistake, and then he would be a laughing
  stock; for a moment he repented his telegram to Mr. Caw. Then he recanted
  that suspicion; there could be no mistake, except the fatal one that he had
  taken on a job too big for him. He sat on the edge of the bed and shivered
  with his eyes on the grey drift of rain. He would have felt more
  stout-hearted had the sun been shining.</p>

  <p>He shuffled to the window and looked out. There in the village street was
  Dobson, and Dobson saw him. That was a bad blunder, for his reason told him
  that he should have kept his presence in Dalquharter hid as long as possible.
  There was a knock at the cottage door, and presently Mrs. Morran
  appeared.</p>

  <p>"It's the man frae the inn," she announced. "He's wantin' a word wi' ye.
  Speakin' verra ceevil, too."</p>

  <p>"Tell him to come up," said Dickson. He might as well get the interview
  over. Dobson had seen Loudon and must know of their conversation. The sight
  of himself back again when he had pretended to be off to Glasgow would remove
  him effectually from the class of the unsuspected. He wondered just what line
  Dobson would take.</p>

  <p>The innkeeper obtruded his bulk through the low door. His face was
  wrinkled into a smile, which nevertheless left the small eyes ungenial. His
  voice had a loud vulgar cordiality. Suddenly Dickson was conscious of a
  resemblance, a resemblance to somebody whom he had recently seen. It was
  Loudon. There was the same thrusting of the chin forward, the same odd
  cheek-bones, the same unctuous heartiness of speech. The innkeeper, well
  washed and polished and dressed, would be no bad copy of the factor. They
  must be near kin, perhaps brothers.</p>

  <p>"Good morning to you, Mr. McCunn. Man, it's pitifu' weather, and just when
  the farmers are wanting a dry seed-bed. What brings ye back here? Ye travel
  the country like a drover."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm a free man now and I took a fancy to this place. An idle body has
  nothing to do but please himself."</p>

  <p>"I hear ye're taking a lease of Huntingtower?"</p>

  <p>"Now who told you that?"</p>

  <p>"Just the clash of the place. Is it true?"</p>

  <p>Dickson looked sly and a little annoyed.</p>

  <p>"I had maybe had half a thought of it, but I'll thank you not to repeat
  the story. It's a big house for a plain man like me, and I haven't properly
  inspected it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll keep mum, never fear. But if ye've that sort of notion, I can
  understand you not being able to keep away from the place."</p>

  <p>"That's maybe the fact," Dickson admitted.</p>

  <p>"Well! It's just on that point I want a word with you." The innkeeper
  seated himself unbidden on the chair which held Dickson's modest raiment. He
  leaned forward and with a coarse forefinger tapped Dickson's pyjama-clad
  knees. "I can't have ye wandering about the place. I'm very sorry, but I've
  got my orders from Mr. Loudon. So if you think that by bidin' here you can
  see more of the House and the policies, ye're wrong, Mr. McCunn. It can't be
  allowed, for we're no' ready for ye yet. D'ye understand? That's Mr. Loudon's
  orders...  Now, would it not be a far better plan if ye went back to Glasgow
  and came back in a week's time? I'm thinking of your own comfort, Mr.
  McCunn."</p>

  <p>Dickson was cogitating hard. This man was clearly instructed to get rid of
  him at all costs for the next few days. The neighbourhood had to be cleared
  for some black business. The tinklers had been deputed to drive out the
  Gorbals Die-Hards, and as for Heritage they seemed to have lost track of him.
  He, Dickson, was now the chief object of their care. But what could Dobson do
  if he refused? He dared not show his true hand. Yet he might, if sufficiently
  irritated. It became Dickson's immediate object to get the innkeeper to
  reveal himself by rousing his temper. He did not stop to consider the policy
  of this course; he imperatively wanted things cleared up and the issue made
  plain.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I'm much obliged to you for thinking so much about my comfort,"
  he said in a voice into which he hoped he had insinuated a sneer. "But I'm
  bound to say you're awful suspicious folk about here. You needn't be feared
  for your old policies. There's plenty of nice walks about the roads, and I
  want to explore the sea-coast."</p>

  <p>The last words seemed to annoy the innkeeper. "That's no' allowed either,"
  he said. "The shore's as private as the policies...  Well, I wish ye joy
  tramping the roads in the glaur."</p>

  <p>"It's a queer thing," said Dickson meditatively, "that you should keep a
  hotel and yet be set on discouraging people from visiting this neighbourhood.
  I tell you what, I believe that hotel of yours is all sham. You've some other
  business, you and these lodgekeepers, and in my opinion it's not a very
  creditable one."</p>

  <p>"What d'ye mean?" asked Dobson sharply.</p>

  <p>"Just what I say. You must expect a body to be suspicious, if you treat
  him as you're treating me." Loudon must have told this man the story with
  which he had been fobbed off about the half-witted Kennedy relative. Would
  Dobson refer to that?</p>

  <p>The innkeeper had an ugly look on his face, but he controlled his temper
  with an effort.</p>

  <p>"There's no cause for suspicion," he said. "As far as I'm concerned it's
  all honest and above-board."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't look like it. It looks as if you were hiding something up in
  the House which you don't want me to see."</p>

  <p>Dobson jumped from his chair. his face pale with anger. A man in pyjamas
  on a raw morning does not feel at this bravest, and Dickson quailed under the
  expectation of assault. But even in his fright he realized that Loudon could
  not have told Dobson the tale of the half-witted lady. The last remark had
  cut clean through all camouflage and reached the quick.</p>

  <p>"What the hell d'ye mean?" he cried. "Ye're a spy, are ye? Ye fat little
  fool, for two cents I'd wring your neck."</p>

  <p>Now it is an odd trait of certain mild people that a suspicion of threat,
  a hint of bullying, will rouse some unsuspected obstinacy deep down in their
  souls. The insolence of the man's speech woke a quiet but efficient little
  devil in Dickson.</p>

  <p>"That's a bonny tone to adopt in addressing a gentleman. If you've nothing
  to hide what way are you so touchy? I can't be a spy unless there's something
  to spy on."</p>

  <p>The innkeeper pulled himself together. He was apparently acting on
  instructions, and had not yet come to the end of them. He made an attempt at
  a smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I beg your pardon if I spoke too hot. But it nettled me to hear
  ye say that...  I'll be quite frank with ye, Mr. McCunn, and, believe me, I'm
  speaking in your best interests. I give ye my word there's nothing wrong up
  at the House. I'm on the side of the law, and when I tell ye the whole story
  ye'll admit it. But I can't tell it ye yet...  This is a wild, lonely bit,
  and very few folk bide in it. And these are wild times, when a lot of queer
  things happen that never get into the papers. I tell ye it's for your own
  good to leave Dalquharter for the present. More I can't say, but I ask ye to
  look at it as a sensible man. Ye're one that's accustomed to a quiet life and
  no' meant for rough work. Ye'll do no good if you stay, and, maybe, ye'll
  land yourself in bad trouble."</p>

  <p>"Mercy on us!" Dickson exclaimed. "What is it you're expecting? Sinn
  Fein?"</p>

  <p>The innkeeper nodded. "Something like that."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever hear the like? I never did think much of the Irish."</p>

  <p>"Then ye'll take my advice and go home? Tell ye what, I'll drive ye to the
  station."</p>

  <p>Dickson got up from the bed, found his new safety-razor and began to strop
  it. "No, I think I'll bide. If you're right there'll be more to see than
  glaury roads."</p>

  <p>"I'm warning ye, fair and honest. Ye...  can't...  be...  allowed...  to
 ...  stay...  here!"</p>

  <p>"Well I never!" said Dickson. "Is there any law in Scotland, think you,
  that forbids a man to stop a day or two with his auntie?"</p>

  <p>"Ye'll stay?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, I'll stay."</p>

  <p>"By God, we'll see about that."</p>

  <p>For a moment Dickson thought that he would be attacked, and he measured
  the distance that separated him from the peg whence hung his waterproof with
  the pistol in its pocket. But the man restrained himself and moved to the
  door. There he stood and cursed him with a violence and a venom which Dickson
  had not believed possible. The full hand was on the table now.</p>

  <p>"Ye wee pot-bellied, pig-heided Glasgow grocer" (I paraphrase), "would you
  set up to defy me? I tell ye, I'll make ye rue the day ye were born." His
  parting words were a brilliant sketch of the maltreatment in store for the
  body of the defiant one.</p>

  <p>"Impident dog," said Dickson without heat. He noted with pleasure that the
  innkeeper hit his head violently against the low lintel, and, missing a step,
  fell down the loft stairs into the kitchen, where Mrs. Morran's tongue could
  be heard speeding him trenchantly from the premises.</p>

  <p>Left to himself, Dickson dressed leisurely, and by and by went down to the
  kitchen and watched his hostess making broth. The fracas with Dobson had done
  him all the good in the world, for it had cleared the problem of dubieties
  and had put an edge on his temper. But he realized that it made his continued
  stay in the cottage undesirable. He was now the focus of all suspicion, and
  the innkeeper would be as good as his word and try to drive him out of the
  place by force. Kidnapping, most likely, and that would be highly unpleasant,
  besides putting an end to his usefulness. Clearly he must join the others.
  The soul of Dickson hungered at the moment for human companionship. He felt
  that his courage would be sufficient for any team-work, but might waver again
  if he were left to play a lone hand.</p>

  <p>He lunched nobly off three plates of Mrs. Morran's kail&mdash;an early
  lunch, for that lady, having breakfasted at five, partook of the midday meal
  about eleven. Then he explored her library, and settled himself by the fire
  with a volume of Covenanting tales, entitled <i>Gleanings Among the
  Mountains</i>. It was a most practical work for one in his position, for it
  told how various eminent saints of that era escaped the attention of
  Claverhouse's dragoons. Dickson stored up in his memory several of the
  incidents in case they should come in handy. He wondered if any of his
  forbears had been Covenanters; it comforted him to think that some old
  progenitor might have hunkered behind turf walls and been chased for his life
  in the heather. "Just like me," he reflected. "But the dragoons weren't
  foreigners, and there was a kind of decency about Claverhouse too."</p>

  <p>About four o'clock Dougal presented himself in the back kitchen. He was an
  even wilder figure than usual, for his bare legs were mud to the knees, his
  kilt and shirt clung sopping to his body, and, having lost his hat, his wet
  hair was plastered over his eyes. Mrs. Morran said, not unkindly, that he
  looked "like a wull-cat glowerin' through a whin buss."</p>

  <p>"How are you, Dougal?" Dickson asked genially. "Is the peace of nature
  smoothing out the creases in your poor little soul?"</p>

  <p>"What's that ye say?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, just what I heard a man say in Glasgow. How have you got on?"</p>

  <p>"No' so bad. Your telegram was sent this mornin'. Auld Bill took it in to
  Kirkmichael. That's the first thing. Second, Thomas Yownie has took a party
  to get down the box from the station. He got Mrs. Sempills' powny, and he
  took the box ayont the Laver by the ford at the herd's hoose and got it on to
  the shore maybe a mile ayont Laverfoot. He managed to get the machine up as
  far as the water, but he could get no farther, for ye'll no' get a machine
  over the wee waterfa' just before the Laver ends in the sea. So he sent one
  o' the men back with it to Mrs. Sempill, and, since the box was ower heavy to
  carry, he opened it and took the stuff across in bits. It's a' safe in the
  hole at the foot o' the Huntingtower rocks, and he reports that the rain has
  done it no harm. Thomas has made a good job of it. Ye'll no' fickle Thomas
  Yownie."</p>

  <p>"And what about your camp on the moor?"</p>

  <p>"It was broke up afore daylight. Some of our things we've got with us, but
  most is hid near at hand. The tents are in the auld wife's hen-hoose." and he
  jerked his disreputable head in the direction of the back door.</p>

  <p>"Have the tinklers been back?"</p>

  <p>"Aye. They turned up about ten o'clock, no doubt intendin' murder. I left
  Wee Jaikie to watch developments. They fund him sittin' on a stone, greetin'
  sore. When he saw them, he up and started to run, and they cried on him to
  stop, but he wouldn't listen. Then they cried out where were the rest, and he
  telled them they were feared for their lives and had run away. After that
  they offered to catch him, but ye'll no' catch Jaikie in a hurry. When he had
  run round about them till they were wappit, he out wi' his catty and got one
  o' them on the lug. Syne he made for the Laverfoot and reported."</p>

  <p>"Man, Dougal, you've managed fine. Now I've something to tell you," and
  Dickson recounted his interview with the innkeeper. "I don't think it's safe
  for me to bide here, and if I did, I wouldn't be any use, hiding in cellars
  and such like, and not daring to stir a foot. I'm coming with you to the
  House. Now tell me how to get there."</p>

  <p>Dougal agreed to this view. "There's been nothing doing at the Hoose the
  day, but they're keepin' a close watch on the policies. The cripus may come
  any moment. There's no doubt, Mr. McCunn, that ye're in danger, for they'll
  serve you as the tinklers tried to serve us. Listen to me. Ye'll walk up the
  station road, and take the second turn on your left, a wee grass road that'll
  bring ye to the ford at the herd's hoose. Cross the Laver&mdash;there's a
  plank bridge&mdash;and take straight across the moor in the direction of the
  peakit hill they call Grey Carrick. Ye'll come to a big burn, which ye must
  follow till ye get to the shore. Then turn south, keepin' the water's edge
  till ye reach the Laver, where you'll find one o' us to show ye the rest of
  the road...  I must be off now, and I advise ye not to be slow of startin',
  for wi' this rain the water's risin' quick. It's a mercy it's such coarse
  weather, for it spoils the veesibility."</p>

  <p>"Auntie Phemie," said Dickson a few minutes later, "will you oblige me by
  coming for a short walk?"</p>

  <p>"The man's daft," was the answer.</p>

  <p>"I'm not. I'll explain if you'll listen...  You see," he concluded, "the
  dangerous bit for me is just the mile out of the village. They'll no' be so
  likely to try violence if there's somebody with me that could be a witness.
  Besides, they'll maybe suspect less if they just see a decent body out for a
  breath of air with his auntie."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Morran said nothing, but retired, and returned presently equipped for
  the road. She had indued her feet with galoshes and pinned up her skirts till
  they looked like some demented Paris mode. An ancient bonnet was tied under
  her chin with strings, and her equipment was completed by an exceedingly
  smart tortoise-shell-handled umbrella, which, she explained, had been a
  Christmas present from her son.</p>

  <p>"I'll convoy ye as far as the Laverfoot herd's," she announced. "The
  wife's a freend o' mine and will set me a bit on the road back. Ye needna
  fash for me. I'm used to a' weathers."</p>

  <p>The rain had declined to a fine drizzle, but a tearing wind from the
  south-west scoured the land. Beyond the shelter of the trees the moor was a
  battle-ground of gusts which swept the puddles into spindrift and gave to the
  stagnant bog-pools the appearance of running water. The wind was behind the
  travellers, and Mrs. Morran, like a full-rigged ship, was hustled before it,
  so that Dickson, who had linked arms with her, was sometimes compelled to
  trot.</p>

  <p>"However will you get home, mistress?" he murmured anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Fine. The wind will fa' at the darkenin'. This'll be a sair time for
  ships at sea."</p>

  <p>Not a soul was about, so they breasted the ascent of the station road and
  turned down the grassy bypath to the Laverfoot herd's. The herd's wife saw
  them from afar and was at the door to receive them.</p>

  <p>"Megsty! Phemie Morran!" she shrilled. "Wha wad ettle to see ye on a day
  like this? John's awa' at Dumfries, buyin' tups. Come in, the baith o' ye.
  The kettle's on the boil."</p>

  <p>"This is my nevoy Dickson," said Mrs. Morran. "He's gaun to stretch his
  legs ayont the burn, and come back by the Ayr road. But I'll be blithe to
  tak' my tea wi' ye, Elspeth...  Now, Dickson, I'll expect ye hame on the chap
  o' seeven."</p>

  <p>He crossed the rising stream on a swaying plank and struck into the
  moorland, as Dougal had ordered, keeping the bald top of Grey Carrick before
  him. In that wild place with the tempest battling overhead he had no fear of
  human enemies. Steadily he covered the ground, till he reached the
  west-flowing burn, that was to lead him to the shore. He found it an
  entertaining companion, swirling into black pools, foaming over little falls,
  and lying in dark canal-like stretches in the flats. Presently it began to
  descend steeply in a narrow green gully, where the going was bad, and
  Dickson, weighted with pack and waterproof, had much ado to keep his feet on
  the sodden slopes. Then, as he rounded a crook of hill, the ground fell away
  from his feet, the burn swept in a water-slide to the boulders of the shore,
  and the storm-tossed sea lay before him.</p>

  <p>It was now that he began to feel nervous. Being on the coast again seemed
  to bring him inside his enemies' territory, and had not Dobson specifically
  forbidden the shore? It was here that they might be looking for him. He felt
  himself out of condition, very wet and very warm, but he attained a
  creditable pace, for he struck a road which had been used by manure-carts
  collecting seaweed. There were faint marks on it, which he took to be the
  wheels of Dougal's "machine" carrying the provision-box. Yes. On a patch of
  gravel there was a double set of tracks, which showed how it had returned to
  Mrs. Sempill. He was exposed to the full force of the wind, and the
  strenuousness of his bodily exertions kept his fears quiescent, till the
  cliffs on his left sunk suddenly and the valley of the Laver lay before
  him.</p>

  <p>A small figure rose from the shelter of a boulder, the warrior who bore
  the name of Old Bill. He saluted gravely.</p>

  <p>"Ye're just in time. The water has rose three inches since I've been here.
  Ye'd better strip."</p>

  <p>Dickson removed his boots and socks. "Breeks too," commanded the boy;
  "there's deep holes ayont thae stanes."</p>

  <p>Dickson obeyed, feeling very chilly, and rather improper. "Now follow me,"
  said the guide. The next moment he was stepping delicately on very sharp
  pebbles, holding on to the end of the scout's pole, while an icy stream ran
  to his knees.</p>

  <p>The Laver as it reaches the sea broadens out to the width of fifty or
  sixty yards and tumbles over little shelves of rock to meet the waves.
  Usually it is shallow, but now it was swollen to an average depth of a foot
  or more, and there were deeper pockets. Dickson made the passage slowly and
  miserably, sometimes crying out with pain as his toes struck a sharper flint,
  once or twice sitting down on a boulder to blow like a whale, once slipping
  on his knees and wetting the strange excrescence about his middle, which was
  his tucked-up waterproof. But the crossing was at length achieved, and on a
  patch of sea-pinks he dried himself perfunctorily and hastily put on his
  garments. Old Bill, who seemed to be regardless of wind or water, squatted
  beside him and whistled through his teeth.</p>

  <p>Above them hung the sheer cliffs of the Huntingtower cape, so sheer that a
  man below was completely hidden from any watcher on the top. Dickson's heart
  fell, for he did not profess to be a cragsman and had indeed a horror of
  precipitous places. But as the two scrambled along the foot, they passed
  deep-cut gullies and fissures, most of them unclimbable, but offering
  something more hopeful than the face. At one of these Old Bill halted, and
  led the way up and over a chaos of fallen rock and loose sand. The grey
  weather had brought on the dark prematurely, and in the half-light it seemed
  that this ravine was blocked by an unscalable nose of rock. Here Old Bill
  whistled, and there was a reply from above. Round the corner of the nose came
  Dougal.</p>

  <p>"Up here," he commanded. "It was Mr. Heritage that fund this road."</p>

  <p>Dickson and his guide squeezed themselves between the nose and the cliff
  up a spout of stones, and found themselves in an upper storey of the gulley,
  very steep, but practicable even for one who was no cragsman. This in turn
  ran out against a wall up which there led only a narrow chimney. At the foot
  of this were two of the Die-Hards, and there were others above, for a rope
  hung down, by the aid of which a package was even now ascending.</p>

  <p>"That's the top," said Dougal, pointing to the rim of sky, "and that's the
  last o' the supplies." Dickson noticed that he spoke in a whisper, and that
  all the movements of the Die-Hards were judicious and stealthy. "Now, it's
  your turn. Take a good grip o' the rope, and ye'll find plenty holes for your
  feet. It's no more than ten yards and ye're well held above."</p>

  <p>Dickson made the attempt and found it easier than he expected. The only
  trouble was his pack and waterproof, which had a tendency to catch on jags of
  rock. A hand was reached out to him, he was pulled over the edge, and then
  pushed down on his face. When he lifted his head Dougal and the others had
  joined him, and the whole company of the Die-Hards was assembled on a patch
  of grass which was concealed from the landward view by a thicket of hazels.
  Another, whom he recognized as Heritage, was coiling up the rope.</p>

  <p>"We'd better get all the stuff into the old Tower for the present,"
  Heritage was saying. "It's too risky to move it into the House now. We'll
  need the thickest darkness for that, after the moon is down. Quick, for the
  beastly thing will be rising soon, and before that we must all be
  indoors."</p>

  <p>Then he turned to Dickson and gripped his hand. "You're a high class of
  sportsman, Dogson. And I think you're just in time."</p>

  <p>"Are they due to-night?" Dickson asked in an excited whisper, faint
  against the wind.</p>

  <p>"I don't know about They. But I've got a notion that some devilish queer
  things will happen before to-morrow morning."</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref11"
     id="ref11">CHAPTER 9</a></h3>

  <h2>THE FIRST BATTLE OF THE CRUIVES</h2>

  <p>The old keep of Huntingtower stood some three hundred yards from the edge
  of the cliffs, a gnarled wood of hazels and oaks protecting it from the
  sea-winds. It was still in fair preservation, having till twenty years before
  been an adjunct of the house of Dalquharter, and used as kitchen, buttery,
  and servants' quarters. There had been residential wings attached, dating
  from the mid-eighteenth century, but these had been pulled down and used for
  the foundations of the new mansion. Now it stood a lonely shell, its three
  storeys, each a single great room connected by a spiral stone staircase,
  being dedicated to lumber and the storage of produce. But it was dry and
  intact, its massive oak doors defied any weapon short of artillery, its
  narrow unglazed windows would scarcely have admitted a cat&mdash;a place
  portentously strong, gloomy, but yet habitable.</p>

  <p>Dougal opened the main door with a massy key. "The lassie fund it," he
  whispered to Dickson, "somewhere about the kitchen&mdash;and I guessed it was
  the key o' this castle. I was thinkin' that if things got ower hot it would
  be a good plan to flit here. Change our base, like." The Chieftain's
  occasional studies in war had trained his tongue to a military jargon.</p>

  <p>In the ground room lay a fine assortment of oddments, including old
  bedsteads and servants' furniture, and what looked like ancient discarded
  deerskin rugs. Dust lay thick over everything, and they heard the scurry of
  rats. A dismal place, indeed, but Dickson felt only its strangeness. The
  comfort of being back again among allies had quickened his spirit to an
  adventurous mood. The old lords of Huntingtower had once quarrelled and
  revelled and plotted here, and now here he was at the same game. Present and
  past joined hands over the gulf of years. The saga of Huntingtower was not
  ended.</p>

  <p>The Die-Hards had brought with them their scanty bedding, their lanterns
  and camp-kettles. These and the provisions from Mearns Street were stowed
  away in a corner.</p>

  <p>"Now for the Hoose, men," said Dougal. They stole over the downs to the
  shrubbery, and Dickson found himself almost in the same place as he had lain
  in three days before, watching a dusky lawn, while the wet earth soaked
  through his trouser knees and the drip from the azaleas trickled over his
  spine. Two of the boys fetched the ladder and placed it against the verandah
  wall. Heritage first, then Dickson, darted across the lawn and made the
  ascent. The six scouts followed, and the ladder was pulled up and hidden
  among the verandah litter. For a second the whole eight stood still and
  listened. There was no sound except the murmur of the now falling wind and
  the melancholy hooting of owls. The garrison had entered the Dark Tower.</p>

  <p>A council in whispers was held in the garden-room.</p>

  <p>"Nobody must show a light," Heritage observed. "It mustn't be known that
  we're here. Only the Princess will have a lamp. Yes"&mdash;this in answer to
  Dickson&mdash;"she knows that we're coming&mdash;you too. We'll hunt for
  quarters later upstairs. You scouts, you must picket every possible entrance.
  The windows are safe, I think, for they are locked from the inside. So is the
  main door. But there's the verandah door, of which they have a key, and the
  back door beside the kitchen, and I'm not at all sure that there's not a way
  in by the boiler-house. You understand. We're holding his place against all
  comers. We must barricade the danger points. The headquarters of the garrison
  will be in the hall, where a scout must be always on duty. You've all got
  whistles? Well, if there's an attempt on the verandah door the picket will
  whistle once, if at the back door twice, if anywhere else three times, and
  it's everybody's duty, except the picket who whistles, to get back to the
  hall for orders."</p>

  <p>"That's so," assented Dougal.</p>

  <p>"If the enemy forces an entrance we must overpower him. Any means you
  like. Sticks or fists, and remember if it's a scrap in the dark to make for
  the man's throat. I expect you little devils have eyes like cats. The
  scoundrels must be kept away from the ladies at all costs. If the worst comes
  to the worst, the Princess has a revolver."</p>

  <p>"So have I," said Dickson. "I got it in Glasgow."</p>

  <p>"The deuce you have! Can you use it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"Well, you can hand it over to me, if you like. But it oughtn't to come to
  shooting, if it's only the three of them. The eight of us should be able to
  manage three and one of them lame. If the others turn up&mdash;well, God help
  us all! But we've got to make sure of one thing, that no one lays hands on
  the Princess so long as there's one of us left alive to hit out."</p>

  <p>"Ye needn't be feared for that," said Dougal. There was no light in the
  room, but Dickson was certain that the morose face of the Chieftain was lit
  with unholy joy.</p>

  <p>"Then off with you. Mr. McCunn and I will explain matters to the
  ladies."</p>

  <p>When they were alone, Heritage's voice took a different key. "We're in for
  it, Dogson, old man. There's no doubt these three scoundrels expect
  reinforcements at any moment, and with them will be one who is the devil
  incarnate. He's the only thing on earth that that brave girl fears. It seems
  he is in love with her and has pestered her for years. She hated the sight of
  him, but he wouldn't take no, and being a powerful man&mdash;rich and
  well-born and all the rest of it&mdash;she had a desperate time. I gather he
  was pretty high in favour with the old Court. Then when the Bolsheviks
  started he went over to them, like plenty of other grandees, and now he's one
  of their chief brains&mdash;none of your callow revolutionaries, but a man of
  the world, a kind of genius, she says, who can hold his own anywhere. She
  believes him to be in this country, and only waiting the right moment to turn
  up. Oh, it sounds ridiculous, I know, in Britain in the twentieth century,
  but I learned in the war that civilization anywhere is a very thin crust.
  There are a hundred ways by which that kind of fellow could bamboozle all our
  law and police and spirit her away. That's the kind of crowd we have to
  face."</p>

  <p>"Did she say what he was like in appearance?"</p>

  <p>"A face like an angel&mdash;a lost angel, she says."</p>

  <p>Dickson suddenly had an inspiration.</p>

  <p>"D'you mind the man you said was an Australian&mdash;at Kirkmichael? I
  thought myself he was a foreigner. Well, he was asking for a place he called
  Darkwater, and there's no sich place in the countryside. I believe he meant
  Dalquharter. I believe he's the man she's feared of."</p>

  <p>A gasped "By Jove!" came from the darkness. "Dogson, you've hit it. That
  was five days ago, and he must have got on the right trail by this time.
  He'll be here to-night. That's why the three have been lying so quiet to-day.
  Well, we'll go through with it, even if we haven't a dog's chance! Only I'm
  sorry that you should be mixed up in such a hopeless business."</p>

  <p>"Why me more than you?"</p>

  <p>"Because it's all pure pride and joy for me to be here. Good God, I
  wouldn't be elsewhere for worlds. It's the great hour of my life. I would
  gladly die for her."</p>

  <p>"Tuts, that's no' the way to talk, man. Time enough to speak about dying
  when there's no other way out. I'm looking at this thing in a business way.
  We'd better be seeing the ladies."</p>

  <p>They groped into the pitchy hall, somewhere in which a Die-Hard was on
  picket, and down the passage to the smoking-room. Dickson blinked in the
  light of a very feeble lamp and Heritage saw that his hands were cumbered
  with packages. He deposited them on a sofa and made a ducking bow.</p>

  <p>"I've come back, Mem, and glad to be back. Your jools are in safe keeping,
  and not all the blagyirds in creation could get at them. I've come to tell
  you to cheer up&mdash;a stout heart to a stey brae, as the old folk say. I'm
  handling this affair as a business proposition, so don't be feared, Mem. If
  there are enemies seeking you, there's friends on the road too...  Now,
  you'll have had your dinner, but you'd maybe like a little dessert."</p>

  <p>He spread before them a huge box of chocolates, the best that Mearns
  Street could produce, a box of candied fruits, and another of salted almonds.
  Then from his hideously overcrowded pockets he took another box, which he
  offered rather shyly. "That's some powder for your complexion. They tell me
  that ladies find it useful whiles."</p>

  <p>The girl's strained face watched him at first in mystification, and then
  broke slowly into a smile. Youth came back into it, the smile changed to a
  laugh, a low rippling laugh like far-away bells. She took both his hands.</p>

  <p>"You are kind,' she said, "you are kind and brave. You are a de-ar."</p>

  <p>And then she kissed him.</p>

  <p>Now, as far as Dickson could remember, no one had ever kissed him except
  his wife. The light touch of her lips on his forehead was like the pressing
  of an electric button which explodes some powerful charge and alters the face
  of a countryside. He blushed scarlet; then he wanted to cry; then he wanted
  to sing. An immense exhilaration seized him, and I am certain that if at that
  moment the serried ranks of Bolshevy had appeared in the doorway, Dickson
  would have hurled himself upon them with a joyful shout.</p>

  <p>Cousin Eugenie was earnestly eating chocolates, but Saskia had other
  business.</p>

  <p>"You will hold the house?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Please God, yes," said Heritage. "I look at it this way. The time is very
  near when your three gaolers expect the others, their masters. They have not
  troubled you in the past two days as they threatened, because it was not
  worth while. But they won't want to let you out of their sight in the final
  hours, so they will almost certainly come here to be on the spot. Our object
  is to keep them out and confuse their plans. Somewhere in this neighbourhood,
  probably very near, is the man you fear most. If we nonplus the three
  watchers, they'll have to revise their policy, and that means a delay, and
  every hour's delay is a gain. Mr. McCunn has found out that the factor Loudon
  is in the plot, and he has purchase enough, it seems, to blanket for a time
  any appeal to the law. But Mr. McCunn has taken steps to circumvent him, and
  in twenty-four hours we should have help here."</p>

  <p>"I do not want the help of your law," the girl interrupted. "It will
  entangle me.'</p>

  <p>"Not a bit of it," said Dickson cheerfully. "You see, Mem, they've clean
  lost track of the jools, and nobody knows where they are but me. I'm a
  truthful man, but I'll lie like a packman if I'm asked questions. For the
  rest, it's a question of kidnapping, I understand, and that's a thing that's
  not to be allowed. My advice is to go to our beds and get a little sleep
  while there's a chance of it. The Gorbals Die-Hards are grand
  watch-dogs."</p>

  <p>This view sounded so reasonable that it was at once acted upon. The
  ladies' chamber was next door to the smoking-room&mdash;what had been the old
  schoolroom. Heritage arranged with Saskia that the lamp was to be kept
  burning low, and that on no account were they to move unless summoned by him.
  Then he and Dickson made their way to the hall, where there was a faint
  glimmer from the moon in the upper unshuttered windows&mdash;enough to reveal
  the figure of Wee Jaikie on duty at the foot of the staircase. They ascended
  to the second floor, where, in a large room above the hall, Heritage had
  bestowed his pack. He had managed to open a fold of the shutters, and there
  was sufficient light to see two big mahogany bedsteads without mattresses or
  bedclothes, and wardrobes and chests of drawers sheeted in holland. Outside
  the wind was rising again, but the rain had stopped. Angry watery clouds
  scurried across the heavens.</p>

  <p>Dickson made a pillow of his waterproof, stretched himself on one of the
  bedsteads, and, so quiet was his conscience and so weary his body from the
  buffetings of the past days, was almost instantly asleep. It seemed to him
  that he had scarcely closed his eyes when he was awakened by Dougal's hand
  pinching his shoulder. He gathered that the moon was setting, for the room
  was pitchy dark.</p>

  <p>"The three o' them is approachin' the kitchen door," whispered the
  Chieftain. "I seen them from a spy-hole I made out o' a ventilator."</p>

  <p>"Is it barricaded?" asked Heritage, who had apparently not been
  asleep.</p>

  <p>"Aye, but I've thought o' a far better plan. Why should we keep them out?
  They'll be safer inside. Listen! We might manage to get them in one at a
  time. If they can't get in at the kitchen door, they'll send one o' them
  round to get in by another door and open to them. That gives us a chance to
  get them separated, and lock them up. There's walth o' closets and hidy-holes
  all over the place, each with good doors and good keys to them. Supposin' we
  get the three o' them shut up&mdash;the others, when they come, will have
  nobody to guide them. Of course some time or other the three will break out,
  but it may be ower late for them. At present we're besieged and they're
  roamin' the country. Would it no' be far better if they were the ones lockit
  up and we were goin' loose?"</p>

  <p>"Supposing they don't come in one at a time?" Dickson objected.</p>

  <p>"We'll make them," said Dougal firmly. "There's no time to waste. Are ye
  for it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Heritage. "Who's at the kitchen door?"</p>

  <p>"Peter Paterson. I told him no' to whistle, but to wait on me...  Keep
  your boots off. Ye're better in your stockin' feet. Wait you in the hall and
  see ye're well hidden, for likely whoever comes in will have a lantern. Just
  you keep quiet unless I give ye a cry. I've planned it a' out, and we're
  ready for them."</p>

  <p>Dougal disappeared, and Dickson and Heritage, with their boots tied round
  their necks by their laces, crept out to the upper landing. The hall was
  impenetrably dark, but full of voices, for the wind was talking in the
  ceiling beams, and murmuring through the long passages. The walls creaked and
  muttered and little bits of plaster fluttered down. The noise was an
  advantage for the game of hide-and-seek they proposed to play, but it made it
  hard to detect the enemy's approach. Dickson, in order to get properly
  wakened, adventured as far as the smoking-room. It was black with night, but
  below the door of the adjacent room a faint line of light showed where the
  Princess's lamp was burning. He advanced to the window, and heard distinctly
  a foot on the grovel path that led to the verandah. This sent him back to the
  hall in search of Dougal, whom he encountered in the passage. That boy could
  certainly see in the dark, for he caught Dickson's wrist without
  hesitation.</p>

  <p>"We've got Spittal in the wine-cellar," he whispered triumphantly. "The
  kitchen door was barricaded, and when they tried it, it wouldn't open. 'Bide
  here,' says Dobson to Spittal, 'and we'll go round by another door and come
  back and open to ye.' So off they went, and by that time Peter Paterson and
  me had the barricade down. As we expected, Spittal tries the key again and it
  opens quite easy. He comes in and locks it behind him, and, Dobson having
  took away the lantern, he gropes his way very carefu' towards the kitchen.
  There's a point where the wine-cellar door and the scullery door are aside
  each other. He should have taken the second, but I had it shut so he takes
  the first. Peter Paterson gave him a wee shove and he fell down the two-three
  steps into the cellar, and we turned the key on him. Yon cellar has a grand
  door and no windies."</p>

  <p>"And Dobson and Leon are at the verandah door? With a light?"</p>

  <p>"Thomas Yownie's on duty there. Ye can trust him. Ye'll no fickle Thomas
  Yownie."</p>

  <p>The next minutes were for Dickson a delirium of excitement not
  unpleasantly shot with flashes of doubt and fear. As a child he had played
  hide-and-seek, and his memory had always cherished the delights of the game.
  But how marvellous to play it thus in a great empty house, at dark of night,
  with the heaven filled with tempest, and with death or wounds as the
  stakes!</p>

  <p>He took refuge in a corner where a tapestry curtain and the side of a
  Dutch awmry gave him shelter, and from where he stood he could see the
  garden-room and the beginning of the tiled passage which led to the verandah
  door. That is to say, he could have seen these things if there had been any
  light, which there was not. He heard the soft flitting of bare feet, for a
  delicate sound is often audible in a din when a loud noise is obscured. Then
  a gale of wind blew towards him, as from an open door, and far away gleamed
  the flickering light of a lantern.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the light disappeared and there was a clatter on the floor and a
  breaking of glass. Either the wind or Thomas Yownie.</p>

  <p>The verandah door was shut, a match spluttered and the lantern was relit.
  Dobson and Leon came into the hall, both clad in long mackintoshes which
  glistened from the weather. Dobson halted and listened to the wind howling in
  the upper spaces. He cursed it bitterly, looked at his watch, and then made
  an observation which woke the liveliest interest in Dickson lurking beside
  the awmry and Heritage ensconced in the shadow of a window-seat.</p>

  <p>"He's late. He should have been here five minutes syne. It would be a
  dirty road for his car."</p>

  <p>So the Unknown was coming that night. The news made Dickson the more
  resolved to get the watchers under lock and key before reinforcements
  arrived, and so put grit in their wheels. Then his party must escape&mdash;
  flee anywhere so long as it was far from Dalquharter.</p>

  <p>"You stop here," said Dobson, "I'll go down and let Spidel in. We want
  another lamp. Get the one that the women use, and for God's sake get a move
  on."</p>

  <p>The sound of his feet died in the kitchen passage and then rung again on
  the stone stairs. Dickson's ear of faith heard also the soft patter of naked
  feet as the Die-Hards preceded and followed him. He was delivering himself
  blind and bound into their hands.</p>

  <p>For a minute or two there was no sound but the wind, which had found a
  loose chimney cowl on the roof and screwed out of it an odd sound like the
  drone of a bagpipe. Dickson, unable to remain any longer in one place, moved
  into the centre of the hall, believing that Leon had gone to the
  smoking-room. It was a dangerous thing to do, for suddenly a match was lit a
  yard from him. He had the sense to drop low, and so was out of the main glare
  of the light. The man with the match apparently had no more, judging by his
  execrations. Dickson stood stock still, longing for the wind to fall so that
  he might hear the sound of the fellow's boots on the stone floor. He gathered
  that they were moving towards the smoking-room.</p>

  <p>"Heritage," he whispered as loud as he dared, bet there was no answer.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly a moving body collided with him. He jumped a step back and
  then stood at attention. "Is that you, Dobson?" a voice asked.</p>

  <p>Now behold the occasional advantage of a nick-name. Dickson thought he was
  being addressed as "Dogson" after the Poet's fashion. Had he dreamed it was
  Leon he would not have replied, but fluttered off into the shadows, and so
  missed a piece of vital news.</p>

  <p>"Ay, it's me." he whispered.</p>

  <p>His voice and accent were Scotch, like Dobson's, and Leon suspected
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"I do not like this wind," he grumbled. "The Captain's letter said at
  dawn, but there is no chance of the Danish brig making your little harbour in
  this weather. She must lie off and land the men by boats. That I do not like.
  It is too public."</p>

  <p>The news&mdash;tremendous news, for it told that the new-comers would come
  by sea, which had never before entered Dickson's head&mdash;so interested him
  that he stood dumb and ruminating. The silence made the Belgian suspect; he
  put out a hand and felt a waterproofed arm which might have been Dobson's.
  But the height of the shoulder proved that it was not the burly innkeeper.
  There was an oath, a quick movement, and Dickson went down with a knee on his
  chest and two hands at his throat.</p>

  <p>"Heritage," he gasped. "Help!"</p>

  <p>There was a sound of furniture scraped violently on the floor. A gurgle
  from Dickson served as a guide, and the Poet suddenly cascaded over the
  combatants. He felt for a head, found Leon's and gripped the neck so savagely
  that the owner loosened his hold on Dickson. The last-named found himself
  being buffeted violently by heavy-shod feet which seemed to be manoeuvring
  before an unseen enemy. He rolled out of the road and encountered another
  pair of feet, this time unshod. Then came the sound of a concussion, as if
  metal or wood had struck some part of a human frame, and then a stumble and
  fall.</p>

  <p>After that a good many things all seemed to happen at once. There was a
  sudden light, which showed Leon blinking with a short loaded life-preserver
  in his hand, and Heritage prone in front of him on the floor. It also showed
  Dickson the figure of Dougal, and more than one Die-Hard in the background.
  The light went out as suddenly as it had appeared. There was a whistle and a
  hoarse "Come on, men," and then for two seconds there was a desperate silent
  combat. It ended with Leon's head meeting the floor so violently that its
  possessor became oblivious of further proceedings. He was dragged into a
  cubby-hole, which had once been used for coats and rugs, and the door locked
  on him. Then the light sprang forth again. It revealed Dougal and five
  Die-Hards, somewhat the worse for wear; it revealed also Dickson squatted
  with outspread waterproof very like a sitting hen.</p>

  <p>"Where's Dobson?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"In the boiler-house," and for once Dougal's gravity had laughter in it.
  "Govey Dick! but yon was a fecht! Me and Peter Paterson and Wee Jaikie
  started it, but it was the whole company afore the end. Are ye better,
  Jaikie?"</p>

  <p>"Ay, I'm better," said a pallid midget.</p>

  <p>"He kickit Jaikie in the stomach and Jaikie was seeck," Dougal explained.
  "That's the three accounted for. I think mysel' that Dobson will be the first
  to get out, but he'll have his work letting out the others. Now, I'm for
  flittin' to the old Tower. They'll no ken where we are for a long time, and
  anyway yon place will be far easier to defend. Without they kindle a fire and
  smoke us out, I don't see how they'll beat us. Our provisions are a' there,
  and there's a grand well o' water inside. Forbye there's the road down the
  rocks that'll keep our communications open...  But what's come to Mr.
  Heritage?"</p>

  <p>Dickson to his shame had forgotten all about his friend. The Poet lay very
  quiet with his head on one side and his legs crooked limply. Blood trickled
  over his eyes from an ugly scar on his forehead. Dickson felt his heart and
  pulse and found them faint but regular. The man had got a swinging blow and
  might have a slight concussion; for the present he was unconscious.</p>

  <p>"All the more reason why we should flit," said Dougal. "What d'ye say, Mr.
  McCunn?"</p>

  <p>"Flit, of course, but further than the old Tower. What's the time?" He
  lifted Heritage's wrist and saw from his watch that it was half-past three.
  "Mercy. It's nearly morning. Afore we put these blagyirds away, they were
  conversing, at least Leon and Dobson were. They said that they expected
  somebody every moment, but that the car would be late. We've still got that
  Somebody to tackle. Then Leon spoke to me in the dark, thinking I was Dobson,
  and cursed the wind, saying it would keep the Danish brig from getting in at
  dawn as had been intended. D'you see what that means? The worst of the lot,
  the ones the ladies are in terror of, are coming by sea. Ay, and they can
  return by sea. We thought that the attack would be by land, and that even if
  they succeeded we could hang on to their heels and follow them, till we got
  them stopped. But that's impossible! If they come in from the water, they can
  go out by the water, and there'll never be more heard tell of the ladies or
  of you or me."</p>

  <p>Dougal's face was once again sunk in gloom. "What's your plan, then?"</p>

  <p>"We must get the ladies away from here&mdash;away inland, far from the
  sea. The rest of us must stand a siege in the old Tower, so that the enemy
  will think we're all there. Please God we'll hold out long enough for help to
  arrive. But we mustn't hang about here. There's the man Dobson
  mentioned&mdash;he may come any second, and we want to be away first. Get the
  ladder, Dougal...  Four of you take Mr. Heritage, and two come with me and
  carry the ladies' things. It's no' raining, but the wind's enough to take the
  wings off a seagull."</p>

  <p>Dickson roused Saskia and her cousin, bidding them be ready in ten
  minutes. Then with the help of the Die-Hards he proceeded to transport the
  necessary supplies&mdash;the stove, oil, dishes, clothes and wraps; more than
  one journey was needed of small boys, hidden under clouds of baggage. When
  everything had gone he collected the keys, behind which, in various quarters
  of the house, three gaolers fumed impotently, and gave them to Wee Jaikie to
  dispose of in some secret nook. Then he led the two ladies to the verandah,
  the elder cross and sleepy, the younger alert at the prospect of
  movement.</p>

  <p>"Tell me again," she said. "You have locked all the three up, and they are
  now the imprisoned?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it was the boys that, properly speaking, did the locking up."</p>

  <p>"It is a great&mdash;how do you say?&mdash;a turning of the tables.
  Ah&mdash;what is that?"</p>

  <p>At the end of the verandah there was a clattering down of pots which could
  not be due to the wind, since the place was sheltered. There was as yet only
  the faintest hint of light, and black night still lurked in the crannies.
  Followed another fall of pots, as from a clumsy intruder, and then a man
  appeared, clear against the glass door by which the path descended to the
  rock garden. It was the fourth man, whom the three prisoners had awaited.
  Dickson had no doubt at all about his identity. He was that villain from whom
  all the others took their orders, the man whom the Princess shuddered at.
  Before starting he had loaded his pistol. Now he tugged it from his
  waterproof pocket, pointed it at the other and fired.</p>

  <p>The man seemed to be hit, for he spun round and clapped a hand to his left
  arm. Then he fled through the door, which he left open.</p>

  <p>Dickson was after him like a hound. At the door he saw him running and
  raised his pistol for another shot. Then he dropped it, for he saw something
  in the crouching, dodging figure which was familiar.</p>

  <p>"A mistake," he explained to Jaikie when he returned. "But the shot wasn't
  wasted. I've just had a good try at killing the factor!"</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref12"
     id="ref12">CHAPTER 10</a></h3>

  <h2>DEALS WITH AN ESCAPE AND A JOURNEY</h2>

  <p>Five scouts' lanterns burned smokily in the ground room of the keep when
  Dickson ushered his charges through its cavernous door. The lights flickered
  in the gusts that swept after them and whistled through the slits of the
  windows, so that the place was full of monstrous shadows, and its accustomed
  odour of mould and disuse was changed to a salty freshness. Upstairs on the
  first floor Thomas Yownie had deposited the ladies' baggage, and was busy
  making beds out of derelict iron bedsteads and the wraps brought from their
  room. On the ground floor on a heap of litter covered by an old scout's
  blanket lay Heritage, with Dougal in attendance.</p>

  <p>The Chieftain had washed the blood from the Poet's brow, and the touch of
  cold water was bringing him back his senses. Saskia with a cry flew to him,
  and waved off Dickson who had fetched one of the bottles of liqueur brandy.
  She slipped a hand inside his shirt and felt the beating of his heart. Then
  her slim fingers ran over his forehead.</p>

  <p>"A bad blow," she muttered, "but I do not think he is ill. There is no
  fracture. When I nursed in the Alexander Hospital I learnt much about head
  wounds. Do not give him cognac if you value his life."</p>

  <p>Heritage was talking now and with strange tongues. Phrases like "lined
  Digesters" and "free sulphurous acid" came from his lips. He implored some
  one to tell him if "the first cook" was finished, and he upbraided some one
  else for "cooling off" too fast.</p>

  <p>The girl raised her head. "But I fear he has become mad," she said.</p>

  <p>"Wheesht, Mem," said Dickson, who recognized the jargon. "He's a
  papermaker."</p>

  <p>Saskia sat down on the litter and lifted his head so that it rested on her
  breast. Dougal at her bidding brought a certain case from her baggage, and
  with swift, capable hands she made a bandage and rubbed the wound with
  ointment before tying it up. Then her fingers seemed to play about his
  temples and along his cheeks and neck. She was the professional nurse now,
  absorbed, sexless. Heritage ceased to babble, his eyes shut and he was
  asleep.</p>

  <p>She remained where she was, so that the Poet, when a few minutes later he
  woke, found himself lying with his head in her lap. She spoke first, in an
  imperative tone: "You are well now. Your head does not ache. You are strong
  again."</p>

  <p>"No. Yes," he murmured. Then more clearly: "Where am I? Oh, I remember, I
  caught a lick on the head. What's become of the brutes?"</p>

  <p>Dickson, who had extracted food from the Mearns Street box and was
  pressing it on the others, replied through a mouthful of Biscuit: "We're in
  the old Tower. The three are lockit up in the House. Are you feeling better,
  Mr. Heritage?"</p>

  <p>The Poet suddenly realized Saskia's position and the blood came to his
  pale face. He got to his feet with an effort and held out a hand to the girl.
  "I'm all right now, I think. Only a little dicky on my legs. A thousand
  thanks, Princess. I've given you a lot of trouble."</p>

  <p>She smiled at him tenderly. "You say that when you have risked your life
  for me."</p>

  <p>"There's no time to waste," the relentless Dougal broke in. "Comin' over
  here, I heard a shot. What was it?"</p>

  <p>"It was me," said Dickson. "I was shootin' at the factor."</p>

  <p>"Did ye hit him?"</p>

  <p>"I think so, but I'm sorry to say not badly. When I last saw him he was
  running too quick for a sore hurt man. When I fired I thought it was the
  other man&mdash;the one they were expecting."</p>

  <p>Dickson marvelled at himself, yet his speech was not bravado, but the
  honest expression of his mind. He was keyed up to a mood in which he feared
  nothing very much, certainly not the laws of his country. If he fell in with
  the Unknown, he was entirely resolved, if his Maker permitted him, to do
  murder as being the simplest and justest solution. And if in the pursuit of
  this laudable intention he happened to wing lesser game it was no fault of
  his.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's a pity ye didn't get him," said Dougal, "him being what we ken
  him to be...  I'm for holding a council o' war, and considerin' the whole
  position. So far we haven't done that badly. We've shifted our base without
  serious casualties. We've got a far better position to hold, for there's too
  many ways into yon Hoose, and here there's just one. Besides, we've fickled
  the enemy. They'll take some time to find out where we've gone. But, mind
  you, we can't count on their staying long shut up. Dobson's no safe in the
  boiler-house, for there's a skylight far up and he'll see it when the light
  comes and maybe before. So we'd better get our plans ready. A word with ye,
  Mr. McCunn," and he led Dickson aside.</p>

  <p>"D'ye ken what these blagyirds were up to?" he whispered fiercely in
  Dickson's ear. "They were goin' to pushion the lassie. How do I ken, says
  you? Because Thomas Yownie heard Dobson say to Lean at the scullery door,
  'Have ye got the dope?' he says, and Lean says, 'Aye.' Thomas mindit the word
  for he had heard about it at the Picters."</p>

  <p>Dickson exclaimed in horror.</p>

  <p>"What d'ye make o' that? I'll tell ye. They wanted to make sure of her,
  but they wouldn't have thought o' dope unless the men they expectit were due
  to arrive at any moment. As I see it, we've to face a siege not by the three
  but by a dozen or more, and it'll no' be long till it starts. Now, isn't it a
  mercy we're safe in here?"</p>

  <p>Dickson returned to the others with a grave face.</p>

  <p>"Where d'you think the new folk are coming from?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Heritage answered, "From Auchenlochan, I suppose? Or perhaps down from the
  hills?"</p>

  <p>"You're wrong." And he told of Leon's mistaken confidences to him in the
  darkness. "They are coming from the sea, just like the old pirates."</p>

  <p>"The sea," Heritage repeated in a dazed voice.</p>

  <p>"Ay, the sea. Think what that means. If they had been coming by the roads,
  we could have kept track of them, even if they beat us, and some of these
  laddies could have stuck to them and followed them up till help came. It
  can't be such an easy job to carry a young lady against her will along Scotch
  roads. But the sea's a different matter. If they've got a fast boat they
  could be out of the Firth and away beyond the law before we could wake up a
  single policeman. Ay, and even if the Government took it up and warned all
  the ports and ships at sea, what's to hinder them to find a hidy-hole about
  Ireland&mdash;or Norway? I tell you, it's a far more desperate business than
  I thought, and it'll no' do to wait on and trust that the Chief Constable
  will turn up afore the mischief's done."</p>

  <p>"The moral," said Heritage, "is that there can be no surrender. We've got
  to stick it out in this old place at all costs."</p>

  <p>"No," said Dickson emphatically. "The moral is that we must shift the
  ladies. We've got the chance while Dobson and his friends are locked up.
  Let's get them as far away as we can from the sea. They're far safer tramping
  the moors, and it's no' likely the new folk will dare to follow us."</p>

  <p>"But I cannot go." Saskia, who had been listening intently, shook her
  head. "I promised to wait here till my friend came. If I leave I shall never
  find him."</p>

  <p>"If you stay you certainly never will, for you'll be away with the
  ruffians. Take a sensible view, Mem. You'll be no good to your friend or your
  friend to you if before night you're rocking in a ship."</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head again, gently but decisively. "It was our
  arrangement. I cannot break it. Besides, I am sure that he will come in time,
  for he has never failed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There was a desperate finality about the quiet tones and the weary face
  with the shadow of a smile on it.</p>

  <p>Then Heritage spoke. "I don't think your plan will quite do, Dogson.
  Supposing we all break for the hinterland and the Danish brig finds the birds
  flown, that won't end the trouble. They will get on the Princess's trail, and
  the whole persecution will start again. I want to see things brought to a
  head here and now. If we can stick it out here long enough, we may trap the
  whole push and rid the world of a pretty gang of miscreants. Let them show
  their hand, and then, if the police are here by that time, we can jug the lot
  for piracy or something worse."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," said Dougal, "but we'd put up a better fight if we had
  the women off our mind. I've aye read that when a castle was going to be
  besieged the first thing was to get rid of the civilians."</p>

  <p>"Sensible to the last, Dougal," said Dickson approvingly. "That's just
  what I'm saying. I'm strong for a fight, but put the ladies in a safe bit
  first, for they're our weak point."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that if you were fighting my enemies I would consent to be
  absent?" came Saskia's reproachful question.</p>

  <p>"'Deed no, Mem," said Dickson heartily. His martial spirit was with
  Heritage, but his prudence did not sleep, and he suddenly saw a way of
  placating both. "Just you listen to what I propose. What do we amount to? Mr.
  Heritage, six laddies, and myself&mdash;and I'm no more used to fighting than
  an old wife. We've seven desperate villains against us, and afore night they
  may be seventy. We've a fine old castle here, but for defence we want more
  than stone walls&mdash;we want a garrison. I tell you we must get help
  somewhere. Ay, but how, says you? Well, coming here I noticed a gentleman's
  house away up ayont the railway and close to the hills. The laird's maybe not
  at home, but there will be men there of some kind&mdash;gamekeepers and
  woodmen and such like. My plan is to go there at once and ask for help. Now,
  it's useless me going alone, for nobody would listen to me. They'd tell me to
  go back to the shop or they'd think me demented. But with you, Mem, it would
  be a different matter. They wouldn't disbelieve you. So I want you to come
  with me, and to come at once, for God knows how soon our need will be sore.
  We'll leave your cousin with Mrs. Morran in the village, for bed's the place
  for her, and then you and me will be off on our business."</p>

  <p>The girl looked at Heritage, who nodded. "It's the only way," he said.
  "Get every man jack you can raise, and if it's humanly possible get a gun or
  two. I believe there's time enough, for I don't see the brig arriving in
  broad daylight."</p>

  <p>"D'you not?" Dickson asked rudely. "Have you considered what day this is?
  It's the Sabbath, the best of days for an ill deed. There's no kirk
  hereaways, and everybody in the parish will be sitting indoors by the fire."
  He looked at his watch. "In half an hour it'll be light. Haste you, Mem, and
  get ready. Dougal, what's the weather?"</p>

  <p>The Chieftain swung open the door, and sniffed the air. The wind had
  fallen for the time being, and the surge of the tides below the rocks rose
  like the clamour of a mob. With the lull, mist and a thin drizzle had cloaked
  the world again.</p>

  <p>To Dickson's surprise Dougal seemed to be in good spirits. He began to
  sing to a hymn tune a strange ditty.</p>

  <p class="poem">"Class-conscious we are, and class-conscious wull be<br>
  Till our fit's on the neck o' the Boorjoyzee."</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you singing?" Dickson inquired.</p>

  <p>Dougal grinned. "Wee Jaikie went to a Socialist Sunday School last winter
  because he heard they were for fechtin' battles. Ay, and they telled him he
  was to join a thing called an International, and Jaikie thought it was a
  fitba' club. But when he fund out there was no magic lantern or swaree at
  Christmas he gie'd it the chuck. They learned him a heap o' queer songs.
  That's one."</p>

  <p>"What does the last word mean?"</p>

  <p>"I don't ken. Jaikie thought it was some kind of a draigon."</p>

  <p>"It's a daft-like thing anyway...  When's high water?"</p>

  <p>Dougal answered that to the best of his knowledge it fell between four and
  five in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>"Then that's when we may expect the foreign gentry if they think to bring
  their boat in to the Garplefoot...  Dougal, lad, I trust you to keep a most
  careful and prayerful watch. You had better get the Die-Hards out of the
  Tower and all round the place afore Dobson and Co. get loose, or you'll no'
  get a chance later. Don't lose your mobility, as the sodgers say. Mr.
  Heritage can hold the fort, but you laddies should be spread out like a
  screen."</p>

  <p>"That was my notion," said Dougal. "I'll detail two Die-Hards&mdash;
  Thomas Yownie and Wee Jaikie&mdash;to keep in touch with ye and watch for you
  comin' back. Thomas ye ken already; ye'll no fickle Thomas Yownie. But don't
  be mistook about Wee Jaikie. He's terrible fond of greetin', but it's no
  fright with him but excitement. It's just a habit he's gotten. When ye see
  Jaikie begin to greet, you may be sure that Jaikie's gettin' dangerous."</p>

  <p>The door shut behind them and Dickson found himself with his two charges
  in a world dim with fog and rain and the still lingering darkness. The air
  was raw, and had the sour smell which comes from soaked earth and wet boughs
  when the leaves are not yet fledged. Both the women were miserably equipped
  for such an expedition. Cousin Eugenie trailed heavy furs, Saskia's only wrap
  was a bright-coloured shawl about her shoulders, and both wore thin foreign
  shoes. Dickson insisted on stripping off his trusty waterproof and forcing it
  on the Princess, on whose slim body it hung very loose and very short. The
  elder woman stumbled and whimpered and needed the constant support of his
  arm, walking like a townswoman from the knees. But Saskia swung from the hips
  like a free woman, and Dickson had much ado to keep up with her. She seemed
  to delight in the bitter freshness of the dawn, inhaling deep breaths of it,
  and humming fragments of a tune.</p>

  <p>Guided by Thomas Yownie they took the road which Dickson and Heritage had
  travelled the first evening, through the shrubberies on the north side of the
  House and the side avenue beyond which the ground fell to the Laver glen. On
  their right the House rose like a dark cloud, but Dickson had lost his terror
  of it. There were three angry men inside it, he remembered: long let them
  stay there. He marvelled at his mood, and also rejoiced, for his worst fear
  had always been that he might prove a coward. Now he was puzzled to think how
  he could ever be frightened again, for his one object was to succeed, and in
  that absorption fear seemed to him merely a waste of time. "It all comes of
  treating the thing as a business proposition," he told himself.</p>

  <p>But there was far more in his heart than this sober resolution. He was
  intoxicated with the resurgence of youth and felt a rapture of audacity which
  he never remembered in his decorous boyhood. "I haven't been doing badly for
  an old man," he reflected with glee. What, oh what had become of the pillar
  of commerce, the man who might have been a bailie had he sought municipal
  honours, the elder in the Guthrie Memorial Kirk, the instructor of literary
  young men? In the past three days he had levanted with jewels which had once
  been an Emperor's and certainly were not his; he had burglariously entered
  and made free of a strange house; he had played hide-and-seek at the risk of
  his neck and had wrestled in the dark with a foreign miscreant; he had shot
  at an eminent solicitor with intent to kill; and he was now engaged in
  tramping the world with a fairytale Princess. I blush to confess that of each
  of his doings he was unashamedly proud, and thirsted for many more in the
  same line. "Gosh, but I'm seeing life," was his unregenerate conclusion.</p>

  <p>Without sight or sound of a human being, they descended to the Laver,
  climbed again by the cart track, and passed the deserted West Lodge and inn
  to the village. It was almost full dawn when the three stood in Mrs. Morran's
  kitchen.</p>

  <p>"I've brought you two ladies, Auntie Phemie," said Dickson.</p>

  <p>They made an odd group in that cheerful place, where the new-lit fire was
  crackling in the big grate&mdash;the wet undignified form of Dickson,
  unshaven of cheek and chin and disreputable in garb; the shrouded figure of
  Cousin Eugenie, who had sunk into the arm-chair and closed her eyes; the slim
  girl, into whose face the weather had whipped a glow like blossom; and the
  hostess, with her petticoats kilted and an ancient mutch on her head.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Morran looked once at Saskia, and then did a thing which she had not
  done since her girlhood. She curtseyed.</p>

  <p>"I'm proud to see ye here, Mem. Off wi' your things, and I'll get ye dry
  claes, Losh, ye're fair soppin' And your shoon! Ye maun change your feet...
  Dickson! Awa' up to the loft, and dinna you stir till I give ye a cry. The
  leddies will change by the fire. And You, Mem"&mdash;this to Cousin
  Eugenie&mdash;"the place for you's your bed. I'll kinnle a fire ben the hoose
  in a jiffey. And syne ye'll have breakfast&mdash;ye'll hae a cup o' tea wi'
  me now, for the kettle's just on the boil. Awa' wi' ye. Dickson," and she
  stamped her foot.</p>

  <p>Dickson departed, and in the loft washed his face, and smoked a pipe on
  the edge of the bed, watching the mist eddying up the village street. From
  below rose the sounds of hospitable bustle, and when after some twenty
  minutes' vigil he descended, he found Saskia toasting stockinged toes by the
  fire in the great arm-chair, and Mrs. Morran setting the table.</p>

  <p>"Auntie Phemie, hearken to me. We've taken on too big a job for two men
  and six laddies, and help we've got to get, and that this very morning. D'you
  mind the big white house away up near the hills ayont the station and east of
  the Ayr road? It looked like a gentleman's shooting lodge. I was thinking of
  trying there. Mercy!"</p>

  <p>The exclamation was wrung from him by his eyes settling on Saskia and
  noting her apparel. Gone were her thin foreign clothes, and in their place
  she wore a heavy tweed skirt cut very short, and thick homespun stockings,
  which had been made for some one with larger feet than hers. A pair of the
  coarse low-heeled shoes which country folk wear in the farmyard stood warming
  by the hearth. She still had her russet jumper, but round her neck hung a
  grey wool scarf, of the kind known as a "Comforter." Amazingly pretty she
  looked in Dickson's eyes, but with a different kind of prettiness. The sense
  of fragility had fled, and he saw how nobly built she was for all her
  exquisiteness. She looked like a queen, he thought, but a queen to go
  gipsying through the world with.</p>

  <p>"Ay, they're some o' Elspeth's things, rale guid furthy claes," said Mrs.
  Morran complacently. "And the shoon are what she used to gang about the byres
  wi' when she was in the Castlewham dairy. The leddy was tellin' me she was
  for trampin' the hills, and thae things will keep her dry and warm...  I ken
  the hoose ye mean. They ca' it the Mains of Garple. And I ken the man that
  bides in it. He's yin Sir Erchibald Roylance. English, but his mither was a
  Dalziel. I'm no weel acquaint wi' his forbears, but I'm weel eneuch acquaint
  wi' Sir Erchie, and 'better a guid coo than a coo o' a guid kind,' as my
  mither used to say. He used to be an awfu' wild callont, a freend o' puir
  Maister Quentin, and up to ony deevilry. But they tell me he's a quieter lad
  since the war, as sair lamed by fa'in oot o' an airyplane."</p>

  <p>"Will he be at the Mains just now?" Dickson asked.</p>

  <p>"I wadna wonder. He has a muckle place in England, but he aye used to come
  here in the back-end for the shootin' and in April for birds. He's clean daft
  about birds. He'll be out a' day at the craig watchin' solans, or lyin' a'
  mornin' i' the moss lookin' at bog-blitters."</p>

  <p>"Will he help, think you?"</p>

  <p>"I'll wager he'll help. Onyway it's your best chance, and better a wee
  bush than nae beild. Now, sit in to your breakfast."</p>

  <p>It was a merry meal. Mrs. Morran dispensed tea and gnomic wisdom. Saskia
  ate heartily, speaking little, but once or twice laying her hand softly on
  her hostess's gnarled fingers. Dickson was in such spirits that he gobbled
  shamelessly, being both hungry and hurried, and he spoke of the still
  unconquered enemy with ease and disrespect, so that Mrs. Morran was moved to
  observe that there was "naething sae bauld as a blind mear." But when in a
  sudden return of modesty he belittled his usefulness and talked sombrely of
  his mature years he was told that he "wad never be auld wi' sae muckle
  honesty." Indeed it was very clear that Mrs. Morran approved of her nephew.
  They did not linger over breakfast, for both were impatient to be on the
  road. Mrs. Morran assisted Saskia to put on Elspeth's shoes. "'Even a young
  fit finds comfort in an auld bauchle,' as my mother, honest woman, used to
  say." Dickson's waterproof was restored to him, and for Saskia an old
  raincoat belonging to the son in South Africa was discovered, which fitted
  her better. "Siccan weather," said the hostess, as she opened the door to let
  in a swirl of wind. "The deil's aye kind to his ain. Haste ye back, Mem, and
  be sure I'll tak' guid care o' your leddy cousin."</p>

  <p>The proper way to the Mains of Garple was either by the station and the
  Ayr road, or by the Auchenlochan highway, branching off half a mile beyond
  the Garple bridge. But Dickson, who had been studying the map and fancied
  himself as a pathfinder, chose the direct route across the Long Muir as being
  at once shorter and more sequestered. With the dawn the wind had risen again,
  but it had shifted towards the north-west and was many degrees colder. The
  mist was furling on the hills like sails, the rain had ceased, and out at sea
  the eye covered a mile or two of wild water. The moor was drenching wet, and
  the peat bogs were brimming with inky pools, so that soon the travellers were
  soaked to the knees. Dickson had no fear of pursuit, for he calculated that
  Dobson and his friends, even if they had got out, would be busy looking for
  the truants in the vicinity of the House and would presently be engaged with
  the old Tower. But he realized, too, that speed on his errand was vital, for
  at any moment the Unknown might arrive from the sea.</p>

  <p>So he kept up a good pace, half-running, half-striding, till they had
  passed the railway, and he found himself gasping with a stitch in his side,
  and compelled to rest in the lee of what had once been a sheepfold. Saskia
  amazed him. She moved over the rough heather like a deer, and it was her hand
  that helped him across the deeper hags. Before such youth and vigour he felt
  clumsy and old. She stood looking down at him as he recovered his breath,
  cool, unruffled, alert as Diana. His mind fled to Heritage, and it occurred
  to him suddenly that the Poet had set his affections very high. Loyalty drove
  him to speak for his friend.</p>

  <p>"I've got the easy job," he said. "Mr. Heritage will have the whole pack
  on him in that old Tower, and him with such a sore clout on his head. I've
  left him my pistol. He's a terrible brave man!"</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"Ay, and he's a poet too."</p>

  <p>"So?" she said. "I did not know. He is very young."</p>

  <p>"He's a man of very high ideels."</p>

  <p>She puzzled at the word, and then smiled. "He is like many of our young
  men in Russia, the students&mdash;his mind is in a ferment and he does not
  know what he wants. But he is brave."</p>

  <p>This seemed to Dickson's loyal soul but a chilly tribute.</p>

  <p>"I think he is in love with me," she continued.</p>

  <p>He looked up startled, and saw in her face that which gave him a view into
  a strange new world. He had thought that women blushed when they talked of
  love, but he eyes were as grave and candid as a boy's. Here was one who had
  gone through waters so deep that she had lost the foibles of sex. Love to her
  was only a word of ill omen, a threat on the lips of brutes, an extra
  battalion of peril in an army of perplexities. He felt like some homely
  rustic who finds himself swept unwittingly into the moonlight hunt of Artemis
  and her maidens.</p>

  <p>"He is a romantic," she said. "I have known so many like him."</p>

  <p>"He's no that," said Dickson shortly. "Why he used to be aye laughing at
  me for being romantic. He's one that's looking for truth and reality, he
  says, and he's terrible down on the kind of poetry I like myself."</p>

  <p>She smiled. "They all talk so. But you, my friend Dickson" (she pronounced
  the name in two staccato syllables ever so prettily), "you are different.
  Tell me about yourself."</p>

  <p>"I'm just what you see&mdash;a middle-aged retired grocer."</p>

  <p>"Grocer?" she queried. "Ah, yes, <i>&eacute;picier</i>. But you are a very
  remarkable &eacute;<i>picier</i>. Mr. Heritage I understand, but you and
  those little boys&mdash;no. I am sure of one thing&mdash;you are not a
  romantic. You are too humorous and&mdash;and&mdash;I think you are like
  Ulysses, for it would not be easy to defeat you."</p>

  <p>Her eyes were kind, nay affectionate, and Dickson experienced a
  preposterous rapture in his soul, followed by a sinking, as he realized how
  far the job was still from being completed.</p>

  <p>"We must be getting on, Mem," he said hastily, and the two plunged again
  into the heather.</p>

  <p>The Ayr road was crossed, and the fir wood around the Mains became
  visible, and presently the white gates of the entrance. A wind-blown spire of
  smoke beyond the trees proclaimed that the house was not untenanted. As they
  entered the drive the Scots firs were tossing in the gale, which blew
  fiercely at this altitude, but, the dwelling itself being more in the hollow,
  the daffodil clumps on the lawn were but mildly fluttered.</p>

  <p>The door was opened by a one-armed butler who bore all the marks of the
  old regular soldier. Dickson produced a card and asked to see his master on
  urgent business. Sir Archibald was at home, he was told, and had just
  finished breakfast. The two were led into a large bare chamber which had all
  the chill and mustiness of a bachelor's drawing-room. The butler returned,
  and said Sir Archibald would see him. "I'd better go myself first and prepare
  the way, Mem," Dickson whispered, and followed the man across the hall.</p>

  <p>He found himself ushered into a fair-sized room where a bright fire was
  burning. On a table lay the remains of breakfast, and the odour of food
  mingled pleasantly with the scent of peat. The horns and heads of big game,
  foxes' masks, the model of a gigantic salmon, and several bookcases adorned
  the walls, and books and maps were mixed with decanters and cigar-boxes on
  the long sideboard. After the wild out of doors the place seemed the very
  shrine of comfort. A young man sat in an arm-chair by the fire with a leg on
  a stool; he was smoking a pipe, and reading the Field, and on another stool
  at his elbow was a pile of new novels. He was a pleasant brown-faced young
  man, with remarkably smooth hair and a roving humorous eye.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Mr. McCunn. Very glad to see you. If, as I take it, you're the
  grocer, you're a household name in these parts. I get all my supplies from
  you, and I've just been makin' inroads on one of your divine hams. Now, what
  can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm very proud to hear what you say, Sir Archibald. But I've not come on
  business. I've come with the queerest story you ever heard in your life and
  I've come to ask your help."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead. A good story is just what I want this vile mornin'."</p>

  <p>"I'm not here alone. I've a lady with me."</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul! A lady!"</p>

  <p>"Ay, a princess. She's in the next room."</p>

  <p>The young man looked wildly at him and waved the book he had been
  reading.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Mr. McCunn, but are you quite sober? I beg your pardon. I see
  you are. But you know, it isn't done. Princesses don't as a rule come here
  after breakfast to pass the time of day. It's more absurd than this shocker
  I've been readin'."</p>

  <p>"All the same it's a fact. She'll tell you the story herself, and you'll
  believe her quick enough. But to prepare your mind I'll just give you a
  sketch of the events of the last few days."</p>

  <p>Before the sketch was concluded the young man had violently rung the bell.
  "Sime," he shouted to the servant, "clear away this mess and lay the table
  again. Order more breakfast, all the breakfast you can get. Open the windows
  and get the tobacco smoke out of the air. Tidy up the place for there's a
  lady comin'. Quick, you juggins!"</p>

  <p>He was on his feet now, and, with his arm in Dickson's, was heading for
  the door.</p>

  <p>"My sainted aunt! And you topped off with pottin' at the factor. I've seen
  a few things in my day, but I'm blessed if I ever met a bird like
  you!"</p><br>
 <br>

     id="ref13">CHAPTER 11</a></h3>

  <h2>GRAVITY OUT OF BED</h2>

  <p>It is probable that Sir Archibald Roylance did not altogether believe
  Dickson's tale; it may be that he considered him an agreeable romancer, or a
  little mad, or no more than a relief to the tedium of a wet Sunday morning.
  But his incredulity did not survive one glance at Saskia as she stood in that
  bleak drawing-room among Victorian water-colours and faded chintzes. The
  young man's boyishness deserted him. He stopped short in his tracks, and made
  a profound and awkward bow. "I am at your service, Mademoiselle," he said,
  amazed at himself. The words seemed to have come out of a confused memory of
  plays and novels.</p>

  <p>She inclined her head&mdash;a little on one side, and looked towards
  Dickson.</p>

  <p>"Sir Archibald's going to do his best for us," said that squire of dames.
  "I was telling him that we had had our breakfast."</p>

  <p>"Let's get out of this sepulchre," said their host, who was recovering
  himself. "There's a roasting fire in my den. Of course you'll have something
  to eat&mdash;hot coffee, anyhow&mdash;I've trained my cook to make coffee
  like a Frenchwoman. The housekeeper will take charge of you, if you want to
  tidy up, and you must excuse our ramshackle ways, please. I don't believe
  there's ever been a lady in this house before, you know."</p>

  <p>He led her to the smoking-room and ensconced her in the great chair by the
  fire. Smilingly she refused a series of offers which ranged from a sheepskin
  mantle which he had got in the Pamirs and which he thought might fit her, to
  hot whisky and water as a specific against a chill. But she accepted a pair
  of slippers and deftly kicked off the brogues provided by Mrs. Morran. Also,
  while Dickson started rapaciously on a second breakfast, she allowed him to
  pour her out a cup of coffee.</p>

  <p>"You are a soldier?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Two years infantry&mdash;5th Battalion Lennox Highlanders, and then
  Flying Corps. Top-hole time I had too till the day before the Armistice, when
  my luck gave out and I took a nasty toss. Consequently I'm not as fast on my
  legs now as I'd like to be."</p>

  <p>"You were a friend of Captain Kennedy?"</p>

  <p>"His oldest. We were at the same private school, and he was at m'tutors,
  and we were never much separated till he went abroad to cram for the
  Diplomatic and I started east to shoot things."</p>

  <p>"Then I will tell you what I told Captain Kennedy." Saskia, looking into
  the heart of the peats, began the story of which we have already heard a
  version, but she told it differently, for she was telling it to one who more
  or less belonged to her own world. She mentioned names at which the other
  nodded. She spoke of a certain Paul Abreskov. "I heard of him at Bokhara in
  1912," said Sir Archie, and his face grew solemn. Sometimes she lapsed into
  French, and her hearer's brow wrinkled, but he appeared to follow. When she
  had finished he drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"My aunt! What a time you've been through! I've seen pluck in my day, but
  yours! It's not thinkable. D'you mind if I ask a question, Princess?
  Bolshevism we know all about, and I admit Trotsky and his friends are a
  pretty effective push; but how on earth have they got a world-wide graft
  going in the time so that they can stretch their net to an out-of-the-way
  spot like this? It looks as if they had struck a Napoleon somewhere."</p>

  <p>"You do not understand," she said. "I cannot make any one
  understand&mdash;except a Russian. My country has been broken to pieces, and
  there is no law in it; therefore it is a nursery of crime. So would England
  be, or France, if you had suffered the same misfortunes. My people are not
  wickeder than others, but for the moment they are sick and have no strength.
  As for the government of the Bolsheviki it matters little, for it will pass.
  Some parts of it may remain, but it is a government of the sick and fevered,
  and cannot endure in health. Lenin may be a good man&mdash;I do not think so,
  but I do not know&mdash;but if he were an archangel he could not alter
  things. Russia is mortally sick and therefore all evil is unchained, and the
  criminals have no one to check them. There is crime everywhere in the world,
  and the unfettered crime in Russia is so powerful that it stretches its hand
  to crime throughout the globe and there is a great mobilizing everywhere of
  wicked men. Once you boasted that law was international and that the police
  in one land worked with the police of all others. To-day that is true about
  criminals. After a war evil passions are loosed, and, since Russia is broken,
  in her they can make their headquarters...  It is not Bolshevism, the theory,
  you need fear, for that is a weak and dying thing. It is crime, which to-day
  finds its seat in my country, but is not only Russian. It has no fatherland.
  It is as old as human nature and as wide as the earth."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Sir Archie. "Gad, here have I been vegetatin' and thinkin'
  that all excitement had gone out of life with the war, and sometimes even
  regrettin' that the beastly old thing was over, and all the while the world
  fairly hummin' with interest. And Loudon too!"</p>

  <p>"I would like your candid opinion on yon factor, Sir Archibald," said
  Dickson.</p>

  <p>"I can't say I ever liked him, and I've once or twice had a row with him,
  for used to bring his pals to shoot over Dalquharter and he didn't quite play
  the game by me. But I know dashed little about him, for I've been a lot away.
  Bit hairy about the heels, of course. A great figure at local race-meetin's,
  and used to toady old Carforth and the huntin' crowd. He has a pretty big
  reputation as a sharp lawyer and some of the thick-headed lairds swear by
  him, but Quentin never could stick him. It's quite likely he's been gettin'
  into Queer Street, for he was always speculatin' in horseflesh, and I fancy
  he plunged a bit on the Turf. But I can't think how he got mixed up in this
  show."</p>

  <p>"I'm positive Dobson's his brother."</p>

  <p>"And put this business in his way. That would explain it all right...  He
  must be runnin' for pretty big stakes, for that kind of lad don't dabble in
  crime for six-and-eightpence...  Now for the layout. You've got three men
  shut up in Dalquharter House, who by this time have probably escaped. One of
  you&mdash;what's his name?&mdash;Heritage?&mdash;is in the old Tower, and you
  think that they think the Princess is still there and will sit round the
  place like terriers. Sometime to-day the Danish brig wall arrive with
  reinforcements, and then there will be a hefty fight. Well, the first thing
  to be done it to get rid of Loudon's stymie with the authorities. Princess,
  I'm going to carry you off in my car to the Chief Constable. The second thing
  is for you after that to stay on here. It's a deadly place on a wet day, but
  it's safe enough."</p>

  <p>Saskia shook her head and Dickson spoke for her.</p>

  <p>"You'll no' get her to stop here. I've done my best, but she's determined
  to be back at Dalquharter. You see she's expecting a friend, and besides, if
  here's going to be a battle she'd like to be in it. Is that so, Mem?"</p>

  <p>Sir Archie looked helplessly around him, and the sight of the girl's face
  convinced him that argument would be fruitless. "Anyhow she must come with me
  to the Chief Constable. Lethington's a slow bird on the wing, and I don't see
  myself convincin' him that he must get busy unless I can produce the
  Princess. Even then it may be a tough job, for it's Sunday, and in these
  parts people go to sleep till Monday mornin'."</p>

  <p>"That's just what I'm trying to get at," said Dickson. "By all means go to
  the Chief Constable, and tell him it's life or death. My lawyer in Glasgow,
  Mr. Caw, will have been stirring him up yesterday, and you two should
  complete the job...  But what I'm feared is that he'll not be in time. As you
  say, it's the Sabbath day, and the police are terrible slow. Now any moment
  that brig may be here, and the trouble will start. I'm wanting to save the
  Princess, but I'm wanting too to give these blagyirds the roughest handling
  they ever got in their lives. Therefore I say there's no time to lose. We're
  far ower few to put up a fight, and we want every man you've got about this
  place to hold the fort till the police come."</p>

  <p>Sir Archibald looked upon the earnest flushed face of Dickson with
  admiration. "I'm blessed if you're not the most whole-hearted brigand I've
  ever struck."</p>

  <p>"I'm not. I'm just a business man."</p>

  <p>"Do you realize that you're levying a private war and breaking every law
  of the land?"</p>

  <p>"Hoots!" said Dickson. "I don't care a docken about the law. I'm for
  seeing this job through. What force can you produce?"</p>

  <p>"Only cripples, I'm afraid. There's Sime, my butler. He was a Fusilier
  Jock and, as you saw, has lost an arm. Then McGuffog the keeper is a good
  man, but he's still got a Turkish bullet in his thigh. The chauffeur,
  Carfrae, was in the Yeomanry, and lost half a foot; and there's myself, as
  lame as a duck. The herds on the home farm are no good, for one's seventy and
  the other is in bed with jaundice. The Mains can produce four men, but
  they're rather a job lot."</p>

  <p>"They'll do fine," said Dickson heartily. "All sodgers, and no doubt all
  good shots. Have you plenty guns?"</p>

  <p>Sir Archie burst into uproarious laughter. "Mr. McCunn, you're a man after
  my own heart. I'm under your orders. If I had a boy I'd put him into the
  provision trade, for it's the place to see fightin'. Yes, we've no end of
  guns. I advise shot-guns, for they've more stoppin' power in a rush than a
  rifle, and I take it it's a rough-and-tumble we're lookin' for."</p>

  <p>"Right," said Dickson. "I saw a bicycle in the hall. I want you to lend it
  me, for I must be getting back. You'll take the Princess and do the best you
  can with the Chief Constable."</p>

  <p>"And then?"</p>

  <p>"Then you'll load up your car with your folk, and come down the hill to
  Dalquharter. There'll be a laddie, or maybe more than one, waiting for you on
  this side the village to give you instructions. Take your orders from them.
  If it's a red-haired ruffian called Dougal you'll be wise to heed what he
  says, for he has a grand head for battles."</p>

  <p>Five minutes later Dickson was pursuing a quavering course like a snipe
  down the avenue. He was a miserable performer on a bicycle. Not for twenty
  years had he bestridden one, and he did not understand such new devices as
  free-wheels and change of gears. The mounting had been the worst part, and it
  had only been achieved by the help of a rockery. He had begun by cutting into
  two flower-beds, and missing a birch tree by inches. But he clung on
  desperately, well knowing that if he fell off it would be hard to remount,
  and at length he gained the avenue. When he passed the lodge gates he was
  riding fairly straight, and when he turned off the Ayr highway to the side
  road that led to Dalquharter he was more or less master of his machine.</p>

  <p>He crossed the Garple by an ancient hunch-backed bridge, observing even in
  his absorption with the handle-bars that the stream was in roaring spate. He
  wrestled up the further hill with aching calf-muscles, and got to the top
  just before his strength gave out. Then as the road turned seaward he had the
  slope with him, and enjoyed some respite. It was no case for putting up his
  feet, for the gale was blowing hard on his right cheek, but the downward
  grade enabled him to keep his course with little exertion. His anxiety to get
  back to the scene of action was for the moment appeased, since he knew he was
  making as good speed as the weather allowed, so he had leisure for
  thought.</p>

  <p>But the mind of this preposterous being was not on the business before
  him. He dallied with irrelevant things&mdash;with the problems of youth and
  love. He was beginning to be very nervous about Heritage, not as the solitary
  garrison of the old Tower, but as the lover of Saskia. That everybody should
  be in love with her appeared to him only proper, for he had never met her
  like, and assumed that it did not exist. The desire of the moth for the star
  seemed to him a reasonable thing, since hopeless loyalty and unrequited
  passion were the eternal stock-in-trade of romance. He wished he were
  twenty-five himself to have the chance of indulging in such sentimentality
  for such a lady. But Heritage was not like him and would never be content
  with a romantic folly...  He had been in love with her for two years&mdash; a
  long time. He spoke about wanting to die for her, which was a flight beyond
  Dickson himself. "I doubt it will be what they call a 'grand passion,'" he
  reflected with reverence. But it was hopeless; he saw quite clearly that it
  was hopeless.</p>

  <p>Why, he could not have explained, for Dickson's instincts were subtler
  than his intelligence. He recognized that the two belonged to different
  circles of being, which nowhere intersected. That mysterious lady, whose eyes
  had looked through life to the other side, was no mate for the Poet. His
  faithful soul was agitated, for he had developed for Heritage a sincere
  affection. It would break his heart, poor man. There was he holding the fort
  alone and cheering himself with delightful fancies about one remoter than the
  moon. Dickson wanted happy endings, and here there was no hope of such. He
  hated to admit that life could be crooked, but the optimist in him was now
  fairly dashed.</p>

  <p>Sir Archie might be the fortunate man, for of course he would soon be in
  love with her, if he were not so already. Dickson like all his class had a
  profound regard for the country gentry. The business Scot does not usually
  revere wealth, though he may pursue it earnestly, nor does he specially
  admire rank in the common sense. But for ancient race he has respect in his
  bones, though it may happen that in public he denies it, and the laird has
  for him a secular association with good family...  Sir Archie might do. He
  was young, good-looking, obviously gallant...  But no! He was not quite right
  either. Just a trifle too light in weight, too boyish and callow. The
  Princess must have youth, but it should be mighty youth, the youth of a
  Napoleon or a Caesar. He reflected that the Great Montrose, for whom he had a
  special veneration, might have filled the bill. Or young Harry with his
  beaver up? Or Claverhouse in the picture with the flush of temper on his
  cheek?</p>

  <p>The meditations of the match-making Dickson came to an abrupt end. He had
  been riding negligently, his head bent against the wind, and his eyes vaguely
  fixed on the wet hill-gravel of the road. Of his immediate environs he was
  pretty well unconscious. Suddenly he was aware of figures on each side of him
  who advanced menacingly. Stung to activity he attempted to increase his pace,
  which was already good, for the road at this point descended steeply. Then,
  before he could prevent it, a stick was thrust into his front wheel, and the
  next second he was describing a curve through the air. His head took the
  ground, he felt a spasm of blinding pain, and then a sense of horrible
  suffocation before his wits left him.</p>

  <p>"Are ye sure it's the richt man, Ecky?" said a voice which he did not
  hear.</p>

  <p>"Sure. It's the Glesca body Dobson telled us to look for yesterday. It's a
  pund note atween us for this job. We'll tie him up in the wud till we've time
  to attend to him."</p>

  <p>"Is he bad?"</p>

  <p>"It doesna maitter," said the one called Ecky. "He'll be deid onyway long
  afore the morn."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Morran all forenoon was in a state of un-Sabbatical disquiet. After
  she had seen Saskia and Dickson start she finished her housewifely duties,
  took Cousin Eugenie her breakfast, and made preparation for the midday
  dinner. The invalid in the bed in the parlour was not a repaying subject.
  Cousin Eugenie belonged to that type of elderly women who, having been
  spoiled in youth, find the rest of life fall far short of their expectations.
  Her voice had acquired a perpetual wail, and the corners of what had once
  been a pretty mouth drooped in an eternal peevishness. She found herself in a
  morass of misery and shabby discomfort, but had her days continued in an even
  tenor she would still have lamented. "A dingy body," was Mrs. Morran's
  comment, but she laboured in kindness. Unhappily they had no common language,
  and it was only by signs that the hostess could discover her wants and show
  her goodwill. She fed her and bathed her face, saw to the fire and left her
  to sleep. "I'm boilin' a hen to mak' broth for your denner, Mem. Try and get
  a bit sleep now." The purport of the advice was clear, and Cousin Eugenie
  turned obediently on her pillow.</p>

  <p>It was Mrs. Morran's custom of a Sunday to spend the morning in devout
  meditation. Some years before she had given up tramping the five miles to
  kirk, on the ground that having been a regular attendant for fifty years she
  had got all the good out of it that was probable. Instead she read slowly
  aloud to herself the sermon printed in a certain religious weekly which
  reached her every Saturday, and concluded with a chapter or two of the Bible.
  But to-day something had gone wrong with her mind. She could not follow the
  thread of the Reverend Doctor MacMichael's discourse. She could not fix her
  attention on the wanderings and misdeeds of Israel as recorded in the Book of
  Exodus. She must always be getting up to look at the pot on the fire, or to
  open the back door and study the weather. For a little she fought against her
  unrest, and then she gave up the attempt at concentration. She took the big
  pot off the fire and allowed it to simmer, and presently she fetched her
  boots and umbrella, and kilted her petticoats. "I'll be none the waur o' a
  breath o' caller air," she decided.</p>

  <p>The wind was blowing great guns but there was only the thinnest sprinkle
  of rain. Sitting on the hen-house roof and munching a raw turnip was a figure
  which she recognized as the smallest of the Die-Hards. Between bites he was
  singing dolefully to the tune of "Annie Laurie" one of the ditties of his
  quondam Sunday School:</p>

  <p class="poem">"The Boorjoys' brays are bonnie,<br>
  Too-roo-ra-roo-raloo,<br>
  But the Workers of the World<br>
  Wull gar them a' look blue,<br>
  And droon them in the sea,<br>
  And&mdash;for bonnie Annie Laurie<br>
  I'll lay me down and dee."</p>

  <p>"Losh, laddie," she cried, "that's cauld food for the stomach. Come
  indoors about midday and I'll gie ye a plate o' broth!" The Die-Hard saluted
  and continued on the turnip.</p>

  <p>She took the Auchenlochan road across the Garple bridge, for that was the
  best road to the Mains, and by it Dickson and the others might be returning.
  Her equanimity at all seasons was like a Turk's, and she would not have
  admitted that anything mortal had power to upset or excite her: nevertheless
  it was a fast-beating heart that she now bore beneath her Sunday jacket.
  Great events, she felt, were on the eve of happening, and of them she was a
  part. Dickson's anxiety was hers, to bring things to a business-like
  conclusion. The honour of Huntingtower was at stake and of the old Kennedys.
  She was carrying out Mr. Quentin's commands, the dead boy who used to clamour
  for her treacle scones. And there was more than duty in it, for youth was not
  dead in her old heart, and adventure had still power to quicken it.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Morran walked well, with the steady long paces of the Scots
  countrywoman. She left the Auchenlochan road and took the side path along the
  tableland to the Mains. But for the surge of the gale and the far-borne boom
  of the furious sea there was little noise; not a bird cried in the uneasy
  air. With the wind behind her Mrs. Morran breasted the ascent till she had on
  her right the moorland running south to the Lochan valley and on her left
  Garple chafing in its deep forested gorges. Her eyes were quick and she noted
  with interest a weasel creeping from a fern-clad cairn. A little way on she
  passed an old ewe in difficulties and assisted it to rise. "But for me, my
  wumman, ye'd hae been braxy ere nicht," she told it as it departed bleating.
  Then she realized that she had come a certain distance. "Losh, I maun be
  gettin' back or the hen will be spiled," she cried, and was on the verge of
  turning.</p>

  <p>But something caught her eye a hundred yards farther on the road. It was
  something which moved with the wind like a wounded bird, fluttering from the
  roadside to a puddle and then back to the rushes. She advanced to it, missed
  it, and caught it.</p>

  <p>It was an old dingy green felt hat, and she recognized it as
  Dickson's.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Morran's brain, after a second of confusion, worked fast and clearly.
  She examined the road and saw that a little way on the gravel had been
  violently agitated. She detected several prints of hobnailed boots. There
  were prints, too, on a patch of peat on the south side behind a tall bank of
  sods. "That's where they were hidin'," she concluded. Then she explored on
  the other side in a thicket of hazels and wild raspberries, and presently her
  perseverance was rewarded. The scrub was all crushed and pressed as if
  several persons had been forcing a passage. In a hollow was a gleam of
  something white. She moved towards it with a quaking heart, and was relieved
  to find that it was only a new and expensive bicycle with the front wheel
  badly buckled.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Morran delayed no longer. If she had walked well on her out journey,
  she beat all records on the return. Sometimes she would run till her breath
  failed; then she would slow down till anxiety once more quickened her pace.
  To her joy, on the Dalquharter side of the Garple bridge she observed the
  figure of a Die-Hard. Breathless, flushed, with her bonnet awry and her
  umbrella held like a scimitar, she seized on the boy.</p>

  <p>"Awfu' doin's! They've grippit Maister McCunn up the Mains road just afore
  the second milestone and forenent the auld bucht. I fund his hat, and a
  bicycle's lyin' broken in the wud. Haste ye, man, and get the rest and awa'
  and seek him. It'll be the tinklers frae the Dean. I'd gang misel' but my
  legs are ower auld. Ah, laddie, dinna stop to speir questions. They'll hae
  him murdered or awa' to sea. And maybe the leddy was wi' him and they've got
  them baith. Wae's me! Wae's me!"</p>

  <p>The Die-Hard, who was Wee Jaikie, did not delay. His eyes had filled with
  tears at her news, which we know to have been his habit. When Mrs. Morran,
  after indulging in a moment of barbaric keening, looked back the road she had
  come, she saw a small figure trotting up the hill like a terrier who has been
  left behind. As he trotted he wept bitterly. Jaikie was getting
  dangerous.</p><br>

     id="ref14">CHAPTER 12</a></h3>

  <h2>HOW MR. MCCUNN COMMITTED<br>
  AN ASSAULT UPON AN ALLY</h2>

  <p>Dickson always maintained that his senses did not leave him for more than
  a second or two, but he admitted that he did not remember very clearly the
  events of the next few hours. He was conscious of a bad pain above his eyes,
  and something wet trickling down his cheek. There was a perpetual sound of
  water in his ears and of men's voices. He found himself dropped roughly on
  the ground and forced to walk, and was aware that his legs were inclined to
  wobble. Somebody had a grip on each arm, so that he could not defend his face
  from the brambles, and that worried him, for his whole head seemed one aching
  bruise and he dreaded anything touching it. But all the time he did not open
  his mouth, for silence was the one duty that his muddled wits enforced. He
  felt that he was not the master of his mind, and he dreaded what he might
  disclose if he began to babble.</p>

  <p>Presently there came a blank space of which he had no recollection at all.
  The movement had stopped, and he was allowed to sprawl on the ground. He
  thought that his head had got another whack from a bough, and that the pain
  put him into a stupor. When he awoke he was alone.</p>

  <p>He discovered that he was strapped very tightly to a young Scotch fir. His
  arms were bent behind him and his wrists tied together with cords knotted at
  the back of the tree; his legs were shackled, and further cords fastened them
  to the bole. Also there was a halter round the trunk and just under his chin,
  so that while he breathed freely enough, he could not move his head. Before
  him was a tangle of bracken and scrub, and beyond that the gloom of dense
  pines; but as he could see only directly in front his prospect was strictly
  circumscribed.</p>

  <p>Very slowly he began to take his bearings. The pain in his head was now
  dulled and quite bearable, and the flow of blood had stopped, for he felt the
  encrustation of it beginning on his cheeks. There was a tremendous noise all
  around him, and he traced this to the swaying of tree-tops in the gale. But
  there was an undercurrent of deeper sound&mdash;water surely, water churning
  among rocks. It was a stream&mdash;the Garple of course&mdash; and then he
  remembered where he was and what had happened.</p>

  <p>I do not wish to portray Dickson as a hero, for nothing would annoy him
  more; but I am bound to say that his first clear thought was not of his own
  danger. It was intense exasperation at the miscarriage of his plans. Long ago
  he should have been with Dougal arranging operations, giving him news of Sir
  Archie, finding out how Heritage was faring, deciding how to use the coming
  reinforcements. Instead he was trussed up in a wood, a prisoner of the enemy,
  and utterly useless to his side. He tugged at his bonds, and nearly throttled
  himself. But they were of good tarry cord and did not give a fraction of an
  inch. Tears of bitter rage filled his eyes and made furrows on his encrusted
  cheek. Idiot that he had been, he had wrecked everything! What would Saskia
  and Dougal and Sir Archie do without a business man by their side? There
  would be a muddle, and the little party would walk into a trap. He saw it all
  very clearly. The men from the sea would overpower them, there would be
  murder done, and an easy capture of the Princess; and the police would turn
  up at long last to find an empty headland.</p>

  <p>He had also most comprehensively wrecked himself, and at the thought
  genuine panic seized him. There was no earthly chance of escape, for he was
  tucked away in this infernal jungle till such time as his enemies had time to
  deal with him. As to what that dealing would be like he had no doubts, for
  they knew that he had been their chief opponent. Those desperate ruffians
  would not scruple to put an end to him. His mind dwelt with horrible
  fascination upon throat-cutting, no doubt because of the presence of the cord
  below his chin. He had heard it was not a painful death; at any rate he
  remembered a clerk he had once had, a feeble, timid creature, who had twice
  attempted suicide that way. Surely it could not be very bad, and it would
  soon be over.</p>

  <p>But another thought came to him. They would carry him off in the ship and
  settle with him at their leisure. No swift merciful death for him. He had
  read dreadful tales of the Bolsheviks' skill in torture, and now they all
  came back to him&mdash;stories of Chinese mercenaries, and men buried alive,
  and death by agonizing inches. He felt suddenly very cold and sick, and hung
  in his bonds, for he had no strength in his limbs. Then the pressure on this
  throat braced him, and also quickened his numb mind. The liveliest terror ran
  like quicksilver through his veins.</p>

  <p>He endured some moments of this anguish, till after many despairing
  clutches at his wits he managed to attain a measure of self-control. He
  certainly wasn't going to allow himself to become mad. Death was death
  whatever form it took, and he had to face death as many better men had done
  before him. He had often thought about it and wondered how he should behave
  if the thing came to him. Respectably, he had hoped; heroically, he had sworn
  in his moments of confidence. But he had never for an instant dreamed of this
  cold, lonely, dreadful business. Last Sunday, he remembered, he had basking
  in the afternoon sun in his little garden and reading about the end of Fergus
  MacIvor in <i>Waverley</i> and thrilling to the romance of it; and Tibby had
  come out and summoned him in to tea. Then he had rather wanted to be a
  Jacobite in the '45 and in peril of his neck, and now Providence had taken
  him most terribly at his word.</p>

  <p>A week ago&mdash;! He groaned at the remembrance of that sunny garden. In
  seven days he had found a new world and tried a new life, and had come now to
  the end of it. He did not want to die, less now than ever with such wide
  horizons opening before him. But that was the worst of it, he reflected, for
  to have a great life great hazards must be taken, and there was always the
  risk of this sudden extinguisher...  Had he to choose again, far better the
  smooth sheltered bypath than this accursed romantic highway on to which he
  had blundered...  No, by Heaven, no! Confound it, if he had to choose he
  would do it all again. Something stiff and indomitable in his soul was
  bracing him to a manlier humour. There was no one to see the figure strapped
  to the fir, but had there been a witness he would have noted that at this
  stage Dickson shut his teeth and that his troubled eyes looked very steadily
  before him.</p>

  <p>His business, he felt, was to keep from thinking, for if he thought at all
  there would be a flow of memories&mdash;of his wife, his home, his books, his
  friends&mdash;to unman him. So he steeled himself to blankness, like a
  sleepless man imagining white sheep in a gate...  He noted a robin below the
  hazels, strutting impudently. And there was a tit on a bracken frond, which
  made the thing sway like one of the see-saws he used to play with as a boy.
  There was no wind in that undergrowth, and any movement must be due to bird
  or beast. The tit flew off, and the oscillations of the bracken slowly died
  away. Then they began again, but more violently, and Dickson could not see
  the bird that caused them. It must be something down at the roots of the
  covert, a rabbit, perhaps, or a fox, or a weasel.</p>

  <p>He watched for the first sign of the beast, and thought he caught a
  glimpse of tawny fur. Yes, there it was&mdash;pale dirty yellow, a weasel
  clearly. Then suddenly the patch grow larger, and to his amazement he looked
  at a human face&mdash;the face of a pallid small boy.</p>

  <p>A head disentangled itself, followed by thin shoulders, and then by a pair
  of very dirty bare legs. The figure raised itself and looked sharply round to
  make certain that the coast was clear. Then it stood up and saluted,
  revealing the well-known lineaments of Wee Jaikie.</p>

  <p>At the sight Dickson knew that he was safe by that certainty of instinct
  which is independent of proof, like the man who prays for a sign and has his
  prayer answered. He observed that the boy was quietly sobbing. Jaikie
  surveyed the position for an instant with red-rimmed eyes and then unclasped
  a knife, feeling the edge of the blade on his thumb. He darted behind the
  fir, and a second later Dickson's wrists were free. Then he sawed at the
  legs, and cut the shackles which tied them together, and then&mdash;most
  circumspectly&mdash;assaulted the cord which bound Dickson's neck to the
  trunk. There now remained only the two bonds which fastened the legs and the
  body to the tree.</p>

  <p>There was a sound in the wood different from the wind and stream. Jaikie
  listened like a startled hind.</p>

  <p>"They're comin' back," he gasped. "Just you bide where ye are and let on
  ye're still tied up."</p>

  <p>He disappeared in the scrub as inconspicuously as a rat, while two of the
  tinklers came up the slope from the waterside. Dickson in a fever of
  impatience cursed Wee Jaikie for not cutting his remaining bonds so that he
  could at least have made a dash for freedom. And then he realized that the
  boy had been right. Feeble and cramped as he was, he would have stood no
  chance in a race.</p>

  <p>One of the tinklers was the man called Ecky. He had been running hard, and
  was mopping his brow.</p>

  <p>"Hob's seen the brig," he said. "It's droppin' anchor ayont the Dookits
  whaur there's a bield frae the wund and deep water. They'll be landit in half
  an 'oor. Awa' you up to the Hoose and tell Dobson, and me and Sim and Hob
  will meet the boats at the Garplefit."</p>

  <p>The other cast a glance towards Dickson.</p>

  <p>"What about him?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The two scrutinized their prisoner from a distance of a few paces.
  Dickson, well aware of his peril, held himself as stiff as if every bond had
  been in place. The thought flashed on him that if he were too immobile they
  might think he was dying or dead, and come close to examine him. If they only
  kept their distance, the dusk of the wood would prevent them detecting
  Jaikie's handiwork.</p>

  <p>"What'll you take to let me go?" he asked plaintively.</p>

  <p>"Naething that you could offer, my mannie," said Ecky.</p>

  <p>"I'll give you a five-pound note apiece."</p>

  <p>"Produce the siller," said the other.</p>

  <p>"It's in my pocket."</p>

  <p>"It's no' that. We riped your pooches lang syne."</p>

  <p>"I'll take you to Glasgow with me and pay you there. Honour bright."</p>

  <p>Ecky spat. "D'ye think we're gowks? Man, there's no siller ye could pay
  wad mak' it worth our while to lowse ye. Bide quiet there and ye'll see some
  queer things ere nicht. C'way, Davie."</p>

  <p>The two set off at a good pace down the stream, while Dickson's pulsing
  heart returned to its normal rhythm. As the sound of their feet died away Wee
  Jaikie crawled out from cover, dry-eyed now and very business-like. He slit
  the last thongs, and Dickson fell limply on his face.</p>

  <p>"Losh, laddie, I'm awful stiff," he groaned. "Now, listen. Away all your
  pith to Dougal, and tell him that the brig's in and the men will be landing
  inside the hour. Tell him I'm coming as fast as my legs will let me. The
  Princess will likely be there already and Sir Archibald and his men, but if
  they're no', tell Dougal they're coming. Haste you, Jaikie. And see here,
  I'll never forget what you've done for me the day. You're a fine wee
  laddie!"</p>

  <p>The obedient Die-Hard disappeared, and Dickson painfully and laboriously
  set himself to climb the slope. He decided that his quickest and safest route
  lay by the highroad, and he had also some hopes of recovering his bicycle. On
  examining his body he seemed to have sustained no very great damage, except a
  painful cramping of legs and arms and a certain dizziness in the head. His
  pockets had been thoroughly rifled, and he reflected with amusement that he,
  the well-to-do Mr. McCunn, did not possess at the moment a single copper.</p>

  <p>But his spirits were soaring, for somehow his escape had given him an
  assurance of ultimate success. Providence had directly interfered on his
  behalf by the hand of Wee Jaikie, and that surely meant that it would see him
  through. But his chief emotion was an ardour of impatience to get to the
  scene of action. He must be at Dalquharter before the men from the sea; he
  must find Dougal and discover his dispositions. Heritage would be on guard in
  the Tower, and in a very little the enemy would be round it. It would be just
  like the Princess to try and enter there, but at all costs that must be
  hindered. She and Sir Archie must not be cornered in stone walls, but must
  keep their communications open and fall on the enemy's flank. Oh, if the
  police would only come it time, what a rounding up of miscreants that day
  would see!</p>

  <p>As the trees thinned on the brow of the slope and he saw the sky, he
  realized that the afternoon was far advanced. It must be well on for five
  o'clock. The wind still blew furiously, and the oaks on the fringes of the
  wood were whipped like saplings. Ruefully he admitted that the gale would not
  defeat the enemy. If the brig found a sheltered anchorage on the south side
  of the headland beyond the Garple, it would be easy enough for boats to make
  the Garple mouth, though it might be a difficult job to get out again. The
  thought quickened his steps, and he came out of cover on to the public road
  without a prior reconnaissance. Just in front of him stood a motor-bicycle.
  Something had gone wrong with it for its owner was tinkering at it, on the
  side farthest from Dickson. A wild hope seized him that this might be the
  vanguard of the police, and he went boldly towards it. The owner, who was
  kneeling, raised his face at the sound of footsteps and Dickson looked into
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>He recognized them only too well. They belonged to the man he had seen in
  the inn at Kirkmichael, the man whom Heritage had decided to be an
  Australian, but whom they now know to be their arch-enemy&mdash;the man
  called Paul who had persecuted the Princess for years and whom alone of all
  beings on earth she feared. He had been expected before, but had arrived now
  in the nick of time while the brig was casting anchor. Saskia had said that
  he had a devil's brain, and Dickson, as he stared at him, saw a fiendish
  cleverness in his straight brows and a remorseless cruelty in his stiff jaw
  and his pale eyes.</p>

  <p>He achieved the bravest act of his life. Shaky and dizzy as he was, with
  freedom newly opened to him and the mental torments of his captivity still an
  awful recollection, he did not hesitate. He saw before him the villain of the
  drama, the one man that stood between the Princess and peace of mind. He
  regarded no consequences, gave no heed to his own fate, and thought only how
  to put his enemy out of action. There was a by spanner lying on the ground.
  He seized it and with all his strength smote at the man's face.</p>

  <p>The motor-cyclist, kneeling and working hard at his machine, had raised
  his head at Dickson's approach and beheld a wild apparition&mdash;a short man
  in ragged tweeds, with a bloody brow and long smears of blood on his cheeks.
  The next second he observed the threat of attack, and ducked his head so that
  the spanner only grazed his scalp. The motor-bicycle toppled over, its owner
  sprang to his feet, and found the short man, very pale and gasping, about to
  renew the assault. In such a crisis there was no time for inquiry, and the
  cyclist was well trained in self-defence. He leaped the prostrate bicycle,
  and before his assailant could get in a blow brought his left fist into
  violent contact with his chin. Dickson tottered a step or two and then
  subsided among the bracken.</p>

  <p>He did not lose his senses, but he had no more strength in him. He felt
  horribly ill, and struggled in vain to get up. The cyclist, a gigantic
  figure, towered above him. "Who the devil are you?" he was asking. "What do
  you mean by it?"</p>

  <p>Dickson had no breath for words, and knew that if he tried to speak he
  would be very sick. He could only stare up like a dog at the angry eyes.
  Angry beyond question they were, but surely not malevolent. Indeed, as they
  looked at the shameful figure on the ground, amusement filled them. The face
  relaxed into a smile.</p>

  <p>"Who on earth are you?" the voice repeated. And then into it came
  recognition. "I've seen you before. I believe you're the little man I saw
  last week at the Black Bull. Be so good as to explain why you want to murder
  me."</p>

  <p>Explanation was beyond Dickson, but his conviction was being woefully
  shaken. Saskia had said her enemy was a beautiful as a devil&mdash;he
  remembered the phrase, for he had thought it ridiculous. This man was
  magnificent, but there was nothing devilish in his lean grave face.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?" the voice was asking.</p>

  <p>"Tell me yours first," Dickson essayed to stutter between spasms of
  nausea.</p>

  <p>"My name is Alexander Nicholson," was the answer.</p>

  <p>"Then you're no' the man." It was a cry of wrath and despair.</p>

  <p>"You're a very desperate little chap. For whom had I the honour to be
  mistaken?"</p>

  <p>Dickson had now wriggled into a sitting position and had clasped his hands
  above his aching head.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were a Russian, name of Paul," he groaned.</p>

  <p>"Paul! Paul who?"</p>

  <p>"Just Paul. A Bolshevik and an awful bad lot."</p>

  <p>Dickson could not see the change which his words wrought in the other's
  face. He found himself picked up in strong arms and carried to a bog-pool
  where his battered face was carefully washed, his throbbing brows laved, and
  a wet handkerchief bound over them. Then he was given brandy in the socket of
  a flask, which eased his nausea. The cyclist ran his bicycle to the roadside,
  and found a seat for Dickson behind the turf-dyke of the old bucht.</p>

  <p>"Now you are going to tell me everything," he said. "If the Paul who is
  your enemy is the Paul I think him, then we are allies."</p>

  <p>But Dickson did not need this assurance. His mind had suddenly received a
  revelation. The Princess had expected an enemy, but also a friend. Might not
  this be the long-awaited friend, for whose sake she was rooted to
  Huntingtower with all its terrors?</p>

  <p>"Are you sure your name's no' Alexis?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"In my own country I was called Alexis Nicolaevitch, for I am a Russian.
  But for some years I have made my home with your folk, and I call myself
  Alexander Nicholson, which is the English form. Who told you about
  Alexis?</p>

  <p>"Give me your hand," said Dickson shamefacedly. "Man, she's been looking
  for you for weeks. You're terribly behind the fair."</p>

  <p>"She!" he cried. "For God's sake, tell me what you mean."</p>

  <p>"Ay, she&mdash;the Princess. But what are we havering here for? I tell you
  at this moment she's somewhere down about the old Tower, and there's
  boatloads of blagyirds landing from the sea. Help me up, man, for I must be
  off. The story will keep. Losh, it's very near the darkening. If you're
  Alexis, you're just about in time for a battle."</p>

  <p>But Dickson on his feet was but a frail creature. He was still deplorably
  giddy, and his legs showed an unpleasing tendency to crumple. "I'm fair
  done," he moaned. "You see, I've been tied up all day to a tree and had two
  sore bashes on my head. Get you on that bicycle and hurry on, and I'll hirple
  after you the best I can. I'll direct you the road, and if you're lucky
  you'll find a Die-Hard about the village. Away with you, man, and never mind
  me."</p>

  <p>"We go together," said the other quietly. "You can sit behind me and hang
  on to my waist. Before you turned up I had pretty well got the thing in
  order."</p>

  <p>Dickson in a fever of impatience sat by while the Russian put the
  finishing touches to the machine, and as well as his anxiety allowed put him
  in possession of the main facts of the story. He told of how he and Heritage
  had come to Dalquharter, of the first meeting with Saskia, of the trip to
  Glasgow with the jewels, of the exposure of Loudon the factor, of last
  night's doings in the House, and of the journey that morning to the Mains of
  Garple. He sketched the figures on the scene&mdash;Heritage and Sir Archie,
  Dobson and his gang, the Gorbals Die-Hards. He told of the enemy's plans so
  far as he knew them.</p>

  <p>"Looked at from a business point of view," he said, "the situation's like
  this. There's Heritage in the Tower, with Dobson, Leon, and Spidel sitting
  round him. Somewhere about the place there's the Princess and Sir Archibald
  and three men with guns from the Mains. Dougal and his five laddies are
  running loose in the policies. And there's four tinklers and God knows how
  many foreign ruffians pushing up from the Garplefoot, and a brig lying
  waiting to carry off the ladies. Likewise there's the police, somewhere on
  the road, though the dear kens when they'll turn up. It's awful the
  incompetence of our Government, and the rates and taxes that high!...  And
  there's you and me by this roadside, and me no more use than a tattie-bogle
 ...  That's the situation, and the question is what's our plan to be? We must
  keep the blagyirds in play till the police come, and at the same time we must
  keep the Princess out of danger. That's why I'm wanting back, for they've
  sore need of a business head. Yon Sir Archibald's a fine fellow, but I doubt
  he'll be a bit rash, and the Princess is no' to hold or bind. Our first job
  is to find Dougal and get a grip of the facts."</p>

  <p>"I am going to the Princess," said the Russian.</p>

  <p>"Ay, that'll be best. You'll be maybe able to manage her, for you'll be
  well acquaint."</p>

  <p>"She is my kinswoman. She is also my affianced wife."</p>

  <p>"Keep us!" Dickson exclaimed, with a doleful thought of Heritage. "What
  ailed you then no' to look after her better?"</p>

  <p>"We have been long separated, because it was her will. She had work to do
  and disappeared from me, though I searched all Europe for her. Then she sent
  me word, when the danger became extreme, and summoned me to her aid. But she
  gave me poor directions, for she did not know her own plans very clearly. She
  spoke of a place called Darkwater, and I have been hunting half Scotland for
  it. It was only last night that I heard of Dalquharter and guessed that that
  might be the name. But I was far down in Galloway, and have ridden fifty
  miles today."</p>

  <p>"It's a queer thing, but I wouldn't take you for a Russian."</p>

  <p>Alexis finished his work and put away his tools.</p>

  <p>"For the present," he said, "I am an Englishman, till my country comes
  again to her senses. Ten years ago I left Russia, for I was sick of the
  foolishness of my class and wanted a free life in a new world. I went to
  Australia and made good as an engineer. I am a partner in a firm which is
  pretty well known even in Britain. When war broke out I returned to fight for
  my people, and when Russia fell out of the war, I joined the Australians in
  France and fought with them till the Armistice. And now I have only one duty
  left, to save the Princess and take her with me to my new home till Russia is
  a nation once more."</p>

  <p>Dickson whistled joyfully. "So Mr. Heritage was right. He aye said you
  were an Australian...  And you're a business man! That's grand hearing and
  puts my mind at rest. You must take charge of the party at the House, for Sir
  Archibald's a daft young lad and Mr. Heritage is a poet. I thought I would
  have to go myself, but I doubt I would just be a hindrance with my dwaibly
  legs. I'd be better outside, watching for the police...  Are you ready,
  sir?"</p>

  <p>Dickson not without difficulty perched himself astride the luggage
  carrier, firmly grasping the rider round the middle. The machine started, but
  it was evidently in a bad way, for it made poor going till the descent
  towards the main Auchenlochan road. On the slope it warmed up and they
  crossed the Garple bridge at a fair pace. There was to be no pleasant April
  twilight, for the stormy sky had already made dusk, and in a very little the
  dark would fall. So sombre was the evening that Dickson did not notice a
  figure in the shadow of the roadside pines till it whistled shrilly on its
  fingers. He cried on Alexis to stop, and, this being accomplished with some
  suddenness, fell off at Dougal's feet.</p>

  <p>"What's the news?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Dougal glanced at Alexis and seemed to approve his looks.</p>

  <p>"Napoleon has just reported that three boatloads, making either
  twenty-three or twenty-four men&mdash;they were gey ill to count&mdash; has
  landed at Garplefit and is makin' their way to the auld Tower. The tinklers
  warned Dobson and soon it'll be a' bye wi' Heritage."</p>

  <p>"The Princess is not there?" was Dickson's anxious inquiry.</p>

  <p>"Na, na. Heritage is there his lone. They were for joinin' him, but I
  wouldn't let them. She came wi' a man they call Sir Erchibald and three
  gamekeepers wi' guns. I stoppit their cawr up the road and tell't them the
  lie o' the land. Yon Sir Erchibald has poor notions o' strawtegy. He was for
  bangin' into the auld Tower straight away and shootin' Dobson if he tried to
  stop them. 'Havers,' say I, 'let them break their teeth on the Tower,
  thinkin' the leddy's inside, and that'll give us time, for Heritage is no'
  the lad to surrender in a hurry.'"</p>

  <p>"Where are they now?"</p>

  <p>"In the Hoose o' Dalquharter, and a sore job I had gettin' them in. We've
  shifted our base again, without the enemy suspectin'."</p>

  <p>"Any word of the police?"</p>

  <p>"The polis!" and Dougal spat cynically. "It seems they're a dour crop to
  shift. Sir Erchibald was sayin' that him and the lassie had been to the Chief
  Constable, but the man was terrible auld and slow. They persuadit him, but he
  threepit that it would take a long time to collect his men and that there was
  no danger o' the brig landin' before night. He's wrong there onyway, for
  they're landit."</p>

  <p>"Dougal," said Dickson, "you've heard the Princess speak of a friend she
  was expecting here called Alexis. This is him. You can address him as Mr.
  Nicholson. Just arrived in the nick of time. You must get him into the House,
  for he's the best right to be beside the lady...  Jaikie would tell you that
  I've been sore mishandled the day, and am no' very fit for a battle. But Mr.
  Nicholson's a business man and he'll do as well. You're keeping the Die-Hards
  outside, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"Ay. Thomas Yownie's in charge, and Jaikie will be in and out with orders.
  They've instructions to watch for the polis, and keep an eye on the
  Garplefit. It's a mortal long front to hold, but there's no other way. I must
  be in the hoose mysel'. Thomas Yownie's headquarters is the auld wife's
  hen-hoose."</p>

  <p>At that moment in a pause of the gale came the far-borne echo of a
  shot.</p>

  <p>"Pistol," said Alexis.</p>

  <p>"Heritage," said Dougal. "Trade will be gettin' brisk with him. Start your
  machine and I'll hang on ahint. We'll try the road by the West Lodge."</p>

  <p>Presently the pair disappeared in the dusk, the noise of the engine was
  swallowed up in the wild orchestra of the wind, and Dickson hobbled towards
  the village in a state of excitement which made him oblivious of his wounds.
  That lonely pistol shot was, he felt, the bell to ring up the curtain on the
  last act of the play.</p><br>

     id="ref15">CHAPTER 13</a></h3>

  <h2>THE COMING OF THE DANISH BRIG</h2>

  <p>Mr. John Heritage, solitary in the old Tower, found much to occupy his
  mind. His giddiness was passing, though the dregs of a headache remained, and
  his spirits rose with his responsibilities. At daybreak he breakfasted out of
  the Mearns Street provision box, and made tea in one of the Die-Hard's camp
  kettles. Next he gave some attention to his toilet, necessary after the
  rough-and-tumble of the night. He made shift to bathe in icy water from the
  Tower well, shaved, tidied up his clothes and found a clean shirt from his
  pack. He carefully brushed his hair, reminding himself that thus had the
  Spartans done before Thermopylae. The neat and somewhat pallid young man that
  emerged from these rites then ascended to the first floor to reconnoitre the
  landscape from the narrow unglazed windows.</p>

  <p>If any one had told him a week ago that he would be in so strange a world
  he would have quarrelled violently with his informant. A week ago he was a
  cynical clear-sighted modern, a contemner of illusions, a swallower of
  formulas, a breaker of shams&mdash;one who had seen through the heroical and
  found it silly. Romance and such-like toys were playthings for fatted
  middle-age, not for strenuous and cold-eyed youth. But the truth was that now
  he was altogether spellbound by these toys. To think that he was serving his
  lady was rapture-ecstasy, that for her he was single-handed venturing all. He
  rejoiced to be alone with his private fancies. His one fear was that the part
  he had cast himself for might be needless, that the men from the sea would
  not come, or that reinforcements would arrive before he should be called
  upon. He hoped alone to make a stand against thousands. What the upshot might
  be he did not trouble to inquire. Of course the Princess would be saved, but
  first he must glut his appetite for the heroic.</p>

  <p>He made a diary of events that day, just as he used to do at the front. At
  twenty minutes past eight he saw the first figure coming from the House. It
  was Spidel, who limped round the Tower, tried the door, and came to a halt
  below the window. Heritage stuck out his head and wished him good morning,
  getting in reply an amazed stare. The man was not disposed to talk, though
  Heritage made some interesting observations on the weather, but departed
  quicker than he came, in the direction of the West Lodge.</p>

  <p>Just before nine o'clock he returned with Dobson and Leon. They made a
  very complete reconnaissance of the Tower, and for a moment Heritage thought
  that they were about to try to force an entrance. They tugged and hammered at
  the great oak door, which he had further strengthened by erecting behind it a
  pile of the heaviest lumber he could find in the place. It was imperative
  that they should not get in, and he got Dickson's pistol ready with the firm
  intention of shooting them if necessary. But they did nothing, except to hold
  a conference in the hazel clump a hundred yards to the north, when Dobson
  seemed to be laying down the law, and Leon spoke rapidly with a great
  fluttering of hands. They were obviously puzzled by the sight of Heritage,
  whom they believed to have left the neighbourhood. Then Dobson went off,
  leaving Leon and Spidel on guard, one at the edge of the shrubberies between
  the Tower and the House, the other on the side nearest the Laver glen. These
  were their posts, but they did sentry-go around the building, and passed so
  close to Heritage's window that he could have tossed a cigarette on their
  heads.</p>

  <p>It occurred to him that he ought to get busy with camouflage. They must be
  convinced that the Princess was in the place, for he wanted their whole mind
  to be devoted to the siege. He rummaged among the ladies' baggage, and
  extracted a skirt and a coloured scarf. The latter he managed to flutter so
  that it could be seen at the window the next time one of the watchers came
  within sight. He also fixed up the skirt so that the fringe of it could be
  seen, and, when Leon appeared below, he was in the shadow talking rapid
  French in a very fair imitation of the tones of Cousin Eugenie. The ruse had
  its effect, for Leon promptly went off to tell Spidel, and when Dobson
  appeared he too was given the news. This seemed to settle their plans, for
  all three remained on guard, Dobson nearest to the Tower, seated on an
  outcrop of rock with his mackintosh collar turned up, and his eyes usually on
  the misty sea.</p>

  <p>By this time it was eleven o'clock, and the next three hours passed slowly
  with Heritage. He fell to picturing the fortunes of his friends. Dickson and
  the Princess should by this time be far inland, out of danger and in the way
  of finding succour. He was confident that they would return, but he trusted
  not too soon, for he hoped for a run for his money as Horatius in the Gate.
  After that he was a little torn in his mind. He wanted the Princess to come
  back and to be somewhere near if there was a fight going, so that she might
  be a witness of his devotion. But she must not herself run any risk, and he
  became anxious when he remembered her terrible sangfroid. Dickson could no
  more restrain her than a child could hold a greyhound...  But of course it
  would never come to that. The police would turn up long before the brig
  appeared&mdash;Dougal had thought that would not be till high tide, between
  four and five&mdash;and the only danger would be to the pirates. The three
  watchers would be put in the bag, and the men from the sea would walk into a
  neat trap. This reflection seemed to take all the colour out of Heritage's
  prospect. Peril and heroism were not to be his lot&mdash;only boredom.</p>

  <p>A little after twelve two of the tinklers appeared with some news which
  made Dobson laugh and pat them on the shoulder. He seemed to be giving them
  directions, pointing seaward and southward. He nodded to the Tower, where
  Heritage took the opportunity of again fluttering Saskia's scarf athwart the
  window. The tinklers departed at a trot, and Dobson lit his pipe as if well
  pleased. He had some trouble with it in the wind, which had risen to an
  uncanny violence. Even the solid Tower rocked with it, and the sea was a
  waste of spindrift and low scurrying cloud. Heritage discovered a new
  anxiety&mdash;this time about the possibility of the brig landing at all. He
  wanted a complete bag, and it would be tragic if they got only the three
  seedy ruffians now circumambulating his fortress.</p>

  <p>About one o'clock he was greatly cheered by the sight of Dougal. At the
  moment Dobson was lunching off a hunk of bread and cheese directly between
  the Tower and the House, just short of the crest of the ridge on the other
  side of which lay the stables and the shrubberies; Leon was on the north side
  opposite the Tower door, and Spidel was at the south end near the edge of the
  Garple glen. Heritage, watching the ridge behind Dobson and the upper windows
  of the House which appeared over it, saw on the very crest something like a
  tuft of rusty bracken which he had not noticed before. Presently the tuft
  moved, and a hand shot up from it waving a rag of some sort. Dobson at the
  moment was engaged with a bottle of porter, and Heritage could safely wave a
  hand in reply. He could now make out clearly the red head of Dougal.</p>

  <p>The Chieftain, having located the three watchers, proceeded to give an
  exhibition of his prowess for the benefit of the lonely inmate of the Tower.
  Using as cover a drift of bracken, he wormed his way down till he was not six
  yards from Dobson, and Heritage had the privilege of seeing his grinning
  countenance a very little way above the innkeeper's head. Then he crawled
  back and reached the neighbourhood of Leon, who was sitting on a fallen
  Scotch fir. At that moment it occurred to the Belgian to visit Dobson.
  Heritage's breath stopped, but Dougal was ready, and froze into a motionless
  blur in the shadow of a hazel bush. Then he crawled very fast into the hollow
  where Leon had been sitting, seized something which looked like a bottle, and
  scrambled back to the ridge. At the top he waved the object, whatever it was,
  but Heritage could not reply, for Dobson happened to be looking towards the
  window. That was the last he saw of the Chieftain, but presently he realized
  what was the booty he had annexed. It must be Leon's life-preserver, which
  the night before had broken Heritage's head.</p>

  <p>After that cheering episode boredom again set in. He collected some food
  from the Mearns Street box, and indulged himself with a glass of liqueur
  brandy. He was beginning to feel miserably cold, so he carried up some broken
  wood and made a fire on the immense hearth in the upper chamber. Anxiety was
  clouding his mind again, for it was now two o'clock, and there was no sign of
  the reinforcements which Dickson and the Princess had gone to find. The
  minutes passed, and soon it was three o'clock, and from the window he saw
  only the top of the gaunt shuttered House, now and then hidden by squalls of
  sleet, and Dobson squatted like an Eskimo, and trees dancing like a
  witch-wood in the gale. All the vigour of the morning seemed to have gone out
  of his blood; he felt lonely and apprehensive and puzzled. He wished he had
  Dickson beside him, for that little man's cheerful voice and complacent
  triviality would be a comfort...  Also, he was abominably cold. He put on his
  waterproof, and turned his attention to the fire. It needed re-kindling, and
  he hunted in his pockets for paper, finding only the slim volume lettered
  <i>Whorls.</i></p>

  <p>I set it down as the most significant commentary on his state of mind. He
  regarded the book with intense disfavour, tore it in two, and used a handful
  of its fine deckle-edged leaves to get the fire going. They burned well, and
  presently the rest followed. Well for Dickson's peace of soul that he was not
  a witness of such vandalism.</p>

  <p>A little warmer but in no way more cheerful, he resumed his watch near the
  window. The day was getting darker, and promised an early dusk. His watch
  told him that it was after four, and still nothing had happened. Where on
  earth were Dickson and the Princess? Where in the name of all that was holy
  were the police? Any minute now the brig might arrive and land its men, and
  he would be left there as a burnt-offering to their wrath. There must have
  been an infernal muddle somewhere...  Anyhow the Princess was out of the
  trouble, but where the Lord alone knew...  Perhaps the reinforcements were
  lying in wait for the boats at the Garplefoot. That struck him as a likely
  explanation, and comforted him. Very soon he might hear the sound of an
  engagement to the south, and the next thing would be Dobson and his crew in
  flight. He was determined to be in the show somehow and would be very close
  on their heels. He felt a peculiar dislike to all three, but especially to
  Leon. The Belgian's small baby features had for four days set him clenching
  his fists when he thought of them.</p>

  <p>The next thing he saw was one of the tinklers running hard towards the
  Tower. He cried something to Dobson, which woke the latter to activity. The
  innkeeper shouted to Leon and Spidel, and the tinkler was excitedly
  questioned. Dobson laughed and slapped his thigh. He gave orders to the
  others, and himself joined the tinkler and hurried off in the direction of
  the Garplefoot. Something was happening there, something of ill omen, for the
  man's face and manner had been triumphant. Were the boats landing?</p>

  <p>As Heritage puzzled over this event, another figure appeared on the scene.
  It was a big man in knickerbockers and mackintosh, who came round the end of
  the House from the direction of the South Lodge. At first he thought it was
  the advance-guard from his own side, the help which Dickson had gone to find,
  and he only restrained himself in time from shouting a welcome. But surely
  their supports would not advance so confidently in enemy country. The man
  strode over the slopes as if looking for somebody; then he caught sight of
  Leon and waved to him to come. Leon must have known him, for he hastened to
  obey.</p>

  <p>The two were about thirty yards from Heritage's window. Leon was telling
  some story volubly, pointing now to the Tower and now towards the sea. The
  big man nodded as if satisfied. Heritage noted that his right arm was tied
  up, and that the mackintosh sleeve was empty, and that brought him
  enlightenment. It was Loudon the factor, whom Dickson had winged the night
  before. The two of them passed out of view in the direction of Spidel.</p>

  <p>The sight awoke Heritage to the supreme unpleasantness of his position. He
  was utterly alone on the headland, and his allies had vanished into space,
  while the enemy plans, moving like clockwork, were approaching their
  consummation. For a second he thought of leaving the Tower and hiding
  somewhere in the cliffs. He dismissed the notion unwillingly, for he
  remembered the task that had been set him. He was there to hold the fort to
  the last&mdash;to gain time, though he could not for the life of him see what
  use time was to be when all the strategy of his own side seemed to have
  miscarried. Anyhow, the blackguards would be sold, for they would not find
  the Princess. But he felt a horrid void in the pit of his stomach, and a
  looseness about his knees.</p>

  <p>The moments passed more quickly as he wrestled with his fears. The next he
  knew the empty space below his window was filling with figures. There was a
  great crowd of them, rough fellows with seamen's coats, still dripping as if
  they had had a wet landing. Dobson was with them, but for the rest they were
  strange figures.</p>

  <p>Now that the expected had come at last Heritage's nerves grew calmer. He
  made out that the newcomers were trying the door, and he waited to hear it
  fall, for such a mob could soon force it. But instead a voice called from
  beneath.</p>

  <p>"Will you please open to us?" it called.</p>

  <p>He stuck his head out and saw a little group with one man at the head of
  it, a young man clad in oilskins whose face was dim in the murky evening. The
  voice was that of a gentleman.</p>

  <p>"I have orders to open to no one," Heritage replied.</p>

  <p>"Then I fear we must force an entrance," said the voice.</p>

  <p>"You can go to the devil," said Heritage.</p>

  <p>That defiance was the screw which his nerves needed. His temper had risen,
  he had forgotten all about the Princess, he did not even remember his
  isolation. His job was to make a fight for it. He ran up the staircase which
  led to the attics of the Tower, for he recollected that there was a window
  there which looked over the space before the door. The place was ruinous, the
  floor filled with holes, and a part of the roof sagged down in a corner. The
  stones around the window were loose and crumbling, and he managed to pull
  several out so that the slit was enlarged. He found himself looking down on a
  crowd of men, who had lifted the fallen tree on which Leon had perched, and
  were about to use it as a battering ram.</p>

  <p>"The first fellow who comes within six yards of the door I shoot," he
  shouted.</p>

  <p>There was a white wave below as every face was turned to him. He ducked
  back his head in time as a bullet chipped the side of the window.</p>

  <p>But his position was a good one, for he had a hole in the broken wall
  through which he could see, and could shoot with his hand at the edge of the
  window while keeping his body in cover. The battering party resumed their
  task, and as the tree swung nearer, he fired at the foremost of them. He
  missed, but the shot for a moment suspended operations.</p>

  <p>Again they came on, and again he fired. This time he damaged somebody, for
  the trunk was dropped.</p>

  <p>A voice gave orders, a sharp authoritative voice. The battering squad
  dissolved, and there was a general withdrawal out of the line of fire from
  the window. Was it possible that he had intimidated them? He could hear the
  sound of voices, and then a single figure came into sight again, holding
  something in its hand.</p>

  <p>He did not fire for he recognized the futility of his efforts. The
  baseball swing of the figure below could not be mistaken. There was a roar
  beneath, and a flash of fire, as the bomb exploded on the door. Then came a
  rush of men, and the Tower had fallen. Heritage clambered through a hole in
  the roof and gained the topmost parapet. He had still a pocketful of
  cartridges, and there in a coign of the old battlements he would prove an
  ugly customer to the pursuit. Only one at a time could reach that siege
  perilous...  They would not take long to search the lower rooms, and then
  would be hot on the trail of the man who had fooled them. He had not a scrap
  of fear left or even of anger&mdash;only triumph at the thought of how
  properly those ruffians had been sold. "Like schoolboys they who
  unaware"&mdash;instead of two women they had found a man with a gun. And the
  Princess was miles off and forever beyond their reach. When they had settled
  with him they would no doubt burn the House down, but that would serve them
  little. From his airy pinnacle he could see the whole sea-front of
  Huntingtower, a blur in the dusk but for the ghostly eyes of its
  white-shuttered windows.</p>

  <p>Something was coming from it, running lightly over the lawns, lost for an
  instant in the trees, and then appearing clear on the crest of the ridge
  where some hours earlier Dougal had lain. With horror he saw that it was a
  girl. She stood with the wind plucking at her skirts and hair, and she cried
  in a high, clear voice which pierced even the confusion of the gale. What she
  cried he could not tell, for it was in a strange tongue... </p>

  <p>But it reached the besiegers. There was a sudden silence in the din below
  him and then a confusion of shouting. The men seemed to be pouring out of the
  gap which had been the doorway, and as he peered over the parapet first one
  and then another entered his area of vision. The girl on the ridge, as soon
  as she saw that she had attracted attention, turned and ran back, and after
  her up the slopes went the pursuit bunched like hounds on a good scent.</p>

  <p>Mr. John Heritage, swearing terribly, started to retrace his
  steps.</p><br>

  <h2>THE SECOND BATTLE OF THE CRUIVES</h2>

  <p>The military historian must often make shift to write of battles with
  slender data, but he can pad out his deficiencies by learned parallels. If
  his were the talented pen describing this, the latest action fought on
  British soil against a foreign foe, he would no doubt be crippled by the
  absence of written orders and war diaries. But how eloquently he would
  descant on the resemblance between Dougal and Gouraud&mdash;how the plan of
  leaving the enemy to waste his strength upon a deserted position was that
  which on the 15th of July 1918 the French general had used with decisive
  effect in Champagne! But Dougal had never heard of Gouraud, and I cannot
  claim that, like the Happy Warrior, he</p>

  <p>"through the heat of conflict kept the law In calmness made, and saw what
  he foresaw."</p>

  <p>I have had the benefit of discussing the affair with him and his
  colleagues, but I should offend against historic truth if I represented the
  main action as anything but a scrimmage&mdash;a "soldiers' battle," the
  historian would say, a Malplaquet, an Albuera.</p>

  <p>Just after half-past three that afternoon the Commander-in-Chief was
  revealed in a very bad temper. He had intercepted Sir Archie's car, and,
  since Leon was known to be fully occupied, had brought it in by the West
  Lodge, and hidden it behind a clump of laurels. There he had held a hoarse
  council of war. He had cast an appraising eye over Sime the butler, Carfrae
  the chauffeur, and McGuffog the gamekeeper, and his brows had lightened when
  he beheld Sir Archie with an armful of guns and two big cartridge-magazines.
  But they had darkened again at the first words of the leader of the
  reinforcements.</p>

  <p>"Now for the Tower,' Sir Archie had observed cheerfully. "We should be a
  match for the three watchers, my lad, and it's time that poor devil
  What's-his-name was relieved."</p>

  <p>"A bonny-like plan that would be," said Dougal. "Man, ye would be walkin'
  into the very trap they want. In an hour, or maybe two, the rest will turn up
  from the sea and they'd have ye tight by the neck. Na, na! It's time we're
  wantin', and the longer they think we're a' in the auld Tower the better for
  us. What news o' the polis?"</p>

  <p>He listened to Sir Archie's report with a gloomy face.</p>

  <p>"Not afore the darkenin'? They'll be ower late&mdash;the polis are aye
  ower late. It looks as if we had the job to do oursels. What's your
  notion?"</p>

  <p>"God knows," said the baronet, whose eyes were on Saskia. "What's
  yours?"</p>

  <p>The deference conciliated Dougal. "There's just the one plan that's worth
  a docken. There's five o' us here, and there's plenty weapons. Besides
  there's five Die-Hards somewhere about, and though they've never tried it
  afore they can be trusted to loose off a gun. My advice is to hide at the
  Garplefoot and stop the boats landin'. We'd have the tinklers on our flank,
  no doubt, but I'm not muckle feared o' them. It wouldn't be easy for the
  boats to get in wi' this tearin' wind and us firin' volleys from the
  shore."</p>

  <p>Sir Archie stared at him with admiration. "You're a hearty young
  fire-eater. But, Great Scott! we can't go pottin' at strangers before we find
  out their business. This is a law-abidin' country, and we're not entitled to
  start shootin' except in self-defence. You can wash that plan out, for it
  ain't feasible."</p>

  <p>Dougal spat cynically. "For all that it's the right strawtegy. Man, we
  might sink the lot, and then turn and settle wi' Dobson, and all afore the
  first polisman showed his neb. It would be a grand performance. But I was
  feared ye wouldn't be for it...  Well, there's just the one other thing to
  do. We must get inside the Hoose and put it in a state of defence. Heritage
  has McCunn's pistol, and he'll keep them busy for a bit. When they've
  finished wi' him and find the place is empty, they'll try the Hoose and we'll
  give them a warm reception. That should keep us goin' till the polis arrive,
  unless they're comin' wi' the blind carrier."</p>

  <p>Sir Archie nodded. "But why put ourselves in their power at all? They're
  at present barking up the wrong tree. Let them bark up another wrong 'un. Why
  shouldn't the House remain empty? I take it we're here to protect the
  Princess. Well, we'll have done that if they go off empty-handed."</p>

  <p>Dougal looked up to the heavens. "I wish McCunn was here," he sighed. "Ay,
  we've got to protect the Princess, and there's just the one way to do it, and
  that's to put an end to this crowd o' blagyirds. If they gang empty-handed,
  they'll come again another day, either here or somewhere else, and it won't
  be long afore they get the lassie. But if we finish with them now she can sit
  down wi' an easy mind. That's why we've got to hang on to them till the polis
  comes. There's no way out o' this business but a battle."</p>

  <p>He found an ally. "Dougal is right," said Saskia. "If I am to have peace,
  by some way or other the fangs of my enemies must be drawn for ever."</p>

  <p>He swung round and addressed her formally. "Mem, I'm askin' ye for the
  last time. Will ye keep out of this business? Will ye gang back and sit doun
  aside Mrs. Morran's fire and have your teas and wait till we come for ye. Ye
  can do no good, and ye're puttin' yourself terrible in the enemy's power. If
  we're beat and ye're no' there, they get very little satisfaction, but if
  they get you they get what they've come seekin'. I tell ye straight&mdash;
  ye're an encumbrance."</p>

  <p>She laughed mischievously. "I can shoot better than you," she said.</p>

  <p>He ignored the taunt. "Will ye listen to sense and fall to the rear?"</p>

  <p>"I will not," she said.</p>

  <p>"Then gang your own gait. I'm ower wise to argy-bargy wi' women. The Hoose
  be it!"</p>

  <p>It was a journey which sorely tried Dougal's temper. The only way in was
  by the verandah, but the door at the west end had been locked, and the ladder
  had disappeared. Now, of his party three were lame, one lacked an arm, and
  one was a girl; besides, there were the guns and cartridges to transport.
  Moreover, at more than one point before the verandah was reached the route
  was commanded by a point on the ridge near the old Tower, and that had been
  Spidel's position when Dougal made his last reconnaissance. It behoved to
  pass these points swiftly and unobtrusively, and his company was neither
  swift nor unobtrusive. McGuffog had a genius for tripping over obstacles, and
  Sir Archie was for ever proffering his aid to Saskia, who was in a position
  to give rather than to receive, being far the most active of the party. Once
  Dougal had to take the gamekeeper's head and force it down, a performance
  which would have led to an immediate assault but for Sir Archie's presence.
  Nor did the latter escape. "Will ye stop heedin' the lassie, and attend to
  your own job," the Chieftain growled. "Ye're makin' as much noise as a
  roadroller."</p>

  <p>Arrived at the foot of the verandah wall there remained the problem of the
  escalade. Dougal clambered up like a squirrel by the help of cracks in the
  stones, and he could be heard trying the handle of the door into the House.
  He was absent for about five minutes, and then his head peeped over the edge
  accompanied by the hooks of an iron ladder. "From the boiler-house," he
  informed them as they stood clear for the thing to drop. It proved to be
  little more than half the height of the wall.</p>

  <p>Saskia ascended first, and had no difficulty in pulling herself over the
  parapet. Then came the guns and ammunition, and then the one-armed Sime, who
  turned out to be an athlete. But it was no easy matter getting up the last
  three. Sir Archie anathematized his frailties. "Nice old crock to go
  tiger&mdash;shootin' with," he told the Princess. "But set me to something
  where my confounded leg don't get in the way, and I'm still pretty useful!"
  Dougal, mopping his brow with the rag he called his handkerchief, observed
  sourly that he objected to going scouting with a herd of elephants.</p>

  <p>Once indoors his spirits rose. The party from the Mains had brought
  several electric torches, and the one lamp was presently found and lit. "We
  can't count on the polis," Dougal announced, "and when the foreigners is
  finished wi' the Tower they'll come on here. If no', we must make them. What
  is it the sodgers call it? Forcin' a battle? Now see here! There's the two
  roads into this place, the back door and the verandy, leavin' out the front
  door which is chained and lockit. They'll try those two roads first, and we
  must get them well barricaded in time. But mind, if there's a good few o'
  them, it'll be an easy job to batter in the front door or the windies, so we
  maun be ready for that."</p>

  <p>He told off a fatigue party&mdash;the Princess, Sir Archie, and
  McGuffog&mdash;to help in moving furniture to the several doors. Sime and
  Carfrae attended to the kitchen entrance, while he himself made a tour of the
  ground-floor windows. For half an hour the empty house was loud with strange
  sounds. McGuffog, who was a giant in strength, filled the passage at the
  verandah end with an assortment of furniture ranging from a grand piano to a
  vast mahogany sofa, while Saskia and Sir Archie pillaged the bedrooms and
  packed up the interstices with mattresses in lieu of sandbags. Dougal on his
  turn saw fit to approve the work.</p>

  <p>"That'll fickle the blagyirds. Down at the kitchen door we've got a
  mangle, five wash-tubs, and the best part of a ton o' coal. It's the windies
  I'm anxious about, for they're ower big to fill up. But I've gotten tubs of
  water below them and a lot o' wire-nettin' I fund in the cellar."</p>

  <p>Sir Archie morosely wiped his brow. "I can't say I ever hated a job more,"
  he told Saskia. "It seems pretty cool to march into somebody else's house and
  make free with his furniture. I hope to goodness our friends from the sea do
  turn up, or we'll look pretty foolish. Loudon will have a score against me he
  won't forget."</p>

  <p>"Ye're no' weakenin'?" asked Dougal fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Not a bit. Only hopin' somebody hasn't made a mighty big mistake."</p>

  <p>"Ye needn't be feared for that. Now you listen to your instructions. We're
  terrible few for such a big place, but we maun make up for shortness o'
  numbers by extra mobility. The gemkeeper will keep the windy that looks on
  the verandy, and fell any man that gets through. You'll hold the verandy
  door, and the ither lame man&mdash;is't Carfrae ye call him?&mdash;will keep
  the back door. I've telled the one-armed man, who has some kind of a head on
  him, that he maun keep on the move, watchin' to see if they try the front
  door or any o' the other windies. If they do, he takes his station there.
  D'ye follow?"</p>

  <p>Sir Archie nodded gloomily.</p>

  <p>"What is my post?" Saskia asked.</p>

  <p>"I've appointed ye my Chief of Staff," was the answer. "Ye see we've no
  reserves. If this door's the dangerous bit, it maun be reinforced from
  elsewhere; and that'll want savage thinkin'. Ye'll have to be aye on the
  move, Mem, and keep me informed. If they break in at two bits, we're beat,
  and there'll be nothing for it but to retire to our last position. Ye ken the
  room ayont the hall where they keep the coats. That's our last trench, and at
  the worst we fall back there and stick it out. It has a strong door and a wee
  windy, so they'll no' be able to get in on our rear. We should be able to put
  up a good defence there, unless they fire the place over our heads...  Now,
  we'd better give out the guns."</p>

  <p>"We don't want any shootin' if we can avoid it," said Sir Archie, who
  found his distaste for Dougal growing, though he was under the spell of the
  one being there who knew precisely his own mind.</p>

  <p>"Just what I was goin' to say. My instructions is, reserve your fire, and
  don't loose off till you have a man up against the end o' your barrel."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, we'll get into a horrible row. The whole thing may be a
  mistake, and we'll be had up for wholesale homicide. No man shall fire unless
  I give the word."</p>

  <p>The Commander-in-Chief looked at him darkly. Some bitter retort was on his
  tongue, but he restrained himself.</p>

  <p>"It appears," he said, "that ye think I'm doin' all this for fun. I'll no'
  argy wi' ye. There can be just the one general in a battle, but I'll give ye
  permission to say the word when to fire...  Macgreegor!" he muttered, a
  strange expletive only used in moments of deep emotion. "I'll wager ye'll be
  for sayin' the word afore I'd say it mysel'."</p>

  <p>He turned to the Princess. "I hand over to you, till I am back, for I maun
  be off and see to the Die-Hards. I wish I could bring them in here, but I
  daren't lose my communications. I'll likely get in by the boiler-house
  skylight when I come back, but it might be as well to keep a road open here
  unless ye're actually attacked."</p>

  <p>Dougal clambered over the mattresses and the grand piano; a flicker of
  waning daylight appeared for a second as he squeezed through the door, and
  Sir Archie was left staring at the wrathful countenance of McGuffog. He
  laughed ruefully.</p>

  <p>"I've been in about forty battles, and here's that little devil rather
  worried about my pluck and talkin' to me like a corps commander to a newly
  joined second-lieutenant. All the same he's a remarkable child, and we'd
  better behave as if we were in for a real shindy. What do you think,
  Princess?"</p>

  <p>"I think we are in for what you call a shindy. I am in command, remember.
  I order you to serve out the guns."</p>

  <p>This was done, a shot-gun and a hundred cartridges to each, while
  McGuffog, who was a marksman, was also given a sporting Mannlicher, and two
  other rifles, a .303 and a small-bore Holland, were kept in reserve in the
  hall. Sir Archie, free from Dougal's compelling presence, gave the gamekeeper
  peremptory orders not to shoot till he was bidden, and Carfrae at the kitchen
  door was warned to the same effect. The shuttered house, where the only light
  apart from the garden-room was the feeble spark of the electric torches, had
  the most disastrous effect upon his spirits. The gale which roared in the
  chimney and eddied among the rafters of the hall seemed an infernal commotion
  in a tomb.</p>

  <p>"Let's go upstairs," he told Saskia; "there must be a view from the upper
  windows."</p>

  <p>"You can see the top of the old Tower, and part of the sea," she said. "I
  know it well, for it was my only amusement to look at it. On clear days, too,
  one could see high mountains far in the west." His depression seemed to have
  affected her, for she spoke listlessly, unlike the vivid creature who had led
  the way in.</p>

  <p>In a gaunt west-looking bedroom, the one in which Heritage and Dickson had
  camped the night before, they opened a fold of the shutters and looked out
  into a world of grey wrack and driving rain. The Tower roof showed mistily
  beyond the ridge of down, but its environs were not in their prospect. The
  lower regions of the House had been gloomy enough, but this bleak place with
  its drab outlook struck a chill to Sir Archie's soul. He dolefully lit a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"This is a pretty rotten show for you," he told her. "It strikes me as a
  rather unpleasant brand of nightmare."</p>

  <p>"I have been living with nightmares for three years," she said
  wearily.</p>

  <p>He cast his eyes round the room. "I think the Kennedys were mad to build
  this confounded barrack. I've always disliked it, and old Quentin hadn't any
  use for it either. Cold, cheerless, raw monstrosity! It hasn't been a very
  giddy place for you, Princess."</p>

  <p>"It has been my prison, when I hoped it would be a sanctuary. But it may
  yet be my salvation."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I hope so. I say, you must be jolly hungry. I don't suppose
  there's any chance of tea for you."</p>

  <p>She shook her head. She was looking fixedly at the Tower, as if she
  expected something to appear there, and he followed her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Rum old shell, that. Quentin used to keep all kinds of live stock there,
  and when we were boys it was our castle where we played at bein' robber
  chiefs. It'll be dashed queer if the real thing should turn up this time. I
  suppose McCunn's Poet is roostin' there all by his lone. Can't say I envy him
  his job."</p>

  <p>Suddenly she caught his arm. "I see a man," she whispered. "There! He is
  behind those far bushes. There is his head again!"</p>

  <p>It was clearly a man, but he presently disappeared, for he had come round
  by the south end of the House, past the stables, and had now gone over the
  ridge.</p>

  <p>"The cut of his jib us uncommonly like Loudon, the factor. I thought
  McCunn had stretched him on a bed of pain. Lord, if this thing should turn
  out a farce, I simply can't face Loudon...  I say, Princess, you don't
  suppose by any chance that McCunn's a little bit wrong in the head?"</p>

  <p>She turned her candid eyes on him. "You are in a very doubting mood."</p>

  <p>"My feet are cold and I don't mind admittin' it. Hanged if I know what it
  is, but I don't feel this show a bit real. If it isn't, we're in a fair way
  to make howlin' idiots of ourselves, and get pretty well embroiled with the
  law. It's all right for the red-haired boy, for he can take everything
  seriously, even play. I could do the same thing myself when I was a kid. I
  don't mind runnin' some kind of risk&mdash;I've had a few in my
  time&mdash;but this is so infernally outlandish, and I&mdash;I don't quite
  believe in it. That is to say, I believe in it right enough when I look at
  you or listen to McCunn, but as soon as my eyes are off you I begin to doubt
  again. I'm gettin' old and I've a stake in the country, and I daresay I'm
  gettin' a bit of a prig&mdash;anyway I don't want to make a jackass of
  myself. Besides, there's this foul weather and this beastly house to ice my
  feet."</p>

  <p>He broke off with an exclamation, for on the grey cloud-bounded stage in
  which the roof of the Tower was the central feature, actors had appeared. Dim
  hurrying shapes showed through the mist, dipping over the ridge, as if coming
  from the Garplefoot.</p>

  <p>She seized his arm and he saw that her listlessness was gone. Her eyes
  were shining.</p>

  <p>"It is they," she cried. "The nightmare is real at last. Do you doubt
  now?"</p>

  <p>He could only stare, for these shapes arriving and vanishing like wisps of
  fog still seemed to him phantasmal. The girl held his arm tightly clutched,
  and craned towards the window space. He tried to open the frame, and
  succeeded in smashing the glass. A swirl of wind drove inwards and blew a
  loose lock of Saskia's hair across his brow.</p>

  <p>"I wish Dougal were back," he muttered, and then came the crack of a
  shot.</p>

  <p>The pressure on his arm slackened, and a pale face was turned to him. "He
  is alone&mdash;Mr. Heritage. He has no chance. They will kill him like a
  dog."</p>

  <p>"They'll never get in," he assured her. "Dougal said the place could hold
  out for hours."</p>

  <p>Another shot followed and presently a third. She twined her hands and her
  eyes were wild.</p>

  <p>"We can't leave him to be killed," she gasped.</p>

  <p>"It's the only game. We're playin' for time, remember. Besides, he won't
  be killed. Great Scott!"</p>

  <p>As he spoke, a sudden explosion cleft the drone of the wind and a patch of
  gloom flashed into yellow light.</p>

  <p>"Bomb!" he cried. "Lord, I might have thought of that."</p>

  <p>The girl had sprung back from the window. "I cannot bear it. I will not
  see him murdered in sight of his friends. I am going to show myself, and when
  they see me they will leave him...  No, you must stay here. Presently they
  will be round this house. Don't be afraid for me&mdash;I am very quick of
  foot."</p>

  <p>"For God's sake, don't! Here, Princess, stop," and he clutched at her
  skirt. "Look here, I'll go."</p>

  <p>"You can't. You have been wounded. I am in command, you know. Keep the
  door open till I come back."</p>

  <p>He hobbled after her, but she easily eluded him. She was smiling now, and
  blew a kiss to him. "La, la, la," she trilled, as she ran down the stairs. He
  heard her voice below, admonishing McGuffog. Then he pulled himself together
  and went back to the window. He had brought the little Holland with him, and
  he poked its barrel through the hole in the glass.</p>

  <p>"Curse my game leg," he said, almost cheerfully, for the situation was now
  becoming one with which he could cope. "I ought to be able to hold up the
  pursuit a bit. My aunt! What a girl!"</p>

  <p>With the rifle cuddled to his shoulder he watched a slim figure come into
  sight on the lawn, running towards the ridge. He reflected that she must have
  dropped from the high verandah wall. That reminded him that something must be
  done to make the wall climbable for her return, so he went down to McGuffog,
  and the two squeezed through the barricaded door to the verandah. The
  boilerhouse ladder was still in position, but it did not reach half the
  height, so McGuffog was adjured to stand by to help, and in the meantime to
  wait on duty by the wall. Then he hurried upstairs to his watch-tower.</p>

  <p>The girl was in sight, almost on the crest of the high ground. There she
  stood for a moment, one hand clutching at her errant hair, the other
  shielding her eyes from the sting of the rain. He heard her cry, as Heritage
  had heard her, but since the wind was blowing towards him the sound came
  louder and fuller. Again she cried, and then stood motionless with her hands
  above her head. It was only for an instant, for the next he saw she had
  turned and was racing down the slope, jumping the little scrogs of hazel like
  a deer. On the ridge appeared faces, and then over it swept a mob of men.</p>

  <p>She had a start of some fifty yards, and laboured to increase it, having
  doubtless the verandah wall in mind. Sir Archie, sick with anxiety,
  nevertheless spared time to admire her prowess. "Gad! she's a miler," he
  ejaculated. "She'll do it. I'm hanged if she don't do it."</p>

  <p>Against men in seamen's boots and heavy clothing she had a clear
  advantage. But two shook themselves loose from the pack and began to gain on
  her. At the main shrubbery they were not thirty yards behind, and in her
  passage through it her skirts must have delayed her, for when she emerged the
  pursuit had halved the distance. He got the sights of the rifle on the first
  man, but the lawns sloped up towards the house, and to his consternation he
  found that the girl was in the line of fire. Madly he ran to the other window
  of the room, tore back the shutters, shivered the glass, and flung his rifle
  to his shoulder. The fellow was within three yards of her, but, thank God! he
  had now a clear field. He fired low and just ahead of him, and had the
  satisfaction to see him drop like a rabbit, shot in the leg. His companion
  stumbled over him, and for a moment the girl was safe.</p>

  <p>But her speed was failing. She passed out of sight on the verandah side of
  the house, and the rest of the pack had gained ominously over the easier
  ground of the lawn. He thought for a moment of trying to stop them by his
  fire, but realized that if every shot told there would still be enough of
  them left to make sure of her capture. The only chance was at the verandah,
  and he went downstairs at a pace undreamed of since the days when he had two
  whole legs.</p>

  <p>McGuffog, Mannlicher in hand, was poking his neck over the wall. The
  pursuit had turned the corner and were about twenty yards off; the girl was
  at the foot of the ladder, breathless, drooping with fatigue. She tried to
  climb, limply and feebly, and very slowly, as if she were too giddy to see
  clear. Above were two cripples, and at her back the van of the now triumphant
  pack.</p>

  <p>Sir Archie, game leg or no, was on the parapet preparing to drop down and
  hold off the pursuit were it only for seconds. But at that moment he was
  aware that the situation had changed.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the ladder a tall man seemed to have sprung out of the
  ground. He caught the girl in his arms, climbed the ladder, and McGuffog's
  great hands reached down and seized her and swung her into safety. Up the
  wall, by means of cracks and tufts, was shinning a small boy.</p>

  <p>The stranger coolly faced the pursuers, and at the sight of him they
  checked, those behind stumbling against those in front. He was speaking to
  them in a foreign tongue, and to Sir Archie's ear the words were like the
  crack of a lash. The hesitation was only for a moment, for a voice among them
  cried out, and the whole pack gave tongue shrilly and surged on again. But
  that instant of check had given the stranger his chance. He was up the
  ladder, and, gripping the parapet, found rest for his feet in a fissure. Then
  he bent down, drew up the ladder, handed it to McGuffog, and with a mighty
  heave pulled himself over the top.</p>

  <p>He seemed to hope to defend the verandah, but the door at the west end was
  being assailed by a contingent of the enemy, and he saw that its thin
  woodwork was yielding.</p>

  <p>"Into the House," he cried, as he picked up the ladder and tossed it over
  the wall on the pack surging below. He was only just in time, for the west
  door yielded. In two steps he had followed McGuffog through the chink into
  the passage, and the concussion of the grand piano pushed hard against the
  verandah door from within coincided with the first battering on the said door
  from without.</p>

  <p>In the garden-room the feeble lamp showed a strange grouping. Saskia had
  sunk into a chair to get her breath, and seemed too dazed to be aware of her
  surroundings. Dougal was manfully striving to appear at his ease, but his lip
  was quivering.</p>

  <p>"A near thing that time," he observed. "It was the blame of that man's
  auld motor-bicycle."</p>

  <p>The stranger cast sharp eyes around the place and company.</p>

  <p>"An awkward corner, gentlemen," he said. "How many are there of you? Four
  men and a boy? And you have placed guards at all the entrances?"</p>

  <p>"They have bombs," Sir Archie reminded him.</p>

  <p>"No doubt. But I do not think they will use them here&mdash;or their guns,
  unless there is no other way. Their purpose is kidnapping, and they hope to
  do it secretly and slip off without leaving a trace. If they slaughter us, as
  they easily can, the cry will be out against them, and their vessel will be
  unpleasantly hunted. Half their purpose is already spoiled, for it's no
  longer secret...  They may break us by sheer weight, and I fancy the first
  shooting will be done by us. It's the windows I'm afraid of."</p>

  <p>Some tone in his quiet voice reached the girl in the wicker chair. She
  looked up wildly, saw him, and with a cry of "Alesha" ran to his arms. There
  she hung, while his hand fondled her hair, like a mother with a scared child.
  Sir Archie, watching the whole thing in some stupefaction, thought he had
  never in his days seen more nobly matched human creatures.</p>

  <p>"It is my friend," she cried triumphantly, "the friend whom I appointed to
  meet me here. Oh, I did well to trust him. Now we need not fear
  anything."</p>

  <p>As if in ironical answer came a great crashing at the verandah door, and
  the twanging of chords cruelly mishandled. The grand piano was suffering
  internally from the assaults of the boiler-house ladder.</p>

  <p>"Wull I gie them a shot?" was McGuffog's hoarse inquiry.</p>

  <p>"Action stations," Alexis ordered, for the command seemed to have shifted
  to him from Dougal. "The windows are the danger. The boy will patrol the
  ground floor, and give us warning, and I and this man," pointing to Sime,
  "will be ready at the threatened point. And, for God's sake, no shooting,
  unless I give the word. If we take them on at that game we haven't a
  chance."</p>

  <p>He said something to Saskia in Russian and she smiled assent and went to
  Sir Archie's side. "You and I must keep this door," she said.</p>

  <p>Sir Archie was never very clear afterwards about the events of the next
  hour. The Princess was in the maddest spirits, as if the burden of three
  years had slipped from her and she was back in her first girlhood. She sang
  as she carried more lumber to the pile&mdash;perhaps the song which had once
  entranced Heritage, but Sir Archie had no ear for music. She mocked at the
  furious blows which rained at the other end, for the door had gone now, and
  in the windy gap could be seen a blur of dark faces. Oddly enough, he found
  his own spirits mounting to meet hers. It was real business at last, the
  qualms of the civilian had been forgotten, and there was rising in him that
  joy in a scrap which had once made him one of the most daring airmen on the
  Western Front. The only thing that worried him now was the coyness about
  shooting. What on earth were his rifles and shot-guns for unless to be used?
  He had seen the enemy from the verandah wall, and a more ruffianly crew he
  had never dreamed of. They meant the uttermost business, and against such it
  was surely the duty of good citizens to wage whole-hearted war.</p>

  <p>The Princess was humming to herself a nursery rhyme:</p>

  <p class="poem">"The King of Spain's daughter," she crooned,<br>
  "Came to visit me, and all for the sake&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that poor piano!" In her clear voice she cried something in Russian,
  and the wind carried a laugh from the verandah. At the sound of it she
  stopped. "I had forgotten," she said. "Paul is there. I had forgotten." After
  that she was very quiet, but she redoubled her labours at the barricade.</p>

  <p>To the man it seemed that the pressure from without was slackening. He
  called to McGuffog to ask about the garden-room window, and the reply was
  reassuring. The gamekeeper was gloomily contemplating Dougal's tubs of water
  and wire-netting, as he might have contemplated a vermin trap.</p>

  <p>Sir Archie was growing acutely anxious&mdash;the anxiety of the defender
  of a straggling fortress which is vulnerable at a dozen points. It seemed to
  him that strange noises were coming from the rooms beyond the hall. Did the
  back door lie that way? And was not there a smell of smoke in the air? If
  they tried fire in such a gale the place would burn like matchwood.</p>

  <p>He left his post and in the hall found Dougal.</p>

  <p>"All quiet," the Chieftain reported. "Far ower quiet. I don't like it. The
  enemy's no' puttin' out his strength yet. The Russian says a' the west
  windies are terrible dangerous. Him and the chauffeur's doin' their best, but
  ye can't block thae muckle glass panes."</p>

  <p>He returned to the Princess, and found that the attack had indeed
  languished on that particular barricade. The withers of the grand piano were
  left unwrung, and only a faint scuffling informed him that the verandah was
  not empty. "They're gathering for an attack elsewhere," he told himself. But
  what if that attack were a feint? He and McGuffog must stick to their post,
  for in his belief the verandah door and the garden-room window were the
  easiest places where an entry in mass could be forced. Suddenly Dougal's
  whistle blew, and with it came a most almighty crash somewhere towards the
  west side. With a shout of "Hold Tight, McGuffog," Sir Archie bolted into the
  hall, and, led by the sound, reached what had once been the ladies' bedroom.
  A strange sight met his eyes, for the whole framework of one window seemed to
  have been thrust inward, and in the gap Alexis was swinging a fender. Three
  of the enemy were in the room&mdash;one senseless on the floor, one in the
  grip of Sime, whose single hand was tightly clenched on his throat, and one
  engaged with Dougal in a corner. The Die-Hard leader was sore pressed, and to
  his help Sir Archie went. The fresh assault made the seaman duck his head,
  and Dougal seized the occasion to smite him hard with something which caused
  him to roll over. It was Leon's life-preserver which he had annexed that
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>Alexis at the window seemed to have for a moment daunted the attack.
  "Bring that table," he cried, and the thing was jammed into the gap. "Now
  you"&mdash;this to Sime&mdash;"get the man from the back door to hold this
  place with his gun. There's no attack there. It's about time for shooting
  now, or we'll have them in our rear. What in heaven is that?"</p>

  <p>It was McGuffog whose great bellow resounded down the corridor. Sir Archie
  turned and shuffled back, to be met by a distressing spectacle. The lamp,
  burning as peacefully as it might have burned on an old lady's tea-table,
  revealed the window of the garden-room driven bodily inward, shutters and
  all, and now forming an inclined bridge over Dougal's ineffectual tubs. In
  front of it stood McGuffog, swinging his gun by the barrel and yelling
  curses, which, being mainly couched in the vernacular, were happily
  meaningless to Saskia. She herself stood at the hall door, plucking at
  something hidden in her breast. He saw that it was a little ivory-handled
  pistol.</p>

  <p>The enemy's feint had succeeded, for even as Sir Archie looked three men
  leaped into the room. On the neck of one the butt of McGuffog's gun crashed,
  but two scrambled to their feet and made for the girl. Sir Archie met the
  first with his fist, a clean drive on the jaw, followed by a damaging hook
  with his left that put him out of action. The other hesitated for an instant
  and was lost, for McGuffog caught him by the waist from behind and sent him
  through the broken frame to join his comrades without.</p>

  <p>"Up the stairs," Dougal was shouting, for the little room beyond the hall
  was clearly impossible. "Our flank's turned. They're pourin' through the
  other windy." Out of a corner of his eye Sir Archie caught sight of Alexis,
  with Sime and Carfrae in support, being slowly forced towards them along the
  corridor. "Upstairs," he shouted. "Come on, McGuffog. Lead on, Princess." He
  dashed out the lamp, and the place was in darkness.</p>

  <p>With this retreat from the forward trench line ended the opening phase of
  the battle. It was achieved in good order, and position was taken up on the
  first floor landing, dominating the main staircase and the passage that led
  to the back stairs. At their back was a short corridor ending in a window
  which gave on the north side of the House above the verandah, and from which
  an active man might descend to the verandah roof. It had been carefully
  reconnoitred beforehand by Dougal, and his were the dispositions.</p>

  <p>The odd thing was that the retreating force were in good heart. The three
  men from the Mains were warming to their work, and McGuffog wore an air of
  genial ferocity. "Dashed fine position I call this," said Sir Archie. Only
  Alexis was silent and preoccupied. "We are still at their mercy," he said.
  "Pray God your police come soon." He forbade shooting yet awhile. "The lady
  is our strong card," he said. "They won't use their guns while she is with
  us, but if it ever comes to shooting they can wipe us out in a couple of
  minutes. One of you watch that window, for Paul Abreskov is no fool."</p>

  <p>Their exhilaration was short-lived. Below in the hall it was black
  darkness save for a greyness at the entrance of the verandah passage; but the
  defence was soon aware that the place was thick with men. Presently there
  came a scuffling from Carfrae's post towards the back stairs, and a cry as of
  some one choking. And at the same moment a flare was lit below which brought
  the whole hall from floor to rafters into blinding light.</p>

  <p>It revealed a crowd of figures, some still in the hall and some half-way
  up the stairs, and it revealed, too, more figures at the end of the upper
  landing where Carfrae had been stationed. The shapes were motionless like
  mannequins in a shop window.</p>

  <p>"They've got us treed all right," Sir Archie groaned. "What the devil are
  they waiting for?"</p>

  <p>"They wait for their leader," said Alexis.</p>

  <p>No one of the party will ever forget the ensuing minutes. After the hubbub
  of the barricades the ominous silence was like icy water, chilling and
  petrifying with an indefinable fear. There was no sound but the wind, but
  presently mingled with it came odd wild voices.</p>

  <p>"Hear to the whaups," McGuffog whispered.</p>

  <p>Sir Archie, who found the tension unbearable, sought relief in
  contradiction. "You're an unscientific brute, McGuffog," he told his
  henchman. "It's a disgrace that a gamekeeper should be such a rotten
  naturalist. What would whaups be doin' on the shore at this time of
  year?"</p>

  <p>"A' the same, I could swear it's whaups, Sir Erchibald."</p>

  <p>Then Dougal broke in and his voice was excited. It's no' whaups. That's
  our patrol signal. Man, there's hope for us yet. I believe it's the polis.'
  His words were unheeded, for the figures below drew apart and a young man
  came through them. His beautifully-shaped dark head was bare, and as he moved
  he unbuttoned his oilskins and showed the trim dark-blue garb of the
  yachtsman. He walked confidently up the stairs, an odd elegant figure among
  his heavy companions.</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon, Alexis," he said in English. "I think we may now regard
  this interesting episode as closed. I take it that you surrender. Saskia,
  dear, you are coming with me on a little journey. Will you tell my men where
  to find your baggage?"</p>

  <p>The reply was in Russian. Alexis' voice was as cool as the other's, and it
  seemed to wake him to anger. He replied in a rapid torrent of words, and
  appealed to the men below, who shouted back. The flare was dying down, and
  shadows again hid most of the hall.</p>

  <p>Dougal crept up behind Sir Archie. "Here, I think it's the polis. They're
  whistlin' outbye, and I hear folk cryin' to each other&mdash;no' the
  foreigners."</p>

  <p>Again Alexis spoke, and then Saskia joined in. What she said rang sharp
  with contempt, and her fingers played with her little pistol.</p>

  <p>Suddenly before the young man could answer Dobson bustled toward him. The
  innkeeper was labouring under some strong emotion, for he seemed to be
  pleading and pointing urgently towards the door.</p>

  <p>"I tell ye it's the polis," whispered Dougal. "They're nickit."</p>

  <p>There was a swaying in the crowd and anxious faces. Men surged in,
  whispered, and went out, and a clamour arose which the leader stilled with a
  fierce gesture.</p>

  <p>"You there," he cried, looking up, "you English. We mean you no ill, but I
  require you to hand over to me the lady and the Russian who is with her. I
  give you a minute by my watch to decide. If you refuse, my men are behind you
  and around you, and you go with me to be punished at my leisure."</p>

  <p>"I warn you," cried Sir Archie. "We are armed, and will shoot down any one
  who dares to lay a hand on us."</p>

  <p>"You fool," came the answer. "I can send you all to eternity before you
  touch a trigger."</p>

  <p>Leon was by his side now&mdash;Leon and Spidel, imploring him to do
  something which he angrily refused. Outside there was a new clamour, faces
  showing at the door and then vanishing, and an anxious hum filled the hall
 ...  Dobson appeared again and this time he was a figure of fury.</p>

  <p>"Are ye daft, man?" he cried. "I tell ye the polis are closin' round us,
  and there's no' a moment to lose if we would get back to the boats. If ye'll
  no' think o' your own neck, I'm thinkin' o' mine. The whole things a bloody
  misfire. Come on, lads, if ye're no besotted on destruction."</p>

  <p>Leon laid a hand on the leader's arm and was roughly shaken off. Spidel
  fared no better, and the little group on the upper landing saw the two shrug
  their shoulders and make for the door. The hall was emptying fast and the
  watchers had gone from the back stairs. The young man's voice rose to a
  scream; he commanded, threatened, cursed; but panic was in the air and he had
  lost his mastery.</p>

  <p>"Quick," croaked Dougal, "now's the time for the counter-attack."</p>

  <p>But the figure on the stairs held them motionless. They could not see his
  face, but by instinct they knew that it was distraught with fury and defeat.
  The flare blazed up again as the flame caught a knot of fresh powder, and
  once more the place was bright with the uncanny light...  The hall was empty
  save for the pale man who was in the act of turning.</p>

  <p>He looked back. "If I go now, I will return. The world is not wide enough
  to hide you from me, Saskia."</p>

  <p>"You will never get her," said Alexis.</p>

  <p>A sudden devil flamed into his eyes, the devil of some ancestral savagery,
  which would destroy what is desired but unattainable. He swung round, his
  hand went to his pocket, something clacked, and his arm shot out like a
  baseball pitcher's.</p>

  <p>So intent was the gaze of the others on him, that they did not see a
  second figure ascending the stairs. Just as Alexis flung himself before the
  Princess, the new-comer caught the young man's outstretched arm and wrenched
  something from his hand. The next second he had hurled it into a far corner
  where stood the great fireplace. There was a blinding sheet of flame, a dull
  roar, and then billow upon billow of acrid smoke. As it cleared they saw that
  the fine Italian chimney-piece, the pride of the builder of the House, was a
  mass of splinters, and that a great hole had been blown through the wall into
  what had been the dining-room...  A figure was sitting on the bottom step
  feeling its bruises. The last enemy had gone.</p>

  <p>When Mr. John Heritage raised his eyes he saw the Princess with a very
  pale face in the arms of a tall man whom he had never seen before. If he was
  surprised at the sight, he did not show it. "Nasty little bomb that. I
  remember we struck the brand first in July '18."</p>

  <p>"Are they rounded up?" Sir Archie asked.</p>

  <p>"They've bolted. Whether they'll get away is another matter. I left half
  the mounted police a minute ago at the top of the West Lodge avenue. The
  other lot went to the Garplefoot to cut off the boats."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, man," Sir Archie cried, "the police have been here for the
  last ten minutes."</p>

  <p>"You're wrong. They came with me."</p>

  <p>"Then what on earth&mdash;" began the astonished baronet. He stopped
  short, for he suddenly got his answer. Into the hall limped a boy. Never was
  there seen so ruinous a child. He was dripping wet, his shirt was all but
  torn off his back, his bleeding nose was poorly staunched by a wisp of
  handkerchief, his breeches were in ribbons, and his poor bare legs looked as
  if they had been comprehensively kicked and scratched. Limpingly he entered,
  yet with a kind of pride, like some small cock-sparrow who has lost most of
  his plumage but has vanquished his adversary.</p>

  <p>With a yell Dougal went down the stairs. The boy saluted him, and they
  gravely shook hands. It was the meeting of Wellington and Blucher.</p>

  <p>The Chieftain's voice shrilled in triumph, but there was a break in it.
  The glory was almost too great to be borne.</p>

  <p>"I kenned it," he cried. "It was the Gorbals Die-Hards. There stands the
  man that done it...  Ye'll no' fickle Thomas Yownie."</p><br>
 <br>

  <h3 style="page-break-before: always"><a name="ref17"
     id="ref17">CHAPTER 15</a></h3>

  <h2>THE GORBALS DIE-HARDS GO INTO ACTION</h2>

  <p>We left Mr. McCunn, full of aches but desperately resolute in spirit,
  hobbling by the Auchenlochan road into the village of Dalquharter. His goal
  was Mrs. Morran's hen-house, which was Thomas Yownie's <i>poste de
  commandement</i>. The rain had come on again, and, though in other weather
  there would have been a slow twilight, already the shadow of night had the
  world in its grip. The sea even from the high ground was invisible, and all
  to westward and windward was a ragged screen of dark cloud. It was foul
  weather for foul deeds. Thomas Yownie was not in the hen-house, but in Mrs.
  Morran's kitchen, and with him were the pug-faced boy know as Old Bill, and
  the sturdy figure of Peter Paterson. But the floor was held by the hostess.
  She still wore her big boots, her petticoats were still kilted, and round her
  venerable head in lieu of a bonnet was drawn a tartan shawl.</p>

  <p>"Eh, Dickson, but I'm blithe to see ye. And puir man, ye've been sair
  mishandled. This is the awfu'est Sabbath day that ever you and me pit in. I
  hope it'll be forgiven us...  Whaur's the young leddy?"</p>

  <p>"Dougal was saying she was in the House with Sir Archibald and the men
  from the Mains."</p>

  <p>"Wae's me!" Mrs. Morran keened. "And what kind o' place is yon for her?
  Thae laddies tell me there's boatfu's o' scoondrels landit at the Garplefit.
  They'll try the auld Tower, but they'll no' wait there when they find it
  toom, and they'll be inside the Hoose in a jiffy and awa' wi' the puir
  lassie. Sirs, it maunna be. Ye're lippenin' to the polis, but in a' my days I
  never kenned the polis in time. We maun be up and daein' oorsels. Oh, if I
  could get a haud o' that red-heided Dougal... "</p>

  <p>As she spoke there came on the wind the dull reverberation of an
  explosion.</p>

  <p>"Keep us, what's that?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"It's dinnymite," said Peter Paterson.</p>

  <p>"That's the end o' the auld Tower," observed Thomas Yownie in his quiet,
  even voice. "And it's likely the end o' the man Heritage."</p>

  <p>"Lord peety us!" the old woman wailed. "And us standin' here like stookies
  and no' liftin' a hand. Awa' wi ye, laddies, and dae something. Awa' you too,
  Dickson, or I'll tak' the road mysel'."</p>

  <p>"I've got orders," said the Chief of Staff, "no' to move till the
  sityation's clear. Napoleon's up at the Tower and Jaikie's in the policies. I
  maun wait on their reports."</p>

  <p>For a moment Mrs. Morran's attention was distracted by Dickson, who
  suddenly felt very faint and sat down heavily on a kitchen chair. "Man, ye're
  as white as a dish-clout," she exclaimed with compunction. "Ye're fair wore
  out, and ye'll have had nae meat sin' your breakfast. See, and I'll get ye a
  cup o' tea."</p>

  <p>She proved to be in the right, for as soon as Dickson had swallowed some
  mouthfuls of her strong scalding brew the colour came back to his cheeks, and
  he announced that he felt better. "Ye'll fortify it wi' a dram," she told
  him, and produced a black bottle from her cupboard. "My father aye said that
  guid whisky and het tea keepit the doctor's gig oot o' the close."</p>

  <p>The back door opened and Napoleon entered, his thin shanks blue with cold.
  He saluted and made his report in a voice shrill with excitement.</p>

  <p>"The Tower has fallen. They've blown in the big door, and the feck o'
  them's inside."</p>

  <p>"And Mr. Heritage?" was Dickson's anxious inquiry.</p>

  <p>"When I last saw him he was up at a windy, shootin'. I think he's gotten
  on to the roof. I wouldna wonder but the place is on fire."</p>

  <p>"Here, this is awful," Dickson groaned. "We can't let Mr. Heritage be
  killed that way. What strength is the enemy?"</p>

  <p>"I counted twenty-seven, and there's stragglers comin' up from the
  boats."</p>

  <p>"And there's me and you five laddies here, and Dougal and the others shut
  up in the House."</p>

  <p>He stopped in sheer despair. It was a fix from which the most enlightened
  business mind showed no escape. Prudence, inventiveness, were no longer in
  question; only some desperate course of violence.</p>

  <p>"We must create a diversion," he said. "I'm for the Tower, and you laddies
  must come with me. We'll maybe see a chance. Oh, but I wish I had my wee
  pistol."</p>

  <p>"If ye're gaun there, Dickson, I'm comin' wi' ye," Mrs Morran
  announced.</p>

  <p>Her words revealed to Dickson the preposterousness of the whole situation,
  and for all his anxiety he laughed. "Five laddies, a middle-aged man, and an
  auld wife," he cried. "Dod, it's pretty hopeless. It's like the thing in the
  Bible about the weak things of the world trying to confound the strong."</p>

  <p>"The Bible's whiles richt," Mrs. Morran answered drily. "Come on, for
  there's no time to lose."</p>

  <p>The door opened again to admit the figure of Wee Jaikie. There were no
  tears in his eyes, and his face was very white.</p>

  <p>"They're a' round the Hoose," he croaked. "I was up a tree forenent the
  verandy and seen them. The lassie ran oot and cried on them from the top o'
  the brae, and they a' turned and hunted her back. Gosh, but it was a near
  thing. I seen the Captain sklimmin' the wall, and a muckle man took the
  lassie and flung her up the ladder. They got inside just in time and steekit
  the door, and now the whole pack is roarin' round the Hoose seekin' a road
  in. They'll no' be long over the job, neither."</p>

  <p>"What about Mr. Heritage?"</p>

  <p>"They're no' heedin' about him any more. The auld Tower's bleezin'."</p>

  <p>"Worse and worse," said Dickson. "If the police don't come in the next ten
  minutes, they'll be away with the Princess. They've beaten all Dougal's
  plans, and it's a straight fight with odds of six to one. It's not
  possible."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Morran for the first time seemed to lose hope. "Eh, the puir lassie!"
  she wailed, and sinking on a chair covered her face with her shawl.</p>

  <p>"Laddies, can you no' think of a plan?" asked Dickson, his voice flat with
  despair.</p>

  <p>Then Thomas Yownie spoke. So far he had been silent, but under his tangled
  thatch of hair his mind had been busy. Jaikie's report seemed to bring him to
  a decision.</p>

  <p>"It's gey dark," he said, "and it's gettin' darker."</p>

  <p>There was that in his voice which promised something, and Dickson
  listened.</p>

  <p>"The enemy's mostly foreigners, but Dobson's there and I think he's a kind
  of guide to them. Dobson's feared of the polis, and if we can terrify Dobson
  he'll terrify the rest."</p>

  <p>"Ay, but where are the police?"</p>

  <p>"They're no' here yet, but they're comin'. The fear o' them is aye in
  Dobson's mind. If he thinks the polis has arrived, he'll put the wind up the
  lot...  WE maun be the polis."</p>

  <p>Dickson could only stare while the Chief of Staff unfolded his scheme. I
  do not know to whom the Muse of History will give the credit of the tactics
  of "Infiltration," whether to Ludendorff or von Hutier or some other proud
  captain of Germany, or to Foch, who revised and perfected them. But I know
  that the same notion was at this moment of crisis conceived by Thomas Yownie,
  whom no parents acknowledged, who slept usually in a coal cellar, and who had
  picked up his education among Gorbals closes and along the wharves of
  Clyde.</p>

  <p>"It's gettin' dark," he said, "and the enemy are that busy tryin' to break
  into the Hoose that they'll no' be thinkin' o' their rear. The five o' us
  Die-Hards is grand at dodgin' and keepin' out of sight, and what hinders us
  to get in among them, so that they'll hear us but never see us. We're used to
  the ways o' the polis, and can imitate them fine. Forbye we've all got our
  whistles, which are the same as a bobbie's birl, and Old Bill and Peter are
  grand at copyin' a man's voice. Since the Captain is shut up in the Hoose,
  the command falls to me, and that's my plan."</p>

  <p>With a piece of chalk he drew on the kitchen floor a rough sketch of the
  environs of Huntingtower. Peter Paterson was to move from the shrubberies
  beyond the verandah, Napoleon from the stables, Old Bill from the Tower,
  while Wee Jaikie and Thomas himself were to advance as if from the
  Garplefoot, so that the enemy might fear for his communications. "As soon as
  one o' ye gets into position he's to gie the patrol cry, and when each o' ye
  has heard five cries, he's to advance. Begin birlin' and roarin' afore ye get
  among them, and keep it up till ye're at the Hoose wall. If they've gotten
  inside, in ye go after them. I trust each Die-Hard to use his judgment, and
  above all to keep out o' sight and no' let himsel' be grippit."</p>

  <p>The plan, like all great tactics, was simple, and no sooner was it
  expounded than it was put into action. The Die-Hards faded out of the kitchen
  like fog-wreaths, and Dickson and Mrs. Morran were left looking at each
  other. They did not look long. The bare feet of Wee Jaikie had not crossed
  the threshold fifty seconds, before they were followed by Mrs. Morran's
  out-of-doors boots and Dickson's tackets. Arm in arm the two hobbled down the
  back path behind the village which led to the South Lodge. The gate was
  unlocked, for the warder was busy elsewhere, and they hastened up the avenue.
  Far off Dickson thought he saw shapes fleeting across the park, which he took
  to be the shock-troops of his own side, and he seemed to hear snatches of
  song. Jaikie was giving tongue, and this was what he sang:</p>

  <p class="poem">"Proley Tarians, arise!<br>
  Wave the Red Flag to the skies,<br>
  Heed no more the Fat Man's lies,<br>
  Stap them doun his throat!<br>
  Nocht to lose except our chains... "</p>

  <p>But he tripped over a rabbit wire and thereafter conserved his breath.</p>

  <p>The wind was so loud that no sound reached them from the House, which,
  blank and immense, now loomed before them. Dickson's ears were alert for the
  noise of shots or the dull crash of bombs; hearing nothing, he feared the
  worst, and hurried Mrs. Morran at a pace which endangered her life. He had no
  fear for himself, arguing that his foes were seeking higher game, and
  judging, too, that the main battle must be round the verandah at the other
  end. The two passed the shrubbery where the road forked, one path running to
  the back door and one to the stables. They took the latter and presently came
  out on the downs, with the ravine of the Garple on their left, the stables in
  front, and on the right the hollow of a formal garden running along the west
  side of the House.</p>

  <p>The gale was so fierce, now that they had no wind-break between them and
  the ocean, that Mrs. Morran could wrestle with it no longer, and found
  shelter in the lee of a clump of rhododendrons. Darkness had all but fallen,
  and the House was a black shadow against the dusky sky, while a confused
  greyness marked the sea. The old Tower showed a tooth of masonry; there was
  no glow from it, so the fire, which Jaikie had reported, must have died down.
  A whaup cried loudly, and very eerily: then another.</p>

  <p>The birds stirred up Mrs. Morran. "That's the laddies' patrol." she
  gasped. "Count the cries, Dickson."</p>

  <p>Another bird wailed, this time very near. Then there was perhaps three
  minutes' silence till a fainter wheeple came from the direction of the Tower.
  "Four," said Dickson, but he waited in vain on the fifth. He had not the
  acute hearing of the boys, and could not catch the faint echo of Peter
  Paterson's signal beyond the verandah. The next he heard was a shrill whistle
  cutting into the wind, and then others in rapid succession from different
  quarters, and something which might have been the hoarse shouting of angry
  men.</p>

  <p>The Gorbals Die-Hards had gone into action.</p>

  <p>Dull prose is no medium to tell of that wild adventure. The sober sequence
  of the military historian is out of place in recording deeds that knew not
  sequence or sobriety. Were I a bard, I would cast this tale in excited verse,
  with a lilt which would catch the speed of the reality. I would sing of
  Napoleon, not unworthy of his great namesake, who penetrated to the very
  window of the ladies' bedroom, where the framework had been driven in and men
  were pouring through; of how there he made such pandemonium with his whistle
  that men tumbled back and ran about blindly seeking for guidance; of how in
  the long run his pugnacity mastered him, so that he engaged in combat with an
  unknown figure and the two rolled into what had once been a fountain. I would
  hymn Peter Paterson, who across tracts of darkness engaged Old Bill in a
  conversation which would have done no discredit to a Gallowgate policeman. He
  pretended to be making reports and seeking orders. "We've gotten three o' the
  deevils, sir. What'll we dae wi' them?" he shouted; and back would come the
  reply in a slightly more genteel voice: "Fall them to the rear. Tamson has
  charge of the prisoners." Or it would be: "They've gotten pistols, sir.
  What's the orders?" and the answer would be: "Stick to your batons. The guns
  are posted on the knowe, so we needn't hurry." And over all the din there
  would be a perpetual whistling and a yelling of "Hands up!"</p>

  <p>I would sing, too, of Wee Jaikie, who was having the red-letter hour of
  his life. His fragile form moved like a lizard in places where no mortal
  could be expected, and he varied his duties with impish assaults upon the
  persons of such as came in his way. His whistle blew in a man's ear one
  second and the next yards away. Sometimes he was moved to song, and unearthly
  fragments of "Class-conscious we are" or "Proley Tarians, arise!" mingled
  with the din, like the cry of seagulls in a storm. He saw a bright light
  flare up within the House which warned him not to enter, but he got as far as
  the garden-room, in whose dark corners he made havoc. Indeed he was almost
  too successful, for he created panic where he went, and one or two fired
  blindly at the quarter where he had last been heard. These shots were
  followed by frenzied prohibitions from Spidel and were not repeated.
  Presently he felt that aimless surge of men that is the prelude to flight,
  and heard Dobson's great voice roaring in the hall. Convinced that the crisis
  had come, he made his way outside, prepared to harrass the rear of any
  retirement. Tears now flowed down his face, and he could not have spoken for
  sobs, but he had never been so happy.</p>

  <p>But chiefly would I celebrate Thomas Yownie, for it was he who brought
  fear into the heart of Dobson. He had a voice of singular compass, and from
  the verandah he made it echo round the House. The efforts of Old Bill and
  Peter Paterson had been skilful indeed, but those of Thomas Yownie were
  deadly. To some leader beyond he shouted news: "Robison's just about finished
  wi' his lot, and then he'll get the boats." A furious charge upset him, and
  for a moment he thought he had been discovered. But it was only Dobson
  rushing to Leon, who was leading the men in the doorway. Thomas fled to the
  far end of the verandah, and again lifted up his voice. "All foreigners," he
  shouted, "except the man Dobson. Ay. Ay. Ye've got Loudon? Well done!"</p>

  <p>It must have been this last performance which broke Dobson's nerve and
  convinced him that the one hope lay in a rapid retreat to the Garplefoot.
  There was a tumbling of men in the doorway, a muttering of strange tongues,
  and the vision of the innkeeper shouting to Leon and Spidel. For a second he
  was seen in the faint reflection that the light in the hall cast as far as
  the verandah, a wild figure urging the retreat with a pistol clapped to the
  head of those who were too confused by the hurricane of events to grasp the
  situation. Some of them dropped over the wall, but most huddled like sheep
  through the door on the west side, a jumble of struggling, blasphemous
  mortality. Thomas Yownie, staggered at the success of his tactics, yet kept
  his head and did his utmost to confuse the retreat, and the triumphant shouts
  and whistles of the other Die-Hards showed that they were not unmindful of
  this final duty... </p>

  <p>The verandah was empty, and he was just about to enter the House, when
  through the west door came a figure, breathing hard and bent apparently on
  the same errand. Thomas prepared for battle, determined that no straggler of
  the enemy should now wrest from him victory, but, as the figure came into the
  faint glow at the doorway, he recognized it as Heritage. And at the same
  moment he heard something which made his tense nerves relax. Away on the
  right came sounds, a thud of galloping horses on grass and the jingle of
  bridle reins and the voices of men. It was the real thing at last. It is a
  sad commentary on his career, but now for the first time in his brief
  existence Thomas Yownie felt charitably disposed towards the police.</p>

  <p>The Poet, since we left him blaspheming on the roof of the Tower, had been
  having a crowded hour of most inglorious life. He had started to descend at a
  furious pace, and his first misadventure was that he stumbled and dropped
  Dickson's pistol over the parapet. He tried to mark where it might have
  fallen in the gloom below, and this lost him precious minutes. When he
  slithered through the trap into the attic room, where he had tried to hold up
  the attack, he discovered that it was full of smoke which sought in vain to
  escape by the narrow window. Volumes of it were pouring up the stairs, and
  when he attempted to descend he found himself choked and blinded. He rushed
  gasping to the window, filled his lungs with fresh air, and tried again, but
  he got no farther than the first turn, from which he could see through the
  cloud red tongues of flame in the ground room. This was solemn indeed, so he
  sought another way out. He got on the roof, for he remembered a
  chimney-stack, cloaked with ivy, which was built straight from the ground,
  and he thought he might climb down it.</p>

  <p>He found the chimney and began the descent confidently, for he had once
  borne a good reputation at the Montanvert and Cortina. At first all went
  well, for stones stuck out at decent intervals like the rungs of a ladder,
  and roots of ivy supplemented their deficiencies. But presently he came to a
  place where the masonry had crumbled into a cave, and left a gap some twenty
  feet high. Below it he could dimly see a thick mass of ivy which would enable
  him to cover the further forty feet to the ground, but at that cave he stuck
  most finally. All around the lime and stone had lapsed into debris, and he
  could find no safe foothold. Worse still, the block on which he relied proved
  loose, and only by a dangerous traverse did he avert disaster.</p>

  <p>There he hung for a minute or two, with a cold void in his stomach. He had
  always distrusted the handiwork of man as a place to scramble on, and now he
  was planted in the dark on a decomposing wall, with an excellent chance of
  breaking his neck, and with the most urgent need for haste. He could see the
  windows of the House, and, since he was sheltered from the gale, he could
  hear the faint sound of blows on woodwork. There was clearly the devil to pay
  there, and yet here he was helplessly stuck...  Setting his teeth, he started
  to ascend again. Better the fire than this cold breakneck emptiness.</p>

  <p>It took him the better part of half an hour to get back, and he passed
  through many moments of acute fear. Footholds which had seemed secure enough
  in the descent now proved impossible, and more than once he had his heart in
  his mouth when a rotten ivy stump or a wedge of stone gave in his hands, and
  dropped dully into the pit of night, leaving him crazily spread-eagled. When
  at last he reached the top he rolled on his back and felt very sick. Then, as
  he realized his safety, his impatience revived. At all costs he would force
  his way out though he should be grilled like a herring.</p>

  <p>The smoke was less thick in the attic, and with his handkerchief wet with
  the rain and bound across his mouth he made a dash for the ground room. It
  was as hot as a furnace, for everything inflammable in it seemed to have
  caught fire, and the lumber glowed in piles of hot ashes. But the floor and
  walls were stone, and only the blazing jambs of the door stood between him
  and the outer air. He had burned himself considerably as he stumbled
  downwards, and the pain drove him to a wild leap through the broken arch,
  where he miscalculated the distance, charred his shins, and brought down a
  red-hot fragment of the lintel on his head. But the thing was done, and a
  minute later he was rolling like a dog in the wet bracken to cool his burns
  and put out various smouldering patches on his raiment.</p>

  <p>Then he started running for the House, but, confused by the darkness, he
  bore too much to the north, and came out in the side avenue from which he and
  Dickson had reconnoitred on the first evening. He saw on the right a glow in
  the verandah, which, as we know, was the reflection of the flare in the hall,
  and he heard a babble of voices. But he heard something more, for away on his
  left was the sound which Thomas Yownie was soon to hear&mdash;the trampling
  of horses. It was the police at last, and his task was to guide them at once
  to the critical point of action...  Three minutes later a figure like a
  scarecrow was admonishing a bewildered sergeant, while his hands plucked
  feverishly at a horse's bridle.</p>

  <p>It is time to return to Dickson in his clump of rhododendrons. Tragically
  aware of his impotence he listened to the tumult of the Die-Hards, hopeful
  when it was loud, despairing when there came a moment's lull, while Mrs.
  Morran like a Greek chorus drew loudly upon her store of proverbial
  philosophy and her memory of Scripture texts. Twice he tried to reconnoitre
  towards the scene of battle, but only blundered into sunken plots and pits in
  the Dutch garden. Finally he squatted beside Hrs. Morran, lit his pipe, and
  took a firm hold on his patience.</p>

  <p>It was not tested for long. Presently he was aware that a change had come
  over the scene&mdash;that the Die-Hards' whistles and shouts were being
  drowned in another sound, the cries of panicky men. Dobson's bellow was
  wafted to him. "Auntie Phemie," he shouted, "the innkeeper's getting rattled.
  Dod, I believe they're running." For at that moment twenty paces on his left
  the van of the retreat crashed through the creepers on the garden's edge and
  leaped the wall that separated it from the cliffs of the Garplefoot.</p>

  <p>The old woman was on her feet.</p>

  <p>"God be thankit, is't the polis?"</p>

  <p>"Maybe. Maybe no'. But they're running."</p>

  <p>Another bunch of men raced past, and he heard Dobson's voice.</p>

  <p>"I tell you, they're broke. Listen, it's horses. Ay, it's the police, but
  it was the Die-Hards that did the job...  Here! They mustn't escape. Have the
  police had the sense to send men to the Garplefoot?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Morran, a figure like an ancient prophetess, with her tartan shawl
  lashing in the gale, clutched him by the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Doun to the waterside and stop them. Ye'll no' be beat by wee laddies! On
  wi' ye and I'll follow! There's gaun to be a juidgment on evil-doers this
  night."</p>

  <p>Dickson needed no urging. His heart was hot within him, and the weariness
  and stiffness had gone from his limbs. He, too, tumbled over the wall, and
  made for what he thought was the route by which he had originally ascended
  from the stream. As he ran he made ridiculous efforts to cry like a whaup in
  the hope of summoning the Die-Hards. One, indeed, he found&mdash;Napoleon,
  who had suffered a grievous pounding in the fountain, and had only escaped by
  an eel-like agility which had aforetime served him in good stead with the law
  of his native city. Lucky for Dickson was the meeting, for he had forgotten
  the road and would certainly have broken his neck. Led by the Die-Hard he
  slid forty feet over screes and boiler-plates, with the gale plucking at him,
  found a path, lost it, and then tumbled down a raw bank of earth to the flat
  ground beside the harbour. During all this performance, he has told me, he
  had no thought of fear, nor any clear notion what he meant to do. He just
  wanted to be in at the finish of the job.</p>

  <p>Through the narrow entrance the gale blew as through a funnel, and the
  usually placid waters of the harbour were a froth of angry waves. Two boats
  had been launched and were plunging furiously, and on one of them a lantern
  dipped and fell. By its light he could see men holding a further boat by the
  shore. There was no sign of the police; he reflected that probably they had
  become entangled in the Garple Dean. The third boat was waiting for some
  one.</p>

  <p>Dickson&mdash;a new Ajax by the ships&mdash;divined who this someone must
  be and realized his duty. It was the leader, the arch-enemy, the man whose
  escape must at all costs be stopped. Perhaps he had the Princess with him,
  thus snatching victory from apparent defeat. In any case he must be tackled,
  and a fierce anxiety gripped his heart. "Aye finish a job," he told himself,
  and peered up into the darkness of the cliffs, wondering just how he should
  set about it, for except in the last few days he had never engaged in combat
  with a fellow-creature.</p>

  <p>"When he comes, you grip his legs," he told Napoleon, "and get him down.
  He'll have a pistol, and we're done if he's on his feet."</p>

  <p>There was a cry from the boats, a shout of guidance, and the light on the
  water was waved madly. "They must have good eyesight," thought Dickson, for
  he could see nothing. And then suddenly he was aware of steps in front of
  him, and a shape like a man rising out of the void at his left hand.</p>

  <p>In the darkness Napoleon missed his tackle, and the full shock came on
  Dickson. He aimed at what he thought was the enemy's throat, found only an
  arm, and was shaken off as a mastiff might shake off a toy terrier. He made
  another clutch, fell, and in falling caught his opponent's leg so that he
  brought him down. The man was immensely agile, for he was up in a second and
  something hot and bright blew into Dickson's face. The pistol bullet had
  passed through the collar of his faithful waterproof, slightly singeing his
  neck. But it served its purpose, for Dickson paused, gasping, to consider
  where he had been hit, and before he could resume the chase the last boat had
  pushed off into deep water.</p>

  <p>To be shot at from close quarters is always irritating, and the novelty of
  the experience increased Dickson's natural wrath. He fumed on the shore like
  a deerhound when the stag has taken to the sea. So hot was his blood that he
  would have cheerfully assaulted the whole crew had they been within his
  reach. Napoleon, who had been incapacitated for speed by having his stomach
  and bare shanks savagely trampled upon, joined him, and together they watched
  the bobbing black specks as they crawled out of the estuary into the grey
  spindrift which marked the harbour mouth.</p>

  <p>But as he looked the wrath died out of Dickson's soul. For he saw that the
  boats had indeed sailed on a desperate venture, and that a pursuer was on
  their track more potent than his breathless middle-age. The tide was on the
  ebb, and the gale was driving the Atlantic breakers shoreward, and in the
  jaws of the entrance the two waters met in an unearthly turmoil. Above the
  noise of the wind came the roar of the flooded Garple and the fret of the
  harbour, and far beyond all the crashing thunder of the conflict at the
  harbour mouth. Even in the darkness, against the still faintly grey western
  sky, the spume could be seen rising like waterspouts. But it was the ear
  rather than the eye which made certain presage of disaster. No boat could
  face the challenge of that loud portal.</p>

  <p>As Dickson struggled against the wind and stared, his heart melted and a
  great awe fell upon him. He may have wept; it is certain that he prayed.
  "Poor souls, poor souls!" he repeated. "I doubt the last hour has been a poor
  preparation for eternity."</p>

  <p>The tide the next day brought the dead ashore. Among them was a young man,
  different in dress and appearance from the rest&mdash;a young man with a
  noble head and a finely-cut classic face, which was not marred like the
  others from pounding among the Garple rocks. His dark hair was washed back
  from his brow, and the mouth, which had been hard in life, was now relaxed in
  the strange innocence of death.</p>

  <p>Dickson gazed at the body and observed that there was a slight deformation
  between the shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Poor fellow," he said. "That explains a lot...  As my father used to say,
  cripples have a right to be cankered."</p><br>

     id="ref18">CHAPTER 16</a></h3>

  <h2>IN WHICH A PRINCESS LEAVES A DARK TOWER<br>
  AND A PROVISION MERCHANT RETURNS TO HIS FAMILY</h2>

  <p>The three days of storm ended in the night, and with the wild weather
  there departed from the Cruives something which had weighed on Dickson's
  spirits since he first saw the place. Monday&mdash;only a week from the
  morning when he had conceived his plan of holiday&mdash;saw the return of the
  sun and the bland airs of spring. Beyond the blue of the yet restless waters
  rose dim mountains tipped with snow, like some Mediterranean seascape.
  Nesting birds were busy on the Laver banks and in the Huntingtower thickets;
  the village smoked peacefully to the clear skies; even the House looked
  cheerful if dishevelled. The Garple Dean was a garden of swaying larches,
  linnets, and wild anemones. Assuredly, thought Dickson, there had come a
  mighty change in the countryside, and he meditated a future discourse to the
  Literary Society of the Guthrie Memorial Kirk on "Natural Beauty in Relation
  to the Mind of Man."</p>

  <p>It remains for the chronicler to gather up the loose ends of his tale.
  There was no newspaper story with bold headlines of this the most recent
  assault on the shores of Britain. Alexis Nicolaevitch, once a Prince of
  Muscovy and now Mr. Alexander Nicholson of the rising firm of Sprot and
  Nicholson of Melbourne, had interest enough to prevent it. For it was clear
  that if Saskia was to be saved from persecution, her enemies must disappear
  without trace from the world, and no story be told of the wild venture which
  was their undoing. The constabulary of Carrick and Scotland Yard were
  indisposed to ask questions, under a hint from their superiors, the more so
  as no serious damage had been done to the persons of His Majesty's lieges,
  and no lives had been lost except by the violence of Nature. The
  Procurator-Fiscal investigated the case of the drowned men, and reported that
  so many foreign sailors, names and origins unknown, had perished in
  attempting to return to their ship at the Garplefoot. The Danish brig had
  vanished into the mist of the northern seas. But one signal calamity the
  Procurator-Fiscal had to record. The body of Loudon the factor was found on
  the Monday morning below the cliffs, his neck broken by a fall. In the
  darkness and confusion he must have tried to escape in that direction, and he
  had chosen an impracticable road or had slipped on the edge. It was returned
  as "death by misadventure," and the <i>Carrick Herald</i> and the
  <i>Auchenlochan Advertiser</i> excelled themselves in eulogy. Mr. Loudon,
  they said, had been widely known in the south-west of Scotland as an able and
  trusted lawyer, an assiduous public servant, and not least as a good
  sportsman. It was the last trait which had led to his death, for, in his
  enthusiasm for wild nature, he had been studying bird life on the cliffs of
  the Cruives during the storm, and had made that fatal slip which had deprived
  the shire of a wise counsellor and the best of good fellows.</p>

  <p>The tinklers of the Garplefoot took themselves off, and where they may now
  be pursuing their devious courses is unknown to the chronicler. Dobson, too,
  disappeared, for he was not among the dead from the boats. He knew the
  neighbourhood, and probably made his way to some port from which he took
  passage to one or other of those foreign lands which had formerly been
  honoured by his patronage. Nor did all the Russians perish. Three were found
  skulking next morning in the woods, starving and ignorant of any tongue but
  their own, and five more came ashore much battered but alive. Alexis took
  charge of the eight survivors, and arranged to pay their passage to one of
  the British Dominions and to give them a start in a new life. They were
  broken creatures, with the dazed look of lost animals, and four of them had
  been peasants in Saskia's estates. Alexis spoke to them in their own
  language. "In my grandfather's time," he said, "you were serfs. Then there
  came a change, and for some time you were free men. Now you have slipped back
  into being slaves again&mdash;the worst of slaveries, for you have been the
  serfs of fools and scoundrels and the black passion of your own hearts. I
  give you a chance of becoming free men once more. You have the task before
  you of working out your own salvation. Go, and God be with you."</p>

  <p>Before we take leave of these companions of a single week I would present
  them to you again as they appeared on a certain sunny afternoon when the
  episode of Huntingtower was on the eve of closing. First we see Saskia and
  Alexis walking on the thymy sward of the cliff-top, looking out to the
  fretted blue of the sea. It is a fitting place for lovers&mdash;above all for
  lovers who have turned the page on a dark preface, and have before them still
  the long bright volume of life. The girl has her arm linked in the man's, but
  as they walk she breaks often away from him, to dart into copses, to gather
  flowers, or to peer over the brink where the gulls wheel and oyster-catchers
  pipe among the shingle. She is no more the tragic muse of the past week, but
  a laughing child again, full of snatches of song, her eyes bright with
  expectation. They talk of the new world which lies before them, and her voice
  is happy. Then her brows contract, and, as she flings herself down on a patch
  of young heather, her air is thoughtful.</p>

  <p>"I have been back among fairy tales," she says. "I do not quite
  understand, Alesha. Those gallant little boys! They are youth, and youth is
  always full of strangeness. Mr. Heritage! He is youth, too, and poetry,
  perhaps, and a soldier's tradition. I think I know him...  But what about
  Dickson? He is the <i>petit bourgeois</i>, the <i>&eacute;picier</i>, the
  class which the world ridicules. He is unbelievable. The others with good
  fortune I might find elsewhere&mdash;in Russia perhaps. But not Dickson."</p>

  <p>"No," is the answer. "You will not find him in Russia. He is what they
  call the middle-class, which we who were foolish used to laugh at. But he is
  the stuff which above all others makes a great people. He will endure when
  aristocracies crack and proletariats crumble. In our own land we have never
  known him, but till we create him our land will not be a nation."</p>

  <p>Half a mile away on the edge of the Laver glen Dickson and Heritage are
  together, Dickson placidly smoking on a tree-stump and Heritage walking
  excitedly about and cutting with his stick at the bracken. Sundry bandages
  and strips of sticking plaster still adorn the Poet, but his clothes have
  been tidied up by Mrs. Morran, and he has recovered something of his old
  precision of garb. The eyes of both are fixed on the two figures on the
  cliff-top. Dickson feels acutely uneasy. It is the first time that he has
  been alone with Heritage since the arrival of Alexis shivered the Poet's
  dream. He looks to see a tragic grief; to his amazement he beholds something
  very like exultation.</p>

  <p>"The trouble with you, Dogson," says Heritage, "is that you're a bit of an
  anarchist. All you false romantics are. You don't see the extraordinary
  beauty of the conventions which time has consecrated. You always want
  novelty, you know, and the novel is usually the ugly and rarely the true. I
  am for romance, but upon the old, noble classic line."</p>

  <p>Dickson is scarcely listening. His eyes are on the distant lovers, and he
  longs to say something which will gently and graciously express his sympathy
  with his friend.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid," he begins hesitatingly, "I'm afraid you've had a bad blow,
  Mr. Heritage. You're taking it awful well, and I honour you for it."</p>

  <p>The Poet flings back his head. "I am reconciled," he says. "After all 'tis
  better to have loved and lost,' you know. It has been a great experience and
  has shown me my own heart. I love her, I shall always love her, but I realize
  that she was never meant for me. Thank God I've been able to serve
  her&mdash;that is all a moth can ask of a star. I'm a better man for it,
  Dogson. She will be a glorious memory, and Lord! what poetry I shall write! I
  give her up joyfully, for she has found her mate. 'Let us not to the marriage
  of true minds admit impediments!' The thing's too perfect to grieve about...
  Look! There is romance incarnate."</p>

  <p>He points to the figures now silhouetted against the further sea. "How
  does it go, Dogson?" he cries. "'And on her lover's arm she leant'&mdash;
  what next? You know the thing."</p>

  <p>Dickson assists and Heritage declaims:</p>

  <p class="poem">"And on her lover's arm she leant,<br>
  And round her waist she felt it fold,<br>
  And far across the hills they went<br>
  In that new world which is the old:<br>
  Across the hills, and far away<br>
  Beyond their utmost purple rim,<br>
  And deep into the dying day<br>
  The happy princess followed him."</p>

  <p>He repeats the last two lines twice and draws a deep breath. "How right!"
  he cries. "How absolutely right! Lord! It's astonishing how that old bird
  Tennyson got the goods!"</p>

  <p>After that Dickson leaves him and wanders among the thickets on the edge
  of the Huntingtower policies above the Laver glen. He feels childishly happy,
  wonderfully young, and at the same time supernaturally wise. Sometimes he
  thinks the past week has been a dream, till he touches the sticking-plaster
  on his brow, and finds that his left thigh is still a mass of bruises and
  that his right leg is woefully stiff. With that the past becomes very real
  again, and he sees the Garple Dean in that stormy afternoon, he wrestles
  again at midnight in the dark House, he stands with quaking heart by the
  boats to cut off the retreat. He sees it all, but without terror in the
  recollection, rather with gusto and a modest pride. "I've surely had a
  remarkable time," he tells himself, and then Romance, the goddess whom he has
  worshipped so long, marries that furious week with the idyllic. He is
  supremely content, for he knows that in his humble way he has not been found
  wanting. Once more for him the Chavender or Chub, and long dreams among
  summer hills. His mind flies to the days ahead of him, when he will go
  wandering with his pack in many green places. Happy days they will be, the
  prospect with which he has always charmed his mind. Yes, but they will be
  different from what he had fancied, for he is another man than the complacent
  little fellow who set out a week ago on his travels. He has now assurance of
  himself, assurance of his faith. Romance, he sees, is one and indivisible
 ... </p>

  <p>Below him by the edge of the stream he sees the encampment of the Gorbals
  Die-Hards. He calls and waves a hand, and his signal is answered. It seems to
  be washing day, for some scanty and tattered raiment is drying on the sward.
  The band is evidently in session, for it is sitting in a circle, deep in
  talk.</p>

  <p>As he looks at the ancient tents, the humble equipment, the ring of small
  shockheads, a great tenderness comes over him. The Die-Hards are so tiny, so
  poor, so pitifully handicapped, and yet so bold in their meagreness. Not one
  of them has had anything that might be called a chance. Their few years have
  been spent in kennels and closes, always hungry and hunted, with none to care
  for them; their childish ears have been habituated to every coarseness, their
  small minds filled with the desperate shifts of living...  And yet, what a
  heavenly spark was in them! He had always thought nobly of the soul; now he
  wants to get on his knees before the queer greatness of humanity.</p>

  <p>A figure disengages itself from the group, and Dougal makes his way up the
  hill towards him. The Chieftain is not more reputable in garb than when we
  first saw him, nor is he more cheerful of countenance. He has one arm in a
  sling made out of his neckerchief, and his scraggy little throat rises bare
  from his voluminous shirt. All that can be said for him is that he is
  appreciably cleaner. He comes to a standstill and salutes with a special
  formality.</p>

  <p>"Dougal," says Dickson, "I've been thinking. You're the grandest lot of
  wee laddies I ever heard tell of, and, forbye, you've saved my life. Now, I'm
  getting on in years, though you'll admit that I'm not that dead old, and I'm
  not a poor man, and I haven't chick or child to look after. None of you has
  ever had a proper chance or been right fed or educated or taken care of. I've
  just the one thing to say to you. From now on you're my bairns, every one of
  you. You're fine laddies, and I'm going to see that you turn into fine men.
  There's the stuff in you to make Generals and Provosts&mdash;ay, and Prime
  Ministers, and Dod! it'll not be my blame if it doesn't get out."</p>

  <p>Dougal listens gravely and again salutes.</p>

  <p>"I've brought ye a message," he says. "We've just had a meetin' and I've
  to report that ye've been unanimously eleckit Chief Die-Hard. We're a' hopin'
  ye'll accept."</p>

  <p>"I accept," Dickson replies. "Proudly and gratefully I accept."</p>

  <p>The last scene is some days later, in a certain southern suburb of
  Glasgow. Ulysses has come back to Ithaca, and is sitting by his fireside,
  waiting for the return of Penelope from the Neuk Hydropathic. There is a
  chill in the air, so a fire is burning in the grate, but the laden tea-table
  is bright with the first blooms of lilac. Dickson, in a new suit with a
  flower in his buttonhole, looks none the worse for his travels, save that
  there is still sticking-plaster on his deeply sunburnt brow. He waits
  impatiently with his eye on the black marble timepiece, and he fingers
  something in his pocket.</p>

  <p>Presently the sound of wheels is heard, and the pea-hen voice of Tibby
  announces the arrival of Penelope. Dickson rushes to the door, and at the
  threshold welcomes his wife with a resounding kiss. He leads her into the
  parlour and settles her in her own chair.</p>

  <p>"My! but it's nice to be home again!" she says. "And everything that
  comfortable. I've had a fine time, but there's no place like your own
  fireside. You're looking awful well, Dickson. But losh! What have you been
  doing to your head?"</p>

  <p>"Just a small tumble. It's very near mended already. Ay, I've had a grand
  walking tour, but the weather was a wee bit thrawn. It's nice to see you back
  again, Mamma. Now that I'm an idle man you and me must take a lot of jaunts
  together."</p>

  <p>She beams on him as she stays herself with Tibby's scones, and when the
  meal is ended, Dickson draws from his pocket a slim case. The jewels have
  been restored to Saskia, but this is one of her own which she has bestowed
  upon Dickson as a parting memento. He opens the case and reveals a necklet of
  emeralds, any one of which is worth half the street.</p>

  <p>"This is a present for you," he says bashfully.</p>

  <p>Mrs. McCunn's eyes open wide. "You're far too kind," she gasps. "It must
  have cost an awful lot of money."</p>

  <p>"It didn't cost me that much," is the truthful answer.</p>

  <p>She fingers the trinket and then clasps it round her neck, where the green
  depths of the stones glow against the black satin of her bodice. Her eyes are
  moist as she looks at him. "You've been a kind man to me," she says, and she
  kisses him as she has not done since Janet's death.</p>

  <p>She stands up and admires the necklet in the mirror. Romance once more,
  thinks Dickson. That which has graced the slim throats of princesses in
  far-away Courts now adorns an elderly matron in a semi-detached villa; the
  jewels of the wild Nausicaa have fallen to the housewife Penelope.</p>

  <p>Mrs. McCunn preens herself before the glass. "I call it very genteel," she
  says. "Real stylish. It might be worn by a queen."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say but it has," says Dickson.</p>
