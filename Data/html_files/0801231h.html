  <p style="text-indent:0">CAL REYNOLDS shifted his tobacco quid to the other
  side of his mouth as he squinted down the dull blue barrel of his Winchester.
  His jaws worked methodically, their movement ceasing as he found his bead. He
  froze into rigid immobility; then his finger hooked on the trigger. The crack
  of the shot sent the echoes rattling among the hills, and like a louder echo
  came an answering shot. Reynolds flinched down, flattening his rangy body
  against the earth, swearing softly. A gray flake jumped from one of the rocks
  near his head, the ricocheting bullet whining off into space. Reynolds
  involuntarily shivered. The sound was as deadly as the singing of an unseen
  rattler.</p>

  <p>He raised himself gingerly high enough to peer out between the rocks in
  front of him. Separated from his refuge by a broad level grown with
  mesquite-grass and prickly-pear, rose a tangle of boulders similar to that
  behind which he crouched. From among these boulders floated a thin wisp of
  whitish smoke. Reynold's keen eyes, trained to sun-scorched distances,
  detected a small circle of dully gleaming blue steel among the rocks. That
  ring was the muzzle of a rifle, but Reynolds well knew who lay behind that
  muzzle.</p>

  <p>The feud between Cal Reynolds and Esau Brill had been long, for a Texas
  feud. Up in the Kentucky mountains family wars may straggle on for
  generations, but the geographical conditions and human temperament of the
  Southwest were not conducive to long-drawn-out hostilities. There feuds were
  generally concluded with appalling suddenness and finality. The stage was a
  saloon, the streets of a little cow-town, or the open range. Sniping from the
  laurel was exchanged for the close-range thundering of six-shooters and
  sawed-off shotguns which decided matters quickly, one way or the other.</p>

  <p>The case of Cal Reynolds and Esau Brill was somewhat out of the ordinary.
  In the first place, the feud concerned only themselves. Neither friends nor
  relatives were drawn into it. No one, including the participants, knew just
  how it started. Cal Reynolds merely knew that he had hated Esau Brill most of
  his life, and that Brill reciprocated. Once as youths they had clashed with
  the violence and intensity of rival young catamounts. From that encounter
  Reynolds carried away a knife scar across the edge of his ribs, and Brill a
  permanently impaired eye. It had decided nothing. They had fought to a bloody
  gasping deadlock, and neither had felt any desire to 'shake hands and make
  up.' That is a hypocrisy developed in civilization, where men have no stomach
  for fighting to the death. After a man has felt his adversary's knife grate
  against his bones, his adversary's thumb gouging at his eyes, his adversary's
  boot-heels stamped into his mouth, he is scarcely inclined to forgive and
  forget, regardless of the original merits of the argument.</p>

  <p>So Reynolds and Brill carried their mutual hatred into manhood, and as
  cowpunchers riding for rival ranches, it followed that they found
  opportunities to carry on their private war. Reynolds rustled cattle from
  Brill's boss, and Brill returned the compliment. Each raged at the other's
  tactics, and considered himself justified in eliminating his enemy in any way
  that he could. Brill caught Reynolds without his gun one night in a saloon at
  Cow Wells, and only an ignominious flight out the back way, with bullets
  barking at his heels, saved the Reynolds scalp.</p>

  <p>Again Reynolds, lying in the chaparral, neatly knocked his enemy out of
  his saddle at five hundred yards with a .30-.30 slug, and, but for the
  inopportune appearance of a line-rider, the feud would have ended there,
  Reynolds deciding, in the face of this witness, to forego his original
  intention of leaving his covert and hammering out the wounded man's brains
  with his rifle butt.</p>

  <p>Brill recovered from his wound, having the vitality of a longhorn bull, in
  common with all his sun-leathered iron-thewed breed, and as soon as he was on
  his feet, he came gunning for the man who had waylaid him.</p>

  <p>Now after these onsets and skirmishes, the enemies faced each other at
  good rifle range, among the lonely hills where interruption was unlikely.</p>

  <p>For more than an hour they had lain among the rocks, shooting at each hint
  of movement. Neither had scored a hit, though the .30-.30's whistled
  perilously close.</p>

  <p>In each of Reynold's temples a tiny pulse hammered maddeningly. The sun
  beat down on him and his shirt was soaked with sweat. Gnats swarmed about his
  head, getting into his eyes, and he cursed venomously. His wet hair was
  plastered to his scalp; his eyes burned with the glare of the sun, and the
  rifle barrel was hot to his calloused hand. His right leg was growing numb
  and he shifted it cautiously, cursing at the jingle of the spur, though he
  knew Brill could not hear. All this discomfort added fuel to the fire of his
  wrath. Without process of conscious reasoning, he attributed all his
  suffering to his enemy. The sun beat dazingly on his sombrero, and his
  thoughts were slightly addled. It was hotter than the hearthstone of hell
  among those bare rocks. His dry tongue caressed his baked lips.</p>

  <p>Through the muddle of his brain burned his hatred of Esau Brill. It had
  become more than an emotion: it was an obsession, a monstrous incubus. When
  he flinched from the whip-crack of Brill's rifle, it was not from fear of
  death, but because the thought of dying at the hands of his foe was an
  intolerable horror that made his brain rock with red frenzy. He would have
  thrown his life away recklessly, if by so doing he could have sent Brill into
  eternity just three seconds ahead of himself.</p>

  <p>He did not analyze these feelings. Men who live by their hands have little
  time for self-analysis. He was no more aware of the quality of his hate for
  Esau Brill than he was consciously aware of his hands and feet. It was part
  of him, and more than part: it enveloped him, engulfed him; his mind and body
  were no more than its material manifestations. He was the hate; it was the
  whole soul and spirit of him. Unhampered by the stagnant and enervating
  shackles of sophistication and intellectuality, his instincts rose sheer from
  the naked primitive. And from them crystallized an almost tangible
  abstraction&mdash;­a hate too strong for even death to destroy; a hate
  powerful enough to embody itself in itself, without the aid or the necessity
  of material substance.</p>

  <p>For perhaps a quarter of an hour neither rifle had spoken. Instinct with
  death as rattlesnakes coiled among the rocks soaking up poison from the sun's
  rays, the feudists lay each waiting his chance, playing the game of endurance
  until the taut nerves of one or the other should snap.</p>

  <p>It was Esau Brill who broke. Not that his collapse took the form of any
  wild madness or nervous explosion. The wary instincts of the wild were too
  strong in him for that. But suddenly, with a screamed curse, he hitched up on
  his elbow and fired blindly at the tangle of stones which concealed his
  enemy. Only the upper part of his arm and the corner of his blue-shirted
  shoulder were for an instant visible. That was enough. In that flash-second
  Cal Reynolds jerked the trigger, and a frightful yell told him his bullet had
  found its mark. And at the animal pain in that yell, reason and life-long
  instincts were swept away by an insane flood of terrible joy. He did not
  whoop exultantly and spring to his feet; but his teeth bared in a wolfish
  grin and he involuntarily raised his head. Waking instinct jerked him down
  again. It was chance that undid him. Even as he ducked back, Brill's
  answering shot cracked.</p>

  <p>Cal Reynolds did not hear it, because, simultaneously with the sound,
  something exploded in his skull, plunging him into utter blackness, shot
  briefly with red sparks.</p>

  <p>The blackness was only momentary. Cal Reynolds glared wildly around,
  realizing with a frenzied shock that he was lying in the open. The impact of
  the shot had sent him rolling from among the rocks, and in that quick instant
  he realized that it had not been a direct hit. Chance had sent the bullet
  glancing from a stone, apparently to flick his scalp in passing. That was not
  so important. What was important was that he was lying out in full view,
  where Esau Brill could fill him full of lead. A wild glance showed his rifle
  lying close by. It had fallen across a stone and lay with the stock against
  the ground, the barrel slanting upward. Another glance showed his enemy
  standing upright among the stones that had concealed him.</p>

  <p>In that one glance Cal Reynolds took in the details of the tall, rangy
  figure: the stained trousers sagging with the weight of the holstered
  six-shooter, the legs tucked into the worn leather boots; the streak of
  crimson on the shoulder of the blue shirt, which was plastered to the
  wearer's body with sweat; the tousled black hair, from which perspiration was
  pouring down the unshaven face. He caught the glint of yellow tobacco-stained
  teeth shining in a savage grin. Smoke still drifted from the rifle in Brill's
  hands.</p>

  <p>These familiar and hated details stood out in startling clarity during the
  fleeting instant while Reynolds struggled madly against the unseen chains
  which seemed to hold him to the earth. Even as he thought of the paralysis a
  glancing blow on the head might induce, something seemed to snap and he
  rolled free. Rolled is hardly the word: he seemed almost to dart to the rifle
  that lay across the rock, so light his limbs felt.</p>

  <p>Dropping behind the stone he seized the weapon. He did not even have to
  lift it. As it lay it bore directly on the man who was now approaching.</p>

  <p>His hand was momentarily halted by Esau Brill's strange behavior. Instead
  of firing or leaping back into cover the man came straight on, his rifle in
  the crook of his arm, that damnable leer still on his unshaven lips. Was he
  mad? Could he not see that his enemy was up again, raging with life, and with
  a cocked rifle at his heart? Brill seemed not to be looking at him, but to
  one side, at the spot where Reynolds had just been lying.</p>

  <p>Without seeking further for the explanation of his foe's actions, Cal
  Reynolds pulled the trigger. With the vicious spang of the report a blue
  shred leaped from Brill's broad breast. He staggered back, his mouth flying
  open. And the look on his face froze Reynolds again. Esau Brill came of a
  breed which fights to its last gasp. Nothing was more certain than that he
  would go down pulling the trigger blindly until the last red vestige of life
  left him. Yet the ferocious triumph was wiped from his face with the crack of
  the shot, to be replaced by an awful expression of dazed surprize. He made no
  move to lift his rifle, which slipped from his grasp, nor did he clutch at
  his wound. Throwing out his hands in a strange, stunned, helpless way, he
  reeled backward on slowly buckling legs, his features frozen into a mask of
  stupid amazement that made his watcher shiver with its cosmic horror.</p>

  <p>Through the opened lips gushed a tide of blood, dyeing the damp shirt. And
  like a tree that sways and rushes suddenly earthward, Esau Brill crashed down
  among the mesquite-grass and lay motionless.</p>

  <p>Cal Reynolds rose, leaving the rifle where it lay. The rolling grass-grown
  hills swam misty and indistinct to his gaze. Even the sky and the blazing sun
  had a hazy unreal aspect. But a savage content was in his soul. The long feud
  was over at last, and whether he had taken his death-wound or not, he had
  sent Esau Brill to blaze the trail to hell ahead of him.</p>

  <p>Then he started violently as his gaze wandered to the spot where he had
  rolled after being hit. He glared; were his eyes playing him tricks? Yonder
  in the grass Esau Brill lay dead&mdash;­yet only a few feet away stretched
  another body.</p>

  <p>Rigid with surprize, Reynolds glared at the rangy figure, slumped
  grotesquely beside the rocks. It lay partly on its side, as if flung there by
  some blind convulsion, the arms outstretched, the fingers crooked as if
  blindly clutching. The short-cropped sandy hair was splashed with blood, and
  from a ghastly hole in the temple the brains were oozing. From a corner of
  the mouth seeped a thin trickle of tobacco juice to stain the dusty
  neck-cloth.</p>

  <p>And as he gazed, an awful familiarity made itself evident. He knew the
  feel of those shiny leather wrist-bands; he knew with fearful certainty whose
  hands had buckled that gun-belt; the tang of that tobacco juice was still on
  his palate.</p>

  <p>In one brief destroying instant he knew he was looking down at his own
  lifeless body. And with the knowledge came true oblivion.</p>
