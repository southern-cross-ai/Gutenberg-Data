<p class="cp">"It is my belief, Watson, founded on my experience,
that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more
dreadful record of sin than does this smiling and beautiful
countryside. You look at these scattered houses and you are
impressed with their beauty. I look at them and the only thought
that comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the
impunity with which crime may be committed there."<br>

<h2><a name="ch00" id="ch00"></a>PROLOGUE. Notes from Jeffery
Blackburn's Diary of the Case.</h2>

<h3>In giving evidence later, Andy Maxton swore it was the hoot of
an owl that woke him.</h3>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>For some moments he lay motionless, his body relaxed, his mind
on that vague borderland between sleeping and waking, conscious of
nothing save the liquid whisper of water hissing softly in his
ears. The outlines of the room, dim in the light of a spent moon,
were unfamiliar to him. Then his eyes moved to the long window
framing the dark garden, and in that moment his mind cleared.</p>

<p>This was his bedroom in that riverside villa&mdash;Lady Evelyn
Harnett's villa at Richmond. In the murmurous silence the pattern
of his thoughts spun smoothly. Four weeks ago Andy Maxton had come
to London from Australia. He had made Lady Evelyn's acquaintance
through the Victorian League, when, home-sick and lonely, he had
run across Ted Bissinger in the British Museum. Bissinger, a
school-friend of Maxton's, was in the office of a film company,
and, taking pity on the solitary young man, had introduced him to
the League.</p>

<p>Over tea and buttered buns the League had arranged this
week-end.</p>

<p>"You'll find Lady Evelyn very interested in Colonials," the
secretary explained, "and there'll be other guests down there
besides yourself." And before the young man, whose mind was
feverishly reviewing the condition of his laundry, had time to
reply, the secretary continued: "Lady Evelyn suggests the
fourteenth. I take it that's quite convenient to you?"</p>

<p>Andy, his mouth full of buttered bun, nodded.</p>

<p>The house was cool and green and stood back in grounds that
sloped gently towards the river. Comparing it with the confined
grubbiness of his Bayswater room, the young man offered up a silent
prayer for the ultimate salvation of the League and his hostess.
Lady Evelyn was in the garden when he arrived.</p>

<p>Wearing heavy gloves and armed with a pair of garden shears, she
was trimming her roses. This plump pink cocoon of a woman smiled
vaguely upon him, paused in her arborial labours long enough to
inquire his name and introduce him to the other guests&mdash;two
Canadian girls and a lanky New Zealander named Insmith&mdash;and
then, to his embarrassment, apparently forgot all about him.</p>

<p>A manservant named Keaton took him in hand, showed him his room,
explained the position of the bath, and left the visitor hopelessly
marooned in a terrifying maze of doors and passages. He was finally
rescued by Insmith, who had been through all this before. The two
men descended to the garden, where they found the Canadians
wandering disconsolately. It was Insmith who suggested the walk,
and the quartette spent the remainder of the afternoon exploring
Richmond Old Church and examining the curious inscriptions on the
tombstones.</p>

<p>Andy met his hostess again at dinner. Lady Evelyn's manner was
even more vague. Over the joint course she became politely curious
and asked him a number of questions about Canada. The young man
countered these inquiries as well as he could, ignoring the sly
twinkle in the eyes of the Dominion's daughters.</p>

<p>"And is it true," continued Lady Evelyn, "that your mounted
policemen wear those charming red coats only on dress parades?"</p>

<p>Andy decided this false impression must be rectified, and on his
halting explanation the hostess excused herself with a shrug and a
smile that never reached her dark eyes.</p>

<p>"I feel," she murmured, "that this is the right time to ask
Keaton to turn on the wireless." The awkward situation was carried
off with an ease that was admirable, yet the young man could not
help thinking that the charm, like the smile, was a little too
mechanical. For the remainder of the meal, he watched covertly.
Andy Maxton was no fool, and while one part of his mind was alive
to the small-talk across the table, another was analysing the
problem of Lady Evelyn Harnett. Before the meal was finished the
young man was convinced that the pretty plump woman at the head of
the table was hag-ridden by some dark anxiety she dared not face
alone. Was it for this reason she had sought to fill her house with
guests on this weekend?</p>

<p>Later they had danced to a programme of swing music broadcast
from the B.B.C. Conversation consumed the interval before
supper&mdash;conversation that centred around the Threat of War,
What Struck Me Most in London, and, inevitably, the English
Climate. They all retired, eventually, at the respectable hour of
11.15. Except for one disturbing incident, Andy Maxton's first
evening at Malden Villa had been pleasant, suburban, and just a
little disappointing.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The young man sat up in bed. A breeze from the open window
chilled his bare chest where his buttonless pyjamas hung open. He
pulled the garment about his broad shoulders and reached for the
wristwatch lying on a small table near by. The luminous hands
pointed to 3.30.</p>

<p>What had awakened him?</p>

<p>Certainly not discomfort. The bed was soft and warm under his
body. Snuggling into the feather pillows, he had fallen asleep
almost instantly, to dream of wide paddocks and fire-scorched
tree-trunks. And now, even as he sat staring into the darkness,
scattered fragments of that vision returned. He had been
bird-nesting in that blackened forest, and had spied a magpie's
nest tilting on a charred bough. A lone bird guarded it, and as he
climbed, it was not a magpie that waited there, but a huge owl. It
had screeched and swooped down on him beating wings...</p>

<p>An owl!</p>

<p>He found himself listening for that screech again. And his mind
flew back to that incident in the drawing-room before supper. The
dance music had faded and, as the partners stood waiting, a voice
had apologized for the interruption and announced a police message.
The concentrated sharpness that new impressions always make had
etched phrases of that message on Andy Maxton's brain.</p>

<p>"One hundred pounds reward will be paid for information
regarding the criminal known as 'The Owl'...he operates
alone...takes his name from his habit of moving out after nightfall
and giving a curious cry like the screech of an owl...lock your
doors...The Owl flies by night..."</p>

<p>And as those last ominous words had faded and the music had
swelled again, Lady Evelyn Harnett had uttered a bitten-off scream.
When they turned, she had fainted to the floor. Servants hurried
with restoratives. A few minutes later she had recovered and
permitted herself to be led, leaning heavily and with her face pale
and twitching, to the bedroom.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later she was once more among armoured in that
cold self-control, murmuring apologetically of a faulty heart.
Nothing particularly sinister, perhaps, in the memory of a swooning
woman, yet, linked with her strange detached manner of the
afternoon, the incident returned to the young man's mind, touched
with dark significance.</p>

<p>Then he heard the footsteps.</p>

<p>Gentle, light, and somehow <i>rustling</i>, they were moving
down the passage outside his room. Maxton swept back the bedclothes
and thrust out one leg, to pause in an agony of indecision. All the
Colonial's horror of a breach of convention was on him, and his
position as guest in this house made the situation even more
uncertain. What would happen if he challenged this nocturnal
prowler to discover some member of the household bent on legitimate
business?</p>

<p>He pulled the bedclothes about him and waited.</p>

<p>The footsteps had passed now, swallowed in the ceaseless mutter
of the river. The room was darker. Through the window he caught a
glimpse of a sickle moon tangled in the trees. The luminous face of
his watch glowed coldly. Somewhere in the room a beam cracked, and
every nerve in Maxton's body leapt and throbbed and tingled. He
found himself listening again, ears strained until the drumming of
his blood merged with the river's whisper. Sweat had sprung out on
his body; he felt it oozing down his bare chest, but he made no
move to wipe it away. The unbroken undercurrent of sound in the
room was almost hypnotic.</p>

<p>That is why he did not move until the voice screamed a second
time.</p>

<p>The screams followed each other so closely that only a sharp,
indrawn breath of terror separated them. They tore at the drumming
silence with the incisive shrillness of ripping silk. And almost
immediately the house responded. The place became alive with
scuttering febrile movement. Voices were raised. Doors slammed.
Lights flashed on. Footsteps, the heavy blundering footsteps of
honest panic, ran and halted and ran again. Someone was hammering
at a door.</p>

<p>Andy Maxton leapt from the bed, fought his way into his
dressing-gown, and without waiting to switch on lights tore open
the door of his room and raced out into the corridor. The brightly
lit, carpeted length was unfamiliar to him. He stood for a moment,
trying to focus that rising tide of perturbation. At one end of the
passage a long window looked out on the dark garden. Then the front
of the house lay behind him. He was about to turn when his
attention was attracted by the sudden appearance of a figure at the
far end, near the window. In the same moment the newcomer saw him,
stiffened and paused, motionless.</p>

<p>Andy stared. "Good God!" he whispered.</p>

<p>The creature at the far end of the passage was swathed from head
to foot in a long black robe that swept the floor. But the face
above it was the face of a bird of prey! Two pale, lidless eyes
blazed above the cruel hooked beak of a nose. Maxton felt the hair
on his neck prickle, and he was conscious of a great wave of nausea
that engulfed him. Fear was blotted out in the primitive urge to
rend and destroy this inhuman thing. With a bellow of rage, the
young man charged down the passage.</p>

<p>What followed was more horrible still.</p>

<p>The creature in black raised its arms, sweeping the robe into
two billowing, wing-like drapes. Maxton had a brief, nightmarish
glimpse of fingers crooked like claws, then with a harsh scream the
figure sprang for the window. So powerful was the movement that
Maxton had the impression of a great bird gliding through the air;
there was a sudden splintering of glass and it was gone. Then he
was aware that the passage was filled with faces. He wheeled and
licked his dry lips. Menzies, the chauffeur, was approaching, a
heavy iron wrench in his hand. Insmith followed a pace behind,
leaner than ever in a hastily tied dressing-gown. The two Canadian
girls clung to each other, eyes wide in shiny faces. A small knot
of frightened domestics brought up the rear. It was the New
Zealander who spoke first, pushing his way forward.</p>

<p>"Maxton, are you all right?"</p>

<p>Andy nodded, gesturing towards the window. "Went that
way&mdash;out into the garden..." He moistened his lips again and
his deep tone trembled. "My God, Insmith, what was it?"</p>

<p>The New Zealander's thin face was dark. "You saw it?"</p>

<p>"My oath! I made a dive at it&mdash;and it flew through that
window! Flew&mdash;like a bird!"</p>

<p>Menzies gave a dry chuckle. "Pretty downy bird, then. 'Cause
he's jus' got away with one o' the finest necklaces in England!
Lifted 'em right under her ladyship's nose, calm as custard!" As he
spoke, the chauffeur stared at that splintered hole in the window
as though mesmerized.</p>

<p>Maxton looked at Insmith. "What's this?" he snapped.</p>

<p>The other nodded. "The pearls were in the safe in Lady Evelyn's
bedroom," he said quietly. "She woke up and caught him in the act.
She screamed twice before he sprang on her."</p>

<p>"Was she harmed?"</p>

<p>Insmith shook his head. "No. She fainted. The alarm was raised
at once, thank God. That manservant..."&mdash;he wheeled on
Menzies&mdash;"what's his name...?"</p>

<p>"Keaton."</p>

<p>"Yes. He's getting the police on the 'phone now. But the safe
was open and the necklace had disappeared."</p>

<p>One of the doors farther down the passage opened and Keaton
stepped out. His smooth face was waxen pale and wiped clean of all
expression. But as he came closer Maxton noticed that the dark eyes
were very bright and he could not quite control his mouth. Keaton's
first words were addressed to the staff rather than the guests.</p>

<p>"There must be no panic. No panic at all. The police will be
here in a few minutes." His voice was soft, modulated, kept that
way by the same iron control that ruled his face. He turned to
Menzies. "Take Ada and Jenny back to their rooms and wait there for
me. I shall call you when the police arrive."</p>

<p>The chauffeur nodded and, shepherding the servants before him,
set out for the rear of the house. Keaton turned to Insmith. "Might
I suggest, sir, that you take the two young ladies into the
drawing-room? I have poked up the fire;" and, like Menzies, the New
Zealander and his shivering companions moved off without a
word.</p>

<p>Keaton watched them go. Standing there, Maxton felt a genuine
admiration for this man's icy repose. To break the awkward silence
that had fallen he asked lamely:</p>

<p>"You got on to the police all right?"</p>

<p>Keaton turned slowly. "Yes, sir." His eyes flickered in the
direction of the shattered window. "If Lady Evelyn had taken my
advice," he added, "they would have been in this house all
day."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>A movement, too indeterminate to be called a shrug, settled
lightly on the other's shoulders. "There is a reward of one hundred
pounds for the capture of The Owl," he said calmly.</p>

<p>Andy stared. "That's it&mdash;an owl!"</p>

<p>Keaton said quietly: "Her ladyship knew he was coming. She had
been warned. Three times in the past week those cards came." He was
speaking more naturally now, as though it was almost a relief to
talk. "I begged her to go to the police, but she feared the
publicity. Instead, she preferred to fill her house with guests."
The pause was subtly barbed.</p>

<p>But Andy Maxton's mind was on other things. "You were first into
Lady Evelyn's room after that scream?" And as Keaton nodded: "What
did you see?"</p>

<p>"The small bowl lamp beside the bed was alight. Lady Evelyn was
lying in the centre of the floor, between the bed and the wall
safe." The servant closed his eyes as if picturing the scene in his
mind. "I noticed that the door of the safe was hanging open. I
noticed two other things, also."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"One was the empty case of the necklace, tossed down on the
floor. The other..." Keaton stopped and gave a quick glance over
his shoulder. "The other was this..." He reached in the pocket of
his dressing-gown and produced a small square of white pasteboard.
Maxton took the proffered card and turned it over. One side was
blank. On the reverse, three words were printed in ink.</p>

<p><i>"Fly by Night."</i>
</p>

<p>Andy looked up. "Where did you find this?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It was lying a few inches away from Lady Evelyn's body," Keaton
replied.</p>

<p>A loud knocking sounded through the house. The servant started
like a man springing to attention. With that summons, all the old
subservience returned, and Keaton inclined his head. "Excuse me,
sir," he murmured. "This, I think, will be the police."</p>

<p>But Andy Maxton did not move. He was still staring at the card
in his hand when Keaton opened the door to the officers of the
law.</p>

<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>CHAPTER ONE. "The Chief was in a
proper stew..."</h2>

<h3>MONDAY, JUNE 10th.</h3>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Thunder on his brow, three morning papers twisted in his right
hand, Chief Inspector William Jamison Read strode the corridors of
New Scotland Yard. Manners, his private secretary, heard those
heavy footsteps and gave a hopeless little shrug. When the door was
flung open, he was typing busily. He looked up and nodded.</p>

<p>"Good morning, sir."</p>

<p>Read nodded curtly. "'Mornin'. Mail in yet?"</p>

<p>"I'm expecting it any moment now, Mr. Read, But I've put all the
morning papers on your desk."</p>

<p>The big man's mouth set like a trap. "Don't talk to me about
morning papers," he snarled, and waved a tightly rolled baton over
his secretary's head. "What d'you think these
are&mdash;Valentines?" He hunched his shoulders. "I'd like to take
every single copy of this morning's press and ram it down the
throats of those lily-livered editors till their eyes popped
out!"</p>

<p>Manners' fingers reached for a typewritten slip among the papers
on his desk. He cleared his throat preparatory to speaking, but
Read cut in before him.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he snapped.</p>

<p>The secretary's voice was toneless. "Memorandum from the
Assistant Commissioner, sir. He'd like to see you at your earliest
convenience."</p>

<p>"You bet he would!" The Chief Inspector started in the direction
of his private office. "Got any other good news, eh?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Blackburn is waiting inside, sir."</p>

<p>Read halted. He jerked his head towards his door and his tone
was incredulous. "Jeff in there?" And as Manners nodded, "How
long's he been waiting?"</p>

<p>"He came here shortly after nine o'clock," the secretary
explained.</p>

<p>The big man nodded and strode across the room. He halted with
one hand on the door, and his clipped grey moustache lifted in the
faintest semblance of a sour smile. "Bring the mail in as soon as
it comes, Manners." His tone was curt. "And I'm not to be
disturbed&mdash;understand? If anyone wants me, I've gone roaming
somewhere in Tibet&mdash;looking for a Shangri-la!"</p>

<p>He swung the door open and walked inside.</p>

<p>Lounging loosely in his swivel chair, his shoes on the desk, a
tall, powerfully built young man lay back with his hands clasped
behind his head, staring at the ceiling through the smoke of a
cigarette. A lock of brown hair snaked down across his forehead.
The cigarette between his lips quivered as he spoke without
moving.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mr. Jeffery Blackburn. "Joy cometh with the morning!
How are you Chief?"</p>

<p>Read closed the door and stood with his back against it. His
tone was savagely genial. "Who&mdash;me? Oh, I'm all right. And
you're pretty comfortable yourself, I should say. If not, just let
me know, and I'll send Manners out for a couple of cushions and a
hot-water bottle!"</p>

<p>Jeffery took his feet off the desk, sat up and eyed the older
man reproachfully. "Now, Mister Read, is that nice? Is that real
old English courtesy? I tear myself away from my charming cottage
at Thursby&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector crossed to the desk and leant over it,
supporting himself on clenched fists. "Now, just a minute, my young
cockerel," he said measuredly. "Just because your respected father
was my closest friend&mdash;just because I took you under my wing
when he died&mdash;just because I've given you more or less the run
of this place, and in return you've given me a hand in solving a
few tricky cases, all this doesn't give you permission to blow in
here as though you owned the building, sit down in my chair and
shove your number nines on my desk!" Read drummed with his fist.
"So get out of that chair&mdash;<i>tout suite</i>!"</p>

<p>"Dammit," protested Jeffery, rising, "it's the only comfortable
seat in the room!" He crushed out his cigarette in the ashtray.
"You know dashed well you use these others to torture confessions
out of your suspects."</p>

<p>"Jeff,"&mdash;Read folded his arms and fixed the young man with
a basilisk eye&mdash;"I'm in no mood for your cheerful badinage
this morning." He uncoiled one hand and waved a slip of paper in
his companion's face. "See that, my boy? It's from the Assistant
Commissioner. In half an hour I'm going to get enough hot air to
last me for the rest of my life!" The Chief Inspector turned on his
heel and dumped himself in his chair with such force that every
spring squeaked in violent protest. "Where the devil have you been
all this time, anyway? You weren't at your cottage, my boy. Parker
told me you'd gone to the Riviera."</p>

<p>"All right, all right!" Ignoring the other's frown, Jeffery
pushed a wire basket on one side and sat on the corner of the desk.
"I was at Antilus, if you must know. But what's got you so
rattled?"</p>

<p>"Seen the paper this morning?"</p>

<p>Jeffery shook his head. "Only the crossword puzzle. I started to
do it while I was waiting for you."</p>

<p>"Crossword puzzle, eh!" Read's tone was heavy with contempt.
"Well, my young professor, here's another crossword puzzle to
occupy your mind&mdash;and if you work this one out, I'm the
monkey's uncle!" A big paw thumped the half-dozen papers piled
neatly on his desk. "You didn't, by any chance, read the editorial
in this morning's <i>Clarion?</i>"</p>

<p>Jeffery was watching his friend curiously. Long association had
inured him to the Chief Inspector's crusty whims, but this present
mood was something deeper. There were lines on Read's bulldog face
that told of sleepless nights and gnawing anxieties; the heavy
wrinkle between the greying bushy eyebrows was newly formed. The
young man stifled the flippant reply that rose to his lips. Instead
he said simply: "No, Chief, I didn't."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector rummaged through the pile of newspapers with
ungentle hands, dragged one out and flicked through the pages.
Coming upon what he sought, he folded the paper and leaned back in
his chair. "Listen to this little journalistic classic," he
snarled, clearing his throat.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"For a number of years" [he read], "Scotland
Yard has been the Aunt Sally of the popular crime novelist. The
great public have accepted this with the same good-natured
tolerance with which they accept the mother-in-law gag or jokes
about the English weather. But when the laugh is turned upon the
public&mdash;when a single individual snaps his fingers at the
resources of Scotland Yard and spreads terror and violence
unhampered&mdash;it is quite time we readjusted our ideas
concerning the so-called efficiency of an organization which spends
thousands of pounds&mdash;taxpayers' money&mdash;in what is
laughingly called 'protection' and law and order..."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector raised his eyes and glared at his companion.
"I don't see you smiling, Mr. Blackburn," he commented.</p>

<p>"I'm saving it till you get to the funny part," Jeffery said
quietly.</p>

<p>"That's coming," Read announced, burying his head again.
"Listen:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Over the past two months, an individual
cloaking his true identity under the fantastic sobriquet of 'The
Owl' has committed no less than four major robberies. We first
learnt of this criminal's existence when the strong room of the
International and United Bank was blown open and an attempt was
made to make off with £10,000 worth of bonds. We were told that the
only clue obtained by the police was left by the criminal
himself&mdash;a small piece of white pasteboard inscribed with
three words&mdash;'<i>Fly by Night</i>'. We were to become very
familiar with that card, for the next appearance was pinned to the
unconscious body of a caretaker when Sir Charles Mortlake's famous
Cellini Cup was stolen from his private museum..."</p>

<p>Again the Chief Inspector paused. Blackburn, in the act of
lighting a cigarette, did not speak, but nodded to him to continue.
Read's fingers tightened around the newspaper as he read on:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"The public had scarcely recovered from the
shock of this audacious robbery when the newspapers were headlining
the theft of the Duchess of Doone's diamond, snatched from her
throat as she sat in her darkened box at Covent Garden. And the
latest exploit of this daring criminal&mdash;the stealing of Lady
Evelyn Harnett's valuable necklace&mdash;is too fresh in the public
mind for detailed description. Meanwhile, however, the public
rightfully demand an explanation as to why this reign of terror is
allowed to continue unchecked. Is it because incompetent officials,
collecting huge salaries, are hiding behind a political
smoke-screen of..."</p>

<p>The big man, whose voice had gradually gathered rage, broke off
with a snarl like an enraged animal. Jumping to his feet, he hurled
the newspaper far across the room.</p>

<p>"Hell blast and blister their ruddy souls!" he roared. Hands
thrust in pockets, bull neck forward, he began to pace the floor.
"By God, I'd like to get my hands on the scribbling scavenger who
wrote that benediction! I'd show him how 'incompetent' I am!" The
big man halted opposite his friend, his eyes glittering. "Son, do
you realize I haven't had a decent night's sleep since this
unbegotten sneak thief jumped into the headlines? Do you know what
I've been living on? Black coffee, black looks, and abuse!" He
almost spat the words.</p>

<p>"Have a cigarette," suggested Jeffery calmly.</p>

<p>Read swept the proffered case aside with an angry gesture and
resumed his pacing. "And you&mdash;the one person I can look to for
help&mdash;where are you? Tanning the body beautiful in some
moth-eaten watering place in the South of France!" The fire died
out of the Chief Inspector's eyes and his square shoulders slumped.
"Son, I'm beginning to think I'm too old for the job. I'm just
waiting for the A.C. to suggest that it's time I retired, and so
help me bob, I'll grab the chance with both hands!"</p>

<p>Blackburn edged himself off the desk and walked across to where
Read stood plucking irritably at his grey clipped moustache.</p>

<p>"So it's as bad as that?" he asked quietly. "Then it's just as
well I came at once."</p>

<p>"At once! Goddlemighty, boy, I sprayed telegrams all over the
Continent after you!"</p>

<p>"One reached me only yesterday," Jeffery told him. "I chartered
a 'plane straight away."</p>

<p>Slightly mollified, the other returned to his desk and sat down.
"But didn't you know, Jeff? Every newspaper's been carrying
scareheads bigger than a theatrical poster."</p>

<p>"Shunned 'em like a plague," retorted Jeffery cheerfully.
"Haven't glanced at a newspaper or listened to a wireless in
weeks." He pulled one of the recently maligned chairs up to the
desk and sat down. "Anyway, I'm here, and that's all that matters
for the moment. How long since our night-flying friend
swooped?"</p>

<p>"Five days ago. Paid an early-morning call at Richmond. Got away
with a pearl necklace, valued at something like six thousand
pounds, the property of some scatterbrained society woman down
there." The Chief Inspector pulled open a drawer and took out a
small sheaf of papers fastened together with a clip. "You'll find
the full report written here." He pushed the file across.</p>

<p>There was a pause as Jeffery flicked through the typewritten
sheets. Read opened a box on his desk, took out a cigar and lit it,
watching the young man as he did so. Presently the other raised his
eyes.</p>

<p>"I notice," he observed, "that our mysterious friend is a
stickler for the social niceties&mdash;always sends out his card
before he calls."</p>

<p>The cigar in Read's mouth stuck out at a truculent angle.
"That's his way of thumbin' his nose at us! I tell you, son, he's
got the cheek of the devil himself."</p>

<p>Jeffery pushed the report to one side and leaned his elbows on
the desk. "You've explored every possible avenue, of course?"</p>

<p>"Been over the scene of every crime with a small-tooth comb,"
Read assured him. "A dozen of our best men have raked the
underworld and we've had salt on the tail of every informer in the
square mile. Nothing doin'. Mister Owl flies solo."</p>

<p>"But surely there's some lead somewhere?"</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector shook his head. "Only those visiting-cards
he leaves round about. I tell you, boy, it's almost uncanny the way
this skunk covers his tracks! He's getting away with it so often
it's starting to give Mr. and Mrs. John Public the blue
willies!"</p>

<p>The faintest undercurrent of anxiety in the other's contemptuous
observation made Blackburn glance at him sharply. "And just what do
you mean by that, Chief?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Some damned sensation sheet started it." Read's voice was a
disgusted mutter. He avoided the young man's eyes, being very
interested in the burning tip of his cigar. "It suggested that this
blighter might be superhuman, some arch-criminal who'd learnt the
power of levitation&mdash;like a ruddy bird flying!" He thrust the
cigar into his mouth and bit it savagely. "Lot of damn-fool
nonsense, of course, but they say that's why he doesn't leave any
tracks. And between you and me and a row of Commissioners, son,
it's&mdash;well&mdash;it's gripping the public mind. Lots of people
are afraid to venture out after dark lately&mdash;'specially in
isolated country areas."</p>

<p>Jeffery made no comment. He gathered his big loose figure
together and, rising, strolled across to the window. Outside, the
river glittered under the fresh morning sun, dancing with a million
spearpoints of light. The Air Force monument towered into a sky
flecked with tiny clouds. Abruptly, the young man turned, and his
voice was very quiet.</p>

<p>"All right, Chief, I'm ready. To tell the truth, I'm hungry for
it! We'll work together again&mdash;between us we'll spread the
birdlime all over England. And when The Owl settles on our own
particular branch,"&mdash;he dropped his smoking cigarette to the
floor and set his foot on it&mdash;"we'll crush him as easily as
that!"</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector stood up and grasped his companion's hand.
"Son," he said, "that's done me more good than a month at Margate.
Old Horseface can chew the paper off the walls for all I care now.
I'll just wait until he stops for breath," said Mr. Read, "then
I'll stand back, look him squarely between those fishy eyes of his,
and I'll say&mdash;"</p>

<p>Exactly what the Chief Inspector meant to tell the Assistant
Commissioner, Jeffery was fated never to learn, for at that moment
a knock sounded at the door. It opened, and Manners insinuated
himself cautiously through the aperture, a movement that reminded
Blackburn of a keeper entering the den of a fractious lion. The
secretary carried a number of letters in his hand. He advanced to
the desk, a wary eye on the Inspector.</p>

<p>"Mail, sir," he announced, depositing the letters in a wire
basket. "And, Mr. Read..."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Two people outside to see you&mdash;a young man and a
girl."</p>

<p>Read, shuffling through the letters, did not even glance up.
"Tell 'em I'm busy&mdash;tell 'em I'm in quarantine. Tell 'em
anything, but don't let 'em in here."</p>

<p>Manners nodded. He was almost to the door when Jeffery spoke.
"Who are these people?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The young woman said she was connected with a newspaper&mdash;"
the secretary began.</p>

<p>A sudden detonation drowned the rest of his remark, for Read had
thumped the desk with a force that made the metal inkpot jump from
its stand. "God dammitall," he roared, "you let any of those
ink-fingered spies into this office and, so help me Moses, I'll get
you six months' solitary confinement on bread and water!" The big
man glared at his unfortunate subordinate from under drawn brows.
"Don't stand there gaping like an imbecile! Get rid of
'em&mdash;d'you hear me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Manners swallowed and reached for the door. "I
wouldn't have mentioned it, but they said they had information
about The Owl robberies."</p>

<p>"Then tell 'em to write another editorial about it."</p>

<p>The secretary shrugged. "As you like, sir. But this Miss Blaire
seemed very anxious&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jeffery, watching this duologue with faint amusement, looked up
sharply. "What name did you say?"</p>

<p>Manners turned to him. "The young lady gave her name as Miss
Blaire&mdash;Elizabeth Blaire."</p>

<p>"Betty Blaire!" Jeffery's face lit up and he took a half step in
the direction of the door. "Why, Chief, surely you remember Miss
Blaire? She was the newspaper woman connected with that murder at
the B.B.C.&mdash;don't you remember she gave us a most important
suggestion regarding the locked studio?" Unconsciously, Jeffery
pushed the lock of hair off his forehead. "You must recall the
girl? Why, you were the one&mdash;"</p>

<p>Read interrupted sourly: "All right&mdash;yes&mdash;I remember
her. But just because she's given us some help in the past doesn't
mean we've got to put the welcome mat down whenever she
appears."</p>

<p>"But didn't you hear what Manners said?" Jeffery demanded. "She
wants to give us some information regarding these Owl
robberies."</p>

<p>"So you think. She wants an exclusive interview so that she can
spread my bleeding carcase all over the front page of her scandal
sheet&mdash;"</p>

<p>An urgent young voice spoke from the door. "No, no, Mr. Read!
Please believe me&mdash;you've got it all wrong!" And as the three
men wheeled, Elizabeth Blaire walked into the room. She halted
opposite the Chief Inspector, a slim, defiant figure with cheeks
pink at her own temerity and brown eyes very bright. A ridiculous
hat resembling an inverted bowl of fruit clung perilously to her
sleek brown head. Her hands, twined in each other, were pressed
nervously against her breast. The Chief Inspector stared blankly at
her, and, taking advantage of his silence, the girl spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Mr. Read&mdash;" her voice trembled slightly. "Give me five
minutes&mdash;that's all I ask. If only you'll listen to me..." The
words trailed off. The Chief Inspector, his face dark, stabbed a
finger in the air.</p>

<p>"Young woman," he said measuredly, "there's a notice outside
that door. It's a single word&mdash;Private! P-R-I-V-A-T-E! And
it's not written up there for the fun of the thing.
Understand?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth Blaire nodded. "I know I haven't any right to push my
way in here, but I'll promise to go in five minutes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In time to catch the first edition with your interview, eh?"
Read growled. He gestured to Manners, who was still hovering
uncertainly near the door. The girl saw the movement and turned
towards Jeffery.</p>

<p>"Mr. Blackburn," she said desperately, "you remember me, I know.
Please help me convince the Chief Inspector that I don't want an
interview. I'm not even connected with newspapers now.
I&mdash;I..." The brown eyes dropped for a moment. "I only said
that because I&mdash;I thought it would get me in here." She moved
a step closer so that the bunch of scarlet cherries on her hat was
almost level with his chin. "It's about this Owl&mdash;this
criminal. I know when he's going to strike again. My brother Edward
has received the warning cards!"</p>

<p>She paused. Her breast rose and fell with her hurried
breathing.</p>

<p>With a gesture of his head, Jeffery sent Manners from the room
and pulled up a chair. "Sit down, Miss Blaire," he invited.</p>

<p>The girl turned for Read's approval. That gentleman nodded
curtly. "All right," he growled, "but if this is a
stunt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course it isn't," Jeffery snapped. "Haven't you heard what
Miss Blaire said?" He turned to the girl, who had seated herself
gingerly on the edge of the chair. "Now, what's all this?" he asked
gently.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Blaire glanced towards the door. "I have a friend
waiting outside," she told them. "If he could be present..." She
ignored the Chief Inspector's frowning figure and addressed the
young man. "He's my&mdash;my fiancé...Robert Ashton."</p>

<p>Blackburn strode across the room' and flung open the door. As he
did so, a stocky, fair-haired young man pacing the floor turned
sharply. He had strong, masculine features and a mouth that could
be both obstinate and sulky. Jeffery beckoned him inside and
Elizabeth performed rather awkward introductions. Then Jeffery
pulled up a chair for himself. "Now, Miss Blaire," he said
genially, "what's the trouble?"</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>Elizabeth Blaire spoke quietly.</p>

<p>"I don't know if either of you two gentlemen have heard of my
brother Edward." A little half smile touched her lips. "It's
probably extremely bad taste to sing his praises like this, but Ted
is really rather extraordinary. When he was eighteen he took the
Charteris Medal for Advanced Chemistry, together with a travelling
scholarship which took him to Vienna. There he studied physics
under Professor Karl Kauffmann. Anyhow, he stayed in Vienna until
his scholarship finished, then, having no money, he returned home."
She paused, then added quietly: "Ted and I are completely alone in
the world. We have very little money. Whatever my brother has
achieved has been by hard work alone."</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded. "What is your brother doing now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Working on certain valuable experiments," the girl
explained.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector, toying with a pencil, looked up. "What sort
of experiments?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I'd better start at the beginning," Elizabeth said quietly. She
settled back in her chair and clasped her hands in her lap. "About
eighteen months ago my brother returned from the Continent. The
threat of war was banging very heavily over Europe, and, back in
England, Edward became interested in the country-wide precautions
against gas attacks. For some time he'd had in his mind the
development of anti-toxic gas." A little wrinkle creased her
forehead. "I'm not too sure of the actual details, but my brother
believed that this formula would purify gas-laden air and, apart
from the actual value of the discovery itself, would save the
Government the enormous expense of manufacturing gas-masks and
erecting gas-proof shelters."</p>

<p>"But surely," interposed Jeffery, "experiments for such a
formula would cost a considerable amount of money?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded. "Indeed, yes. Our own finances were so small
that it seemed Edward couldn't hope to achieve anything, when out
of the blue came the offer from Sir Anthony Atherton-Wayne."</p>

<p>The pencil dropped from Read's fingers. He sat up abruptly,</p>

<p>"Isn't that the chap who's mixed up in this big armament deal?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"The same," Elizabeth replied. "And this is where Robert comes
into the story." She turned to where Ashton sat hunched in his
chair, following the conversation with slow movements of his head.
"Robert was actually responsible for Sir Anthony's interest," she
added.</p>

<p>Blackburn transferred his attention to the stocky young man.
"Indeed?" he prompted.</p>

<p>Ashton nodded. His voice, slow and deep, was that of a man who
weighs his words. "Betty should have explained that I'm private
secretary to Sir Anthony," he said. "She happened to mention to me
about her brother's experiments; I felt sure Sir Anthony would be
interested. He interviewed Mr. Blaire and offered him certain
generous terms, together with the use of a small cottage in the
grounds of Sir Anthony's home&mdash;Rookwood Towers. Mr. Blaire
lives in this cottage and carries on his experiments. If he is
successful, Sir Anthony has first claim to buy the formula outright
for a certain sum of money agreed on by both parties."</p>

<p>Jeffery turned to the girl. "So far, has your brother had any
success with his experiments?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes and no."</p>

<p>Read, who had been listening closely to the recital,
snorted.</p>

<p>"What d'you mean&mdash;yes and no? Either they've been
successful or they haven't."</p>

<p>"Not quite, Inspector." Elizabeth Blaire eyed the testy man
steadily. Her tone was edged with a trembling excitement. "About a
month ago," she continued, "a most amazing thing happened. Edward
mislaid some of his notes, and, afraid to tell Sir Anthony, muddled
on desperately. One night he came to see me. He was throbbing with
a sort of&mdash;of frenzied jubilation. It was some time before I
could get anything sensible, out of him. Then he told me that
something had gone wrong with his anti-gas experiments. By sheer
chance, he had hit upon something else&mdash;another
formula&mdash;something almost as revolutionary in its own
way."</p>

<p>She paused, her face alight with recollection. Read and
Blackburn stared, but before they could speak Ashton said
curtly:</p>

<p>"Go on, Betty&mdash;tell them!"</p>

<p>The girl steadied her trembling hands in her lap. "My brother,"
she said slowly, "has discovered a perfect foolproof substitute for
petrol, possessing all the qualities of the article, at about
one-twentieth its price!"</p>

<p>Jeffery gave a long whistle of incredulous amazement. The Chief
Inspector was leaning across his desk, staring at the girl. It was
Blackburn who broke the silence. "But is this formula actually
developed&mdash;or is it merely on paper?"</p>

<p>"Developed to the most practicable degree," Elizabeth assured
him. "Formula Number Four, as Edward calls it, has so far stood up
to every known test, giving three times the power of ordinary
petrol!"</p>

<p>Jeffery felt for his case, opened it and took out a cigarette.
"I suppose," he said quietly, "that your brother realizes the
magnitude of his discovery? It's going to throw the whole
manufacturing world into chaos." He struck a match, and over the
tiny flame his eyes were sombre. "And think what this power would
mean in the hands of an invading country."</p>

<p>From his corner, Ashton spoke dryly. "That's what's keeping Sir
Anthony awake at night."</p>

<p>"But surely it belongs to him?" Jeffery said sharply. "What
about the arrangement?"</p>

<p>"That's the whole trouble," Elizabeth said slowly. "You see, Mr.
Blackburn, my brother declares that he signed himself to Sir
Anthony to produce an anti-toxic gas. He is convinced that the
baronet has no right to this formula discovered quite by
chance."</p>

<p>"And that," commented Ashton, "is the least of our worries." He
stretched his stocky body and pulled his coat about his shoulders.
"You see, gentlemen, in some inexplicable way, this criminal
calling himself The Owl has got wind of Mr. Blaire's
invention."</p>

<p>"The Owl!" Read shot up like a jack-in-a-box, spraying cigar-ash
across his desk. "Great Thundering Herds! How do you know?"</p>

<p>Ashton shrugged. "Blaire's been getting The Owl's visiting-cards
in his mail," he said shortly. "Four have come along up to date.
They all say the same thing. Unless he gives up his formula by a
certain date he's going to be killed."</p>

<p>Read chewed at his cigar. He turned to Elizabeth. "And what does
your brother say about these little birthday cards?"</p>

<p>The girl hesitated before replying, twisting the engagement ring
nervously on her finger.</p>

<p>Ashton spoke for her. "That's the trouble," he said quietly.
"Blaire doesn't take this business very seriously. He declares that
The Owl is an invention of the sensation sheets&mdash;a catch-penny
stunt to increase circulation."</p>

<p>Something in the slight curl of his lips, in the faint
disparagement that coloured his voice, rallied the girl. She said
quickly: "There is some excuse for Ted's attitude. He lives in a
world bounded by the walls of his laboratory. Robert gets very
impatient because he won't come down to realities."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector stood up and crushed out his half-smoked
cigar in an ashtray. "Mr. Ashton mentioned that your brother had
been receiving these warnings..." and as Elizabeth nodded, "Did
they give a time limit?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The twenty-third of this month."</p>

<p>Jeffery grabbed at the newspapers on the desk and scanned the
date line. "Twenty-third," he murmured. "That's the day after
tomorrow."</p>

<p>"He's been given until eleven o'clock on the night,"
supplemented Ashton, and again Blackburn was conscious of the faint
hostility in his tone. The young man leaned over and muttered
something in the Chief Inspector's ear. Read gnawed thoughtfully at
his grey moustache for a few moments, then nodded. Elizabeth was
watching with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>"All right," Read announced, addressing the girl. "We'll give
you all the protection you need. I'll have a squad of men down in
the morning. Rookwood Towers, you said?"</p>

<p>Ashton was producing a small leather case from his pocket. He
extracted a card, rose and handed it to the big man. "You'll find
the address on that," he said, and nodded to Elizabeth. She was
pulling gloves over her slim fingers. Then she crossed to where
Read was standing and put out her hand. Jeffery noticed, with
inward amusement, that his friend gave it an awkward, embarrassed
squeeze and turned abruptly to throw open the door.</p>

<p>"Now, don't you worry, Miss Blaire," he said with curt
amiability. "We'll clip this Owl's wings once and for all." The
girl thanked him with a little smile and tucking her arm through
her fiancé's moved from the room. Jeffery ushered them out and
closed the door. When he turned, Read was standing beside the desk,
turning Ashton's card over in his fingers. "Well, son," he queried,
"what do you think of it all?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you one thing," Jeffery said levelly. "That girl was
frightened. And the sturdy boy friend wasn't too easy in his mind,
either. Also&mdash;they were keeping something back&mdash;something
neither of them had the courage to talk about."</p>

<p>"So you got that, too?" Read's tone was quizzical. "What d'you
think it was?"</p>

<p>"That," replied Jeffery, "is what I mean to find out. I Hope
Rookwood Towers has all modern conveniences. I do so like my
comfort." He turned towards the window and stared out at the
swaying tree-tops. "I wonder," he remarked lazily, "why Mr. Ashton
doesn't like his fiancée's brother?"</p>

<p>"What I'm wondering," the Chief Inspector returned, "is how a
man like Atherton-Wayne comes to be mixed up in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Look out!</i>" yelled Jeffery, and ducked.</p>

<p>There was a sudden crash and splintering of glass. A heavy
object plumped on to the carpet, rolled a few inches and stopped.
The Chief Inspector, who had bobbed behind his desk at the other's
shouted warning, raised himself slowly. The door flew open and an
agitated Manners projected himself into the room.</p>

<p>"W-what happened?" he stammered.</p>

<p>Read, his eyes on the shattered hole in the window, ignored him.
A wave of dull scarlet crept slowly over his heavy face. "By the
great living Hokey!" he gasped, and rage choked the words in his
throat. He grasped the edge of the desk and swallowed audibly,
working his thick neck from side to side. Slowly he turned, to find
Jeffery over a piece of crumpled paper he had picked up from the
floor. The stone around which it had been wrapped gleamed whitely
against the dark pattern of the carpet.</p>

<p>"What happened?" Manners repeated.</p>

<p>Jeffery was smoothing the paper in his fingers. He ran his eye
over it and gave a deep chuckle. "The cheek of the very devil," he
murmured. "Chief, you're certainly right." He held out the message.
"Take a look at this&mdash;it's meant for both of us."</p>

<p>The Inspector almost snatched it from the young man's hand. His
eyes popped as he read the words, printed in ink across the white
surface.</p>

<p class="cpi">"Keep out of this. My first and last warning!"</p>

<p>And it was signed. "<i>The Owl.</i>"</p>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>CHAPTER TWO. "I sensed something
wrong with the entire place..."</h2>

<h3>TUESDAY, JUNE 11TH.</h3>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Jeffery Blackburn depressed the brake pedal of the two-seater
and the car came to a halt with a slither of gripping tyres.</p>

<p>"That will be Rookwood Towers," remarked the young man,
gesturing with a gloved hand. The Chief Inspector, beside him,
leaned forward.</p>

<p>They were descending Pewley Hill into a green and rolling
pasture land, bisected with white roads. Under the clean morning
sky the countryside lay fair and verdant. The River Wey, curling
like a slumbrous serpent, glistened between sloping banks and they
caught a glimpse of the Silent Pool, reflecting the glory of the
morning and blue as a baby's eyes.</p>

<p>Rookwood Towers nestled under the slope of the hill and from
their elevation it gave the impression of cuddling into the green
valley below. A number of rambling outbuildings were almost hidden
in the dark army of trees that were lined up to the very windows. A
winding drive led through stone-pillared gates and more trees stood
sentry-like along its white convolutions. The house was built of
grey stone and thick columns and massive groinwork conveyed, even
at that distance, an impression of age and strength. Adjoining the
house at either side and rising above roof level were two octagonal
towers, pierced at intervals with tiny windows. Centred between
these eminences was a tall cupola rising to a high dome which held
the blank face of a clock. This curious mixture of Jacobean,
Hanoverian and Edwardian architecture was mercifully cloaked by a
wide-spreading growth of ivy and the windows peeped almost coyly
from behind this leafy curtain.</p>

<p>"The house that bombs built," remarked Jeffery. He pressed the
accelerator and the car moved forward.</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>The young man grinned. "Not actually, of course. Rookwood Towers
goes back far, far beyond Sir Anthony's title. But bombs supplied
the filthy lucre to buy that lovely old place. Did you know Sir
Anthony had only been in possession over the last twenty
years?"</p>

<p>The Inspector grunted. "I didn't. How did you know?"</p>

<p>"Had dinner with Ken Bretherton last night." Jeffery shaded his
eyes with his hand against the glare of the road. "It's the story
of the self-made man, Chief. Before the war, the present owner of
the Towers was plain Mr. Wayne. A stockbroker with political
ambitions. Round about 1906, Wayne married Lucy Atherton, the
daughter of old Cornelius Atherton, an American steel magnate. The
war broke out and with his wife's money plus his father-in-law's
business acumen, our friend branched out into the armament
business. A few years later the wife died, but her husband retained
her money and her name, plus a hyphen." Jeffery chuckled as he
swung the wheel. "After all, Chief, you can't blame him Anthony
Atherton-Wayne! Why, it simply rolls off the tongue."</p>

<p>"And the knighthood?"</p>

<p>"<i>Circa</i> nineteen-twenty," retorted Blackburn. "And at that
time Sir John Rookwood, whose ancestors had built the Towers back
in the Tudor times, died. The war had left the Rookwoods with
little but their fine old name, and the death duties were the final
crippling blow. Gossip says that Sir Anthony got the Towers for a
song." Jeffery settled back in his seat. "So let that be a lesson
to you, Chief. Big guns are more than coronets, poison gas than
Norman blood."</p>

<p>Read grunted, but made no other comment. Twenty minutes later,
Jeffery slid the cream two-seater through the stone gateway of the
Towers and guided it round the winding drive. All about them the
trees whispered in the morning breeze. In the distance, a dog
barked, a lonely hopeless sound. As they approached the house, the
trees thinned and they came upon trim lawns, broken by ornamental
shrubs and garden beds. Blackburn pulled the car up before a short
flight of steps leading to the main doorway.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Blaire was waiting for them, a slim figure in well-cut
tweeds. She was hatless, and as she ran down the steps to meet them
her hair glinted golden in the sunlight. She greeted both men with
a smile, then:</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," she said happily. "You know, after I'd left your
office yesterday I was struck with the awful thought you'd only
consented to get rid of me..."</p>

<p>"Miss Blaire!" Jeffery's tone was a reproach.</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't really believe it," the girl assured him. "But
Robert kept undermining my faith. As a matter of fact, he laid a
wager you wouldn't come."</p>

<p>The Inspector cocked an eyebrow at the girl. "Why should your
fiancé think that?" he grunted.</p>

<p>"Oh, Robert gets the weirdest ideas." Her tone dismissed the
subject. She turned and shepherded them up the steps. "Leave the
car. Adams will put it away and bring your bags inside." They
halted before a large iron-studded door. Elizabeth thrust it open
and led them into a wide hall. After the brilliant sunshine
outside, it seemed unusually gloomy and Jeffery, peering, could
make out only the vaguest details. What light the place contained
seeped through four windows set high up and, by this meagre
illumination, the young man could perceive a wide staircase at the
far side, winding upwards. Following its curve, he saw that a
railed gallery ran round the entire square of the hall. As his eyes
focused, he noticed a surprising number of doors opening off in
various directions.</p>

<p>"Wait here," Elizabeth invited. "I'll get Sir Anthony. He's
expecting you." She moved away towards one of the doors.</p>

<p>As it closed behind her, Jeffery turned to the Inspector. "Well,
Chief, what do you think of it?"</p>

<p>Read smoothed his stubbly moustache. "Like the rear end of an
elephant," he commented. "Big, but not impressive."</p>

<p>"For Pete's sake! Doesn't tradition mean anything to you?"
Jeffery waved his hand to the four dim-seen walls. "Do you realize
that Inigo Jones and Chris Wren probably had a hand in adding to
this building. According to legend, the Playdelles built this house
around the ruins of an old Abbey, abandoned when the Black Plague
swept over England! And we're going to stay down here in this
historic spot. Why, Chief, what more could you ask?"</p>

<p>Read's answer was prompt. "Hot and cold water and central
heating," he snapped. "I'm an old man that likes my comfort. And
what's more, so do you, my boy." The Inspector chuckled deep in his
throat. "One night in a draughty bedroom with a stone
floor&mdash;and you'll exchange all the tradition in the world for
a hot-water bottle."</p>

<p>"Double nuts to you!" retorted Jeffery inelegantly. He thrust
his hands into his pockets and strolled aimlessly. The stone floor
threw back faint echoes of his footsteps. In the thick silence, the
ghostly repetition annoyed the young man; he paused to light a
cigarette. Somewhere in the gloom a door opened, but as he wheeled
sharply it clicked shut again. Jeffery glanced at Read. The big
man's face was an indeterminate patch of grey among the shadows,
but from his set stance the other knew he was frowning and
alert.</p>

<p>Jeffery jerked his head in the direction of the interruption.
"Somebody curious?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Whole damn' place is curious," the Inspector growled. "Where is
everybody? Hanged if I wouldn't like to drop one of
Atherton-Wayne's bombs round here&mdash;just to wake somebody up."
He crossed to where Jeffery stood and glanced at his wrist-watch.
In the gloom, the tiny luminous face was a bright oval. "Do you
realize, son, it's nearly ten minutes since that girl left this
room?"</p>

<p>Jeffery opened his mouth, but the remark died unborn. Another
door swung open. He heard a soft well-bred ejaculation, there was a
sudden click and the hall flamed in brilliant light. The transition
was so unexpected that the slim grey-haired man who accompanied
Elizabeth Blaire across the room was standing before Blackburn
while that gentleman was still gaping.</p>

<p>The girl said quietly: "Sir Anthony. This is Jeffery
Blackburn...and this is Inspector Read, of Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>The three men shook hands.</p>

<p>Jeffery, murmurously polite over greetings, was engaged in rapid
mental reorientation. From Ken Bretherton's information, he had
built up his own picture of the owner of Rookwood Towers, an image
that was heavily built, red-faced and rather careless with
aspirates. But the man who stood before him now was as smooth and
as polished as one of the shells from his own factory. Under medium
height&mdash;Sir Anthony had to raise his chin to meet Read's
eyes&mdash;he had slim hands and delicate, almost feminine
features, their paleness accentuated by his closely cut silver grey
hair. Lines about his eyes gave his face a tired expression, but
the mouth was mobile and a suggestion of gentle mirth about the
lips compensated for their thinness.</p>

<p>The baronet was saying: "I must apologize, gentlemen, for
keeping you waiting." His voice was modulated, each word, like his
personality, was neat and polished. "I was over at young Blaire's
cottage. Frankly, I didn't expect you down so soon."</p>

<p>Read nodded. "What's your opinion of these cards the lad's been
getting?"</p>

<p>Sir Anthony shrugged slim shoulders. "One can only hope it is
the work of a practical joker. If, however, it is this criminal,
then the question arises&mdash;how did he learn of the existence of
the formula?"</p>

<p>"These things get about," the Inspector muttered. "I'd like to
have a talk with young Blaire."</p>

<p>Sir Anthony nodded. "As a matter of fact, you've come down at a
very opportune moment," he said. "Edward has arranged a
demonstration of Formula Number Four in his laboratory this
morning. I was discussing the matter with him when you arrived. If
you would care to watch...?"</p>

<p>"Delighted," murmured Jeffery, and Read nodded. The baronet
turned to Elizabeth, but before he could speak, the girl shook her
head.</p>

<p>"I won't come, if you don't mind," she said. "I've seen the
stuff working, and Ted hates a crowd in his lab. Besides, I haven't
finished the final arrangements for Ted's party yet. And there's
not too much time before tomorrow night, not with the hundred and
one things to do. So if you'll excuse me..." She flashed a smile at
the two guests and moved away. Sir Anthony turned back to his
companions.</p>

<p>"This way," he said gently.</p>

<p>He led them across the hall, and ushered them into a passage lit
at intervals with tall stained-glass windows which spilt warm
colour at their feet as they walked. Various doors opened off, but
the three men did not halt until they reached the end of the
corridor. It was while Sir Anthony busied himself with the bolt of
the iron portal guarding this entrance that Jeffery remarked:</p>

<p>"Mr. Blaire is having a party tomorrow night?"</p>

<p>Their guide swung open the door and gestured them through, "Just
an informal little gathering," he returned. "I believe it's
Edward's birthday. Some of his school-friends are coming down from
London."</p>

<p>They were walking in the open now, clear of the house. Read's
heavy footsteps crunched among the gravel. "Isn't tomorrow night
the time The Owl's supposed to call?" he asked.</p>

<p>Sir Anthony, leading the way, spoke without turning, but they
sensed the smile in his voice. "I'm afraid Edward doesn't mean to
let that interfere with his pleasure." His tone sobered. "And,
after all, if this criminal does mean business, I think the lad
would be much safer in his cottage with a crowd of people than
roaming these grounds on his own."</p>

<p>"That," said Jeffery, "depends on the people."</p>

<p>"And the cottage," added Read.</p>

<p>They had come some distance from the house and now walked among
that army of dark trees. Dead leaves rustled under their feet and
the sky, seen between the tangle of branches, seemed very far away.
They seemed to walk beneath a green and tossing sea that whispered
and broke and whispered again. The baronet led them right and left,
picking his way with cat-like delicacy around mossy trunks. As they
emerged once more into bright sunlight, he paused and gestured
before him.</p>

<p>"There is the cottage. Judge for yourself."</p>

<p>It had once been a small chapel, but the thick crumbling walls
were buttressed and shouldered by modern concrete supports. The
narrow pointed windows and arched doorway were the sole remaining
traces of the building's theological origin and, as with the main
house, the additions and replacements were half-hidden under a
luxuriant growth of ivy. A low privet hedge surrounded the cottage.
Sir Anthony led the way through a neatly clipped gap, moved to the
door and rapped on it.</p>

<p>The sound of voices inside, heard softly through an open window,
ceased at that summons. They waited. Read shifted his weight from
one leg to another. Jeffery lit a cigarette. There was no sound but
the wind rustling in the creeper. A frown of annoyance darkened
Atherton-Wayne's aristocratic features; he had already lifted his
hand to the door a second time when it opened abruptly. Robert
Ashton stood revealed. The secretary blinked at the trio, and his
eyes rested on the Inspector.</p>

<p>"So you did come down, after all?" he said.</p>

<p>"Obviously!" Sir Anthony spoke before Read could answer and the
baronet's tone was edged with irritation. "I certainly didn't
expect to find you here, Ashton. Is Blaire inside?"</p>

<p>The young man nodded. If he resented the snub, he did not betray
it. He said quietly: "Yes, Sir Anthony. I've been talking with
Edward. You'll find him in the parlour."</p>

<p>The baronet nodded curtly. Jeffery, watching closely, divined
that something more important than merely being kept waiting at the
door had upset the spruce little man, but he made no comment as
Atherton-Wayne gestured him inside. They were moving across a
shallow hallway when from the room beyond, a voice cried
shrilly.</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>Ashton, following Sir Anthony, said levelly: "It's all right,
Edward. You can come out now."</p>

<p>As he spoke, they entered a wide sunny room, lit by four
windows. Standing under the nearest of these, one hand clasping a
whisky glass, a young man in his middle twenties faced them. The
baronet halted inside the room. "Blaire," he said, "I want you to
meet these two gentlemen&mdash;they are from Scotland Yard."</p>

<p>Edward Blaire set his glass down, took off his thick-lensed
spectacles, then replaced them after a quick, nervous wiping. His
handshake, as he greeted the newcomers, was limp and
unenthusiastic. Ashton was motioning them to seats but Blackburn
could scarcely take his eyes off Blaire's face. Above the thick
glasses, the brow was high and broad, suggesting an intellect of
extraordinary power. Yet this noble forehead accentuated pitifully
the tapering face with its weak petulant mouth and sloping chin. It
was a face without ballast and Jeffery, his eyes flitting from
Blaire's unsteady hands to the almost empty whisky decanter on the
sideboard, realized that the moral courage lacking in that face was
being augmented in other ways.</p>

<p>They were seated now. An uncomfortable silence had fallen. It
was broken by the Chief Inspector, who sat balancing his big figure
on the edge of a divan bed.</p>

<p>"Well, son," he began, "from what Sir Anthony tells me, You've
got something on your hands about as harmless as a bagful of
rattlesnakes&mdash;especially now that Mister Owl's put the finger
on you."</p>

<p>Blaire shrugged. "Providing such a person exists,
Inspector."</p>

<p>"But those warning cards&mdash;" began Atherton-Wayne, when
Blaire swung round to where Ashton sat watching them.</p>

<p>"Come on, Robert," he said, "now's your chance to own up. You
sent me those cards as a joke, didn't you?"</p>

<p>Ashton made a weary gesture. "For the twentieth time&mdash;no."
A trace of irritation edged his tone. "Even admitting I was stupid
enough to do such a thing, I'd hardly go to the trouble of dragging
these gentlemen down here on a fool's errand."</p>

<p>The bed creaked as Inspector Read leaned forward. "The Owl
exists all right," he said grimly. "And quite apart from our
night-flyin' friend, you've got a headache on your hands, son.
We're all grown men and none of us believe in fairies. If your
formula goes on the market, there's a packet of oil companies who
are goin' to be pinched where it hurts most&mdash;in the bank
account." He wagged a stubby finger at the young man. "Boiled down,
son, it means that while there's a lot of people who'd be glad to
see your formula on the market, there's also a mighty tough crowd
who'd give anything they possess to keep it off."</p>

<p>Blaire had crossed to the sideboard and was pouring himself a
drink. He turned, glass in hand. The smile about that small mouth
was very close to a sneer.</p>

<p>"Inspector Read, you said a moment ago that we are all grown men
and that none of us believe in fairies. Yet you ask me to believe
in the existence of a criminal who flies through the air like a
bird, who hoots like an owl and possesses a sort of superhuman
intelligence." He drained his glass and set it on the sideboard. "I
gave up believing in that kind of thing on my tenth birthday."</p>

<p>Read's jaw tightened. "But we're convinced&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So much so that you'd bring an army of detectives down here to
upset my daily routine and hamper my work. Very well. I can do
nothing to stop you doing that. On the other hand, I shall
certainly do nothing to help you. The whole thing is a childish
waste of time and money."</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne rose to his feet. "Upon my soul, Blaire," he said
stiffly, "you are surely one of the rudest and most obstinate young
men I have ever met. Surely you realize&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That we're wasting time talking like this," Blaire cut in
sharply. His restless hands tightened the tapes of the
chemical-stained smock he wore over his suit. "Perhaps these
gentlemen from Scotland Yard would like to see the demonstration of
the formula?"</p>

<p>The baronet said coldly: "If you have no objection."</p>

<p>"Why should I? The whole world will see it in operation within
the next few months." The young man crossed and threw open a door
at the far end of the room. "This is the lab," he explained.</p>

<p>The three men rose and followed him, but half-way across the
room Ashton paused and glanced at his wrist-watch. "Not much use my
coming in," he muttered. "I've seen the stuff working before, so
I'll be cutting off..." He nodded to the group and made his way out
into the hall. Read and Jeffery&mdash;a curiously silent
Jeffery&mdash;were close behind Atherton-Wayne as Blaire stood back
to usher them inside. And as the young chemist closed the door
behind them, Jeffery glanced round.</p>

<p>The laboratory was small, but bright and spotlessly clean. One
wall was occupied by a large bookcase, packed with volumes that
overflowed on to the floor. Under the windows, a bench ran the full
length of the room, a bench which supported racks of test tubes,
bottles of liquids in varying colours and a large glass retort over
an unlit Bunsen burner. Near the centre of the floor, anchored to a
concrete base, a stripped petrol engine held Jeffery's
attention.</p>

<p>Blaire saw his interest. "My mechanical guinea pig," he
explained. "It's an ordinary twelve-cylinder car engine, the exact
counterpart of tens of thousands on the road today." Gone was the
languid condescension of a few minutes before; there was a tremor
of excitement in his voice and the pale cheeks were flushed with
triumphant anticipation. He extracted a bunch of keys from his
pocket and, selecting one, crossed to a small iron safe half-hidden
under the bench. A few seconds later he returned, carrying a wooden
box and, sliding back the cover, revealed a stoppered test-tube
lying cushioned in cotton wool. The young chemist handed the box to
Sir Anthony, and extracting the test-tube almost reverently, held
it up to the light.</p>

<p>"Formula Number Four," he announced.</p>

<p>The three men gathered round, staring at the colourless solution
that almost filled the tube. Jeffery spoke for the fist time since
his introduction. "What exactly is this substance?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>Blaire returned the tube to its nest of cotton wool. "Naturally,
I haven't time to go into all details." Again that faint note of
condescension had crept into his tone. "But briefly, you probably
already know that there are factories in Russia and America
producing alcohol&mdash;the basis of all motor fuel&mdash;from
waste and other cellulosed materials. But the process of chemical
decomposition is far too costly to compete with the present-day
price of ordinary petrol. That means every chemist under the sun
has been searching feverishly for a micro-organism which can be
cultivated and which can carry out this decomposing process quickly
and cheaply."</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded.</p>

<p>Behind his thick spectacles, Blaire's dark eyes were alight. "By
sheer accident," he said, "I have discovered a perfect substitute
for that micro-organism! By chance, I have found the one thing that
chemists have been searching for!"</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne caressed one slim hand in another. "You realize
the possibilities, gentlemen? Blaire has discovered a process for
obtaining petrol from any starchy or sugary substance. From figs,
potatoes, beets, artichokes, maize, prickly pear or even ordinary
garden weeds!"</p>

<p>"Great thundering herds!" the Inspector ejaculated. And in the
silence that followed, the whisper of the wind in the trees outside
seemed to fill the whole room.</p>

<p>"And the secret is mine alone," Blaire said softly. The queer
ill-balanced face was alight with some strange inward fire, and he
spoke like an oracle pronouncing divination. "Who knows that my
name may not rank with Newton and Pasteur and Edison&mdash;" He
broke off, glanced quickly over his shoulder and his tone climbed
shrilly. "Who's there?"</p>

<p>Read was staring at the young man. "What's the matter?" he
grunted.</p>

<p>"Thought I heard someone at the door&mdash;like a soft knock."
They waited, but nothing broke the sibilant silence of the
laboratory. Blaire shrugged. "Getting like an old woman," he
muttered irritably. "All this damned chatter about ghosts and
boogles!" He picked up a teaspoon from the bench, wiped it with
cotton wool, then lifted the phial carefully from the box. "Let's
get this show over," he said and led them towards the engine.</p>

<p>Blaire uncorked the phial with his teeth and poured a few drops
of the formula into the teaspoon. He handed the precious tube to
Atherton-Wayne and, bending, fed the liquid delicately into the
carburettor. Then, straightening, he pointed to a black button set
a few feet away from the engine. "Self-starter," he said tersely,
and nodded to Read. "Put your foot on it."</p>

<p>The Inspector did so. There was a dry whirring, a soft splutter
from the engine, and a moment later it began to purr. Jeffery could
visualize the shining cylinders rising and falling in perfect
timing. A tiny wisp of green smoke rose from the working parts and
hung lazily on the quiet air. Edward Blaire spread his hands.</p>

<p>"There you are, gentlemen."</p>

<p>Read was peering short-sightedly at the gently pulsing engine.
"And just how long do you expect it to work on those few
drops?"</p>

<p>The young chemist stroked his chin. "According to my
calculations, that amount should drive a fourteen horse-power
engine over a distance of twelve to fifteen miles," he replied.</p>

<p>No one questioned the statement. The positive sincerity in the
young man's tone stamped the words with the finality of fact. The
Inspector nodded and turned away, satisfied. "All right," he said
shortly. "We've seen enough." He glanced at Blackburn. "What do you
think, son?"</p>

<p>"Wonderful&mdash;and dangerous," Jeffery said quietly. He was
staring at the purring engine. Blaire had pulled a small pad from
his pocket and was making calculations on it with a stylo pen.
Atherton-Wayne coughed gently: when they glanced at him, he nodded
towards the entrance. The three men moved across the bright room.
The baronet swung open the door and turned to speak to Blaire, when
the Inspector gave a sudden sharp ejaculation.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>Three heads snapped round. Three pairs of eyes followed his
riveted stare. Driven into the centre panel of the door was a
short-handled knife and pinned into position by the blade was a
piece of paper.</p>

<p>"Holy sinners! Read said softly. Atherton-Wayne's face was grey
marble, only his sensitive nostrils quivered as he breathed deeply.
Blackburn was first to move; he flicked a handkerchief from his
pocket and, stepping forward, wrapped it around the knife-handle
and jerked. The blade came out easily. The paper fluttered to the
floor. Inspector Read stooped to pick it up, but with a sudden
movement like the uncoiling of a spring, Atherton-Wayne was before
him. Holding the paper delicately between forefinger and thumb, he
read the words scrawled upon it. Read and Blackburn shouldered him
on either side, then the Inspector spoke without turning.</p>

<p>"A message for you, Blaire."</p>

<p>The chemist crossed the room, walking lightly, as a cat walks.
Behind the thick lenses his eyes were wary. Without a word, he took
the proffered paper and peered at it. The words were printed in
ink.</p>

<p><i>"I will call tomorrow night. Listen for the hooting of The
Owl."</i>
</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>"Listen for the hooting of The Owl."</p>

<p>Those ominous words, like some dark refrain, kept recurring in
Jeffery Blackburn's mind as he sat, drink in hand, on a divan in
the living-room of Edward Blaire's cottage. The time was almost ten
o'clock on the following night and the birthday party was in full
swing. Around a room stripped of rugs and denuded of as much
furniture as was convenient to move, a dozen young couples danced
to radio music from the Luxemburg station.</p>

<p>Across the room, Sir Anthony Atherton-Wayne stood by the
flower-decked sideboard, watching the festivities with grave,
thoughtful eyes. His secretary was dancing with a tall, dark-haired
beauty who chattered animatedly as they moved in time to the music.
Elizabeth Blaire was the centre of a group near the fireplace. It
seemed a high-spirited gathering, as gay as the coloured streamers
and balloons that decorated the room. But if the brightness was a
little forced, if the laughter was rather too shrill and the trips
to the improvised bar in the next room too frequent, Jeffery was
only too well aware of the reason. By shifting his position
slightly he could see out of the window, perceiving the sturdy
outlines of the uniformed figure, one of the chain of policemen
whom Inspector Read had placed on guard around the cottage.</p>

<p>"Listen for the hooting of The Owl."</p>

<p>Read and Blackburn had made the most of every minute which had
passed since the inexplicable receipt of that warning. Both men had
returned to the city, the Inspector to draft together a force of
men to carry out his instructions with regard to Blaire's safety;
Jeffery to collect and mentally digest every single piece of
information available regarding The Owl robberies. Both men had
returned to the Towers in time for lunch that day. The Inspector
had spent the afternoon instructing and arranging the picketing of
the cottage, while Jeffery, through Ashton, had obtained the
warning cards received by Blaire.</p>

<p>A hail broke into his troubled thoughts. He glanced up. Blaire,
piloting a young woman rather unsteadily around the room, passed
close to him. Jeffery nodded absently, his thoughts flying off at a
tangent. The young chemist's cheerful nonchalance did not deceive
him. At each lull in the merry-making, Jeffery had noticed Blaire's
surreptitious glances at his wrist-watch and the quick bird-like
movements of his head whenever a door opened suddenly. As the
evening advanced, the young man's drinking had accelerated. Now his
face was flushed and the thick lenses of his spectacles emphasized
the slight glaze over his eyes; but Jeffery knew that the pallid
worm of fear was coiled about the other's heart and it gnawed
deeper with the passing of every minute.</p>

<p>The dance music went on and on, and the couples circled and
dipped and circled again like mechanical mice. Jeffery felt a
certain sense of the grotesque. What sinister influence could
possibly strike in this decorated, music-filled room? Yet what of
the warning? That had surely come flying through the air from some
unknown hand. Its appearance could only mean that The Owl was
already in their midst. Blackburn scanned the fresh young laughing
faces and shook his head. Impossible! It was this waiting that
intensified the situation. If only something would happen...</p>

<p>"Not dancing, Mr. Blackburn?"</p>

<p>Jeffery gave a start that quivered the whisky in his glass.
Elizabeth Blaire was smiling down at him. The light gleamed on her
bare shoulders and sparkled in the tiny stars she wore in her brown
hair. Jeffery's dress shirt crackled as he rose.</p>

<p>"Aren't you?" he said.</p>

<p>Elizabeth wrinkled her nose. "I'm afraid to walk up to a man in
case he pulls out a police whistle. And you can't sit out in the
garden unless someone comes up and jangles handcuffs under your
nose.</p>

<p>"We're being cruel to be kind, you know."</p>

<p>"Poor Mr. Blackburn." She had lovely shoulders, Jeffery noticed,
and the simple white evening frock she wore showed them off to
advantage. "You know what I'm going to do? Find you some beautiful
lady all of your own."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Blaire. But I have already found one."</p>

<p>"Indeed? Where is she?"</p>

<p>"Standing close to me."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Elizabeth turned her head and looked round the room. "I
had promised the next dance to Sir Anthony&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who is old enough to know better," Jeffery told her. "While I
am young and simply aching to dance. Miss Blaire, your duty as a
hostess impels you."</p>

<p>The music came to an end. The couples drifted from the floor.
The girl shrugged. "Now, you see, we can't dance even if I had
decided to disappoint Sir Anthony. Let's sit down here."</p>

<p>They did so.</p>

<p>"Now," commanded Mr. Blackburn. "Talk to me."</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"Anything."</p>

<p>"H'm," Elizabeth considered. "How do you like the
decorations?"</p>

<p>"Excellent. That sideboard looks like a miniature jungle. Did
you do them?"</p>

<p>"With these toil-worn fingers."</p>

<p>There was a pause. A little group of couples were gathered
around the radio, twisting the dial in search of dance music. Sir
Anthony had left his place near the sideboard and had crossed to a
window, staring out into the dark garden. Edward Blaire,
temporarily deserted, roamed the floor restlessly. His sister
followed him with her eyes.</p>

<p>Jeffery said lightly: "There's a very worried little wrinkle
between your brows. Why the unpleasant thoughts?"</p>

<p>The girl's face cleared. "Speaks the detective!"</p>

<p>"It's that warning your brother received yesterday, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>She faced him now. Unconsciously, she placed one slim had on his
arm. "But it's so fantastic&mdash;it's like something out of
Hollywood. I keep saying to myself&mdash;such things just don't
happen to people like us."</p>

<p>Jeffery made no attempt to remove the hand. "The knife found in
that door was the cold steel of fact," he reminded her.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;but to happen to one's own brother!"</p>

<p>Jeffery's tone was gentle. "If I may say so, Miss Blaire, your
brother isn't actually going out of his way to prevent it
happening."</p>

<p>She nodded, her face very serious. "I know he's
stubborn&mdash;but Edward feels the same way about it as I
do&mdash;that it's too impossible to be real. You see, Mr.
Blackburn, so few things <i>are</i> real to my brother, things
outside his own scientific orbit, I mean." She became suddenly
aware of her hand on his arm and withdrew it with a quick movement.
"Any attempt to anchor him down to a world of realities irritates
him immensely."</p>

<p>"The artistic temperament, of course."</p>

<p>"Perhaps." A sudden coolness had crept into her tone. A thought
seemed to strike her; she glanced at her wrist-watch and rose
hastily. "Almost missed my surprise," she said, and crossed the
room to where the group was still playing with the radio set.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Blaire turned and clapped her hands. "Attention,
everybody, please!"</p>

<p>The conversation died and as all heads turned towards her the
girl whispered something to a young man at her side. He turned and
manipulated the knob of the set. The final strains of an organ solo
filtered into the room.</p>

<p>"Quiet, everybody!" Elizabeth called.</p>

<p>From his corner, her brother said thickly: "What's all this
about, sis?"</p>

<p>"You listen carefully."</p>

<p>The reedy music vibrated to a close. There was a few seconds'
pause, during which Elizabeth glanced across the room at Robert
Ashton and closed one eye significantly. Her fiancé raised his
eyebrows, then the voice of the announcer, brisk and brash, was
heard.</p>

<p>"We interrupt our programme to send a birthday call to Edward
Blaire...are you listening, Edward?...a birthday call to Edward
Blaire who is celebrating the occasion with a party at his
home."</p>

<p>The young chemist, who had been pouring himself a drink, gave an
ejaculation of anger and almost dropped his glass.</p>

<p>"What the devil...?" he snapped, but a dozen gleeful voices
quietened him.</p>

<p>"...and now if Edward will look in the centre drawer of the
sideboard in his living-room, he will find a nice present there. In
the centre drawer of the sideboard, and may we take this
opportunity of wishing you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Blaire had reeled across the room. With a vindictive flick of
his hand he snapped off the voice of the announcer. Face pale, eyes
glittering behind his glasses, he faced his guests. "Which one of
you is responsible for this damn' foolishness?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The dark-haired beauty at his side laughed. "Don't be such a
spoil-sport, Ted! Go and look in the sideboard drawer." And half a
dozen other voices took up the plea.</p>

<p>"Yes, go on, Blaire!"</p>

<p>"Take a look in the drawer."</p>

<p>"Go on, old man&mdash;don't spoil the joke."</p>

<p>Ashton called across the room: "Snap out of it, Edward. Where's
your sense of humour?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing wrong with my sense of humour," Blaire
returned. "But if you think I enjoy being humiliated from one end
of the country to the other&mdash;"</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne joined the discussion. The baronet's eyes were
twinkling and he looked more human than Blackburn had ever seen
him. "Really, my boy," he said smoothly, "I must confess I see
nothing to be annoyed about."</p>

<p>Blaire raised a face darkening with anger. "How would you feel
if you were in my position?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The baronet flicked something from his coat. "I should feel
overwhelmingly curious as to what that drawer contained." There was
a general laugh that contained a certain amount of sycophancy and
was a subtle comment on the young chemist's churlishness. Blaire
sensed it. His weak mouth set stubbornly.</p>

<p>"It's a pretty good joke, isn't it?" He addressed the room at
large. "Well, here's where it falls flat. For all I care, whatever
is in that drawer can stay there till it rots. Come on, get some
dance music on that thing and let's get on with the party."</p>

<p>The childish ill temper in his voice was more than enough to
cancel out his invitation. No one moved. In the embarrassed silence
that followed, Elizabeth gave a little sigh. "All right," the girl
strove to keep her voice light, "I'll own up. I arranged for that
call to be put over, Edward."</p>

<p>"Thank you for nothing."</p>

<p>His sister ignored the comment. "I'll get the present myself,"
she said levelly. "I'm sorry if all this has upset you. I might
have known better."</p>

<p>A light-hearted jest had assumed the proportions of a major
issue. All eyes followed the girl as she crossed the room towards
the flower-decked sideboard. She was reaching her hand for the
centre drawer when a command snapped through the waiting room like
the crack of a whiplash.</p>

<p><i>"Stop!"</i>
</p>

<p>Blackburn was striding towards the sideboard, his eyes blazing.
He thrust himself in front of the girl and brushed her hand down
from the drawer. Atherton-Wayne gave an ejaculation and it was
repeated in little stifled echoes of amazement from everywhere
about the room. Robert Ashton pulled his hands from his pockets and
squared his shoulders as Blackburn wheeled on him. "I noticed a
walking-stick hanging in the hall," he snapped. "A walking-stick
with a crooked handle. Get it for me." The urgency in his voice had
the crispness of a command. Ashton obeyed without a word.
Returning, he handed the stick across. Jeffery grasped it by one
end, backed a pace and crooked the handle about the knob of the
drawer.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul&mdash;" began Atherton-Wayne.</p>

<p>"Stand back!" Jeffery rapped. "Right back behind
me&mdash;everyone&mdash;please!" He waited until the shuffling
ceased. "Now&mdash;<i>watch!</i>"</p>

<p>Standing off at an angle, he gave the stick a sharp tug. The
drawer slid open and a sharp report echoed through the room.
Simultaneously, there was a crash and a picture on the opposite
wall slid to the floor, the glass splintering over the polished
boards.</p>

<p>"Blackburn!" whispered Blaire. He was starling at Jeffery as
though hypnotized, his loose mouth working. Sobered now, he bent
down and retrieved the picture. Near the centre of the canvas was a
small ragged hole.</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" His voice was cracked, dry with fear.
"What&mdash;what does this mean?"</p>

<p>Blackburn was fumbling among the profusion of blossoms on the
sideboard, sweeping them aside with ruthless hands. "Look," he
invited. Spliced with twine to one of the supports was a small
pistol, and from the trigger a line of thin piano wire was
connected with the drawer. Jeffery turned to the hushed
assembly.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven I recognized that piano wire in time," he
muttered. He looked at Elizabeth. "I noticed the light glinting on
it when we were talking about the flowers. But for the life of me I
couldn't make out what it was. It was only when you started for the
drawer that I realized." He jerked his head towards the weapon.
"Notice how the pistol is set breast high? There wasn't the
slightest chance in the world of it missing if a person opened that
drawer in the normal way."</p>

<p>Elizabeth gave a little shudder. "You&mdash;you saved my life."
Her voice was very small. She seemed almost convincing herself of a
fact. "Yes, you saved my life."</p>

<p>Edward Blaire tried to speak, swallowed and tried again.
"That&mdash;" he began, "that was meant for me?"</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne produced a handkerchief from his sleeve and
patted a forehead dewed with perspiration. He coughed. "You realize
what this means, Blackburn? The Owl set that devilish trap! That
means, in spite of all your precautions, somehow the criminal got
inside this room."</p>

<p>Ashton, balancing his stocky body, glanced quickly from face to
face. "Then how did he get out again?"</p>

<p>"He didn't get out." Blackburn walked with slow deliberation to
the door and set his back against it. "It's impossible for any
living human being to get through that cordon of police outside. Do
you realize what this means? The Owl is still here&mdash;hiding
somewhere between these walls And we're going to dig him out if it
means taking this cottage apart...brick by brick!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>CHAPTER THREE. "There were curious
bloodstains on the curtains and on the floor..."</h2>

<h3>SATURDAY, JUNE 15TH.</h3>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The grey-faced clock in the tower had scarcely chimed the hour
of ten on the following morning when Elizabeth Blaire, a frown
between her eyes and her soft mouth firm, walked resolutely down
one of the corridors of Rookwood Towers. She paused outside a door
and knocked sharply on the stout oak.</p>

<p>There was no answer. She knocked again. This time a sulky voice
cried from within:</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>"You know very well who it is!" The girl's tone was sharp with
irritation. "Let me in, Ted!"</p>

<p>A muffled grunt answered her. Then the lock clicked and the door
swung back. A tousled heavy-eyed figure, still half-dressed in
clothes of the previous night, faced her. Edward Blaire's face was
as white as the crushed dress shirt beneath it. His sister drew a
quick breath as the reek of stale whisky caught her nostrils.</p>

<p>"Ted! After what you promised me...!"</p>

<p>She advanced two steps into the room, closing the door behind
her. Anger had hoisted scarlet danger signals in her pale cheeks
and her eyes were bright and hard. "So this explains why you
refused to sleep alone in your cottage last night&mdash;why you
came over here! And why you haven't been down to breakfast this
morning. Ted, I'm ashamed of you!"</p>

<p>Blaire gave a surly chuckle that ended in an abrupt hiccough.
"What if I did? What right have you to question me? I'm not a
child!"</p>

<p>Elizabeth said quietly: "You are a child, Ted. A very frightened
child."</p>

<p>Her brother stared, blinking in an effort to focus his eyes.
Then, abruptly, he collapsed on to the bed, burying his face in his
hands. With a sudden pitying fear, the girl saw that he trembled
from head to foot. In a moment she was by his side, one arm round
his shoulders, steadying the trembling body against her own.</p>

<p>"Now, now, Ted..." her tone was gentle.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'm scared. And why not?" Her brother spoke through his
fingers and Elizabeth sensed that he was unwilling that she should
look upon his face. "When&mdash;when I think of the escape I had
last night, I&mdash;I go all to pieces. Now, go on, laugh at me if
you like!"</p>

<p>Elizabeth said quietly: "I'm not laughing, Ted." She tightened
her arm around his body. "It isn't as bad as it seems, old man.
Remember, you have all the resources of Scotland Yard for your
protection."</p>

<p>"Protection!" Blaire raised his head. "And a fine job Scotland
Yard made of it last night! Every copper in the Metropolitan area
down here&mdash;and for all the good they were, they might as well
have stayed on their beats. Don't talk to me about your precious
police force!"</p>

<p>Something ugly in his tone stirred Elizabeth's anger afresh. "At
least," she said sharply, "they're doing something better than
cowering behind locked doors swilling whisky!"</p>

<p>Blaire leapt to his feet, tossing away her arm. "Oh, leave me
alone, can't you?" His voice was shrill, tinged with hysteria. "Why
does all this have to happen to me? I wish to God I'd never found
that damnable formula in the first place!" He wheeled on the girl,
his face working. "My life isn't worth living! Do you know why I
didn't come down to breakfast? Because I'm afraid to eat my food in
case it's poisoned. Yes, poisoned! Why do I lock my door? Because
I'm afraid that if I sleep I'll&mdash;I'll never wake up again. And
you, my own sister&mdash;the one who should understand me best of
all&mdash;you come here and preach at me like a Temperance
tract!"</p>

<p>Elizabeth rose. The naked terror of this man had shaken her more
than she realized, and it was with an effort that she kept her
voice level. "Sit down, Ted." She took her brother by the arm and
led him to a chair. There was a silence. Then Blaire spoke again,
his tone an apology.</p>

<p>"Sorry, sis." It was a sheepish mumble. "No sleep...nerves shot
to pieces..."</p>

<p>Elizabeth nodded. "That's what I'm afraid of, old man." And as
her brother glanced up, she continued: "Can't you understand that's
just what this Owl creature wants to do? He's out to break your
nerve until sheer terror forces you to give up your formula."</p>

<p>"But what can I do?"</p>

<p>"Here's my advice, Ted. Give that Dutch courage a wide berth,
and stop brooding on that yellow press sensationalism. Get it
firmly into your head that this Owl criminal is human&mdash;and
being human he can't do the impossible."</p>

<p>Blaire licked his lips. "I&mdash;I wouldn't be too sure,
Betty."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think he came back here...early this morning."</p>

<p>"Ted!"</p>

<p>Her brother shrugged. "I know it sounds fantastic. Now that it's
morning, with the sun shining, I can't quite believe it myself. But
I'll swear that, sometime before dawn, I&mdash;I heard him." His
voice dropped a note, darkened. "I think I even saw him."</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;at the Towers&mdash;early this morning?"</p>

<p>Blaire nodded.</p>

<p>"I went to bed shortly after midnight." His voice was low. "I
couldn't sleep&mdash;it was the excitement of the party, I suppose.
So I had a few drinks." An exclamation escaped from his sister's
lips and he added quickly: "Only to make me sleep, sis&mdash;to
forget. Then I laid down on the bed. I must have fallen into a
doze, for the last thing I remembered was the moon shining through
this window on to the floor. And somewhere in the house I heard a
clock strike once. A few moments later, the tower clock echoed the
chime..."</p>

<p>He paused, his hands clasped, his eyes on the floor. Elizabeth
prompted gently: "Yes?"</p>

<p>"I slept badly&mdash;had horrible, disconnected dreams.
Creatures with the bodies of men and the heads of birds watched me
as I stumbled through a dark wood. There was all about me a
terrible silence, the silence of death. That's why the hooting,
when it did come, sounded all the more terrible. I gave a start and
woke up, to find myself sweating with fear and trembling."</p>

<p>Elizabeth's tone was soothing. "It was a dream, old boy&mdash;a
nightmare."</p>

<p>"No." Blaire's voice was as sombre as the shadows that still
clung to the corners of the room. "That's what I thought&mdash;at
first. Then I heard that hooting again, and I'll swear I was wide
awake this time. And as I turned on the bed I noticed that the
patch of moonlight had gone from the floor. Instinctively I turned
and looked at the window..."</p>

<p>Elizabeth Blaire's fingers tightened on her brother's arm, but
she did not speak. The young man licked his lips. "There was
someone&mdash;or something standing there, staring in at me.
Something in a long black cloak that stretched like wings to block
out the moonlight. I tried to cry out, but my voice seemed rusty,
useless. And even as I stared back the shadow slipped from the
window and was gone. The moonlight shone through, splashing on to
the floor." His voice rose hysterically. "He was there,
sis&mdash;waiting for me! I saw him!"</p>

<p>The girl rose and, crossing to the decanter on the table by the
tall cupboard, poured a stiff drink. She returned and pressed the
glass into her brother's hand. She could hear the rim of the glass
clatter against his teeth as he gulped the fiery spirit. He drew a
deep breath.</p>

<p>"I needed that, sis. You're a great scout, you know."</p>

<p>Elizabeth took the glass and turned it over in her fingers. She
said slowly, as if considering: "If you did actually see that
figure at the window, then The Owl knows this house quite
well."</p>

<p>Blaire nodded. "You mean it must be someone under this
roof?"</p>

<p>His sister shrugged. "We must face facts, Ted. Only three people
besides yourself knew of the formula. Sir Anthony, Bob and
myself."</p>

<p>The young man rose to his feet. He crossed and took down a
dressing-gown from behind the door. He spoke without turning:</p>

<p>"That's not quite right."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Blaire's restless fingers were busy with the strings of his
dressing-gown. "When I said you three were the only people who knew
of the discovery&mdash;I meant, in England."</p>

<p>"Ted! You haven't told anyone else?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" He swung round on her, face sullen, mouth mutinous.
"The formula is mine. I've a perfect right to do what I please with
it. If you must know, I wrote to a friend of mine&mdash;a chap I
met when I was studying in Vienna. He's a high official in one of
the Balkan Governments now. I told about the formula&mdash;said it
was on sale to the highest bidder."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Elizabeth was silent, striving to quell the bitter words
of censure that rose to her lips. After a pause, she said quietly,
"When did this happen?"</p>

<p>"A few days after the discovery," Blaire told her. "I told you
how Atherton-Wayne demanded the formula under the terms of our
agreement. I refused to give it up, saying that the formula was on
sale for twenty-five thousand pounds. He laughed at
me&mdash;laughed in my face, Betsy!" He turned away. "Naturally I
went in search of another bidder."</p>

<p>Elizabeth rose. "Do you realize that what you've done
practically amounts to treason?"</p>

<p>Her brother essayed a shaky laugh. "Rot! Atherton-Wayne's been
doing just the same thing for years in his armament business."</p>

<p>"That's no excuse&mdash;"</p>

<p>Edward Blaire wheeled on her and something in his face made the
girl shrink back. "Perhaps not. But here's my excuse. I've never
known luxury&mdash;all our lives we've been poor. I've had to
struggle and fight for every single thing I've got." He began to
pace the room, his hands flying. "Do you think I liked it? Do you
think I've swotted over books and choked myself with stinking
chemicals for the love of it? Well, I haven't! Not me! I've worked
and studied, praying for the day when I could make a discovery
valuable enough to keep me in comfort for the rest of my life." He
paused and faced her, his eyes blazing. "Now, I've done it! I've
found that discovery! And, by God, I'm going to make it pay me
well!"</p>

<p>Elizabeth, her face pale, was staring as though hypnotized by
his sudden passion. The tension in the room tightened like a
stretched band. It was the girl who cracked first. She gave a
choking sob and reached blindly for the door. Her brother, his
mouth working, heard the sound of her footsteps, quick with panic,
echo down the long corridor and die in the distance.</p>

<p>He gave a shaky laugh, kicked the door shut and crossed to the
table by the tall cupboard.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>An hour later, Ashton, a dozen opened letters in his hand,
knocked on the door of the library and let himself in. Sir Anthony,
seated at a desk under the long windows, spoke without turning.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Ashton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir Anthony.</p>

<p>"You're rather late, I think."</p>

<p>The secretary placed the letters at his employer's elbow. He
spoke as he pulled up a chair. "I know, sir. I looked for you in
the study. Mrs. Tamworth told me you were in the library."</p>

<p>The baronet accepted the explanation with a curt nod and took up
the letters. "Anything of importance here?"</p>

<p>"There is a directors' meeting next Thursday morning, sir. They
would like you to be present. I have made a note of it. There's an
acknowledgement of your cheque for the Allied Women's Peace
Movement&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Is that all?"</p>

<p>"There is a letter from Lord Dewhurst which needs your
attention, sir."</p>

<p>Sir Anthony raised his eyes. "Dewhurst&mdash;what does he
want?"</p>

<p>"It's written from Buenos Aires," the secretary explained. "Lord
Dewhurst is staying there. A friend of his&mdash;Dr. Hautmann, I
think the name is&mdash;happens to be visiting London with his
daughter. Lord Dewhurst writes that he'd appreciate any hospitality
you could show these people."</p>

<p>"H'm." Atherton-Wayne's tone was non-committal. "When are these
people expected to arrive?"</p>

<p>"The letter mentioned the fourth. That would be yesterday." The
secretary paused, but as the baronet made no comment, he continued:
"Shall I ask Mrs. Tamworth to have rooms prepared, sir?"</p>

<p>Sir Anthony turned and faced Ashton in that politely vague
manner which always irritated the young man. It was always as
though his presence was a mild shock to the baronet. "Yes, yes.
Attend to that, my boy. Is there anything else?"</p>

<p>"That's all, sir."</p>

<p>"Then you might bring over the chess set." The secretary nodded,
and crossing to a cupboard returned with an inlaid box which he
placed before the elder man. Atherton-Wayne opened it and began to
extract the ivory chess-men. "I evolved a rather, intriguing
problem during the night. I should like to test it." His long
delicate fingers were placing the carved figures carefully on the
board. "You don't play chess, of course, Ashton?"</p>

<p>The young man squared his shoulders. "No, sir. I pref something
more strenuous."</p>

<p>"The cultivation of muscle rather than of mind?"</p>

<p>The gentle irony in the tone stung Ashton and for a moment the
man peered out from behind the servile cloak of the secretary.
"It's just as easy to be fit as otherwise," he said rather
sharply.</p>

<p>"I'd be willing to tackle any man my own weight with or without
gloves. And as for that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, of course." The tone had all the shock of cold
water. "This problem may require all
my&mdash;er&mdash;concentration." The sleek grey head looked up and
two steel-blue eyes fixed on the young man. "Would you see that I
am not disturbed?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne pulled his chair closer to the desk, a gesture of
dismissal. Robert Ashton eyed him for a brief second, then wheeled
and walked out of the library.</p>

<p>The baronet rubbed his hands and bent his head over the board.
From outside the open window came the comfortable hum of an
electric lawn mower and the sweet scent of newly cut grass floated
into that sombre book-lined room. Some distance away a dog barked,
to be answered by another. Rooks were busy in the spreading elms
that shadowed the lawn. But to the man in the library all this was
but a harmonious background for the pattern of his thoughts as they
spun smoothly about the problem beneath his fingers.
Intermittently, he moved or sat in thoughtful silence, tapping his
lips in ecstatic perplexity. The whole thing was plainer now. With
this one last move...The baronet tapped his finger-tips together in
mild excitement.</p>

<p>"Now," he murmured. "Knight in four...bishop... queen...rook.
So...so...! Now, if I move my bishop...? No, not that! Perhaps the
knight&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Why not," announced a bright voice by the window, "move your
queen?"</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne started as though galvanized. Standing in the
open window, looking down at the board with undisguised interest,
was Mr. Blackburn. The baronet said softly: "God bless my
soul!"</p>

<p>"So sorry to startle you, sir." Jeffery smiled winningly and
advanced into the library. "But chess happens to be an obsession of
mine. I noticed your placings&mdash;and as the window happened to
be open...I hope I haven't disturbed you?"</p>

<p>"Disturbed me!" Surprise had given way to a cold-blooded anger.
"Confound you, sir, am I to have no privacy in my own house?" In
the baronet's grey cheeks, two flushed spots appeared and his small
eyes glittered. "Do you realize what you've done? Put the moves
completely out of my head&mdash;and just when I am concluding a
particularly interesting variation of the Maroczy
gambit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you'll never make it with your knight in four, sir,"
Jeffery announced cheerfully. "Allow me." He reached a hand over
the chess-board. "Now, watch! Knight...knight-pawn...knight...black
pawn...rook! And the result?"</p>

<p>"Fool's Mate!"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Jeffery removed the captured men from the board and
dropped them into the astonished baronet's hand. "And there you
are."</p>

<p>Into Atherton-Wayne's face something approaching the light of
admiration had dawned. "Extraordinary, Blackburn! Most
extraordinary! However did you learn to play so well?"</p>

<p>Jeffery dropped his long body into a chair and lit a cigarette.
"I always remember Plattner's advice, Sir Anthony. Foresight,
circumspection and caution. Those three points have helped me out
of many a tight corner. And,"&mdash;he cocked an eyebrow at the
elder man&mdash;"not only on a chess-board."</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne leaned back in his chair and crossed his legs.
There was an expression on his face that the young man could not
quite understand. His voice was that of the suave diplomat. "You
are apparently a most versatile young man.
Mathematician&mdash;detective&mdash;chess player." He linked long
fingers on his lap. "Anything else?"</p>

<p>Jeffery sat upright. "At the moment&mdash;Nosy Parker!"</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"I'm on the trail of some information about this house. You
see," explained Mr. Blackburn, "I'm not one of these blighters who
can look at a heap of mouldering ruins and say, 'Ah! ten-sixty-six
and all that!' Frankly, I can barely tell the difference between a
Gothic arch and a Queen Anne bungalow."</p>

<p>A wintry smile lingered about Atherton-Wayne's thin lips. "If I
can help in any way..." he suggested.</p>

<p>"When was Rookwood Towers built, sir?"</p>

<p>"Somewhere about the year sixteen-hundred, I believe," was the
reply. "During the reign of the first James. It is supposed to have
been built by Thomas Howard, first Earl of Suffolk, who was Lord
Treasurer to James the First."</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded. "And the cottage that Mr. Blaire occupies would
be roughly the same age as the house, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"That is so," the baronet assured him; "they were both built at
the same time. There is some sort of legend to the effect that
Howard fell into disgrace with James for hiding the Earl of Gowrie
in the cottage after he had carried off the boy king, James the
Sixth. The king's nobles surrounded the cottage, but when they
forced an entrance, Ruthven had disappeared."</p>

<p>Blackburn dusted his cigarette in the silver ashtray at his
elbow. "How did that happen?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea," Atherton-Wayne admitted. "Nevertheless, this
story has given rise to some tale about a secret passage connecting
this house with the cottage." The baronet shrugged. "It's quite
possible, of course. The place is old enough."</p>

<p>"Haven't you ever searched for the passage?"</p>

<p>The elder man took out a silver case, extracted a cigarette and
tapped it delicately. "My dear Blackburn," he said gently, "when
you reach my age, you find more dignified recreations than crawling
about on your hands and knees, tapping woodwork like the hero of a
melodrama. I consider the whole thing merely a romantic
legend&mdash;particularly after what happened some months ago..."
He paused to light his cigarette.</p>

<p>"I was foolish enough to allow myself to be prevailed upon to
throw my house open to a party of antiquarian gentlemen who had
heard of the legend. They went about testing every floor and wall
and after some days of making my life almost intolerable, departed
no wiser than when they came."</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded and rose. "Thank you, sir. You've been most
helpful. And if there's anything I can do in return...?"</p>

<p>The baronet's eyes moved to the chess-board. "I'm intensely
curious regarding those moves of the Maroczy gambit. Perhaps, if
you have half an hour to spare this afternoon...?"</p>

<p>Mr. Blackburn nodded. "At your service. Shall we say
here&mdash;at three o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Very well." The elder man hesitated. "Er&mdash;Blackburn, where
actually did I go wrong?"</p>

<p>Jeffery had moved to the door. He paused in the act of opening
it. "You gave away far too much at the beginning of the game, sir,"
he said. "It always pays to keep a few surprise moves up your
sleeve. Understand what I mean?"</p>

<p>Sir Anthony's voice was very quiet. "I think I am just beginning
to understand."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>A half-smoked cigarette between his lips, hands thrust into his
pockets, Mr. Blackburn sauntered along the corridor from the
library. As he passed a closed door, the muffled rattle of a
typewriter caught his attention. He paused, hovered irresolutely
for a moment, then, stamping out his cigarette, turned and rapped
on the panels.</p>

<p>The typewriter ceased. Ashton's voice called, "Come in."</p>

<p>Jeffery did so, closing the door behind him. "Am I intruding?"
he inquired.</p>

<p>"No." The secretary pushed the typewriter to one side.</p>

<p>"Pull up a chair." And as Jeffery seated himself, "What's the
matter?"</p>

<p>"How did you come to be a secretary?"</p>

<p>Ashton frowned, but the other's face was guileless. "What's
this?" he said shortly. "Cross-examination or curiosity?"</p>

<p>"More vulgar curiosity," Jeffery assured him. "Didn't you play
rugger for England against Australia a couple of years, ago?"</p>

<p>The secretary's face lightened. "Fancy you remembering that!"
Then he grinned. "So that's the reason for the question?"</p>

<p>The other shrugged. "When one sees a hefty young athlete who
turns the scale at fourteen stone sitting picking away at a
typewriter&mdash;"</p>

<p>Robert Ashton jumped to his feet with a suddenness that set the
chair rocking. "For God's sake, Blackburn," he exclaimed, "do you
think I like it? Do you think I enjoy sitting around and nodding
and sir-ing like a scullery maid?" He spread his big hands
helplessly. "But what else am I to do? Forget professional
sport&mdash;a torn ligament in my shoulder's put that right out of
the running. Fortunately, I went to a good school that taught me
something else beside athletics. And so&mdash;here I am, picking at
a typewriter."</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded, his eyes sombre. "Bad luck, old man."</p>

<p>Ashton dragged his chair forward and straddled it. "I shouldn't
grumble, I suppose. It's a job, after all. But what I'd give for
one blazin' night of excitement&mdash;one chance to let off
steam!"</p>

<p>The other seemed to be considering a point. Presently he looked
up.</p>

<p>"Keep yourself pretty fit, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Matter of habit," Robert grunted. "Otherwise, in this kind of
job, I'd swell up like a balloon." He paused and eyed his companion
keenly. "I say, what's behind all this?"</p>

<p>Blackburn leaned forward. "Tonight," he said crisply, "I'm going
exploring. I need a companion. The Chief Inspector won't be on
tap&mdash;he's going up to headquarters this afternoon. How would
you like to come with me?"</p>

<p>"Like a shot! What's the idea?"</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about a secret passage in this house?"</p>

<p>The secretary replied promptly: "There's a sort of tunnel
leading from the ruined lodge house inside the gates. But that's no
secret."</p>

<p>Jeffery shook his head. "A few minutes ago, I learnt that a
secret passage was supposed to connect this house with young
Blaire's cottage."</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" Ashton dismissed it with a gesture. "Good lord,
Blackburn, surely you're not taking that old legend about the Earl
of Suffolk too seriously?"</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>Robert shrugged his big shoulders. "Because it's nothing more
than a story that's grown up round this place. Every old place has
its fairy tale. Ours happens to be that passage. I suppose
Atherton-Wayne told you about it?"</p>

<p>"That's so."</p>

<p>"Did he tell you about that party of antiquarians?"&mdash;and as
Jeffery nodded: "Then you think two of us poking about in the dark
are likely to succeed where these other chaps failed? It seems
rather absurd."</p>

<p>Mr. Blackburn had his own way of dealing with the situation. He
said casually:</p>

<p>"Perhaps, on second thoughts, you'd better not come. Sir Anthony
might not approve..."</p>

<p>Ashton flushed. "What's it got to do with him what I do in my
spare time?" he demanded. "I'll come with you."</p>

<p>"Splendid!" Jeffery stood up. "Meet me at the gate in the hedge
at ten o'clock. Is that all right?"</p>

<p>Robert Ashton nodded. "Quite all right."</p>

<p>But little did both men realize what was in store for them. It
is indeed a merciful Providence that has shrouded the future from
human eyes.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Patience was not the strongest of Mr. Blackburn's virtues. To
sit with folded hands was anathema to his lively mind and restless
body. The excitement of the previous night had wetted his appetite
and the proposal to search for the supposed secret passage was more
an outlet for this energy than a step in unmasking The Owl. That
there was danger lurking within the stout walls of Rookwood Towers
Jeffery did not doubt for an instant, especially as Elizabeth had
confided to him her brother's story of the midnight visitor and
Edward's foolish betrayal regarding the precious formula.</p>

<p>Although he would admit it to no one but himself, Jeffery was,
for the moment, at a loss. So carefully had The Owl covered his
tracks after the cowardly attempt on Blaire's life that any further
investigation along that line seemed fruitless. Until Read returned
from Scotland Yard, there seemed nothing to do but wait for the
second visitation, though the consequent inaction was as gall and
wormwood to the young man's soul. On the other hand, he dare not
relax his vigil at the Towers. The Owl's bravado was
amazing&mdash;not only had he warned, but he had actually essayed
an attempt at striking. If Scotland Yard was caught unprepared a
second time, the resultant scandal would spell finish for William
Jamison Read. Jeffery realized that his friend was becoming more
and more reliant on his help and, under the circumstances, the
responsibility was not pleasant.</p>

<p>It was a very worried young man who strode through the dark belt
of trees towards the cottage.</p>

<p>It was rather eerie under the trees. The night was warm and
still, so that even the soft whispering in the branches had ceased.
His feet rustled on the dry leaves as he walked. He picked his way
among the sturdy trunks, distinguishable only as heavy black masses
from the shadowy walls that hemmed him in. Once, a sudden rapid
patter on the dry carpet set his heart pounding and caught the
breath in his throat. A rabbit, of course! This place was alive
with them. He squared his shoulders and walked on, the scurry of
his footsteps giving queer comfort. But Jeffery was glad when he
emerged from that dark barrier and saw the moonlight silvering the
roof of the cottage. At that moment, the clock in the tower struck
the three-quarter hour. The young man paused and, cupping his hand
round the luminous dial of his watch, grunted:</p>

<p>"I'm early!"</p>

<p>Even so, Robert Ashton was waiting. The creak of a gate reached
Jeffery's ears and the stocky figure of the secretary came through,
peering left and right. He spied Blackburn at once.</p>

<p>"Been waiting long?" Jeffery greeted him.</p>

<p>"Five minutes." Ashton glanced towards the cottage. "You think
it's better we start at this end?"</p>

<p>"Much better. We couldn't work at the Towers without being
disturbed. But the cottage is empty." Blackburn swung open the gate
and began to usher his companion through. "It's going to be a long
job, I fear. We're hunting for a needle in..." The words died on
his lips. Jeffery stood stock-still, his hand still on the gate.
Ashton looked up sharply. "What's the matter?"</p>

<p>For answer, Jeffery thrust out an arm and pushed him back
against the hedge. His voice was a whisper. "Thank heaven we
decided to come early! Look&mdash;the centre window."</p>

<p>Ashton gave a soft ejaculation of surprise. Crawling unsteadily
across the panes of the window, a circular disc of light hovered,
flashed and disappeared. The secretary's tone trembled with
repressed excitement. "Someone in there&mdash;that was a beam from
a torch!" He stared at the dark window for an instant, then:
"What's he up to?"</p>

<p>"Monkey business," grunted Blackburn. "Otherwise, he'd turn on
the cottage lights." He glanced sideways at his companion. "How's
the old rugger tackle?"</p>

<p>"Good as new."</p>

<p>"Right! We'll tackle this blighter as he comes out&mdash;"
Jeffery broke off as the soft click of a lock caught their ears.
"Keep back&mdash;here he comes now."</p>

<p>They pressed close in to the hedge. Quiet cautious footsteps
sounded on the flagged pavement. Blackburn, his eye aligned with a
gap in the greenery, caught a glimpse of a tall straight figure, a
dark cloak streaming behind him. The face was an indeterminate
patch of grey bisected by the shadow of the hat rim. The figure
passed from eye level and the footsteps were closer. There came the
soft creak of the gate.</p>

<p>"Now!" roared Jeffery, and hurled himself forward.</p>

<p>But Ashton was a shade faster. Fourteen stone projected itself
at the stranger's legs. The cloaked man went down with a throaty
grunt and the two figures, an inextricable whirlwind of arms and
legs, rolled over and over. Suddenly they were still. Ashton rose,
brushing leaves and earth from his coat. The stranger lay where he
had fallen, limp as a bag of wash.</p>

<p>"Must have winded the chap," muttered the secretary. He was
breathing heavily. "Guess I put a bit too much weight behind it."
He stared down at the fallen man. "Who is he, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know?" And as Robert shook his head, Jeffery bent
over the unconscious stranger. The moonlight illuminated his
features, an arrogant beak of a nose set in a thin, pale face,
surmounted with greying, close-cropped hair. Jeffery pulled aside
the cloak that had fallen across the man's body and revealed a
well-cut but sadly dishevelled suit of some dark material. He was
still staring at the stranger when an ejaculation from his
companion made him turn.</p>

<p>Ashton was picking an object off the ground. Now he turned with
it in his hand. "Wallet," he said briefly. "Must have fallen from
his pocket in the dust-up. This might tell us something."</p>

<p>Blackburn, still on his knees by the fallen man, took the wallet
and peered inside. He extracted a card and screwed his eyes over
it. But the small print defied him. "Let's have a light," he
snapped. The secretary fumbled for matches and struck one with
clumsy fingers. The tiny flame stained the pasteboard a dull lemon
and Jeffery slanted the card closer to the light.</p>

<p>"Heinrich Hautmann..."</p>

<p>The secretary gave a start that almost extinguished the match.
"Who?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Heinrich Hautmann&mdash;Buenos Aires." Jeffery glanced up
sharply. "What's the matter?"</p>

<p>Robert Ashton was staring at the unconscious man with dropping
jaw. "Dr. Hautmann&mdash;oh, my aunt! This is where the balloon
goes up!"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The little village of Tilling sprawls raggedly across the slope
of the downs a few miles from Rookwood Towers. It is a typical
corner of England; the neighbourly cottages, the smithy, store and
post-office straggle along the white road curving like a flung rope
through the green valley. On the fringe of this handful of
dwellings stands the "Green Man," heavily tiled and creeper-clad,
built of local materials and weathered to a fine hue.</p>

<p>It was mid-morning, two days after the encounter with the
unfortunate Dr. Hautmann, when Jeffery Blackburn pushed open the
swing doors of the inn. He almost collided with Elizabeth Blaire.
The girl stopped short, her face puckering with surprise.</p>

<p>"Mr. Blackburn!"</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss Blaire." Jeffery raised his hat. "Come to
see me?"</p>

<p>"I thought you were in London," Elizabeth responded. "Are you
staying here?"</p>

<p>"I am." Jeffery waved an expressive hand to the landscape. "And
why not? Could the metropolis give me anything like this? 'Ye
distant spires, ye antique towers,' as Thomas Grey sings..."</p>

<p>"Poetic evasion," said Miss Blaire, "doesn't explain why you're
hiding away at the 'Green Man.'"</p>

<p>Blackburn placed his hand lightly on her arm and piloted the
girl towards a wooden seat in the tiny strip of garden outside the
inn. "Be seated," he commanded, "and have a cigarette." He sat
beside her as they lit up. "You know all about my sudden exodus
from the Towers, of course?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded. "Bob told me."</p>

<p>"It's true," admitted Jeffery. "I was metaphorically lifted from
the grounds on the toe of Sir Anthony's expensive shoe. After the
little fracas near the cottage, Ashton and I were ordered to the
library. Atherton-Wayne made a few pungent remarks about turning
his home into a barracks and acting like a drunken sailor, with the
result that here I am."</p>

<p>Elizabeth smiled. "Too bad!"</p>

<p>Jeffery looked pained. "Spare me your mirth. You behold in me a
man without a country. The bird of the air has his nest, the beasts
their humble lair, but I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why don't you go back to London?"</p>

<p>Mr. Blackburn repressed a shudder. "There's another shoe waiting
for me there. A size ten belonging to the Chief Inspector&mdash;and
believe me, there's nothing metaphorical about that one."</p>

<p>Elizabeth shrugged. "Well, young man, if you creep about in the
dead of night man-handling your host's respected guests, what else
can you expect?"</p>

<p>"How was I to know it was this confounded doctor," demanded
Jeffery not without heat. "Anyhow, what was he doing sneaking
around in your brother's cottage that night?"</p>

<p>"Says he lost his way in the darkness."</p>

<p>"And I say Aunt Mary's fruit-hat!" snorted Blackburn. He dropped
his half-smoked cigarette and set his foot on it. "Atherton-Wayne
might swallow that story, but not this vinegar-souled cynic! People
don't lose their way to the extent of getting inside a strange
house and prowling round with a lighted torch."</p>

<p>There was a pause. A small grimy-faced child poked its head over
the low wall separating the garden from the road, surveyed them
gravely for a moment, then disappeared. Elizabeth was silent,
staring out across the green downs, rolling mound upon mound to the
far horizon. Presently she spoke:</p>

<p>"Jeffery..."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>Again that pause. This was the first time she had called him by
his Christian name, but she did not appear to have noticed it.
There was a worried little frown between her eyes.</p>

<p>"Do you think Dr. Hautmann has something to do with this Owl
business?"</p>

<p>"That," said Blackburn, "remains to be seen. How are things at
the Towers?"</p>

<p>"Quite normal. Sir Anthony seems to think that the danger is
past."</p>

<p>"No." Elizabeth turned. Gone was her companion's flippancy, now
his young face was set. "Don't think I'm an alarmist, but I'd
advise your brother to be doubly careful now." He shook his head
slowly. "This looks to me dangerously like the lull before the
storm."</p>

<p>"So that's why you came here to stay instead of returning to
London?"</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded. "The Chief Inspector sent me down to the Towers
to keep an eye on your brother. Somebody has manoeuvred to get me
out of that house." His voice slowed. "Unless I'm very much
mistaken, somebody is going to take advantage of my absence."</p>

<p>"Jeffery!"</p>

<p>He shrugged. "There's a gift of prophecy on me today. I tell you
this. Something is going to happen in that house before tomorrow
morning."</p>

<p>Elizabeth was staring at him, her blue eyes shadowed. The shadow
lay across her voice when she spoke. "What kind of thing?"</p>

<p>"I don't know." Blackburn's gesture and tone held an irritable
frustration. "That's the very devil of it! I've never worked on a
case like this before. It's this confounded waiting...waiting! And
there are so many loose ends, One instance&mdash;who and what is
Dr. Heinrich Hautmann?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head. "I only know what Bob told
me&mdash;that the doctor came to Sir Anthony with the best of
credentials. He was recommended by Lord Dewhurst, whom he met in
Buenos Aires."</p>

<p>"Then Hautmann was a complete stranger to Atherton-Wayne? The
two had never met before?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Jeffery jumped to his feet. "Listen&mdash;we must do two things
and do them promptly. There's mischief afoot and blood on the moon,
my girl! Now the first and most important is to get me back into
the Towers. Had I known what I know now, nothing in the world would
have induced me to leave. There must be some place where you can
hide me for a few days?"</p>

<p>His excitement was contagious. Elizabeth nodded quickly. "What's
wrong with Ted's cottage? No one is using it now."</p>

<p>"Splendid!"</p>

<p>"Ted would have to know, of course."</p>

<p>Jeffery frowned. "Yes, I see that. Still, we'll have to trust
him to hold his tongue. Next thing&mdash;how do we get inside the
grounds without being seen?"</p>

<p>"That's simple," the girl responded. "There's an old tunnel that
runs from the gate up to the vaults&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vaults?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth nodded. "You didn't have the chance to explore that
part of the Towers. Horrible place&mdash;great underground stone
rooms, dark and airless. Supposed to have been used at one time as
torture chambers." The girl shuddered. "I can quite believe it.
There are still rusty chains clamped to the walls..." She dismissed
the idea with a gesture. "Anyhow, Bob and I explored this tunnel a
few weeks ago. It brings you out quite near the cottage."</p>

<p>"All right. When can you get me in?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth considered a moment. "Just before dinner when the
others are dressing. How's that?"</p>

<p>"Splendid," Blackburn assured her. "Now, the other thing is to
get Ashton to write to Lord Dewhurst&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said Elizabeth sharply. She rose to her feet and stood
with face averted. Her tone was cold. "If we write, we must do it
ourselves&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But surely your fiancé&mdash;" began Jeffery, but again the
girl interrupted.</p>

<p>"We can expect no help from Bob. I don't know what he thinks of
Dr. Hautmann, but he seems more than satisfied with Miss Elsa."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Just this!" The girl wheeled on him and the young man was
amazed to see her eyes swimming.</p>

<p>"Bob's had plenty of time to study the question. He's scarcely
been out of Elsa Hautmann's pocket for the past two days!" She
stared at him, head high, chin defiant, then abruptly she turned
away. As Jeffery stood awkwardly, she continued in a small voice:
"Sorry. You caught a glimpse of my claws then. Please forget
it."</p>

<p>"Of course," murmured Jeffery. He addressed the girl's rigid
back and his tone was gentle. "Your fiancé is Sir Anthony's
secretary, you know. He's bound by duty as well as courtesy to be
polite to Miss Hautmann."</p>

<p>"Duty! Courtesy!" Elizabeth's voice rose, but she controlled it
with an effort. "Listen. Last night I couldn't sleep&mdash;I went
down to the library to borrow a book. The place was in darkness. I
was just about to open the door when I heard voices...their
voices!"</p>

<p>"You weren't mistaken?"</p>

<p>The girl turned and faced him. "Could I possibly mistake the
voice of the man I've been engaged to for the past two years?" she
said quietly. "And this morning I asked Bob to drive me down here.
He made some excuse about Sir Anthony wanting him to entertain Miss
Hautmann. I did something rather rotten then..." Her voice
faltered, but she continued: "I&mdash;I asked him if Sir Anthony
had asked him to entertain Miss Hautmann in the library last
night..."</p>

<p>"Oh, my aunt!" murmured Jeffery, "What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Flushed up and went out without saying a word." Elizabeth
dropped her eyes. "We&mdash;we haven't spoken since."</p>

<p>Jeffery made little soothing noises, conscious of his extreme
inadequacy in coping with such a situation. "I shouldn't take it
too seriously. These silly flirtations end very quickly. Meanwhile,
I have an excellent suggestion."</p>

<p>"Yes?" said Elizabeth doubtfully.</p>

<p>Blackburn gestured towards the inn. "This hostelry makes the
most delightful scones that ever came out of an oven. You halve
them, spread them with jam, pile them with clotted cream...and the
cares of the world dwindle into insignificance!"</p>

<p>"And tea?"</p>

<p>"Tea that makes nectar taste like the scrapings of the
wine-vat!" Jeffery smiled and crooked his arm invitingly. "Hungry?"
he asked.</p>

<p>The girl smiled in turn. "Jeffery," she said, "as a detective I
have my doubts about you. But as a delightful companion, you are
heaven's gift to a lonely woman!"</p>

<p>"Very well then," said Mr. Blackburn grandiloquently. "On to the
sconnery!"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>"We are very near to home&mdash;yes?" said Elsa Hautmann.</p>

<p>"Not far now," Ashton replied. "Tired?"</p>

<p>"A little, I think." She pulled off her small hat and even the
falling dusk could not dim the fine, spun gold of her hair. She
wore it long, in two plaits that wound to and fro about her head
like a yellow crown.</p>

<p>Ashton said softly: "You should never wear a hat, you know."</p>

<p>Elsa wrinkled her nose at him. "Silly. I get struck with your
sun, perhaps, eh?"</p>

<p>They were walking the road that led to the gates of Rookwood
Towers. The high stone wall surrounding the grounds was already in
sight, although the extremities were lost in the encroaching gloom.
Elsa Hautmann walked a few paces ahead, swinging her hat and
humming a little air. Ashton spoke again. "Enjoyed your afternoon,
Miss Elsa?"</p>

<p>The humming stopped, but the girl did not look round as she
spoke. "Miss Elsa? Last night it was just Elsa. Please, I like it
that way. Then I call you Bobbee."</p>

<p>Ashton grinned. In two sharp paces he had caught up with her.
"That a kid's name. Call me Robert, like everyone else."</p>

<p>"No, no!" Miss Hautmann shook her head. "I like Bobbee. In
Vienna, I meet a very handsome American called Bobbee. You, too,
would love Vienna. You could sit with me in the Opern Restaurant
and drink coffee. Or we could travel to Egern, and you could wear
leather breeches and a green hat with a scarlet feather." She
sighed. "Egern in lilac time...it is heavenly."</p>

<p>"That's all very well, Elsa. But travel costs money. I must stay
here with my work."</p>

<p>The girl shrugged. "Perhaps if I ask my father, he will take you
as a secretary. Then we can go to Vienna and walk under the linden
trees&mdash;"</p>

<p>The young man gave an indulgent laugh. "Here, wait a minute!
I've known you only two days and you want to whisk me out of the
country. Besides, you don't even know if your father wants a
secretary."</p>

<p>Elsa Hautmann turned and smiled at him. Her white teeth
glistened as she spoke. "My father is kind&mdash;he give me
whatever I want. You see?"</p>

<p>Ashton nodded. "I see. But there's more to it than that. I
happen to be engaged to a young lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>The girl stopped suddenly and faced him. "Engaged?" There was a
little shrill note in her voice. "Is that betrothed?" And, as the
secretary nodded: "But, Bobbee, last night you say to
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was Ashton's turn to interrupt. "Yes, I know," he said
curtly. "Look here, if we're going to get back in time for dinner,
we'd best not be standing here." He glanced at his watch. "We'll
scarcely have time to dress as it is."</p>

<p>They began walking. After a short silence, Elsa spoke and her
tone held a hint of malice. "Sir Anthony will be very angry with
you if you keep me late&mdash;yes?"</p>

<p>"Wait!" They were close to the gates now. The stone pillars
loomed like pale, squat ghosts before them. "I've an idea how we
can creep in unseen." He turned to the girl. "Are you on for a bit
of a lark?"</p>

<p>Elsa eyed him doubtfully. "You mean&mdash;some joke?"</p>

<p>"In a way&mdash;yes." Robert brushed aside any explanation and
continued hurriedly. "A few steps along here there's an old tunnel
that leads right up to the house. It will get us there quicker,
though it's rather dark and steep..."</p>

<p>"Dark...steep?" The girl seemed to ponder over the words. Then
she said abruptly: "Yes. It is a&mdash;a lark. Let us go that
way."</p>

<p>Ashton nodded and led the way through the gates. Near where the
trees began, a shell of what had once been a lodge house raised
ruined serrated walls. The secretary picked his way over the fallen
stones and paused before a tilting stone archway, draped with thick
ivy. He thrust back this leafy curtain and revealed the mouth of a
black hole. Elsa, close behind him, gave a little ejaculation.</p>

<p>"Ach&mdash;but it is so dark...!"</p>

<p>Ashton said quietly: "Frightened?"</p>

<p>"A little, I think. You will hold my hand&mdash;yes?"</p>

<p>Robert thrust out his hand and felt soft fingers close around
it. "I'll go first," he muttered. "No need to be scared&mdash;I
know every inch of this passage. It's as safe as the roadway."</p>

<p>He dropped the ivy draping behind him and complete darkness
enclosed them. Elsa's fingers tightened on his own as their feet
scrabbled on the loose stones of the passage. Once a spider web
brushed her face and she gave a little cut-off scream and pressed
closer to him. Presently, he gently disengaged his hand and she
cried out fearfully:</p>

<p>"Why do you let me go? What is happening?"</p>

<p>The other pressed her arm reassuringly. "There's a steep step
down here. I'll go on first and lift you..." His voice moved away.
In the darkness she heard the rattle of matches and a tiny flame
flickered in the gloom. It revealed a sharp drop of about two feet
where part of the floor had sunk. Ashton retraced his steps and led
Elsa to the edge of the drop. The match flickered and died and
blackness engulfed them again. In that second, Elsa screamed.</p>

<p>"Bobbee...I'm falling!"</p>

<p>Ashton was at her side, his arms tight about her. The girl clung
to him, trembling. He could feel her breath warm upon his cheek,
the terrified pounding of her heart as she shrank closer in his
arms. He soothed her as one would a frightened child. "I'm holding
you, Elsa, I'm holding you." Then, on an impulse, he bent his lips
to the smoothness of her cheek.</p>

<p>Elsa gave a little sigh and relaxed in his embrace. "Hold me
like this always, Bobbee," she murmured. "Never, never let me go,"
and in the thick darkness he kissed her lips.</p>

<p>There came a sudden interruption. Almost simultaneously, voices
and footsteps echoed down the passage and the dancing beam of a
torch flickered on the roof above their heads. The next moment the
pair were outlined in a pool of light that wavered, steadied and
was abruptly cut off. In the darkness, thicker now by contrast, the
footsteps halted. A woman's voice said coldly:</p>

<p>"Too late, Jeffery. I saw it."</p>

<p>Ashton said sharply: "Elizabeth!" The light flashed on again and
the secretary flung one hand across his eyes to protect them from
the glare. Elsa Hautmann was staring into the shadows with wide
eyes.</p>

<p>From out of the gloom behind the glow of the torch Elizabeth
stepped. Her voice was brittle with anger. "Jeffery, I don't think
you've met Miss Hautmann. The gentleman with the lipstick on his
face was, at one time, my fiancé!"</p>

<p>Robert Ashton cried out: "Elizabeth, you don't
understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>Deliberately the girl turned her back and spoke to her
companion. "Jeffery, would you take me back the other way. I feel
we're both rather in the way here."</p>

<p>Then the torch snapped out again and a merciful darkness
enveloped the unfortunate scene.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>After dinner that same night Robert Ashton knocked on the door
of Elizabeth Blaire's room. Without waiting for an invitation, he
thrust open the door and walked inside. The girl was curled up in
an armchair, rather too intent upon a novel. She glanced up as the
secretary entered. Ashton closed the door and stood with his back
against it.</p>

<p>"Ted told me I'd find you here, Betty," he began. "I've come to
explain..."</p>

<p>Elizabeth carefully marked a place in her book, closed it and
stood up. "There's nothing to explain," she said levelly. "I'm
giving you your freedom."</p>

<p>"But, look here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've known for months our engagement was a mistake. What
happened a few hours ago just clinched my suspicions." She placed
the book on the table. "I'm not blaming you, Bob. I'm setting you
free. I think that's all there is to be said."</p>

<p>Ashton advanced a step and thrust out pleading hands. "Betty,
I&mdash;I know I lost my head, but try to see it from my point of
view."</p>

<p>Elizabeth shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don't think there's any use in discussing the matter further,
Bob." She glanced at her wristwatch. "Now, I have an appointment to
keep&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ashton backed to the door, blocking it with his heavy body. "Who
with?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The girl eyed him with faint distaste. "Would you kindly allow
me to pass?"</p>

<p>"It's Blackburn, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth drew a deep breath. "Would you kindly allow me to
pass?" she repeated.</p>

<p>The edge on her tone sent the blood rushing to the secretary's
face. "No, I won't!" He stood firmly, head thrust forward, mouth
sullen. "You've refused to allow me to explain. All right! How
about doing a little explaining yourself?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you."</p>

<p>"What were you doing in that passage with Blackburn?" Up came
the girl's head and her tone snapped like a whiplash. "Mind your
own dashed business!"</p>

<p>Ashton's mouth twisted. "I guessed you'd say that. You'd find it
pretty difficult to explain why you were sneaking him into the
house through the underground passage! And why you asked your
brother to set him up in the cottage like a star boarder." He
thrust out a pugnacious jaw. "Come on&mdash;explain that! Why did
you want Blackburn back in the house after Sir Anthony had kicked
him out?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth Blaire was staring at him, almost as though she was
seeing this man for the first time. The same slow wonder was
reflected in her voice when she spoke. "Why, you jealous fool!"</p>

<p>"Well, answer me!" A pulse in the young man's forehead fluttered
like a trapped insect. "I'll tell you why! Because you're in love
with him! You've been in love with him ever since he came down
here!" His voice, thick with passion, rose harshly. "You're so much
in love with him you can't bear him out of your sight!"</p>

<p>Their mutual antagonism quivered the air about them. Elizabeth
clenched her hands, choking back the searing words that rose to her
lips. She felt a rising tide of colour staining, her face and her
throat was hot and tight. "I'm going to cry," she thought
feverishly. "I mustn't&mdash;not in front of him&mdash;I
mustn't...!" In that swollen bursting silence, Ashton's heavy
breathing was plain.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;</p>

<p>Although muffled by the intervening walls, the scream tore
through the hush like a knife ripping stretched silk. The sound
acted like a cold douche on the two people in the room. Ashton
blinked like a man waking from a dream. Elizabeth gave a startled
gasp, but it was wiped from her lips by a second scream, a long
quivering note of terror that was suddenly cut off at its highest
note.</p>

<p>"That's Ted's voice!" The girl's hand flew to her mouth.
"Jeffery&mdash;he warned me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried Ashton. He wheeled and flung open the door.
Side by side they raced down the long corridor. To Elizabeth the
oak-panelled walls had the infinity of a nightmare; it seemed hours
before they reached her brother's room and paused, breathless,
before the stout door. Ashton had stretched out his hand and was
about to grasp the knob when a new sound froze them both
motionless.</p>

<p>It came from inside the room, a harsh inhuman cry such as could
never have issued from human lips. To the listeners in the
corridor, it seemed the very embodiment of triumphant evil. Even as
they stood staring at each other, the sound died away. Elizabeth
Blaire was trembling from head to foot. The high colour had drained
from Ashton's face, leaving it pale. He passed a tongue over dry
lips. "What was that?" he muttered.</p>

<p>The girl's reply was a whisper. "The hooting of an owl..."</p>

<p>"The Owl!" Ashton squared his big shoulders and made a sudden
thrust at the door. The stout oak did not budge. The secretary
wrenched helplessly at the knob. "Locked!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Scarcely were the words out of his mouth than the corridor rang
with hurried footsteps. Blackburn turned a bend ahead of them
almost at the double. "Those screams," he rapped as he approached.
"I was coming across the grounds..." He halted, his eyes flashing
from their pale startled faces to the closed door. "For God's sake,
what are we waiting for?"</p>

<p>For answer the secretary rattled the door-knob. "Can't you see?"
he snapped. "It's locked!"</p>

<p>Jeffery swung round on the girl. "Duplicate keys...?" he began,
but Elizabeth had divined his thought almost as the words left his
lips. She was already half-way down the corridor.</p>

<p>"Housekeeper's room&mdash;quite near&mdash;won't be a moment,"
she flung back over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Blackburn turned back to the door and drummed his fists upon it.
"Blaire," he called. "Blaire, are you all right?" There was no
reply. He addressed his companion without turning. "Is there any
other entrance to this room?"</p>

<p>"Only the windows," Ashton replied. He measured the door with
his eye and braced his muscles. "Can't we smash this down?"</p>

<p>"You'd smash your shoulder first." Jeffery turned as Elizabeth
came into view, holding a bunch of keys. Her fingers were busy
separating one from the others and she held this out to Blackburn.
He took it without a word, slipped it into the lock and gestured
his companions back. With a thrust of his arm he flung the door
wide.</p>

<p>The room was empty!</p>

<p>So much they saw at first glance, crowding behind him in the
open doorway. Then their questing eyes took in each ominous
detail&mdash;the overturned table with its scattered papers, the
shade of the tall standard lamp tilted askew, a lone slipper
discarded on the floor and the thick curtains hanging in crooked
folds where some violent force had wrenched the material from the
rings. And three pairs of eyes travelled to the long window,
standing wide open with the heavy shutters swinging gently to and
fro in the breeze...</p>

<p>A darker shadow on the pattern of the carpet caught Jeffery's
attention. He strode into the room and, bending, poked inquisitive
fingers at the pile. They came away stained crimson. A sharp
exclamation brought him to his feet. Elizabeth Was staring at his
hand.</p>

<p>"Jeffery..." she said softly.</p>

<p>He gripped her arm. "Courage," he whispered, and turned to where
Ashton was surveying the wrecked room incredulously "When did you
last see Blaire?"</p>

<p>"Twenty minutes ago&mdash;less than that. I left him sitting at
that table." The secretary made a vague gesture towards the
wreckage. "I say, this is impossible! The door was locked. This
room is on the third floor and there's a fifty-foot drop under
those windows..." His voice tailed off.</p>

<p>Then Elizabeth spoke.</p>

<p>"Why is it so impossible?" she asked quietly. "Are you
forgetting an owl can fly?"</p>

<p>"An owl!" Jeffery snapped the words. "You mean...?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded. "We heard the hooting&mdash;Bob and I&mdash;out
there." Her eyes sought the empty corridor and suddenly, as though
on an impulse, she moved and closed the door. "And then, Jeffery,
you came running along..." The words died suddenly on her lips.</p>

<p>"Look!" she said huskily.</p>

<p>There was no need for that startled injunction. With the closing
of the door, something pinned on the centre panel had swung into
view. It was a small square of white pasteboard and in the top
right hand corner were three words:</p>

<p class="cpi"><i>"Fly by Night."</i>
</p>

<p>And underneath, printed in straggling inked capitals, was an
additional phrase.</p>

<p class="cpi"><i>"I am still among you!"</i>
</p>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>CHAPTER FOUR. "Frankly, it took
sheer guts to step into that black hole in the wall..."</h2>

<h3>SUNDAY, JUNE 16TH.</h3>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Hands in pockets, a deep wrinkle between his brows, Jeffery
stood in Atherton-Wayne's study, gazing unseeingly out across the
green lawns that flanked the long windows.</p>

<p>It was a glorious morning. Under the bright morning sun, the
world gleamed like a new toy. The air had that fine clarity which
brings all details into sharp focus so that from where Blackburn
stood he could make out the vehicles crawling across the green and
rounded shoulder of Pewley Hill. Nearer at hand, a curve of the
river glinted like a burnished shield. But all this beauty was lost
on the tall young man at the window. Jeffery's thoughts moved in
darker spheres. So engrossed was he in his own reflections that
when Atherton-Wayne's voice spoke behind him, he started and
dropped an inch of cigarette ash down his coat.</p>

<p>"Blackburn..."</p>

<p>The young man wheeled sharply. The baronet sat at his desk, thin
fingers shuffling among papers like creatures taking quick cover. A
little to one side, Dr. Hautmann stood so rigidly that Jeffery
envisaged a corset beneath the dark pin-striped suit.</p>

<p>"Blackburn." Atherton-Wayne spoke levelly. "Both Dr. Hautmann
and myself feel we&mdash;er&mdash;owe you an apology."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>The answer was mechanical. For as Hautmann nodded in agreement,
Jeffery realized that this was the first time he had seen the
German doctor at close quarters. His first impression was something
in the nature of a shock&mdash;never had he seen such a curious
pallor. It was more than just dead white; almost it seemed as
though some faint greenish tinge shone through the doctor's closely
shaven skin, stretched tight on the spare framework of his face.
That jutting nose beaked above a mouth straight and thin as a
sabre-cut. The only indeterminate feature of the face were the
eyes; indeterminate because they were never quite revealed from
under the pale heavy lids. Jeffery had a quick impression of a
powerful personality, repressed now as a spring is coiled.
Suddenly, the thought of a cobra came into his mind, the same
sinuous lean body, the same cruel veiled eyes...</p>

<p>With an effort, he attempted to concentrate on what Sir Anthony
was saying.</p>

<p>"I blame myself most bitterly for what happened last night. I
should never have permitted you to leave the Towers." Those
restless fingers toyed with the ink-well. "Quite unwittingly, I
played right into this criminal's hands."</p>

<p>Jeffery shrugged. "I doubt if my being here would have made much
difference, Sir Anthony."</p>

<p>Dr. Hautmann pulled a chair forward and sat down, stiffly, as a
jack-knife bends. His dark eyes flicked for a moment across
Jeffery's face. "Surely it is rather significant that this criminal
should wait until you were out of the way to act?" There was, the
young man noticed, no trace of Teutonic harshness in the tone.
Rather was it too gentle, like a watchful cat purring. "You have
examined the room, Mr. Blackburn, you found no clue?"</p>

<p>"In the room...no."</p>

<p>"I should suggest examining the ivy on the wall rather than the
room itself." Atherton-Wayne's tone was precise. Jeffery was
selecting a cigarette. He raised his eyes.</p>

<p>"You believe that The Owl climbed up the ivy and left the same
way, carrying Blaire on his back?"</p>

<p>"It seems fairly obvious, I should say."</p>

<p>Jeffery shook his head. "Have you ever tried to climb ivy, sir?
Do you know what happens when any weight is placed on the plant?
The creeper is torn and lacerated, the ground beneath littered with
leaves..." He paused, his eyes searching the other's face over a
tiny match-flame. "I examined the ivy closely. There was not even a
tendril misplaced!"</p>

<p>The baronet said thinly: "But the door was locked on the
inside."</p>

<p>"That is true."</p>

<p>There was no sound in the room save the soft tap-tap of
Hautmann's shoe drumming an unconscious little beat on the floor.
Jeffery, noting this and watching Atherton-Wayne's restless fingers
crawling across the desk, realized with a shock that both these men
were strung on the thin wires of hysteria. Not for the first time
he asked himself...why? What was hidden behind Atherton-Wayne's
aesthetic features? What secrets lay deep in the doctor's obsidian
eyes? It was the latter who broke the silence with a laugh forced
as water from a rusty pump.</p>

<p>"Are you suggesting, Mr. Blackburn, that this criminal picked up
young Blaire...and flew out of the window with him like the great
bird in the <i>Arabian Nights'</i> tale?"</p>

<p>Jeffery chose to ignore the sneer that smarmed the words. He
said calmly: "I am suggesting this, Doctor. By what means Blaire
was removed from that room I do not know, but I will stake what
little reputation I have that he is somewhere within the grounds of
this house. What's more&mdash;he is still alive."</p>

<p>"How can you say that?"</p>

<p>"The Owl wants the formula. To kill Blaire would be to defeat
his own purpose. That much is common sense." Jeffery paused to blow
smoke. "As to whether this criminal has learnt the art of
levitation, we may yet come to accept even the fantastic before
this case is over. If you had heard that scream last night..."
Abruptly he pounded. "By the way, Doctor, did you hear it?"</p>

<p>"I? Why, no. I was walking in the garden near the cottage. Mr.
Blaire's room is at the opposite end of the house."</p>

<p>"I see." The young man studied that pallid mask for a moment,
then wheeled. "And you, Sir Anthony?"</p>

<p>"I was working out a chess problem, here in this room." The
baronet gestured vaguely. "Apart from my concentration on the game,
the walls of this study are extremely solid." The tone took on a
note of mild reproof. "I was rather surprised that no one told me
of the&mdash;er&mdash;outrage until quite half an hour after it had
occurred."</p>

<p>Jeffery raised his eyebrows. "But I sent Ashton to look for you
as soon as we found Blaire had gone."</p>

<p>"Really?" It held a note of finality. "I was here."
Atherton-Wayne rose and dusted an imaginary speck from his coat.
"You have informed the Chief Inspector?"</p>

<p>"He'll be down this morning." As he spoke, Jeffery crossed to
the bookcase and selected a volume. Turning, he displayed it. "May
I borrow this for a few hours, sir? It's the history of Rookwood
Towers."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly."</p>

<p>Blackburn was flicking pages. "I'm rather interested in the old
vaults under this house. I understand that they were put to certain
inquisitorial purposes when the Mother Church introduced persuasive
ways into England&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something made the young man glance up sharply. Atherton-Wayne
was staring at him, his thin face as grey as his hair. If ever a
man's face showed naked fear, it was at that moment. And again
Jeffery felt that unnamable prickling at the base of his skull.
Then, as swiftly as the turning of a leaf, the expression vanished.
Bland was the face, smooth was the voice as the baronet spoke.</p>

<p>"If you're thinking of going down into those vaults, you'll be
careful, Blackburn. There is...danger."</p>

<p>"Danger?"</p>

<p>Something constricted the baronet's throat so that a cough
choked the next words. "I&mdash;I&mdash;the vaults are extremely
ancient. Only recently, a fall of rock blocked one passage
completely. I should have had the main entrance shut off months
ago..." The thin voice trailed away.</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded. "Thank you for the warning. I shall be careful.
It would be most fortunate for The Owl if I were entombed."</p>

<p>The knock on the door came with such suddenness that Blackburn's
pulses leapt. In answer to the baronet's invitation, the door
opened and Ashton's face was framed in the entrance. He spoke to
his employer, ignoring the other men in the room.</p>

<p>"A Mr. Todhunter to see you, sir."</p>

<p>"Todhunter?" The elder man frowned. "I know of no Todhunter,
Ashton. What does he want?"</p>

<p>The secretary produced a card and handed it across. "He asked
for Mr. Blaire, sir. When I told him that was impossible, he
insisted on seeing you. Then he mentioned the name of one of your
directors&mdash;Mr. Standish. A close friend, apparently."</p>

<p>Sir Anthony was still musing over the card. "Charles Todhunter,
Ajax Oil Company, Detroit. H'm..." He raised his eyes, addressing
the room at large. "Oil? Rather significant under the
circumstances, I think." Then he nodded. "Very well, Ashton. I will
see this Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Todhunter."</p>

<p>Ashton nodded and withdrew. Jeffery, the book tucked under his
arm, moved across to the long windows and passed through. Sir
Anthony watched him go. Then he turned. Dr. Hautmann had not moved
from his chair. The baronet cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;if there is nothing further, Doctor..." There was
polite dismissal in his tone. Hautmann, however, remained seated.
He linked his long fingers and sat back.</p>

<p>"If it would not be an intrusion, I should like to remain. I an
interested in Mr. Todhunter."</p>

<p>The calm assurance in his manner ruffled the little baronet. He
said stiffly: "But surely, Doctor..."</p>

<p>The other's smooth purr cut into his words. "I rather think our
visitor has an interesting proposition to make to us both." He
settled his lean body more comfortably. "I am afraid I really must
insist on remaining."</p>

<p>Sir Anthony jumped to his feet, but the angry words died on his
lips as the study door opened and Ashton ushered in the newcomer.
Mr. Charles Todhunter stood looking around the room. The others had
an impression of a lean, dried stick of a man in his late forties.
Under a thatch of red hair that shone like a beacon, a shrewd-eyed,
tight-lipped face surveyed them.</p>

<p>"Sir Anthony?" inquired the visitor.</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne advanced and nodded. "I am Atherton-Wayne." He
barely touched the outstretched hand, then gestured to a vacant
chair. "Sit down, Mr. Todhunter."</p>

<p>The representative of the Ajax Oil Company lowered himself into
a chair and balanced a small leather brief-case on his knees. In
his seat, Hautmann sat like a graven image. Abruptly, the American
leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Well, Sir Anthony, I suppose you wonder why I'm here." His
voice had a pleasant, lazy burr. "You're a busy man. So am I.
There's no sense in beating about the bush. No, sir. I'll give you
the whole thing wrapped up small."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." The red pate nodded sagely. "Here's the proposition.
My company&mdash;Ajax&mdash;want the sole rights of Mr. Blaire's
petrol formula. And we're willing to pay up to one hundred thousand
dollars for it!"</p>

<p>Sir Anthony dropped slowly into his seat. "God bless my soul!"
he murmured.</p>

<p>A smile that began and ended with his mouth crossed Todhunter's
bleak face. "Startled you, eh? That's real money, that is!" He
tapped the leather case on his knee. "All the documents are ready.
Say the word and we'll put your John Hancock on the dotted line
right now!"</p>

<p>"One moment!" The baronet drew a handkerchief from his sleeve
and patted his forehead. "This&mdash;this is amazing! I was under
the impression that merely a handful of people inside this house
knew that the formula even existed."</p>

<p>"Say, you don't imagine you can keep news like that secret!" The
American leaned back and crossed his legs. "Well, what's your
answer?"</p>

<p>"Merely this. Blaire's formula is not for sale. Even if it was,
I would never dream of selling it outside this country."</p>

<p>Todhunter shrugged. "Please yourself, of course. But twenty
thousand pounds is real money, even in this tight little island.
Hang on to the formula as long as you like&mdash;that's good
business. But I'm telling you. You'll never get another offer as
generous as ours."</p>

<p>From his corner, Hautmann spoke. "Don't be too sure, Mr.
Todhunter."</p>

<p>"What's this?"</p>

<p>The doctor rose, stood stiffly to attention, clicked his heels
and bowed. "Allow me to introduce myself, sir. I am Dr. Hautmann,
foreign service officer for the German Minister of War and attached
to the National Defence Department, Berlin." He turned. "Sir
Anthony, I am authorized by my Government to offer you twenty-five
thousand pounds for your petrol formula."</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne blinked like a man waking from a nightmare. With
fingers gripping his chair, he stared from one man to the other,
anger and surprise struggling for expression in his face. Two pink
spots burnt fiercely in his cheeks and his eyes glinted like newly
minted coins.</p>

<p>"This is fantastic!" he panted. "Never in all my life..." He
paused and drew a deep breath, striving to regain his control. "Dr.
Hautmann, am I to understand that you came into my house as a
guest, accepted my hospitality, when all the time you were planning
to purchase the formula?"</p>

<p>The other said calmly: "That is so."</p>

<p>"Just a moment." Todhunter was on his feet. "I got in first with
my offer. Therefore, I claim first consideration."</p>

<p>The doctor felt in his pocket, produced a gold-rimmed monocle
and screwed it into his eye. Turning, he surveyed the American
steadily. "May I remind you, sir, that the formula is on sale to
the highest bidder?"</p>

<p>Todhunter flushed angrily. He ignored the doctor and addressed
the baronet: "Listen, Sir Anthony&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hautmann barked: "The matter is closed."</p>

<p>"No, by heck, it isn't."</p>

<p>"Twenty-five thousand pounds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't listen to him, Sir Anthony."</p>

<p>"Wait!" Atherton-Wayne rose and flailed protesting hands in the
air. "Gentlemen&mdash;please! This undignified bickering is neither
desirable nor necessary. Rather than see the formula leave England,
I shall myself become the highest bidder."</p>

<p>The doctor said harshly: "You'll buy it yourself?"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Sir Anthony pulled back his sleeve and studied his
wrist-watch with deliberation. "And now, gentlemen, if you will
excuse me, I have some work to do."</p>

<p>Todhunter's narrowed eyes raked the baronet's thin face for a
moment, then he shrugged his shoulders. "Very well, if that's how
you feel about it." He picked up his brief-case. "I'm mighty sorry
we couldn't do business, but it serves me right for dealing with a
third party. Next time I'll see Mr. Blaire himself."</p>

<p>"You are merely wasting your time," Atherton-Wayne told him.</p>

<p>"I wonder." Mr. Todhunter paused with his hand on the door.
"Maybe within the next few days you'll be wanting to see me again.
I'll be staying at the 'Green Dragon'. Good morning."</p>

<p>The door closed behind him. Atherton-Wayne turned to where the
tall man stood, polishing his monocle on a silk handkerchief. He
said smoothly: "Mr. Todhunter shows surprisingly good taste,
Doctor. The 'Green Dragon' is an excellent example of the English
inn..."</p>

<p>The pause was not lost on Hautmann. His dark brows rose a trifle
and his tone matched his companion's in silkiness. "You are
suggesting that my daughter and myself&mdash;avail ourselves of its
hospitality?"</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne inclined his head. "At your earliest
convenience."</p>

<p>Their eyes met and for a moment there was a clash of wills. Then
Dr. Hautmann stepped back, screwed his monocle in place and gave a
stiff bow.</p>

<p>"As you wish, sir. But I think it only fair to warn you that we
shall meet again. To return to my country without that formula
would be to admit failure. In Germany, at the present time, failure
has particularly unpleasant consequences."</p>

<p>With a click of his heels he turned and strode from the room. As
the door closed, it seemed to the baronet that the study had grown
perceptibly darker. Atherton-Wayne bent and pulled open a drawer in
his desk. A small automatic lay revealed. Sir Anthony picked up the
weapon, balanced it thoughtfully in his hand for a moment and, as
though on a sudden impulse, slipped it into his pocket.</p>

<p class="cpi">
</p>

<p>In another room in the Towers, an apologetic Ashton faced
Elizabeth Blaire.</p>

<p>"Betty," the man was saying. "You must listen to me."</p>

<p>Elizabeth, curled up on the window-seat, nodded calmly.</p>

<p>"Very well, Robert," she said, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask Atherton-Wayne to bring the police down
here?"</p>

<p>The girl stared at him. "But the police are down here."</p>

<p>The secretary brushed her remark aside with a gesture. "I mean
Scotland Yard&mdash;not an incompetent amateur! Betty, be sensible!
Ted has been missing for almost twelve hours now. And
Blackburn&mdash;what's he doing about it? Swotting over books in
the library!"</p>

<p>Elizabeth said almost casually: "Robert, why do you want Jeffery
out of the way?"</p>

<p>A slow pink tide stained Ashton's plump face. "So it's got to
Jeffery now...?"</p>

<p>"Answer my question."</p>

<p>"Why?" The big man took a step forward. "Because he&mdash;" then
something, perhaps a warning glint in the girl's eye made him
change the sentence on his lips&mdash;"because I think this job's
too big for him. This isn't petty larceny, it's a case that's going
to require the full resources of Scotland Yard." His voice dropped
and he gave a quick glance over his shoulder. "I tell you, Betty,
this whole thing's deeper than the Mendip mine! And it's
dangerous."</p>

<p>This was a changed Ashton, a man that Elizabeth had never seen
before. She said quickly: "You know something?"</p>

<p>The other shook his head. "I can't say&mdash;yet. But this
morning, going through some private papers, I came across a small
detail that didn't quite make sense. Or rather, it made too much
sense&mdash;a sense of the fantastic." His voice slowed. "Promise
you won't mention this to anyone?"</p>

<p>"Not even to Jeffery?"</p>

<p>Ashton's face hardened. "Certainly not," he replied curtly.
"This is my show. Let that blighter discover things for himself.
Now, promise?"</p>

<p>For just a moment the girl hesitated, then she smiled. "All
right. But you won't do anything foolish, Robert? You yourself
admit that this thing is mighty dangerous."</p>

<p>The secretary hunched big shoulders. "I'm not afraid..."</p>

<p>"That's just it," Elizabeth said quietly.</p>

<p>The young secretary cocked an eye at her and something like a
grin touched his lips. "Friends again?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"And, Betty..." the words came haltingly, "if this hunch of mine
is right, it means that we'll have The Owl where we want him.
There'd be no more fear or terror or suspicion. We'd be just as we
were before all this started...I mean..." And now Ashton's cheeks
were crimson. "We...you and I...could we go on just as we were
before&mdash;before...?" He looked at her, appeal in his eyes, and
Elizabeth smiled.</p>

<p>"We'll see," she replied lightly. "But first catch your
Owl."</p>

<p>The young man's face lit up. "That's all I wanted to know," he
returned. As though on sudden impulse he reached out one hand and,
before the girl was aware of his intention, he gave her fingers a
friendly squeeze. Then with a jaunty swing of his shoulders, he
turned and strode from the room. Elizabeth heard him go whistling
down the passage.</p>

<p>Left to herself, the girl resumed her seat by the window.
Adjusting the cushion behind her head, she lay back, relaxed, her
mind revolving about Robert's last remark. There was no real harm
in him, she reflected. Strange how some men never seemed to grow
up. Always she thought of Robert as a shock-headed boy with a tear
in his coat through climbing forbidden apple-trees. But
Jeffery&mdash;Jeffery was different. Whereas Robert would climb
apple-trees for the danger of it, Jeffery would climb them to see
what lay on the other side of the hill.</p>

<p>Life with Jeffery would be exciting&mdash;a keen, calculated
adventure of which the issue would always be secure. Lazily her
thoughts floated here and there, to entangle themselves on the one
scene she wanted to forget&mdash;the incident in the tunnel. Or did
she want to forget it?...The warm, strong clasp of Jeffery's hand
around hers...the way that absurd lock of brown hair fell across
his forehead when he dipped his tall figure...</p>

<p>Elizabeth Blaire sat up abruptly. "This," she told herself
warmly, "is sheer folly! For one thing, you're still engaged to
Robert. For another, Jeffery probably considers you a number one
nuisance for ever bringing him into this business in the first
place. And third, you should be frantic with worry about Ted!"</p>

<p>Even in that moment of self-reproach she realized something was
wrong. She was anxious about her brother&mdash;but was she really
worried? Was it because she had complete faith in Jeffery, or was
there some darker reason for her blind acceptance of the
kidnapping? Why, even Robert seemed more distressed than she
was!</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" Elizabeth said sharply, not liking the way her
thoughts were moving. "I'm getting morbid," she told herself.
"After all, it's no good flying around the house like a mad thing,
tearing my nerves to shreds. The inspector and his men will be down
this afternoon. They'll find Ted. That's what Scotland Yard is paid
to do." Then, with a shock, Miss Blaire realized she was talking
aloud to herself.</p>

<p>She made a little grimace of disapproval and swung her silken
legs to the floor as though to rise. Then, for the first time, she
realized how silent the house had fallen. Outside the window, the
noonday sun was bright overhead, but in that room there was the
quietness of shuttered cities standing deserted under a pallid
moon. Also, for the first time, Elizabeth realized that Rookwood
Towers was a house with a past&mdash;old enough for memories, old
enough even for ghosts. Heaven alone knew how many queer emotional
storms had left their invisible mark on the stuffy air of those
shuttered rooms and curtained corridors. Sitting there, it was easy
to imagine that once upon a time dark-robed monks had paraded these
rooms, rustling musty drapes in the shadows, turning door-handles
with whitening fingers and, where admission was barred to them,
tapping...tapping...</p>

<p>Tapping!</p>

<p>The girl drew a quick, cut-off breath. For a second it had
seemed that thought had been transformed into action&mdash;that the
image in her mind had assumed tangible reality. Elizabeth rose,
taking in the room with a swift, puzzled glance. She had the queer
sensation that she, in turn, was being watched. With an uneasy
shrug of her shoulders, she walked across to the cigarette-box on a
small table. But scarcely had she taken two steps when she froze
rigid with fear.</p>

<p>Something was tapping behind the panelling!</p>

<p>There was no mistaking that soft, intermittent drumming. It
seemed to travel around the room toward her. Elizabeth stood frozen
into an attitude, conscious of a slow terror creeping across her
mind like some numbing anaesthetic. It was like a nightmare in
which commonplace objects take on the suggestion of things strange
and horrible. The tapping ceased. It was so quiet in the room that
the girl could hear the blood singing through her pulses.</p>

<p>As she stood listening there came another sound&mdash;the low
humming of oiled machinery. Elizabeth's eyes flew back and forth
like small trapped animals, to rest finally on a portion of the
panelling opposite where she stood. There was no mistake&mdash;the
panel was opening, slowly, inch by inch...</p>

<p>Then, from the aperture already widening, a hand groped into the
room, feeling the adjoining panel with an oddly caressing
gesture&mdash;a hand with blackened, broken nails, a hand the third
finger of which ended in a spatulate stump...</p>

<p>With fingers clawing at her throat, Elizabeth screamed.</p>

<p>Then it seemed as though all the world were suddenly accelerated
into double speed. The hand was jerked back the gaping panel
snapped shut. Almost simultaneously the door of the room was flung
open and Blackburn burst in. He was at the side of the
near-fainting girl in a moment, his arm about her.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth!" The name came naturally to Jeffery's lips. "Are you
all right?" And as the girl nodded, he rapped: "What happened?"</p>

<p>She fought down the suffocation in her throat. "The panel...it
opened..." Jeffery could feel her trembling with the shock. "A hand
came out..." her voice bubbled hysterically, "and, Jeffery,
it&mdash;it only had four fingers..."</p>

<p>Blackburn led the girl to a chair and pushed her gently into it.
Reaching in his pocket he pulled out his case, extracted a
cigarette and gave it to her. As he applied his lighter, she puffed
deeply, wreathing her pale face in the paler smoke. Presently
Jeffery said:</p>

<p>"Feel better?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth nodded. "Yes."</p>

<p>He was staring at the wall with narrowed eyes. "Which panel
opened?"</p>

<p>The girl gestured with her cigarette. Jeffery strode across and
applied his knuckles to the woodwork. He nodded grimly at the
hollow resonance, then his long fingers began to crawl over the
section, pressing here, pausing there. And as though responding,
again that low humming filled the room. Slowly the panel reopened,
wider this time, to reveal the black mouth of a tunnel. Into the
room floated a smell of mustiness, of decaying undergrowth and of
things long denied sunlight and fresh air.</p>

<p>Jeffery, standing off at one side, craned his head around the
aperture. He spoke without looking at the girl.</p>

<p>"All right now?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Elizabeth rose and crushed out her cigarette. "Jeffery,
you're not going in there?"</p>

<p>He ignored the question. "My room is fourth around the bend in
the corridor," he told her. "The door's unlocked. In the top drawer
of the bureau you'll find a torch. Bring it to me here."</p>

<p>"But, Jeffery&mdash;"</p>

<p>Blackburn rapped sharply: "And hurry! Every moment's
precious!"</p>

<p>It was a command. Elizabeth almost ran from the room. She was
back within two minutes. Jeffery was standing as she had left him,
rigid before that black cavern, so that she was reminded of a
terrier guarding a rat-hole. She thrust the torch into his
hand.</p>

<p>"Are you going in there?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Naturally."</p>

<p>"Then I'm coming with you."</p>

<p>Jeffery turned and surveyed her. His face was harder than she
had ever seen it before. "Now listen to me, young woman," he said
curtly. "You're going to do just what you're told. You're going to
close this panel after I've gone through. The Inspector's down in
the morning room with some of the boys&mdash;they arrived about ten
minutes ago. Tell Read just what happened and say I want two men
guarding this end of the passage."</p>

<p>Elizabeth said urgently: "But what if you're trapped&mdash;down
there?"</p>

<p>"That's my job," Blackburn said shortly. He switched on the
torch and flashed it through the opening. "Seems all clear," he
muttered, then, over his shoulder: "Remember your instructions."
Bending his head, he stepped into the cavity. As the darkness
swallowed him, Elizabeth reached out a hand and began to push the
panel shut. Then suddenly an expression crossed her face, an
obstinate stiffening of her rounded little chin. She inclined her
ear to the slit and listened. Jeffery's footsteps were dying away
in the distance. Quickly the girl crossed to the table, picked up a
box of matches then, with a squaring of her shoulders, she returned
to the wall.</p>

<p>Ahead, the footsteps were faint echoes.</p>

<p>Elizabeth gave a quick look around the room, then, slipping
through the panel, pulled it shut after her. The darkness was like
two hands pressed across her eyes. Cautiously she began to grope
her way forward...</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>After leaving Elizabeth alone in the Oak Room, Robert Ashton
returned to his own quarters. Locking the door he advanced to a
small bureau, unlocked a drawer and fumbled among the papers
inside. He selected an envelope and drew out a typewritten letter.
Although the secretary knew the words written there almost by heart
he re-read each syllable carefully. Then he shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said softly, "it can't be possible. Marsden's making a
bloomer. He must be confusing the two men." He gnawed his underlip
thoughtfully. "But, just say he's right! It'd turn the whole thing
upside down..."</p>

<p>A knock on the door made him turn. His voice was none too steady
when he called, "Who's there?"</p>

<p>Outside, a soft voice answered: "It's Reynolds, sir. I have a
message for you."</p>

<p>Ashton frowned. Reynolds was one of the footmen, a
smooth-voiced, softly walking creature. Instinctively, Robert
mistrust him, although he had spoken but half a dozen words to the
man. With a quick movement the secretary returned the letter to the
drawer, relocked the bureau and crossed to the door. As he opened
it, a man in his mid-thirties stood revealed. His light eyes and
thin fair hair gave his face an almost expressionless appearance.
He bowed slightly as Ashton faced him.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir, but Sir Anthony would like to see you in his
study."</p>

<p>"Business?"</p>

<p>Reynolds said smoothly: "I believe so, sir."</p>

<p>With a curt nod Ashton turned away, picked up his notebook and
made his way to his employer's study. He knocked and entered. The
baronet was at his desk, writing. He spoke without raising his
eyes. "Close the door, Ashton, and pull up a chair." Presently he
laid down his pen and handed across a document.</p>

<p>"I should like four copies made of that," he instructed. "One is
to be signed by myself, another by Blaire. You, as a witness, will
sign the third and the fourth is to be filed."</p>

<p>"May I read it now, sir?"</p>

<p>"It isn't necessary. Briefly, it is a statement in which I offer
Blaire ten thousand pounds for the sole rights of his petrol
formula."</p>

<p>Ashton's jaw dropped. "But&mdash;does Blaire know about
this?"</p>

<p>The baronet said testily: "Naturally, it has been discussed
between us."</p>

<p>"But, Sir Anthony, wouldn't it be wiser to wait and see what's
happened to that lad? For all we know he may be dead!"</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne shook his head. "I don't think so," he replied.
"It is my opinion that The Owl has kidnapped Blaire with the
intention of frightening him into giving up the formula. This
criminal evidently understands Blaire's temperament; he believes
that if he persecutes the young man enough, Blaire will be bullied
into yielding." The elder man cleared his throat. "At least, that
is Blackburn's opinion."</p>

<p>"Blackburn!" It was a snort from Ashton.</p>

<p>The baronet ignored the outburst. "Moreover," he said calmly, "I
have been talking with Inspector Read, who arrived a few minutes
ago. We discussed Blaire's disappearance, naturally. Read scoffed
at the suggestion that Blaire is dead. The Owl, he assured me, is
not a killer. A thief, an audacious and highly theatrical robber,
but not a murderer. The Inspector has had a dossier prepared on
this criminal. He has never shed blood before. Why, then, should he
begin now?"</p>

<p>Ashton folded the baronet's document with slow deliberation.
"May I speak frankly, sir?" he asked. "Neither Inspector Read nor
Blackburn have the smallest idea of what they're up against in this
case. It's bigger than they dream." He rose, note-book clutched in
his big fist. "You say that in his other robberies The Owl has
never attempted murder? Do you know why? Because he was only laying
a trail to the main objective&mdash;the acquiring of this
formula."</p>

<p>The baronet was lighting a cigarette. He paused with the
match-flame half-way to his lips. "What on earth do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Simply this!" The secretary drummed a finger on the desk to
emphasize his words. "All those robberies, successful though they
were, were relatively unimportant. They were necessary to build up
this personality of The Owl! The police were meant to go seeking a
theatrical robber, when the character of the real man was the
direct antithesis of this. The man behind the mask of The Owl is a
normal, everyday business man. What is more&mdash;that man is down
here under this roof."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" Atherton-Wayne raised thin brows. "What a pity we
don't know who it is."</p>

<p>Robert Ashton tensed his muscles like a man plunging into cold
water. He said steadily: "We do...that is, I think <i>I</i>
do!"</p>

<p>There was one of those hushed silences when all the world seems
to have paused, listening; the blank, timeless break between
thunder-clap and downpour when the very air hovers motionless. From
where he stood, Ashton could see tiny beads of perspiration forming
on the baronet's forehead, slowly, one by one, like a slow-motion
study. Atherton-Wayne was first to speak.</p>

<p>"Amazing, my dear Ashton, amazing!" He avoided the younger man's
eyes and, turning, crushed out the end of his cigarette in the
ashtray. "I had no idea you were so versatile. This would appear to
save us a considerable amount of bother." He was patting his
forehead with a folded handkerchief. "Er&mdash;just who is this
person?"</p>

<p>But the secretary shook his head. "It isn't as easy as that,
sir," he replied. "For one thing, I'm not sure. And even if I was I
haven't any proof. But it's only a matter of time. This chap's made
one stupid mistake and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words faltered on his lips. The secretary wheeled as a
slight click sounded through the room. He was just in time to see
the door closing. He swung round on the elder man.</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>His body tense, Atherton-Wayne was staring at the door. Then he
relaxed and gestured towards the half-open windows. "Probably just
a breeze," he murmured, but his eyes were thoughtful.</p>

<p>The secretary shook his head. "Couldn't have been the wind," he
muttered. "More likely someone to see you. Dr. Hautmann
perhaps."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. The baronet's mind seemed on other things. After a
pause he continued: If, as you say, the person masquerading as The
Owl is actually down here, is it wise to air your suspicions
so&mdash;er&mdash;publicly?"</p>

<p>Ashton's jaw protruded. "Perhaps I want him to know, sir."</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne said testily: "Really, Ashton, I cannot
understand you. Moreover, at the moment, I have neither time nor
the patience to try." He waved a slim hand in the direction of the
door. "Be good enough to let me have those copies before
lunch."</p>

<p>The secretary nodded. Returning to his own room he opened the
portable typewriter, set it on the stand and, drawing up a chair,
inserted paper and carbon. But his fingers did not touch the keys;
instead he sat hunched over the machine, plucking thoughtfully at
his lower lip. The thin, precise, almost effeminate handwriting on
the document before him recalled the baronet's words to his mind.
Was he really in danger? If so, it meant his suspicions were right.
And if this was so, then this thing was far too big for one person
to tackle single-handed.</p>

<p>What about Blackburn?</p>

<p>A shadow settled across Ashton's rugged face. Intuitively, he
was jealous of this newcomer. He realized that his fiancée was more
than just casually interested in this tall young stranger from
London. Well, he knew that streak in Elizabeth's nature that was
attracted to danger and excitement as steel filings fly to the
magnet. Blackburn epitomized all these things, plus charm and
physical attraction. Ashton, no fool in many things, knew that here
was good reason why he should dip his fingers in this murky broth
of trouble. If he, unaided, could tear the mask from the face of
The Owl, automatically would he assume importance in Elizabeth's
eyes. In his own way, Robert was genuinely in love with Elizabeth;
but quite apart from the tender emotions, it galled the big man's
obstinate nature to think that any outsider might poach on
preserves rightfully his.</p>

<p>On the other hand, all this went for nought if in attempting
this adventure he lost his life. "And if I'm right," muttered
Ashton, with an uncomfortable movement of his shoulders, "The Owl'd
no more think of wiping me out than he'd worry about crushing an
ant underfoot!"</p>

<p>Yes, on second thoughts, perhaps it might be wiser to talk to
Blackburn. The blighter had seemed quite a decent sportsman on the
one or two occasions Ashton had spoken with him&mdash;and it had
been rather handsome of him to take all the blame over that attack
on Hautmann. He'd explain the situation to Blackburn about
Elizabeth and all that, and then bring the conversation around to
his theory about the Owl. It would have to be worked very
delicately, of course.</p>

<p>With this resolution, the secretary attempted to dismiss the
subject from his mind. His eyes rested on the baronet's statement
and his thoughts revolved about a new axis. So Blaire had been
talked into selling his formula to Atherton-Wayne? It might have
been some special arrangement between them, but he could not help
thinking that ten thousand pounds seemed an extraordinarily small
sum for the sole rights of such a formula. Perhaps it was that Sir
Anthony had insisted that the invention actually belonged to him in
the first place. Ashton shrugged his shoulders and began to dance
his fingers over the keys of the typewriter. But scarcely had two
lines formed on the white paper when a knock came at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in," Robert called: He looked up as the door opened. Elsa
Hautmann stood there.</p>

<p>Against the dark background of the corridor with the sombre
oaken panelling, she looked radiantly lovely. With her corn-yellow
hair folded across a forehead like pale ivory, with her large,
slightly oval blue eyes and warm, scarlet mouth, she moved inside
like a living ray of sunlight, and the whole room seemed brighter,
larger, with her coming. Ashton rose quickly, conscious of the slow
tide of warmth that crept through his veins.</p>

<p>"Hello," he said. "What's brought you here?"</p>

<p>Elsa Hautmann's almond-shaped eyes rested for a moment on his
face in a glance soft as a caress. Then she dropped her long lashes
and the red lips contracted in a suggestion of a pout.</p>

<p>"I have come," she told him, "to say good-bye and thank
you."</p>

<p>"Good-bye?" Robert stared at her. "But&mdash;where are you
going?"</p>

<p>"To London."</p>

<p>The secretary frowned. "Your father's business takes you
away?"</p>

<p>Her slender, ringless fingers entwined nervously. She did not
raise her eyes as she spoke. "Sir Anthony has ordered that we
should go. When he found that my father came here only to buy Mr.
Blaire's formula he says we are to go." She looked up and he could
see those lovely eyes glistening. "And so I have come to say
good-bye to you, Bobbee."</p>

<p>"Never mind that for a moment!" Ashton, his brow puckered, bent
and picked up Atherton-Wayne's written statement. "Elsa, this is a
personal question, but its rather important. Do you know how much
Herr Hautmann offered Sir Anthony for the formula?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded. "Twenty-five thousand pounds," She replied.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five...!" The secretary paused, then: "Did Sir Anthony
tell your father that Blaire had already arranged to sell the
formula to Atherton-Wayne himself?"</p>

<p>Elsa Hautmann shook her head. "If Sir Anthony said that it is
not true..."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"It was only after my father and Mr. Todhunter had named their
prices that Sir Anthony decided he himself would become the highest
bidder."</p>

<p>Ashton muttered softly: "The highest bidder!" Then he addressed
the girl. "This Todhunter chap&mdash;what did he offer?"</p>

<p>"Twenty thousand pounds."</p>

<p>She was staring at her companion, a little wrinkle of
bewilderment between those smooth plucked brows. Ashton was pacing
the floor, one clenched fist drumming impatiently in the other.
Presently, as though acting on an impulse, he crossed and whipped
the sheet from the typewriter. Substituting another, he bent and
danced his fingers rapidly over the keys. Disengaging the paper, he
signed his name at the foot, blotted the signature and picked up an
envelope. He was slipping the folded note inside as he approached
the girl.</p>

<p>"Listen, Elsa," he said rapidly. "I've got to act fast, and
there's no time for explanations. Do you know where Mr. Todhunter
is staying?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded. "At the 'Green Man&mdash;'" she began, but the
other cut her short.</p>

<p>"Good! Now, I want you to find Blackburn and give him this note.
He's somewhere in the house&mdash;the servants will know."</p>

<p>"But where do you go?"</p>

<p>"Down to the 'Green Man.'" As he spoke, Ashton tossed aside the
sheet of paper he had been crumpling in his hand and reached for
his hat. He moved across to the long windows. "You'll know the
reason for all this when I come back," were his parting words. "In
the meanwhile, Elsa, get the note to Blackburn without delay."</p>

<p>Pulling his hat on his head, the secretary slipped through the
windows and made his way quickly across the lawn. Elsa Hautmann
stood watching his retreating figure. Her name rapped sharply from
the door made her turn. Dr. Hautmann moved into the room, closing
the door behind him.</p>

<p>"My dear child, what are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"Papa, I don't understand." In a few words she told him what had
happened.</p>

<p>That curious green pallor of Hautmann's face was more marked as
he spoke softly: "Did our young friend mention what price
Atherton-Wayne was paying?"</p>

<p>Elsa shook her head, then her eyes lighted. "One moment&mdash;"
she glanced swiftly around the room. "I remember Bobbee took a
piece of paper from this desk. Then he screwed it up and&mdash;ah!"
Quickly she pounced. Straightening, she handed the crumpled ball of
paper to her father. With unsteady fingers the doctor smoothed the
creased document, then tilted the surface to the light. There was a
pause. Then slowly Dr. Hautmann turned his head. Those dark eyes,
no longer hooded, blazed with hidden fire. His thin lips curved in
a cruel smile.</p>

<p>"This is interesting, Elsa. Sir Anthony becomes the highest
bidder...for ten thousand pounds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you offered twenty-five thousand pounds...!"</p>

<p>"Exactly!"</p>

<p>Elsa Hautmann shrugged slim shoulders. "Truly all English are
mad," she said. "First there is this. Then Bobbee hands me a note
to give to Mr. Blackburn and rushes out of the window like one
demented."</p>

<p>Hautmann said sharply: "A note for Blackburn?" He almost
snatched it from his daughter's hand. Ignoring Elsa's gasp of
astonishment, he calmly slit the envelope and extracted the folded
message. His eyes flickered over the typewritten words. When he
spoke his tone was that old soft purr.</p>

<p>"This time there is a method in the young man's madness." He
handed the note across. "Read that, Elsa."</p>

<p>The girl obeyed. The note was brief and to the point.</p>

<p class="letter">If you want to know the name of the person
masquerading as The Owl [Ashton had written], be in the library at
11 o'clock tonight. Come alone.</p>

<p>The secretary's boyish signature was scrawled across the bottom.
Elsa raised questioning eyes.</p>

<p>"Papa, what does all this mean?"</p>

<p>Hautmann was selecting a fresh envelope from the desk. He took
the note from his daughter's fingers, slipped it inside the
envelope and sealed the flap. "It means," he said smoothly, "that
you will find Mr. Blackburn and deliver the note just as you were
told. We must not obstruct the ways of justice, my dear Elsa."</p>

<p>"But, Papa, our packing...?"</p>

<p>Her father waved a dismissing hand. "Do not worry me with
trivialities, my child," he said curtly. "I have on my mind a more
pressing problem than our packing. Deliver your message and do not
worry your pretty little head about other things."</p>

<p>Underlying the soft tone was the hard edge of command. Elsa
Hautmann tucked the envelope in her pocket and moved towards the
door. She was reaching for the knob when her father spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Ashton say where he was going?"</p>

<p>Elsa nodded. "Down to the 'Green Man' in the village."</p>

<p>Dr. Hautmann rubbed thin hands together and in the silence it
was the sound of dead leaves rustling. "Indeed," he purred "He is a
very impetuous young man, that one."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Elizabeth Blaire had not been in that hidden passage two minutes
before she bitterly regretted her decision to follow Jeffery.</p>

<p>How far she had come she did not know. Never before had she
encountered such darkness. It was opaque, and it seemed to press
upon her from all sides, suffocatingly, so that she had to resist
the impulse to thrust it away with both hands. And in that blind,
black void not a sound broke the heavy stillness. Blackburn's
footsteps and the dim nimbus of his torch had long been swallowed
in an engulfing vacuum where day and night were as one.</p>

<p>Close at hand, a sudden sharp rattle sounded monstrously loud in
the silence. Elizabeth gasped; next moment she realized that she
held matches in her own trembling hand. She shook the box, gaining
comfort from the sound. Those thin slivers of wood were her weapons
to fight the all-embracing gloom that seemed to gather and coil
thicker and thicker every moment.</p>

<p>Even if she could find her way back she doubted if she could
have opened the panel again. Elizabeth clenched her hands and
fought down that rising tide of panic. There was only one thing to
do&mdash;go forward and trust to luck.</p>

<p>Cautiously, one hand sliding along the rough surface of the
wall, she groped her way. Floating webs passed thin caresses across
her shrinking face, unseen protuberances plucked at her dress and
more than once her feet stumbled on the uneven floor. Only one
thing she knew&mdash;the passage led downwards. It had cost her a
minor heart attack to learn this, when for one sickening moment the
passage disappeared beneath her and her feet tottered on the edge
of what appeared to be a bottomless pit. A hurriedly struck match
revealed a flight of rough steps, broken, mossy, dropping one by
one to heaven knew what terrors below.</p>

<p>Below, the air was dank and cool. Somewhere, far ahead,
Elizabeth imagined she could hear a trickle of water, but when she
paused to listen the blood drumming in her ears blocked out all
lesser sounds. Drawing a deep breath, she struck a match and held
it up. The suddenness of the glare blinded her for a moment, then
with that reluctant retreating of the darkness she saw ahead a bend
in the passage.</p>

<p>In that last bright flicker she had a glimpse of dark irregular
walls, blotched with damp and supporting a groined roof only a few
inches above her head. Then the light died, a tiny charred hook in
her fingers. As she stood undecided, from somewhere came a new and
unexpected sound&mdash;the dull clang of metal meeting stone.
Unexplained, yet it gave her new confidence. Someone else, friend
or foe, moved in that black silent world beneath the earth.</p>

<p>Forward again. Now all her senses seemed concentrated in the
tips of her groping fingers. Presently they encountered a rough
angle of the wall. This must be the bend. She negotiated it slowly,
foot by foot, eyes straining through the gloom for a relieving
pin-point of light. But she could see nothing. How much farther
must she feel her way? Fool that she was ever to leave the sunny
sanctuary of the Oak Room! And into her mind, unbidden, came the
memory of that hand, and of the broken blackened nails...</p>

<p>With a gasp, Elizabeth Blaire froze rigid as the walls about
her. In that moment her groping fingers had encountered something
new...soft and yielding to the touch. Her whole body tingled with
the shock of contact.</p>

<p>Someone, or something, was standing pressed up against the wall
a few feet away from her. Was it her imagination or could she make
out the dim white smudge of a face? Hardly daring to breathe, she
waited. In a dazed way she wondered if the unseen could hear the
pounding of her heart...</p>

<p>Five dragging leaden seconds passed.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Blaire felt her skin crawling. Somehow, in some way,
she must put an end to this mute ordeal. She moistened her lips and
worked her throat, but it was only after the third attempt that she
essayed a dry cracked whisper.</p>

<p>"Who&mdash;who are you?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>There is a limit to everything, even to terror. Suddenly,
Elizabeth felt a hot wave of resentment sweep through her. She
gritted her teeth. I'll see who you are, she resolved, arid almost
automatically, scratched a match across the box and thrust the
flame out into the darkness. Then she almost collapsed with
relief.</p>

<p>Robert Ashton stood there, watching her steadily.</p>

<p>"Bob! Oh, Bob!" The girl swayed a little, hand to head, half
laughing, half crying. "Bob, what on earth are you doing down here?
You great goose, you gave me a fearful shock!" She took a half step
forward. "How did you get down here, anyway?"</p>

<p>But why didn't he speak? Why did he continue to look at her with
that steady, wide-eyed stare? Was it a trick of the match-light or
did his eyes seem glassy?</p>

<p>"Robert!" Elizabeth said sharply. She reached forth her free
hand and touched him on the arm.</p>

<p>Not a muscle of Ashton's face moved. But slowly, with that
steady unwavering gaze straight ahead, he began to slip sideways.
In front of the girl's horrified eyes the body gave suddenly at the
knees and fell face downwards, limply, like a bag of washing.</p>

<p>The match burnt down to Elizabeth's fingers, flared and died.
That final glow was caught for an instant in the hilt of a knife
the blade buried deep between Robert Ashton's shoulders.</p>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>CHAPTER FIVE. "This was the
evening of the embarrassing scene in the library..."</h2>

<h3>SUNDAY, JUNE 16TH (CONTINUED).</h3>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, what of Blackburn?</p>

<p>Nobody had been more surprised than Jeffery when the panel in
the Oak Room had yielded under his fingers. As he slipped through
into that uninviting cavern, part of his mind was concentrating on
the way before him, partially revealed in the dancing gleam of his
torch. But other and more disturbing mental processes buzzed in his
head.</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne had assured him that no secret passage existed
inside Rookwood Towers. As evidence, the baronet had produced his
story of the antiquarians and their unsuccessful search. But why
should a party of experts fail when he, Blackburn, had found the
entrance to the passage almost at once? It was too fantastic to
call this chance. A mere tapping of the panelling had revealed the
cavity behind. Either the antiquarians were a set of blundering
duffers, which seemed highly unlikely, or else...</p>

<p>Or else they had discovered the passage, and Atherton-Wayne, for
some reason best known to himself, wished to keep the discovery a
secret.</p>

<p>Walking carefully, his eyes glued on that bright oval of light
sliding smoothly along the dark walls, Jeffery considered. If The
Owl was hiding at Rookwood Towers, what more likely place of
concealment than this dark tunnel? Was this the reason
Atherton-Wayne wished to keep its existence a secret? The momentary
suggestion that the little baronet himself might be The Owl was
dismissed by Jeffery as absurd. It smacked too much of melodrama.
And yet, what was this whole thing but melodrama personified? The
young inventor. The valuable formula. A criminal who wore the wings
and false face of an owl and could seemingly come and go at
will.</p>

<p>But what of the strange, disfigured hand that Elizabeth had seen
opening the panel? To whom did that belong? And what of the
striking Dr. Hautmann and his lovely daughter&mdash;where did they
fit into this grim riddle? And Mr. Todhunter, who was interested in
oil and came all the way from Detroit? Jeffery shook his head
irritably. There was too much secrecy here, too many dark
undercurrents. He was glad the Inspector had returned. As soon as
possible they must get together and demand an explanation of all
these things.</p>

<p>Until this audacious kidnapping of Blaire, Jeffery realized, the
hands of the investigators had been tied. Except for the attempt on
the young chemist's life in his cottage on the night of the party,
they had nothing to go upon except vague warnings and frightened
whispers. And even a bellicose individual as Read might well
hesitate to upset an august household as Rookwood Towers on such
scanty excuses. Atherton-Wayne was a man to be handled with gloves.
Jeffery sighed. If only something real and tangible would happen,
something that the investigators might grip upon, something that
would give the Inspector good reason for striding through this
house of secrets, letting loose the snarling efficiency of Scotland
Yard, cleaving the murky half-truth and dark suspicions that clung
thick as spider webs under this grey roof!</p>

<p>Abruptly, Jeffery stopped and sniffed the air.</p>

<p>For some seconds he had been dimly conscious of a new odour, a
more familiar smell that permeated the dankness of the tunnel.
Quickly the young man dropped his torch beam to the floor, swept it
about and then pounced with a soft cry of satisfaction. Holding the
torch close, he examined the object&mdash;a cigarette end, smoked
down to the last inch. And printed on the paper was the trade-mark
of a well-known brand of American cigarettes.</p>

<p>Todhunter! The name leapt to his mind at once. He clicked out
his torch and waited in the darkness. Or was it too obvious a clue?
After all, anyone in the house might smoke that particular brand of
cigarette. One thing, however, was certain. There was very little
ash on the cigarette and it was still smouldering, Someone had
passed this way only a few minutes before. Was it the owner of the
missing fingered hand, or was it someone he knew as a
guest&mdash;?</p>

<p>The thought snapped as a sudden sound in the passage ahead
caused him to freeze motionless.</p>

<p>Then it came again, the soft slow creaking of a heavy door
opening cautiously.</p>

<p>Walking gently as a cat, Jeffery crept forward. His outstretched
hands came into contact with a right-angle wall, a bend in the
passage. He was feeling his way around when a spurt of light, some
distance ahead, caused him to press back against the rough masonry.
Warily, he insinuated his head around the corner and stared with
narrowed eyes at the scene before him.</p>

<p>Not a dozen yards away a man stood holding a lighted match above
his head. Jeffery had a glimpse of a swarthy, bearded face from
which glared two fear-stricken, white-rimmed eyes. The figure was
dressed in a long overcoat that came almost to his ankles and his
feet were slippered.</p>

<p>The unknown peered right and left, turning that unkempt head
with quick bird-like movements. Then he lowered the match and with
his free hand began straining at an iron ring set in the wall at
shoulder height. Again Jeffery heard that reluctant creaking and he
realized that the bearded stranger was tugging at a heavy door set
into the wall. Then the match flared and died. As it did so, the
young man noticed the hand holding the light. The third finger was
missing!</p>

<p>Jeffery leapt forward, flashing on his torch. The unknown stood
transfixed in the sudden circle of light, staring as though
hypnotized. Then, with a cry, he flung one arm across his face,
turned and bolted like a rabbit down the stone passage. Jeffery,
who had paused opposite the stone door, heard his footsteps go
blundering away into the darkness.</p>

<p>Uncertain whether to follow, he stood hesitant. Then, from near
by, came a sound that rooted his attention&mdash;the soft choking
moan of a person in pain. Wheeling, Jeffery flashed his light up
and clown the corridor. It was empty. Then the sound was repeated,
seemingly right behind him. He swung round. The heavy door was
slightly ajar. He grasped the iron ring and, exerting all his
strength, tugged mightily. The door swung open abruptly, crashed
against the wall with a ring that echoed and re-echoed through the
passage and Jeffery flashed his torch inside. The next
moment...</p>

<p>"Good God!" he exclaimed softly.</p>

<p>He recognized Edward Blaire only by that swollen, purpling face
and bulging, pain-distorted eyes, for the figure on the stone floor
of that dungeon was so twisted by its bonds that it had no natural
shape. There was something horrible in that distorted motionless
figure, but it was not until Jeffery sprang to the young chemist's
side that he realized how diabolically cruel was this
imprisonment.</p>

<p>Blaire was lying on his stomach, the upper part of his body
expertly laced into a strait jacket. A thin cord was bound tightly
about his legs and feet, then pulled tightly to a noose around his
throat, so that the body was forced into an unnatural bow. It was
only when he bent low over the young chemist and saw more closely
the cord about his throat that a hot anger fired the blood in his
veins. The cord was a slip-knot, connected with the rope that bound
the feet. With every attempt to free himself, Blaire was slowly
tightening the cord around his swollen throat, automatically
strangling himself by slow and unutterably painful degrees!</p>

<p>Setting his torch on the floor, Jeffery pulled out a
pocket-knife and severed the cord between throat and feet with one
thrust. As Blaire rolled over, the other jerked at the wide bandage
about the young chemist's mouth. Spitting out a gag of material,
Blaire croaked hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Throat...cord...choking..." Then, as Jeffery's fingers eased
the pressure on the knot, the young man gulped the air like a
drowning man. "Blackburn...I...you..." his tongue floundered like
someone learning to speak. "Just in time..."</p>

<p>"Easy&mdash;easy," Jeffery said curtly. He was sawing through
the cord that bound the legs, then he turned his attention to the
strait jacket, ripping at the constricting folds with almost savage
pleasure. At length Blaire lay free. His first action was to
massage his throat into which the cord had bit a cruel scarlet
weal. Then he tried to stand, only to collapse against Jeffery's
arm.</p>

<p>"Pins and needles," he gasped weakly. "Give me a moment..."</p>

<p>"Easy," repeated Blackburn. Blaire clung to his arm,
straightening each leg gingerly. Then he stood alone, supporting
himself against the wall.</p>

<p>"My glasses," he said. "Somewhere on the floor." Jeffery found
them and handed them across. As Blaire was fitting the spectacles
in place, the other was gathering the strait jacket and ropes into
a bundle. Then he turned.</p>

<p>"Can you walk?"</p>

<p>Blaire nodded. "It's my throat that hurts." He stretched it and
gave a sudden gasp of pain. "God knows how long I've been here. It
seems weeks." His voice faltered, trembled. "I&mdash;I thought it
was the end this time, Blackburn."</p>

<p>"Steady," said Jeffery. He reached out an arm to the
near-fainting lad, when a sudden cry stiffened him. Somewhere away
in that dark maze, a voice charged with terror was crying:</p>

<p>"Jeffery! Help&mdash;Jeffery, where are you?"</p>

<p>The effect on Blaire was almost electric. His limp body
tightened as though pulled together on a string. "That's Beth's
voice," he cried. "Does that mean&mdash;she's down here?"</p>

<p>"God forbid!" Blackburn's face was as hard and as grey as stone.
He ran a quick glance over the other's dishevelled figure. "You'd
better wait&mdash;" he began, but the younger man brushed his words
aside.</p>

<p>"I'm not staying here alone," he said. "Besides, I want to know
what's happening to my sister!"</p>

<p>Side by side, they almost ran from the room. Outside, Jeffery
flashed his torch along the passage. As far as the light
penetrated, it was empty. As they paused, baulked for an instant,
Blaire muttered:</p>

<p>"I'll swear that voice came from down here! Is there another
passage?"</p>

<p>Then it was that Jeffery had a sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>"The turn-off," he cried. "She must have followed me down here
and lost herself in the dark."</p>

<p>Without further explanation, he gestured to Blaire to follow
him. Their footsteps threw up ghostly echoes as they ran. At the
bend, the tunnel forked. Over his shoulder Jeffery said curtly:
"This way."</p>

<p>Blaire was so close on his companion's heels that he almost
bowled Jeffery over as the latter halted suddenly, the beam of his
flashlight trembling slightly. They recognized the girl from some
distance away. Elizabeth Blaire lay in a heap where she had fallen
fainting beside the body of Robert Ashton.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>An hour later Chief Inspector William Read faced Jeffery in the
library at Rookwood Towers.</p>

<p>Blackburn had wasted no time in getting Elizabeth and her
brother back into the Oak Room, summoning the housekeeper to attend
to the girl, and seeking medical attention for Blaire, who by this
time was near collapse with the strain of his ordeal. Then he
brought the Inspector to the library and gave him a detailed
account of his sensational adventures. When he finished Read fixed
him with a gimlet eye.</p>

<p>"Well, young fella," he grunted, "a lovely mess you've made of
things. I leave you down here to manage the business and what
happens? Your charge gets himself kidnapped, The Owl moves about
the place like a star boarder and the whole schemozzle ends in a
bang-up murder! That," announced Read, "is just dandy! I can
practically hear the Commissioner congratulating me!"</p>

<p>Jeffery's tone was sullen. "What do you think I've been
doing&mdash;playing Kiss in the Ring?"</p>

<p>Read gnawed his moustache. His voice had the rumble of distant
thunder. "Do you know, I shouldn't be at all surprised!"</p>

<p>"Meaning just what?"</p>

<p>"Look here, son, I wasn't born yesterday. It took me just five
minutes down here to sum up the situation between you and this
Blaire woman." Hands in pockets, the big man faced the younger
sternly. "If anyone had told me that you were the man who caught
the Sheldon murderer and let the daylight into that business of the
Dolls of Death, I'd tell them to climb a tree!" Read's tone held
that official bark. "I'm telling you, son&mdash;the dumbest
flatfoot on the Petticoat Lane beat could have handled this thing
better than you."</p>

<p>Jeffery was silent for a moment. Then he muttered: "All right. I
have made a mess of it all. I must be getting old&mdash;the brain
cells are atrophying..."</p>

<p>"Getting old!" It was dangerously near a snort. "That's not the
trouble! You made a success of those other cases because son, you
didn't trip over any petticoats. You kept your mind on your work.
The real trouble is that you've gone moony-eyed over this Blaire
wench, and you can't think of anything else but moonlight and
roses. Bah!" Read turned on his heel and began to pace the floor.
"If I had my way I'd shove all pretty faces away behind
bars&mdash;and keep 'em there!"</p>

<p>Jeffery grinned in spite of himself. "Speaks the
misogynist!"</p>

<p>"This is no joke," snarled Read, turning. "When I saw you
carrying that girl out through the secret panel in the Oak Room,
with the love-light burning like Christmas crackers in your eyes, I
knew the cause of all this fuss!"</p>

<p>"Someone had to carry her out," snapped Jeffery. "You didn't
expect me to leave her in the tunnel?" He was aware that he was
blushing and to cover his embarrassment lit a cigarette. "Blaire
was in no shape to look after anyone but himself." He became very
interested in the end of his cigarette and spoke without raising
his eyes "Now, I suppose the best thing I can do is to get back to
London."</p>

<p>"Oh no, you don't!" The Inspector stood with his back against
the library door as if afraid Jeffery would bolt then and there.
"You're staying right here&mdash;on the spot."</p>

<p>"Is that an order?"</p>

<p>Read's tone softened.</p>

<p>"You don't have to take orders from me, son. But you can take
advice." He walked across and faced the younger man soberly. "This
thing isn't a bogey-man scare any longer, Jeff. Someone put four
inches of cold steel into that secretary chap. And we've got to
find out who it was before I'm asked for my resignation."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you've got to help me," Read went on quietly. "Forget this
girl for a while and buckle down to some solid work. I need you on
this case, son. It promises to be one of the toughest things we've
ever tackled. Later, when we clean up all this mess, if you still
feel the same about this girl:..." a shrug of Read's big shoulders
completed the sentence.</p>

<p>Jeffery flicked half an inch of ash into the ebonite tray. "When
I think of Ashton's end, it seems almost indecent to consider the
subject."</p>

<p>Read thumped one hand in the other, a gesture of irritation.
"There's the biggest snag," he barked. "Why should that secretary
be rubbed out? What's the motive for his murder?"</p>

<p>Jeffery felt in his pocket and extracted a folded note. "Here's
the reason," he replied. A frown gathered on the Inspector's brow
as he read the note Ashton had scrawled to Jeffery earlier in the
day.</p>

<p>"So he thought he knew the name of The Owl, eh? And judging by
what happened, he was pretty right!" Read looked up. "Where did you
get this, son?"</p>

<p>"Elsa Hautmann gave it to me about ten minutes ago," Blackburn
told him. "She said Ashton asked her to deliver it to me. Then he
went out into the grounds, saying he meant to call at the inn at
the village." He paused, considering. "As far as I can make out,
that would be about a quarter of an hour before his death."</p>

<p>Read was plucking at his moustache. "Then this fräulein was the
last to see him alive?" And as Jeffery nodded, "What do you make of
those two, son?"</p>

<p>The younger man's tone was sombre. "I don't know, Chief. People
in this house are covering each other&mdash;that's the whole
trouble. For instance, I'd give anything to know what went on
during that interview between Hautmann, Atherton-Wayne and
Todhunter."</p>

<p>"Todhunter?" The Inspector frowned. "Who's he?"</p>

<p>In a few words Jeffery explained how Atherton-Wayne had received
the American in his study that morning. "I got out before our
friend came in," Blackburn went on, "so I can't even tell you what
he looks like. But I'd give anything to know what brand of
cigarettes he smokes."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Blackburn told of the finding of the smoked stub in the tunnel.
As he concluded, Read swore softly. The big man's eyes glinted.
"There's too much jiggery-pokery going on in this house," he
snarled. "We're going upstairs in a few minutes to get young
Blaire's story. Then, after dinner, I'll get my boys to corral the
entire household here in this room&mdash;and I'll grill 'em all
green!" Scarlet danger signals were flying high in the Inspector's
cheeks. "I've been wanting to do this ever since I stepped inside
the place, but I hadn't the authority. But this murder's changed
that, and I'm going to get some tongues wagging, or, by hokey, I'll
know the reason why!"</p>

<p>Jeffery said mildly: "You'll be careful, Chief. Atherton-Wayne's
a very influential man, you know."</p>

<p>Read's face was hard. "Murder's a great leveller, son. And our
killer friend has been hiding behind the respectability of this
house too long. He's been getting away with things under our very
noses. That business of the strait jacket, for instance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Didn't you get that?"</p>

<p>The Inspector shook his head. "When the boys went into that
passage to bring out Ashton's body, I gave Connolly and Armstrong
instructions to collect it from that room. Well, they found the
room all right, but it was empty."</p>

<p>Jeffery clicked his tongue. "I should have brought it away with
me, but so many things happened at the one moment down there...You
know, Chief, it's rather ironical that just as we were going about
assuring everybody The Owl wasn't a killer, he was planning to shut
Ashton's mouth by the most efficient means."</p>

<p>"That's what worries me, son. I've got a nasty feeling at the
back of my mind that this business is only beginning." Read's face
was hard. "If you ask me, up till now The Owl's just been playing
with us. He's been deliberately building up this masquerade of a
harmless, though rather theatrical sneak-thief. But Ashton's
discovery forced him to show his real self."</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded. "And there's the fiendish way he trussed up that
lad. A knife between the shoulders is cowardly, but it's clean
compared to the torture of slow and deliberate strangulation.
Blaire must have suffered so much I'm almost dreading asking him
for all the details of the attack."</p>

<p>"We'll treat him gently," the Inspector promised. "Meanwhile,
I'm wondering what's happened to Armstrong and his boys. I set 'em
to comb that tunnel and rout out that gent with the missing
finger&mdash;" He broke off as a knock sounded at the door. It
opened and Dennis Connolly walked into the room.</p>

<p>Detective Connolly was a big moon-faced Irishman, but at the
moment his natural geniality seemed under a cloud. His first words
made the reason plain. "No luck, Chief," he reported.</p>

<p>Read said curtly: "What happened?"</p>

<p>"We&mdash;Armstrong and myself&mdash;took half a dozen of the
boys down into the passage," Connolly told him. "Where the tunnel
forks, Armstrong took three men and went one way, I went the other
with the rest of the boys. Armstrong says that his passage led down
into the vaults. Nothing there. Just big stone rooms, crumbling
away."</p>

<p>"What about the passage you explored?"</p>

<p>"We followed it for about two hundred yards, to find it blocked
with an iron door. Caked with rust and studded with iron bolts it
was&mdash;looked as though it hadn't been opened since Doomsday,
except..."? Connolly paused and rubbed his broad jaw&mdash;"when I
examined the hinges, they'd been freshly oiled. Looks a bit fishy,
eh, Chief?"</p>

<p>"I'll say!" Read snapped. "What did you do?"</p>

<p>Connolly shrugged. "It'd have taken a blow torch to get through
the door without the key. There wasn't anything else to do but come
back here."</p>

<p>"No sign of our black-bearded friend?" Jeffery asked.</p>

<p>Connolly shook his head. "But I'll wager a month's salary we've
found his hide-out. What's more, someone in this house must be
looking after him. All we have to do now is to find out who that
person is and that part of the show's cleared up neat and
tidy."</p>

<p>Read considered a moment, plucking at his clipped moustache.
Then he squared his shoulders. "All right," he said briefly. "Now,
here's your next job. I want every person under this roof&mdash;and
that includes the domestic staff, mind you&mdash;here in the
library after dinner. The only exception is young Blaire&mdash;his
presence depends on what that doctor says. Everybody else, do you
understand?"</p>

<p>Connolly nodded and a slow grin spread across his face. "A
little pep talk, eh, Chief?"</p>

<p>"That'll do!" Read barked. The big detective turned, closed one
eye significantly at Jeffery and walked towards the door. As he
swung it open, there was a quick movement outside. A man was rising
swiftly to his feet. The Chief Inspector roared like an angry
bull.</p>

<p>"Hey, you!"</p>

<p>The man approached, pushing past the astonished Connolly.
Jeffery, watching closely, noticed how quietly the newcomer walked.
He halted opposite the Inspector, who looked him up and down.
Then:</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>The man said softly: "My name is Reynolds, sir. I am one of the
footmen here."</p>

<p>Read took a step forward and thrust his face almost into the
other's expressionless countenance. "You were listening at that
door, weren't you?"</p>

<p>The servant dropped his eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir. Really, I assure you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't lie, man! You had your ear glued to that keyhole!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, no, sir." There was shocked reproach in the tone. "I
was sent here by Dr. Newbury. I heard voices in this room&mdash;I
didn't wish to disturb you, so I waited..." Reynolds' pale eyes
flicked for a moment across Read's granite face. "When the door
opened so suddenly, it took me by surprise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll bet it did," began the Inspector, when Jeffery
interposed.</p>

<p>"You say Dr. Newbury sent you here?"</p>

<p>The footman turned a smooth face to the speaker. "Yes, sir. The
doctor asked me to say that Mr. Blaire has had a short sleep and
feels much better. If you gentlemen wish to talk to him, could you
come along at once?"</p>

<p>Jeffery glanced at the elder man, who nodded. Read dismissed the
servant with a wave of his hand. "And next time you listen at
keyholes," he rapped, "be a bit smarter about getting up! That's
all."</p>

<p>The man was almost to the door when Jeffery spoke again. "Oh,
Reynolds!" and as the servant turned: "Would you bring me that
silver ashtray from the reading table? And you might empty this
one&mdash;it looks rather a mess."</p>

<p>With an inclination of his head the servant obeyed. As the door
closed behind him, Jeffery sprang up. Whipping a handkerchief from
his breast pocket he folded it carefully about the silver ornament,
then handed it to the astonished Inspector.</p>

<p>"Chief," he said. "Get this to headquarters as soon as you can
and have Craven dust it for prints. Then check up on 'em."</p>

<p>Read, staring at the younger man, took the folded cambric almost
mechanically. "What's the idea, son?"</p>

<p>"It may be my nasty suspicious mind," Jeffery told him, "but I'm
sure I've seen that man's face before. And, somehow, it's connected
with surroundings that restricted his freedom rather more than
Rookwood Towers." He nodded towards the ashtray. "Hence the
prints."</p>

<p>The Inspector grunted and slipped the object into his pocket.
"Do you know, son," he said, "I do believe you're coming out of
that trance at last. What next?"</p>

<p>Jeffery buttoned his coat. "While the mood is on me," he
suggested, "why not have our interview with young Blaire? Perhaps
the divine inspiration may visit the me again!"</p>

<p>It was a very chastened Edward Blaire who faced the two
investigators in his bedroom on the second floor. A sedative had
calmed his twitching nerves, but the countenance that stared across
the bed was as white as the pillows that supported his head. Dr.
Newbury, a big red-faced country G.P., stood aside to allow Jeffery
and Read to pass, then paused with his hand on the door.</p>

<p>"Ten minutes," he said. "No more and no less. And if you excite
my patient too much, then heaven help him, because I can't!"</p>

<p>As the door closed Jeffery pulled up a chair while Read lounged
against the edge of the bed. Blackburn pulled out his case and
offered it to the younger man. Blaire took the cigarette and as
Jeffery applied a light he puffed thankfully. Then:</p>

<p>"I'm giving up," he said briefly. "I'm as brave as any man
alive, but I'm no match for a murderer. The Owl can have the
formula&mdash;he can take it with pleasure if it means an end to
this reign of terror." His voice dropped. "Ashton...there's no
chance...?"</p>

<p>Jeffery shook his head slowly. "Not a hope. He was dead when we
found him."</p>

<p>The cigarette in Blaire's hand trembled slightly. "Who's next?
It might be any of us! The formula's valuable, but it's not worth
bloodshed! This murdering swine can take it whenever he likes!" His
voice rose, high and thin with the edge of hysteria. "Do you hear
me, wherever you are? Take the formula! Take it, and leave us
alone!"</p>

<p>"Steady, son." Read put out a hand and gripped the young man's
shoulder. "That's not the way to behave. Can't you see that's what
he's trying to do&mdash;scare you into giving in?" Under his hand
he felt Blaire's tightened muscles relax and the tide of colour
faded slowly from his face. "Now, son, get out of your mind that
this Owl is a supernatural bogey-man. He's a nasty individual with
a red streak of murder running through his brain, but at least he's
human. You must know that yourself." Blaire's voice was none too
steady when he replied: "Yes. He was flesh and blood all right.
Blood particularly." The faintest suspicion of a smile lingered
about his lips for a moment. I punched him in that beak and made
his nose bleed.</p>

<p>"You did?" It was Jeffery who put the sharp question. "What
happened then?"</p>

<p>Read waved a restraining hand. "Let's start this thing from the
beginning," he suggested. "All we know is that you were in your
room on the next floor with the door locked. Then Blackburn and
your sister heard a scream and when they unlocked the door you were
gone."</p>

<p>Blaire was staring at the smoking end of his cigarette, his eyes
shadowed with the memory of that night. "Yes," he said slowly. "I'd
had a few words with Betsy over&mdash;over something." As though
recollecting, he looked up. "My sister&mdash;Betsy&mdash;she was
down in that passage, too."</p>

<p>"Your sister's all right," Jeffery assured him. "She'll be up
and about tomorrow. Go on with your story."</p>

<p>The young man leaned back and closed his eyes. "When Betsy left,
I felt all on edge," he began. "I had a couple of drinks to
straighten myself up, then sat down at my desk to work out some
figures. But I must have fallen asleep. When I woke it was dark. I
sat very still for a few seconds, trying to recall what had
happened. Then I reached up and switched on the desk-light. For
some reason or other I felt unaccountably jumpy. I remember
starting to help myself to another whisky, but the bottle was
empty. Then I just sat there listening...the house was very
quiet..."</p>

<p>His voice trailed away. Jeffery did not speak. Vivid in his mind
was the picture of the frightened boy, sitting alone in that room
in the silent old mansion, while outside the shadows coiled and
thickened about the windows. After a pause Blaire continued:</p>

<p>"How long I sat like that I don't know, but it was a sound that
roused me. A slow creaking, so soft that it was difficult to tell
from what direction it came. I jumped up and, crossing to the door,
switched on the room lights. The sound came again and this time I
located it. The door-handle was turning, slowly, cautiously. I
still don't know how I acted so fast, but there was a key in the
lock and I literally sprang and turned it. I was near sweating with
fright. With the locking of the door the sound stopped. I could
almost hear my heart panting. Then, as I stood hesitating what to
do, there came that tapping on the window."</p>

<p>An inch of ash dropped from his cigarette Blaire wiped it away
nervously, leaving a grey trail of smudge on the white counterpane.
To Jeffery, it seemed that the room had grown smaller, as if the
very walls about them edged closer to listen. Read cleared his
throat with a cough like a bark. The sound seemed unnaturally loud
in that hushed apartment. When Blaire spoke again his voice was
low, almost as though he was afraid of other ears overhearing his
story.</p>

<p>"I can't hope to make you understand how terrifying that tapping
sounded. Then I realized that the window was on the third
floor&mdash;it was therefore impossible that any human agency could
be responsible for that sound. It was, I told myself, a tendril of
ivy blown against the pane by the wind. There were heavy curtains
drawn across part of the window and it seemed to me that they
bellied slightly, as when a breeze moves them. That was surely the
cause. Some careless servant had left a window open&mdash;and the
thought gave me courage. I crossed to the curtains and swept them
aside. And then gentlemen...there was The Owl, motionless, waiting,
swathed in that long black cloak, a dead thing save for the eyes
that blaze down at me through the slits in that horrible beak-like
mask!"</p>

<p>The words choked in the young man's throat as his voice ran dry
with fear at the memory. Read, nearest the wash-basin, poured a
glass of water and handed it to the man in the bed. Blaire barely
sipped it, but his voice was steadier as he went on.</p>

<p>"I just stood there, frozen, paralysed. Then, with a screech I
shall remember to my dying day, this creature pounced on me. He had
a pad of something white in his hand and as we struggled he tried
to press it over my nose. This knowledge gave me a sort of
desperate strength&mdash;with all my force I hit out at that
terrifying mask. The man behind it gave a grunt of pain as my fist
connected and I saw the blood stream down his black gown. And
that's the last thing I do remember, because next minute he had
that chloroform pad over my face. I have a vague memory of being
lifted, then of ivy brushing against me and then steps and more
steps." He paused and raised his eyes to Jeffery. "And when I came
to I was down in that black room, trussed and choking, just as you
found me."</p>

<p>As he paused, Jeffery clicked his fingers. "So that's how The
Owl took you from that room!" He rose and began to pace the floor.
"He climbed up the ivy and on to the roof. It was only one floor,
anyhow. Then he probably took you down the fire-escape to the
vaults. It would have been child's play, with the darkness to cover
him."</p>

<p>Read's thoughts were taking a different track. "So you made his
nose bleed, eh?" He stood teasing his clipped moustache. "Then if
that skunk is someone in this house, he ought to be quite easy to
trace. You can't cover a bruised nose very easily."</p>

<p>"You'll never find him." Blaire's tone was heavy with despair.
"There's only one way to end this persecution&mdash;let him have
the formula."</p>

<p>From the window, Jeffery spoke:</p>

<p>"Tell me, Blaire, how long has the footman Reynolds been down
here?"</p>

<p>The other looked slightly irritated at the apparent irrelevance
of the question. "Can't say off-hand," he replied. "Three or four
months, I believe."</p>

<p>Jeffery merely nodded. It was Read who made the observation. "If
this lad marked The Owl's face, that's one step forward."</p>

<p>"In what direction?" Jeffery snapped. "Backwards, I should say.
Because, with the exception of a few of the downstairs staff, I've
met everyone under this roof during the last twenty-four hours. And
I didn't notice any marked faces among them."</p>

<p>Read was frowning. "Then, son, it looks as if we've got to the
stage of looking for an invisible man."</p>

<p>And in that moment, had they but known it, the whole truth,
fantastic as it was, lay within their grasp. All unwittingly the
Inspector had voiced a suggestion that was to prove, later,
strangely prophetic. Perhaps Jeffery alone felt some prescience.
Read noticed him blink suddenly and pass his hand before his eyes,
like a man blinded by a dazzling light. The big Inspector opened
his mouth to speak, but the sound of a gong vibrating along distant
corridors was heard, and the familiar resonance jerked Blackburn
back to normal.</p>

<p>"Come along, Chief." His tone was curt. "We've done all we can
here. And man must eat though the mind starves." He turned to
Blaire, who was lying back on his pillows with half-closed eyes,
seemingly exhausted by his recital "You'd better take things easy
for a while," he advised, "and we'll ask Dr. Newbury to step in
here as we go down to dinner."</p>

<p>Read grunted his approval and the two men left the room.
Rounding a bend in the corridor, they sighted Connolly coming
towards them. The detective's face flushed. He spoke as the two
approached.</p>

<p>"I gave 'em all your order about getting down to the library
after dinner, Chief." He fell into step beside them. "People in
this house have funny notions about a murder investigation. They've
got an idea, some of 'em, that it's a sort of picnic."</p>

<p>Read grunted. "Stubborn?"</p>

<p>"The old chap and that square-head doctor were the worst,"
Connolly added darkly: "But they'll be there, all the same!"</p>

<p>"Good! Now, here are two more jobs to be attended to straight
away. Send a couple of the boys down to the 'Green Man' and tell
them to rope in a Mr. Charles Todhunter, staying there. Have them
bring him back here tonight."</p>

<p>Connolly nodded.</p>

<p>Read felt in his pocket and produced the wrapped ashtray. "Get
this up to the Record Office at once&mdash;I want it dusted and the
prints checked. Don't send Armstrong or Mason." The Inspector's jaw
protruded slightly. "I want them down in the library after dinner
with me. I'm going to do some pretty plain speaking down there and
they may be needed to read the riot act."</p>

<p>The tall clock in the corner of the library struck the hour of
nine.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that there were only seven people in the room,
the wide apartment held that hot, tight feeling of a crowded
auditorium. The little group gathered under the book-lined walls
was presided over by a silver-haired and coldly furious Sir
Anthony, who had appealed to Blackburn to spare himself and his
guests the indignity of being cross-examined in front of the
domestic staff. Read had consented with reluctance, finally
deputizing Connolly to interview the servants.</p>

<p>Sir Anthony stood with folded arms under a fading portrait of
the former owner of the Towers, disapproval in every rigid line of
his slender figure. Dr. Hautmann, his pale saturnine face
expressionless, stood by a chair in which his daughter sat. Elsa
Hautmann's slender body was swathed in a white close-fitting
evening gown that accentuated the spun gold of her hair. She sat
with head bowed demurely; only now and then did she raise her eyes
to where Blackburn's tall figure lounged by the desk. In a chair
opposite, young Blaire sat. Only the ceaseless drumming of his long
fingers upon the upholstery revealed the nervous excitement pent up
within him.</p>

<p>Reynolds, the smooth-faced footman, fidgeted uneasily near by.
His eyes never left the Inspector who stood, stern as Rhadamanthus,
in the centre of the room, his narrowed eyes flitting from one face
to another.</p>

<p>Read said brusquely:</p>

<p>"There's no need for me to tell you why you people have been
gathered here tonight. You know as well as I do that shortly before
lunch today a young man was murdered under this roof. It was a
pretty climax to a lot o' funny happenings inside these walls. This
bogey-man stuff upset a few people, principally Mr. Blaire here,
seeing that he was the focal point of it all. But there's a big
difference between threats to murder and the actual commission of
the crime. For one thing, it gives us a chance to get a lot of
things straightened out that we couldn't touch before. That's why
you're all down here tonight."</p>

<p>He paused and swept a glance around the room. It took in a
succession of white faces, uneasy eyes and fluttering uncertain
hands. But there was no sound in the room but the tick of the clock
and the rattle of a coal falling in the log fire, burning
undisturbed and aloof in the big fireplace.</p>

<p>"It's difficult enough to investigate a murder when all the
facts are open to discovery," the Inspector continued. "But it's
well-nigh impossible when truth is distorted and evidence
deliberately withheld." His eyes narrowed. "And I charge various
persons in this room of having deliberately withheld information
from my department which would aid us in the clearing up of this
mystery."</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne stared at the big man with cold, hostile eyes.
"Aren't you being a little fantastic, Inspector?"</p>

<p>Read squared his shoulders. "Perhaps I could answer that
question if you'd be frank with me, Sir Anthony. Yes, you're one of
the people we feel could help us more if you chose." He wheeled on
Hautmann, who stiffened, watching the Inspector closely under those
heavy lidded eyes. Jeffery had the impression of a snake coiled to
strike. Read said gruffly: "And you, Doctor, what's your business
down here?"</p>

<p>"That is rather a personal matter, sir."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't accept that as an answer."</p>

<p>Hautmann took a step forward, leaving his daughter staring up at
him. "You really want to know the reason I am down at Rookwood
Towers, Inspector? Very well." The slight pause was deliberately
theatrical.</p>

<p>"I am down here to prevent Atherton-Wayne cheating Mr. Blaire
out of fifteen thousand pounds!"</p>

<p>There was a sudden naked quivering silence in the room, a
concentrated electrification of the atmosphere that was almost too
tense to be borne. Every eye in the room flashed to the little
baronet, who stood like a man turned to stone. A slow tide of
scarlet crept across his chiselled face. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>"I can only conclude, Hautmann, that you have taken leave of
your senses!"</p>

<p>The doctor swung round. "Don't deny it," he said harshly. "You
deliberately withheld from Blaire the fact that Todhunter had
offered twenty thousand for his formula! You said nothing of my
offer of twenty-five thousand! Instead, you took advantage of
Blaire's kidnapping to trick him into signing away the formula to
you for a paltry ten thousand pounds!"</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne's colour deepened. He panted slightly as he
spoke. "It's a lie! I demand that this man produce proof of his
outrageous accusation!"</p>

<p>"You mean that?"</p>

<p>"Most emphatically!"</p>

<p>Hautmann shrugged. "Very well&mdash;if you wish to humiliate
yourself further..." The doctor took from his pocket crumpled
statement he had retrieved from Ashton's study and handed it across
to the Inspector. "Read that," he invited. "I do not think Sir
Anthony will be foolish enough to deny his handwriting."</p>

<p>In silence, Read took the statement and nodded to Jeffery, who
crossed and examined it over the other's shoulder. Blaire,
meanwhile, sat staring at the baronet like a man hypnotized,
Presently Read looked up.</p>

<p>"This is your handwriting, sir?"</p>

<p>Sir Anthony nodded.</p>

<p>"Then what Dr. Hautmann tells us is true?"</p>

<p>The bones in the baronet's face had gone suddenly hard and
prominent, the face of a man who stares upon disaster. Quickly he
passed a tongue across his lips. Jeffery, watching that
countenance, could almost see the nimble brain ticking feverishly
behind it. Save yourself! Save your face! Do anything anything, but
save your face in time. Atherton-Wayne drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"Yes, Inspector, I wrote that document. At the time, however,
circumstances were different. Now I realize the whole thing was a
mistake."</p>

<p>Dr. Hautmann caressed thin hands. "Rather a fortunate mistake, I
should suggest. Particularly as Ashton was the only witness you
had, Sir Anthony. With that young man&mdash;er&mdash;out of the
way, there was really nothing to prevent Blaire from signing that
paper."</p>

<p>Before the baronet had chance to reply, Blaire had sprung to his
feet, eyes blazing behind his spectacles. His hands clenched by his
sides as he faced Atherton-Wayne.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you'd do this to me?" The words were thick in his
throat. "After I've kept to my part of the bargain, given my energy
and ability without stint, existing on a mere pittance, this is the
kind of thing you do!" Almost beside himself with anger he raised
his hand. "God! If you were a younger man, I'd have it out with you
in a way you wouldn't forget!"</p>

<p>"Here! No rough stuff!" Read stepped forward and pushed the
angry young man back into his chair. "We're not going to get
anywhere coming to blows." He addressed the baronet. "Well, Sir
Anthony, it looks as if you're in rather an awkward position. What
have you got to say?"</p>

<p>Conscious of every eye upon him, Atherton-Wayne drew himself up.
Even at this juncture, Blackburn was conscious of the queer power
that flowed from the man, a magnetism that could not be denied. The
baronet spoke quietly.</p>

<p>"I realize that this is one occasion on which actions speak
louder than words. Dr. Hautmann&mdash;" he flashed a contemptuous
glance over his shoulder "&mdash;has accused me of swindling Mr.
Blaire of fifteen thousand pounds. My answer to this charge is that
I am prepared, here and now, to pay Blaire the sum of fifty
thousand pounds for the sole rights of his formula!"</p>

<p>Again that silence. Blaire whispered, "Fifty thousand..." and
the words fell into the hush like pebbles tossed one by one into a
dark pool. Hautmann gave a little bitten-off gasp of amazement and
sat down on the arm of his daughter's chair as if his legs had
suddenly weakened. Only Reynolds, that curious person, remained
unmoved. His face expressionless, he gave the impression of being
as aloof from this scene as the flames that muttered in the
fireplace. Then Blaire spoke again, blinking up at the baronet.</p>

<p>"Are you&mdash;" he stumbled over the words "&mdash;are you
prepared to give me that amount...now?"</p>

<p>Sir Anthony did not reply. He crossed to the desk and, taking
cheque book and fountain-pen from his pocket, wrote rapidly. The
thin scratching of the pen was audible to everyone in the room.
Then, with a gesture that was a challenge, he ripped the cheque
from the book and handed it to the wide-eyed young chemist.</p>

<p>"I will expect your sample of the formula, together with the
full data on its manufacture and other notes in your possession, to
be lodged within my safe tonight," he said icily. "In the
meanwhile, I shall have an agreement drawn up for you to sign." He
wheeled, addressing the room at large: "Now may I presume that this
rather embarrassing incident is closed?"</p>

<p>No one spoke, for no one knew quite what to say. The baronet's
gesture, so calmly executed, had robbed even the Inspector of
comment. Dr. Hautmann was first to break the silence. He rose and
bowed.</p>

<p>"Surely you are fortunate, Sir Anthony, in that your money will
buy practically everything." He paused, and his thin lips curled.
"I am wondering, however, if it will buy you immunity from The Owl
now that you, in turn, have come into possession of this apparently
dangerous secret?"</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne deliberately averted his eyes from the speaker.
"That is a subject I prefer to discuss with the police. And now,
Dr. Hautmann, you will oblige me by leaving this house with your
daughter and depart on the first train in the morning."</p>

<p>"Oh no!" The Inspector hunched his shoulders aggressively.
"There's been a murder committed under this roof. No one leaves
this place until I give them permission." He turned as
Atherton-Wayne started a protest. "Sorry, sir," he said curtly,
"that's the way things are worked, you know."</p>

<p>The baronet stared at him almost insolently. "Do you honestly
mean to infer, Inspector, that I am in danger of arrest for the
murder of my secretary?"</p>

<p>A lesser man might have quailed before those cold blue eyes, but
not a muscle of Read's face moved as he returned the other's stare.
He said almost woodenly, "No one's mentioned arrest, sir."</p>

<p>"I still say you have inferred it. I warn you, Mr. Read, that
you will regret any constriction of our liberty in this house. I
shall most certainly complain to the Commissioner. What you suggest
is virtual imprisonment. In any case, you have no grounds for such
an action."</p>

<p>From his corner, Jeffery spoke for the first time: "I think sir,
that we have."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Your own conduct, if I may say so, might even be termed
peculiar."</p>

<p>"My conduct!" Those cold eyes swept over Jeffery. "There is
nothing in this house I wish to conceal."</p>

<p>Jeffery took a step forward so that he came shoulder to shoulder
with Read. "Not in this house, perhaps, sir. But I was thinking of
the vaults under the house."</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne's head jerked back like a man receiving a blow.
His whole body seemed to sag and he put a hand to a chair to steady
himself. Jeffery's eyes never left his opponent's face, but Read,
alert, saw a curious expression cross Reynolds' pale visage; he
could have sworn that, for an instant, a malicious smile lingered
about the colourless lips. Then the baronet spoke and his words
were a whisper:</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Jeffery said quietly: "Don't you know?"</p>

<p>The baronet said huskily: "This is persecution&mdash;brutal
persecution! I warn you&mdash;I shall complain." Almost wildly, he
brushed the two investigators aside and walked quickly from the
room. Read made a movement after him, but Jeffery, laying a hand on
his arm, shook his head.</p>

<p>As the baronet's footsteps died away in the corridor, Dr.
Hautmann addressed the Inspector, "I take it that this interview is
at an end?" and as Read nodded, the doctor gave his arm to his
daughter. Obediently, Elsa Hautmann rose. With slow dignity the
pair left the room. Reynolds, avoiding the big man's eye, followed.
When the door closed behind them, the Inspector turned to
Blaire:</p>

<p>"You'd better get some rest, son&mdash;that's if you can rest
with fifty thousand tucked away in your belt."</p>

<p>Blaire rose and approached them. "That's what I want to speak to
you about," he said. "Will you take charge of this money until I
can get to town tomorrow?" He gave a half-glance over his shoulder.
"After what's happened today, I couldn't sleep with that amount in
my room."</p>

<p>"Why, sure!" Read took the slip of paper and tucked it into his
waistcoat pocket. "We'll look after it for you, son. You hop off to
bed." He addressed Jeffery: "Funny we've heard nothing from those
boys who went down to pick up Todhunter. I'd like a few
words&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's that?" interrupted Blackburn sharply.</p>

<p>Read turned. Below the desk, plain against the pattern of the
carpet, lay a small white envelope. Jeffery pounced on it. The
Inspector was beside him as he slit the flap and extracted a folded
piece of paper.</p>

<p>A single sentence was printed roughly across the white surface.
The words danced before their eyes.</p>

<p class="cpi">"Atherton-Wayne will follow Ashton."</p>

<p>The message was signed:</p>

<p class="cpi">"The Owl."</p>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>CHAPTER SIX. "The housemaid asked
the Chief to find her white rabbits were missing..."</h2>

<h3>MONDAY, JUNE 17</h3>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The death of Robert Ashton caused an amazing acceleration of
events at Rookwood Towers.</p>

<p>It was as though the knife buried between the secretary's
shoulders was a stick poked into an anthill. On the morning
following the scene in the library, Inspector read rose early,
breakfasted and moved his hand to the telephone. The subsequent
message reached out into the heart of that sprawling building on
the Thames Embankment, up to a department known as the Central
Record Office. Wires hummed, lights flashed, machines began to
tick, fingers flicked on files. A certain Assistant Commissioner
was interviewed and, even as the group of cowed servants were
preparing for another day at the Towers, the Criminal Investigation
Department took over The Owl murder case in earnest.</p>

<p>The little village of Tilling had never known such a morning.
Sleek black cars, filled with broad-shouldered men and driven by
uniformed constables, surged into the hamlet, sweeping the dust
into gaping eyes, leaving behind a smell of petrol gas and a
bewildered but excited throng of locals. An institute in the
village had been turned into a mortuary, where delicately fingered
medical men probed and peered at the body of the secretary, brought
from the Towers in a black van. And then came the gentlemen of the
Press, with orders verbal, telephoned and telegrammed. They came
with pencils sharpened at both ends, with cameras like wide-awake
inquisitive eyes. They came by motor-cycle, by car, even by
push-bicycle, ready and willing to record both truth and gossip,
while miles away in London editors kept pages "open," compositors
were talking of bold Bodoni type in which to fling the obituary of
the victim across the front page.</p>

<p>Alas for Sir Anthony's dislike of notoriety! "The Owl Murder,"
as the Press dubbed the tragedy, had all the components of good red
meat for the reading public, and the little baronet might as well
have attempted to stay the rising sun as to hide from the slowly
creeping spotlight of publicity that was already being focused on
that rambling old mansion in the whispering trees.</p>

<p>While at the house itself, chaos was come.</p>

<p>Like some huge mechanical robot, the Criminal Investigation
Department strode through the corridors, bullying, cajoling,
flattering, asking endless questions, taking innumerable
photographs, measuring distances, testing locks, weighing,
calculating, noting, docketing&mdash;a tough-fibred, thick-skinned
army, obedient to nothing save the barking commands of a big,
florid-faced man who stamped the passages tugging at his grey
clipped moustache.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Ten o'clock was striking when Chief Inspector Read called
Connolly to the small room in the west wing that he had
requisitioned as an office. The detective, entering, announced the
arrival of the finger-print expert.</p>

<p>"Don't bother me about that," Read snapped. He was poring over a
plan of the Towers, obtained from some obscure source. "You know
what he's to do. Work on that knife first." He raised his eyes.
"The only finger-prints I'm interested in are the ones on that
ashtray we sent to town. Any report from Mallalue yet?"</p>

<p>"I rang through this morning," Connolly reported. "They're going
through the files at once."</p>

<p>"Any report from the 'Green Man' about Todhunter?"</p>

<p>Connolly shook his head. "All we know is that he went out
yesterday morning and hasn't shown up since. But he hasn't skipped
for good."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"His luggage is still in his room."</p>

<p>Read chewed his moustache. "We'll give him until this evening,"
he announced. "Then, have one of the boys go through his bags. That
might give us something."</p>

<p>The detective was looking at the plan on the desk. "What are you
doing about that chap hiding in the vaults, Chief? Do you want the
boys to smoke him out?"</p>

<p>"No." Read tapped the paper before him. "I'm getting down to
that now. We're satisfied that Atherton-Wayne's got a finger in
that pie somehow and it means walking carefully. As it is, I'm
taking a big risk turning the place into a monkey-house like this.
We've only got to guess wrong once and that little cock-sparrow'll
have the Commissioner down on me like a ton of bricks!"</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Chief?"</p>

<p>"Give him one more chance to tell the truth. If he's still
stubborn, I'll get a locksmith over from the village and we'll rip
that door open in two shakes." Read's tone was truculent. "Have you
seen Blackburn this morning?"</p>

<p>Connolly nodded. "He was talking to a couple of the boys in the
garden about ten minutes ago."</p>

<p>Read turned back to his plan, smoothing it on the desk. "You
might tell him to slip in and see me as soon as he can," he
suggested. And as the detective turned to go: "Just one other
thing, Dennis. Young Blaire's got my permission to go into town
this morning and cash Atherton-Wayne's cheque. You might put
someone on his tail, unobtrusively, of course." He waved aside the
question that rose to his companion's lips. "No, we've got nothing
at all on the lad, but we can't be too careful. This case is
getting so that I'm beginning to suspect myself!"</p>

<p>When the detective had gone, Read pulled a cigar from his
pocket, bit the end, lit it and puffed smoke reflectively. He
pushed aside the plan of Rookwood Towers and picked up another
sheet of paper. Six names were written on it. Read's chair creaked
as he leaned back and studied the list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Sir Anthony Atherton-Wayne.<br>
Elizabeth Blaire.<br>
Edward Blaire.<br>
Dr. Heinrich Hautmann.<br>
Elsa Hautmann.<br>
Reynolds.</p>

<p>These were the individuals mixed up in this chronicle of
robbery, fear and murder. Six people, under the same roof as he,
any of whom he could arrest at an order. Which one? Was The Owl
among these six people or was he an outsider working alone from
some isolated base as yet undiscovered? An outsider! The Inspector
chewed his cigar to the corner of his mouth, reached forward,
picked up a pen and added a name:</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%">Charles Todhunter.</p>

<p>"We are seven," muttered Read grimly. The phrase seemed to amuse
him and he chuckled.</p>

<p>At that moment Jeffery walked in. He wrinkled his nose at the
fug in the room, for Read had a strong taste in cigars.</p>

<p>"What's the game?" inquired Jeffery. "Smoking a herring?" He
crossed to the window and threw it open.</p>

<p>The Inspector clutched at the papers on his desk as the breeze
fluttered them.</p>

<p>"Didn't you have enough fresh air in the garden?" he
grunted.</p>

<p>Jeffery ignored the remark. He returned to the desk and took a
chair.</p>

<p>"I've come here," he told Read, "partly because you wanted me
and partly for sanctuary. You've let all hell loose out there. You
can't talk without stepping on a bloodhound!"</p>

<p>The Inspector leaned back and folded his arms across an ample
chest.</p>

<p>"Well, son," he observed, "we've tried your airy deductions and
mental processes. Now we'll see what some good, dyed in the wool
spade-work 'll accomplish."</p>

<p>Through the open window, Jeffery could see two beefy gentlemen
cross-examining a gardener. He shrugged. "You still think this
wholesale invasion necessary?"</p>

<p>His cigar protruding aggressively, Read sat bolt upright.</p>

<p>"Necessary?" he snarled. "Now, you listen to me, son. You know
what sort of a reputation we were getting down here? Last night one
of the serving maids waylaid me in the corridor. It seems that two
white rabbits she'd been keeping for her young brother had got
loose." Read waved a finger across the desk. "And, damnitall, she
had the sublime nerve to suggest that I put somebody on to finding
them!" A splay hand thumped his chest. "Me&mdash;Chief Inspector
William Read, asked to look for a pair of white rabbits!"</p>

<p>But Jeffery had risen from his seat and was staring at the elder
man, his eyes alight, his lips apart.</p>

<p>"Oh, my aunt!" he said softly. "Oh, my glorified, sainted
aunt!"</p>

<p>"I'll say it's your sainted aunt," the Inspector grunted. "That
was the final straw! I don't care whether Atherton-Wayne's the
closest friend of the Grand Duke Ferdinand of Lithuania! I went
straight away to ring the Commissioner and put the whole thing
before him. And now perhaps we'll get somewhere!"</p>

<p>Jeffery, seated again, stretched his legs and smothered a yawn.
"Quite right, Chief," he admitted. "All this hearty activity makes
me feel thoroughly ashamed. Are you aware I've only just got up
from breakfast? I wonder if it was the maid who brought in the
coffee&mdash;I mean, the one who spoke to you about her
rabbits?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?" The Inspector's tone was short. "Perky
little piece with red hair, it was." He glowered across the desk
and his tone dripped sarcasm. "Of course, you would have taken down
all particulars and made a sort of case-history of the
business!"</p>

<p>Jeffery's eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"We can't afford to ignore the slightest possibility, Chief," he
said with mock reproach. "After all, there is a definite connection
with this case. Isn't an owl supposed to prey on rabbits&mdash;or
is it young lambs?" He lit a cigarette. "That's the worst of being
a town-dweller. One's natural history becomes so rusty."</p>

<p>Very deliberately, Read took the cigar from his mouth, leaned
both hands on the desk and stared at the younger man.</p>

<p>"What's up with you this morning?" he demanded. He swept on
before the other could open his mouth. "I haven't worked with you
for the past three years without knowing the signs and portents,
son." The Inspector stood up, clamped his cigar in his mouth and
barked: "You're on to something, eh?"</p>

<p>Mr. Blackburn nodded calmly.</p>

<p>"As you say, Chief, I'm on to something. As a matter of fact, it
was something that happened last night."</p>

<p>"Well, come on. Out with it."</p>

<p>"Oh no!" Jeffery shook a dogged head. "You've tried all my airy
deductions and mental processes. And you've gently but firmly
deposited them all in the ash-can! You'd rather try some good dyed
in the wool spade-work." He paused to blow a smoke-ring. "A very
laudable decision, too. Go ahead, Mr. Read. You take the high road
and I'll take the low road..." The gentle banter dropped abruptly
and he rose. "And if I don't clap the handcuffs on The Owl before
you, I'll give a banquet for every Jew in Whitechapel!"</p>

<p>Surprise and resentment struggled for mastery in Read's face. It
was a very testy old gentleman who snarled:</p>

<p>"We're very sure of ourselves, aren't we?"</p>

<p>"No, Chief." Jeffery's tone was sober. "Not sure by any means."
He leaned over and crushed out his cigarette. "You know what I feel
like at the moment? A lost person, walking on quicksands towards a
tiny flicker of light in the distance. It's just the faintest
pin-point in the darkness, and I have only to take one step in the
wrong direction and&mdash;" he snapped his fingers in the air.</p>

<p>Read was staring at the other, the cigar smouldering unheeded
between his fingers.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, son," he muttered, "what are you hinting
at?"</p>

<p>The answer was a sharp rap at the door. It opened to admit a
small, foxy individual whose keen black eyes flicked around the
room. Read barked:</p>

<p>"Well, Armstrong, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Woman outside to see you, Chief," the detective announced. "Dr.
Hautmann's daughter."</p>

<p>Jeffery raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"The lovely Elsa?" he murmured. "Now what can she want?"</p>

<p>Armstrong stood with his hand on the door.</p>

<p>"Says she has information about something that happened in the
night. Will you see her now or will I tell her to come back
later?"</p>

<p>Read glanced at Blackburn, who nodded briefly. "All right. We'll
see her now."</p>

<p>Both men were conscious of a change in Elsa Hautmann the moment
she stepped into the room, although they could put no name to it
until later. Outwardly she appeared the same, tastefully dressed,
slow-moving and graceful, so that Jeffery was reminded of a summer
breeze stirring a field of ripe wheat. But that air of
self-possession bordering on arrogance was somehow lacking, and her
face was curiously blank, as though the light had gone from it. She
stood by the door, uncertainly, twisting a muslin handkerchief in
her slender, ringless fingers.</p>

<p>Jeffery, sensing her diffidence, said gently: "You wanted to see
us, Miss Hautmann?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded. She took a half step forward. As she moved into
the bright glare from the window, he could see her face more
clearly and his eyes narrowed. That Elsa Hautmann was oppressed by
some brooding anxiety was only too plain. Dark rings about her
eyes, which even skilful make-up could not conceal, told of a
sleepless night, and there were new lines about her mouth. She
stood looking from one man to the other and the fingers that teased
and twitched the handkerchief were trembling slightly. Suddenly she
wrinkled her nose like a child about to cry, and the words poured
forth in a turbulent spate.</p>

<p>"This is a horrible place. You must let us go&mdash;my father
and I&mdash;do you hear? You must let us go! All this that goes on
here&mdash;it is nothing to do with us&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing!
Do you understand?"</p>

<p>Jeffery set a chair in place. "Sit down, Miss Hautmann," he
invited.</p>

<p>She did so, gingerly, sitting upright as though ready to spring
to her feet any instant.</p>

<p>The young man smiled. "Now what's the matter? You can tell us.
And I promise we'll listen and help you in every way we can."</p>

<p>He was watching her as he spoke. As though conscious of that
unflattering light from the window, Elsa Hautmann pulled her chair
a little to one side. Then she relaxed more comfortably. Those
long-lashed eyes rested for a moment on Jeffery's face.</p>

<p>"Please do not think I am silly," she said. "But all this I am
not accustomed to. Policemen coming into my room, asking this and
that, taking my photographs and making funny eyes at me. I am not a
criminal. I have done nothing wrong..."</p>

<p>Read leaned his arms on the desk. "If you're unfortunate enough
to be staying in a house where there's been murder committed, you
must expect these things. We're all sorry if you're being put to
any inconvenience, and if you've any definite complaint about my
men, I'll investigate it at once and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Elsa interrupted. She shrugged slim shoulders. "They
are doing their duty, yes. But the days go by and nothing is done
about this&mdash;this Owl creature. The place is filled with
policemen&mdash;and yet he comes and goes just as he chooses."</p>

<p>Read's face hardened. "I assure You, miss," he said brusquely,
"that we'll soon put a stop to his comings and goings."</p>

<p>"Ach!" The girl almost spat the harsh ejaculation. "Talk, talk,
talk, just like a big bull-frog!" Her tilted eyes, glinting green,
fixed themselves on Read's slowly crimsoning countenance. "Do you
still talk big when I tell you that The Owl was here last
night?"</p>

<p>"What's that?" The Inspector was on his feet. "The Owl
here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. In the garden, very late. Perhaps after
midnight."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>Elsa Hautmann's fingers tightened in her lap. She passed a tiny
pink tongue swiftly over coral lips.</p>

<p>"I saw him." The words were almost inaudible.</p>

<p>Read, black brows drawn, was staring down at her. But if his
face mirrored surprise, the expression on Jeffery's face was almost
witless.</p>

<p>"Oh no," he murmured, almost in entreaty. "Oh no, it couldn't
be!" and he shook his head like a man waking from a dream. With
something like a bound, he left his place at the window and sat
down on a corner of the desk, looking full into the girl's
face.</p>

<p>"Miss Hautmann, are you telling the truth?"</p>

<p>Her eyes never left his own. She said simply: "Dear God, why
should I lie?"</p>

<p>"Tell me what happened last night. Everything!"</p>

<p>The fair head nodded. "Last night, after what has happened in
the library, I go to my bedroom. I am very tired, although it is
not ten by the little clock by my bed. I kiss my papa good night
and lock my door, as papa tells me. And no sooner am I in bed than
I fall asleep."</p>

<p>The slow even tones, with their slightly guttural edge, paused.
Jeffery, in the act of selecting a cigarette, offered his case, but
she shook her head.</p>

<p>"I sleep for an hour&mdash;perhaps two&mdash;I do not know. Then
I am awake, and it is bright moonlight outside. For some time I lie
there, but never have I felt more wide awake. So I switch on the
little light by my bed and look at my clock. It says ten minutes
past ten. That is impossible. But it has stopped. Because I am so
tired I forget to wind him that night.</p>

<p>"Then I think I will wait for the big clock in the tower to
strike. But it seems I lie there for hours and there is no
sound&mdash;nothing. Now I am really awake, so I get up and the
moonlight takes me to the window. Outside it is too beautiful to be
real. There is a kind of silver over everything and if I put out my
head, I can see one wing of the house, all dark except for a
lighted window. Into this I can see. It is Mr. Blaire's room and he
is reading in his bed. Then I think that I, too, will put on my
light and read my book. But it is so lovely by the window and I
have never seen moonlight so bright. And then&mdash;then I see
it!"</p>

<p>As she paused, Elsa Hautmann gave a little movement of shrinking
back into her chair. Something of the terror she had experienced
communicated itself to the two listeners, and Jeffery, always
sensitive to impressions, felt a tingling of his skin. Read was
watching her with narrowed eyes, his mind working. Either this
woman was a superb actress or this whole thing mad, ugly and
dangerous...</p>

<p>"As I watch, I see one of the moon-cast shadows move. At first I
think it is the branch of a tree, waving in the wind. But there is
no wind. Then it moves again and something steps out into the
moonlight. I can see only a long black cloak trailing across the
grass. It moves forward softly, like a cat, then it stops, then it
moves forward again. It goes from shadow to shadow, but as it steps
out into the moonshine I see it is carrying something..."</p>

<p>"Something?" prompted Jeffery.</p>

<p>"All I can see is something white, with no shape and not big.
The shadow slips across the lawn to the little lily-pond near the
glass-house. I can hear a soft splash. Only once do I see this
creature before it goes among the dark trees. But the white thing
is gone."</p>

<p>Read nodded slowly. "Popped it in the lily-pond, eh?" He turned
to his companion. "Jeff, would you get Connolly on to dragging that
pool straight away?" He raised his voice after Blackburn's
departing figure. "Tell him to bring whatever he finds in here."
Then he addressed the girl.</p>

<p>"Miss Hautmann, when you saw this happen, why didn't you give
the alarm?"</p>

<p>She looked up. "But I tried to," she said quickly. "I put on my
dressing-gown and go to Mr. Blackburn's room. It is but two doors
away from my own. I knock, but there is no answer. Then I grow
afraid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Afraid for Jeff?"</p>

<p>Elsa Hautmann shook her head. Her eyes widened. "No, but for
myself. The house is so silent. The passages so dark. I think of
what happened to Mr. Ashton. And as I stand there, it seems that
there are queer shapes all around me. So I run back to my room,
afraid, and lock the door and cry into my pillow. And I can sleep
no more that night."</p>

<p>Her voice quivered. There were tiny pearls of tears on her
cheeks, and she dabbed furtively with the slip of muslin. So
woebegone and childlike did she seem in that moment that Read,
sentimentalist at heart, thawed at the sight. He came around the
desk and patted the girl on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"There now, Miss Hautmann," he said gruffly. "Don't let's have
you breaking up about it. It's a pretty raw time for all of us, but
you don't make it any easier by going to pieces." He paused
awkwardly, conscious of the banalty of his words. "Now, you just go
to your room and lie down and have a nice cup of tea."</p>

<p>Elsa Hautmann rose and flashed him a grateful smile. "Please,"
she said primly, "I am sorry I called you a bull-frog. You forgive
me?"</p>

<p>The Inspector turned away. "Forget it," he grunted. "We all lose
our heads at times." The girl reached out slender fingers and to
Read's profound embarrassment, she gave his horny hand a warm
squeeze. The next moment she was gone from the room.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be damned!" gasped William Read, and his colour was
still high when Jeffery returned. The Inspector made great business
of relighting his cigar as the young loan took the recently vacated
chair.</p>

<p>"Connolly's on the job now," he announced. "We'll soon know if
the lovely Elsa was telling the truth."</p>

<p>Read tossed a burnt match-end through the window. "What do you
think of her story, son?"</p>

<p>"One part of her tale was authentic," the young man returned.
"Blaire certainly sat up reading most of the night."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"For the simple reason he kept me awake, too." Jeffery grinned
at the bewilderment in the other's face. "It's no enigma, Chief.
Young Blaire buttonholed me in the corridor last night and asked me
if I'd do him the favour of sharing his room. He frankly admitted
he was afraid to sleep alone, particularly after the finding of
that note in the library. So I turned in on the divan in his
bedroom." Jeffery stretched. "The young blighter talked to me half
the night and kept the light on reading for hours. That's why I
slept in late this morning."</p>

<p>Read's face cleared. "So that's why you weren't in your room!"
He explained Elsa Hautmann's excursion to Jeffery's apartment, and
barely had he finished when a knock came to the door. It opened to
admit Connolly. He was carrying a muddy bundle, dripping wet. The
detective crossed and held it up to view.</p>

<p>"Got it without any trouble at all," he announced. "Where do you
want it, Chief?"</p>

<p>Read was clearing the papers from his desk. "Just here, Dennis,"
and, as the other deposited the bundle before his superior,
"that'll be all for the moment."</p>

<p>Jeffery was eyeing the stained parcel. "Looks as if we might
have misjudged the lady after all," he commented. Reaching out a
hand, he weighed the bundle. "Surprisingly heavy. Wonder what's
inside?"</p>

<p>The Inspector was taking a pocket-knife from his waistcoat.
"We'll soon know," he grunted. "Hold it steady, son." He sawed at a
string which gave abruptly; the wrapped bundle unrolled and
something fell with a clatter to the floor. Read's face was a study
in surprised disappointment.</p>

<p>"Two pieces of rock," he muttered. "Now, what's so mighty
incriminating about that?"</p>

<p>Jeffery said calmly: "Relatively unimportant&mdash;except as
weights." The Inspector turned, to see his companion holding an
irregularly shaped piece of canvas material. "This is the
incriminating evidence The Owl wanted to conceal. Recognize it
Chief?"</p>

<p>Read's eyes glittered. "By hokey, I do! That's the strait jacket
that disappeared from the vaults yesterday!"</p>

<p>"Exactly! The strait jacket that imprisoned young Blaire."
Jeffery's tone reflected his rising excitement. "No wonder our
mysterious friend wanted to get this out of his possession." In his
agitation, he shook the garment in Read's face. The action
dislodged a soft pulp of material which had been clinging to a fold
in the canvas. The Inspector pounced on it almost before it reached
the floor.</p>

<p>"What's this?" With eager fingers, he was picking at the
water-soaked ball. It fell apart, half a dozen squares of fine
cambric, now stained and ruined by the slime of the pond. It was
Blackburn who identified them.</p>

<p>"They're part of this outfit," he announced. "Blaire was gagged
with a wad of handkerchiefs. It's a pity..." but the words died on
his lips.</p>

<p>Read had thrust the corners of three handkerchiefs under his
nose. "Take a look at that!" he barked.</p>

<p>Embroidered in each corner in a certain fanciful design were two
letters. A double A entwined. Jeffery gave a slow whistle of
astonishment and tossed the strait jacket into a corner.</p>

<p>"You know, Chief," he remarked, "somehow, I don't think
Atherton-Wayne will be writing to the Commissioner after all."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The clock in the tower was striking ten-thirty when Sir Anthony
Atherton-Wayne entered his apartment in the south wing, closed the
door and turned the key in the lock.</p>

<p>A stocky shadow passing the window drew his attention. He
crossed and stood watching, partly hidden by the heavy drapes.
Outside, two thick-set men were kneeling in the gravel path
flanking the lawn; one was measuring with tape, the other writing
in a note-book. The baronet wrinkled his nose in disgust and
dragged the curtains together with a jerk that was almost
vindictive. He returned to his desk and sat down, thin fingers
teasing thinner lips, eyes staring vacantly out across the
room.</p>

<p>A deferential tap on the door roused him.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he said sharply.</p>

<p>Through the stout oak, a muffled voice announced: "Reynolds,
sir. May I speak with you?"</p>

<p>"No, you may not!" Sir Anthony returned. "Go about your
duties!"</p>

<p>The voice persisted. "That is what I wished to see you about,
sir. I will only detain you a few moments."</p>

<p>With an irritable shake of his head, Atherton-Wayne crossed to
the door, turned the key and threw it open.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he snapped.</p>

<p>Reynolds moved inside and closed the door behind him. Sir
Anthony's eyes widened a trifle and his thin brows were raised.</p>

<p>"This would appear to be a very private conversation," he
observed coldly. Reynolds stood, fingers entwined, looking at his
employer without speaking. There was something curious about his
attitude that the baronet could not understand. The humility in the
servant's manner seemed more marked than ever, but Atherton-Wayne
would have preferred to read the face. But Reynolds, either by
accident or design, was standing in a shadow thrown by the draping
curtains. At length, the baronet said testily:</p>

<p>"Come, come, my man! What is it?"</p>

<p>Reynolds said: "It has occurred to me, sir, that the tragic
death of Mr. Ashton has left you without a secretary." He paused as
his employer nodded curtly. "I am wondering if you would consider
me for the position."</p>

<p>"God bless my sour!" Atherton-Wayne stared at the servant as if
he were some strange freak strayed into the room. "Really, my good
man..."</p>

<p>The other shrugged. "I assure you I have the highest
qualifications."</p>

<p>Sir Anthony turned away. Picking up a long pencil from his desk,
he twisted it in his fingers. "I am not even faintly interested in
your qualifications, Reynolds. Indeed, I feel that your suggestion
borders dangerously on impudence!"</p>

<p>"Oh no, sir."</p>

<p>"Moreover, I know nothing whatever about you. Surely you must be
aware that the position of my secretary is only open to a person of
proven integrity and constant discretion."</p>

<p>In the shifting shadows of that room the servant's face was like
a pale mask seen under running water.</p>

<p>"I assure you, Sir Anthony, that I can be the soul of
discretion. When the police cross-examined me this morning, I was
most careful to avoid even the slightest mention of the murder of
Colonel Pearson in that Bayswater apartment house five years
ago..."</p>

<p>A brittle crack sounded through the room. The pencil between
Atherton-Wayne's fingers splintered and fell soundlessly on the
carpet. The baronet spun round and his face was that of a man who
looks upon death. He swayed a little as he tried to speak, but only
a dry croak came forth.</p>

<p>"Reynolds&mdash;you..." he choked, and was silent.</p>

<p>The servant bowed his head. "I can quite understand you being
upset, sir. It would be most embarrassing if that case were
recalled just at the moment."</p>

<p>By his sides, Atherton-Wayne's hands clenched and unclenched.
His eyes avoided that grey man in the shadows. "What&mdash;what do
you want?" he said huskily.</p>

<p>"Surely I made that clear, sir?" The deferential tone was edged
with mockery. "I am applying for the position of your secretary,
made vacant by Mr. Ashton's unfortunate death."</p>

<p>"In other words, those are your terms?"</p>

<p>Reynolds inclined his head. "You will find me a wry efficient
secretary, sir. And I am sure the appointment will
be&mdash;er&mdash;to our mutual advantage, shall we say?"</p>

<p>The baronet took a handkerchief from his sleeve and patted his
forehead. For a moment he hesitated, then he turned away. "Very
well. You leave me no option in the matter."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. I need not detain you longer." Reynolds moved
to the door. "I think you will find me a most efficient secretary,
Sir Anthony. Much more valuable than poor Mr. Ashton." He paused as
Atherton-Wayne turned.</p>

<p>"Naturally," he continued smoothly, "because of that increased
value I fear I may be a little more expensive than your former
secretary. Thank you, Sir Anthony." The door closed and he was
gone.</p>

<p>For some seconds the baronet remained staring at the portal,
then he shrugged his shoulders as if to dislodge something that
crouched there. He turned and, as though recollecting something, he
glanced at his wrist-watch. The tiny hands pointed to
eleven-forty-five. Atherton-Wayne nodded, as though making up his
mind and, crossing to a panel in the wall, opened it swiftly. A
small wall-safe was revealed. Sir Anthony's fingers worked the
combination, pulled open the door and extracted a small wooden box.
Carrying this carefully, he made his way back to the desk. Seating
himself, he opened the box and took out a small phial of colourless
liquid. Holding it between thumb and forefinger he stared at it
thoughtfully. There was an expression of indecision on his face. He
had the air of a man faced with two important issues, one of which
must be chosen. Suddenly his face cleared and, reaching for the
telephone, he dialled a number.</p>

<p>The seconds ticked by. In that silent room the muffled burring
of the ringing signal, at the other end, sounded tinnily. Then it
was broken and a voice crackled through the receiver.</p>

<p>"This is Atherton-Wayne," the baronet announced. "Would you put
me through to Berlitski? And hurry, please; it is most urgent!"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>In her room, Elizabeth Blaire lay in bed, turning over in her
fingers a long envelope the maid had handed her with the
breakfast-tray.</p>

<p>The girl had by no means recovered from her ordeal in the
passage. But she had only a vague recollection of events following
her unnerving discovery. Incidents returned fleetingly; the
blinding light in her eyes as she staggered back through the panel,
supported by Jeffery, into the Oak Room; the gentle hands of the
motherly housekeeper undressing her; Dr. Newbury's anxious face and
the bitter tang of a potion on her lips. And then the cool
smoothness of sheets and pillow as she snuggled deep down and sleep
laid thin dark veils, one by one, across her aching brain.</p>

<p>A drugged slumber, heavy and dreamless, claimed her until the
maid entered, throwing back the curtains and filling the room with
morning sunlight. The servant had bobbed respectfully, placed the
breakfast-tray on the little table by her bed and retired.
Elizabeth, half raising herself, had noticed a letter propped up
against the silver teapot. She sat up, still only half-awake and
took the envelope. It had apparently been delivered only that
morning; plain across the stamp was the post-mark "London," then,
as she lowered her eyes, she realized that her name and address
were in the handwriting of Robert Ashton.</p>

<p>In that moment the events of the past night flooded back into
her mind. Her eyes rested on that so-familiar calligraphy for a
moment, then the outlines blurred in the tears that misted her
eyes. Bob's writing. Dear, lovable, slow-thinking, stolid Bob.
Little pictures came crowding back into her mind, irrelevant images
like the tiny bald patch that showed pink on the crown of his curly
pate, the worried wrinkle between his eyes as he wrestled mentally
with a problem, the dependability of him, typified in the way he
stood, feet planted firmly, head thrust just a little forward. That
was how she had first seen him, she remembered, twelve months
before. She had come down to the Towers to a party her brother was
giving in his cottage and had noticed this sturdily built young man
watching her with interest. He had caught her eye, given that shy
half-smile and then, rather haltingly, requested a dance. He was a
surprisingly good dancer.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob, Bob!" she whispered brokenly, and groped blindly under
the pillow for her handkerchief.</p>

<p>She realized that she was going to miss him more than she had
ever imagined possible. In that forlorn moment she knew that the
very thing about him that tended to irritate her, his prosy
matter-of-factness, was the solid rock to which she had
unconsciously clung in the dark tides that washed about her. At
that thought, she cried anew. It did her good. Slowly the ache in
her heart lessened, to be replaced by another and bitterer
sentiment, the determination never to rest until she had performed
what part she could in avenging this cowardly murder of a good
man.</p>

<p>So busy had been her thoughts that she had forgotten the letter.
Now she picked it up. Evidently the missive had been posted from
the Towers to the city (she recognized the crest on the stationery)
and then re-mailed from there. Why? With slightly trembling fingers
she slit the envelope, extracted the sheet of paper and began to
read. The communication was hurriedly written in Ashton's big
sprawling hand and it was dated the previous day.</p>

<p class="letter">Dearest Betsy (the letter began),<br>
<br>
I am sending this communication through the post because I dare not
trust it to anyone under this roof and I cannot, as circumstances
are, give it to you myself. Don't think I'm an alarmist, but as I
hinted to you this morning, this business of The Owl goes far
deeper than anyone suspects. In fact, now that I have the full
details worked out, it frightens me very badly&mdash;and you know,
Betsy, I'm not the type that frightens easily.<br>
<br>
Now, you know my nature only too well. I'm not brilliant, but once
I got my nose down to something the old bulldog isn't in it. I've
worked this whole thing out, partly from some chance information
that came my way and partly from things I've seen and heard in this
house. And I must be right! When you read what I've written in the
other envelope, your first thought will be that I've gone stark,
raving mad. But when you see how everything fits together, you'll
know you've been a witness to one of the most amazing criminal
plots of modern times.</p>

<p>Elizabeth put the letter on one side and peered into the long
envelope. There was an enclosure inside. She extracted it and her
eyes widened a little as she read the words written across one
corner.</p>

<p class="letter">To Elizabeth Blaire. To be opened only in the
event of my death.</p>

<p>With a puzzled shake of her head she turned back to the
letter.</p>

<p class="letter">I've known you long enough to be certain of your
courage and initiative, so I feel sure you won't do anything silly
when I tell you this. Somehow or other, The Owl has guessed that I
know the truth. Therefore, he's going to stop at nothing to shut my
mouth before it's too late. Now, I'm pretty capable of taking care
of myself, but if by chance something should happen to me I want
you to open that envelope, read what I've written and take it
straight to Blackburn. Is that clear?<br>
<br>
And now, Betsy, I pray you'll never have to open it. I only hope
that I'll be by your side when you receive this letter and that I
can explain it all personally. But should anything go wrong, well,
we've had some mighty good times together, you and I, times that
were worth a great deal to me. And so, good luck, dearest!<br>
<br>
Yours affectionately,<br>
Bob.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Blaire remained staring at that letter for a long
time. Then slowly she folded it and pressed it to her lips. <i>I
only hope I shall be my your side when you receive this...</i>
Robert had penned those words with slow confidence, little dreaming
how each separate syllable was to twist like a knife in her heart.
She sat white-faced and dry-eyed, for this was something too deep
for tears, too fine for pallid snivelling sympathy. On the table by
her bedside the silver teapot gleamed untouched, the crisp toast
hardened while the girl stared unseeingly out into the sunlit
garden.</p>

<p>Then slowly she turned away and her eyes came to rest on the
other envelope, lying on the quilt. She snatched at it almost
fiercely. Could it be really true, she asked herself&mdash;did she
now actually hold the key to this dark riddle? Her fingers
tightened about the stationery so that it crackled protestingly. A
man very near in her affections had died for this! At that thought,
her heart began to pound and she was conscious of a fluttering in
her throat. Involuntarily she glanced over her shoulder. Was she to
learn the truth so easily? Would no movement be made to stop her?
If she was to rip that sealed flap now, what would happen?</p>

<p>With fingers that trembled, Elizabeth Blaire tore open the
second envelope...</p>

<p>There came a sudden crashing detonation that gouged every
strained nerve in her body, so that she gave a quick, bitten-off
scream. Then she realized that someone had knocked sharply on her
door.</p>

<p>The enclosure&mdash;where to hide it? Quickly! Her eyes flashed
here and there, to rest on the embroidered cover of the
breakfast-tray. A second and more urgent knocking finalised her
indecision. With a quick movement she lifted the cover and thrust
the opened envelope underneath the one corner. Then:</p>

<p>"C&mdash;" she had trouble in enunciating "&mdash;come in," she
called.</p>

<p>The door opened and in walked Dr. Newbury. Elizabeth gave a
little sigh and lay back on her pillows, conscious that her
forehead was dewed with perspiration.</p>

<p>Newbury, small black bag in hand, crossed and looked down at his
patient, shaking his head in deep reproach. "My dear young lady,"
he asked, "what on earth have you been doing?"</p>

<p>The girl forced her stiff lips into a smile. "Why, nothing,
Doctor."</p>

<p>"Nothing!" The doctor's rich, fruity tones rose a trifle. "Bless
my soul, you look as if you had just run a mile in record time
time." He cleared a space on the little table and set down his bag.
Then, very deliberately, he brought a large, turnip-faced watch
from his pocket, and, stooping, gathered her pulse between finger
and thumb. His thick eyebrows arched.</p>

<p>"Tch, tch! This is terrible! And I ordered you complete
relaxation!"</p>

<p>"I know, Doctor." Elizabeth avoided his eye. "But after what I
went through last night it isn't very easy to relax."</p>

<p>Newbury frowned. "You didn't sleep?"</p>

<p>Tell him anything, a small voice within her urged. Get rid of
him&mdash;any pretext, anything! And the girl shook her head. "Not
very well," she murmured. "I was wondering if you could give me
something now. If I wasn't disturbed, perhaps I could sleep this
morning."</p>

<p>"Most decidedly!" Newbury turned away, opened his bag and began
to busy himself with the contents. "You can't go on like this, Miss
Blaire. You'll have us all seriously worried." Dexterously, he was
mixing ingredients from various stoppered bottles into a medicine
glass. Presently he turned.</p>

<p>"Now, young lady, drink this down and I don't want to hear a
word out of you for the next five hours!" And as Elizabeth took the
tiny glass, he added: "It will probably make your heart pound for a
minute or so, but don't worry. It's a nerve draught. Drink it, then
lie back quietly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Doctor." The girl was fumbling about the bed with
her free hand. "Oh dear, I wonder if you'd get me a clean
handkerchief out of that drawer over there?" She gestured to a
dressing-table set under the window. Newbury nodded and turned
away. Swiftly, Elizabeth lifted the top of the teapot and poured
into it the contents of the medicine glass. When the doctor tossed
the folded handkerchief on the bed, she was lying back on the
pillow with closed eyes. The chink of glassware told her that
Newbury was re-packing his bag. As it clicked shut the doctor
spoke.</p>

<p>"Feel better?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth opened her eyes and smiled. "I think I do."</p>

<p>The doctor crossed to the window and drew the curtains,
darkening the room. Then he picked up his bag and made for the
door. He spoke with his hand on the knob. "Don't worry, my dear,"
he said. "Try to sleep. I'll drop in later on and have a peep at
you." With a reassuring nod he went out.</p>

<p>For some seconds after the door had clicked behind him, the girl
remained motionless. Then cautiously she put forth a hand and
retrieved the envelope from beneath the tray-cloth. Holding it
tightly she jumped from the bed, and crossing to the window pulled
back the curtains. Quickly she inserted two fingers into the torn
flap, only to withdraw them with a sudden breath of
astonishment.</p>

<p>The envelope was empty!</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Chief Inspector Read, with Mr. Blackburn at his elbow, knocked
sharply on the stout oak that barred the entrance to
Atherton-Wayne's study. There was no answer. Read knocked again,
more peremptorily. This time the baronet's voice bade them enter.
The two men passed through. As Jeffery closed the door, Read set
his back against it.</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne was sunk dejectedly into an armchair. He made no
attempt to rise as the Inspector said curtly: "We'd like a few
minutes conversation with you, sir, if we may."</p>

<p>The baronet made a weary gesture. "Since I appear to have
forfeited all rights to my personal liberty," he said coldly, "I
cannot refuse. I can only ask, however, that you keep this
interview as short as possible."</p>

<p>"Suits me." Read advanced and tossed a piece of paper on to the
desk. "I'd like you to take a look at that, sir." Atherton-Wayne
hesitated, then he rose sluggishly as though his extremities were
leaden. He took up the message, glanced over it and raised his
eyes. "Where did this come from?"</p>

<p>"It was found on the floor of the library last night, after you
had left."</p>

<p>The baronet shrugged his shoulders. Holding the paper between
finger and thumb, he dropped it neatly into the wastepaper
basket.</p>

<p>"That's my answer," he said curtly.</p>

<p>Jeffery, watching closely, spoke. "You are a very brave man, Sir
Anthony."</p>

<p>The other's eyes met his for a brief space. Then he smiled and
it was like winter sunlight glinting on ice. "On the contrary,
Blackburn, I am extremely cowardly. It is The Owl who is brave,
daring to threaten me when"&mdash;and now the smile was
twisted&mdash;"when the vast resources of Scotland Yard are down
here to protect me." He returned to his chair. "Is that all you
wished to see me about?"</p>

<p>The Inspector took a step forward. He rapped the words sharply.
"What's going on down there in those vaults?"</p>

<p>But the baronet was not to be caught a second time. He merely
raised his eyebrows in pained surprise and his voice was almost
languid when he replied.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't understand what you mean. I have no
knowledge of anything going on, as you express it, in the
vaults."</p>

<p>Faced with this calm denial, Read seemed temporarily at a loss.
It was Jeffery who took up the questioning.</p>

<p>"As you know, sir," he said quietly, "following the murder of
Ashton, detectives examined that passage behind the Oak Room. They
found one fork blocked off by an iron door. The other fork leads
down into the vaults and out into the garden by the lily-pond near
the conservatories." And as Atherton-Wayne nodded, "Down in the
vaults, however, our men discovered a second iron door, blocking
the exit of the fork. May we inquire what lies between those two
doors?"</p>

<p>"As far as I know," the baronet replied, "nothing but a mass of
fallen masonry."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said Mr. Blackburn.</p>

<p>Sir Anthony shifted restlessly in his chair. "Two years ago," he
explained, "a guest in this house discovered that passage behind
the Oak Room and decided to explore. He lost his way and narrowly
escaped injury when part of the tunnel roof caved in. I decided the
place was too dangerous and had both ends of the passage
blocked."</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded. "In that case, why did you deny any knowledge of
such a passage when I inquired a few days ago?"</p>

<p>"Because I had no wish to see the unfortunate experience
repeated," the baronet replied.</p>

<p>Blackburn was silent, considering. Was there a ring of genuine
truth in the tart phrases, or was it a clever masquerade? The
Inspector, who had been listening with ill-concealed impatience,
put the next question.</p>

<p>"In that case," he queried, "why are the hinges on both doors
freshly oiled?"</p>

<p>A frown darkened the baronet's face. "I find that very hard to
believe."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, one of my men assures me it's so!"</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne shrugged. "Oh&mdash;mere hearsay." His tone was
slightly contemptuous. "I would suggest that you examine the door
for yourselves before asking me a ridiculous question like
that."</p>

<p>The Inspector's tolerance, strained by this unproductive
interview, snapped suddenly. With a face like thunder, he wheeled
and barked at his companion: "Come on, son, we're wasting time!"
Shepherding Blackburn before him, he tramped heavily from the room,
closing the door with unnecessary force behind him.</p>

<p>They trod the passage in silence. As they reached the bend,
Jeffery cast a look at Read's black, set face. "Whither now?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Vaults!"</p>

<p>Within a few minutes they were clear of the house. The
Inspector's heavy boots crunched on the gravel flanking the
lily-pond. Now they had reached the trees and walked in a cool
green undersea light that flickered and danced to the pattern of
the weaving branches above. Some distance away a round dome of
weathered masonry protruded like some giant mushroom and it was
towards this that the two men turned their steps. At one side a
flight of stone steps, broken and moss-covered, led down into the
earth. Read produced a torch from his pocket and flashed it into
the depths. Then he turned to where Jeffery was peering closely at
some words on the stone, almost obliterated by the passing of the
years.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he snapped.</p>

<p>"Just an inscription," the young man returned mildly. He traced
the carven stone with his finger. <i>"Facilis descensus
Averno,"</i> he murmured.</p>

<p>"Meaning what?"</p>

<p>"The descent into hell is easy. In other words, it's much easier
to get into trouble than get out of it." Jeffery made a grimace.
"Curious sense of humour on someone's part, don't you think?"</p>

<p>Before the Inspector had chance to answer, a voice rapped
sharply:</p>

<p>"Put up your hands, baby-face!"</p>

<p>The Inspector whirled with a snarl of fury, then froze
motionless. Standing in the shadow of the nearest tree, a man with
a shuttered, tight-lipped face was regarding them woodenly. A stray
shaft of sunlight flamed in his copper-coloured hair and glinted on
the muzzle of a small black automatic held in one steady hand.
Jeffery heard Read give a sudden ejaculation amazement.</p>

<p>"Recognize me, eh, Inspector?" The tight lips barely moved.
"When you sent your bloodhounds ferreting around the 'Green Man',
you never guessed they'd bring me to light, did you?"</p>

<p>The nasal twang of the voice, the reference to the inn, gave
Jeffery a sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>"Todhunter!"</p>

<p>Read's tone was bitter. "Is that so? Well, son, he may be known
as Todhunter down here, but in the Central Record Office this bird
goes under the name of Red Lacey, one of the greasiest crooks that
ever crossed the broad Atlantic!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>CHAPTER SEVEN. "Grimes said,
'There be an owl roostin' in your bar'..."</h2>

<h3>MONDAY, JUNE 19TH (CONTINUED).</h3>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>"Well, I'll be hanged," exclaimed Jeffery, staring.</p>

<p>The humour of the situation seemed to appeal to Lacey. His tight
lips twitched slightly. "Me first, Buddy! A gypsy told me."</p>

<p>Read's partly raised hand trembled with suppressed rage. "Listen
to me, you sneaking, gutter-bred rat!" he snarled. "Where do you
think you are&mdash;Chicago? Drop that gun!"</p>

<p>"Another word like that and I'll drop you&mdash;fair and square
in your tracks!" Lacey took a step forward. "Hear that, bonehead?"
His eyes flicked in Jeffery's direction. "Take off your tie and
bind the big bozo's hands behind him." And as the young man did not
move, "You got just ten seconds, bud!"</p>

<p>"You," retorted Mr. Blackburn calmly, "can go to hell!"</p>

<p>Both men saw Lacey's finger tighten around the trigger. Both men
ducked almost simultaneously. Jeffery, however, was not quite fast
enough. There was a sudden <i>plunk!</i> as of two cupped
hands-brought sharply together and Mr. Blackburn's hat leapt from
his head. As it settled on the ankle-deep grass, he saw where the
bullet had ploughed a neat incision through the crown.</p>

<p>"You got five seconds," Mr. Lacey announced. He was removing the
silencer from the automatic.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Chief," the young man murmured. Read submitted to the
indignity with a snort like an angry bull. Lacey watched the
operation with a coldly critical eye, and when Jeffery had
finished:</p>

<p>"Now turn round, both of you, and march!"</p>

<p>The Inspector, his face a rich purple, made a last appeal.
"Lacey, I'm warning you&mdash;"</p>

<p>The nose of the automatic was poked roughly into his ribs.</p>

<p>"Down into the vaults," Lacey commanded harshly.
"Walk&mdash;don't talk!"</p>

<p>At the head of the stairs he felt in his pocket with his free
hand, produced a flashlight and clicked it on. One behind the
other, Read and Jeffery passed downward. Once in the darkness of
the tunnel leading to the vaults they were at a hopeless
disadvantage. Outlined as they were in that circle of light, Lacey
could see and forestall any possible break for freedom. The trio
marched in silence. Read walked with hunched shoulders, glaring
suspiciously right and left into the darkness. His shadow, sliding
before him, was that of some huge, distorted orang-outang.</p>

<p>They were almost to the vault itself when things happened with
disconcerting suddenness. Their first intimation was when they
heard Lacey give a quick ejaculation, then the flashlight spilt its
radiance drunkenly about the groined roof. Next moment they heard
the rush of a moving body and, simultaneously, the passage echoed
with violent movement. The flashlight crashed to the floor and
died. Both men wheeled. Dimly outlined against the feeble light
that percolated down from the steps, they saw Lacey writhing and
twisting. The walls threw back the noise of the conflict; the heavy
breathing and muttered curses of Lacey and the grunting and panting
of his unseen assailant. Uncertain what to do, Read and Jeffery
stood irresolute, pressed back against the rough masonry.</p>

<p>The struggle ceased almost as abruptly as it had started. They
had a quick glimpse of a flailing arm; there came the unmistakable
crack of bone against bone, a sudden tremulous gasp and the dancing
mass fell apart. One half lay motionless on the stones, the other
rose unsteadily and seemed to pause. Then, before either Read or
Jeffery could move, the unknown had whisked past them. Even as they
realized and sprang forward, the distant clang of an iron door rang
like a mocking challenge in their ears.</p>

<p>"Matches, son," snapped Read.</p>

<p>Jeffery found a box and struck one, holding it high. The
Inspector, his hands still tethered, shouldered his way forward.
"There's a torch in my right-hand pocket. Get it out and then see
if you can untie me."</p>

<p>Tossing the match away, the young man went to work. The torch
found, he clicked it on and holding it between his teeth had his
companion's hands free in a few minutes. Read, massaging his
wrists, grunted:</p>

<p>"Now let's take a peep at Mr. Clever Lacey!"</p>

<p>Jeffery held the torch downward while his companion bent over
the unconscious figure on the floor of the tunnel. Lacey's face,
never prepossessing at its best, was sadly disfigured. Under a
lacerated brow, one eye was swollen and slowly purpling. Three long
scratches marked one side of his face to meet a split and bleeding
lip. But the blow that had laid the gangster out had left its mark
on the narrow, rat-like jaw. Here an irregular-shaped scarlet weal
had formed, through which little pin-points of blood were slowly
seeping. Jeffery, surveying this unhappy visage, shook a foreboding
head.</p>

<p>"Among the things I would rather not be," he murmured, "include
Mr. Lacey waking to a cold, unsympathetic world!"</p>

<p>Read, who had the injured man's head on his knee, looked up. "I
suppose we can thank your black-bearded friend for this?" he
grunted.</p>

<p>"It looks like it."</p>

<p>The Inspector eyed the battered face again. "Well, son, when we
do dig him out, it's a job for Connolly and his strong-arm brigade.
I've got too much sense to go cornering a wildcat at my age! Friend
Lacey looks as if he's run up against a threshing machine."</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded. "You know why? Blackbeard was terrified, Chief.
Those injuries of Lacey's are the marks of a man wild with
fear&mdash;literally battling for his life."</p>

<p>"But why should he attack Lacey at all?"</p>

<p>"As I see it, Blackbeard was stalking us," the young man
replied. "For one thing, we were between him and his shelter. For
another, we were plainly visible in that circle of light, whereas
Lacey couldn't be seen at all. That was the cause of the
trouble."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Blackburn must have been pretty close behind Lacey. Our crooked
friend heard him and swung the torch round. Blackbeard, in sudden
blind panic, closed with Lacey at once. Fought like a tiger because
he thought that, at any moment, we'd be in the fray."</p>

<p>Read gave a snort that echoed along the passage. "Risk my hide
for this rat? Not on your sweet life! He's had this lesson coming
to him for a long, long time." He was easing the unconscious man
into sitting position against the wall. "And what in the name of
Noah is he doing down here at all?"</p>

<p>"As Todhunter, ostensibly to buy Blaire's formula."</p>

<p>"What with?" the Inspector snapped. "The last time this crook
was financial was when he stole the contents of a blind
flower-seller's box in Trafalgar Square!" He paused and his voice
slowed. "Wait a minute. Say that Lacey is The Owl. Some of those
robberies he pulled off early in the piece'd bring him in quite a
nice little wad, even allowing for what the fence would take."</p>

<p>"Hmm," murmured Mr. Blackburn doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Well?" the big man grunted. "Got any better suggestion?"</p>

<p>"Only that this is neither the time nor the place to dwell upon
the possibilities of the case," Jeffery returned mildly. "I suggest
we get Lacey back to the house. You never know. When he comes round
he may decide that confession is good for the soul."</p>

<p>"If he has one!" Read bent down and put his hands under Lacey's
limp arms. "All right, son. Shove that torch in your pocket and
grab his feet." He shifted uncomfortably as the light snapped out.
"Come on, Jeff, make it snappy. This place is giving me the
willies!"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>In one of the small summer-houses that dotted the wide gardens
of Rookwood Towers, Elizabeth Blaire sat alone.</p>

<p>It was the gentle hour between sunset and dusk. In the west the
sky was a rich gold, and the sun's passing smeared the horizon with
long purple clouds like brush-strokes. The half-light seemed to
enrich the colouring of the garden and it took on an aloof dignity
that was very near beauty. The hush of approaching night was
omnipresent, even the wind was stilled.</p>

<p>Elizabeth had seen the gentle loveliness of the fading day from
her room. With a mind tortured by doubts and fears she had come out
into the garden, drawn by the soft tranquillity of the evening. In
the house it was impossible to think clearly and logically. Out
here, in this little world of soft scents and half-heard sounds,
she could better sort out the fantastic jigsaw of suspicions that
crowded her head.</p>

<p>Had Dr. Newbury removed the name of The Owl from that envelope?
The girl felt in the pocket of her dress, brought out the empty
enclosure and stared at it in the fading light. <i>"To Elizabeth
Blaire. To be opened only in the event of my death."</i> It was
common knowledge throughout the Towers that Ashton had known the
true identity of The Owl. Had Newbury seen this inscription on the
envelope, recognized Robert's handwriting, and known intuitively
what the enclosure contained? In that case, what had prompted the
removal of the contents? Mere curiosity&mdash;or something deeper,
more sinister in its implication?</p>

<p>Elizabeth, with these questions ticking ceaselessly in her mind,
had found rest impossible. She had risen shortly before lunch with
the determination of seeking out Jeffery. But Blackburn was
closeted with the Inspector, and the entire house was buzzing with
the news that Mr. Todhunter was in reality a dangerous American
crook; moreover, this protean gentleman was already languishing
behind double-locked doors in one of the rooms on the ground
floor.</p>

<p>On the horns of dilemma, the girl had hung about the corridors
the best part of the afternoon, hoping for some glimpse of Jeffery.
But he could not have been more elusive if he were avoiding her
deliberately. Like an unquiet spirit, she moved from room to room,
formulating plans and rejecting them. She finally decided to
confide in her brother, but on going to his apartment discovered
that he had not yet returned home. Then it was that she had decided
to come into the garden. But after half an hour of mental wrestling
she was no nearer the solution of the problem than before.</p>

<p>In the rich peacock-blue of the sky, a lone star twinkled. It
was reflected in the dark pile of the Towers, as one by one windows
began to light up. A wind, rising far down the valley, brushed the
trees with furtive fingers, and Elizabeth, with a little shiver,
rose to her feet. Night was stealing through the garden, and
something whispered to her that it was not good to be out
alone.</p>

<p>She was almost running when she reached the entrance to the
Towers.</p>

<p>Inside, her fancied terror vanished. Three detectives stood in a
little group before a suit of armour near the main entrance,
another sat on an oak settle making entries in a note-book. This is
sanctuary, she told herself, but her strange restlessness
persisted. She had the sudden desire for human companionship, to
talk and laugh with somebody. Back into her mind crept the memory
of Robert, but with a little stiffening of her chin she thrust the
thought away. Not that. Not now. Not when I'm so wretchedly
lonely.</p>

<p>With a little dejected droop of her shoulders, Elizabeth started
upstairs. On the landing she met Mrs. Tamworth, who was taking
several garments from one of the maids. The housekeeper at the
Towers was a middle-aged, rather stout matron with a below-stairs
reputation of a martinet. Rather given to black lace and bracelets,
Cornelia Tamworth balanced this tendency towards the exotic with
nightly Bible readings, a horror of strong waters, and a primitive
but powerful faith in astrology. She turned as the girl
approached.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Miss Elizabeth. Its nice to see you up and about
again."</p>

<p>The girl smiled. "Thank you, Mrs. Tamworth. And it was very kind
of you to look after me the way you did." Her eyes rested on the
mackintosh and thick grey woollen muffler over the housekeeper's
plump arm. "Somebody tempting the clerk of the weather?" she asked
brightly.</p>

<p>"Now you're the second one to ask me that in three minutes," the
housekeeper replied. "Mr. Blackburn wanted to know the same thing.
I told him I was taking them along to Sir Anthony's room. He just
rang through for them."</p>

<p>Elizabeth tried to make her tone casual. "Where is Mr.
Blackburn?"</p>

<p>"Gone down to the village with the Inspector." Mrs. Tamworth,
sensing her companion's willingness to gossip, edged closer.
"Naturally, they were curious why Sir Anthony should need an
overcoat and muffler on a hot August evening, but after tonight
I've just got past wondering the reason of things."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the girl. "What happened tonight?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Tamworth paused, as though making up her mind.</p>

<p>Then she said abruptly: "Miss Elizabeth, why should anyone in
their right senses want to steal an old pair of curtains?"</p>

<p>"Curtains?"</p>

<p>"The old pair from Mr. Blaire's bedroom," the housekeeper said
firmly. "They were in place at the window when Clarice did the room
out this afternoon. Half an hour ago, when she went in to turn down
the beds, they were gone!"</p>

<p>The girl shrugged. "It's rather unimportant, isn't it? After
all, one of the policemen probably took them down."</p>

<p>The housekeeper, in the act of transferring the raincoat from
one arm to the other, paused.</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me about the police, miss," she said scornfully.
"I could tell them all a thing or two if I liked to open any
mouth!" She lowered her voice and glanced cautiously over her
shoulder. "Who is it, for instance, that eats all the food that
goes to Sir Anthony's room each night?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth stared at her. "Good heavens, how should I know? Sir
Anthony himself, I suppose."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tamworth shook a stubborn head. "Not he! Doesn't eat enough
to keep a bird alive, the master. Up till a month ago he couldn't
look at supper&mdash;not even a glass of hot milk. Then all at once
he changes his mind and orders enough food for a labourer each
night. <i>And</i> cleans it all up! That tray comes down in the
morning with barely a crumb left on it."</p>

<p>The conversation had run into channels rather displeasing to
Elizabeth. She had enough questions of her own to answer. In an
attempt to divert the housekeeper's garrulous flow, she glanced at
her wrist-watch and gave a sudden ejaculation.</p>

<p>"Heavens! I'll never be dressed in time for dinner!" She smiled
and moved away. "Actually, I'm not supposed to be out of bed, you
know. Dr. Newbury would be furious if he saw me."</p>

<p>"Then you'd better keep out of his way," Mrs. Tamworth warned
her, "because he's staying the night here."</p>

<p>The girl half turned. "Why?"</p>

<p>The housekeeper's face hardened. "That wicked Yankee has to have
the doctor's care all night, if you please!" She tossed her head.
"If you ask me, miss, he got just what he deserved. Kindness is
wasted on the devil's disciples!" She was about to add more when
the indicator on the landing buzzed imperiously. Mrs. Tamworth gave
a sudden start and recalled her position. "That will be the
master," she said quickly. "Excuse me, miss." Smoothing the
garments over her arm she hurried away to Sir Anthony's rooms.</p>

<p>Elizabeth's mind revolved about this new information as she
continued her walk. An impulse to confide in Atherton-Wayne was
quickly stifled by Mrs. Tamworth's furtive suggestions. And what of
Dr. Newbury? Should she go to his room and confront the man with a
straight accusation? But a moment's reflection convinced her that
this would be merely a waste of time. If Newbury had taken the
paper with any sinister intent he would certainly not admit the
theft.</p>

<p>She was almost to her room now. Automatically, as she walked,
her hand sought the pocket of her dress; abruptly she halted with
fingers groping wildly. But the pocket was empty.</p>

<p>Swiftly, she turned and looked along the passage. The envelope
had been in her pocket when she left the summer-house; she
remembered folding and stuffing it away as she rose. It must have
worked loose during her flight across the garden and dropped
somewhere in the hall or the corridor. Feverishly she was casting
left and right, but the carpeted flooring showed no trace of what
she sought. She was feeling in her pocket for a second time when a
voice spoke at her elbow.</p>

<p>"Have you lost something, miss?"</p>

<p>It was Reynolds. The servant stood looking at her curiously.
Elizabeth, startled by his sudden appearance, stumbled over her
answer.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;yes&mdash;no&mdash;I&mdash;" Something in the man's
smooth scrutiny made her colour up. She said rather coldly: "It is
nothing, Reynolds."</p>

<p>"As you say, miss." His eyes were still riveted on her pale
face. "I have a message for you&mdash;from your brother."</p>

<p>"He's back?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Blaire returned about five minutes ago. He would like to
see you in his room. He said to tell you it was very urgent."</p>

<p>Elizabeth nodded. As she walked quickly towards her brother's
room she was conscious that Reynolds was staring after her. She was
glad when a bend in the corridor blocked her from his view. Moving
to a door, she knocked. Inside, a voice replied:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Betsy?" Then: "Come in, sis."</p>

<p>When she entered and closed the door behind her, Edward Blaire
was standing by the elaborate marble fireplace, staring down
moodily into the empty grate. As the girl crossed he lifted a dark
and worried face to greet her. Elizabeth stopped short.</p>

<p>"Why, Ted! Whatever's the matter?"</p>

<p>Blaire gestured to a chair. "Sit down, Betsy. I want to talk to
you."</p>

<p>The girl obeyed. Then: "You scarcely look like a person who has
come into a small fortune," she said, with an attempt at lightness.
"Did anything happen about Sir Anthony's cheque?"</p>

<p>Blaire said curtly: "Oh no. The cheque was all right."</p>

<p>"Then what is it?"</p>

<p>The young man sat down in the chair opposite and, leaning
forward, clasped his hands. He spoke without looking at her.</p>

<p>"I had a bit of a shock today, Betsy. It's&mdash;well&mdash;sort
of cut the ground from under my feet." Now he raised his head and
behind his glasses his eyes were sombre. "There's no use beating
about the bush. You've always thought of me as your brother,
haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Naturally!"</p>

<p>Edward Blaire shook his head. "I'm not, Betsy. I&mdash;I'm an
adopted child."</p>

<p>The girl half rose. "Ted!"</p>

<p>"Oh, there's no mistake about it!" Weary resignation weighed the
young man's voice. "Pennefeather showed me the actual adoption
papers&mdash;as our lawyer, he'd taken them over when
our"&mdash;his tone faltered slightly&mdash;"when your parents were
killed in that railway accident. It seems my real name is Edward
Conway. Your father and mother took me from a foundling home when I
was eighteen months old."</p>

<p>Elizabeth sank back into her chair. Despite the incredulity
written on her face, instinctively she knew that the young man
opposite her was speaking the truth. Here was the explanation of
many things that had troubled her; the wide difference in their
natures; his brilliant achievements that left her bewildered; the
lack of true sympathy between them. For some time now she had
suspected that this man came from a different mould, but she had
put this odd changeling quality down to some distant ancestral
throwback. Always she had stood rather in awe of him; of his cold,
hard nature, streaked with those violent temperamental outbursts;
of his evasive personality that was almost the antithesis of her
own forthright nature. But she had attributed all this to the
streak of near-genius that he possessed. Now she knew that all
these things had their roots in more logical soil.</p>

<p>She was aware that the young man was watching her closely, as
though reading these secret thoughts in her face. Intuitively, the
girl realized that his ultra-sensitive make-up must be sorely
bruised by this revelation. Elizabeth smiled and, reaching forward,
placed a slim hand on his knee. Her voice was purposely light.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear! What does it matter?"</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"For twenty-five years I've looked upon you as my brother," the
girl said gently. "Nothing can change that. In spite of all the
legal documents in the world, you'll always be serious old Ted
Blaire to me!"</p>

<p>"Betsy!" He caught her hand in his own, holding it so tightly
that she almost winced. After a pause, he went on:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I had to tell you. Otherwise, it wasn't
fair&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense!" Her tone was almost motherly. "You're making a
great deal of fuss of something that doesn't matter a row of
pins!"</p>

<p>Blaire released her hand to light a cigarette. "You'd have known
the truth when you saw the will..." he began.</p>

<p>"What will?"</p>

<p>"Mine." He dropped the charred match-end on the floor. "That's
how it all came out. I took Atherton-Wayne's cheque to Pennefeather
and asked him whether he advised banking or investments. The old
chap was very serious about it all; pointed out that I was now a
comparatively rich man and had I made a will."</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"Told him a will wasn't necessary. Said that you were the only
relative I possessed in the world, and being my sister any money I
had would automatically descend to you as next of kin. Then it was
that Pennefeather broke the news."</p>

<p>Elizabeth said gently: "Yes?"</p>

<p>Blaire's voice was low. "It seems you're not my next of kin,
Betsy. My father is still living somewhere in the north of
England." He paused for a moment, then went on: "I wouldn't believe
it, until Pennefeather dug out the actual papers. So I had him draw
me up a will there and then." His voice slowed. "If anything should
happen to me, Betsy, you'll be pretty comfortably off for the rest
of your life."</p>

<p>Elizabeth was on her feet, staring down at him. "Ted, you
shouldn't have! What about your father?"</p>

<p>Blaire's face flushed, and behind their lenses his eyes
glittered angrily. "What's that man to me?" he cried. "What can I
possibly owe him&mdash;when, as a wee helpless baby, he dumped me
into a foundling's home? What possible responsibility can I feel
towards a creature like that?" He shook his head. "No, Betsy! I
want that money to go to the one person who has shown me kindness
and consideration."</p>

<p>"But, Ted&mdash;"</p>

<p>The young man rose. "That's all," he said doggedly. "I don't
want to talk about it any more. In fact, I want as much as possible
to try and block this day completely out of my life."</p>

<p>He turned away, but the girl was by his side in an instant. She
laid a hand on his arm. "Ted! You're keeping something back from
me. What is it?"</p>

<p>The colour faded suddenly from the young man's face, leaving it
deathly pale. He tried to control a slight twitching at one corner
of his mouth. "Don't be ridiculous!" he muttered sullenly.</p>

<p>Elizabeth's fingers tightened. "Then why are you so upset?" she
demanded. "There's no shame in being an adopted child! That in
itself isn't enough to make you so miserable." She peered urgently
into his face. "There's something else, isn't
there?&mdash;something you haven't told me. Isn't there?"</p>

<p>Faced by those accusing eyes, Blaire hesitated. Then he nodded
heavily.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The girl said sharply: "Well?"</p>

<p>The words came slowly, forced out one by one. "It's about my
father." He avoided her gaze as he spoke. "Naturally, I was curious
about him. I asked Pennefeather and couldn't understand why he was
so evasive. I put the question to him point-blank; he coughed and
muttered, and said something about not seeing my father for the
past five years..."</p>

<p>"He's been away?"</p>

<p>Blaire laughed, a harsh bitter sound. "Oh yes, he's been away
all right! Pennefeather had to tell me the truth; he couldn't hedge
any longer." The young man's face was as dark as the shadows
outside the window. "My dear father was released three months ago
from Wormwood Scrubbs, where he'd been serving a prison sentence
for attempted murder!"</p>

<p>Half an hour after Edward Blaire had made his surprising
confession to Elizabeth, Chief Inspector William Read faced Jeffery
across the private room at the 'Green Man Inn' at Tilling.</p>

<p>"I've brought you down here to talk, son," he began, "because I
don't trust a single inch of that place back there. Every time I
open my mouth at the Towers I get the impression that those old
codgers in the portraits are leaning forward to get an earful."</p>

<p>Jeffery, seated on a rather hard oak settle, nodded. "Very wise,
Chief," he murmured. "For some time now I've wanted to get together
with you on some sort of <i>résumé</i> of this case. It sort of
clears the tracks for further work."</p>

<p>"All right," Read agreed. He felt in his pocket and produced a
piece of paper. "I've been working on this all the morning. Now, it
seems pretty obvious that this Owl is someone under the roof of the
Towers. But before we get down to that, let's consider what
qualifications any particular individual must have to come under
suspicion of being our night-flying friend."</p>

<p>The Inspector paused, and holding up a broad hand began to tick
the points off on his fingers.</p>

<p>"First, he must be a crook well versed in the ways of the
underworld. Remember how the strong-room of the International Bank
was opened&mdash;with a blow-torch! The slickness and efficiency of
that job made it plain that this was no amateur at the game. It was
the work of someone who'd spent the best part of a lifetime in
crime. The same thing applies to the lifting of Mortlake's Cellini
cup. Everything about that pinch was professional. No bungling, no
finger-prints, no tracks of any kind. See what I mean?"</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded. "Point number one: The Owl is a clever
professional criminal."</p>

<p>"Good! Now for the second thing." Read tapped his splay finger
impressively. "The Owl works alone. In that way he guards against
any chance of betrayal. Nobody can talk, because nobody knows
anything. Also, there's the big advantage that, in pulling off a
job, he collects the lot. There's no splitting with other
thick-ears. But this has its disadvantages, as you'll see in a
moment. It means that as well as picking up the loot on his own,
the Owl has to dispose of it, too."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" began Jeffery, but Read held up his hand.</p>

<p>"All in good time, son." A third finger went up. "Now for the
next point. The Owl's what you call theatrical. All this mysterious
hotch-potch of black robes and hootin' noises and leaving sinister
messages dropped about&mdash;that sort of stuff belongs to the
films! It doesn't mean an extra grey hair in my head, but it does
impress a lot of people who believe in looking under their bed for
burglars before they turn in at night. And this skunk is wise
enough to see that. Scare the daylights out of people and you can
twist 'em around your little finger. That's that!"</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Jeffery. "Go on."</p>

<p>"Fourthly," continued the Inspector, "The Owl must know the
Towers like the palm of his hand! The way he comes and goes as he
pleases proves that. And he's awake to all those secret passages
about the place. Look at the way he carried young Blaire over that
roof and down into the vaults.</p>

<p>"And finally, son, The Owl's a killer. That's mighty important
in more ways than one, as you know. Criminals, like tradesmen,
stick to their own particular technique. Pick-pocket, safe-blower
or thug, they rarely step out of their own hierarchy." Read paused
and lowered himself into a chair. "Now, Jeff, on this paper I've
written seven names. I suggest that we go over each one separately
and see which one measures closest to those qualifications
mentioned above."</p>

<p>"Very well," agreed Jeffery. "Where do we start?"</p>

<p>"Atherton-Wayne," announced Read.</p>

<p>"All right, Chief. Go ahead." Jeffery seated himself more
comfortably and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Atherton-Wayne," resumed Read, "appears, at first sight, a poor
suspect. The only qualification that touches him is that he knows
the Towers. He obviously isn't a professional crook, and he
certainly isn't theatrical. But that bird has money! Is there
anything to stop him from employing a professional crook to do the
dirty work, putting him wise to the ins and outs of the Towers?
None whatsoever!"</p>

<p>"Except," Jeffery pointed out, "the very material obstacle of
his cheque! Why should Atherton-Wayne part with fifty thousand
pounds&mdash;more than twice the sum Blaire was asking,
remember&mdash;if he could get the formula by darker means?"</p>

<p>"For the simple reason," the Inspector continued, "that his
Nibs' hand was forced. I'm willing to wager he'd never have dipped
so deeply into his pocket if it hadn't been to save his face."</p>

<p>"And you think the missing-fingered gent he's hiding in the
vaults may be the hired assassin?"</p>

<p>"Who else?" grunted Read.</p>

<p>Jeffery shook his head. "In that case, who dropped the note in
the library threatening Atherton-Wayne's life?"</p>

<p>"That gentleman himself. If it is Atherton-Wayne, he probably
realizes that he's played a losing hand. There's only one thing for
him to do now. Direct suspicion away from himself by every possible
means and get rid of the blackbearded killer in the vaults. What's
more, this theory's borne out by Ashton's murder. That lad was more
or less in Atherton-Wayne's confidence, and he had access to all
sorts of private correspondence. It's my firm belief that the
secretary discovered something fishy, taxed the baronet with it,
and Atherton-Wayne tipped the wink to his hired thug. Exit
Ashton!"</p>

<p>As he paused, Jeffery nodded. "Very ingenious, Chief&mdash;and
certainly quite possible. Who's next?"</p>

<p>"That Blaire boy," grunted Read.</p>

<p>Jeffery made a wry face. "Oh, come, Chief," he murmured.</p>

<p>"I know!" the other returned. "An even less likely person than
Atherton-Wayne. On the face of it, there seems no earthly motive
for Blaire to carry out this reign of terror. He isn't a crook and
there seems no reason why he should go to all this trouble to steal
a formula that's his in the beginning. But just say that he and his
sister and Atherton-Wayne are working this between them."</p>

<p>At the mention of Elizabeth, Jeffery sat up. "Working what?" he
snapped.</p>

<p>Read ignored the young man's tone and continued evenly: "I don't
say this is right, son, but it is a theory. Blaire discovers this
formula. He tells his sister and Atherton-Wayne and immediately a
scheme occurs to the baronet. Atherton-Wayne sees a chance to boost
the value of the formula up ten times its value. They seize on The
Owl robberies&mdash;quite a separate series of crimes, of
course&mdash;and the girl comes up to the Yard with the tale that
the lad's come under the evil eye of our night-flying friend. You
fall at once for a pretty face; we come down here and immediately
Blaire's invention jumps into the headlines. The trio foresee what
will happen; bidding will start at once. There's a carefully worked
up scene in the library; Atherton-Wayne offers fifty thousand,
hoping that Hautmann will top the bid with even more. Oh, it seems
perfectly plain to me, son! I noticed the criminal tendencies in
that woman's face the moment she stepped into my office and&mdash;"
here even Read was unable to control the twinkle in his eye at the
sight of Jeffery's reddening face.</p>

<p>"You blithering old bag of wind!" exclaimed Jeffery heatedly.
"You're pulling my leg!"</p>

<p>The Inspector sobered. "All right, son, let it pass. No, we've
nothing on Blaire or his sister. Nor have we anything on the
Hautmanns, which smells to me! The German Embassy have never heard
of them, and reports that the couple certainly haven't any
authority to go around offering thousands on behalf of the German
Government for a formula. Likewise, Lord Dewhurst disclaims all
knowledge of the pair. The German Embassy reports that they may be
genuine foreigners working for themselves, and they've promised to
check up on them." Read slipped the paper in his pocket and faced
the younger man. "That leaves us with Lacey and Reynolds."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mr. Blackburn. "Now perhaps we shall hear some common
sense."</p>

<p>"Well, son, I've got it written down in black and white." Read
took out an envelope, extracted a folded sheet of paper and handed
it across. "Those," he said, "were checked with the finger-prints
Reynolds left on the ashtray."</p>

<p>Jeffery was examining the paper closely. Two small photographs
were pasted at one corner, showing the servant's features in
profile and full face. Below these were five finger-prints. Below
these again was the typewritten comment:</p>

<p class="newspaper">JOSEPH MARTIN, alias REGINALD CASTLE, alias
D'ARCY KENTON. Confidence man and petty thief. Served two years'
sentence at Pentonville in 1930 for swindling. Served eighteen
months for attempted forgery three years later and eight months
during last year for being concerned in robbery with violence.<br>
<br>
General description:</p>

<p>Here followed the usual routine records. Jeffery raised his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Interesting, Chief," he murmured, tossing the paper on the
table, "but not at all surprising. Somehow I can't see the
squirming Reynolds pushing a knife into Ashton's back! I don't
doubt for one instant that he could plan all this, but he'd never
have the nerve to commit murder."</p>

<p>"I agree," Read assented. "But what if two of them worked as a
team? One to plan, the other to do the dirty work."</p>

<p>"Who else have you in mind? Lacey?"</p>

<p>The Inspector shook his head. "Not for the moment. Now we come
to someone whom up till now has been right outside the scheme of
things." Read leaned forward in his chair.</p>

<p>"Son, do you recall the Pearson murder at Bayswater about five
years ago?"</p>

<p>Jeffery's face was sombre as he nodded. "I certainly do. One of
the most brutal crimes that ever shocked the country. Colonel
Pearson and his wife were battered to death for their little of
hoard money, amounting, I remember, to about thirty pounds."</p>

<p>"That's it. It was one of the clumsiest pieces of butchery ever
known. Three days later we arrested a chap named Arnold Patterson
for the two crimes. His guilt was as plain as a pikestaff, and he
was sentenced to death. Later, because of some political
string-pulling that's still a mystery to me, he was reprieved and
sent to Dartmoor for the term of his natural."</p>

<p>"Arnold Patterson." Jeffery was wrinkling his forehead over the
name. "Where have we heard of him lately? Or have we?"</p>

<p>"Three months ago," the Inspector said heavily, "Patterson
escaped from the quarries under the cover of a fog. He's never been
heard of since, and the authorities gave up the chase because they
reckoned he'd fallen into one of the bogs on the moor. But here's
the link, son. Reynolds served part of his last sentence at
Dartmoor and became pretty thick with Patterson. Say that Patterson
wasn't killed out there on the moor? Say that he and Reynolds are
working this thing between them?"</p>

<p>But Jeffery shook his head. "No, Chief. This whole thing is too
subtle for a common basher like Patterson. This thing has finesse,
and cunning, too." He shrugged his shoulders rather wearily. "This
talk may have clarified one or two points, but Mister Owl still
remains cloaked in darkness. We're no closer to his true identity
than before."</p>

<p>Almost desperately, Read demanded: "But what of your own pet
theory, son? The one you're being so dashed secretive about?"</p>

<p>Again the young man shook his head. "Nothing fresh. If there
was, you'd be the first to know it."</p>

<p>The Inspector brought an empty pipe from his pocket and jammed
it aggressively into his mouth. "Then it's Lacey," he snapped.
"He's our last hope! I'll rail him up to headquarters tomorrow and
let the boys grill him green! And if he doesn't spill the whole bag
o' beans, I'm Cleopatra's grand-daughter!" He wheeled and strode
towards the door. "What do you say to an ale, son? We'll wipe the
taste of this whole dirty racket right out of our mouths!"</p>

<p>Jeffery was rising when he heard, dimly, the clock in the bar
below strike nine. The tinny beats were echoed in the deeper chimes
carried on the wind from the clock at the Towers. The young man was
about to speak when a tap on the door forestalled him. Read,
closest, swung it open, to reveal the landlord. He touched his
forelock as the Inspector looked him over.</p>

<p>"It be nine by the clock, sir," he mumbled, and thrust an
envelope into the big man's face.</p>

<p>"What's this?" Read barked.</p>

<p>"My boy Joe found it on bar this even'." The landlord blinked.
"Writin' on it says not to be given to Inspector till nine by the
clock."</p>

<p>"Found it on the bar?" the Inspector snapped. "Who left it
there?"</p>

<p>The landlord shook his head. "Bar be empty," he explained, "and
my boy Joe be talking in pot-room with Sam Grimes the blacksmith.
Then they heard a sort o' call inside an' Grimes, he say, 'There be
an owl roostin' in your bar.' Joe goes in and finds letter with
florin piece on it. Writing on the letter says it goes to you at
nine by the clock..." He paused as Read waved him to silence and
slit the envelope with unsteady fingers.</p>

<p>Somewhere down below, a telephone shrilled. With an apologetic
bob the landlord hurried away.</p>

<p>The note unfolded, Jeffery read the words over his companion's
shoulder. As before, they were printed in straggling capitals.</p>

<p class="newspaper">I SHALL COME FOR ATHERTON-WAYNE AT NINE-THIRTY
TONIGHT. YOU HAVE JUST HALF AN HOUR TO BE IN AT THE KILL!</p>

<p>There was no signature, but none was needed. Read crumpled the
note in his hand and Jeffery could see the beads of perspiration
forming on the big man's brow. The Inspector said hollowly: "Son,
is this chap the devil himself?"</p>

<p>It was the landlord who spoke. He insinuated an uneasy face
round the door. "You're wanted on the tellyphone, sir," he
addressed Read. "Urgent-like, from the Towers."</p>

<p>The big man almost bounded from the room. Jeffery heard him go
clattering down the stairs, listened to the barked monosyllables,
and then sprang into life as Read's stentorian voice bawled from
below:</p>

<p>"Into the car, son! We're going back to the Towers! Some
misbegotten skunk's cracked Armstrong's skull with a
life-preserver, and Lacey's free!"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The chimes of nine o'clock, dimly heard by Jeffery at the inn,
boomed hollowly into a room in the north wing of the Towers. Almost
invisible in the deep shadows that hemmed the apartment, the figure
sat motionless, waiting until the last of the chimes had died away.
Then two black-gloved hands pulled open a drawer, and a shaft of
moonlight, sliding between the drawn curtains, glinted on an open
case of knives of curious design. The gloved hands selected one,
slightly curved, with a blade of razor sharpness.</p>

<p>Noiselessly the figure rose, and crossing to the window pulled
aside one curtain and stared at the lighted windows of the opposite
wing. As though waiting for this cue, there came a burst of muffled
activity from below. Lights flashed on, heavy footsteps clattered
here and there, voices were loud in shouted orders, and twice a
police-whistle shrilled through the garden. The gloved hand holding
the curtain clenched, and the figure rocked with wild stifled
laughter. A near-by window glimmered into life and for a moment the
thing was seen in quick silhouette&mdash;shapeless, dark, with
folds that fell from the outstretched arms like black wings.</p>

<p>Next moment the curtains were swiftly drawn, and darkness,
complete and opaque, enveloped the room. Only an occasional creak
of boards or a half-heard scrape conveyed that life moved in that
dim apartment. Then, from somewhere, a soft click was heard.</p>

<p>Outside, feet marched up to the door, and a heavy fist rapped
authoritatively on the stout oak. A few seconds later, the summons
was repeated. Then the door was thrust open and a hand sought the
light switch near the jamb. As the electric light in the centre of
the room shone out, Detective Connolly was revealed, his head
thrust forward, peering inside. He was breathing rather
heavily.</p>

<p>The sound of footsteps made him turn. Donlin was advancing up
the corridor, his face grave. He spoke as he approached. "I've just
got through to the Chief," he announced. "They're coming back at
once. Tell Dr. Newbury to get a move on&mdash;Armstrong's bleeding
like a pig!"</p>

<p>Connolly clicked off the light and closed the door. "We'll have
to look somewhere else," he said. "Dr. Newbury's not in his
room."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>It was a little after nine-fifteen when Jeffery turned the
bonnet of the two-seater through the gates of the Towers, and swung
the car along the winding drive towards the house. Read, an empty
pipe between his teeth, sat with hands clenched on his knees,
staring out at the dark tunnel that hemmed them in on either side.
The trees were so thick that the branches interlaced, and through
this breeze-swung filigree he could catch only occasional glimpses
of the lighted windows beyond. Once, when they passed a more
sparsely planted grove, he thought he could distinguish agitated
shadows moving here and there, but before he could be sure the
drive wound back under denser growth and the house was once more
lost to view.</p>

<p>Because of the convolutions of the drive, speed was out of the
question. Jeffery drove with his foot caressing the accelerator.
Now they were moving along a lane formed by the overhanging
branches. The beam of their headlamps ran before them, now peering
inquisitively through the massed tree-trunks, now sweeping along
the white driveway ahead.</p>

<p>"There he is!" shouted Read suddenly.</p>

<p>Jeffery's foot drove hard at the brake pedal and the car
slithered to a stop with a scuffle of tyres. Both men flung
themselves out of the seat as a figure, momentarily blinded by the
headlights, darted out into the drive, flung up one arm across his
face and then slipped back among the trees. They could hear him
crashing through the undergrowth ahead of them.</p>

<p>The Inspector was pushing forward like some remorseless
Juggernaut, beating down obstructions with flailing arms, heedless
of the spiteful twigs that slapped about his head and tore at his
face. Jeffery ran more cautiously, quieter and more swiftly. Then
the blundering of the man pursued was heard to cease. Jeffery
paused, listening, and Read caught up with him.</p>

<p>"Where'd he go?" the big man panted.</p>

<p>"Quiet!" Jeffery motioned his companion to silence. Then he
muttered: "He's hiding somewhere in that thicket. Come on, Chief,
we'll beat him out!"</p>

<p>The Inspector reached up, grasped an overhanging limb and tore
it from the tree. Swiftly he stripped it bare of leaves and turned,
grasping a very serviceable cudgel. "I'll rout the rat from his
hole," he grunted, and began swishing and probing at the bushes.
Blackburn walked warily, eyes everywhere, ready for the slightest
movement. Read was a dozen paces ahead of his companion when
Jeffery heard him stop with a sudden exclamation.</p>

<p>"Jeff!" he called. "Let's have your torch."</p>

<p>Pulling the flashlight from his pocket, Blackburn almost ran to
the other's side and flashed a pool of radiance below where Read
stood staring. Next moment he felt his stomach turn within him.</p>

<p>Half concealed in the undergrowth was the body of a man, a slim
figure dressed in a checkered mackintosh raincoat with a grey
muffler wound about the neck. The body was lying face downward and
from the back protruded the handle of a knife. Jeffery gave a
sudden groan.</p>

<p>"Atherton-Wayne! Chief, we're too late!"</p>

<p>Silence. Then somewhere a dog howled, a strange melancholy
sound. A thin breeze moved the branches above their heads. The
flashlight in Jeffery's hand trembled slightly. He heard Read give
a dry cough.</p>

<p>"Seems a funny looking knife, Jeff," the Inspector said
heavily.</p>

<p>Blackburn stepped forward and bent over the dead man. "It's a
doctor's scalpel," he said. He was in the act of rising when an
unforseen interruption occurred. Another figure was pushing its way
urgently through the bushes, making no effort at concealment.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" a thin sharp voice cried. "What is going on out
here?"</p>

<p>Read gave a queer, inarticulate gasp of amazement. Jeffery
raised his torch and flashed it full in the face of the
newcomer.</p>

<p>Sir Anthony Atherton-Wayne stood blinking in the glare!</p>

<p>"You!" breathed Jeffery, staring at that grey, lined face.
"Then&mdash;then who...?" But the Inspector was already on his
knees beside the dead man. With a quick movement he turned the body
over. Jeffery, diverting the flashlight, played in on a swarthy,
bearded face with eyes already closed in death. "Blackbeard!"</p>

<p>There came a sudden cry of pain at his elbow. Atherton-Wayne
stood trembling, his hands over hip face as if to block out what
the flashlight had revealed. He whispered huskily:</p>

<p>"Arnold...Arnold!..."</p>

<p>Read was on his feet, one big hand grasping the baronet's arm.
"This is the chap you've been hiding in the vaults, isn't it?"
Then, in sudden enlightenment, he barked: "And he's Arnold
Patterson, the Bayswater murderer, isn't he?"</p>

<p>The baronet whispered thinly: "It's useless to hide the truth
any longer. Yes...he was Arnold Patterson."</p>

<p>"And since we're tellin' the truth," rapped the Inspector,
"would you mind letting us know why you've been hiding an escaped
murderer?"</p>

<p>Under his hand, Read could feel the baronet trembling like a man
sick with fever. When he spoke, the words croaked harshly in his
throat:</p>

<p>"Arnold Patterson was&mdash;was my brother!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>CHAPTER EIGHT. "I just managed to
persuade the Chief to keep the formula..."</h2>

<h3>TUESDAY, JUNE 18th.</h3>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The hours following Sir Anthony Atherton-Wayne's dramatic
statement in the garden of Rookwood Towers were filled with minor
incident.</p>

<p>Neither Read nor Blackburn had asked the baronet for further
details at the time. Scarcely had those trembling words been spoken
than Edward Blaire, with Detective Connolly, pushed into the
undergrowth. Their voices were loud with excited
inquiries&mdash;inquiries that were suddenly halted as they beheld
the body half hidden in the bushes. With gentle hands the big
detective and the young chemist helped Jeffery carry the dead man
into the hall and from there to Atherton-Wayne's own room. There
the baronet, obviously labouring under great mental strain, had
begged Read that explanations be postponed until the morning. And
Read, after one keen glance at the elder man's grey, haggard face,
nodded a curt consent.</p>

<p>Read's next move was to see Armstrong. The foxy-faced detective
had been put to bed and the capable Mrs. Tamworth was applying cold
compresses to an ugly laceration across the back of his head. The
detective had recovered sufficiently to talk, but his information
was relatively unimportant. He had been on guard outside Lacey's
room when he had heard his name called softly. Puzzled, he had
walked a few paces, pausing outside the door of the adjoining room.
And as he stood looking up and down the corridor, there came a
sudden creaking at his back. Wheeling, Armstrong explained that he
had had a brief glimpse of a half-opened door before he was struck
down. When he recovered consciousness, the key of Lacey's room had
disappeared from his pocket.</p>

<p>Had he seen his attacker? "Only for a split second," was the
reply. Man or woman Armstrong could not tell. The face was wrapped
around with something like a shawl, but he could have sworn that
his assailant wore spectacles. He remembered the light glinting on
them. The Inspector swung round on Mrs. Tamworth: "Who, in the
house, wore glasses?"</p>

<p>"Only Mr. Blaire," the housekeeper replied.</p>

<p>But Jeffery had interposed that this was scanty evidence. A pair
of spectacles was the easiest disguise in the world to obtain.</p>

<p>Then Dr. Newbury bustled in, rather bleary-eyed and smelling so
strongly of spirits as to cause Mrs. Tamworth to recoil with a gasp
of righteous indignation. The doctor explained that he had been
asleep&mdash;"just dozed right away on a couch in the Oak Room,
gentlemen"&mdash;and was there anything he could do? They left him
with an openly scornful Mrs. Tamworth, clicking his tongue
reproachfully over Armstrong's broken head.</p>

<p>The investigators then repaired to inspect the room in which
Lacey had been imprisoned. But except for a dozen cigarette-ends,
identical with the brand that Jeffery had found in the vaults, the
room was devoid of any trace of the American. Read was bewailing
this fact when one of the detectives burst in with highly
significant news. Information had just come through from Scotland
Yard that Mortlake's Cellini cup had been recovered! The tracing of
this valuable object was, incidentally, a tribute to Read's city
organization, and the cup had been found in the possession of a
certain Mr. Ebenezer Cheesling&mdash;the same gentleman being known
to the Criminal Investigation Branch as one of London's most
unscrupulous "receivers." After some persuasion, Mr. Cheesling had
imparted a description of the man from whom he had received the
cup&mdash;and that, description tallied feature for feature with
the now-vanished Mr. Lacey!</p>

<p>Small wonder that Detective Connolly, who buttonholed Read with
the information that he was holding for cross-examination one
Reynolds, alias Martin, alias Kenton, found himself brushed aside
with the curt rejoinder to guard the manservant until the morning.
For the Inspector was anxious to review the situation in the light
of this new evidence, and as midnight boomed from the clock in the
tower he faced Jeffery across the desk in the room he had
appropriated as his temporary headquarters.</p>

<p>"Well, son," he grunted. "Not a bad night's work, eh?"</p>

<p>Jeffery was lighting a cigarette. "This seems irrefutable
evidence that Lacey is connected with The Owl murders," the young
man admitted. "Unless, of course, The Owl used Lacey to sell the
stuff to Cheesling."</p>

<p>Read shook his head. "No, Jeff. The Owl works alone! And I told
you there was a professional hand in these robberies. Lacey builds
up the character of The Owl, learns of young Blaire's formula and
determines to get it. He comes down here in the guise of
Todhunter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>The Inspector made a gesture of irritation. "Goddlemighty, son,
it's as plain as the nose on your face! He wants to spy out the lay
of the land. In the disguise of that salesman, and staying so
innocently at the 'Green Man,' he can come and go as he
wishes."</p>

<p>Jeffery said mildly: "Don't think I'm raising objections, Chief.
But I want to get every kink straightened out this time. We can't
afford another mistake! So, if I'm hypercritical over small points,
it's only because we want everything foolproof to convince a judge
and jury.</p>

<p>"Any objections so far?"</p>

<p>"None at all."</p>

<p>"Very well." Some of the testiness dropped from the Inspector's
tone. "Now, I said that Lacey worked alone, but for his escape he
had to have help. Clever though he is, he couldn't be locked in
that room and coshing Armstrong, at the same time. So who's the
most likely person in this house to help him?"</p>

<p>"Reynolds."</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Read produced a cigar from his pocket, bit the end
and spat it accurately into the waste-paper basket. "Birds of a
feather flock together, son. Lacey and Reynolds'd get on like the
Siamese twins! What's more, from whatever way you look at it, Lacey
seems best choice for The Owl. He's the only one connected with
this case who isn't under our nose all the time. That leaves him
free to work this racket at his own sweet will. And here's another
thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Remember how young Blaire was trussed into that strait jacket
in the vaults? The knots were tied so tightly you had to cut him
free. I sent those ropes up to one of the chaps at the Yard who's
an expert on that sort of thing. He reports that those ropes were
knotted by a sailor." Read's voice slowed. "After one of his crimes
in the States, Lacey went into smoke by joining the Navy over
there, and deserted as soon as the hue and cry for him was
over!"</p>

<p>Jeffery's eyes were glittering. "The circle's narrowing," he
exclaimed. "Mr. Lacey will have to talk very fast to get himself
out of this mess." He flicked some ash from his cigarette. "By the
way, talking of that strait jacket and ropes, did you ever ask
Atherton-Wayne how his initialled handkerchief came to be used as a
gag for Blaire?"</p>

<p>Read nodded. "Says he knows nothing about them. Which is
probably true. It's as pretty a piece of planted evidence as I've
seen for some time. I think the reason for Atherton-Wayne's
mysterious monkey business is pretty plain now."</p>

<p>The big man paused, eyed the band on his cigar thoughtfully and
then looked up.</p>

<p>"Jeff, how'd you like to run up to London for a few days?"</p>

<p>Blackburn was not particularly enthusiastic. "Of course, if it's
going to help the case&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"It is," the other assured him. "I want somebody to tackle the
Cheesling end of this business. If that misbegotten son of Jewry
took the Cellini cup, it's on the cards he might know something
about the Harnett necklace. The Doone diamond's gone to Holland by
now, I'll bet, but we daren't neglect even the slightest chance of
a lead. I'd go myself, son, but I must stay down here. I've got a
net around these grounds, and the moment Lacey tries to slip
through, I've got to be here on the spot!"</p>

<p>Jeffery smothered a yawn. "I can tell you this, Chief. The Owl
won't attempt to leave this place within the next twenty-four
hours."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Atherton-Wayne was telling me that tomorrow afternoon one of
his factory chemists is coming down to take the formula up to town.
Now, The Owl is desperate. Once the formula leaves the Towers, it's
as good as lost to him. Therefore, he'll make an attempt to get it
before that chemist arrives here. And he can only do that by
hanging around." And, as the Inspector nodded: "The Owl knows that
Atherton-Wayne daren't trust that formula in a place where it could
be burgled. The baronet means to keep it on himself. The Owl saw
what he thought was Atherton-Wayne sneaking through the garden
tonight and struck him down, hoping to rob the body. Then he
discovered his mistake."</p>

<p>Read was chewing his cigar. "I suppose the skunk lifted that
scalpel from Doc. Newbury's collection," he grunted. "That seems to
be Lacey's game at the moment. To put suspicion on everyone just to
confuse us." And as the younger man was silent: "What's eating you,
son?"</p>

<p>"Just cogitating," Blackburn returned. "Chief, remember that
grubby-looking individual who ran out in front of our car as we
were coming up the drive&mdash;the chap we chased? Did you
recognize him?"</p>

<p>"Never saw him before in my life!"</p>

<p>"Same here." Jeffery's eyes were thoughtful. "I'll swear it
wasn't anyone from the house. Of course, it might have been someone
doing a spot of poaching and didn't want to be asked questions..."
the words were suddenly smothered in a yawn that racked his body.
"Gosh, I'm tired! I could sleep for a week!"</p>

<p>Read nodded. "Better turn in, son. Don't wait for me. I've a
couple of reports to make out before I get any shut-eye. You can't
do anything more here, and we'll both need all our wits about us in
the morning." The Inspector looked up and deep in those steely eyes
a twinkle lurked. "What's more, son, for the first time for a week
I can wish you good night and mean it!"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>"Yes, gentlemen. Arnold Patterson was my brother."</p>

<p>Sir Anthony Atherton-Wayne addressed Read and Blackburn in his
study on the following morning. It was near noon. Both men had
slept late after the excitement of the previous night. On rising,
the Inspector's first act had been to 'phone through to Scotland
Yard, asking for additional men. They were eating a hasty breakfast
when a message came that the baronet was waiting to see them in his
study.</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne had received them quietly, and had gestured both
men to be seated. Jeffery, studying the baronet's face, was
conscious of a change in the man's appearance. Gone was that
expression of shuttered, secretive reserve; the same tired lines
were there, but they seemed etched more lightly. The little man
held himself as rigidly as ever, yet somehow he conveyed the
impression of shoulders more squared, head held a little higher and
glance more level.</p>

<p>The baronet's tone was unruffled as he continued:</p>

<p>"I am not going to waste any time with apologies for what has
happened. Nor am I going to plead the excuse that blood is thicker
than water. The truth is that three months ago my wretched brother
came to this house and asked for sanctuary. I did the only possible
thing, under the circumstances. I concealed my brother in the
vaults, lied desperately and foolishly in an endeavour to keep
everybody away from that place, showed him the secret passages
around this house, fed him and last night clothed him in my own
garments so that he might make an escape. I have compounded a
felony in the full realization of the seriousness of my act. I
should have known it was inevitable that sooner or later my
brother's disgrace must touch my own life. But I was
proud&mdash;proud as Lucifer&mdash;and I lacked moral courage." He
paused and his glance moved from face to face. "And now, gentlemen,
I am in your hands. What do you propose to do with me?"</p>

<p>Read, watching him with narrowed eyes, said curtly: "Ask you a
few questions."</p>

<p>At that, the baronet's face went suddenly blank and hard, like a
window when a shade is pulled down behind it. Blackburn spoke
quickly.</p>

<p>"We both realize, Sir Anthony, that any probing of this matter
must be distressing to you. On the other hand, we are naturally
curious about this surprising relationship."</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne did not speak for a moment, then he shrugged and
ran a slim hand across his smooth silver hair.</p>

<p>"Surprising to you, perhaps," he murmured. "Not so to me. Arnold
was always the wild offspring of the family. He had his first brush
with the law when he was fifteen years old&mdash;stole a push-bike
from outside a post-office. My father sought to cure him by the
harshest means&mdash;he declared Arnold an incorrigible and my
brother was sent to a reform school for months. The injustice of
that move turned a normally naughty youngster into an embittered
criminal. During the next ten years he was convicted no less than
six times. Eventually, and to the great relief of us all, he
changed his name to Patterson (since the police were getting rather
familiar with his real name), and then the World War claimed him.
Nothing was heard of him for some years after that and we fondly
believed that he had died abroad. And then, five years ago, came
the Pearson murder, and I realized that the dark shadow still
haunted our lives."</p>

<p>Again he paused. Neither Jeffery nor Read offered comment. The
baronet continued:</p>

<p>"Arnold came in the night and begged me to shelter him. If I
would hide him until the search petered out, he swore that he would
leave the country and never trouble me again. Unfortunately,
someone in this house heard that conversation, recognized my
brother and held the threat of blackmail over my head. Having taken
the step, I was unable to draw hack."</p>

<p>"That man was Reynolds?" barked Read.</p>

<p>The baronet nodded. "After Ashton's death, Reynolds came to me
with the request that he take the place of my secretary. I dare not
refuse. Troubled as I was, I could not help but appreciate the
irony of the situation. Reynolds, a former gaol-bird, with access
to my private papers. Of course, I saw Reynolds' scheme in a flash.
He is a blackmailer by profession. A man in my position has certain
valuable secrets that would fetch a wonderful market price.
Fortunately, I was able to keep these from that man's reach. With
other secrets, however, I have been less fortunate."</p>

<p>Jeffery said sharply: "You mean all business relating to the
formula?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Not even the combination of my own safe was private."
Atherton-Wayne's thin lips were touched with a suggestion of a
smile. "Can you wonder, gentlemen, that at times I was
rather&mdash;er&mdash;short with you during our interviews?" His
face sobered. "There were moments when I found it impossible to
keep going under the strain. That was why I toad Arnold he must go
from the Towers last night. My brother consented, on the condition
that I give him five hundred pounds in ready money. I would have
given ten times the amount to see him away from the place. I gave
him some old garments of mine and arranged to have a fast car pick
him up outside Tilling. But while he was moving through the garden,
The Owl struck him down. A slow tide of colour stained the thin
cheeks.</p>

<p>"It is a terrible thing to say, gentlemen, but with that blow
The Owl not only wiped the shadow of fear forever from my life but
freed me from the grip of a rascally blackmailer. I am quite
prepared now to let the Law have its way with me."</p>

<p>Inspector Read got up slowly and began to pace the floor, one
hand jingling some loose change in his pocket. Then he turned.</p>

<p>"You've certainly given us more headaches than we deserve, sir,"
he said gruffly. "But from what you tell us, you've had some
provocation. And it seems to me we've got enough work on our hands
without a lot of extra fuss." He peered at the baronet from beneath
bushy eyebrows. "Naturally, we can't hush this thing up altogether.
But I suggest you get the ear of the Chief Constable and tell him
that we're quite willing to let sleepin' dogs lie. Understand what
I mean?"</p>

<p>Atherton-Wayne inclined his head. "Perfectly, Inspector. Thank
you. And&mdash;er&mdash;would you accept my apologies for
any&mdash;er&mdash;difficulties I may have raised in the past?"</p>

<p>Read dismissed the suggestion with a wave of his hand. "Forget
it," he grunted. "I want to talk to you about other things. This
factory chemist of yours&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Berlitzki?"</p>

<p>"That his monicker? Well, I believe he's coming down this
afternoon to pick up the formula."</p>

<p>A shadow settled over the other's face. "That was the
arrangement," he explained, "but there has been some delay. I had a
call from Berlitzki this morning. He finds it impossible to arrive
until tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Where's the formula now?"</p>

<p>The baronet felt in his vest pocket and extracted the phial,
holding it between finger and thumb. Jeffery jumped to his feet as
if his chair was suddenly red-hot. "Good heavens, sir, you surely
don't carry it about like that!"</p>

<p>"But I am forced to do so," Atherton-Wayne assured him. "Matters
in this house have reached the fantastic stage when I dare not
trust even the locks on my own safe!"</p>

<p>Jeffery was staring incredulously. "Sir Anthony, do you realize
that is just what The Owl wants? To force you to carry the formula
about with you! Think, sir, where would that formula be at this
moment if The Owl had not made the mistake in identity last
night!"</p>

<p>The baronet nodded. "Believe me, Blackburn, I have by no means
overlooked such a possibility. Do you know how I spent last night?
Lying awake reading, with the formula beside a loaded revolver on
the table by my bed! When dawn broke this morning, there was no
more thankful a man in this world! That is why Berlitzki's delay is
so disturbing. I have no fancy to spend another such night."</p>

<p>Read was following this conversation closely. Now he spoke.
"Blackburn's going up to town after lunch. Why not let him take the
formula along to your factory and deliver it to Berlitski
himself?"</p>

<p>"Not on your life!" Jeffery retorted sharply. And as Read swung
round: "Sorry, Chief, but I'd just as soon travel with a time-bomb
in my pocket! I'd want an armed guard around me before I'd take
charge of that stuff!" Then, as the Inspector started to speak:
"Why don't you keep the formula?"</p>

<p>"Me?" exclaimed Read.</p>

<p>"Yes," Jeffery's tone was animated. "Seems to me it's safer with
you than in the Bank of England. You're the one person The Owl
wants to steer clear of, and what's more, as far as he knows, Sir
Anthony still has the formula. It's only for one night and you can
put detectives three deep round your door while you sleep."</p>

<p>The Inspector was considering the suggestion with frowning brow.
Then he turned to where the little baronet was still balancing the
tiny phial in his hand. "What d'you think, sir?"</p>

<p>"It appears an ideal arrangement, Inspector. You could deliver
the formula to Berlitzki tomorrow morning and arrange, perhaps, to
have some of your men accompany him back to town?"</p>

<p>Read hesitated only a second longer. Then he thrust out a big
paw. "Hand it over," he said gruffly. And as the baronet did so, he
tucked the phial into his vest pocket. Then he buttoned his coat,
patting the tiny bulge with appreciative fingers.</p>

<p>"That," announced Mr. Blackburn, "is that! It's a pity we didn't
think of this days ago."</p>

<p>Both investigators were nearing the door when Atherton-Wayne
spoke again. "I have been frank with you, gentlemen. Could I ask
you to be equally frank with me?"</p>

<p>Read turned. "In what way?"</p>

<p>"How much longer do you expect this reign of terror to continue?
Are you any nearer discovering the true identity of The Owl?"</p>

<p>The baronet was looking at the Inspector as he spoke, but it was
Jeffery who replied. His voice was very quiet.</p>

<p>"We can promise you this, Sir Anthony. We both know the name of
The Owl. But that does not mean we have heard the last of him. He
may even strike again, for now he grows desperate indeed! But of
this you may be certain&mdash;his career of crime is rapidly
drawing to an end. And, if luck favours us, we may have him
cornered within the next forty-eight hours. And may you be with us
when we pull the mask from his face!"</p>

<p>He nodded curtly to the Inspector, and both men left the room.
Sir Anthony, a curious expression on his face, stood staring for
some seconds at the closed door.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Late that same afternoon, Inspector Read gripped Jeffery's hand
and watched as the two-seater car moved around the drive towards
the white road beyond. Then, humming tunelessly below his breath,
the big man turned and began walking towards the house.</p>

<p>For the first time in many days Read felt comparatively
cheerful. Jeffery's substantiation of his own suspicions regarding
Lacey swept away the last shadow of doubt in the Inspector's mind.
Not that the case was by any means finished: there still remained
the task of trapping the elusive killer. Hands in pockets, brow
furrowed, Read pondered as he walked.</p>

<p>A soft patter of footsteps behind made him turn. Bareheaded, her
cheeks flushed and her eyes bright, Elizabeth Blaire was coming
towards him.</p>

<p>"Inspector," she cried, "could I speak to you?"</p>

<p>Read nodded. "What's the trouble?" he asked amiably.</p>

<p>The girl was a little breathless. "Who was it that drove out in
Jeffery's car?"</p>

<p>"Jeff." And because the Inspector was in a communicative mood,
he supplemented the bald statement. "He's gone up to town for a
while, to keep an eye on some business at that end."</p>

<p>"Oh!..." said Elizabeth. It was not so much a comment as a
disappointed little breath. She was carrying her hat in her hand, a
large floppy straw trimmed with gay flowers. Suddenly she pulled it
on her head so that, for a moment, the wide brim hid her face. And
as she hesitated, the Inspector remarked:</p>

<p>"Didn't the lad tell you?"</p>

<p>Her face was still hidden, but the reply came bravely "No. After
all, why should he?" Now she raised her head, and her eyes were
wide and blue as a child's. "You've been keeping Jeffery very busy
lately, haven't you, Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Things have been happening," Read grunted non-commitally. He
searched the girl's face for a moment, then: "What's on your mind,
my girl?"</p>

<p>Steadily she returned his gaze. "Inspector, are you quite
satisfied in your mind that I have nothing to do with these crimes
down here?" And as Read brushed aside the imputation, she
continued, "Because I'd like to get away from here as soon as I
can."</p>

<p>The Inspector's moustache quivered in the semblance of a smile.
"So would a lot of us," he muttered.</p>

<p>"But it's rather different with me," Elizabeth insisted. "You
see, I've always earned my own living. I'd saved some money, and I
was sort of between jobs when this business started. Now that
money's almost gone. I can't live on Sir Anthony's hospitality any
longer." Her voice was very quiet. "You understand?"</p>

<p>"Dashed if I do," the other returned. "I admire your
independence, miss, but after all, your brother's just netted a
small fortune. Surely you're entitled to a living from that!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't understand!" The girl turned away. "I couldn't
accept my&mdash;my brother's money. I want to stand on my own
feet."</p>

<p>The Inspector did not reply, instead he continued to look at
her. Perhaps this searching scrutiny embarrassed the girl or
perhaps she read something in those deep-set grey eyes that told
her Read knew the truth. She turned her head away abruptly. In a
tone surprisingly gentle, the big man spoke.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that's the only reason you want to leave the
Towers?"</p>

<p>"Of course!"</p>

<p>"Then why all this interest in young Jeff's comings and
goings?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth's face was slightly flushed as she turned to him.
"There's something I think he ought to know."</p>

<p>Read's eyes narrowed. "Something to do with this case?" And as
she nodded: "Any reason for keeping it exclusively for the
boy?"</p>

<p>"None at all," the girl replied. She hesitated for a moment as
though making up her mind, then quietly she told him the story of
Ashton's communication and the losing of the empty envelope. The
Inspector listened with head thrust slightly forward. When she
paused, a shadow settled on his face.</p>

<p>"Boiled down," he muttered, "it looks as though someone has
found that envelope thinking it contained the name of The Owl."</p>

<p>Elizabeth said softly: "That means The Owl thinks I know. That's
one reason I want to get away from here&mdash;before he can
strike...at me."</p>

<p>The Inspector shook his head. "Don't you worry, Miss Blaire.
You're in no danger now. The name of The Owl isn't a secret any
longer. Jeff and I have known the truth since last night."</p>

<p>"The real name of The Owl?" And as Read nodded, the girl's eyes
widened. "Then why don't you arrest him?"</p>

<p>The big man shrugged. "It isn't quite as simple as that," he
grunted. "We still lack proof&mdash;that's why Jeff has gone into
town. Another thing is that we can't lay our hands on him straight
away. We've got to get him out into the open somehow."</p>

<p>Elizabeth gave a half-glance over her shoulder. The misty gloom
of the approaching evening was thickening among the trees that
lined the drive. The sun had dropped behind the house and the long
shadow of ivied walls crept slowly towards them. The breeze had
taken on a sudden chill, so that the girl shivered. Involuntarily,
she moved closer to the Inspector, and her voice was almost a
whisper when she spoke.</p>

<p>"The real name of The Owl...is it Dr. Newbury?"</p>

<p>The Inspector said shortly: "What you don't know can't hurt you,
miss But I can promise you one thing. The next forty-eight hours
should see finish written to this business. Then you'll be free to
go where you like."</p>

<p>Feet crunching on the gravel made him turn. Connolly was
approaching from the house. He hesitated on seeing the girl, but as
Read nodded curtly, he came forward. "Reynolds is waiting up in
your office for you, Chief."</p>

<p>"Good!" Over his shoulder, Read addressed the girl, "Now, just
you run along, miss, and don't lose any sleep over things. And
above all, keep a watch on your tongue." With a nod, he strode off
at Connolly's side.</p>

<p>Inspector Read did not look back. But had he done so he would
have seen Elizabeth Blaire pull a small handkerchief from her dress
pocket and dab furtively at her eyes before she turned to follow
him into the house.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Chief Inspector Read leaned over his desk, supporting himself on
clenched fists, and glared pugnaciously into the pale face of the
man who stood opposite.</p>

<p>"So you're Reynolds, are you?" he barked.</p>

<p>The servant nodded calmly. "I thought I made that clear when we
met&mdash;" he began, but the Inspector snapped him down.</p>

<p>"You didn't make it clear that you were usin' Reynolds instead
of Martin or Castle or Kenton," he rapped. "And the reason for that
was because we would have known you for the sneakin' blackmailer
that you are!"</p>

<p>With those words a sudden change came over Reynolds. That smooth
mask dropped from his face as though wiped away with a sponge. The
shoulders straightened with a swagger that was near impudence. The
loosely hanging hands fitted into his pockets.</p>

<p>"So, Inspector, the game's up?" he grinned.</p>

<p>"What's this?" snapped Read. "Another act out of your
programme?"</p>

<p>Reynolds was lighting a cigarette. He raised his eyes over the
tiny flame and in that moment the Inspector found his dislike
warring with the man's dangerous charm. Here was a protean
individual who could apparently turn on his personality at will and
only the unsteady eyes and slightly twitching mouth revealed the
mean soul that lay curled behind the mask.</p>

<p>"No," replied Reynolds calmly, in reply to Read's question. "I
think this is the real Me. You know, Inspector, I get so used to
playing parts that I find myself getting all mixed up. It's rather
a pity," he added reflectively, "that I didn't go on the stage. But
there's so little money in the game."</p>

<p>The cool insolence of the man caught the Inspector off his
guard, so that, for a moment, he almost gaped open-mouthed. Then he
gave a snort like an angry bull and striding round the desk caught
Reynolds by the lapel of his coat and thrust a bulldog jaw into the
other's face. His eyes were dangerous vicious slits, and when he
spoke his voice was soft and purring, but with an undercurrent of
something that made Reynolds put up his hand as though to shield
himself from a blow.</p>

<p>"By the living God!" said Read softly. "Are you tryin' to put
over your works on me?" The tight lips barely moved. "Do that
again, mister&mdash;just do that once again, and I'll take you up
to headquarters and have the boys straighten you up with a piece o'
hose-pipe! And, believe me, you'll do no play-actin' for quite a
long time after that!"</p>

<p>There was no smiling charm on Reynolds' face now. It went hard,
the mouth ugly, the eyes glittering. He backed away from Read's
truculent countenance as far as the hand gripping his coat would
allow.</p>

<p>"What do you want with me?" he muttered.</p>

<p>With a powerful sweep of his arm, the Inspector thrust him
backward into a chair. Then, feet apart, arms akimbo, he stood over
him. "You're going to talk to me," he snapped. "You're going to
tell me the truth, or, by hokey, there'll be no sorrier man in
England today! Understand?" And as Reynolds nodded sullenly, Read
leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Where's The Owl's hide-out?" he barked.</p>

<p>Reynolds blinked. "How should I know?"</p>

<p>The Inspector eyed him for a moment without speaking. Then,
turning, he picked up a round ruler from the desk and balanced it
carefully in his hand. Reynolds gave a little gasp and shrank back
in his chair. The Inspector said quietly:</p>

<p>"We're goin' to forget for a moment that you're a blood-suckin'
rat, Reynolds. We're goin' to overlook the fact that you've got a
prison record as long as your arm. In fact, if you come clean about
your association with The Owl, we might be persuaded to forget
these things altogether." He paused, and his strong fingers slipped
down to the end of the ruler, holding it like a cudgel. "You and
this sneakin' skunk The Owl have been workin' together down here,
haven't you?"</p>

<p>Reynolds passed a pink tongue over pale lips. "You&mdash;you're
crazy&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>Read took a half-step forward, and the man in the chair squeaked
like a cornered rat. "D&mdash;don't hit me," he stuttered. "I'll
tell you the truth, Inspector, before God I will! Yes, I did come
down here to put the squeeze on the old boy, but as for this Owl,
I've never helped him once. I don't mix myself up with murders. You
know that!"</p>

<p>"Oh, cut the twaddle," snapped the big man contemptuously. "You
sandbagged Armstrong and let Lacey out of that room last
night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I didn't," squeaked Reynolds. He sat bolt upright, gripping
the arms of the chair in frenzied desperation. "You've got it all
wrong, Inspector. I swear you have! I was nowhere near Lacey's room
when he escaped. I was out in the garden&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doing what?"</p>

<p>Again Reynolds licked his dry lips. "Talking to the man I
believe is The Owl."</p>

<p>Read's eyes narrowed. "Who was that?"</p>

<p>The man in the chair faced his persecutor defiantly. "Edward
Blaire's father," he said clearly.</p>

<p>The Inspector's fingers tightened around the ruler until the
knuckles stood out ivory-white. "What did you say?" he asked
softly.</p>

<p>Reynolds, too old a hand at this game not to know when he had
the advantage, sat forward in his chair. Something of the former
arrogance tinged his tone when he replied.</p>

<p>"It's the truth, Inspector. That Blaire boy and girl aren't
brother and sister at all. He was an adopted child. His real father
came out of Wormwood Scrubbs about three months ago after serving a
sentence for attempted murder! Blaire didn't know himself until
yesterday afternoon." And as the big man continued to stare at him:
"You don't have to take my unsupported word for all this&mdash;get
Blaire here and ask him for yourself. He'll bear out what I
say!"</p>

<p>Read's eyes had never left Reynolds' face during this recital.
Experience of dealing with this type of man told the Inspector that
he was hearing truth, and deep in his stomach a nauseating little
fear squirmed and writhed. When everything at last seemed
straightened out and fitting into place, what did this new
complication portend? He addressed the other.</p>

<p>"And you believe this man&mdash;Blaire's father&mdash;to be the
Owl?"</p>

<p>Reynolds nodded. "Yes, Inspector."</p>

<p>Read tossed the ruler on the desk, walked round and sat heavily
in his chair. Leaning forward, chin on clenched fists, he
demanded:</p>

<p>"What's your idea?"</p>

<p>Reynolds, much more at ease, sat back and crossed his legs. One
hand hovered for a moment near the pocket holding his
cigarette-case, but Read's thunderous brow altered his decision. He
said calmly:</p>

<p>"Inspector, have you ever wondered why it is that The Owl wants
to kill young Blaire? Why not just take the formula and leave the
boy alone?"</p>

<p>"That's ancient history," the Inspector returned. "Now that the
formula's passed out of his hands, the lad's in no danger at
all."</p>

<p>Reynolds leaned forward. "You're on the wrong track, Inspector.
That lad's in greater danger than ever before. A few days ago he
was penniless. Now he's worth fifty thousand pounds. And if he was
to die, that money must automatically descend to his next of
kin&mdash;in this case, Blaire's own father!"</p>

<p>He paused for a moment. "Another thing, is it just coincidence
that these Owl robberies in the city began a few days after
Blaire's father came out from the Scrubbs?"</p>

<p>Read had picked up a pencil and was drawing little squiggles on
the blotting-paper before him. He made no comment as the other
continued:</p>

<p>"You know, Inspector, that I've made my living by getting hold
of certain facts and piecing them together. I'm right in nine cases
out of ten. And here's how I've figured out this thing. Blaire's
father creates this character of The Owl and commits these
robberies. Then he learns that Blaire has found this formula.
Investigating, he finds that Blaire is his own son. His first idea
is to steal the invention. But you put a stopper on that scheme. So
now The Owl has another card up his sleeve."</p>

<p>Reynolds' voice slowed impressively.</p>

<p>"Blaire senior knows his son's character very well. If he can
frighten his son enough, he knows the lad will sell the formula to
get it out of his possession. Sell it, too, for a pretty good
figure. Now, if the lad was to die, that money descends to the
father, always providing, of course, Blaire hasn't made a
will."</p>

<p>"How do you know he hasn't?"</p>

<p>Reynolds shrugged. "I don't <i>know</i> anything," he returned.
"This is all pure theory."</p>

<p>Read looked up. "Then you think it's young Blaire and not the
formula that is in danger now?"</p>

<p>"I don't say that. The Owl may be planning to get the formula as
well as the money. Indeed, he'll probably come after the formula
first. He can fix his son's death later&mdash;after all, the fifty
thousand pounds won't vanish in a few weeks."</p>

<p>The Inspector put down his pencil. "Seems pretty far-fetched to
me," he grunted. "The Owl had young Blaire in his power down there
in the vaults. Why didn't he finish him off that time?"</p>

<p>"Because that was part of the scheme to frighten the boy into
getting rid of the formula," Reynolds returned. "Remember how he
was bound into that strait jacket? That was sheer torture! After an
hour of that, the average man would be willing to sell his
soul."</p>

<p>Read considered this for a moment. "And you say Blaire's father
was here last night?"</p>

<p>Reynolds nodded. "He was out there in the garden. I was talking
to him myself."</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>The other hesitated a moment, then shrugged. "Might as well tell
the truth," he shrugged. "I knew Conway&mdash;that's Blaire's real
name, by the way&mdash;when I was doing a term at the Scrubbs.
About a month ago he got in touch with me. When Blaire discovered
this formula, I told Conway about it. Then he told me that Blaire
was his son and that he&mdash;Conway&mdash;had as much right to the
formula as anyone. I warned him about The Owl and advised him to
steer clear. His reply was that it was every man for himself in
this thing&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And last night?"</p>

<p>"He came down to ask me where the formula was at that moment. I
told him I hadn't the slightest idea. We talked on various things
for half an hour and eventually he slipped away."</p>

<p>The springs of Read's chair squeaked as the big man leaned back.
"All right," he said at length. "I'll think over what you've told
me. And for the time being, we'll say nothing about your other
activities. You'll stay down here, of course, and remember, this is
your last chance. If we find one more example of your greasy
ways&mdash;"</p>

<p>Reynolds rose to his feet. "So help me, Inspector, it's the
straight and narrow from now on! I've had my lesson, believe
me!"</p>

<p>"Tell your grandmother," the Inspector snorted. "You could no
more turn honest than a crab could walk straight! All
right&mdash;get out!" And as the door closed behind Reynolds, the
big man pulled a cigar from his pocket, bit off the end and lit the
weed reflectively.</p>

<p>What significance did these new facts have on the evidence in
hand? Read took it for granted that Reynolds was telling the truth.
For one thing, his details could be easily checked up by an
interview with Blaire. For another, the Inspector himself had seen
the unknown figure dart across the drive, and it did not take much
mental effort to identify this furtive shadow with Blaire's father.
And if Reynolds' hypothesis was correct, the whole perspective of
the case changed. It was not the formula that was the all-important
motive, but the money Blaire had earned from the formula. Read
considered, nodding as his mind ticked off the various points. It
was possible. Men had taken far greater risks than this for fifty
thousand pounds. With Blaire out of the way, his rascally father
would inherit every penny, unless...</p>

<p>Unless Blaire had made a will!</p>

<p>The chances were that he had not. The young man's queer,
self-centred nature would refuse to recognize anything outside of
his own particular world of science and such a mundane thing as
will-making might never occur to him. Again, when one is young the
possibilities of death seem very far off and remote unless, of
course, Blaire realized that he stood in danger. But then he would
not. Having got the formula off his hands, he would naturally
assume the danger shifted. On the other hand...</p>

<p>"No good conjecturing," Read grunted, as he rose. "Best to see
the lad myself."</p>

<p>The dressing-bell for dinner sounded as he tapped on the door of
Blaire's room. The young man's voice bade him enter. Blaire was
sitting in the fading light from an open window, making notes from
a book. He looked up as the Inspector approached, blinking
short-sightedly through his thick glasses.</p>

<p>"You'll ruin your eyes, son," were Read's opening words. He
nodded towards the open window. "Why don't you put on the
light?"</p>

<p>"Hadn't noticed it was so dark&mdash;wrapped up in this work,"
Blaire muttered. 'Stretching out a thin hand, he switched on the
standard lamp by the table then, taking off his glasses, rubbed his
blood-flecked eyes wearily. Pushing book and papers to one side, he
leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?" he asked.</p>

<p>Read did not beat about the bush. "Have you made a will?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>Blaire was adjusting the spectacles on his nose. He looked up
sharply. "What makes you ask that?"</p>

<p>"Because it's mighty important, son."</p>

<p>Edward hesitated a moment before replying. Then: "Since you
could find out by paying a shilling at Somerset House," he
returned, "there's no sense in denying it. Yes, Inspector, I have
made a will."</p>

<p>Read nodded, and dropped uninvited into a chair. "Mind telling
me who benefits?"</p>

<p>Blaire's sullen mouth hardened for a moment. "Is this
necessary?"</p>

<p>"Most necessary," Read assured him.</p>

<p>The young man shrugged. "Very well. My&mdash;Miss Blaire is the
sole beneficiary of the will."</p>

<p>The Inspector studied the smoking cigar between his fingers for
a space, conscious that the other's eyes were on him. Without
raising his voice, he said: "I notice you don't call Miss Blaire
your sister, son. That's because you come from different stock'
isn't it?"</p>

<p>Blaire sprang to his feet, scattering the papers on his desk
like white birds in flight. The bowl of the lamp cut off the upper
portion of his face so that the light was focused on that weak,
twisted mouth now trembling with unspoken words. Thin fingers flew
to his lips as if to steady them, then the young man spoke
hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Who told you?" And as the Inspector did not reply: "It was
Betsy! And she promised me&mdash;faithfully&mdash;that she'd keep
silent about this!"</p>

<p>The Inspector rose and, crossing to the table, laid a hand on
the young man's shoulder, pushing him gently back into his chair.
"Hold your horses, son," he said curtly. "You don't want to jump to
conclusions like that, y'know. Matter of fact, Miss Blaire didn't
tell me. Your parentage isn't quite the secret that you'd like to
think."</p>

<p>Blaire was staring up at him, his face crimson. "You
mean&mdash;others in this house...?" And as Read nodded, he buried
his face in his hands. "I know what it will be," he whispered.
"They'll all be pointing at me&mdash;pitying me to my
face&mdash;sneering at me behind my back."</p>

<p>Read said slowly: "You've got a pretty warped opinion of the
human race in general, haven't you, lad? The house isn't going to
laugh at you, because, in the first place, only two other people
besides your half-sister knows. And secondly, people don't laugh
about that kind of thing these days. That belongs to one o' them
mid-Victorian novels." And as Blaire raised his head again: "Come
on, son, snap out of it!"</p>

<p>The young man was half-way across the room before he spoke
again. "Care for a drink?" he muttered apologetically. And as the
Inspector shook his head, he turned to a small cabinet and took out
whisky decanter and a glass. Measuring himself a liberal potation,
he swallowed half of it at a gulp. The liquid had immediate effect.
Read, watching, saw his mouth become firmer, his hands ceased
trembling. He swallowed the remainder of the contents and, still
holding the glass in his hand, returned and leaned against the
table. There was almost a hint of bravado in his manner as he
addressed his companion.</p>

<p>"I suppose I should have made this official in the first place,"
he said. "But it's hardly the kind of thing one boasts about to
strangers. Particularly the police! Still, if it's common knowledge
you might as well know the whole truth." Haltingly at first, then
with more assurance, he retailed Pennefeather's story to the
Inspector, who listened in silence. The drink seemed to have
released Blaire's perverse nature, and he spared himself nothing in
the telling. Finally:</p>

<p>"That's the sort of rotten decayed stock I spring from," he said
bitterly. "Can you wonder that I was ashamed to tell the
truth?"</p>

<p>Read did not reply. Instead, he carefully deposited an inch of
cigar-ash in the tray at his elbow. Then he looked up. "Have you
seen your father since he came out of prison?"</p>

<p>The alarm on Blaire's face supplemented his reply. "Good God,
no! I wouldn't have him within a mile of me!"</p>

<p>"He's been a good deal closer than that, son. What would you say
if I told you he was out in the garden last night?"</p>

<p>Blaire was staring at him, his features twisted in horror. "That
man&mdash;here? How do you know?"</p>

<p>"We saw him," the Inspector said quietly.</p>

<p>Blaire turned away, shoulders drooping dejectedly. "So he's
found me at last," he whispered. "After all this time!" He half
turned and the acid in his tone cut like a knife. "Isn't there
something in the Bible about being sure your sin will find you
out?"</p>

<p>"You don't want to meet your father?"</p>

<p>The young man spat the words: "I'd die first!"</p>

<p>Read leaned forward. "Then why don't you get away from here,
son? Take a holiday&mdash;three months on the Continent. After all,
there's nothing to keep you here now. And you can afford to go
roaming where you please."</p>

<p>Blaire, in the act of sitting, paused. "What about your
bloodhounds? They won't let anyone step outside the house."</p>

<p>Read shrugged. "I think we might ease the regulations as far as
you're concerned, son."</p>

<p>Blaire was watching the Inspector curiously. He adjusted his
glasses carefully before he spoke. "I've told you the truth,
Inspector. Might you return the compliment? What's the real reason
for you wanting me out of this house?"</p>

<p>"You're in danger, son."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know just what you're going to say," the Inspector returned.
"But let me give you a tip. Get out of this place while you can.
It's best for you and best for us. I don't mind tellin' you that
we're closing the net round Mister Owl at last. When we pull the
string, the less people in this house the better!" He rose and
crushed out his cigar. "Well, what's your answer?"</p>

<p>Blaire nodded. "The idea certainly appeals to me," he confessed.
"I haven't had a holiday since I was in Vienna six years ago. But I
can't go straight away. I've got various things to finalize
here."</p>

<p>Read was on his way to the door. "You can let me know in the
morning," he said. "Meanwhile, keep your eyes open, son." He
nodded. "See you at dinner."</p>

<p>Out in the corridor, he glanced at his wrist-watch. He had just
time to write out a detailed report on the new developments. Mailed
tonight, Jeffery should receive it in the morning. Returning to his
room, Read sat down and, unscrewing his fountain-pen, set to work
on the task.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The chimes of two o'clock boomed hollowly through the deserted
corridors of Rookwood Towers. Edward Blaire turned restlessly in
his bed. Then he was wide awake, sitting up and staring out across
the darkened room. No sound save the ticking of the small clock on
the table by his bedside broke the silence that had settled once
more over the house.</p>

<p>Blaire had not slept well that night. In the open cabinet an
empty decanter of whisky attested to his particular means of wooing
slumber. Now he woke with raging thirst, his mouth caked and dry.
He recalled the water carafe near by and thrusting himself out of
bed made his way towards it. He gulped down two full glasses and
wiped his hand across his mouth. Never had he felt more wakeful
than standing there in that silent room. Taking up his spectacles
from the table he crossed to the long window and stood looking down
into the dark garden. The full moon of the previous nights had
disappeared; below him lay a pool of inky shadows, darker where the
overhanging trees massed like sly conspirators.</p>

<p>On his right, an angle of the house pushed out into the garden,
and the reflected starshine glinted on the blank windows that
followed one on the other down the length of the wall. Familiarity
with the house told him how those rooms were occupied. Dr. Hautmann
had the apartment nearest him, then came that of his daughter. Next
was Elizabeth's room, and then the sleeping quarters of the Chief
Inspector. An angle of the wall hid Atherton-Wayne's own suite of
rooms, and standing there Edward allowed his mind to roam behind
those shuttered panes. Were they sleeping, this odd assortment of
individuals under this roof, or, like him, were they wakeful and
busy with their own troublesome thoughts?</p>

<p>What had Read meant when he had told Blaire he was in danger?
That was the question that had beaten ceaselessly at the young
man's brain, making sleep impossible until he had drugged his
ticking, agitating mind with the fumes of alcohol. That&mdash;and
another phrase of the Inspector's: "Your father was out in the
garden last night!" His father! Blaire's lip curled. After he had
worked so hard and planned so much, why did chance send this shadow
across his path again? And where was he now? Was it from this
source Read expected the clanger to come? Was it possible that,
even at this moment, his father might be somewhere in the garden,
perhaps in the very house itself?...</p>

<p>In that instant, Edward happened to glance at the Inspector's
window, and his thoughts snapped abruptly. The dark panes had been
illuminated by a brief flash of light. Blaire's first impression
was that Read was awake and had struck a match, but the gleam was
too furtive for that. And no match ever gave out a smoothly
crawling circular disc of light. Even as he stared, eyes blinking
behind his thick lenses, the radiance appeared again. With a
tightening in his throat, Edward recognized it. The subdued light
of an electric torch...</p>

<p>Someone, or something, was prowling in the Chief Inspector's
room!</p>

<p>It was as though a cold hand closed suddenly around his heart.
His glasses blurred, and reaching up Blaire felt his forehead dewed
with perspiration. And as he paused irresolutely, the silence was
shattered by a roar like a goaded bull, followed by the sharp crack
of a revolver shot. As if waiting for this cue, mild pandemonium
descended. Two windows came alight almost immediately, somewhere a
woman screamed. This sound was answered by Read's bellow, a
frenzied yell in which anguish and command were blended.</p>

<p>"Donlin! Connolly! Stop the skunk, he's got the formula!"</p>

<p>Blaire started as if galvanized, and sprang for the door. Heavy
footsteps ran down the corridor outside. The young man swung open
the portal just in time to see a dark figure brush past him and,
running with the speed of the wind, disappear in the direction of
the Oak Room. The distant crash of a slamming door was heard, and
then the lights flared in a corridor acrid with the smell of burnt
gunpowder. Next moment Inspector Read, a lumbering figure in
striped pyjamas and one hand still grasping the automatic, rounded
the bend, followed closely by the two detectives.</p>

<p>Read bore down on the young man like a thunderbolt. "Did you see
him?" he panted. And as Blaire nodded, "Which way?"</p>

<p>"The Oak Room&mdash;" began Edward, when Read swept him on one
side and raced onward. Blaire, careless of his appearance,
followed. He came up just as Connolly was fumbling awkwardly at the
entrance. The Inspector shouldered him aside and kicked open the
door with his foot.</p>

<p>"Back!" he snapped. "The rat'll probably shoot his way out of
here!"</p>

<p>The three men crouched behind the Inspector's broad shoulders as
the door swung wide. There was a pause. Cautiously, Read inserted
his head around the jamb. Next moment:</p>

<p>"Room seems empty," he grunted, then wheeled on Blaire. "You're
sure he came in here?"</p>

<p>The young man shook his head. "I said he came in this
direction."</p>

<p>The Inspector, ahead of the others, strode inside and stood
staring around with narrowed eyes. "Might be anywhere by now," he
muttered uneasily. Then he swore softly. "Got the cheek of the
devil himself! Came into my bedroom and lifted that formula almost
under my nose!"</p>

<p>Connolly, his eyes everywhere, said abruptly: "Isn't this the
place with the panel arrangement?"</p>

<p>"By hokey, yes!" Read was already on his way to the opposite
wall. "That's where he's hiding, or I'm a pink Chinaman!" He was
passing one large hand caressingly over the woodwork. "Somewhere
about here, I believe...ah!"</p>

<p>In the heavy silence of the room, the purr of the concealed
machinery was unusually loud. All eyes were focused on that segment
of the wall swinging open with irritating slowness. It gaped wider
and wider...</p>

<p>"Look!" screamed Blaire hysterically, as a woman screams. From
that dark aperture an arm appeared suddenly, hoisted in mock salute
for a moment, then fell limply. With popping eyes, the quartette
saw the figure of a man revolve slowly as the panel opened wider.
They had a breathless glimpse of a pallid face and glassy stare,
then the entire body pitched forward and thudded on to the
carpet.</p>

<p>The purring stopped. Now the panel was wide open.</p>

<p>"Lacey," breathed Read. He shook his head like a man waking from
a dream. "Lacey&mdash;dead&mdash;stabbed in the back..." The
whisper trailed away into silence.</p>

<p>A quarter after two sounded from the clock tower, and in the
stillness it was as though muffled drums beat out the passing of a
human soul.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>CHAPTER NINE. "It seemed to hover
in the air like a bird of prey..."</h2>

<h3>WEDNESDAY, JUNE 19th.</h3>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The hours following the discovery of Lacey's body are among
those which Chief Inspector Read would rather forget.</p>

<p>As he stood staring incredulously at that lifeless husk sprawled
on the carpet, there came a sudden commotion at the door. Turning,
he beheld a little group of people, all in various stages of
disarray, pushing through the door. They spread fanwise into the
room, tousled, weary-eyed, staring down at the latest work of the
fiend. Their faces, twisted in horror, were like masks of the
damned from the Inferno's inner circle. Elsa Hautmann gave a little
choking gasp and would have collapsed but for her father's lean arm
rigidly about her shoulders. Elizabeth Blaire moved like one in the
grip of nightmare. Atherton-Wayne's thin face had that dazed look
one sees on the features of the shell-shocked. Reynolds and Dr.
Newbury stood together. Away in the corner of the room, Blaire was
being quietly sick into a handkerchief...</p>

<p>Then, as though this tightening silence was the breathless pause
between lightning flash and thunderbolt, Read's anger suddenly
blazed forth, awe-inspiring in its vehemence. Had any of them left
their beds that night? Like marionettes they shook their heads.
Atherton-Wayne licked his dry lips. "We heard a revolver shot and
then&mdash;" but Read thundered him down. Had anyone heard any
sound before that? No answer. Who had been in the Oak Room that
evening? Like sheep they stared wide-eyed at him. Like sheep they
huddled together. The Inspector, exasperated at this dumb silence,
shook clenched fists above his head.</p>

<p>"Someone was in my quarters not five minutes ago!" he roared.
"Someone under this roof! That person is standing here in this
room!" Red-faced, his eyes glinting, he scrutinized face after
face. "Who was it? Which one of you stole that formula?"</p>

<p>"Dear God!&mdash;" It was Atherton-Wayne, his face tight and
grey. The Inspector swung round on him and the rest of the sentence
died on the baronet's lips. Read took a step forward and his mouth
tightened ominously.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, all of you!" His words, heavy, spaced, fell into
the silence like stones tossed one by one into some depthless well.
"This game's gone on long enough. I know that the skunk calling
himself The Owl is here in this room, listening to every word.
Here's my bargain with him." Again his narrowed eyes flashed from
face to face. "Step forward and give yourself up and you'll get as
much leniency as the law allows. Otherwise, by God, I swear I'll
never rest until you drop through the gallow's trap at the end of a
rope!"</p>

<p>The big man paused, breathing heavily. He folded his arms slowly
across his broad chest.</p>

<p>"I'm asking you for the last time. Which one of you is this
murderer?"</p>

<p>Twenty dragging seconds passed. The very walls about him were no
more silent than the people in that room. Read's head turned
slowly, as if drawn on a string, taking in a succession of white
faces, uneasy eyes, fluttering uncertain hands. But no figure
moved. Then the Inspector's shoulders gave a twitch. Without taking
his eyes from the group, he spoke to Connolly.</p>

<p>"Take the police car and get into Tilling. Bring the medical
officer out here at once."</p>

<p>Connolly nodded, and was about to move when Read's bark
forestalled him. "Wait a moment&mdash;I'm not finished yet. Go to
the local station and bring back the constable's wife. She's the
nearest approach to a police matron we can hope for down here."</p>

<p>The detective blinked. "Police matron, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Read's mouth had set like a trap, and his lips barely
moved. "Because she's going to search the women in this party while
Donlin frisks the men!"</p>

<p>"You mean...search us?" It was Dr. Hautmann. "Is there to be no
end to these indignities?"</p>

<p>The Inspector ignored him, addressing the room at large. "The
gloves are off now," he snapped. "I've given The Owl a chance to
play ball with me&mdash;and he's refused. Very well. Until I've
proved otherwise, I'm acting on the assumption that every person
now in this room is guilty of murder&mdash;and you're going to be
treated accordingly!"</p>

<p>A rustle of apprehension passed through the room, as palpable as
the ripple of a breeze upon water. But before any person had a
chance to speak, Read continued:</p>

<p>"No person is to move from this room until I give them
permission. There's been far too much soft-soap and blarny about
this investigation, and I'm putting an end to it right now! You
can't go on patting a skunk for ever!" Read paused again, his
jutting jaw an invitation to argue.</p>

<p>Dr. Newbury, his florid face redder than ever, bleated: "All
this is very high-handed, Inspector&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That'll do!" snapped Read, wheeling on him. "You'll have a
chance to air your views in a minute." He nodded to Connolly.
"That's all, Dennis. Jump to it!" And as the detective almost ran
from the room, the Inspector turned back to Newbury.</p>

<p>"Come over here, Doctor."</p>

<p>Newbury approached, eying the big man as a tramp might watch a
savage dog. Read gestured to the body on the floor. "Is that one of
your little souvenirs sticking in his back?" he snapped.</p>

<p>The plump doctor blinked, flashed a glance downwards and turned
back, fingers picking nervously at his lips.</p>

<p>"You mean...the weapon?"</p>

<p>"I meant the weapon," the other assured him.</p>

<p>Newbury nodded. "Yes...it is another of my scalpels..." His
voice, robbed of its fruity quality, trailed away. Then, as the
Inspector continued to stare at him, he gave a sharp squeak of
fear. "Inspector...you don't think that I&mdash;I..." and it was as
though the words choked in his throat.</p>

<p>Inspector Read turned suddenly. "Miss Blaire!" he rapped.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, staring down with horrified concentration, started.
"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Come here, please." The Inspector addressed Newbury again.
"Just where do you keep your instruments?"</p>

<p>"In a case in my drawer..."</p>

<p>"What drawer?"</p>

<p>Newbury licked his lips. "The desk drawer in my room."</p>

<p>"Is it locked?"</p>

<p>"The desk...yes. But the room is open." He swallowed something
in his throat and added: "I&mdash;I have the keys in the Pocket of
my waistcoat behind the door."</p>

<p>Read nodded curtly. "You hear that, Miss Blaire? Go to the
doctor's room, get the keys, unlock that drawer and bring that case
of instruments in here&mdash;" He broke off as Dr. Hautmann made a
movement of protest. "What's the matter with you?" he snapped.</p>

<p>"Didn't I understand you to say, Inspector, that no person was
to leave this room?"</p>

<p>"You did!"</p>

<p>Hautmann's eyes rested on the girl for a moment. "Then I take it
that Miss Blaire, like Caesar's wife, is quite above
suspicion?"</p>

<p>"You can take it what way you like," the Inspector snapped. "Get
going, Miss Blaire, please."</p>

<p>All eyes were fixed on the girl as she moved across the room.
The door closed behind her before Read spoke again. He addressed
Hautmann: "Since you brought up the subject of suspicions, Doctor,
there's one or two questions I'd like to ask you."</p>

<p>Hautmann shrugged. "Indeed?"</p>

<p>"Yes! I've been keeping my weather eye on you and your daughter
ever since you were found prowling around young Blaire's cottage
the first night you arrived."</p>

<p>The doctor said stiffly: "Must we go over all that again? I
thought I had made it clear that I lost my way."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you weren't nosing around to try to get your hands
on the formula?"</p>

<p>Hautmann drew himself up. "Really, sir, there are limits to your
insolence. And I must warn you, sir, that every word of this will
be reported to the Home Secretary!"</p>

<p>"On what authority?"</p>

<p>"The authority of the German Government, of whom I have the
honour to be the representative."</p>

<p>Read did not reply for a moment. Instead, he walked across to
the other and, folding his hands across his chest, fixed Hautmann
with a gimlet eye. Then, slowly, he shook his head. "Come out from
behind the mask, my man! Your name's no more Hautmann than mine is
Shirley Temple! Don't try to bluff it out! We've been in touch with
the German Embassy, and they've never heard of you or your precious
daughter!" Now the silence in the room was electric. It held that
tensed expectation of a tightly packed auditorium watching the
climax of some gripping footlight drama. Only one person moved.
Elsa Hautmann, her eyes unnaturally wide and fathomlessly blue,
reached out a hand and steadied herself against a chair.</p>

<p>Then the doctor spoke.</p>

<p>"Inspector Read," he said, and his tones were gentle, almost
pitying, "you requested me to stop&mdash;er&mdash;bluffing it out.
May I address the same remark to you?"</p>

<p>Read snarled, but somehow the tone was curiously hollow: "What
the devil do you mean?"</p>

<p>In his pale face, the doctor's eyes blazed almost frighteningly.
"You're beaten, Inspector! You've got your back against a wall and
you're fighting desperately&mdash;but already you know it's
completely hopeless. The Owl, whoever he is, has won every round of
this extraordinary game. You have brought the entire resources of
Scotland Yard against this person...and he has laughed them to
scorn. At this moment, as you stand here you have no more idea of
the true identity of The Owl than the moment you stepped into this
house a week ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Inspector's face was scarlet. "That'll do!" he barked.</p>

<p>"No, it won't do," Hautmann assured him. "You've snarled and
snapped at every person under this roof&mdash;and it's time someone
answered you back in your own key. It hurts to be spoken to like
this, because you know what I'm saying is the truth! You're
bluffing, Inspector&mdash;bluffing desperately! You're browbeating
and bullying in the wild hope that you'll stumble on some clue or
frighten some timid person into a false confession!" The doctor's
tone, level before, was now a gibing sneer. "That would suit you
perfectly, wouldn't it? So long as you could clap the handcuffs on
somebody, you could easily manufacture a case around them! But
you'll get no confession from me, Inspector! Because I know just
what you are&mdash;a frightened, bluffing piece of stiff-necked
authority&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By the great living God!" breathed Read. His face, scarlet
before, was now a bright purple. Hands clenched into fists, he took
a step forward, and so menacing was his appearance that Hautmann
recoiled involuntarily. That the Inspector, livid with rage, was
about to lay violent hands on the doctor was beyond contradiction,
and fortunate it was for Read's future career that the interruption
occurred when it did.</p>

<p>At that moment, from somewhere down the corridor, Elizabeth
screamed: "Inspector...quickly! There', strange man&mdash;!" The
sound of a struggle drowned out next words, and almost before the
Inspector had reached the door it burst open. Writhing in the grip
of two policemen was a shabbily dressed, unshaven, middle-aged
person who cowered and blinked in the strong light of the room. The
policemen jerked him forward to where Read was standing, then
backed watchfully to the door where Elizabeth Blaire waited.</p>

<p>Read reached out an ungentle hand, took the bristling chin and
jerked it upward. The newcomer gave a little whimper of fright.</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you?"</p>

<p>The stranger jerked his head away, baring his teeth like an
animal. The Inspector, in no mood for evasion, set his lips and
turned to the constables. "Take this bird outside," he said evenly.
"I'll talk to him there."</p>

<p>But before the two policemen could move, Edward Blaire stepped
forward. In spite of his striped pyjamas and ruffled hair, he moved
with a certain curious dignity. Placing himself between the
newcomer and the Inspector, he addressed Read.</p>

<p>"There's no need for that, sir. This man's been punished
enough."</p>

<p>"Eh? How do you know?"</p>

<p>Blaire said clearly: "This man is my father, Inspector."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The morning dawned grey and cheerless, symbolic of the
atmosphere which permeated the Towers following an extremely
uncomfortable night.</p>

<p>Connolly, with the medical officer and the local constable's
wife, returned shortly after Blaire's announcement in the Oak Room.
Read had waited only long enough to see his men take over, then he
had summoned the ex-convict to his room. The thoroughly cowed
Conway disclaimed all knowledge of The Owl and his whereabouts. He
explained that he had come seeking an interview with his famous
son, and because of his appearance, had climbed in through an open
window. It was shortly after this that Elizabeth Blaire, on her way
to Newbury's room, had seen him lurking in the corridor.</p>

<p>Inspector Read, baffled, tired and ill-tempered, passed the man
over to one of the constables, with the order that he should be
searched and then locked up until the morning. Ten minutes'
conversation with Blaire's father convinced him that this man had
neither the intelligence nor the courage to have planned and
organized this reign of terror, but the testy official was taking
no chances.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a systematic search was taking place.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Dunn, the horny-handed and rather embarrassed
constable's wife, attended to Elsa Hautmann, Connolly and Donlin
went over each of the male guests in turn. They found nothing
pertaining to the case in hand. Whereupon, acting under Read's
orders, they placed two constables in the room to watch the
indignant group and gathering fresh help began to comb the various
rooms. Realizing in full the seriousness of the situation, the
detectives worked slowly and thoroughly, and it was not until three
o'clock in the morning that a tired group of searchers reported
back to their superior.</p>

<p>"Nothing to be found, Chief," yawned Connolly. "The rooms are
blank."</p>

<p>"What about the people?"</p>

<p>"Searched to the skin," was the laconic reply. "Nothing."</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector knuckled bleary eyes. "Might have known it,"
he grunted. "All right&mdash;let 'em get to bed. You'd better get
some shut-eye, too."</p>

<p>Thus, when the gong sounded for breakfast on the following
morning only two people descended. Edward Blaire walked into the
morning-room to find Elizabeth at the window, staring out into a
weeping world. It was a world grown suddenly smaller, hemmed in by
low-hanging, leaden clouds that seemed to brush the tops of the
dripping trees. The wide gardens were deserted except for the
oil-skinned figure of a gardener slouching across the marshy lawn.
So engrossed was the girl in this melancholy scene that she did not
turn until Blaire stood at her elbow.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth..." he said.</p>

<p>She wheeled sharply. "Oh!...Hello."</p>

<p>"Are we the only one down?" And as she nodded, he crossed to the
sideboard and blinked at the silver entrée dishes. "Can I get you
anything?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth shook her head. "No, thanks, Ted. I'm not hungry."</p>

<p>"How about some coffee?" And as she hesitated, "Come on, you'd
better eat something. Just some coffee and toast, eh?" Without
waiting for her reply, he poured a cup, took a piece of toast from
the rack and set them before her at the table. "This might be the
last breakfast you'll eat with me," he told her.</p>

<p>The girl stared. "Why?"</p>

<p>"I'm going away." He was back at the sideboard, helping himself
to a small serving of liver and bacon. "I had a talk with the
Inspector yesterday. He seems to think I'm in some kind of danger
here. I'm going to Vienna for three months."</p>

<p>"When do you leave?"</p>

<p>"As soon as I can." Blaire deposited his plate on the table and
sat down opposite her. "You see, Elizabeth, this money I've earned
with the formula&mdash;it's made rather a difference to everything.
There's my father, for instance..."</p>

<p>Elizabeth was sipping her coffee. Over the rim of the cup, her
eyes were sombre. "You mean...last night's episode?"</p>

<p>"Yes." The young man toyed with his fork. "I've always hated my
father&mdash;he stood for everything I've tried to escape from. But
last night, somehow, it all seemed so pitiable. There he was,
ragged, dirty, cringing...some sort of grotesque parody of a
man&mdash;and yet, my father! I realized, for the first time, that
perhaps he wasn't so much to blame. If circumstances had been
different...if he'd had money to make him independent..." He paused
and pushed aside his plate.</p>

<p>"I'm going to give him a fresh start," he he announced
quietly.</p>

<p>"Ted! That's splendid of you!" Elizabeth reached forth and gave
his fingers a little squeeze. "I always knew you'd turn up
trumps!&mdash;"</p>

<p>Blaire smiled and for a moment it gave his face a queer
attractiveness. "You know, I always used to sneer about the
novelists' theory that trouble brought one face to face with one's
true self&mdash;but dammit all, Beth, there is something in it!" He
was holding her hands now, and his voice was lighter and more
youthful than the girl had ever heard it. "Before all this happened
I was a pretty nasty piece of work! Self-centred, egotistical and
rude! I lived for myself and reckoned that the cares of the world
were just none of my business." He grinned again. "You must have
been pretty well ashamed of me in those times."</p>

<p>"You were rather a trial," the girl admitted.</p>

<p>"It was the poverty that did it, Beth! It's all nonsense to say
that money doesn't bring happiness. It brings independence, a
chance to live decently, to enjoy the good things of life!" He
shrugged. "Oh, I'm no hypocrite! If I've changed, it's partly
caused by what I've been through&mdash;but Sir Anthony's money has
an influence, too. And while I'm not going to wear a hair-shirt and
live in a cave for my sins, I'm at least going to try to make
certain restitution in my own way."</p>

<p>"What do you plan to do?"</p>

<p>Blaire pushed back his chair and lit a cigarette. "First, I'm
going to see that my father enjoys what's left of his life. I'll
set him up on a little farm somewhere, or, if that doesn't appeal
to him, I'll have Pennefeather draw up an annuity. Then I'd like to
endow a scholarship to one of the universities&mdash;I can talk
that over with Sir Anthony."</p>

<p>Elizabeth was smiling. "Now, that sounds more like the old Ted
Blaire I used to know!"</p>

<p>The young man crushed out his newly lighted cigarette on the
edge of his plate. He leaned forward and took the girl's hands
again. His voice was very quiet.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth," he said gently.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"You still think of me as your brother, don't you?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded. "Of course. I think I always will."</p>

<p>Suddenly, inexplicably, he dropped her hands and, rising, walked
across to the window. He said briefly "I thought so!"</p>

<p>Elizabeth was staring at him. "Ted, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>The young man spoke without turning, and he seemed to have some
difficulty with his throat. "I thought perhaps&mdash;perhaps you
might come to look on me as...something else."</p>

<p>"Something else?"</p>

<p>Edward Blaire said slowly: "Your husband."</p>

<p>Elizabeth rose with a suddenness that sent her chair rocking.
For three seconds she gaped open-mouthed, then the smile that broke
about her lips was reflected in her voice: "Ted! That's hardly the
kind of thing to joke about."</p>

<p>Then Blaire turned, and she saw, in dismay, his face grown
suddenly thinner, paler. Behind those thick glasess his eyes burnt
darkly. He said, huskily: "For God's sake, Elizabeth, do I look as
though I'm joking?" Now he came forward, walking a little
unsteadily. "Don't laugh at me&mdash;please! But I've got to tell
you this. I think I've known it a long, long time. I'm in love with
you, Elizabeth...and I've got it badly."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ted...!" It was a long-drawn breath. The girl went to him
and took one thin hand in hers. "Ted, I had no idea you felt like
that! Really&mdash;I just don't know what to say, old boy."</p>

<p>"Don't laugh at me," he said again.</p>

<p>"Of course I won't laugh at you. It's just that...well...I'm
rather touched, I think." Gently, she let his hand drop and moved
away. "It's all such a surprise, Ted."</p>

<p>He made no movement to follow her, but stood by the table
watching. Presently he said: "Well, Elizabeth, you know now."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and what do you think about it?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth shook her head. Her voice was very gentle. "Oh, Ted,
it's all so impossible! Surely you must realize that? We were
brought up as brother and sister."</p>

<p>He said harshly: "But we're not brother and sister."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can never think of you in any other way, old man."
And as he turned away, she went on: "I like you, Ted, and I'm
terribly proud of you&mdash;even more so since you've told me your
future plans. You said just now that you were no hypocrite. Neither
am I. Therefore, it's best that we have this thing out here and
now."</p>

<p>"You don't think...you'll ever change your mind?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth said quietly: "I'm quite certain I won't."</p>

<p>Blaire shrugged. Sitting down in his chair, he began to push the
untasted food about with his fork. "That's because there's someone
else, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?"</p>

<p>Now he looked up. "We're playing the truth game, Elizabeth. Is
there someone else?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded. "Yes."</p>

<p>"Is it Blackburn?" And as the colour flooded into Elizabeth's
face, he gave that old crooked smile. "We're brother and sister,
remember. You can tell me."</p>

<p>"I can only tell you my side of it."</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth Blaire's voice trembled ever so slightly. "We're both
in the same boat, old boy. Love unrequited!" She drew a deep
breath. "Why should I be ashamed of it? Yes, Ted...I'm head over
heels in love with Jeffery. And he thinks so little of it that he
could go off to town without even coming to say good-bye to
me."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The afternoon of the tenth day of the investigation dragged
wearily on.</p>

<p>Inspector Read, sunk in grey melancholy following the loss of
the formula, retired to his study and spent the hours after lunch
alternately pacing the room or sitting hunched over his desk,
pawing at the voluminous notes of the case as if he hoped, by sheer
will-power, to extract some order from the chaos about him. The
unfortunate man was rapidly approaching that mental state which
afflicts the too-frenzied searcher, and he had begun to doubt if he
could have recognized the truth even were it set down plainly
before his eyes.</p>

<p>Dusk was falling over Rookwood Towers when the telephone at his
elbow rang shrilly. Read could scarcely keep the elation from his
voice as Jeffery's tone sounded over the wire. Into Blackburn's
unseen but sympathetic ear, he poured the full chronicle of
frustration, beginning with the stealing of the formula and the
finding of Lacey's body in the Oak Room, and concluding with the
story of Blaire's surprising parentage. The Inspector went on to
mention his suggestion that Blaire should leave the Towers as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>"Seems quite in order to me," Jeffery assured him. "Now that the
trail's getting plainer, the less people to watch the better." Read
almost bit the mouthpiece of the instrument. "Trail getting hot!
You mean&mdash;you're on to something up there?"</p>

<p>"Definitely," the other's voice assured him. And as Read began
to speak, "It's too long to tell you over the 'phone,
Chief&mdash;and what's more, it's dangerous! I've had proof that
the telephone wires down there have been tapped more than
once!"</p>

<p>"H'mm..." The Inspector considered for a moment, then: "What
about the Hautmanns, son?"</p>

<p>"They're genuine enough," was the reply. "I don't knouw what
game they're actually up to at the Towers but they certainly came
into this country with the Government's blessing..." Jeffery's tone
slowed. "And by the way Chief, I'd walk rather warily with those
two. We don't want this thing to develop into an international
crisis." There was a momentary pause and then the voice sounded
almost too casual. "By the Way, how's Elizabeth taking all
this?"</p>

<p>"You come down here and see for yourself," Read grunted.</p>

<p>"You'll see neither hide nor hair of me for another twenty-four
hours," came the reply. "Too busy. But don't start gnawing your
finger-nails, Chief. The end's in sight." They spoke for a few
minutes on various matters and then a far-away click announced that
Jeffery had hung up. Read muttered something deep in his throat and
was reaching for a cigar when a tap came at the door.</p>

<p>It opened to reveal Dr. Hautmann.</p>

<p>"Well?" snapped Read. "And what do you want?"</p>

<p>Hautmann closed the door and came forward. In one hand he
carried a telegraph form. Without speaking, he placed the flimsy
slip of paper on the desk. The Inspector, staring distrustfully at
the figure before him, glanced down at the writing, which was brief
and very to the point.</p>

<p class="telgram">Return immediately. Grave complications
threatening. Council meets Sunday. Essential you be present.
Kessling.</p>

<p>The Inspector looked up, his lips tight. "Well?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>Hautmann shrugged. "Surely that message is self-explanatory?" he
murmured. "I trust, Inspector, that you are not going to
be&mdash;obstinate?"</p>

<p>Read was handing the telegram across the desk. "If by that you
mean&mdash;am I going to let you leave here, the answer is No!"</p>

<p>"And if I were to take the law into my own hands?"</p>

<p>"You'd finish in the local lock-up," the Inspector snapped.
Hautmann did not speak for a few moments. He crossed to the window
and stood looking out into the dusk-filled garden. Read took
advantage of the pause to rise and switch on the light. As he moved
back to his desk he saw that Hautmann had turned and that traces of
a smile played about the thin lips.</p>

<p>"See something funny out there?" the other grunted.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," the doctor replied, "that the garden is as hard
to define as my own course of action. You see, Inspector, I am a
man in a quandary. If I leave this place without your permission, I
am to be thrust into a prison. If I do not leave here, when I
eventually return to my own country I shall be placed in a
concentration camp for disobeying orders."</p>

<p>"Look here&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Hautmann raised his hand. "Let me finish, Inspector, please!
Do you know what happens to a man in a concentration camp in
Germany? I do...because I have seen things which people like
yourself imagined for ever buried with the horrors of the Spanish
Inquisition! During the past week, you yourself have experienced,
in some small measure, terror and suspense. You have probably
wondered why the events under this roof have left me so
undisturbed. It is because, Inspector, I have seen in my own native
Germany horrors beside which the happenings down here pale into
insignificance!" Hautmann stepped forward, and the Inspector was
surprised to see tiny beads of perspiration dewing his forehead.
"And so, my good Inspector, I have no intention of allowing you to
herd me into that living hell!"</p>

<p>Read sat silent, impressed in spite of himself. The doctor, too
expert in the ways of diplomacy to overlook this advantage,
quietened. He folded his arms, and all the former dignity had
returned as he continued:</p>

<p>"Therefore, Inspector, I must follow the orders of that
telegram. I know it is useless for me to tell you again that
neither my daughter nor myself have anything to do with this Owl
criminal. But I am going to make a suggestion to you."</p>

<p>Read said curtly: "I'm listening."</p>

<p>"Let two of your men accompany us during the remainder of the
time we are in this country. Let these men examine our luggage,
investigate our bona fides, follow us every step of the way."
Hautmann spread his hands. "We are quite willing to put up with any
inconvenience if it will persuade you that we are innocent. It will
not be pleasant, but it will be much more palatable than what will
follow the ignoring of this telegram."</p>

<p>Into the Inspector's mind, as he sat considering the
proposition, came an echo of Blackburn's words: "Walk warily with
these two." And it was this, as much as the obvious sincerity in
Hautmann's manner, that decided him. Moreover, no one realized as
much as the Inspector that, technically speaking, he had no
evidence whatsoever on which to hold either Hautmann or his
daughter. And if the doctor chose to make things unpleasant with
the Commissioner...Read leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>"All right," he grunted. "You can go."</p>

<p>Hautmann inclined his head. "Thank you."</p>

<p>"On one condition," continued Read. "We'll forget about sending
anyone out with you, provided you report to headquarters before you
leave the country."</p>

<p>"Willingly!"</p>

<p>The Inspector picked up some papers on his desk. He spoke
without raising his head. "That's all. Now you'd better go before I
change my mind."</p>

<p>The doctor moved noiselessly to the door and paused with his
hand on it.</p>

<p>"Inspector..."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"This Owl person&mdash;haven't you any idea who it might
he?"</p>

<p>Read said curtly: "What's that to you?"</p>

<p>"Only that, having been among the suspects for so long, I would
like to know the truth." The thin tones were edged with mockery.
"It is rather like reading a detective story and becoming very
interested&mdash;only to find the last chapter missing!"</p>

<p>The click of the closing door announced his departure. The
Inspector was still staring moodily before him when a muffled gong
downstairs announced the evening meal.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>In one of the main living-rooms on the ground floor, Elizabeth
Blaire sat by the open window.</p>

<p>Earlier in the afternoon the rain had ceased, and for an hour
the sun had blazed forth with almost angry vigour. Then the clouds
had banked up again, not grey and leaden as before, but dark and
somehow ominous, shot through with the brooding scarlet of the
departing day. Now the air was thick, warm and heavy so that when
the girl had flung wide the window not a breath of air stirred the
shadowy garden. But somewhere beyond the horizon, lightning
flickered palely and then came distant thunder, faint and
ill-tempered, like one turning irritably in sleep. Of a sudden, a
few drops of rain pattered sharply across the garden and were gone,
furtive spies of an army massed somewhere out of sight. Elizabeth
gave a little shiver and glanced uneasily to the west. Here the
clouds had formed like black and lurid billows of smoke, chained in
the act of rising from some vast conflagration.</p>

<p>"Walpurgis night," she muttered.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was this strange electric tension in the air that
plucked at her nerves and set them quivering like harp-strings.
Elizabeth could never remember feeling so restless and disturbed.
She rose and, crossing to the box on the table, extracted and lit a
cigarette. But the tobacco was tasteless and the smoke seemed to
gather chokingly in her throat, so she crushed out the tiny
cylinder almost immediately. And now she stood motionless, fighting
off a queer claustrophobic feeling that the very walls of the room
were closing in on her. Then a beam cracked sharply in the ceiling
and, as she spun round, her hands pressed to her throat, she could
feel her heart pounding and thudding under her fingers.</p>

<p>"This won't do at all," said Miss Blaire sharply.</p>

<p>She returned to the window and looked out, breathing deeply of
the warm damp smell of earth. Suddenly, acting on an impulse, she
gave a half-glance over her shoulder, then, pushing the windows
wider, walked out into the garden. Moving soundlessly on the thick
lawn, she did not stop until the house was some distance behind
her.</p>

<p>Out here, under the trees, the girl felt a sense of freedom.
Turning, she looked back at the dark pile, broken here and there
with lighted windows, seemingly brighter than usual in that heavy,
still atmosphere. Most of the panes were flung wide, and she had
occasional glimpses of the people within. This gave her a sense of
security, and she told herself that if she stayed close to the
house there was no need for her to return indoors for some little
time.</p>

<p>Keeping within hailing distance of those windows, Elizabeth
moved from under the trees and around an angle of the house. A
flicker of lightning, brighter than before, momentarily outlined
the lily-pond just ahead. The girl reached the low stone coping
and, sitting, trailed one hand loosely in the water.</p>

<p>On this side, only a first-floor window was illuminated. This,
Elizabeth knew, was the balconied apartment of the Hautmann couple,
and that patch of flickering gold, so plain against the dark ivy
growth around it, drew her eyes like a magnet. Because of the
elevation, she could not see inside, but waving shadows, passing
and re-passing, told of activity in that room. Sitting below, the
girl's thoughts were as sombre as the garden around her.</p>

<p>Somewhere inside that dark huddle of masonry a murderer lurked.
Yet lurked was scarcely the term, since all had rubbed shoulders
and even talked with this man hiding behind the false face of a
friend. What, she wondered, were his thoughts at that moment? How
much longer would he be free to carry out this grim masquerade?</p>

<p>Suddenly she gave a little gasp, and her eyes became riveted to
that bright window overhead.</p>

<p>On the balcony, peering quickly from left to right, Dr. Hautmann
stood. In the reflected light, Elizabeth recognized him plainly. He
hesitated for a moment, then, pulling a handkerchief from his
pocket, fluttered it over the garden. A moment later he retraced
his steps back into the room, and she heard the click of closing
panes. Almost immediately, the light vanished as heavy curtains
were thrown across the windows. Elizabeth was on her feet, every
muscle tensed, her mind buzzing with new suspicions. What was going
on in that room? If it was something innocent, why close the window
and draw the curtains on such a stifling night as this? Should she
go back to the house and inform the Inspector of what she had seen?
Elizabeth's jaw became stubborn. Apparently Read considered her an
unnecessary nuisance, and she was already convinced that he was the
reason for Jeffery's abrupt departure on the previous day. And if
by chance the Hautmanns were engaged in something quite harmless,
she would only make matters worse by leading the Inspector on what
must turn out to be a useless errand. No, the girl decided swiftly,
this is where I must rely solely on my own discretion.</p>

<p>She crossed the lawn and stood directly under the window,
looking upward. The balcony, with its wrought-iron railing, was
some twelve feet above her head. Elizabeth hesitated a moment,
then, reaching out a hand, felt among the ivy leaves until her hand
encountered a stout tentacle. Dare she risk it? She had never
attempted anything like this before. What would happen if, half-way
up, she were to lose her nerve?</p>

<p>Elizabeth Blaire shook her head, and kicking off her shoes
thrust a silken toe into the wedge of the stem. Then, clinging
desperately, she began to work her way slowly up the face of the
wall.</p>

<p>Slowly, teeth gritted, she moved from hand-hold to hand-hold.
The edges of the leaves, suddenly razor-sharp, scratched her face.
Dry twigs rent her stockings and clawed mercilessly at her legs.
Before she was half-way up, the muscles of her arms ached with the
unaccustomed strain. Twice she almost fell&mdash;once when she
misjudged the strength of a stem and it ripped away in her hand,
and then, more horrifying, when some cold and scuttling body,
disturbed from its green lair, slithered across her face. It was
sheer will-power alone that kept her going and when, after what
seemed an age, her trembling fingers closed about that iron
railing, she hung for a moment shaking and sick with the
effort.</p>

<p>She dared not look down. A final appeal to her numbed muscles
and she was pulling herself up on to the balcony. This last
exertion was almost too much, and as her feet touched the firm
surface she swayed, near fainting. She gripped the cold railing,
drinking in the air with deep sobbing gasps, heedless of the
perspiration that dripped blindingly into her eyes. Down below, the
garden watched silently.</p>

<p>Then she felt better. The world swam into focus, the thumping of
her heart lessened, and she began to look about her. Turning, she
made her way cautiously to the window. Luck was with her! The
curtains had swung aside very slightly, leaving a gap of several
inches. Elizabeth knelt and applied her eye to the opening.</p>

<p>She was looking into the Hautmanns' living-room. Directly
opposite was the door leading to the main corridor. But what held
her eye were three suit-cases in the centre of the floor&mdash;one
already strapped, the others opened and half-filled with clothes.
Even as she watched, Elsa Hautmann walked into the angle of her
view, carrying several folded garments which she proceeded to pack
into the nearest suit-case. And Elizabeth, womanlike, could not
help contrasting her own filthy tattered presence with Miss
Hautmann's elegant and maddeningly chic appearance, so much so that
Miss Blaire felt a wave of hot resentment sweep her as she watched
this lovely creature move gracefully about the task of packing.</p>

<p>So this precious pair thought they were skipping, did they?
Well, not if Elizabeth could prevent it! Here was some definite
news for the Inspector&mdash;but how was she to let him know? Not
for all the wealth of the Indies would she return the way she had
come! There was only one other course&mdash;to wait an opportunity
and&mdash;the next moment the girl's eyes almost started from her
head!</p>

<p>Dr. Hautmann had approached his daughter and was holding her in
earnest conversation. Between his forefinger and thumb the doctor
held a small phial of colourless liquid, and he nodded to it from
time to time as he talked. The closed panes shut out all sound, but
there was no doubting the evidence of Elizabeth's eyes:...</p>

<p>Dr. Hautmann held the stolen formula in his hand!</p>

<p>Here, then, was the explanation of the shrouded window. The
Hautmanns, having successfully accomplished their schemes, were
preparing to depart with their prize! And hard on the heels of this
thought came a further, grimmer realization&mdash;did this mean
that she, Elizabeth Blaire, was seeing for the first time the real
man behind the mask of The Owl? Was this person, standing not half
a dozen feet away from her, the creature responsible for the reign
of terror at Rookwood Towers?</p>

<p>Now there seemed some disagreement in the room. The doctor was
mouthing soundlessly at his daughter, who was gesticulating and
shrugging angrily. If only she could hear what the couple were
saying! Elizabeth rose to her feet and pulled cautiously at the
closed panes. With a little thrill of satisfaction she felt them
move under her fingers. Then the window was not locked!</p>

<p>And now Dr. Hautmann had waved aside some suggestion made by his
daughter. Bending, he slipped that tiny phial under the folded
clothes in one of the open cases. With Elsa following, and
apparently protesting still, the doctor walked away until the hang
of the curtains blocked both people from view. And outside,
Elizabeth was tugging gently at the windows. As they came apart, a
chorus of guttural accents reached her ears. Evidently the argument
was proceeding from another room. The girl insinuated her slender
body between the tall panes and slipped thankfully behind the heavy
curtains. From this temporary sanctuary she surveyed the now-empty
living-room. The Hautmanns were in the adjoining bedroom, and
although the door was partly closed Elizabeth could hear plainly
the agitated rise and fall of their voices. She clenched her hands
tightly. Ever since that window bad moved under her fingers she had
decided on the course of action and she was now about to attempt
the most reckless adventure of her life.</p>

<p>Eyes glued to that bedroom door, she edged slowly through the
curtains, moving closer and closer to the open suit-case.
Nearer...nearer...and with every creak of that treacherous floor
she sweated anew. On the other side of the bedroom door the voices
had softened and there came the sound of a drawer pulled out. And
now...now she was there! A quick fumble among the folded clothes
and her fingers closed around that precious phial!</p>

<p>Feverishly, Elizabeth Blaire turned towards the corridor
entrance, and she could have cried out in sheer exultation. The
door was fast, but the key was still in the lock! Then, throw ing
aside all caution in this last desperate move, she prang forward,
covering the distance in half a dozen striding jumps.</p>

<p>And at that moment the bedroom door opened and Elsa Hautmann
emerged. As her startled eyes fell on the intruder she screamed
shrilly:</p>

<p>"Papa! Papa!"</p>

<p>Elizabeth wrenched at the key, her fingers stiff with fear. And
now Dr. Hautmann was at his daughter's side, peering over her
shoulder. He spat forth a guttural ejaculation and propelled
himself forward like a spring released. But before he could reach
her, Elizabeth had flung wide the door, and wild-eyed, with
streaming hair, was racing for her life down the long corridor.</p>

<p>Even as she ran she knew that this last bold spurt had taxed her
endurance beyond its strength. It was as though she had leapt from
the Hautmanns' room into the heart of a nightmare. The corridor was
fantastically elongated and the walls about her undulated and
receded. She could not feel the floor beneath her flying feet,
instead, she seemed to float along, body and brain numbed by her
terrifying ordeal. Only the dim, unextiguishable subconscious
worked in her mind, guiding her feet around a bend in the passage,
to where the door of her half-brother's room gaped open. With a
little moaning sound she crashed the door wider with her shoulder
and almost falling into the room thrust it shut behind her.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Blaire remembers her blurring eyes taking in the
familiar outlines of the empty apartment, crying wildly,
"Ted&mdash;oh, Ted&mdash;where are you?" and she recollected trying
to reach out towards his chest of drawers...then the dark waves of
unconsciousness swamped her reasoning, and she fell prone to the
floor.</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Elizabeth Blaire knew her face was very cold.</p>

<p>That was all she knew. Just that sensation of intense chill,
Then she realized, in a vague way, that this feeling numbed her
whole body and she must move it to get warm. But it would not move.
She could not reason why. Her mind was smothered under with layer
upon layer of thick black cloth, black cloth sewn with vivid golden
lights and ridiculous faces. The lights would float towards her,
growing larger and then they would explode agonizingly inside her
head. And with each explosion some other part of her brain would
shrink away and struggle maddeningly to free itself from those
black wrappings only to drop back exhausted.</p>

<p>This is death, Elizabeth told herself. Yes. Then distinctly she
heard someone moan. Would she have heard that if she were dead?
Another globule of light burst in her brain, again that nauseating
strain...and Elizabeth opened her eyes on complete blackness.</p>

<p>For some moments she lay quite still, allowing the slow tide of
recollection to wash back. The climbing of the ivy&mdash;that
terrifying venture into the Hautmanns' room&mdash;the finding of
the formula&mdash;the formula! This memory rallied her strength so
that she half-raised herself, fingers smoothing her dress. She
remembered bursting into her half-brother's room with the phial in
her hand...but where was it now? And what had happened to her since
that time?</p>

<p>The shadows about her were opaque. She reached out a hand and
her fingers encountered a cold, rough surface. Elizabeth gave a
little gasp of realization. Once before she had been in a dark
world like this, a world encompassed by these same uneven walls.
Instinctively she recognized it, and the knowledge brought her
trembling to her feet.</p>

<p>She was in one of the underground passages beneath the
Towers</p>

<p>Elizabeth swayed on her feet, sick with the knowledge that she
had failed. This could mean only one thing&mdash;the Hautmanns had
found her as she lay fainting in Blaire's room. They had retrieved
the formula, and to prevent her giving the alarm before they made
their escape had brought her here.</p>

<p>But was it too late even now? She did not know. There was no way
of marking the time that had passed. She did not even know what
part of the passage she was in. Did the Oak Room lie before or
behind her? And as she stood irresolute in the darkness, from
somewhere near at hand came a soft chuckle of amusement.</p>

<p>Elizabeth froze motionless in the darkness. And even as she
listened the unknown laughed again, and to her straining ears came
a new sound&mdash;a curious dry rustling that whispered sibilantly
from wall to wall. Acoustics were confusing in this subterranean
labyrinth, but she fancied the sounds were behind her. She began to
grope her way forward again, only to find the wall suddenly vanish
under her tapering fingers. Elizabeth clawed the air wildly for a
second before she realized she had reached a point where the
passage forked at right angles. She was half-way round the bend
when she saw it.</p>

<p>A dozen yards ahead, a slit of yellow light split across the
rough track from a partly opened stone door set in the wall. As she
watched, the radiance was momentarily obscured by a shadow moving
restlessly before it. Elizabeth recognized at once Jeffery's
description of the room in which he had found her half-brother and
now, craning forward, she could see the light outlining the heavy
iron ring on the door.</p>

<p>With the suddenness of a blind lifting, Elizabeth's brain
cleared. She knew, beyond all doubt, that the terror which for so
long had shadowed Rookwood Towers had now assumed corporeal
appearance in the room beyond. Yet, strangely enough, she felt no
fear, only a sense of overwhelming excitement. It was as though
this new courage flamed through her veins from some hitherto
untapped well in the intricate mechanism of her body and she could
feel every sense suddenly alive and tingling.</p>

<p>She moved forward, step by step, until she reached the door.
Then, pressing flat against the rough-hewn wall, she inclined her
head towards the aperture. Her eyes roamed over the small room,
empty save for a wooden box supporting a lighted candle.
Supporting, too, a long, thin doctor's scalpel, the blade stained
yellow in the reflected light...</p>

<p>And now that steady flame trembled, as though a breeze brushed
it, and again the girl heard that soft rustling sound. She
recognized it now&mdash;the dry swishing of heavy material, rubbing
fold on fold. And into her line of vision walked e creature draped
from head to foot in a long black robe.</p>

<p>The Owl!</p>

<p>Elizabeth pressed close to the wall, only her eyes moving as she
followed the movements in that silent room.</p>

<p>The creature came forward. Black gloved hands placed a third
article on the box, a small glass phial. The unknown turned a
quick, suspicious head left and right and Elizabeth had a glimpse
of a hideous jutting beak below eyes that blazed yellow as the
candle flame. Satisfied, the creature took up the phial, removed
the tiny cork and held the container close to that grotesque parody
of a nose. She heard it sniff...pause and sniff again. Suddenly the
draped body stiffened and, with an almost inarticulate snarl of
rage, the gloved hand threw the phial and its contents into a
corner where it crashed into a hundred fragments against the
wall.</p>

<p>Reaching forward, a gloved hand snatched at the scalpel.
Wheeling, the unknown faced the door and raised the knife high. A
soft, unrecognizable whisper sounded through the room:</p>

<p>"Come inside, Miss Blaire. I am waiting for you."</p>

<p>It was so sudden, so totally unexpected, that Elizabeth's nerve
cracked. She tried to scream, but her tongue seemed thick and
heavy. And at that moment a new, familiar voice spoke over her
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Drop that knife, rat!"</p>

<p>Elizabeth wheeled. "Jeffery!..."</p>

<p>"Look out!"</p>

<p>What happened then was merely a series of blurred impressions on
the girl's mind. She heard The Owl scream and, turning, saw it leap
from the ground, knife raised high. She is willing to swear that it
was already hovering over them when Jeffery's revolver barked
twice. Then the creature was down, rolling, threshing, its black
draperies already stained scarlet, a struggling, twitching tangle
that seemed even more horrible in death than in life.</p>

<p>And presently it lay still. From beneath the dark huddled bundle
a stream of blood moved sluggishly across the stone floor towards
the opposite wall.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was in Jeffery's arms, clinging to him. "Oh,
Jeffery...Jeffery."</p>

<p>"Darling..." Gently he soothed her.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but where did you come from?" Her voice broke and she
cried, unashamed. "I thought you'd gone&mdash;d-deserted me."</p>

<p>Jeffery's arm tightened about her trembling body. "Silly, I've
never been farther away than the village. I've been near you all
the time, Beth...all the while."</p>

<p>"Oh..."</p>

<p>He let her cry for a few moments, then placed his hands on her
shoulders and grinned down at her. "Feel better?" And as she
nodded, sniffing openly, he spoke again. His voice sounded very
deep. "It's all right now. No more danger, sweetheart. It's all
over."</p>

<p>"Thanks to you."</p>

<p>Jeffery took a handkerchief from his pocket and gently wiped her
wet cheeks. "You poor kid," he muttered. "You do look a wreck!" In
the flickering light of the candle, his face was white and hard. "I
suppose you know who we have to thank for all this?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>He was stuffing the handkerchief back into his pocket.</p>

<p>"You mean to say you haven't guessed&mdash;not even after that
business of the formula?"</p>

<p>The girl said steadily: "I don't even know if it's a man or a
woman."</p>

<p>For just a moment, Jeffery paused. Then, turning, he strode
across to the dead body and stood looking down at it. His voice was
very quiet.</p>

<p>"What an end for a criminal genius&mdash;shot down like a dog in
an underground cellar!" He dropped on one knee and grasped the
tangled draperies. "Come closer, Beth. You're going to be the
second person to learn the true identity of The Owl&mdash;and live
to tell about it!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER TEN. "Why do clever people
make the mistake of trying to gild the lily?..."</h2>

<h3>THURSDAY. JUNE 20th.</h3>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>Chief Inspector William Read was back at school. Just why he was
there he could not say, but he recognised the old quadrangle, the
spreading elm at one corner and the broken top of the wall guarded
by broken glass. William Read, a grown man and yet a boy in mind,
was staring up into that elm tree, seeking something among the
tangle of leaves over his head. Presently he saw it. A nest. And
with a fat chuckle Read started to climb, shinning up the knotted
trunk, pulling himself on to the lower boughs and resting,
breathless, for a moment. It seemed to have suddenly grown darker,
as though a cloud had passed across the sun or perhaps it was this
green canopy of leaves over his head that caused the gloom about
him. He glanced up, to shrink back with a quick breath of fear.
Seated on the branch above his head was an owl.</p>

<p>Why the sight of this bird should inspire in his heart such cold
terror he could not reason. He only knew that he sat staring into
those round lidless eyes&mdash;and suddenly it was not an owl but
Dr. Hautmann who sat there. And the doctor clutched in one taloned
hand a scalpel as large as a lance. Slowly, keeping Read hypnotized
with those blazing yellow eyes, Hautmann
advanced...closer...closer...</p>

<p>With a strangled cry Inspector Read awoke, to find himself
sitting bolt upright in his bed at Rookwood Towers. He gave a
rather uncertain snort of disgust and reaching out a hand switched
on the small light over the table by his bed. His eyes moved to the
clock, the hands of which pointed to a few minutes after eleven.
His mind had scarcely taken in this fact when it registered
something else that set him knuckling his eyes in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Great sufferin' cats!" he muttered. "Am I still dreaming?"</p>

<p>He looked again. Propped up against the clock was a small glass
phial of colourless liquid!</p>

<p>"The formula!" gasped Read. He reached forward and picked up the
phial, smoothing it in his fingers. "But how the devil did it get
here?"</p>

<p>From the shadows of the room a voice spoke lightly: "Why, Chief,
I put it there five minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Jeffery!" roared the Inspector. And in that moment there came a
click of a switch, and the room was flooded with light. Mr.
Blackburn, a little tousled but with an almost seraphic smile on
his not unprepossessing countenance, leaned against the door. Read
almost bounded from his bed. "Son! What the devil are you doing
here? I thought you were in London!"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" Jeffery was lighting a cigarette. "That's just what I
intended everyone to think." He came forward, brushing his hair
into place. "Actually, Chief, I was never farther away than the
'Green Man.'"</p>

<p>"Then your telephone calls came from the inn?"</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded. "It was necessary, Chief. The Owl would never
have moved while I was around here. He was suspicious of me for
some time. But he hadn't proof that I knew his true identity until
I stole that formula from your room."</p>

<p>Read's face was purple. "You&mdash;you stole it?"</p>

<p>"Of course." Jeffery nodded calmly. "It was vitally important
not to let The Owl get that formula into his clutches. Once he had
destroyed it all proof of his guilt might have been lost."</p>

<p>Read sat down on the bed. "I <i>am</i> still dreaming," he
muttered. "I must be!" Suddenly he became aware of the phial in his
hand. "Son, we'd better get this back to Atherton-Wayne before The
Owl makes another attempt.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Owl will make no more attempts, Chief. He's dead."</p>

<p>"Dead?"</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded. "I shot him, not half an hour ago, down in the
vaults."</p>

<p>There was a long pause. Read drew a deep breath, expelled it and
stretched out a hand. "Gimme a cigarette, son," was all he said,
but the request was so unexpected that Jeffery blinked. As Read lit
up, the younger man could see his fingers shaking slightly. Then,
puffing smoke with all the vigour of the novice, the Inspector took
his dressing-gown from the bed-rail and began to slip into it. As
he tied the strings about his waist he spoke again.</p>

<p>"Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"I routed out Connolly and Armstrong," Jeffery replied. "They've
put him in the room where Lacey was imprisoned."</p>

<p>Read said curtly, "Come along," and throwing open the door, he
led the way down the darkened corridor. Neither man spoke until
they came to the room at the far end. Then Read paused with his
hand on the door-knob.</p>

<p>"He's in here?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"It is a he?"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," returned Mr. Blackburn. "Go in, Chief, and see
for yourself."</p>

<p>The door creaked open. The room inside was a well of shadows,
blacker than the corridor outside. Read fumbled about the door-jamb
and clicked on the light switch.</p>

<p>Stretched out in the centre of the room was a figure almost
enveloped in the dark draperies of The Owl's costume. Read dropped
the cigarette from his lips and crushed it under his foot. He
crossed the room in three quick paces and halted over the body.
There was a strange hesitation in his manner as he stood there.</p>

<p>Jeffery was by his side. "What's the matter, Chief? Afraid to
look on this man's face?"</p>

<p>Read said uneasily: "Dammitall, son, I think I am."</p>

<p>"Then let me help you!" Jeffery dropped on one knee and,
grasping the dead man's shoulder, swung the body over. The light
blazed pitiless on the white face, malignant even in death, Read
stared down at that countenance for five long seconds and when he
spoke his tone was a dry sick whisper.</p>

<p>"Oh no, son. You&mdash;you've made some ghastly mistake..."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"But..." the Inspector seemed to have some trouble with his
throat. "This man...<i>this is Edward Blaire!</i>"</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded. "Exactly! Edward Blaire was The Owl, Chief. I've
known it for the past two days."</p>

<p>"But..." Read dipped into the pocket of his dressing-gown and
produced the phial. "Why should the lad go about murdering to
obtain a valuable formula that was his in the first place?"</p>

<p>"For the simple reason, Chief, that the contents of that phial
isn't and never was valuable." Jeffery bent down and pulled the
drapings over that twisted face. "There's nothing in that phial
save ordinary petrol&mdash;that's why Blaire was so keen to destroy
it before Atherton-Wayne's chemists discovered the truth!"</p>

<p>"By hokey," breathed Read. "And Atherton-Wayne&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The innocent victim of it all," replied Jeffery quietly. "You
see, Chief, this whole thing was nothing more or less than a
brilliantly planned scheme to rob Atherton-Wayne of fifty thousand
pounds!"</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>The death and final revelation concerning The Owl was good red
meat to the Press, and on the afternoon of the following day the
obituary of Edward Conway, alias Blaire, was flung across
innumerable front pages in inch-high capitals. The gentlemen of the
Press besieged the Towers, armed with pencils and sharp-eyed
cameras, and only those scribes who came for personal interviews
were dissatisfied. Because, only a few hours before, Dr. Hautmann,
his daughter and Reynolds fled from the Towers like prisoners from
some grim bastille. Dr. Newbury barricaded himself in his own
cottage, while Atherton-Wayne placed Connolly and Donlin outside
his apartment to repel the inquisitive. Elizabeth did the same. No
detectives guarded her, but after one pushing young man had thrust
his foot in her door, and was promptly thrown half-way along the
corridor by an irate Jeffery, further precautions were not
needed.</p>

<p>Inspector Read was, naturally, the focal point of much of this
activity, and it was not until late that same afternoon that he had
a breathing-space. At five o'clock he dismissed the last of the
reporters and called Jeffery to his room. The young man found him
leaning back in his swivel chair, feet on his desk, and a cigar
thrust into his mouth.</p>

<p>"Well, son," was his greeting, "now we can get together at
last!"</p>

<p>Jeffery took the seat he indicated. "What's puzzling you,
Chief?"</p>

<p>"Everything," the other grunted. "You're in bad with me, son,
over that formula business. You'd better make your excuses pretty
valid, too!"</p>

<p>"All right." Jeffery leaned back. "Here's the whole thing in a
nutshell, Chief. Edward Conway, to give him his real name, was a
pretty bad lot. Oh yes, he was brilliant when it came to studying,
I'll grant you, but he had inherited a strong criminal strain from
his father. He realized, pretty early in the piece, that he'd never
make much money working for Atherton-Wayne. So he evolved this plot
to swindle the baronet out of fifty thousand pounds. Like most
crooked business, all kinds of complications occurred, and
eventually the thing got right out of hand. That's when Conway got
desperate. But I'm anticipating things.</p>

<p>"We'll never know the actual truth, because the two main
characters&mdash;Conway and Lacey&mdash;are dead. But we've enough
evidence to fill in the missing gaps fairly satisfactorily. I
believe that, when Conway thought out this scheme, he wanted
somebody crooked to help him. His first idea was his father, but
Conway senior was languishing behind prison bars. I've evidence
from the Scrubbs that Conway visited his father fairly frequently,
and they must have talked over this scheme. It would be Conway
senior who put his son into touch with Lacey."</p>

<p>"Quite probable," nodded Read.</p>

<p>"The scheme," Jeffery continued, "was perfect in its utter
simplicity. Conway would pretend to discover this remarkable
formula. Using ordinary petrol he would convince Atherton-Wayne
that he had really unearthed an amazing discovery. By proclaiming
this discovery far and wide it was certain that other bidders would
rise to the bait. As a matter of fact, Hautmann was the only one.
But Conway needed another to boost up the price, so Lacey came down
in the role of Todhunter. You know what happened, Chief. By his
very meanness, the baronet was forced into the position of paying
fifty thousand for the worthless formula. Now Conway had a small
fortune, and he was quite safe so long as nobody suspected the
trickery."</p>

<p>"But what about The Owl?"</p>

<p>"We're coming to that," Jeffery assured him. "Now Conway was
only safe as long as no expert analyst could see that supposed
formula. In other words, once Atherton-Wayne's chemists got hold of
that phial, Conway's plan was ruined. Therefore, it was essential
to keep the formula from their hands. But how to do that? Here
again Conway showed brilliant cunning. What does he do but create a
false figure&mdash;literally an invisible man&mdash;a criminal
calling himself The Owl. If The Owl, alias Conway, steals the
formula and destroys it, it can never be proved that the whole
thing was a fake!"</p>

<p>Read sat up abruptly. "But wait a minute, son! These Owl
robberies took place weeks before Conway discovered this
formula&mdash;and we have proof that he was down here working in
his laboratory at the time."</p>

<p>"Exactly!"</p>

<p>"Then how the heck could he be in two places at once?"</p>

<p>"He wasn't," returned Jeffery. "It was Lacey who committed those
robberies."</p>

<p>"Lacey!"</p>

<p>Jeffery rose to his feet and began pacing the floor. "This thing
is as deep as the inferno, Chief. You've got to admire Conway's
cunning! You see, if this creature called The Owl had suddenly
sprung out of nowhere and demanded the formula, we might have been
suspicious. But Conway foresaw that. And so, weeks before, he plots
with Lacey to begin a series of robberies, impressing this Owl
creature on the public mind! Remember how The Owl used to leave
visiting-cards everywhere and warn his victims in advance? We
couldn't understand it at the time, but it was all part of the
plot. The personality of The Owl was to be created so that, when
Conway was ready to use this mythical creature to cover his own
crime, we would be quite willing to accept The Owl as a tangible
and dangerous creature." Jeffery paused, and his voice rose. "Do
you remember, when we interviewed Conway after his supposed
kidnapping by The Owl and imprisonment in the vaults, you said it
seemed as though we were looking for an invisible man?</p>

<p>"Well, we actually were, Chief. Because, at that stage, there
was no such person as The Owl!"</p>

<p>Read sucked at his cigar. "I remember." He cocked an eye at the
younger man. "I saw a funny expression cross your face then. That's
when you started to get suspicious, I suppose?" And as Jeffery
nodded, "So Lacey started The Owl robberies, eh?"</p>

<p>"No doubt about it," Blackburn returned. "Remember how, that
night at the 'Green Man,' we reviewed those early robberies and
decided they were the work of a professional criminal&mdash;someone
who had spent the best part of a lifetime in crime? Naturally, it
was Lacey! That's why there wasn't any bloodshed connected with
them&mdash;Lacey isn't a killer. As I see it, Conway and Lacey were
working hand in glove to split the fifty thousand between
them."</p>

<p>Read nodded.</p>

<p>Jeffery continued his restless pacing. "Now, the moment this
mythical Owl began to send his warning cards to Conway, things
began to go wrong. For one thing, Elizabeth brought us down here.
Remember how churlish Conway was about police protection, and how
we put it down to his temperament? Naturally, the police were the
last people he wanted about the place. So he staged that very
clever little scene in his cottage, hoping that we'd get such a
shock we'd clear out. You'll remember, also, that having put that
pistol among the flowers himself, he wasn't at all keen to open
that drawer."</p>

<p>"And what about Ashton's murder?"</p>

<p>"That was necessary, because Ashton must have learnt something
dangerous to the success of the scheme. What it was we'll never
know, but having killed the secretary, Conway was now up to his
neck in trouble. It was more than ever important to establish that
The Owl was down at the Towers, so what does Conway do? Have Lacey
truss him up in a strait jacket and dump him where someone will be
sure to find him."</p>

<p>"I don't see that," Read objected. "How could Conway have known
you were going down into that passage?"</p>

<p>"He couldn't possibly have known," returned Blackburn. "But if I
hadn't gone down there at that precise moment, you may be sure that
Lacey, in the guise of Todhunter, would have either guided my steps
into that underground room or discovered Conway, apparently by
chance, himself. We know that Lacey was down in the passage because
of the cigarette end I found burning down there."</p>

<p>Jeffery paused to light a cigarette. And Read observed: "I can
fill in the next murder myself, son. Conway stabbed
Atherton-Wayne's brother, thinking it was the baronet, and hoping
to rob the body of the formula."</p>

<p>"Quite so." Blackburn tossed the match-end through the open
window. "Knowing nothing about the brother, he'd seen Mrs. Tamworth
taking those clothes to the baronet's room. The killing of Lacey is
even more understandable. Not only did the crook know far too much
for Conway's peace of mind, but his murder saved Conway splitting
the fifty thousand. Apart from that, I rather suspect Lacey was
getting terrified. He hadn't reckoned on murder when they evolved
this scheme, and as killing followed killing he realized that he'd
allied himself to a criminal lunatic! Lacey, I surmise, was willing
to talk to save his own skin&mdash;and Conway meant to prevent that
happening at all costs."</p>

<p>"When did you start to suspect Conway?"</p>

<p>"I had faint suspicions after Ashton's death," Jeffery returned.
"These were clinched on the following day&mdash;I'll tell you how
in a minute. But after you suggested I go to town, I realized that
the formula was most unsafe so long as it remained at the Towers. I
went only as far as the inn, returned that same night and stole the
phial out of your room. For a reason I'll explain directly, I
daren't let you know I was the thief. But I took the liquid to the
local chemist and asked him what it was. Not that I didn't know,
but I wanted as much evidence as possible. He reported it to be
ordinary petrol. And then I knew I was on the right track."</p>

<p>Read shifted in his chair. "How about this other phial of
liquid&mdash;the one Elizabeth took from the Hautmanns' room last
night?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that?" Jeffery grinned. "You know, Chief, the Hautmanns
were very desperate. They were sent here to get that formula, and
they weren't relishing the idea of returning without it. So they
got hold of a phial the same size and shape, filled it with water,
and were waiting for a chance to substitute it for what they
believed was the real thing."</p>

<p>"By hokey," snorted the Inspector. "So that was their game! I'll
pick 'em up&mdash;" but Jeffery interrupted.</p>

<p>"Better not, Chief. They've been punished enough. Besides, we
don't want to start any international complications. Matters are
touchy enough with Germany as it is."</p>

<p>"But didn't they shove Elizabeth into that passage?"</p>

<p>Blackburn shook his head. "I don't think so. That would be
Conway's doing. He probably found her unconscious on the floor of
his room with the phial in her hand. He pulled her into the
passage, took the formula and donned his regalia, to make his last
and final appearance. But when he came to examine the phial, all he
had was clear water." Jeffery frowned. "That's why he attacked
Elizabeth&mdash;he probably thought she knew much more than she
did. Fortunately, I was on the spot just in time."</p>

<p>The inspector leaned forward and broke the ash from his cigar in
the tray. "Lacey and Conway working this Owl stunt between them
gave Conway those alibis for the time The Owl was seen prowling
about, I suppose?" And as the other nodded: "But for the life of
me, son, I can't see how you tumbled to it like that!"</p>

<p>Jeffery returned to his chair and sitting, leaned back with his
hands clasped behind his head. From this position he addressed the
ceiling of the room and his tone was thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Why is it that these criminals are never content to let well
alone? We've all heard of the person who tries to be too
clever&mdash;and in overdoing a perfect situation destroys
everything he so carefully sought to build. Here was Conway with an
almost water-tight plot, the result of inspired cunning. Now, had
he been content to leave it as it was, the chances are that he
would be walking around at this moment a free man. But no&mdash;he
must elaborate, add a touch here, another point there until finally
he brought the whole edifice crashing down about his ears."</p>

<p>Read grunted. "What's all this leading up to, son?"</p>

<p>Jeffery sat up and eyed the older man across the desk. "Do you
remember Conway's story of his kidnapping, Chief? It was a most
impressive recital&mdash;particularly the part about hearing the
tapping on the window, pulling the curtains aside and finding The
Owl waiting for him. If only he'd have had the sense to stop there.
But no! He must dramatize the situation by making himself a
hero."</p>

<p>"You mean the part about his fighting with The Owl and making
his nose bleed?"</p>

<p>"Exactly!" snapped Blackburn. "From the moment those words were
out of his mouth my suspicions were aroused! For one thing, it was
essentially out of the character of Conway as we knew him at that
time. For another, no person under the roof of the Towers was
marked about the face in any way. Yet we were acting on the
assumption that The Owl was among the guests. Therefore, we were
faced with one of two alternatives&mdash;either The Owl was someone
whom we had not yet seen, or else Conway was telling a deliberate
lie."</p>

<p>Read nodded. "That occurred to me, son. But I thought Conway
might have concocted the story just to show he wasn't a
coward."</p>

<p>"Oh no, Chief, that wouldn't wash, because there was direct
evidence in the room that blood <i>had</i> been shed! Remember
those spots on the carpet and the curtains?" Jeffery frowned. "When
I saw those bloodstains I admit I was stumped. For here was clear
proof of the blood! Then it meant that The Owl was someone with
whom we had not yet come into contact. And that's how matters stood
until you, quite by chance, happened to mention the affair of the
housemaid's rabbits."</p>

<p>The Inspector's jaw dropped. "What rabbits?"</p>

<p>Blackburn chuckled. "Have you forgotten as easily that? On the
day following Conway's supposed kidnapping, one of the maids
waylaid you in the corridor and asked you to find two pet rabbits
that were missing&mdash;remember? I told you that this
disappearance had a direct connection with The Owl case&mdash;and
you thought I was merely being facetious." His tone sobered. "Oh
no, Chief, those two innocent little bunnies were instrumental in
proving that if Conway wasn't actually The Owl, at least he was
definitely hand in glove with the creature."</p>

<p>"So that was the reason for all your vague mutterings about owls
preying on rabbits, eh?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" Now an excited Jeffery was on his feet again. "You
see, Chief, the bloodstains in Conway's room must have come from
somewhere. If it were human blood, then Conway was telling the
truth. But if those spots were animal blood, Conway was not only
telling a deliberate lie, but it also explained the disappearance
of those rabbits."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"Waited for a suitable opportunity&mdash;and that same night,
took the curtains from Conway's room and cut out the stained spots.
I sent these up to our analyst"&mdash;and here Jeffery's tone
trembled at the recollection. "The following day, Chief, the
thrice-blessed answer came back. The spots were undoubtedly
rabbit's blood!"</p>

<p>"By hokey!" breathed Read.</p>

<p>Jeffery leaned over the desk, ticking off the points on his
fingers.</p>

<p>"Now, Chief, follow the links in my chain of reasoning. Conway
had lied deliberately about that blood&mdash;he had not fought with
The Owl at all. Therefore, why go to all this trouble about
stealing and slaying rabbits merely to convince us that he had? And
suddenly, I had the first suspicion of the truth! Was it an attempt
to actually <i>prove</i> that The Owl really
existed&mdash;moreover, to prove the creature was really inimical
toward him? But we were already prepared to accept these facts. Why
take this elaborate means to underline them?</p>

<p>"And then, Chief, I took the case from the other angle. I let
myself assume that The Owl did not exist at all&mdash;and that
Conway had invented all this elaborate fiction about kidnapping and
warning cards and threats of murder."</p>

<p>Jeffery paused for a moment, then resumed.</p>

<p>"I went up to my room, and over a packet of cigarettes
considered the affair from the beginning. After some deliberation I
discarded the idea that The Owl did not exist, for we had the
evidence of the robberies while Conway was down here. But why
should Conway invent this story about being terrified of The
Owl&mdash;why this stupid masquerade? He had given us to understand
that The Owl was after his formula. The formula! That seemed the
crux of the whole business. And then there flashed into my mind a
thought that almost stood my hair on end! There and then, for the
first time, I realized that <i>we had nothing save Conway's bare
word that he had discovered anything at all!</i>"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" began Read when an excited Jeffery talked him
down.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Chief, we had seen a carefully staged demonstration.
But it was a demonstration that could have been made quite
successful by the use of ordinary petrol! We saw a motor-car engine
set in motion by what looked like petrol. Of course! Because the
miraculous formula Number Four that Conway showed us on that day
was nothing more or less than a phial of ordinary petrol!"</p>

<p>Jeffery, his eyes glittering and his face alight, waited for the
elder man to comment.</p>

<p>The Inspector nodded. "Smart work, son," he grunted. "Go
on."</p>

<p>"Now then, if Conway hadn't discovered any formula, all this
nonsense about The Owl's persecution was lies from start to finish.
And hard on the heels of this realization came another disturbing
thought. Surely Conway would never dare such far-fetched trickery
as this? Why, Atherton-Wayne's chemists would reveal the swindle at
first glance! But suppose&mdash;just suppose&mdash;that Conway
could sell the fake formula to the baronet, receive his money, and
then destroy the liquid before the chemists could examine it? But
how could Conway possibly achieve this end? Was not The Owl after
the formula also?"</p>

<p>Jeffery tossed his cigarette aside and faced Read. "And then,
Chief, the whole astounding plot came suddenly dear. Conway
<i>was</i> The Owl! He had invented this creature entirely as an
excuse for the destroying of the formula before Atherton-Wayne's
chemists could reveal the fake!"</p>

<p>The Inspector considered this for a moment, greying brows down
over narrowed eyes. "But, son, what about Conway's alibis? Take
that night, for instance, when Elsa Hautmann saw The Owl dumping
the strait jacket into the lily-pond. You admitted yourself that
you sat up with Conway the entire night!"</p>

<p>"Quite so," Jeffery agreed. "There was still a number of points
to be straightened out. Regarding this particular incident, I
remembered that the invitation to share Conway's room that night
came from Conway himself. He buttonholed me in the corridor with
the tale that he was scared to sleep alone, and would I
metaphorically hold his hand all night. But this merely made the
situation clearer. Conway obviously had a colleague&mdash;someone
who would parade as The Owl when Conway needed an alibi. And the
moment I realized this, other hitherto puzzling factors slipped
neatly into place. For instance, The Owl robberies while Conway was
working down here miles away from the city." Jeffery paused, then
continued quickly: "It also explained Conway's kidnapping, and
piecing this together with the smouldering cigarette-end I found in
the vaults I realized Mr. Todhunter must have had something to do
with it.</p>

<p>"Finally, when Todhunter was revealed as Lacey, an American
crook, the whole thing dovetailed perfectly. And Lacey's death was
the final clinching piece of evidence. Obviously, Conway had killed
him to close his mouth."</p>

<p>Read nodded again. "When had you figured out all this, son?"</p>

<p>For the first time during his recital Jeffery revealed a slight
hesitation. "A few hours before you sent me up to town," he
confessed.</p>

<p>Read was on his feet, glaring at the younger man. "Then why the
devil didn't you tell me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Because," replied Jeffery, "you would have arrested Conway
there and then."</p>

<p>"And didn't you want him arrested?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Read snapped: "Why not?"</p>

<p>Jeffery said clearly: "Because, at that time, I thought he was
Elizabeth's brother."</p>

<p>"Oh!..." It was a long-drawn-out breath, expelled from between
Read's tight lips. The anger died from his face, and the glint in
his eyes was replaced by something very near a twinkle. "So it's
like that, son?"</p>

<p>Jeffery nodded. "Yes, Chief," he said quietly. "It's like that."
He was silent for a moment, making his way back to his chair. The
Inspector waited for him to speak.</p>

<p>"It was the very devil of a situation for me, Chief," Jeffery
said at length. "It meant that I had to betray as a cold and
calculating murderer the brother of the girl I loved. And I
couldn't bring myself to do it! I'm no policeman&mdash;I've taken
no oath about this arresting business." The young man gave a little
shrug. "I think those few hours, following that realization, will
be among the blackest of my life!"</p>

<p>Read resumed his seat. "Well, son," he said at length, "you must
have been mighty relieved when I told you over the 'phone yesterday
that Edward Blaire was really Edward Conway."</p>

<p>Jeffery's face lit up. "Chief," he exclaimed, "I could have
hugged you! You'd removed the last remaining obstacle from my path!
I came back here last night and hid in the vaults. I felt sure that
my theft of the formula would force Conway's hand in some way, and
so I waited...And the rest you know."</p>

<p>A silence fell upon the room. Outside the fading day trailed
drapes of russet and gold across the western sky. From the big elm
near the open window came faint rustlings as the rooks settled for
the night. The Inspector rose to his feet and, walking across to
the door, switched on the light. As he turned:</p>

<p>"Well, son," he grunted, "it's been a long and exciting chase.
But I can't help repeating what I said here in this room three days
ago&mdash;if you hadn't got entangled in petticoats, the case would
have been over in half the time."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;holding up the information because I believed
Conway to be Elizabeth's brother?"</p>

<p>Read nodded. "Sure!" He raised quizzical eyes to the young man's
face. "You must be pretty keen, Jeff, to do a thing like that to an
old man."</p>

<p>Jeffery shrugged. "I'm sorry, Chief." His voice was low. "It was
one of those things one just can't control. I know I was putting
Elizabeth before you, before my job, before my respect for law and
order, even&mdash;but, well, it just couldn't be helped. That's how
I feel about that girl." He stepped forward and put his hands on
Read's broad shoulders. "You understand, don't you, Chief?" His
tone was almost pleading.</p>

<p>The distress in Blackburn's face was too patent to ignore.
Read's granite countenance relaxed. "Sure I do, son," he grunted.
"But that girl ought to feel damned honoured. You've done more for
her than any other man would."</p>

<p>Jeffery shook his head. "No, Chief. Ashton did precisely the
same thing."</p>

<p>The Inspector stared at him. "That secretary?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Remember that envelope he sent Elizabeth, the one she
thought contained the name of The Owl?"</p>

<p>Read nodded. "The enclosure that Dr. Newbury stole?"</p>

<p>"Dr. Newbury didn't steal it," the other returned quietly, "for
the simple reason that the enclosure was never put in that
envelope.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"We'll never know for certain," the young man continued, "but we
can be sure that Ashton discovered that Conway was The Owl. Not
knowing the criminal's true parentage he addressed that letter to
Elizabeth and was about to enclose the name of the man he knew as
Edward Blaire, when he realised the sickening shock Elizabeth must
get to open the letter and find that the murderer was her own, as
Ashton thought, brother. So he didn't put anything in that
envelope. In the excitement of Conway's supposed kidnapping, he
forgot to destroy it. It must have got in among Ashton's business
correspondence, and been posted in the ordinary way by the
servants." He paused and smiled. "You see, Chief, that poor chap
also loved Elizabeth very much."</p>

<h3>* * *</h3>

<p>"Jeffery," called Elizabeth softly.</p>

<p>It was an hour later. Blackburn was waiting by the summer-house
in the garden. The sun had set. Now the sky overhead was a deep
purple canopy, picked out here and there with the first brave
stars. But brighter than these were Elizabeth's eyes as she came up
and took his hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said.</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"I've been talking to the Inspector," the girl said quietly.</p>

<p>"He told me about you keeping certain information
because&mdash;because of me..." Her voice trembled a little, but
she steadied it. "Jeffery, why did you do it?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Mr. Blackburn, "I happen to love you very
deeply."</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling!"</p>

<p>He took her in his arms and kissed her, and they were silent,
for this was a time when no words were needed. Presently, Elizabeth
raised her eyes to his.</p>

<p>"You know that&mdash;that my half-brother wanted to marry
me?"</p>

<p>"I'm not surprised."</p>

<p>"He asked me yesterday, in the morning-room. When I refused, the
strangest look came over his face." She paused, and her voice was
very low when she added: "I think I knew the truth&mdash;then."</p>

<p>Jeffery, holding her tightly, could feel her trembling in his
arms.</p>

<p>"That was why he meant to kill me, I think. If you hadn't been
there by my side..." She shivered, and her voice trailed away.</p>

<p>Jeffery said quietly: "I'm always going to be by your side from
now on."</p>

<p>Then he kissed her again, and after a pause: "The Inspector's
going to be awfully furious with me," Elizabeth told him.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"He thinks I'll come between you and your work." She was very
sincere. "I may, too, darling. I love you so much that when I think
of the risks you take my heart just stops beating."</p>

<p>Jeffery smiled. "I have it all planned," he told her. "I shall
pack you off to your parents while I muddle about with my
criminals."</p>

<p>"Sweetheart, I have no parents."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no."</p>

<p>"You're all I have in the wide world. Darling, be very, very
careful, for my sake, won't you?"</p>

<p>In the darkness he held her closely. "I promise," he said.</p>
