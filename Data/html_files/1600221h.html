  <p class="first">"GOOD LORD!" said the young man under his breath. "Oh, good
  lord!"</p>

  <p>Not that he was the least frightened, for he was not that sort of young
  man at all. He was broad of shoulder and lean of flank, and his clean shaven
  lips had a flickering suggestion of humor about them. Not that they were
  smiling now&mdash;far from it.</p>

  <p>For the young man with the courage of an athlete and the litheness of a
  tiger was in a tight place. He had come into it partly out of curiosity,
  partly out of mere love of adventure, and wholly because a certain girl was
  in the business. The mere fact that he had not the remotest idea who the girl
  was gave zest to the situation. And now he was getting an idea.</p>

  <p>The President had been speaking. Sad to say the President was exceedingly
  bloodthirsty. He looked small and mean and narrow, a little twisted scrap of
  humanity; but then he belonged to the half-delirious, half-mad class that
  provides copy for the daily papers. These men shake the steps of a throne
  sometimes.</p>

  <p>The President was masked, like everybody else. There were a score or two
  of men in that dingy, ill-lighted cellar in Marenna that night, and two were
  women. It was when the girl that the young man had followed clapped her hands
  vigorously that the young man in question said "Good lord!" under his
  breath.</p>

  <p>It may be asked why the young man was so obviously out of place, and how
  he found himself in the company of those dangerous outcasts at all. In the
  first place he was a writer of fiction, who was doing pretty well for
  himself; and in the second place, he had the means of going anywhere so far
  as Marenna and the Kingdom of Asturia was concerned. How he came by that
  privilege will be seen in good time.</p>

  <p>The President was very angry. He had a grievance against the Grand Duke of
  Asturia, and was naturally anxious that the potentate in question should be
  "removed." That was why the Brotherhood of the Ruby Cross had met that night.
  The President was a chemist with some original views on the question of
  nitro-glycerine. He produced from his pocket a tiny glass tube no thicker
  than a lead pencil and no longer than his little finger, and proceeded to
  explain its potential abilities and scope. The tube, expelled by a peashooter
  for the distance of a score of yards or so, would destroy anything living
  within the radius of an average dining-room. The brother (or sister) upon
  whom the pleasing task of the "removal" fell would be quite safe. The thing
  might be done from a garret window as the Grand Duke took his daily ride
  along the Winterstrasse, and not a soul but the operator be any the
  wiser.</p>

  <p>"This is very interesting," the young man muttered behind his mask. "It
  would be still more interesting if the task fell to me. Really, this is a
  matter for the police. It wouldn't be safe to let a joke like this go too
  far."</p>

  <p>Generally speaking there was no opposition to the President's scheme. He
  appeared to be a man gifted with considerable persuasive powers. The simple
  idea was to draw lots. Once that was done the rest was comparatively easy. A
  room would be taken and the necessary weapon and charge handed over to the
  "martyr," who would "pot" the Grand Duke at his leisure. It all sounded very
  ridiculous, but then these things have been done in circumstances equally
  commonplace and sordid.</p>

  <p>The atmosphere of the cellar was hot and sickly. The feeble rays of the
  lamp only rendered the shadows more black and sinister. From a box the
  President produced a number of wooden balls to the exact number of the
  assembled conspirators. All the balls were white save one. And the person who
  drew the black ball from the little hole in the box would do the needful. The
  whole thing was delightfully simple.</p>

  <p>The young man took his ball with the rest and laid it on the table. It was
  a white ball, so that the charge of the martyr's crown was gone so far as he
  was concerned. He saw many other white balls laid on the table, but not one
  of them deposited by the girl, whom he was watching so closely. He was
  conscious of a tightening across the chest. Was it possible . . . . . ?</p>

  <p>It was. There could be no doubt of it. For when the girl dipped her hand
  in the box she was the last to do so, and every other ball on the table was
  white. She held up the sinister sphere presently so that everybody could see
  it. The slim, white hand with its twin diamond rings looked dazzlingly fair
  by contrast.</p>

  <p>"I am exceedingly fortunate," the girl said. "What is the next thing to
  do?"</p>

  <p>"Very simple," the President said hoarsely. "Here is a piece of paper.
  To-morrow at a certain time you will be at the place denoted. At the stroke
  of noon a woman dressed as a nun will come out of the Church of All Angels.
  Follow her to her destination, but do not speak. She will enter a certain
  room in a certain tenement house, and you will enter the next room on the
  right. No questions will be asked, and everything will be ready for you. The
  room in question commands a full view of the Winterstrasse. The materials
  will reach you by post."</p>

  <p>"And then I am to kill the Grand Duke?" the girl asked. "Why?"</p>

  <p>A murmur of disapproval followed the question. The answer was so utterly
  obvious. The Grand Duke must be removed simply because he was the Grand
  Duke.</p>

  <p>"He never did me any harm," the girl protested.</p>

  <p>"Woman, you are a fool," the President said furiously. "You are one of us,
  or you would not have passed yonder door to-night. You have taken the oath,
  and you must abide by the consequence. If you refuse, well, you know what
  refusal means. If the man is a lover of yours&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are&mdash;you are a&mdash;a horror!" the girl cried. "The Grand Duke
  is a good man. He is kind and considerate to his people. I don't like his
  views&mdash;well, really, I won't go into that. The police shall know of
  this."</p>

  <p>The bombshell had fallen. A dozen men rose to their feet, yelling
  furiously. The other woman advanced on the girl and caught her rudely by the
  hair. It was obviously up to the young man to take a hand in the game. The
  spirit of tragedy was in the air. He leant on the table and softly blew out
  the lamp. He had focussed the whole scene in his mind first. It seemed to him
  that he knew exactly what to do. And, like the clever and audacious young man
  he was, he did it. In a vague kind of way the girl could hear the sound of
  the impact of flesh on flesh, could hear the groans and the curses of those
  who suffered in the cause as they went down before the furious onslaught of
  the young man. There was a faint shuddering suggestion of steel shimmering in
  the opalesque shadows, but the girl did not notice that, for she was too busy
  struggling with the lean, furious hands tangled in her hair. She was getting
  all the adventure she needed&mdash;and more.</p>

  <p>Came then a buzzing sensation in her ears and a curious relaxation of her
  limbs. The suggestion that she was on the verge of fainting would have filled
  her with indignation, but there it was. The grip on her hair suddenly
  relaxed; she was caught up in a pair of strong arms and swept off her feet.
  And there was something in that grip that filled her with a sense of absolute
  security.</p>

  <p>"Hold tight," a voice whispered in her ears. "Only let me have my right
  arm free. There's a little devil in the left-hand corner who has more fight
  in him than all the rest put together. Keep up your courage; we are nearly
  through."</p>

  <p>They were through presently, and staggering up the rickety ladder leading
  to the street. At the corner of the vile lane the young man paused and
  panted.</p>

  <p>"Well, that was a pretty close call, anyway," he said cheerfully. "Your
  mask has fallen off. Good thing it's so late and so few people about."</p>

  <p>"I've lost one of my rings as well," the girl said.</p>

  <p>"Well, that's better than losing your life," the young man responded. "If
  you will give me your address&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl hesitated just for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Why should I not?" she asked defiantly. "I am at 185 Gartenstrasse,
  Fraulein Anne Ketra. The elderly lady who is looking after me has had to go
  to Vienna on urgent business. I found myself in that den to-night looking for
  copy. I write, you know."</p>

  <p>"I have seen Anne Ketra's stories," the young man said grimly. "I also am
  a novelist. Let me see you home and in the morning I will call and inquire
  after you."</p>

  <p>The girl made no reply. She had her own good reasons why the young man
  should not call; and therefore there was no reason to inform him that she
  would assuredly leave Marenna to-morrow. She was sorry in a way to part with
  the young man, but then the reasons were so very urgent.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I shall never see him again," she said with a sigh.</p>

  <p>All the same, she was not destined to leave Marenna quite so soon as she
  had anticipated. Half an hour later came a polite inspector of police. He was
  full of regrets, but he had his orders. There were urgent state reasons why
  the lady should accompany him to the old Garden Palace, where a suite of
  rooms were being kept for the Fraulein's reception. A woman was downstairs
  and would help her to pack. No harm was intended the Fraulein&mdash;she would
  oblige him by replying to a few questions, and perhaps
  to-morrow&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"This," the girl cried, "is an outrage."</p>

  <p>The polite official sighed feelingly. He was desolate. All the same, it
  was quite clear that he was going to carry out his instructions. The girl bit
  her lips furiously. The polite official had never seen such beauty and anger
  in alliance before.</p>

  <p>"Send up your woman," the girl said. "Let her help me, and I will come
  with you."</p>

  <p>The polite official was eager to do anything in reason. He was obviously
  impressed by the beauty and style of his prisoner. Also he had an odd idea
  that he had seen her before. He knew that lovely, wilful face and those blue
  eyes&mdash;eyes flashing with anger now, and yet with a suggestion of mirth
  and mischief in them. She was afraid, yet not afraid; just as a swimmer might
  be when he knows nothing of the temperature of the water. She came back
  presently to the police official all ready cloaked and hooded as it ready for
  a journey.</p>

  <p>"You do not take ordinary prisoners to the Garden Palace?" she
  demanded.</p>

  <p>The polite official signified that the girl was correct. As a matter of
  fact, the Garden Palace was not a prison at all. The place had been built by
  a dead and gone Grand Duke of eccentric habits who was a great lover of
  solitude. The place was a fortress with a lovely old garden inside the
  walls&mdash;a garden so beautiful that it was renowned through Europe.</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt that I shall be comfortable there," the girl said
  demurely.</p>

  <p>She was not mistaken in this sanguine estimate. She woke at daybreak in a
  rosy mist of old satin; she gasped with delight at the prospect before her
  windows. To her this was an adventure wild and exciting, and yet daintily
  delicate. She was a prisoner, perhaps; but then the prison was a palace, and
  the whole escapade had a legal flavour about it. Here was a story all ready
  made. There was an element of trouble of course, but this only added savor to
  the situation. Enquiries would be made and something like a scandal would be
  inevitable; but even this fact had its charms. The crowning tableau would
  round off the story beautifully.</p>

  <p>Therefore the girl went down to breakfast in a pleased mood. She broke her
  fast daintily in a charming old room hung with the pictures of the dead and
  gone Grand Dukes who seemed to smile at her from the walls. She kissed the
  tips of her pink fingers to them as she passed out into the garden.</p>

  <p>And such a garden! It lay there shimmering in the summer sunshine. The air
  was heavy with the scent of flowers; the bees murmured drowsily. It seemed to
  the girl that she could be content to remain here always. The mere fact that
  she was behind grim stone walls only gave her a pleased sense of isolation
  from the world. She found a little romantic glen presently, and under a tree
  there she fell asleep. She made a sweet and dainty picture as she lay there
  with her hands clasped behind her golden hair, the sweetest and daintiest
  picture in the world.</p>

  <p>At any rate, the young man thought so. It was perhaps rude of him to sit
  down and watch the girl till the white lids lifted off the wonderfully tender
  blue of her eyes, and she smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"My preserver," she said. "What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Don't move," the young man said, eagerly. "You are&mdash;well, you really
  are, you know. Are you not surprised to meet me again?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit," the girl said. "It's an odd feeling, but I quite expected
  you. But what are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose I might say that I am here on business. At any rate I am
  attached to the Court. I am confidential adviser to the Grand Duke."</p>

  <p>"Really! At your age? How nice! Do you like him? Is he really awfully
  decent? I got that phrase from a delightful Eaton boy when I was staying in
  England. But isn't your man conceited? Does he not think that all the girls
  want to marry him?"</p>

  <p>"No, he doesn't," the young man said emphatically. "He never was what you
  call a ladies man. He only wants one girl, and she will not come near
  him."</p>

  <p>"I know. You are speaking of Princess Rene, of Barataria."</p>

  <p>"The same. The most wilful, lovely, and delightful of them all. But she
  won't look at him. I mean that literally. That's rather illogical of
  her&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>The girl sat up and regarded her companion with great gravity.</p>

  <p>"Have you met the Princess?" she asked. "At any rate, you have seen her
  photograph?"</p>

  <p>The young man made a gesture of contempt.</p>

  <p>"Photograph!" he exclaimed. "They really convey nothing. And as to myself,
  I am not much of a traveller. I dare say I shall meet the Princess some day.
  She may change her mind as to the Grand Duke. In her position she will have
  to marry somebody one of these days."</p>

  <p>"True," the girl said thoughtfully. "That's one of the drawbacks of being
  a princess. I've never seen your Grand Duke. Shall I have to do so now?"</p>

  <p>"Probably. He knows you're here. In fact he knows all about last night's
  little adventure. As a matter of fact, you were brought here to keep you out
  of further mischief."</p>

  <p>The girl pressed her lips into a whistle. Her thoughtful mood changed. She
  turned upon the young man with anger flashing in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I've got to thank you for this," she said.</p>

  <p>"I think you have," the young man said quietly. "Since you put it in that
  way, you've also got to thank me for your life. How did you get into that den
  last night?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, perhaps you are right," the girl said contritely. "I have a
  relative who possesses a certain influence with the police; and I'm rather
  sorry for those anarchists, you see. I've pretended to be one myself. And I
  learnt a good deal of their aims and ambitions. They never seem to realise
  that the police know all about them, poor dears. Really, I had no idea last
  night's business was so serious. And that is why I spoke so freely to them. I
  thought that if I scolded them a little they would be ashamed of their silly
  plans. And then I realised all at once that they were in earnest. It was a
  terrible shock to me. Do you know that I got my old governess out of the way
  so that I could attend that meeting. A friend of mine in&mdash;at
  home&mdash;obtained all the information about your anarchists for me. You
  see, I like to use my own eyes. I must have local color."</p>

  <p>"So distinguished a novelist as yourself would," the young man said
  grimly.</p>

  <p>"Of course. Then you came along and saved my life. They would have killed
  me had you not been there. It was brave of you, to take your life in your
  hands like that. But, tell me, my dear preserver, what were you doing
  there?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I frequently attend such meetings. You see, I am in a position to get
  all the information I need. I dress and rehearse for the part, so that I am
  quite safe. And I know&mdash;I mean I could see by a kind of instinct that
  you were not one of those people."</p>

  <p>"What a story it would make!" the girl exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it?" the young man cried, enthusiastically. "I am a bit of a
  scribbler, and I should like to have the telling of it. Let us make a romance
  of it. Say you are a Princess&mdash;if you like we'll call you the Crown
  Princess&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The Half-Crown Princess," the girl laughed. "My escapades are too cheap
  for the full title. But go on. See what you can make of the story. And I'll
  put the finishing touches in."</p>

  <p>"If you do that," the young man said meaningly, "I shall be the happiest
  chap in the world. Well, Half-Crown Princess, suppose you pose as Princess
  Rene, of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you say that again," the girl began, "I shall at
  once&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Princess Rene," the young man insisted politely, but firmly. "You came
  here to see our Prince, whom you have never met, despite the fact that he
  wishes to marry you. You wanted to have a look at him. And you wanted an
  adventure. And you got it. You came here in disguise, but you were found out
  and your movements were watched. And it turns out that you were not watched
  quite closely enough, and had I not come along you would have got into
  trouble. At my instigation you were conveyed here, and here you are at this
  moment. All you have to do now is to fall in love with the Grand Duke and
  marry him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, really! And that is what you call the finishing touches to the
  story?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I should. You are too fine an artist to deny that. It is the
  inevitable climax."</p>

  <p>"Not quite," the girl said. "For instance, what is to become of you? Now,
  if you had happened to be the Grand Duke&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My dearest Rene, I am," the young man said coolly.</p>

  <p>The girl sat up with her hands clasped over her knees. There was a flame
  of carmine in her cheeks. Her eyes were moist and dewy.</p>

  <p>"I ought to be furiously angry with you," she said.
  "But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But you are nothing of the kind. Dear, don't you see for yourself that
  this romance can only end one way? Don't you see that destiny is shaping the
  ends for us?"</p>

  <p>"How&mdash;how did you find out?"</p>

  <p>"I knew last night. I knew by those twin diamond rings. Here is the other
  one that you lost in the scuffle. I should like to keep this one."</p>

  <p>"You had better," the girl said. "I am trying to be angry, but
  still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But still you can't. Rene, you are not going to spoil a story like
  this?"</p>

  <p>A tear stole down the carmine cheek; the blue eyes were softly
  luminous.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," the girl whispered. "No, not yet dear&mdash;wait till
  I have finished. And, after all, as you said just now&mdash;I've got to get
  married some day, and as you seem to be&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And it was here, where the hiatus came, that he kissed her.</p>

     name="ch2">II. &mdash; THE ROYAL TRAIN</a></h2>

  <h3>Published under syndication in, e.g.,<br>
  <i>The World's News</i>, Sydney, Australia, December 19, 1914</h3>

  <p class="first">"THE matter is quite simple," the head of the department
  said, "that is, of course, so far as the facts are concerned. Princess
  Stephanie of Austiria has quite lately celebrated her twenty-first birthday.
  There have been great rejoicings in Marena, the capital of Austiria, and the
  King has been doing the thing, what shall I call it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Top hole," the Baroness Cora Levinski laughed. "You may not care for the
  phrase in high diplomacy, but it is on the tip of your tongue."</p>

  <p>Sir Anthony Barrington smiled. He was very young for the position, and
  there were those who hinted at boudoir politics and the ridiculous assumption
  that because a man has figured in a test match he might, therefore, make an
  ideal Head of the Secret Service Department.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, no harassed and badgered Prime Minister ever made a
  better appointment. There was not a single political spy in Europe who was
  not aware of it.</p>

  <p>"Princess Stephanie is our especial care just now," Barrington went on.
  "She is of far greater importance than she imagines. Of course I can't say
  whether she is ambitious or not, or whether she is merely a girl
  who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She is divine," the baroness exclaimed. "The most beautiful and
  accomplished princess in Europe to-day. She has character and individuality.
  If she makes up her mind to a thing, that thing is going to be done. My dear
  Anthony, I have known her ever since she was a child. I know the Court at
  Marena inside out. Stephanie is no royal puppet, she will not marry the first
  prince that your people push across the chessboard towards her."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Barrington smiled. "Because of these facts we are desirous of
  availing ourselves of your valuable services. Because we have every reason to
  believe that the princess is married already."</p>

  <p>"I am not easily startled, Sir Anthony. But is this really so?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that is our impression. And we had it from a source which has
  hitherto been absolutely reliable. The marriage took place near Paris eight
  months ago. At that time the princess was staying incognito in charge of an
  old governess. The bridegroom is Prince Arturo of Braxony. Now, mind you, I
  am all the more inclined to believe this because we cannot find the faintest
  piece of evidence of it."</p>

  <p>"Sounds rather subtle," the baroness murmured.</p>

  <p>"Not at all. Our man's proofs were curt and to the point. We made no very
  careful enquiries at the time because the marriage was exactly what we
  wanted. In a few weeks, the cowardly, dissipated King of Braxony will be
  pushed off the throne, and it is arranged that Prince Arturo will take his
  place. A marriage between the prince and Princess Stephanie&mdash;some time
  to be queen of Austiria&mdash;would consolidate two powerful States and give
  us the buffer we need so as to protect our interests in Persia. Now that is
  not the game of the King of Austiria at all. He has made up his mind that
  Princess Stephanie shall wed her cousin, Prince Karl, and Russia has given
  him her blessing."</p>

  <p>"But if the princess is already married to your man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did I not say that no proofs exist? The cure who was supposed to have
  performed the ceremony was transferred to Austiria. A promotion, of course.
  But he has been promoted so high that he has disappeared in the clouds. Two
  peasants who witnessed the marriage have migrated, goodness knows where. Then
  there was a fire in the chapel and all records burnt. Now all that is very
  suspicious. It is quite evident that old Carlos of Austiria has done his work
  thoroughly. All proofs have vanished, there has been no fuss and bother, and
  the princess is safely back home again."</p>

  <p>"My dear Sir Anthony, you speak as if she were a prisoner."</p>

  <p>"And so she is," said Harrington drily. "She appears in public, she goes
  to all kinds of functions, she is cheered as she rides in public, there is a
  smile upon her lips. But she is a prisoner all the same. And so is Prince
  Arturo. He is supposed to be in Marena for the rejoicings. But he is not
  allowed to move a yard without being followed. His correspondence is tampered
  with, his frank letters to his friends are fakes and forgeries. I know the
  situation sounds impossible, but there it is. Unless something is done, it
  may go on indefinitely. One or other of these young people&mdash;or both
  preferably&mdash;must escape."</p>

  <p>"And you are looking to me to bring it about, Sir Anthony."</p>

  <p>"My dear baroness, you are absolutely essential. There is nobody I know
  whose services I would prefer. You have brought off some brilliant coups for
  us, and we have not been ungrateful&mdash;or mean. You know the Court of
  Marena, you will be received there with open arms. Nobody will suspect you,
  least of all the king, who flatters himself that we are in the deepest
  ignorance with regard to the romance. Who would suspect that you are in the
  pay of our Government? And you can name your own price. Whatever you need is
  yours."</p>

  <p>The dark eyes of the baroness sparkled.</p>

  <p>"I should just love it," she whispered. "Besides, I am fond of the
  princess. But it is going to be an expensive play to stage. I may need a
  regiment of soldiers."</p>

  <p>"Oh, have an army corps if necessary," Barrington said eagerly. "We will
  open an account in your name through some big foreign house, and the
  Nationale Bank at Barena will be advised to honor your draft to any extent.
  Now, when can you go?"</p>

  <p>"I can and will start to-morrow," Baroness Levinski said promptly, "I
  shall have to spend a day or two in Paris en route. But it is going to take
  time. I must not be hurried in the matter."</p>

  <p>Barrington was prepared to give every assurance. The baroness would not be
  interfered with, the service would give her an entirely free hand. Whereupon
  Cora Levinski departed smilingly, and Barrington strolled down to Lord's to
  see how Middlesex were getting on against Kent.</p>

  <p>By the end of the week the baroness found herself comfortably settled in
  Marena. She wrote a good many letters and despatched a good many parcels, but
  none of these went by post. The baroness had been too long engaged in the
  secret service for that. She had her subordinates everywhere, she kept very
  much to herself, and it was only a question of time before an invitation to
  the palace came, and it was more prudent to wait for that.</p>

  <p>The whole city was given over to a state of gaiety; concerts, dances, gala
  performances at the opera, everywhere the public rejoicings were going on.
  And amongst it all, the admired of all admirers, the Princess Stephanie
  floated, light and happy as a butterfly, and a charming smile ever on her
  lips. Prince Arturo was a prominent figure also, but his smile was
  restrained, there were moments when he looked out on to the giddy, noisy
  world with moody eye and compressed lips. The chains were not visible to the
  casual eye, but Cora Levinski could see them. And the way to file those
  fetters was slowly forming in her mind.</p>

  <p>She plunged lightly and deftly into the hive of pleasure; a few days later
  she was meeting the princess everywhere. They were very old friends, these
  two, and the greetings were cordial on both sides.</p>

  <p>"Are you not getting just a little bit tired of it, princess?" Cora
  asked.</p>

  <p>The red lips trembled, the blue eyes were moist.</p>

  <p>"Sick and weary to my soul," the princess whispered. "Cora, all this is
  killing me. If you knew, if you only knew what I am suffering,
  what&mdash;-"</p>

  <p>"My dear child, it is because I know that I am here. I have come from
  London to help you&mdash;I have all the resources of a great nation behind
  me. It is all a matter of patience and courage."</p>

  <p>The dainty face flushed, a sweet confusion filled the moist blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"It has been found out," she whispered. "The story is public
  property."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind. Your secret is absolutely safe, dear heart. You
  appear to do as you like here so long as you make no attempt to leave the
  capital. Can you manage to come and have tea with me at my hotel
  to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>The princess came eagerly enough. As she dropped into a chair, the smile
  faded from her face, the beautiful features grew white as ivory. Then she
  dropped her head on the baroness's knee and burst into a torrent of
  tears.</p>

  <p>"Don't be anxious," she said, "I shall be better presently. If you only
  knew the blessed relief of having somebody to confide in. Cora I am the most
  wretched girl in Marena. I am forced to smile and smile whilst my heart is
  breaking. Can't they realise that a princess is but flesh and blood after
  all? Can't they see that I am a girl with love and passion like the rest of
  them?"</p>

  <p>"Tell me all about it, dear," the baroness said tenderly.</p>

  <p>"Cora, there is little to tell. I have always loved Arturo. And I have
  always hated my cousin of Russia. All the more, perhaps, because I know that
  I am destined to be his wife . . . . It was more or less by accident that I
  met Arturo in Paris. And Madam Brandt gave us all our opportunity. She is fat
  and lazy, and loves good living ... And so we were married. My father
  pretends that it is not so, he says it is but a dream. But I know that they
  destroyed all the evidence, and got the witnesses away. Heaven knows how they
  found out. And my father came to Paris with a smile on his lips and he asked
  Arturo to accompany me here for my birthday festivities. Once we were in the
  palace the bomb exploded. We were told we were both prisoners. I am never to
  leave the city again, and Arturo must stay till he has signed some paper
  saying that I am not married to him, and that my claim to be his wife is no
  more than a delusion on my part. The audacity of it, Cora. If Europe knew
  then the Powers must intervene. But you know how hard and stern and merciless
  my father can be. What am I to do?"</p>

  <p>"Escape from Marena and proclaim the marriage," the baroness suggested.
  "Any line of conduct would be justified in the circumstances."</p>

  <p>"But I cannot," the princess cried. "I cannot. Once beyond the frontier
  and the whole world should hear of my wrongs."</p>

  <p>"And you are prepared to place yourself entirely in my hands?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Cora, I will do so gladly. Once beyond the frontier&mdash;but
  what is the use of speaking of that? I tell you I am a prisoner here. True my
  cage is roomy and the bars are made of gold, but it is a prison all the same.
  I am watched day and night. And so is Arturo, only his case is worse than
  mine. Think of the audacity of it. And things are going badly in Braxony, and
  Arturo's presence is sorely needed there."</p>

  <p>The baroness nodded. All this she knew full well. But it was no business
  of hers to disclose what Barrington had said as to the fate in store for
  Arturo.</p>

  <p>"But it can be done," she said. "Now listen. I came here on purpose to
  help you. We will pretend that we don't know which of the great Powers is
  behind us. But I am your friend, and the Power in question is your friend,
  and Arturo's, and money is no object, whatever. I have thought the matter out
  thoroughly. I have my subordinates here and they are ready to do anything I
  tell them. My scheme is audacious to a degree&mdash;it requires courage and
  patience. Will you put yourself entirely in my hands and do as I tell you?
  No, I am not going to tell you what my scheme is or the precise moment when
  it will be put into execution. All you have to do is to watch and take your
  cue from me. Once past the frontier and you are free. Think what it means. It
  means liberty and life and love."</p>

  <p>"Anything," the princess cried passionately, "anything rather than a life
  like this. You shall not blame my courage when the time comes."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">MARENA was getting just a little satiated with pleasure.
  Marena began to note with concern that the beloved princess was growing thin
  and pale. Her very amusements were becoming a trial to her. And Marena would
  be glad to get back to work. There was only one other great social function,
  and Marena would not participate in that. Only some five hundred guests had
  been invited to the Baroness Levinski's al fresco lunch and dinner in the
  ruins of Alozo. There would be bridge after luncheon for those who liked it,
  and for the rest archery and such Arcadian joys. The whole party would be
  attired in mediaeval dress. The King and Princess Stephanie and the Court
  generally would be there, indeed His Majesty had been graciously pleased to
  place the royal train at the baroness's service. Half a dozen saloon
  carriages would be sufficient for the party&mdash;a brilliant gathering on
  the most luxurious train in the world. There were vestibule carriages, and it
  was possible to promenade the train from end to end.</p>

  <p>Cora Levinski was dressed and ready for the fray. It still wanted an hour
  before she was due at the station, and there was much to be done. She stood
  in her mediaeval dress before the window of her drawing-room idly watching
  the crowd on the Linderstrasse below. She looked a little tired and languid,
  as if quite weary of it all, a creature who had utterly used up her emotions.
  There was no suggestion of the fire that raged so fiercely under the ice.
  Down below a green motor with drawn blinds threaded its way through the
  traffic. The muffled and goggled chauffeur just touched his cap as if by
  accident. Then at intervals of a minute or two other green motors passed, and
  each driver made exactly the same sign at the same spot.</p>

  <p>"That makes ten," the baroness murmured as she turned from the window.
  "Fritz is doing his work well, it is time we were moving."</p>

  <p>A glittering mob thronged the railed-off portion of the big station. They
  seemed strangely out of place in that busy terminus. The baroness was greeted
  with laughter and applause as she appeared. She had thrown aside her languor
  now, she was the brilliant, fascinating, charming host, she marshalled her
  guests with infinite tact and discrimination. The great scarlet and gold
  train formed a quaint background to the picturesque costumes of the middle
  ages, it was progress and pastoral comedy side by side. They were waiting
  only now for the arrival of the Royal party; they came presently in
  semi-regal state and guards of honor on either side saluted. The baroness
  could see the commanding figure of the King as he strode across the crimson
  carpet. His great red beard hid the decorations on his chest.</p>

  <p>The baroness bowed low so that the King should not see the mocking
  mischief in her eyes. Behind him came the Princess Stephanie and Prince
  Arturo. They had been the King's only companions in the state coach. He had a
  fine sense of the irony of the situation. He was the type of humorist who
  prefers to keep his humor for his own consumption. He would have felt less
  grimly amused, perhaps, could he have seen what was passing in the mind of
  the baroness.</p>

  <p>She marked Stephanie's drooping lips and pathetic blue eyes, she marked
  the troubled gloom of Arturo's brow. The train was filling up now and there
  was no time for speculation. Just eighty miles that scarlet and gold train
  was going to travel without a stop, and an hour and twenty minutes was the
  schedule time. By midday the famous old ruins would be reached. What surprise
  awaited the brilliant company on their arrival had yet to be declared. The
  Baroness was a past mistress in the disclosure of unexpected pleasures. And
  Princess Stephanie's pale face flushed as the journey proceeded.</p>

  <p>"I am going to try and enjoy myself," she said to the baroness. "I am
  going to try and forget for one day at least."</p>

  <p>"You will never forget this day as long as you live, princess."</p>

  <p>"My dear Cora, what do you mean by that?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you. Talk to me as much as you like. If I do not answer
  you, no matter. My mind will probably be far away."</p>

  <p>She shaded her eyes with her hand and gazed idly out of the window. But
  all the same her glance was keen and shrewd. She seemed to be going over some
  plan in her mind. Her eyes grew more eager and brilliant as the train shot
  through each station. There were small roadside stations that interested her
  but faintly, the larger ones held a firmer fascination. Just before the train
  drew near each signal box a chauffeur lounged as if waiting for his employer.
  As the train passed he just touched his cap. The baroness slipped one of the
  plate-glass windows up and looked out languidly.</p>

  <p>There stood the telephone and telegraph posts, but of wires there was no
  sign to be seen. The train roared through a large station presently, a
  station with crowded platforms, where gold-laced officials seemed to be
  besieged by angry passengers. Some of them yelled and threw up their hands as
  the train flashed by.</p>

  <p>"What is the trouble all about?" the King asked indifferently.</p>

  <p>"It looked to me more like loyalty, your Majesty," the baroness answered.
  "The people have evidently gathered to see you go through."</p>

  <p>The King smiled as if satisfied with the explanation. The miles were
  reeled off one by one, the telegraph and telephone posts staggered by, and
  yet nobody seemed to heed the fact that the wires had vanished. And here at
  long intervals lounged chauffeurs, idle and indifferent, who touched their
  caps as the great gold and scarlet dragon flashed along.</p>

  <p>"Behold the classic ruins," one of the guests observed. "In ten minutes we
  shall be there. Baroness, when will the first surprise accost me?"</p>

  <p>"One never can tell, prince," the baroness smiled. "It may come at
  any&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>From the back of the train came the sound of a shot. There can be no
  mistaking the sharp, whip-like crack of a revolver. Then came another and
  another, a shrill scream from the lips of a woman. The sound of tumult and
  strife came along the train like a wave, it spread from carriage to carriage
  in a flash.</p>

  <p>A young man, pale and bleeding, staggered into the Royal saloon.</p>

  <p>"I care little for your comedy, madame," the King said coldly.</p>

  <p>"It is none of my making, sire," the baroness replied. She was pale and
  troubled, her eyes were dark with terror. "What has happened I know no more
  than your Majesty. If some of these gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The men started to their feet. Only Princess Stephanie was unmoved. Here
  was a hideous plot of some kind directed against the sacred person of the
  King. Or were those rascally brigands from the hills at work again?</p>

  <p>"Are we going to take this like children," the King cried. "Is there
  nobody here who is man enough&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is too late, sir," Prince Arturo said coldly. "The weight of power is
  against us. Look and see for yourself, your Majesty."</p>

  <p>At either end of the saloon a trio of masked figures appeared. Each man
  carried a rifle with bayonet fixed. From the end next the engine a voice
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"There is no great occasion for alarm," the voice said. "But we warn you
  that resistance would be madness. The train is in our possession, and what
  our plans are you will know all in good time. And if there is any bloodshed,
  please understand that it is none of our seeking."</p>

  <p>"If this is a plot against my throne," the King cried,
  "then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We have no concern with your Majesty at all," the voice interrupted. "The
  contents of your pocket are far more interesting to us than your
  crown&mdash;mainly because you don't happen to be wearing it. Our policy is
  far more sordid than you imagine. We are financiers, not politicians."</p>

  <p>"In other words, you are a set of cowardly brigands."</p>

  <p>"If your Majesty likes to put it that way. We belong to no country and
  boast no patriotism. We are out for the spoil. In the guise of guests we
  mingled with the throng, at a given signal we slipped off our disguises. That
  was the easiest part of the plot. To obtain possession of the signal boxes
  and telegraph offices was quite another matter. But we have got the train
  signalled through to Varsar, and that is where we are going to stop. There is
  not one single telephone or telegraph man between here and Marena. We have
  seen to all that."</p>

  <p>Princess Stephanie glanced at the baroness, but there was no expression
  save that of fear and terror on the latter's face. Certain hopes beat high in
  the heart of the princess, but she could read nothing even though the book
  lay open before her.</p>

  <p>"You shall answer for this with your lives," the King cried.</p>

  <p>"Very likely, sire," the voice said coolly. "That is all on the lap of the
  gods. You will excuse me if I go now and give my directions to the
  engine-driver. As yet he is in blissful ignorance of what has happened."</p>

  <p>The glass sliding doors at each end of the saloon were banged to, the
  three grim sentinels stood outside patiently. There was no help for it, no
  possible escape from the difficulty. They were caught like rats in a trap,
  and the trap had been most cunningly contrived and baited. Evidently the gang
  of desperadoes had worked out the scheme to the last decimal. It had been a
  costly process no doubt, but the reward was likely to be a valuable one. The
  men of the party groaned and swore, the women huddled together tearfully.
  From the van there came the muffled sound of a shot or two, the speed of the
  train slackened perceptibly until it came almost to a standstill. A whistle
  screamed long and shrill, then the crimson and gold snake began to creep on
  once more.</p>

  <p>Again the Princess Stephanie turned to the baroness.</p>

  <p>"Varsar is on the frontier," she whispered. "My dearest Cora, if&mdash;if
  we could only reach that our troubles are over. Oh, these men can have
  anything of value that belongs to me if they leave me my greatest
  possession&mdash;Arturo."</p>

  <p>"You must wait and see," the baroness replied, "it may be that these
  ruffians are a blessing in disguise. I will help you if I can."</p>

  <p>The train pulled up presently on an open plain far away from town or
  habitation. The luxurious saloon had been turned into a deserted siding
  hidden from the main line by a belt of trees. The sliding-doors of the saloon
  were pushed back, and the whole party unceremoniously commanded to alight. A
  white-faced guard and an equally pallid engine-driver looked out with armed
  men behind them. A big man in a mask seemed to be in command.</p>

  <p>"Keep the train there," he said, "till your passengers are ready to
  return. Now, your Majesty, ladies and gentlemen, follow me this way."</p>

  <p>Again there was no help for it. Angry, sullen men and frightened, pallid
  women surged forward like a mob in a state of panic. The baroness lingered
  behind with Princess Stephanie by her side. She smiled as she saw that Prince
  Arturo was close at hand. All her simulated terror had vanished.</p>

  <p>"Now is your time," she whispered. "Now is your time when you are both
  together. Do you see what that object is over there behind those oleanders!
  Can't you see that it is a car?"</p>

  <p>"And waiting for us, Cora," the princess cried. "Oh, my dearest friend, my
  sweet preserver! And you have done all this for us."</p>

  <p>"Hush, hush, or somebody will hear you. For myself, I say nothing. And you
  have no right to point to the evidence that I am at the bottom of the outrage
  on the sacred person of the King. As if I should dare to take such a liberty!
  No, no, you must not associate me with brigands and desperadoes. And perhaps
  the owner of the car is there by accident and will refuse to help you,
  till&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The princess snatched at the hand of the baroness and kissed it fervently.
  Arturo caught her round the waist, and hurried her away. There was a
  breathless moment or two, and then from the distance came the purring of the
  car as she gathered speed. It came down the road between the discomfited
  revellers, Stephanie and Arturo on their feet, their faces wreathed with
  happy smiles. It was only for a moment before the mocking triumphant faces
  had vanished from sight.</p>

  <p>"My daughter!" the King cried. "My child! And Arturo! Get them back, bring
  them to me, and I forgive everything. A thousand crowns reward, a
  million."</p>

  <p>"Too late," the man behind the mask thundered. "In a few moments, sire,
  your daughter and her husband will be beyond the frontier. To-morrow all
  Europe will be ringing with her story. The whole world will know how your
  daughter and her husband have been detained as prisoners here. They will be
  informed of the most audacious thing that ever happened in history. And
  before long they will be securely seated on the throne of Braxony."</p>

  <p>"This&mdash;this was planned," the King stammered.</p>

  <p>"It was planned sire, yes. We are the prince's countrymen and future
  subjects, and we got to know. It was a difficult task we had before us, but
  when we heard of her baroness' party we began to see our way. Nothing
  succeeds like audacity. And that is the whole of the story. In a few moments
  we shall also cross the frontier where you will be powerless to touch us. And
  now you can go back to your train, and explain to your engine-driver. By this
  time Marena knows what has happened, and steps are being taken to restore the
  dislocated traffic. Sire, we beg to take leave of you with profound
  apologies."</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but for the Royal party to struggle back as best
  they could. And fear had given place to an all-devouring curiosity. Even
  kings must bow the knee to popular opinion at times, and he of Austiria
  condescended to explain, indeed scandal and disgrace would have followed on
  silence. The story travelled from lip to lip as the train steamed back slowly
  to the capital. It was only when the outskirts of the town were reached that
  his Majesty approached the baroness.</p>

  <p>"You were always fond of my daughter," he suggested.</p>

  <p>"I would do anything to help her, your Majesty," she said.</p>

  <p>"And also, I have a pretty shrewd idea that you have done so."</p>

  <p>"Your Majesty! Do you dare to assume that I have had any
  hand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut. Don't be so impatient. I was about to say&mdash;but I have no
  proofs. I doubt if ever I shall have any proofs. And, upon my soul, I begin
  to believe that things are turning out for the best after all."</p>

     name="ch3">III. &mdash; THE MISSING BLADE</a></h2>

  <h3>Published under syndication in. e.g.,<br>
  <i>The Wyalong Advocate and Mining, Agricultural and Pastoral
  Gazette</i>,<br>
  Wyalong, Australia, December 13, 1913</h3>

  <p class="first">IT is not, as a rule, an asset in favour of promotion for an
  obscure country policeman to succeed where the shining lights of Scotland
  Yard have failed. But this is precisely what happened in connection with the
  death of Mr. James Mirriton, of The Orchard House, Westborough. From the very
  first the Chief Constable had made up his mind that it was a case of suicide,
  and the people in London saw no reason to quarrel with this view. As a matter
  of fact, it was Constable George Cowtan who first viewed the body. He had
  been summoned hastily to the Orchard House by a frightened housekeeper, who
  aroused him with the information that her master was locked in the bathroom,
  and that she could get no reply. On Cowtan entering the house and breaking
  open the bathroom door, he found the unfortunate Mr. Mirriton lying dead on
  the floor in a pool of blood, which apparently flowed from a severed carotid
  artery, the wound had evidently been inflicted while the deceased was in the
  act of shaving, for his chin was covered with lather and a blood-stained
  razor lay upon the floor. Seeing that the bathroom door had been locked from
  the inside, there was only one conclusion to which to come. Further
  investigation confirmed the authorities in their view, Mr. Mirriton committed
  suicide, and there was an end of the matter so far as the Yard was
  concerned.</p>

  <p>But it so happened that Constable George Cowtan possessed a clear grey
  eye, and something remarkable in the way of a chin. He had entered the police
  force with the deliberate intention of becoming a detective. He preferred the
  life in question to the dull routine of a village general shop, and he had
  read a vast deal of literature on the subject of crime. There were very few
  authorities that he had not at his finger-tips. Thus it came about that he
  took the liberty of calling on his district superintendent and asking for an
  opportunity for going further into the matter.</p>

  <p>"You've got your work to do," the superintendent said.</p>

  <p>"Then put me on night duty," Cowtan urged. "If you do that I shall have a
  few hours a day to myself. I honestly believe, sir, that I can clear this
  mystery up."</p>

  <p>The superintendent nodded sympathetically. If there was any mystery here,
  and Cowtan could clear it up, then the reflected glory would be his.</p>

  <p>"Very well, Cowtan," he said. "But what makes you think that there has
  been foul play here?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," Cowtan said, modestly, "I've read a goodish bit of
  criminology. I know my Galton and Collins by heart. And I've got all the
  French text-books at home. When I came to think over that business of Mr.
  Mirriton's, it struck me that I'd read something like it before. And so I
  had, sir. Of course, some of the details are different, but the main outlines
  are the same. Now, why should Mr. Mirriton commit suicide? He was a vigorous
  old gentleman, a good sportsman, and he was getting a handsome income from
  his business in London. He was in the habit of going to town twice a week by
  the 8.30 train from here. In winter-time like this, when he was going to town
  he invariably got his own breakfast, which he cooked by means of a spirit
  stove, as he did not like to get his housekeeper up so early. On the morning
  of his death he was going to London as usual, and nobody was up at the time,
  when he ought to have left the house. Besides the housekeeper, Mr. Mirriton
  had his niece, Mrs. Glynn, staying with him. This is the young married lady
  with a husband who is rather delicate, and Mrs. Glynn came down here to
  borrow sufficient money for a tour on the Continent. This I got from the
  housekeeper. I also discovered that Mr. Mirriton derived most of his income
  from his business. At his death the business devolves upon a distant relative
  of his, a Mr. Patrick Hayes. Mr. Hayes is a bachelor, and spends a good deal
  of time down here. He is the little lean man who gave evidence at the
  inquest. He has been in the habit of spending two or three nights a week at
  The Orchard House&mdash;in fact, was more or less one of the family. He
  should have been here at the time of the tragedy, but he missed his train at
  Westborough Town, and telephoned that he could not get back that night.</p>

  <p>"I hope I'm not wasting your time, sir, but these details are important.
  You see, sir, Mr. Mirriton was very fond of his niece, and being a somewhat
  extravagant man, spent his income. As he would have no share in the business
  to leave, he insured his life many years ago for twenty thousand pounds in
  favour of Mrs. Glynn. It was one of the old-fashioned policies, and, on the
  ground that he committed suicide, the insurance company naturally declines to
  pay."</p>

  <p>"This is very interesting, Cowtan," the superintendent muttered.</p>

  <p>"Indeed it is sir," Cowtan said, eagerly. "And it should have come out at
  the inquest. Mr. Mirriton was devoted to his niece and her child, and I am
  sure he would have never committed an act that would have deprived her of all
  that money. You may depend upon it, sir, that Mr. Mirriton was murdered."</p>

  <p>"Have you got anything else?" the superintendent asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I have," Cowtan said, quietly. "If you will only give me an
  opportunity&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>So Cowtan went on his way with the assurance that he had a superior
  officer behind him. An hour or two later and he was seated in the dining-room
  of The Orchard House, discussing the matter with Mrs. Glynn. She was dressed
  in deep mourning, her pretty face was white and careworn.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you all I know," she said, eagerly. "This has been a terrible
  shock to me. I cannot believe that my uncle took his own life. Apart from the
  loss of the money, I would give anything to remove this stain from my uncle's
  character. And goodness knows we need the money badly enough. It is
  absolutely essential that my husband should spend the winter in France. And
  now we cannot go. Please do not think me unduly selfish."</p>

  <p>"I think I can alter things, madam," Cowtan said modestly. "If I can prove
  my theory then you will get your money. Would you mind answering a few
  questions? On the night before the tragedy who slept in the house?"</p>

  <p>"The housekeeper and myself," Mrs. Glynn explained. "Mr Hayes ought to
  have been down here, only he missed the connection."</p>

  <p>"And came on in the morning, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"No, I think he went back to town. He telephoned rather late in the
  evening from Westborough Town, explaining the reason why he could not get
  here. I took the message myself."</p>

  <p>"You did? Trunk call, of course?" Cowtan asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. Westborough must be at least ten miles. I remember the exchange
  telling me that we were on the trunk. But, really, I quite fail to
  see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Cowtan did not argue the point. He jotted down a few heads in his note
  book, and went away with an intimation that he would call later in the
  evening with a view to seeing Mr. Hayes, who was expected by the last train.
  The young detective was feeling fairly pleased with himself as he mounted his
  bicycle and made his way in the direction of Westborough Town. He had his
  official permit in his pocket, and there was no difficulty therefore in
  obtaining an interview with the superintendent of the local telephone
  exchange. Half an hour later, Cowtan came out of the office carrying a
  compact leather case in his hand. He rode back to Westborough and pulled up
  at the roadside where the telephone lines branched across the fields in the
  direction of The Orchard House. Apparently Mr. Mirriton's telephone had been
  an expensive luxury, for the wire from the main road to the house extended
  quite 800 yards. Cowtan took from his pocket a small but powerful pair of
  binoculars, and, walking along under the wires, examined them carefully inch
  by inch. By the third post, which was almost hidden in a clump of firs, he
  paused and scrutinised the copper threads minutely. A tiny pin point gleamed
  in the setting sun, and Cowtan closed his glasses with a triumphant snap.</p>

  <p>It was a little after nine when the young detective called upon Mr.
  Patrick Hayes. These two had met before during the inquest, so that Cowtan
  had little to learn as to the outward and visible appearance of the man whom
  he had come to see. Hayes was small and slight, his left leg dragged
  painfully, and his hands shook in a manner that suggested some natural
  infirmity. His eye was clear enough, there was no trace of dissipation on his
  features, so that it was difficult to assign a reason for that palsied tremor
  in the long, slim fingers. In his own quiet way, Cowtan made a mental
  photograph of these characteristics for future reference. There was one
  little thing he noticed, and this pleased him more than all the rest. He had
  a tiny scrap of paper in his pocket-book which he intended to produce with
  deadly effect a little later on. He was wondering how Hayes with that
  terribly shaky hand, managed to shave himself so effectually. He did not fail
  to see that Hayes's cheek and chin was as soft and velvety as that of a
  little child. He looked as if he possessed a strong beard, too, if his coarse
  black hair and moustache counted for anything.</p>

  <p>"I would like to ask you a question, sir, if you don't mind," Cowtan said.
  "You see, the insurance company are disposed to do something if we can only
  show a reasonable doubt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It seemed to the speaker that Hayes's manner became somewhat less
  guarded.</p>

  <p>"I'll do all I can," he said. "Of course, between ourselves, the jury's
  verdict was a correct one."</p>

  <p>"My chief is certain of it, sir," Cowtan said. "It's a great pity you
  weren't here the other night, sir."</p>

  <p>"A thousand pities," Hayes agreed, heartily. "But I missed the connection
  at the junction, so that I had to put up at Westborough Town for the
  night."</p>

  <p>"Not a pleasant place to stay in, sir," Cowtan said, genially.</p>

  <p>"Oh I found the Railway Hotel passable enough," Hayes replied. "No
  bathroom or anything of that kind, of course&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And no shaving water," Cowtan smiled respectfully. "But when a man hasn't
  got his razors, it doesn't much matter."</p>

  <p>Hayes responded pleasantly enough that his natural infirmity prevented him
  from shaving himself. Cowtan asked a few more questions of a trivial nature,
  and then rose to go.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry to trouble you, sir," he said. "But before I leave I should
  like just to have a minute or two in the bathroom, if I may. And if you
  happen to be down here again this week&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Couldn't possibly manage it," Hayes interrupted. "I have neglected the
  business this last week or so. Now go and amuse yourself&mdash;I mean, go up
  in the bathroom and have a look round if you like."</p>

  <p>He gave a gesture of dismissal, and Cowtan respectfully saluted and left
  the room. The bathroom was a small slip of a place over the kitchen, and had
  been obviously adapted for the purpose. The window was a casement one of the
  old-fashioned type, with an iron upright against which the two sashes closed.
  There was a looking-glass here, a shaving-table, and a fire-place, from all
  of which it was evident that the unfortunate Mirriton had used the place as a
  dressing-room. The windows were open now; indeed, it was only fair to assume
  that Mr. Hayes invariably preferred them that way, seeing that he was a
  strong advocate for fresh air, and had often boasted that never had he slept
  or breathed in any room with the window closed. Cowtan stood pondering here
  for a few minutes until an object caught his attention, and he took it
  eagerly in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Two of them," he muttered. "Now, I wonder if I dare take this, or shall I
  leave it behind? Perhaps I had better leave it, seeing that I have evidence
  enough already. Yes, I think I'll risk leaving it."</p>

  <p>Once at home in the seclusion of his own room, Cowtan began to fit his
  facts together. He went over all the ground carefully and thoughtfully, then
  he produced from his pocket book a scrap of paper which apparently had formed
  a portion of an envelope. It must have been an exceedingly small envelope,
  scarcely more than an inch and a quarter by three quarters. It was made of
  some thin tough paper, which apparently had been smeared with grease or
  vaseline on the inside. On this fragment, in faint brown letters, a portion
  of an address was printed. Cowtan made it out thus:</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">"... plane Co., Ltd., ...pector, 0125."</p><br>

  <p>"So far so good," Cowtan muttered. "It's only a tiny clue, of course, but
  unless I'm greatly mistaken, it's going to hang a man before I've finished.
  The great weakness of the clever criminal very often is that he is too
  clever. When a man's tracks are practically blind, there is no occasion to
  make them appear blinder still. And that's where my man has been so foolish.
  Now, I'll just send this to London, and see what they say about it. And if my
  suspicions are correct, I shall have no trouble in getting a search warrant
  both here and in London."</p>

  <p>Cowtan sat down and concocted a somewhat cautious letter, the address of
  which sounded prosaic enough, but at the same time, perhaps, destined to
  produce a reply which would go far to solve the mystery of The Orchard House.
  As a matter of fact, the letter was addressed as follows:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">The Monoplane Safety Razor Co. Ltd.,<br>
  1125a, Oxford-street.</p>

  <p class="letter">"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I am desired
  by a Superintendent Gregory of Westborough, to call your attention to the
  enclosed envelope, which has obviously contained a blade for use in
  connection with one of your safety razors. You will notice that though the
  fragment is torn it still contains the number of your inspector who passed
  the parcel from which the blade came, and certified them for use. I
  understand that your system enables you to trace the retailer or private
  individual to whom all blades are sold. I quite appreciate the difficulty
  there will be in the case of a sale over the counter, but I understand these
  blades are frequently faulty, and that if customers write to you direct you
  are always willing to supply fresh blades. It may happen that you are in a
  position to inform us the name of the person to whom the blade originally
  wrapped in the enclosed envelope was sent.</p>

  <p class="letter">If you can accommodate us in this respect you will be
  rendering the police a distinct service. If you will communicate with me by
  telephone to the Police-station, Westborough, I shall be obliged.&mdash;Yours
  respectfully,</p>

  <p class="letter"><span class="smcap">George Cowtan</span>, Constable.</p>

  <p><br>
  It was fine and sunny in the morning as Cowtan made his way in the direction
  of The Orchard House. He did not call this time, but made his way round to
  the garden on to which the bathroom looked. For the next two hours he
  searched with marvellous patience amongst the mass of shrubs and vegetables,
  within a radius of twenty yards from the house. His search was rewarded at
  length, for he seemed to be perfectly satisfied with an oblong scrap of rusty
  iron, which he put away as carefully as if it were made of gold. As he came
  round to the front of the house again he encountered Mrs. Glynn.</p>

  <p>She came eagerly forward with questioning eyes. "Have you done anything?"
  she asked.</p>

  <p>"I think I've done a good deal, madam," Cowtan said, quietly. "Within a
  few days you will have no further anxiety on the subject of your future. And
  you can help me, if you will be so good. I should like to go over the
  bedrooms, if I may; but I want to go without the knowledge of the
  housekeeper. She is rather a talkative woman, and I dare not take any risks
  just now."</p>

  <p>"Then you'd better come in at once," Mrs. Glynn urged. "The housekeeper
  has just gone down to the village, and she is certain to be away for an
  hour."</p>

  <p>But it was far less than an hour that served Cowtan's purpose. There was a
  smile of quiet triumph on his face as he left the house. Mrs. Glynn was
  awaiting him.</p>

  <p>"You have discovered something?" she asked, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I have discovered a great deal, madam," Cowtan said, quietly. "I am
  certain now that Mr. Mirriton did not commit suicide. It is only a question
  of a few days, and I am sure that the insurance company will be perfectly
  satisfied. I can't tell you any more at present, but by the end of the week
  everything will be cleared up."</p>

  <p>It was fully three days before Cowtan received his telephone message from
  the manager of the Monoplane Safety Razor Company. They had had no difficulty
  in tracing the purchaser of the blades in question, because it so happened
  that he had bought them from the head branch direct.</p>

  <p>"It was a new razor," the manager went on. "It was purchased with the
  customary twelve from Diamond and Co., in Oxford-street. Unfortunately, the
  blades were faulty, and the gentleman who bought the razor wrote to us
  direct. He was very angry, and, of course, we were only too pleased to send
  him twelve fresh blades."</p>

  <p>"One moment," Cowtan interrupted. "Let me clearly understand. Am I to take
  it that one of these changed blades was actually wrapped up in the envelope,
  a portion of which I sent you?"</p>

  <p>"Most emphatically you can," the manager replied. "You see, we kept the
  letter of the gentleman who complained. We should do so in the ordinary
  course of business. We never like to offend customers. Especially a customer
  who has purchased two of our razors within the last year. If you would like
  to know his name and address, I shall be happy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not on the telephone," Cowtan interrupted, hastily. "I'll come to London
  this afternoon and see you. Then perhaps you won't mind making a statement in
  writing and lending me that letter for a day or two."</p>

  <p>The manager was perfectly willing, and, with a feeling of pride in his
  work, Cowtan rang off. Outside in the corridor he came in contact with his
  superintendent.</p>

  <p>"Running the office, eh," the latter said, jocularly. "What's all that
  telephoning about? And what are you going to London for?"</p>

  <p>"I'm going to London, sir," Cowtan said, crisply, "to get the last piece
  of evidence which will enable you to arrest the person who murdered Mr.
  Mirriton. Oh, I've worked it all out, sir. By the time I come back this
  evening I'm quite certain that I shall be able to convince you that I am
  right. You will be able to get your warrant and arrest the murderer without
  any fuss."</p>

  <p>The superintendent whistled softly. "I suppose you know what this means
  for you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Promotion, I hope, sir," Cowtan said, modestly. "I'm sanguine that they
  may give me a chance at Scotland Yard. I expect to be back by the seven
  o'clock train, and I should like to come round, if I may, to your house and
  discuss the matter afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Come and have some supper," the superintendent said, heartily. "I hope
  this will be a good thing for you; and it won't be a bad thing for me if it
  comes to that. Well, good luck to you, and may you not be mistaken."</p>

  <p>There was nothing wild or excited about Cowtan as he entered the
  superintendent's sitting-room at eight o'clock the same night. He ate his
  supper heartily, and took the cigar which his superior officer proffered to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Now, in one word," said the latter, "who is the man?"</p>

  <p>"The man who murdered Mr. Mirriton is his cousin, Patrick Hayes," Cowtan
  explained. "I have the proofs here."</p>

  <p>"But the man was away at the time. He telephoned from Westborough Town
  saying that he had missed his connection. All that came out in the evidence
  at the inquest."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad you mentioned that, sir," Cowtan said, "because that's exactly
  what Mr. Hayes did not do. You see, I was the first person to see the body.
  While they were sending for you, I spent my time in looking about. And I
  dropped upon what occurred to me to be a clue. I had to deduce one or two
  points. But I was quite justified by results."</p>

  <p>"Stop a bit," the superintendent said. "Give me a pointer or two. What did
  you discover in the bathroom?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I discovered that Mr. Mirriton had not cut his throat with the
  razor that was found close by the body. I didn't say anything of this at the
  inquest, because if I had I should certainly have scared my man away. Now,
  Mr. Mirriton was an old-fashioned type of English gentleman&mdash;the sort of
  man that hates change. If you look at the razors in this case you will see
  that they are of a very antiquated type. The razor he was supposed to be
  shaving with had blood smeared all along the edge. If it had been used to
  sever the artery, the blood would have been sprinkled over it. I had that
  razor in my hand, and I made a startling discovery at once. The blade had
  been smeared with vaseline. The edge was so dull that it would not even cut a
  bit of paper. The other razor in the case was in fine fettle. I contend that
  one of the razors went wrong, and that Mr. Mirriton had smeared it with
  vaseline, intending to take it to London some of these early days and get it
  properly set. Therefore, I felt sure that he could not have cut his throat
  with that weapon, and, as the other razor was folded in the case, some other
  means of destroying life had been adopted. Now, having established my theory
  of the murder, I had to decide whether the guilty party had entered the
  bathroom from inside the house or from without. The bathroom window was some
  sixteen or seventeen feet from the ground, and as I could find no marks of a
  ladder, I decided that the murderer was in the house at the time Mr. Mirriton
  entered the bathroom."</p>

  <p>"Go on, Cowtan," the superintendent said, encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir. It couldn't be the housekeeper or Mrs. Glynn. And I found
  something else in the bathroom which I will mention presently. You will see
  just now how my second discovery turned my attention towards Mr. Patrick
  Hayes. I put a few adroit questions to Mrs. Glynn and elicited the fact that
  Mr. Hayes ought to have been here on the night of the murder, but that he
  unfortunately missed his connection at Westborough Town, and telephoned from
  there that he could not get back. This struck me as being rather a clever
  alibi in its way."</p>

  <p>"If the exchange people were in collusion."</p>

  <p>"There was no occasion even for that. I don't suppose that you've noticed
  that the telephone wires extend eight hundred yards from the road across the
  fields to The Orchard House. It would be an easy matter for Hayes to come
  here and cut the wires, and thus obtain contact with the house by means of
  what telephone linesmen call a "tapper." As a matter of fact, Hayes did this.
  He spoke in an assumed voice as if he were a trunk operator, and then, in his
  natural tone, told Mrs. Glynn that he could not get back. The repairing of
  the wire was an easy matter, and that is exactly how he established his
  alibi. I can show you to-morrow, if you like, exactly where the wire was cut
  and a fresh piece connected up with the insulator. More than this, I have it
  from the exchange at Westborough Town that there was no trunk call from there
  to The Orchard House on the day in question. Hayes informed me that he spent
  that night at the Station Hotel, though, as a matter of fact, they had not a
  single guest in the house."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't prove much," the superintendent said&mdash;"I mean, it
  doesn't actively connect Hayes with the crime."</p>

  <p>"I'm coming to that, sir," Cowtan went on. "This is what I found in the
  bathroom."</p>

  <p>He took from his pocket-book a scrap of paper, in which the blade of the
  safety razor had been enclosed, and proceeded to unfold that side of the
  story.</p>

  <p>"That's interesting," the superintendent murmured.</p>

  <p>"I thought it would be," Cowtan said. "I picked up that bit of paper in
  the bathroom grate, and I found the blade that came out of it in the garden.
  Hayes was cunning enough to tell me he did not shave himself, but in his
  bedroom I found a Monoplane Safety Razor with the blade in use. There were
  ten blades in the case, and this one I now produce from my pocket makes a
  dozen. I can produce evidence to prove that those actual twelve blades were
  purchased from the Monoplane people, and his letter to them ordering the same
  I have on me now. I have not the slightest doubt that Hayes came back to The
  Orchard House very late on the night of the murder and let himself in with
  his latch-key. A little later&mdash;and that prying housekeeper will tell us
  how deeply in debt he is. But that's a digression, sir. I don't profess to
  say exactly how the murder was committed, but probably Hayes followed his
  employer into the bathroom and attacked him from behind. A blow might have
  rendered him partially insensible, and while he was on the floor the deed was
  done. I expect, if we knew the truth, Hayes had a fresh blade for his razor
  in his hand&mdash;indeed, he must have done so, or I should not have found
  the envelope in the grate. All he had to do was to draw the blade across the
  throat of his victim, and the thing was done. After that he locked the
  bathroom door, and dropped lightly through the window to the ground. And
  that's about all I've got to tell you. It is for you to say, sir, whether
  I've given you enough to justify you in applying for a warrant for the arrest
  of Mr. Patrick Hayes."</p>

  <p>The superintendent pitched his cigar into the fireplace. "Excellent,
  Cowtan, excellent!" he cried. "I'll just go across to the nearest magistrate
  and swear an information. You shall go with me to London to-morrow, and help
  me to effect the arrest. And it won't be my fault if they don't hear a good
  deal about this at Scotland Yard."</p>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4">IV. &mdash; A CHRISTMAS DEPUTY</a></h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Weekly Irish Times</i>, December 8, 1917</h3>

  <p class="first">MARSDEN was listening more or less mechanically to the small
  boy who was trotting along the frosty road by his side. For it wanted only a
  few days to Christmas, and there was a keen frost in the air, and a thin
  powder of dry snow along the hedges and on the bare trees in the woods.
  Marsden noticed all this in the same drab mechanical way as he had noticed it
  many a time before in happier days when he had come down from London to spend
  a fortnight or so in the neighbourhood where he was born. He had come again
  this year without knowing why, probably because he had nothing else to do,
  and though he had found it difficult to keep away, he was beginning to regret
  his decision, all the more because every inch of the ground there filled him
  with bitter associations. And it had bee so different a year ago.</p>

  <p>Then everybody had been glad to see him, his own people had welcomed him
  with open arms, and over there at the Manor House he had been received with
  every manifestation of delight. And there was another attraction in the shape
  of Mamie Lang, Squire Formby's niece, who usually came into the neighbourhood
  at that time of the year.</p>

  <p>But all that was over now. It had been a sill quarrel altogether, one of
  those stupid misunderstandings that neither of them could explain, and
  neither wanted to explain for the matter.</p>

  <p>Why had he come down this time at all, he asked himself. He could have
  gone over to Paris for Christmas with one or two of those lively Bohemian
  friends of his, but for some reason for which he could not account he had
  come down to Longmarsh instead, and already he was bitterly regretting
  it.</p>

  <p>To begin with, he was utterly unexpected. His married sister and her
  brother-in-law had gone off to keep Christmas with her husband's people, and
  only one servant had been left in the house. Therefore, it was likely to be a
  quiet Christmas, though that did not matter much to Marsden, because it would
  be quite in keeping with his present mood.</p>

  <p>He knew very well that if he only said the word a warm invitation would
  have reached him from the Manor House without delay. But he had kept out of
  the way on purpose, he had deliberately avoided the small Manor House
  children and intended to do so until Christmas Day was over, more especially
  because he had a very shrewd idea that Miss Mamie Lang would be spending the
  festive season there, as usual.</p>

  <p>So he spent his time roaming about the frozen roads in an aimless sort of
  way, and doing certain work he had brought down with him. This policy of
  concealment had served him very well till a few minutes ago, as he emerged
  into the road by a fieldpath, he had run bang into the arms of little Jimmy
  Formby, who hailed him with delight.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, up in London town, as usual, Jimmy," Marsden said. "Seeking my
  fortune."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you don't look as if you had found it," the small boy lisped. "You
  look as if you had lost something."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I have, Jimmy," Marsden said.</p>

  <p>"Well, never mind about that now," the small boy went on. "Are you coming
  to us for Christmas?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not this year, Jimmy. You, see, I am very busy. Christmas is
  all very well for little boys and girls, but even on Christmas Day certain
  people have to work, and this year I happen to be one of them."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going now?" Jimmy asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I was going for a walk," Marsden explained.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll come with you," Jimmy said amiably. "I am going to have lots of
  presents, Phil. But not so many as Grace, because she is a little girl, and
  they always have more presents than little boys. Do you have many
  presents?"</p>

  <p>"Not one, Jimmy. You see, there's no one at home this year. It doesn't
  matter about me, because I'm a man, you know. Are you going to have a big
  party, this Christmas?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, ever so big, Phil. Just the same party we had last year. Aunt Mamie's
  come."</p>

  <p>"Has she? How long is she staying?"</p>

  <p>"Well, only over Boxing Day this time. Because before long she's going to
  Australia."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed," he said. "I'm sorry to hear that."</p>

  <p>Jimmy looked up through his clear eyes.</p>

  <p>"I thought you would be," he said. "You were very fond of Mamie, weren't
  you? Mother thinks so."</p>

  <p>"Ah, mother's a wise woman," Marsden laughed. "Well, I hope you'll have a
  good time, Jimmy. And I'm only sorry I shan't be there myself."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't think we're going to have quite so good a time as we had
  last year," the small boy said. "The presents are all right, but Mr. Santa
  Claus isn't coming."</p>

  <p>"That's bad," Marsden said gravely.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with him?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Jimmy said gloomily. "But I think that he has sprained his
  ankle."</p>

  <p>Marsden was beginning to comprehend. On the last happy occasion, just a
  year ago, Santa Claus himself had materialised at the Manor House in all the
  glory of scarlet robe and white fur and venerable beard to the great delight
  of the young people, and to the entertainment of the old ones who knew, of
  course, that the great personage in question was none other than that popular
  local bachelor and practical joker, Tom Kelly, a sportsman and landed
  proprietor, who lived close by. But to the children Santa Claus had been real
  indeed, and that this misfortune was a serious one was testified, too, by
  Jimmy's solemn countenance and unsteady underlip.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," Marsden said. "He was such a jolly old Santa Claus last
  year. Now I wonder if I wrote him a letter&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jimmy's eyes gleamed.</p>

  <p>Jimmy went on his way presently, his small breast swelling with
  self-importance, and himself almost bursting to tell Grace, his small sister,
  that perhaps after all&mdash;but no, he wouldn't do that, Phil trusted him,
  and he was very fond of Phil.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Marsden, with a certain project at the back of his mind, went
  back to the lonely house, and got out a small runabout car. Twenty-minutes'
  brisk run took him to a long grey stone house lying back in a wood, which was
  the bachelor abode of the popular Tom Kelly.</p>

  <p>"Well, old chap," he said. "This is a nice business, isn't it. Here am I
  laid by the leg in Christmas week with nothing on earth the matter with me,
  and a dozen invitations downstairs waiting to be answered. I was out with the
  gun a day or two ago and put my foot into a confounded rabbit hole with this
  result. Yet I'm as fit as a fiddle. I've got a couple of pals coming to dine
  with me on Christmas Day, and I am going to try and hobble
  downstairs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where had you intended going?" Marsden asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, to the Manor House, as usual. I always prefer to spend Christmas with
  the kids. I was going to be Santa Claus, but all that's been knocked on the
  head now. Formby has told the children that Santa Claus is laid up, and that
  he is quite as disappointed as they are. And that's a fact, old man. Unless
  perhaps&mdash;by Jove, I've got it."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know what you're going to say," Marsden replied. "You think I
  might take your place. Well, that's just what I've come to suggest. I suppose
  you've got the dress and all the rest of it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, lor, yes. It's very good of you, Phil. You may not like it at first,
  but you will enjoy it in the end. Now, ring the bell, and my man will get you
  what you want. I wish to goodness I could go myself, but that's
  impossible."</p>

  <p>Christmas morning came, and the early Christmas dinner which they held at
  the Manor House for the sake of the children was a thing of the past. Evening
  came at length, and with it a note for Mr. Formby, which he read before the
  assembled mob of excited children with due gravity.</p>

  <p>"A most remarkable thing," he said, solemnly. "Here's a letter from Santa
  Claus. He apologises for the delay, but in consequence of his lamentable
  accident his business has been neglected. But he says that he has managed to
  get hold of a brother of his who will undertake&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then he's coming," Jimmy shouted excitedly. "I knew he would. I've known
  it for some time!"</p>

  <p>"Who told you, Jimmy!" Mamie Lang asked.</p>

  <p>She was standing, a pretty picture of youth and grace and beauty by
  Jimmy's side, and she smiled down at him now as he spoke. He looked up at her
  with an air of importance that caused her eyes to dance.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," he said. "I knew."</p>

  <p>"I hope everybody has had something," Santa Claus said. "I hope no one has
  been forgotten. You see, I had to come here in a great hurry at the last
  moment, and perhaps my list isn't complete. Now, if I have left anybody
  out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Jimmy looked up eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he cried. "There is Aunt Mamie."</p>

  <p>"One of your little friends?" Santa Claus asked.</p>

  <p>"No," Jimmy screamed. "She's grown up. That's her, Santa Claus, the pretty
  girl with the blue eyes standing by the door. And if you haven't got anything
  for her, I must give her one of my toys."</p>

  <p>"Oh, never mind about me," Mamie said smilingly. "I don't suppose Santa
  Claus knew that I was in the house."</p>

  <p>"I ask your pardon, Madam," Santa Claus said, gravely. "But on occasions
  like this I always carry an extra present or two in case of emergency. Jimmy,
  will you be good enough to give this to the lady by the door. And ask her not
  to look at it till she's alone. She might be disappointed with it, and I know
  she wouldn't like to hurt my feelings. And now, let's go into the hall and
  I'll show you a new game."</p>

  <p>It was Jimmy who solved the mystery. They were giving Santa Claus a rest a
  little later on, and a cigar which he seemed to strangely appreciate, when
  Jimmy, with a solemn face, crept up to him and whispered something in his
  ear.</p>

  <p>"Eh, what's that?" Santa Claus asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, in the library," Jimmy whispered with portentious gravity. "She's
  there all by herself, almost in the darkness, and she's been crying. She said
  she hadn't, but I know better. I know that sniffy noise people make when
  they've been crying. I think she's disappointed in that present of yours.
  Else why should she have it in her lap and sniff over it?"</p>

  <p>"Jimmy," Santa Claus said excitedly, "you just stay here and say nothing
  to anybody, and I'll go and speak to her myself."</p>

  <p>"Will you!" Jimmy said, hopefully. "Perhaps you can give her another
  present, and take the old one back."</p>

  <p>"Well, I might give her another present, but I'm hoping she'll keep the
  old one. And if I'm right you shall have the best present you ever had in
  your life."</p>

  <p>Very quietly Santa Claus crept out of the room and made his way to the
  library. He stood in the doorway with his wig no longer on his head and his
  beard discarded. He was watching Mamie sitting there in an attitude of
  dejection, he could just see that she was holding something in her hand that
  glittered.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't help it, Mamie," he said. "I was bound to let you have the
  chance of getting your ring back. I didn't intend to do so at first, but when
  I arranged this thing with Tom Kelly, so that the children should not be
  disappointed, I thought I would take the chance of giving you the ring with
  my message. It was Jimmy who gave me the opportunity I wanted. It's no use,
  Mamie, I couldn't stay away, I can't forget you. And when I came here
  to-night and remembered how happy we were this time last year&mdash;won't you
  forgive me?"</p>

  <p>Mamie rose to her feet and came towards him, with eyes shining, and an
  unsteady smile on her lips.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing to forgive," she said. "We have both been proud and
  foolish, and there is no more to be said."</p>

  <p class="first">PETER RAND was an artist in his profession. He knew every
  detail of his business, he had nerve and courage and practically nothing in
  the way of scruples. He trusted nobody, and had an utter contempt for good
  faith in others. With these valuable assets he should have made money. But,
  unfortunately, his one abiding weakness lay in Peter's delusion that there
  was money to be made by the backing of horses. And, as a natural consequence,
  there were times when Peter was very hard up indeed.</p>

  <p>It was at one of these crises that Peter abandoned his usual cautious
  methods and took an unnecessary risk in connection with a safe and a solitary
  house at Hampstead. A day or two later it became painfully evident that Peter
  would have to retire for a time&mdash;that is, a period of seclusion was
  essential, if anything in the nature of a logical alibi was to be proved.
  Peter would have to disappear from his usual haunts for at least six
  months.</p>

  <p>He would have found it difficult to explain how it was that the idea of a
  trip to the Klondike first occurred to him. It mattered nothing that he was a
  child as far as mining was concerned, because Peter had not the slightest
  intention of winning a fortune from the frozen ground by the sweat of his
  brow. On the contrary, the plan of campaign was to collect the dust from the
  tents and huts of confiding prospectors. But the confiding miners in question
  proved to be few and far between, and Peter's one attempt in the direction of
  unearned increment met with disastrous failure. Within an hour or two he
  found himself bruised and battered outside one of the camps, and with a very
  hazy knowledge in the matter of local geography. To put it plainly and
  bluntly, Peter Rand would have died in the snow of starvation, had it not
  been for the friendly assistance of a tourist who was returning from that
  bleak and inhospitable country.</p>

  <p>There was nothing in common apparently between rescued and rescuer. The
  latter was a slender little man, with dark, restless eyes, and much vivacity
  of manner. He appeared to be possessed of ample means, he had a servant or
  two, and his travelling appointments were quite luxurious. So far as Rand
  could gather the other man who gave his name as Eli Magnus, was travelling
  entirely for pleasure. He had every appearance of being a rich man, so that,
  before long, Peter began to entertain hopes that the acquaintanceship might
  bring something lucrative his way. For, to tell the truth, Peter was in sore
  case. He was a derelict in a strange land, he did not possess a single coin,
  and he was anxious to get back to London as soon as possible. He dismissed
  the idea of doing a little fancy work in New York with a sigh. He had no
  tools, and no knowledge of where to obtain them. Perhaps, when the city was
  reached, chance might throw in his way an opportunity of robbing his
  benefactor. But, as it turned out, there was no necessity for doing anything
  of the kind.</p>

  <p>They came to a depot at length, and for the first time in his life Peter
  found himself travelling first-class. It was a long journey to New York, and
  Magnus must have paid good money for his companion's ticket, to say nothing
  of the food and drink consumed on the journey. Peter began to grow a little
  uneasy and suspicious. This sort of generosity disturbed him.</p>

  <p>"This is costing you some money," he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Bread on the waters," Magnus smiled. "Now, look here, partner. I suppose
  you'll think I'm a moneyed guy just out for pleasure. Well, I guess you're
  barking up the wrong tree if you do. I went to the Klondike with a light
  heart and a deck of marked cards, and&mdash;well, I calculate I've come back
  with neither. Now, say old man, what did you go to the Klondike for?"</p>

  <p>"To get gold, like the rest of them," Peter growled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know. But you didn't mean to get it with a pick, sonny. When you
  made that mistake and got into the wrong hut, and they fired you out into the
  trackless prairie, you left a little black bag behind you. Your line is not
  exactly mine, but I can appreciate a really fine set of tools when I see
  them."</p>

  <p>"They cost me over a hundred quid," Peter groaned; "I feel quite lost
  without them. Only let me have that little lot back, and I'll not grumble at
  New York for a bit."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, you don't, Peter," Magnus said, with his most charming smile.
  "You mean exactly what you say. Because, you see, I know something of London.
  I once had a little argument myself at the Old Bailey, and at the same time
  they were giving you a deal of unnecessary worry. I recognised you the first
  day you came into the camp, and, as to those tools of yours, you needn't give
  yourself any further anxiety, because they happen to be at the bottom of one
  of my packing-cases. It occurred to me that we might do a little business
  together. Now, did you ever happen to hear of Cyrus J. Brott, the
  multi-millionaire?"</p>

  <p>Peter nodded. Brott was one of those plutocrats of New York, and his name
  was equally familiar to both hemispheres. He was a bachelor who occupied a
  mansion in Fifth avenue, and although he was given to hospitality on a lavish
  scale, his own habits were believed to be exceedingly simple.</p>

  <p>"What about him?" Peter asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, he might be pretty useful to us. Cyrus lives all alone in a great
  big house that cost a few million dollars to build. He is a collector of all
  sorts of things, and they say that his safe is crammed with a dozen fortunes,
  each of which one might stow away in a waistcoat pocket. Cyrus is frequently
  away from home, and, as a matter of fact, he's out west now on some mining
  business. I happen to know that he's not expected back to New York until the
  fall. The house is crammed with a small army of useless servants, and they
  are the people we have to deal with. You know how little occasion there is to
  worry about the servants. And, now, Peter, is it a deal or is it not?"</p>

  <p>Peter drew a long breath of pure delight. It sounded like an ideal crib to
  crack, and the knowledge that his beloved tools were safe filled him with
  joy.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you can count me in!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>All that Peter would have to do for the present, Magnus informed him, was
  to live in New York on the fat of the land, and pass his evenings in music
  halls and the like. Peter was inclined to dream as to the time when he could
  turn his back upon his profession, and retire to a little farm in the
  country. Therefore he hailed with satisfaction Magnus's announcement to the
  effect that all was ready, and that the fateful night was at hand.</p>

  <p>At a few minutes past 12, Peter strolled down Broadway, according to
  directions, and stopped in front of the house which had been previously
  pointed out to him. He stood there grinning pleasantly, and pictured to
  himself what Mr. Brott would look like when he heard of his loss.</p>

  <p>He stood waiting for the signal, and he was surprised and somewhat uneasy
  to see lights flitting about the house. This was by no means an auspicious
  start, but, still, if trouble did come, then Peter had the consoling
  reflection that it would fall entirely on the shoulders of Magnus. The lights
  disappeared at length, and Peter could see that the hall door was being
  cautiously opened. He caught a glimpse of Magnus in immaculate evening
  dress.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," he whispered. "Here's the lift. I can work it. The
  servants are all safely in bed, and we shall have a clean run for hours."</p>

  <p>"What did all those lights mean?" Peter asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't you trouble about them. If anybody turns up, I shall know
  exactly what to do. I'm not wearing these glad rags for nothing."</p>

  <p>Peter raised no further objection. All the same, he was still feeling a
  little uneasy. After all, he knew little or nothing about Magnus. The latter
  had been particularly careful not to bring him in contact with any of his
  friends.</p>

  <p>The lift was moving swiftly upwards in the intense darkness&mdash;a
  darkness so thick that Peter could not distinguish a single object about him.
  The lift stopped at length, and Peter stepped out on to the thickest carpet
  his adventurous feet had ever trodden upon. He was no foe of darkness, but
  then he did not know a yard of the house, and, if the unexpected happened, he
  would be taken like a rat in a trap. He had no arm of any kind&mdash;indeed,
  he despised revolvers.</p>

  <p>They threaded their way down what appeared to be an incredible long
  corridor, and Magnus turned into a big room at the back of the house. He
  produced from his pocket a small but powerful electric torch, and flashed it
  upon a smooth steel door, which appeared to be the entrance to the
  strong-room. On the floor stood a little black bag, which Rand recognised
  with gleaming eyes. He took a little ivory measure from the bag and proceeded
  to go over the door with it. He gave a grunt of satisfaction presently.</p>

  <p>"No great complications here," he said. "He hasn't got so much as an
  electric alarm. It's a Kastner safe with eight bolts, and it's carbide steel
  two-sixteenths thick. I guess this job will take me about a couple of
  hours."</p>

  <p>"Well, go ahead," Magnus said cheerfully. "I'll sit here and watch
  you."</p>

  <p>For the next hour or more Peter worked steadily at the safe, until the
  perspiration poured down his face. And presently the delicate mechanism of
  the lock lay exposed to view. Magnus bent eagerly over the bewildering tangle
  of little shining ratchets and tumblers.</p>

  <p>"It looks all infernally complicated," he muttered.</p>

  <p>Peter smiled grimly. All that delicate, shining, bewildering mechanism was
  as plain as a child's illustrated alphabet to him. He touched a bolt here and
  a lever there, and, behold, the whole fell together, as easy as the pieces of
  a puzzle in the hands of an expert. Peter appeared to press something with a
  tiny pointed instrument, and the great door of the strong-room fell back on
  its oiled hinges without a sound.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with that?" Peter grunted triumphantly.</p>

  <p>He switched on the electric bulb hanging from the roof of the strong-room,
  and staggered back with a cry of admiration and astonishment.</p>

  <p>The walls were absolutely lined with treasure, the rays of light gleamed
  on silver and gold gems. In his mind's eye, Peter could see the little farm
  expanding into an estate. Suddenly there was a click of a switch, and
  instantly the whole place was bathed in brilliant light. Seated in empire
  armchairs on either side of the fireplace were two men in evening dress.
  Peter would have described them without the least hesitation as "nobs." He
  saw a smile flash from one to the other; he saw a look of malicious mischief
  in the twinkling eyes of Magnus.</p>

  <p>"What's the game?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm afraid it's too bad of us," Magnus said. "But, perhaps, in the
  first place, I'd better tell you who I really am. Or you might ask one of my
  friends by the fireplace."</p>

  <p>"Guess I thought that everyone knew Cyrus J. Brott," one of the audience
  drawled. Peter gasped.</p>

  <p>The pseudo Magnus smiled. "Very sorry to take advantage of you, my dear
  man, but really I couldn't help it. That little fairy story I told you about
  the Old Bailey was only partially true. I went there once merely as a
  visitor, and you happened to be on trial at the time. I never forget a face.
  Now, a few months ago my secretary skipped, taking a good deal of liquid
  stuff with him, and, incidentally, the key of my strong-room. I had reason to
  keep the thing secret at the time, but, all the same, I was anxious to run my
  wandering Willie to earth, and, when I heard he was in Dawson City, I lit out
  in search of him. I didn't find Van Stein, but I hit upon you instead. When
  they fired you out, the idea came to me that I might get you to open the safe
  without having a lot of talk amongst people whom it did not concern. If I had
  told you the truth, you wouldn't have come. You would have suspected some
  trap, and probably given me the slip. That's why I posed as a sharp."</p>

  <p>Peter grunted. "And, now, what do I got out of this little lot? You can't
  hand me over to the police, because, in a manner of speaking, I'm your
  servant. And I don't deny that it's a bitter disappointment. When I saw that
  fine lot of boodle in there, I felt for a moment like murdering you and
  collaring the lot."</p>

  <p>The man called Magnus laughed pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"You've had a pretty good time for the last few weeks," he said, "and,
  according to your own showing, the air of New York is still more healthy for
  you than that of London. Now, what do you say to five hundred dollars and
  your passage home to England?"</p>

  <p>A dismal groan broke from the unhappy Peter. It was deplorable to stand
  there with all that priceless wealth dazzling his eyes, and to know that none
  of it was coming his way. And he was absolutely helpless. If he declined to
  take the proffered sum, he might be kicked ignominiously into the street,
  and, in addition, the New York police might be invited to take an interest in
  his future. His host, with a wave of the hand, indicated a table upon which a
  dainty and attractive supper had been laid out. The meal in question was
  flanked by an array of bottles. At the mere sight of them Peter's jaundiced
  philosophy took on a healthier tone.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's dashed hard," he said. "Yes, sir, I will have some of that
  pie, Champagne? Why, certainly! And if you can make that five hundred dollars
  into a thousand, I'll take it kindly of you. Oh, I know when I'm
  done&mdash;no man better. And if I had had a chance, and asked a few
  questions&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The host patted Peter on the back patronisingly.</p>

  <p>"You'd have laid your own little scheme," he said. "It cuts me to the
  heart to say so, Peter, but I didn't trust you, my boy. That's why I asked my
  friends here to come round and take part in the performance. By the way, I
  must apologise for my omission in not introducing my friends. Like yourself,
  they are both artists. Mr. Patrick Whelan, the distinguished weaver of plots,
  and Captain Hood, of the American army."</p>

  <p>The two individuals in question bowed pleasantly, and the supper proceeded
  amicably. Under the influence of the meal and its concomitant liquids, Peter
  was fast regaining his equanimity. After all, he had not done so badly. He
  had been rescued from almost certain death outside the Klondike, he had been
  conveyed in luxurious splendour across the American continent, and, at his
  host's expense, he had gained a useful insight into life as it is understood
  in New York. In addition to these blessings, he was returning to England with
  a free passage and something like a hundred pounds in the pocket. Half an
  hour later he took an affectionate farewell of the trio on the doorstep, and
  staggered home to his lodgings, at peace with all the world.</p>

  <p>Some 15 hours later, with an aching head and a dim sense of the proportion
  of things, he crept into a barber's shop with the intention of having a
  shave. There were several customers in front of him and he picked up an
  evening paper.</p>

  <p>And there he found something that made him forget that dull pain at the
  base of his brain.</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">"It was a daring piece of work altogether, and had
  evidently been prepared by an expert hand. Beyond all question, the thieves
  had been aware of the fact that Mr. Brott was away from home. The servants
  received a letter, giving them permission to hold a dinner party in the
  servant's hall, from their master. The forger had enclosed a draft for a
  hundred dollars for the necessary festivities, and the butler had been
  invited to help himself from the wine cellar. In the midst of the rejoicings,
  three masked men had appeared and whilst one of them held up the alarmed
  domestics, the other two proceeded to gag and bind them in a thoroughly
  workmanlike manner. They were all discovered late this morning by one of Mr.
  Brott's secretaries when he called at the house in the usual course of his
  duties. The telephone wires had been out, and the thieves had gone to work
  with the comfortable assurance that they had many hours before them.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">"The door of the strong-room had been forced, and
  valuables to the amount of nearly a million dollars taken away. Mr. Brott's
  priceless collection of rubies was in the safe, and these have disappeared
  with the rest. And as the rubies are for the most part uncut stones, but
  faint hopes are entertained of their recovery. Further particulars of this
  audacious robbery will be found in our 6 o'clock edition."</p><br>

  <p>Peter wiped the moisture from his forehead.</p>

  <p>"A cruel swindle!" he groaned. "Here, I'd better be getting back home.
  This New York is no place for me!"</p>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6">VI. &mdash; ROSE OF THE DESERT</a></h2>

  <h3>Published under syndication in, e.g.:<br>
  <i>Yorke's Peninsula Advertiser</i> Australia, November 5, 1920</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE was no suggestion of tragedy in the little garden, no
  breath of trouble stirred the leaves of the almond trees. The whole place
  would have been fair and beautiful enough had it not been for the handiwork
  of man himself. Here and there along the valley were huge black mounds, like
  festering sores on the sloping hillside, and beyond these again broken
  derricks and the old-time machinery associated with pit-shafts.</p>

  <p>Before the search for coal had began the valley had been a mass of tender
  green larches and birches light and feathery as thistledown; but now the
  mines had gone, too&mdash;failed&mdash;and all that remained here and there
  were the gigantic piles of "slack" which hovered over the valley like some
  dingy avalanche.</p>

  <p>They were quiet, law-abiding folk, these people of the valley, hard
  working and lacking in imagination. They had no hobbies and no outdoor
  pursuits, though the slopes of the valley belonged to nobody in particular,
  and might have made cheap allotment gardens. But the soil was poor and harsh,
  and the attempt had been abandoned in despair. It was nothing to them that
  Paul Trevelyan had succeeded where they had failed.</p>

  <p>But, then, Trevelyan only cultivated flowers. He was different from the
  rest. His speech was clearer, his dress better; it was known that he spent
  most of his money on books.</p>

  <p>And his system of gardening was contemptuously spoken of as "French." The
  villagers did not see the sense of growing lettuces in February and turnips
  and beans before Easter. And as to the flower culture, it seemed rather
  effeminate for a strong man. But Mary Tretise did not think so; the flowers
  were a dream of delight to her. She had blossoms on her tea-table in March
  that a duchess might have envied.</p>

  <p>Mary did not work down at the cloth mills with the rest of the women. She
  had her own hand loom, and it was her province to design fresh patterns for
  the Waylan tweeds that found so much favour in the South. She also lived
  alone in a little cottage up the valley, not far from Trevelyan's. For sole
  company she had a little girl of two, the child of her dead sister Nell.
  Nell's husband had been killed in a machinery accident, and his young wife
  had never held up her head afterwards. A little above her class was Mary
  Tretise, and highly respected by her neighbours, who, nevertheless, regarded
  her as a fool. A girl must be that who had promised herself to a drinking,
  swaggering fellow like Tom Pengelly when, as everybody knew, Paul Trevelyan
  was over head and ears in love with her. She would learn wisdom some of these
  days perhaps.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Mary was learning her wisdom already. It had been a
  great shock to her to discover that he was a drinker. He had promised the
  reformation that never came, and now those reckless grey eyes were growing
  red and bloodshot, and the handsome features were coarsening. There had been
  something of a scene the previous Saturday night, and Mary had not ventured
  out on the Sunday. On the same evening she had posted Pengelly's ring to him,
  and in fear and trembling sat down to wait upon events. Not that it much
  mattered. As far as she was concerned, life was at end. She could devote the
  measure of her ripe years to the upbringing of her little Nell. This was
  Mary's outlook at three-and-twenty.</p>

  <p>Pengelly had not come as she had expected. She had looked forward to a
  stormy meeting; she had steeled herself to face the inevitable. In her sweet
  and gentle way she could be firm enough if she chose. But Pengelly apparently
  accepted his dismissal. For the rest of the week he did not go near the
  mills; most of his time was passed in the village public-house, drinking
  savagely.</p>

  <p>He had a grievance, of course, Mary was a heartless flirt; she cared
  nothing for him, and she had set her cap at Paul Trevelyan. The more Tom
  Pengelly brooded over this, the deeper grew his sense of wrong. There was
  murder in his heart, and tragedy in his glassy eye, as he staggered up the
  valley this lovely April evening. The caressing touch of the sun lay like
  liquid gold on the lurches; here and there a birch stood out flickering like
  loam in the amber light. Somewhere in a thicket a blackbird piped his
  evensong. Surely there could be no evil in such a world as this!</p>

  <p>But Pengelly's heart was black and bitter enough as he slouched past
  Mary's cottage. He was a little more sober now, but no less firm of purpose.
  He made his way up the slope to the spot where Paul Trevelyan's cottage
  stood, and where the tiny garden lay like an oasis in a desert of black stag
  and coal dust. There was just a suggestion of frost in the air, and Paul was
  feeling anxious about his Parma violets. He did not want to cover the frames
  this spring, but it looked as if he would have to. Anyway, he would wait till
  bedtime before deciding.</p>

  <p>He had in his hand a bunch of carnations, on their slender spiky stems. He
  was tying them deftly as Pengelly came along. The sight of these
  clove-scented blossoms sent the blood flaring and humming in Pengelly's hand.
  He snatched furiously at the glowing petals, and tore them in fragrant
  fragments.</p>

  <p>"She won't get those, anyway," he said thickly. "How are you going to take
  it, my lad?"</p>

  <p>Trevelyan made no reply for a moment. He knew perfectly well what was
  passing in Tom Pengelly's mind; he could read him like open print. The whole
  village knew exactly what had happened, and because of this Paul had not seen
  Mary since. Those carnations had been for her, of course. Pengelly had
  guessed that.</p>

  <p>"I shall know how to take it when the proper time comes," Paul said
  quietly. "If you were sober you would not behave like this."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not sober," Pengelly said, with a certain savage pride. "I
  haven't been sober for a week. I've been drinking all the time. And you know
  why, and everybody in the valley knows why. Lor' what a fool I've been! I
  thought she cared for me!"</p>

  <p>"She did care for you. You have nobody to thank but yourself."</p>

  <p>"That's a lie," Pengelly cried. "I'm not good enough for the likes of her.
  She's got her ambitions, dear Mary has. She don't want me any longer when she
  knows that she's only got to put up her little finger and you'll go crawling
  to her feet."</p>

  <p>A dangerous light danced for a moment in Trevelyan's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Take care," he said hoarsely. "Take care, or, drunk as you are, I'll
  teach you a lesson. You are lying in your throat, and you know it. You had
  your chance and lost it. A true true woman like Mary Tretise doesn't play
  with a man like that. Do you suppose she hasn't suffered? Do you suppose that
  she has done this without pain and grief and bitter tears? You said just now
  that you were not good for her. That was true; you're not."</p>

  <p>"And you think that you are?" Pengelly sneered.</p>

  <p>"Possibly," Paul retorted. "I am going to give her the chance of deciding,
  anyway. She won't have me, I know. Still, there never has been another girl
  for me."</p>

  <p>The blood was humming in Pengelly's head again. A red mist blinded him.
  There was something bitter in that feeling of helpless inferiority to
  Trevelyan. Murder was in the air as Pengelly dashed forward. His hands
  clutched for Paul's throat.</p>

  <p>Trevelyan was ready; he had seen exactly what was coming. In point of
  physique he had some little advantage over his antagonist. He was cool and
  collected. His perfect health and strength were too much for the man spent
  and exhausted by his excesses. Pengelly went down presently, limp and
  helpless, the blood pouring from a cut in his forehead. The punishment had
  sobered him somewhat, but the livid hatred in his eyes was undimmed, the
  flame of vengeance burned as strongly as ever. If he could only get even with
  the man! If he could do him some deadly mischief! There might be some way in
  which he could wreak his revenge upon the dual causes of his unhappiness. To
  get these two out of the way, to overwhelm in common destruction! Ah! that
  would be fine! That would be talked about in the village for many a long day.
  Children in years to come would shudder as they listened to the tale of Tom
  Pengelly's revenge!</p>

  <p>He rose from the ground.</p>

  <p>"You shall be sorry for this," he said hoarsely. "You shall repent
  it."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for it now," Paul said bitterly. "Sorry for Mary Tretise's
  sake."</p>

  <p>"Aye, and your own, you treacherous dog! I know a way&mdash;I know a way
  to be rid of the pair of you, I've only got to take a good
  stout&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off abruptly, and his eyes grew hard and cunning. He turned and
  left the garden, all the sweeter and more peaceful for his going. It had been
  a sorry scene with all that brutal violence, and Paul was feeling somewhat
  ashamed of himself. Still, the quarrel had been none of his seeking. He had
  merely defended himself against an attack that had meant something more than
  mere mischief. There was just the chance, too, that Pengelly might turn his
  vengeance on Mary herself. The mere thought of it filled Paul with
  uneasiness. It was only about two hundred yards farther down the slope that
  Mary's cottage stood, and Paul strolled that way. The little house was quiet
  enough; the gleam of the lamplight filled the window of the sitting-room. So
  there was no evil to anticipate in that direction.</p>

  <p>When midnight came Paul stood in the garden still. His thoughts were with
  the cottage down below. Still, as far as he knew, there was no living,
  tangible danger. Nothing less than an earthquake could bring disaster for the
  moment. There were no earthquakes in Wayland Valley, of course, but there had
  been landslides fruitful of disaster now and then. The great mounds of slag
  and cinder at the brow of the disused pits gave way sometimes, and more than
  one cottage had been buried in the avalanche. But precautions had been taken
  as far as the dingy mountain above Paul's cottage was concerned. There were
  big struts and baulks of timber here and there laced firmly together so as to
  form a barrier. Paul forced a smile at his own uneasiness.</p>

  <p>"I'm like some timid girl tonight," he told himself. "I'll go to bed."</p>

  <p>He stood there just for a moment looking up to the stars. It was intensely
  still. Not a breath amongst the larches moved. Then something went off with a
  snap like the sound of a beam of wood cracked in halves. The noise was
  repeated twice in quick succession as Paul stood there wondering. He could
  hear something cracking and groaning much as if some creature were in pain;
  then a great fragment of rock came with a bound down the hillside and crashed
  through the garden. Paul could hear it as it smashed into one of the violet
  frames.</p>

  <p>There were other rocks and fragments hurling themselves down the slope
  now; then a dull, sullen rumbling, followed by a wild, despairing cry for
  help in a human voice. The cry was snapped off short, as if someone had
  clapped a hand over the callers mouth. It came to him like a flash. The
  barricades of timber had given away, and the great avalanche of slag and
  stone and rubbish piled up there by the labours of half a century had fallen,
  and the whole of the hillside was in motion. A wild fear gripped Paul's
  heart.</p>

  <p>Mary! Mary Tretise and the child in the cottage! They were all alone
  there, and sleeping peacefully, utterly unconscious of the danger. With the
  terror creeping on behind him, gathering force as it came, Trevelyan bounded
  down the hillside, and beat frantically on the door of the cottage. A thin
  red light gleamed in one of the windows, and a frightened voice began to ask
  questions.</p>

  <p>"Come out at once," Paul yelled. "The barricade has given way, and the top
  is sliding down the side of the valley. For God's sake, come now!"</p>

  <p>"Don't wait for me," Mary said. "It's very good of you, Paul, but you can
  do no good by waiting. And there is the child. I couldn't come without the
  child."</p>

  <p>Paul hurled himself against the door, and the frame cracked and splintered
  off its hinges. Mary had huddled on some clothing; she had the still sleeping
  child in her arms. She was pallid to the lips, but there was no sign of fear
  in her eyes. Paul caught the child from her arms and dragged her to the door.
  Already the cottage was rocking and trembling to its foundations. Trevelyan
  made for the doorway, only to draw back again. He was white as his companion
  now.</p>

  <p>"It's too late," he said quietly. "The avalanche is upon us. To try and
  get out of the way now would be sheer madness. We may save the child."</p>

  <p>Mary stood there watching Trevelyan. What a man he was! Strange that she
  should care nothing for him, and that she should give all her pure affection
  to&mdash;&mdash;What was Paul going to do? He placed the child in a corner of
  the room, and upturned the stout oak cradle upon it. Then the force of the
  great landslide shook the cottage, and it crumbled like so much broken bread.
  The tiles and rafters slid away, the great square oak beams came tossing to
  the ground. One of them struck Trevelyan on the shoulder, and he fell
  prostrate on the floor. The mass pinned him there; all the feeling in his
  right leg seemed to have gone. A quivering sigh escaped him; he caught his
  lip savagely between his teeth.</p>

  <p>"Are you there, Mary?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," the girl whispered. "I am close by you, Paul. But I can't get up.
  One of the beams has fallen on my leg. I fancy the danger is over now."</p>

  <p>The garden was gone, and the carnations and violets were no more, but Paul
  was not worrying about them as he sat out there in the sunlight a month
  afterwards. He was reading a letter which had just come for him, and he was
  wondering how much longer Mary was going to be. She came presently, her face
  glowing with happiness. At the same time there was a certain gravity in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"They have found out all about it," she said. "Last night they discovered
  Tom Pengelly's body just behind the broken barricade. It was just as you
  imagined, Paul. They found him with the lever for raising the timber still
  grasped in his hand. He must have been mad that night, Paul. Nobody but a
  madman would have deliberately sacrificed his own life for a revenge like
  that."</p>

  <p>Paul was silent. He had known all this from the first; he had known it the
  very moment that he had heard that strange, broken cry on the night of the
  disaster. On that point he had made up his mind to remain silent, but the
  secret was out now.</p>

  <p>Trevelyan passed the letter over to Mary.</p>

  <p>"We shall have something better than that," he said. "Here is a renewed
  offer that was made to me two years ago. I am to manage a factory like this
  in Devonshire. I have seen the house&mdash;a delightful old place, where my
  pet blossoms will grow out of doors nearly the whole year round. It's a
  paradise, Mary. But I didn't take it, because I could not leave you, dear. I
  always had a feeling in my heart that if I stayed here I should get you in
  time. Shall we take it?"</p>

  <p>Mary bent down and kissed Paul tenderly.</p>

  <p>"I shall be glad," she whispered, "very glad."</p>

  <p class="first">ACCORDING to all the rules of the game the party on board
  the deck of the yacht Fireflight, lying off Corfu that sunny afternoon, ought
  to have been at Epsom, for it was Derby Day, and they were all sportsmen to a
  man.</p>

  <p>But then, as everybody who is acquainted with him knows, and they are
  legion, Sir Nichols Brancaster was a law unto himself, and had been all
  through that long and somewhat shady career of his. Doubtless he would have
  been at Epsom but for a little misunderstanding with the Jockey Club over the
  running of a horse some twenty years ago, after which, in the language of Mr.
  Robey, he had been informed that his appearance on Newmarket Heath&mdash;and
  elsewhere&mdash;was superfluous, and that if he did not abstain from
  attending classic fixtures in future, the consequences might be unpleasant.
  And Nicholas Brancaster had been wise enough to lay the warning to heart, and
  though he still took the keenest interest in racing generally, the stewards'
  enclosure knew him no more.</p>

  <p>It had not been exactly an open scandal, for Brancaster was rather too
  rich and powerful for that, but everybody knew it and nobody minded, least of
  all Brancaster himself.</p>

  <p>He was quite an old man now, as years went, a wicked, cynical old heathen
  without heart or conscience, who lived entirely for his own amusement, a sort
  of perpetual occupant of the stage-box, who was quite prepared to pay
  handsomely for the privilege of looking on at the comedy of life, and even
  subsidising the incomes of the actors themselves if he found them
  sufficiently amusing. He rather gloried in his rascality, and when, on one
  occasion, a famous diplomat spoke of a certain colleague as the biggest
  rascal in Europe, Brancaster asked him whimsically enough what was the matter
  with the reputation of Nicholas Brancaster. There was not much in the story,
  but it indicates the man.</p>

  <p>Therefore Brancaster turned his back on London, as usual, and had gone
  yachting down the Mediterranean with a selection of choice spirits, which was
  his usual custom at that time of the year. There were one or two old friends
  of his, a couple of Guardsmen on leave, a young social aspirant of dubious
  origin, but vast wealth, called Clayton-Green, "and," as the playbills, say,
  Mr. Samuel Kilgobbin.</p>

  <p>Not that anybody ever called him anything but Sammy Kilgobbin, the
  middle-aged Irishman who was known wherever the English language was spoken
  from China to Peru. Indeed, there is not a man of any social aspirations at
  all who does not speak familiarly of Sammy Kilgobbin, even though he only
  knows that celebrity by sight. Samuel was big and round and fat of face, with
  the manners of a sporting stockbroker and the morals of a South Sea Islander.
  He was, perhaps, on the whole, a bigger rascal than Brancaster himself, which
  is saying a good deal. But there is a well-known axiom to the effect that one
  man can steal a horse where another can't look over a hedge, and Sammy was
  one of those fortunate individuals. What he lived on nobody knew, and no one
  seemed to care. There was nothing the matter with his pedigree, of course,
  for he came of a good old Irish family, and, from the day he left Eton he had
  ruffled it with the best of them on an income that represented precisely
  nothing. But he was always exquisitely turned out, always to be seen in the
  best company, a popular visitor of the most exclusive country houses, and,
  strange to say, he had the approval of all his tradesmen, whom he made a
  point or paying regularly.</p>

  <p>He was a fine shot, a wonderful hand in the schooling of hunters, a golfer
  on the plus mark, and an amateur comedian in the very front rank. He was
  noisy and witty, perfectly frank in his views of life, which were luridly
  predatory, and, in fact, was a magnificent specimen of the popular scamp whom
  every man of the world kept at arm's length and yet was on the friendliest
  terms with at the same time.</p>

  <p>The great big red-faced and highly amusing Irishman was an exceedingly
  useful chap to know, don't you know. It you wanted a yacht he could find you
  one. If you craved for something especially choice in the way of cigars,
  Sammy knew where to find them. If you were a promising actor, needing
  financial backing, Sammy could produce it; and if you wanted a theatre
  wherein to install some frivolous favorite of the footlights, then Sammy
  could arrange that, too. Always at a price, of course, but that was generally
  understood.</p>

  <p>But the backbone of Sam Kilgobbin's income was undoubtedly Sir Nicholas,
  appropriately called "Old Nick" Brancaster. Something like affection existed
  between the two men, for they had no illusion on the subject of each other's
  weaknesses, and, to all practical purposes, Sam was a sort of glorified
  stage-manager who took a considerable salary for arranging the comedy of life
  for his patron. Not that Sam was paid any regular stipend, but that sort of
  thing was understood. It was Sammy who had arranged the present trip, and who
  had been more or less responsible for the company on deck. For the most part
  they were cheerful and congenial spirits, with the solitary exception of the
  somewhat offensive Clayton-Green, and even at that moment Sir Nicholas was
  lying back in his deck chair contemplating that diminutive bounder under his
  thick black eyebrows, and wondering why the deuce he had been invited. There
  would be comedy later on, no doubt, and Brancaster knew the game much too
  well to spoil it by asking questions.</p>

  <p>For the last half-hour or more they had been sitting round the tea-table,
  and now they had reached the stage of cigars and whiskys and sodas, and had
  fallen to discuss, in a lazy, inconsequent fashion, what might be the result
  of the classic race and when they were likely to hear the name of the
  winner.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you'll get that fast enough," Kilgobbin said in that big, oily voice
  of his. "Ye'll get it at any moment."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" Brancaster asked.</p>

  <p>"Ye mean to say ye don't understand," Sammy retorted. "Then perhaps you'll
  tell me why I went to the trouble of having the Fireflight fitted up with
  wireless."</p>

  <p>"I noticed that," Brancaster said. "What did you get out of it, Sammy? Of
  course I know I shall have to pay, and, I hope you've got a thundering lump
  in the way of commission."</p>

  <p>The little man, Clayton-Green, laughed offensively as he polished his
  eyeglass. If that mean soul of his was capable of any deep feeling, it was a
  perfect hatred of the Irishman, who ridiculed him on every possible occasion.
  And he had never forgotten the time, two years ago, when, by some strange
  chance, he had found himself the guest of a Scotch duke in his shooting box
  and when enquiring of Sammy Kilgobbin what he should lay out in the way of
  tips to the keepers, had been recommended by Sammy to give them nothing on
  the ground that he was never likely to be asked to that shoot again. It had
  been rather a cruel and offensive remark to make, but there was no doubt in
  the keen sardonic humor of it, and Clayton-Green was not likely to hear the
  last of it. He turned to Sammy now and grinned.</p>

  <p>"What do you make out of Brancaster a year, Sammy?" he asked offensively.
  "He must find your acquaintance expensive."</p>

  <p>"And so would ye, ye little divil if ye was half as generous," Kilgobbin
  retorted good-humoredly. "Bedad, it isn't every one of us whose grandfather
  made a fortune in the rag trade. What do I cost you a year, Nick, my
  boy?"</p>

  <p>Brancaster smiled and chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, I never troubled to enquire, Sammy," he said. "Two or three
  thousand, I suppose. But you're worth it my boy, oh, yes, you're worth it.
  But what about that wireless? Do you mean to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I do. I arranged it the day before we sailed. It was one of my happy
  ideas as I was walking down Bond-street one day. Two or three times they have
  worried me to equip the Fireflight with wireless, and here was tangible proof
  that the chance to make a hundred or two in the way of commission, and,
  bedad, I did. And, thinks I, we'll try it for the first time on Derby Day.
  And so we shall."</p>

  <p>"That's a rattling good notion of yours, Sammy," one of the Guardsmen
  said. "What you call a paying proposition, eh?"</p>

  <p>It was some ten minutes later before the steward came on deck with a sheet
  of paper in his hand. There had been signs overhead for some little time that
  something was going on in connection with the wireless, and here was tangible
  proof that Sammy had not been exaggerating. He took the paper in his hand and
  bent his big red face over it.</p>

  <p>"Well, here ye are," he said. "I'll just read it aloud. Uncas first,
  Machine Gun second, Bon Enfant third. Wait a minute, here's a bit more.
  International golf match, Sandwich, 4 o'clock. Taylor and Vardon 3 and 1.
  Braid did 'The Maiden' in one stroke. Now I call that nice and friendly on
  the part of those people in Bond-street to throw that last bit of information
  in. Sort of a gift, perhaps. Well, if it isn't, Brancaster will have to
  pay."</p>

  <p>"Brancaster always does," that individual murmured. "Well, thank God I
  didn't back anything for this year! It was too open a race for my taste. But
  who the deuce is Uncas? I never heard of him. He certainly wasn't amongst the
  starters when we left Southampton. If I had had to make a choice, I should
  have said that Bon Enfant was a snip. Anybody on the winner by any
  chance?"</p>

  <p>No response came from the little group round the table except from Sammy
  Kilgobbin, who shook his head solemnly with the air of a man who declines to
  be deceived by appearances.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's a drame," he said. "Nothin' but a drame. I refuse to belave it.
  Shure, such a bit of blazin' luck couldn't happen to me."</p>

  <p>"You backed him, Sammy?" Clayton-Green asked.</p>

  <p>"I did, my boy, I did," Sammy said, still shaking his head almost
  sorrowfully. "I did it as you might say by accident. It was three months ago
  that one of 'the boys' gave me the tip, one of 'the boys' that I done a good
  turn to. 'Have a century on, Captain,' he said, 'ye'll never regret it.
  Besides, the horse will sure to come to a short price, an' ye'll get some
  good hedging.' And to make a long story short, and havin' a century I didn't
  quite know what to do with&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"One of Brancaster's centuries, I suppose," Clayton-Green said
  pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"It was not," the imperturbable Sam responded. "I won it over a dead
  certainty betting with a little snipe who was rather like you to look at. But
  it doesn't matter. I put that money on Uncas and forgot all about it. He
  never came into the betting at all, and it's any odds that he didn't carry a
  shilling besides stable money. But it's a drame, I tell ye, nothing but a
  drame. It's a hideous mistake. If it isn't I've won ten thousand pounds. And
  I don't believe that the fates would ever allow me to get away with a little
  wad like that. It's wrong, all wrong. The man who sent off that message has
  made a bloomer, me boys, if he hasn't he's got the names mixed up. I never
  was a lucky man, and never shall be. All the money ever earned in my life
  I've got by my own industry and the exercise of the talents that Providence
  has given me. And that's why I refuse to believe that I'm in over this."</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense, Sammy," Brancaster said, encouragingly. "Virtue rewarded
  occasionally though it seldom starts favorite. Here, let's have another round
  of liquor up to drink Sammy's good health."</p>

  <p>But Kilgobbin still shook his head. "Did ye ever hear tell of a banshee?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>"An American drink?" Clayton-Green suggested.</p>

  <p>"It is not. It's a female spirit that hovers, in times of misfortune,
  round the house of the real gintry, and so ye'll not have to worry yourself
  about it, ye little shrimp. The noight me father died, and his father before
  him, the banshee was heard, for, you see, it's the tradition of my family
  that death always follows what appears to be a stroke of good fortune. And
  the night me father died he'd sold a big string of hunters to a bit of a
  lieutenant who was buying cavalry horses for the British Government. And,
  bedad, that was his bit of good fortune, but by the same token he died before
  morning, rest his soul, and that was an end of him."</p>

  <p>"And what's the moral of it all, Sammy?" Upton, of the Guards, asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's loike this me boy. Here's a bit of good fortune come to me,
  and, bedad, I don't want to die not so long as old Nick here is alive, and I
  can make a bit out of him. So I'll just tell ye that I'll do. We'll have a
  bit of hedgin' and get the better of the family banshee this way. I'll wager
  any of ye a cool thousand pounds that those names are all wrong and that
  Uncas hasn't won the Derby after all. If he has, then here's a chance for
  some of ye to make a thousand, and if I am right then I stand on velvet. Now,
  don't all speak at once."</p>

  <p>They didn't. The idea of Sammy Kilgobbin paying any of them, or anybody
  else for that matter, a thousand pounds if he lost struck them all as a
  peculiarly exquisite piece of humor. For Sammy made it his invariable rule to
  pay no one except tradesmen, and therefore there must be a trap somewhere. It
  was only Clayton-Green who sat up and began to take notice.</p>

  <p>From the bottom of his miserable little soul he hated and loathed the big
  Irishman, and would have paid away a good sum of money he loved so well to
  get even with him. But he was not blind to the advantage of keeping on the
  right side of Kilgobbin. It had been a source of perpetual wonder to him ever
  since he had begun to make his way in society that these men whom he envied
  so tolerated the exuberant Sammy at all. They all knew, for instance, what he
  was, they all knew that he was utterly unscrupulous, that he had not a
  shilling of his own, and that he made no secret of the fact that he was out
  to get the best of everybody by any means in his power. But, all the same,
  Sammy was to be seen everywhere. He belonged to some of the best clubs,
  mainly because his father had belonged to them before him; he was received in
  the most exclusive houses, and with Cayton-Green's own eyes he had seen that
  irrepressible Celt hammering a duke in the region of the liver and addressing
  him without reproof as "Toko." And Clayton-Green would have given a thousand
  pounds gladly for the privilege of calling any duke by his nickname in the
  presence of a mixed company.</p>

  <p>He knew, too, that Sammy would do anything for money, and he was not blind
  to the advantage of having Kilgobbin on his own side. Strange as it seemed,
  it meant so much socially. And here was a possible chance of making money and
  scoring off the Irishman at the same time. And even if he lost, Sammy would
  be in his debt, and this fact, doubtless, would render him more civil in the
  future. He would take the bet, and even if he won and Sammy refused to pay,
  then he would be none the worse off, and the moral advantages would be all on
  his side.</p>

  <p>"I'll take you," he cried eagerly.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't talking to you," Kilgobbin said. "I was offerin' that privilege
  to me own friends."</p>

  <p>"They don't seem anxious," Clayton-Green grinned.</p>

  <p>"No, they're not," the second Guardsman observed. "Who would take
  advantage of a simple soul like Sammy?"</p>

  <p>"Well, he offered the bet," Clayton-Green protested. "But one might have
  known that he didn't mean it."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, I do," Kilgobbin said, with a gleam in his eyes. "Never shall
  it be said that a Kilgobbin went back on his word. Maybe it's a good thing
  for you and maybe it isn't&mdash;not that I meant it for you in any case.
  When I scatter my hard-earned gold I always do it amongst the right sort.
  Still, as none of these chaps seem anxious, you can have the bet if you like,
  and there's an end of it. An even thousand that Uncas has not won the Derby,
  and another thousand, if you like, that Bon Enfant has. It's upside down
  those names are, and I'm betting big money on it. And I ain't a
  philanthropist either. If I'm wrong I win eight thousand, and if I'm right
  I'm about fifteen hundred in."</p>

  <p>"All right," Clayton-Green drawled.</p>

  <p>He took from his pocket an elaborate gold-mounted betting book and
  solemnly made an entry. It was characteristic of Kilgobbin that his record of
  the transaction was made on the back of an old envelope. He did not appear to
  be in the least elated, on the contrary, he was quite quiet; and, for him,
  almost depressed. It was only Brancaster, lying back in his deck chair
  watching the others from under those thick bushy eyebrows of his, who
  appeared to extract any sort of amusement from the situation. He made one or
  two sarcastic remarks to the effect that he would like to know what
  Clayton-Green proposed to do with the money when he'd got it, a comment that
  produced a shout of unfeeling laughter, but which did not appear to disturb
  the serenity of Kilgobbin in the least.</p>

  <p>"Well, why not find out if you're right or wrong, Sammy?" Brancaster
  asked. "Wire back to your sporting pal and ask him to repeat the
  message."</p>

  <p>"And what's the good of that?" Sammy retorted. "The thing is done now, and
  there's an end of it. Besides, it's past six o'clock, and that place in
  Bond-street will be closed long before the message gets through. We're sure
  to pick up an English paper this side of Gib."</p>

  <p>Brancaster carried the suggestion no further, and presently the party on
  deck adjourned for dinner. They turned the yacht homewards in the morning,
  cruising leisurely along the Mediterranean until they fetched up at Gibraltar
  at the end on the week and there took their mail and newspapers on board. It
  was one of the Guardsmen who first got hold of the "Times" and tore the cover
  off impatiently. He turned the pages over to the sporting columns and laughed
  unfeelingly.</p>

  <p>"Here you are, Sammy, my boy," he said. "Whatever happens, you always fall
  on your feet. What will you take for that old family banshee of yours? By
  Gad, I should like to run her permanently as a sporting prophet."</p>

  <p>"What are you giving me?" Sammy asked as he helped himself liberally to
  ham and eggs. "What's doin'?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing, old boy, except that you are right and our friend
  Clayton-Green here is wrong. That pal of yours in Bond-street muddled things
  up just as you said he had, and somehow got the news of the first three in
  the Derby all wrong."</p>

  <p>"Then, bedad, I'm the poorer by eight thousand pounds," Kilboggin
  exclaimed. "But I knew it all the time, I felt it in my bones. It wasn't to
  be expected that an unlucky divil like Sammy Kilgobbin would ever pull off a
  coup like that. If I had I should have been sorry for it. I should have
  certainly had a visit from the banshee, and probably by this time should have
  found a watery grave in the Mediterranean. So I suppose that Bon Enfant won
  after all?"</p>

  <p>"He did. He was first and Uncas was third, just as you said they would be.
  Still, it's hard luck!"</p>

  <p>"Bedad, it's nothing of the koind. Ye see, my boy, I should never have
  lived to enjoy me good fortune, which means that me friend Clayton-Green
  would never have been paid. As it is, he's got to pay me. Well, I think I
  deserve it. Shure, a man ought to be paid for a bit of fine foresight like
  mine. An' I'll trouble ye for that cheque at your earliest convenience. An'
  it's glad I am ye can afford to part with it."</p>

  <p>On the whole, Clayton-Green took it with a fairly good grace. It was
  absolutely gall and wormwood to him to know that instead of placing Kilgobbin
  under an obligation that volatile Irishman had got the better of him, and
  that in any case, he was some hundreds of pounds in pocket over the whole
  transaction. Still, the chaff and the laughter went deep enough under
  Clayton-Green's epidermis, and he was glad enough to make an excuse presently
  that he had letters to write, and retired to think the thing over in the
  seclusion of his own cabin. There rankled somewhere in the back of his mind
  that suspicion that he had been "had" by the wily Sammy, indeed, he was
  half-inclined to believe that he had been inveigled on to the yacht for that
  very purpose, but though he turned the matter over in his mind again and
  again he could find nothing tangible upon which to act. After all, probably
  it had been a bit of blind chance on Kilgobbin's part, and by the same
  perverse fate he had been selected as the victim. Well, it served him right;
  he had rushed in like a fool where angels, in the shape of the other guests,
  had feared to tread, and he had paid the penalty. He handed over his cheque
  later on in the day with an air of simulated cheerfulness. He even attempted
  to congratulate Kilgobbin.</p>

  <p>But there was one man on board the Fireflight who was not quite so
  satisfied, and that man was Brancaster. Later in the evening he crept in his
  bunk, where he sat up, a pleasing picture in pink silk pyjamas smoking a
  cigarette and regarding Sammy Kilgobbin shrewdly from under those deep
  eyebrows of his. They were quite alone together in the cabin.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me all about it, Sammy," he said.</p>

  <p>"All about what?" Sammy asked innocently.</p>

  <p>"My dear chap, you mustn't suppose that I am going to pay for the theatre
  and the limelights and all the stage essentials without being trusted with
  the plot of the play. I mean, how did you do it?"</p>

  <p>"Niek, old man," Sammy said quite seriously. "Did it ever occur to you
  that some day I shall be a back number, that some day the bright young
  spirits in the clubs will shrug their shoulders when my name is mentioned and
  speak of me as that confounded old bore. Sammy Kilgobbin? 'Quite a good sport
  in his day, but getting dotty now, don't you know.' And I've got to provide
  for that time. You may provide for me, on the contrary, you may not. Not but
  what I've done thundering well out of you, but still&mdash;&mdash;So I've
  saved up a few thousands, and when I get hold of a mug like Clayton-Green I
  take out another thousand or two in Government annuities. When I'm fifty-five
  I reckon I shall have about two thousand a year, which is as much as I shall
  need then. I don't mind being blackguarded, but I'll be hanged if I live to
  be pitied."</p>

  <p>"You old ruffian, I felt sure you were up to one of your tricks when you
  told me that you had asked Clayton-Green to join us. Now, come out with
  it.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't so might bad, was it?" Sammy grinned. "The idea occurred to me
  when that agent asked me to get you to fit up the Fireflight with wireless.
  And when I thought it all out. I picked on Clayton-Green as the most likely
  ass for my purpose. Mind you, I arranged to have those names transposed, or,
  at any rate, placed in wrong order. That little touch about the golf match
  was a stroke of genius. Hidden underneath it is my code, and in that code I
  had to have a capital V, and knowing that the International Golf Match was
  taking place at Sandwich the same day. I chose that because it gave me the V
  in question. Besides, it made everything look natural. But, Lord bless ye, me
  boy. I could have had the whole lot of you if I'd liked, but Noblesse Oblige,
  Nick, Noblesse Oblige."</p>

  <p>"A very proper sentiment," Brancaster grinned. "Good-night, Sammy, old
  man, and many thanks for the comedy."</p>

     name="ch8">VIII. &mdash; THE SUPREME TEST</a></h2>

  <h3>Published under syndication in. e.g.,<br>
  <i>The World's News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 14 and 21 April 1923 (2
  parts)</h3>

  <p class="first">THE big dining-room at Heronsmoat was all in dusky shadow,
  save for the glow-lamps burning incense before the pair of Holbeins on the
  west wall, and the twin Rembrandts opposite, and the shaded points of
  filtered electric gleams half hidden beyond the pink and gold and blue
  orchids that twined lovingly around them. In the centre of the fine old room,
  a small oblong table carried those priceless blooms and the matchless
  Waterford glass and Cellini silver which formed some of the treasures of Sir
  Bryan Goldworthy's house. And in it he and his forebears had lived and died
  any time this last four hundred years. Soldiers they had been, and statesmen
  and diplomats, with never a one to bring any stain on the family
  escutcheon.</p>

  <p>But Sir Bryan was none of these. He was quite content to stay at home and
  manage the broad estates and look after his shooting and the famous herd of
  Shorthorn cattle which was a household word far beyond Heronsmoat. He had
  come back after a great day with the hounds, he had bathed and changed into
  his perfectly cut evening dinner-suit, and was now dining with his wife, at
  peace with all the world. It was a wonderfully mild and soft November night,
  so that the big log fire had been allowed to smoulder down, and the curtains
  over the two French windows, that gave on to the terrace, were open, and the
  silken folds were drawn back showing a purple patch of wintry sky powdered
  with a clutch of misty stars. A decorous silence reigned everywhere.</p>

  <p>The man seated at one end of the table was young, not more than five and
  thirty, with a finely-cut face and a short upper lip that denoted not only
  his power and determination, but pride of race as well. If Bryan Goldworthy
  had a weakness&mdash;and few people had noticed such a fault&mdash;it was his
  pride of birth and family and the consciousness of the cleanness of the
  ancestral record. But for the most part it was a handsome, kindly face
  enough, with generally a smile for all he met and a look of almost adoring
  affection for the woman who sat facing him on the other side of the
  table.</p>

  <p>She was worth it, too, every divine inch of her. Tall and slight, all
  graceful curves and bewildering lines under her silken sheath of a dinner
  gown, Betty Goldworthy fitted into the picture as a fine piece of imagery
  fits into the masterpiece of some famous poet. Her wine-colored hair wound
  round her small head and white brows, with its one diamond star, seemed the
  dominating note that gave inspiration to the room. And when she smiled and
  those red lips of hers parted over the gate of pearls, then Bryan Goldworthy
  lay back in his chair and told his intimate gods that he had nothing else in
  the world to want for.</p>

  <p>Yet she had not been of his world, and she had told him so very plainly
  when he had sought an introduction to her after hearing her sing one night at
  Harrogate, where he had taken his invalid mother for treatment some few
  months before the proud old dowager had died. All this had happened nearly
  three years ago, when the critics were raving over the new contralto and
  vowing that she had all the world at her feet, which was true enough, and a
  great singer can go anywhere, even in circles where a Goldworthy might have
  found it hard to follow. She had not a single relative in the world, she told
  Goldworthy; she owed her education and her musical training to a stranger,
  who was now dead, and her art sufficed. All this with the smile that went to
  Goldworthy's heart and even melted some of the ice of pride and tradition
  that had collected in the course of years, round the heart of Lady
  Goldworthy, and told Bryan that in spite of her brilliant promise she was
  very lonely.</p>

  <p>Within a month Sir Byran was at her feet, and within six months even the
  dowager, with all her pride and prejudice, was brought to believe that her
  immaculate Byran might do worse. She came to understand what Bet was
  sacrificing when she gave up her career to marry the master of Heronsmoat,
  which she did because Bryan wanted her and because she was one of those fine
  natures that finds life's happiness in giving royally where her heart was in
  question. But there was one thing she had never told Bryan, because she
  shrank from doing so as long as the dowager Lady Goldworthy lived,
  because&mdash;well&mdash;because we shall see, all in good time. And nothing
  seemed to matter now when they had nothing but themselves to think of, and
  perfect happiness is a fine anodyne for a dead trouble.</p>

  <p>She was not thinking about this crumpled roseleaf now, as she sat there
  opposite her husband, with the soft light touching her ivory tints and making
  lakes of her dark eyes with the little flecks of gold in them. She was lapped
  just then in a warm sea of happiness, and the tide of life was at the
  flood.</p>

  <p>Bryan Goldworthy struck a match and lighted his after-dinner cigarette;
  the lantern clock over the big carved mantelpiece struck ten on a drift of
  silver bells. A footman crept into the room and spoke to his master with due
  respect.</p>

  <p>"Can Vellacot speak to you a moment, sir?" he asked. "He thinks he has
  captured one of the Maudesley poachers."</p>

  <p>Goldworthy was on his feet in a moment. Vellacot was his head keeper, and
  the Maudesley poachers were a sore thorn in the flesh of all at Heronsmoat.
  Up to now they had laughed at all sorts of authority, and never yet had one
  of them appeared before a bench of magistrates. And Goldworthy was very sore
  about it.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean that Parsons!" he cried. "Where?"</p>

  <p>"Vellacot's cottage, Sir Bryan," the man said. "With two of the helpers
  looking after him."</p>

  <p>With a word of apology to his wife, and a smile, Goldworthy vanished.
  Betty sat there calmly waiting. She was feeling just a little sorry for that
  unfortunate poacher, and all the more because her sympathies were
  instinctively democratic. She could never quite understand the sacredness of
  anything that flew and had the freedom of the woods. And what difference did
  a bird more or less make when a man might need a meal? Still, perhaps it was
  part of the traditions of the house, like the rest of the family pride, and
  Bryan had all that to the full. There was pride in everything that he did,
  from the way he treated his servants to the manner in which he passed the
  humblest woman on the estate with uplifted hat. And here was his wife, who
  ought to have been behind him in all these things, wishing that the unhappy
  poacher might make his escape. She had watched a poacher once.... years
  ago.</p>

  <p><br>
  SHE was conscious of a step on the stone terrace outside. It was a hurried
  step past the open windows, then the silken curtains parted, and a man
  stepped into the room.</p>

  <p>He was big and broad, a magnificent figure of humanity, dark to
  swarthiness, with a romanesque face in a setting of black hair sprinkled with
  grey. He carried with him the breath of the woods and the freedom of the
  broad highway. A man like that could never have lived in the atmosphere of a
  town.</p>

  <p>Dress him properly and put him down in the Carlton or the lobby of the
  House of Commons, say, and he would have been marked and his identity
  demanded by the curious in personal psychology; dressed as he was, in a
  deerstalker cap and rabbit-skin waistcoat, with cord trousers strapped at the
  knees, he was just one of those wandering Romany nomads who swing along
  country lanes on the front of a caravan, swaying with the basketwork peculiar
  to the tribe.</p>

  <p>"Ham!" Lady Goldworthy whispered. "What does this mean?"</p>

  <p>The man smiled, a broad, benevolent smile with the spirit of kindliness
  shining behind it. Yet there was trouble in those clear dark eyes, and an
  appeal that brought Lady Goldworthy instinctively to her feet. She was
  beginning to understated.</p>

  <p>"I didn't aim to do it," the man said, in the soft accent of the
  countryside, that sounded strangely out of place on his lips. "I never meant
  to come disgracing the little girl as I carried in these arms of mine many a
  mile. We seen you, me and Luke, to-day, in your car, we did. And we knowed
  this two years as our little gal were her ladyship in these parts. And didn't
  Azoubah always say as you would come to great things?"</p>

  <p>They made a fine contrast as they stood there, the woman in her clinging
  silk with the diamond flashing in her dusky hair, and the shaded table with
  its artistic confusion of plate and glass and warm, red fruits behind her.
  She stood there, a perfect picture in a perfect frame, as if she had been
  born to the part. And over against her the big man in his moleskins, and his
  atmosphere redolent of the soil.</p>

  <p>"What is the trouble, Ham?" Lady Goldworthy asked.</p>

  <p>She was perfectly at her ease, quite cool and collected, and with no fear
  of what might happen any moment now. Here was fate taking a hand in the
  unfolding of her life, and she would know how to meet the crisis when it
  came.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't help it," the big man said, with a sob in his voice and
  hanging his head like a child. "I come to see Sir Bryan, and they told me it
  was not possible at this hour, and if there was anything particular I'd
  better come in the morning. But by that time Luke will be in gaol."</p>

  <p>"Go on," Betty whispered. "I am beginning to understand, Luke has been
  arrested on a charge of poaching. He is detained at the cottage of our head
  keeper, Vellacot. And you came to see Sir Bryan before the police were called
  in."</p>

  <p>"That's it, little girl, that's it," the big man said. "It was but a
  rabbit as Luke took, but he'd scared off those Maudesley poachers and they
  dropped a silk partridge net as Luke picked up. And him never in trouble in
  his life afore. If he gets six months, as is certain, it will kill him. We're
  a rough lot, we Stanleys, but none of us has even been in gaol before, and we
  has our pride same as the gentlefolks. There's royal blood in our veins, as
  you know, little gal, though I ought not to call you that."</p>

  <p>"I, at any rate, am pleased to hear you call me so," Bet smiled. "How did
  you find your way here?"</p>

  <p>"When they refused me at the big door, I came along the terrace on the way
  to the main road, and I see you sitting here, and on the impulse I came in.
  Because Luke's going to prison and it will break the heart of him. Him what
  loves the smell of the good red earth and never slept under cover since he
  were at his mother's knees. You got to save him, Bet. You got to."</p>

  <p>As Lady Goldworthy turned, she saw her husband standing in the doorway.
  She smiled as she saw the doubt and anger and outraged pride struggling for
  the dominant mastery on his face.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what does all this mean?" he stammered.</p>

  <p>By a sort of blind instinct he closed the door behind him and drew the
  curtains across the open window. All that fine, intimate, exclusive world of
  his lay crumbling at his feet; he could sense the scandal that hung
  threateningly over his house.</p>

  <p>"Bryan," Bet said quietly, "this is Mr. Ham Stanley. He is one of the last
  of the real Stanleys, and there is royal blood in his veins. It is his only
  son who is detained at Vellacot's cottage on suspicion of being connected
  with those Maudesley poachers. Mr. Stanley says that his son picked up that
  partridge net when he surprised the gang, and if Luke says so, then it must
  be so. Luke is incapable of telling a lie. We were brought up as children
  together, and I know."</p>

  <p>"And by what right does Mr. Stanley intrude here?" Goldworthy asked
  frigidly. "Has the whole world suddenly gone mad? What claim has this man on
  you, Betty?"</p>

  <p>"As the only father I ever knew," Betty said.</p>

  <p>Goldworthy dropped into a chair like another Marius seated amidst the
  ruins of Carthage. The thing was preposterous, farcical. Betty and this man!
  That beautiful, smiling creature, and a wandering seller of basket work! Oh,
  madness, certainly!</p>

  <p>"You are actually asking me to believe this?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"Only because it is true," Betty said. "I told you that, so far as I knew,
  I had not a single relative in the world, and that was also true, Mr. Stanley
  will explain."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you had better be seated," Goldworthy said wearily. "This
  business looks like being a long one."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather stand if your honor don't mind," Stanley said, with a rugged
  dignity that sat well on him. "And, mind you, I didn't come here meaning to
  intrude, though I knew as the little gal were mistress of this great house,
  and happy, as she deserves to be. But, Lor' bless you, sir, me and
  Azoubah&mdash;that's my wife sir, as is dead and gone&mdash;always knew as
  the little gal would come to big things. And that's why, after she'd gone out
  into the great world and made a name for herself I never answered her
  letters. But never forgotten, little maid, never forgotten."</p>

  <p>A fine, rugged natural affection glowed in Stanley's eyes. There was
  something great and noble in this simple man that appealed to all the proper
  pride in Goldworthy's heart.</p>

  <p>"Tell my husband everything," Betty said. "He should have known long ago.
  Ham, you have done me a kindness by coming here to-night. Everything, mind
  you, from the start."</p>

  <p>"It was like this, sir," Stanley went on in his direct simplicity. "We had
  no little gal for ours had died, and Azoubah was pining for another. Prayed
  for one, she did, and the Lord He up and answered her prayer.... We come
  across her by the roadside in a silk shawl and a note, asking the finder of
  the little mite to be good to her.... and we was. Brought up as our own child
  she were, until she come to be about twelve, maybe. Then Azoubah, she makes
  up her mind to send the little gal to school, she being that forward with her
  knowledgement. And different from us, as you could see from the first. Look
  at me, sir, and tell me could you make anything but a pure Romany of Ham
  Stanley?"</p>

  <p>Goldworthy nodded vaguely. He was trying to visualise this big, strong
  man, with his simple dignity and pride of freedom, in the garb, black and
  white, that he wore himself. There was breed in every line of the man, as
  Goldworthy could frankly admit.</p>

  <p>"I thank you, sir," Stanley went on. "And it was the same with the little
  lass. You can't make an Arab out of a moorland pony, and you can't make what
  you see there out of a pauper's child as you find on the roadside, unless the
  right blood is there. Do you see what I mean, sir?"</p>

  <p>Goldworthy nodded again. The right blood must be there. He could see it in
  every line and curve of Bet's figure, in the easy carriage of her head and
  the smile on her lips. It was the sort of smile one sees at great railway
  termini and on the wharves whence ocean-going liners sail, the smile of one
  who parts with a loved object bravely, and hides the tear behind a smiling
  mask. She had no fear or shame, either, nor did the diamond in her hair
  tremble or the flowers on her corsage vibrate unduly. But a foundling!
  Goldworthy swallowed hard as he thought of it. There had been one other such
  instance in the history of the house, but she had turned out to be the
  kidnapped daughter of a noble knight. Her portrait loomed vaguely over
  Goldworthy's head with much the same smile on her lips that he could read on
  Bet's now.</p>

  <p>"So we sent her to school. The money didn't matter, because we have more
  than we want, we Stanleys, though we do live in a caravan. And she did well;
  took scholarships, and went on to college. It was her music master who found
  out she had a voice and showed her the way to get to Italy. And she became a
  sort of queen as Courts raved over, and our little lass was famous at
  twenty-three. But she got to love a man and stepped down from her throne and
  married him, and honored him by doing it."</p>

  <p>Goldworthy started. This was a new point of view to him, a sort of
  electric mental shock, but his innate sense of fairness told him that perhaps
  Stanley was right. Patti had had her court, and Lind had hers, and who would
  ever have asked a question as to the birth of either? And Patti was the
  intimate friend of a great and powerful queen. Truly. Goldworthy was learning
  things.</p>

  <p>"She came and seen us just the same, when she could spare the time, and
  once we went to the Albert Hall and heard her sing. Ah! But when she married,
  which we heard of just befor Azoubah died, we makes up our mind to leave her
  to her new life and see her no more. 'Twasn't fit like. And we didn't."</p>

  <p>"That was not my fault, Ham," Betty spoke for the first time. "I wrote you
  more than one letter."</p>

  <p>"I know it, my dear," Stanley smiled, "and those letters be in my pocket
  at this very moment. But you was her ladyship, and we was only wanderers on
  the face of the earth, and Luke and me was of the same mind. You would never
  have seen us now, but for the bitter trouble as Luke fell into. And we come
  this long way out of our beat just to get a secret look of your face once
  more. I wish I had cut off my right hand first."</p>

  <p>"Is all this true, Bet?" Goldworthy asked.</p>

  <p>"Every word of it," Bet responded proudly. "But don't you think, Bryan,
  that there is something else before we consider our own intimate matters? Ham
  comes here in great trouble, to right what he considers to be a great wrong.
  He is concerned for his son, who was my playmate until I was twelve, and if
  you believe him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I most certainly do," Goldworthy said evenly. "The word of a gentleman is
  always to be accepted."</p>

  <p>"Meaning me?" Stanley asked. "Me, as isn't too proud to sit on a cottage
  doorstep and mend a broken basket!"</p>

  <p>"I should like to see this boy of yours, Mr. Stanley," Goldworthy went on,
  "and if you like I will come along with you now. As a matter of fact, I have
  been telling my keeper that he has no kind of right to detain his prisoner.
  It ought to have been a matter of a summons before magistrates&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And what difference would that make, sir?" Stanley asked. "They would
  have convicted him just the same. Ah, I know these county gentlemen where the
  game is concerned. Six months for any man caught with a net in his
  possession. But if you see the boy, sir, and believe what he says, then you
  can decline to go any further, and we can get on the high road again."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Goldworthy said, "I will come at once."</p>

  <p>"I think I will come along," Bet said evenly. "It is a fine, dry night,
  and I shall take no harm."</p>

  <p>Goldworthy raised no objection, and, with a wrap over her shoulders, Bet
  set out with the others on the way to the keeper's cottage. There, presently,
  they found themselves in a dimly lighted outhouse, where a young man, a finer
  counterpart of Ham Stanley, raged up and down, with hair dishevelled, and a
  cold, despairing fury in his dark eyes. The wild hostility which he turned on
  Goldworthy died as he met Bet's steady gaze.</p>

  <p>"You!" he gasped. "Our Bet! Father, it's you as done this thing. Why drag
  the little lass into it? She ought never to have known. It was mother's wish
  on her dying bed. Gone out of our lives, had Bet, into the place as God
  Almighty intended for her, and there was an end of it. You shouldn't have
  done it, father."</p>

  <p>It seemed to Goldworthy that he was groping like a child in a new world.
  Was he the same man who, an hour or so ago, had surveyed the plains of life
  from the horizon of his dining-room with the atmosphere of refinement and
  aloofness from the common herd? The dim light, the white washed walls, the
  wild-eyed young man fighting for his liberty and yet prepared to sacrifice
  all that the lover of the wild holds most dear rather than bring trouble on
  to a girl who has gone out of his sphere for all time! Here was something
  calculated to bring even a Goldworthy to his knees. His fine sense of justice
  rose to it.</p>

  <p>"Believe me," he said, almost eagerly, "believe me, I only want to see
  justice done. Your father did the only thing possible in the
  circumstances."</p>

  <p>"I'd rather have gone to gaol," Luke Stanley muttered.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, I believe you would," Goldworthy cried, with a sudden
  admiration. "But tell me your story, my boy."</p>

  <p>"I had the rabbit all right," Luke explained. "But the net I found. The
  Maudesley lot mistook me for a keeper, as I was gathering firewood in the big
  meadow, and took to their heels. Then the keeper comes up and I was done.
  But, Lord bless you, sir, who is going to believe the mere word of a
  gipsy?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm going to, for one," Goldworthy said. "And as it rests entirely
  with me, there is an end of it. We old families must stick to one another,
  you know. What is to become of all the old blood in Europe if we don't?"</p>

  <p>Bet listened with a queer feeling at her heart. In her eyes there was
  something fine in the way her husband was behaving. He had had a great shock
  that night, and yet nobody but herself could possibly have guessed it. But
  what of the aftermath, when he and she were alone together? But be this as it
  might, she had never loved him as much as she did at that moment....</p>

  <p>They were outside presently, under the shadow of the darkness. There was a
  powder of stars adrift on the purple velvet of the sky. A great silence
  brooded everywhere. A little way along the road the caravan loomed in the
  murk. Ham Stanley paused before it.</p>

  <p>"I thank you, sir," he said, in his fine, simple way. "But, after all,
  it's no more than I might have expected from the man as the little lass chose
  as a mate. Ah, she'd know, she would. And to-night you go your way and we go
  ours, and we shall never meet again. It's better not, sir, and, besides, I
  promised Azoubah on her dying bed. And she knew. There was no wisdom like
  hers. Harness up old Pete, Luke, and let's be moving."</p>

  <p>"Not quite like that, Ham," Bet cried; "not quite like that, if you
  please. Come here."</p>

  <p>She held out one hand to Luke, but the other went round the broad
  shoulders of the elder man. Then she laid her lips on his swarthy cheek and
  broke away presently with a cry in her throat that sounded like a sob.</p>

  <p>"The little lass," Stanley said dreamily. "The little lass as we was both
  so fond of.... But it's better that way."</p>

  <p>The caravan, with its swaying load and ancient horse, plunged slowly down
  the road, and was presently lost to sight and hearing down the high road. Bet
  watched it with the tears streaming freely down her cheeks. In that battered
  old caravan some of the happiest years of her life had been passed. She was
  back in the old days now, and the man at her side was almost forgotten for
  the moment. Without a word, he touched her on the arm, and in silence they
  made their way along the road until the house was reached. The great secret
  was still their own, and never a one would be any the wiser, unless either
  chose to proclaim it to the world. It would be sacred so far as the Stanleys
  were concerned.</p>

  <p>It seemed almost strange to Bet that nothing had changed since she had
  last turned her back on Heronsmoat; she did not find the old house in ruins
  about her feet. The cloistered order of the place was moving on oiled wheels
  all the same, the servants in the great hall, the pictures on the walls, the
  clock in the tower, with its leisured chimes. They both turned by instinct
  into the small library where they sat after dinner when alone and made their
  plans for the morrow. The shaded lamps burned low; a pleasant wood fire
  spluttered and crackled on the wide hearth. Goldworthy dropped into a chair
  with his face half in shadow. Almost mechanically Bet sat on a stool at his
  feet as she was in the habit of doing most evenings. It was she who spoke
  first.</p>

  <p>"This has been a great shock to you," she suggested.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Goldworthy replied. "Let us try and discuss it calmly, if you
  please. You first, I think."</p>

  <p>With a childlike confidence, Bet laid her elbows on her husband's knee,
  and the familiar gesture touched him.</p>

  <p>"What am I to say," Bet asked. "Oh, I know&mdash;why didn't I tell you in
  the first place. But I think I did, Bryan. At least, I told you that I had
  not a single relative in the world and that I owed everything to a stranger,
  who was dead. You knew about my schooldays and my scholarships, and how I
  managed to get to Italy, and how I completed my training there. I told you
  that my father and mother died before I could recollect them, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But was that strictly true, Bet?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not, but it did not seem to matter much then. Nothing seemed to
  matter to a girl who found herself famous at my age. But I don't think they
  spoilt me, Bryan."</p>

  <p>"They didn't," Goldworthy conceded almost eagerly.</p>

  <p>"That remark is like you, Bryan. Well, I had the whole world at my feet; I
  was another Titian. What mattered it what I was? Who would have cared had I
  been born in a workhouse? They accepted me for my gift, and, I hope, a little
  for myself."</p>

  <p>"Everybody did," Goldworthy murmured. "Go on, Bet."</p>

  <p>"You are very just," Betty said, with a little catch in her voice. "Bryan
  dear, my position was as good as yours. There is more than one sort of
  aristocracy, you know. When we first met amongst your friends, no questions
  were asked. If I had told you the truth then, the great world would have been
  just as glad to take me as I am. And then you loved me. I did not realise it
  at first, but when I did I was just the happiest girl in all the world.
  Because, Bryan, I was very lonely. No man, least of all a man like you, with
  a position like yours, can ever know how lonely a girl can be who has no
  relatives. And I was so glad, so glad to find that you loved me for myself.
  But it was a struggle, Byran, a terrible struggle. I loved my art, I loved to
  stand there on the platform and feel that I could hold a vast audience with
  my voice. And I worked so very hard before I got there. Disraeli must have
  felt like that the first time he found he could compel a hostile House of
  Commons in spite of itself. For my dreams had come true and the world was all
  my own. Do you understand, Bryan?"</p>

  <p>"Go on," Goldworthy murmured. "I am beginning to understand many things.
  We men are blind fools in all sorts of ways."</p>

  <p>"It was a great fight, Bryan. My darling career on the one side and my
  love for you on the other. Oh, Bryan, only an artist can realise what I was
  asked to sacrifice, though you may smile&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Goldworthy sat quite still, with his face shielded from the light of the
  fire. Bet could see no more than his shadow.</p>

  <p>"I am not smiling," he said. "I am learning things."</p>

  <p>"I was like a princess happy amongst her people, who had been asked to
  step from one throne to another. I lay awake all one night and fought it out.
  And when the dawn came I knew that love had conquered. I knew that my woman's
  instinct had prompted me to do the only thing. Then I slept for a long time,
  and when I awoke I was in a sort of paradise."</p>

  <p>Her voice was vibrating now, and the tears were in her eyes. But
  Goldworthy's face was still hidden in the shadows.</p>

  <p>"But if you had told me then," he suggested. "If only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please don't interrupt me yet, Bryan. Then you introduced me to your
  mother. She was a&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Woman who loved you from the first."</p>

  <p>"You are wrong, Bryan. You men never see these things, but the other woman
  knows them by instinct. You were everything to your mother. There is never a
  girl in the world who, in a mother's eyes, is good enough for an only son
  like you. She never showed it, like the grande dame that she was, but the
  antagonism was there, and I had to fight it, as women do. And I won, Bryan,
  not so much because of my own qualities, but because your happiness was the
  one thing in the world a woman who was dying most valued. Remember the school
  she had been brought up in, remember that she was related to most of the
  great houses in England. She grew to be proud of me and my voice, she
  delighted when I gave up my career to become your wife; but if I had told her
  the truth, and she had turned from me, what would you have done, Bryan?"</p>

  <p>"A man's life happiness&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah, precisely. You would have gone your own way, and I should have had it
  on my conscience that I had driven your mother to her grave before her time.
  That's why, Bryan."</p>

  <p>"And afterwards?"</p>

  <p>"Well afterwards nothing seemed to matter. I have been too happy to think
  of the past. If you had made one sacrifice, I had made another. I don't
  regret mine, Bryan; and now that you know, perhaps you won't regret
  yours."</p>

  <p>Goldworthy's face suddenly emerged from the shadow? He drew Bet closely to
  him and smiled down tenderly into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," he whispered, "my other self, my alter ego, my own, dear
  wife."</p>

  <p>Bet slipped her arms about his neck.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear," she whispered. "I didn't know that there could be such
  perfect happiness as this."</p>

     name="ch9">IX. &mdash; BIG FISH</a></h2>

  <h3>Published under syndication in, e.g.,<br>
  <i>The Port Adelaide News</i>; Australia, May, 14, 1926</h3>

  <p class="first">HAD it not been that circumstances forced John Treherne to
  take his holidays very late that year he would never have gone to Cwmwyan at
  all. In the ordinary way he preferred to get away from the office in
  Lincoln's Inn Field in June or preferably, in May, for he was a mighty
  fisherman and could not resist the lure of the trout and the salmon.</p>

  <p>All that summer John's partner in the thriving legal firm of Clement &amp;
  Treherne had been away ill, and it was well into November before John was
  free to get away for any considerable time.</p>

  <p>It was too late for the little brown bird, and also for the outlying
  pheasants, and far too early for the big Christmas shoots. The salmon rivers
  were closed to anglers, and the trout streams were equally out of the
  question. But angling of some sort Treherne must have, and his choice settled
  eventually on Cwmwyan, and the mighty pike in the chain of miniature lakes
  there. In his younger days he had taken some fine fish there, and on one
  red-letter day a monster of eighteen pounds.</p>

  <p>Anyway, he would go to Cwmwyan and put up once more with Betty Rees,
  despite the fact that Miss Llewellyn would be in residence at the big house,
  and probably as antagonistic as ever to the man with whom she had quarrelled
  over the sacred subject of pike fishing, and who had taken his revenge over
  that matter of that right of way along the far bank of Cwm.</p>

  <p>It had been a trivial dispute to begin with. Ever since he could remember
  Treherne had been pike fishing at Cwmwyan without let or hindrance. He was
  perfectly aware that the left bank of the Cwm was the private water of old
  Lewis Llewellyn of the big house, but Llewellyn had been a recluse and had
  cared nothing about his fishing rights, so that anyone was welcome to troll
  for pike there so far as the lord of the manor was concerned. There was an
  ancient right of way along the left bank which had fallen into desuetude.</p>

  <p>After the old owner died, and Miss Llewellyn came into the property,
  things were very different. She was a distant relative of the late Llewellyn,
  and a lady who had passed most of her twenty-five years in India, where her
  father had been a commanding officer, and her ideas of the importance of the
  Llewellyns were out of all proportion to the size of the property and the
  revenues thereof. English people who spend much time in the East are apt to
  be like that.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt that Miss Gwen Llewellyn made herself very unpopular in
  the early days of her reign. She was an orphan when she came into the
  property, which may account for a lot. She had autocratic ideas which did not
  commend themselves to the fierce liberalism of the Welsh hillsmen among whom
  she now found herself, and in six months her unpopularity was complete. This
  was a source of much grief to her, for she meant well, despite her arrogance.
  She was an exceedingly pretty girl and would be charming when she forgot that
  she was the lady of a pinchbeck manor. Unfortunately she made the mistake of
  regarding the villagers and small tenants as she had viewed the natives in
  the compound at Jellalabad. This had been the cause of all the mischief.</p>

  <p>John Treherne had come to Cwmwyan one autumn for a week-end with the pike,
  and had arrived in the midst of the feud. Innocent of any trouble, he had
  crossed the river and cast his phantom minnow into the Llewellyn water under
  the eyes of its outraged mistress, who had immediately ordered him off as if
  he had been some vagabond poacher. Refusing to listen to one word of
  explanation, she had been exceedingly rude and personal, which is the way of
  angry young women. Treherne had retreated with a feeling of smallness that
  rankled. He was by no means blind to the beauty of his antagonist; but when,
  in addition, he was ordered off the footpath, which had been a right of way
  from time immemorial, he protested. He was informed with great haughtiness
  that the path was closed to foot traffic, that he was trespassing, and that
  if he offended again he would find himself forcibly removed.</p>

  <p>"Iss, sur, her be like that," old Betty Rees told Treherne, when he
  mentioned the matter to her after his early dinner in the cottage where he
  had his quarters. "A great lady whateffer, look you! But she's not so bad
  when you come to know her. She started wrong and we started wrong, and its
  never been put right sir. Wants a husband to manage her."</p>

  <p>"But surely you folks here are never going to sit still and have that path
  filched from you?" Treherne protested. "Why, it has been public property for
  ages!"</p>

  <p>"Pleases her and don't hurt us," Betty said placidly. "And you can catch
  all the fish you want from this side, sir."</p>

  <p>Treherne abandoned the unequal contest. This placid attitude was
  characteristic of the peasantry, and any attempt to stir them to a fight for
  their rights was so much beating of the air. Still, the autocrat with the
  shining hair of spun gold and the scornful violet eyes needed a lesson, and
  Treherne was minded to give her one.</p>

  <p>Single-handed he fought an action in the local County Court against the
  last of the Llewellyns and won hands down. This little encounter cost Miss
  Llewellyn over a hundred pounds she could ill afford, and her rage against
  the impudent intruder was bitter.</p>

  <p>The action had been fought two years ago, and the antagonists had not met
  since. Treherne had scarcely given the matter a further thought, but it was
  in his mind now as he travelled into Wales for his belated holiday and his
  campaign against the giant pike in the chain of miniature lakes that made up
  the Cwmwyan water. He would have much preferred to have spun his phantom
  minnow or live dice from both banks, but that was a mere midge in the amber,
  and if Miss Llewellyn was in residence it would be easy to avoid her. The
  weather was just right; it was crisp with a touch of frost in the air, and
  there had been much water down from the hills of late. With any sort of luck
  he ought to have a month of topping sport.</p>

  <p>"Well, Betty, how goes it?" he asked as he finished an excellent dinner in
  the snug cottage which had been his head-quarters for the last ten years, and
  where he had a cosy sitting-room and a bedroom redolent of thyme and
  lavender. "My fair enemy still about?"</p>

  <p>"Meaning Miss Llewellyn, whateffer?" Betty asked. "Iss, sure. And things
  is better that they used to be, look you! Ever since you lass take the law of
  her. She have not forgiven you, whateffer, Mr. Treherne; but as for the rest
  of us it is different. And she fish her water, look you, like a man, iss
  sure!"</p>

  <p>Treherne smiled broadly at the picture of that dainty wisp of haughty
  humanity manipulating a double-handed hickory rod and a live bait on the end
  of a hundred yards of silk line and gimp. He was still musing over the vision
  when he sauntered out after breakfast the following morning to inspect the
  river and wet his new lines. It was in fine condition, as he could see at a
  glance. A stream running bank high, but fine and clear, met his delighted
  gaze, and Miss Llewellyn was forgotten.</p>

  <p>Four miniature lakes, connected by narrow necks, reached back to the
  foothills over the purple shoulder of Gwyntor, whose mighty watershed fed the
  lakes.</p>

  <p>There were two miles of these lagoons ending some way below in a narrow
  gorge and a waterfall ten feet in height. Below that, again, the rapids had a
  fall of one foot in four, and a half a mile further down was a waterfall
  enclosed on either side by sheer black weed-covered rocks, forming a gorge in
  which anything that lived would have been drowned long before the cascade was
  reached. To plunge down between those granite walls would have been suicide.
  The strongest swimmer would not have lived there two minutes without
  artificial aid, and even if he had, the twenty-foot cascade at the end of the
  rapids would have provided the inevitable finish.</p>

  <p>At the head of the water-shoot before the rapids lay the giant fish. In
  the clear water Treherne could see a brace of the gaunt fresh-water harks
  lying still and motionless, with their long, wolfish heads up-stream, and now
  and again a lazy motion of fins that sent them darting as if they had been
  propelled by some unseen howitzer. These were the fathers of the
  lake&mdash;great brown fellows, long and lean and hungry, but wily as a fox,
  and almost as difficult to land as an elephant. If they broke away
  down-stream, as they did invariably, then the weight of surging water and the
  impetus of the heavy rush proved fatal to even the stoutest tackle, as
  Treherne knew to his cost many a time. It was a game of skill and strength on
  both sides, with long odds on the born fighter at the other end of the line.
  But Treherne was going to try.</p>

  <p>On the other side of the last miniature lake he was startled to see his
  fair enemy&mdash;a double split hickory rod in her small hand&mdash;making a
  cast with a silver minnow, and not a bad cast either.</p>

  <p>Treherne marked the slim, graceful figure, the dainty face and the haughty
  carriage of the head. She was as much the same as he had seen her last on the
  steps of the courthouse in the little Welsh town of Prestin, where the famous
  action over the right-of-way had been fought, and a certain sense of pity
  filled Treherne as he watched her. Well, she had learned something since
  then, if Betty Rees was to be believed! She had come to realise her
  responsibilities. Certainly the once disputed path across the river was no
  longer weed-grown, but clean and neat, with boundary stones along the
  edge.</p>

  <p>She saw Treherne, of course, but he might have been no more that one of
  the white clouds on the dappled sky. She stood poised on a big shelving rock
  not far from the edge of the lasher, just above the rapids, clean-cut against
  a background of leafless trees. A lovely picture, Treherne thought as he
  prepared his cast and laid out his tackle on the sloping bank. As his reel
  began to scream when the line was being drawn out and the heavy rod fitted
  for the fray, the figure opposite suddenly threw up her point and addressed
  him.</p>

  <p>"I shall be greatly obliged," Miss Llewellyn drawled in the iciest tones,
  "if you will be gentlemanly enough to take the next pool above. It is too
  much to expect perhaps, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She finished with a shrug of the slim shoulders and waited for her
  antagonist to wilt. The insinuation that she was treating him as a man of
  honour, even in these unpromising circumstances, brought a smile to
  Treherne's lips. She was clearly offering him the benefit of the doubt that
  did not linger in her own mind for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked. "There is ample room for both of us. As a matter of fact,
  I am only out this morning to wet a new line and test a patent swivel I have
  had recommended to me. I am sorry to have disturbed you."</p>

  <p>Rod in hand he passed up-stream smiling. So that was her little game, was
  it? She had heard of his coming and had stolen a march on him which would not
  be repeated. He would be first in the field next morning, even if he had to
  sit up all night. Pretty girl all the same, and looked rather lonely. Not
  much fun for her in that remote valley, with no congenial society and playing
  at being the lady of the manor on an inadequate income! Treherne knew all
  about that. Still, he was on a fishing holiday, and his time was too precious
  to be wasted by the caprices of a silly girl.</p>

  <p>He was down at the lower pool above the lasher betimes in the morning.
  There was no sign of the foe to be seen. With a phantom minnow of his own
  make he was busy almost at once. A long, wide, dexterous cast dropped on the
  face of the pool as gently as thistledown, and almost instantly a long,
  arrow-headed ripple and the thin, cutting wave over a brown fin showed the
  rush of a big one. The fish struck short and was away up-stream almost before
  Treherne realised that he had a rise.</p>

  <p>He made another wide cast with a ball of line in the hollow of his hand,
  like a master of the craft as he was, then suddenly something dropped in his
  swim with the flop of a frog, and a score of arrow heads proclaimed the fact
  that as many of the big fellows were off up stream, alarmed by the splash in
  their midst. On the other bank, posed perilously on the shelving, unstable
  rock on the edge of the lasher, stood the fair foe, obviously intent on
  casting in Treherne's water.</p>

  <p>Acknowledging his defeat by slightly raising his cap, Treherne wound up
  and, rod in hand ready for a cast on the next pool, moved slowly up the
  river. Ah well, it was only a woman, and an angry one at that, who would have
  been guilty of such unsportsmanlike conduct. Yet he taught her something.</p>

  <p>He held the rod short-lined in his right hand and the phantom in his left.
  A quarter of a mile higher up was another pool, where he might hook a big
  'un. At the bend he looked back to see how the enemy was progressing, just in
  time to see the shelving rock on which she stood tilt and almost before he
  realised what had happened Miss Gwen Llewellyn was struggling in six feet of
  water. And the rock on which she had been standing was no longer there! Half
  a minute later and the white figure in the close-fitting sweater and cheviot
  skirt had vanished over the lasher and was being carried rapidly down the
  broken waters to the waterfall below.</p>

  <p>Treherne raced back with his rod still in his hand. He carried it quite
  mechanically, and it was sheer instinct that caused him to keep the point
  upright. He knew that nothing short of a miracle could save the unfortunate
  girl now. She was in the grip of those cruel rapids, with a sheer wall of
  rock some thirty feet high on either side and a waterfall some twenty feet
  down at the end of the deadly passage. She would be carried over that to a
  mercifully sudden death below. There was no way of getting down to her,
  nothing he could throw in the shape of a buoy, and even if there had, it
  would have been useless. To plunge over that rocky rampart to her assistance
  would have been worse, it would merely have entailed the loss of two lives
  instead of one.</p>

  <p>But he must do something! He could not let her drown. And, yet, what?
  There was nobody in sight, and it was a mile to the nearest cottage. Nothing
  moved except a flock of frightened sheep that baa-ed noisily as Treherne sped
  past them. It was nothing to Treherne now that the doomed girl had paid the
  penalty of her own childish conceit in standing too far over that treacherous
  rock merely to show him that she could make a cast as far as his. He raced
  along breathlessly with the rod in his hand.</p>

  <p>He came up with her at length. So far she was uninjured. She had managed
  to steer clear of the jagged rocks under the surface of the rapids. But at
  any moment she might strike one of them beneath the treacherous smoothness
  and fracture a limb. So far she was holding her own, swimming deliberately
  and slowly, and holding back against the rush of waters. Her face was pale
  and set, but not so ghastly as the one that looked down on her from the
  ramparts above.</p>

  <p>"Please, please don't do it!" she said bravely, as she read a desperate
  resolve in Treherne's eyes. "So long as you are alive and up there I have a
  chance. If you come down here, we shall both be drowned."</p>

  <p>She was wonderful, thought Treherne; terribly afraid, no doubt, but she
  was not going to show it. If she had to die, then she would cross the
  borderland as a true Llewellyn should. It was no time for little things.
  There were no tears in her own eyes, but she could see them on Treherne's
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>"Is there nothing I can do for you?" he cried. "Nothing? Then I shall have
  to come down to you! If I don't I shall never be able to look a man in the
  face again!"</p>

  <p>"You must not," the girl commanded. "Something may happen yet. If we are
  both here&mdash;somebody with a rope may come. I can hold back a little if I
  turn and swim&mdash;and slowly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was all very fine, the tortured Treherne reflected. He stood there,
  miserably helpless, with the rod still in his hand. And as the girl in the
  water looked at him something like the inspiration he was feverishly praying
  for came to his mind in that strange way that, in times of stark peril, such
  inspiration does come.</p>

  <p>He had recalled a holiday in the Gulf of Florida&mdash;the great adventure
  of his fishing career&mdash;a whole gorgeous month when he was after the
  giant bass off Palm Beach&mdash;huge fellows running to four hundred pounds
  in weight and game to the last ounce, yet taken on a twelve-ounce rod and a
  three-ply line of cotton thread. It was a miracle in which Treherne had
  shared. Something never to be forgotten. Wonderful how the lightest hand,
  even that of a little child, can move heavy objects in live water. Like a
  tiny tug with a lumbering Dreadnought in its wake! He had seen a little girl
  guide a laden barge on the canal at Rochester. One could hold up almost any
  object that floated with a thread of hair! Heavens! If he had only had a ball
  of string in his pocket&mdash;or a spare line!</p>

  <p>Suddenly, with a flash, he was awake to the fact that he was still
  carrying the rod in his hand. He wondered how it got there. The rod, with a
  stout line and the six feet of gimp and the big triangle of hooks at the end
  of it! A great shout burst from his lips.</p>

  <p>"Got it!" he yelled. "It's a chance anyway. There's a bit of a shelf of
  rock sticking out just above the waterfall where I used to find the
  kingfisher's nest when I was a boy in these parts. I am going to guide you
  there Miss Llewellyn. I am going to play you like a fish that has broken
  down-stream. If you can endure it for half an hour&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I must," replied the girl bravely.</p>

  <p>Treherne wished he had been less hasty over that right-of-way affair.
  Silly to think of such things at such a tense moment, but there you were.</p>

  <p>"I will!" added Miss Llewellyn. "Only I wish&mdash;it was not&mdash;so
  cold!"</p>

  <p>Here was another peril that Treherne had not foreseen. There are limits to
  the endurance of even a Llewellyn! He blessed the foresight which had
  inspired Betty Rees to slip his flask into the sandwich case he always
  carried on these occasions. It was going to be touch-and-go in any case, and
  if the cold water proved too much for the struggling girl, he would have to
  suffer the agonies of defeat. And if the worst happened, what would the world
  say about him? That he had not risked anything to save the life of an
  unfortunate woman! He could imagine the paragraphs in the newspapers. A
  coward&mdash;no less!</p>

  <p>He swung the triangle, weighted with lead, across the narrow neck of the
  stream, and nursed it back with little dexterous turns of the wrist and
  liftings of the point of the rod. Then he worked the mass of weighted hooks
  cunningly in the girl's direction. He had his mind sternly concentrated on
  this to the exclusion of everything else. Inch by inch, nearer and nearer to
  the figure struggling in the water, he drew the mass of hooks until he had it
  just between the shoulders and high in the neck of the white sweater that
  Gwen Llewellyn was wearing. Then he lifted his point and struck.</p>

  <p>The tangle of hooks went home. They bit into the woolly surface and held
  tenaciously. With a fine feeling of uplift, Treherne set the reel of the rod
  going. He was not afraid of the hooks giving now; he was too fine a workman
  for that.</p>

  <p>As the line tightened Gwen's head came up, and the strain on her limbs
  slackened. All she had to do was to float gently and leave the rest to the
  man on the bank. She realised exactly what was in the back of his mind. He
  was playing her easily and dexterously as he would have played a big fish.
  With her head well out of the water now as the line grew taut she could cease
  to fight against the downward rush and allow her numbed limbs to relax.</p>

  <p>Her confidence in the man on the bank was increasing. It was exactly as
  Treherne hoped&mdash;the body in the water was as a featherweight under his
  practised hand. He had seen a three-hundred-pound bass come to the gaff as
  easily as this with a fisherman at the working end of the enterprise with a
  ten-ounce rod and a three-ply cotton line. He could have moved a barge with
  tackle such as he was using now.</p>

  <p>"Be calm!" he cried. "Courage! You are safe now if you only keep your
  head. Are you so very cold?"</p>

  <p>The girl looked up with a thin, wan courage, but the water was deadly cold
  and, despite her youth and virility, she was fast growing numb and chilled.
  But she was not going to give up; that was not the Llewellyn way.</p>

  <p>So they worked yard by yard down-stream, fighting every inch until the
  roar of the waterfall began to boom menacingly in Treherne's ears. He knew
  that it was here where the real stern fight would begin. Very, very gradually
  he worked his precious burden nearer to the bank at the foot of the precipice
  until he could see her immediately underneath. He had her presently just
  below a ledge of rock a foot or two above the level of the stream.</p>

  <p>The pull of the waterfall, which was not twenty yards away now, was
  beginning to tell; and when at length Treherne paused, his rod was bent in a
  bow and the girl below was lying almost flat on the surface with the tear of
  it.</p>

  <p>"It is nearly finished!" Treherne whispered in a voice tense with anxiety.
  "I am going to tie up here and come down to you."</p>

  <p>"Do&mdash;be careful!" gasped Miss Llewellyn. "If&mdash;anything happens
  to you now&mdash;we are both finished."</p>

  <p>Treherne proceeded to tighten the line as far as he dared and to attach it
  with a looped knot to the pronged horn of a pollarded willow standing on the
  bank. It was much as if he had a great pike on the hooks of a trimmer. When
  all was made secure he begun to make his way cautiously down the broken
  surface of the cliff until he reached the jutting ledge. Every fatal inch
  brought the heart into his mouth. One false step and there was an end to both
  of them!</p>

  <p>At last he was down. Very cautiously now, lest the hooks should give way,
  he reached for the taut line and drew it to the bank. A second later and he
  had a firm grip under the arms of the exhausted girl. He had saved her within
  a few yards of the waterfall. She was past thanking him.</p>

  <p>Without ceremony he stripped off her white sweater and cut the hooks free
  with the big blade of his fishing knife. Whipping off his heavy sports coat
  and cardigan he wrapped them about his almost unconscious burden. He filled
  the cup of his flask with a generous measure of raw whisky and forced her to
  drain it to the last drip. He felt her shudder in his arms and caught a faint
  dash of color in her cheeks. She smiled into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Come, that's better," he cried cheerfully. "Now if you are feeling up to
  it put your arms around my neck and I will carry you. <i>Festina lente</i>
  here, I think."</p>

  <p>It was accomplished at length. Not an heroic rescue after the best
  traditions of the sensational school of fiction, but an entirely new and
  ingenious one and equally satisfactory.</p>

  <p>"That was really clever and thoughtful of you!" Miss Llewellyn panted.
  "Not one man in a million would have dreamed of it. Only a fisherman could.
  Without you I should have drowned miserably. If you had plunged to save me
  from the consequences of my folly and idiotic conceit, you would have
  perished too. I knew that it was dangerous to stand on that stone, but I
  wanted to show you that I, too, could make a cast as long as yours, knowing
  all the while that I couldn't. And I&mdash;I was all wrong about that
  right-of-way, too&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was a pretty <i>amende</i> and one made with wet, pleading eyes, but
  Treherne cut her short.</p>

  <p>"None of that now!" he growled. "My task is to take you as far as old
  Betty's cottage, and you will have to run&mdash;run, mind you! Your own
  place! Not on your life. It's half a mile farther, and in a race with
  pneumonia, it is the yards that count. Come on!"</p>

  <p>Half dragging, half carrying her, Treherne began the memorable journey.
  When the cottage was reached Gwen Llewellyn was in a glow. But Treherne was
  not satisfied until he saw her seated in a nest of hot blankets before a
  roasting fire in his sitting-room and drink with some more spirit in it.
  Later on after a change of clothing had been fetched from the Manor House,
  Treherne accompanied her home and, at her earnest request, stayed to
  dinner.</p>

  <p>When they parted both were astonished to realise how far the new
  friendship had progressed.</p>

  <p>Gwen stood in the dimly lighted hall with her hand in that of her guest.
  Her eyes were shining in a way that Treherne had never seen before.</p>

  <p>"And you will show me how to catch the big fish to-morrow?" she asked.
  "But you will never catch a bigger one than you caught to-day, Mr.
  Treherne&mdash;or one that gave you so much trouble!"</p>

  <p>Treherne looked boldly into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Don't try and turn a mere fisherman into a hero," he said laughing. "And
  it's not so difficult to hook the big fish, the fish of one's
  dreams&mdash;the difficulty is to land them! And I haven't landed mine yet,
  Miss Llewellyn."</p>

  <p>"Haven't you?" she whispered. "If&mdash;but isn't there a whole month to
  talk about&mdash;about fish whatever?"</p>

  <p>Treherne was outside a moment later and the door was abruptly closed upon
  him. But the stars gave fine promise of good&mdash;fishing on the morrow.</p>

     name="ch10">X. &mdash; A CHRISTMAS IN PERIL</a></h2>

  <h3>Published under syndication in, e.g.,<br>
  <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, Launceston, Tasmania, December 18, 1926</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was an affectionate, almost family, farewell that Dick
  Fenton took of Mrs. Lee Watson and her daughter Clytie when he saw them off
  from Cape Town in the late summer. As a matter of fact, he had seen a good
  deal of that exceedingly pleasant lady and her only child during the time
  they had been pleasuring in South Africa. And he had diverted a great deal of
  his leisure to seeing that they properly enjoyed themselves. That leisure had
  been rather pronounced lately, because Fenton was leaving South Africa for
  good within a month or so of Christmas, and, indeed, he would have more than
  willingly accompanied his friends but for one or two outstanding matters that
  called for his personal attention.</p>

  <p>It would be his first visit home for ten years. He had gone out there more
  or less in his youth to build up the family fortunes, and had succeeded
  beyond his most sanguine expectations, so that, at the age of thirty-four, he
  was a rich man.</p>

  <p>Not that there was any particular lure for him at home, since he was one
  of a dwindling family, and now that his father was dead he would have been
  hard put to it to find a single relative left in the old country. Still, that
  didn't matter very much to a man whose ambition it was to settle down in the
  land of his birth, where he fully intended to purchase one of the fine, old
  sporting estates that so often came into the market, and live the life of a
  gentleman of leisure upon his own property. A stable of horses, some good
  shooting, and all that sort of thing.</p>

  <p>He had pictured within the background a vague image of some really nice
  girl. But that had been nebulous enough until fate had brought Clytie Watson
  into his life. And now, there was no longer any doubt as to who was to share
  the roseate picture he had conjured up and the more he saw of her, the more
  certain he was there could never be anybody else.</p>

  <p>That there was no obstacle in the way he had already ascertained; indeed,
  Mrs. Lee Watson, like the good mother that she was, had been at some pains to
  assure him on this point, because she liked Dick, who was a clean, manly sort
  of individual, and one of the products of an English public school. He had
  become, perhaps, a little raw and careless of his personal appearance during
  the years of the struggle for fortune, but a few months in the society of the
  Lee Watsons et hoc would soon rub that off.</p>

  <p>And so it was that the parting at Cape Town had come about in the most
  pleasing of circumstances.</p>

  <p>"Then you will be back before Christmas?" Mrs. Watson said, as she shook
  hands warmly. "And you will come and spend at least a month with us at
  Claygates Hall?"</p>

  <p>Dick murmured his gratitude. He wanted nothing better. He had heard enough
  about Claygates Hall to know that Claygates was one of those fine, old
  Elizabethan houses where the old tradition prevailed. He knew that it meant a
  big house party, with the usual Yuletide gaieties, and, even apart from
  Clytie, he would have accepted the invitation with alacrity.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he said heartily. "You have no idea how grateful I am to you
  for giving me this opportunity. After ten years in this part of the world I
  should simply love to find myself spending Christmas in one of England's
  ancestral homes."</p>

  <p>"That will be topping," Clytie said, a little shyly.</p>

  <p>Her hand lay in his for a fraction of a second longer than convention
  called for, and Dick was conscious of the warm pressure of the little, pink
  fingers. Also, he was almost dizzily aware of a certain light in a pair of
  sapphire eyes which had haunted him to the exclusion of everything else for
  some months.</p>

  <p>"I will be there," he said. "I will be there if I have to walk. But
  perhaps you wouldn't mind leaving the exact date open. There is a friend of
  mine, who was out here with me until fairly recently, who is going to be
  married somewhere about Christmas week, and if I am in London at the time, I
  must go. Indeed, Tony Bassett would be very much hurt if I didn't."</p>

  <p>"Tony Bassett," Mrs. Watson exclaimed. "Oh, yes, we know all about that.
  Didn't he come into a fortune?"</p>

  <p>"That's right," Dick laughed. "Some distant relative from whom he expected
  nothing. He bolted off home without even stopping to say good-bye to me, and
  I haven't heard a word from him since, except what I have gathered from the
  English newspapers. Of course, I knew that he was engaged."</p>

  <p>"Oh, we know the Bassett family quite well. Also, Vera Trent, the girl
  Tony is going to marry. We haven't had an invitation to the wedding, though I
  dare say we should have done if he had been at home. And now, Mr. Fenton, we
  really must say good-bye. You know our address, so there will be no excuse
  for you not writing to us directly we reach London, and fixing up the day for
  your visit."</p>

  <p>Fenton turned away at length, feeling that the world was a good place to
  live in, and that he was one of the most fortunate of men. His only regret
  was that he had not put his fortunes to the test before Mrs. Watson and her
  daughter left South Africa. Like most young men very much in love, he was
  lost in wonder that Clytie, with her beauty and fascination, had not been
  snapped up long ago. But these miracles are constantly happening. At any
  rate, it would not be Dick's fault unless he knew exactly where he stood
  before Christmas Day arrived. He would get to London now as soon as he
  possibly could and look up Tony Bassett.</p>

  <p>But December was half over before Dick found himself in the chilly
  atmosphere of the metropolis and more or less at home in the modest hotel to
  which he had been driven on his arrival. And then, after a quiet dinner and a
  pipe, he went down to the smoking room and took up a morning paper. Almost
  the first thing he saw there was a paragraph in the society news relating to
  the marriage of Tony Bassett and Vera Trent.</p>

  <p>With an exclamation of dismay, he saw that the happy event was fixed to
  take place in St. Olive's Church the following afternoon at half-past
  two.</p>

  <p>Here was a pretty state of affairs! He would have to be present, at any
  rate at the ceremony, and, no doubt afterwards at the reception given by the
  bride's uncle, Sir John Lester in Eccleston Square. And he hadn't a garment
  in the world fit for such an occasion. It was the kind of thing he had not
  troubled about until he had reached London, where he had intended to spare a
  few days in close confabulation with the family tailor. All he had in his
  trunks was a seedy morning suit, and in this he would, perforce, have to
  mingle with some of the cream of England's society. Nor could he get hold of
  Tony in the meantime, because he had not the remotest idea as to where that
  individual was to be found.</p>

  <p>"Well, there's no help for it," he told himself. "I shall have to make the
  best of it. They will probably take me for some shady chap after the wedding
  presents. By Jove, I haven't even got a card of invitation. Oh, well, I can
  send my name in to Tony, and I dare say it will be all right directly we
  meet."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">FOR eight and forty hours, subsequent to Dick's visit to St.
  Olive's and the marriage of his old friend, he had been seated moodily in a
  police cell in Holloway Gaol. Also, he had been charged before a distinctly
  unfriendly magistrate with entering certain premises in Eccleston Square and
  there unlawfully possessing himself of a certain diamond ornament, which had
  been found in his pocket by a detective employed to look after the wedding
  presents. At the end of the somewhat brief proceedings, he had been remanded
  for a fortnight for inquiries, and that was exactly how matters stood at the
  moment.</p>

  <p>He did not want to think too much of that exceedingly unpleasant scene in
  which he had been marched off, under the eyes of some two hundred guests, but
  he was essentially a man of action, and he had lost no time in getting at the
  fountain head. In other words, he had written a somewhat compelling letter to
  Sir John Lester, the uncle of the bride, and was now waiting for the next
  move on the part of that somewhat impulsive gentleman.</p>

  <p>But two further days elapsed before the cell door was opened, and a warder
  escorted two visitors into the narrow apartment in which the prisoner was
  confined. The elder of the two was a typical Englishman of the better
  sporting class, and the younger belonging to the same type, and unmistakably
  class. He gave one glance at the man in the cell, and then fell back in
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Dick," he cried. "What the devil?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, what the devil," Dick Fenton said. "This is a nice way to treat an
  old pal. I reach London just in time to attend your wedding, and I come on to
  the reception afterwards with a present in my pocket, expecting to find you
  cutting the cake and making speeches and all the rest of it. But not a sign
  of you, or the bride, either. Nothing but Babel and confusion. I suppose that
  is how I managed to slip in without being challenged. But not knowing a soul
  there, I pottered about looking for the presents, and all that sort of thing,
  and then found myself in the custody of a detective sort of chap who finds a
  South African blue diamond in my pocket. So, despite all my protests, they
  dragged me here and charged me with stealing one of the wedding presents.
  Stealing my own property, mind! Well, here I am, and unless you do something
  speedily, here I am likely to stay."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord," the man called Tony Bassett cried. "I wouldn't have had this
  happen for anything. And do you mean to say that you were present at my
  wedding?"</p>

  <p>"I was," Dick said grimly. "Just as I told you. And in the shabby suit and
  tired looking spats I am wearing at the present moment. If I had had time to
  visit Savile Row and get a proper rig out this could never have happened. But
  because we are such old pals, I came along in this scarecrow kit to Eccleston
  Square meaning to ask one of the servants to give me an opportunity of
  speaking to you, when, of course, everything would have been all right. And
  then, when that unlucky present was found in my pocket, everything was all
  wrong. I suppose that is why Sir John Lester here decided to give me into
  custody. At any rate, he might&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite, quite," the elderly gentleman said in confusion. "But, of
  course, I acted in good faith. I had no idea that my niece's husband had a
  friend called Fenton. And when I got your letter two days ago, I immediately
  cabled to the South of France for this,&mdash;this idiotic young bridegroom
  and brought him back hot foot from his honeymoon. And serve him right."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am afraid it's true, Dick," Tony Bassett confessed. "Look here,
  Sir John, Dick Fenton is a very old pal of mine. We were together in South
  Africa for years, and when I came into my money and made a dash for home and
  Vera, I asked Dick to come to the wedding. And as he was on the point of
  retiring from business, I hoped he would be back in time. And I'm dashed if
  he wasn't."</p>

  <p>"I assure you that I wouldn't have had this happen for worlds," Sir John
  said. "Tony is entirely to blame. The way he upset the household on the day
  of his marriage was unpardonable."</p>

  <p>"But what happened?" Dick asked.</p>

  <p>Sir John majestically indicated the culprit by his side.</p>

  <p>"Ask him," he said. "Ask him."</p>

  <p>"Really, I am awfully sorry, old chap," Bassett said contritely. "You see,
  it was a little joke that Vera and I put up between us. We never wanted to
  have all that fuss over our wedding. Our idea was to slip quietly off to a
  registry office and get spliced on the sly, just like all the nuts are doing
  now-a-days. You know what I mean 'Society romance,' and all that sort of
  thing. Portrait of the bride, badly done and about a column of descriptive
  matter. See the idea? But what I really funked most was cutting the cake and
  the infernal speech-making afterwards. So when we got back, Vera sneaked up
  to her bedroom and changed, and I bunked into a room and climbed into my
  sports suit, and we sort of eloped by the back way in my two seater and got
  off on our own, without telling a soul where we were going. We didn't even
  travel to the house in the country which a pal had placed at our disposal. A
  bit rough on the villagers, with their arches and flags; but there you are,
  there's no use apologising. So we quietly sloped off to the South, and Vera
  sent Sir John here her address on a post card. We had hardly settled down to
  humdrum married life before I got a telegram from Sir John that made me sit
  up and purr. So I came back actually leaving Vera behind me to see what all
  the trouble was about. And upon my soul, old chap, it's dashed funny, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, very," Fenton said drily. "My name in all the papers. Three days in a
  cell like this and the prospect of coming before magistrates again in the
  course of a week or so. Perhaps I shall be able to see the humor of it later
  on, but, for the present&mdash;yet, perhaps, I am not altogether blameless. I
  ought not to have gone to Eccleston Square at all in this mouldy old kit. But
  I didn't think that the mere fact that I was going to give you a wedding
  present would be the means if making me into a criminal."</p>

  <p>"Oh, criminal be hanged," Bassett cried. "'Pon my word, old chap I hardly
  know what to say about it. You see that little stunt of mine was quite
  innocent, though I admit it was a silly trick to do. And now, Sir John, what
  about it?"</p>

  <p>"You are not blaming me, I hope," Lester said, a little stiffly.</p>

  <p>"Well, to a certain extent I am," Bassett went on. "You gave poor old Dick
  into custody. You, it was, who wouldn't listen to a single explanation, and
  you it was who refused to believe my old friend when he said that that
  diamond was his offering to the bride. Dash it all, you might have given him
  the benefit of the doubt. I mean, you could have had him watched and all that
  sort of thing whilst you sent for me. I suppose he told you he was a friend
  of mine?"</p>

  <p>"That," Sir John said uncomfortably, "I am bound to admit. I did not
  believe him. And that fool of a detective said he was quite sure he had seen
  Mr. Fenton's face before."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Tony said impatiently, "but what about it?"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Sir John asked. "Do you suggest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Suggest nothing. Look here, this thing has got to be stopped. Poor old
  Dick can't stay here another hour. And he can't go before magistrates again,
  either. What's the good of your being Lord Lieutenant of your county if you
  can't pull a string or two? You know the Home Secretary and all those legal
  nuts, don't you?"</p>

  <p>Sir John Lester admitted that he did.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," Tony went on. "Let's take a taxi and go off at once to
  the Home Office and set the ball rolling. What's become of that blue diamond,
  by the way?"</p>

  <p>Sir John was understood to say that it had been packed away with the rest
  of the wedding presents, and was at the bank.</p>

  <p>"Well, there you are, then. Nobody else sent a blue diamond solitaire, and
  I know that nothing else was missing or we should have heard about it. Now,
  come on, let's get down to the Home Office and explain the whole thing. Tell
  the chaps there that it has been a ghastly mistake and that you are entirely
  to blame. By Gad, if old Dick was a different sort of man, he'd bring an
  action against you and recover heavy damages."</p>

  <p>"I am not in the least likely to do that," Dick smiled. "Nor am I blaming
  Sir John at all. You are the culprit, Tony, and don't you forget it. And
  that's about all there is to be said."</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was quite late in the evening before Dick found himself
  free to go his own way and returned to his hotel, comforting himself as best
  he could with the knowledge that to-morrow's papers would see him publicly
  exonerated from the ridiculous charge which had been made against him. He was
  still feeling very sore and angry, though logically there was no one to whom
  he could attach any particular blame. It was all very well to read in the
  papers the following morning the story which had been sent out to the Press,
  which pungent incident had been made the most of by certain of the cheaper
  papers with headlines all across the page. So that, altogether, Dick was very
  far from seeing ahead of him the Christmas that he had so delightfully
  anticipated on his way home from the Cape.</p>

  <p>Nor, in the circumstances, did he feel disposed to communicate with Mrs.
  Lee Watson. There was, of course, no reason why he should not, but a certain
  shyness held him back. Besides, if there was one thing he hated more than
  another, it was publicity. He would go as far as Savile Row and replenish his
  wardrobe, after which he would set about the purchase of his Christmas
  presents. At any rate, he need not be shy of sending these to the ladies of
  Claygates Hall. That he could do.</p>

  <p>It was a fine, crisp morning when he set out on his errand, and the
  streets were crowded with shoppers. And then, presently, in one of the big
  emporiums in Oxford-street he ran in Clytie Watson. There was absolutely no
  avoiding recognition.</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a startled expression on her face.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. Fenton, oh!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Dick was quick enough to appreciate what was passing in her mind. It was
  quite evident she had read of his trouble which the society paragraphs in the
  papers had made the most of, and the sequel.</p>

  <p>"You didn't expect to see me here," he said as coolly as possible. "I
  wonder if you would like to hear what I have to say."</p>

  <p>"Of course I should," Clytie said, warmly, at the same time looking at him
  with something more than pity in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Then perhaps, if we had a little lunch together&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well, why not?" Clytie asked. "I am in Town for a day or two shopping
  with my mother, and she has gone off to the Ritz to see some friends. And,
  oh, I don't believe a word of it."</p>

  <p>"You don't believe that I am&mdash;I am&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Guilty of that ridiculous business? Of course not. Do let's go somewhere
  where we can talk about it quietly."</p>

  <p>And so it came about, half an hour later, that they were sitting at a
  secluded little table in the corner of the dining-room of a West-End hotel,
  with Clytie listening eagerly to the story that Dick had to tell. When he had
  finished, her face was flushed and rosy and there was more than a suspicion
  of tears in her eyes. Then she laughed wholeheartedly, like a child that is
  pleased.</p>

  <p>"What an extraordinary thing," she said. "When I read the first account in
  the papers, I didn't know what to think. But, mind you, I didn't think for a
  moment that you could possibly have done anything wrong. And my mother agreed
  with me. And you say it's all in this mornings papers. Well, I'm rather glad
  I didn't see it. I wonder if you can guess why?"</p>

  <p>"Give it up," Dick said rather briefly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, how silly of you! Don't you see it's because I am able to meet you
  like this and shake hands with you before I heard the explanation? Now, you
  will never be able to think that I had the slightest doubt about you. You
  must take me back to our hotel so that we can have tea with mother, and if
  you can arrange to come down to Claygates with us to-morrow it would be
  lovely."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I can't come to-morrow," Dick said audaciously. "You see I
  must stay in town a few days until my wardrobe is replenished. And I haven't
  even a decent dress suit. And in any case, I am afraid I could only come down
  to Claygates on one condition. I wonder if you can guess what that is,
  Clytie."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I can, Dick," the girl said demurely.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well, I think we understand one another. It wouldn't be a really
  happy Christmas to me unless I could&mdash;er&mdash;kiss you under the
  mistletoe. And I, I don't mean as a matter of custom but as a right. Am I
  presuming too far Clytie?"</p>

  <p>She looked into his face, her eyes sparkling gaily.</p>

  <p>"Won't you come down and see?" she asked.</p>

  <p>And Dick said, in a matter of fact sure enough that it was good enough for
  him. Just for a moment he regretted that the conventions, to say nothing that
  the crowd about him, prevented him from advertising his reply in a more
  emphatic manner.</p>

  <p>"I'll come down on the 21st," he said. "I can't possibly manage it
  earlier, and you shall meet me with the car at the station and the next day
  we'll go out in the woods and cut the Yule log together. I can do pretty well
  everything with an axe, and I have been longing for years to spend an English
  Christmas and help to bring in the Yule log. And, I say, Clytie, you might
  lend me that little ruby ring of yours."</p>

  <p>"What do you want it for?" Clytie murmured.</p>

  <p>"Just as if you couldn't guess. When I give it to you back, I will give
  you another one as well&mdash;diamonds and pearls, eh?"</p>

  <p>And so, in due course, the Yule log was cut and carried, and Dick and
  Clytie sat down to the enjoyment of the most perfect Christmas dinner that
  either ever remembered, and on Clytie's left hand was a ring of pearls and
  diamonds of which she seemed to be inordinately proud.</p>

     name="ch11">XI. &mdash; THE EGG OF THE LITTLE AUK</a></h2>

  <h3>Published under syndication in, e.g.,<br>
  <i>The Saturday Journal</i>, Adelaide, Australia, February 26, 1927</h3>

  <p class="first">SIR JOSEPH BOSLEY, Bart., of Garton Street and eke Marley
  Grange, in the County of Kent, and some time of the diplomatic service, was
  taking one of his morning ambles in the direction of Campden Hill prior to an
  hour at his club, the Senior Forum. He was a most amiable old gentleman,
  beautifully spatted and upholstered, rosy as the sunny side of a pippin, and
  exuding bland amiability from every pore of his clean little body. That he
  was spoken of in his club as a man breaking up fast and a victim of senile
  decay troubled him not at all, for the simple reason that he did not know it;
  but he was vague and absent-minded to a degree, and accordingly a mark for
  all the artists in the craft of "tale pitching" within a mile of his town
  residence. He wore no watch for the simple reason that on one occasion a
  predatory craftsman had by chance fenced for an opening towards the "tale" by
  asking if Sir Joseph would kindly "give him the time," whereupon he had found
  himself presented with a quite valuable watch in Sir Joseph's best
  mental-dementia manner, since when his daughter Patricia had made it her
  business to see that he carried no timepiece.</p>

  <p>He doddered on at peace with all mankind until he reached the gates of
  Eversdene House, the property of Lord Eversdene, a nobleman with whom he was
  not on particularly good terms owing to some rather ridiculous dispute over a
  boundary fence down in Kent, which ran between the properties of the
  respective protagonists, a dispute that caused a great deal of uneasiness to
  his lordship's heir and nephew, Kenyon Waldron, and Sir Joseph's daughter
  Patricia. Not that there had been any open rupture, but Lord Eversdene had
  made unpleasant remarks on the budding romance, and had hinted at all sorts
  of things if his successor married into a family showing symptoms of
  congenital insanity. He could not will away the title or the Kent property,
  but he could otherwise dispose of the bulky fortune he had inherited from his
  late spouse; and therefore, it behoved young Kenyon, like Agag, to walk
  delicately.</p>

  <p>But nothing of this was disturbing the pink serenity or Sir Joseph as he
  paused before the big iron gates. The sudden sight of a placard bearing the
  legend "On View" brought him up all standing, and the recollection that his
  lordship was disposing of the property in response to a tempting offer from a
  firm of speculative builders slowly trickled through the grey matter of his
  absent-mindedness. In the course of a week or two everything in the house
  would be sold; meanwhile intended purchasers were free to inspect the goods
  by ticket, which fact did not deter Sir Joseph from passing beyond the iron
  gates. A policeman, recognising a distinguished local inhabitant, touched his
  helmet, and Sir Joseph passed on into the house.</p>

  <p>It was all quite familiar, just as it had been in the old days before the
  unfortunate misunderstanding about the boundary fence. A few people of the
  better class wandered more or less aimlessly round with catalogues in their
  hands. In an inner room Sir Joseph found himself presently bending
  attentively over a small collection of curios spread out on long tables
  supported by trestles. On these he browsed ruminatively until his absent eye
  lighted upon a small brass box, in which was an oval object packed in cotton
  wool, and held in place by little points of india-rubber. It might have been
  a remarkably fine specimen of the ova of the common or garden hen mottled and
  splashed in some idle moment, but inside the lid a label neatly printed
  proclaimed the fact that here was the egg of that extinct fowl the Little
  Auk, and that the specimen in question had been captured in the year 1851
  somewhere in the Hebrides.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Remarkable! So it is!" Sir Joseph muttered. "Used to collect birds'
  eggs myself when a boy. Remember reading about the Little Auk. Worth 100,
  perhaps more. Dear me."</p>

  <p>He placed the specimen down on the edge of the table and ambled away
  oblivious to the fact that the box had slipped to the floor and, falling, the
  lid had closed. One of those fussy strangers who appear to be ubiquitous at
  such gatherings hurried after Sir Joseph with the box in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, sir," he said, "but I think you have dropped something. It
  seemed to fall from your pocket."</p>

  <p>"Eh, bless my soul, did it?" Sir Joseph cried. "Very likely, very likely,
  always dropping things from my pocket. Must have done it pulling out my
  handkerchief. Very kind of you, sir."</p>

  <p>In his dreamiest fashion Sir Joseph thrust the brass box under the tails
  of his immaculate morning coat and passed on. That he was stealing a
  curiosity of value and rarity he did not realize for a moment. He had already
  forgotten that there was such a thing as a Little Auk's egg on the face of
  creation.</p>

  <p>He wandered on in a misty, kindly world of his own until, without in the
  least knowing how he got there, he arrived at his club and pottered into the
  reading room. The room was almost empty, but fortunately <i>The Times</i> was
  disengaged. Sir Joseph grabbed it and sank into the depths of a big armchair.
  The brass box in the coat tail pocket made its presence felt. Sir Joseph sat
  up with a jolt and proceeded to remove the offending object, which he placed
  on the table by his side.</p>

  <p>"Now how on earth did that get there?" he murmured. "And where did it come
  from. However??"</p>

  <p>With that he forgot the strange incident altogether. He was walking off
  presently, suddenly conscious of a desire for lunch, when a fellow clubman
  who had watched the whole incident came after him with a humorous smile on
  his face and the brass box in his hand.</p>

  <p>"A small present for you, Bosley," he said. "I had intended giving it you
  for some little time. An egg the Little Auk. As an old collector of birds'
  eggs perhaps??"</p>

  <p>Sir Joseph rose just as the licensed club joker imagined he would, knowing
  the other's absent-mindedness.</p>

  <p>"Now that is kind of you, Jorkins, very kind," Sir Joseph cried excitedly.
  "A Little Auk's egg. Really! Funny, but I seem to have seen another one quite
  recently. I wonder where."</p>

  <p>"South Kensington, probably," Jorkins said solemnly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, of course, of course, though I don't remember being there for years.
  Memory, Jorkins, memory. What a blessing it is."</p>

  <p>The romance of the Little Auk's egg would probably have ended there and
  then save as a club joke but for the fact that for the second time the
  flattered recipient placed it in his coat tail pocket and once again it made
  its presence felt as Sir Joseph sat down to lunch with his daughter Patricia.
  That highly desirable divinity in pink and white with the eyes of heavenly
  blue and the charming dimples in her peach-like cheeks was none the less
  dutiful a child because she knew her father and his little ways, and when he
  started with a painful "ouch" and dived into his pocket to produce the little
  brass box she quietly waited developments.</p>

  <p>"What is that and where did you get it from?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Sir Joseph stared at the box with the air of a man suddenly confronted
  with the evidence of a crime.</p>

  <p>"Now, where did I get it from?" he asked himself vaguely. "My dear child,
  I haven't the faintest? Oh, yes, of course, how stupid I am. Do you know,
  Pat, there are times when I begin to fear that my memory is not all it was;
  in fact??"</p>

  <p>"Where did you get it from?" Patricia asked inflexibly.</p>

  <p>Sir Joseph's eye beamed on her with mild innocence and no consciousness of
  a hairsbreath from the paths of rectitude. Like most men of his type, he
  could be rashly obstinate at times, witness the tragedy of the boundary fence
  in which he was utterly in the wrong, and all the more obdurate in
  consequence. He was in the habit of coming home with these unconsidered
  trifles, and much diplomacy was needed to avoid scandalous consequences.</p>

  <p>"I was just going to tell you," he said. "Jorkins gave it to me in the
  club. An egg of that extinct bird the Little Dodo. No, the Great Auk. Ticha,
  Little Auk. Most valuable curio, and just the thing for my museum."</p>

  <p>In the the back drawing room Sir Joseph had a collection of nice-looking
  rubbish which he was pleased to call his museum, but beyond a set of Apostle
  spoons of dubious antiquity the rest was beneath contempt. And even those
  species he would have entirely forgotten long since save for the fact that he
  was in daily contact with them. He knew that his name was Bosley and that he
  was a baronet, because his equals and dependants frequently reminded him of
  the fact, and he was aware of the fact that he was a landowner with a
  respectable rent roll, since he employed a secretary who did not allow him to
  forget, but in all probability within a week, if any one asked him a question
  about Little Auks' eggs, he would have enquired what a Little Auk was.
  Patricia, however, was interested in the dusky shell and its brief biography,
  and it was she who placed it in the litter of rubbish that constituted the
  museum. All the same, she was not altogether easy in her mind, and she
  mentioned the subject to Kenyon Waldron when he dropped in for tea two days
  later.</p>

  <p>"Dad has added to his museum," she smiled. "It was given him by a man
  called Jorkins at the Forum Club."</p>

  <p>The fortunate youth with the adoring eyes and perfectly creased trousers
  pricked up his ears. As a member of the Forum himself, he knew something of
  the sporting qualities of the club jester, so he waited with a certain
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>"Something quite fresh, darling," Pat beamed. "The egg of an extinct bird
  called the Little Auk."</p>

  <p>"What!"</p>

  <p>Kenyon Waldron jumped to his feet with a yell.</p>

  <p>"Ken!" Patricia cried. "If there is a nail in that chair??"</p>

  <p>"Nail be hanged! I beg your pardon, darling, but this is a serious matter.
  Fact is, the day before yesterday the very thing you mention was missed from
  a sort of collection in Eversdene House, and no trace of it can be found. The
  contents of the mansion are on view, as you know, and I am more or less
  supposed to be looking after things, as my uncle is in Paris. Fact is, he
  hated to part with the place after all these centuries, and went to Paris to
  be out of the way until the sale of the furniture was over. But an egg of the
  Little Auk is missing, and the matter was put into the hands of the police
  yesterday. Nothing public, of course, but I feel it in my bones that Sir
  Joseph is at the bottom of it."</p>

  <p>"You think that he sto&mdash;took it, dear?"</p>

  <p>"'Fraid so. Thing's, unique, you know. None in existence outside museums.
  What infernal luck, darling. That dad of yours must have pottered into the
  house, attracted by the notice of the private view, and in one of his absent
  fits put the egg into his pocket. Where that funny ass Jorkins comes in
  dashed if I can see. I'll go round to the club presently and pump him
  cautiously. But, anyhow, if this gets to the ears of my uncle it will be all
  over so far as we are concerned. Let's have a look at the thing."</p>

  <p>It needed no more than a glance to convince Waldron that the little brass
  box contained the missing treasure.</p>

  <p>"Now what on earth's to be done," he asked forlornly.</p>

  <p>"It's dreadful," Patricia sighed. "Of course, you might take the egg away
  with you, but dad is sure to miss it, at any rate, for the next week or two,
  before he forgets all about it, and there would be a great fuss and the
  servants would be suspected. Dad can be quite nasty when the mood is on him,
  and I hate the idea of having to tell, well, downright lies to him. And if he
  was told what he had done pointblank, it would break his heart. He would
  never get over it. He hasn't the least idea that he does these sort of
  things, and the truth would prevent his ever appearing in public again. Is it
  possible that that horrid Mr. Jorkins was playing a practical joke on dad? A
  man with a name like that might."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jorkins is by no means a bad chap," Kenyon said, judicially.
  "However, I shall have to see him in the matter. If I go now I shall probably
  catch him before he starts his afternoon bridge. If I do, I will come back at
  once."</p>

  <p>As luck would have it, the genial joker was still full of his little
  <i>jeu d'esprit,</i> and Waldron was able to get full particulars without
  having to ask for them. He returned presently to the beloved object in a
  properly chastened frame of mind.</p>

  <p>"So that's that," he said, moodily. "Dashed if I know what to do. We must
  restore the egg somehow before my uncle comes back, or Lord knows what will
  happen. And I'd hate Sir Joseph to suffer; also, I'd hate for you to have to
  tell him a lot of lies. At the end of a week, according to what you say, the
  dear old man would forget he ever had the egg if it disappeared in a way that
  seemed natural. There must be some way, Pat, dear."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't see one," Pat said, despairingly, "unless some
  providential burglar comes along and clears out the museum. Ken! Oh, Ken! Why
  shouldn't we have a burglary here?"</p>

  <p>"What, a real one?" Waldron cried. "Do you know any burglars who would
  take the job on with a commission? Got one on your visiting list, by any
  chance?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be absurd." Patricia flashed a glorious April smile behind
  something suspiciously like tears. "But what about your friend Roger
  Pennington, the novelist? He knows all sorts of queer people. His last book
  was all about that class. And didn't he have a burglar in his section when he
  was serving in France?"</p>

  <p>"True, oh queen," Waldron said. "But if we take on this mad stunt
  Pennington will have to be told the truth."</p>

  <p>"Well, why not? Roger Pennington is a gentleman, and one of ourselves.
  Don't you see that there is no other way, Ken, darling."</p>

  <p>Now youth is ever sanguine and ever daring, and not over prone to discount
  the tricks of fate. Moreover, the virus of adventure is as quicksilver in its
  veins.</p>

  <p>"It would be rather a lark," Waldron said with enthusiasm. "Anyway, I'll
  see Pennington and ask him."</p>

  <p>That somewhat erratic genius Roger Pennington was a scion of the older
  nobility who had developed an intellect, to the utter astonishment of his
  progenitors, so instead of going into the church and propping up a family
  living or starving genteelly in the army, he had adopted the profession of a
  novelist and done exceedingly well at it with his works of pathos and humour
  depicting the lives as lived in the underworld. A brief hiatus between
  1914-18 had seen him elsewhere in a humble capacity as a section commander,
  and he held that the time had not been wasted. Now he was back again in
  London, where he had picked up the broken threads, and his novels were
  selling by the thousand. He spent a great part of his time in lodgings down
  Wapping way, where he had a room, and mixed freely with the proletariat in
  picturesque rags; and, when not engaged in that congenial occupation, he
  pervaded a flat in Pont street, and it was here that Waldron ran him to
  earth.</p>

  <p>He listened to the tale of woe languidly at first; then he threw off his
  inertia and proclaimed the fact that he could see a dashed fine short story
  in the offing. Also, he was quite prepared to take a hand in the
  adventure.</p>

  <p>"I've got the very man you want," he said eagerly. "Chap named
  Spragster&mdash;Reuben Spragster. Once a burglar, and a jolly good burglar,
  too. He's out of business now, and, I believe, in a regular job, though I
  haven't seen him for months. He was in my section over yonder, and I had lots
  of yarns with him, and he provided me with no end of stunning 'copy.' When
  the shindy was over I persuaded him to drop what he called 'the aside game'
  and try a little honesty. But if he knew that this was a put-up job requiring
  an appearance of the genuine artist at work involving no risks, I fancy he
  would take it on for a tenner. I'll see Spragster if you like."</p>

  <p>Waldron assented with marked enthusiasm. Mr. Reuben Spragster was found by
  Pennington after a long search evidently suffering from severe commercial
  depression. He had been out of a (sanguinary) job for five weeks and was
  seriously thinking of going back to the old love if only to keep him on the
  sunny side of the workhouse.</p>

  <p>There was nothing of the Cockney about Spragster. He was a little red man
  with a west-country accent and in the happy past he had been assistant to a
  father who lived in a fashionable village of the old thatched type, where the
  progenitor had made for a long time a handsome living selling spurious
  antique furniture to guileless tourists, mostly of transatlantic extraction.
  A particularly bold forgery on the grand scale had resulted in a prosecution,
  and Spragster pere had paid a penalty which occupied him five years, so that
  the once flourishing business wilted, and Reuben Spragster drifted to London,
  and there fell into evil courses. His line was antiques, particularly old
  silver, of which he possessed a considerable knowledge, and, moreover, he
  knew where to dispose of it.</p>

  <p>"I'm broke to the wide, Guvnor, I mean Captain," he explained. "There
  ain't no bouquets in this 'ere straight path as you put me an to, and if a
  cully 'adn't offered me a sort of shop in New York I'd been back at the old
  game again. However, if you got somethin' on as 'ul 'elp in the pasage money,
  chuck it off yer chest."</p>

  <p>"These are bad times for all of us," Pennington said. "Even we authors are
  reduced to taking in one another's ideas, the same as a certain community was
  supposed to support existence by taking in each other's washing."</p>

  <p>"Like them there politicians," Spragster grinned, "alias stealin' the
  policy of the other side."</p>

  <p>"Assimilate, I think, is the proper word," Pennington delicately
  suggested. "It sounds so much better." Spragster grinned his appreciation of
  the point, for he was a whimsical rascal. "I gather, Cpl. Spragster, that you
  need money, and, moreover, are not daintily particular how you get it."</p>

  <p>Almost passionately Spragster assured his visitor that he had not
  exaggerated the case. But now that it came to the point Pennington hesitated.
  He was not quite to sure that this <i>jeu d'esprit</i> was going to make the
  ripping story he had anticipated. In the first place, he had to guarantee
  Spragster immunity, and, if matters did go wrong, he couldn't see how he was
  going to do that without a public explanation, in which case an unfeeling
  press would have the humorous story and not the chief
  propagandist&mdash;himself. A flaming article, entitled, for instance,
  "Strange Conduct of a Novelist," did not make a strong appeal to him, and for
  the first time he was regretting that he had not devoted his ingenious mind
  to a solution of the problem in some fashion that did not involve this
  attempt to sap the comparatively tender morality of a converted burglar. But,
  on the other hand, the thing was pressing, and if the fateful egg was not in
  its place before Lord Eversdene returned from Paris two lives would be
  wrecked. Moreover, Pennington had made rather a careful study of Sir Joseph
  Bosley and his little ways, and if the egg had simply been removed by Waldron
  or his inamorata a wholesale sacking of the servants would probably follow,
  for Sir Joseph was given to those impulsive outbreaks which is the way with
  mild absent-minded people sometimes. But if was too late to draw back now,
  and Pennington proceeded to unfold the story.</p>

  <p>"Twenty pounds," he said. "That is the sum we can give you. In the back
  drawing room of Sir Joseph Bosley's house, in Garton street, Kensington, you
  will find a little box containing a bird's egg. 'Only that and nothing more,'
  as the poet says. That you will procure and leave at my rooms the same day,
  when I shall hand you what is picturesquely called the boodle. The number of
  the house is 16. Everything will be made as easy as possible for you, and you
  will find the area door none too secure. But you must give the thing an
  artistic finish, so that if the police are called in by any chance they will
  regard it as the work of a professional. You see it's a sort of practical
  joke, and if you do get into trouble I shall be prepared to come forward and
  speak for you. What do you say to tackling the job to-morrow night?"</p>

  <p>"Guvnor," Spragster said, almost tearfully, "I'm on."</p>

  <p>Sir Joseph sat on the side of his bed ruminating in that rambling way of
  his instead of getting into bed and sleeping like any other old gentleman
  with a clear conscience and the solid respect of his bankers. A wandering
  mind like his rarely concentrated on any disturbing subject did not call for
  such sleep, and therefore ruminating in his bedroom for hours after the
  household had retired had become a fixed habit known to nobody but
  himself.</p>

  <p>At 1 o'clock he was still sitting there with the egg of the Little Auk
  uppermost in what was by courtesy his mind. He was quite vaguely aware as to
  where he was, then, by some queer mental process he became aware of his bed
  and proceeded to rise and brush his teeth. The sudden jolt of the brush on a
  gum where undoubtedly a tooth ought to have been brought him to a certain
  degree of coherent consciousness. The molar with its gold plate was missing.
  Most assuredly that specimen of dental artistry had been performing its
  accustomed function at dinner time or Sir Joseph would have known it. But
  what had become of it? Annoying, most annoying.</p>

  <p>Sir Joseph proceeded to put a powerful strain on his memory. It was
  painful, but the thing had to be done. Then the inspiration came. He had been
  sitting in the inner drawing-room pottering over his treasures when he had
  noticed a sort of swelling in the region of the gums behind the gold plate.
  He had removed the impediment and placed it on a table where it lay entirely
  forgotten.</p>

  <p>"Must go and get it, go and get it," Sir Joseph muttered. "Not a nice
  thing for the servants to find in the morning."</p>

  <p>He crept quietly down the stairs in his bedroom slippers and felt his way
  into the drawing-room with the ease of a man who knows his way in the dark.
  The door of the inner room was ajar and from it came a long slit of light. As
  if this were quite a customary thing at an hour when the household slept, Sir
  Joseph pushed his way in. He saw a small figure with a flaming mop of hair
  bending over the large table which held what Sir Joseph called his treasures,
  and in the act of slipping something in his pocket. The brass box containing
  the precious egg was not to be seen. But Sir Joseph was not interested in
  that. He was wondering who this man was and what the dickens he was doing
  there.</p>

  <p>"My good fellow," he said, blandly, "what is the meaning of this
  unexpected visit? Surely you are in the wrong house. Unless, perhaps it is
  the telephones. But you don't look like telephones."</p>

  <p>Reuben Spragster said something lurid under his breath. This most
  emphatically was not what he had expected in the way of treatment. The
  ingress had been easy enough and the subsequent progress to the drawing-room
  presented no difficulties, but he had not been prepared to encounter one who
  obviously was the master of the house in the initial, or indeed any other,
  stage of the proceedings. Still, the idea of a "plant" was out of the
  question, and Spragster, conscious of the strength of the position, began to
  see his way. He was a humorous rascal and the situation had possibilities.
  Moreover "mug" was written in large letters all over the little mild-eyed
  gentleman in the striped silk pyjamas.</p>

  <p>"I'm a bit of a collector like yourself, guvnor," he said. "Born and bred
  to it like my father, only we used to sell what we found. Poor lot of stuff
  you got 'ere."</p>

  <p>"Bless my soul," Sir Joseph cried, "you're a burglar."</p>

  <p>He appeared quite pleased with his own astuteness.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that I shall have to hand you over to the police," he went on.
  "Bless my soul, I never had occasion to do anything of the kind before.
  Regrettable, most regrettable. Ah!"</p>

  <p>He gave a gasp of relief as he noted the missing molar and, making a dart,
  placed it in his mouth. Spragster began to understand the reason for this
  unfortunate interruption. Nice thing for people to go shedding their teeth
  about in this fashion. Still, there might be something to be made out of this
  amiable lunatic with proper handling. And Spragster was the man to do it.</p>

  <p>"I ain't a burglar in the proper way of speakin'," he said, whiningly.
  "You see it's like this, sir. My father, before he got himself into trouble,
  was a dealer in antiques. A fine judge he were and loved them things as if
  they were his kids. But he did wrong and they put him away for a long
  stretch."</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon. A long stretch?"</p>

  <p>"Yus, quod, you know, sir. So the business was broke up and I was sent
  into the world with no prospects. And me as dead set on them pretty things as
  the pore old man. Can't keep away from 'em. Can't work fer hangin' round
  museums. But private collections is me mark, only there's no chance for a
  poor bloke like me seein' of 'em. So I 'its upon this stunt. Sort o' burglary
  when the coves as owns the stuff are asleep. Not as I does any 'arm, sir, and
  I never been caught afore."</p>

  <p>"Amazing," Sir Joseph cried, "simply amazing. What a story to tell at the
  club. But they'll never believe me."</p>

  <p>"&mdash;&mdash;'When I tell them how wonderful you are, they'll never
  believe me,'" Spragster warbled under his breath thoughtfully. "Beg your
  pardon, sir. Now this 'ere little show of yourn&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," Sir Joseph asked eagerly. "As a judge now, come! I am a mere
  child in such matters."</p>

  <p>Spragster did not in the least doubt it, and moreover, he was banking on
  the fact. This thing was going to be dead easy without calling on his patron,
  Mr. Pennington, after all.</p>

  <p>"Punk, absolute punk, and I won't deceive yer," he said.</p>

  <p>"Punk," the bewildered baronet cried, "what is punk?"</p>

  <p>"Punk, junk, or chunk, it's all the same. Lord, wouldn't my old man have
  chucked a customer like you the glad eye. Now, I dessay as you think them
  Apostle spoons is O.K."</p>

  <p>"You mean to say they are not?" Sir Joseph asked in dismay.</p>

  <p>"Course not. Gotter a magnerfyin' glass 'andy?"</p>

  <p>Sir Joseph had a magnifying glass handy, and produced it.</p>

  <p>"Now look fer yerself," Spragster went on. "See them little scratches on
  the back? That's the mark of the bloke in Amsterdam what made 'em. Put there
  so as the snide dealers what sell this muck to fools like&mdash;well fools,
  anyway&mdash;shan't make awkward mistakes and do themselves. Take my tip and
  chuck this stuff in the gutter if you don't want yer pals to laugh at yer.
  'Ere, I'll take the lot and bury 'em meself."</p>

  <p>Sir Joseph was quite visibly moved. This evidence of disinterested
  kindness on the part of a mere stranger was almost touching.</p>

  <p>"Greatly obliged to you, my dear sir," he murmured. "Quite right, too,
  quite right. Snobbish idea keeping things that are not what they appear to
  be, very. Now is there anything I can offer you? A glass of wine? A whisky
  and soda?"</p>

  <p>Spragster was touched in his turn. He watched Sir Joseph disappear in the
  direction of the dining-room, then, quite firmly, he mastered his emotion,
  and without ostentation, vanished unobtrusively in the direction of the
  basement stairs....</p>

  <p>The egg of the Little Auk was back again in its original home (per Kenyon
  Waldron), presumably returned by the conscience-stricken thief, and once more
  the flowers in the garden of romance were blooming. Spragster, happy in the
  possession of 20 unexpected pounds, was making his simple preparations from
  his native shores, and Sir Joseph had entirely forgotten that such a
  phenomenon as the Little Auk had ever existed. And Spragster was not the
  least happy of the chief protagonists.</p>

  <p>"I told him it was punk, and punk it was," he murmured, patting his breast
  pocket tenderly. "But them there Aspostles was a bit of all right and no
  error."</p>
