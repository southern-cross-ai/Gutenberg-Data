<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER ONE &mdash; THE GIFTED
STRANGER</h2>

<p class="first">THE humblest of creatures play their useful, and sometimes
indispensable, parts in the great scheme of Nature. My introduction
to the strange events connected with the Gifted Stranger was
effected by a mere railway guard, and a mighty unceremonious one at
that. He had blown his ridiculous whistle and waved his absurd
flag, the engine had uttered a warning shriek, and the train had
actually begun to move, when I raced wildly up the platform at
Herne Hill.</p>

<p>"'Ere, in you get!" shouted the guard, spitting out his whistle
and wrenching open a door; and, as I scrambled on the footboard, he
applied a <i>vis a tergo</i> that sent me staggering across the
compartment and caused the only other occupant hastily to draw up
his foot and rub that portion of his boot that corresponds to the
corn on the little toe.</p>

<p>"Seem to be in a hurry," the proprietor of the toe remarked
sourly.</p>

<p>"I'm not really," I replied. "It was the guard. I am sorry I
trod on your foot."</p>

<p>"So am I," was the acid rejoinder. And the conversation
languished.</p>

<p>I put my bag and stick in the rack and spread myself out. It was
a first-class compartment, my ticket was a third, and the first
stoppage was at Faversham. This was highly gratifying. We all like
to get some of our own back from the railway companies.</p>

<p>My companion sat and stared out at the house roofs that floated
past the window as if immersed in his own reflections. He was a
massively-built man with large feet, a sandy moustache, and a
peculiarly foxy type of countenance. Socially I could not place him
at all. He did not look like a professional man, or a farmer, or a
ship-master, or, for the matter of that, like a first-class
passenger. But that was none of my business.</p>

<p>Presently he produced a letter from his pocket, and, holding it
nearly at arm's length, slowly read it through. Now I object
strongly to people who read letters under your very nose, for, try
as you will, you can't help an occasional glance, and then you are
annoyed with yourself. This was a long letter, written in a bold,
legible hand on both sides of the paper and held out in the full
light of the window. I tried to look away, but again and again my
eyes unconsciously turned towards it and each time I found myself
reading a sentence before I recollected myself. What made it worse
was that the sentences were so very odd that they tempted me to
steal a further glance to see what they meant, and my struggles to
resist the temptation were not so successful as I should have
wished.</p>

<p>"If it is really true, there is a fortune waiting for
somebody."</p>

<p>I had read this sentence before I had the presence of mind to
shut my eyes. And even while I was considering the question, If
what was true? behold! my eyes had automatically opened and taken
in another sentence.</p>

<p>"Your peculiar gifts and experience ought to help you to solve
it."</p>

<p>I turned my eyes away guiltily, but could not help speculating.
What were his peculiar gifts&mdash;besides a hypersensitive little
toe? And what would they help him to solve? Before I was aware of
it, my eyes were back on the paper and had lighted on this
astonishing statement:</p>

<p>"It is in the room in which there is an iron pump and a sedan
chair."</p>

<p>Good Heavens! I ejaculated inwardly. What kind of room can it be
that contains an iron pump and a sedan chair? And what can the rest
of the furniture be like? In my amazement I stared at the letter
like a fool, and at that moment I caught the eye of the owner.</p>

<p>It was very embarrassing. Of course I oughtn't to have looked at
the letter, but then he ought not to have held it under my nose.
And, in any case, it was rude of him to stare at me as he put the
letter away and then to move pointedly to the other end of the
compartment. I felt it very much and for some time sat gaping out
of the window in great confusion, trying to ignore my fellow
passenger.</p>

<p>When, at length, I ventured to glance in his direction, I again
caught his eye. But now there was a new expression in it; an
expression of interest and lively curiosity. He held a number of
official-looking blue papers in his hand, and, when he caught my
glance, he hastily gathered them together&mdash;so hastily that he
dropped one, and before he could snatch it up from the floor, I was
able to observe that it had a photograph pasted on it. He seemed
unreasonably annoyed about the accident&mdash;for it was only a
man's portrait, after all. He rammed the papers into his inside
breast pocket, buttoned his coat, stuck his hands deep into his
pockets and looked as if he would have liked to stick his feet in,
too, and so generally put himself out of sight. For the rest of the
journey he sat motionless in his corner, staring out of the window
like a cataleptic waxwork, evidently determined to offer no further
entertainment.</p>

<p>But he had given me some food for reflection to go on with.
There was the room, for instance, which contained a pump, a sedan
chair and "It." What on earth could "It" be? A stuffed elephant,
perhaps, or a full-size model of the <i>Victory</i>, or some
similar portable trifle. And then my companion's "peculiar gifts
and experience," what could that mean? Was he a clairvoyant or a
crystal-gazer? He didn't look like one. But there was that
photograph, and here my thoughts wandered off into speculative
channels, which led nowhere, as I had not his peculiar gifts.</p>

<p>From these wanderings I presently came back to my own affairs. I
had been sent down to Canterbury by old Morlett, our senior
partner, on business connected with a property called Elham Manor.
The rather ruinous old house had been taken by an American
gentleman, Mr Jezreel P Damper, for one year on trial, with the
understanding that, if he liked it, he should take it on lease. He
had already been given possession but had apparently not entered
into residence, and my business was to inspect the premises and
make local arrangements for the execution of such repairs as I
thought necessary, consulting with Mr Damper if he was to be found.
When I had done this I was to take a fortnight's holiday.</p>

<p>At Canterbury West my gifted fellow-traveller alighted and
walked slowly towards the barrier. I bustled past him, and,
unostentatiously presenting my third-class ticket, hurried out of
the station, down the approach into the High Street. Jubilantly I
took my way along the venerable thoroughfare towards the massive
towers of the West Gate, anxiously considering where I should put
up for the night, until my eye lighted on the jovial sign of the
Falstaff Inn. Now a real painted sign is in these days a thing to
be thankful for, and such a painted sign, too, to say nothing of
the fine forged ironwork. I halted to admire the portrait of jolly
Sir John, then, on the front of the house, I descried the winged
wheel of the CTC, whereupon I dived in through the low doorway and
demanded high tea and a night's lodging.</p>

<p>There is great comfort in an old-fashioned inn with a painted
signboard and a landlord who knows what's what. I sat complacently
in the coffee room and watched a minor canon, disguised as a
waiter, prepare the table for afternoon service and vanish
silently. I sniffed a growing aroma of grilled ham, and when, anon,
the canon reappeared, staggering majestically with a Falstaffian
tea tray, I drew up to the table, poured myself out a bumper of
tea, and decapitated a soft-boiled egg at a single stroke. And at
that very moment the coffee-room door opened and in walked my
peculiarly gifted fellow-traveller.</p>

<p>He did not appear to notice me, which was uncomfortable. I am
not a conspicuous man, but I am quite visible to the naked eye at a
distance of seven feet, which was the distance that separated us as
he sat at the other end of the table pretending that I didn't
exist. It was not only uncomfortable, it was offensive. Perhaps his
toe still rankled in his breast&mdash;if I may use the
expression&mdash;or my inadvertent glance at his letter was still
unforgiven. In any case his glum and silent presence at the table
destroyed all pleasure in my meal. It was neither solitude nor
company. Hurriedly I gobbled up eggs, ham and toast, drained the
teapot to the last drop, rose from the table and stalked out of the
room.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later I was once more strolling up the High
Street, debating whether I should begin my business at once or wait
till the morrow. Entering the city by the West Gate, I paused on
the bridge to look down on the quiet river, the flock of resting
boats, and the picturesque houses with their thresholds awash,
leaning over their unsteady reflections, when, chancing to look
back, to my surprise and annoyance I observed the gifted stranger
sauntering towards me.</p>

<p>It was very singular. I had left the inn only a few minutes and
when I came away he had but just begun his meal. This indecorous
haste in feeding further prejudiced me against him, which, together
with a dim suspicion that he was following me, made me decide to
get clear of him. Starting forward, I strode down a by-street,
darted through an archway and along an alley and then traversing a
narrow lane once more found myself in the High Street.</p>

<p>A careful look round showed me that the gifted one was not in
sight. Probably he had gone down the by-street and missed the
archway. I was turning to resume my walk when I perceived straight
before me the entrance of the City Museum. Now museums have a
fascination for me, especially provincial museums, which are apt to
contain antiquities of local interest. The present one, too,
offered a sanctuary from my gifted acquaintance, for if he was
really following me, he would probably spend the rest of the day
scouring the streets in search of me. Accordingly I entered the
museum and began to browse round the galleries, of which the first
two that I entered were tenanted by a dreary company of stuffed
birds. From the ornithological rooms I passed to a picture gallery
furnished abundantly with examples of the old masters of the "brown
and shiny" school. This was not very thrilling. What was more to
the point was a notice on the wall directing visitors to the Coplin
Collection of local antiquities. Following the direction of the
pointing hand, I started forthwith along a narrow passage that led
to a distant annexe, which, to judge by its present condition, was
seldom trodden by the foot of man. At the end of the passage I came
to a large room, at the threshold of which I halted with a gasp of
recognition. For the first thing that met my eye was a sedan chair,
and the second, a curious iron pump.</p>

<p>This, then, was the mysterious room. The next question was What
was "It?" I ran my eye over the various objects displayed
confidingly on tables, unguarded by glass covers. "Leather corset,
said to have been worn by Queen Elizabeth," and extremely
contracted in the region of the gizzard. That wasn't it. "Ivory
recorder with silver key." That wasn't it. "Wheel-lock musket,"
"Child's Shoe," "Carved horn drinking-cup," none of these fitted
the implied description. And, at last, I came to the veritable
"It."</p>

<p>No doubt was possible. I identified it at the first glance.
Mystery and secrecy exhaled from it like a subtle perfume.
Concentrating my attention to a perfect focus, I bent over the
table to examine it minutely.</p>

<p>It was a silver mirror, a small piece, of charming design and
exquisite workmanship, wrought&mdash;mirror and frame
together&mdash;from a single plate of silver. The few square inches
of polished surface were surrounded by a broad, richly ornamented
frame, the design of which included an encompassing ribbon which
supported an oblong pendant. And here was where the mystery came
in. For on ribbon and pendant was engraved, in delightfully
picturesque "old face" lettering, the following strange
inscription:</p>
<br>

<p class="poem">A Harp and a Cross and goode redd golde,<br>
Beneath ye Cross with ye Harp full nigh,<br>
Ankores three atte ye foote of a tree<br>
And a Maid from ye Sea on high.<br>
Take itt. Tis thine. Others have stepped over.</p>

<p class="poem">&mdash;Simon Glynn. 1683.</p>
<br>

<p>I read through this poetic gem a half a dozen times and was none
the wiser then. In sporting parlance, it was a "fair knockout." I
could make nothing of it. At length I turned to the descriptive
label for enlightenment&mdash;and didn't get it.</p>

<p>"Small silver mirror, discovered in 1734, concealed in an aumbry
in Elham Manor House. This house was built by Simon Glynn, a
goldsmith and an official of the mint under the Commonwealth, who
lived in it for many years. The aumbry was discovered behind the
panelling of the dining room during some repairs. The mirror is
believed to be Glynn's own work and the doggerel verses engraved on
the frame are supposed to refer to some hidden treasure, but their
exact meaning has never been ascertained. See Boteler's 'Manor
Houses of Kent', for an account of Simon Glynn and Elham Manor
House."</p>

<p>Here was news indeed! Elham Manor! I had the keys in my pocket
at the very moment! And I had full authority to carry out any
structural repairs that I thought necessary! And the cryptogram had
never been deciphered!</p>

<p>Now I understood that mysterious sentence in my friend's letter:
"There is a fortune waiting for somebody." Yes, indeed! Perhaps it
was waiting for me. I seemed to understand, too, why the gifted one
had dogged me in that singular manner. No doubt his letter had
contained some helpful tips and he suspected that I had read
them&mdash;and I wished I had, now. But he little suspected that I
had the run of Elham Manor, and I mustn't let him if I could help
it.</p>

<p>Feverishly I copied into my notebook the inscription and the
label. Then I wandered round the room, thinking hard and looking at
the exhibits. Should I repair to the adjoining library and look up
Boteler, or should I make a beeline for the Manor House? I turned
over this question before the pump, the shoe, the pistol and the
recorder, but could not make up my mind. I cogitated as I stood in
front of the sedan chair, vainly seeking to peer in through the
curtained windows. In sheer absence of mind, I tried the fastening,
and when, to my surprise, the door came open, revealing the
snugly-cushioned interior, I became suddenly possessed by an insane
curiosity to feel what the inside of a sedan chair was like.
Yielding to the impulse, I backed in and sat down, and then, to
complete the sensation, I drew the door to, when it shut with an
audible click.</p>

<p>I sat in the semi-darkness turning over my problem. Should I
risk the publicity of the reading room or go direct to the Manor
House? And what the deuce could Simon Glynn mean by that absurd
doggerel? The sedan chair was extremely comfortable, and the dim
light that filtered in through the worn curtains was pleasant and
conducive to thought. I enjoyed myself amazingly&mdash;until my ear
caught the sound of approaching footsteps and an unmistakable
clerical voice. Then, thinking that it was high time to move, I
gave a gentle push at the door.</p>

<p>But the confounded thing wouldn't budge. I pushed a little
harder, but the door only creaked protestingly. It evidently had a
snap catch. In short, I was locked in. I was about to try if the
front window could be let down when the footsteps entered the room
and a sonorous clerical voice arose in wordy exposition. I broke
out into a cold perspiration and hardly dared to
breathe&mdash;especially as the dusty interior was inducing a
distinct tendency to sneeze.</p>

<p>"Here is a sedan chair," the voice expounded, "a vehicle which
illustrates&mdash;leave that handle alone, James, you are not
allowed to touch&mdash;which illustrates the primitive modes of
locomotion in use among our forefathers. You will
observe&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here I seized my nose with both hands. My eyes watered. My
shoulders heaved. I tried to hold my breath, but it was no go. I
felt it coming&mdash; coming&mdash;and at last it came.</p>

<p>"<i>Ha chow!</i>"</p>

<p>The expounding voice ceased. There was a deathly silence. And
then, in stern accents:</p>

<p>"How many more times am I to remind you, Alfred, of the
indecorousness of sneezing in public places?"</p>

<p>"Please, sir, it wasn't me," piped a small, protesting
voice.</p>

<p>"'It wasn't <i>me</i>'! You mean, I presume, 'It was not
<i>I</i>.' And don't make your bad manners and bad grammar worse by
prevarication. I heard you. Let us move on."</p>

<p>They moved on. The solemn exposition continued. And then they
moved off. As their footsteps retreated, I made a tentative attack
on the front window, but hardly had I grasped the webbing strap
when my ear caught a faint creak. There was someone in the room,
still, a person with one slightly creaky boot. I heard the creak
travel slowly round the room, halting at intervals. Then it made a
prolonged halt&mdash;in the neighbourhood of the mirror, as I
judged by the sound. And meanwhile I sat and perspired with
anxiety.</p>

<p>Presently the creaking boot moved on again. It travelled more
quickly now; and it began to travel in my direction. Slowly,
gradually it approached, nearer and nearer it came, until, at last,
it was opposite my prison. And there it paused. I held my breath
until I was like to burst. How much longer was the idiot going to
stand there staring like a fool at an ordinary, commonplace sedan
chair?</p>

<p>I was on the very verge of suffocation when something touched
the handle. Then it turned slowly; the door opened, and
there&mdash;yes&mdash;my prophetic soul! it was&mdash;my highly
gifted friend. He looked in at me with sour surprise and hastily
closed his note book. But he made no remark. After a prolonged
stare he made an attempt to shut the door, but I had the presence
of mind to stick my foot out. Then he turned away. I listened to
his footsteps retreating down the passage at a slow saunter until
they were faint in the distance, when their rhythm suddenly changed
to that of a quick walk. He was off somewhere in a great
hurry&mdash;probably to the library to consult Boteler.</p>

<p>I stepped out of my prison with my mind made up. I would go and
make a preliminary inspection of Elham Manor and read up Boteler
when I had seen it. Striding briskly down the passage and through
the galleries I came out into the street and turned towards the
road to Sturry. I knew my way, for I had looked it up on the
Ordnance Map. The old house stood on a side road between Sturry and
the village of Bouldersby, only a mile or two out of the town.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant summer evening and the sun was still shining
brightly as I came out on the country road and took my way blithely
past farm and meadow and tree-shaded oast. About a mile and a half
from the city I came upon a finger-post inscribed "Bouldersby and
Hawkham," and pointing up a byroad bordered by lofty elms. Taking
this direction I walked on for another mile or so until a bend in
the road brought me suddenly to what I recognised at once as my
destination, a low, red-brick wall abutting on the road and above
it the stepped gables and lichen-covered roof of an ancient and
highly picturesque house.</p>

<p>I walked along in front of the wall until I reached the iron
gates, and here I halted to reconnoitre. For that ridiculous jingle
of old Simon Glynn's rang in my head anew as I looked at the front
of the old house. The iron gates were hung from two massive brick
pillars, each surmounted by a stone pineapple, and on the front of
one pillar was carved in high relief a shield bearing a St George's
cross, while the other bore a relief of a shield with an Irish
harp.</p>

<p>Here, then, were the Harp and Cross plain enough, but the other
items mentioned in the doggerel were not so obvious. It is true
that, between the windows above the porch, was a carved brick niche
containing a statue of a young woman, and a very charming little
statue it was, evidently the portrait of a young Puritan lady; but
whether she came from the sea or the land there was nothing to
show. There was, however, a good deal to show what interpretation
had been put on the doggerel rhyme, for the flagged path from the
gate to the porch seemed to have suffered from a succession of
earthquakes. And the excavators had not stopped at the path; the
pillar that bore the Cross device was sensibly out of the
perpendicular, showing that its very foundations had been rooted
up, and the brickwork itself showed numerous patches where
treasure-seekers had bored into it. Evidently the gifted one and I
were by no means the first explorers in this field.</p>

<p>I had just taken the keys from my pocket, and was selecting the
one that belonged to the gate, when the silence was broken by a
faint rhythmical sound from the road round the bend. It was the
creak of a boot&mdash;one boot, not a pair&mdash;and as I listened,
it seemed to me that I had heard it before. I slipped the keys back
into my pocket&mdash;for it would be better not to be seen entering
the house&mdash;and was beginning to saunter up the road, when the
creak materialized into my gifted competitor, coming round the bend
like a lamplighter. He slowed down suddenly when he saw me, and as
I strolled round another turn in the road, I observed that he had
stopped and was gazing about him with his back to the house, as if
he had not noticed it.</p>

<p>I walked on towards Bouldersby considering the situation. My
respected rival was evidently nervous and suspicious of me. He
thought I knew a good deal more than I did. And this suggested the
question: How much did he know? Apparently that letter had
contained some useful information which he suspected me of having
extracted. But if it was true that the treasure was still
undiscovered, and he had some private information that I had not,
perhaps it would be as well to keep an eye on him and see if I
could pick up a hint or two from his proceedings.</p>

<p>I had just reached this sage conclusion and was on the point of
turning back, when I perceived, a little way ahead, a small
roadside inn; a picturesque little house, standing back from the
road behind a small green, on which was a signpost bearing the sign
of the Royal George. The pleasant aspect of the house led me to
approach and reconnoitre when I observed that it had a back wing
extending into a garden and that the garden ran down to the river
and adjoined an orchard. I approached past the little bay window
(in which was a card inscribed with the legend "New-laid Eggs") and
looked in at the door. It was a most primitive inn. A couple of
barrels on stands and a row of mugs on a shelf formed its entire
outfit, and the only persons visible were an old woman, who sat
sewing busily in a Wycombe armchair, and a corpulent tabby cat.</p>

<p>The homely comfort of the place, the quiet and the proximity of
the river, offered an agreeable suggestion. As the old lady looked
up and smiled a greeting, I advanced and ventured to enquire:</p>

<p>"Do you happen to have any accommodation for a lodger?"</p>

<p>Mine hostess nodded and smiled as she replied: "Yes, they're all
new-laid. I keeps my own fowls and feeds 'em myself."</p>

<p>This seemed irrelevant. Raising my voice considerably, I
asked:</p>

<p>"Could you put me up here for a week or so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, apples!" she answered doubtfully. "No, they're hardly ripe
yet. It's a bit early, you see."</p>

<p>The reply was a little disconcerting. But its dogged as does it.
I tried again. With an ear-splitting yell that was like to have
swept the mugs off the shelf, I repeated my question&mdash;and was
asked in return whether I would have mild or bitter?</p>

<p>It seemed hopeless. But I liked the look of the place. It was
scrupulously clean and well kept; and the rustic quiet, the
pleasant garden and the river flowing past, urged me to new
efforts. I scribbled my question on a scrap of paper which I handed
to the old lady; but observing that this seemed to give offence, I
hastily added a line explaining that I was suffering from a sore
throat and had lost my voice. This completely appeased her and she
allowed me to continue the negotiations on paper, of which the
upshot was that, if I was content to "live plain and not expect too
much waiting on," I could have the small bedroom overlooking the
garden and move in tomorrow evening.</p>

<p>I walked back towards Elham Manor in high spirits. I had secured
pleasant country lodgings and a convenient base from which to carry
out the repairs and explorations on the old house and keep a watch
on my rival. That was a good start, and now I would make a
preliminary inspection of the house&mdash;if I could do so
unobserved&mdash;and then look up Boteler's history.</p>

<p>When I came in sight of the Manor House, my rival was nowhere to
be seen. But I approached warily in case he had climbed over into
the grounds to begin his explorations, and I had a good look round
before inserting my key into the gate. As I turned the key, I noted
the excellent condition of the lock&mdash;which seemed to have been
recently oiled&mdash;and the same thing struck me when I unlocked
and opened the front door. Apparently our tenant, Mr Damper, had
begun his restorations with an oil can.</p>

<p>I walked with echoing footsteps through the hall and into the
empty rooms, wondering dimly how I should communicate with Mr
Damper, but thinking more of Simon Glynn and his hidden treasure.
The fine old house was falling slowly but surely into decay. Such
repairs as would make it really habitable would leave no corner of
it undisturbed and must surely bring to light the secret hiding
place if it really existed. Thus reflecting, I wandered from room
to room, noting the dilapidations and speculating as to the
whereabouts of the treasure, until I came to a chamber at the end
of the building which was at a slightly lower level. Descending the
short flight of stairs, I tried the massive door, and, finding it
locked, produced the bunch of labelled keys. As I inserted the
first key, I thought I detected a faint sound of movement from
within, and the unpleasant idea of rats suggested itself, but I
worked away until I found a key&mdash;labelled "Butler's
Pantry"&mdash;that turned in the lock. The heavy door swung open
with a loud creak, and I entered the room, which was in almost
total darkness, the only source of light being a few chinks in the
shutters.</p>

<p>Dark as it was, however, there was light enough for me to see a
very strange and unexpected object, to wit, a small but massive
chest which stood on the bumpy oaken floor near to one window. I
drew near to examine it, and then found that it was fastened only
by a bolt, though it was clearly intended to be secured with a
padlock. In mere idle curiosity, I drew back the bolt and raised
the lid, and then I got a mighty surprise. For even in that dim
light it was easy to see that the contents were of no ordinary
value. Rings, pendants, bracelets, brooches, glittered and sparkled
in the dim light; gold chains were heaped together like samples of
cable in a ship-chandler's, and the interstices of the pile were
filled in with a litter of unmounted stones.</p>

<p>I was positively staggered. What made it still more astonishing
was that this was obviously not Simon Glynn's treasure. The chest
was a new one and the jewels were not only fresh and bright but
were manifestly modern in character. That I could see at a glance.
But what this treasure was, how it came here, and to whom it
belonged, were questions to which I could suggest no answer.</p>

<p>I knelt down by the chest and began to turn over the articles
one by one. I am no great judge of jewellery, but it was evident
that some of these things were of very great value. Here was a
pendant, for instance, of which the central diamond was half an
inch in diameter. That alone must be worth some hundreds of pounds.
I picked it up to look at it more closely&mdash;and at that instant
both my wrists were seized in a vice-like grip. I dropped the
pendant and, uttering a yell of surprise, began to struggle to free
myself. But the grip only tightened; gradually my hands were forced
together on my chest; something cold touched my wrists; there was a
metallic click, and, glancing down, my astonished gaze lighted on a
pair of handcuffs.</p>

<p>"Now, it's no use kicking up a dust," said a voice close to my
ear. "I've got the cuffs on you, so you'd better come along
quiet."</p>

<p>I twisted my head round to get a view of the speaker, and
succeeded in catching a glimpse of half a face. But that was
enough. It was&mdash;my prophetic soul again&mdash;the gifted
investigator. And one of his peculiar gifts I was now able to
sample&mdash;a most uncommon degree of muscular strength.</p>

<p>"I've got you, you know," he resumed unpleasantly. "You can't
get away, so you'd better chuck up the sponge and come
quietly."</p>

<p>This was all very well, but I am not a naturally submissive
person. I made no comment, but, straightening myself suddenly like
a mechanical jumping frog, I capsized him backwards and began to
make play with my legs. It was an undignified affair, I must admit.
We rolled over and over on the floor; we pummelled and prodded one
another ambiguously and without purpose, and once I cut short an
eloquent remonstrance by planting my knee in the middle of his
abdomen. But the odds were against me, and the end of it was that I
reclined on my back with his knee on my chest and listened to the
terms of surrender.</p>

<p>But now a most astonishing thing befell. Even as he leaned over
me and expounded the folly of my conduct, I was aware of a dim
shape behind him, noiselessly approaching. A face&mdash;a
foreign-looking face, with a waxed moustache and fiercely-cocked
eyebrows&mdash;appeared over his shoulder and slowly drew nearer
and nearer. I gazed with fascination, and the words of wisdom
trickled unheeded into my ears; and still the face drew nearer.
Then came a sudden movement, a shout of surprise from the gifted
one, another shout, and a sound of sixteen heavy portmanteaux
falling down a steep flight of stairs.</p>

<p>Released from the weight of my assailant, I sat up and watched
events. My eyes, accustomed by now to the dim light, took in a heap
of squirming humanity from which issued a stream of breathless
objurgation. I counted six legs&mdash;all in violent
movement&mdash;and reasonably assumed the existence of three
individuals. One pair of legs, incomparably the most active, I
identified speculatively, by the stockinged feet, as those of my
late assailant, for he must have removed his creaky boots to have
approached me so silently, which now placed him at a disadvantage,
as the other two warriors wore their boots&mdash;and used them.</p>

<p>Presently, from the writhing mass, a man partially detached
himself and began to angle for the wildly-kicking feet with a loop
of cord. For some time he was unsuccessful and the feet had the
best of it&mdash; unless his head was unusually hard&mdash;but at
last the loop slipped over the ankles and was drawn tight; on which
the gifted one made appropriate comments in terms unsuitable for
verbatim report and ending in a muffled snort. The loop having been
secured by one or two round turns and a knot, the two strangers
rose, breathing heavily and rubbing certain apparently painful
spots on their persons. Meanwhile, my late adversary lay motionless
and silent, his legs lashed together and his wrists secured by
handcuffs; and now I understood that curious snort that had cut
short the flow of his eloquence, for I observed that my rescuers
had tied a gag over his mouth.</p>

<p>I ventured, at this juncture, to draw attention to my own
condition. But it was unnecessary. The two strangers approached me,
still rubbing themselves. I held out my manacled hands to have the
gyves unlocked, when, to my astonishment, one of the foreign
rascals pushed me down and sat on my stomach while the other took a
few turns with a cord round my ankles. I protested vigorously.</p>

<p>"Here! I say! You're making a mist&mdash;" I didn't get any
further, for one of the foreign brutes dabbed something into my
mouth and tied it there with a string behind my neck. Then he
issued a command to the other miscreant in some ridiculous jargon
which I suppose served them in place of a language, and the other
villain hurried out of the room. He returned in less than a minute
and made some report in his wretched substitute for speech, and the
two wretches then picked up my unfortunate and gifted acquaintance
and carried him away.</p>

<p>I lay on the floor reflecting, with profound misgivings, on my
alarming situation. Evidently I and my rival had unwittingly
discovered the hiding place of a gang of thieves, and those
scoundrels were going to put us out of the way of doing them any
mischief. That was clear. But what was our destination? Were they
going to drop us in the river? Or would they convey us to some
cellar or vault and knock us on the head? Either possibility was
equally likely and equally unpleasant.</p>

<p>My meditations were cut short by the reappearance of the two
miscreants, who, without a word, picked me up by my arms and ankles
and marched away with me. Up the stairs, into the hall and out
through this on to the flagged path, we went, like a somewhat
hurried and premature rustic funeral; and we were just approaching
the front gates when another very singular thing happened. I was
being borne head first, while my captors marched facing forward,
and I was thus able to command a view of the rear. Now, as we
approached the gate, chancing to turn my eyes towards the flanking
wall that separated the garden from the orchard, to my unutterable
surprise I saw three heads slowly rise from behind it. Each head
was, naturally, furnished with a face, and each face was adorned
with one of the very broadest grins that I have ever seen. It was
really a most astonishing affair.</p>

<p>Outside the gates a closed fly was drawn up, otherwise not a
creature was in sight. The door was opened by the driver and I was
bundled in and deposited on the back seat, the other half of which
was occupied by my gifted friend, whose boots had been
considerately placed on his knees. The two ruffians entered and
shut the door, the driver mounted to his seat, and away we went at
a smart trot.</p>

<p>I was relieved to note that we were not being driven towards the
river, and was rather surprised to find that our route lay towards
the town. But it was not merely towards the town; it soon became
evident that the town itself was our objective. The audacity of
these villains was positively staggering! Heedless of the risk of
detection, these miscreants bore us, manacled, bound and gagged,
not merely through the outlying suburbs, but into the very city.
Jostling cabs, carts, vans and carriages, past the teeming footways
and busy shops, we passed unblushingly into the High Street itself,
and then, turning down a well-frequented side street, came at
length to a halt. I directed my astonished eyes out of the near
window, hardly able to believe in such brazen audacity; and the
first object they encountered was a blue glass lamp bearing the
inscription "Police Station."</p>

<p>The driver sprang down and opened the door, the two "foreign
devils" hooked me out of the seat and carried me swiftly in through
the open doorway to a large office, where they deposited me on the
floor and hurried away without a word. A police inspector and a
sergeant looked in amazement from me to the departing ruffians and
then looked at one another.</p>

<p>"Rum go, this," said the inspector, with another doubtful glance
at me. "I hope it's all right, but they'd no authority to make
arrests."</p>

<p>Here the two ruffians returned, bearing my unfortunate
companion, at the sight of whom the inspector's face assumed a
distinctly careworn expression.</p>

<p>"I seem to know this man," he said in a low voice. Then,
addressing our captors, he asked: "Who are these two
prisoners?"</p>

<p>"Zey are two of ze gang," the senior ruffian replied carelessly;
"I do not know vich two. I find zem quarrelling about ze booty. I
catch zem. Zey are here. Enough," and he began superciliously to
roll a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Take off the gags, sergeant," said the inspector, and as he
spoke he, himself, untied mine and pulled me up into a sitting
position, while the sergeant did the same for my
fellow-sufferer.</p>

<p>"Now," said the inspector, addressing the latter, "what's your
name?"</p>

<p>"My name, sir," replied the gifted one with as majestic an air
as is possible to a man who is seated on the floor with his feet
tied together, "is Burbler, Detective-Sergeant Burbler of the
Criminal Investigation Department."</p>

<p>"Hanged if I didn't think so," murmured the inspector. "Take off
the cuffs, sergeant, and untie his feet. You've made a mistake,
gentlemen. You've arrested one of our officers."</p>

<p>"I sink not," the foreign person replied haughtily. "Zat man is
a criminal. Look at 'is face. I haf experience;" and he calmly
lighted his cigarette.</p>

<p>"You'll have some more experience when I get these handcuffs
off," said Burbler; but here the inspector interposed, forbidding
violence and demanding explanations.</p>

<p>"How did this affair happen?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," Burbler replied, savagely. "I was sent down
here to look out for this Chicago-St Petersburg gang. From
information received I was going to Elham Manor where I expected to
find traces of them, when I met this man Polopsky" (here he
actually pointed to me!). "I recognised him at once from his
photograph&mdash;I've got it here," and he pulled out from his
pocket the photograph which I had seen in the train, and showed it
to the inspector, who examined it closely, and, having remarked
that it "seemed rather a poor likeness," returned it. "Well,"
pursued Burbler, "I followed him and saw him hanging about Elham
Manor, and, when he saw me and sneaked away, I got into the house
by a back window and waited. Presently he came back and let himself
in with a key and went to a locked room and entered that with
another key. I followed him in and caught him with a lot of the
stolen property in his possession, a whole trunk-load of it."</p>

<p>"Where is the stolen property now?" the inspector asked.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's in the house still," replied Burbler, and he
continued furiously: "Well, I had just overpowered Polopsky and got
the cuffs on him, and was about to secure the property, when these
two blithering lunatics rushed in, and&mdash;well, you see what
happened. I'm going to prosecute them for assault and unlawful
arrest."</p>

<p>"Better not," said the inspector. "Russian Secret Police, you
know. Exceeded their powers, of course, but better not make a fuss.
You are going to charge Polopsky, I suppose?"</p>

<p>Burbler grunted assent, and turning to me said:</p>

<p>"Louis Polopsky, I arrest you on the charge of burglary and
forgery, and I caution you that anything you may say will be used
in evidence against you. Do you want to make any statement?"</p>

<p>"I should like to remark," I replied, "that my name is not
Polopsky; and that, if any damage is done to the premises of Elham
Manor through your coming away and leaving the door and gates
unlocked, I shall hold you responsible."</p>

<p>The inspector looked at me suspiciously and asked: "What do you
say your name is?"</p>

<p>"My name," I replied, "is Shuttlebury Cobb, of the Firm of
Morlett and Griller, solicitors to the landlord of Elham Manor, and
I am, at present, in charge of the property."</p>

<p>I handed the inspector some papers and a draft agreement that I
had in my pocket, together with a bunch of labelled keys; and while
he looked them over, the rather chap-fallen detective put on his
boots.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," I continued, "that you have all been making
rather free with our premises. May I ask if those other three men
were some of your people?"</p>

<p>"What other three men?" the inspector asked in a rather startled
tone.</p>

<p>"The men who were watching us as we left the house."</p>

<p>"<i>What men?</i>" demanded the inspector, the two foreign
devils and Sergeant Burbler in a frantic chorus.</p>

<p>"The men who were in the orchard, watching us over the
wall."</p>

<p>Burbler sprang to his feet, with one boot unlaced. For one
moment the four officers and the station sergeant stared at me in
silence; for another moment they stared at one another; then, with
one accord, they made a rush for the door.</p>

<p>I followed them out. The fly was still waiting at the kerb, and
the five men were endeavouring to enter it simultaneously by the
same doorway. I watched their frantic struggles. I saw them finally
pack themselves in; and, when the inspector had snorted out the
destination, I saw the fly drive off. Then I slowly wended my way
back to the Falstaff and bespoke a substantial dinner.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER TWO &mdash; THE SECRET CODE
AND THE CASTAWAY</h2>

<p class="first">UP to that eventful day on which my firm sent me down to
Canterbury on business connected with the tenancy of Elham Manor,
the even tenor of my life had been uninterrupted by any cataclysms
or abnormal occurrences. But from the moment in which I set forth
on that apparently prosaic errand, I seemed to be taken into the
charge of some exuberantly sportive jinn. The whole world appeared
to go mad with one accord. I became the plaything of erratic
chance, the football of circumstance; and circumstance seemed to
have a decided leaning towards the Rugby game...</p>

<p>After the explanation at the police station, I naturally thought
I had heard the last of that absurd business.</p>

<p>But I hadn't.</p>

<p>Our tenant not having arrived yet, I had a good deal of time on
my hands, for I could not begin the repairs in the house until I
had seen him; and the fact that I had found Detective-Sergeant
Burbler still prowling about the premises induced me to keep clear
of the place for the present and devote myself to a study of the
surrounding country.</p>

<p>One of my earliest jaunts was along the road that leaves the
city towards the north; a pleasant, sylvan road though somewhat
trying as to the gradients.</p>

<p>"Wot ye not wher ther stont a litel toun, Which that icleped is
Bob-up-and-doun Under the Ble, in Canterbury way?"</p>

<p>That was the road only that I passed Harbledown on my left hand
and "bobbed up and down" through Blean and across the hills beyond
until I finally bobbed down past Bostal mill to the seashore at
Whitstable.</p>

<p>It was a delightful walk&mdash;with one exception. There
happened to be another man going the same way. That is the worst of
country roads. In a city street the passing multitudes leave one
solitary and undisturbed, but on a quiet country road, a single
foot passenger, going in the same direction, destroys the solitude
completely. Naturally he walks at about your own pace. If you try
to outwalk him or lag behind, he occupies your attention; if you
try to ignore him, his obtrusive figure ahead or his irritating
footfall from behind break in continually on your meditations. My
present companion wore spectacles and looked like a German. Not
that I would reproach him on that account. I don't suppose he wore
spectacles by choice, and, of course, the poor creature couldn't
help being a German. I merely record the facts.</p>

<p>At the top of Bostal Hill he halted to survey the Harbour down
below through a pair of prism binoculars, and I took the
opportunity to nip on ahead and rid myself of him.</p>

<p>It was in an oyster shop near Whitstable Harbour that the plot
began to thicken. In spite of a substantial tea at the Falstaff,
the sight of dainty and delicate natives peeping coyly from barrels
at the shop door, acted as a lodestone to draw me into the little
parlour, where already a couple of gourmets were seated before a
gargantuan dish, regardless of the interested observers who peered
in through the window. I ordered a dozen "royals," and, taking a
seat at an empty table, entertained myself with the conversation of
the other two customers, pending the arrival of my own meal.</p>

<p>"And you really think I might venture, doctor?" said one of
them, a dyspeptic, nervous-looking young man, casting a look of
gluttonous alarm at the dish.</p>

<p>The jovial faced medicus peppered an oyster with deliberate
care.</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "it's your own affair, you know. Chances about
a million to one against enteric in these beds. Still, I shouldn't
eat too many"&mdash;there were two dozen on the dish. "Of course,
at my age the risk is infinitesimal, but at yours&mdash;well, you
must use your own judgment," and here the doctor diminished his own
chance of immunity by one millionth and smacked his lips.</p>

<p>Nearly ten minutes elapsed. I had just poured myself out a glass
of stout as a preliminary to the feast, the doctor had swallowed
his sixteenth oyster with an audible "gollop," and his companion
was apprehensively munching his last slice of brown bread and
butter, when there lurched into the room a large man of seafaring
aspect, wearing a sealskin cap. He ordered half a dozen
oysters&mdash;"Quick, if you please"&mdash;and seated himself at my
table, apologizing civilly with a slight foreign accent, for
finishing his cigarette.</p>

<p>"Zome English people opject to smoke at mealtimes," he
remarked.</p>

<p>I assured him that I had no objection whatever, on which he
thanked me and began to converse affably, informing me that he was
the master of a timber ship from Riga, that he was going to sea
that very night, and that he would be glad to be clear of the
approaches to the Thames.</p>

<p>"Ach! But it is a bad river, zis London river. Shoals and
sandts, sandts and shoals everyvere. Noding but sandts and
shoals."</p>

<p>As he mentioned the detested shoals, he shook his head and
glared at me reproachfully, as if I had put them there, so that I
felt almost constrained to apologize for their presence, and might
actually have done so had not the stream of conversation been
interrupted by the entry of the proprietor with a small dish.</p>

<p>"Not very peckish this evening, Captain Popoff," he remarked as
he set the dish before his customer.</p>

<p>"No," replied the captain; "my appetide is spoil. Zis night I
leave Englandt. Perhaps I come not again, and zen I see my goodt
friendts again never."</p>

<p>His methods of dealing with oysters were summary in the extreme.
The succulent natives might have been some sort of unsavoury
medicament to judge by the way in which he disposed of them. One
after another they vanished from their shells, unseasoned and
unsavoured, even as grains of barley are spirited into the gizzard
of a hungry fowl. In a couple of minutes the dish was cleared, and
the captain, having swigged off his glass of stout, heaved a sigh
of relief and drew from his pocket a gaily-coloured packet of
cigarettes.</p>

<p>"Vill you take one?" he asked, holding the packet towards me.
"Zey are very choice. You do not buy cigarettes like zese in
Englandt."</p>

<p>It was no empty boast. The cigarette that I lighted was quite
the best that I had ever smoked and I hastened to tell him so.</p>

<p>"Zen," said he with a gratified smile, "you will allow me to
present you the packet. I have plenty more. No? Zen, perhaps, if
you are not occupied you vill come and see my ship, and I vill give
you a box of cigarettes for a keepsake and you shall drink a glass
of vodka with me in my cabin. How do you say?"</p>

<p>I accepted the invitation with pleasure, and accordingly, when
we had paid our reckonings, the captain and I set forth together
for the harbour. As we passed in through the gates I became aware
of that kind of awakening among the shipping that heralds the
approach of high water. The ordinary business of the day was over.
The high stages from which the coal whippers take flying leaps into
space at the ends of their hoisting ropes stood idle, and the grimy
baskets rested on heaps of "slack" beside the sieves. Mariners,
washed and unwashed, crawled up the quay-face like geckoes with no
visible means of support, on their way townward, or lounged about
in groups, spinning interminable yarns. The last of the oyster
smacks had taken up her moorings, the whelk boats lay stranded
above tidemarks on the beach outside, and everything bore an aspect
of repose excepting the outgoing craft, which were all in a state
of ferment, hoisting sails and hauling on warps, all agog to get
out on the top of the tide.</p>

<p>Alongside the end of the pier and opposite a great stack of
newly landed timber lay a smallish barquentine; a shabby-looking
craft with rusty white sides and a green painted underbody,
intended to delude the unwary into the belief that she was
coppered. Most of her sails were hoisted, and two or three sailors
were aloft loosing the remainder as the captain and I approached.
By the name <i>Anna: Riga</i>, painted on her counter, I judged
this to be our destination, and I was right.</p>

<p>"'Zis is my ship," said Captain Popoff. "Ve have just time for a
glass and a little smoke before ze tide is full. Zen I shall vish
you farewell."</p>

<p>He stepped down on to the rail, and, grasping a shroud, held out
his hand to me and we both dropped down on deck close to the fore
hatch, which was still open.</p>

<p>"Ve are a little untidy," said the captain, "but you vill
excuse. Shall I go first?"</p>

<p>Rather to my surprise, he stepped to the open hatch and began to
descend a fixed iron ladder. It seemed a queer way to approach the
cabin, but I made no remark and cautiously let myself down after
him until I stood on the shingle ballast.</p>

<p>"It is very dark," said he, peering into the pitchy gloom aft.
"Perhaps, as you are a stranger, I had better get a light to show
you ze vay."</p>

<p>With this, he returned up the ladder; but no sooner had he
reached the deck, than someone clapped the covers on the hatch,
leaving me in total darkness. I thought this rather odd, but still
had no misgivings until some three or four minutes had passed
without any sign of the captain's reappearing. Then, as a clatter
of falling ropes and running gear from above bespoke active
preparations for departure, and sundry bumps and grinding noises
suggested that the vessel was actually in motion, a sudden alarm
seized me. Climbing up the ladder, I tried to push up the hatch
cover, and, finding that it was securely fastened above, I fell to
battering on it with my fists. This, however, produced no result,
excepting a very uncomfortable soreness of my knuckles, and even
when I fetched up a large stone from the ballast and hammered with
it for a good five minutes, my demonstrations evoked no
response.</p>

<p>Reluctantly and with a sinking heart, I descended the ladder and
sat down on the dry shingle to think over the situation. That the
captain could have forgotten me was incredible; that my persistent
hammering on the hatch cover had passed unnoticed was beyond
belief. The only alternative was that I had been kidnapped, that I
was being spirited away, though for what purpose I was unable to
conceive. The whole set of circumstances was incomprehensible.
Apparently I had fallen into the hands of some sort of brigands or
pirates; and yet to think of this harmless old timber knacker as a
pirate seemed positively grotesque. However, the one fact was
indisputable. I was being carried away forcibly to some foreign
port&mdash;probably Riga; unless I was to be robbed and thrown
overboard on the way. And as I reached this conclusion, a barely
perceptible heave of the ballast on which I sat told me that the
<i>Anna</i> was clear of harbour and fairly started on her
voyage.</p>

<p>I don't know how long I sat moping in the darkness of the
<i>Anna's</i> hold. It can have been but a short time, though it
seemed to me that hours had passed since I came down that fatal
ladder. And as I sat there, memories of the past and speculations
as to the future chased one another through my brain. I turned over
the strange events of the last few days; I thought of the queer old
silver mirror that I had seen in the museum at Canterbury and the
quaint doggerel verses inscribed on it; I conned over the absurd
jingle of which I had a copy in my pocket, and which I had dimly
hoped might guide me to the discovery of Simon Glynn's treasure,
hidden somewhere in the old manor house&mdash;that grand old house
that I should probably never see again, And I thought of the
pleasant holiday that I was to have enjoyed in the old city and the
sweet country around it; and then by a swift transition, from the
might-have-been I turned to the future&mdash;dark, threatening,
inscrutable.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was aroused by a noise overhead. The hatch covers
were raised, a shaft of light shot down into the hold, and the
captain's head appeared in the square opening above.</p>

<p>"Vould you please to come up, sir?" he asked politely.</p>

<p>Would I not! No lamplighter ever shinned up a ladder more
actively than did I, with the purple sky above and that black
cavern beneath. In a trice I was on deck, gazing sternly into the
rather sheepish face of Captain Popoff.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this, Captain?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"You vill hear now," he replied, avoiding my eye. "It is not my
affair. I cannot help it. I do as I am toldt. Zat is all. Zis vay,
if you please."</p>

<p>I followed him slowly along the deck, taking in the position of
affairs as I went. The ship appeared to be crossing the estuary
towards the north, for I could see over the port rail the distant
Isle of Sheppey, while, directly astern, the low Kentish shore with
the twin spires of Reculver loomed faint and far away in the warm
evening light. The captain preceded me on to the low poop to the
deck-house door, which was opposite the wheel and down a short
flight of stairs. At the bottom of the stairs he halted, and,
pushing open the door, invited me to enter; which I accordingly
did; and got one of the biggest surprises of my life.</p>

<p>Seated at the small cabin table, each with a sheaf of papers
before him, were three men. I recognized them all. One was the
spectacled German who had dogged me on the Whitstable road. The
others were the two Russian police agents who had arrested me and
the detective, Burbler, at Elham Manor. It was an astonishing
meeting. The German presided, with a fat, complacent smile; the two
Russians sat gloomily twisting their waxed moustaches as if they
intended presently to gore me with the stiff points.</p>

<p>"Ach!" exclaimed the German, who seemed to be a facetious
ruffian, "you are zobbrised to zee us, Mr Mifflin, and you do not
seem bleased. Zat is not so mit us. Ve are delighted to meet
you."</p>

<p>I gazed at the German and his scowling accomplices with a
feeling of stupefaction and began quaveringly:</p>

<p>"It seems to me that there is some extraordinary mistake&mdash;"
when the former interrupted: "Vot again, Herr Mifflin! No, my
vreindt, it is no goot. Zat cat he vill not chomp. Ve do not make
mistagues. Ve are not ze English bolice."</p>

<p>"Would you mind telling me who you suppose I am?" said I.</p>

<p>"Ve do not zubbose," he replied blandly. "Ve know. You are
Chacob Mifflin, <i>alias</i> Salter, <i>alias</i> Chones and zo on.
Ve follow you today from Ganderbury, ve find, fortunately a Russian
ship chust about to sail, and ve catch you."</p>

<p>"What am I supposed to have done?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You are a burglar, you are a forger: but zat is not our affair.
You make bombs for Polopsky and ze ozers, and zat <i>is</i> our
affair. Vere are zose ozer men? Are zey still in Ganderbury?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know," I replied. "I know nothing about those
men; and my name is not Mifflin."</p>

<p>"Ach! Bot you haf so many names. Berhaps you vorget. Ven did you
last see Polopsky?"</p>

<p>"I've never seen him at all to my knowledge," said I. "The last
time you arrested me you said <i>I</i> was Polopsky."</p>

<p>"Zat vos ze English bolice vot zay zat. Ve do not mistague an
American for a Pole."</p>

<p>Here one of the Russians interrupted impatiently: "Ve vaste time
talking vid zis American pig, Herr von Bommel. Let us search his
pockets."</p>

<p>They did so, with the dexterity of professional pickpockets, but
got mighty little for their pains. A pipe and tobacco pouch, a
match box, a pocket-knife, a little small change&mdash;for I had,
fortunately, left most of my money at the hotel&mdash;and a
pocketbook formed the entire "catch;" of which the German pounced
with avidity on the last item and began eagerly to turn over the
leaves.</p>

<p>It was a nearly new book, and most of the entries consisted of
rough notes relating to the proposed repairs of Elham Manor House,
which, being full of abbreviations and accompanied by calculations
and hastily-drawn diagrams, puzzled my Teutonic friend not a
little. But suddenly his eye lighted up, he ejaculated a voluminous
"Ach!" and the two Russians craned forward to look over.</p>

<p>"Zo Mr Mifflin," he exclaimed, impressively, "you do not know
Polopsky or ze ozers, bot yet you carry in your bocket a zegred
gode. Can you oxplain zis?"</p>

<p>He held up the pocketbook, and I could have laughed
aloud&mdash;under more favourable circumstances; for he had lighted
on the absurd doggerel verses that I had copied from the ancient
silver mirror in the Canterbury museum.</p>

<p>I endeavoured to "explain" how I came by the "secret code,"
saying nothing, however, about the hidden treasure to which it was
supposed to refer. But my explanation was cut short by indignant
snorts from the two Russians, and the German wagged his head
admonishingly.</p>

<p>"Vy do you tell us zis nonsense, Mifflin, my vriendt? Haf ve not
seen ze house vere your gang used to meet? Ze house vot haf a cross
on von gate post, a harp on ze ozer and a statue of a yung maid
above ze door? Vy do you tell us zese foolish lies? It shall do you
no goot. Moch better for you if you oxplain vot you mean by zis
gode. Tell us now, like a zenzible man. Vot, vor instance, is
'ankores dree'? Vot does zat mean?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I should like to know," said I, though it
didn't seem to matter much, as I was apparently bound for
Siberia.</p>

<p>The two Russians again snorted impatiently and even the
impassive German showed signs of annoyance. Beckoning to the
captain, who had been waiting by the door, he said, gruffly: "Take
him avay, Cabtain. He is an opstinate fool. Ve shall gonsider zese
doguments and zen ve vill talk to him again."</p>

<p>Accordingly I was conducted out of the cabin to a place on deck
just in front of the deck-house and sheltered by the projecting
roof of the latter. Here the captain placed a small cask to serve
as a seat, and, having furnished me with a packet of cigarettes and
a box of matches, told off one of the crew to watch me and left me
to my meditations. I was glad to exchange the heat of the stuffy
cabin for the comparative coolness of the open air, for it was a
sultry night and seemed to grow warmer as the light faded. The
darkness of the short night&mdash;it was the second week in
July&mdash;was fast closing in, for it was close on ten o'clock;
the land had vanished, either in the gloom or the distance, and
innumerable lights began to wink and twinkle over the calm sea. At
one of these&mdash;a bright light on our port bow that flashed out
and faded away at regular intervals&mdash;I noticed the captain
staring from time to time with an anxious and worried expression,
and once he shouted out some directions to the man at the
wheel.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, the three police officers came out on deck,
and, placing each a camp stool on the main hatch a few yards away
from me, sat down close together conversing earnestly in low tones
and poring over my notebook by the light of a small lantern. I
watched them with a faint grin as I smoked the captain's
cigarettes, wondering what they would make of Simon Glynn's
ridiculous jingle and what they would have to say to me when they
had unravelled "the code." And so the time passed. The night closed
in warm and dark; a soft breeze murmured in the sails and rigging
and the ship moved (at no great pace, I suspect) over the calm
sea.</p>

<p>It was just half past ten, as I was made aware by one of the
sailors who reached past me to tap out five strokes on the ship's
bell which hung above my head, when there came a sudden
interruption of the quiet monotony. In an instant I found myself on
the deck on "all fours," the sailor who had rung the bell and the
one who guarded me staggered forward and fell sprawling at full
length, and the three police officers capsized as one man and
scrambled up swearing as thirty. Then the captain rushed out of the
deck-house bellowing like a marine bull of Bashan, the deck filled
up with excited mariners who had appeared the Lord knows whence,
ropes thumped on the planks, blacks and parrels squealed from
aloft, canvas flapped, and a general pandemonium prevailed.</p>

<p>I have never seen men so deficient in self-control. The entire
ship's company, including the police officers, surged up and down
the deck like a herd of bullocks. They gibbered, they gesticulated,
they shouted; they craned over the side&mdash;though what the deuce
they expected to see there but water I can't imagine&mdash;and one,
the second mate, I believe, actually burst into tears. And all
because the <i>Anna</i> had taken the ground on one of those
"shoals and sandts" that the captain held in such detestation.</p>

<p>However, there she was, immovably seated on a sand bank with a
falling tide; and there she would undoubtedly remain until the
returning water rose and lifted her off. Of course, if a strong
breeze should spring up from the east&mdash;or anywhere else, for
that matter&mdash;she would undergo a rapid conversion into
driftwood; but at present the breeze was of the lightest and the
sea quite calm, save for a tiny popple of wavelets.</p>

<p>Gradually the excitement subsided, at least to some extent. The
sails were snugged down, the sidelights taken in and an anchor
light hoisted, which activities seemed to relieve the emotional
tension. But no one turned in. The police officers were excessively
nervous, the captain was in despair, and the sailors were rather
more uneasy than sailors ordinarily are with "the shore on
board."</p>

<p>To me, of course, the accident was an acceptable respite and
even offered a faint chance of escape. If the ship should go to
pieces, so much the better. I was an excellent swimmer and had no
doubt that, with the aid of some buoyant object, such as the cask
on which I was seated, I could keep afloat until some passing
vessel should pick me up. I turned over in my mind the exact
procedure that I should follow in such a contingency, and
considered whether, with the support of the floating cask, I could
possibly reach the shore. And then, from the possibility of the
ship breaking up, my mind passed naturally to the consideration of
what I should do if she did not break up.</p>

<p>The tide turned at about one o'clock. The swirling and bubbling
against the port side gradually died away and after an interval
began to make itself heard from the starboard side. I looked about
me with a new interest. The police officers were seated on the main
hatch&mdash;no more camp stools for them!&mdash;hunched up and
evidently dozing. The captain had retired temporarily to his cabin;
the crew were sitting about, half or wholly asleep, and, in the
first confusion, my guard had abandoned his post and had forgotten
to return.</p>

<p>The only boat that the ship carried rested in chocks on the
booms, with a canvas cover laced on and a pile of raffle heaped on
top. It would take a quarter of an hour at least to get her in the
water. The tide was now running up strongly, and a mile or so away
upstream I could see a light that winked in and out at regular
intervals&mdash;a gas-buoy, beyond all doubt, for I had seen it in
the same place ever since we ran aground. That would furnish a
guiding mark and perhaps a support as well.</p>

<p>Why not? It was a bit of a risk; but anything was better than a
Russian prison.</p>

<p>With a last look round, I quickly slipped off my boots and then
rose silently, and, picking up the little empty cask, crept
stealthily across to the bulwark. With some difficulty, I climbed
up and got astride the rail; but I suppose that, being hampered by
the cask, I must have made some slight noise, for, just as I was
getting my other leg over, some idiot of a seaman saw me and began
to bleat aloud. Instantly, of course, every imbecile on deck
started to his feet and a universal howl arose. There was no time
for nice manoeuvres. I dropped the cask into the sea, and, catching
my heels on the top side moulding, took a header and struck out
underwater towards the ship's stern, round which I had noticed the
tide stream swirling strongly. When I came up, I was just abreast
of the rudder; and the first thing of which I was sensible was a
rapid succession of pistol shots, mingled with a vocal hubbub such
as one might have expected to hear at the foot of the Tower of
Babel on Saturday afternoon when the hands were being paid off. I
clung to the rudder for a few moments to get a good deep breath,
and watched the cask&mdash;which was apparently the mark of the not
very expert shooters&mdash;as it gyrated in the eddy and slowly
drifted out of range. Then I dived below again and struck out in
the same direction, keeping under the surface as long as my breath
would hold out.</p>

<p>When I came up again the ship was about twenty yards away and
receding rapidly as I was borne along on the tide. The marksmen
were still popping away briskly, and, by the instantaneous flashes
and the glimmer of the anchor light, I could make out a huddle of
heads at the bulwark rail, all apparently staring at the cask, by
which I judged that no one had yet succeeded in hitting it. I also
got a glimpse of a party of men up on the booms clearing away the
raffle from the boat; and then, as a further precaution, I quietly
sank below the surface for another half-minute.</p>

<p>On my third emergence the ship had faded to a large, dark shape
relieved by the yellow spark of the anchor light. Occasional
flashes accompanied by sharp reports still burst out sporadically,
but their diminishing frequency suggested that ammunition was
running short. The excited babbling of many voices and a loud
clatter suggested that strenuous efforts were being made to get the
boat ready for launching, and hinted to me that any attempt on my
part to recover the cask would be unwise; that it would, in fact,
be desirable to get as far from it as possible. Accordingly, taking
my direction from the ship's anchor light, I struck out across the
tide, paddling very gently, however, to avoid unnecessary
fatigue.</p>

<p>Gradually the ship faded away into the darkness until her
position could be made out only by the glimmer of her anchor light.
The pistol shots ceased and the clamour from her deck grew faint
with the distance. I ceased from all effort beyond what was
necessary barely to keep my head above the surface and let myself
just drift on the tide. I was, so far, not at all fatigued. The
water was comparatively warm and the slight ripple on the surface
was not enough to cause any difficulty.</p>

<p>Still, it was not quite what I had bargained for. I had intended
to float quietly, hanging on to the cask until daylight came and
someone saw me. Now I must keep afloat by my own efforts until I
was picked up or found something to support me. And realizing this
with sudden anxiety&mdash;for hitherto I had been entirely occupied
in getting away from the ship&mdash;I turned my attention to the
floating light that I had seen from the deck. From my low position,
with my eyes but a few inches from the surface of the water, I had
at first lost sight of it entirely, but now I began to catch an
occasional glimpse of it over my low horizon; and I was rather
dismayed to notice that it did not seem appreciably nearer.
Apparently it was a good deal farther off than I had thought.</p>

<p>The time slipped away; it seemed to me that hours passed. And
still I drifted on, encompassed by an illimitable dark void, with
the inky ripples playing about my chin. An awesome silence was over
the dark sea, a silence that seemed the more intense for the
lonesome sounds that disturbed it at long intervals; the hoot of
some distant steamer's whistle, or the melancholy scream of a gull.
The light of the gas-buoy was now continuously visible, winking
monotonously every few seconds, but still it looked little nearer
than before. And now a new anxiety arose. Was I approaching the
buoy in a direct line? If not, I should be swept past it by the
tide, and then&mdash;but I refused to think of this contingency.
Keeping my face steadily towards the light I maintained a slow and
easy breaststroke. I could do no more in the absence of a second
light to give the direction of my movement.</p>

<p>Quite suddenly, as it seemed, the light loomed up big and
bright. I could see the lantern distinctly. I could even see the
shutter. And, as I stopped paddling for a moment, I could see
something less agreeable. The light seemed to be passing across to
my left. In a few moments more I should be swept past it and my
last hope would be gone; and as I realized this, I realized, too,
that I was growing numb and weak. Setting my teeth, I turned on my
side and struck out with all my remaining strength towards the
space to the left of the buoy.</p>

<p>The lantern towered above me. The great black shape rushed out
of the darkness, looking weird and gigantic. It closed in nearer
and nearer&mdash; and then began to sweep across in front of me.
With a gasp of despair, I gave a final stroke, and, as the great
shadowy form swept past, I clutched at it frantically and my
fingers closed on a handful of slippery seaweed.</p>

<p>The common bladderwrack (<i>Fucus vesiculosus</i>) is not a
handsome plant, but to me it is, and will ever be, more precious
than the Rose of Sharon or the Lily of the Valley; for its
crackling, leathery fronds stood between me and a watery grave. As
I grasped that slimy handful, the tide swung me round and bumped me
against the buoy and my free hand clutched a barnacle-encrusted
iron bar. That bar, I found, was the bottom rung of a rough ladder,
fitted for the convenience of the Trinity House men when they are
recharging the buoy or attending to the lantern; and, having made
this discovery, I reached for the next rung and thankfully hauled
myself up, dripping and shivering, to the shoulder of the buoy.</p>

<p>It was bitterly cold&mdash;at least, it seemed so; though the
breeze that blew on my drenched clothing was really warm. But I was
safe; unless the <i>Anna'</i>s boat should come so far and hit this
particular spot, which was infinitely unlikely. So I sat, with
chattering teeth, physically wretched though secure and cheerful,
on the flat shoulder of the buoy, with my feet on the ladder,
holding on by the cage that supported the lantern; on which cage I
was able to make out the mystical inscription: "East Spaniard."</p>

<p>I had resigned myself to the idea of hanging on until daylight
should enable me to signal to some passing vessel. Without hope or
expectation of release I clung to the iron cage, growing colder and
colder, and listened to the wash of the ripples against the buoy
and the monotonous click of the shutter in the lantern above me;
these, and the occasional scream of a gull being the only sounds
that broke the dreary silence, until I had been on the buoy for
what seemed like several hours. Then my ear caught some new sounds,
thin and faint at first, but gradually increasing in distinctness
as if their source was approaching; the unmistakable sound of oars
working in wide tholes, with long pauses filled by heavy splashes,
bumpings and the murmur of voices, as yet afar off. I listened
intently. Though wildly improbable, it was not actually impossible
that this might be the <i>Anna's</i> boat still searching for a
cask and a fugitive; and if it should be, I might have to get into
the water again to dodge behind the buoy.</p>

<p>The sounds approached very gradually, with short spells of
rowing and long intervals of bumping, splashing and the mumble of
undistinguishable talk. But suddenly the silence of the sea was
broken by a fine brassy voice lifting itself up in song:</p>

<p>"Oh! I love to think of the day when I was young, Tiddley
um!"</p>

<p>My heart leapt. Sweeter to me than a siren's song&mdash;and much
more to the purpose&mdash;were those homely words, bellowed out in
a voice like that of an adolescent calf. Gathering my strength for
a mighty shout, I let off a feeble, quavering croak.</p>

<p>"Boat ahoy!"</p>

<p>The caroller stopped short&mdash;on the word "Tiddley"&mdash;and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"J'ear that, Joe?"</p>

<p>"Ay," replied a second voice. "That was someone a-hailing, that
was."</p>

<p>I croaked again; my chattering teeth giving a fine tremolo
effect.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" roared the first man. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I'm overboard," I squawked; "hanging on the gas-buoy."</p>

<p>"Right-O, mate," was the cheering rejoinder. "Hang on a bit
longer until I gets my anchor up."</p>

<p>There was a brief pause, a splash and a rumble, and then I heard
the oars plied with a will. The sounds rapidly grew louder, and
presently the light of the buoy's lantern fell on a boat, urged
forward by two men in yellow oilskins who stood up at their oars
facing towards me. As she swept alongside, the forward rower helped
me to scramble off the buoy&mdash;for I was stiff with the
cold&mdash;and then pushed clear.</p>

<p>"Where are you from, mate?" he asked.</p>

<p>I replied, as well as my chattering jaws would let me,
"Ca-cac-anterbury."</p>

<p>"Lor!" was the astonished comment of my rescuer.</p>

<p>"What's he say, Tom?" asked the other man.</p>

<p>"Says he dropped overboard from Canterbury."</p>

<p>"My eye!" exclaimed the other. "He must have had some way on
him."</p>

<p>Not wishing to mislead my friends, I attempted to explain, but
failed miserably, for my teeth were rattling like castanets. Then
the hospitable Tom peeled off his long oilskin coat, and having
hustled me into it, clapped his sou'wester on my head and tied the
flaps over my ears.</p>

<p>"It's lucky for you as we happened to come down on the night
tide," he remarked as we paddled back to the fishing
ground&mdash;my friends were whelkers&mdash;"'tain't often as we
do. We likes the daylight for to pick up our floats. Feelin' a bit
warmer?"</p>

<p>I was feeling much warmer and somewhat like a pudding in its
cloth, for the oilskin was practically air-tight and "kept in all
the juices," as the cooks say. And as I revived I gave my friends a
full and true account of my adventures, to which they listened
open-mouthed in the intervals of hauling up and re-baiting the
whelk pots. Very soon a faint glow in the eastern sky heralded the
dawn and brightened by degrees until the calm sea was enveloped in
a primrose-coloured haze, out of which slowly emerged the shadowy
form of the barquentine, about three miles distant. Tom was the
first to observe her, and pointed her out with gleeful
derision.</p>

<p>"There's the old Rooshian basket, Joe. D'ye see? Why, blow me,
if they ain't been and sat her on the Pan Sand! Haw! Haw!" (The joy
of the angels over the repentant sinner is feeble compared with
that of the local expert over the blundering stranger.) "Seems to
be puttin' off a boat too."</p>

<p>They were; and I watched that boat with some anxiety, wondering
how many more whelk pots remained to be dealt with. At first a mere
speck, she crept steadily towards us on the flowing tide until I
was able to make out details; the rag of sail, like a charwoman's
apron, the two strenuous rowers and three men in the stern. These
latter interested me especially. They did not look like sailors;
and when a gleam of sunlight, reflected from the face of one of
them, revealed a pair of spectacles, I had no doubt that I was
looking on Herr von Bommel.</p>

<p>"Last pot, Tom," said Joe, hauling it into the boat and picking
out the misguided whelks. "Them Rooshians seem to be a-hailin' of
us."</p>

<p>I had already noticed the fact. Herr von Bommel was standing up
waving a handkerchief and over the sea came a sound like the voice
of an asthmatic merman.</p>

<p>The last pot was baited and sunk; the anchor was hove up and the
tiller shipped; and then the great brown lug slid up the mast. The
<i>Anna'</i>s boat was now hardly a couple of hundred yards distant
and her crew and passengers were bellowing in concert. Three
foreign gentlemen wanted a passage to Whitstable, and wanted it
badly. But the fishermen took no notice; and when Tom grasped the
tiller and Joe hauled in the sheet, the big lug filled and the
water began to tinkle past the run. The <i>Anna'</i>s crew raised a
final, despairing howl and the rowers strained at their oars. But
our boat, though she hailed from Whitstable, was an East-country
craft, deep, beamy and double-ended; and when an East-coast
"Crabber" fills her enormous sail, you can take off your hat to
anything astern, except, perhaps, a Deal galley-punt. When I
climbed up the steep beach by Whitstable Pier and peeled off the
oilskin coat before making a run for the station, the <i>Anna'</i>s
boat was but a grey spot far out on the sea.</p>

<p>Some three hours later I sat by the coffee-room window of the
Falstaff Inn looking out lazily through the wire blind. A hot bath,
a dry suit and a colossal breakfast had induced a placid and
contemplative frame of mind which inclined me indolently to observe
the world without. And as I looked, three men crawled wearily along
the opposite side of the street, having apparently come from the
station. Opposite the inn, they paused, and the middle one, who
wore spectacles, produced a scrap of paper from his pocket, over
which they all pored with knitted brows. Then, as with one accord,
they all yawned prodigiously; the spectacled one pocketed the paper
and, slowly and languidly, they all went their way.</p>

<p>By which signs I gathered that the "secret code" of the Harp and
Cross was still undeciphered.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER THREE &mdash; THE SECRET
CHAMBER</h2>

<p class="first">IT is my firm and unalterable conviction that Izaak Walton was
an impostor. I am thinking, at the moment, of his observations on
the Fordidge trout, a mythical fish, "near the bigness of a
salmon," which is said to inhabit the River Stour in Kent. Very
ingenious and abstruse are old Izaak's explanations of the
suspicious fact that none of these leviathans of the deep have ever
been "caught with an angle;" but I can give a much simpler one.
There is no such fish. That was the conclusion that I reached after
a couple of evening's angling from the boat belonging to the Royal
George Inn, where I was now lodging; having had but a single bite
all the time, and even then only hauled up a fat-headed gudgeon who
grinned in my face and then dropped off the hook and swam away.
Fordidge trout, indeed! "I don't believe there's no sech a
person"&mdash;to borrow Mrs Gamp's immortal phrase.</p>

<p>Not that it really mattered to me. If it had, I suppose I should
not have baited my hook with three-quarters of a yard of garden
worm. But the old tub of a boat was restful, and secure, too. I
couldn't very well get pounced on unawares so long as I was moored
in midstream; and that was a consideration after what I had gone
through. So I sat in the boat, ostensibly to fish, but actually to
meditate.</p>

<p>I had plenty to meditate about. The material had been
accumulating since I came to Canterbury a little over a week ago.
In that short time I had been arrested by an English detective and
liberated; arrested again by the Russian Secret Police, and had
escaped. And now, to my certain knowledge, the Russian Police ere
still lurking in the neighbourhood, and the British detective had
developed the companionable qualities of Mary's little lamb.
Wherever I went, that detective was sure to go. I was continually
meeting him; and what made it worse was the offensive fiction that
he kept of not observing me.</p>

<p>Sergeant Burbler's proceedings were a puzzle to me. Did he still
believe that I was connected with the gang of foreign criminals who
had sheltered in the old manor house? It seemed impossible. But
there was another explanation of his adhesiveness. The sergeant and
I both believed that somewhere in that old manor house was
concealed the treasure deposited three centuries ago by Simon
Glynn; and each of us suspected the other of having some private
information on the subject. Could it be Simon Glynn's hoard to
which I was indebted for so much of the sergeant's society? It was
impossible to say. And here I raised my eyes&mdash;and beheld the
sergeant himself, angling from the bank.</p>

<p>He was at his old game, pretending not to see me. Which was
ridiculous; for there I was a most visible reality. But I wasn't
going to have any more of this nonsense. I watched him stick a lump
of cheese on his hook&mdash;in the hope, perhaps, that the Fordidge
trout favoured the purine-free diet&mdash;and when he had made his
cast, I addressed him by name. Then he pretended that he didn't
know me. Now I am no advocate for laxity in regard to etiquette;
but when two men have rolled round a room together, have dusted the
floor with one another, have prodded one another in the abdomen and
pulled out handfuls of one another's hair, I say that for either of
them to pretend that they are not acquainted is mere paltry
snobbery. I wasn't going to have it. But, as he seemed to have got
a bite, I waited to renew my attack.</p>

<p>I saw his line tighten. I watched him strike, and then begin to
wind in his winch as if he were playing a little barrel organ. I
saw him reach out stealthily for his landing net and crane over the
bank, and still I kept a discreet silence. It was only when I had
seen him disengage a waterlogged boot from his hook and rebait that
I ventured to reopen conversation.</p>

<p>"I'm getting quite used to being arrested now," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Burbler. "Who's been arresting you?"</p>

<p>"The Russian Police have had another go at me," I replied.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Burbler. "Why did they let you go?"</p>

<p>"They didn't. I let myself go."</p>

<p>That excited his curiosity so far that he asked for particulars.
I lashed the rudder over so as to give the boat a cast inshore and
proceeded to give him a detailed account of those astonishing
events that culminated in my escape from the Russian timber ship.
He was profoundly interested in my adventures; there was no doubt
of that. So much so that when I had finished my story I ventured to
ask him a question or two about himself.</p>

<p>"You don't suppose that that gang of crooks is still in this
neighbourhood, do you?"</p>

<p>"Have I ever said I did?" was his Scottesque reply.</p>

<p>"No: but as you are remaining in neighbourhood yourself, I
thought that, perhaps&mdash;well, that you might have some object
in doing so."</p>

<p>"Sounds reasonable," he admitted, dryly. Then, after a brief
pause, he remarked: "You seem to be putting in a bit of time in the
neighbourhood yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered. "I have to superintend some repairs of Elham
Manor House."</p>

<p>"You're taking your time about it," said he.</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't begun. I'm waiting to consult with our new tenant
and he hasn't turned up yet. I can't write to him because I don't
know where he is staying. He's an American&mdash;Mr Jezreel P
Damper&mdash;and these rich Americans are rather erratic in their
movements."</p>

<p>"What sort of repairs are you going to do?" Burbler asked
carelessly.</p>

<p>Now, here I seemed to see an opportunity for pumping the
taciturn detective as to his object in shadowing me in this
singular manner. Accordingly, I replied, putting some slight
tension on the actual facts:</p>

<p>"The repairs will probably involve some structural alterations.
It's an old house, you know, and it may need to be modernized a
little."</p>

<p>He took the bait with avidity&mdash;unlike the Fordidge trout.
His sour visage brightened with an ingratiating smile as he
exclaimed enthusiastically:</p>

<p>"How very interesting! Excuse my curiosity, but old buildings
are rather a hobby of mine. Have you decided on any particular
structural alterations?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied, cramming the bait into his gizzard with both
hands, so to speak; "I have hardly looked at the house yet."</p>

<p>"Really!" he exclaimed. "Really! Might I just step into your
boat? More convenient for conversation, you know." And when I had
edged inshore and let him scramble on board with his neglected
tackle, he continued: "So you haven't really looked over the house
yet? I wonder at that. Don't you think it would be wise to make a
thorough inspection so as to be ready for your tenant when he
arrives?"</p>

<p>As a matter of fact I had thought so. But since my two
encounters with the Russian Secret Police, I had been rather shy of
Elham Manor. I knew that they were watching it and that they had
once obtained access to it; and the lonely old house was an awkward
place in which to be caught by gentry of that kind. I explained
this to the sergeant&mdash;omitting to mention, however, that I had
taken to carrying a revolver since my last adventure. Again he rose
joyously like a hungry perch.</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you, Mr Cobb"&mdash;the rascal let my name
drop inadvertently. "It would be most unwise of you to venture into
the house alone. But if you want to look over it, I shall be
delighted to accompany you: and, as I always carry a regulation
revolver, you will be perfectly safe. What do you say?"</p>

<p>I didn't quite know what to say. I wanted to look over the house
but I didn't particularly want Burbler; but still less did I want
to be haled off to some Russian gaol. In the end I accepted
Burbler's offer, resolving to keep an eye on him in case he had any
private information about Simon Glynn's treasure.</p>

<p>"When would you like me to come with you?" he asked briskly.</p>

<p>"Any time you like," said I.</p>

<p>"Well, why not now? There are several hours of daylight
left."</p>

<p>He tried to disguise his eagerness and failed miserably.
Obviously he was, as Mr Bumble would have said, "on broken bottles"
with anxiety to start.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to have a try for the other boot?" I asked
callously.</p>

<p>He cast a baleful glance at his last catch, which lay stranded
on the bank, and, without reply other than a sour smile, proceeded
to heave up our little hairpin of an anchor. A few minutes later we
landed at the stairs belonging to the Royal George and passed
unmolested through the garden and taproom out into the road.</p>

<p>As we trudged along together many thoughts passed through my
mind. Obviously the sergeant was hot on the scent of Simon Glynn's
hoard and proposed to use me as a cat's-paw to hook it out of its
hiding place. But the question was, how much did he know? Had he
some information about it that I had not? If so, I must watch him
closely. As to my own knowledge on the subject, it was summed up in
a passage in Boteler's "Manor Houses of Kent," which I had looked
up at the Public Library in Canterbury. It read thus:</p>
<br>

<p class="quote">"In 1734, during some repairs, an aumbry was discovered behind
the panelling of the dining room and in this was found a curious
silver mirror, probably Glynn's own handiwork, the frame of which
bore this strange inscription:</p>

<p class="quote">"A harp and a Cross and good redd golde Beneath ye cross with ye
harp full nigh, Ankores three atte ye foot of a tree And a Maid
from ye sea on high. Take itt. 'Tis thine. Others have stepped
over.</p>

<p class="quote">"Simon Glynn, 1683."</p>
<br>

<p>"The meaning of this inscription has never been ascertained. The
gateposts of Elham Manor House bear a harp and a cross
respectively, and above the porch is a statue of a young Puritan
lady, presumably Mistress Glynn. Hence it has been inferred that
the lines refer to a treasure buried under the gatepost which bears
the cross; but repeated excavations have failed to discover any
such treasure.</p>

<p>"Simon Glynn is said to have had a mania for secret hiding
places. Tradition speaks of several in the manor house&mdash;in one
of which Axell, the regicide, is said to have lain concealed for
some time&mdash;but their position (if they ever existed) has been
forgotten. Perhaps Glynn's hoard is still lying in some forgotten,
secret strongroom."</p>

<p>Thus the learned Boteler. He hadn't very much to tell excepting
that the treasure was still "untrove." But one thing was clear to
me: the people who had dug under the gatepost were fools. If the
meaning of the doggerel had been as simple as that, Simon might as
well have laid his treasure in the road for the first passing
imbecile to pick up. There was some deeper meaning in that crude
jingle and it must be my business to fathom it&mdash;unless Burbler
had done so already.</p>

<p>These reflections brought us to the gates of the manor house;
and here the sergeant halted to gaze reflectively at the traces of
the "repeated excavations" and at the statue in its niche above the
porch.</p>

<p>"I wonder who she was," he said, nodding at the statue. "Do you
think she looks like an Englishwoman?"</p>

<p>It was a transparent question. He was clearly thinking of "a
Maid from the sea on high." But, as it was not my business to
enlighten him, I expressed ambiguous doubts, and we passed up the
flagged path to the main door, into which I inserted the key.</p>

<p>For some time we rambled rather aimlessly through the rooms,
waking the echoes with our footfalls on the massive oak floors. It
was an eerie place, full of odd corners, little flights of stairs
and great built-in cupboards. No two rooms seemed to be on the same
level. It was a step or two up or down every time. And every room
appeared to be set at an angle to its fellow; a wasteful
arrangement as regards space, but an excellent one for a builder
whose hobby happened to be secret hiding places.</p>

<p>I watched Burbler narrowly&mdash;and found him watching me. But
all the same, his eye travelled inquisitively towards each cupboard
or closet that we passed.</p>

<p>"Don't you think this old panelling is rather a mistake?" said
he, rapping at it with his knuckles. "Makes the place so dark, you
know."</p>

<p>"It does," I agreed. "Perhaps I may have some of it down and
plaster the walls if our tenant agrees." This, I regret to say, was
a sheer falsehood. Nothing would have induced me to mutilate the
fine old house. But the tarradiddle served its purpose, for Burbler
exclaimed excitedly:</p>

<p>"Shall you really? I hope you will allow me to be present when
it is done. I am so very much interested in old buildings. And
besides," he added, as a brilliant afterthought, "it is quite
possible that there may be some of the stolen property hidden here.
That St Petersburg-Chicago gang used this house for some time, you
know."</p>

<p>"You don't suppose they are hanging about here still, do you?" I
asked.</p>

<p>Burbler looked about him&mdash;we were in the large drawing room
at the time&mdash;and listened as if apprehensive of eavesdroppers.
Then he replied:</p>

<p>"I don't personally. But they haven't turned up anywhere else;
and my orders are to keep a watch on this house until they are run
to earth or seen somewhere else. So, of course, I ought to be
present when any structural alterations are made here, in case they
have secreted the booty here. And, between you and me, Mr Cobb, it
wouldn't be a bad plan, if you thought of doing away with that
panelling, for us to take some of it down ourselves, and avoid the
inconvenience of inquisitive workmen. What do you say?"</p>

<p>I said I would think the matter over; and at that he was content
to leave it for the present. But from that moment he developed a
tendency to lag behind or stray away on various pretences: and
whenever he did so, there came from adjoining rooms sundry
mysterious tappings, as if some gigantic woodpecker had got loose
in the house. But nothing of special interest occurred until we
entered a large room at the back of the building, distinguished by
peculiarly fine woodwork. It was a rather uncanny room, in spite of
its beauty, for its panelling was carved throughout in high relief
with very realistic grotesque figures, which seemed to start out
from the walls in a manner that was really quite disturbing. And
more alarming still was the broad, carved oak frieze that
surmounted the walls below the heavy cornice, of which the chief
ornament was a row of life-size masks, each one different from the
others, and all, apparently, grotesque portraits of actual persons.
The aspect of those masks was most diabolical. They grinned, they
scowled, they sneered, and some of them stuck out their tongues;
and their eyes&mdash;represented by deep-sunk holes&mdash;seemed to
leer down on us with positively devilish malice. I wouldn't have
lived in that room for a thousand a year.</p>

<p>But this was not all. A further attraction in that ghostly
apartment was a large armoire or cupboard of sepulchral aspect,
built into the wall. I opened one of the folding doors and looked
in; and then I shut it again rather quickly and turned away with as
careless and uninterested a manner as I could assume at such short
notice. For I had observed that it was fitted with massive, fixed
shelves. Now everybody who knows anything about secret chambers is
familiar with the cupboard with the sliding shelf that conceals a
movable panel. Of course I couldn't tell whether any of these
shelves would slide out; but they looked uncommonly likely, and I
thought I should prefer to try when I was alone. So I turned away
and endeavoured to distract the sergeant's attention from the
cupboard.</p>

<p>But, bless you! he didn't want any distracting. Not he! The one
plain and palpable fact was that Sergeant Burbler hadn't noticed
the cupboard at all. He stared at the walls and the ceiling and the
floor, but the cupboard had totally escaped his observation. He
never looked at it&mdash; after the first glance.</p>

<p>We sauntered through a doorway into an adjoining room; a
smallish chamber with no outlet save by the door by which we had
entered, unless there was some concealed door in the panelling.
Here we remained for a minute or two rapping at the wainscot and
examining the window seat, and then Burbler strolled back into the
other room "to have another look at those quaint figures on the
walls." I continued my investigations, which presently brought me
to the disproportionately large open fireplace, the brick back of
which I proceeded to test by a series of interrogatory thumps. It
all sounded solid enough, but when I had delivered an extra heavy
thump on the left-hand side, to my astonishment the brickwork
itself began to move. A square patch, cleverly concealed by the
joints between the bricks, swung round slightly on its centre,
being evidently balanced on a pivot. I hastily closed it by pushing
at the opposite end and then stole towards the door, with the
intention of luring the sergeant to some distant part of the house
and then returning alone to investigate. But Burbler was beforehand
with me. As I approached the door it closed softly and a bolt was
shot on the outside. The perfidious detective had bolted me in.</p>

<p>It was a quaint situation. With a self-satisfied grin I gave a
thump or two on the door for the sake of appearances and then stole
on tiptoe back to the fireplace. A hearty shove at the left side of
the chimney back sent the panel of brickwork swinging on its pivot
and disclosed a dark opening, Before entering I cautiously examined
the mechanism, which was simple enough. The false brickwork was
fixed to massive oak planks which revolved, as I have said, on
pivots. There was no secret spring, but there was a strong bolt on
the inside with which a fugitive could fix the panel immovably, and
a handle with which to pull it open from within. Massive as it was,
it moved quite easily and without a sound, which seemed strange,
considering the long years of disuse &mdash;until one examined the
pivot and found it smooth and bright and anointed with oil that was
certainly not two and a half centuries old.</p>

<p>I stepped into the opening and shut the panel, fixing it with
the bolt and reflecting gleefully on the surprise that Burbler
would get when he came to let me out of the room. Striking a wax
match, I saw a tiny brick staircase, not more than two feet wide,
apparently built in the thickness of the wall, and began to ascend
it with extreme caution&mdash; for one has to beware of "mousetrap
staircases" in these old hiding holes. At the top was a passage or
gallery of the same width, and on the right hand a small door. The
latter I pushed open and entered a small chamber, about five feet
by ten, well lighted from above by a false chimney, up which I
peered, and caught the eye of a starling who was perched on top.
The little room was furnished with an antique folding table, a
fixed bench and a fine oaken chair&mdash;which must have been built
in the room, since it was too large to come up the stairs, and
which would have electrified Wardour Street. And that was
all&mdash; excepting two blatantly modern cabin trunks.</p>

<p>At those two trunks I stared open-mouthed; and especially at the
smaller of the two. For I had seen it before. It was, in fact, the
identical trunk that I had seen when I first visited the old manor
house. I knew what it contained. It was crammed with the costly
booty of those rascals, the St Petersburg-Chicago gang. Diamonds,
rubies, emeralds and golden baubles&mdash;a bushel or so of
them&mdash;were here before me. They were mine for the mere taking!
What an opportunity for a dishonest man! But I am not a dishonest
man. And, incidentally, the trunk was now secured with a massive
padlock.</p>

<p>When I had tested the weight of the two trunks, and found the
smaller one considerably the heavier, I came out of the room and
proceeded to explore the gallery. It was not quite dark. On the
right-hand wall were a number of little circles of light; and as I
stole silently along the brick floor, I was able to trace these
patches of light to their source, which was a series of little
round holes in the left-hand wall. A single glance at these told me
what they were. They were the eye-holes of those appalling masks in
the large room, and their purpose was obviously to enable a
fugitive to watch and listen to the talk of pursuers or traitors in
the room below.</p>

<p>I applied my eye to one of the holes and found that it commanded
quite a large circular area; and at the centre of the circle was
Detective-Sergeant Burbler. He had noticed the cupboard at last. In
fact he had both the doors wide open and was tugging frantically at
the shelves.</p>

<p>But he didn't seem to have had much luck. He had, apparently,
begun at the bottom and tried them all in turn; and none of them
had budged a hair's breadth. I watched him with a pitying smile. He
had now come to the top shelf but one, and, as it was a little
above his reach, he had to stand on a lower shelf to get hold of
it. He tried it first quite gently, then more vigorously, and, as
it still refused to move, he planted one foot against an upper
shelf and tugged with might and main. And then it did move; and so
did he. He shot away like a spring-jack and came down on his back
with a bang that shook the house and the detached shelf clutched
triumphantly in his paws.</p>

<p>He got up, stroking himself delicately and soliloquizing not at
all delicately. And at that moment a quick footfall was heard
approaching from an adjacent room. Burbler snatched up the shelf
and made frenzied efforts to replace it. But if it had been
difficult to get it out, it was impossible to get it back. It
certainly entered its grooves&mdash;just enough to prevent the
doors from shutting; and there it stuck, refusing to move either
way. And there it still was when a stranger entered the room and
swam into the magic circle of my field of vision.</p>

<p>A stern and wrathful-looking man was the newcomer, with a red
face and a very large chin, and his manner was not more
conciliatory than his appearance.</p>

<p>"What the deuce is the meaning of this, sir?" he demanded in a
rasping voice and with a distinct American accent. "Who are you?
and what are you doing in this house?"</p>

<p>I have never seen a man look such an unutterable fool as Burbler
did at that moment. But he pulled himself together a little and
retorted:</p>

<p>"I might ask the same question. Who are <i>you?</i> and what are
<i>you</i> doing here?"</p>

<p>"You might," said the stranger. "I can quite believe it of you.
But I'll tell you who I am. I am the tenant of this house and my
name is Damper, if you want to know; Jezreel P Damper."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Burbler; "I've heard Mr Cobb speak of you."</p>

<p>"Have you?" replied Damper. "Well, who are you, anyway?"</p>

<p>"I'm a police officer, sir," said Burbler, with an abortive
attempt to be impressive. "I have instructions to watch this house,
as certain suspicious characters are known to have harboured in
it."</p>

<p>"Were you 'instructed' to destroy the landlord's fixtures?"
asked Damper, glaring at the displaced shelf.</p>

<p>Burbler began a windy explanation with certain references to
stolen property, but Damper cut him short.</p>

<p>"Is Mr Cobb in the house?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He was here a minute ago," replied Burbler. "He went into the
next room. Perhaps he's there still." It did seem rather likely
under the circumstances; but when the sergeant had slipped back the
rusty bolt and looked into the room he evidently got a severe
shock, for he came back looking very blank and puzzled.</p>

<p>"He seems to have gone away," he mumbled, "but I expect he'll be
back presently."</p>

<p>"Now see here," said Damper. "That door was bolted and there
isn't any other. I guess you've been dreaming about Mr Cobb."</p>

<p>"I assure you, sir," protested Burbler, "that he was here a
minute ago; and I have his full authority to search the premises
thoroughly."</p>

<p>Of course, that was a barefaced untruth, and I couldn't allow it
to pass. Lifting up my voice, I shouted:</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind, sergeant. I gave you no authority
whatever."</p>

<p>My word! but that gave Burbler a start! He jumped like a cat
that has sat down on an exploding cracker, and tried to look in all
directions at once. But if Burbler was startled, Mr Damper was
positively petrified; and, to be sure, it is a little disturbing to
an incoming tenant to hear voices issuing apparently from the walls
or ceiling.</p>

<p>"Would you mind stepping this way, Mr Cobb," said the sergeant,
after looking into the cupboard and up the chimney. I thought it
about time to make my appearance on the scene, and accordingly
retraced my steps along the passage, down the stairs and out
through the concealed entrance, and finally shattered the
sergeant's nerves by emerging from the room which he had just seen
to be empty.</p>

<p>Of course, Burbler had to be told about the box of "swag," so I
gave him the information forthwith; on which he dived jubilantly
into the smaller room. But Mr Damper was much less pleased. He
followed us with a distinctly worried expression and finally
remarked:</p>

<p>"This is extremely disagreeable for me, Mr Cobb. The presence of
this stolen property in the house naturally suggests that the
thieves themselves are not far off and that they have access to the
premises."</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't be uneasy, sir," said Burbler. "We shall soon
clear the rascals out of this. Now, Mr Cobb, if you please."</p>

<p>I pushed the square of brickwork open, and entering, preceded
the sergeant up the stairs to the secret chamber. He pounced
gleefully on the smaller trunk and proceeded to drag it away down
the stairs, haughtily refusing my proffered assistance. I saw him
struggle out with it through the opening, I heard him dump it down
on the floor, and then he returned for the larger trunk.</p>

<p>"Hadn't I better lend you a hand?" said I.</p>

<p>"Be good enough, sir, not to interfere," he replied stiffly.
"This is official business."</p>

<p>I watched him lumber out with the trunk and heard him clatter
down the stairs, which were now quite dark, owing, as I supposed,
to his having pulled the panel to as he returned. When he reached
the bottom there was a long pause, filled in with a sound of
fumbling and low-toned profane soliloquy. At length he called out,
with a sudden return to civility:</p>

<p>"Just step down here, Mr Cobb. You know how this thing goes
better than I do."</p>

<p>I skipped down the narrow stairs with alacrity and a little
uneasiness.</p>

<p>"It's quite simple," I said. "You just catch hold of this handle
and pull."</p>

<p>"That's what I've been doing," growled Burbler.</p>

<p>I seized the handle and pulled at it vigorously; but the false
door was as immovable as the Great Pyramid. Apparently some secret
catch had released itself. I lit a wax match and examined the back
of the panel, but without finding anything that could explain the
phenomenon, while Burbler shouted to Mr Damper to give a good shove
from the outside.</p>

<p>"Are you there, Mr Damper?" roared Burbler.</p>

<p>Apparently he was not, or was unable to hear us, for we heard no
reply. Then we both scampered up the stairs in a mighty
twitter&mdash;for it was really an exceedingly awkward
situation&mdash;and made for the gallery, where each of us glued
his eye to one of the peepholes preparatory to calling out. And
then&mdash;Oh! what a sight was there, my countrymen! Mr Jezreel P
Damper was certainly in full view, and no longer stern-faced and
worried, but bland and smiling. But there were two other gentlemen
also; one of whom&mdash;who looked, as to his hair, like a
professional pianist&mdash;was at that very moment hoisting the
precious cabin trunk on to his shoulder with the other man's
aid.</p>

<p>"Hi! there!" shouted Burbler. "What are you doing with that
trunk?"</p>

<p>Mr Damper looked up with a gracious smile. "That you, Burbey?"
he asked. "Sorry I can't see your face. Let me introduce you to my
two friends, Polopsky and Schneider. Turn round, Polly, and let the
gentlemen see your beautiful hair."</p>

<p>"You infernal scoundrel!" shrieked Burbler. "I suppose you are
Jacob Mifflin?"</p>

<p>"You've hit it, sonny. You have indeed. Right in the middle.
Clever boy!" and Mr Damper&mdash;or Mifflin&mdash;made a show, in
pantomime, of patting Burbler on the head.</p>

<p>"You're not going to leave us locked up here to starve, are
you?" demanded the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Mifflin, "we just hate leaving you behind,
sonny, but I guess we haven't enough accommodation to take you with
us. But you'll be happy enough. You've got furnished apartments and
board&mdash;there's a week's provisions in that trunk&mdash;and we
shall send on the keys of the house with a little note to Mr Cobb's
agent in Canterbury."</p>

<p>"When?" I shouted.</p>

<p>"Quite soon, Mr Cobb. Perhaps we may send them tonight. We don't
wish to inconvenience you. Oh, and there's another little matter,
Mr Cobb. I inferred from the interesting conversation that I
happened to overhear just now in the big drawing room that you and
the sergeant are looking around for some antique curios. Well,
you'll find some exceedingly remarkable ones in that very room,
which we are leaving behind for want of transport facilities. The
right-hand column under the arch there is a concealed door. It
isn't fastened. Give a good pull at the left corner and it will
come open. The contents of the hiding place are yours for the
taking. And now I must really tear myself away. Ta-ta, dear
friends!"</p>

<p>He took off his hat with a flourish and made us an elaborate
bow; and then he moved away out of our circle of vision and we
heard his footsteps gradually die away in the distance.</p>

<p>"Well," said Burbler, unglueing his eye at length, "this is a
pretty mess that you've got us into!"</p>

<p>I was too disgusted to reply. Here I was, sealed up in this
infernal hiding hole, my very life dependent on the doubtful
goodwill of a band of ruffians. And why? Simply because this
inquisitive booby of a policeman must go poking his nose into
places where he had no business. It was abominable.</p>

<p>The sergeant and I crept out of the gallery, and our first
proceeding was to fetch up the provision trunk. It was secured only
with spring catches, and when we had unfastened these we found an
ample supply of food and drink, including a gallon can of beer and
another of water, all neatly packed in compartments. Apparently the
gang had intended to remain in residence here for some time longer
and had been compelled to migrate only by Burbler's ridiculous
prowlings and his absurd suggestions&mdash;overheard by
them&mdash;of structural alterations. We inaugurated our tenancy by
a good meal, and, as the light was now failing, we lit one of the
candles that we had found in the trunk and fell to discussing our
unsatisfactory situation.</p>

<p>"If those scoundrels don't take any measures to get us
released," said I, "we shall have to make some effort to break out
or else climb up the chimney."</p>

<p>Burbler held the candle aloft and peered up the smooth-sided
shaft.</p>

<p>"No," he said, shaking his head; "there's nothing to hold on by.
But Mifflin will keep his word, or else why should he have told us
of that stuff in the hiding hole? I wonder what it is, by the way.
Can't be of much value, or they wouldn't have left it behind."</p>

<p>I agreed that this was self-evident, and we returned to the
question of a possible escape but without reaching any conclusion,
though we talked far into the night. Finally we blew out the candle
and settled ourselves for the night, Burbler on the fixed bench and
I in the arm-chair.</p>

<p>It was about ten o'clock on the following morning when the
sergeant and I, sitting disconsolately in our prison, were thrilled
by a hollow "boom" that sounded infinitely distant.</p>

<p>"By gum!" exclaimed Burbler, "that was the front door!"</p>

<p>He sprang up and made for the gallery like a rabbit scuttling
for its burrow, and I followed. Very soon the heavenly sound of a
pair of creaky boots was borne to our ears and then a tremulous
voice called out: "Mr Cobb! Are you here?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" I howled. "I'm here!"</p>

<p>As a guide to my exact locality, I must admit that this was not
particularly lucid. But the boots continued to approach, and at
length there appeared in my circle of vision a very nervous-looking
young man, who stared about him apprehensively as he walked.</p>

<p>"Where are you, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Here!" roared Burbler; on which the young man started violently
and began to turn round like a joint of meat on a roasting-jack,
staring at the walls as he turned.</p>

<p>"Would you go into the next room," said I, "and see if there is
anything against the back of the fireplace?"</p>

<p>"Yessir!" he replied; and away he went like a man in a dream.
But he was back in a few moments with a simple and encouraging
report.</p>

<p>"There's a thick walking stick, sir, jammed under the chimney
breast. Shall I remove it, sir?"</p>

<p>"If you please," I answered, and Burbler and I made our way back
along the gallery and down the little staircase. As we reached the
bottom, I grasped the handle and gave a tentative pull. Oh, joy!
Oh, unutterable relief! It yielded at once, and the panel of
brickwork swung readily open. Our imprisonment was at an end. As I
stepped out, I saw through the open doorway that estimable young
man addressing himself to the ceiling of the next room.</p>

<p>"I've removed the stick, sir."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said I; on which he spun round with a smothered
cry. But he recovered himself sufficiently to advance to meet us
and hold out a bunch of keys and a note.</p>

<p>"Mr Damper's keys, sir, and a note for you. Can I do anything
more for you?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," I replied; and as he bustled away I opened the
note, which Burbler undisguisedly read over my shoulder. It was
unsigned and read as follows:</p>

<p>"I have kept my word, you see, like a burglar and a gentleman.
Tell Burbey he needn't trouble about us; we're clean away. And
don't forget those curios. It's the right-hand column that
opens."</p>

<p>"I wonder what the stuff is," said Burbler. "We may as well go
and see, as we're here. Don't-cher think so?"</p>

<p>I did, though, to speak the truth, my enthusiasm in respect of
hiding holes was not quite what it had been; and accordingly we
made our way to the drawing room as it was now called. There was no
difficulty in finding the "column;" which was not a column at all
but a Corinthian pilaster of carved oak; one of a pair that
supported an elliptical arch against the end wall. Following
Mifflin's directions, Burbler seized the left-hand corner and gave
a sharp pull, whereupon the whole shaft between the capital and the
plinth opened, forming a tall, narrow door, and disclosing an
extremely narrow flight of steps.</p>

<p>Burbler was extraordinarily polite. He not only held the door
open for me to enter first, he actually remained outside to keep
guard, as I observed on looking back from the top of the stairs.
But here I had something fresh to think about, for I had come up
against a solid wooden partition, and it seemed to me that vague
sounds of movement and muffled voices proceeded from somewhere near
at hand. I opened a small but massive door, and immediately the
sounds became quite distinct; so much so that I had some thoughts
of turning back and summoning the sergeant.</p>

<p>But pride and curiosity impelled me to advance. Passing through
the doorway I traversed a short, narrow passage which brought me to
another partition, in which was a square trap or door secured by a
bolt. I drew back the bolt, and, pulling open the trap, which was
very thick and heavy, looked into a small brick chamber, which,
like my late prison, was lighted by a false chimney.</p>

<p>The little dungeon-like chamber contained three men; and I may
say that we looked at one another with mutual astonishment. For the
three prisoners were the Russian Police Agents who had kidnapped me
but a short time since and who had, doubtless, believed me to be at
the bottom of the sea. They looked wretched enough now, for they
were all handcuffed and loosely linked together with a chain, which
had been passed round a beam that crossed the cell and secured with
a padlock. A sack of ship's biscuit and a couple of buckets of
water had kept them from starvation but had not induced hilarious
spirits.</p>

<p>We stared at one another in silence for a moment or two; then I
ventured to ask:</p>

<p>"How came you to be shut in here, Herr von Bommel?"</p>

<p>The German's eyes flashed behind his spectacles and he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Ach! It vos zat villain Mifflin, bot I shall catch him! He
shall bay for zis. Ja! I shall catch him yet." (he didn't look much
like it at the moment) "And you vill let us out, sir? You vill not
bear a crutch for our liddle mistague?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I will let you out," said I, "only you mustn't make
any more mistakes, you know."</p>

<p>The keys of the padlock and the handcuffs hung on a nail just
out of the prisoner's reach. I unlocked the padlock, and, promising
to unfasten the handcuffs downstairs, took the precaution to slip
out through the trap and hurry down in advance. The three prisoners
soon followed; and when I had released their hands, they departed,
in deep dejection and in company with Sergeant Burbler, to report
the escape of the gang.</p>

<p>I have never seen them since&mdash;the foreign gentlemen, I
mean. As to Detective-Sergeant Burbler&mdash;but that is another
story, and must be reserved for another occasion.</p>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER FOUR &mdash; THE
RESURRECTIONISTS</h2>

<p class="first">THOUGH I do not myself profess to be a religious man, I am a
strong advocate of religion in others. It generates in them
agreeable and softening conventions, it accustoms them to a
dignified form of music and introduces them to an almost extinct
variety of speech known as the English Language; it has even been
said to influence their morals; and it does undoubtedly cause them
to erect certain admirable buildings and to furnish them with
organs, choirs, and other desirable, aesthetic adjuncts.</p>

<p>Thus reflecting, I opened the lychgate of Bouldersby Churchyard
and entered. I have a strong liking for churchyards. They are quiet
and restful places where one can meditate with satisfaction on the
superior advantages of being alive. But I had a more particular
object in this visit. I wanted to have a look at old Simon Glynn's
monument in the church; and, especially, I wanted to escape from
the incessant "shadowing" of Detective-Sergeant Burbler.</p>

<p>That officer haunted me like a familiar&mdash;a much too
familiar&mdash;spirit. I couldn't get a moment to myself. And it
was not affection that made him cling to me. Not at all. It was a
mere, sordid desire to spy on my actions. Even now, I had only
given the beggar the slip by popping behind a haystack, and he
might run me to earth at any moment. I strolled up the path in the
shadow of the bordering limes. The birds sang above, and from the
church came, faint and muffled, the voice of a solitary chorister
rehearsing a solo. I couldn't make out either the tune or the
words, but I accepted the sound as an appropriate touch of local
colour, like the houseleeks on the porch or the lichen on the
tombstones. The south door of the church was open and, as I reached
it, the sound swelled suddenly into a familiar melody and I
distinguished the words:</p>

<p class="poem">"It stopped&mdash;short&mdash;never to go again<br>
When the&mdash;old&mdash;man&mdash;died."</p>

<p>I was profoundly shocked. "Decently and in order," says the
church service, and I agree most emphatically. Secular songs should
not be bawled in a place of worship. Of course the singer was
referring to "My Grandfather's Clock." I knew the song well, and
had no patience with the mawkish, sentimental doggerel&mdash;for,
after all, a drop of oil applied with a feather to the rusty
bearings would have set the old rattletrap ticking again,
grandfather or no grandfather. So I strode into the church frowning
my disapproval.</p>

<p>But the frown was thrown away. The singer was but a journeyman
painter, engaged in disfiguring the woodwork and carolling from
mere habit. He meant no harm and was as unconscious of any
impropriety as if he had been painting the outside of the bathroom
window frame, while the ablutionist within hustled behind a towel.
His innocence disarmed my indignation; and, besides, at the moment
of my entry I got a most effectual counter-irritant; for the first
object that met my eye was that fellow Burbler, staring like an
idiot at a wall tablet. I was fairly taken aback. Could he have
guessed that I was coming here? or had he come to grind a little
private axe of his own? I should soon know, if I kept my eye on
him.</p>

<p>"How do, Mr Cobb?" he said genially. "Having a look round? Fine
old place. I was just examining this very interesting tablet."</p>

<p>I looked at the tablet over his shoulder. It was of no interest
whatever. It merely located the carcase of a certain Major General
Mulliger-Torney, HEIC, late of Elham Manor, and told a number of
palpable untruths about him.</p>

<p>"A gallant officer, and an exemplary Christian, he served with
distinction in the Great Mutiny, slaying upwards of two hundred
mutineers with his own hand. 'Blessed are the Peacemakers.'"</p>

<p>"What about it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Don't you see? He lived at Elham Manor."</p>

<p>This was too thin. Obviously the sergeant was trying to distract
my attention from something else. I glanced round and saw that
something else on a wall hard by, a fine canopied monument with
painted stone effigies and a tablet beneath, on which I could make
out the name "Simon Glynn." I strolled over to examine it and stood
awhile gazing at it in silence. There is something impressive in
the nave dignity of the mural monuments of this period; a
simplicity of intention which is in no wise impaired by the
elaborate and sumptuous workmanship. For some time the mere beauty
and antiquarian interest of this quaintly splendid memorial
engrossed my attention. Then, suddenly, I started. Now I understood
why the sergeant had tried to divert my attention, and why he was
now watching me like a cat. There was something more in this
monument than met the eye at the first glance. Even the inscription
contained arresting matter where it referred to "Margery ye onely
daughter of Andreas Ozanne of ye Iland of Gurnseye Esquire;" for
surely Mistress Margery Ozanne of Guernsey might fairly be
described as a "Maid from the Sea."</p>

<p>But much more startling were the ornamental accessories of this
curious monument. On either side of the surmounting finial reclined
a winged figure, of which the one on the right held a harp, while
the other grasped a great cross-hilted sword. Between the figures
was a shield quartered with what were presumably the arms of Glynn
and his wife: the one device bearing three anchors or on a field
gules and the other a scallop-shell argent on a field azure, while
below the shield was the motto: "God with us."</p>

<p>It was certainly what Dick Swiveller would have called a
"staggerer." I repeated to myself the quaint doggerel that I had
copied from Simon Glynn's mirror.</p>

<p>Well, there were all the mystic signs; the harp and the cross
and the "ankores three;" and as for the "Maid from the Sea" there
was Mistress Margery herself. There was only one difficulty. The
"ankores three" were not at the foot of a tree, unless the great
yew outside could be considered as fulfilling the condition. In all
other respects the agreement was complete.</p>

<p>Was it possible that Glynn could have buried his treasure in the
vault where his wife lay? It seemed incredible. And yet a man who
could bequeath his fortune to any chance stranger who might have
the wit to find it, might be capable of any eccentricity. But at
this point, my reflections&mdash;and the painter's lyrical
outpourings&mdash;were interrupted by a raucous voice.</p>

<p>"Now young man; don't you know no better than to make that there
noise in a sacred hedifice?"</p>

<p>"Why, there ain't no harm in a-singin', is there?" protested the
caroller.</p>

<p>"No 'arm!" exclaimed the other, whom I
judged&mdash;correctly&mdash;to be the sexton. "No 'arm in
a-bellerin' rye-bald songs in a place of worship? Where might you
'ave been brought up?"</p>

<p>"Git out," said the painter. And the hopeless irrelevancy of the
rejoinder left the sexton speechless&mdash;until he perceived us;
when he advanced sedately as one who scents a possible
sixpence.</p>

<p>"Re-markable old figgers, them, sir," he said, addressing
himself to me as the obvious social superior. "Wunnerful old, too:
seven or eight hundred year old, so I've heerd say."</p>

<p>"<i>In</i>deed," said Burbler, looking daggers at me for being
there&mdash;but I wasn't sensitive just then. "Most interesting.
And I suppose that in those days they used to bury people in the
church; under the very pavement that we're standing on?"</p>

<p>"No doubt they did, sir," replied the sexton; "but not them two.
They are buried in the undercroft, they are. Would you like to see
the place?"</p>

<p>It was useless to deny that we should, so we followed the sexton
out of the church and round the exterior until we came to a small
doorway which had once been closed by an iron gate, but was now
unguarded. Entering after our guide, we descended a flight of
moss-grown steps and finally reached a small crypt under the
chancel. There wasn't much to see. A simple groined roof carried on
four dwarf pillars; walls of unadorned masonry and a plain flagged
floor. That was all; excepting that, against one wall, a square
stone set in the pavement exhibited the inscription:</p>

<p class="sign">Margery Glynn 1662<br>
Simon Glynn 1692</p>

<p>Burbler struck a wax match&mdash;for the only light that entered
the crypt was that which came down the stairway&mdash;and looked
long and thoughtfully at the stone. I guessed what he was thinking
by the direction of my own thoughts. He was considering the
difficulties of raising that stone and the tools necessary for the
job: and he was wondering what there was beneath the slab. By its
shape it appeared to be the cover of the entrance to a vault, and,
if this were so, the difficulties would not be great. If, on the
other hand, it covered a grave, there would be trouble. Digging up
a grave was a rather bigger undertaking&mdash;if you will pardon
the unintentional <i>double-entendre</i>&mdash; than either of us
reckoned on.</p>

<p>The sergeant dropped the match and looked at his watch&mdash;in
the dark.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" he exclaimed. "I mustn't stay loitering here,
fascinating as these antiquities are. I shall lose my train."</p>

<p>"Your train!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes. I've got to run up to Chatham. Nuisance, isn't it?"</p>

<p>I wasn't so sure of that, but, of course, I agreed that it was;
and when we had each contributed a practically unearned increment
to the sexton's income, we ascended the steps and made our way out
through the churchyard.</p>

<p>"Awful nuisance," repeated Burbler. "I shall probably be
detained in Chatham for two or three days. Most annoying! Just as I
was enjoying me holiday, too!"</p>

<p>"I thought you were down here on business."</p>

<p>"So I was. But my business is finished. Another officer has
taken over the case"&mdash;and no wonder, thought I&mdash;"so I am
having a little rest; taking a week or two's leave. They might have
left me in peace."</p>

<p>Now here I was seized by an absurd and reprehensible impulse to
say what was not strictly true. The sergeant was going away. While
unavoidably absent he might be uneasy in his mind. He might even
return prematurely. It would be only humane to reassure him.</p>

<p>"I can sympathize with you," I prevaricated, "for I'm in the
same boat myself."</p>

<p>The pleasure that shone from Burbler's face seemed almost to
justify me.</p>

<p>"Not going away?" he said brightly.</p>

<p>"Yes. Got to go to&mdash;er&mdash;Tunbridge Wells for my firm.
They may keep me there a week or so. Nuisance for me, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Horrid," said Burbler. "Do you start today?"</p>

<p>Of course, I had to say "yes," and the detective immediately
pounced on me.</p>

<p>"What time is your train?"</p>

<p>Now there he had me, for I had neglected to ask the time of his.
In my confusion I said "four o'clock," and he chimed in
gleefully:</p>

<p>"I know. Four-eight. Change at Tonbridge. Mine is the four-fifty
from the other station. I may as well walk down with you and see
you off."</p>

<p>Thus was I hoist with my own petard. For I had meant to see him
off and then prepare at my leisure for a nocturnal exploration of
the crypt. But there was no escape. I was led like a sacrificial
lamb to the station and compelled, under the sergeant's scrutiny,
to waste my substance on a ticket for Tunbridge Wells. Indeed,
fate, in the form of Sergeant Burbler, pursued me to the very door
of the compartment in which I didn't want to travel.</p>

<p>"Look out!" he exclaimed. "The train's off!" And whisking open a
door, he gave me a persuasive hoist that deposited me on the lap of
a fierce-looking, middle-aged woman.</p>

<p>"How dare you, sir?" demanded the lady, assisting me to rise
with the aid of an extraordinarily sharp elbow. "What do you mean
by this conduct?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Madam," I gasped, retreating to the farthest
corner. "It was purely an accident, I assure you. It was
indeed!"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean by an accident," she rejoined
bitterly; "bursting into a compartment that is plainly labelled
'Ladies only'. It is an unwarrantable intrusion!"</p>

<p>I glanced at the window and saw that it was even as she had
said. However, it didn't matter. I was going to pop out at the next
station, Chartham, in any case, and make my way back to Canterbury.
I mentioned the fact in extenuation.</p>

<p>"Chartham indeed!" she replied scornfully. "Permit me to remark
that this train does not stop until it reaches Tonbridge."</p>

<p>I was aghast. Here was a pretty kettle of fish! I should have to
buy another useless ticket and put off my exploration until
tomorrow; for the shops would all be shut when I got back to
Canterbury, and I couldn't lift that stone with my fingernails. Of
course I could carry out my little plan just as well tomorrow
night&mdash;unless Burbler should return prematurely. And here I
broke out into a cold sweat; for nothing was more likely. He had
located the treasure and he knew that I had, too. He was certain to
strain every nerve to get back and forestall me. It was a horrible
predicament.</p>

<p>What made it worse was that my efforts to think out some escape
from the situation were completely frustrated by my fellow
passenger; who continued to pour out an unceasing stream of
reproaches for my "unwarrantable intrusion." How she did talk, to
be sure! If some of those perpetual motion chappies could have
examined that good woman's lower jaw, they might have got a
valuable tip or two. The usual metaphor of the donkey's hind leg
was inadequate; she would have talked the fifty hind legs off a
centipede.</p>

<p>The train whizzed joyfully through station after station. It
roared through Ashford and left Pluckley behind, trundled along the
straight stretch towards Paddock Wood and Tonbridge. But presently
it began to slow down and at length came definitely to a stop at
the little wayside halt of Helgerden.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said my companion, "I'll trouble you to change into
another compartment."</p>

<p>I hesitated; for the train was only waiting for the signal to
drop and might move on at any moment. But eventually I was goaded
into opening the door and stepping out.</p>

<p>"Hi, sir! you can't get out here!" exclaimed the stationmaster,
regardless of the fact that I had actually done so. And at this
moment the train began to move. I made a dash for the nearest door,
but the stationmaster seized me by the arm.</p>

<p>"You can't enter the train when in motion," he said obscurely;
and before I could wriggle myself free, the guard had hopped in and
the train had rumbled out of the station.</p>

<p>"What time is the next train to Canterbury?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Ten-forty," he replied, and added: "I must ask you, sir, not to
use such language before my porter."</p>

<p>I apologized and pleaded extreme provocation, explaining that I
had got into the wrong train and wished to get back quickly.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," he said, "there's a very good train from Ashford in
about an hour's time."</p>

<p>"And how long will it take me to walk into Ashford?"</p>

<p>"If you step out, sir," he replied, "you ought to do it in an
hour and three-quarters."</p>

<p>I turned away hastily&mdash;appropriate remarks being
forbidden&mdash;and, striding wrathfully out of the station, walked
through the village until I encountered a finger-post which bore
the inscription: "Ashford 7 miles." Along this road I set forth at
a brisk pace: but before I had gone two hundred yards I found
myself face to face with a most terrible temptation. Leaning
against a barn was an abandoned bicycle; a tradesman's machine
apparently, for on the top bar was painted the name "Robert Miker."
Now, with that bicycle I could easily catch the desirable train
from Ashford. Without it I must walk and my operations in the crypt
would have to be postponed&mdash;perhaps for ever. The catching or
losing of that train might spell the difference between gaining and
losing a fortune.</p>

<p>I say nothing in extenuation of my conduct. Property should not
be borrowed without the consent of the owner. But&mdash;there was
no one about from whom to ask permission. I flung my leg over the
saddle and away I went.</p>

<p>I have said that when I mounted there was not a soul to be seen.
But before I had fairly got the wheels revolving, the entire
population of the place seemed to converge on the spot to speed my
departure with valedictory hoots. A shrill voice commanded me to
"come off that bike" and a deeper voice hailed me to stop. Looking
back, I saw (among others) a weedy youth shaking his fist in my
direction and a globular-bodied rural constable coming after me at
a speed that was really amazing when one considered his
proportions. I had heard of the agility of the rhinoceros but I had
never believed in it until I saw that rural constable. Still, he
was no match for a cyclist.</p>

<p>When I next looked round, a light carrier's cart had appeared.
It soon became less light, for the constable got in; and then the
driver plied his whip and the cart came along in my wake,
clattering like the horses and chariots in Pharaoh's pursuing army.
I pedalled for all I was worth. It was too late to change my mind
now. And though that cart hung on doggedly, it grew smaller and
smaller in the increasing distance. The last that I saw of it was
at a crossroad, down which it turned, leaving the constable a tiny,
threatening spot on the white highway.</p>

<p>A little way past the milestone that recorded "three miles to
Ashford," I came to a small inn which bore on its signboard the
words "White Cow." I had now plenty of time in which to walk the
rest of the way, and it seemed a wise thing to disencumber myself
of my borrowed steed. Entering, I ordered a glass of beer, and,
having hastily consumed it, I asked the landlord to take charge of
the bicycle.</p>

<p>"It belongs to Mr Miker," I explained. "I expect he will call
for it by and by. Will you give it to him and tell him that I am
much obliged for the loan of it?"</p>

<p>The landlord promised to give the message, and I then got on the
road once more, stepping out at a good round pace and
congratulating myself on having made a skilful escape from a
compromising situation. Soon after leaving the inn I came to a
rather steep hill, at the top of which the road ran along the level
for some considerable distance before again descending. I had
proceeded along the level tract and was close to the brow of the
hill when I became aware of the hum of a bicycle, approaching
rapidly from behind. I looked quickly over my shoulder, and my
heart sank. Ye Gods and little fishes! It was that confounded rural
constable!</p>

<p>I gave one despairing glance at the town of Ashford, spread out
before my yearning gaze. Another couple of miles and I had been
safe. It was a pitiful thing to be shipwrecked within sight of
port, but shipwrecked I apparently was. For the constable swept
alongside, and dismounting lightly, laid a colossal paw on my
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Got yer!" said he.</p>

<p>I turned sharply, and casting on him a disdainful glance,
demanded haughtily:</p>

<p>"What the deuce do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You know what I mean," he replied. "I charge you with stealing
this bicycle."</p>

<p>I laughed scornfully; though I didn't feel much like laughing, I
can assure you.</p>

<p>"My good man," said I, "how on earth can I have stolen the
bicycle when you have got it in your possession?"</p>

<p>"Now don't argue with me," he retorted. "I've caught you in
<i>flagranto delictum</i>. Saw yer prig it with my own eyes. You
just come along back with me."</p>

<p>It was a desperate situation and called for desperate efforts. I
thought frantically for a few seconds and then burst into a hollow
laugh, pointing at the bicycle.</p>

<p>"Why," I exclaimed, "that's the machine that I left at the
'White Cow'!"</p>

<p>"Quite right," said the constable.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" I shouted. "You are actually charging me with stealing
my own bicycle on which my name is legibly painted for all the
world to see. Look here!" and I pointed to the inscription.</p>

<p>The constable began to look puzzled. "Your name ain't Robert
Miker," said he. "This here bike belongs to young Bob Miker, the
wheelwright."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said I. "You are confusing me with some other
Robert Miker. How very amusing! Most ridiculous comedy of errors!
But I'll soon prove to you that this is my bicycle. You noticed
that peculiar tilt of the right pedal?"</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," he replied.</p>

<p>"Didn't you really?" said I, cocking up my right great toe. "I'm
surprised at that. I had the pedal specially built to fit this
slight deformity of my right foot."</p>

<p>The constable stared at the pedal and then at my foot, which
certainly had a rather quaint appearance with the toe cocking up
inside the boot.</p>

<p>"I don't see nothing peculiar about the pedal," said he.</p>

<p>"Let me show you," said I. "You'll see at once if I place my
foot on the pedal. It twists up on the inside. You'll see it better
if you stoop a little. Now."</p>

<p>I placed my foot on the pedal and he crouched down in the
attitude of a frog preparing to spring, his mouth open and his eyes
protruding with intelligent curiosity.</p>

<p>"Don't you see?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," he replied.</p>

<p>I gave his shoulder a sharp push: and, as he toppled over
backwards like an overturned china mandarin, making a frantic
snatch at me as he fell, I stood up on the pedal and flung my left
leg over the saddle. The bicycle started forward and I urged it
with all my strength. But it was a near thing. The constable picked
himself up in a moment and came bouncing along the road like a
gigantic football. Indeed, if it had not been for the sharp descent
he would have caught me before the machine had time to get up
speed. As it was, I went over the brow of the hill and picked up
speed in two or three revolutions. And then, of course, the
constable was nowhere. In a few seconds I was flying down the hill
at twenty or thirty miles an hour, and even when I reached the
level at the bottom, I kept up the pace so far as I was able until
I ran into the station approach at Ashford.</p>

<p>I had just time to take my ticket and book the bicycle (in the
name of Miker) before the train rumbled into the station. Selecting
an empty carriage, I took a corner seat by the door and, flinging
my hat into the rack, wiped my brow. For the moment, I was safe. I
had run the two miles in about seven minutes and the constable
couldn't do it in much under half an hour. But he would get to the
station before I should reach Canterbury, and he would probably
telegraph my description. That was awkward. And the train did not
stop at any intermediate station. It was very awkward.</p>

<p>The bell rang; a smartly-dressed Hebrew gentleman in a new straw
hat bustled into my compartment, and the train started. I resumed
my disquieting reflections. Could a telegraphed description lead to
identification? I doubted it. I wore a common tweed suit and so did
most of the other men in the train. I was dark, with aquiline
features; but so were plenty of other men. The only distinctive
feature in my get-up was my hat&mdash;a green soft felt. That hat
was the weak spot in my armour. I hadn't noticed another like it on
the platform. If I had been alone I would have dropped it out of
the window and risked going through the barrier hatless; but there
was the Hebrew chappie opposite. He would see me drop it and might
give information.</p>

<p>I had not solved the problem when the train ran into Canterbury.
My fellow passenger stood up and thrust his head and shoulders out
of the window. I stood up, too&mdash;and&mdash;quite automatically,
as it seemed&mdash; reached the Hebrew gentleman's straw hat down
from the rack and clapped it on my head. It was a loosish fit, but
that didn't matter. Then my companion popped his head in and asked
me:</p>

<p>"Do I change here for Margate?"</p>

<p>Now the fact is that he should have changed, but&mdash;well,
necessity knows no law.</p>

<p>"No," I replied. "Stay where you are," and with this I hopped
out and walked quickly through the barrier. By the side of the
ticket collector I noticed a tall, burly man who seemed to eye the
passengers curiously, but he was no concern of mine. I hurried
through and made for the exit. But just as I was passing out, I
heard a loud commotion from the neighbourhood of the barrier. I
cast an instantaneous glance back and saw that tall, burly man
struggling with a Hebrew gentleman in a green felt hat. And I
waited to see no more.</p>

<p>The shops were still open when I emerged from the station and
dived down the first by-street. I zigzagged through quiet lanes and
courts to the farther side of the town&mdash;dropping the cloakroom
ticket into a convenient letter box on my way&mdash;and, having
bought a cloth cap and deposited the straw hat (which was marked
inside "I Cohen") in a deep doorway in an unfrequented by-street, I
began to consider the outfit necessary for my proposed raid on
Simon Glynn's vault. A crowbar, a pick and a shovel were what was
really needed; but this equipment would be just a trifle
conspicuous. Besides, I really did not contemplate operations on
that scale. If there was actual digging to be done, I should have
to compound with Burbler and share the proceeds. The outfit that I
eventually purchased at the tool shop consisted of a large
case-opener&mdash;practically a small crowbar&mdash;a half-dozen
window wedges (to prevent the stone from dropping back when I had
prised it up), one or two candles, and a botanist's trowel; a
feeble set of appliances, but sufficient if it was only a question
of lifting a covering stone and exploring a vault.</p>

<p>"The shades of night were falling fast" when I approached the
village of Bouldersby by a solitary footpath. I had not hurried;
for time was no object. And I was not hurrying now. On the
contrary, I found my footsteps lagging more and more as the
distance lessened and the old church loomed up more distinctly in
the gathering gloom. It was not mere caution that made me linger,
though I went mighty warily and kept a bright lookout. The fact is,
that as I drew nearer to the church, I began to develop a most
uncommon distaste for the job. It is all very well to sneer at
vulgar superstition, but there is something very revolting in the
idea of breaking into the resting place of the dead in the mere,
sordid search for money. Moreover, it was only now that I began
fully to realize the extreme vagueness of my quest. Supposing I got
the vault open? What then? The treasure could not be exposed to
view, or the people who buried Simon, himself, would have seen it.
And if it was hidden in the vault, what clue had I to the hiding
place?</p>

<p>It was quite dark when, in a chastened, and even depressed,
frame of mind, I sneaked in through the lychgate and crept
stealthily across the churchyard. Through the open and lighted
windows of the adjoining rectory there stole out into the summer
night sounds of revelry and mirth, including a mid-Victorian solo
by a brassy-voiced gentleman who (according to his own statement)
bore the unusual name of "Champagne Charley." The light and life,
the laughter and the gay, if unmelodious song, seemed by contrast
to accentuate the sordid gruesomeness of my ghoulish quest.
Tremulously and guiltily I sought the little doorway and groped my
way down the mossy steps, not daring to strike a light for fear of
being seen from the rectory windows.</p>

<p>The crypt was as dark as a vault. I had to back down the last
few steps on all fours, and, when I reached the bottom, I felt my
way along the wall to the farthest corner. And here I thought it
safe to strike a match and light one of my candles.</p>

<p>But I was loath to begin. I unpacked my parcel of tools and laid
them on the stone floor, speculating once more on what I should do
when I got down into the vault. Then I examined the joints of the
stone that I was to raise and was almost disappointed to find them
amply wide enough to admit the chisel-edge of the case-opener. At
last, violently screwing up my courage to the sticking point, I
seized the case-opener and one or two wedges and prepared to make
the first, repulsive effort. And at that moment my ear caught
distinctly a sound of movement from somewhere above with an audible
metallic clink.</p>

<p>Instantly, I blew out my candle, and, standing stock-still,
listened. The sounds were repeated&mdash;nearer, this time: and
then I heard a fumbling footstep on the stone stairs and again the
clink of metal. I shrank back into the uttermost corner; a useless
proceeding, for there was not cover enough to conceal an earwig.
The intruder reached the floor, and, having laid on it some
metallic objects, struck a match, by the light of which I saw a
large man with his back towards me. He was lighting a sort of Guy
Fawkes lantern such as carters use, and, when he had got the wick
alight, he turned towards me, staring into the lantern as he
regulated the flame, so that the light shone full on his face. Need
I say that the face was that of Sergeant Burbler?</p>

<p>Having adjusted the wick, the detective threw the light of the
lantern round the crypt and, naturally, its rays fell upon me;
whereupon the sergeant opened his eyes and mouth unnecessarily
widely and let fall one or two unconsidered remarks which I need
not report <i>verbatim</i>.</p>

<p>"I thought you were at Tunbridge Wells, Mr Cobb!" he
concluded.</p>

<p>"I thought you were at Chatham!" I retorted.</p>

<p>"Well, I came back unexpectedly," said he.</p>

<p>"So did I," was my rejoinder.</p>

<p>An embarrassing silence followed during which we eyed one
another with hostile stares. Finally the sergeant's face relaxed
into a sour grin.</p>

<p>"Well, here we are," said he, stating an incontestable truth.
"It's no good gaping at one another like a couple of fools. I
suppose it will have to be a partnership job. That suit you?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," I replied. "We go halves, of course?"</p>

<p>"That's it. And, look here, Mr Cobb: we keep our mouths shut
about this little affair. This is a matter of treasure trove, and I
suppose you know how the law stands, being, I understand, a sort of
half-baked lawyer."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind, sir!" I exclaimed indignantly. "I am an
articled clerk and I shall be a fully qualified solicitor in a few
months. And I may tell you that this is not a case of
treasure-trove. We are acting on the express instructions of the
deceased. I regard that inscription on the mirror as having a
testamentary character. The treasure is definitely stated to be a
personal bequest to the finder."</p>

<p>"I doubt if a court of law would take that view," said Burbler.
"Anyhow, it will be safer for us to keep our own counsel. Morally
speaking, the stuff is ours, and that is all that matters."</p>

<p>This being an eminently reasonable view to take of the case, I
agreed to inviolable secrecy as to the treasure, and the sergeant
then began his preparations. His outfit was a much more
businesslike one than mine, for it included a small spade and a
very large and massive folding jemmy. The latter, when the joints
were screwed together, was about three feet long and was a
decidedly hefty tool for use either as a crow or a pick; and when
the sergeant had "jumped" its beak into the joint between the
stones, one or two vigorous heaves at the knobbed handle fairly
lifted the inscribed slab out of its bed.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr Cobb," exclaimed Burbler, "just stick that bar of yours
into the opening while I get a fresh purchase."</p>

<p>I thrust in the case-opener, and the sergeant took a fresh
purchase with his jemmy. Another strong heave, and the stone came
up a couple of inches. I seized its edge and held it until the
sergeant, dropping the jemmy, came to my assistance. Then with a
united effort we hoisted the stone right up and turned it back,
disclosing a square, black hole and the top of a flight of brick
steps.</p>

<p>It was an uninviting-looking entrance and we both gazed at it in
silence and without any enthusiastic tendency to struggle for
precedence.</p>

<p>"Well," the sergeant remarked, at length, "it's a small hole, Mr
Cobb; we can't both go down at once."</p>

<p>I admitted that we could not, and suggested the propriety of
lowering the lantern to make sure that the air was not too
foul.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true," said Burbler, "but I haven't got any string.
Just hold the lantern down at arm's length and see how it
burns."</p>

<p>I lay down on the pavement and let the lantern down as far as I
could reach. It burned quite well but failed to make the interior
of the vault clearly visible; in fact, I could see nothing at all
save an enormous cluster of horrible-looking fungi which occupied
the lower steps and generated in me an urgent desire to see Burbler
go down first.</p>

<p>I lifted up the lantern, and the sergeant and I gazed at one
another irresolutely. And then the deathly silence of the crypt was
suddenly shattered by a brassy voice which shouted:</p>

<p>"Body-snatchers, by jingo!"</p>

<p>The sergeant and I leaped to our feet, and Burbler nearly fell
down the hole. The light of the lantern revealed two men, one of
whom&mdash;a fiddle-faced, red-jowled old sinner who looked like a
retired military officer&mdash;was in evening dress, while the
other was obviously a clergyman. The newcomers stared at us and we
stared at them; and a very embarrassing situation it was for the
sergeant and me.</p>

<p>"Taken red-handed, by Jove!" said the violin-faced warrior.
"Caught on the bally hop! What!"</p>

<p>As this remark, though vulgarly expressed, stated an undeniable
truth, no comment seemed to be called for. Moreover, neither the
sergeant nor I was at the moment bursting with conversational
matter. So we continued to gape at the intruders like a couple of
fools.</p>

<p>Then the parson spoke.</p>

<p>"Would you kindly explain," said he, "what is the meaning of
these very strange proceedings?"</p>

<p>I left the explanation to Burbler as the more expert and
accomplished liar. But he was not so ready as I should have
expected. He gibbered confusedly for a few seconds and then replied
with a most unconvincing stammer:</p>

<p>"We are&mdash;er&mdash;engaged
in&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;archaeological research."</p>

<p>The parson smiled faintly and the warrior, glaring ferociously
at Burbler, growled:</p>

<p>"Archaeological bunkum!" and then fixed an inquisitive eye on
the sergeant's jemmy.</p>

<p>"If you wish to know what is under this crypt," said the parson,
"I can save you the trouble of further excavation, for I was not
only present but I personally supervised the reconstruction of the
Glynn vault some twenty years ago."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" gasped Burbler.</p>

<p>"Yes. There seems to have been some silly tradition of a buried
treasure in the vault, and as a result we suffered a good deal of
inconvenience. There was a tendency on the part of unauthorized
persons to injure the iron gate and&mdash;and, in short, to engage
in archaeological research."</p>

<p>Here the fiddle-faced ass flung up his fat head and roared:</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! Archaeological, by gum! Dam good that! Excuse me,
Padre."</p>

<p>"So," pursued the parson, "I thought it desirable to set the
matter at rest by a thorough examination of the vault. Needless to
say, nothing was discovered beyond the bones of the deceased and
the decayed remnants of two oaken coffins. I had the entire floor
of the crypt dug up and the foundations examined, and then the
vault was rebuilt, the remains re-coffined, and the pavement of the
crypt relaid as you see it now. Is there anything else that you
would like to know?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," replied Burbler. "That settles our hash&mdash;I
mean to say, that is all the information that we require."</p>

<p>"Then, in that case, perhaps you would like me to show you the
most convenient way out of the precincts?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, it's very good of you, sir," said Burbler: and the
parson rejoined: "Not at all."</p>

<p>We picked up our ridiculous tools&mdash;excepting the jemmy,
which the warrior pounced on and examined attentively before
handing it to the sergeant&mdash;and took our way sadly up the
steps and along the churchyard path. At the lychgate the parson
wished us a courteous "Good evening," and his companion leaned over
the gate and bellowed after us:</p>

<p>"You've had a devilish easy let-off, you two rascals. Suppose
you know it's a misdemeanour to be found at night with
housebreaking tools? What? Oh, I know a jemmy when I see one, don't
you make any mistake!"</p>

<p>"I expect you do," snapped Burbler. "Done a bit in that line
yourself, eh?" and he turned away, leaving the fiddle-faced warrior
gasping.</p>

<p>The sergeant and I trudged dejectedly along the high road, and
for a while neither of us spoke. At length I ventured to
remark:</p>

<p>"Well, sergeant, Simon Glynn has been one too many for us this
time."</p>

<p>But Burbler's heart was too full for conversation. He only
replied with a morose growl:</p>

<p>"Damn Simon Glynn."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER FIVE &mdash; A MERMAID AND A
RED HERRING</h2>

<p class="first">THERE is a world of difference as to the resulting knowledge
between a cursory observation that notes only generalities and an
attentive examination that considers particular details. I realized
this with great force when, having strolled out from my lodgings at
the Royal George inn to smoke my morning pipe on the little green,
I turned to look up at the picturesque house. Between the middle
windows, close under the eaves, was a small square of stone in
which were cut three initial letters and a date. I had noticed it
when I first came to the inn and I had frequently glanced at it
since; but if I had been asked to describe the inscription I could
have told no more than that it consisted of three initial letters
surrounding a heart with the date 1636 underneath. What the letters
were I certainly could not have told, though I should have
remembered the date.</p>

<p>The explanation of this is perfectly simple. A group of figures
forming a date conveys a definite meaning, whereas the initial
letters of an unknown person's name have none; and meaningless
things neither stimulate the attention nor impress the memory.</p>

<p>Yet I had often looked, and not without interest, at the little
tablet. For these simple memorials illustrate a very pretty
old-world custom. The initials&mdash;usually set in a triangle
about a heart or flower or star&mdash;are those of a man and wife
and the date below is that on which the house was finished and the
young couple entered into possession to begin their married life.
The upper letter is the initial of the joint surname and the lower
ones represent the Christian names of the husband and wife
respectively.</p>

<p>This morning I was in a reflective vein and somewhat at a loose
end. Only the previous day I had made that abortive search in the
vault. The treasure, deliberately hidden by old Simon over two
centuries ago, was still undiscovered. I had been hot on the scent;
and though that scent had proved a false one, the search had warmed
my blood with the treasure-hunting fever.</p>

<p>I looked up at the tablet and somewhat absently read the brief
inscription. The upper letter was G; the lower two S and M. And
then I started, suddenly wide awake. For these were the initials of
Simon and Margery Glynn.</p>

<p>At first I thought it must be a mere coincidence. Glynn was a
man of means who lived in the great house of Elham Manor. How
should his name appear on this obscure wayside inn? The initials
must be those of some other couple; Solomon and Miriam Gobbler, for
instance. But then there was the date, 1636. I made a rapid
calculation from the dates on Glynn's tomb in Bouldersby church. He
died in 1692, aged eighty-one. Then in 1636 he was twenty-five
years old; a very likely age at which to marry and settle down.
Margery Glynn died in 1662, aged forty-five. Then in 1636 she would
be nineteen; again a very likely age. It looked uncommonly as if
these initials were those of Glynn and his wife.</p>

<p>Suddenly I recalled a passage in Boteler's "Manor Houses of
Kent," which stated that "from a reference to him (Glynn) in Pepys'
Diary, it would seem that he had property in this neighbourhood, of
which he was probably a native." Now it happened that, only a day
or two previously, I had picked up on a bookstall in Canterbury an
old copy of Pepys' Diary, which I had not looked at since. Full of
my new discovery, I bustled indoors, and, running up to my room,
opened the volume and eagerly ran my eye down the index, until it
lighted on the name "Glynn, Simon," when, with a trembling hand, I
turned up the entry.</p>

<p class="newspaper">"23rd April (1664). Upp and to the Coffee
House by the Exchange to talk with Mr Gannett a Turky Merchant.
While we are talking comes Mr Simon Glynn (a Goldsmith and
Secretary of the Mint in Oliver's time) a pleasant fellow but
whimsicall. Much good discourse and merriment. Mr Gannett asketh
Glynn how he, being a widower without issue, shall devise his
wealth; to which Glynn answers that his house and lands and a
tavern that he hath he shall give to his sister's sons, but not his
money. And then he makes this observation (which methought mighty
pretty) viz:&mdash;That some doe possess much money and little wit,
and others much wit and little money, but whoso inherits his
gatherings shall have both."</p>

<p>Here was matter indeed! There could be very little doubt that
the "tavern that he hath" was the very inn in which I was lodging;
and that concluding observation seemed to hint that when Simon
deposited his "gatherings" in a hiding place for the benefit of
some future treasure-hunter, he intended that "wit" and not chance
should be the instrument of its discovery. And no doubt he had made
suitable arrangements. At any rate, upwards of two centuries had
passed, and, though, according to all accounts, there had been no
lack of treasure-seekers, Simon Glynn's hoard still waited for the
adventurer with wit enough to locate it.</p>

<p>Was it possible that I was to be that fortunate adventurer?
Elham Manor house had been ransacked again and again, its garden
excavated and its very panelling torn down; the vault under the
church had been opened and dug out to the foundations. But no one,
so far as I knew, had ever searched the tavern; indeed, its
connection with Glynn would appear to have been forgotten. Which
might easily have happened, seeing that the existence of hidden
treasure did not become known until nearly half a century after
Simon's death.</p>

<p>Since the finding of the mirror every likely place seemed to
have been searched. The Manor House had been searched; the vault
under the monument had been explored. But no treasure had come to
light. The treasure-seekers had apparently struck the wrong place
each time.</p>

<p>Could it be that Glynn had after all secreted his savings
somewhere in the inn? It was intrinsically probable enough. The
small house in which he had made his start in life and to which he
had brought home his young wife, must have had happier memories for
him than the stately Manor House in which he had lived a solitary
widower. It was highly probable that he would choose that place in
which to hide his curious legacy; but&mdash;there was not the
slightest evidence that he had. No vestige of any harp or cross or
anchors three had I seen since I had lodged at the inn.</p>

<p>But wait! There was one thing that I had seen and had meant to
investigate. On the main gable of the house&mdash;which, oddly
enough, looked on the garden and the river&mdash;was some kind of
tablet or ornamental panel of carved brick. Only a corner of the
moulding that framed it was visible, the whole of the remainder
being hidden by a too-luxuriant creeper; but the size of the frame
showed that it was a work of more pretensions than the little
tablet on the front of the house.</p>

<p>I walked through into the garden, and, backing away from the
house until I was stopped by the great mulberry tree that dominated
the lawn, looked up at the gable. The corner of a well-carved frame
poked out from under the creeper; and, even as I looked, a breath
of wind lifted the foliage and showed me the date 1640. That
settled it. The panel was put up in Glynn's time. The frame almost
certainly enclosed some kind of sculpture. Perhaps a harp and a
cross&mdash;but I would soon see. For my bedroom window was just
underneath it and the principal branch of the offending creeper was
within easy reach.</p>

<p>Full of my investigation and oblivious of the remoter
consequences of what I was about to do, I ran up to my bedroom and
thrust my head out of the window. The panel was but a few feet
above, embedded in the mass of creeper that covered the gable. I
grasped the large branch that strayed past the jamb of the window
and gave it a gentle pull. The plant was a species of Virginia
creeper; the kind which attaches itself to the wall without
artificial support, though not with the security of the less
handsome ampelopsis; and, as I pulled, I could feel some of the
little tendrils break away. I gave one or two more
jerks&mdash;quite gentle ones lest I should damage the possibly
fragile ornament of the panel. At each jerk I felt more of the
tendrils break and then suddenly the whole branch separated from
the wall and came tumbling down so that I had to cut it through
with my knife and let it drop to the ground.</p>

<p>Once more I thrust out my head and looked up; but crane out as I
might, I could see no more than the bottom edge of the frame,
though the gable was now clear of the creeper. But if I could not
see the panel, there was somebody else who could. I observed him
just as I was withdrawing my head, and in a moment realized what an
idiot I had been. The man was standing under a clump of willows on
the opposite side of the river and was in such deep shadow that I
could not see what he was like, though it was clear enough that he
was looking up at the gable and mightily interested in my
proceedings. But though I could not recognize him, an uneasy
suspicion as to his identity flitted through my mind; a suspicion
that this untimely observer was none other than Detective-Sergeant
Burbler.</p>

<p>If this should really turn out to be the case, then I had
brought my pigs to a pretty fine market! For the worthy detective,
who had come down to this neighbourhood on official business, was
admittedly staying here for his own purposes. He was "taking a few
weeks' leave to enjoy the quiet and the beautiful scenery." That
was how he put it. The actual fact was that he had caught the scent
of Simon Glynn's treasure and was hanging about in the hope of
picking up some further clues. And, as he believed me to be in
possession of some private information respecting the hiding place
of that treasure, he had made it his special business to shadow me
ever since I had begun my researches. He hadn't got much by his
shadowing up to the present, for the simple reason that there had
been nothing to get. I knew no more than he. But now, by uncovering
that panel for all the world to see, I had, perhaps, put him in
possession of a valuable clue.</p>

<p>I raced down the stairs, all agog to see what that panel really
was. Hurrying out into the garden, I backed away under the great
mulberry tree and looked up. And as my eye lighted on the carved
brick sculpture enclosed within the frame, a wave of mingled
exultation and alarm swept over me; exultation because here was a
first-class clue; alarm lest my inveterate rival should have seen
it too. For the panel exhibited in bold relief the figure of an
unmistakable mermaid.</p>

<p>It was clearly not the work of an ordinary village mason. The
ornament of the frame was but a plain and simple lattice pattern,
but the figure was quite competently done; entirely unlike the
crude and childish figure-work of the rustic sculptor. Indeed, the
whole panel, in both design and finish, was singularly out of
character with the homely building&mdash;little more than a
cottage&mdash;on which it was placed; and this suggested that by
the year 1640 Glynn had already begun to be a prosperous man.
Probably he worked here at his trade, while his wife managed the
inn, and found in the city hard by plenty of customers for his
work.</p>

<p>But the immediate question was as to the meaning of this
sculptured figure. I repeated the doggerel lines:</p>

<p class="verse">"Ankores three atte the foot of a tree and a maid
from the sea on high."</p>

<p>And it was instantly borne in on me that I was standing at the
foot of a tree to look up at the sea-maid; and that, as there was
no other tree near, this was the only one that could possibly be
referred to. I turned to look at the mulberry tree. Obviously, it
was of great age. It might well have been&mdash;and probably
was&mdash;planted by Glynn himself. And if it was; if Glynn had
planted it soon after he came to the house in 1636, then, at the
time when the treasure was buried&mdash;which was, apparently,
about 1684&mdash;it would be nearly fifty years old and quite a
large and well-grown tree. The reasonable inference was that this
was the tree referred to in the doggerel and that Simon Glynn's
hoard was buried at its foot.</p>

<p>Of course there were objections to this conclusion. There was no
sign of any harp or cross and the "ankores three" were nowhere to
be seen. But the harp and cross might easily have been removed by
Vandalic "restorers" if they were originally carved on, or affixed
to, the house; and as to the anchors, they were probably incised on
the bark of the tree itself, and, if so, would naturally have
disappeared after all these years. Simon Glynn could never have
reckoned that two hundred and thirty years would elapse before a
really intelligent man should appear to claim his legacy. It was
unsatisfactory, I could not but admit, that those confirmatory
signs were absent; but still, there was the tree, and there was the
"maid from the sea on high," and that seemed good enough to justify
a careful exploration.</p>

<p>Already a delighted imagination was filling in the outline of
the picture. I saw the hole at the foot of the mulberry tree and
heard the thud as my pick or spade impinged on the iron-bound
chest: and I was beginning to speculate on the nature of the
precious contents, when, suddenly, the recollection of Burbler came
like the shadow of the Upas Tree, to blot out the sunlight of my
dreams. Had he seen me uncover the panel? or was that figure under
the willows merely a chance rustic, curious but innocuous?</p>

<p>I ran down to the landing stage and, getting into the boat that
belonged to the inn, pulled upstream. But there was no one under
the willows now. I landed and searched the neighbourhood of the
towpath, but not a soul was to be seen. Rustic loiterer or watchful
detective, that unwelcome observer had vanished and left no
trace.</p>

<p>With mixed feelings, in which pleasurable excitement
predominated, I pulled back to the inn and landed. The suspicion
that Burbler had seen the tell-tale figure of the mermaid could not
influence my course of action except to hasten it. At the foot of
the mulberry tree lay Simon Glynn's "gatherings." Of that I had
very little doubt. The course was to dig them up; and, under the
circumstances, the sooner the better. I had the great advantage
over Burbler that I was a resident of the inn. When the premises
were shut up for the night I should have the place practically to
myself, for old Mrs Hodger, my landlady, was the only other person
who slept in the house, and she was as deaf as a post. When once
she had retired to her room in the front of the house, which she
usually did about ten o'clock, I was as free as if I were quite
alone.</p>

<p>The necessary preparations were few and simple and I had the day
before me in which to make them. First I visited the cellar, in
which I knew the garden tools were kept. There was a good enough
assortment; two spades and three stout forks, in addition to the
smaller tools. Unfortunately, however, there was no pick. But to
dig a deep hole in undisturbed ground without a pick was a task
that I felt to be beyond me; and accordingly I set forth, without
delay, to procure the necessary implement from a tool shop in
Canterbury. I kept a sharp lookout for Burbler, whose unpleasant
habit of shadowing and spying on me I have mentioned, and when I
emerged from the shop with the pick, thinly disguised in brown
paper, I made at once for the least frequented by-streets and left
the town by a footpath across the meadows. But it was an anxious
business; for if the detective had met me with that incriminating
tool under my arm, the murder would have been out with a vengeance.
I should never have got a chance to use it.</p>

<p>But it seemed that I was in luck, for the perilous passage was
accomplished without my seeing any sign of Burbler. I sneaked into
the inn by the garden door and at once proceeded to deposit the
pick in a corner of the cellar. So far, good. I had made my
preparations unobserved. If I had the same luck with my midnight
explorations, I might get the treasure safely stowed in my trunk
before Burbler was ready to begin. That is, assuming that my worst
suspicions of him were correct.</p>

<p>In this mood of self-congratulation I slowly ascended the cellar
steps. But at the top I halted and my self-congratulations came to
a sudden end. In fact, I got a most severe shock.</p>

<p>A deaf person somewhat resembles a telephone; which appears to
be an appliance for conveying verbal information to everybody but
the person addressed. There was a stranger in the bar. I knew he
was a stranger because he was talking to Mrs Hodger. The regular
customers simply reached down a mug from the shelf and held it
under the tap of the selected cask. But what had filled me with
consternation was the sound of the voice. It was pitched in a low
and confidential key, and the words were indistinguishable but I
seemed to recognize it.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mrs Hodger, "you're right. This hot weather do make
you thirsty. So much the better for me. He! he!"</p>

<p>The stranger rejoined, a little louder; and, though I could not
hear what he said, I knew that he was repeating his former remark.
Strangers always did.</p>

<p>"Well," said Mrs Hodger, "what I says is, wooden taps is
better'n lead pipes when all's said 'n done. More wholesome, like,
you know."</p>

<p>Here the stranger, abandoning his former confidential and rather
secret tone, let off a howl that must have been audible half a mile
away. And that howl settled the question of the speaker's
identity.</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;asking&mdash;you," roared the unmistakable voice of
Sergeant Burbler, "if you can&mdash;let&mdash;me&mdash;have&mdash;a
Bedroom?"</p>

<p>Mrs Hodger evidently had some slight misgivings as to whether
she had quite caught that last remark. But she was a woman of
spirit.</p>

<p>"Ho," she replied, "then you'd better get a mug down and droar
it yourself. Then you'll know that you've got what you want."</p>

<p>There was a short pause. I knew what was coming; and it came,
sure enough. It always did.</p>

<p>"There ain't any need to write it," said Mrs Hodger, a little
huffily. "I may be a trifle hard of hearing, but this ain't an
asylum for the deaf and dumb...Oh, I see. Got a sore throat and
lost your voice? Dear, dear. Surprising what a lot o' people is
took that way nowadays. There's my lodger, Mr Cobb, and the Rector
and&mdash;but you're asking about a bedroom. Well, you can have the
little blue room if you'll take things as they come and not expect
no waiting on."</p>

<p>Apparently the little blue room&mdash;so called from the colour
of its paint&mdash;answered Burbler's requirements, for he turned
up that very day about teatime accompanied by a barrow on which was
a large cabin trunk and an elongated parcel enclosed in sacking.
That parcel looked as if it contained a spade and pick, but I
couldn't be quite sure, as Burbler declined my offer to carry it
upstairs for him.</p>

<p>Now here was a nice cheerful state of affairs! Of course, my
proposed nocturnal exploration was impossible so long as Burbler
was about. And he seemed to have come to stay. At any rate he would
probably see my visit out, for I couldn't squeeze more than a week
or two of extended holiday out of my firm, indulgent as they
were.</p>

<p>It was an intolerable situation. Burbler clung to me as if I had
been a long-lost brother. He walked abroad with me, of course he
took meals with me, and he would even pop into my bedroom
unexpectedly when I was dressing&mdash;though I put a stopper on
that by bolting the door. Even when I escaped for a few minutes'
quiet, I have reason to believe that he consoled himself by
visiting my room and raking over my personal effects; an intrusion
that I was powerless to prevent, for, though every door in the
house seemed to be fitted with massive bolts inside and out, there
was not a single workable lock.</p>

<p>It is true that Burbler's conduct was not without its
compensations; for if he could not afford to lose sight of me,
neither could I afford to lose sight of him. And there was a
further consolation. The continual watch that he kept over my
movements and especially his repeated searchings in my room showed
that he still believed me to possess some clue to the whereabouts
of the treasure that he did not. Still, as I have said, it was an
intolerable situation and something would have to be done. There, I
felt no doubt, was the treasure, lying <i>perdu</i> at the foot of
the mulberry tree, and, somehow, by hook or by crook, I must manage
to get it exhumed.</p>

<p>Necessity is the mother of invention. During those dreary walks
with Burbler my brain was hard at work; while I sat at table with
him I turned over scheme after scheme; and especially in the
watches of the night, when I lay by the open window listening for
the sound of a surreptitious pick from the lawn below, was my mind
busy with plans for getting rid of Burbler. And at last I hit on
one.</p>

<p>It was clear to me that the sergeant did not share my certainty
as to where the treasure was hidden. Not being gifted, like me,
with a brilliant constructive imagination, he was baffled by the
absence of the Harp, the Cross and the "Ankores three." Hence his
continual attendance on me and his searchings of my room. He
thought I knew more than he did, and he was waiting for me to give
him a lead. Very well. I would give him one.</p>

<p>The inspiration of my plan came from a prehistoric monument that
stood in a field not far from the inn; a structure of the kind
known as a dolmen&mdash;a sort of rude tomb chamber roofed in by a
huge, flat "table-stone." Near to it was the hollow trunk of an
ancient oak, which, with it, occupied a space that was reserved
from cultivation. There is something rather stimulating to the
imagination in these prehistoric remains, especially when
associated with an ancient and decayed oak. Not that Burbler had
much imagination; but it was as well to give him all the assistance
possible.</p>

<p>I made a preliminary sketch plan of the place and then, after
breakfast, while Burbler was giving his boots a brush in the
scullery, I sneaked out of the house and legged it as hard as I
could go. The dolmen was visible from the road across one or two
open meadows, and I suspected that I shouldn't have it very long to
myself. Nor had I. Within five minutes of my arrival a distant
figure appeared getting over a fence and approaching; somewhat
circuitously, it is true, for the adjoining meadow, through which
the direct footpath led, was occupied by Farmer Babbage's
short-horn bull. I affected not to see him, and proceeded slowly
and with long strides to pace the distance from the dolmen to the
tree, noting down the measurements and compass bearings on a
good-sized piece of paper. When the sergeant climbed over the last
fence I looked at him with a startled expression, hurriedly
pocketed the paper and walked forward to meet him.</p>

<p>"Rum-looking concern, that," he remarked, nodding at the dolmen
and casting a suspicious glance round the field.</p>

<p>"Yes. Nothing to see, though," I replied indifferently, making
as if to return to the road.</p>

<p>"May as well have a look at it," said Burbler; and he approached
the venerable structure, and, having stared at it blankly for a
while, remarked that it "looked as if it had been there some
time."</p>

<p>"Getting on for three thousand years," said I.</p>

<p>"You don't say so!" he exclaimed. "Three thousand years! Gad! A
repairing lease was worth something in those days."</p>

<p>He continued to cast puzzled glances at the dolmen and the old
tree trunk, but failing to make anything of either of them, allowed
himself ultimately to be led away.</p>

<p>On the following morning, having bolted my door, I prepared the
final document, which consisted of a rough plan of the field,
showing the dolmen and the tree and a number of dotted lines
connecting them. At the bottom of the paper I wrote the following
explanatory references:</p><br>

<p class="letter">"From dolmen to harp stone, 20 yards English cloth
measure, due north.<br>
From harp to first anchor 15...due west.<br>
From first anchor to second anchor 5...due north.<br>
...second anchor to third anchor 7...due east<br>
...third anchor to cross 7...due south.<br>
Three and a half feet below the surface."</p>
<br>

<p>It is needless to say that this was all nonsense. But it had a
fine, piratical, treasure-seeking appearance. I folded it neatly
and laid it on a shelf in my cupboard with a couple of half-crowns
on it; and having measured with my pocket dividers the exact
distances from the half-crowns to the edges of the paper, I made a
note of them and then went down to breakfast. Burbler had not yet
left his room; but he appeared some ten minutes later with the most
ludicrous expression of bewilderment that I have ever seen. I could
have laughed in his face.</p>

<p>In the middle of breakfast I suddenly left the table and rushed
upstairs as if I had forgotten something. Bolting my door, I
carefully tested the position of the half-crowns on the sheet of
paper; and when I found that it had changed by a full sixteenth of
an inch, I knew that Burbler had gorged the bait, for Mrs Hodger
had not left the kitchen. I accordingly pocketed the document and
descended to finish my breakfast with renewed appetite. All the
preliminaries were now arranged. I could reckon on getting rid of
Burbler for an hour or so at least, and perhaps in the interval I
might manage to lift or at any rate locate the treasure.</p>

<p>That very night I proceeded to carry my plan into execution.
Soon after half past ten, the house being then all quiet, I stole
silently (but not <i>too</i> silently, you understand) out of my
room and descended to the cellar to provide myself with the needful
appliances. A bundle of half-inch iron rods, each about four feet
long and pointed at one end, stood in a corner; the remains, I
suppose, of some kind of iron fence. One of these I selected as a
sounding rod, and having annexed a good-sized hammer, a spade and a
half-dozen clothes-pegs, I crept up from the cellar and listened
for a few moments. The house was very silent, but once I thought I
could distinguish faint sounds of stealthy movement above; on which
I unbolted the front door and went out, shutting it behind me.</p>

<p>It was an ideal night for the purpose. The nearly full moon was
covered by a thin veil of cloud, so that there was plenty of
diffused light, and yet one was not too conspicuous; though, for
that matter, there was not a soul about. The road was as deserted
as the fields, and I arrived at the dolmen&mdash;by a slight
detour, to avoid the neighbourhood of Farmer Babbage's
bull&mdash;and without having seen a living creature.</p>

<p>Resting the spade against the dolmen, and taking a look through
a large opening into the dark interior, I reflected awhile,
studying my sketch plan and a pocket compass by the feeble light.
There was no hurry. If Burbler was on my track, I must give him
time to reach the spot. And yet I must not seem to dawdle if he had
already arrived. I kept an eye on a clump of elders that would
cover his approach, hoping to make out some signs of his presence;
but the clouds now grew more dense and the light faded until the
elders were no more than a vague dark mass. There was nothing for
it but to begin and assume that Burbler was there.</p>

<p>I paced out the first line with long strides (and an eye on the
elders) and at the end of it hammered one of the clothes-pegs into
the ground. From this point I slowly paced to the "first anchor"
and hammered in another peg; and so on until I had made the whole
round and arrived at the spot marked on my sketch with the cross.
And still there was no sign of Burbler.</p>

<p>A sudden, horrible suspicion entered my mind that I was going
through all this tomfoolery without any audience at all. That was a
frightful thought. But worse than that was the suspicion that now
seized me and chilled my very blood, that Burbler might have taken
advantage of my absence, and, even at this moment, while I was
playing this fool's pantomime in an empty field, might be digging
at the foot of the mulberry tree!</p>

<p>I broke out into a cold sweat. It was an awful dilemma. I
couldn't stop my foolery for fear he might be watching after all;
and yet I was in a fever to get back to the inn and see that
nothing terrible was happening.</p>

<p>I had stuck the sounding rod in the ground and had the hammer
poised for the first blow when a voice&mdash;a distinctly
agricultural voice&mdash; broke the stillness of the night.</p>

<p>"Now then, you, what are you doing here at this time o'
night?"</p>

<p>Naturally I thought that the unseen speaker was addressing me.
But he wasn't. For a familiar voice answered sheepishly:</p>

<p>"Nothing in particular. Just having a walk round."</p>

<p>"Oh. Then you just take a walk out; out of my meadows. And you
there! What are you up to?"</p>

<p>This question, bellowed in stentorian tones, was obviously
addressed to me. It being impossible to ignore it, I walked towards
the elders, whence the voice appeared to proceed, mumbling
ambiguous explanations. By the fence under the trees I found
Burbler and a stout, elderly man; presumably Farmer Babbage.</p>

<p>"Now then," said the latter, "you just come over the fence and
I'll show you the way off my land. This here is the path."</p>

<p>"But," I protested "there is a bull in that meadow."</p>

<p>"Oh, he won't hurt you," said Babbage. "He's as quiet as a lamb,
he is."</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Burbler, "but I think I'd rather go some other
way."</p>

<p>"You'll go along the footpath," the farmer began doggedly; but
at this moment a roar like the blast of a colossal motor horn rent
the silence, and a huge black shape emerged from the darkness of
the meadow.</p>

<p>"He won't hurt you," repeated the farmer, getting over the fence
with uncommon agility nevertheless. "He's as quiet as a&mdash;"</p>

<p>Now a bull is the most thick-headed of animals, literally and
metaphorically. This particular behemoth had apparently selected
Burbler as the object of assault, and he came on like&mdash;well,
like a motor omnibus. I can't think of any more terrifying simile.
But, of course, when he arrived Burbler wasn't there. But he didn't
care for that. He proceeded to hurl a ton or so of beef and bones
at the place where Burbler had been; and the consequence was that
he hit the fence&mdash; a miserable row of rickety hurdles. And
then the fence wasn't there.</p>

<p>What immediately followed I can't say, not being provided like
the spider with eyes in my back. I only know that Farmer Babbage
continued to asseverate "He won't hurt you," as distinctly as could
be expected of a stout, elderly man who is crossing a field at
about sixteen miles an hour. When I next looked back, from the
shelter of another fence, Burbler appeared to be performing a kind
of Druidical dance round the oak tree with the bull as an active
and sympathetic acolyte.</p>

<p>Presently, taking advantage of a momentary lapse of attention on
the part of the bull, the sergeant bolted across to the dolmen and
shot in through the opening like a harlequin; and the last thing
that I saw as I turned away was the bull with his nose thrust in
through the opening of the dolmen uttering sonorous greetings to
the sojourner within.</p>

<p>I made my way back to the inn with as little delay as possible.
For the present Burbler was safe&mdash;safe, I mean, from my point
of view. And when the bull released him he would probably lurk in
the neighbourhood to see what I had been doing and to watch for my
return. Still there was no time to be lost. I must find the
treasure quickly or put off the search to another time.</p>

<p>I was still carrying the sounding rod and hammer, and that fact
suggested to me the desirability of probing the ground under the
mulberry tree before beginning to dig; for if Glynn's hoard lay
deep down, out of reach of the four-foot rod, the amount of digging
required would be greater than circumstances rendered possible on
this occasion. Accordingly, having let myself in and bolted the
door, I went straight through to the garden, and, taking my stand
under the mulbery tree, looked up at the house. It was reasonable
to suppose that the spot chosen would be as nearly as possible
opposite the "maid from the sea on high," and, on this supposition,
I stuck the point of the rod in the ground exactly in a line with
the tablet, about a dozen feet from the tree, and drove it in with
the hammer. It entered easily enough for the first eighteen inches.
After that it became more and more difficult to drive in. But it
met with no obstruction and after driving it in two feet six
inches, I pulled it up and tried a fresh place in the same
line.</p>

<p>I sounded in four or five places with the same discouraging
result; and then I "struck soundings." It was at about two feet
from the surface that I felt the resistance suddenly increase, and,
when I had freed the rod a little, I could make out a definite
solid obstacle. Eagerly I pulled up the rod, and, sticking the
point in the ground about a foot nearer the tree, hammered it in.
Again at about two feet down its progress was checked. There was
certainly something there, and something of considerable size. Not
a block of stone, as I could tell by working the rod up and down
and striking the obstruction with the point, but apparently a
massive wooden object, such as, for instance, a solidly-built
chest.</p>

<p>I paused for a moment to consider. How long would it be before
Burbler would be likely to return? That was a question to which I
could give no answer. And meanwhile here was a solid something only
a couple of feet down. With a pick and spade I could reach it in a
few minutes. It might be a treasure chest or it might not, but in
any case prudence whispered to me to take the opportunity lest I
should never get another.</p>

<p>All a-tremble with excitement, I darted into the house and
groped my way to the cellar. Quickly lighting a candle-lantern, I
found my pick and a spade and having carried them up to the
passage, I stood them against the wall and returned for the
lantern. And then came the catastrophe. I was but halfway down the
steps when someone leaped on me from behind, pinioning my arms and
gripping my wrists. The impact was so violent that my assailant and
I flew down the remaining steps and rolled together on the brick
floor; and before I could extricate myself from the bear-like
embrace, a chilly contact and a sharp, metallic snap told me that I
was handcuffed and helpless.</p>

<p>"What the deuce is the meaning of this?" I exclaimed
furiously.</p>

<p>"The meaning is," replied the too-familiar voice of Sergeant
Burbler, "that you've been a bit too artful this time, Mr Cobb.
Thought I was a regular greenhorn, didn't you? But I ain't. I've
been watching you over the back gate for the last quarter of an
hour. Now then, stop kicking, will you?"</p>

<p>I did stop, as a matter of fact; not voluntarily but in
consequence of his lashing my ankles together. I heaped on him
every objectionable epithet that a fairly retentive memory could
recall; I called him a thief, a liar, a swindler and a traitor. But
he was perfectly impassive. With a calm air of business he passed a
cord round my arms at the elbows, and, having tied it behind,
dragged me to an oaken chest, on which he seated me with my face
towards the door.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr Cobb," said he, "if you'll excuse me, I'll just run
away and attend to that little business outside. I'll leave you the
lantern, as I have one of my own."</p>

<p>With this he departed, bolting the door after him; and very soon
there came in, through the little grated ventilators, the sound of
a pick&mdash; my pick!&mdash;plied with furious energy.</p>

<p>I could have wept with rage and disappointment. Here was a
pretty end to all my scheming! I had played the jackal that this
mangy Scotland Yard lion might gobble up the prey!</p>

<p>After a time I grew calmer. The sound of the pick continued from
without and I listened to it with growing resignation. Presently it
intermitted and then I heard the sharper sound of the hammer
striking the sounding rod. Not a soothing sound it might be
thought; and yet it comforted me. For it told me that what I had
struck was certainly not the treasure and that, so far, the villain
Burbler had drawn a blank. Supposing the treasure was not there,
after all! What an anticlimax that would be! And what an awful fool
the Sergeant would look!</p>

<p>The old proverb that "the wish is father to the thought" now
received an apt illustration in the psychic phenomena that my
reflections exhibited. So long as the hidden treasure was
potentially mine, I had dwelt rather exclusively on the evidence
that it was there; but now that it was potentially Burbler's I
found myself dwelling rather on the facts that suggested that it
was not there. And, really, when one came to consider the facts, it
did look as if I had jumped at a somewhat hasty conclusion. The
harp and the cross and the anchors three, which I had brushed aside
as not so very material, now began to loom up as factors of prime
importance. It seemed as if the circumstances required careful
reconsideration.</p>

<p>And now, for the first time, I began to give that mystical
jingle of old Simon's really systematic thought. I went over it
line by line and applied its quaint phrases to the present
conditions. And the more I did so, the less they seemed to fit.
Gradually, I came to the conclusion that I had made a false shot; a
mere hasty guess. That the foot of the mulberry tree could not be
the place where the treasure was buried at all, and that the whole
of the data needed to be revised.</p>

<p>And all the time, the sound of the pick and spade drifted in
monotonously through the little grating.</p>

<p>A couple of hours passed. Slowly my ideas, from a formless
ambiguity, began to crystallize into something like definite shape.
A few minutes more of concentrated thought and I should have
evolved a more or less complete solution of the riddle. But at that
moment the sound of the pick ceased; heavy footsteps clumped along
the passage; the cellar door was unbolted and flung open; and
Sergeant Burbler entered, wiping his forehead with a very dirty
hand.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mr Cobb," he said, irritably, "do you know where
that stuff is, or don't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm hanged if I do," said I, "unless you've got it."</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't. And I don't believe it was ever there."</p>

<p>"Neither do I. But you haven't wasted your time, you know,
Sergeant. It might have been there. It was just as well to make
sure. I'm very much obliged to you for all the trouble you've
taken. Perhaps you wouldn't mind unfastening these things now; then
I can help you to fill up the hole."</p>

<p>Sulkily and with an air of deep depression, Burbler released me
from the handcuffs and the lashings. He offered no apology for his
conduct, and I asked for none. When I had stretched myself and
secured another spade, we went out into the garden to repair
damages. Under the mulberry tree yawned a wide and deep pit,
bridged by the thick root on which my sounding rod had struck. The
sergeant and I fell to at once with our spades to fill up the hole;
and though we both worked with a will, it was with very different
feelings. Burbler was silent and gloomy. Perhaps he was considering
what he should say to Mrs Hodger. As to me, the "might have been"
was with me no more, but only that which yet might be.</p>

<p>As I gleefully shovelled in the earth it seemed that perhaps
success might, after all, rise, Phoenix-like, from the ashes of a
dead and gone failure.</p>

<h2><a name="ch" id="ch"></a>CHAPTER SIX &mdash; THE MAGIC
MIRROR</h2>

<p class="first">HUMAN knowledge may be roughly divided into two categories: that
which we acquire at school, and that which is of some practical
use. Occasionally the two divisions overlap, as in the case of
schoolmasters or crammers, who contrive to squeeze a livelihood out
of their schooling; but in general they are completely separate. No
academic course would have helped me one jot to solve the riddle of
Simon Glynn's treasure, whereas one or two items of somewhat
out-of-the-way knowledge&mdash;but I am rather anticipating. Let me
tell the story in its proper sequence.</p>

<p>It was the morning after the excavation under the mulberry tree.
That had failed. Previous attempts of mine had failed; and the
explorations of innumerable treasure-seekers before me had failed.
And all for the same simple reason. None of us had given the
problem sufficient preliminary thought. We had all, apparently,
jumped from one or two clues to the solution; and the solution had
turned out to be the wrong one every time.</p>

<p>I walked up and down the little green in front of the Royal
George, and my fellow lodger sat in the orchard at the side of the
house in his shirtsleeves and a pair of hideous carpet slippers,
reading yesterday's paper and keeping an eye on me. For Burbler was
no longer an investigator; his rle was to shadow me and suck my
brains. Even now, he was watching me like a cat, to see if I looked
as if I had hit on another clue.</p>

<p>I paced to and fro, thinking profoundly. There should be no more
guesswork. I would go over the whole set of facts from the
beginning and consider them systematically to see if I could not
evolve some theory that would fit them all.</p>

<p>As I paced to and fro, deep in thought, I passed and repassed
the signpost. And thus, glancing at it at each turn, I noticed for
the first time what a very singular post it was. And then I began
to look at it more particularly and note those peculiarities in
which it differed from other signposts that I had seen.</p>

<p>In the first place, it was not planted in the ground, but set in
a socket in a great block of stone. Then its lower third was
encased in lead sheathing, very neatly finished, though now
disguised by paint. The top was protected by a long iron cap to
which the ironwork of the sign was attached, and the wooden shaft
itself showed, through the crust of paint, obscure traces of
strap-work carving. Looking attentively at the iron scrollwork, I
made out with some difficulty &mdash;for here, too, generations of
painters had left their marks&mdash;four small figures, which
together made the date 1636. Then the ironwork was actually that
originally put up by Glynn; and it looked as if the post itself was
the original one, which, indeed, it might easily have been, for,
with its stone base, its lead sheathing, and its iron cap, it was
so perfectly protected from damp that it might still last for a
century or two.</p>

<p>But why this extraordinary care to preserve the wooden post? Oak
was not such a very costly commodity in Glynn's time, and the stone
base must have cost more than a dozen posts. Why, then, these
elaborate precautions?</p>

<p>I turned this question over as I walked up and down with my eyes
fixed meditatively on the sign. And then, in a flash, I saw it: and
called myself a whole battalion of idiots for not having seen it
before.</p>

<p>I looked up, I say, at the sign, which showed a portrait of a
royal personage who wore a tie-wig and had a face somewhat like a
well-scrubbed mangold-wurzel&mdash;George the third, in fact. But
it was obvious that in Glynn's day the sign of this tavern could
not have been the Royal George. And if one asked what the original
sign was, the answer came at once from the sculptured mermaid on
the back gable. That elaborate panel was not a cottage tablet but a
tavern sign. Hence, too, the reason why that panel was at the back
of the house; for the front had the painted mermaid on the
signboard. And, of course, it was this sign and not the sculptured
figure that was the "Maid from the Sea on high."</p>

<p>But, if this was so, where was the "tree" that was referred to
in the rhyme? Again the answer was obvious. In Glynn's day the old
use of the word "tree" as a synonym for "wood" still lingered; as,
indeed, it does today in such words as roof-tree, chess-tree,
trestle-tree, axle-tree, treenail (a wooden peg), and many others.
Moreover, in those days, a large post actually was a tree; an
entire trunk of suitable size shaped with the adze. The signpost
itself was the tree.</p>

<p>And now I understood&mdash;or believed I understood&mdash;those
elaborate arrangements to preserve the post from decay, and to
avoid disturbance of the ground if it did decay. The treasure was
hidden at the foot of the post; and those precautions were taken to
guard against its chance discovery by workmen engaged in carrying
out repairs. For Simon had specially stipulated for "wit" on the
part of the finder.</p>

<p>So far, it all looked very complete and consistent. But this was
not to be guesswork. I must fairly consider the objections. And
there were two serious defects in this theory. In the first place
there was no vestige of any harp or cross; and in the second the
"ankores three" were conspicuously absent. These seemed to be fatal
objections to my theory as to the whereabouts of the treasure, and,
for the moment, I was a good deal discouraged. But then I
remembered that this was a riddle intentionally made difficult, and
that if its solution had been more obvious it would not have
remained, after all these years, for me to solve. Accordingly I
addressed myself to the first difficulty; that of the harp and
cross.</p>

<p>Now, the association of ideas presents some very curious
phenomena. You may have two or more separate ideas, each of which,
by itself, is meaningless and vague; but bring them together and
forthwith they yield a compound idea of the utmost significance. So
it happened now. The words "harp and cross" had, from the first,
vaguely suggested to me some half-forgotten incident which I could
not recall. And again, when I had read on Simon Glynn's monument
the motto, "God with us," I had felt some chord of memory vibrate,
but had been too preoccupied to analyze the impression. Just now,
however, I was in an analytical mood and I recalled both these
vague recollections and asked myself what they meant. And then, in
a moment, the two ideas ran together and led me back straight to
their joint origin.</p>

<p>The incident occurred in front of one of the cabinets of a
coin-collecting friend. He had just taken out a Commonwealth
twenty-shilling piece and handed it to me.</p>

<p>"There, Cobb," he had said, "that is a piece of old Oliver's.
Observe the pious inscription, 'God with us.' This is the coin, you
know, that Pepys refers to as 'the old Harp and Cross money.'"</p>

<p>I recalled it now, perfectly, and the appearance of the piece,
with the device of the Harp and Cross and the motto, "God with us."
This, of course, was the money that was struck when Simon Glynn was
at the mint.</p>

<p>It was all clear enough now. The Harp and Cross were not marks
on the hiding place of the treasure. They were on the treasure
itself. The words in the rhyme, were, in fact, a trap set by the
"whimsicall" Simon to catch the unwary; and the unwary had been
caught in very considerable numbers.</p>

<p>The difficulty of the "ankores three" now seemed to melt away of
itself; for the quibble of the Harp and Cross suggested a simple
solution. It was a pun on Simon's coat of arms, the three anchors;
as was, indeed, suggested by the ambiguous spelling of the word
"ankores," which left the reader free to render it "anchors" or
"ankers" according to his judgment. For my part, I had no doubt
whatever. Here was old Simon's tavern in the midst of the smuggling
country with a tidal river flowing past its very door. Many an
anker of Dutch liquor must have drifted up from Sandwich in those
good old days, and many an empty anker must have cumbered the
cellar. What more natural than that the jovial Simon should have
used these convenient vessels for treasure chests?</p>

<p>I trust that I am not a conceited man; but I must admit that I
paid myself a few handsome compliments on my ingenuity. For here I
had a complete and reasonable solution of that cryptic rhyme which
had puzzled generations of eager treasure-seekers. Three ankers
filled with gold Harp and Cross money buried at the foot of the
signpost on top of which swung the sign of the mermaid. That was
the solution. It was simple, and it covered every word of the
rhyme, which no previous solution had done. All that remained was
to gather the reward of my ingenuity. Others had "stepped over;" it
was for me, the chosen one, to "take itt" and fulfil Simon's
prophecy as to his legatee.</p>

<p>This was all very well. But "itt" was by no means conveniently
situated. The signpost stood some twenty yards from the house at
the side of a public road, and was, moreover, planted in a block of
stone weighing a ton or two. To disinter the ankers would involve
mining operations on a scale that would attract the attention, not
only of Burbler and Mrs Hodger, but of the whole countryside.</p>

<p>Here was another setback. But I was not daunted by it; a
moment's reflection convinced me that the difficulty&mdash;which
was as great in Glynn's time as now&mdash;must have been provided
for. Simon could never have meant the successful candidate to dig
up the signpost. There must be some easier means of access to the
treasure&mdash;probably from the inside of the house. I had seen,
at Elham Manor, what Glynn could do in the way of secret chambers
and hidden doors; there was nothing for it but to explore the
interior of the inn. But it was a little disappointing, just when I
thought I had solved the riddle, to have a new and difficult
problem presented, especially since I knew that every movement of
mine would be eagerly watched by Burbler.</p>

<p>And then it was that, puzzling over this new difficulty, I had a
really brilliant idea; an inspiration, in fact.</p>

<p>It had often struck me as a little odd that Glynn should have
elected to engrave his doggerel on the frame of a mirror. It was
very inconvenient, for the inscription had to be zigzagged round
the four sides in an awkwardly narrow space. A salver, or even a
tankard or goblet, would have offered a much more convenient
surface and would not have broken up the verse. Why had he chosen a
mirror frame? Had he any special reason for his choice? And if he
must have had a mirror, why a silver one? Glass mirrors were in
common use in his time.</p>

<p>The study of optics has always had somewhat of a fascination for
me; and especially that branch of it which deals with the quaint
and the marvellous; in fact, with what one may call "optical
magic." And thus it happened that as I cogitated on Simon Glynn's
mirror with its cryptic rhyme, a very curious suggestion occurred
to me.</p>

<p>I wonder how many people are acquainted with that queer product
of old Japan, the "magic mirror?" A good many specimens exist. I
have had the privilege of examining one or two myself. In its usual
form, it is a smallish hand mirror with a face of polished speculum
metal and a richly-ornamented back; and the centre of the back is
always occupied by a device&mdash;usually the figure of a dragon or
bird&mdash;deeply and elaborately chased. Used in the ordinary way,
it presents nothing unusual. If you look into one, you see a
reflection of your face&mdash; just an ordinary reflection, quite
plain and free from distortion. But if you catch a gleam of
sunlight on the polished face and throw the reflection on a smooth
surface such as a whitewashed wall, a most remarkable and uncanny
effect is produced. The device on the back of the mirror is plainly
visible in the patch of reflected light on the wall, where it
appears as a dark shape with a bright halo. It sounds like a sheer
impossibility, and to an observer who isn't "in the know" it looks
like black magic. The sort of magic, by the way, that Simon Glynn
would have enjoyed. Which brings me back to my brilliant idea:
Supposing Glynn's mirror should be a magic mirror!</p>

<p>These meditations had brought me unconsciously to a halt at the
end of the green, opposite the orchard. Happening to glance up, I
became aware of Burbler, sitting erect in his chair and eyeing me
intently. I suppose that something of the excitement that surged
within me was apparent in my face. That, in short, my expression
had suggested a fresh clue.</p>

<p>Hang Burbler! This spying and watching was distracting to a
degree. And it was worse than distracting. I was now in a fever to
test my new idea; but I wasn't going to test it in Burbler's
presence. There was only one thing to be done. I had my hat and
boots on and a sovereign or so in my pockets. I had better take a
flying start while I had the chance.</p>

<p>I took one or two more turns up and down the green to put
Burbler off his guard; then, when I reached the end of my walk,
instead of turning yet again, I quickened my pace and strode off
along the road. As I passed the orchard Burbler leaped from his
chair, dropped his newspaper and made a bolt for the
house&mdash;obviously to put on his boots and coat; and I, having
walked quickly to a bend in the road, vaulted over a stile and ran
at the top of my speed along the footpath that formed the short cut
into Canterbury.</p>

<p>As I ran, I continued my speculations on Simon Glynn's mirror;
and the more I thought about it the more likely did it seem that
the little silver plate held the final clue. For, after all, the
miracle of the Japanese mirror is quite a simple affair and I
expect many of the old working goldsmiths and silversmiths knew all
about it. It is just a matter of the hardening of metal under a
hammered tool.</p>

<p>If you work a device, with chasing tool and hammer, on the back
of a plate of annealed metal, that device will show through quite
distinctly on the face in slight relief. If this relief is ground
away on a wet stone, the device will, of course, disappear. But it
has not really gone. For though the face of the plate is now
perfectly even, the device is still there in the substance of the
metal. Wherever the tool has struck, the metal is hardened right
through; and as soon as the face is polished, the hardness of the
worked area will cause the device to reappear. Its projection will
be so infinitesimal as to be imperceptible to the eye, but it will
be quite sufficient to deflect rays of parallel light and cause the
device to be visible in the reflection. Even if the design is
stoned off the back as well as the face, the hardness will remain
and the device will still show in the reflection though it has
disappeared from both surfaces of the plate. So that the process
would offer a plan after the very heart of a whimsically secretive
man like Simon Glynn.</p>

<p>By the time I entered the streets of Canterbury, I had shaped an
immediate course of action. My first objective was a shop in which
I had seen some very efficient-looking electric torches; and, as I
knew the price and had the money ready in my hand, the purchase was
only a matter of seconds. With the torch in my pocket, I made a
beeline for the museum, and, passing through the galleries as
rapidly as I dared, proceeded to the room in the annexe in which
Glynn's mirror was exhibited.</p>

<p>It was a critical moment. An inopportune visitor or attendant
would have spoiled all; for Burbler would, no doubt, come straight
to the museum, as the only place of which he knew as connected with
our common quest. But fortune was kind. The room and the adjoining
corridor were empty, and the mirror stood in its position on a side
table. I took the precaution to open and inspect the curtained
sedan chair, which was the only possible hiding place in the room;
and, having shut it again, I looked round, listened, and then, with
a thumping heart, approached the mirror.</p>

<p>The little silver object stood, as I have said, on a high side
table, inclined at an angle of forty-five degrees&mdash;just the
right position for me. I gave its face a hasty wipe with my silk
handkerchief, stepped back a couple of paces, pointed the
bull's-eye of my torch and pressed the switch. As the beam of light
fell on the mirror, a bright oblong patch appeared on the ceiling
above it. But not a mere, plain patch of reflected light. On the
bright space I could make out in dim and shadowy, but quite
legible, lettering, the words:</p>

<p class="sign">"Pull out ye 3rd Stepp."</p>

<p>I switched off the light, slipped the torch into my pocket and
made my way out of the room as quickly as I had entered. For now I
knew all that I wanted to know, and my business was to escape
Burbler, at any rate until I had decided on my next move. And I was
none too soon. As I passed a staircase window, I saw the sergeant
taking the entrance steps two at a time, and I had barely slipped
into the picture gallery when he flew past the door on his way to
the "mirror room."</p>

<p>As his steps died away I came forth from the gallery and hurried
out of the building before he should return in search of me. My
immediate need was that of a quiet place where I could reflect on
what I had just learned and decide what to do next. The streets
were not very restful with Burbler prowling up and down in search
of me; eventually I drifted into the cathedral precincts, and
sought sanctuary in a remote corner of the cloisters.</p>

<p>"Pull out ye 3rd Stepp."</p>

<p>I smiled as I repeated to myself that quaint message, whispered
to me, as it were, in confidence across the gulf of two centuries.
How like the pleasant and "whimsicall" Simon! For, of course, that
direction, intelligible enough to me, would have been perfectly
meaningless to anyone else. The question would have arisen, "what
third step?" But I understood. The direction was addressed to the
person of "wit" who had read the riddle. To me, in fact. And I knew
that there was only one set of steps that bore any relation to the
foot of the signpost; but those steps I knew very well indeed,
having sat opposite them, manacled and bound, for a matter of three
hours. The cellar steps of the Royal George (late The Mermaid) inn
answered the conditions exactly; and since there were five of them,
the middle step was the third whichever way one counted.</p>

<p>It was all plain sailing so far. I should pull out the third
step and probably find the entrance to a forgotten smugglers'
hiding hole under the signpost. That was what it looked like. But
there was Burbler. He was the fly in the ointment; and a mighty big
fly, too; a regular bluebottle. If he spotted me going down to the
cellar, he would be on my heels in a moment, and then the whole
thing would be blown upon. I should be lucky if I got even a share
of the treasure, for Burbler had shown himself a greedy,
unscrupulous rascal.</p>

<p>No. Before I ventured to approach the hiding place I must, by
hook or by crook, get rid of Burbler. That was the pressing
necessity of the moment.</p>

<p>I have remarked on a previous occasion that necessity is the
mother of invention. The aphorism is not mine. It has been said
before; and I merely quote it as an appropriate observation.
Because, at the end of an hour's pacing of the cloisters and after
enough concentrated thought to furnish out a royal commission, I
had evolved quite a pretty little scheme.</p>

<p>There is more than one kind of magic mirror. I have described
the less known variety. A more familiar kind, known to us in our
childhood and sold in the toy shops of that prehistoric age, had
somewhat different properties. You presented it to your most
intimate and valued friend and invited him to breathe on it in
order that he might see himself as others saw him. He accordingly
breathed on it; whereupon there appeared on its surface a lifelike
representation of a donkey's head.</p>

<p>There was nothing miraculous about it. I learned the secret of
manufacture from a Hebrew gentleman who sold second-hand furniture.
He was in the habit of writing the prices on his looking-glasses
with a piece of soap, and he made the interesting discovery that if
he wiped off the soap-marked figures with a dry cloth and polished
the glass, although the latter then appeared perfectly clear and
bright, yet the figures would reappear quite distinctly if the
glass was breathed upon.</p>

<p>Now here was a valuable piece of knowledge&mdash;not acquired
through academic channels. It seemed to me that, with its aid, I
might treat Sergeant Burbler to a little communication from the
late Simon Glynn. And if the communication were discreetly worded,
it might furnish him with enough occupation to keep him out of
mischief while I transacted my business with the cellar steps.
There was only one really serious difficulty. Burbler had got to be
made to read that mystic message from the long-departed Simon; and
I didn't quite see how to do it.</p>

<p>From the cathedral precincts I stole out warily into Burgate
Street and wandered about until I encountered an oil shop, where I
purchased a small tablet of soap. Cutting a slice from this, I
shaped it to the form of a moderately sharp crayon which I
carefully wrapped in paper and dropped in my pocket. Then I
executed a highly strategic advance on the museum. It was a
delicate affair, for if I ran against Burbler it was quite probable
that he would freeze on, and then I should have to postpone my
little manoeuvre; which would be most exasperating. For I need
hardly say that I was suffering an agony of impatience to get back
to the inn and see what was behind the "third Stepp."</p>

<p>I walked up to the entrance, and, after a precautionary look
round, bolted in. There was no sign of Burbler. Breathlessly I
threaded my way through the galleries, ready at a moment's notice
to slip behind a door or showcase, until I came to the corridor
that led into the "mirror room." Here I paused for a moment,
looking through into the room. A party of American tourists was in
occupation at the moment, but otherwise the room seemed to be
empty. I accordingly entered boldly, and, while the Americans were
taking their lightning impressions of the exhibits, I passed the
time by examining the interior of the sedan chair&mdash;to make
sure that the place really was empty, after all.</p>

<p>The Americans, having filled their intellectual crops with
characteristic rapidity, departed, leaving me in sole possession:
whereupon I took another glance round, shut the door of the sedan
chair, and stepped over to the mirror. There was no time to be
lost. Burbler might arrive at any moment and rob me of my
opportunity. Taking out my soap crayon, I wrote carefully on the
silver surface in antique, but very legible characters the
following mystical words:</p>

<p class="sign">"Under ye floare of ye litell blew Chamber."</p>
<br>

<p>I was not very satisfied with the result, for, owing to the
dryness of the soap, the writing was almost invisible. However,
when I had polished it off with my handkerchief until every sign of
it was gone and then breathed heavily on the mirror, I was quite
reassured; for the inscription stood out with the distinctness of
engraving. But only for one instant. As the steamy film faded away,
the writing faded with it; and, when I turned away, the surface of
the mirror was as bright and blank as before the guileful crayon
touched it.</p>

<p>The problem now was how to catch Burbler&mdash;or, rather, how
to let him catch me. It would take some nice management, and I
mustn't be caught prematurely. I had a roughly-shaped plan, and, as
that plan was connected with the public library&mdash;which was in
the same building &mdash;I made my way thither to think it over. I
looked round a little anxiously as I entered the reference room and
was half-relieved and half-disappointed to find that the sergeant
was not there. I didn't want him until I had completed my little
preparations, but, on the other hand, it would be an absolute
disaster if he had given up the pursuit and gone back to the
inn.</p>

<p>But again fortune favoured me. Before reconnoitring the shelves,
I happened to glance out of the window at the street below. And
there he was, ostensibly gaping into a shop window, but actually
keeping a watch on the entrance of the museum. So I shouldn't have
to go out and angle for him in the town if I could attract his
attention.</p>

<p>I snatched a large volume from a shelf and, going close to the
window, pored over the open book with as intent an expression as I
could assume, watching Burbler out of the tail of my eye. For some
time he failed to notice me, but continued, to my annoyance, to
glance furtively up and down the street and across at the museum
entrance. But at last he caught sight of me; on which his interest
in the shop window lapsed and he darted across the road.</p>

<p>I replaced the book on the shelf, and, running my eye along the
volumes of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, selected the one marked
"Mem&mdash;Mos," and laid it on the table. Seating myself, I
produced a sheet of paper and a pencil, and, opening the volume at
the article "Mirror," assumed an air of eager preoccupation.
Presently the door opened softly. I didn't dare to look round, but
my ear gave me the information that I wanted. For Burbler's
favourite boots had a peculiar soft creak, almost entirely confined
to the right boot; and when I heard that creak proceeding
stealthily round the room behind me I knew that the critical moment
had come. If he spoke to me my plan would have failed and I should
have to devise some other.</p>

<p>I had written large and legibly at the head of my paper the
words "Experiments on metallic mirrors," and I now began to copy
out chance sentences from the article in a much smaller
handwriting. Meanwhile the creaky boot lingered behind me opposite
the book-shelves and presently began to approach by easy stages
until I was conscious of someone standing close behind my chair. I
scribbled frantically, almost perspiring with anxiety. Would he
take the bait? He was certainly looking over my shoulder; he could
hardly fail to make out the heading to my notes. But would he adopt
the suggestion that I was offering? It was a very obvious one and
he was no fool; but there was the danger that he might fail to
reason as I was trying to make him reason. And then he wouldn't do
what I wanted him to do.</p>

<p>The creak softly retreated. I heard a book returned to the shelf
behind me; and then that tell-tale boot moved stealthily but rather
quickly towards the entrance. A door opened and closed; and,
listening intently, I could distinguish the creak moving away
pretty quickly in the direction of the galleries. It really looked
as if the worthy sergeant had swallowed the bait.</p>

<p>I didn't act precipitately. I gave him a good five minutes'
start in case he should be hampered by the presence of visitors.
Then I replaced the volume, and, pocketing my notes, set forth on
my third visit to the shrine of Simon Glynn. I have never been more
anxious or less confident. For it was a pure gamble. I had
endeavoured to convey into Burbler's mind the impression that I was
about to make some experiments on Glynn's mirror; and I now had to
act on the assumption that I had conveyed that impression and that
Burbler would take some measures to be present at the experiments.
Whereas I might have failed utterly. And to make things more
disquieting, I had discovered, too late, that the article in the
Encyclopaedia actually contained a brief description of Chinese and
Japanese magic mirrors. However, it couldn't be helped.</p>

<p>The "mirror room" was fortunately in its normal state of
emptiness. I stole in with a secret and nervous air and looked
round. I hardly dared to look at the sedan chair, but yet I
couldn't resist just one instantaneous glance as I entered. And
that glance yielded distinct encouragement. For the door of the
chair was not completely shut. But when I had looked in last I had
been careful to shut it; and that door had a snap catch which could
not be opened from within. Two very significant facts. <i>Verbum
sap</i>.</p>

<p>I stole up to the mirror, and, opening my mouth wide, breathed
noisily two or three times. The polished surface clouded and the
soaped inscription leaped out and grinned in my face. There was no
possibility of missing it. I stared at it fatuously for a second or
two; then I turned and walked quickly on tiptoe out of the room and
down the corridor. But instead of turning away down the next
gallery, I quietly slipped behind a large harem screen of Cairene
lattice-work which stood at the end of the corridor. Through the
chinks of the lattice I could command a view of part of the room,
including the sedan chair and the mirror, though quite invisible
myself; and I accordingly glued my eye to one of the chinks and
watched in an agony of suspense.</p>

<p>Several seconds passed. And every second I grew more and yet
more nervous. And then came the blessed relief. Very slowly and
softly the door of the sedan chair opened and out popped a
head&mdash;Burbler's, of course. He looked round and listened for a
moment, and, seeing no one in the room or corridor, forth he came
like a cautious hermit crab emerging from a whelk shell. Shutting
the door silently he stole across to the mirror and bent over
it.</p>

<p>I stared through the lattice in positive ecstasy. There was no
doubt what he was doing; his muzzle was within four inches of the
mirror and his mouth gaped like that of a moribund haddock. But he
didn't stay long in that position. One moment I saw him gaping at
the mirror; the next he was coming down the corridor like Farmer
Babbage's bull.</p>

<p>I gave him a few seconds' start. I heard him stamp through two
galleries and down a flight of stairs and then I took up the
pursuit. When I came out into the street, he was just turning the
corner, evidently making for the short cut back to the inn. Taking
a different turning, I ran as hard as I could until I reached the
outskirts of the town, when I slowed down into a jaunty walk.
Presently Burbler came in sight, stepping out as if he was in for
the one-mile handicap&mdash;as, in fact, he was&mdash;on a path
which joined mine a couple of hundred yards farther on. As soon as
he saw me, he broke into a furious run, and, of course, I followed
suit. But I let him draw ahead so that he reached the junction
first; by which I secured the advantage of keeping him in sight and
seeing him knock his shins on the stile. I could even hear his
comments on the circumstance&mdash;which seemed to reflect unfairly
on the constructor of the stile&mdash;and note a singular
alteration in his gait; but I let him maintain the lead and even
increase it, for there was no sense in fatiguing myself
unnecessarily.</p>

<p>We both entered the inn by the back door in quick succession and
we both made straight for the little blue room&mdash;Burbler's
bedroom. When I arrived, the door was securely bolted on the inside
and earth-quaky sounds proceeded from within. It was a mercy that
our landlady, Mrs Hodger, was stone-deaf and kept no
assistants!</p>

<p>"Go away!" roared Burbler as I fumbled at the handle. "Go away!
I'm busy."</p>

<p>I sniggered softly. Busy he evidently was! But he would be more
busy before he'd finished. For it was a small room and it contained
a medium-sized bed, three large chests of drawers, a washstand and
a massive standing cupboard, besides other trifles. What there
wasn't in that room was space to swing a cat. Not, of course, that
Burbler wanted to swing a cat. He only wanted to take up the floor.
But a floor of massive oak plank is a bit of a handful in itself
without the contents of a pantechnicon on top of it. Burbler wasn't
going to be one of the unemployed. Busy indeed!</p>

<p>I thumped gleefully on the door, and, under cover of the noise
and Burbler's profanities from within, quietly shot the two strong
bolts on the outside. Then I gave Burbler a few words in season
through the keyhole, and, having listened unmoved to his obscene
responses, I took myself off to attend to my own little
business.</p>

<p>And now that the excitement of the chase&mdash;so to
speak&mdash;was over, a sudden chill of fear came over me.
Supposing that I had misread the riddle after all! What a frightful
anticlimax that would be, after bottling up my rival so neatly,
too. I ran down to the cellar almost sick with apprehension and
only just had presence of mind enough to bolt myself in.</p>

<p>There was no doubt as to which end of the third step I must
pull, for one end was embedded in the wall, while the other offered
a very handy corner to lay hold of. This corner I grasped and gave
one or two vigorous pulls; but the massive hardwood slab, which
appeared to be fixed in its place with large treenails, gave no
sign of yielding. Then I fetched a heavy mallet from the cupboard
where the tools were kept, and, laying my folded handkerchief on
the corner of the step, delivered two or three sharp taps. At the
first tap it became evident that the treenails were dummies, for
the step began to separate from its frame. A few more taps brought
it fairly away so that I was able to swing it round and then lift
it out bodily, leaving a large oblong hole with a dark cavity
beyond.</p>

<p>Lighting the candle-lantern, I held it inside the hole. The
cavity was walled and floored with brick and seemed to extend away
to the left; and as the air, though close and earthy, did not seem
to be foul, I climbed through the opening and began cautiously to
creep along a narrow passage. It was quite a long passage. I had
proceeded fully fifteen yards&mdash;in the direction of the
signpost, as I suddenly realized&mdash;when I came to a short
flight of brick steps, beyond which the passage opened on either
side into a range of vaults, each of which was occupied by rows of
casks or by racks of strange-looking, squat, short-necked
bottles.</p>

<p>There was something rather uncanny in the aspect of these casks
and bottles, full, as I suspected, of contraband liquor and now
mantled with the soft, grey dust of centuries. But I had little
attention to bestow on them, for now the light of the lantern fell
on a much more interesting object. Near the end of the passage was
a large stone baluster like the pillar of a sundial; on top of it
was a square slab of stone; and on the slab, three small kegs. They
were not really ankers. The opportunity for a pun had tempted old
Simon to stretch the facts, but that was a small matter. I ran
forward eagerly to examine the booty.</p>

<p>The kegs were of rather unusual finish and strength and were
fitted with thick copper hoops. All three were broached, for the
heads and the spare hoops lay by their sides; and each keg was
covered by a tile, thickly coated with dust. I had those tiles off
in a twinkling, and found, as I had expected, a layer of neatly
arranged gold coins, each set so as to exhibit the Harp and Cross
device and the motto, "God with us."</p>

<p>I drew a deep breath of relief. The lurking fear that some
previous explorer had visited the hiding place was now set at rest.
And yet I was conscious of a slight disappointment&mdash;such is
the avarice begotten of treasure-hunting. For, after all, the
promised ankers had dwindled to little kegs of barely a gallon
capacity. It could only be a matter of a thousand or two at the
most. And yet, perhaps, it was as well; for I could probably carry
these, one at a time, to the boat (which was the means of transport
that I had selected); whereas I could not even have moved an anker
filled with gold coins. Here I lifted one of the kegs, to test its
weight; and a most horrible shock I received. For though it was
inconveniently heavy for hasty removal, it was not heavy enough for
a keg of gold. I grabbed up a handful of the gold coins; and
behold! my fist was half full of sawdust!</p>

<p>Horror! Was this another of Simon's beastly jokes?</p>

<p>I thrust my hand deep into the keg. No coins could I feel with
my groping fingers, but plenty of sawdust; and embedded in it a
number of rough, irregularly-shaped objects, one of which I fished
out and held to the lantern. And then my chagrin was changed into
delirious joy. For the object was a massive thumb-ring set with a
great green stone; apparently an emerald, and worth a hatful of
gold. I dived into another keg and brought up a pendant set with
large, rose-cut diamonds; and the third yielded at the first cast a
beautiful miniature of an elderly man &mdash;perhaps Simon
himself&mdash;with a broad, diamond-studded frame.</p>

<p>I waited to investigate no more. Quickly heading up the kegs, I
slipped on the hoops and tapped them into place with one of the
tiles. The little casks were all prepared for convenient removal,
for the end hoops were fitted with strong copper rings through
which were rove stout slings of rawhide; and these, thanks to the
protection from rats and vermin offered by the stone pillar, were
perfectly sound and strong. I lifted the kegs down, and, finding
that I could just stagger under the weight of the three, was about
to make my way out, when, suddenly, I bethought me of Burbler. I
should have to carry my booty out to the landing stage, for there
was no time to move the boat to a safer place; and it was just
possible that Burbler might see me from the window; and if he did,
he would certainly give chase. I should have to land somewhere, and
as he could easily keep up with the boat and observe where I
landed, I should have no chance of getting away, encumbered with so
heavy a burden.</p>

<p>What was to be done?</p>

<p>I thought furiously for a few moments, and then I saw the
solution. I must have yet another red herring to draw across my
trail if necessary. The suggestion of the plan came from a pile of
empty kegs&mdash;the memorials of many a forgotten smuggling trip.
The wine bins were full of sawdust and a number of short lengths of
rusty chain were stacked in a corner. I don't know what they had
been used for, but I know that they came in mighty useful just now;
for it took me but a few minutes to fill up three of the empty kegs
with them and to add a packing of sawdust and head them up. Then I
was ready to start.</p>

<p>I carried the six kegs out into the cellar, and uncommonly heavy
they were, especially those filled with chain. Then I carefully
replaced the step and banged it home until there was no sign of its
having been disturbed; after which, having put away the mallet, I
proceeded to the actual embarkation. Caution suggested that I
should take up the three dummy kegs first, as I should have to
leave them unguarded in the boat while I fetched the others, and I
accordingly carried them up. It was growing dusk by this time, and
a cloudy evening too, but not dark enough to cover my movements
from Burbler if he should chance to look out of the window. But he
didn't. I got the three dummies stowed in the boat safely and
returned unobserved; and loud rumblifications from the Blue Room
told me that my rival was still busy.</p>

<p>I had just brought up the second three, after blowing out the
candle in the lantern, and was close to the landing stage, when a
cessation of the noises from above caused me to look up. And it was
lucky that I did; for there was Burbler at the window in his
shirtsleeves, gazing at me with an expression that would have
curdled a can of sterilized milk. Stock-still he stood for a couple
of seconds and then vanished; and as I bolted to the landing stage,
I heard him furiously shaking the door in his efforts to get
out.</p>

<p>I lowered the kegs into the boat, jumped in myself, cast off the
painter, snatched up the sculls and pulled away frantically
downstream against the weakening flood tide. And as I moved away
into the dusk, the shattering of glass and the raising of a window
told me that Burbler had given up the door in favour of the easy
drop down into the garden.</p>

<p>The gathering gloom and the mists that were rising in the
water-meadows made it difficult to see if I was being pursued; but
I had no doubt that Burbler was following the boat under cover of
the scattered bushes and the embankments of the dykes. I turned the
situation over as I plied the sculls. The only practicable place at
which to land was Grove Ferry, some miles farther down; and Burbler
knew that and would be there when I arrived. He would know that I
couldn't carry that weight across country.</p>

<p>But there was one place where I should lose him for a minute or
two; a place where the river made a horseshoe bend, enclosing a
little peninsula that was cut off from the mainland by a broad and
deep dyke. The dyke was impassable as I knew from experience, and
the fringing willows would screen me for a few minutes. At that
place, then, the next act must be played.</p>

<p>It took me over half an hour to get there, during which I twice
caught a glimpse of a shadowy figure climbing over a dyke gate and
instantly vanishing&mdash;presumably behind a bank. At length I
passed the entrance to the broad dyke. The river swept away to the
right and a forest of willows rose to cut me off from any possible
observation. Instantly I ran the boat on the opposite
bank&mdash;with the river between me and Burbler&mdash;and, making
fast to an overhanging tree, landed the three genuine kegs and
carried them into a meadow. Staggering along the bank of a straight
dyke (or drainage ditch), I bore my burden to the first gate; and
here I regretfully sank them to the muddy bottom in about two feet
of water. Returning to the river and carefully noting the position
of the tree to which I had made fast the boat, I cast off the
painter and once more took to the sculls, pulling with all my might
to make up for lost time; and as I passed the outlet of the broad
dyke, I had the satisfaction of making out quite distinctly a human
head in a hat which I recognized, peering over the low
embankment.</p>

<p>It was fully half a mile lower down that I made my second
landing. At that point was a ruinous hovel&mdash;once, no doubt, a
shepherd's hut, but now disused. Here, I thought I would secrete
the three dummies and then pull back and recover my treasure, by
which time Burbler would have purloined the dummies and made off,
leaving the coast clear for me to pull down to Grove Ferry.</p>

<p>It was a neat scheme. But it didn't come off quite as I had
expected; for I made the mistake of going ashore to reconnoitre;
and I had hardly reached the hut when I heard a loud splash, and
when I looked round, there was that confounded Burbler in the boat
pulling away upstream like clockwork. It was frightfully annoying;
for now it was I who was on the wrong side of the river. Moreover
Burbler would discover the fraud prematurely and then I should have
him shadowing me again and preventing me from recovering my
treasure.</p>

<p>But this would never do. Those kegs might be discovered at
daybreak by some shepherd or herdsman. Somehow I must recover them
tonight and hide them more securely; and with this resolution, I
faced about and headed upstream with the intention of making for
Fordwich Bridge.</p>

<p>I set off at a leisurely pace, keeping by the river until I was
cut off from it by the big dyke, which I followed to the spot where
it joined the river. And here I got a great surprise; for as I came
out on the riverside path, I perceived a man a little distance
ahead hurrying in the same direction. Now as no one had passed me,
this man must have come from the river. With a sudden suspicion, I
broke into a run and overtook him. And my suspicion was correct. It
was Burbler. He thought I should return to the inn, and he meant to
be there when I arrived.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Mr Cobb!" he exclaimed. "You taking an evening walk,
too!"</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Burbler," said I. "What have you done with
those kegs?"</p>

<p>"Kegs?" he exclaimed vacantly. "What kegs?"</p>

<p>"The three kegs or ankers, with Glynn's treasure in them."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you found the treasure," he cried with a
miserable pretence of surprise.</p>

<p>"You know I did," said I; "and you've filched it."</p>

<p>"I assure you, Mr Cobb," he protested, "that I know nothing
about it."</p>

<p>Now it is useless to argue with a liar. I tried a new tack.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "someone has filched it. So there's the whole
thing gone. Every stiver. That is, unless I should have happened to
take the wrong kegs."</p>

<p>"The wrong kegs!" he gasped. "Why&mdash;how could you?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, that old fool Glynn must needs give you nine
ankers to choose from instead of simply hiding the three. I took
the three heaviest but I had no time to see what was in them. They
may be the wrong ones. I hope they are."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Burbler. And then he was silent and very
thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Now listen," I said, after a pause. "I'm going to make you an
offer. Will you share the treasure with me wherever it is?"</p>

<p>"I tell you I haven't got it," he replied doggedly; and I washed
my hands of him. I had given him a handsome chance and would have
been fool enough to stand by my promise. Now he shouldn't have
any.</p>

<p>"Will you share with me," I said, "if I tell you where the
hiding-place is?"</p>

<p>He shook his head and repeated that "he hadn't got it."</p>

<p>"Think it over," I urged. "I'll just walk on slowly and leave
you to consider my offer. Don't refuse offhand. You can overtake me
and give me your decision."</p>

<p>With this I strolled on and left him. I knew what he would do,
for neither the boat nor the dummies could be far away. But they
must have been nearer than I thought, for I had not gone above a
half a mile when I heard him running to overtake me and panting
heavily. I halted, and as he came up I asked:</p>

<p>"Well? What is your decision?"</p>

<p>"Phoo!" he gasped. "I've&mdash;phoo!&mdash;thought it
over&mdash;Mr Cobb&mdash;and it seems&mdash;ha&mdash;only fair
to&mdash;ha&mdash;let you have your half. Don't wanter be
greedy."</p>

<p>"Where are the kegs?" I asked.</p>

<p>"In the boat. Boat's in the dyke."</p>

<p>We turned back together and presently Burbler asked:</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;where did you say you found the stuff?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. "Wait till we've had a look at the kegs," I
replied.</p>

<p>A few minutes more brought us to the dyke, and there was the
boat, snugly stowed out of sight under a clump of bush-willows.
Burbler hauled it out by the sunken painter and displayed the three
kegs&mdash;all wet from recent submersion. We both got into the
boat and Burbler took the sculls, leaving me to examine the
kegs&mdash;all of which had been broached and hastily reheaded.</p>

<p>"Before you open them," said Burbler, "tell me where you found
them."</p>

<p>"In the cellar," I replied. "Pull out the middle step and you'll
find a secret passage. But I'll show you when we get back."</p>

<p>Burbler pulled a few strokes and then awkwardly ran into the
bank. He stood up as if to push off, but instead, leaped ashore
with both sculls in his hands and, giving the bow of the boat a
shove with his foot that sent her out into midstream, threw the
sculls away and ran off as hard as he could go towards the inn.</p>

<p>I laughed joyously as he disappeared into the darkness. A few
minutes paddling with my open hand brought the boat to the opposite
bank, where I landed and towed her down to the tree to which I had
secured her before and now again made fast. But I didn't need her
after all. For just as I had hauled up my three kegs from the dyke,
I heard the sound of wheels on a hidden byroad that crossed the
marshes hard by. It turned out to be the rural carrier's cart,
returning to Canterbury for the night, with ample accommodation for
one passenger and three small kegs. Less than an hour later I sat
alone and at peace in a first-class carriage bound for Charing
Cross; and on the hat-rack above reposed the "ankores three" with
their contents of "goode redd golde."</p>

<p>I live at Elham Manor nowadays, of which house I own the
freehold. The Royal George is also my property, subject to Mrs
Hodger's tenancy. At the inn resides, as a permanent boarder, a
pensioner of mine; a retired police officer, who spends most of his
time in the unsuccessful pursuit of the Fordidge trout. His name,
by the way, is Burbler.</p>
