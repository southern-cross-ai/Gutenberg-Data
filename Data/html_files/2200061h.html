<h3>FOREWORD</h3>

<p>I write this Foreword with enthusiasm, for these are the
assembled tales of a real master of the short story. The word
"great" has been so overdone, and the word "genius" is so
fly-blown, that I shall use neither. Suffice it to say that Stacy
Aumonier is one of the best short-story writers of all time, and
that there is certainly no one more readable. And yet he, so
untimely gone from us, has not yet attained the full eminence which
is his due, and which I believe this volume will secure for him. It
is for all and every; it will not date; it is gay reading, yet has
the depth of a queer truth and wisdom. In it we find the cream of
his literary output, for he was essentially a short-story writer
rather than a novelist. I have re-read all the stories in this
volume, and have been rejoiced and amazed, afresh, at the ease of
the style, the richness and precision of the observation, the
poignancy of the irony, and the humane breadth and tolerance of the
feeling and philosophy. It is not an exaggeration to say that from
first sentence to last my interest has never for a moment flagged.
This was a temperament singularly fitted for the recreation of
life's little comedies and tragedies.</p>

<p>The first essential in a short-story writer is the power of
interesting sentence by sentence. Aumonier had this power in prime
degree. You do not have to "get into" his stories. He is especially
notable for investing his figures with the breath of life within a
few sentences. Take a short story like "The Funny Man's
Day"&mdash;how wonderfully well we know that funny man not as a
type only but as a human being! How remarkably Miss Bracegirdle, in
twenty minutes of our time, becomes a permanent acquaintance! How
dreadfully intimate we get with the "Two Friends"! That story, by
the way, first of Aumonier's I ever read, first, I believe, ever
published, was never surpassed by him for power, and sardonic grip
on type and circumstance. It is as fine in its way as "Boule de
Suif," and that is to say almost as much as can be said in praise
of a short tale. There was, indeed, something Gallic in Aumonier's
temperament, or at least in his talent&mdash;not in his style,
which is very English, but in his way of envisaging his subjects.
This is not remarkable, considering his name and his face; but in
spite of his French look and his Huguenot origin, he was truly
English in his humour and attitude to life. French in mind, he was
English in heart; for no Frenchman&mdash;not even Monsieur
Andr&eacute; Maurois&mdash;could have conceived Alfred
Codling&mdash;"the man of letters," or "the Great
Unimpressionable," or "The Grayles," or the waitress in
"Overheard," or written "The Match," that perfect piece of English
atmosphere.</p>

<p>A short-story writer is always beset by the temptation to be
inventive rather than creative or even recreative. This is a
temptation to which Aumonier rarely if ever succumbed. He was
profoundly in love with life, and impregnated through and through
by curiosity about life and its manifestations, whether simple or
queer. All types were fish to his net; and he has given us the
fruits of his passion for and his curiosity about existence with a
deft and always interesting fidelity. And with what sympathy he can
hit off character! Take "The Happy Man," or the hero in "Old
Iron"&mdash;he feels and he can touch us with his feeling. He had
faith, too, in the unbelievable, and he could make it real, as the
unbelievable so often is in life. His humour is sly and dry and
frequent and wholly delightful. And how he puts his finger on weak
spots! Yet with what restraint he satirizes!</p>

<p>Stacy Aumonier is never heavy, never boring, never really
trivial; interested himself, he keeps us interested. At the back of
his tales there is belief in life and a philosophy of life, and of
how many short-story writers can that be said? He understands the
art of movement in a tale, he has the power of suggestion, he has a
sense of line that most of us should envy; he is wholly
uninfluenced by the dreary self-consciousness of novelty for
novelty's sake. He is not tricky. He follows no fashion and no
school. He is always himself. And can't he write? Ah! far better
than far more pretentious writers. Nothing escapes his eye, but he
describes without affectation or redundancy, and you sense in him a
feeling for beauty that is never obtruded. He gets values right,
and that is to say nearly everything. The easeful fidelity of his
style has militated against his reputation in these somewhat
posturing times. But his shade may rest in peace, for in this
volume, at least, he will outlive nearly all the writers of his
day.</p>

<h2><a name="ch01" id="ch01"></a>1. WHERE WAS WYCH STREET?</h2>

<p>In the public bar of the "Wagtail," in Wapping, four men and a
woman were drinking beer and discussing diseases. It was not a
pretty subject, and the company was certainly not a handsome one.
It was a dark November evening, and the dingy lighting of the bar
seemed but to emphasise the bleak exterior. Drifts of fog and damp
from without mingled with the smoke of shag. The sanded floor was
kicked into a muddy morass not unlike the surface of the pavement.
An old lady down the street had died from pneumonia the previous
evening, and the event supplied a fruitful topic of conversation.
The things that one could get! Everywhere were germs eager to
destroy one. At any minute the symptoms might break out. And
so&mdash;one foregathered in a cheerful spot amidst friends and
drank forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Prominent in this little group was Baldwin Meadows, a
sallow-faced villain with battered features and prominent
cheek-bones, his face cut and scarred by a hundred fights.
Ex-seaman, ex-boxer, ex-fish-porter&mdash;indeed, to everyone's
knowledge, ex-everything. No one knew how he lived. By his side
lurched an enormous coloured man who went by the name of Harry
Jones. Grinning above a tankard sat a pimply faced young man who
was known as "the Agent." Silver rings adorned his fingers. He had
no other name, and most emphatically no address, but he "arranged
things" for people, and appeared to thrive upon it in a scrambling,
fugitive manner. The other two people were Mr. and Mrs. Dawes. Mr.
Dawes was an entirely negative person, but Mrs. Dawes shone by
virtue of a high whining, insistent voice, keyed to within half a
note of hysteria.</p>

<p>Then, at one point, the conversation suddenly took a peculiar
turn. It came about through Mrs. Dawes mentioning that her aunt,
who died from eating tinned lobster, used to work in a corset shop
in Wych Street. When she said that, "the Agent," whose right eye
appeared to survey the ceiling, whilst his left eye looked over the
other side of his tankard, remarked:</p>

<p>"Where was WycH Street, ma?"</p>

<p>"Lord!" exclaimed Mrs. Dawes. "Don't you know, dearie? You must
be a young 'un, you must. Why, when, I was a gal everyone knew Wych
Street. It was just down there where they built the Kingsway,
like."</p>

<p>Baldwin Meadows cleared his throat and said:</p>

<p>"Wych Street used to be a turnin' runnin' from Long Acre into
Wellington Street."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, old boy," chipped in Mr. Dawes, who always treated the
ex-man with great deference. "If you'll excuse me, Wych Street was
a narrow lane at the back of the old Globe Theatre, that used to
pass by the church."</p>

<p>"I know what I'm talkin' about," growled Meadows.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dawes's high nasal whine broke in:</p>

<p>"Hi, Mr. Booth, you used ter know yer wye abaht. Where was Wych
Street?"</p>

<p>Mr. Booth, the proprietor, was polishing a tap, He looked up.
"Wych Street? Yus, of course I knoo Wych Street. Used to go there
with some of the boys when I was Covent Garden way. It was at right
angles to the Strand, just east of Wellington Street."</p>

<p>"No, it warn't. It were alongside the Strand, before yer come to
Wellington Street."</p>

<p>The coloured man took no part in the discussion, one street and
one city being alike to him, provided he could obtain the material
comforts dear to his heart; but the others carried it on with a
certain amount of acerbity.</p>

<p>Before any agreement had been arrived at three other men entered
the bar. The quick eye of Meadows recognised them at once as three
of what was known at that time as "The Gallows Ring." Every member
of "The Gallows Ring" had done time, but they still carried on a
lucrative industry devoted to blackmail, intimidation,
shop-lifting, and some of the clumsier recreations. Their leader,
Ben Orming, had served seven years for bashing a Chinaman down at
Rotherhithe.</p>

<p>"The Gallows Ring," was not popular in Wapping, for the reason
that many of their depredations had been inflicted upon their own
class. When Meadows and Harry Jones took it into their heads to do
a little wild prancing they took the trouble to go up into the West
End. They considered "The Gallows Ring" an ungentlemanly set;
nevertheless, they always treated them with a certain external
deference&mdash;an unpleasant crowd to quarrel with.</p>

<p>Ben Orming ordered beer for the three of them, and they leant
against the bar and whispered in sullen accents. Something had
evidently miscarried with the Ring. Mrs. Dawes continued to whine
above the general drone of the bar. Suddenly she said:</p>

<p>"Ben, you're a hot old devil, you are. We was just 'aving a
discussion like. Where was Wych Street?"</p>

<p>Ben scowled at her, and she continued:</p>

<p>"Some sez it was one place, some sez it was another. I
<i>know</i> where it was, 'cors my aunt what died from blood
p'ison, after eatin' tinned lobster, used to work at a corset
shop..."</p>

<p>"Yus," barked Ben, emphatically. "I know where Wych Street
was&mdash;it was just sarth of the river, afore yer come to
Waterloo Station."</p>

<p>It was then that the coloured man, who up to that point had
taken no part in the discussion, though fit to intervene.</p>

<p>"Nope. You's all wrong, cap'n. Wych Street were alongside de
church, way over where de Strand takes a side line up west."</p>

<p>Ben turned on him fiercely.</p>

<p>"What the blazes does a blanketty nigger know abaht it? I've
told yer where Wych Street was."</p>

<p>"Yus, and I know where it was," interposed Meadows. "Yer both
wrong. Wych Street was a turning running from Long Acre into
Wellington Street."</p>

<p>"I didn't ask yer what <i>you</i> thought," growled Ben.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I've a right to an opinion?"</p>

<p>"You always think you know everything, you do."</p>

<p>"You can just keep yer mouth shut."</p>

<p>"It 'ud take more'n you to shut it."</p>

<p>Mr. Booth thought it advisable at this juncture to bawl across
the bar.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen, no quarrelling&mdash;please."</p>

<p>The affair might have subsided at that point, but for Mrs.
Dawes. Her emotions over the death of the old lady in the street
had been so stirred that she had been, almost unconsciously,
drinking too much gin. She suddenly screamed out:</p>

<p>"Don't you take no lip from 'im, Mr. Medders. The dirty,
thieving devil, 'e always thinks 'e's goin' to come it over
everyone."</p>

<p>She stood up threateningly, and one of Ben's supporters gave her
a gentle push backward. In three minutes the bar was in a complete
state of pandemonium. The three members of "The Gallows Ring"
fought two men and a woman, for Mr. Dawes merely stood in a corner
and screamed out:</p>

<p>"Don't! Don't!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Dawes stabbed the man, who had pushed her, through the
wrist with a hatpin. Meadows and Ben Orming closed on each other
and fought savagely with the naked fists. A lucky blow early in the
encounter sent Meadows reeling against the wall, with blood
streaming down his temple. Then the coloured man hurled a pewter
tankard straight at Ben and it hit him on the knuckles. The pain
maddened him to a frenzy. His other supporter had immediately got
to grips with Harry Jones, and picked up one of the high stools
and, seizing an opportunity, brought it down crash on to the
coloured man's skull.</p>

<p>The whole affair was a matter of minutes. Mr. Booth was bawling
out in the street. A whistle sounded. People were running in all
directions.</p>

<p>"Beat it! Beat it, for God's sake!" called the man who had been
stabbed through the wrist. His face was very white, and he was
obviously about to faint.</p>

<p>Ben and the other man, whose name was Toller, dashed to the
door. On the pavement there was a confused scramble. Blows were
struck indiscriminately. Two policemen appeared. One was laid
<i>hors de combat</i> by a kick on the knee-cap from Toller. The
two men fled into the darkness, followed by a hue-and-cry. Born and
bred in the locality, they took every advantage of their knowledge.
They tacked through alleys and raced down dark mews, and clambered
over walls. Fortunately for them, the people they passed, who might
have tripped them up or aided in the pursuit, merely fled indoors.
The people in Wapping are not always on the side of the pursuer.
But the police held on. At last Ben and Toller slipped through the
door of a house in Aztec Street barely ten yards ahead of their
nearest pursuer. Blows rained on the door, but they slipped the
bolts, and then fell panting to the floor. When Ben could speak, he
said:</p>

<p>"If they cop us, it means swinging."</p>

<p>"Was the nigger done in?"</p>

<p>"I think so. But even if 'e wasn't, there was that other affair
the night before last. The game's up."</p>

<p>The ground floor rooms were shuttered and bolted, but they knew
that the police would probably force the front door. At the back
there was no escape, only a narrow stable yard, where lanterns were
already flashing. The roof only extended thirty yards either way,
and the police would probably take possession of it. They made a
round of the house, which was sketchily furnished. There was a
loaf, a small piece of mutton, and a bottle of pickles,
and&mdash;the most precious possession&mdash;three bottles of
whisky. Each man drank half a glass of neat whisky, then Ben said:
"We'll be able to keep 'em quiet for a bit, anyway," and he went
and fetched an old twelve-bore gun and a case of cartridges. Toller
was opposed to this last desperate resort, but Ben continued to
murmur: "It means swinging, anyway."</p>

<hr>

<p>And thus began the notorious siege of Aztec Street, It lasted
three days and four nights. You may remember that, on forcing a
panel of the front door Sub-Inspector Wraithe, of the V Division,
was shot through the chest. The police then tried other methods. A
hose was brought into play, without effect. Two policemen were
killed and four wounded. The military was requisitioned. The street
was picketed. Snipers occupied windows of the houses opposite. A
distinguished member of the Cabinet drove down in a motor-car, and
directed operations in a top-hat. It was the introduction of poison
gas which was the ultimate cause of the downfall of the citadel.
The body of Ben Orming was never found, but that of Toller was
discovered near the front door, with a bullet through his
heart.</p>

<p>The medical officer to the court pronounced that the man had
been dead three days, but whether killed by a chance bullet from a
sniper or whether killed deliberately by his fellow-criminal was
never revealed. For when the end came Orming had apparently planned
a final act of venom. It was known that in the basement a
considerable quantity of petrol had been stored. The contents had
probably been carefully distributed over the most inflammable
materials in the top rooms. The fire broke out, as one witness
described it, "almost like an explosion." Orming must have perished
in this. The roof blazed up, and the sparks carried across the yard
and started a stack of light timber in the annex of Messrs.
Morrel's piano factory. The factory and two blocks of tenement
buildings were burnt to the ground. The estimated cost of the
destruction was one hundred and eighty thousand pounds. The
casualties amounted to seven killed and fifteen wounded.</p>

<hr>

<p>At the inquiry held under Justice Pengammon, various odd,
interesting facts were revealed. Mr. Lowes-Parlby, the brilliant
young K.C., distinguished himself by his searching
cross-examination of many witnesses. At one point a certain Mrs.
Dawes was put in the box.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mr. Lowes-Parlby, "I understand that on the evening
in question, Mrs. Dawes, you, and the victims, and these other
people who have been mentioned, were all seated in the public bar
of the 'Wagtail,' enjoying its no doubt excellent hospitality and
indulging in a friendly discussion. Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Now, will you tell his lordship what you were discussing?"</p>

<p>"Diseases, sir."</p>

<p>"Diseases! And did the argument become acrimonious?"</p>

<p>"Pardon?"</p>

<p>"Was there a serious dispute about diseases?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, what was the subject of the dispute?"</p>

<p>"We was arguin' as to where Wych Street was, sir."</p>

<p>"What's that?" said his lordship.</p>

<p>"The witnesses states, my lord, that they were arguing as to
where Wych Street was."</p>

<p>"Wych Street? Do you mean W-Y-C-H?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You mean the narrow old street that used to run across the site
of what is now the Gaiety Theatre?"</p>

<p>Mr. Lowes-Parlby smiled in his most charming manner.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord, I believe the witness refers to the same street
you mention, though, if I may be allowed to qualify your lordship's
description of the locality, may I suggest that it was a little
farther east&mdash;at the side of the old Globe Theatre, which was
adjacent to St. Martin's in the Strand? That is the street you were
all arguing about, isn't it, Mrs. Dawes?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, my aunt, who died from eating tinned lobster, used
to work at a corset shop. I ought to know."</p>

<p>His lordship ignored the witness. He turned to the counsel
rather peevishly:</p>

<p>"Mr. Lowes-Parlby, when I was your age I used to pass through
Wych Street every day of my life. I did so for nearly twelve years.
I think it hardly necessary for you to contradict me."</p>

<p>The counsel bowed. It was not his place to dispute with a
justice, although that justice be a hopeless old fool; but another
eminent K.C., an elderly man with a tawny beard, rose in the body
of the court, and said:</p>

<p>"If I may be allowed to interpose, your lordship, I also spent a
great deal of my youth passing through Wych Street. I have gone
into the matter, comparing past and present ordnance survey maps.
If I am not mistaken, the street the witness was referring to began
near the hoarding at the entrance to Kingsway and ended at the back
of what is now the Aldwych Theatre."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Mr. Backer!" exclaimed Lowes-Parlby.</p>

<p>His lordship removed his glasses and snapped out:</p>

<p>"The matter is entirely irrelevant to the case."</p>

<p>It certainly was, but the brief passage-of-arms left an
unpleasant tang of bitterness behind. It was observed that Mr.
Lowes-Parlby never again quite got the prehensile grip upon his
cross-examination that he had shown in his treatment of the earlier
witnesses. The coloured man, Harry Jones, had died in hospital, but
Mr. Booth, the proprietor of the "Wagtail," Baldwin Meadows, Mr.
Dawes and the man who was stabbed in the wrist, all gave evidence
of a rather nugatory character. Lowes-Parlby could do nothing with
it. The findings of this special inquiry do not concern us. It is
sufficient to say that the witnesses already mentioned all returned
to Wapping. The man who had received the thrust of a hatpin through
his wrist did not think it advisable to take any action against
Mrs. Dawes. He was pleasantly relieved to find that he was only
required as a witness of an abortive discussion.</p>

<hr>

<p>In a few weeks' time the great Aztec Street siege remained only
a romantic memory to the majority of Londoners. To Lowes-Parlby the
little dispute with Justice Pengammon rankled unreasonably. It is
annoying to be publicly snubbed for making a statement which you
know to be absolutely true, and which you have even taken pains to
verify. And Lowes-Parlby was a young man accustomed to score. He
made a point of looking everything up, of being prepared for an
adversary thoroughly. He liked to give the appearance of knowing
everything. The brilliant career just ahead of him at times dazzled
him. He was one of the darlings of the gods. Everything came to
Lowes-Parlby. His father had distinguished himself at the Bar
before him, and had amassed a modest fortune. He was an only son.
At Oxford he had carried off every possible degree. He was already
being spoken of for very high political honours.</p>

<p>But the most sparkling jewel in the crown of his successes was
Lady Adela Charters, the daughter of Lord Vermeer, the Minister for
Foreign Affairs. She was his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>, and it was
considered the most brilliant match of the season. She was young
and almost pretty, and Lord Vermeer was immensely wealthy and one
of the most influential men in Great Britain. Such a combination
was irresistible. There seemed to be nothing missing in the life of
Francis Lowes-Parlby, K.C.</p>

<hr>

<p>One of the most regular and absorbed spectators at the Aztec
Street inquiry was old Stephen Garrit. Stephen Garrit held a unique
but quite inconspicuous position in the legal world at that time.
He was a friend of judges, a specialist at various abstruse legal
rulings, a man of remarkable memory, and yet&mdash;an amateur. He
had never taken silk, never eaten the requisite dinners, never
passed an examination in his life; but the law of evidence was meat
and drink to him. He passed his life in the Temple, where he had
chambers. Some of the most eminent counsel in the world would take
his opinion, or come to him for advice. He was very old, very
silent and very absorbed. He attended every meeting of the Aztec
Street inquiry, but from beginning to end he never volunteered an
opinion.</p>

<p>After the inquiry was over, he went and visited an old friend at
the London Survey Office. He spent two mornings examining maps.
After that he spent two mornings pottering about the Strand,
Kingsway and Aldwych; then he worked out some careful calculations
on a ruled chart. He entered the particulars in a little book which
he kept for purposes of that kind, and then retired to his chamber
to study other matters. But, before doing so, he entered a little
apophthegm in another book. It was apparently a book in which he
intended to compile a summary of his legal experiences. The
sentence ran:</p>

<p>"The basic trouble is that people make statements without
sufficient data."</p>

<p>Old Stephen need not have appeared in this story at all, except
for the fact that he was present at the dinner at Lord Vermeer's,
where a rather deplorable incident occurred. And you must
acknowledge that in the circumstances it is useful to have such a
valuable and efficient witness.</p>

<p>Lord Vermeer was a competent, forceful man, a little
quick-tempered and autocratic. He came from Lancashire, and before
entering politics had made an enormous fortune out of borax,
artificial manure, and starch.</p>

<p>It was a small dinner-party, with a motive behind it. His
principal guest was Mr. Sandeman, the London agent of the Ameer of
Bakkan. Lord Vermeer was very anxious to impress Mr. Sandeman and
to be very friendly with him: the reasons will appear later. Mr.
Sandeman was a self-confessed cosmopolitan. He spoke seven
languages and professed to be equally at home in any capital in
Europe. London had been his headquarters for over twenty years.
Lord Vermeer also invited Mr. Arthur Toombs, a colleague in the
Cabinet, his prospective son-in-law, Lowes-Parlby, K.C., James
Trolley, a very tame Socialist M.P., and Sir Henry and Lady Breyd,
the two latter being invited, not because Sir Henry was of any use,
but because Lady Breyd was a pretty and brilliant woman who might
amuse his principal guest. The sixth guest was Stephen Garrit.</p>

<p>The dinner was a great success. When the succession of courses
eventually came to a stop, and the ladies had retired, Lord Vermeer
conducted his male guests into another room for a ten minutes'
smoke before rejoining them. It was then that the unfortunate
incident occurred. There was no love lost between Lowes-Parlby and
Mr. Sandeman. It is difficult to ascribe the real reason of their
mutual animosity, but on the several occasions when they had met
there had invariably passed a certain sardonic by-play. They were
both clever, both comparatively young, each a little suspect and
jealous of the other; moreover, it was said in some quarters that
Mr. Sandeman had had intentions himself with regard to Lord
Vermeer's daughter, that he had been on the point of a proposal
when Lowes-Parlby had butted in and forestalled him.</p>

<p>Mr. Sandeman had dined well, and he was in the mood to dazzle
with a display of his varied knowledge and experiences. The
conversation drifted from a discussion of the rival claims of great
cities to the slow, inevitable removal of old landmarks. There had
been a slightly acrimonious disagreement between Lowes-Parlby and
Mr. Sandeman as to the claims of Budapest and Lisbon, and Mr.
Sandeman had scored because he extracted from his rival a
confession that, though he had spent two months in Budapest, he had
only spent two days in Lisbon. Mr. Sandeman had lived for four
years in either city. Lowes-Parlby changed the subject
abruptly.</p>

<p>"Talking of landmarks," he said, "we had a queer point arise in
that Aztec Street Inquiry. The original dispute arose owing to a
discussion between a crowd of people in a pub, as to where Wych
Street was."</p>

<p>"I remember," said Lord Vermeer. "A perfectly absurd discussion.
Why, I should have thought that any man over forty would remember
exactly where it was."</p>

<p>"Where would you say it was, sir?" asked Lowes-Parlby.</p>

<p>"Why, to be sure, it ran from the corner of Chancery Lane and
ended at the second turning after the Law Courts, going west."</p>

<p>Lowes-Parlby was about to reply, when Mr. Sandeman cleared his
throat and said, in his supercilious, oily voice:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, my lord. I know my Paris, and Vienna, and Lisbon,
every brick and stone, but I look upon London as my home. I know my
London even better. I have a perfectly clear recollection of Wych
Street. When I was a student I used to visit there to buy books. It
ran parallel to New Oxford Street on the south side, just between
it and Lincoln's Inn Fields."</p>

<p>There was something about this assertion that infuriated
Lowes-Parlby. In the first place, it was so hopelessly wrong and so
insufferably asserted. In the second place, he was already smarting
under the indignity of being shown up about Lisbon. And then there
suddenly flashed through his mind the wretched incident when he had
been publicly snubbed by Justice Pengammon about the very same
point; and he knew that he was right each time. Damn Wych Street!
He turned on Mr. Sandeman.</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense! You may know something about these&mdash;eastern
cities; you certainly know nothing about London if you make a
statement like that. Wych Street was a little farther east of what
is now the Gaiety Theatre. It used to run by the side of the old
Globe Theatre, parallel to the Strand."</p>

<p>The dark moustache of Mr. Sandeman shot upward, revealing a
narrow line of yellow teeth. He uttered a sound that was a mingling
of contempt and derision; then he drawled out:</p>

<p>"Really? How wonderful&mdash;to have such comprehensive
knowledge!"</p>

<p>He laughed, and his small eyes fixed his rival. Lowes-Parlby
flushed a deep red. He gulped down half a glass of port and
muttered just above a whisper: "Damned impudence!" Then, in the
rudest manner he could display, he turned his back deliberately on
Sandeman and walked out of the room.</p>

<hr>

<p>In the company of Adela he tried to forget the little
contretemps. The whole thing was so absurd&mdash;so utterly
undignified. As though <i>he</i> didn't know! It was the little
accumulation of pinpricks all arising out of that one argument. The
result had suddenly goaded him to&mdash;well, being rude, to say
the least of it. It wasn't that Sandeman mattered. To the devil
with Sandeman! But what would his future father-in-law think? He
had never before given way to any show of ill-temper before him. He
forced himself into a mood of rather fatuous jocularity. Adela was
at her best in those moods. They would have lots of fun together in
the days to come. Her almost pretty, not too clever, face was
dimpled with kittenish glee. Life was a tremendous rag to her. They
were expecting Toccata, the famous opera singer. She had been
engaged at a very high fee to come on from Covent Garden. Mr.
Sandeman was very fond of music.</p>

<p>Adela was laughing and discussing which was the most honourable
position for the great Sandeman to occupy. There came to
Lowes-Parlby a sudden abrupt misgiving. What sort of wife would
this be to him when they were not just fooling? He immediately
dismissed the curious, furtive little stab of doubt. The splendid
proportions of the room calmed his senses. A huge bowl of dark red
roses quickened his perceptions. His career...The door opened. But
it was not La Toccata. It was one of the household flunkies.
Lowes-Parlby turned again to his inamorata.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir. His lordship says will you kindly go and see
him in the library?"</p>

<p>Lowes-Parlby regarded the messenger, and his heart beat quickly.
An incontrollable presage of evil racked his nerve centres.
Something had gone wrong; and yet the whole thing was so absurd,
trivial. In a crisis&mdash;well, he could always apologise. He
smiled confidently at Adela, and said:</p>

<p>"Why, of course; with pleasure. Please excuse me, dear."</p>

<p>He followed the impressive servant out of the room. His foot had
barely touched the carpet of the library when he realised that his
worst apprehensions were to be plumbed to the depths. For a moment
he thought Lord Vermeer was alone, then he observed old Stephen
Garrit, lying in an easy chair in the corner like a piece of
crumpled parchment. Lord Vermeer did not beat about the bush. When
the door was closed, he bawled out, savagely:</p>

<p>"What the devil have you done?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir. I'm afraid I don't understand. Is it
Sandeman...?"</p>

<p>"Sandeman has gone."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Sorry! By God, I should think you might be sorry! You insulted
him. My prospective son-in-law insulted him in my own house!"</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry. I didn't realise..."</p>

<p>"Realise! Sit down, and don't assume for one moment that you
continue to be my prospective son-in-law. Your insult was a most
intolerable piece of effrontery, not only to him, but to me."</p>

<p>"But I..."</p>

<p>"Listen to me. Do you know that the Government were on the verge
of concluding a most far-reaching treaty with that man? Do you know
that the position was just touch-and-go? The concessions we were
prepared to make would have cost the State thirty million pounds,
and it would have been cheap. Do you hear that? It would have been
cheap! Bakkan is one of the most vulnerable outposts of the Empire.
It is a terrible danger zone. If certain Powers can usurp our
authority&mdash;and, mark you, the whole blamed place is already
riddled with this new pernicious doctrine&mdash;you know what I
mean&mdash;before we know where we are the whole East will be in a
blaze. India! My God! This contract we were negotiating would have
countered this outward thrust. And you, you blockhead, you come
here and insult the man upon whose word the whole thing
depends."</p>

<p>"I really can't see, sir, how I should know all this."</p>

<p>"You can't see it! But, you fool, you seemed to go out of your
way. You insulted him about the merest quibble&mdash;in my
house!"</p>

<p>"He said he knew where Wych Street was. He was quite wrong. I
corrected him."</p>

<p>"Wych Street! Wych Street be damned! If he said Wych Street was
in the moon, you should have agreed with him. There was no call to
act in the way you did. And you&mdash;you think of going into
politics!"</p>

<p>The somewhat cynical inference of this remark went unnoticed.
Lowes-Parlby was too unnerved. He mumbled:</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry."</p>

<p>"I don't want your sorrow. I want something more practical."</p>

<p>"What's that, sir?"</p>

<p>"You will drive straight to Mr. Sandeman, find him, and
apologise. Tell him you find that he was right about Wych Street
after all. If you can't find him to-night, you must find him
to-morrow morning. I give you till midday to-morrow. If by that
time you have not offered a handsome apology to Mr. Sandeman, you
do not enter this house again, you do not see my daughter again.
Moreover, all the power I possess will be devoted to hounding you
out of that profession you have dishonoured. Now you can go."</p>

<p>Dazed and shaken, Lowes-Parlby drove back to his flat at
Knightsbridge. Before acting he must have time to think. Lord
Vermeer had given him till to-morrow midday. Any apologising that
was done should be done after a night's reflection. The fundamental
purposes of his being were to be tested. He knew that. He was at a
great crossing. Some deep instinct within him was grossly outraged.
Is it that a point comes when success demands that a man shall sell
his soul? It was all so absurdly trivial&mdash;a mere argument
about the position of a street that had ceased to exist. As Lord
Vermeer said, what did it matter about Wych Street?</p>

<p>Of course he should apologise. It would hurt horribly to do so,
but would a man sacrifice everything on account of some fooling
argument about a street?</p>

<p>In his own rooms, Lowes-Parlby put on a dressing-gown, and,
lighting a pipe, he sat before the fire. He would have given
anything for companionship at such a moment&mdash;the right
companionship. How lovely it would be to have&mdash;a woman, just
the right woman, to talk this all over with; someone who understood
and sympathised. A sudden vision came to him of Adela's face
grinning about the prospective visit of La Toccata, and again the
low voice of misgiving whispered in his ears. Would Adela
be&mdash;just the right woman? In very truth, did he really love
Adela? Or was it all&mdash;a rag? Was life a rag&mdash;a game
played by lawyers, politicians, and people?</p>

<p>The fire burned low, but still he continued to sit thinking, his
mind principally occupied with the dazzling visions of the future.
It was past midnight when he suddenly muttered a low "Damn!" and
walked to the bureau. He took up a pen and wrote:</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Mr. Sandeman<br>
,<br>
"I must apologise for acting so rudely to you last night. It was
quite unpardonable of me, especially as I since find, on going into
the matter, that you were quite right about the position of Wych
Street. I can't think how I made the mistake. Please forgive
me.<br>
<br>
Yours cordially,<br>
Francis Lowes-Parlby."</p>

<p>Having written this, he sighed and went to bed. One might have
imagined at that point that the matter was finished. But there are
certain little greedy demons of conscience that require a lot of
stilling, and they kept Lowes-Parlby awake more than half the
night. He kept on repeating to himself, "It's all positively
absurd!" But the little greedy demons pranced around the bed, and
they began to group things into two definite issues. On the one
side, the great appearances; on the other, something at the back of
it all, something deep, fundamental, something that could only be
expressed by one word&mdash;truth. If he had <i>really</i> loved
Adela&mdash;if he weren't so absolutely certain that Sandeman was
wrong and he was right&mdash;why should he have to say that Wych
Street was where it wasn't?</p>

<p>"Isn't there, after all," said one of the little demons,
"something which makes for greater happiness than success? Confess
this, and we'll let you sleep."</p>

<p>Perhaps that is one of the most potent weapons the little demons
possess. However full our lives may be, we ever long for moments of
tranquillity. And conscience holds before our eyes the mirror of an
ultimate tranquillity. Lowes-Parlby was certainly not himself. The
gay, debonair, and brilliant egoist was tortured, and tortured
almost beyond control; and it had all apparently arisen through the
ridiculous discussion about a street. At a quarter past three in
the morning he arose from his bed with a groan, and, going into the
other room, he tore the letter to Mr. Sandeman to pieces.</p>

<hr>

<p>Three weeks later old Stephen Garrit was lunching with the Lord
Chief Justice. They were old friends, and they never found it
incumbent to be very conversational. The lunch was an excellent but
frugal meal. They both ate slowly and thoughtfully, and their drink
was water. It was not till they reached the dessert stage that his
lordship indulged in any very informative comment, and then he
recounted to Stephen the details of a recent case in which he
considered that the presiding judge, by an unprecedented paralogy,
misinterpreted the Law of Evidence. Stephen listened with absorbed
attention. He took two cob-nuts from the silver dish, and turned
them over meditatively, without cracking them. When his lordship
had completely stated his opinion and peeled a pear, Stephen
mumbled:</p>

<p>"I have been impressed, very impressed indeed. Even in my own
field of&mdash;limited observation&mdash;the opinion of an
outsider, you may say&mdash;so often it happens&mdash;the trouble
caused by an affirmation without sufficiently established data. I
have seen lives lost, ruin brought about, endless suffering. Only
last week, a young man&mdash;a brilliant career&mdash;almost
shattered. People make statements without&mdash;"</p>

<p>He put the nuts back on the dish and then, in an apparently
irrelevant manner, he said abruptly:</p>

<p>"Do you remember Wych Street, my lord?"</p>

<p>The Lord Chief Justice grunted.</p>

<p>"Wych Street! Of course I do."</p>

<p>"Where would you say it was, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Why, here, of course."</p>

<p>His lordship took a pencil from his pocket and sketched a plan
on the tablecloth.</p>

<p>"It used to run from there to here."</p>

<p>Stephen adjusted his glasses and carefully examined the plan. He
took a long time to do this, and when he had finished his hand
instinctively went toward a breast pocket where he kept a notebook
with little squared pages. Then he stopped and sighed. After all,
why argue with the law? The law was like that&mdash;an excellent
thing, not infallible, of course (even the plan of the Lord Chief
Justice was a quarter of a mile out), but still an excellent, a
wonderful thing. He examined the bony knuckles of his hands and
yawned slightly.</p>

<p>"Do you remember it?" said the Lord Chief Justice.</p>

<p>Stephen nodded sagely, and his voice seemed to come from a long
way off:</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember it, my lord. It was a melancholy little
street."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch02" id="ch02"></a>2. ONE SUNDAY MORNING</h2>

<p>The iron fingers of habit probed his consciousness into the
realisation that it was seven-thirty, the hour to rise. He sighed
as he pushed his way to the surface through the pleasant obscurity
of tangled dreams. And then, oh, joy! his conscious brain
registered the abrupt reflection that it was Sunday. Oh, happy
thought. Oh, glorious and soporific reflection! He sunk back again,
like a deep sea monster plunging into the dark waters of its
natural environment. There passed a long untroubled passage of
time, in which his subconscious mind dallied with ecstatic
emotions. Then slowly and reluctantly he blinked once more into the
light of day and knowingness. This re-entry was accompanied by the
pleasant sound of running water. His wife was in the bathroom,
already getting up. Her activity and the sound of her ablutions
added a piquance to the luxury of his own state. Oh, Sunday,
glorious and inactive day!</p>

<p>His mind became busy with the anticipations of his own
inactivity.</p>

<p>Breakfast in bed! When he won the Calcutta Sweepstake he would
always have breakfast in bed. There was something irresistibly
luxurious about sitting up snugly in the warmed bed, eating toast
and bacon and drinking hot tea that someone else, pottering about
in the cold, had had to prepare. And when one had had breakfast one
was a man, fortified for anything, even to the extent of getting
up.</p>

<p>His wife came back into the bedroom, wearing&mdash;oh, those
funny things that women wear underneath deceptive frocks. He had
been married for sixteen years and the vision of his wife in these
habiliments did not produce in him any great manifestation of
interest. He realised that he wanted his tea, and his interests
were more nearly concerned with the estimate of how long it would
take her to finish dressing and go downstairs and make it. And
after breakfast&mdash;oh, that first cigarette and the indolent
stimulus of reading the Sunday newspaper from cover to cover. His
wife was chatting away about the cook-general, who was ill, and he
boomed out a lethargic yes or no according to the decision which he
believed that she expected. Oh, luxurious and delicious
indifference!</p>

<p>She bustled away at last, and he listened entranced to the
distant sound of rattling plates and teacups. A pity that Jenny had
to get the breakfast herself, but there! she didn't have to go to
the city every day in the week, and besides&mdash;it was the
woman's sphere. His conscience was serene and satisfied, his senses
aroused almost to exultation by the sudden and insidious smell of
frying bacon.</p>

<p>When she brought the tray he roused himself valiantly to say the
gracious thing, for he realised that the situation was a little
dangerous. His wife was not in too good a temper over this affair
of the fool of a cook. If he was not careful, she would want him to
do something, chop wood or bring up coals, some angular and
disturbing abrasion upon the placidity of his natural rights.
However, she left the breakfast tray without any such disquieting
threats.</p>

<p>He stared at the tray, when she had gone, as a cat may look at a
mouse which she has cornered, realising that the great charm of the
situation lies in the fact that there is no hurry. At last he
poured himself out a large cup of tea, and drunk it in gulps. He
then got busy on the bacon and the toast. He ate up all the bacon
carefully and thoughtfully, cleaning up the liquid fat with a piece
of bread. He began to feel good. He drank more tea, and ate slice
after slice of buttered toast, piled up with marmalade. At last he
sank back on the pillow replete. Then he reached out and took his
cigarette-case out of his coat pocket. He lighted a cigarette and
opened the Sunday newspaper. Then indeed did he reach the
culmination of all his satisfactions. Strange how much more
interesting and readable a Sunday newspaper is than a daily paper.
A daily paper is all rush and headlines, designed entirely for the
strap-hanger. The Sunday paper was conceived in the interest of
breakfasters in bed. It is all slow-going and familiar. You know
just where to look for everything, and you almost know what will be
printed there. He first of all read carefully the results of all
the previous day's football. Queer that he should do so, for he had
not played football for twenty-five years, and then very
indifferently. But he had sneaking affections for certain clubs and
he looked eagerly to see how they were faring. Then he read the
General news. Everything seemed interesting; even political
speeches were not too dull, but divorce and criminal cases were
thrilling. He took no interest in literature, drama or music, but
sayings of the week, police court news, foreign intelligence, even
Court chat, absorbed him. He read the advertisements and then the
football news again, knocking the ash off his cigarette into the
teacup. Sometimes his arms would get cold holding the paper, and he
would put it down and tuck them under him. He would stare around
the room, and glow with proprietorial delight. Then he would pick
up the paper and start all over again. His splendid reveries were
eventually disturbed by the voice of his wife calling from
below:</p>

<p>"Jim, are you going to get up to-day or to-morrow?"</p>

<p>Dear, oh dear! Disturbing and alarming creatures, women. No
sense of repose, no appreciation of real tranquillity. However, it
must be getting late, and the morning constitutional to give one an
appetite for lunch must not be disregarded. He devoted another ten
minutes to an inert contemplation of the function of rising and
dressing, and then rolled out of bed. He went into the bathroom,
and lighted the geyser for his weekly bath. When the water was hot
enough he drew off some for shaving, and returned to the bedroom
for his new packet of safety razors. He caught sight of himself in
the long mirror which his wife used. The reflection was so familiar
that it produced in him no emotion whatever. He felt no misgiving
about the puffy modelling of the face, the dishevelled strands of
disappearing hair, the taut line made by the cord of his
dressing-gown where it met around his middle. He was just himself,
getting up. Besides, no man looks his best first thing in the
morning.</p>

<p>When he returned to the bathroom he was in gay spirits. During
the operation of shaving he made curious volcanic noises meant to
represent the sound of singing. Running water always affected him
like that. The only disquieting element in this joyous affair was
the fact that steam from the bath kept on clouding the mirror. He
kept on rubbing it with a towel, shaving a little bit, then rubbing
again, to the accompaniment of many damns and confounds. When that
was over he pondered for some moments on the question of whether he
should clean his teeth first, or have his bath. As the room was
beginning to get full of steam, he decided on the latter course. He
got in and let himself down slowly, for the water was very hot, and
though his legs could stand it, other portions of his anatomy were
more sensitive. He let in some cold water and settled down with a
plomp. He soaped himself, and rubbed himself, and lay on his back,
splashing gently. Glorious and delightful sensation. If he had time
he would like to have a hot bath every day, but how could you
expect a fellow to when he had to be in the city every day at
nine-thirty? He got out of the bath, hot and pink and shiny. He
dried himself, and cleaned his teeth. There! all the serious side
of getting up was accomplished. During the performance of dressing
he smoked another cigarette. He dressed very slowly, and
deliberately, putting on a clean shirt, vest, socks and collar.
Golly! he felt good. He puffed out his chest, opened the window,
and brushed his hair. He was rather pleased with his general
appearance of respectability.</p>

<p>Now came the dangerous moment. He had to go downstairs. Would he
be able to escape without being ordered to perform some unpleasant
task by his wife? He went down, humming soulfully. In the
sitting-room the fire was burning brightly, but Jennie was not
there. He could hear her bustling about in the kitchen, already
preparing the solemn rites affecting the Sunday joint...no
insignificant ritual. He wandered about the room, touching things,
admiring their arrangement. He picked up two letters, which had
come by the last post the previous night, and read them again. One
was from his wife's sister at Ramsgate, full of details about the
illness of her husband. The other was from a gentleman offering to
lend him any sum of money from &pound;5 to &pound;10,000 on note of
hand alone, without security. He tried to visualise &pound;10,000,
what he could do with it, the places he could visit, the house he
could rent on the top of Hampstead Heath, a few dinners at the
Savoy perhaps, a month in Paris (he had never been abroad). Then he
tore the letter up and went into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;anything I can do, my dear?"</p>

<p>"No, except to get out of the way."</p>

<p>She was obviously on edge. Women were like that, especially
first thing in the morning...curious creatures. He picked his teeth
with a broken match, which happened to be conveniently in a
waistcoat pocket. Anyway, he had done his duty. He had faced the
music.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll just go for a stroll round," he murmured
ingratiatingly. He had escaped! A pallid sun was trying to
penetrate a nebulous bank of clouds. The air was fresh and
stimulating. A muffin man came along, ringing his bell. He passed
two anaemic women carrying prayer books. At the corner of the road
was a man with a impromptu kiosk of newspapers. He hesitated as to
whether he should buy another newspaper. His wife wouldn't approve.
She would say it was extravagant. Well, he could read on a seat on
the top of the heath, and leave it there. But still&mdash;he
resisted the temptation and walked on. The streets had their
definitely Sunday look. You could tell it was Sunday in a
glance...milk, prayer books, newspapers, muffins, wonderful! Dear
England! A crowd of hatless young men on bicycles came racing along
the Finchley Road, swarms of them, like gnats, and in the middle a
woman riding behind a man on a tandem. They were all laughing and
shouting with rather common voices...enjoying themselves though,
off to the country for the day.</p>

<p>"The woman looks like the queen gnat," he reflected. "They are
pursuing her. The race to the swift, the battle to the strong." He
was pleased with the luminance of this reflection. A boy asked him
for a cigarette picture. He shook his head and passed on. Then he
wondered whether...well, he had several in his pocket, but somehow
he felt it would look silly to be giving cigarette pictures to a
boy in the street. He didn't like that kind of thing. It made him
conspicuous. Passers-by might look at him and say: "Look at that
fat man giving a boy cigarette pictures." And they might laugh. It
was all very curious, foolish perhaps, but there it was.</p>

<p>He knew he was going to walk up to the top of the heath, and
along the Spaniards' Road, but he never liked to make up his mind
to. He walked there by instalments, sometimes almost deciding to
turn back, but he invariably got there in the end. Besides, what
else could he do? Dinner was not till half-past one. He couldn't go
home, and there was nowhere to sit down. Going up the hill he was
conscious of the disturbance of his pulmonary organs...heart not
too good, either, you know. The day would come when this would be
too much for him. He enjoyed it when he got there. Oh, yes, this
was a joyous place...heartening. He liked the noise, and bustle,
and sense of space and light. Nearly every Sunday for twenty years
he had walked up here. It was where the Cockney came to peep out of
London, and regard the great world, the unexplored vista of his
possessions. He was a little shy of it. He didn't look at the view
much, but he liked to feel it was there. He preferred to watch boys
sailing miniature yachts on the round pond, or to listen to a
Socialist lecturer being good-humouredly heckled by a crowd. Every
Sunday he had pondered an identical problem&mdash;why these public
lecturers always choose the very noisiest spot on the whole heath,
near the pond, amidst the yelping of dogs, the tooting of motor
horns, the back-firing of motor bikes, and the din of a Salvation
Army band. But there it was! This was England, perhaps the most
English thing in all England. There were the young men in plus
fours, without hats, old men with their dogs, red-cheeked women
riding astride brown mares...cars, bicycles, horses, dogs, even
yachts! There were the fat policemen in couples, talking lazily,
their mission being apparently to see that the fiery gentleman by
the pond was allowed free speech...There were boys with kites, and
boys with scooters, boys with nursemaids. Oh, a man's place this.
Many more men than women. Did not the predominance signify
something vital, something pertinent to the core of English
life&mdash;the Sunday joint? It was only the women with cooks who
were allowed to adorn this gay company. And even then&mdash;could a
cook be trusted? Wasn't the wife's or mother's true place basting
the sirloin, or regulating the gas-stove so that the roast shoulder
should be done to a turn?</p>

<p>These reflections caused him to focus his attention upon the
personal equation. What was to be the Sunday joint to-day? He was
already beginning to feel those first delightful pangs of hunger,
the just reward of exercise in fresh air. The Sunday joint? Why,
yes, of course, he had heard Jenny say that she had ordered a loin
of pork. Pork! delicious and seductive word. He licked his lips,
and visualised the set board. It was not entirely a misfortune that
the cook was ill, for Jenny was a much better cook. The pork would
be done to a turn, with its beautiful brown encasement of
crackling. There would be applesauce, Brussels sprouts, and
probably lovely brown potatoes. He would carve. It was only right
of course that the master of the house&mdash;the
breadwinner&mdash;should control this ceremonial. There were little
snippy brown bits&mdash;and that little bit of kidney
underneath&mdash;that&mdash;well, one didn't give to a servant for
instance.</p>

<p>He passed the orator once more, and overhead this remark:</p>

<p>"The day is coming when these blood-suckers will be forced to
disgorge. They will be made to stew in their own juice. Look at
Russia!"</p>

<p>Nobody appeared to be looking at Russia. With their pipes in the
corner of their mouths they were looking stolidly at the speaker,
or at the boys and their yachts. Dogs were barking furiously, and
motor horns drowned any further declamation till he was out of
hearing. The two fat policemen were talking about horse-racing. Oh,
wonderful and imperishable country!</p>

<p>He had heard men talk in that strain before&mdash;but only in
the city or in stuffy tea-shops. They spoke with fear in their
hearts. Something was always going to happen. They didn't quite
know what, but it was always something awful, and the country was
just on the eve of it. But up here, amidst these dogs and bikes and
horses you knew that nothing could ever happen to England.
Everybody just went on doing things, making the best of things. The
air was sweet and good. There was the Sunday joint in the offing,
and the Cup Final next Sunday to be discussed.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch and proceeded to walk slowly homewards.
It cannot be said that he thought about anything very definite on
the way back, but his mind was pleasantly attacked by fragmentary
thoughts, half-fledged ambitions to make more money, anticipations
of a masonic dinner the following week, the dim vision of an old
romance with a girl in a tobacconist shop at Barnes. But at the
back of his mind there loomed the solid assurance of the one thing
that mattered&mdash;pork! He played with the vision, not openly but
secretly. After the pork there would be pudding. He didn't care
much about pudding, but there was a very good old gorgonzola to
follow, and than a glass of port. After dinner a cigar, and then
the Sunday newspaper again until he fell into that delightful doze
in front of the fire. Oh, blessed day!</p>

<p>His timing was superb. He arrived at "The Dog and Dolphin" at
exactly one o'clock, in accordance with a time-honoured
tradition&mdash;the gin and bitters to put the edge on one's
appetite for dinner. The bar was filled with the usual Sunday
morning crowd, some who had risen just in time for the bar to open,
other stalwarts like himself, who had earned their appetiser
through walking.</p>

<p>He was just ordering a gin and bitters when a voice said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, old boy, have this with me."</p>

<p>He turned and beheld Beeswax, a fellow city man. They had known
each other for fifteen years, meeting nearly every day, but neither
had ever visited the other's house. He said:</p>

<p>"No, go on, you have it with me."</p>

<p>They went through the usual formula of arguing who should pay
for the first drink, both knowing quite well that the other would
inevitably have to stand another drink in return. They stood each
other two drinks, making four in all. In the meantime they
discussed old so-and-so and old thingummy, trade, dogs, tobacco and
females. Then he looked at his watch again. Just five-and-twenty
past&mdash;perfect!</p>

<p>"Well, old boy, I must be off or I shall get into trouble with
the missus."</p>

<p>He walked quite briskly up the street, feeling good. Life wasn't
such a bad business to a normal man, if he&mdash;looked after
himself, and on the bright side of things. Pork, eh?</p>

<p>He knocked his pipe out against the parapet in the front garden,
walked up the steps, and let himself in. He hung up his coat and
hat, and was about to enter the sitting-room, when he became
abruptly sensitive to disaster. It began in the realisation that
there was no smell of roasting pork, no smell of anything cooking.
He felt angry. Fate was going to cheat him in some way or other. He
did not have long to wait. His wife came screaming down the stairs,
her face deadly white, her hair awry.</p>

<p>"Jim! Jim!" she shouted, "rush to the corner quick. Fetch a
policeman!"</p>

<p>"What?" he said.</p>

<p>"Fetch a policeman!"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Moyna. She's dead. I went upstairs an hour ago and found her
lying fully dressed on the floor. The gas-stove was turned on. She
looked awful, but she wasn't quite dead. I dragged her into our
room, and fetched a doctor. He did what he could, but she died.
She's lying dead on our bed. The doctor's up there now."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't argue. Fetch a policeman. The doctor says we must."</p>

<p>He fumbled his way out into the hall, and put on his hat and
coat again. He knew it was no good arguing with his wife when she
was like that. Damn! How wretched and disturbing
and&mdash;inconvenient. He walked slowly up the street. What a
disgusting and unpleasant job&mdash;fetching a
policeman&mdash;beastly! He found a ripe specimen at the corner,
staring at nothing. He explained the situation apologetically to
the officer. The latter turned the matter over in his mind and made
a noise that sounded like: "Huh-huh."</p>

<p>Then the two strolled back to the house at the law's pace, and
talked about the weather. He found his wife in the sitting-room,
sobbing and carrying on, and the doctor was there too, and another
woman from next door.</p>

<p>"I believe these women rather enjoy this kind of thing," he
reflected, the fires of hunger and anger burning within him. They
all went upstairs and left him to ruminate. What a confounded and
disgusting nuisance! Anyway, what did Jenny want to carry on like
that for about a servant. Who was she? She hadn't been there long,
about two weeks. She was an Irish girl, not bad-looking in that
dark way. He seemed to remember that Jenny said she was married or
something. Some man had been cruel to her, cruel and callous, she
had said. She used to cry. Confound it! Why was it so difficult to
get a good servant? But there it was. Jenny would carry on and be
hysterical all the afternoon. There would be no dinner. Perhaps a
snack of cheese or something on the quiet. Women were absurd,
impossible. You couldn't cope with them. They had no reasoning
power, no logic, no sense of fatality, no repose. It was enough to
make one boil...pork, too!</p>

<h2><a name="ch03" id="ch03"></a>3. THE GREAT UNIMPRESSIONABLE</h2>

<p>Ned Picklekin was a stolid chunk of a young man, fair,
blue-eyed, with his skin beaten to a uniform tint of warm red by
the sun and wind. For he was the postman at the village at
Ashalton. Except for two hours in the little sorting-office, he
spent the whole day on his bicycle, invariably accompanied by his
Irish terrier, Toffee. Toffee was as well-known on the countryside
as Ned himself. He took the business of delivering letters as
seriously as his master. He trotted behind the bicycle with his
tongue out, and waited panting outside the gates of gardens while
the important government business was transacted. He never barked,
and had no time for fighting common, unofficial dogs. When the
letters were delivered, his master would return to his bicycle, and
say: "Coom ahn, boy!" and Toffee would immediately jump up, and
fall into line. They were great companions.</p>

<p>Ned lived with his mother, and also he walked out with a young
lady. Her name was Ettie Skinner, and she was one of the three
daughters of old Charlie Skinner, the corn-merchant. Charlie
Skinner had a little establishment in the station-yard. He was a
widower, and he and his three daughters lived in a cottage in
Neap's Lane. It was very seldom necessary to deliver letters at the
Skinners' cottage, but every morning Ned had to pass up Neap's
Lane, and so, when he arrived at the cottage, he dismounted, and
rang his bicycle bell. The signal was understood by Ettie, who
immediately ran out to the gate, and a conversation somewhat on
this pattern usually took place:</p>

<p>"Hulloa!"</p>

<p>"Hulloa!"</p>

<p>"All right?"</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>"Busy?"</p>

<p>"Ay. Mendin' some old cla'es."</p>

<p>"Oo-ay!"</p>

<p>"Looks like mebbe a shower."</p>

<p>"Mebbe."</p>

<p>"Comin' along to-night?"</p>

<p>"Ay, if it doan't rain."</p>

<p>"Well, so long!"</p>

<p>"So long, Ned."</p>

<p>In the evenings the conversation followed a very similar course.
They waddled along the lanes side by side, and occasionally gave
each other a punch. Ned smoked his pipe all the time, and Toffee
was an unembarrassed cicerone. He was a little jealous of this
unnecessary female, but he behaved with a resigned acquiescence.
His master could do no wrong. His master was a god, a being apart
from all others.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that Ned was a romantic lover. He was solemn,
direct, imperturbable. He was a Saxon of Saxons, matter-of-fact,
incorruptible, unimaginative, strong-willed, conscientious, not
very ambitious, and suspicious of the unusual and the unknown. When
the war broke out, he said:</p>

<p>"Ay, but this is a bad business!"</p>

<p>And then he thought about it for a month. At the end of that
time he made up his mind to join. He rode up Neap's Lane one
morning and rang his bell. When Ettie appeared the usual
conversation underwent a slight variant:</p>

<p>"Hulloa!"</p>

<p>"Hulloa!"</p>

<p>"All right?"</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>"Doin' much?"</p>

<p>"Oo&mdash;mendin' pa's nightgown."</p>

<p>"Oh! I be goin' to jine up."</p>

<p>"Oo-oh! Be 'ee?"</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>"When be goin'?"</p>

<p>"Monday with Dick Thursby and Len Cotton. An' I think young
Walters, and Binnie Short mebbe."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!"</p>

<p>"Ay. Comin' along to-night?"</p>

<p>"Ay, if it doan't rain."</p>

<p>"Well, see you then."</p>

<p>"So long, Ned."</p>

<p>On the following Monday Ned said good-bye to his mother, and
sweetheart, and to Toffee, and he and the other four boys walked
over to the recruiting-office at Carchester. They were drafted into
the same unit, and sent up to Yorkshire to train. (Yorkshire being
one hundred and fifty miles away was presumably the most convenient
and suitable spot).</p>

<p>They spent five months there, and then Len Cotton was
transferred to the machine Gun Corps, and the other four were
placed in an infantry regiment and sent out to India. They did get
an opportunity of returning to Ashalton, but the night before they
left Ned wrote to his mother:</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear Mother, I think we are off to-morrow. They
don't tell us where we are going but they seem to think it's India
because of the Eastern kit served out and so on. Everything all
right, the grub is fine. Young Walters has gone sick with a bile on
his neck. Hope you are all right. See Toffee don't get into Mr.
Mears yard for this is about the time he puts down that poison for
the rats. Everything all O.K. love from Ned."</p>

<p>He wrote a very similar letter to Ettie, only leaving out the
instructions about Toffee, and adding, "don't get overdoing it now
the warm weathers on."</p>

<p>They touched at Gibraltar, Malta, Alexandria, and Aden. At all
these places he merely sent the cryptic postcard. He did not write
a letter again until he had been three weeks up in the hills in
India. As a matter of fact it had been a terribly rough passage
nearly all the way, especially in the Mediterranean, and nearly all
the boys had been seasick most of the time. Ned had been specially
bad and in the Red Sea had developed a slight fever. In India he
had been sent to a rest-camp up in the hills. He wrote:</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear mother, everything all right. The grub is
fine. I went a bit sick coming out but nothing. Quite all O.K. now.
This is a funny place. The people would make you laugh to look at.
We beat the 2nd Royal Scots by two goals to one. I wasn't playing
but Binnie played a fine game at half-back. He stopped their centre
forward an old league player, time and again. Hope you are keeping
all right. Does Henry Thatcham take Toffee out regler. Everything
serene. love from Ned."</p>

<p>In this letter the words "2nd Royal Scots" were deleted by the
censor.</p>

<p>India at that time was apparently a kind of training-ground for
young recruits. There were a few recalcitrant hill-tribes upon whom
to practise the latest developments of military science, and Ned
was mixed up in one or two of these little scraps. He proved
himself a good soldier, doing precisely what he was told and being
impervious to danger. They were five months in India, and then the
regiment was suddenly drafted back to Egypt. Big things were afoot.
No one knew what was going to happen. They spent ten days in a camp
near Alexandria. They were then detailed for work in connection
with the protection of the banks of the Canal, and Ned was
stationed near the famous pyramid of Gizeh. He wrote to his
mother:</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear mother,<br>
<br>
"everything all right. Pretty quiet so far. This is a funny place.
Young Walters has gone sick again. We had the regimental sports
Thursday. Me and Bert Carter won the three-legged race. The grub is
fine and we get dates and figs for nuts. Hope your cold is all
right by now. Thanks for the parcel which I got on the 27th.
Everything all right. Glad to hear about Mrs. Parsons having the
twins and that. Glad to hear Toffee all right and so with love your
loving son Ned."</p>

<p>They had not been at Gizeh for more than a week before they were
sent back to Alexandria and placed on a transport. In fifteen days
after touching at Imbros, Ned and his companions found themselves
on Gallipoli peninsula. Heavy fighting was in progress. They were
rushed up to the front line. For two days and nights they were in
action and their numbers were reduced to one-third their original
size. For thirty hours they were without water and were being
shelled by gas, harried by flame-throwers, blasted by shrapnel and
high-explosive. At the end of that time they crawled back to the
beach at night through prickly brambles which poisoned them and set
up septic wounds if they scratched them. They lay there dormant for
two days, but still under shell-fire, and then were hurriedly
re-formed into a new regiment, and sent to another part of the
line. This went on continuously for three weeks, and then a
terrible storm and flood occurred. Hundreds of men&mdash;some alive
and some partly alive&mdash;were drowned in the ravines. Ned and
his company lost all their kit, and slept in water for three nights
running. At the end of four weeks he obtained five days' rest at
the base. He wrote to Ettie:</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear Ettie,<br>
<br>
"A long time since I had a letter from you. Hope all right.
Everything all right so far. We had a bad storm but the weather now
keeps fine. Had a fine bathe this morning. There was a man in our
company could make you laugh. He is an Irish Canadian. He plays the
penny whistle fine and sings a bit too. Sorry to say young Walters
died. He got enteric and phewmonnia and so on. I expect his people
will have heard all right. How is old Mrs. Walters? Dick Thursby
got a packet too and Mrs. Quinby's boy I forget his name. How are
them white rabbits of yours. I met a feller as used to take the
milk round for Mr. Brand up at Bodes farm. Funny wasn't it. Well
nothing more now. I hope this finds you as it leaves me your
affectionate Ned."</p>

<p>Ned was three months on Gallipoli peninsula, but he left before
the evacuation. During the whole of that time he was never not
under shell-fire. He took part in seven attacks. On one occasion he
went over the top with twelve hundred others, of whom only one
hundred and seven returned. Once he was knocked unconscious by a
mine explosion which killed sixty-seven men. At the end of that
period he was shot through the back by a sniper. He was put in a
dressing-station, and a gentleman in a white overall came and stuck
a needle into his chest and left him there in a state of nudity for
twelve hours. Work at the field hospitals was very congested just
then. He became a bit delirious and was eventually put on a
hospital ship with a little tag tied to him. After some vague and
restless period he found himself again at Imbros and in a very
comfortable hospital. He stayed there six weeks and his wound
proved to be slight. The bone was only grazed. He wrote to his
mother:</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear mother,<br>
<br>
"Everything all right. I had a scratch but nothing. I hope you
enjoyed the flower show. How funny meeting Mrs. Perks. We have a
fine time here. The grub is fine. Sorry to say Binnie Short went
under. He got gassed one night when he hadn't his mask on. The
weather is mild and pleasant. Glad to hear Henry takes Toffee out
all right. Have not heard from Ettie for some time. We had a fine
concert on Friday. A chap played the flute lovely. Hope you are now
all right again.<br>
<br>
"Your loving son, Ned."</p>

<p>In bed in the hospital at Imbros a bright idea occurred to Ned.
He made his will. Such an idea would never have occurred to him had
it not been forced upon him by the unusual experiences of the past
year. He suddenly realised that of all the boys who had left the
village with him only Len Cotton, as far as he knew, remained. So
one night he took a blunt-pointed pencil, and laboriously wrote on
the space for the will at the end of his pay-book:</p>

<p class="letter">"I leave everything Ive got to my mother Anne
Picklekin including Toffee. I hope Henry Thatcham will continue to
look after Toffee except the silver bowl which I won at the rabbit
show at Oppleford. This I leave to Ettie Skinner as a memorial of
me."</p>

<p>One day Ned enjoyed a great excitement. He was under discharge
from the hospital, and a rumour got round that he and some others
were to be sent back to England. They hung about the island for
three days, and were then packed into an Italian
fruit-steamer&mdash;which had been converted into a transport. It
was very overcrowded and the weather was hot. They sailed one night
and reached another island before dawn. They spent three weeks
doing this. They only sailed at night, for the seas about there
were reported to be infested with submarines. Every morning they
put in at some island in the Greek archipelago, or at some port on
the mainland. At one place there was a terrible epidemic of
illness, owing to some Greek gentleman having sold the men some
doped wine. Fifteen of them died. Ned escaped from this, as he had
not had any of the wine. He was practically a teetotaller except
for an occasional glass of beer. But he was far from happy on that
voyage. The seas were rough and the transport ought to have been
broken up years ago, and this didn't seem to be the right route for
England.</p>

<p>At length they reached a large port called Salonika. They never
went into the town, but were sent straight out to a camp in the
hills ten miles away. The country was very wild and rugged, and
there was great difficulty with water. Everything was polluted and
malarial. There was very little fighting apparently, but plenty of
sickness. He found himself in a Scottish regiment. At least, it was
called Scottish, but the men came from all parts of the world, from
Bow Street to Hong-Kong.</p>

<p>There was to be no Blighty after all, but still&mdash;there it
was! He continued to drill, and march, and clean his rifle and play
the mouth-organ and football. And then one morning he received a
letter from his mother, which had followed him from Imbros. It ran
as follows:</p>

<p class="letter">My Dear Ned,&mdash;<br>
<br>
"How are you, dear? I hope you keep all right. My corf is now
pretty middlin otherwise nothin to complain of. Now dear I have to
tell you something which greives me dear. Im afraid its no good
keepin it from you ony longer dear. <i>Ettie is walkin out with
another feller.</i> A feller from the air station called Alf
Mullet. I taxed her with it and she says yes it is so dear. Now
dear you mustnt take on about this. I told her off I says it was a
disgraceful and you out there fightin for your country and that.
And she says nothin excep yes there it was and she couldnt help it
and her feelins had been changed you being away and that. Now dear
you must put a good face on this and remember theres just as good
fish in the sea as ever came out of it as they say dear. One of Mr.
Beans rabbits died Sunday they think it over-eating you never know
with rabbits. Keep your feet warm dear I hope you got them socks I
sent. Lizzie was at chapel Sunday she had on her green lawn looked
very nice I thought but I wish she wouldnt get them spots on her
face perhaps its only the time of year. Toffee is all right he had
a fight with a hairdale Thursday Henry says got one of his eres
bitten but nothin serous. So now dear I must close as Mrs. Minchin
wants me to go and take tea with her has Florrie has gone to the
schooltreat at Furley. And so dear with love your lovin
Mother."</p>

<p>When he had finished reading this letter he uttered an
exclamation, and a cockney friend sitting on the ground by his side
remarked:</p>

<p>"What's the matter, mate?"</p>

<p>Ned took a packet of cigarettes out of his pocket and lighted
one. Then he said:</p>

<p>"My girl's jilted me."</p>

<p>The cockney laughed and said:</p>

<p>"Gawd! is that all? I thought it was somethin' serious!"</p>

<p>He was cleaning his rifle with an oil rag, and he continued:
"Don't you worry, mate. Women are like those blinkin' little Greek
islands, places to call at but not to stay. What was she like?"</p>

<p>"Oo&mdash;all right."</p>

<p>"Pretty?"</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;middlin'."</p>

<p>"'As she got another feller?"</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, it's all in the gime. If you <i>will</i> go
gallivanting about these foreign parts enjoyin' yerself, what d'yer
expect? What time's kick-off this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Two o'clock."</p>

<p>"Reckon we're goin' to win?"</p>

<p>"I doan't know. 'Pends upon whether McFarlane turns out."</p>

<p>"Yus, 'e's a wonderful player. Keeps the team together
like."</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>"Are you playin'?"</p>

<p>"Ay. I'm playin' right half."</p>

<p>"Are yer? Well, you'll 'ave yer 'ands full. You'll 'ave to
tackle Curly Snider."</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>Ned's team won the match that afternoon, and he wrote to his
mother afterwards:</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Mother,&mdash;<br>
<br>
"We just had a great game against 15 Royal South Hants. McFarlane
played centre half and he was in great form. We lead 2&mdash;0 at
half-time and they scored one at the beginnin of the second half
but Davis got thro towards the end and we beat them by 3-1. I was
playin quite a good game I think but McFarlane is a real first
class. I got your letter all right, am glad your corf is getting
all right. I was sorry about Ettie but of course she knows what she
wants I spose. You dont say what Toffee did to the <i>other
dog</i>. You might tell Henery to let me have a line about this.
Fancy Liz being at chapel. I almos forget what shes like.
Everything is all right. The grub is fine. This is a funny place
all rocks and planes. The Greeks are a stinkin lot for the most
part so must now close with love.<br>
<br>
Ned."</p>

<p>Having completed this letter, Ned got out his pay-book and
revised his will. Ettie Skinner was now deleted, and the silver
bowl won at the rabbit-show at Oppleford was bequeathed to Henry
Thatcham in consideration of his services in taking Toffee out for
runs.</p>

<p>They spent a long and tedious eight months on the plains of
Macedonia, dodging malaria and bullets, cracking vermin in their
shirts, playing football, ragging, quarrelling, drilling,
manoeuvring, and, most demoralising of all, hanging about. And then
a joyous day dawned. This hybrid Scottish regiment were ordered
home! They left Salonica in a French liner and ten days later
arrived at Malta. But in the meantime the gods had been busy. The
wireless operators had been flashing their mysterious signals all
over the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. At Malta the order was
countermanded. They remained there long enough to coal, but the men
were not even given shore leave. The next day they turned Eastwards
again and made for Alexandria.</p>

<p>The cockney was furious. He had the real genius of the grouser,
with the added venom of the man who in the year of grace had lived
by his wits and now found his wits enclosed in an iron cylinder. It
was a disgusting anticlimax.</p>

<p>"When I left that filthy 'ole," he exclaimed, "I swore to God
I'd try and never remember it again. And now I'm darned if we ain't
goin' back there. As if once ain't enough in a man's lifetime! It's
like the blooming cat with the blankety mouse!"</p>

<p>"Eh, well, mon," interjected a Scotsman, "there's ane thing.
They canna keel ye no but once."</p>

<p>"It ain't the killing I mind. It's the blooming mucking about.
What d'yer say, Pickles?"</p>

<p>"Ah, well...there it is," said Ned sententiously.</p>

<p>There was considerable "mucking about" in Egypt, and then they
started off on a long trek through the desert, marching on wire
mesh that had been laid down by the engineers. There was occasional
skirmishing, sniping, fleas, delay, and general discomfort. One
day, in Southern Palestine, Ned was out with a patrol party just
before sundown. They were trekking across the sand between two
oases when shots rang out. Five of the party fell. The rest were
exposed in the open to foes firing from concealment on two sides.
The position was hopeless. They threw up their hands. Two more
shots rang out and the cockney next to Ned fell forward with a
bullet through his throat. Then dark figures came across the sands
towards them. There were only three left, Ned, a Scotsman, and a
boy who had been a clerk in a drapery store at Lewisham before the
war. He said:</p>

<p>"Well, are they going to kill us?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Scotsman. "Onyway, keep your hands weel up and
pray to God."</p>

<p>A tall man advanced, and to their relief beckoned them to
follow. They fell into single file.</p>

<p>"These are no Tur-r-ks at all," whispered the Scotsman. "They're
some nomadic Arab tribe."</p>

<p>The Scotsman had attended evening continuation classes at
Peebles, and was rather fond of the word "nomadic."</p>

<p>They were led to one of the oases, and instructed to sit down.
The Arabs sat round them, armed with rifles. They remained there
till late at night, when another party arrived, and a rope was
produced. They were handcuffed and braced together, and then by
gesticulation told to march. They trailed across the sand for three
hours and a half. There was no moon, but the night was tolerably
clear. At length they came to another oasis, and were bidden to
halt. They sat on the sand for twenty minutes, and one of the Arabs
gave them some water. Then a whistle blew, and they were kicked and
told to follow. The party wended its way through a grove of
cedar-trees. It was pitch-dark. At last they came to a halt by a
large hut. There was much coming and going. When they entered the
hut, in charge of their guard, they were blinded by a strong light.
The hut was comfortably furnished and lighted by electric light. At
a table sat a stout, pale-faced man, with a dark
moustache&mdash;obviously a German. By his side stood a tall German
orderly. The German official looked tired and bored. He glanced at
the prisoners and drew some papers towards him.</p>

<p>"Come and stand here in front of my desk," he said in
English.</p>

<p>They advanced, and he looked at each one carefully. Then he
yawned, dipped his pen in ink, tried it on a sheet of paper, swore,
and inserted a fresh nib.</p>

<p>"Now, you," he said, addressing the Scotchman, when he had
completed these operations. "Name, age, profession, regiment.
Smartly."</p>

<p>He obtained all these particulars from each man. Then he got up
and came round the table, and looking right into the eyes of the
clerk from Lewisham, he said:</p>

<p>"We know, of course, in which direction your brigade is
advancing, but from which direction is the brigade commanded by
Major-General Forbes Fittleworth advancing?"</p>

<p>The three of them all knew this, for it was common gossip of the
march. But the clerk from Lewisham said:</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>The German turned from him to the Scotsman and repeated the
question.</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered the Scotsman.</p>

<p>"From which direction is the brigade commanded by Major-General
Forbes Fittleworth advancing?" he said to Ned.</p>

<p>"Naw! I doan't know," replied Ned.</p>

<p>And then a horrible episode occurred. The German suddenly
whipped out a revolver and shot the clerk from Lewisham through the
body twice. He gave a faint cry and crumbled forward. Without
taking the slightest notice of this horror, the German turned
deliberately and held the revolver pointed at Ned's face. In a
perfectly unimpassioned, toneless voice he repeated:</p>

<p>"From which direction is the brigade commanded by Major-General
Forbes Fittleworth advancing?"</p>

<p>In the silence which followed, the only sound seemed to be the
drone of some machine, probably from the electric-light plant. The
face of Ned was mildly surprised but quite impassive. He answered
without a moment's hesitation:</p>

<p>"Naw! I doan't know."</p>

<p>There was a terrible moment in which the click of the revolver
could almost be heard. It seemed to hover in front of his face for
an unconscionable time, then suddenly the German lowered it with a
curse, and leaning forward, he struck Ned on the side of his face
with the flat of his hand. He treated the Scotsman in the same way,
causing his nose to bleed. Both of the men remained quite
impassive. Then he walked back to his seat, and said calmly:</p>

<p>"Unless you can refresh your memories within the next two hours
you will both share the fate of&mdash;that swine. You will now go
out to the plantation at the back and dig your graves. Dig three
graves."</p>

<p>He spoke sharply in Arabic to the guards, and they were led out.
They were handed a spade each, two Arabs held torches for them to
work by, and four others hovered in a circle twelve paces away. The
soil was light sand, and digging was fairly easy. Each man dug his
own grave, making it about four feet deep. When it came to the
third grave the Scotsman whispered:</p>

<p>"Dig deep, mon."</p>

<p>"Deeper than others?"</p>

<p>"Ay, deep enough to make a wee trench."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>They made it very deep, working together and whispering. When it
was practically completed, apparently a sudden quarrel arose
between the men. They swore at each other, and the Scotsman sprang
out of the trench and gripped Ned by the throat. A fearful struggle
began to take place on the edge of the grave. The guard ran up and
tried to separate them. And then, during the brief confusion there
was a sudden dramatic development. Simultaneously they snatched
their spades. Both the men with the torches were knocked senseless,
and one of them fell into the third grave. The torches were stamped
out and a rifle went off. It was fired by a guard near the hut, and
the bullet struck another Arab who was trying to use his bayonet.
Ned brought a fourth man down with his spade and seized his rifle,
and the Scotsman snatched the rifle of the man who had been shot,
and they both leapt back into their purposely prepared trench.</p>

<p>"We shallna be able to hold this long, but we'll give them a
grand run for their money," said the Scotsman.</p>

<p>The body of one Arab was lying on the brink of their trench and
the other in the trench itself. Fortunately they both had
bandoliers, which Ned and his companion instantly removed.</p>

<p>"You face east and I'll take west," said the Scotsman, his eyes
glittering in the dim light. "I'm going to try and scare that Boche
devil."</p>

<p>He peppered away at the hut, putting bullets through every
window and smashing the telephone connection, which was a fine
target at the top of a post against the sky. Bullets pinged over
their heads from all directions, but there was little chance of
them being rushed while their ammunition held out. However, it
became necessary to look ahead. It was the Scotsman's idea in
digging the graves to plan them in zig-zag formation. The end of
the furthest one was barely ten paces from a clump of aloes. He now
got busy with his spade whilst Ned kept guard in both directions,
occasionally firing at the hut and then in the opposite direction
into the darkness. In half-an-hour the Scotsman had made a shallow
connection between the three graves, leaving just enough room to
crawl through. They then in turn donned the turbans of the two
fallen Arabs, who were otherwise dressed in a kind of semi-European
uniform.</p>

<p>They ended up with a tremendous fusillade against the hut,
riddling it with bullets; then they crept to the end of the
furthest grave, and leaving their rifles, they made a sudden dash
across the open space to the group of aloes, bending low and
limping like wounded Arabs. They reached them in safety, but there
were many open spaces to cover yet. As they emerged from the trees
Ned stumbled on a dark figure. He kicked it and ran. They both ran
zig-zag fashion, and tore off their turbans as they raced along.
They covered nearly a hundred yards, and then bullets began to
search them out again. They must have gone nearly a mile before the
Scotsman gave a sudden slight groan.</p>

<p>"I'm hit," he said.</p>

<p>He stumbled on into a clump of bushes, and fell down.</p>

<p>"Is it bad?" asked Ned.</p>

<p>"Eh, laddie, I'm doon," he said quietly. He put his hand to his
side. He had been shot through the lungs. Ned stayed with him all
night, and they were undisturbed. Just before dawn the Scotsman
said:</p>

<p>"Eh, mon, but yon was a bonny fight," and he turned on his back
and died.</p>

<p>Ned made a rough grave with his hands, and buried his companion.
He took his identification disc and his pocket-book and small
valuables, with the idea of returning them to his kin if he should
get through himself. He also took his water-flask, which still
fortunately contained a little water. He lay concealed all day, and
at night he boldly donned his turban, issued forth and struck a
caravan-trail. He continued this for four days and nights, hiding
in the daytime and walking at nights. He lived on figs and dates,
and one night he raided a village and caught a fowl, which also
nearly cost him his life.</p>

<p>On the fourth night his water gave out, and he was becoming
light-headed. He stumbled on into the darkness. He was a desperate
man. All the chances were against him, and he felt unmoved and
fatalistic. He drew his clasp-knife and gripped it tightly in his
right hand. He was hardly conscious of what he was doing, and where
he was going. The moon was up, and after some hours he suddenly
beheld a small oblong hut. He got it into his head that this was
the hut where his German persecutor was. He crept stealthily
towards it.</p>

<p>"I'll kill that swine," he muttered.</p>

<p>He was within less than a hundred yards of the hut, when a voice
called out:</p>

<p>"'Alt! Who goes there?"</p>

<p>"It's me," he said. "Doan't thee get in my way. I want to kill
him. I'm going to kill him. I'm going to stab him through his black
heart."</p>

<p>"What the hell&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The sentry was not called upon to use his rifle, for the
turbaned figure fell forward in a swoon.</p>

<p>Three weeks later Ned wrote to his mother from Bethlehem (where
Christ was born), and this is what he said:</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Mother,&mdash;<br>
<br>
"Everything going on all right. I got three parcels here altogether
as I had been away copped by some black devils an unfriendly tribe.
I got back all right though. The ointment you sent was fine and so
was them rock cakes. What a funny thing about Belle getting lost at
the picnick. We got an awful soaking from the Mid-Lancs Fusiliers
on Saturday. They had two league cracks playing one a wonderful
centreforward. He scored three goals. They beat us by 7-0. The
weather is hot but quite plessant at night. We have an old sergeant
who was born in America does wonderful tricks with string and knots
and so on. He tells some very tall yarns. You have to take them
with a pinch of salt. Were getting fine grub here pretty quiet so
far. Hope Henry remembers to wash Toffee with that stuff every week
or so. Sorry to hear Len Cotton killed. Is his sister still walking
out with that feller at Aynham. I never think he was much class for
her getting good money though. Hope you have not had any more
trouble with the boiler. That was a good price to get for that old
buck rabbit. Well there's nothing more just now and so with love
your loving son.<br>
<br>
Ned."</p>

<p>Ned went through the Palestine campaign and was slightly wounded
in the thigh. After spending some time in hospital he was sent to
the coast and put on duty looking after Turkish prisoners. He
remained there six months and was then shipped to Italy. On the way
the transport was torpedoed. He was one of a party of fifty-seven
picked up by French destroyers. He had been for over an hour in the
water in his life-belt. He was landed in Corsica and there he
developed pneumonia. He only wrote his mother one short note about
this:</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Mother,&mdash;<br>
<br>
"Have been a bit dicky owing to falling in the water and getting
wet. But going on all right. Nurses very nice and one of the
doctors rowed for Cambridge against Oxford. I forget the year but
Cambridge won by two and a half lengths. We have very nice flowers
in the ward. Well not much to write about and so with love your
loving son,<br>
<br>
Ned."</p>

<p>Ned was fit again in a few weeks and he was sent up to the
Italian front. He took part in several engagements and was
transferred to the French front during the last months of the war.
He was in the great retreat in March, 1918, and in the advance in
July. After the armistice he was with the army of occupation on the
banks of the Rhine. His mother wrote to him there:</p>

<p class="letter">My Dear Ned,&mdash;<br>
<br>
"Am glad that the fightin us now all over dear. How relieved you
must be. Mr. Filter was in Sunday. He thinks there will be no
difficulty about you gettin your job back when you come back dear.
Miss Siffkins as been deliverin but as Mr. Filter says its not
likely a girl is going to be able to deliver letters not like a man
can and that dear. So now you will be comin home soon dear. That
will be nice. We had a pleesant afternoon at the Church
needlewomens gild. Miss Barbary Banstock sang very pleesantly abide
with me and the vicar told a very amusing story about a little girl
and a prince she didn't know he was a prince and talked to him just
as though he was a man it was very amusin dear. I hear Ettie is
goin to get married next month they wont get me to the weddin was
it ever so I call it disgraceful and I have said so. Maud Bean is
expectin in April that makes her forth in three years. Mr. Bean as
lost three more rabbits they say its rats this time. The potaters
are a poor lot this time but the runners and cabbidge promiss well.
So now dear I will close. Hoppin to have your back dear soon.<br>
<br>
"Your loving mother."</p>

<p>It was, however, the autumn before Ned was demobilised. One day
in early October he came swinging up the village street carrying a
white kit-bag slung across his left shoulder. He looked more
bronzed and perhaps a little thinner, but otherwise little altered
by his five years of war experiences. The village of Ashalton was
quite unaltered, but he observed several strange faces; he only met
two acquaintances on the way to his mother's cottage, and they both
said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Ned! Ye're home agen then!"</p>

<p>In each case he replied:</p>

<p>"Ay," and grinned, and walked on.</p>

<p>He entered his mother's cottage, and she was expecting him. The
lamp was lighted and a grand tea was spread. There was fresh boiled
beetroot, tinned salmon, salad, cake, and a large treacle tart. She
embraced him and said:</p>

<p>"Well, Ned! Ye're back then."</p>

<p>He replied: "Ay."</p>

<p>"Ye're lookin' fine," she said. "What a fine suit they've given
ye!"</p>

<p>"Ay," he replied.</p>

<p>"I expect you want yer tea?"</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>He had dropped his kit-bag, and he moved luxuriously round the
little parlour, looking at all the familiar objects. Then he sat
down, and his mother brought the large brown teapot from the hob
and they had a cosy tea. She told him all the very latest news of
the village, and all the gossip of the countryside, and Ned grinned
and listened. He said nothing at all. The tea had progressed to the
point when Ned's mouth was full of treacle tart, when his mother
suddenly stopped, and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I'm afraid I have somethin' distressin' to tell ye,
dear."</p>

<p>"O-oh? what's that?"</p>

<p>"Poor Toffee was killed."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>Ned stopped suddenly in the mastication of the treacle tart. His
eyes bulged and his cheeks became very red. He stared at his mother
wildly, and repeated:</p>

<p>"What's that? What's that ye say, Mother?"</p>

<p>"Poor Toffee, my dear. It happened right at the crossroads.
Henry was takin' him out. It seems he ran round in front of a
steam-roller, and a motor came round the corner sudden. Henry
called out, but too late. Went right over his back. Poor Henry was
quite upset. He brought him home. What's the matter, dear?"</p>

<p>Ned had pushed his chair back, and he stood up. He stared at his
mother like a man who has seen horror for the first time.</p>

<p>"Where is&mdash;where was&mdash;" he stammered.</p>

<p>"We buried 'im, dear, under the little mound beyond the rabbit
hutches."</p>

<p>Ned staggered across the room like a drunken man, and repeated
dismally:</p>

<p>"The little mound beyond the rabbit hutches!"</p>

<p>He lifted the latch, and groped his way into the garden. His
mother followed him. He went along the mud path, past the
untenanted hutches covered with tarpaulin. Some tall sunflowers
stared at him insolently. A fine rain was beginning to fall. In the
dim light he could just see the little mound&mdash;signifying the
spot where Toffee was buried. He stood there bare-headed, gazing at
the spot. His mother did not like to speak. She tiptoed back to the
door. But after a time she called out:</p>

<p>"Ned!...Ned!"</p>

<p>He did not seem to hear, and she waited patiently. At the end of
several minutes she called again:</p>

<p>"Ned!...Ned dear, come and finish your tea."</p>

<p>He replied quite quietly:</p>

<p>"All right, Mother."</p>

<p>But he kept his face averted, for he did not want his mother to
see the tears which were streaming down his cheeks.</p>

<h2><a name="ch04" id="ch04"></a>4. OVERHEARD</h2>

<p>It was nearly two o'clock. The tea-shop was at its busiest.
Clerks, salesmen, typists, shoppers from the suburbs jostled
against each other in the scramble for buns, tea, sausages, fried
fish, ham or coffee. Everyone seemed hungry and hurried. The
atmosphere reeked with the varied odours of cooked food. Some were
eating greedily, others calling impatiently for their bills or
grumbling at the slackness of the service, or about a draught which
came from undiscoverable places. The slim girl who served some
thirty odd customers in the annexe moved hither and thither with an
overladen tray, which she had to carry twenty yards backwards and
forwards to the serving-hatch. Her movements were languid and
listless, but her memory seemed surprising. She would take seven or
eight orders of such varied nature as "large coffee, Cambridge
sausages, roll and butter, and plum jam," to "poached eggs on toast
and a small tea," and she remembered them all correctly and brought
the refreshment to the right persons. She was of indeterminate age,
somewhere round about the thirties, with fair pretty hair, and a
face that at one time might have been almost beautiful.</p>

<p>"Hurry up with my scrambled eggs on toast, miss, I'm going to a
matin&eacute;e."</p>

<p>"Yes, madam."</p>

<p>She was studiously polite to everyone, polite but inert. She
seemed to be performing her duties as though mesmerized. Gradually
the crowd began to thin. The clerks and typists had to be back at
their offices, the lady had gone to her matin&eacute;e, the
salesmen to their clients. As they poured out, queuing up at the
pay-desk, a few late comers straggled in. Among the latter came a
young man of somewhat florid appearance. He was wearing a well-cut
blue serge suit, with a yellow woollen waistcoat, and a felt hat.
He had a red, rather coarse face, a little clipped moustache, and
splendid teeth which flashed as he grinned. And he grinned a good
deal, as a man well-satisfied with himself and life in general. He
found a seat in the corner of the annexe and sat down. The slim
waitress came along with her heavily laden tray. She glanced round
and her eye alighted on the young man. Her face betrayed no
recognition, but she put her tray down on the marble slab of an
adjoining table with an abrupt bump. She said "Sorry!" and as she
handed plates and cups round she mumbled:</p>

<p>"Fried plaice, sir? Thank you, sir. Coffee, madam? Thank you,
madam. Two hard-boiled eggs, sir? Thank you, sir," and so on till
the table was served. Then she passed on to the table where the
young man sat. She still carried her tray, for there were two
people there waiting to be served. She put down her tray again and
said:</p>

<p>"Tea, roll and butter, madam? Thank you, madam. Cold roast beef,
sir? Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>The young man looked at her and grinned, but she did not look at
him. Her lips were tight and drawn, and pale. A woman at the table
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Are my kidneys never coming?"</p>

<p>The young man said: "Well, Florrie?"</p>

<p>Without looking at him she said: "What do you want to eat?" To
the lady she said: "Your kidneys will be ready in two minutes,
madam."</p>

<p>The young man, a little sheepish at his reception, said
quietly:</p>

<p>"Oh, well. I'll have some cold tongue and coffee."</p>

<p>"Large or small?"</p>

<p>"Large."</p>

<p>She moved away with her tray, collecting orders as she went,
while the young man picked his splendid teeth with a tram ticket.
After an interval she returned. The weary lines of her face seemed
to be concealing the fires of tremulous emotion. She placed the
kidneys in front of the lady, and the coffee and tongue in front of
the young man. Quite mechanically she repeated:</p>

<p>"Large coffee and tongue, sir? Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>She took three more orders, and again vanished.</p>

<p>The young man devoured his tongue and coffee in silence. The
grin on his face became sardonic. It was as though he were saying
to himself: "Oh, well, I don't care." More people went out and
fewer came in. The time was rapidly approaching that sparse half
hour or so that is too late for lunch and too early for tea. The
lady finished her kidneys, powdered her nose, and departed. The
slim waitress was less occupied. She drifted up and down, her tense
pale face expressing nothing. There was only one other person at
the young man's table, a man at the further end reading an evening
paper. At last she came to him. Bending over a cruet which she
pretended to be adjusting she whispered hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Oh, why didn't you come last night?"</p>

<p>The uneasy grin flittered across the young man's face. He
answered in the same key:</p>

<p>"I couldn't. I couldn't get away."</p>

<p>"What were you doing? Spending the evening with Lily?"</p>

<p>"No. I swear I wasn't."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"I had to go and see my uncle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Harrison, there's a customer over there asking for stewed
prunes and rice." It was a tall angular manageress, in a black
frock, speaking.</p>

<p>"Coming, madam."</p>

<p>The mission in search of stewed prunes and rice occupied some
time. And further time was wasted by a customer who said that his
bill was wrong. It was quite true. She had charged
eightpence-halfpenny instead of sevenpence-halfpenny for sardines
on toast. The man with the newspaper disappeared. There was no one
else at the young man's table. Once again she leant over the
cruet.</p>

<p>"You don't love her, do you, Harry?"</p>

<p>The young man laughed self-consciously.</p>

<p>"Lord, no. I wanted to tell you, Florrie. I've had a bit of
luck. My uncle's coming to the rescue."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"He's paying off that debt. And he's going to pay my fare to
Canada."</p>

<p>"Canada!"</p>

<p>She caught her breath, and scraped crumbs into a little pile
with the end of a knife. "Canada! but you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to start all over again."</p>

<p>"But don't you want me to go to Canada with yer?"</p>

<p>"You? How could you?"</p>

<p>"I could work my way out&mdash;stewardess or something. I'd go
with you. You're not going to marry Lily, are you, Harry?"</p>

<p>"Not likely."</p>

<p>"She's not good enough for you, Harry. Oh, God! I believe it's
her what got you going wrong, mixing with all them racing chaps and
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're too good for me, Florrie."</p>

<p>"Hi, miss, order me a boiled egg. And look here, tell 'em it's
to be soft&mdash;not more than three minutes."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>While she was away the young man fidgetted with his moustache.
He looked like a man eager to escape from an awkward situation. He
gave a jaunty thrust to his hat, which he had never removed. He
drew things on the marble top with a spoon. At last she came
back.</p>

<p>"You say I'm too good for you, Harry. P'raps in some ways I am.
I go straight, in any case, which is more than you ever do. But I
don't put much stock by that. I love yer, and that's enough for me.
I'm willing to go with yer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps one day when I get on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, go on! Once you get out there, and you'll forget all about
me. You never did reely love me&mdash;and now that Lily&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell you there's nothing in it about Lily."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't let her lead you astray, Harry."</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;lead me astray?"</p>

<p>The tall manageress swept down the room.</p>

<p>"Now then, Miss Harrison, get them cruets together. We shall
have the teas coming in soon."</p>

<p>"Yes, madam."</p>

<p>The room seemed to get dimmer. A queer party of country people
strolled in, the kind of people who demand eggs and bacon at a
quarter past three in the afternoon. What meal is this? breakfast,
lunch or high tea? What did it matter? Outside was the roar of
traffic; inside the low hum of desultory talk. A big man was
leaning across the table, shaking a fat finger in the face of a
doleful individual with a sandy beard, and declaiming:</p>

<p>"I ses to 'im that's not the right and proper way to lay a floor
joist."</p>

<p>Someone wanted to know the right time, and someone else the best
way to get to the Horticultural Show. She thought suddenly of
flowers...great masses of prize blossoms, purple, blue, and white,
and the perfume of them and the memories...</p>

<p>"What fish have you got to-day, miss?"</p>

<p>"Only filletted plaice left, sir."</p>

<p>The young man was getting up, and stretching himself indolently.
She left an order and went across to him. With a little catch in
her voice she said:</p>

<p>"You're going then?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What's the good?"</p>

<p>"When will I see you?"</p>

<p>"I'm sailing Saturday."</p>

<p>"Saturday! That's only four days. You'll see me before you
go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," the young man whispered unconvincingly. "I'll either
drop you a line or call in."</p>

<p>"Promise?"</p>

<p>The promise was given in the same key.</p>

<p>"You'll want your bill. It comes to tenpence-halfpenny."</p>

<p>"Thanks, so long, old girl."</p>

<p>There was a break in the wall half-way down the room. When he
reached it they were comparatively alone for a brief moment. She
said fiercely:</p>

<p>"Harry, I've loved yer all these years. Don't be cruel. When I
was&mdash;when I was younger you did care for me a tiny bit. I've
worked my fingers out for you. I've given you my savings. I wasn't
bad-looking once before I came into this business. It hasn't done
me any good. I get tired. The days seem long. You won't&mdash;you
won't&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man holding forth indignantly about the right way to lay
floor joists, called out:</p>

<p>"Hi, miss, bring me another cup of corfee."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Coming, sir...You won't&mdash;"</p>

<p>The young man's grin struggled desperately to assert itself. He
mumbled something like:</p>

<p>"There, there. It'll be all right. You'll see."</p>

<p>He walked self-consciously to the pay-desk. She went to collect
her tray. Down below in the smoke-room could be heard the sound of
youths noisily playing dominoes and laughing. "There's nothing to
laugh about," she thought at random. The tray was filled with
soiled plates, and cups and saucers, egg shells and sausage skins.
When she emerged once more into the main room, the young man had
gone. She vanished with her tray and in a few minutes returned with
it re-laden. She went to the table where the country people
were.</p>

<p>"Eggs and bacon, madam? Thank you, madam. Eggs and bacon, sir?
Thank you, sir. Eggs and bacon, miss? Thank you, miss."</p>

<p>The man of the floor joists bawled out:</p>

<p>"Hi, have you got my corfee, miss?"</p>

<p>She looked at him a little startled, the vexatious expression of
one who takes a pride in work and is found wanting. She said:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir. I forgot. I'll go and fetch it."</p>

<p>"Damn these waitresses!" growled the man of the floor
joists.</p>

<h2><a name="ch05" id="ch05"></a>5. A SOURCE OF IRRITATION</h2>

<p>To look at old Sam Gates you would never suspect him of having
nerves. His sixty-nine years of close application to the needs of
the soil had given him a certain earthy stolidity. To observe him
hoeing, or thinning out a broad field of turnips, hardly attracted
one's attention. He seemed so much part and parcel of the whole
scheme. He blended into the soil like a glorified swede.
Nevertheless, the half-dozen people who claimed his acquaintance
knew him to be a man who suffered from little moods of
irritability.</p>

<p>And on this glorious morning a little incident annoyed him
unreasonably. It concerned his niece Aggie. She was a plump girl
with clear blue eyes and a face as round and inexpressive as the
dumplings for which the county was famous. She came slowly across
the long sweep of the downland and putting down the bundle wrapped
up in a red handkerchief which contained his breakfast and dinner,
she said:</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle, is there any noos?"</p>

<p>Now this may not appear to the casual reader to be a remark
likely to cause irritation, but it affected old Sam Gates as a very
silly and unnecessary question. It was, moreover, the constant
repetition of it which was beginning to anger him. He met his niece
twice a day. In the morning she brought his bundle of food at
seven, and when he passed his sister's cottage on the way home to
tea at five she was invariably hanging about the gate. And on each
occasion she always said, in exactly the same voice:</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle, is there any noos?"</p>

<p>"Noos!" What "noos" should there be? For sixty-nine years he had
never lived further than five miles from Halvesham. For nearly
sixty of those years he had bent his back above the soil. There
were indeed historic occasions: once, for instance, when he had
married Annie Hachet. And there was the birth of his daughter.
There was also a famous occasion when he had visited London. Once
he had been to a flower show at Market Roughborough. He either went
or didn't go to church on Sundays. He had had many interesting
chats with Mr. James at "The Cowman," and three years ago had sold
a pig to Mrs. Waig. But he couldn't always have interesting "noos"
of this sort up his sleeve. Didn't the silly gaffir know that for
the last three weeks he had been thinning out turnips for Mr. Dodge
on this very same field? What "noos" could there be?</p>

<p>He blinked at his niece, and didn't answer. She undid the
parcel, and said:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Goping's fowl got out again last night."</p>

<p>He replied, "Ah!" in a non-committal manner, and began to munch
his bread and bacon. His niece picked up the handkerchief, and
humming to herself, walked back across the field. It was a glorious
morning, and a white sea-mist added to the promise of a hot day. He
sat there munching, thinking of nothing in particular, but
gradually subsiding into a mood of placid content. He noticed the
back of Aggie disappear in the distance. It was a mile to the
cottage, and a mile and a half to Halvesham. Silly things, girls!
They were all alike. One had to make allowances. He dismissed her
from his thoughts and took a long swig of tea out of a bottle.
Insects buzzed lazily. He tapped his pocket to assure himself that
his pouch of shag was there, and then he continued munching. When
he had finished, he lighted his pipe and stretched himself
comfortably. He looked along the line of turnips he had thinned,
and then across the adjoining field of swedes. Silver streaks
appeared on the sea below the mist. In some dim way he felt happy
in his solitude amidst this sweeping immensity of earth and sea and
sky.</p>

<p>And then something else came to irritate him. It was one of
"these dratted airyplanes." "Airyplanes" were his pet aversion. He
could find nothing to be said in their favour. Nasty, noisy,
vile-smelling things that seared the heavens, and make the earth
dangerous. And every day there seemed to be more and more of them.
Of course "this old war" was responsible for a lot of them, he
knew. The war was "a plaguey noosance." They were short-handed on
the farm. Beer and tobacco were dear, and Mrs. Stevens' nephew had
been and got wounded in the foot.</p>

<p>He turned his attention once more to the turnips. But an
"airyplane" has an annoying genius for gripping one's attention.
When it appears on the scene, however much we dislike it it has a
way of taking stage-centre; we cannot help constantly looking at
it. And so it was with old Sam Gates. He spat on his hands, and
blinked up at the sky. And suddenly the aeroplane behaved in a very
extraordinary manner. It was well over the sea when it seemed to
lurch in a drunken manner, and skimmed the water. Then it shot up
at a dangerous angle and zigzagged. It started to go farther out,
and then turned and made for the land. The engines were making a
curious grating noise. It rose once more, and then suddenly dived
downwards and came plump down right in the middle of Mr. Dodge's
field of swedes!</p>

<p>Finally, as if not content with this desecration, it ran along
the ground, ripping and tearing up twenty-five yards of good
swedes, and then came to a stop. Old Sam Gates was in a terrible
state. The aeroplane was more than a hundred yards away, but he
waved his arms, and called out:</p>

<p>"Hi! you there, you mustn't land in they swedes! They're Mister
Dodge's."</p>

<p>The instant the aeroplane stopped a man leapt out, and gazed
quickly round. He glanced at Sam Gates, and seemed uncertain
whether to address him or whether to concentrate his attention on
the flying-machine. The latter arrangement appeared to be his
ultimate decision. He dived under the engine, and became
frantically busy. Sam had never seen anyone work with such furious
energy. But all the same, it was not to be tolerated. It was
disgraceful. Sam started out across the field, almost hurrying in
his indignation. When he approached within earshot of the aviator,
he cried out again:</p>

<p>"Hi! you mustn't rest your old airyplane here. You've kicked up
all Mr. Dodge's swedes. A nice thing you've done!"</p>

<p>He was within five yards when suddenly the aviator turned and
covered him with a revolver! And, speaking in a sharp, staccato
voice, he said:</p>

<p>"Old Grandfather, you must sit down. I am very occupied. If you
interfere or attempt to go away, I shoot you. So!"</p>

<p>Sam gazed at the horrid glittering little barrel, and gasped.
Well he never! To be threatened with murder when you're doing your
duty in your employer's private property! But, still, perhaps the
man was mad. A man must be more or less mad to go up in one of
those crazy things. And life was very sweet on that summer morning,
in spite of sixty-nine years. He sat down among the swedes.</p>

<p>The aviator was so busy with his cranks and machinery that he
hardly deigned to pay him any attention, except to keep the
revolver handy. He worked feverishly, and Sam sat watching him. At
the end of ten minutes he seemed to have solved his troubles with
the machine, but he still seemed very scared. He kept on glancing
round and out to sea. When his repairs were completed, he
straightened his back and wiped the perspiration from his brow. He
was apparently on the point of springing back into the machine and
going off, when a sudden mood of facetiousness, caused by relief
from the strain he had endured, came to him. He turned to old Sam,
and smiled; at the same time remarking:</p>

<p>"Well, old grandfather, and now we shall be all right, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>He came close up to Sam, and then suddenly started back.</p>

<p>"Gott!" he cried. "Paul Jouperts!"</p>

<p>Sam gazed at him, bewildered, and the madman started talking to
him in some foreign tongue. Sam shook his head.</p>

<p>"You no right," he remarked, "to come bargin' through they
swedes of Mr. Dodge's."</p>

<p>And then the aviator behaved in a most peculiar manner. He came
up and examined his face very closely, and gave a gentle tug at his
beard and hair, as if to see whether it were real or false.</p>

<p>"What is your name, old man?" he said.</p>

<p>"Sam Gates."</p>

<p>The aviator muttered some words that sounded something like
"mare vudish!" and then turned to his machine. He appeared to be
dazed and in a great state of doubt. He fumbled with some cranks,
but kept glancing at old Sam. At last he got into the car and
started the engine. Then he stopped, and sat there deep in thought.
At last he suddenly sprang out again, and, approaching Sam, he said
very deliberately:</p>

<p>"Old grandfather, I shall require you to accompany me."</p>

<p>Sam gasped.</p>

<p>"Eh?" he said. "What be talkin' about? 'company? I got these
here lines o' tarnips&mdash;I be already behoind&mdash;"</p>

<p>The disgusting little revolver once more flashed before his
eyes.</p>

<p>"There must be no discussion," came the voice. "It is necessary
that you mount the seat of the car without delay. Otherwise I shoot
you like the dog you are. So!"</p>

<p>Old Sam was hale and hearty. He had no desire to die so
ignominiously. The pleasant smell of the downland was in his
nostrils. His foot was on his native heath. He mounted the seat of
the car, contenting himself with a mutter:</p>

<p>"Well, that be a noice thing, I must say! Flyin' about the
country with all they tarnips on'y half thinned&mdash;"</p>

<p>He found himself strapped in. The aviator was in a fever of
anxiety to get away. The engines made a ghastly splutter and noise.
The thing started running along the ground. Suddenly it shot
upwards, giving the swedes a last contemptuous kick. At twenty
minutes to eight that morning old Sam found himself being borne
right up above his fields and out to sea! His breath came quickly.
He was a little frightened.</p>

<p>"God forgive me!" he murmured.</p>

<p>The thing was so fantastic and sudden, his mind could not grasp
it. He only felt in some vague way that he was going to die, and he
struggled to attune his mind to the change. He offered up a mild
prayer to God, Who, he felt, must be very near, somewhere up in
these clouds. Automatically he thought of the vicar at Halvesham,
and a certain sense of comfort came to him at the reflection that
on the previous day he had taken a "cooking of runner beans" to
God's representative in that village. He felt calmer after that,
but the horrid machine seemed to go higher and higher. He could not
turn in his seat and he could see nothing but sea and sky. Of
course the man was mad, mad as a March hare. Of what earthly use
could <i>he</i> be to anyone? Besides, he had talked pure
gibberish, and called him Paul Something, when he had already told
him that his name was Sam. The thing would fall down into the sea
soon, and they would both be drowned. Well, well! He had reached
the three-score years and ten.</p>

<p>He was protected by a screen, but it seemed very cold. What on
earth would Mr. Dodge say? There was no one left to work the land
but a fool of a boy named Billy Whitehead at Deric's Cross. On, on,
on they went at a furious pace. His thoughts danced disconnectedly
from incidents of his youth, conversations with the vicar, hearty
meals in the open, a frock his sister wore on the day of the
postman's wedding, the drone of a psalm, the illness of some ewes
belonging to Mr. Dodge. Everything seemed to be moving very
rapidly, upsetting his sense of time. He felt outraged and yet at
moments there was something entrancing in the wild experience. He
seemed to be living at an incredible pace. Perhaps he was really
dead, and on his way to the Kingdom of God? Perhaps this was the
way they took people?</p>

<p>After some indefinite period he suddenly caught sight of a long
strip of land. Was this a foreign country? or were they returning?
He had by this time lost all feeling of fear. He became interested,
and almost disappointed. The "airyplane" was not such a fool as it
looked. It was very wonderful to be right up in the sky like this.
His dreams were suddenly disturbed by a fearful noise. He thought
the machine was blown to pieces. It dived and ducked through the
air, and things were bursting all round it and making an awful din;
and then it went up higher and higher. After a while these noises
ceased, and he felt the machine gliding downwards. They were really
right above solid land, trees, and fields, and streams, and white
villages. Down, down, down they glided. This was a foreign country.
There were straight avenues of poplars and canals. This was not
Halvesham. He felt the thing glide gently and bump into a field.
Some men ran forward and approached them, and the mad aviator
called out to them. They were mostly fat men in grey uniforms, and
they all spoke this foreign gibberish. Someone came and unstrapped
him. He was very stiff, and could hardly move. An exceptionally
gross-looking man punched him in the ribs, and roared with
laughter. They all stood round and laughed at him, while the mad
aviator talked to them and kept pointing at him. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Old grandfather, you must come with me."</p>

<p>He was led to a zinc-roofed building, and shut in a little room.
There were guards outside with fixed bayonets. After a while the
mad aviator appeared again, accompanied by two soldiers. He
beckoned him to follow. They marched through a quadrangle and
entered another building. They went straight into an office where a
very important-looking man, covered with medals, sat in an easy
chair. There was a lot of saluting and clicking of heels.</p>

<p>The aviator pointed at Sam and said something, and the man with
the medals started at sight of him, and then came up and spoke to
him in English.</p>

<p>"What is your name? Where do you come from? Your age? The name
and birthplace of your parents?"</p>

<p>He seemed intensely interested, and also pulled his hair and
beard to see if they came off. So well and naturally did he and the
aviator speak English that after a voluble cross-examination they
drew apart, and continued the conversation in that language. And
the extraordinary conversation was of this nature:</p>

<p>"It is a most remarkable resemblance," said the man with medals.
"<i>Unglaublich!</i> But what do you want me to do with him,
Hausemann?"</p>

<p>"The idea came to me suddenly, excellency," replied the aviator,
"and you may consider it worthless. It is just this. The
resemblance is so amazing. Paul Jouperts has given us more valuable
information than anyone at present in our service. And the English
know that. There is an award of twenty-five thousand francs on his
head. Twice they have captured him, and each time he escaped. All
the company commanders and their staff have his photograph. He is a
serious thorn in their flesh."</p>

<p>"Well?" replied the man with the medals.</p>

<p>The aviator whispered confidently:</p>

<p>"Suppose, your excellency, that they found the dead body of Paul
Jouperts?"</p>

<p>"Well?" replied the big man.</p>

<p>"My suggestion is this. To-morrow, as you know, the English are
attacking Hill 701, which we have for tactical reasons decided to
evacuate. If after the attack they find the dead body of Paul
Jouperts in, say, the second lines, they will take no further
trouble in the matter. You know their lack of thoroughness. Pardon
me, I was two years at Oxford University. And consequently Paul
Jouperts will be able to&mdash;prosecute his labours
undisturbed."</p>

<p>The man with the medals twirled his moustache and looked
thoughtfully at his colleague.</p>

<p>"Where is Paul at the moment?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He is acting as a gardener at the Convent of St. Eloise at
Mailleton-en-haut, which, as you know, is one hundred metres from
the headquarters of the British central army staff."</p>

<p>The man with the medals took two or three rapid turns up and
down the room. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Your plan is excellent, Hausemann. The only point of difficulty
is that the attack started this morning."</p>

<p>"This morning?" exclaimed the other.</p>

<p>"Yes. The English attacked unexpectedly at dawn. We have already
evacuated the first line. We shall evacuate the second line at
eleven-fifty. It is now ten-fifteen. There may be just time."</p>

<p>He looked suddenly at old Sam in the way that a butcher might
look at a prize heifer at an agricultural show, and remarked
casually:</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a remarkable resemblance. It seems a pity not
to...do something with it."</p>

<p>Then, speaking in German, he added:</p>

<p>"It is worth trying, and if it succeeds, the higher authorities
shall hear of your lucky accident and inspiration, Herr Hausemann.
Instruct Oberleutnant Schutz to send the old fool by two orderlies
to the east extremity of trench 38. Keep him there till the order
of evacuation is given. Then shoot him, but don't disfigure him,
and lay him out face upwards."</p>

<p>The aviator saluted and withdrew, accompanied by his victim. Old
Sam had not understood the latter part of the conversation, and he
did not catch quite all that was said in English, but he felt that
somehow things were not becoming too promising, and it was time to
assert himself. So he remarked when they got outside:</p>

<p>"Now, look'ee here, mister, when be I goin' back to my
tarnips?"</p>

<p>And the aviator replied with a pleasant smile:</p>

<p>"Do not be disturbed, old grandfather; you shall...get back to
the soil quite soon."</p>

<p>In a few moments he found himself in a large grey car,
accompanied by four soldiers. The aviator left him. The country was
barren and horrible, full of great pits and rents, and he could
hear the roar of artillery and the shriek of shells. Overhead,
aeroplanes were buzzing angrily. He seemed to be suddenly
transported from the Kingdom of God to the Pit of Darkness. He
wondered whether the vicar had enjoyed the runner beans. He could
not imagine runner beans growing here, runner beans, ay! or
anything else. If this was a foreign country, give him dear old
England.</p>

<p>Gr-r-r-r&mdash;Bang! Something exploded just at the rear of the
car. The soldiers ducked, and one of them pushed him in the stomach
and swore.</p>

<p>"An ugly-looking lout," he thought. "If I was twenty years
younger I'd give him a punch in the eye that 'ud make him sit
up."</p>

<p>The car came to a halt by a broken wall. The party hurried out
and dived behind a mound. He was pulled down a kind of shaft and
found himself in a room buried right underground, where three
officers were drinking and smoking. The soldiers saluted and handed
a typewritten despatch. The officers looked at him drunkenly, and
one came up and pulled his beard and spat in his face, and called
him "an old English swine." He then shouted out some instructions
to the soldiers, and they led him out into the narrow trench. One
walked behind him and occasionally prodded him with the butt-end of
a gun. The trenches were half-full of water, and reeked of gases,
powder, and decaying matter. Shells were constantly bursting
overhead, and in places the trenches had crumbled and were nearly
blocked up. They stumbled on, sometimes falling, sometimes dodging
moving masses, and occasionally crawling over the dead bodies of
men. At last they reached a deserted-looking trench, and one of the
soldiers pushed him into the corner of it and growled something,
and then disappeared round the angle. Old Sam was exhausted. He lay
panting against the mud wall, expecting every minute to be blown to
pieces by one of those infernal things that seemed to be getting
more and more insistent. The din went on for nearly twenty minutes,
and he was alone in the trench. He fancied he heard a whistle
amidst the din. Suddenly one of the soldiers who had accompanied
him came stealthily round the corner. And there was a look in his
eye old Sam did not like. When he was within five yards the soldier
raised his rifle and pointed it at Sam's body. Some instinct
impelled the old man at that instant to throw himself forward on
his face. As he did so, he was conscious of a terrible explosion,
and he had just time to observe the soldier falling in a heap near
him, when he lost consciousness.</p>

<p>His consciousness appeared to return to him with a snap. He was
lying on a plank in a building, and he heard someone say:</p>

<p>"I believe the old boy's English."</p>

<p>He looked round. There were a lot of men lying there, and others
in khaki and white overalls were busy amongst them. He sat up and
rubbed his head, and said:</p>

<p>"Hi, mister, where be I now?"</p>

<p>Someone laughed, and a young man came up and said:</p>

<p>"Well, old thing, you were very nearly in hell. Who the devil
are you?"</p>

<p>Someone else came up, and the two of them were discussing him.
One of them said:</p>

<p>"He's quite all right. He was only knocked out. Better take him
to the colonel. He may be a spy."</p>

<p>The other came up, and touched his shoulder, and remarked:</p>

<p>"Can you walk, uncle?"</p>

<p>He replied:</p>

<p>"Ay, I can walk all right."</p>

<p>"That's an old sport!"</p>

<p>The young man took his arm and helped him out of the room, into
a courtyard. They entered another room, where an elderly,
kind-faced officer was seated at a desk. The officer looked up, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Good God! Bradshaw, do you know who you've got there?"</p>

<p>The younger one said, "No. Who, sir?"</p>

<p>"By God! it's Paul Jouperts!" exclaimed the colonel.</p>

<p>"Paul Jouperts! Great Scott!"</p>

<p>The older officer addressed himself to Sam. He said:</p>

<p>"Well, we've got you once more, Paul. We shall have to be a
little more careful this time."</p>

<p>The young officer said:</p>

<p>"Shall I detail a squad, sir?"</p>

<p>"We can't shoot him without a court-martial," replied the
kind-faced senior.</p>

<p>Then Sam interpolated:</p>

<p>"Look'ee, here, sir. I'm fair sick of all this. My name bean't
Paul. My name's Sam. I was a-thinnin' a line of tarnips&mdash;"</p>

<p>Both officers burst out laughing, and the younger one said:</p>

<p>"Good! damn good! Isn't it amazing, sir, the way they not only
learn the language, but even take the trouble to learn a
dialect?"</p>

<p>The older man busied himself with some papers.</p>

<p>"Well, Sam," he remarked, "you shall be given a chance to prove
your identity. Our methods are less drastic than those of your
Boche masters. What part of England are you supposed to come from?
Let's see how much you can bluff us with your topographical
knowledge."</p>

<p>"Oi was a-thinnin' a loine o' tarnips this morning at 'alf-past
seven on Mr. Dodge's farm at Halvesham, when one o' these 'ere
airyplanes come roight down among the swedes. I tells e' to get
clear o' that, when the feller gets out o' the car, 'e drahs a
revowlver and e' says, 'You must 'company&mdash;I&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," interrupted the senior officer; "that's all very
good. Now, tell me&mdash;Where is Halvesham? What is the name of
the local vicar? I'm sure you'd know that."</p>

<p>Old Sam rubbed his chin.</p>

<p>"I sits under the Reverend David Pryce, mister, and a good
God-fearin' man he be. I took him a cookin' o' runner beans only
yesterday. I works for Mr. Dodge what owns Greenway Manor and 'as a
stud farm at Newmarket they say."</p>

<p>"Charles Dodge?" asked the younger officer.</p>

<p>"Ay, Charlie Dodge. You write and ask 'un if he knows old Sam
Gates."</p>

<p>The two officers looked at each other, and the older one looked
at Sam more closely.</p>

<p>"It's very extraordinary," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Everybody knows Charlie Dodge," added the younger officer.</p>

<p>It was at that moment that a wave of genius swept over old Sam.
He put his hand to his head, and suddenly jerked out:</p>

<p>"What's more, I can tell 'ee where this yere Paul is. He's
acting a gardener in a convent at&mdash;"</p>

<p>He puckered up his brow and fumbled with his hat, and then got
out:</p>

<p>"Mighteno."</p>

<p>The older officer gasped:</p>

<p>"Mailleton-en-haut! Good God! What makes you say that, old
man?"</p>

<p>Sam tried to give an account of his experience, and the things
he had heard said by the German officers. But he was getting tired,
and he broke off in the middle to say:</p>

<p>"Ye haven't a bite o' somethin' to eat, I suppose, mister, and a
glass o' beer? I usually 'as my dinner at twelve o'clock."</p>

<p>Both the officers laughed, and the older said:</p>

<p>"Get him some food, Bradshaw, and a bottle of beer from the
mess. We'll keep this old man here. He interests me."</p>

<p>While the younger man was doing this, the chief pressed a button
and summoned another junior officer.</p>

<p>"Gateshead," he remarked, "ring up G.H.Q. and instruct them to
arrest the gardener in that convent at the top of the hill, and
then to report."</p>

<p>The officer saluted and went out, and in a few minutes a tray of
hot food and a large bottle of beer was brought to the old man, and
he was left alone in the corner of the room to negotiate this
welcome compensation. And in the execution he did himself and his
county credit. In the meanwhile the officers were very busy. People
were coming and going and examining maps and telephone-bells were
ringing furiously. They did not disturb old Sam's gastronomic
operations. He cleaned up the mess tins and finished the last drop
of beer. The senior officer found time to offer him a cigarette,
but he replied:</p>

<p>"Thank'ee kindly, but I'd rather smoke my pipe."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right. Smoke away."</p>

<p>He lighted up, and the fumes of the shag permeated the room.
Someone opened another window, and the young officer who had
addressed him at first suddenly looked at him and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Innocent, by God! You couldn't get snag like that anywhere but
in Norfolk."</p>

<p>It must have been over an hour later when another officer
entered, and saluted.</p>

<p>"Message from G.H.Q., sir," he said.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"They have arrested the gardener at the convent of St. Eloise,
and they have every reason to believe that he is the notorious Paul
Jouperts."</p>

<p>The colonel stood up, and his eyes beamed. He came over to old
Sam and shook his hand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gates," he said, "you are an old brick. You will probably
hear more of this. You have probably been the means of delivering
something very useful into our hands. Your own honour is
vindicated. A loving government will probably award you five
shillings or a Victoria Cross, or something of that sort. In the
meantime, what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>Old Sam scratched his chin.</p>

<p>"Oi want to get back 'ome," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, even that might be arranged."</p>

<p>"Oi want to get back 'ome in toime for tea."</p>

<p>"What time do you have tea?"</p>

<p>"Foive o'clock or thereabouts."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>A kindly smile came into the eyes of the colonel. He turned to
another officer standing by the table, and said:</p>

<p>"Raikes, is anyone going across this afternoon with
despatches?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the other officer. "Commander Jennings is
leaving at three o'clock."</p>

<p>"You might ask him to come and see me."</p>

<p>Within ten minutes a young man in a flight-commander's uniform
entered.</p>

<p>"Ah, Jennings," said the colonel, "here is a little affair which
concerns the honour of the British army. My friend here, Sam Gates,
has come over from Halvesham in Norfolk in order to give us
valuable information. I have promised him that he shall get home to
tea at five o'clock. Can you take a passenger?"</p>

<p>The young man threw back his head and laughed.</p>

<p>"Lord!" he exclaimed. "What an old sport! Yes, I expect I could
just manage it. Where is the Godforsaken place?"</p>

<p>A large ordnance-map of Norfolk (which had been captured from a
German officer) was produced, and the young man studied it
closely.</p>

<p>At three o'clock precisely old Sam, finding himself something of
a hero and quite glad to escape from the embarrassment which this
position entailed, once more sped skywards in an "airyplane."</p>

<p>At twenty minutes to five he landed once more amongst Mr.
Dodge's swedes. The breezy young airman shook hands with him and
departed inland. Old Sam sat down and surveyed the field.</p>

<p>"A noice thing, I must say," he muttered to himself, as he
looked along the lines of unthinned turnips. He still had twenty
minutes, and so he went slowly along and completed a line which he
had commenced in the morning. He then deliberately packed up his
dinner-things and his tools, and started out for home.</p>

<p>As he came round the corner of Stillway's Meadow, and the
cottage came in view, his niece stepped out of the copse with a
basket on her arm.</p>

<p>"Well, Uncle," she said, "is there any noos?"</p>

<p>It was then that old Sam became really irritated.</p>

<p>"Noos!" he said. "Noos! drat the girl! What noos should there
be? Sixty-nine year I live in these here parts, hoein' and weedin'
and thinnin' and mindin' Charlie Dodge's sheep. Am I one o' these
here story-book folk havin' noos 'appen to me all the time? Ain't
it enough, ye silly dab-faced zany, to earn enough to buy a bite o'
some'at to eat, and a glass o' beer, and a place to rest a's head
o'night, without always wantin' noos, noos, noos! I tell 'ee, it's
this that leads 'ee to 'alf the troubles in the world. Devil take
the noos!"</p>

<p>And turning his back on her, he went fuming up the hill.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch06" id="ch06"></a>6. MISS BRACEGIRDLE DOES HER
DUTY</h2>

<p>"This is the room, madame."</p>

<p>"Ah, thank you...thank you."</p>

<p>"Does it appear satisfactory to madame?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, thank you...quite."</p>

<p>"Does madame require anything further?"</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;if not too late, may I have a hot bath?"</p>

<p>"<i>Parfaitement</i>, madame. The bathroom is at the end of the
passage on the left. I will go and prepare it for madame."</p>

<p>"There is one thing more...I have had a very long journey. I am
very tired. Will you please see that I am not disturbed in the
morning until I ring."</p>

<p>"Certainly, madame."</p>

<p>Millicent Bracegirdle was speaking the truth&mdash;she
<i>was</i> tired. In the sleepy cathedral town of Easingstoke, from
which she came, it was customary for everyone to speak the truth.
It was customary, moreover, for everyone to lead simple,
self-denying lives&mdash;to give up their time to good works and
elevating thoughts. One had only to glance at little Miss
Bracegirdle to see that in her was epitomized all the virtues and
ideals of Easingstoke. Indeed, it was the pursuit of duty which had
brought her to the Hotel de l'Oest at Bordeaux on this summer's
night. She had travelled from Easingstoke to London, then without a
break to Dover, crossed that horrid stretch of sea to Calais,
entrained for Paris, where she of necessity had to spend four
hours&mdash;a terrifying experience&mdash;and then had come on to
Bordeaux, arriving at midnight. The reason of this journey being
that some one had to come to Bordeaux to meet her young
sister-in-law, who was arriving the next day from South America.
The sister-in-law was married to a missionary in Paraguay, but the
climate not agreeing with her, she was returning to England. Her
dear brother, the dean, would have come himself, but the claims on
his time were so extensive, the parishioners would miss him so...it
was clearly Millicent's duty to go.</p>

<p>She had never been out of England before, and she had a horror
of travel, and an ingrained distrust of foreigners. She spoke a
little French&mdash;sufficient for the purposes of travel and for
obtaining any modest necessities, but not sufficient for carrying
on any kind of conversation. She did not deplore this latter fact,
for she was of opinion that French people were not the kind of
people that one would naturally want to have conversation with;
broadly speaking, they were not quite "nice," in spite of their
ingratiating manners.</p>

<p>The dear dean had given her endless advice, warning her
earnestly not to enter into conversation with strangers, to obtain
all information from the police, railway officials&mdash;in fact,
any one in an official uniform. He deeply regretted to say that he
was afraid that France was not a country for a woman to travel
about in <i>alone</i>. There were loose, bad people about, always
on the lookout...He really thought perhaps he ought not to let her
go. It was only by the utmost persuasion, in which she rather
exaggerated her knowledge of the French language and character, her
courage, and indifference to discomfort, that she managed to carry
the day.</p>

<p>She unpacked her valise, placed her things about the room, tried
to thrust back the little stabs of homesickness as she visualized
her darling room at the deanery. How strange and hard and
unfriendly seemed these foreign hotel bedrooms&mdash;heavy and
depressing, no chintz and lavender and photographs of...all the
dear family, the dean, the nephews and nieces, the interior of the
cathedral during harvest festival, no samplers and needlework or
coloured reproductions of the paintings by Marcus Stone. Oh dear,
how foolish she was! What did she expect?</p>

<p>She disrobed and donned a dressing-gown; then, armed with a
sponge-bag and towel, she crept timidly down the passage to the
bathroom, after closing her bedroom door and turning out the light.
The gay bathroom cheered her. She wallowed luxuriously in the hot
water, regarding her slim legs with quiet satisfaction. And for the
first time since leaving home there came to her a pleasant
moment&mdash;a sense of enjoyment in her adventure. After all, it
<i>was</i> rather an adventure, and her life had been peculiarly
devoid of it. What queer lives some people must live, travelling
about, having experiences! How old was she? Not really
old&mdash;not by any means. Forty-two? Forty-three? She had shut
herself up so. She hardly ever regarded the potentialities of age.
As the world went, she was a well-preserved woman for her age. A
life of self-abnegation, simple living, healthy walking and fresh
air, had kept her younger than these hurrying, pampered city
people.</p>

<p>Love? yes, once when she was a young girl...he was a
schoolmaster, a most estimable kind gentleman. They were never
engaged&mdash;not actually, but it was a kind of understood thing.
For three years it went on, this pleasant understanding and
friendship. He was so gentle, so distinguished and considerate. She
would have been happy to have continued in this strain for ever.
But there was something lacking. Stephen had curious restless
lapses. From the physical aspect of marriage she shrunk&mdash;yea,
even with Stephen, who was gentleness and kindness itself. And then
one day...one day he went away&mdash;vanished, and never returned.
They told her he had married one of the country girls&mdash;a girl
who used to work in Mrs. Forbes's dairy&mdash;not a very nice girl,
she feared, one of these fast, pretty, foolish women. Heigho! well,
she had lived that down, destructive as the blow appeared at the
time. One lives everything down in time. There is always work,
living for others, faith, duty...At the same time she could
sympathize with people who found satisfaction in unusual
experiences.</p>

<p>There would be lots to tell the dear dean when she wrote to him
on the morrow&mdash;nearly losing her spectacles on the restaurant
car; the amusing remarks of an American child on the train to
Paris; the curious food everywhere, nothing simple and plain; the
two English ladies at the hotel in Paris who told her about the
death of their uncle&mdash;the poor man being taken ill on Friday
and dying on Sunday afternoon, just before tea-time; the kindness
of the hotel proprietor who had sat up for her; the prettiness of
the chambermaid. Oh, yes, everyone was really very kind. The French
people, after all, were very nice. She had seen
nothing&mdash;nothing but was quite nice and decorous. There would
be lots to tell the dean to-morrow.</p>

<p>Her body glowed with the friction of the towel. She again donned
her night attire and her thick, woollen dressing-gown. She tidied
up the bathroom carefully in exactly the same way she was
accustomed to do at home, then once more gripping her sponge-bag
and towel, and turning out the light, she crept down the passage to
her room. Entering the room she switched on the light and shut the
door quickly. Then one of those ridiculous things
happened&mdash;just the kind of thing you would expect to happen in
a foreign hotel. The handle of the door came off in her hand.</p>

<p>She ejaculated a quiet "Bother!" and sought to replace it with
one hand, the other being occupied with the towel and sponge-bag.
In doing this she behaved foolishly, for thrusting the knob
carelessly against the steel pin&mdash;without properly securing
it&mdash;she only succeeded in pushing the pin farther into the
door and the knob was not adjusted. She uttered another little
"Bother" and put her sponge-bag and towel down on the floor. She
then tried to recover the pin with her left hand, but it had gone
in too far.</p>

<p>"How very foolish!" she thought, "I shall have to ring for the
chambermaid&mdash;and perhaps the poor girl has gone to bed."</p>

<p>She turned and faced the room, and suddenly the awful horror was
upon her. <i>There was a man asleep in her bed!</i></p>

<p>The sight of that swarthy face on the pillow, with its black
tousled hair and heavy moustache, produced in her the most terrible
moment of her life. Her heart nearly stopped. For some seconds she
could neither think nor scream, and her first thought was&mdash;"I
mustn't scream!"</p>

<p>She stood there like one paralyzed, staring at the man's head
and the great curved hunch of his body under the clothes. When she
began to think she thought very quickly, and all her thoughts
worked together. The first vivid realization was that it wasn't the
man's fault; it was <i>her</i> fault. <i>She was in the wrong
room.</i> It was the Man's room. The rooms were identical, but
there were all his things about, his clothes thrown carelessly over
chairs, his collar and tie on the wardrobe, his great heavy boots
and the strange yellow trunk. She must get out somehow, anyhow.</p>

<p>She clutched once more at the door, feverishly driving her
finger-nails into the hole where the elusive pin had vanished. She
tried to force her fingers in the crack and open the door that way,
but it was of no avail. She was to all intents and purposes locked
in&mdash;locked in a bedroom in a strange hotel alone with a
man...a foreigner...<i>a Frenchman</i>! She must think. She must
think...She switched off the light. If the light was off he might
not wake up. It might give her time to think how to act. It was
surprising that he had not awakened. If he <i>did</i> wake up what
would he do? How could she explain herself? He wouldn't believe
her. No one would believe her. In an English hotel it would be
difficult enough, but here where she wasn't known, where they were
all foreigners and consequently antagonistic...merciful
heavens!</p>

<p>She <i>must</i> get out. Should she wake the man? No, she
couldn't do that. He might murder her. He might...Oh, it was to
awful to contemplate! Should she scream? ring for the chambermaid?
But no, it would be the same thing. People would come rushing. They
would find her there in the strange man's bedroom after
midnight&mdash;she Millicent Bracegirdle, sister of the Dean of
Easingstoke! Easingstoke!</p>

<p>Visions of Easingstoke flashed through her alarmed mind. Visions
of the news arriving, women whispering around tea-tables: "Have you
heard, my dear?...Really no one would have imagined! Her poor
brother! He will of course have to resign, you know, my dear. Have
a little more cream, my love."</p>

<p>Would they put her in prison? She might be in the room for the
purpose of stealing or...She might be in the room for the purpose
of breaking every one of the ten commandments. There was no
explaining it away. She was a ruined woman, suddenly and
irretrievably, unless she could open the door. The chimney? Should
she climb up the chimney? But where would that lead to? And then
she visualized the man pulling her down by her legs when she was
already smothered in soot. Any moment he might wake up...</p>

<p>She thought she heard the chambermaid going along the passage.
If she had wanted to scream, she ought to have screamed before. The
maid would know she had left the bathroom some minutes ago. Was she
going to her room? Suddenly she remembered that she had told the
chambermaid that she was not to be disturbed until she rang the
next morning. That was something. Nobody would be going to her room
to find out that she was not there.</p>

<p>An abrupt and desperate plan formed in her mind. It was already
getting on for one o'clock. The man was probably a quite harmless
commercial traveller or business man. He would probably get up
about seven or eight o'clock, dress quickly and go out. She would
hide under his bed until he went. Only a matter of a few hours. Men
don't look under their beds, although she made a religious practice
of doing so herself. When he went he would be sure to open the door
all right. The handle would be lying on the floor as though it had
dropped off in the night. He would probably ring for the
chambermaid or open it with a penknife. Men were so clever at those
things. When he had gone she would creep out and steal back to her
room, and then there would be no necessity to give any explanation
to anyone. But heavens! What an experience! Once under the white
frill of that bed she would be safe till the morning. In daylight
nothing seemed so terrifying.</p>

<p>With feline precaution she went down on her hands and knees and
crept toward the bed. What a lucky thing there was that broad white
frill! She lifted it at the foot of the bed and crept under. There
was just sufficient depth to take her slim body. The floor was
fortunately carpeted all over, but it seemed very close and dusty.
Suppose she coughed or sneezed! Anything might happen. Of
course...it would be much more difficult to explain her presence
under the bed than to explain her presence just inside the door.
She held her breath in suspense. No sound came from above, but
under this frill it was difficult to hear anything. It was almost
more nerve-racking than hearing everything...listening for signs
and portents. This temporary escape in any case would give her time
to regard the predicament detachedly. Up to the present she had not
been able to visualize the full significance of her action. She had
in truth lost her head. She had been like a wild animal, consumed
with the sole idea of escape...a mouse or a cat would do this kind
of thing&mdash;take cover and lie low. If only it hadn't all
happened <i>abroad</i>! She tried to frame sentences of explanation
in French, but French escaped her. And then&mdash;they talked so
rapidly, these people. They didn't listen. The situation was
intolerable. Would she be able to endure a night of it?</p>

<p>At present she was not altogether uncomfortable, only stuffy
and...very, very frightened. But she had to face six or seven or
eight hours of it&mdash;perhaps even then discovery in the end! The
minutes flashed by as she turned the matter over and over in her
head. There was no solution. She began to wish she had screamed or
awakened the man. She saw now that that would have been the wisest
and most politic thing to do; but she had allowed ten minutes or a
quarter of an hour to elapse from the moment when the chambermaid
would know that she had left the bathroom. They would want an
explanation of what she had been doing in the man's bedroom all
that time. Why hadn't she screamed before?</p>

<p>She lifted the frill an inch or two and listened. She thought
she heard the man breathing but she couldn't be sure. In any case
it gave her more air. She became a little bolder, and thrust her
face partly through the frill so that she could breathe freely. She
tried to steady her nerves by concentrating on the fact
that&mdash;well, there it was. She had done it. She must make the
best of it. Perhaps it would be all right after all.</p>

<p>"Of course I shan't sleep," she kept on thinking, "I shan't be
able to. In any case it will be safer not to sleep. I must be on
the watch."</p>

<p>She set her teeth and waited grimly. Now that she had made up
her mind to see the thing through in this manner she felt a little
calmer. She almost smiled as she reflected that there would
certainly be something to tell the dear Dean when she wrote to him
to-morrow. How would he take it? Of course he would believe
it&mdash;he had never doubted a single word that she had uttered in
her life, but the story would sound so...preposterous. In
Easingstoke it would be almost impossible to envisage such an
experience. She, Millicent Bracegirdle, spending a night under a
strange man's bed in a foreign hotel! What would those women think?
Fanny Shields and that garrulous old Mrs. Rusbridger?
Perhaps...yes, perhaps it would be advisable to tell the dear Dean
to let the story go no further. One could hardly expect Mrs.
Rushbridger to...not make implications...exaggerate.</p>

<p>Oh dear! What were they all doing now? They would all be asleep,
everyone in Easingstoke. Her dear brother always retired at
ten-fifteen. He would be sleeping calmly and placidly, the sleep of
the just...breathing the clear sweet air of Sussex, not
this&mdash;Oh, it <i>was</i> stuffy! She felt a great desire to
cough. She mustn't do that. Yes, at nine-thirty all the servants
summoned to the library&mdash;a short service&mdash;never more than
fifteen minutes, her brother didn't believe in a great deal of
ritual&mdash;then at ten o'clock cocoa for everyone. At ten-fifteen
bed for everyone. The dear sweet bedroom with the narrow white bed,
by the side of which she had knelt every night as long as she could
remember&mdash;even in her dear mother's day&mdash;and said her
prayers.</p>

<p>Prayers! Yes, that was a curious thing. This was the first night
in her life's experience that she had not said her prayers on
retiring. The situation was certainly very peculiar...exceptional,
one might call it. God would understand and forgive such a lapse.
And yet after all, why...what was to prevent her saying her
prayers? Of course she couldn't kneel in the proper devotional
attitude, that would be a physical impossibility, nevertheless,
perhaps her prayers might be just as efficacious...if they came
from the heart. So little Miss Bracegirdle curved her body and
placed her hands in a devout attitude in front of her face and
quite inaudibly murmured her prayers under the strange man's
bed.</p>

<p>"Our Father which art in heaven; hallowed be Thy name; Thy
kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven;
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our
trespasses..."</p>

<p>Trespasses! Yes, surely she was trespassing on this occasion,
but God would understand. She had not wanted to trespass. She was
an unwitting sinner. Without uttering a sound she went through her
usual prayers in her heart. At the end she added fervently:</p>

<p>"Please God protect me from the dangers and perils of this
night."</p>

<p>Then she lay silent and inert, strangely soothed by the effort
of praying. "After all," she thought, "it isn't the attitude which
matters&mdash;it is that which occurs deep down in us."</p>

<p>For the first time she began to meditate&mdash;almost to
question&mdash;church forms and dogma. If an attitude was not
indispensable why&mdash;a building, a ritual, a church at all? Of
course her dear brother couldn't be wrong, the church was so old,
so very old, its root deep buried in the story of human life, it
was only that...well, outward forms <i>could</i> be misleading. Her
own present position for instance. In the eyes of the world she
had, by one silly careless little action, convicted herself of
being the breaker of every single one of the ten commandments.</p>

<p>She tried to think of one of which she could not be accused. But
no&mdash;even to dishonouring her father and mother, bearing false
witness, stealing, coveting her neighbour's...husband! That was the
worst thing of all. Poor man! He might be a very pleasant
honourable married gentleman with children and she&mdash;she was in
a position to compromise him! Why hadn't she screamed! Too late!
Too late!</p>

<p>It began to get very uncomfortable, stuffy, but at the same time
draughty, and the floor was getting harder every minute. She
changed her position stealthily and controlled her desire to cough.
Her heart was beating rapidly. Over and over again recurred the
vivid impression of every little incident and argument that had
occurred to her from the moment she left the bathroom. This must,
of course, be the room next to her own. So confusing with perhaps
twenty bedrooms all exactly alike on one side of a
passage&mdash;how was one to remember whether one's number was 115
or 116?</p>

<p>Her mind began to wander idly off into her schooldays. She was
always very bad at figures. She disliked Euclid and all those
subjects about angles and equations&mdash;so unimportant, not
leading anywhere. History she liked, and botany, and reading about
strange foreign lands, although she had always been too timid to
visit them. And the lives of great people, <i>most</i>
fascinating&mdash;Oliver Cromwell, Lord Beaconsfield, Lincoln,
Grace Darling&mdash;<i>there</i> was a heroine for
you&mdash;General Booth, a great good man, even if a little vulgar.
She remembered dear old Miss Trimming talking about him one
afternoon at the vicar of St. Bride's garden party. She was so
amusing. She...<i>Good heavens!</i></p>

<p><i>Almost unwittingly, Millicent Bracegirdle had emitted a
violent sneeze!</i>
</p>

<p>It was finished! For the second time that night she was
conscious of her heart nearly stopping. For the second time that
night she was so paralyzed with fear that her mentality went to
pieces. Now she would hear the man get out of bed. He would walk
across to the door, switch on the light, and then lift up the
frill. She could almost see that fierce moustached face glaring at
her and growling something in French. Then he would thrust out an
arm and drag her out. And then? O God in heaven! What then?...</p>

<p>"I shall scream before he does it. Perhaps I had better scream
now. If he drags me out he will clap his hand over my mouth.
Perhaps chloroform..."</p>

<p>But somehow she could not scream. She was too frightened even
for that. She lifted the frill and listened. Was he moving
stealthily across the carpet? She thought&mdash;no, she couldn't be
sure. Anything might be happening. He might strike her from
above&mdash;with one of those heavy boots perhaps. Nothing seemed
to be happening, but the suspense was intolerable. She realized now
that she hadn't the power to endure a night of it. Anything would
be better than this&mdash;disgrace, imprisonment, even death. She
would crawl out, wake the man, and try and explain as best she
could.</p>

<p>She would switch on the light, cough, and say:
"<i>Monsieur!</i>"</p>

<p>Then he would start up and stare at her.</p>

<p>Then she would say&mdash;what should she say?</p>

<p>"<i>Pardon, monsieur, mais je</i>&mdash;" What on earth was the
French for "I have made a mistake?"</p>

<p>"<i>J'ai tort. C'est la chambre</i>&mdash;er&mdash;incorrect.
<i>Voulezvous</i>&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>What was the French for "door-knob," "let me go?"</p>

<p>It didn't matter. She would turn on the light, cough and trust
to luck. If he got out of bed, and came toward her, she would
scream the hotel down...</p>

<p>The resolution formed, she crawled deliberately out at the foot
of the bed. She scrambled hastily toward the door&mdash;a perilous
journey. In a few seconds the room was flooded with light. She
turned toward the bed, coughed, and cried out boldly:</p>

<p>"<i>Monsieur!</i>"</p>

<p>Then, for the third time that night, little Miss Bracegirdle's
heart all but stopped. In this case the climax of the horror took
longer to develop, but when it was reached, it clouded the other
two experiences into insignificance.</p>

<p><i>The man on the bed was dead!</i>
</p>

<p>She had never beheld death before, but one does not mistake
death.</p>

<p>She stared at him bewildered, and repeated almost in a
whisper:</p>

<p>"<i>Monsieur!...Monsieur!</i>"</p>

<p>Then she tiptoed toward the bed. The hair and moustache looked
extraordinarily black in that grey wax-like setting. The mouth was
slightly open, and the face, which in life might have been vicious
and sensual, looked incredibly peaceful and far away.</p>

<p>It was as though she were regarding the features of a man across
some vast passage of time, a being who had always been completely
remote from mundane preoccupations.</p>

<p>When the full truth came home to her, little Miss Bracegirdle
buried her face in her hands and murmured:</p>

<p>"Poor fellow...poor fellow!"</p>

<p>For the moment her own position seemed an affair of small
consequence. She was in the presence of something greater and more
all pervading. Almost instinctively she knelt by the bed and
prayed.</p>

<p>For a few moments she seemed to be possessed by an extraordinary
calmness and detachment. The burden of her hotel predicament was a
gossamer trouble&mdash;a silly, trivial, almost comic episode,
something that could be explained away.</p>

<p>But this man&mdash;he had lived his life, whatever it was like,
and now he was in the presence of his Maker. What kind of man had
he been?</p>

<p>Her meditations were broken by an abrupt sound. It was that of a
pair of heavy boots being thrown down by the door outside. She
started, thinking at first it was someone knocking or trying to get
in. She heard the "boots," however, stamping away down the
corridor, and the realisation stabbed her with the truth of her own
position. She mustn't stop there. The necessity to get out was even
more urgent.</p>

<p>To be found in a strange man's bedroom in the night is bad
enough, but to be found in a dead man's bedroom was even worse.
They would accuse her of murder, perhaps. Yes, that would be
it&mdash;how could she possibly explain to these foreigners? Good
God! they would hang her. No, guillotine her, that's what they do
in France. They would chop her head off with a great steel knife.
Merciful heavens! She envisaged herself standing, blindfold by a
priest and an executioner in a red cap, like that man in the
Dicken's story&mdash;what was his name?...Sydney Carton, that was
it, and before he went on the scaffold he said:</p>

<p>"It is a far, far better thing that I do than I have ever
done."</p>

<p>But no, she couldn't say that. It would be a far, far worse
thing that she did. What about the dear Dean? Her sister-in-law
arriving alone from Paraguay to-morrow? All her dear people and
friends in Easingstoke? Her darling Tony, the large grey tabby cat?
It was her duty not to have her head chopped off if it could
possibly be avoided. She could do no good in the room. She could
not recall the dead to life. Her only mission was to escape. Any
minute people might arrive. The chambermaid, the boots, the
manager, the gendarmes...Visions of gendarmes arriving armed with
swords and note-books vitalised her almost exhausted energies. She
was a desperate woman. Fortunately now she had not to worry about
the light. She sprang once more at the door and tried to force it
open with her fingers. The result hurt her and gave her pause. If
she was to escape she must <i>think</i>, and think intensely. She
mustn't do anything rash and silly, she must just think and plan
calmly.</p>

<p>She examined the lock carefully. There was no keyhole, but there
was a slip-bolt, so that the hotel guest could lock the door on the
inside, but it couldn't be locked on the outside. Oh, why didn't
this poor dead man lock his door last night? Then this trouble
could not have happened. She could see the end of the steel pin. It
was about half an inch down the hole. If any one was passing they
must surely notice the handle sticking out too far the other side!
She drew a hairpin out of her hair and tried to coax the pin back,
but she only succeeded in pushing it a little farther in. She felt
the colour leaving her face, and a strange feeling of faintness
come over her.</p>

<p>She was fighting for her life, she mustn't give way. She darted
round the room like an animal in a trap, her mind alert for the
slightest crevice of escape. The window had no balcony and there
was a drop of five stories to the street below. Dawn was breaking.
Soon the activities of the hotel and the city would begin. The
thing must be accomplished before then.</p>

<p>She went back once more and stared at the lock. She stared at
the dead man's property, his razors, and brushes, and writing
materials. He appeared to have a lot of writing materials, pens and
pencils and rubber and sealing-wax....Sealing-wax!</p>

<p>Necessity is truly the mother of invention. It is in any case
quite certain that Millicent Bracegirdle, who had never invented a
thing in her life, would never have evolved the ingenious little
device she did, had she not believed that her position was utterly
desperate. For in the end this is what she did. She got together a
box of matches, a candle, a bar of sealing-wax, and a hair pin. She
made a little pool of hot sealing-wax, into which she dipped the
end of the hairpin. Collecting a small blob on the end of it she
thrust it into the hole, and let it adhere to the end of the steel
pin. At the seventh attempt she got the thing to move. It took her
just an hour and ten minutes to get that steel pin back into the
room, and when at length it came far enough through for her to grip
it with her finger-nails, she burst into tears through the sheer
physical tension of the strain. Very, very carefully she pulled it
through and holding it firmly with her left hand she fixed the knob
with her right, then slowly turned it. The door opened!</p>

<p>The temptation to dash out into the corridor and scream with
relief was almost irresistible, but she forbore. She listened; she
peeped out. No one was about. With beating heart, she went out,
closing the door inaudibly. She crept like a little mouse to the
room next door, stole in and flung herself on her bed. Immediately
she did so it flashed through her mind that <i>she had left her
sponge-bag and towel in the dead man's room</i>!</p>

<p>In looking back upon her experience she always considered that
that second expedition was the worst of all. She might have left
the sponge-bag and towel there, only that the towel&mdash;she never
used hotel towels&mdash;had neatly inscribed in the corner
"M.B."</p>

<p>With furtive caution she managed to retrace her steps. She
re-entered the dead man's room, reclaimed her property and returned
to her own. When this mission was accomplished she was indeed
well-nigh spent. She lay on her bed and groaned feebly. At last she
fell into a fevered sleep...</p>

<p>It was eleven o'clock when she awoke and no one had been to
disturb her. The sun was shining, and the experiences of the night
appeared a dubious nightmare. Surely she had dreamt it all?</p>

<p>With dread still burning in her heart she rang the bell. After a
short interval of time the chambermaid appeared. The girl's eyes
were bright with some uncontrollable excitement. No, she had not
been dreaming. This girl had heard something.</p>

<p>"Will you bring me some tea, please?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, madame."</p>

<p>The maid drew back the curtains and fussed about the room. She
was under a pledge of secrecy but she could contain herself no
longer. Suddenly she approached the bed and whispered
excitedly:</p>

<p>"Oh, madame, I have promised not to tell...but a terrible thing
has happened. A man, a dead man, has been found in room 117&mdash;a
guest. Please not to say I tell you. But they have all been there,
the gendarmes, the doctors, the inspectors. Oh, it is
terrible...terrible."</p>

<p>The little lady in the bed said nothing. There was indeed
nothing to say. But Marie Louise Laucrat was too full of emotional
excitement to spare her.</p>

<p>"But the terrible thing is...Do you know who he was, madame?
They say it is Boldhu, the man wanted for the murder of Jean
Carreton in the barn at Vincennes. They say he strangled her, and
then cut her up in pieces and hid her in two barrels which he threw
into the river...Oh, but he was a bad man, madame, a terrible bad
man...and he died in the room next door...suicide they think or was
it an attack of the heart?...Remorse, some shock perhaps...Did you
say a <i>caf&eacute; complet</i>, madame?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you, my dear...just a cup of tea...strong tea..."</p>

<p>"<i>Parfaitement</i>, madame."</p>

<p>The girl retired, and a little later a waiter entered the room
with a tray of tea. She could never get over her surprise in this.
It seemed so&mdash;well, indecorous for a man&mdash;although only a
waiter&mdash;to enter a lady's bedroom. There was no doubt a great
deal in what the dear Dean said. They were certainly very peculiar,
these French people&mdash;they had most peculiar notions. It was
not the way they behaved at Easingstoke. She got farther under the
sheets, but the waiter appeared quite indifferent to the situation.
He put the tray down and retired.</p>

<p>When he had gone she sat up and sipped her tea, which gradually
warmed her. She was glad the sun was shining. She would have to get
up soon. They said that her sister-in-law's boat was due to berth
at one o'clock. That would give her time to dress comfortably,
write to her brother, and then go down to the docks. Poor man! So
he had been a murderer, a man who cut up the bodies of his
victims...and she had spent the night in his bedroom! They were
certainly a most&mdash;how could she describe it?&mdash;people.
Nevertheless she felt a little glad that at the end she had been
there to kneel and pray by his bedside. Probably nobody else had
ever done that. It was very difficult to judge people...Something
at some time might have gone wrong. He might not have murdered the
woman after all. People were often wrongly convicted. She
herself...If the police had found her in that room at three o'clock
that morning...It is that which takes place in the heart which
counts. One learns and learns. Had she not learnt that one can pray
just as effectively lying under a bed as kneeling beside it?...Poor
man!</p>

<p>She washed and dressed herself and walked calmly down to the
writing-room. There was no evidence of excitement among the other
hotel guests. Probably none of them knew about the tragedy except
herself. She went to a writing table, and after profound meditation
wrote as follows:</p>

<p class="letter">My dear Brother,<br>
<br>
"I arrived late last night after a very pleasant journey. Everyone
was very kind and attentive, the manager was sitting up for me. I
nearly lost my spectacle case in the restaurant car! But a kind old
gentleman found it and returned it to me. There was a most amusing
American child on the train. I will tell you about her on my
return. The people are very pleasant, but the food is peculiar,
nothing <i>plain and wholesome</i>. I am going down to meet Annie
at one o'clock. How have you been keeping, my dear? I hope you have
not had any further return of the bronchial attacks.<br>
<br>
"Please tell Lizzie that I remembered in the train on the way here
that that large stone jar of marmalade that Mrs. Hunt made is
behind those empty tins in the top shelf of the cupboard next to
the coach house. I wonder whether Mrs. Butler was able to come to
evensong after all? This is a nice hotel, but I think Annie and I
will stay at the 'Grand' to-night, as the bedrooms here are rather
noisy. Well, my dear, nothing more till I return. Do take care of
yourself.&mdash;Your loving sister,<br>
<br>
Millicent."</p>

<p>Yes, she couldn't tell Peter about it, neither in the letter nor
when she went back to him. It was her duty not to tell him. It
would only distress him; she felt convinced of it. In this curious
foreign atmosphere the thing appeared possible, but in Easingstoke
the mere recounting of the fantastic situations would be
positively...indelicate. There was no escaping that broad general
fact&mdash;she had spent a night in a strange man's bedroom.
Whether he was a gentleman or a criminal, even whether he was dead
or alive, did not seem to mitigate the jar upon her sensibilities,
or rather it would not mitigate the jar upon the peculiarly
sensitive relationship between her brother and herself. To say that
she had been to the bathroom, the knob of the door-handle came off
in her hand, she was too frightened to awaken the sleeper or
scream, she got under the bed&mdash;well, it was all perfectly
true. Peter would believe her, but&mdash;one simply could not
conceive such a situation in Easingstoke deanery. It would create a
curious little barrier between them, as though she had been dipped
in some mysterious solution which alienated her. It was her duty
not to tell.</p>

<p>She put on her hat, and went out to post the letter. She
distrusted an hotel letter-box. One never knew who handled these
letters. It was not a proper official way of treating them. She
walked to the head post office in Bordeaux.</p>

<p>The sun was shining. It was very pleasant walking about amongst
these queer excitable people, so foreign and
different-looking&mdash;and the caf&eacute;s already crowded with
chattering men and women, and the flower stalls, and the strange
odour of&mdash;what was it? Salt? Brine? Charcoal?...A military
band was playing in the square...very gay and moving. It was all
life, and movement, and bustle...thrilling rather.</p>

<p>"I spent a night in a strange man's bedroom."</p>

<p>Little Miss Bracegirdle hunched her shoulders, murmured to
herself and walked faster. She reached the post office and found
the large metal plate with the slot for letters and "R.F." stamped
above it. Something official at last! Her face was a little
flushed&mdash;was it the warmth of the day or the contact of
movement and life?&mdash;as she put her letter into the slot. After
posting it she put her hand into the slot and flicked it round to
see that there were no foreign contraptions to impede its safe
delivery. No, the letter had dropped safely in. She sighed
contentedly and walked off in the direction of the docks to meet
her sister-in-law from Paraguay.</p>

<h2><a name="ch07" id="ch07"></a>7. THE ACCIDENT OF CRIME</h2>

<p>Every seaman who makes the city of Bordeaux a port of call knows
the Rue Lucien Faure. It is one of those irregular streets which
one finds in the neighbourhood of docks in every city in the world.
Cord wainers, ships stores, caf&eacute;s and strange foreign
eating-houses jostle each other indiscriminately. At the farther
end of the Rue Lucien Faure, and facing Bassin agrave; Flot No. 2,
is a little cul-de-sac known as Place Duquesne, an obscure
honeycomb of high dingy houses. It had often been pointed out to
the authorities that the Place Duquesne was a scandal to the
neighbourhood; not that the houses themselves were either better or
worse than those of adjoining streets, but that the inhabitants
belonged almost entirely to the criminal classes. A murderer, an
apache, a blackmailer, a coiner, hardly ever appeared in the Court
of Justice without his habitation being traced to this unsavoury
retreat.</p>

<p>And the authorities did nothing. Indeed, Chief Inspector
Tolozan, who had that neighbourhood under his special supervision,
said that he preferred it as it was. He affirmed&mdash;not
unreasonably&mdash;that it was better to have all one's birds in
one nest rather than have them scattered all over the wood.
Tolozan, although a practical man, was something of a visionary. He
was of that speculative turn of mind which revels in theories. The
contemplation of crime moved him in somewhat the same way that a
sunset will affect a landscape painter. He indulged in broad
generalities, and it always gave him a mild thrill of pleasure when
the actions or behaviour of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s
substantiated his theories.</p>

<p>In a detached way, he had quite an affection for his "birds," as
he called them. He knew their record, their characteristics, their
tendencies, their present occupation, if any, their place of
abode&mdash;which was generally the Place Duquesne. If old Carros,
the forger, moved from the attic in No. 17 to the basement in No.
11, Monsieur Tolozan would sense the reason of this change. And he
never interfered until the last minute. He allowed Carros to work
three months on that very ingenious plan for counterfeiting one
franc notes. He waited till the plates were quite complete before
he stepped in with his quiet:...</p>

<p>"Now, <i>mon brave</i>, it distresses me to interfere..."</p>

<p>He admired the plates enormously, and in the van on the way to
the police court he sighed many times, and ruminated upon what he
called "the accident of crime." One of his pet theories was that no
man was entirely criminal. Somewhere at some time it had all been
just touch and go. With better fortune the facile Carros might now
be the director of an insurance company, or perhaps an eminent
pianist. Another saying of his, which he was very fond of
repeating, was this:</p>

<p>"The law does not sit in judgment on people. Laws are only made
for the protection of the citizen."</p>

<p>His colleagues were inclined to laugh at "Papa Tolozan," as they
called him, but they were bound to respect his thoroughness and
conscientiousness, and they treated his passion for philosophic
speculation as merely the harmless eccentricity of an urbane and
charming character. Perhaps in this attitude toward crime there
have always been two schools of thought, the one which regards
it&mdash;like Tolozan&mdash;as "the accident," the other, as
represented by the forceful Muguet of the Council of Jurisprudence
at Bayonne, who insists that crime is an ineradicable trait, an
inheritance, a fate. In spite of their divergence of outlook these
two were great friends, and many and long were the arguments they
enjoyed over a glass of vermouth and seltzer at a quiet caf&eacute;
they sometimes favoured in the Cours du Pav&eacute;, when business
brought them together. Muguet would invariably clinch the argument
with a staccato:</p>

<p>"Well, come now, what about old Laissac?"</p>

<p>Then he would slap his leg and laugh. Here, indeed, was a hard
case. Here, indeed, was an irreconcilable, an <i>intransigeant</i>,
an ingrained criminal, and as this story principally concerns old
Laissac it may be as well to describe him a little in detail at
once. He was at that time fifty-seven years of age. Twenty-one
years and ten months of that period had been passed in
penitentiaries, prisons, and convict establishments. He was already
an old man, but a wiry, energetic old man, with a battered face
seamed by years of vicious dissipations and passions.</p>

<p>At the age of seventeen he had killed a Chinaman. The affair was
the outcome of a dockside <i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i>, and many
contended that Laissac was not altogether responsible. However that
may be, the examining magistrate at that time was of opinion that
there had been rather too much of that sort of thing of late, and
that an example must be made of someone. Even the Chink must be
allowed some show of protection. Laissac was sent to a penitentiary
for two years. He returned an avowed enemy of society. Since that
day, he had been convicted of burglary, larceny, passing of
counterfeit coins, assault, and drunkenness. These were only the
crimes of which he had actually been convicted, but everyone knew
that they were only an infinitesimal fraction of the crimes of
which he was guilty.</p>

<p>He was a cunning old man. He had bashed one of his pals and
maimed him for life, and the man was afraid to give evidence
against him. He had treated at least two women with almost
unspeakable cruelty. There was no record of his ever having done a
single action of kindliness or unselfishness. He had, moreover,
been a perverter and betrayer of others. He bred crime with
malicious enjoyment. He trained young men in the tricks of the
trade. He dealt in stolen property. He was a centre, a focus, of
criminal activity. One evening, Muguet remarked to Tolozan, as they
sipped their coffee:</p>

<p>"The law is too childish. That man has been working steadily all
his life to destroy and pervert society. He has a diseased mind.
Why aren't we allowed to do away with him? If, as you say, the laws
were made to protect citizens, there's only one way to protect
ourselves against a villain like Laissac&mdash;the guillotine."</p>

<p>Tolozan shook his head slowly. "No, the law only allows capital
punishment in the case of murder."</p>

<p>"I know that, my old cabbage. What I say is, why should society
bother to keep an old ruffian like that?"</p>

<p>Tolozan did not answer, and Muguet continued:</p>

<p>"Where is he now?"</p>

<p>"He lives in an attic in the Place Duquesne, No. 33."</p>

<p>"Are you watching him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"Been to call on him?"</p>

<p>"I was there yesterday."</p>

<p>"What was he doing?"</p>

<p>"Playing with a dog."</p>

<p>Muguet slapped his leg, and threw back his head. Playing with a
dog! That was excellent! The greatest criminal in
Bordeaux&mdash;playing with a dog! Muguet didn't know why it was so
funny. Perhaps it was just the vision of his old friend, Tolozan,
solemnly sitting there and announcing the fact that Laissac was
playing with a dog, as though it were a matter of profound
significance. Tolozan looked slightly annoyed and added:</p>

<p>"He's very fond of dogs."</p>

<p>This seemed to Muguet funnier still, and it was some moments
before he could steady his voice to say:</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad he's fond of something. Was there nothing you
could lay your hands on?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>It is certainly true that Muguet had a strong case in old
Laissac to confute his friend's theories. Where was "the accident
of crime" in such a confirmed criminal?</p>

<p>It is also true old Laissac was playing with a dog, and at that
very moment. Whilst the representatives of law and order were
discussing him in the Caf&eacute; Basque he was tickling the ribs
of his beloved Sancho, and saying:</p>

<p>"Up, soldier. Courage, my old warrior."</p>

<p>Sancho was a strange, forlorn-looking beast, not entirely
retriever, not wholly poodle, indeed not necessarily dog at all. He
had large sentimental eyes, and he worshipped his master with
unquestioning adoration. When his master was out, as he frequently
was on strange nocturnal adventures, he would lie on the mat by the
door, his nostrils snuggled between his paws, and watch the door.
Directly his master entered the house, Sancho would be aware of it.
He would utter one long whine of pleasure, and his skin would shake
and tremble with excitement. The reason of his perturbations this
morning was that part of the chimney had fallen down with a crash.
The brickwork had given way, and a little way up old Laissac could
see a narrow opening, revealing the leads on the adjoining roof. It
was summer time and such a disaster did not appal him unduly.</p>

<p>"Courage," he said, "to-morrow that shall be set right. To-day
and to-night we have another omelette in the pan, old comrade.
To-morrow there will be ham bones for Sancho, and a nice bottle of
fine champagne for the breadwinner, eh? Lie down, boy, that's only
old Grognard!"</p>

<p>The dog went into his corner, and a most strange-looking old man
entered the room. He had thin white hair, a narrow horse-like face
with prominent eyes. His face appeared much too thin and small for
the rest of his body, which had unexpected projections and
convolutions. From his movements it was immediately apparent that
his left side was paralysed. On the left breast of his shabby green
coat was a medal for saving lives. The medal recorded that, at the
age of twenty-six, he had plunged into the Garonne, and saved the
lives of two boys. He sat down and produced a sheet of dirty
paper.</p>

<p>"Everything is in order," he said dolefully.</p>

<p>"Good," said Laissac. "Show us the plan."</p>

<p>"This is the garage and the room above where you enter. The
chauffeur left with Madame Delannelle and her maid for Pau this
morning. They will be away three weeks or more. Monsieur Delannelle
sleeps in this room on the first floor; but as you know, he is a
drug fiend. From eleven o'clock till four in the morning he is in a
coma. Lisette and the other maid sleep on the top floor. Lisette
will see that this other woman gets a little of the white powder in
her cider before she retires. There is no one else in the house.
There is no dog."</p>

<p>"It appears a modest enterprise."</p>

<p>"It is as easy as opening a bottle of white oil. The door of the
room above the garage, connecting with the first landing in the
house, is locked and the key taken away, but it is a very
old-fashioned lock. You could open it with a bone toothpick,
master."</p>

<p>"H'm. I suppose Lisette expects something out of this?"</p>

<p>The old man sniggered, and blew his nose on a red
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"She's doing it for love."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;young Leon Briteuil?"</p>

<p>"Yes, now this is the point, master. Are you going to crack this
crib yourself, or would you like young Briteuil to go along? He's a
promising lad, and he would be proud to be in a job with you."</p>

<p>"What stuff is there, there?"</p>

<p>"In the second drawer on the left-hand side in a bureau in the
salon is a cash box, where Monsieur keeps the money from his rents.
He owns a lot of small property. There ought to be about ten
thousand francs. Madame has taken most of her jewels, but there are
a few trinkets in a jewel case in the bedroom. For the rest, there
is a collection of old coins in a cabinet, some of them gold. That
is in the library, here, see? And the usual silver plate and
trinkets scattered about the house. Altogether a useful haul, too
much for one man to carry."</p>

<p>"Very well, I'll take the young&mdash;, tell him to be at the
Place du Pont, the other side of the river, at twelve-thirty. If he
fails or makes the slightest slip, I'll break his face. Tell him
that. That's all."</p>

<p>"Right you are, master."</p>

<p>Young Briteuil was not quite the lion-hearted person he liked to
pose as, and this message frightened him. Long before the fateful
hour of the appointment, he was dreading the association of the
infamous Laissac more than the hazardous adventure upon which he
was committed. He would have rather made the attempt by himself. He
was neat with his fingers and had been quite successful pilfering
little articles from the big stores, but he had never yet
experienced the thrill of housebreaking.</p>

<p>Moreover, he felt bitterly that the arrangement was unjust. It
was he who had manoeuvred the whole field of operations, he with
his spurious love-making to the middle-aged coquettish Lisette.
There was a small fortune to be picked up, but because he was
pledged to the gang of which Laissac was the chief, his award would
probably amount to a capful of sous. Laissac had the handling of
the loot, and he would say that it realised anything he fancied.
Grognard had to have his commission also. The whole thing was
grossly unfair. He deeply regretted that he had not kept the
courting of Lisette a secret. Visions of unholy orgies danced
before his eyes. However, there it was, and he had to make the best
of it. He was politeness and humility itself when he met old
Laissac at the corner of the Place du Pont punctually at the hour
appointed. Laissac was in one of his sullen moods and they trudged
in silence out to the northern suburb where the villa of Monsieur
Delannelle was situated.</p>

<p>The night was reasonably dark and fine. As they got nearer and
nearer to their destination, and Laissac became more and more
unresponsive, the younger man's nerves began to get on edge. He was
becoming distinctly jumpy, and, as people will in such a condition,
he carried things to the opposite extreme. He pretended to be
extremely light-hearted, and to treat the affair as a most trivial
exploit. He even assumed an air of flippancy, but in this attitude
he was not encouraged by his companion, who on more than one
occasion told him to keep his ugly mouth shut.</p>

<p>"You won't be so merry when you get inside," he said.</p>

<p>"But there is no danger, no danger at all," laughed the young
man unconvincingly.</p>

<p>"There's always danger in our job," growled Laissac. "It's the
things you don't expect that you've got to look out for. You can
make every preparation, think of every eventuality, and then
suddenly, presto! a bullet from some unknown quarter. The gendarmes
may have had wind of it all the time. Monsieur Delannelle may not
have indulged in his dope for once. He may be sitting up with a
loaded gun. The girl Lisette may be an informer. The other girl may
have heard and given the game away. Madame and the chauffeur may
return at any moment. People have punctures sometimes. You can even
get through the job and then be nabbed at the corner of the street,
or the next morning, or the following week. There's a hundred
things likely to give you away. Inspector Tolozan himself may be
hiding in the garden with a half-dozen of his thick-necks. Don't
you persuade yourself it's a soft thing, my white-livered
cockerel."</p>

<p>This speech did not raise Leon's spirits. When they reached the
wall adjoining the garage, he was trembling like a leaf, and his
teeth began to chatter.</p>

<p>"I could do with a nip of brandy," he said sullenly in a changed
voice.</p>

<p>The old criminal looked at him contemptuously, and produced a
flask from some mysterious pocket. He took a swig, and then handed
it to his companion. He allowed him a little gulp, and then
snatched the flask away.</p>

<p>"Now, up you go," he said. Leon knew then that escape was
impossible. Old Laissac held out his hands for him to rest his heel
upon. He did so, and found himself jerked to the top of the wall.
The old man scrambled up after him somehow. They then dropped down
quietly on to some sacking in the corner of the yard. The garage
and the house were in complete darkness. The night was unnaturally
still, the kind of night when every little sound becomes unduly
magnified. Laissac regarded the dim structure of the garage with a
professional eye. Leon was listening for sounds, and imagining eyes
peering at them through the shutters...perhaps a pistol or two
already covering them. His heart was beating rapidly. He had never
imagined it was going to be such a nerve-racking business. Curse
the old man! Why didn't he let him have his full whack at the
brandy?</p>

<p>A sudden temptation crept over him. The old man was peering
forward. He would hit him suddenly on the back of the head and then
bolt. Yes, he would. He knew he would never have the courage to
force his way into that sinister place of unknown terrors. He would
rather die out here in the yard.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Laissac, advancing cautiously toward the door of
the garage.</p>

<p>Leon slunk behind him, watching for his opportunity. He had no
weapon, nothing but his hands, and he knew that in a struggle with
Laissac he would probably be worsted. The tidy concrete floor of
the yard held out no hope of promiscuous weapons. Once he thought:
"I will strike him suddenly on the back of the head with all my
might. As he falls I'll strike him again. When he's on the ground
I'll kick his brains out..."</p>

<p>To such a desperate pass can fear drive a man! Laissac stood by
the wood frame of the garage door looking up and judging the best
way to make an entrance of the window above. While he was doing so
Leon stared round, and his eye alighted on a short dark object near
the wall. It was a piece of iron piping. He sidled toward it, and
surreptitiously picked it up. At that exact instant Laissac glanced
round at him abruptly and whispered:</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>Now must this desperate venture be brought to a head. He
stumbled toward Laissac, mumbling vaguely:</p>

<p>"I thought this might be useful."</p>

<p>Leon was left-handed and he gripped the iron piping in that
hand. Laissac was facing him, and he must be put off his guard. He
mumbled:</p>

<p>"What's the orders, master?"</p>

<p>He doubtless hoped from this that Laissac would turn round and
look up again. He made no allowance for that animal instinct of
self-preservation which is most strongly marked in men of low
mentality. Without a word old Laissac sprang at him. He wanted to
scream with fear, but instead he struck wildly with the iron. He
felt it hit something ineffectually. A blow on the face staggered
him. In the agony of recovery he realised that his weapon had been
wrenched from his hands! Now, indeed, he would scream, and rouse
the neighbourhood to save him from this monster. If he could only
get his voice! If he could only get his voice! Curse this old
devil! Where is he? Spare me! Spare me! Oh, no, no...oh, God!</p>

<p>Old Laissac stuffed the body behind a bin where rubbish was put,
in the corner of the yard. The struggle had been curiously silent
and quick. The only sound had been the thud of the iron on his
treacherous assistant's skull, a few low growls and blows.
Fortunately, the young man had been too paralysed with fear to call
out. Laissac stood in the shadow of the wall and waited. Had the
struggle attracted any attention? Would it be as well to abandon
the enterprise? He thought it all out dispassionately. An owl, with
a deep mellow note, sailed majestically away toward a neighbouring
church. Perhaps it was rather foolish. If he were caught, and the
body discovered&mdash;that would be the end of Papa Laissac! That
would be a great misfortune. Everyone would miss him so, and he
still had life and fun in him. He laughed bitterly. Yes, perhaps he
had better steal quietly away. He moved over to the outer wall.</p>

<p>Then a strange revulsion came over him, perhaps a deep
bitterness with life, or a gambler's lure. Perhaps it was only
professional vanity. He had come here to burgle this villa, and he
disliked being thwarted. Besides it was such a soft thing, all the
dispositions so carefully laid. He had already thought out the way
to mount to the bedroom above the door. In half an hour he might be
richer by many thousand francs, and he had been getting rather hard
up of late. That young fool would be one less to pay. He shrugged
his broad shoulders, and crept back to the garage door.</p>

<p>In ten minutes time he had not only entered the room above the
garage but had forced the old-fashioned lock, and entered the
passage connecting with the house. He was perfectly cool now, his
senses keenly alert. He went down on his hands and knees and
listened. He waited some time focussing in his mind the exact
disposition of the rooms as shown in the plan old Grognard had
shown him. He crawled along the corridor like a large gorilla. At
the second door on the left he heard the heavy, stentorian
breathing of a man inside the room. Monsieur Delannelle, good! It
sounded like the breathing of a man under the influence of drugs or
drink.</p>

<p>After that, with greater confidence, he made his way downstairs
to the salon. With unerring precision he located the drawer in the
bureau where the cash box was kept. The box was smaller than he
expected and he decided to take it away rather than to indulge in
the rather noisy business of forcing the lock. He slipped it into a
sack. Guided by his electric torch, he made a rapid round of the
reception-rooms. He took most of the collection of old coins from
the cabinet in the library and a few more silver trinkets. Young
Briteuil would certainly have been useful carrying all this bulkier
stuff. Rather unfortunate, but still it served the young fool
right. He, Laissac, was not going to encumber himself with
plate...a few small and easily negotiable pieces were all he
desired, sufficient to keep him in old brandy, and Sancho in
succulent ham bones for a few months to come. A modest and simple
fellow, old Laissac.</p>

<p>The sack was soon sufficiently full. He paused by the table in
the dining-room and helped himself to another swig of brandy, then
he blinked his eyes. What else was there? Oh, yes, Grognard had
said that there were a few of Madame's jewels in the jewel case.
But that was in the bedroom where Monsieur Delannelle was sleeping,
that was a different matter, and yet after all, perhaps, a pity not
to have the jewels!</p>

<p>H'm, Monsieur Delannelle was in one of his drug stupours. It
must be about two o'clock. They said he never woke till five or
six. Why not? Besides what was a drugged man? He couldn't give any
trouble. If he tried to, Laissac could easily knock him over the
head as he had young Briteuil&mdash;might just as well have those
few extra jewels. His senses tingled rather more acutely as he once
more crept upstairs. He pressed his ear to the keyhole of Monsieur
Delannelle's bedroom. The master of the house was still
sleeping.</p>

<p>He turned the handle quietly, listened, then stole into the
room, closing the door after him. Now for it. He kept the play of
his electric torch turned from the bed. The sleeper was breathing
in an ugly, irregular way. He swept the light along the wall, and
located the dressing-table&mdash;satinwood and silver fittings. A
new piece of furniture&mdash;curse it! The top right-hand drawer
was locked. And that was the drawer which the woman said contained
the jewel case. Dare he force the lock? Was it worth it? He had
done very well. Why not clear off now? Madame had probably taken
everything of worth. He hesitated and looked in the direction of
the sleeper. Rich guzzling old pig! Why should he have all these
comforts and luxuries whilst Laissac had to work hard and at such
risk for his living? Be damned to him. He put down his sack and
took a small steel tool out of his breast pocket. It was necessary
to make a certain amount of noise, but after all the man in the bed
wasn't much better than a corpse. Laissac went down on his knees
and applied himself to his task.</p>

<p>The minutes passed. Confound it! It was a very obstinate lock.
He was becoming quite immersed in its intricacy when something
abruptly jarred his sensibilities. It was a question of silence.
The sleeper was no longer snoring or breathing violently. In fact
he was making no noise at all. Laissac was aware of a queer tremor
creeping down his spine for the first time that evening. He was a
fool not to have cleared out after taking the cash box. He had
overdone it. The man in bed was awake and watching him! What was
the best thing to do? Perhaps the fool had a revolver! If there was
any trouble he must fight. He couldn't allow himself to be taken,
with that body down below stuffed behind the dust-bin. Why didn't
the tormentor call out or challenge him? Laissac crept lower and
twisted his body into a crouching position.</p>

<p>By this action he saved his life, for there was a sudden
blinding flash, and a bullet struck the dressing-table just at the
place where his head had been. This snapping of the tension was
almost a relief. It was a joy to revert to the primitive instincts
of self-preservation. At the foot of the bed an eiderdown had
fallen. Instinct drove him to snatch this up. He crumpled it up
into the rough form of a body and thrust it with his right hand
over the end of the bed. Another bullet went through it and struck
the dressing-table again. But as this happened, Laissac, who had
crept to the left side of the bed sprang across it and gripped the
sleeper's throat. The struggle was of momentary duration. The
revolver dropped to the floor. The man addicted to drugs gasped,
spluttered, then his frame shook violently and he crumpled into an
inert mass upon the bed. A blind fury was upon Laissac. He struck
the still, cold thing again and again, then a revulsion of terror
came over him. He crouched in the darkness, sweating with fear.</p>

<p>"They'll get me this time," he thought. "Those shots must have
been heard. Lisette, the other maid, the neighbours, the
gendarmes...two of these disgusting bodies to account for. I'd
better leave the swag and clear." He drained the rest of the brandy
and staggered uncertainly toward the door. The house was very
still. He turned the handle and went into the passage. Then one of
those voices which were always directing his life said:</p>

<p>"Courage, old man, why leave the sack behind? You've worked for
it. Besides, one might as well be hanged for a sheep as a
lamb!"</p>

<p>He went quietly back and picked up the sack. But his hands were
shaking violently. As he was returning, the sack with its metallic
contents struck the end of the brass bed. This little accident
affected him fantastically. He was all fingers and thumbs to-night.
What was the matter? Was he losing his nerve? Getting old? Of
course, the time must come when&mdash;God! What was that? He stood
dead still by the jamb of the door. There was the sound of the
stealthy tread on the stairs, the distinct creak of a board. How
often in his life had he not imagined that! But there was no
question about it to-night. He was completely unstrung.</p>

<p>"If there's another fight I won't be able to face it. I'm
done."</p>

<p>An interminable interval of time passed, and then&mdash;that
quiet creaking of another board, the person, whoever it was, was
getting nearer. He struggled desperately to hold himself together,
to be prepared for one more struggle, even if it should be his
last. Suddenly a whisper came down the stairs:</p>

<p>"Leon!"</p>

<p>Leon! What did they mean? Eh? Oh, yes&mdash;Leon Briteuil! Of
course that fool of a woman, the informer&mdash;Lisette. She
thought it was Leon. Leon, her lover. He breathed more easily.
Women have their uses and purposes after all. But he must be very
circumspect. There must be no screaming. She repeated:</p>

<p>"Leon, is that you?"</p>

<p>With a great effort he controlled his voice.</p>

<p>"It's all right. I'm Leon's friend. He's outside."</p>

<p>The woman gave a little gasp of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Oh! I did not know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very quietly, mademoiselle. Compose yourself. I must now rejoin
him. Everything is going well."</p>

<p>"But I would see him. I wish to see him to-night. He
promised&mdash;"</p>

<p>Laissac hurried noiselessly down the stairs, thankful for the
darkness. He waited till he had reached the landing below. Then he
called up in a husky voice:</p>

<p>"Wait till ten minutes after I have left the house,
mademoiselle, then come down. You will find your Leon waiting for
you behind the dust-bin in the yard."</p>

<p>And fortunately for Lisette's momentary peace of mind, she could
not see the inhuman grin which accompanied this remark.</p>

<p>From the moment of his uttering it till four hours later, when
his mangled body was discovered by a gendarme on the pavement just
below the window of the house in which he lived in the Place
Duquesne, there is no definite record of old Laissac's movements or
whereabouts.</p>

<p>It exists only in those realms of conjecture in which Monsieur
Tolozan is so noted an explorer.</p>

<p>Old Laissac had a genius for passing unnoticed. He could walk
through the streets of Bordeaux in broad daylight with stolen
clocks under each arm and it never occurred to any one to suspect
him, but when it came to travelling in the dark he was unique. At
the inquest, which was held five days later, not a single witness
could come forward and say that they had seen anything of him
either that evening or night.</p>

<p>That highly eminent advocate Maxim Colbert, president of the
court, passed from the cool mortuary into the stuffy courthouse
with a bored, preoccupied air. Dead bodies did not greatly interest
him, and he had had too much experience of them to be nauseated by
them&mdash;besides, an old criminal! It appeared to him, a tedious
and unnecessary waste of time. The old gentleman had something much
more interesting occupying his mind. He was expecting his
daughter-in-law to present his son with a child. The affair might
happen now, any moment, indeed, it might already have happened. Any
moment a message might come with the good tidings. A son! Of course
it must be a son! The line of Colbert tracing their genealogy back
to the reign of Louis XIV&mdash;must be perpetuated. A
distinguished family of advocates, generals, rulers of men. A Son!
It annoyed him a little in that he suspected that his own son was
anxious to have a daughter. Bah! Selfishness.</p>

<p>Let us see what is this case all about? Oh, yes, an old criminal
named Theodore Laissac, aged fifty-seven, wanted by the police in
connection with a mysterious crime at the villa of Monsieur and
Madame Delannelle. The body found by a printer's devil, named
Adolph Roger, at 4.15 o'clock on the morning of the ninth, on the
pavement of the Place Duquesne. Witness informed police.
Sub-inspector Floquette attested to the finding of body as
indicated by witness. The position of body directly under attic
window, five stories high, occupied by deceased, suggesting that he
had fallen or thrown himself therefrom. Good! Quite clear. A life
of crime, result&mdash;suicide. Will it be a boy or girl? Let us
have the deceased's record...</p>

<p>A tall square-bearded inspector stood up in the body of the
court, and in a sepulchral voice read out the criminal life record
of Theodore Laissac. It was not pretty reading. It began at the age
of seventeen with the murder of the Chinaman, Ching Loo, and from
thence onward it revealed a deplorable story of villainy and
depravity. The record of evil doings and the award of penalties
became monotonous. The mind of Maxim Colbert wandered back to his
son, and to his son's son. He had already seen the case in a
nutshell and dismissed it. It would give him a pleasant opportunity
a little later on. A homily on the wages of sin...a man whose life
was devoted to evil-doing, in the end driven into a corner by the
forces of justice, smitten by the demons of conscience, dies the
coward's death. A homily on cowardice, quoting a passage from
Thomas agrave; Kempis, excellent!...Would they send him a telegram?
Or would the news come by hand? What was that the Counsel for the
Right of the Poor was saying? Chief Inspector Tolozan wished to
give evidence. Ah, yes, why not? A worthy fellow, Inspector
Tolozan. He had known him for many years, worked with him on many
cases, an admirable, energetic officer, a little given to
theorising&mdash;an interesting fellow, though. He would
cross-examine him himself.</p>

<p>Inspector Tolozan took his place in the witness box, and bowed
to the president. His steady grey eyes regarded the court
thoughtfully as he tugged at his thin grey imperial.</p>

<p>"Now, Inspector Tolozan, I understand that you have this
district in which this&mdash;unfortunate affair took place, under
your own special supervision?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>monsieur le pr&eacute;sident</i>."</p>

<p>"You have heard the evidence of the witnesses Roger and
Floquette with regard to the finding of the body?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Afterward, I understand, you made an inspection of the premises
occupied by the deceased?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>"At what time was that?"</p>

<p>"At six-fifteen, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Did you arrive at any conclusions with regard to the cause or
motive of the&mdash;er accident?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>monsieur le pr&eacute;sident</i>."</p>

<p>"What conclusions did you come to?"</p>

<p>"I came to the conclusion that the deceased, Theodore Laissac,
met his death trying to save the life of a dog."</p>

<p>"A dog! Trying to save the life of a dog!"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>The president looked at the court, the court looked at the
president and shuffled with papers, glancing apprehensively at the
witness between times. There was no doubt that old Tolozan was
becoming cranky, very cranky indeed. The president cleared his
throat&mdash;was he to be robbed of his homily on the wages of
sin?</p>

<p>"Indeed, Monsieur Tolozan, you came to the conclusion that the
deceased met his death trying to save the life of a dog! Will you
please explain to the court how you came to these conclusions?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>monsieur le pr&eacute;sident</i>; the deceased had a
dog to which he was very devoted."</p>

<p>"Wait one moment, Inspector Tolozan, how do you know that he was
devoted to this dog?"</p>

<p>"I have seen him with it. Moreover, during the years he has been
under my supervision he has always had a dog to which he was
devoted. I could call some of his criminal associates to prove
that, although he was frequently cruel to men, women, and even
children, he would never strike or be unkind to a dog. He would
never burgle a house guarded by a dog in case he had to use
violence."</p>

<p>"Proceed."</p>

<p>"During that day or evening there had apparently been a slight
subsidence in the chimney place of the attic occupied by Laissac.
Some brickwork had collapsed, leaving a narrow aperture just room
enough for a dog to squeeze its body through, and get out on the
sloping leads of the house next door. The widow Forbin, who
occupies the adjoining attic, complains that she was kept awake for
three hours that night by the whining of a dog on the leads above.
This whining ceased about three-thirty, which must have been the
time that the deceased met his death. There was only one way for a
man to get from his attic to these leads and that was a rain-water
pipe, sloping from below the window at an angle of forty-five
degrees to the roof next door. He could stand on this water pipe,
but there was nothing to cling to except small projections of brick
till he could scramble hold of the gutter above. He never reached
the gutter."</p>

<p>"All of this is pure conjecture, of course, Inspector
Tolozan?"</p>

<p>"Not entirely, <i>monsieur le pr&eacute;sident</i>. My theory is
that after Laissac's departure, the dog became disconsolate and
restless, as they often will, knowing by some mysterious instinct
that its master is in danger. He tried to get out of the room and
eventually succeeded in forcing his way through the narrow aperture
in the fireplace. His struggle getting through brought down some
more brickwork and closed up the opening. This fact I have
verified. Out on the sloping roof the dog naturally became
terrified. There was no visible means of escape; the roof was
sloping, and the night cold. Moreover, he seemed more cut off from
his master than ever. As the widow, Forbin, asserts, he whined
pitiably. Laissac returned some time after three o'clock. He
reached the attic. The first thing he missed was the dog. He ran to
the window and heard it whining on the roof above. Probably he
hesitated for some time as to the best thing to do. The dog leaned
over and saw him. He called to it to be quiet, but so agitated did
it appear, hanging over the edge of that perilous slope, that
Laissac thought every moment that it would jump. <i>Monsieur le
pr&eacute;sident</i>, nearly every crime has been lain at the door
of the deceased, but he has never been accused of lack of physical
courage. Moreover, he was accustomed to climbing about buildings.
He dropped through that window and started to climb up."</p>

<p>"How do you know this?"</p>

<p>"I examined the water pipe carefully. The night was dry and
there had not been rain for three days. Laissac had removed his
boots. He knew that it would naturally be easier to walk along a
pipe in his socks. There are the distinct marks of stockinged feet
on the dusty pipes for nearly two metres of the journey. The body
was bootless and the boots were found in the attic. But he was an
old man for his age, and probably he had had an exhausting evening.
He never quite reached the gutter."</p>

<p>"Are the marks on the gutter still there?"</p>

<p>"No, but I drew the attention of three of my subordinates to the
fact, and they are prepared to support my view. It rained the next
day. The body of the dog was found by the side of its master."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Do you suggest that the dog&mdash;committed suicide as
it were?"</p>

<p>Tolozan shrugged his shoulders and bowed. It was not his
business to understand the psychology of dogs. He was merely giving
evidence in support of his theories concerning the character of
criminals&mdash;"birds"&mdash;and the accident of crime.</p>

<p>Maxim Colbert was delighted. The whole case had been salvaged
from the limbo of dull routine. He even forgave Tolozan for causing
him to jettison those platitudes upon the wages of sin. He had made
it interesting. Besides, he felt in a good humour&mdash;it would
surely be a boy! The procedure of the court bored him, but he was
noticeably cheerful, almost gay. He thanked the inspector profusely
for his evidence. Once he glanced at the clock casually, and said
in an impressive voice:</p>

<p>"Perhaps we may say of the deceased&mdash;he lived a vicious
life, but he died not ingloriously."</p>

<p>The court broke up and he passed down into a quadrangle at the
back where a pale sun filtered. Lawyers, ushers, court
functionaries and police officials were scattering or talking in
little groups. Standing outside a group he saw the spare figure of
Inspector Tolozan. He touched his arm and smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, my friend, you established an interesting case. I feel
that the verdict was just, and yet I cannot see that it in any way
corroborates your theory of the accident of crime."</p>

<p>Tolozan paused and blinked up at the sun.</p>

<p>"It did not corroborate, perhaps, but it did nothing
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well? This old man was an inveterate criminal. The fact that he
loved a dog&mdash;it's not a very great commendation. Many
criminals do."</p>

<p>"But they would not give their lives, monsieur. A man who would
do that is capable of&mdash;I mean to say it was probably an
accident that he was not a better man."</p>

<p>"Possibly, possibly! But the record, my dear Tolozan!"</p>

<p>"One may only conjecture."</p>

<p>"What is your conjecture?"</p>

<p>Tolozan gazed dreamily up at the Gothic tracery of the adjoining
chapel. Then he turned to Monsieur Colbert and said very
earnestly:</p>

<p>"You must remember that there was nothing against Laissac until
the age of seventeen. He had been a boy of good character. His
father was an honest wheelwright. At the age of seventeen the boy
was to go to sea on the sailing ship <i>La Turenne</i>. Owing to
some trouble with the customs authorities the sailing of the ship
was delayed twenty-four hours. The boy was given shore leave. He
hung about the docks. There was nothing to do. He had no money to
spend on entertainment. My conjecture is this. Let us suppose it
was a day like this, calm and sunny with a certain quiet
exhilaration in the air. Eh? The boy wanders around the quays and
stares in the shops. Suddenly at the corner of the Rue Bayard he
peeps down into a narrow gally and beholds a sight which drives the
blood wildly through his veins."</p>

<p>"What sight, Monsieur Tolozan?"</p>

<p>"The Chinaman, Chong Loo, being cruel to a dog."</p>

<p>"Ah! I see your implication."</p>

<p>"The boy sees red. There is the usual brawl and scuffle. He
possibly does not realise his own strength. Follow the lawcourt and
the penitentiary. Can you not understand how such an eventuality
would embitter him against society? To him in the hereafter the dog
would stand as the symbol of patient suffering, humanity as the
tyrant. He would be at war for ever, an outcast, a derelict. He was
raw, immature, uneducated. He was at the most receptive stage. His
sense of justice was outraged. The penitentiary made him a
criminal."</p>

<p>"Then from this you mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I mean that if the good ship <i>La Turenne</i> had sailed to
time, or if he had not been given those few hours' leave, he might
by this time have been a master mariner, or in any case a man who
could look the world in the face. That is what I mean by the
accident&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me."</p>

<p>A messenger had handed Monsieur Colbert a telegram. He tore it
open feverishly and glanced at the contents. An expression of
annoyance crept over his features. He tore the form up in little
pieces and threw it petulantly upon the ground. He glanced up at
Tolozan absently as though he had seen him for the first time. Then
he muttered vaguely:</p>

<p>"The accident, eh? Oh, yes, yes. Quite so, quite so."</p>

<p>But he did not tell Inspector Tolozan what the telegram
contained.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch08" id="ch08"></a>8. THE FRIENDS</h2>

<p>White and Mapleson often tried to recall the occasion when their
friendship began, but neither succeeded. Perhaps it had its origin
in some moment when the memory was to some extent blurred. Certain
it is that they drifted together across the miasma of commercial
London, and founded a deep and lasting friendship that found its
chief expression in the chinking of glasses in the saloon and
luncheon bars of various hostelries off Oxford Street and
Bloomsbury.</p>

<p>White acted as an agent for a firm of wire-mattress
manufacturers in Old Street in the City, and as his business was
conducted principally among the furnishing and upholstering
outfitters in the West End, and as Mapleson was the manager of the
brass-bed department at Taunton's, the large furnishing emporium in
Bloomsbury, it is not surprising that they came in contact and that
they had many interests in common. There is, alas! no doubt that
the most absorbing interest of both was the consumption of liquid
refreshment, and there is also, alas! no doubt that the friendship
was quickened by the curious coincidence of their mental vision
when stimulated by alcoholic fumes. And it is here that one or two
curious facts relating to the personalities of the two men should
be noted. During the day it would be no uncommon thing for either
man to consume anything between ten and fifteen whiskies and sodas,
and sometimes even more; yet of neither man could it be said that
he was ever really drunk. On the other hand, of neither man could
it be said that he was ever really sober. White was a man of medium
height, rather pale and slight. He had a dark moustache, and was
always neatly dressed in a dark-blue suit, with well-fitting boots
and gloves. He was extremely quiet and courteous in manner, and his
manner varied but little. The effect of alcohol upon him was only
to accentuate his courtesy and politeness. Toward the evening his
lips would tremble a little, but he would become more and more
ingratiating. His voice would descend to a refined gentle croon,
his eyes would just glow with a sympathetic light, and he would
listen with his head slightly on one side and an expression that
conveyed the idea that the remarks of the speaker were a matter of
great moment to him. Not that he did not speak himself; on the
contrary, he spoke well, but always with a deferential timbre, as
though attuning himself to the mood and mental attitude of his
companion.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mapleson always started the day badly. He was
a large, florid man, with a puffy face and strangely colourless
eyes. He wore a ponderous frockcoat that was just a little out of
date, with a waistcoat that hung in folds, and the folds never
seemed free from sandwich crumbs and tobacco-ash. He had an
unfortunate habit with his clothes of never being quite complete.
That is to say, that if he had on a new top-hat, his boots were
invariably shabby; or if his boots were a recent acquisition, his
top-hat would seem all brushed the wrong way. As I say, he always
started the day badly. He would be very late and peevish, and would
fuss about with pills and cloves. He would complain of not being
quite "thumbs up." Eleven-fifteen would invariably find him round
at the Monitor, leaning against the mahogany bar and asking Mrs.
Wylde to mix him "a whisky and peppermint," or some other decoction
that between them they considered would be just the thing for his
special complaint that morning. "In the way of business," he would
treat and be treated by several other pals in "the sticks," as this
confraternity called the furnishing trade. It would be interesting
to know what proportion of Mapleson's and White's income was
devoted to this good cause. When Mapleson would arrive home
sometimes late at night, breathing heavily, and carrying with him
the penetrating atmosphere of the tap-room, he would say in
response to the complaints of his tired wife:</p>

<p>"I hate the stuff, my dear. You have to do it, though. It's all
in the way of business."</p>

<p>A sociologist might have discovered, if he were searching for
concrete instances, that White and Mapleson spent on each other
every year very nearly eighty pounds, although the business they
did together amounted to rather less than thirty, a somewhat
unsound premium.</p>

<p>As the day wore on, Mapleson would improve. And it was one of
the assets of the White-Mapleson friendship that they usually did
not meet till luncheon-time. Then the two friends would chink
glasses and stroll arm in arm into Polati's, in Oxford Street, for,
as Mapleson would say, "When a man works hard he needs feeding,"
and White would agree with him deferentially, and they would secure
a seat not too near the band, and after thoroughly considering the
menu, they would order a "mixed grill," as being "something English
and that you can get your teeth into." During the interval of
waiting for the mixed grill, which took fifteen minutes to prepare,
Mapleson would insist on standing White a gin and bitters, and of
course it was only right and courteous of White to return the
compliment. The mixed grill would be washed down with a tankard of
ale or more often with whisky and soda, after which the friends
would sometimes share a Welsh rabbit or a savoury, and it was
Mapleson who introduced the plan of finishing the meal with a
coffee and liqueur. "It stimulates one's mind for the afternoon's
business," he would explain, and White flattered him on his good
sense, and insisted on standing an extra liqueur, "just to give
value to one's cigar." Under the influence of these good things,
Mapleson would become garrulous, and White even more soothing and
sympathetic. This luncheon interval invariably lasted two hours or
two hours and a half. They would then part, each to his own
business, while making an appointment to meet later in the
afternoon at the Duke of Gadsburg.</p>

<p>And here a notable fact must be recorded: for an hour or two in
the afternoon each man <i>did</i> do some work. And it is a
remarkable point that Taunton's, the great house in Bloomsbury,
always considered Mapleson a good salesman, as indeed he was. The
vast lapses of time that he spent away from business were explained
away on the score of active canvassing. His "turnover" for the year
compared favourably with that of the other managers at Taunton's.
While of White strange rumours of the enormous fortune that he was
accumulating were always current. The natural reserve of the
wire-mattress agent, and his remarkable lucidity on matters of
finance, added to the fact that he took in and studied <i>The
Statist</i>, gave him a unique position in the upholstering world.
Men would whisper together over their glasses and say, "Ah, old
White! He knows a thing or two," and grave speculations would go on
as to whether his income ran into four figures, and in what
speculations he invested his money. Considerable profundity was
given to these rumours by the fact that White always <i>had</i>
money and that he was always willing to lend it. He carried a
sovereign purse that seemed inexhaustible.</p>

<p>Mapleson, on the other hand, though natively lavish, had periods
of "financial depression." At these periods he would drink more and
become maudlin and mawkish, and it was invariably White who helped
him out of his troubles. The two friends would meet later in the
afternoon "to take a cup of tea," and it often happened that
Mapleson felt that tea would not be just the thing for his nervous
constitution; so White would prescribe a whisky and soda, and they
would adjourn to a place where such things may be procured. It is
remarkable how quickly the time passed under these conditions; but
just before six Mapleson would "run back to the shop to see if any
orders had come in." With studious consideration White would wait
for him. It was generally half-past six or seven before Mapleson
returned, thoroughly exhausted with his day's work.</p>

<p>It was then that the suavity and charm of White's manner was
most ingratiating. He would insist on Mapleson having a comfortable
seat by the fire in the saloon, and himself carrying across the
drinks from the bar. Mapleson soon became comforted, and would
suggest "a game of pills before going home." Nothing appealed to
White more than this, for he was a remarkable billiard-player.
Young Charlie Maybird, who was a furniture draughtsman and an
expert on sport, used to say that "White could give any pub marker
in London forty in a hundred and beat him off the mark." He had a
curious feline way of following the balls round the table; he
seemed almost to purr over them, to nurse them and stroke them, and
make them perform most astounding twists and turns. And every time
he succeeded, he would give a sort of self-depreciatory croon, as
much as to say: "I'm so sorry! I really don't know how the balls
happen to do all this." And yet it is remarkable how often White
lost, especially against Mapleson.</p>

<p>Mapleson was one of those players who give one the impression of
being an expert on an off-day. As a matter of fact, he never had an
"on" day. He was just a third-rate player; only he would attempt
most difficult shots, and then give vent to expressions of the
utmost surprise and disgust that they didn't come off.</p>

<p>The billiards would last till eight o'clock or half-past, when a
feeling of physical exhaustion would prompt the arrangement that "a
chop would be a good idea." They would then adjourn once more to
the dining-room at the Monitor, and regale themselves with chops,
cheese, and ale, by which time Mapleson would arrive at the
conclusion that it wasn't worth while going home; so an adjournment
would be made once more to the bar, and the business of the evening
would begin.</p>

<p>It might be worth while to recall one or two features of the
Monitor bar, which was invariably crowded by salesmen and
assistants from Taunton's, and was looked upon as a sort of
headquarters of the upholstering trade at that time. It was a large
room, fitted in the usual way with glittering mahogany and small
glass mirrors. Two long seats upholstered in green leather were set
about a cheerful fireplace of blue tiles. There were also four
small circular tables with marble tops, and on each side of the
fireplace two enormous bright blue pots of hideous design
containing palms. On the side facing the bar was a florid staircase
with a brass hand-rail leading up to the dining and
billiard-rooms.</p>

<p>The only difference that a stranger might have felt between this
and any other place of similar description at that time lay perhaps
in its mental atmosphere. There was always a curious feeling of
freemasonry. In addition to Mrs. Wylde there were two other
barmaids, Nancy and Olive, who was also sometimes called "the
Titmouse." Both were tall, rather thin girls, with a wealth of
wonderful flaxen hair. They seemed to spend a considerable amount
of time, when not engaged in serving, in brewing themselves cocoa
and hot milk. Olive was a teetotaller, and confessed frankly with
regard to alcohol that she "hated the muck," but Nancy would
occasionally drink stout.</p>

<p>To be served by Mrs. Wylde was a treat that only occasionally
occurred to the more favoured devotees of the Monitor. She was a
woman of enormous proportions, with a white-powdered face and also
a wealth of flaxen hair. She invariably wore a rather shabby black
dress, trimmed with lace, and a huge bunch of flowers, usually
lilies and carnations.</p>

<p>Now, everybody who came into the bar of the Monitor seemed not
only to know Nancy and Olive and Mrs. Wylde by name, but everybody
else by their name or nickname. For instance, this sort of thing
would happen: a pale, thin young man, with pointed boots and a sort
of semi-sporting suit, would creep furtively in and go up to the
bar and lean across and shake hands with Nancy, and after a normal
greeting would say:</p>

<p>"Has the Captain been in?" Nancy would reply:</p>

<p>"Yes, he was in with the Rabbit about four o'clock." Then the
young man would say:</p>

<p>"Oh, didn't he leave nothing for me?" and Nancy would say:</p>

<p>"No. I wouldn't be surprised if he came in later. 'Ere, I tell
you what&mdash;" and she would draw the young man to a corner of
the bar, and there would be a whispered conversation for a few
moments, and then the young man would go out. All of which would
seem very mysterious to a casual visitor.</p>

<p>Of this atmosphere White and Mapleson were part and parcel. They
had their own particular little round table near the fire, where,
despite Mapleson's daily avowal to get home, one could rely on
finding them nearly every evening. And they gathered about them a
small colony of kindred spirits. Here they would sit very often
till nearly twelve o'clock, when the Monitor shut, drinking whisky
and talking. As the evening advanced, Mapleson expanded. One of his
favourite themes was conscription. On this subject he and White
were absolutely in accord.</p>

<p>"Every man ought to be made to serve his country," Mapleson
would say, bringing his fist down with a bang on the marble table.
"He ought to be made to realize his civil responsibilities and what
he owes to the empire. Every man under thirty-five should serve
three years."&mdash;Mapleson was forty-four&mdash;"It seems to me
we're becoming a nation of knock-kneed, sentimental women."</p>

<p>And White would dilate upon what the Germans were doing and
would give precise facts and figures of the strength of the German
army, and the cost and probabilities of landing ten army corps on
the coast of Suffolk.</p>

<p>Another favourite theme was the action of "these silly women,"
and Mapleson would set the bar in roars of laughter with a
description of what <i>he</i> would do if <i>he</i> were Home
Secretary.</p>

<p>Mapleson was very fond of talking about "his principles." In
conversation it seemed that his actions must be hedged in by these
iron-bound conventions. In effect they were virtually as follows:
Business comes first always; never fail to keep a business
appointment; never mix port and whisky; never give anything to a
stranger that you might give to a pal.</p>

<p>He had other rules of life, but they were concerned exclusively
with questions of diet and drinking, and need not concern us
here.</p>

<p>Thoroughly exhausted with the day's business, Mapleson would
leave the imperturbable White just before twelve o'clock, and not
infrequently would find it necessary to take a cab to Baker Street
to catch his last train to Willesden Green, where he lived, and
where he would arrive at night, having spent during the day a sum
varying between twenty and thirty shillings, which was precisely
the amount he allowed his wife every week to keep house for a
family of five, and to include food, clothing, and washing.</p>

<p>White lived at Acton, and no one ever quite knew how he arrived
there or by what means. But he never failed to report at nine
o'clock the next morning at Old Street, with all his notes, orders,
and instructions neatly written out. It was remarkable how long the
Monitor remained the headquarters of this fraternity, for, as one
of them remarked, "the licensing business is very sensitive" in the
same way that a flock of crows will simultaneously and without any
apparent reason fly from one hill to another; it will be a sort of
fashion for a group of men to patronise a certain establishment and
then suddenly to segregate elsewhere. It is true that there were
one or two attempts at defection&mdash;Charlie Maybird once made an
effort to establish a headquarters as far away as the Trocadero
even&mdash;but the birds soon returned to the comforting hostelry
of Mrs. Wylde.</p>

<p>And then one summer Mapleson was very ill. He got wet through
walking to Baker Street one evening when, after having started, he
found he had only three coppers on him. He travelled home in his
wet clothes, and next day developed a bad chill, which turned into
pneumonia. For days he lay in a critical state, but, thanks to the
attention of Mrs. Mapleson, who did not go to bed for three nights,
and a careful doctor, he got over the crisis. But the doctor
forbade him to go back to business for a fortnight, and suggested
that if it was possible to arrange it, a few days at the seaside
might set him up. White called several times, and was most anxious
and solicitous, and assured Mrs. Mapleson that he would do anything
in his power to help his friend, and sent a large basket of
expensive fruits and some bottles of very old port wine.</p>

<p>Mapleson's illness, however, was of more troublesome a nature
than appeared at first. After a rather serious relapse the doctor
said that his heart was not quite what it should be, and it was
nearly a month before the question of moving him could be
considered. Taunton's treated Mapleson very well over this, and his
salary was paid every week; only, of course, he lost his
commission, which in the ordinary way represented the bulk of his
income, and it became necessary for Mrs. Mapleson to economize with
the utmost skill, especially as the invalid required plenty of good
and well-cooked food on regaining his strength. The rest of the
family had therefore to go on shorter commons than usual, and
matters were not helped by the fact of one of the children
developing glands and being in an enfeebled condition. White called
one evening, and was drinking a glass of the old port with the
invalid, and they were discussing how it could be arranged for
Mapleson to get a week at Brighton.</p>

<p>"I think I could travel now," said Mapleson; "only I don't see
how the missus is going to leave Flora."</p>

<p>It was then that White had an inspiration. If it would help
matters in the Mapleson family he would be pleased to take a week
off and go to Brighton with Mapleson. Mapleson hailed this idea
with delight, and Mrs. Mapleson was informed, on entering the room
a little later, "You need not bother about it any more, my dear;
White has been good enough to offer to go to Brighton with me."
Mrs. Mapleson was a woman who said very little, and it was
difficult on this occasion to know what she thought. In fact, her
taciturnity at times irritated Mapleson beyond endurance. She
merely paused, drew in her thin pale lips, and murmured, "All
right, dear," and then busied herself with preparing Mapleson's
evening broth.</p>

<p>The friends were very lucky with the weather. Fresh breezes off
the Channel tempered the fierce August sun and made the conditions
on the front delightful. It might be hinted that perhaps the
weather might have been otherwise for all the interest that they
took in it.</p>

<p>For the first day or so, finding his vitality returning to him,
Mapleson persuaded his companion that the choicest spot in Brighton
was the saloon bar of the Old Ship. And he could not show his
gratitude sufficiently. White was given carte blanche to order
anything he liked. But White would not listen to such generosity.
He knew that the expenses that Mapleson had had to endure must be
telling on him, so he insisted on paying at least twice out of
three times. Mapleson acknowledged that it was "a hell of a worry
and responsibility having a family to keep. They simply eat up the
money, my dear chap."</p>

<p>The week passed quickly enough, and both were soon back at their
occupations in town. The friendship pursued the even tenor of its
way, and it was fifteen months before any incident came to disturb
it.</p>

<p>Then one day in October something happened to White. He fell
down in the street, and was taken to a hospital. It was rumoured
that he was dead. Consternation prevailed in the upholstering
confraternity, and Mapleson made anxious enquiries at the hospital
bureau. It was difficult to gather precise details, but it was
announced that White was very ill, and that a very serious
operation would have to be performed. Mapleson returned to the bar
of the Monitor harbouring a nameless dread. A strange feeling of
physical sickness crept over him. He sat in the corner of the bar,
sipping his whisky, enveloped in a lugubrious gloom. He heard the
young sparks enter and laugh and joke about White. It was a subject
of constant and cynical mirth. "Hullo," they would say, "heard
about old White? He's done in at last." And then there would be
whisperings and chucklings, and he would hear: "Drunk himself to
death. Doesn't stand a dog's chance, my dear chap. My uncle had the
same thing. Why, he's been at it now for about twenty-five years.
Can't think how he's lasted so long." And then they would come
grinning up to Mapleson, hoping for more precise details. "Sorry to
hear about your friend, Mr. Mapleson. How did it happen?"</p>

<p>Mapleson could not stand it. He pushed back his half-filled
glass, and stumbled out of the bar. He was not aware of an
affection for White, or of any sentiment other than a vast fear and
a strange absorbing depression. He crept into the saloon of a small
house off the Charing Cross Road, where no one would be likely to
know him, and sat silently sipping from his glass. It seemed to
have no effect upon him. The vision of White lying there, like
death, and perhaps even now the doctors busy with their steel
knives&mdash;</p>

<p>Mapleson shivered. He ordered more whisky and drank it neat. He
stumbled on into other bars all the way to Trafalgar Square,
wrestling with his fear, and drinking. The spirits ultimately took
their effect, and he sat somewhere, in some dark corner, he could
never remember where, with his mind in a state of trance. He
remembered being turned out&mdash;it must have been twelve
o'clock&mdash;and engaging a cab&mdash;he could just remember his
address&mdash;and ordering the man to drive home. In the cab he
went sound asleep, hopelessly drunk for the first time in many
years. He knew nothing more till the next day. Some one must have
come down to help carry him in; he was no light weight. He woke up
about one o'clock, feeling very ill and scared. He jumped up and
called out:</p>

<p>"What the devil's the time? What are we all doing? Why haven't I
been called?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mapleson came in; she put her hand on his forehead and
said:</p>

<p>"It's all right. I sent a telegram to say you were ill. You had
better stop here. I'll get you some tea."</p>

<p>Mapleson fell back on the pillows, and the sickening
recollection of last night came back to him.</p>

<p>Later in the evening Mrs. Mapleson came in again and said:</p>

<p>"I hear that Mr. White has had his operation, and is going on as
well as could be expected."</p>

<p>Beads of perspiration streamed down Mapleson's face, and he
murmured, "My God! my God!" That was all that was said, and the
next day Mapleson went back to work.</p>

<p>The officials at the hospital seemed curiously reticent about
White. The only information to be gleaned for some days was that he
was alive. Mapleson went about his work with nerveless
indifference. He drank, but his drinking was more automatic than
spontaneous. He drank from habit, but he gained neither pleasure
nor profit from doing so.</p>

<p>The nameless fear pursued him. Great bags appeared under his
eyes, which were partly blood-shot. He stooped in his walk, and
began to make mistakes in his accounts, and to be abstracted in
dealing with customers.</p>

<p>He was arraigned before two of the directors of Taunton's, and
one of them finished a harangue by suggesting that "it might be
more conformable to business methods if he would remove the traces
of yesterday's breakfast from the folds of his waistcoat." The
large man received these criticisms in a pathetic silence. "Poor
old Mapleson!" they said round in the bar of the Monitor. "I've
never seen a chap cut up so about anything as he is about White,"
and then abstract discussions on friendship would follow, and
remarkable instances of friendship formed in business.</p>

<p>Of course White would die&mdash;that was a settled and arranged
thing, and curiously enough little sympathy was expressed even by
those to whom White had lent money. Despite his charm of manner and
his generosity, they all felt that there was something about White
they didn't understand. He was too clever, too secretive.</p>

<p>On Friday he was slightly better, but on Saturday he had a
relapse, and on Sunday morning, when Mapleson called at the
hospital, he was informed that White was sinking, and they didn't
expect him to last forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>Mapleson had inured himself to this thought; he had made up his
mind to this conclusion from the first, and this last intimation
hardly affected him. He went about like one stunned, without
volition, without interest. He was only aware of a vast unhappiness
and misery of which White was in some way a factor.</p>

<p>For five days the wire-mattress agent lay on the verge of death,
and then he began to rally slightly. The house surgeon said it was
one of the most remarkable constitutions he had ever come up
against. For three days there was a distinct improvement, followed
by another relapse; but still White fought on. At the end of
another week he was out of danger, but the convalescence was long
and tedious.</p>

<p>When at the end of six weeks he was well enough to leave the
hospital, the house surgeon took him to one side and said:</p>

<p>"Now look here, my friend, we're going to let you out. And
there's no reason why you shouldn't get fairly well again. Only I
want you to understand this: if you touch alcohol again in any
form&mdash;in any case, for years&mdash;well, you might as well put
a bullet through your own head."</p>

<p>In another ten days White was back at business, looking exactly
the same as ever, speaking in the same suave voice. He soon
appeared in the Monitor, but with the utmost courtesy declined all
offers of drinks except ginger-ale. It need hardly be said that to
Mapleson such an event seemed a miracle. He had sunk into a low,
morbid condition from which he had never hoped to rise.</p>

<p>Out of courtesy the first evening Mapleson insisted on drinking
ginger-ale himself, so that his friend should not feel out of
it.</p>

<p>And they sat and had a discussion far into the night, White
giving luminous and precise details of the whole of his illness and
operation, eulogizing hospital methods, and discussing the whole
aspect of society towards therapeutics in a calmly detached
way.</p>

<p>But Mapleson was not happy. He was glad to have White back, but
the element of fear that White had introduced him to was not
eliminated. He felt ill himself, and there somehow seemed a great
gap between White in the old days and White drinking ginger-ale and
talking medicine. For three nights Mapleson kept this up, and then
thought he would have "just a nightcap."</p>

<p>It gradually developed into the position that Mapleson resumed
his whisky and White stuck to his ginger-ale; and it is a curious
fact that this arrangement depressed Mapleson more than it did
White. He drank copiously and more frequently in order to create an
atmosphere of his own; but always there was White looking just the
same, talking just the same.</p>

<p>The ginger-ale got on Mapleson's nerves. He felt that he
couldn't stand it, and a strange and enervating depression began to
creep over him again. For days this arrangement held good, White
seeming utterly indifferent as to what he drank, and Mapleson
getting more and more depressed because White didn't drink whisky.
At length Mapleson suggested one evening that "surely just one"
wouldn't hurt White. But White said with the deepest tone of regret
that he was afraid it would be rather unwise; and as a matter of
fact, he had got used to doing without it that he really hardly
missed it.</p>

<p>From that moment a settled gloom and depression took hold of
Mapleson. He just stood there looking at White and listening to
him, but hardly troubling to speak himself. He felt utterly
wretched. He got into such a state that White began to show a
sympathetic alarm, and one evening toward the end of February, as
they were sitting at their favourite table in the Monitor, White
said, "Well, I'll just have a whisky and soda with you if you
like."</p>

<p>This was one of the happiest evenings of Mapleson's life. As
soon as his friend began to drink, some chord in his own nature
responded; his eyes glowed, he became garrulous and
entertaining.</p>

<p>They had another, and then went to a music-hall, into the
lounge; but there was such a crowd that they could not see the
stage, so they went to the bar at the back and had another drink
and a talk. How they talked that night! They talked about business
and dogs and conscription and women and the empire and tobacco and
the staff of Taunton's. They had a wild orgy of talk and drink.
That night White drank eleven whiskies and sodas, and Mapleson got
cheerfully and gloriously drunk.</p>

<p>It was perhaps as well that the friends enjoyed this
bacchanalia, for it was the last time they met. By four o'clock the
next afternoon White was dead.</p>

<p>Mapleson heard of it the following night. He was leaning against
the fireplace in the Monitor, expatiating upon the wonderful
improvement in White, and extolling his virtues, when young Howard
Aldridge, the junior salesman to Mr. Vincent Pelt of Taunton's,
came in to say that White's brother-in-law had just rung up Mr.
Pelt to say that White was dead. When Mapleson heard this he
muttered, "My Christ!"</p>

<p>These were the last words that Mapleson ever uttered in the bar
of the Monitor.</p>

<p>He picked up his hat and went out into the street. It was the
same feeling of numbed terror and physical sickness that assailed
him. With no plan of action arranged, he surprised his wife by
arriving home before ten o'clock and by going to bed. He was
shivering. She took him up a hot-water bottle and said, "I'm sorry
to hear about White." Mapleson didn't answer, but his teeth
chattered. He lay awake half the night thinking of death.</p>

<p>The next day he got up and went to business as usual, but for
the second time the head of the firm felt it his duty to point out
to him one or two cases of negligence and to warn him that "these
things must not happen in the future."</p>

<p>Two days later Mapleson received a postcard signed by "F.
Peabody," to say that the funeral of the late G. L. White would
take place at such-and-such a church at East Acton, and would leave
the "Elms," Castlereach Road, Acton, at twelve o'clock, and it was
intimated that a seat for Mr. Mapleson would be found in a
carriage.</p>

<p>A fine driving rain out of a leaden sky greeted Mapleson when he
set out for White's funeral on the Saturday. His wife tried to
persuade him not to go, for he was really ill; but he made no
comment. He fiddled about with a time-table, and could come to no
satisfactory decision about the way to get there. His wife
ultimately looked him up a train to Hammersmith, from which
terminus he could get a train. Before reaching Hammersmith a
strange revulsion came over him. Why, after all, should he go to
this funeral? White wouldn't know about it, and what did he know of
White's relatives? A strange choking and giddiness came over him,
and at Hammersmith he found a comfortable refreshment-room, where
he betook himself, and decided that after refreshing he would go on
to business.</p>

<p>After having two whiskies, however, he changed his mind. "No,"
he muttered to himself, "I'll see it through." He boarded a tram
that went in the direction of Acton. He found that he had to change
trams at one point. It seemed an interminable journey. He kept
wondering how White managed to get home at night from Oxford Street
at twelve o'clock. He felt cold and wretched as the effect of the
whisky wore off.</p>

<p>At last he reached Acton, and asked for Castlereach Road. Nobody
seemed to know it. He was directed first in one direction and then
in another; at last a postman put him on the right track, but
suggested that as it was some way, he might get a 'bus to Gaddes
Green, and then it was only about fifteen-minutes' walk.</p>

<p>Mapleson set off, keeping a sharp lookout for a place of
refreshment, for the reactionary spirit was once more upon him. The
'bus put him down at a forlorn-looking corner, where there was only
a sort of workman's ale-house. "I expect I'll pass one on the way,"
he thought, and taking his directions from the assistant of a
greengrocer's shop, he set out once more through the rain.</p>

<p>The farther he went, the meaner and more sordid did the streets
become. He did not pass a single public-house that he felt he could
approach. "I expect the neighbourhood will change soon," he
thought; "I expect I've come the wrong way. Why, everyone said
White must be making at least eight hundred a year. He wouldn't
live in a place like this."</p>

<p>At length he came to a break in the neighbourhood where some
newly-built villas crowded one another on the heels of the more
ancient squalor. An errand boy told him that "Castlereach Road was
the second turning on the right off Goldsmith's Havenue." He found
Goldsmith's Avenue, where a barrel-organ was pouring forth
lugubrious music to an audience listening from the shelter of their
windows, and swarms of dirty children were hurrying through the
rain on nameless errands. A piece of bread and jam was thrown from
a second-story window to a little boy in the street, and missed
Mapleson's hat by inches. His progress was in any case the source
of considerable mirth to the inhabitants.</p>

<p>At last he came to Castlereach Road. After the noise and bustle
of Goldsmith's Avenue, it seemed like the end of the world. It was
a long straight road of buff-coloured villas, with stucco facings
and slate roofs, all identically the same. From the end, where
Mapleson entered it, it looked interminable and utterly deserted.
Doubtless, if it had been a fine day, the gutters would have been
crowded with children; but with the pouring rain, there was not a
soul in sight.</p>

<p>Mapleson blundered on in search of Number 227, and as he did so,
a thought occurred to him that he and White had a common secret
apart. He always had felt in his inmost heart a little ashamed of
his red-brick villa in Willesden Green, and that was one reason why
he had always kept business well apart from domestic affairs; and
White had casually referred to his "place at Acton." His place at
Acton! Mapleson entered it, horribly tired, horribly sober,
horribly wretched. All the blinds were down. It had taken so long
to get there he hoped that he was too late.</p>

<p>A tall, gaunt woman in black, with a slight down on her upper
lip, opened the door. She seemed surprised to see him.</p>

<p>He explained who he was.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. My! you are early. It's only half-past twelve."</p>

<p>"Half-past twelve?" said Mapleson. "But I thought the funeral
was to be at twelve."</p>

<p>Then the gaunt woman called into a little side room:</p>

<p>"'Ere, Uncle Frank, what 'ave you been up to? Did you tell Mr.
Myple that the funeral was at twelve?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't sye that; don't sye that!" came a voice from the
room, and a small man, with sandy hair and wizened features and
small, dark, greedy eyes, came out into the hall. "Oh, don't sye
that, Mr. Mypleson! I'm Peabody. I quite thought I said two
o'clock."</p>

<p>Mapleson had a wild impulse to whistle for a cab or a
fire-engine, and to drive away from this anywhere; but the utter
helplessness of his position held him fast. Before he had time to
give the matter serious thought he was being shown into the
drawing-room, a small stuffy room with a blue floral wallpaper,
bamboo furniture, and many framed photographs, and the gaunt woman
was saying, "Oh, Uncle Frank, how could you have made that
mistyke!" And Uncle Frank was explaining how it might have occurred
and at the same time saying that they must make the best of it;
that Mr. Mapleson would have a bit of lunch. There was a nice cut
of cold leg of mutton, and of course no one, under circumstances
like this, would expect an <i>elaborate</i> meal; in fact, no one
would <i>feel</i> like it, apart from anything else. And then the
gaunt woman left the room, and Mapleson was alone with Uncle
Frank.</p>

<p>Mapleson could not recollect ever having met anyone whom he so
cordially hated at sight. He had a sort of smug perpetual grin, a
habit of running his hands down his thighs as far as his knees, and
giving vent to a curious clicking noise with his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a very sad hoccasion, Mr. Mypleson," he said;
"very sad indeed. Poor George! Did you know him well? Eva&mdash;his
wife, you know&mdash;she's upstairs quite prostrate. That was her
sister who showed you in. Yes, yes, well, how true it is that in
the midst of life we are in death! I'm afraid poor George was
careless, you know. Very careless. Clever, mind you&mdash;clever as
they make 'em, but careless. Do you know, Mr. Mypleson, he hadn't
even insured his life! And he's left no will. There isn't enough to
pay his funeral expenses. Fortunately, Eva's clever; oh, yes, she's
clever with her fingers. They say there's no one in the
neighbourhood to touch her in the millinery. Oh, yes, she's been at
it some time. Why, bless my soul, do you know she's paid the rent
of this 'ouse for the last four years? Oh, she's a clever woman.
Poor soul, though, her great consolation is that George didn't die
in the 'orspital. Yes, Mr. Mypleson, he died upstairs, quiet as a
lamb. She was there at the end. It was a great consolation."</p>

<p>And Uncle Frank nodded his head, and his little eyes sparkled,
but the grin never left his lips. Mapleson said nothing, but the
two men sat there in a sombre silence. Uncle Frank occasionally
nodding his head and muttering, "It's a sad hoccasion."</p>

<p>The rain increased, and it seemed unnaturally dark in the blue
drawing-room, and Mapleson felt that he had sat there an eternity,
consumed by desire to get away, when there was another knock at the
door, and a youth was let in.</p>

<p>Uncle Frank called him Chris, and he seemed to be a cousin, or
some near relative of White's. He was a raw youth who had just gone
to business, and was very much aware of his collar and cuffs. He
seemed to take to Mapleson, and he sat watching him furtively.
Mapleson seemed a man of the world, a very desirable personality.
The youth made many advances, but Mapleson felt a repugnance for
him in only a slightly less degree than in the case of Uncle
Frank.</p>

<p>At length the gaunt sister asked them all into the dining-room,
which was a room on the other side of the passage that seemed even
smaller and stuffier than the drawing-room. It was papered with a
dark red paper, and the woodwork was painted chocolate. As they
crossed the hall, they passed Mrs. White, who had apparently been
persuaded by her sister "to try and take something." She was a
shrivelled little person, with white cheeks, and her eyes were red
with weeping.</p>

<p>She hurried by the men without speaking, and a curious thought
struck Mapleson. During the twenty years or so that he had known
White he could not recollect him speaking of his wife. He probably
had done so, but he could not recollect it. He remembered him
talking about his "place at Acton," but never of his wife. He did
not feel entirely surprised. White was probably ashamed.</p>

<p>In the window of the dining-room were several birdcages,
containing two canaries, a bullfinch, and a small highly-coloured
bird that hopped from the floor of its cage to a perch and kept up
a toneless squeak, with monotonous regularity. Uncle Frank went up
to the cage and tapped the wires, and called out, "Ah, there he is!
<i>Cheep! cheep!</i> This is our little Orstrylian bird, Mr.
Mapleson. Isn't he? Yes, yes; he's our clever little Orstrylian
bird." And during the course of the hurried meal of cold mutton and
cheese the birds formed a constant diversion. Uncle Frank would
continually jump up and call out, "Oh, yes, he's our little
Orstrylian bird."</p>

<p>Mapleson tried to recall whether he had ever discussed birds
with White, and he felt convinced that he had not. It seemed a
strange thing. White apparently had had these birds for some
time&mdash;three different varieties in his own house! Mapleson
would have enjoyed talking about birds with White; he could almost
hear White's voice, and his precise and suave manner of discussing
their ways and peculiarities. And the terrible thought came to him
that he would never hear White talk about birds, never, never. This
breach of confidence on White's part of never telling him that he
kept birds upset Mapleson even more than his breach of confidence
in not talking about his wife.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he's a clever little Orstrylian bird." A terrible
desire came to Mapleson to throw Uncle Frank through the window the
next time he heard this remark.</p>

<p>Before they had finished the meal, three other male relatives
appeared, and a terrible craving came over Mapleson for a drink.
Then the sister came down with a decanter of sherry and said that
perhaps the gentlemen would like a glass. Uncle Frank poured out a
glass all round. It was thin, sickly stuff, and to the brass-bed
manager like a thimbleful of dew in a parched desert. A horrible
feeling of repugnance came over him&mdash;of repugnance against all
these people, against the discomfort he found himself in.</p>

<p>After all, who was White? When all was said and done, White was
really nothing to him, only a man he'd met in the course of
business and had a lot of drinks and talks with. At that moment he
felt he disliked White and all his snivelling relatives.</p>

<p>He wanted to go, to get away from it all; but he couldn't see
how. There was half a glass of sherry left in the decanter. He
unblushingly took it as the funeral cort&egrave;ge arrived. There
were two ramshackle carriages and a hearse, and a crowd of dirty
children had collected. He tried to mumble to Uncle Frank some
excuse for not going, but his words were lost by an intensely
painful scene that took place in the hall as the coffin was brought
down. He did not notice that the sister with the down on her upper
lip became an inspired creature for a few moments, and her face
became almost beautiful.</p>

<p>He felt that he was an alien element among all these people,
that they were nothing to him, and that he was nothing to them, and
he felt an intense, insatiable desire for a drink. If he couldn't
get a drink, he felt he would go mad.</p>

<p>Someone touched him on the arm and said, "Will you come with us
in the second carriage, Mr. Mapleson?" He felt himself walking out
of the house and through a row of dirty children. For a moment he
contemplated bolting up the street and out of sight, but the
feeling that the children would probably follow him and jeer
paralysed this action; and then he was in the carriage, with Chris
and another male relative who was patently moved by the solemnity
of the occasion.</p>

<p>Chris wriggled about and tried to engage him in banal
conversation, with an air that suggested, "Of course, Mr. Mapleson,
this is a sad affair, but we men of the world know how to
behave."</p>

<p>The dismal cort&egrave;ge proceeded at an ambling trot,
occasionally stopping. Chris gave up for the moment trying to be
entertaining, and the forlorn relative talked about funeral
services and the comfort of sympathy in time of bereavement. They
crawled past rows of congested villas and miles of indescribable
domesticity of every kind, till as they were turning round a rather
broader avenue than usual where there were shops, the forlorn
relative said, "We shall be in the cemetery in five minutes."</p>

<p>And then Mapleson had an inspiration. They were ambling along
this dreary thoroughfare when his eye suddenly caught sight of a
large and resplendent public-house. It was picked out in two shades
of green, and displayed a gilt sign-board denoting "The Men of
Kent."</p>

<p>Almost without thinking, and certainly in less time than it
takes to chronicle, Mapleson muttered something to his two
companions, and called out of the window to the driver to stop. He
then jumped out, and called out to the driver of the hearse and the
other carriage to stop, and then before anyone realized what it was
all about, he darted into the saloon bar of The Men of Kent!</p>

<p>The bar was fortunately empty, but through the little glass
shutters two women and a man in the private bar watched the
performance.</p>

<p>There was a moment of dazed surprise, followed by a high shriek
of laughter and a woman's voice in strident crescendo:</p>

<p>"He's stopped the funeral to come in an' 'ave a drink! O my
Gawd!" Mapleson's tongue seemed to cling to the roof of his mouth,
but he gasped out an order for a whisky and soda. To the barman
these incidents were nothing, and he served the drink instantly;
but to the three in the private bar it was a matter of intense
enjoyment. The other woman took it up.</p>

<p>"Well, that's the first time I've known that 'appen. Gawd! fancy
stoppin' a funeral to come and 'ave a drink!" Then the man bawled
out: "'Ere, I sye, ain't the others comin' in? Let's make a dye of
it."</p>

<p>The women continued shrieking with laughter, and the appalling
ignominy of his position came home to him. He knew that he was
damned in the eyes of White's friends.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the thought of White had passed out of his
mind altogether. He was a thing in revolt against society, without
feelings and without principles.</p>

<p>Yet when the whisky was put in front of him his hand trembled,
and he could not drink it. He fumbled with the glass, threw down a
sixpence, and darted out of the bar again.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Uncle Frank and other members of the funeral
party had got out of the carriages and were having a whispered
consultation on the curb. Instructions had evidently been given for
the cort&egrave;ge to proceed, for Uncle Frank was talking to the
driver of the hearse when Mapleson appeared.</p>

<p>As all returned to the carriages, the three people came out of
the bar and raised a cheer, and one of the women called out, "Oh, I
sye, don't go!"</p>

<p>Mapleson lay all of a heap in the corner of the carriage, and he
noticed that he was alone with Chris. The forlorn relative had gone
into the other carriage.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they arrived at a church, a large new building
with Early Victorian Gothic arches and a profusion of coloured
glass. The funeral party huddled together in the gloom of the large
church, and somehow the paucity of their numbers seemed even more
depressing than the wretchedness of their appearance.</p>

<p>Mapleson sat a little way back, and curiously enough his mind
kept reverting during the service to the little birds. He felt a
distinct grievance against White on account of the little birds.
Why hadn't he told him, especially about the small Australian bird?
It would have made a distinctly interesting subject of
conversation.</p>

<p>The service seemed interminably long, and it was a relief when
the tall, rather good-looking young clergyman led the way out into
the cemetery. The rain was still driving in penetrating gusts, and
as they stood by the grave-side, the relatives looked askance at
one another, uncertain whether it was the proper thing to do to
hold up an umbrella. As to Mapleson, he was indifferent. For one
thing, he had not brought an umbrella; but it seemed frightfully
cold.</p>

<p>They lowered the coffin into the grave and earth was sprinkled.
For a second it flashed through his mind, "That's White being let
down," and then a feeling of indifference and repugnance followed,
and the craving desire to get away from all these sordid
happenings. Then he suddenly thought of White's wife. "A
miserable-looking slattern she was," he thought. "Why, what was
<i>she</i> snivelling about? What could she have been to White or
White to her? Why, he never mentioned her during twenty years!"</p>

<p>He experienced a slight feeling of relief when the service was
finished and the party broke up, and he hastily made for the
cemetery gates, knowing that White's friends would be as anxious to
avoid him as he was to avoid them; but he had not reached them
before some one, hurrying up behind, caught him. It was Chris.</p>

<p>"I expect you're going up west, Mr. Mapleson," he said. "If it's
not putting myself in the way, I'll come too."</p>

<p>Mapleson gave an inarticulate grunt that conveyed nothing at
all; but the young man was not to be put off.</p>

<p>There was something about the bulk of Mapleson and the pendulous
lines of his clothes and person that made Chris feel, when he was
walking with him, that he was "knocking about town" and "mixing
with the world." He himself was apprenticed to a firm of wallpaper
manufacturers and he felt that Mapleson would be able to enlighten
him on the prospects and the outlook of the furnishing and
decorating trade. He talked gaily of antique furniture till they
came to a gaunt yellow-brick station.</p>

<p>On enquiry, there seemed to be no trains that went from it to
any recognizable or habitable spot, but outside were two melancholy
hackney-carriages. By this time Mapleson was desperate, and a
strange feeling of giddiness possessed him.</p>

<p>He got in, and told the driver vaguely "to drive up to London."
Chris came to the rescue, and explained to him that he might drive
to Shepherd's Bush first. They started off, and rattled once more
through the wilderness of dreary villas.</p>

<p>The young man accepted the position he found himself in with
perfect composure. He attributed Mapleson's silence to an expansive
boredom, and he talked with discretion and with a sort of callow
tact. Before they reached Shepherd's Bush, however, Mapleson
muttered something about feeling faint, and Chris immediately
suggested that they should go and have a drink. "You might bring me
something in," said Mapleson. "I'll have a brandy neat." They drove
helplessly through neat avenues and roads for nearly ten minutes
without passing anything in the way of a public-house. At last they
came to a grocer's shop licensed to sell spirits not to be consumed
on the premises. "Go and buy me a bottle of brandy," said Mapleson.
The young man got out, and soon returned with a six-and-sixpenny
bottle of brandy and a corkscrew. He paid for it himself, relying
on the natural honour of Mapleson to settle up afterwards; but the
matter was never mentioned again.</p>

<p>He drew the cork, and Mapleson took a long drink, and then wiped
the mouth of the bottle and offered it to Chris. Chris behaved like
a man, and also took a draught, but spluttered rather.</p>

<p>For the rest of the journey Mapleson at regular intervals took
thoughtful and meditative drinks, and gradually began to revive. He
went so far as to ask Chris if he knew anything about the little
birds, and how long White had had them. Chris said he knew he had
had the canaries for four or five years and the bullfinch for two
years. He didn't know much about the little Australian bird. This
information seemed to cause Mapleson to revert to his former
gloom.</p>

<p>When they reached Shepherd's Bush the cabman refused to go
farther. So they got out, and entered another cab, Mapleson
carrying the brandy-bottle under his arm. He took it upon himself
to tell the cabman&mdash;this time a taxi&mdash;to "drive round the
Outer Circle of Hyde Park, and to take the hood down."</p>

<p>It was about half-past four when they reached Hyde Park, and the
rain had ceased a little. It was the fashionable hour for the
afternoon drive. Magnificent motors and two-horse phaetons were
ambling round well within the regulation limit. Their cab was soon
almost hemmed in by the equipages of the great world. But after
they had completed the circle once, and Mapleson lay back, with his
feet on the opposite seat and his hat brushed the wrong way, and
without the slightest compunction held the large brandy-bottle to
his lips every few yards, Chris began to feel that there was a
limit to his desire to "mix with the world."</p>

<p>He got the cab to stop near the Marble Arch, and explained to
Mapleson that he must get out and take the Tube to business.</p>

<hr>

<p>And then there was a scene. Mapleson, who up to that time had
not addressed a personal word to Chris, suddenly became maudlin. He
cried, and said that he had never taken to anyone as he had to
Chris. He was the dearest fellow in the world; he mustn't leave
him; now that White was dead, he was the only friend he had.</p>

<p>But people began to collect on the side-walk, and Chris simply
ran off. The taxi-driver began to be suspicious about his fare,
which was registered fourteen shillings. But Mapleson gave him a
sovereign on account, and told him to drive to Cleopatra's Needle,
on the Embankment.</p>

<p>By the time they reached there, the brandy-bottle was
three-quarters empty, and tears were streaming down his cheeks. He
offered the driver a drink, but the driver was "not one of that
sort," and gruffly suggested that Mapleson "had better drive 'ome."
So he got out of the cab pathetically, settled with the driver, and
sat on a seat of the Embankment, hugging his bottle and staring at
the river.</p>

<p>Now, it is very difficult to know exactly what Mapleson did the
rest of that afternoon between the time when he dismissed the
cabman and half-past eight, when he turned up in the bar of the
Monitor.</p>

<p>It is only known that he struggled in there at that time,
looking as white as a sheet. He was wet through, and his clothes
were covered with mud. He struggled across to the corner where he
and White used to sit, and sat down. The bar was fairly crowded at
the time, and young Chris made his d&eacute;but there. He felt that
he would be a person of interest. When Mapleson appeared, he went
up to him, but Mapleson didn't know him, and said nothing.</p>

<p>Several others came up and advised Mapleson to go home and
change his clothes and have a drink first; but he just stared
stupidly ahead and made no comment. Someone brought some whisky and
put it before him, but he ignored it. They then came to the
conclusion that he was ill, so they sent for a cab, and two of them
volunteered to see him home.</p>

<p>Just as they were about to lead him out he stood up. He then
stretched out his arms and waved them away. He picked up the glass
of whisky and raised it slowly to his lips; but before it reached
them, he dropped it, and fell backward across the table.</p>

<hr>

<p>"Women, you know," said Charlie Maybird some months later,
addressing two friends in the Monitor, "are silly creatures. They
think love and friendship is all a question of kissin' and
cuddlin'. They think business is all buyin' and sellin'; they don't
think men can make friendships in business. Crikey! I reckon
there's more friendships made in business&mdash;real friendships, I
mean&mdash;than ever there is outside. Look at the case of White
and Mapleson. I tell you, those two men loved each other. For over
twenty years they were inseparable; there was nothing they would
not have done for each other; hand and glove they was over
everything. I've never seen a chap crumple up so as Mapleson did
when White died, in fact from the very day when White was took ill.
He went about like a wraith. I'll never forget that night when he
came in here after the funeral. He sat over
there&mdash;look&mdash;by the fireplace. He looked as though his
'eart was broken. Suddenly he stood up and lifted his glass, and
then dropped it, and then fell backwards crash on to the floor.
They took him to the 'orspital, but he never regained
consciousness. The doctors said it was fatty degeneration of the
'eart, 'elped on by some kidney trouble; but I know better. He died
of a broken 'eart. Lord, yes; I tell you, there's a lot of romance
in the furnishing trade."</p>

<p>"Did he leave any money?" asked one of the friends.</p>

<p>"My word, yes; more than White," answered the genial Charles.
"White never left a bean, and it seems his missus had not only been
paying the rent out of her millinery, but allowed White some. White
was a card, he was."</p>

<p>"And what did Mapleson leave?"</p>

<p>"Mapleson left nearly four pounds."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Four pounds and a wife and five kids, the eldest twelve."</p>

<p>"A wife and five kids! How the hell does she manage to keep
things going?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Gawd knows! Come, let's go over to the Oxford and see
what's on."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch09" id="ch09"></a>9. THE LANDLORD OF "THE
LOVE-A-DUCK"</h2>

<p>I forget the name of the wag in our town who first called him
Mr. Seldom Right, but the name caught on. His proper name was James
Selden Wright, and the inference of this obvious misnomer was too
good to drop. James was invariably wrong, but so lavishly,
outrageously, magnificently wrong that he invariably carried the
thing through with flying colours. He was a kind of Tartarin of
Tibbelsford, which was the name of the town.</p>

<p>Everything about Mr. Seldom Right was big, impressive,
expansive. He himself was an enormous person, with fat, puffy
cheeks with no determinate line between them and his innumerable
chins. His large grey eyes with their tiny pupils seemed to embrace
the whole universe in a glance. Upon his pendulous front there
dangled thick gold chains with signets and seals like miniature
flat-irons. His fingers were ribbed with gold bands like
curtain-rings. His wife was big; his daughter was big; the great
shire horses which worked on his adjoining farm seemed quite normal
creatures in this Gargantuan scheme of things.</p>

<p>Above all, "The Love-a-duck" was big. It appeared to dominate
the town. It was built at the top of the hill, with great rambling
corridors, bars, coffee-rooms, dilapidated ball-rooms, staircases
of creaking deal, bedrooms where a four-post bed was difficult to
find, a cobbled courtyard with a covered entrance drive where two
brewer's drays could have driven through abreast. There was no
social function, no town council, no committee of importance that
was not driven to meet at "The Love-a-duck." But the biggest thing
in Tibbelsford was the voice of the landlord. At night amidst the
glittering taps and tankards he would "preside." By this you must
understand that the word be taken liberally. He was no ordinary
potman to hand mugs of ale across the bar to thirsty carters, or
nips of gin to thin-lipped clerks. He would not appear till the
evening was well advanced, and then he would stroll in and lean
against the bar, his sleepy eyes adjusting the various phenomena of
this perspective to a comfortable focus.</p>

<p>And then the old cronies and characters of Tibbelsford would
touch their hats and say:</p>

<p>"'Evening, Mr. Wright!"</p>

<p>And he would nod gravely, like an Emperor receiving the fealty
of his serfs. And a stranger might whisper:</p>

<p>"Who is this fat old guy?"</p>

<p>And the answer would be "H'sh!" for the eyes of Mr. Seldom Right
missed nothing. Bumptious strangers were treated with complete
indifference. If they addressed him, he looked right through them,
and breathed heavily. But for the cronies and characters there was
a finely-adjusted scale of treatment, a subtle undercurrent of
masonry. To get into favour with Mr. Seldom Right one had to work
one's way up, and any bad mistake would land one back among the
strangers. In which case one would be served fairly and squarely,
but there the matter would end. For it should be stated at this
point that everything about "The Love-a-duck" was good in quality,
and lavish in quantity, and the rooms, in spite of their great
size, were always spotlessly clean.</p>

<p>Having carefully considered the relative values of this human
panorama, the landlord would single out some individual fortunate
enough to catch his momentary favour, and in a voice which seemed
to make the glasses tremble and the little Chelsea figures on the
high mantelshelf gasp with surprise, he would exclaim:</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Topsmith, and how are we? Right on the top o' life?
Full of beans, bone, blood and benevolence, eh? Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>And the laugh would clatter among the tankards, twist the
gas-bracket, go rolling down the corridor, and make the dogs bark
in the kennels beyond the stables. And Mr. Topsmith would naturally
blush, and spill his beer, and say:</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, sir, nothin' to grumble about; pretty good goin'
altogether."</p>

<p>"That's right! that's RIGHT!"</p>

<p>There were plenty of waitresses and attendants at "The
Love-a-duck," but however busy the bars might be, the landlord
himself always dined with his wife and daughter, at seven-thirty
precisely, in the oblong parlour at the back of the saloon bar. And
they dined simply and prodigiously. A large steaming leg of mutton
would be carried in, and in twenty minutes' time would return a
forlorn white fragment of bone. Great dishes of fried potatoes,
cabbages, and marrow, would all vanish. A Stilton cheese would come
back like an over-explored ruin of some ancient Assyrian town. And
Mine Host would mellow these simple delicacies with three or four
tankards of old ale. Occasionally some of the cronies and
characters were invited to join the repast, but whoever was there,
the shouts and laughter of the landlord rang out above everything,
only seconded by the breezy giggles of Mrs. Wright, whose voice
would be constantly heard exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Oh, Jim, you are a fule!"</p>

<p>It was when the dinner was finished that the landlord emerged
into the president. He produced a long churchwarden and ambled
hither and thither, with a pompous, benevolent, consciously
proprietary air. The somewhat stilted formality of his first
appearance expanded into a genial but autocratic courtliness. He
was an Edwardian of Edwardians. He would be surprisingly gracious,
tactful and charming, and he also had that Hanoverian faculty of
seeing right through one&mdash;a perfectly crushing mannerism.</p>

<p>By slow degrees he would gently shepherd his favourite flock
around the fire in the large bar-parlour, decorated with stags'
heads, pewter and old Chelsea. Then he would settle himself in the
corner of the inglenook by the right side of the fire. Perhaps at
this time I may be allowed to enumerate a few of the unbreakable
rules which the novice had to learn by degrees. They were as
follows:</p>

<p>You must always address the landlord as "sir."</p>

<p>You must never interrupt him in the course of a story.</p>

<p>You must never appear to disbelieve him.</p>

<p>You must never tell a bigger lie than he has just told.</p>

<p>If he offers you a drink you must accept it.</p>

<p>You must never, under any circumstances, offer to stand him a
drink in return.</p>

<p>You may ask his opinion about anything, but never any question
about his personal affairs.</p>

<p>You may disagree with him, but you must not let him think that
you're not taking him seriously.</p>

<p>You must not get drunk.</p>

<p>These were the broad, abstract rules. There were other bye-laws
and covenants allowing for variable degrees of interpretation.
That, for instance, which governed the improper story. A story
could be suggestive but must never be flagrantly vulgar or profane.
Also one might have had enough to drink to make one garrulous, but
not enough to be boisterous, or maudlin, or even over-familiar.</p>

<p>I have stated that the quality of fare supplied at "The
Love-a-duck" was excellent; and so it was. Beyond that, however,
our landlord had his own special reserves. There was a little
closet just off the central bar where on occasions he would
suddenly disappear, and when in the humour produce some special
bottle of old port or liqueur. He would come toddling with it back
to his seat and exclaim:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, this is the birthday of Her Imperial Highness the
Princess Eulalie of Spain. I must ask you to drink her good health
and prosperity!"</p>

<p>And the bar, who had never heard of the Princess Eulalie of
Spain, would naturally do so with acclamation.</p>

<p>Over the little glasses he would tell most impressive and
incredible stories. He had hunted lions with the King of Abyssinia.
He had dined with the Czar of Russia. He had been a drummer-boy
during the North and South war in America. He had travelled all
over Africa, Spain, India, China and Japan. There was no crowned
head in either of the hemispheres with whom he was not familiar. He
knew everything there was to know about diamonds, oil, finance,
horses, politics, Eastern religions, ratting, dogs, geology, women,
political economy, tobacco, corn or rubber. He was a prolific
talker, but he did not object to listening, and he enjoyed an
argument. In every way he was a difficult man to place. Perhaps in
thinking of him one was apt not to make due allowance for the
rather drab background against which his personality stood out so
vividly. One must first visualise the company of "The
Love-a-duck."</p>

<p>There was old Hargreaves, the local estate agent: a snuffy,
gingery, pinched old ruffian, with a pretty bar-side manner, an
infinite capacity for listening politely; one whose nature had been
completely bowdlerised by years of showing unlikely tenants over
empty houses, and keeping cheerful in draughty passages. There was
Mr. Bean, the corn-merchant, with a polished red-blue face and no
voice. He would sit leaning forward on a thin gold-knobbed cane,
and as the evening advanced he seemed to melt into one vast
ingratiating smile. One dreaded every moment that the stick would
give way and that he would fall forward on his face. There was an
argumentative chemist, whose name I have forgotten; he was a
keen-faced man, and he wore gold-rimmed spectacles which made him
look much cleverer than he really was. There was old Phene
Sparfitt. Nobody knew how he lived. He was very old, much too old
to be allowed out at night, but quite the most regular and
persistent customer. He drank quantities of gin and water, his
lower lip was always moist, and he professed an intimate knowledge
of the life of birds. Dick Toom, the owner of the local
livery-stables, was a spasmodic visitor. He generally came
accompanied by several horsey-looking gentlemen. He always talked
breezily about some distressing illness he was suffering from, and
would want to make a bet with anyone present about some quite
ridiculous proposition: for instance, that the distance from the
crossroads to the stone wall by Jenkins' black-pig farm was greater
than the distance from the fountain in the middle of Piccadilly
Circus to the tube station in Dover Street. A great number of these
bets took place in the bar, and the fact that the landlord always
lost was one of the reasons of his nickname.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that the general standard of intelligence
reached a very high level, and against it it was difficult to tell
quite how intelligent the landlord was. If he were not a
well-educated man he certainly had more than a veneer of education.
In an argument he was seldom extended. Sometimes he talked
brilliantly for a moment, and then seemed to talk out of his hat.
He had an extravagant theatrical way of suddenly declaiming a
statement, and then sinking his voice and repeating it. Sometimes
he would be moodish and not talk at all. But at his best he was
very good company.</p>

<p>It would be idle to pretend that the frequenters of the bar
believed the landlord's stories. On the contrary, I'm afraid we
were a very sceptical lot. Most of us had never been further than
London or the seaside, and our imagination shied at episodes in
Rajahs' palaces and receptions in Spanish courts. It became a
byword in the town: "Have you heard old Seldom Right's latest?"
Nevertheless he was extremely popular. At the time of which I write
the landlord must have been well over sixty years of age, and his
wife was possibly forty-five. They appeared to be an extremely
happy and united family.</p>

<p>And then Septimus Stourway appeared on the scene. He was an
acid, angular, middle-aged man, with sharp features, a heavy black
moustache, and eyes too close together. He was a chartered
accountant and he came to the town to audit the books of a large
brewery near by, and one or two other concerns. He brought his wife
and his son, who was eleven years old. He was a man whom everybody
disliked from the very beginning. He was probably clever at his
job, quick-thinking, self-opinionated, precise, argumentative,
aggressively assertive, and altogether objectionable.</p>

<p>The very first occasion on which he visited "The Love-a-duck" he
broke every rule of the masonic ring except the one which concerned
getting drunk. The company was in session under its president, and
he bounced into the circle and joined in the conversation. He
interrupted the landlord in the middle of a story, and plainly
hinted that he didn't believe him. He called him "old chap," and
offered to stand him a drink. He then told a long, boring story
about some obscure episode in his own life. The effect of this
intrusion was that the landlord, who never replied to him at all,
rose heavily from his seat and disappeared. The rest of the company
tried to show by their chilling unresponsiveness that they
disapproved of him. But Mr. Stourway was not the kind of person to
be sensitive to this. He rattled on, occasionally taking tiny sips
of his brandy-and-water. He even had the audacity to ask old
Hargreaves who the fat disagreeable old buffer was! And poor old
Hargreaves was so upset that he nearly cried. He could only murmur
feebly:</p>

<p>"He's the landlord."</p>

<p>"H'm! a nice sort of landlord! Now, I know a landlord
at&mdash;"</p>

<p>The company gradually melted away and left the stranger to sip
his brandy-and-water alone.</p>

<p>Everybody hoped, of course, that the first visit would also be
the last. But oh, no! The next evening, at the same time, in
bounced Mr. Septimus Stourway, quite uncrushed. Again the landlord
disappeared, and the company melted away. The third night some of
them tried snubbing him and being rude, but it had no effect at
all. At every attempt of this sort he merely laughed in his empty
way, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, just listen to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before a week was out Mr. Septimus Stourway began to get on the
nerves of the town. He swaggered about the streets as though he was
doing us a great honour by being there at all. His wife and son
were also seen. His wife was a tall, vinegary looking woman in a
semi-fashionable, semi-sporting get-up. She wore a monocle and a
short skirt, and carried a cane. The boy was a spectacled,
round-shouldered, unattractive-looking youth, more like the mother
than the father in appearance. He never seemed to leave his
mother's side for an instant.</p>

<p>It appeared that his name was Nick, and that he was the most
remarkable boy for his age who had ever lived. He knew Latin, and
Greek, and French, and history, and mathematics, and philosophy,
and science. Also he had a beautiful nature. Mr. Stourway spent
hours boring anyone he could get to listen, with the narration of
his son's marvellous attributes. If the <i>habitu&eacute;s</i> of
"The Love-a-duck" tired of Mr. Stourway, they became thoroughly fed
up with his son.</p>

<p>It was on the following Wednesday evening that the dramatic
incident happened in the bar-parlour of the famous inn. The
landlord had continued his attitude of utter indifference to the
interloper. He had been just as cheerful and entertaining, only
when Mr. Stourway entered the bar he simply dried up. But during
the last two days he appeared to be thinking abstractedly about
something. He was annoyed.</p>

<p>On this Wednesday evening the usual company had again assembled,
and the landlord appeared anxious to resume his former position of
genial host, when in came Mr. Septimus Stourway again. He had not
been in the previous evening, and everyone was hoping that at last
he had realised that he was not wanted. Up rose the landlord at
once, and went away. There was an almost uncontrolled groan from
the rest. Mr. Stourway took his seat, and began to talk
affably.</p>

<p>It was then observed that the landlord instead of going right
away, was hovering about behind the bar. I don't know how the
conversation got round to poetry, but after a time, Mr. Stourway
started talking about his son's marvellous memory for poetry.</p>

<p>"That boy of mine, you know," he said, "he would simply astound
you. He remembers everything. The poetry he's learnt off by heart!
Miles and miles of it! I don't suppose there's another boy of his
age in the country who could quote half as much."</p>

<p>It was then that the bombshell fell. The landlord was leaning
across the bar, and suddenly his enormous voice rang out:</p>

<p>"I'll bet you five pounds to one that I know a little boy of
five who could quote twice as much poetry as your son!"</p>

<p>There was a dead silence, and everybody looked from the landlord
to Mr. Stourway. That gentleman grinned superciliously, then he
rubbed his hands together and said:</p>

<p>"Well, well, that's interesting. I can't believe it. My son's
eleven. A boy of five? Ha, ha! I'd like to get a wager like
that!"</p>

<p>The landlord's voice, louder than ever, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I'll bet you a hundred pounds to five!"</p>

<p>Mr. Stourway looked slightly alarmed, but his eyes
glittered.</p>

<p>"A hundred pounds to five! I'm not a betting man, but, by God!
I'll take that."</p>

<p>"Is your son shy?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, he enjoys reciting poetry."</p>

<p>"Would he come here and have an open competition?"</p>

<p>"H'm. Well, well, I don't know. He might. I should have to ask
his mother. Who is this wonderful boy you speak of?"</p>

<p>"My nephew over at Chagham. They could drive him over in the
dog-cart."</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that the members of "The Love-a-duck"
fraternity were worked up to a great state of excitement over this
sudden challenge. What did it all mean? No one knew that old Seldom
Right had any relatives in the country. But then he was always such
a secretive old boy about his own affairs. Could a little boy of
five possibly remember and repeat more poetry&mdash;twice as
much!&mdash;than this phenomenal Nick Stourway? How was it all to
be arranged?</p>

<p>It became evident, however, that the landlord was very much in
earnest. He had apparently thought out all the details. It should
be an open competition. It could take place in the ball-room of the
hotel. The two boys should stand on the platform with their
parents, and should recite poems or blank verse in turn. A small
committee of judges should count the lines. When one had exhausted
his complete r&eacute;pertoire the other, of course, would have
won; but it would be necessary for Stephen&mdash;that was the name
of old Wright's nephew&mdash;to go on for double the number of
lines that Nick had spoken to win the wager for his uncle.</p>

<p>When it was first put to him, Mr. Stourway looked startled but
on going into the details he soon became eager. It was the easiest
way of making a hundred pounds he had ever encountered. Of course
the little boy might be clever and have a good memory, but that he
could possibly recite <i>twice</i> as much as the wonderful Nick
was unthinkable. Moreover his back was up, and he hated the
landlord. He knew that he snubbed him on every occasion, and this
would be an opportunity to score. There was just the mild risk of
losing a fiver, and his wife to be talked over, but&mdash;he
thought he could persuade her. The rumour of the competition spread
like wildfire all over the town.</p>

<p>It was not only the chief topic of conversation at "The
Love-a-duck" but at all places where men met and talked. It cannot
be denied that a considerable number of bets were made. Mr. Seldom
Right's tremendous optimism found him many supporters, but the
great odds and the fact that he invariably lost in wagers of this
sort drove many into the opposing camp of backers.</p>

<p>A committee of ways and means was appointed the following night
after Mrs. Septimus Stourway had given her consent and Nick had
signified his willingness to display his histrionic abilities to a
crowd of admirers.</p>

<p>Old Hargreaves, Mr. Bean, and a schoolmaster named McFarlane
were appointed the judges. The ball-room was to be open to anyone,
and there was to be no charge for admission. The date of the
competition was fixed for the following Saturday afternoon, at five
o'clock.</p>

<p>I must now apologise for intruding my own personality into this
narrative. I would rather not do so, but it is inevitable. It is
true my part in the proceedings was only that of a spectator, but
from your point of view&mdash;and from mine&mdash;it was an
exceedingly important part. I must begin with the obvious
confession that I had visited "The Love-a-duck" on occasions, and
that is the kind of adventure that one naturally doesn't make too
much of. Nevertheless I can say with a clear conscience that I was
not one of the inner ring. I had so far only made the most
tentative efforts to get into the good graces of the landlord. But
everyone in Tibbelsford was talking of the forthcoming remarkable
competition, and I naturally made a point of turning up in good
time.</p>

<p>I managed to get a seat in the fourth row, and I was very
fortunate, for the ball-room was packed, and a more remarkable
competition I have never attended. The three judges sat in the
front row, facing the platform. The Stourway party occupied the
right side of the platform and the Wrights the left. The landlord
sat with his party, but in the centre, so that he could act as a
kind of chairman. He appeared to be in high good-humour, and he
came on first and made a few facetious remarks before the
performance began. In the first place, he apologised for the
lighting. It was certainly very bad. There originally had been
footlights, but it was so long since they had been used that they
were out of repair. The large room was only lighted by a gas
chandelier in the centre, so that the stage was somewhat dim, but,
as he explained, this would only help to obscure the blushes of the
performers when they received the plaudits of such a distinguished
gathering.</p>

<p>The Stourway party entered first. They came in from a door at
the back of the platform, Mr. Stourway noisily nonchalant, talking
to everyone at random, in a tailcoat, with grey spats; his wife in
a sports skirt and a small hat, looking rather bored and disgusted;
and the boy in an Eton jacket and collar with a bunchy tie, and his
hair neatly brushed. He looked very much at home and confident. It
was obvious that he was out to enjoy himself. Numerous
prize-distributions at which he had played a conspicuous part had
evidently inured him to such an ordeal.</p>

<p>And then the other party entered, and the proceedings seemed
likely to end before they had begun. Mrs. Wright came on first,
followed by a lady dressed in black, leading a most diminutive boy.
They only reached the door when apparently the sight of the large
audience frightened the small person, and he began to cry. The
landlord and his wife rushed up and with the mother tried to
encourage him, and after a few minutes they succeeded in doing so.
The lady in black, however&mdash;who was presumably the widowed
mother&mdash;picked him up and carried him in and sat him on her
knee.</p>

<p>The audience became keenly excited, and everyone was laughing
and discussing whether the affair would materialise or not. At
length they seemed to be arranged, and the landlord came forward
and said:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce you to the
competitors&mdash;Master Nick Stourway, Master Stephen Wright. Good
gracious! It sounds as though I were announcing the competitors in
a prize-ring. But this is to be a very peaceful
competition&mdash;at least, I hope so! I think you all know the
particulars. We're simply going to enjoy ourselves, aren't we,
Nick? Aren't we, Stephen?"</p>

<p>Nick smiled indulgently, and said, "Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Stephen glanced up at him for a second, and then buried his face
in his mother's lap.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the landlord, "I will now call on Master Nick
to open the ball."</p>

<p>Master Nick was nothing loth. He stood up and bowed, and holding
his right arm stiff, and twiddling a button of his waistcoat with
his left, he declaimed in ringing tones:</p>

<p class="poem">"It was the schooner <i>Hesperus</i><br>
That sailed the wintry sea;<br>
And the skipper had taken his little daughter<br>
To bear him company."</p>

<p>There were twenty-two verses of this, of four lines each, and
the audience were somewhat impatient, because they had not come
there to hear Master Nick recite. They had come for the
competition, and it was still an open question whether there would
be any competition. They were anxiously watching Master Stephen. He
spent most of the period of his rival's recitation of this long
poem with his face buried in his mother's lap, in the dark corner
of the platform. His mother stroked his hair and kept on whispering
a word to him, and occasionally he would peer round at Nick and
watch him for a few seconds; then he glanced at the audience, and
immediately ducked out of sight again.</p>

<p>When Nick had finished, he bowed and sat down, and there was a
mild round of applause. The judges consulted, and agreed that he
had scored 88 lines.</p>

<p>Now, what was going to happen?</p>

<p>The small boy seemed to be shaking his head and stamping his
feet, and his mother was talking to him. The landlord coughed. He
was obviously a little nervous. He went over to the group and said
in a cheerful voice:</p>

<p>"Now, Stephen, tell us a poem!"</p>

<p>A little piping voice said, "No!" and there were all the
wriggles and shakes of the recalcitrant youngster. Murmurs ran
round the room, and a lot of people were laughing. The Stourway
party was extremely amused. At length the landlord took a chair
near him, and produced a long stick of barley-sugar.</p>

<p>"Now, Stephen," he said, "if you won't talk to these naughty
people, tell <i>me</i> a poem. Tell me that beautiful 'Hymn to
Apollo' that you told me last winter."</p>

<p>The little boy looked up at him and grinned; then he looked at
his mother. Her widow's veil covered the upper part of her face.
She kissed him, and said:</p>

<p>"Go on, dear; tell Uncle Jim."</p>

<p>There was a pause; the small boy looked up and down, and then,
fixing his eyes solemnly on the landlord's face, he suddenly began
in a queer little lisping voice:</p>

<p class="poem">God of the golden bow,<br>
And of the golden lyre,<br>
And of the golden hair,<br>
And of the golden fire;<br>
Charioteer<br>
Round the patient year,<br>
Where&mdash;where slept thine ire?</p>

<p>It was a short poem, but its rendering was received with
vociferous applause. There was going to be a competition, after
all! People who had money at stake were laughing and slapping their
legs, and people who hadn't were doing the same. Everyone was on
the best of terms with each other. There was a certain amount of
trouble with the judges, as they didn't know the poem, and they
didn't grasp the length of the lines. Fortunately the schoolmaster
had come armed with books, and after some discussion the poem was
found to have been written by Keats, and Master Stephen was awarded
thirty-six lines. He was cheered, clapped, and kissed by the
landlord, and his aunt, and his mother.</p>

<p>Master Nick's reply to this was to recite "The Pied Piper of
Hamelin," a performance which bored everyone to tears, especially
as he would persist in gesticulating and doing it in a manner as
though he thought that the people had simply come to hear his
performance. "The Pied Piper of Hamelin" is 195 lines. This made
his score 283.</p>

<p>The small boy was still very shy, and seemed disinclined to
continue, but the landlord said:</p>

<p>"Now come on, Stephen; I'm sure you remember some more beautiful
poetry."</p>

<p>At last, to everyone's surprise, he began to lisp:</p>

<p class="poem">"Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once
more&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was screamingly funny. He went right through the speech, and
when he got to:</p>

<p class="poem">"Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint
George!'"</p>

<p>the applause was deafening. People were calling out, and some of
the barrackers had to be rebuked by the landlord. King Henry's
speech was only 35 lines, so Master Stephen's total was 71. Nick
then retaliated with an appalling poem, which commenced:</p>

<p class="poem">She stood at the bar of Justice,<br>
A creature wan and wild,<br>
In form too small for a woman,<br>
In feature too old for a child.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it was not quite as long as the other two, and only
brought him 60 lines, making a total of 343.</p>

<p>Stephen, who seemed to be gaining a little more confidence and
entering into the spirit of the thing, replied with Robert
Herrick's "Ode to a Daffodil," a charming little effort, although
it only brought in 20 lines.</p>

<p>Master Nick now broke into Shakespeare, and let himself go
on:</p>

<p class="poem">"Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your
ears."</p>

<p>He only did twenty-three lines, however, before he broke down
and forgot. The committee had arranged for this. It was agreed,
that in the event of either competitor breaking down, he should
still score the lines up to where he broke down, and at the end he
should be allowed to quote odd lines, provided there were more than
one.</p>

<p>At this point there was a very amusing incident. Master Stephen
hesitated for some time, and then <i>he</i> began "Friends Romans,
countrymen," etc., and he went right through the same speech
without a slip! It was the first distinct score for the landlord's
party, and Master Stephen was credited with 128 lines. The scores,
however, were still 366 to 219 in Nick's favour, and he proceeded
to pile on the agony by reciting "Beth Gelert." However, at the end
of the twelfth verse he again forgot, and only amassed 48
lines.</p>

<p>Balanced against his mother's knee, and looking unutterably
solemn&mdash;as far as one could see in the dim light&mdash;and
only occasionally glancing at the audience, Stephen then recited a
charming poem by William Blake called "Night," which also contained
48 lines.</p>

<p>Nick then collected 40 lines with "Somebody's Darling," and as a
contrast to this sentimental twaddle Stephen attempted Wordsworth's
"Ode on Intimations of Immortality." Unfortunately it was his turn
to break down, but not till he had notched 92 lines. It was quite a
feature of the afternoon that whereas Nick's contributions for the
most part were the utmost trash, Stephen only did good things.</p>

<p>It would perhaps be tedious to chronicle the full details of the
poems attempted and the exact number of lines scored, although, as
a matter of fact, at the time I did keep a careful record. But on
that afternoon it did not appear tedious, except when Nick let
himself go rather freely over some quite commonplace verse. Even
then there was always the excitement as to whether he would break
down. The audience indeed found it thrilling, and it became more
and more exciting as it went on, for it became apparent that both
boys were getting to the end of their tether. They both began to
forget, and the judges were kept very busy, and the parents were as
occupied as seconds in a prize-ring. It must have been nearly
half-past six when Master Nick eventually gave out. He started odds
and ends, and forgot, and his parents were pulled up for prompting.
He collected a few odd lines, and amassed a total of 822, a very
considerable amount for a boy of his age.</p>

<p>At this point he was leading by 106 lines. So for Stephen to win
the wager for the landlord he would not only have to score that odd
106 but he would have to remember an additional 822 lines! And he
already gave evidence of forgetting! There was a fresh burst of
betting in odd parts of the hall, and Dick Toom was offering 10 to
1 against the landlord's <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> and not
getting many takers. The great thing in his favour was that he
seemed to have quite lost his nervousness. He was keen on the job,
and he seemed to realise that it <i>was</i> a competition, and that
he had got to do his utmost. The landlord's party were allowed to
talk to him and to make suggestions, but not to prompt if he
forgot. There was a short interval, in which milk and other drinks
were handed round. The landlord had one of the other drinks, and
then he said:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to ask your indulgence to be as
quiet as possible. My small nephew has to recall 928 lines, to win
the competition, and he is going to try to do it."</p>

<p>The announcement was received with cheers. And then Stephen
started again. He began excellently with Keats' "Ode to a
Nightingale," and scored 80 lines, and without any pause went on to
Milton's "L'Allegro," of which he delivered 126 lines before
breaking down. He paused a little, and then did odds and ends of
verses, some complete, and some not. Thomas Hood's "Departure of
Summer" (14 lines), Shelley's "To Night" (35) and a song by Shelley
commencing:</p>

<p class="poem">Rarely, rarely comest thou<br>
Spirit of Delight! (48 lines)</p>

<p>I will not enumerate all these poems but he amassed altogether
378 lines in this way. Then he had another brief rest, and reverted
once more to Shakespeare. In his little sing-song voice, without
any attempt at dramatic expression, he reeled off 160 lines of the
Balcony Scene from <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>; 96 lines of the scene
between Hamlet and the Queen; 44 lines of the Brutus and Cassius
quarrel; 31 of Jaques' speech on "All the world's a stage." It need
hardly be said that by this time the good burghers of Tibbelsford
were in a state of the wildest excitement.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster announced that Master Stephen had now scored
689 of the requite 928, so that he only wanted 240 more to win. Mr.
Stourway was biting his nails and looking green. Mrs. Stourway
looked as though she was disgusted with her husband for having
brought her among these common people. Nick sneered
superciliously.</p>

<p>But, in the meantime, there was no question but that Master
Stephen himself was getting distressed. His small voice was getting
huskier and huskier, and tears seemed not far off. I heard Mrs.
Rusbridger, sitting behind me, remark:</p>

<p>"Poor little mite! I calls it a shime!"</p>

<p>It was also evident that he was getting seriously to the end of
his quoting r&eacute;pertoire. He had no other long speeches. The
landlord's party gathered round him and whispered. He tried again,
short stanzas and odd verses, sometimes unfinished. He kept the
schoolmaster very busy but he blundered on. By these uncertain
stages he managed to add another 127 lines; and then he suddenly
brought off a veritable <i>tour de force</i>. It was quite uncanny.
He quoted 109 lines of Spenser's <i>Faerie Queen!</i> The matter
was quite unintelligible to the audience, and they were whispering
to each other and asking what it was. When he broke down, the
schoolmaster announced that it was quite in order, and that Master
Stephen's total lines quoted now amounted to 1640, and therefore he
only required four lines to win!</p>

<p>Even then the battle was apparently not over. Everyone was
cheering and making such a noise that the small boy could not
understand it, and he began crying. A lot of people in the audience
were calling out "Shame!" and there was all the appearance of a
disturbance. The landlord's party were very occupied. It was
several minutes before order was restored, and then the landlord
rapped on the table and called out "Order! Order!"</p>

<p>He drank a glass of water, and there was dead silence. Stephen's
mother held the little boy very tight, and smiled at him. At last,
raising his voice for this last despairing effort, he declaimed
quite loudly:</p>

<p class="poem">Why, all the Saints and Sages who discuss'd<br>
Of the two Worlds so wisely&mdash;they are thrust<br>
Like foolish Prophets forth; their Words to Scorn<br>
Are scatter'd, and their Mouths are stopt with Dust.</p>

<p>The cheers which greeted this triumphant climax were split by
various disturbances, the most distressing coming from Stephen
himself for almost as he uttered the last word he gave a yell, and
burst into sobs. And he sobbed, and sobbed, and sobbed. And his
mother picked him up and rocked him, and the landlord and his wife
did what they could. But it was quite hopeless. Stephen was
finished. His mother picked him up and hurried out of the door at
the back with him. The Stourway party melted away. There were no
more speeches, but people crowded on to the platform, and a lot of
the women wanted to just kiss Stephen before he went away; but Mrs.
Wright came back and said the poor child was very upset. She was
afraid they ought not to have let him do it. His mother was putting
him to bed in one of the rooms, and they were giving him some sal
volatile. He would be all right soon. Of course it was a tremendous
effort&mdash;such a tiny person, too!</p>

<p>Someone offered to go for the doctor, but Mrs. Wright said they
would see how he was, and if he wasn't better in half-an-hour's
time they'd send over to Dr. Winch.</p>

<p>Everyone was congratulating the landlord, and he was clasping
hands and saying:</p>

<p>"A marvellous boy! a marvellous boy! I knew he would do it!"</p>

<p>The party gradually broke up.</p>

<p>I must now again revert to myself. I was enormously impressed by
what I had seen and heard, and for the rest of the evening I could
think of nothing else. After dinner I went out for a stroll. It was
early March, and unseasonably cold. When I got down to the bridge,
over which the high-road runs across the open country to Tisehurst,
large snow-flakes were falling. I stood there for some time,
looking at our dim little river, and thinking of the landlord and
Stephen. And as I gazed around me I began to wonder what it was
about the snow-flakes which seemed to dovetail with certain
subconscious movements going on within me.</p>

<p>And suddenly a phrase leapt into my mind. It was:</p>

<p>"Rotten cotton gloves!"</p>

<p>Rotten cotton gloves! What was the connection? The snow, the
mood, something about Stephen's voice quoting "The Faerie Queene."
Very slowly the thing began to unfold itself. And when I began to
realise it all, I said to myself, "Yes, my friend, it was the
<i>Faerie Queene</i> which gave the show away. The rest might have
been possible. You were getting rather hard put to it!" The snow
was falling heavily. It was Christmas-time&mdash;good Lord! I did
not like to think how long ago. Thirty years? Forty years? My
sister and I at Drury Lane pantomine. "Rotten cotton gloves!" Yes,
that was it! I could remember nothing at all of the performance.
But who was that great man they spoke of? The star
attraction?&mdash;Some name like "The Great Borodin," the world's
most famous humourist and ventriloquist. We were very excited,
Phyllis and I, very small people then, not, surely, much older than
Stephen himself. I could not remember the great Borodin, but I
remembered that one phrase. There was a small lay figure which said
most amusing things. It was called&mdash; No, I have forgotten. It
was dressed in an Eton suit and it wore rather dilapidated-looking
white cotton gloves. And every now and then, in the middle of a
dialogue or discourse, it broke off, looked at its hands, and
muttered:</p>

<p>"Rotten cotton gloves!"</p>

<p>It became a sort of catch-phrase in London in those days. On
'buses and trains people would murmur "Rotten cotton gloves!" A
certain vague something about the way that Stephen recited
Spenser's <i>Faerie Queen</i>...Was it possible?</p>

<p>And then certain very definite aspects of the competition
presented themselves to my mind's eye. It had all been very
cleverly stage-managed. It must be observed that Stephen neither
walked on nor walked off. He did not even stand. He hardly looked
at the audience. And then the lighting was inexcusably bad. Even
some of the lights in the central chandelier had unaccountably
failed. And the landlord's party had chosen the darkest side of the
stage. No one had spoken to the boy. No one had seen him arrive,
and immediately after the competition he had gone straight to
bed.</p>

<p>I tried to probe my memory for knowledge of "The Great Borodin,"
but at eight or nine one does not take great interest in these
details. I know there was something....I remember hearing my
parents talking about it&mdash;some great scandal soon after I had
seen him. He was disgraced, I am sure. I have a vague idea he was
in some way well-connected. He was to marry a great lady, and then
perhaps he eloped with a young barmaid? I cannot be certain. It was
something like that. I know he disappeared from public life, for in
after years, when people had been to similar performances I had
heard our parents say:</p>

<p>"Ah, but you should have seen 'The Great Borodin.'"</p>

<p>These memories, the peculiar thrill of the competition, the cold
air, the lazy snow-flakes drifting hither and thither, all excited
me. I walked on further and further into the country trying to
piece it all together. I liked the landlord, and I shared the
popular dislike of Mr. Stourway.</p>

<p>After a time I returned, and making my way towards the north of
the town, I started to walk quickly in the direction of "The
Love-a-duck." If I hurried I should be there ten minutes or so
before closing time.</p>

<p>When I entered the large bar-parlour the place was very crowded.
I met old Hargreaves by the door. I'm afraid a good many of the
rules of the society had been broken that evening. Old Hargreaves
was not the only one who had had quite enough liquid refreshment.
Everybody was in high spirits, and they were still all talking
about the competition. I met Mr. Bean near the fireplace, and I
said:</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Bean, and have you heard how the boy is?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ay," he replied. "He soon got all right. Mrs. Wright says
he were just a bit upset. He went off home not an hour since."</p>

<p>"Did you see him?"</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh, no, I didn't see'm. Mrs. Wright says he looked quite
hisself."</p>

<p>The landlord was moving ponderously up and down behind the bar.
I thought he looked tired and there were dark rims round his eyes.
I moved up towards the bar, and he did not notice me. The noise of
talking was so loud that one could speak in a normal voice without
being heard. Everything had apparently gone off quite successfully.
Mr. Stourway had sent along his cheque for five pounds and it was
not reckoned that he would ever show his face in "The Love-a-duck"
again. I waited.</p>

<p>At last I noticed that the landlord was quite alone. He was
leaning against the serving-hatch, flicking some crumbs from his
waistcoat, as though waiting for the moment of release. I took my
glass and sidled up to him. I leant forward as though to speak. He
glanced at me, and inclined his head with a bored movement. When
his ear was within a reasonable distance, I said quietly:</p>

<p>"Rotten cotton gloves!"</p>

<p>I shall never forget the expression on the face of the landlord
as he slowly raised his head. I was conscious of being a pinpoint
in a vast perspective. His large, rather colourless eyes appeared
to sweep the whole room. They were moreover charged with a
perfectly controlled expression of surprise, and a kind of
uncontrolled lustre of ironic humour. I had a feeling that if he
laughed it would be the end of all things. He did not laugh; he
looked lugubriously right through my face, and breathed heavily.
Then he swayed slightly from side to side, and looking at my hat,
said:</p>

<p>"I've got some cherry-brandy here you'd like. You must have a
glass, Mr.&mdash;"</p>

<p>Now, I do not wish to appear to you either as a prig, a traitor,
or a profiteer. I am indeed a very ordinary, perhaps over-human
member of Tibbelsford society. If I have taken certain advantages
of the landlord, you must at any rate give me the credit of being
the only member of a large audience who had the right intuitions at
the right moment. In all other respects you must acknowledge that I
have treated him rather well.</p>

<p>In any case, I became prominent in the inner circle without
undergoing the tortuous novitiateship of the casual stranger.</p>

<p>The landlord and I are the best of friends to-day, although we
exchange no confidences. I can break all the rules of the masonic
understanding without getting into trouble. Some of the others are
amazed at the liberties I take.</p>

<p>And in these days, when licensing restrictions are so severe,
when certain things are not to be got (officially), and when I see
my friends stealing home to a bone-dry supper, I only have to creep
into the bar of "The Love-a-duck" and whisper "Rotten cotton
gloves!" and lo! all these forbidden luxuries are placed at my
disposal! Can you blame me?</p>

<p>I have said that we exchange no confidences, and indeed I feel
that that would be going too far, taking too great an advantage of
my position. There is only one small point I would love to clear
up, and I dare not ask. Presuming my theory to be right about "The
Great Borodin"&mdash;which was he?</p>

<p>The landlord? Or the widow?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>10. AN ADVENTURE IN BED</h2>

<p>There was something essentially Chinese about the appearance of
George as he lay there propped up against the pillows. His large
flabby face had an expression of complete detachment. His narrowing
eyes regarded me with a fatalistic repose. Observing him, I felt
that nothing mattered, nothing ever had mattered, and nothing ever
would matter. And I was angry. Pale sunlight filtered through the
curtains.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" I exclaimed. "Still in bed! Do you know it's nearly
twelve o'clock?"</p>

<p>An almost inaudible sigh greeted my explosion. George occupied
the maisonette below me. Some fool of an uncle had left him a small
private income, and he lived alone, attended by an old housekeeper.
He did nothing absolutely nothing at all, not even amuse himself,
and whenever I went in to see him he was invariably in bed. There
was nothing wrong with his health. It was sheer laziness. But not
laziness of a negative kind, mark you, but the outcome of a calm
and studied policy. I knew this, and it angered me the more.</p>

<p>"What would happen if the whole world went on like you?" I
snapped.</p>

<p>He sighed again, and then replied in his thin, mellow voice:</p>

<p>"We should have a series of ideal states. There would be no
wars, no crimes, no divorce, no competition, no greed, envy, hatred
or malice."</p>

<p>"Yes, and no food."</p>

<p>He turned slightly on one side. His accents became mildly
expostulating, the philosopher fretted by an ignorant child.</p>

<p>"How unreasonable you are, dear boy. How unthinking! The secret
of life is complete immobility. The tortoise lives four hundred
years; the fox-terrier wears itself out in ten. Wild beasts,
fishes, savages, and stockbrokers fight and struggle and eat each
other up. The only place for a cultivated man is&mdash;bed. In bed
he is supreme&mdash;the arbiter of his soul. His limbs and the
vulgar carcase of his being constructed for purely material
functioning are concealed. His head rules him. He is the autocrat
of the bolster, the gallant of fine linen, the master of complete
relaxation. Believe me, there are a thousand tender attitudes of
repose unknown to people like you. The four corners of a
feather-bed are an inexhaustible field of luxurious adventure. I
have spent more than half my life in bed, and even now I have not
explored all the delectable crannies and comforts that it holds for
me."</p>

<p>"No," I sneered, "and in the meantime other people have to work
to keep you there."</p>

<p>"That is not my fault. A well-ordered state should be a vast
caravanserai of dormitories. Ninety-nine per cent. of these
activities you laud so extravagantly are gross and unnecessary.
People should be made to stay in bed till they have found out
something worth doing. Who wants telephones, and cinemas, and
safety-razors? All that civilisation has invented are vulgar
luxuries and time-saving devices. And when they have saved the
time, they don't know what to do with it. All that is required is
bread, and wine, and fine linen. I&mdash;even I would not object to
getting up for a few hours every week to help to produce these
things."</p>

<p>He stroked the three-weeks' growth on his chin, and smiled
magnanimously. Then he continued:</p>

<p>"The world has yet to appreciate the real value of passivity. In
a crude form the working classes have begun to scratch the edge of
the surface. They have discovered the strike. Now, observe, that
the strike is the most powerful political weapon of the present
day. It can accomplish nearly everything it requires, and yet it is
a condition of immobility. So you see already that immobility may
be more powerful than activity. But this is only the beginning.
When the nations start going to bed, and stopping there, then
civilisation will take a leap forward. You can do nothing with a
man in bed&mdash;not even knock him down. My ambition is to form a
League of Bedfellows. So that if one day some busy-body or group of
busybodies says: 'We're going to war with France, or Germany, or
America,' we can reply, 'Very well. Then I'm going to bed.' Then
after a time, they would have to go to bed too. And they would
eventually succumb to the gentle caresses of these sheets and
eiderdowns. All their evil intentions would melt away. The world
should be ruled not by Governments or Soviets, but by national
doss-houses."</p>

<p>He yawned, and I pulled up the blind.</p>

<p>"What about the good activities?" I replied.</p>

<p>For a moment I thought I had stumped him, or that he was not
going to deign to reply. Then the thin rumble of his voice reached
me from across the sheets.</p>

<p>"What you call the good activities can all be performed in bed.
That is to say, they can be substituted by a good immobility. The
activities of man are essentially predatory. He has learnt nothing
and forgotten nothing. He is a hunter and slayer and nothing else
at all. All his activities are diversions of this instinct.
Commerce is war, capital is a sword, labour is a stomach. Progress
means either filling the stomach or chopping someone else's head
off with the sword. Science is an instrument that speeds up the
execution. Politics is a game. Colonisation is straightforward
daylight burglary."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to waste my morning talking to a fool like you,"
I said. "But what about art, and beauty, and charity, and
love?"</p>

<p>"In bed," he mumbled. "All in bed...They are all spiritual
things. Bed is the place for them. Was Keats' 'Ode to a
Nightingale' any finer because he got up and wrote it down and sent
it off to a fool of a publisher? Charity! Give a man a bed, and
charity ceases to have any significance. Love! What a fool you are!
Is a bed a less suitable place for love than a County Council
tramcar?"</p>

<p>His voice died away above the coverlet. I was about to deliver a
vitriolic tirade against his ridiculous theories, but I did not
know where to begin, and before I had framed a suitable opening,
the sound of gentle snoring reached me.</p>

<p>I record this conversation as faithfully as I can recollect
because it will help you to share with me the sense of extreme
surprise at certain events which followed, two months later. Of
course George did occasionally get up. Sometimes he went for a
gentle stroll in the afternoon, and he belonged to a club down town
where he would go and dine in the evening. After dinner he would
watch some of the men play billiards, but he invariably returned to
his bed about ten o'clock. He never played any game himself,
neither did he apparently write or receive letters. Occasionally he
read in bed, but he never looked at a newspaper or a magazine. He
once said to me that if you read the newspapers you might as well
play golf, and the tremulous shiver of disgust in his voice when he
uttered the word "golf" is a thing I shall never forget.</p>

<p>I ask you, then, to imagine my amazement when, two months later,
George shaved himself, got up to breakfast, reached a city office
at nine o'clock, worked all day, and returned at seven in the
evening. You will no doubt have a shrewd idea of the reason, and
you are right. She was the prettiest little thing you can imagine,
with chestnut hair and a solemn, babyish pucker of the cheeks. She
was as vital as he was turgid. Her name was Maisie Brand. I don't
know how he met her, but Maisie, in addition to being pretty and in
every way attractive, was a practical modern child. George's two
hundred a year might be sufficient to keep him in bed, but it
wasn't going to be enough to run a household on. Maisie had no use
for this bed theory. She was a daughter of sunshine and fresh air,
and frocks and theatres, and social life. If George was to win her
he must get up in the morning.</p>

<p>On the Sunday after this dramatic change I visited him in his
bedroom. He was like a broken man. He groaned when he recognised
me.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll stop in bed all day to-day?" I remarked
jauntily.</p>

<p>"I've got to get up this afternoon," he growled. "I've got to
take her to a concert."</p>

<p>"Well, how do you like work?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It's torture...agony, hell. It's awful. Fortunately, I found a
fellow-sufferer. He works next to me. We take it in turn to have
twenty-minute naps, while the other keeps watch."</p>

<p>I laughed, and quoted: "Custom lies upon us with a weight, heavy
as frost and deep almost as night." Then I added venomously: "Well,
I haven't any sympathy for you. It serves you right for the way
you've gone on all these years."</p>

<p>I thought he was asleep again, but at last his drowsy accents
proclaimed:</p>

<p>"What a perfect fool you are! You always follow the line of
least resistance."</p>

<p>I laughed outright at that, and exclaimed: "Well, if ever there
was a case of the pot calling the kettle black!"</p>

<p>There was a long interval, during which I seemed to observe a
slow, cumbrous movement in the bed. Doubtless he was exploring.
When he spoke again, there was a faint tinge of animation in his
voice.</p>

<p>"You are not capable I suppose, of realising the danger of it
all. You fool! Do you think I follow the line of least resistance
in bed? Do you think I haven't often wanted to get up and do all
those ridiculous things you and your kind indulge in? Can't you see
what might happen? Suppose these dormant temptations were
thoroughly aroused! Good God! It's awful to contemplate. Habit, you
say? Yes, I know. I know quite well the risk I am running. Am I to
sacrifice all the epic romance of this life between the sheets for
the sordid round of petty actions you call life? I was a fool to
get up that day. I had a premonition of danger when I awoke at
dawn. I said to myself, 'George, restrain yourself. Do not be
deceived by the hollow sunlight. Above all things, keep clear of
the park.' But, like a fool, I betrayed my sacred trust. The
premonitions which come to one in bed are always right. I got up.
And now...My God! it's too late."</p>

<p>Smothered sobs seemed to shake the bed.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "if you feel like that about it; if you think
more of your bed than of the girl, I should break it off. She won't
be missing much."</p>

<p>He suddenly sat up, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Don't you dare&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he sank back on the pillow, and added dispassionately:</p>

<p>"There you see, already the instinct of activity. A weak
attitude. I could crush you more successfully with complete
immobility. But these movements are already beginning. They shake
me at every turn. Nothing is secure."</p>

<p>Inwardly chuckling at his discomfiture, I left him.</p>

<hr>

<p>During the months that followed I did not have the opportunities
of studying George to the extent that I should have liked, as my
work carried me to various parts of the country, but what
opportunities I did have I found intriguing. He certainly improved
in health. A slight colour tinged his cheeks. He seemed less puffy
and turgid. His movements were still slow, but they were more
deliberate than of old. His clothes were neat and brushed. The girl
was delightful. She came up and chatted with me, and we became
great friends. She talked to me quite frankly about George. She
laughed about his passion for bed, but declared she meant to knock
all that sort of thing out of him. She was going to thoroughly wake
him up. She said laughingly that she thought it was perfectly
disgusting the way he had been living. I used to try and visualise
George making love to her, but somehow the picture would never seem
convincing. I do not think it could have been a very passionate
affair. Passion was the last thing you would associate with George.
I used to watch them walking down the street, the girl slim and
vivid, swinging along with broad strides, George, rather flustered
and disturbed, pottering along by her side, like a performing bear
that is being led away from its bun. He did not appear to look at
her, and when she addressed him vivaciously, he bent forward his
head and held his large ear close to her head. It was as though he
was timid of her vitality.</p>

<p>At first this spectacle amused me, but after a time it produced
in me another feeling altogether.</p>

<p>"This girl is being thrown away on him. It's horrible. She's
much too good for George."</p>

<p>And when I was away I was constantly thinking of her, and
dreading the day of the wedding, praying that something would
happen to prevent it. But to my deep concern nothing did happen to
prevent it, and they were duly married the following April. They
went for a short honeymoon to Brittany, and then returned and
occupied George's old maisonnette below me. The day after their
return I had to face a disturbing realisation. <i>I was falling
hopelessly in love with Maisie myself.</i> I could not think of
George or take any interest in him. I was always thinking of her.
Her face haunted me. Her charm and beauty, and the pathos of her
position, gripped me. I made up my mind that the only thing to do
was to go away. I went to Scotland, and on my return took a small
flat in another part of London. I wrote to George and gave him my
address, and wished him all possible luck. I said I hoped "some
day" to pay them a visit, but if at any time I could be of service,
would he let me know.</p>

<p>I cannot describe to you the anguish I experienced during the
following twelve months. I saw nothing of George or Maisie at all,
but the girl was ever present in my thoughts. I could not work. I
lived in a state of feverish restlessness. Time and again I was on
the point of breaking my resolve, but I managed to keep myself in
hand.</p>

<p>It was in the following June that I met Maisie herself walking
down Regent Street. She looked pale and worried. Dark rings
encircled her eyes. She gave a little gasp when she saw me, and
clutched my hand. I tried to be formal, but she was obviously
labouring under some tense emotion.</p>

<p>"My flat is in Baker Street," I said. "Will you come and visit
me?"</p>

<p>She answered huskily, "Yes, I will come to-morrow afternoon.
Thank you."</p>

<p>She slipped away in the crowd. I spent a sleepless night. What
had happened? Of course I could see it all. George had gone back to
bed. Having once secured her, his efforts had gradually flagged. He
had probably left his business&mdash;or been sacked&mdash;and spent
the day sleeping. The poor girl was probably living a life of
loneliness and utter poverty. What was I to do? All day long I
paced up and down my flat. I dreaded that she might not come. It
was just after four that the bell went. I hastened to answer it
myself. It was she. I led her into the sitting-room, and tried to
be formal and casual. I made some tea and chatted impersonally
about the weather and the news of the day. She hardly answered me.
Suddenly she buried her face in her hands, and broke into tears. I
sprang to her and patted her shoulder.</p>

<p>"There, there," I said. "What is it? Tell me all about it,
Maisie."</p>

<p>"I can't live with him! I can't live with him any longer!" she
sobbed.</p>

<p>I must acknowledge that my heart gave a violent bump, not
entirely occasioned by contrition. I murmured as sympathetically as
I could, but with prophetic assurance:</p>

<p>"He's gone back to bed."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," she managed to stammer. "It's not that. It's just
the opposite."</p>

<p>"Just the opposite?"</p>

<p>"He's so restless, so exhausting. Oh, dear! Yes, please Mr.
Wargrave, give me a cup of tea, and I will tell you all about
it."</p>

<p>For a moment I wondered whether the poor girl's mental balance
had been upset. I poured her out the tea in silence. George
restless! George exhausting! Whatever did she mean? She sipped the
tea meditatively; then she dabbed her beautiful eyes, and told me
the following remarkable story:</p>

<p>"It was all right at first, Mr. Wargrave. We were quite happy.
He was still&mdash;you know, very lazy, very sleepy. It all came
about gradually. Every week, however, he seemed to get a little
more active and vital. He began to sleep shorter hours and work
longer. He liked to be entertained in the evening or go to the
theatre. On Sunday he would go for quite long walks. It went on
like that for months. Then they raised his position in the firm. He
seemed to open out. It was as though during all those years he had
spent in bed he had been hoarding up remarkable stores of energy.
And suddenly some demon of restlessness got possession of him. He
began to work frenziedly. At first he was pleasant to me; then he
became so busy he completely ignored me. At the end of six months
they made him manager of a big engineering works at Walham Green.
One of the directors, a Mr. Sturge, said to me one day, 'That
husband of yours is a remarkable man. He is the most efficient and
forceful person we have ever employed. What has he been doing all
these years? Why haven't we heard of him before!' He would get up
at six in the morning, have a cold bath, and study for two hours
before he went off to work. He would work all day, like a fury.
They say he was a perfect slave-driver in the works. Only last week
he sacked a man for taking a nap five minutes over his lunch hour.
He would get home about eight o'clock, have a hurried dinner, and
then insist on going to the opera or playing bridge. When we got
back he would read till two or three in the morning. Oh, Mr.
Wargrave, he has got worse and worse. He never sleeps at all. He
terrifies me. On Sunday it is just the same. He works all the
morning. After lunch he motors out to Northwood, and plays eighteen
holes before tea, and eighteen after."</p>

<p>"What!" I exclaimed. "Golf!"</p>

<p>"Golf, and science, and organisation are his manias. They say
he's invented some wonderful labour-saving appliances on the plant,
and he's planning all kinds of future activities. The business of
the firm is increasing enormously. They pay him well, but he still
persists in living in that maisonnette. He says he's too busy to
move."</p>

<p>"Is he cruel to you?"</p>

<p>"If complete indifference and neglect is cruelty, he is most
certainly cruel. Sometimes he gives me a most curious look, as
though he hated me, and yet he can't account for me. He allows me
no intimacy of any sort. If I plead with him he doesn't answer. I
believe he holds me responsible for all these dormant powers which
have got loose and which he cannot now control. I do not think his
work gives him any satisfaction. It is as though he were driven on
by some blind force. Oh, Mr. Wargrave, I can't go on. It is killing
me. I must run away and leave him."</p>

<p>"Maisie!" I murmured, and I took her hand.</p>

<p>The immediate subsequent proceedings are not perhaps entirely
necessary to record in relating this story, which is essentially
George's story. The story of Maisie and myself could comfortably
fill a stout volume, but as it concerns two quite unremarkable
people, who were just human and workaday, I do not expect that you
would be interested to read it. In any case, we have no intention
of writing it, so do not be alarmed. I can only tell you that
during that year of her surprising married life, Maisie had thought
of me not a little, and this d&eacute;nouement rapidly brought
things to a head. After this confession we used to meet every day.
We went for rambles and picnics, and to matin&eacute;es, and of
course that kind of thing cannot go on indefinitely. We both
detested the idea of an intrigue. And eventually we decided that we
would cut the Gordian knot and make full confession. Maisie left
him and went to live with a married sister. That same morning I
called on George. I arrived at the maisonnette just before six
o'clock as I knew that that was the most likely time to catch him.
Without any preliminary ceremony I made my way into the familiar
bedroom. George was in bed. I stood by the door and called out:</p>

<p>"George!"</p>

<p>Like a flash he was out of bed, and standing in his pyjamas,
facing me. He had changed considerably. His face was lined and old,
but his eyes blazed with a fury of activity. He awed me. I
stammered out my confession.</p>

<p>"George, I'm awfully sorry, old chap. I have a confession to
make to you. It comes in the first place from Maisie. She has
decided that she cannot live with you any longer. She thinks you
have neglected her, and treated her badly. She refuses to come back
to you under any circumstances. Indeed, she&mdash;she and
I&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>I tailed off dismally, and looked at him. For a moment I thought
he was going to bear down on me. I know that if he had I should
have been supine. I should have stood there and let him slaughter
me. I felt completely overpowered by the force of his personality.
I believe I shivered. He hovered by the edge of the bed, then he
turned and looked out of the window. He stood there solemnly for
nearly a minute; then he emitted a profound sigh. Without more ado,
he got back into bed. There was an immense upheaval of the sheets.
He seemed to be burrowing down into some vast and as yet unexplored
cave of comfort. He rolled and heaved, and at length became inert.
I stood there, waiting for my answer. Sparrows twittered outside on
the windowbox. I don't know how long I waited. I felt that I could
not go until he had spoken.</p>

<p>At length his voice came. It seemed to reach me across dim
centuries of memory, an old, tired, cosy, enormously contented,
sleep-encrusted voice.</p>

<p>"'S'all right," said the voice. "Tell Mrs. Chase she needn't
bring up my shaving-water this morning."</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>11. THEM OTHERS</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>It is always disturbing to me when things fall into pattern
form, when in fact incidents of real life dovetail with each other
in such a manner as to suggest the shape of a story. A story is a
nice neat little thing with what is called a "working-up" and a
climax, and life is a clumsy, ungraspable thing, very incomplete in
its periods, and with a poor sense of climax. In fact,
death&mdash;which is a very uncertain quantity&mdash;is the only
definite note it strikes, and even death has an uncomfortable way
of setting other things in motion. If, therefore, in telling you
about my friend Mrs. Ward, I am driven to the usual shifts of the
story-teller, you must believe me that it is because this narrative
concerns visions: Mrs. Ward's visions, my visions, and your
visions. Consequently I am dependent upon my own poor powers of
transcription to mould these visions into some sort of shape, and
am driven into the position of a story-teller against my will.</p>

<p>The first vision, then, concerns the back view of the Sheldrake
Road, which, as you know, butts on to the railway embankment near
Dalston Junction station. If you are of an adventurous turn of mind
you shall accompany me, and we will creep up on to the embankment
together and look down into these back yards. (We shall be liable
to a fine of &pound;2, according to a bye-law of the Railway
Company, for doing so, but the experience will justify us.)</p>

<p>There are twenty-two of these small buff-brick houses huddled
together in this road, and there is surely no more certain way of
judging not only the character of the individual inhabitants but of
their mode of life, than by a survey of these somewhat pathetic
yards. Is it not, for instance, easy to determine the timid,
well-ordered mind of little Miss Porson, the dressmaker at number
nine, by its garden of neat mud paths, with its thin patch of
meagre grass, and the small bed of skimpy geraniums? Cannot one
read the tragedy of those dreadful Alleson people at number four?
The garden is a wilderness of filth and broken bottles, where even
the weeds seem chary of establishing themselves. In fact, if we
listen carefully&mdash;and the trains are not making too much
noise&mdash;we can hear the shrill crescendo of Mrs. Alleson's
voice cursing at her husband in the kitchen, the half-empty
gin-bottle between them.</p>

<p>The methodical pushfulness and practicability of young Mr. and
Mrs. Andrew MacFarlane is evident at number fourteen. They have
actually grown a patch of potatoes, and some scarlet-runners, and
there is a chicken run near the house.</p>

<p>Those irresponsible people, the O'Neals, have grown a bed of
hollyhocks, but for the rest the garden is untidy and unkempt. One
could almost swear they were connected in some obscure way with the
theatrical profession.</p>

<p>Mrs. Abbot's garden is a sort of playground. It has asphalt
paths, always swarming with small and not too clean children, and
there are five lines of washing suspended above the mud. Every day
seems to be Mrs. Abbot's washing day. Perhaps she "does" for
others. Sam Abbot is certainly a lazy, insolent old rascal, and
such always seem destined to be richly fertile. Mrs. Abbot is a
pleasant "body," though.</p>

<p>The Greens are the swells of the road. George Green is in the
grocery line, and both his sons are earning good money, and one
daughter has piano lessons. The narrow strip of yard is actually
divided into two sections, a flower-garden and a kitchen-garden.
And they are the only people who have flower-boxes in the
front.</p>

<p>Number eight is a curious place. Old Mr. Bilge lives there. He
spends most of his time in the garden, but nothing ever seems to
come up. He stands about in his shirt-sleeves, and with a circular
paper hat on his head, like a printer. They say he was formerly a
corn-merchant, but has lost all his money. He keeps the garden very
neat and tidy, but nothing seems to grow. He stands there staring
at the beds, as though he found their barrenness quite
unaccountable.</p>

<p>Number eleven is unoccupied, and number twelve is Mrs.
Ward's.</p>

<p>We come now to an important vision, and I want you to come down
with me from the embankment and to view Mrs. Ward's garden from
inside, and also Mrs. Ward as I saw her on that evening when I had
occasion to pay my first visit.</p>

<p>It had been raining, but the sun had come out. We wandered round
the paths together, and I can see her old face now, lined and
seamed with years of anxious toil and struggle; her long bony arms,
slightly withered, but moving restlessly in the direction of snails
and slugs.</p>

<p>"O dear! O dear!" she was saying. "What with the dogs, and the
cats, and the snails, and the trains, it's wonderful anything comes
up at all!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward's garden has a character of its own, and I cannot
account for it. There is nothing very special growing&mdash;a few
pansies and a narrow border of London Pride, several clumps of
unrecognisable things that haven't flowered, the grass patch in
only fair order, and at the end of the garden an unfinished
rabbit-hutch. But there is about Mrs. Ward's garden an atmosphere.
There is something about it that reflects in her placid eye, the
calm, somewhat contemplative way she has of looking right through
things, as though they didn't concern her too closely. As though,
in fact, she were too occupied with her own inner visions.</p>

<p>"No," she says in answer to my query. "We don't mind the trains
at all. In fact, me and my Tom we often come out here and sit after
supper. And Tom smokes his pipe. We like to hear the trains go
by."</p>

<p>She gazes abstractedly at the embankment.</p>

<p>"I like to hear things...going on and that. It's Dalston
Junction a little further on. The trains go from there to all
parts, right out into the country they do...ever so far...My Ernie
went from Dalston."</p>

<p>She adds the last in a changed tone of voice. And now perhaps we
come to the most important vision of all&mdash;Mrs. Ward's vision
of "my Ernie."</p>

<p>I ought perhaps to mention that I had never met "my Ernie." I
can only see him through Mrs. Ward's eyes. At the time when I met
her, he had been away at the war for nearly a year. I need hardly
say that "my Ernie" was a paragon of sons. He was brilliant,
handsome, and incredibly clever. Everything that "my Ernie" said
was treasured. Every opinion that he expressed stood. If "my Ernie"
liked anyone, that person was always a welcome guest. If "my Ernie"
disliked anyone they were not to be tolerated, however plausible
they might appear.</p>

<p>I had seen Ernie's photograph, and I must confess that he
appeared a rather weak, extremely ordinary-looking young man, but
then I would rather trust to Mrs. Ward's visions than the art of
any photographer.</p>

<p>Tom Ward was a mild, ineffectual-looking old man, with something
of Mrs. Ward's placidity but with nothing of her strong individual
poise. He had some job in a gasworks. There was also a daughter
named Lily, a brilliant person who served in a tea-shop, and
sometimes went to theatres with young men. To both husband and
daughter Mrs. Ward adopted an affectionate, mothering, almost
pitying attitude. But with "my Ernie," it was quite a different
thing. I can see her stooping figure, and her silver-white hair
gleaming in the sun as we come to the unfinished rabbit-hutch, and
the curious wistful tones of her voice as she touches it and
says:</p>

<p>"When my Ernie comes home..."</p>

<p>The war to her was some unimaginable but disconcerting affair
centred round Ernie. People seemed to have got into some desperate
trouble, and Ernie was the only one capable of getting them out of
it. I could not at that time gauge how much Mrs. Ward realised the
dangers the boy was experiencing. She always spoke with conviction
that he would return safely. Nearly every other sentence contained
some reference to things that were to happen "when my Ernie comes
home." What doubts and fears she had were only recognisable by the
subtlest shades in her voice.</p>

<p>When we looked over the wall into the deserted garden next door,
she said:</p>

<p>"O dear! I'm afraid they'll never let that place. It's been
empty since the Stellings went away. Oh, years ago, before this old
war."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>It was on the occasion of my second visit that Mrs. Ward told me
more about the Stellings. It appeared that they were a German
family, of all things! There was a Mr. Stelling, and a Mrs. Frow
Stelling, and two boys.</p>

<p>Mr. Stelling was a watchmaker, and he came from a place called
Bremen. It was a very sad story Mrs. Ward told me. They had only
been over here for ten months when Mr. Stelling died, and Mrs. Frow
Stelling and the boys went back to Germany.</p>

<p>During the time of the Stellings' sojourn in the Sheldrake Road
it appeared that the Wards had seen quite a good deal of them, and
though it would be an exaggeration to say that they ever became
great friends, they certainly got through that period without any
unpleasantness, and even developed a certain degree of
intimacy.</p>

<p>"Allowing for their being foreigners," Mrs. Ward explained,
"they were quite pleasant people."</p>

<p>On one or two occasions they invited each other to supper, and I
wish my visions were sufficiently clear to envisage those two
families indulging this social habit.</p>

<hr>

<p>According to Mrs. Ward, Mr. Stelling was a kind little man with
a round fat face. He spoke English fluently, but Mrs. Ward objected
to his table manners.</p>

<p>"When my Tom eats," she said, "you don't hear a sound&mdash;I
look after that! But that Mr. Stelling...O dear!"</p>

<p>The trouble with Mrs. Stelling was that she could only speak a
few words of English, but Mrs. Ward said "she was a pleasant enough
little body," and she established herself quite definitely in Mrs.
Ward's affections for the reason that she was so obviously and so
passionately devoted to her two sons.</p>

<p>"Oh, my word, though, they do have funny ways&mdash;these
foreigners," she continued. "The things they used to eat! Most
peculiar! I've known them eat stewed prunes with hot meat!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward repeated, "Stewed prunes with hot meat!" several
times, and shook her head, as though this exotic mixture was a
thing to be sternly discouraged. But she acknowledged that Mrs.
Frow Stelling was in some ways a very good cook; in fact, her cakes
were really wonderful, "the sort of thing you can't ever buy in a
shop."</p>

<p>About the boys there seemed to be a little divergence of
opinion. They were both also fat-faced, and their heads were
"almost shaved like convicts." The elder one wore spectacles and
was rather noisy, but:</p>

<p>"My Ernie liked the younger one. Oh, yes, my Ernie said that
young Hans was quite a nice boy. It was funny the way they spoke,
funny and difficult to understand."</p>

<p>It was very patent that between the elder boy and Ernie, who
were of about the same age, there was an element of rivalry which
was perhaps more accentuated in the attitude of the mothers than in
the boys themselves. Mrs. Ward could find little virtue in this
elder boy. Most of her criticism of the family was levelled against
him. The rest she found only a little peculiar. She said she had
never heard such a funny Christian name as Frow. Florrie she had
heard of, and even Flora, but not <i>Frow</i>. I suggested that
perhaps Frow might be some sort of title, but she shook her head
and said that that was what she was always known as in the
Sheldrake Road, "Mrs. Frow Stelling."</p>

<p>In spite of Mrs. Ward's lack of opportunity for greater intimacy
on account of the language problem, her own fine imaginative
qualities helped her a great deal. And in one particular she seemed
curiously vivid. She gathered an account from one of them&mdash;I'm
not sure whether it was Mr. or Mrs. Frow Stelling or one of the
boys&mdash;of a place they described near their home in Bremen.
There was a narrow street of high buildings by a canal, and a
little bridge that led over into a gentleman's park. At a point
where the canal turned sharply eastwards there was a clump of
Linden-trees, where one could go in the summertime, and under their
shade one might sit and drink light beer, and listen to a band that
played in the early part of the evening.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ward was curiously clear about that. She said she often
thought about Mr. Stelling sitting there after his day's work. It
must have been very pleasant for him, and he seemed to miss this
luxury in Dalston more than anything. Once Ernie, in a friendly
mood, had taken him into the four-ale bar of "The Unicorn" at the
corner of the Sheldrake Road, but Mr. Stelling did not seem happy.
Ernie acknowledged afterwards that it had been an unfortunate
evening. The bar had been rather crowded, and there was a man and
two women who had all been drinking too much. In any case, Mr.
Stelling had been obviously restless there, and he had said
afterwards:</p>

<p>"It is not that one wishes to drink only..."</p>

<p>And he had shaken his fat little head, and had never been known
to visit "The Unicorn" again.</p>

<p>Mr. Stelling died quite suddenly of some heart trouble, and Mrs.
Ward could not get it out of her head that his last illness was
brought about by his disappointment and grief in not being able to
go and sit quietly under the Linden-trees after his day's work and
listen to a band.</p>

<p>"You know, my dear," she said, "when you get accustomed to a
thing, it's <i>bad</i> for you to leave it off."</p>

<p>When poor Mr. Stelling died, Mrs. Frow Stelling was
heart-broken, and I have reason to believe that Mrs. Ward went in
and wept with her, and in their dumb way they forged the chains of
some desperate understanding. When Mrs. Frow Stelling went back to
Germany they promised to write to each other. But they never did,
and for a very good reason. As Mrs. Ward said, she was "no
scholard," and as for Mrs. Frow Stelling, her English was such a
doubtful quantity, she probably never got beyond addressing the
envelope.</p>

<p>"That was three years ago," said Mrs. Ward. "Them boys must be
eighteen and nineteen now."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>If I have intruded too greatly into the intimacy of Mrs. Ward's
life, one of my excuses must be&mdash;not that I am "a scholard"
but that I am in any case able to read a simple English letter. I
was in fact on several occasions "requisitioned." When Lily was not
at home, someone had to read Ernie's letters out loud. The arrival
of Ernie's letters was always an inspiring experience. I should
perhaps be in the garden with Mrs. Ward, when Tom would come
hurrying out to the back, and call out:</p>

<p>"Mother! a letter from Ernie!"</p>

<p>And then there would be such excitement and commotion. The first
thing was always to hunt for Mrs. Ward's spectacles. They were
never where she had put them. Tom would keep on turning the letter
over in his hands, and examining the postmark, and he would
reiterate:</p>

<p>"Well, what did you do with them, mother?"</p>

<p>At length they would be found in some unlikely place, and she
would take the letter tremblingly to the light. I never knew quite
how much Mrs. Ward could read. She could certainly read a certain
amount. I saw her old eyes sparkling and her tongue moving jerkily
between her parted lips, as though she were formulating the words
she read, and she would keep on repeating:</p>

<p>"T'ch! T'ch! O dear, O dear, the <i>things</i> he says!"</p>

<p>And Tom impatiently by the door would say:</p>

<p>"Well, what <i>does</i> he say?"</p>

<p>She never attempted to read the letter out loud, but at last she
would wipe her spectacles and say:</p>

<p>"Oh, you read it, sir. The <i>things</i> he says!"</p>

<p>They were indeed very good letters of Ernie's, written
apparently in the highest spirits. There was never a grumble, not a
word. One might gather that he was away with a lot of young bloods
on some sporting expedition, in which football, rags, sing-songs,
and strange feeds played a conspicuous part. I read a good many of
Ernie's letters, and I do not remember that he ever made a single
reference to the horrors of war, or said anything about his own
personal discomforts. The boy must have had something of his mother
in him in spite of the photograph.</p>

<p>And between the kitchen and the yard Mrs. Ward would spend her
day placidly content, for Ernie never failed to write. There was
sometimes a lapse of a few days, but the letter seldom failed to
come every fortnight.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to know what Mrs. Ward's actual conception
of the war was. She never read the newspapers, for the reason, as
she explained, that "there was nothing in them these days except
about this old war." She occasionally dived into Reynold's
newspaper on Sundays to see if there were any interesting law cases
or any news of a romantic character. There was nothing romantic in
the war news. It was all preposterous. She did indeed read the
papers for the first few weeks, but this was for the reason that
she had some vague idea that they might contain some account of
Ernie's doings. But as they did not, she dismissed them with
contempt.</p>

<p>But I found her one night in a peculiarly preoccupied mood. She
was out in the garden, and she kept staring abstractedly over the
fence into the unoccupied ground next door. It appeared that it had
dawned upon her that the war was to do with "these Germans," that
in fact we were fighting the Germans, and then she thought of the
Stellings. Those boys would now be about eighteen and nineteen.
They would be fighting too. They would be fighting against Ernie.
This seemed very peculiar.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said, "I never took to that elder boy&mdash;a
greedy rough sort of boy he was. But I'm sure my Ernie wouldn't
hurt young Hans."</p>

<p>She meditated for a moment as though she were contemplating what
particular action Ernie would take in the matter. She knew he
didn't like the elder boy, but she doubted whether he would want to
do anything very violent to him.</p>

<p>"They went out to a music-hall one night together," she
explained, as though a friendship cemented in this luxurious
fashion could hardly be broken by an unreasonable display of
passion.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>It was a few weeks later that the terror suddenly crept into
Mrs. Ward's life. Ernie's letters ceased abruptly. The fortnight
passed, then three weeks, four weeks, five weeks, and not a word. I
don't think that Mrs. Ward's character at any time stood out so
vividly as during those weeks of stress. It is true she appeared a
little feebler, and she trembled in her movements, whilst her eyes
seemed abstracted as though all the power in them were concentrated
in her ears, alert for the bell or the knock. She started visibly
at odd moments, and her imagination was always carrying her
tempestuously to the front door only to answer&mdash;a milkman or a
casual hawker. But she never expressed her fear in words. When Tom
came home&mdash;he seemed to have aged rapidly&mdash;he would come
bustling into the garden, and cry out tremblingly:</p>

<p>"There ain't been no letter to-day, mother?"</p>

<p>And she would say quite placidly:</p>

<p>"No, not to-day, Tom. It'll come to-morrow, I expect."</p>

<p>And she would rally him and talk of little things, and get busy
with his supper. And in the garden I would try and talk to her
about her clumps of pansies, and the latest yarn about the
neighbours, and I tried to get between her and the rabbit-hutch
with its dumb appeal of incompletion. And I would notice her
staring curiously over into the empty garden next door, as though
she were being assailed by some disturbing apprehensions. Ernie
would not hurt that eldest boy...but suppose...if things were
reversed...there was something inexplicable and terrible lurking in
this passive silence.</p>

<p>During this period the old man was suddenly taken very ill. He
came home one night with a high temperature and developed
pneumonia. He was laid up for many weeks, and she kept back the
telegram that came while he was almost unconscious, and she tended
him night and day, nursing her own anguish with a calm face.</p>

<p>For the telegram told her that her Ernie was "missing and
believed wounded."</p>

<p>I do not know at what period she told the father this news, but
it was certainly not till he was convalescent. And the old man
seemed to sink into a kind of apathy. He sat feebly in front of the
kitchen fire, coughing and making no effort to control his
grief.</p>

<p>Outside the great trains went rushing by, night and day. Things
were "going on," but they were all meaningless, cruel.</p>

<p>We made enquiries at the War Office, but they could not amplify
the laconic telegram.</p>

<p>And then the winter came on, and the gardens were bleak in the
Sheldrake Road. And Lily ran away and married a young tobacconist,
who was earning twenty-five shillings a week. And old Tom was
dismissed from the gasworks. His work was not proving satisfactory.
And he sat about at home and moped. And in the meantime the price
of foodstuffs was going up, and coals were a luxury. And so in the
early morning Mrs. Ward would go off and work for Mrs. Abbot at the
wash-tub, and she would earn eight or twelve shillings a week.</p>

<p>It is difficult to know how they managed during those days, but
one would see that Mrs. Ward was buoyed up by some poignant hope.
She would not give way. Eventually old Tom did get some work to do
at a stationer's. The work was comparatively light, and the pay
equally so, so Mrs. Ward still continued to work for Mrs.
Abbot.</p>

<p>My next vision of Mrs. Ward concerns a certain winter evening. I
could not see inside the kitchen, but the old man could be heard
complaining. His querulous voice was rambling on, and Mrs. Ward was
standing by the door leading into the garden. She had returned from
her day's work and was scraping a pan out into a bin near the door.
A train shrieked by, and the wind was blowing a fine rain against
the house. Suddenly she stood up and looked at the sky; then she
pushed back her hair from her brow, and frowned at the dark house
next door. Then she turned and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, Tom, if we've got to do it, we <i>must</i> do
it. If them others can stand it, we can stand it. Whatever them
others do, we can do."</p>

<p>And then my visions jump rather wildly. And the war becomes to
me epitomised in two women. One in this dim doorway in our obscure
suburb of Dalston, scraping out a pan, and the other perhaps in
some dark high house near a canal on the outskirts of Bremen. Them
others! These two women silently enduring. And the trains rushing
by, and all the dark, mysterious forces of the night operating on
them equivocally.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Frow Stelling! Perhaps those boys of hers are
"missing, believed killed." Perhaps they are killed for certain.
She is as much outside "the things going on" as Mrs. Ward. Perhaps
she is equally as patient, as brave.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Ward enters the kitchen, and her eyes are blazing with
a strange light as she says:</p>

<p>"We'll hear to-morrow, Tom. And if we don't hear to-morrow,
we'll hear the next day. And if we don't hear the next day, we'll
hear the day after. And if we don't...if we don't never
hear...again...if them others can stand it, we can stand it, I
say."</p>

<p>And then her voice breaks, and she cries a little, for endurance
has its limitations, and&mdash;the work is hard at Mrs.
Abbot's.</p>

<p>And the months go by, and she stoops a little more as she walks,
and&mdash;someone has thrown a cloth over the rabbit-hutch with its
unfinished roof. And Mrs. Ward is curiously retrospective. It is
useless to tell her of the things of the active world. She listens
politely but she does not hear. She is full of reminiscences of
Ernie's and Lily's childhood. She recounts again and again the
story of how Ernie when he was a little boy ordered five tons of
coal from a coal merchant to be sent to a girls' school in Dalston
High Road. She describes the coal carts arriving in the morning,
and the consternation of the head-mistress.</p>

<p>"O dear, O dear," she says; "the things he did!"</p>

<p>She does not talk much of the Stellings, but one day she says
meditatively:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Frow Stelling thought a lot of that boy Hans. So she did
of the other, as far as that goes. It's only natural like, I
suppose."</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>As time went on Tom Ward lost all hope. He said he was convinced
that the boy was killed. Having arrived at this conclusion he
seemed to become more composed. He gradually began to accustom
himself to the new point of view. But with Mrs. Ward the exact
opposite was the case.</p>

<p>She was convinced that the boy was alive, but she suffered
terribly.</p>

<p>There came a time&mdash;it was in early April&mdash;when one
felt that the strain could not last. She seemed to lose all
interest in the passing world and lived entirely within herself.
Even the arrival of Lily's baby did not rouse her. She looked at
the child queerly, as though she doubted whether any useful or
happy purpose was served by its appearance.</p>

<p>It was a boy.</p>

<p>In spite of her averred optimism she lost her tremulous sense of
apprehension when the bell went or the front door was tapped. She
let the milkman&mdash;and even the postman&mdash;wait.</p>

<p>When she spoke it was invariably of things that happened years
ago.</p>

<p>Sometimes she talked about the Stellings, and on one Sunday she
made a strange pilgrimage out to Finchley and visited Mr.
Stelling's grave. I don't know what she did there, but she returned
looking very exhausted and unwell. As a matter of fact, she was
unwell for some days after this visit, and she suffered violent
twinges of rheumatism in her legs.</p>

<p>I now come to my most unforgettable vision of Mrs. Ward.</p>

<p>It was a day at the end of April, and warm for the time of year.
I was standing in the garden with her and it was nearly dark. A
goods train had been shunting, and making a great deal of noise in
front of the house, and at last had disappeared. I had not been
able to help noticing that Mrs. Ward's garden was curiously
neglected for her for the time of year. The grass was growing on
the paths, and the snails had left their silver trail over all the
fences.</p>

<p>I was telling her a rumour I had heard about the railway porter
and his wife at number twenty-three, and she seemed fairly
interested, for she had known John Hemsley, the porter, fifteen
years ago, when Ernie was a baby. There were two old broken Windsor
chairs in the garden, and on one was a zinc basin in which were
some potatoes. She was peeling them, as Lily and her husband were
coming to supper. By the kitchen door was a small sink. When she
had finished the potatoes, she stood up and began to pour the water
down the sink, taking care not to let the skins go too. I was
noticing her old bent back, and her long bony hands gripping the
sides of the basin, when suddenly a figure came limping round the
bend of the house from the side passage, and two arms were thrown
round her waist, and a voice said:</p>

<p>"Mind them skins don't go down the sink, mother. They'll stop it
up!"</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>As I explained to Ernie afterwards, it was an extremely foolish
thing to do. If his mother had had anything wrong with her heart,
it might have been very serious. There have been many cases of
people dying from the shock of such an experience.</p>

<p>As it was, she merely dropped the basin and stood there
trembling like a leaf, and Ernie laughed loud and uproariously. It
must have been three or four minutes before she could regain her
speech, and then all she could manage to say was:</p>

<p>"Ernie!...My Ernie!"</p>

<p>And the boy laughed, and ragged his mother, and pulled her into
the house, and Tom appeared and stared at his son, and said
feebly:</p>

<p>"Well, I never!"</p>

<p>I don't know how it was that I found myself intruding upon the
sanctity of the inner life of the Ward family that evening. I had
never had a meal there before, but I felt that I was holding a sort
of watching brief over the soul and body of Mrs. Ward. I had had a
little medical training in my early youth, and this may have been
one of the reasons which prompted me to stay.</p>

<p>When Lily and her husband appeared we sat down to a meal of
mashed potatoes and onions stewed in milk, with bread and cheese,
and very excellent it was.</p>

<p>Lily and her husband took the whole thing in a boisterous, high
comedy manner that fitted in with the mood of Ernie. Old Tom sat
there staring at his son, and repeating at intervals:</p>

<p>"Well, I never!"</p>

<p>And Mrs. Ward hovered round the boy's plate. Her eyes divided
their time between his plate and his face, and she hardly spoke all
the evening.</p>

<p>Ernie's story was remarkable enough. He told it disconnectedly
and rather incoherently. There were moments when he rambled in a
rather peculiar way, and sometimes he stammered, and seemed unable
to frame a sentence. Lily's husband went out to fetch some beer to
celebrate the joyful occasion, and Ernie drank his in little sips,
and spluttered. The boy must have suffered considerably, and he had
a wound in the abdomen, and another in the right forearm which for
a time had paralysed him.</p>

<p>As far as I could gather, his story was this:</p>

<p>He and a platoon of men had been ambushed and had had to
surrender. When being sent back to a base, three of them tried to
escape from the train, which had been held up at night. He did not
know what had happened to the other two men, but it was on this
occasion that he received his abdominal wound at the hands of a
guard.</p>

<p>He had then been sent to some infirmary where he was fairly well
treated, but as soon as his wound had healed a little, he had been
suddenly sent to some fortress prison, presumably as a punishment.
He hadn't the faintest idea how long he had been confined there. He
said it seemed like fifteen years. It was probably nine months. He
had solitary confinement in a cell, which was like a small
lavatory. He had fifteen minutes' exercise every day in a yard with
some other prisoners, who were Russians he thought. He spoke to no
one. He used to sing and recite in his cell, and there were times
when he was quite convinced that he was "off his chump." He said he
had lost "all sense of everything" when he was suddenly transferred
to another prison. Here the conditions were somewhat better and he
was made to work. He said he wrote six or seven letters home from
there, but received no reply. The letters certainly never reached
Dalston. The food was execrable, but a big improvement on the
dungeon. He was only there a few weeks when he and some thirty
prisoners were sent suddenly to work on the land at a kind of
settlement. He said that the life there would have been tolerable
if it hadn't been for the fact that the Commandant was an absolute
brute. The food was worse than in the prison, and they were
punished severely for the most trivial offences.</p>

<p>It was here, however, that he met a sailor named Martin, a Royal
Naval reservist, an elderly thick-set man with a black beard and
only one eye. Ernie said that this Martin "was an artist. He
wangled everything. He had a genius for getting what he wanted. He
would get a beef-steak out of a stone." In fact, it was obvious
that the whole of Ernie's narrative was coloured by his vision of
Martin. He said he'd never met such a chap in his life. He admired
him enormously, and he was also a little afraid of him.</p>

<p>By some miraculous means peculiar to sailors, Martin acquired a
compass. Ernie hardly knew what a compass was, but the sailor
explained to him that it was all that was necessary to take you
straight to England. Ernie said he "had had enough of escaping. It
didn't agree with his health," but so strong was his faith and
belief in Martin that he ultimately agreed to try with him.</p>

<p>He said Martin's method of escape was the coolest thing he'd
ever seen. He planned it all beforehand. It was the fag-end of the
day, and the whistle had gone, and the prisoners were trooping back
across a potato-field. Martin and Ernie were very slow. They
lingered apparently to discuss some matter connected with the soil.
There were two sentries in sight, one near them and the other
perhaps a hundred yards away. The potato field was on a slope, at
the bottom of the field were two lines of barbed wire
entanglements. The other prisoners passed out of sight, and the
sentry near them called out something, probably telling them to
hurry up. They started to go up the field when suddenly Martin
staggered and clutched his throat. Then he fell over backwards and
commenced to have an epileptic fit. Ernie said it was the realest
thing he'd ever seen. The sentry ran up, at the same time whistling
to his comrade. Ernie released Martin's collar-band and tried to
help him. Both the sentries approached, and Ernie stood back. He
saw them bending over the prostrate man, when suddenly a most
extraordinary thing happened. Both their heads were brought
together with fearful violence. One fell completely senseless, but
the other staggered forward and groped for his rifle.</p>

<p>When Ernie told this part of the story he kept dabbing his
forehead with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"I never seen such a man as Martin I don't think," he said.
"Lord! He had a fist like a leg of mutton. He laid 'em out neatly
on the grass, took off their coats and most of their other clothes,
and flung 'em over the barbed wire, and then swarmed over like a
cat. I had more difficulty, but he got me across too, somehow. Then
we carted the clothes away to the next line.</p>

<p>"We got up into a wood that night, and Martin draws out his
compass and he says: 'We've got a hundred and seven miles to do in
night shifts, cully. And if we make a slip we're shot as safe as a
knife.' It sounded the maddest scheme in the world, but I somehow
felt that Martin would get through it. The only thing that saved me
was that&mdash;that I didn't have to think. I simply left
everything to him. If I'd started thinking I should have gone mad.
I had it fixed in my mind, 'either he does it or he doesn't do it.
I can't help it.' I reely don't remember much about that journey.
It was all a dream like. We did all our travellin' at night by
compass, and hid by day. Neither of us had a word of German. But
Gawd's truth! that man Martin was a marvel! He turned our trousers
inside out, and made 'em look like ordinary labourers' trousers. He
disappeared the first night and came back with some other old
clothes. We lived mostly on raw potatoes we dug out of the ground
with our hands, but not always. I believe Martin could have stole
an egg from under a hen without her noticing it. He was the coolest
card there ever was. Of course there was a lot of trouble one way
and another. It wasn't always easy to find wooded country or
protection of any sort. We often ran into people and they stared at
us, and we shifted our course. But I think we were only addressed
three or four times by men, and then Martin's methods were the
simplest in the world. He just looked sort of blank for a moment,
and then knocked them clean out, and bolted. Of course they were
after us all the time, and it was this constant tacking and
shifting ground that took so long. Fancy! he had never a map, you
know, nothing but the compass. We didn't know what sort of country
we were coming to, nothing. We just crept through the night like
cats. I believe Martin could see in the dark...He killed a dog one
night with his hands...It was necessary."</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>It was impossible to discover from Ernie how long this amazing
journey lasted&mdash;the best part of two months, I believe. He was
himself a little uncertain with regard to many incidents, whether
they were true or whether they were hallucinations. He suffered
greatly from his wound and had periods of feverishness. But one
morning, he said, Martin began "prancing." He seemed to develop
some curious sense that they were near the Dutch frontier. And
then, according to Ernie, "a cat wasn't in it with Martin."</p>

<p>He was very mysterious about the actual crossing. I gathered
that there had been some "clumsy" work with sentries. It was at
that time that Ernie got a bullet through his arm. When he got to
Holland he was very ill. It was not that the wound was a serious
one, but, as he explained:</p>

<p>"Me blood was in a bad state. I was nearly down and out."</p>

<p>He was very kindly treated by some Dutch Sisters in a convent
hospital. But he was delirious for a long time, and when he became
more normal they wanted to communicate with his people in England,
but this didn't appeal to the dramatic sense of Ernie.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd spring a surprise packet on you," he said,
grinning.</p>

<p>We asked about Martin, but Ernie said he never saw him again. He
went away while Ernie was delirious, and they said he had gone to
Rotterdam to take ship somewhere. He thought Holland was a dull
place.</p>

<p>During the relation of this narrative my attention was divided
between watching the face of Ernie and the face of Ernie's
mother.</p>

<p>I am quite convinced that she did not listen to the story at
all. She never took her eyes from his face, and although her tongue
was following the flow of his remarks, her mind was occupied with
the vision of Ernie when he was a little boy, and when he ordered
five tons of coal to be sent to the girls' school.</p>

<p>When he had finished she said:</p>

<p>"Did you meet either of them young Stellings?"</p>

<p>And Ernie laughed rather uproariously and said no, he didn't
have the pleasure of renewing their acquaintance.</p>

<p>On his way home, it appeared, he had reported himself at
headquarters, and his discharge was inevitable.</p>

<p>"So now you'll be able to finish the rabbit-hutch," said Lily's
husband, and we all laughed again, with the exception of Mrs.
Ward.</p>

<hr>

<p>I found her later standing alone in the garden. It was a warm
spring night. There was no moon, but the sky appeared restless with
its burden of trembling stars. She had an old shawl drawn round her
shoulders, and she stood there very silently, with her arms
crossed.</p>

<p>"Well, this is splendid news, Mrs. Ward," I said.</p>

<p>She started a little, and coughed, and pulled the shawl closer
round her.</p>

<p>She said, "Yes, sir," very faintly.</p>

<p>I don't think she was very conscious of me. She still appeared
immersed in the contemplation of her inner visions. Her eyes
settled upon the empty house next door, and I thought I detected
the trail of a tear glistening on her cheeks. I lighted my pipe. We
could hear Ernie, and Lily, and Lily's husband still laughing and
talking inside.</p>

<p>"She used to make a very good puddin'," Mrs. Ward said suddenly,
at random. "Dried fruit inside, and that. My Ernie liked it very
much..."</p>

<p>Somewhere away in the distance&mdash;probably outside "The
Unicorn"&mdash;someone was playing a cornet. A train crashed by and
disappeared, leaving a trail of foul smoke which obscured the sky.
The smoke cleared slowly away. I struck another match to light my
pipe.</p>

<p>It was quite true. On either side of her cheek a tear had
trickled. She was trembling a little, worn out by the emotions of
the evening.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, unusual for Dalston.</p>

<p>"It's all very...perplexin' and that," she said quietly.</p>

<p>And then I knew for certain that in that great hour of her
happiness her mind was assailed by strange and tremulous doubts.
She was thinking of "them others" a little wistfully. She was
doubting whether one could rejoice&mdash;when the thing became
clear and actual to one&mdash;without sending out one's thoughts
into the dark garden to "them others" who were suffering too. And
she had come out into this little meagre yard at Dalston and had
gazed through the mist and smoke upwards to the stars, because she
wanted peace intensely, and so she sought it within herself,
because she knew that real peace is a thing which concerns the
heart alone.</p>

<p>And so I left her standing there, and I went my way, for I knew
that she was wiser than I.</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>12. JUXTAPOSITIONS</h2>

<p>"Where we are all mixed up," said my friend, Samuel Squidge,
vigorously scraping down the "portrait of the artist, by himself,"
with a palette-knife, "is in our juxtapositions. It's all nonsense,
I tell you. People talk about a bad colour. There's no such thing
as a bad colour. Every colour is beautiful in its right
juxtaposition. When you hear a woman say 'I hate puce,' or, 'I love
green,' she might as well say 'I hate sky,' or, 'I love grass.' If
she had seen puce used in a colour-print as Hiroshige the Second
used it&mdash;green&mdash;fancy <i>loving</i> green! The idiot! Do
you remember what Corot said? He said Nature was too green and too
badly lighted. Now the old man was quite right&mdash;"</p>

<p>When Squidge starts talking in this strain he is rather apt to
go off the deep end. I yawned and murmured sweetly:</p>

<p>"We were talking about Colin St. Clair Chasseloup."</p>

<p>"Exactly! And I'm trying to point out to you how, with Colin St.
Clair Chasseloup, it's all a question of juxtapositions. You say
that Colin is a frozen drunkard, a surly bore, a high-pressure
nonentity. Listen to me. We're all nice people, every one of us.
Give a man the right air he should breathe, the right food he
should eat, the right work he should do, the right people he should
associate with, and he's a perfect dear, everyone of him. There
isn't a real irreconcilable on the earth. But the
juxtaposition&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What has Chasseloup to complain of? He has money, a charming
wife, children, a place in the country, a flat in town. He does
exactly what he likes."</p>

<p>Squidge surveyed me with amazement.</p>

<p>"You ass! You prize ass! I thought you wrote about people. I
thought you were supposed to understand people! And there you go
and make a smug, asinine remark like that."</p>

<p>I blushed, fully conscious that Squidge was being justifiably
merciless. It was an asinine statement, but then I was merely
putting out a feeler, and I could not explain this to the portrait
painter. After all, I did not really know St. Clair Chasseloup. He
was only a club acquaintance, and a very unclubbable acquaintance
he was. He appeared to dislike club life. To a stranger he seemed
to reek of patrician intolerance. He was an aristocrat of
aristocrats. His well set-up, beautifully groomed figure, clean-cut
features, well-poised head were all in the classic tradition of a
ruling caste. It was only about the rather heavy eyelids and the
restless mouth that one detected the cynic, the disappointed man,
the disillusioned boor. Why?...It was no affair of mine, the secret
troubles of this man's heart. But it was his business to behave
himself to me decently. To hell with Colin St. Clair Chasseloup! I
disliked the man. But then we all dislike people whom we feel
nurture an innate sense of superiority to us. Added to this trying
exterior of complete self-absorption and superiority, one had also
to allow for the vanity of the cripple.</p>

<p>St. Clair Chasseloup had lost his right leg just below the knee.
It happened before the war. Indeed, at the time when he was a naval
cadet at Osborne, skylarking with other young cadets, he had
slipped from a pinnace on a rough day and his right foot had been
crushed against the stone wall of a jetty. The leg had to be
amputated. That was the end of his naval career. And his father had
been a commodore before him, and his father's father was in the
Battle of Trafalgar, and so on right away back to the spacious days
of Elizabeth&mdash;all naval men. Devilish bad luck, you may say!
Of course, one had to allow for the bitterness that this misfortune
must have produced. At the same time it doesn't excuse a man not
answering when he's spoken to by a fellow-member at the club, or
for looking at one&mdash;like Chasseloup did!</p>

<p>Squidge's championship of the thwarted seaman amused me. You
could not conceive a more remarkable contrast. I was not even aware
that they knew each other. In spite of his missing limb, St. Clair
Chasseloup was the kind of man who always looked as though he had
just had a cold bath, done Swedish drill, and then passed through
the hairdresser's on his way to your presence. He was aggressively
fit. Squidge looked as though a walk to the end of the street would
have brought on valvular disease of the heart. From the centre of a
dank beard, limp ends of cigarettes eternally clung. Physically, he
was just comic. It was his vivid eyes and his queer excitable voice
that told you that he was a person of no mean vitality. He was just
as sociable and optimistic as Chasseloup was taciturn and moribund.
And yet they met on some old plane, it appeared. Well, well, I
could understand Squidge finding merit in Chasseloup, indeed in
anyone, but what would Chasseloup's opinion of Squidge be? It made
me shudder to contemplate. On the occasion I am recounting it was
almost impossible to extract any further intimate details out of
Squidge, for he had flown off on one of his pet theoretical
tangents.</p>

<p>"It's a queer rum thing," he was saying, "why people ever get
married at all. You simply can't get level with it&mdash;the most
unlikely, most outrageous combinations! The more outrageous the
more likely they are to be a success. You see some scraggy goat of
a woman and you think to yourself, 'Poor wretch! whatever sort of
chance has she got of getting married?' and the next thing you hear
is that she's married to some god who adores her, and they have a
large family of boys at Harrow and girls at Girton. Queer! Another
woman breathes sunlight and the men pursue her, and nothing
happens. She's unhappy. I know a woman who is married to a man she
is apparently in love with, and he with her. They have two jolly
kids, a boy and a girl. They are a most delightful, happy family.
They have money and are bursting with health and good spirits, and
yet nearly every year the mother gets fits of melancholia, and has
to go away to a nursing home and lie up for months. Some genius has
said that when contemplating marriage, what you want to seek in
common is not intellectual ambitions and tastes, it's recreations.
It's quite right. Generally speaking, a man's at work all day, so
is a woman. When they meet in the evening they want to get away
from it. It's the time when they spread their feathers. If they can
play and fool around they can be happy. Life for the most part is a
drab monologue. It's when you come to the accents you want each
other...If you can share the same tooth-brush with a woman for
twenty-five years and she can still surprise you, then you're all
right, both of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Squidge, what has your disgusting notion with regard to
the tooth-brush to do with St. Clair Chasseloup?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I'm talking."</p>

<p>"I noticed that. Tell me frankly. Would you say that he and his
wife&mdash;Aim&eacute;e, isn't it?&mdash;have recreations in
common?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"Bach."</p>

<p>"Bach! what are you talking about? Colin St. Clair Chasseloup!
Bach!"</p>

<p>"It seems funny to you, doesn't it? You know him and you've seen
her. You know him, all beef and phlegm, the immovable mass. A man
who thinks of nothing but dumbbells and double Scotches. And you've
seen her, the daughter of a hundred earls, highly-strung,
aesthetic, a little queer, passionately devoted to ultra-modern
music, Cou&eacute;, Montessori, anything and everything that crops
up. They've nothing in common, you might say. He's out all day,
playing a surly game of golf, or loafing in a club. She's playing
the piano, Ravel, Debussy, or some of those queer Russian Johnnies.
Or else she's inventing cute devices for the upbringing of the
precious children. He lets them rip. She spoils them. When you see
them together you would say that they were two people who had just
missed their last bus and had to walk home, each thinking it was
the other's fault. And yet I tell you they are the only two people
suitable to each other. They have a mutual appreciation of
accents&mdash;the same accents. They meet in the solemn tonal
climaxes of Bach&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can't believe that Colin likes Bach."</p>

<p>"I didn't once. I found out through my pal, Paul Furtwangler,
the 'cellist. He goes there several nights a week&mdash;she pays
him well, too&mdash;and he just plays Bach. It soothes the savage
beast. It keeps him at home, quietens him, stays his hand from the
whisky bottle. It's marvellous. He can't abide Chopin, or all the
jolly tuneful stuff barbarians like you and I enjoy. There's
something about it, I suppose, the orderliness, the precision, the
organic building up of solemn structures that just fills the kink
in his life made by his tragic defection. She hoiks him to St.
Anne's, Soho, to hear the oratorios. They chase the Bach choir
hither and thither. She plays it herself, although she's not much
of a performer. That's why she gets Furtwangler and sometimes the
Stinzel quartette. When they are listening to Bach together, they
meet on a plane of complete satisfaction. Of course, the war didn't
do him any good. He used to hobble backwards and forwards to
Whitehall doing some ridiculous anti-aircraft intelligence stuff,
and he used to look bitterly at his pals when he saw them prancing
backwards and forwards, with the salt of the North Sea bitten into
their faces. He was a good boy in those days, though. He left the
bottle alone, and only groused and grumbled. Weren't we all doing
that?...That's what I mean about people&mdash;married people
especially&mdash;you can never tell whether they are happy or not.
We all have to live our own lives in our own way. The breezy couple
who go about singing 'La, too, te rum, tum, tumple, rum, tum,
tootle, tootle, lay,' and who kiss in public, and say 'darling
this' and 'darling that,' you generally find that one or both
parties are carrying on a secret liaison with a cook or a
chauffeur. Colin has just got to be like that, and the woman
understands him. She doesn't want him different. While he is like
that she has a more complete grip over him, because she knows that
no other woman will understand or tolerate him. And they don't. Of
course, they quarrel sometimes, and he goes off and makes no end of
a beast of himself. But she knows she is secure. He will come
whining back to her like a whipped puppy. And he will grope for her
in the darkness, and she will hold his hand, and they will listen
to the solemn chords of a Bach fugue, and will feel horribly
melancholy, and tremendously moved, and somehow completely
satisfied. That's just people, they're like that. It's no good
arguing about it. I must be going. I'm going to have a Turkish bath
with Smithers."</p>

<p>The contemplation of Squidge in a Turkish bath talking to
Smithers, who is enormously fat, held me for the moment, and then
my mind reverted to Chasseloup.</p>

<p>Dash it! you couldn't help being interested in the beast. I had
to acknowledge that, in spite of his rudeness and indifference to
me, the man had somehow always attracted me. I suppose because I
wanted to know him, his rudeness and indifference piqued me all the
more. And his wife&mdash;well, there it was, I had only seen her in
concert-halls and theatres, and riding about in taxis with him, but
that peculiarly wistful face would have enslaved anyone. She was
slight and fragile, with pale face and very red lips, and that
curious gleaming blue-black hair that so often accompanies a pallid
complexion. Her eyes were wonderful, large, reflective, dark, with
terrific things going on in them all the time. At the same time I
shouldn't describe them as altogether unhappy eyes. They reflected
too much vital movement for that. The woman was living, and of how
many of these hard-bitten society women can you say the same?</p>

<p>It happened that a few nights after my talk with Squidge, I met
Chasseloup at the club. He was sitting in a corner of the
smoking-room, drinking whisky and being talked to by one of the pet
club bores. He occasionally growled a monosyllabic reply. After a
time the club bore retired and I was left alone with him. I sat
back and smoked, but did not speak. We must have sat like that for
nearly twenty minutes. There must have been something about this
conspiracy of silence which appealed to Chasseloup. I was aware of
him occasionally glancing at me, and at length he actually ventured
to address a remark. He said:</p>

<p>"This club whisky gets worse every day."</p>

<p>I believe I must have blushed with pleasure as I hastened to
acquiesce.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's awful stuff."</p>

<p>(Did you ever know a club where the members didn't all agree
that the food and drink supplied was the worst in town?)</p>

<p>After a few snappy sentences about the club whisky, Chasseloup
even went so far as to generalise. He said:</p>

<p>"Fancy reaching the stage of Colonel Robbins, a man who led a
brigade in South Africa, and now there's nothing left for him in
life but to serve on wine committees."</p>

<p>I was startled by this sociable reflection, and before I could
reply, he had capped it with:</p>

<p>"Even over that he's come to the end of his tether. His palate
is worn out."</p>

<p>He rose abruptly and rang the bell and ordered some more of the
inferior stuff. This insignificant conversation seemed to form a
bond between Chasseloup and myself. From that evening onwards his
attitude towards me underwent a change. It was not that he talked
much, but I was aware that I was one of the few members who didn't
get on his nerves. It was extremely flattering.</p>

<p>"All right, my friend," I thought. "I'll find out all about you
yet."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there was a long interval of time between that
conversation and the eventful Sunday evening, when I met him and
his wife at the Minerva Musical Society's function at the Grafton
Galleries.</p>

<p>Now it is not of the slightest importance, except as it affects
the chronicle of the events I am about to describe, but I have to
say that my own tastes with regard to music are catholic,
cosmopolitan, and undistinguished. I like Chopin and Schumann, and
most of the Old Masters. I like Bach when I'm in the mood. I even
like Jazz music sometimes, and foxtrots, and barrel-organs, and Old
Bill playing his mouth-organ. But I must confess that what is known
as the modern British composer leaves me cold. Perhaps I'm not
educated up to him. And the activities of the Minerva Musical
Society are almost entirely concerned with the modern British
composer. Crowds of very precious overfed and underfed people meet
together, and they sit on little gilt chairs and burble with
delight about the productions of Mr. Cyrus P. Q. H. Robinson, or
the tone poem of Ananathius K. Smith. I know nothing about it. They
may be right. The only thing I have to record is that it bores me.
The only reason I went to this particular evening was&mdash;and it
is a weakness common to many weak-minded creatures like
myself&mdash;that my wife took me. She is more eclectic about these
matters than I am. She knows more, and so probably she is quite
right in believing that Cyrus and Ananathius are geniuses. That
isn't the point. The point is, I was frankly bored. And early in
the evening, looking round the room, and confessing to myself that
I was frankly bored, I suddenly happened to notice that the two
people who had just come in and were sitting just behind us were
Mr. and Mrs. Colin St. Clair Chasseloup. Immediately my boredom
vanished. Here was a human problem of more interest than the
scherzo movement of Mr. Cyrus P. Q. H. Robinson's F minor sonata. I
looked round and fidgeted, and my wife said: "Hush!"</p>

<p>And then without any question I heard Chasseloup say in a rather
rude, abrupt voice:</p>

<p>"I'm not going to listen to any more of this drivel."</p>

<p>And he got up and walked to the back of the room.</p>

<p>With two per cent. of his aplomb I got up and whispered:</p>

<p>"I don't care for this very much, dear. I'll just go and smoke a
cigarette."</p>

<p>I strolled out and found Chasseloup in the corridor. He was
looking thoroughly irritable. I went straight up to him and
said:</p>

<p>"What about a drink, Chasseloup?"</p>

<p>His face cleared perceptibly. He gave me quite a friendly nod,
and muttered:</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>I must now pay a tribute to that most sound of all social
conventions&mdash;namely, that of evening dress. It will carry one
through almost any difficulty. Chasseloup and I were both in
evening dress.</p>

<p>We wandered out into Grafton Street just as we were, without
hats or coats. He had gone barely twenty yards when I had to
exclaim:</p>

<p>"Good God! It's Sunday night! Everything is shut. We are just
five minutes too late. I'm awfully sorry old boy."</p>

<p>It was interesting to watch the play of expression on
Chasseloup's face. The jolt of irritation, the attempt to control a
recognition of the jolt, and then the sudden ugly thrust of the
chin. He merely said:</p>

<p>"Let's see what we can do."</p>

<p>But there was in that thrust all the perverse tendency of a man
who meant to get a drink, not because he particularly wanted it,
but because he was annoyed at being thwarted.</p>

<p>We took two sharp turns to the left&mdash;or the right&mdash;and
we came to a street, the name of which I mustn't tell you,
otherwise the whole story becomes almost libellous. In any case, we
were not five minutes' walk from the Grafton Galleries, and we were
going down a world-renowned street, consecrated chiefly to very
swell private clubs. Suddenly Chasseloup jerked out:</p>

<p>"That looks a good place. Let's try it."</p>

<p>From the exterior it was quite obvious what it was. It was a
very select private club, probably an exclusive ornithologists'
club, or a club consecrated to men who had won honours for
discovering the secrets of subaqueous plant-life. I don't know.
Chasseloup didn't know; but without the slightest hesitation we
strolled casually into the smoke-room. The commissionaire glanced
at us questioningly, but one look at Chasseloup convinced him that
he was wrong in his doubts. With a proprietary air, Chasseloup
flung himself into an easy chair on the right of the fire, and I
occupied the left. There were only two old gentlemen in the room,
and they were so absorbed in a conversation about goitres they
didn't notice us. An ancient waiter appeared&mdash;a man who must
have been there at least thirty years&mdash;and he came timidly
forward. He was about to take orders in a mechanical way, and then
he looked at us, and a curious sense, of misgiving seemed to creep
over him, not as though he were suspecting us, but as though he
were suspecting his own memory. Chasseloup, with his white
waistcoat and gilt buttons, his braided trousers and commanding
atmosphere, couldn't be anything but a most distinguished
member.</p>

<p>The waiter fumbled clumsily with a tray, and murmured
defensively:</p>

<p>"You gentlemen are stopping the night, I presume?"</p>

<p>An expression of unctuous indignation settled on Chasseloup's
features.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said.</p>

<p>The old waiter almost crawled on the carpet and took our order
for two double whiskies. Thus, you may see what a domineering
personality, backed up by evening dress, may accomplish. I could
not possibly have done this by myself, but in the presence of
Chasseloup I felt quite like an old member of this club of which I
did not even know the name.</p>

<p>Chasseloup was not by any means a drunkard. But I
discovered&mdash;at least, I have discovered later&mdash;that he
considers three double whiskies his right and lawful due for an
evening. They do not appear to have the slightest effect on him. We
had two in this club&mdash;we were in there less than ten
minutes&mdash;and then he said:</p>

<p>"We'll have one more somewhere else and then toddle back."</p>

<p>It appeared to me to have been a sufficient triumph to have
broken the laws of the land so successfully and speedily, without
challenging Fate further. Indeed, if we wanted one more drink we
could easily have obtained it where we were. But it was quite
patent that it was the very facility which was the obstacle in
Chasseloup's case. It was all too dead easy. There was no fun in
having a drink unless you had to fight for it. We had risen and
walked to the door. Just as we reached the entrance hall, a man who
looked like a butler came stealthily in from the street. He glanced
anxiously at us, and then going up to Chasseloup, he whispered:</p>

<p>"Limpo?"</p>

<p>Now Chasseloup naturally had got a limp, and I expected to see
this piece of impertinence drastically handled. Whatever was the
fool getting at? But Chasseloup gave no sign. He just stared hard
at the other, who quickly added:</p>

<p>"Her ladyship says will you come across immediately? I'll show
you the way."</p>

<p>Chasseloup hesitated for a fraction of a second, then, squaring
his shoulders, he said:</p>

<p>"Come on, then."</p>

<p>It was quite apparent that he had not the faintest idea what
adventure he was committed to. Crossing the street, I
whispered:</p>

<p>"What's it all about?"</p>

<p>And he whispered back:</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I guess we'll get our third drink."</p>

<p>We went into a palatial block of flats and entered a lift. We
were whisked up five floors and ushered into a heavily carpeted
hall. The butler left us and did not return for three or four
minutes. When he did he seemed all on edge. He said nervously to
Chasseloup:</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;would you mind your friend waiting outside, sir?"</p>

<p>Chasseloup spoke emphatically:</p>

<p>"No, tell her ladyship that where Limpo goes Blotto
follows."</p>

<p>There was another interval, and then the butler returned and
asked us both to follow him.</p>

<p>We went into a large smoking-room, sparsely furnished. The room
was occupied by three men. They were all big men, and they were all
standing. On the hearthrug stood one of the most sinister-looking
individuals I have ever seen. He was very tall, with heavy
shoulders and a fierce black moustache and wicked eyes. There was
something about the way the men were standing I didn't like. It
appeared to be all carefully planned. The big man, whose voice
seemed surprisingly thin for his bulk, said banteringly:</p>

<p>"Oh, come in, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Limpo. Julius Lindt, perhaps I
should say. It pains me to tell you that her ladyship is not
present, unavoidably detained&mdash;see?"</p>

<p>Chasseloup bowed formally, and said in an ice-cold voice:</p>

<p>"I regret to hear it."</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;um&mdash;yes. Yes, quite so. I can quite believe it. I
presume you are a great reader of <i>The Times</i>,
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Limpo, Lindt I should say."</p>

<p>"I always read <i>The Times</i>," answered Chasseloup
politely.</p>

<p>"Yes, and write for them, advertise, too,
Mr&mdash;er&mdash;Lindt. Nice, friendly, loving little paragraphs,
eh?"</p>

<p>He held out a copy of <i>The Times</i>, the outside sheet
showing. Round one paragraph someone had put a blue pencil line.
The big man thrust it in Chasseloup's face and said:</p>

<p>"Just read that out, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a nasty dangerous tone in his voice. I didn't like it
at all. I began to think lovingly of the Minerva Society, the
little gilt chairs, and Cyrus P. Q. H. Robinson's F minor sonata.
Chasseloup was perfectly calm. He never took his eyes off the other
man's face. He said coldly:</p>

<p>"My friend, Blotto, will read it."</p>

<p>The paper was handed to me, and I read out from the agony
column:</p>

<p>"Molly. Am yearning for you. Shall be at the Club Sunday night.
If the Dragon is away, send over for me. All my love. Limpo."</p>

<p>I was too nervous to see the humour of the situation. Here was
the outraged husband and by great guile he had captured the wrong
<i>tertium quid!</i> How could one explain? Chasseloup's
regrettable limp appeared damning evidence. He had gone there, and
deliberately put his head through the noose. The situation was
appalling. The worst of it was, that under such circumstances men
do not stop to think and reason. Passion and mob-law are old
confederates. This fact was brought home during the ensuing
seconds. Everything seemed to happen in a flash. I was conscious of
the Dragon stretching out his hand towards a short, stocky
riding-whip, which had been concealed by the fireplace; of the
other two men stealthily closing in on Chasseloup. And then a
fourth man&mdash;was it the butler?&mdash;gripped me by the throat
from behind, and I was jerked towards the door. The idea was to get
me out of the way whilst the other three men horsewhipped
Chasseloup. I fell backwards into the hall, and the door slammed
to. At least, it nearly did. It was slammed with terrific violence,
but just in the nick of time a leg was thrust through. Now the
force with which it was pushed would have broken any ordinary leg,
but as it happened the leg that was thrust through was made of wood
and steel framing.</p>

<p>The arms above were apparently engaged elsewhere. The sight of
that upturned boot spurred me to action. I drove my elbows
violently into the ribs of my attacker. I heard him groan, and I
leapt forward to the door again. I think he must have been the
butler. I never saw him again. When I forced my way back into the
room, I think the moral effect of my presence was more valuable to
our side than any physical exploit I was likely to offer. Three men
against two are not overwhelming odds. The man just in front of the
door, who was gripping Chasseloup by the waist, hesitated, and paid
the penalty by getting a blow over his left eye. The other two men
were closing in, when Chasseloup ducked and got free. It was then
that I saw the man as he really was. His eyes were gleaming with
exultation. He was thoroughly enjoying himself. With a sudden
unexpected swerve he seized a vase and smashed the electric light
globes. The room was in darkness.</p>

<p>Now for a mixed body of men to fight in the dark is a dangerous
and difficult game. You do not know who is with you or against you.
Oaths were exchanged rather than blows. And the Dragon called
out:</p>

<p>"Where's Dawson? Where's that&mdash; butler?"</p>

<p>Then he gave a curse which showed that he was foolish to reveal
his whereabouts. One fool struck a match, which served no better
purpose than to reveal the point of his jaw, a fact that was
promptly taken advantage of. He went down and out. We were now two
against two, and one of them had a black eye that would last many a
week. The Dragon was blind with rage. He roared:</p>

<p>"Come out into the hall!"</p>

<p>And he stumbled out there and waved his arms challengingly. We
all followed him. The man with the black eye had had enough, and I
sat on the opposite side of the hall also a spectator. For it
seemed to be suddenly mutually agreed that this was an affair
between the Dragon and Chasseloup. They both wanted to fight. I
could have yelled out that the whole thing was a mistake, a
misunderstanding, that Chasseloup was not the man who had liaisons
with the other man's wife; but if I had done so I felt that
Chasseloup would never forgive me. He had already taken his coat
off, and so had the Dragon. And they fought. An affair of this
nature between two heavyweights seldom lasts long. It depends so
much on who gets in the first good blow. And in this case the fight
certainly didn't last three minutes. It was horrible. I don't know
whether the Dragon was much of a boxer. He certainly seemed to have
some knowledge of the game, but he never landed a blow. After a few
exchanges he received a punch on the nose, and the blood ran down
all over his dress shirt. Then he hit wildly, and suddenly received
three terrible blows in rapid succession; one on the chin, one on
the jaw, and then a fearful thump over the heart, which laid him
out. We were now in complete possession of the field, the man with
the black eye being the only conscious enemy in the flat, and he
had done with fighting for the day.</p>

<p>"Now, where's that butler?" said Chasseloup.</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, for God's sake!" I exclaimed, foreseeing more
blood-letting. "Leave the butler alone. Let's get away."</p>

<p>"I'm not going till I get what I came for."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"That drink."</p>

<p>The man with the black eye, who appeared to be some sort of
hired ruffian grinned in a sickly manner.</p>

<p>"All right, guv'nor," he said; "I can fix that for you."</p>

<p>He went into the dining-room and returned with a tantalus and
some glasses.</p>

<p>Chasseloup poured himself out his double whisky, just the exact
amount, and no more. Then he put on his coat and readjusted his
hair in the mirror. His face was unscratched.</p>

<p>"There's something perfectly disgusting about you," I
thought.</p>

<p>When he left the flat the Dragon was partly conscious, and he
was mumbling something about the police and firearms and vengeance.
We went down in the lift. Just as we were going out through the
entrance hall a typical young-man-about-town came up the steps. He
was limping. Chasseloup raised his hat.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lindt, I presume?"</p>

<p>The young man started. Chasseloup smiled quite graciously.</p>

<p>"Her ladyship is expecting you in the smoke-room," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh! thank you, thank you, sir."</p>

<p>The dude blushed and hurried on.</p>

<p>"But, good Lord!" I exclaimed, when we were in the street. "It's
a bit unfair. They'll half murder him."</p>

<p>"That's his affair," said Chasseloup. "Besides, it serves him
right&mdash;to go fooling about with another man's wife."</p>

<p>To look back on it, it seems almost unbelievable, but from the
moment when we left the Minerva Musical Society to the moment we
returned marks the lapse of rather less than an hour. And when we
returned nothing might have happened at all. There they all were,
the same people, the same little gilt chairs. Everybody looked
quite unconcerned, but nobody looked more unconcerned than Colin
St. Clair Chasseloup, lolling indolently on a stuffed settee at the
end of the room.</p>

<p>As it happened, they were just finishing some modern work, and
then there was an interval. Both our wives joined us and were
introduced. Mrs. Chasseloup was charming. She said:</p>

<p>"You bad men! where have you been?"</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, she added excitedly:</p>

<p>"Colin, you'll be pleased. Paul Tingleton's ill, and he can't
lead his quintette. And I've persuaded Mr. Oesler to end up with
the Bach fugue you love so much."</p>

<p>Queer fish, people are. A few minutes later we were drinking
lemonade and coffee and talking of such precious intimacies as the
colour of a musical phrase, and only a quarter of an hour
ago&mdash; Then we were back in the concert hall, Chasseloup and
his wife and my wife and I, and the great Mr. Oesler began to play
Bach.</p>

<p>And then the queerest thing of all&mdash;Chasseloup! Chasseloup,
whose face I had seen but a few minutes before ablaze with anger
and cruelty, suddenly mellowing, becoming gentle and wistful. And
he leaned forward with his lips parted, and his wife sat beside him
with an identical expression on her face. And then I saw his hand
steal towards her lap, and she took it in both of hers and gripped
it greedily. And they sat there, side by side, perfectly oblivious
to their surroundings, perfectly happy, like two children listening
to a fairy-tale.</p>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>13. THE FUNNY MAN'S DAY</h2>

<p>His round fat little face appeared seraphic in sleep. If only
the hair were not greying at the temples and getting very, very
thin on top, and the lines about the eyes and mouth becoming rather
too accentuated, it might have been the head of one of Donatello's
<i>bambini</i>. It was not until Mrs. Lamb, his ancient
housekeeper, bustled into the room with a can and said: "Your
water, Mr. Basingstoke"&mdash;the intrusion causing him to open his
eyes&mdash;that it became apparent that he was a man past
middle-age. His eyes were very large&mdash;"goose-gog eyes" the
children called them. As elderly people will, it took him some few
moments to focus his mentality. A child will wake up, and carry on
from the exact instant it went to sleep; but it takes a middle-aged
man or woman a moment or so to realise where they are, what day in
the week it is, what happened yesterday, what is going to happen
to-day, whether they are happy or not. Certainly with regard to the
latter query there is always a subconscious pressure which warns
them. Almost before they have decided which day in the week it is,
a voice is whispering: "Something occurred yesterday to make you
unhappy," or, "Things are going well. You are happy just now," and
then the true realisation of their affairs, and loves, and passions
unfolds itself. They continue yesterday's story.</p>

<p>As to James Jasper Basingstoke, it was not his business to
indulge in the slightest apprehension with regard to his condition
of happiness or unhappiness. He was a funny man. It was his
profession, his mission, his natural gift. From early morning, when
his housekeeper awakened him, till, playing with the
children&mdash;all the children adored him&mdash;practising,
interviewing managers and costumiers, dropping into the club and
exchanging stories with some of the other "dear old boys," right on
until he had finished his second show at night it was his mission
to leave behind him a long trail of smiles and laughter.
Consequently, he merely sat up in bed, blinked and called out:</p>

<p>"I am deeply indebted to your Lambship."</p>

<p>"Nibby's got hiccups," replied that lady, who was not unused to
this term of address. Nibby was Mrs. Lamb's grandson. His real name
was Percy Alexander. The grand-daughter's name was Violetta Gladys,
and she was known as Tibby. They lived next door. These names, of
course, had been invented by the Funny Man, who lived in a world of
make-believe, where no one at all was known by their real name. He
himself was known in the theatrical profession as "Willy
Nilly."</p>

<p>"I am distressed to hear that," exclaimed Willy Nilly.
"Hiccoughs at nine o'clock in the morning! You don't say so! I
always looked upon it as a nocturnal disease. The result of too
many hic, haec, hock cups."</p>

<p>"You must have your fun, Mr. Basingstoke, but the pore little
feller has been very bad ever since he woke up."</p>

<p>Willy Nilly leapt out of bed and rolled across to the chest of
drawers. He there produced a bottle containing little white
capsules, two of which he handed to Mrs. Lamb.</p>

<p>"Crunch these up and swallow with a little milk, then lie on his
back and think of emerald green parrots flying above a dark forest,
where monkeys are hanging by their tails. In our profession the
distress of hiccoughs is quite prevalent and we always cure it in
this way. A man who can't conquer hiccoughs can never expect to top
the bill. Now tell Master Nibby that, dear lady."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lamb looked at the white capsules interestingly.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean that, Mr. Basingstoke?"</p>

<p>The little fat man struck a dramatic situation.</p>

<p>"Did you ever find me not a man of my word, Lady Lamb?"</p>

<p>"You are a <b>one</b>," replied the housekeeper, and retired,
holding the capsules carefully balanced in the centre of her right
palm, as though they contained some secret charm which she was
fearful of dispelling by her contact.</p>

<p>The little fat man thrust out his arms in the similitude of some
long-forgotten clumsy exercise. Then he regarded himself in the
mirror.</p>

<p>"Not too thumbs up, old boy, not too thumbs up. It's going, you
know. All the Apollo beauty&mdash;Oh, you little depraved ruffian,
go and hold your head under the tap."</p>

<p>No, no, it was not the business of Willy Nilly to be depressed
by these reflections either in the mirror or upon the mind. He
seized the strop suspended from a hook on the architrave of the
window and began to flash his razor backward and forward whilst he
sang:</p>

<p class="poem">"Oh, what care I for a new feather bed,<br>
And a sheet turned down so bravely&mdash;O."</p>

<p>The raggle-taggle gypsies accompanied him intermittently
throughout the whole operation of shaving, including the slight cut
just beneath the lobe of his left ear. The business of washing and
dressing was no perfunctory performance with the Funny Man. He had
a personality to sustain. Moreover, among the programme of
activities for the day included attendance at a wedding. There is
nothing at which a funny man can be so really funny as at a
wedding. One funny man at least is almost essential for the success
of this time-honoured ritual. And this was a very, very special
wedding; the wedding of his two dearest and greatest friends, Katie
Easebrook the pretty comedienne, and Charlie Derrick, that most
brilliant writer of ballads. A swell affair it was to be in Clapham
Parish Church, with afterward a reception at the Hautboy
Hotel&mdash;everything to be done "in the best slap-up style, old
boy."</p>

<p>No wonder Willy Nilly took an unconscionable time folding his
voluminous black stock, adorned with the heavy gold pin, removing
the bold check trousers from withunder the mattress, tugging at the
crisp white waistcoat till it adapted itself indulgently to the
curves of his figure, and hesitating for fully five minutes between
the claims of seven different kinds of kid gloves. A man who tops
the bill at even a suburban music-hall cannot afford to neglect
these things. It was fully three quarters of an hour before he
presented himself in the dining-room below. Mrs. Lamb appeared
automatically with the teapot and his one boiled egg.</p>

<p>"You'd hardly believe it," she said, "but Nibby took them white
pills and his hiccups is abated."</p>

<p>"Ah! What did you expect, my good woman? Was Willy Nilly likely
to deceive an innocent child? Did he think of emerald green parrots
and a dark forest?"</p>

<p>"I told him what you said, Mr. Basingstoke. Here's the letters
and the newspaper."</p>

<p>The Funny Man's correspondence was always rather extensive,
consisting for the most part of letters from unknown people
commencing: "Dear Sir,&mdash;I wrote the enclosed words for a comic
song last Sunday afternoon. I should think set to music you would
make them very funny&mdash;" or "Dear Sir,&mdash;I had a good idea
for a funny stunt for you. Why not sing a song dressed up as a
curate called: 'The higher I aspire I espy her,' and every time you
come to the word higher, you trip up over a piece of orange peel. I
leave it to you about payment for this idea, but I may say I am in
straightened circumstances, and my wife is expecting another next
March."</p>

<p>There was a certain surprising orderliness about the Funny Man's
methods. Receipts were filed, accounts kept together and paid
fairly regularly, suggestions and ideas were carefully considered,
begging letters placed together, with a sigh, "in case anything
could be done a little later on, old boy." Occasionally would come
a chatty letter from some old friend "on the road," or from his
married sister in Yorkshire. But for the most part his
correspondence was not of an intimate nature.</p>

<p>His newspaper this morning remained unopened. The contemplation
of his own programme for the day was too absorbing to fritter away
nervous energy on public affairs. Whilst cracking the egg, he
visualised his time-table. At ten o'clock, Chris Read was coming to
try over new songs and stunts. At eleven-fifteen, he had an
appointment with Albus, the costumier in Long Acre, to set the
stamp of his approval upon the wig and nose for his new song: "I'm
one of the Goo-goo boys." Kate and Charlie's was at twelve-thirty
and the wedding breakfast at "the Hautboy" at one-forty-five. In
the meantime, he must write two letters and manage to call on old
Mrs. Labbory, his former landlady, who was very, very ill. Poor old
soul! She'd been a brick to him in the old days, when he was
sometimes "out" for seven months in the year, out and penniless. It
was only fair now that he should help her a bit with the rent, and
see that she had everything she needed.</p>

<p>Willy Nilly's life had been passed through an avenue of
landladies, but the position of Mrs. Labbory was unique. He had
been with her fifteen years and she was intimate with all his
intimates.</p>

<p>At three-forty-five was a rehearsal with the Railham Empire
orchestra. He must get that gag right where he bluffs the trombone
player in his song: "Oh, my in-laws, my in-laws, why don't you
leave me be." Perhaps a cup of tea somewhere, and then an
appointment at five-fifteen with Welsh, to arrange terms about the
renewal of contract. Knotty and difficult problems&mdash;contracts.
Everyone trying to do you down&mdash;must have a clear head at
five-fifteen. If there's time, perhaps pop into the club for half
an hour, exchange stories with Jimmy Landish, or old Blakeney. A
chop at six-thirty&mdash;giving him an hour before making-up for
the first house. On at eight-twenty. Three songs and an
encore&mdash;mustn't forget to speak to Hignet about that
spotlight, the operator must have been drunk last night. Between
shows interview a local pressman, and a young man who "wants to go
on the stage, but has had no experience." Dash round for a sandwich
and a refresher. On again at ten-twenty-five. Same three songs,
same encore, same bluff on the trombone player. Ten-fifty, all
clear. Clean up and escape from the theatre if possible.</p>

<p>A last nightcap at the club, perhaps? Oh, but Bird Craft wanted
him to toddle along to his rooms and hear a new song he had just
acquired, "a real winner," Bird had said it was, about "The girl
and the empty pram." Must stand by an old pal. Sometime during the
day he must send two suits to be cleaned, and order some new
underlinen. A beastly boring business, ordering vests and pants. He
knew nothing about the qualities of materials&mdash;hosiers surely
did him over that. Really a woman's business, women knew about
these things. Mrs. Lamb! No, not exactly Mrs. Lamb. He couldn't ask
Mrs. Lamb to go and buy him vest and pants. A woman's business, a
woman&mdash;</p>

<p>Heigho! Nearly ten o'clock already. Chris Read might arrive any
minute. The Funny Man dashed downstairs and ran into the house next
door. Tibby had already gone off to school, but Nibby had escaped,
because at the moment of departure his attack of hiccoughs had
reached its apotheosis. Now he was in trouble because it had left
off, and his mother now declared he had been pretending. It took
the Funny Man fifteen minutes to calm this family trouble. Nibby,
putting it on! Nibby, playing the wag! Oh, come! Fie and for shame!
Besides did Nibby's mother think that he, Dr. Willy Nilly, the
eminent specialist of Harley Street, was a quack? Were his remedies
spurious remedies?</p>

<p>"Did you think of emerald green parrots in a dark wood,
Nibby?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And monkeys hanging by their tails?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"There, you see, Mrs. Munro! It was a genuine case, and a
genuine cure."</p>

<p>"If he really had it, Mr. Basingstoke, I don't believe it was
thinking about monkeys what cured him; it was them little white
tabloids, and we thank you kindly."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Munro, here are two tickets for the Railam Empire for the
first house to-morrow night. Come, and bring your husband, and then
you will see that there are more people cured by thinking of
monkeys hanging by their tails than there are by swallowing
tabloids. That is my business. I am a monkey hanging by its tail,
and now I must be off. Good-bye, Nibby old boy. Why, if this isn't
a sixpence under the mat. Well, well, this is an age of miracles.
No, you keep it, old boy. Good-bye, Mrs. Munro. Come round and see
me after the show to-morrow. Toot-a-loo, my dear."</p>

<p>Chris was waiting on the doorstep, a fresh-complexioned young
man inclined to corpulence. His face glowed with a kind of vacant
geniality.</p>

<p>"Well, old boy, how goes it?"</p>

<p>"I've got a peach this morning, Willy old boy; I think you'll
like it."</p>

<p>"Good boy, come on in."</p>

<p>The Funny Man's drawing-room was comfortably furnished with
imitation Carolian furniture, a draped ottoman, and an upright
Collard piano. The walls were covered with enlarged photographs of
actors and actresses in gold and walnut frames, the majority of
them were autographed and contained such inscriptions as: "To my
dear old Willy, from yours devotedly, Cora." "To Uncle Nilly, one
of the best, Jimmy Cotswold (The Blue Girl Company, Aug. 1899),"
"To Willy Nilly, 'my heart's afire,' Queenie," and so on.</p>

<p>"Now, let's see what you've got, old boy."</p>

<p>Chris sat at the piano, and unwrapped a manuscript score.</p>

<p>"I think this ought to win out, old boy," he said. "It's by Bert
Shore. It's called 'The Desert Island.' You see the point is this.
You're a bit squiffy, old boy. You see, red nose and battered
top-hat and your trousers turned up to the knees. You know how when
it's been raining on a tarred road it looks like water. Well, we
have a set like that. It's really a street island&mdash;in
Piccadilly, or somewhere. You're on it, and seeing all this shining
water, you think you're on a desert island and the lamppost's a
palm tree. You take off your shoes and stockings and there's some
good business touching the wet road with your bare toes. See, old
boy? There's a thunderin' good tune. Listen to
this&mdash;tum-te-too-te tum-te-tum, rum-te-too-te-tum-te-works up,
you see to a kind of nautical air&mdash;then gets back to the
plaintive desert stuff&mdash;rum-tum-tum-rum-te-tum. Then here's
the chorus. Listen to this, old boy:</p>

<p class="poem">"Lost in the jungle,<br>
Oh, what a bungle,<br>
Eaten by spiders and ants,<br>
Where is my happy home?<br>
Why did they let me roam?<br>
Where are my Sunday pants?</p>

<p>"Good, eh? What do you think? Make something of it, old boy?
Eh?"</p>

<p>The little man's eyes glowed with excitement. Oh, yes, this
might assuredly be a winner. It was the kind of song that had made
his reputation. The tune of the chorus was distinctly catchy, and
his mind was already conceiving various business.</p>

<p>"Let's have a go at it, old boy," he said.</p>

<p>He leant over the other's shoulder and began to sing. He threw
back his head and thrust out his fat little stomach, his eyes
rolled, and perspiration streamed down his face. He was really
enjoying himself. He had just got to</p>

<p class="poem">Lost in a jungle,<br>
Oh, what a bungle,<br>
Eaten by spiders and ants.</p>

<p>when there was a knock on the door, and Mrs. Lamb thrust her
head in and said: "A telegram for you, Mr. Basingstoke."</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh! Well&mdash;er, never mind. Yes, thank you my dear, give
it to me."</p>

<p>He opened the telegram absently, his mind still occupied with
the song. When he had read it, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Good God! Poor old Joe! Yes, no, there's no answer, my dear. I
must go out."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lamb retired.</p>

<p>"Poor old Joe! Stranded, eh?"</p>

<p>"What is it, old boy?" said Chris.</p>

<p>"Telegram from Joe Bloom. He says: 'Can you wire me tenner, very
urgent, stranded at Dundee?' Poor old Joe! He has no luck. He was
out with 'The Queen of the Sea' company. They must have failed.
Excuse me Chris, old boy."</p>

<p>The Funny Man hurried out of the room and ran downstairs. He
snatched up his hat and went out. When he got round the corner, he
ran. He ran as fast as he could to the High Street till he came to
the London, City and Midland Bank. He filled up a cheque for
fifteen pounds and cashed it. Then he ran out of the bank and
trotted puffily across the road to the post office.</p>

<p>"I want to telegraph fifteen pounds, old girl," he said to the
fair-haired lady behind the wires. Filling up the forms took an
unconscionable time, and there all the while was poor old Joe
stranded in Dundee, perhaps without food! Dundee! Dundee of all
places, a bleak unsympathetic town, hundreds of miles from
civilisation. Well, that would help him out anyway. True, he had
had to do this twice before for Joe, and Joe had not, so far, paid
him back, but Joe was a notoriously unlucky devil, and he, Willy
Nilly, topping the bill at the Railham Empire, couldn't let a pal
in.</p>

<p>When he got back to his own drawing-room, Chris was stretched at
full length on the sofa, smoking a cigarette and drinking whiskey
and soda.</p>

<p>"Sorry to have kept you, Chris, old boy."</p>

<p>"It's all right. I've just helped myself to a tot from the
sideboard."</p>

<p>"That's right. That's right. Now let's see, it's a quarter to
eleven. I'll have to wash out this trial, old boy. I shall be late
for Albus. I like that song. I'd like to have another go at it.
Have another tot, Chris, old boy. I'll join you, then I must be
off."</p>

<p>But he didn't get to Albus that morning, because on leaving the
house he remembered that he hadn't called on old Mrs. Labbory. He
<i>must</i> just pop in for a few moments. It was only ten minutes'
walk away. He purchased a fowl and a bottle of Madeira and hurried
to 27, Radnor Street. He found his old landlady propped up on the
pillows, looking gaunt and distant, as though she were already
regarding the manifestations of social life from a long way off and
would never participate in them again.</p>

<p>"Well, Martha, old girl, how goes it? Merry and bright, eh? Oh,
you're looking fine. More colour than last week, eh?...eating
better, old girl?"</p>

<p>A voice came across the years.</p>

<p>"I'm not so well, Jim. God bless you for coming."</p>

<p>"Of course I come. I come because I'm a selfish old rascal. I
come because I want to, I know where I'm appreciated, eh? Ha, ha,
ha, now don't you think you're getting worse. You're getting on
fine. We'll soon have you about again, turning out cupboards,
hanging wallpapers. Jemimy! Do you remember hanging that
convolvulus wallpaper in my bedroom in the Gosport Road, eh?" The
Funny Man slapped his leg, and the tears rolled down his cheeks
with laughter at the recollection of the episode.</p>

<p>"Do you remember how I helped you? And all I did was to step
into a pail of size, nearly broke my leg, and spoilt the only pair
of trousers I had! Ha, ha, ha! He, he, he! I had to go to bed for
four hours while you washed them out and aired 'em. O dear!"</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Labbory began to laugh, too, in a feeble, distant
manner. Then she stopped and looked at him wistfully.</p>

<p>"You going to Katie Easebrook's wedding, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh, yes, I'm going, old girl. I'm going straight on
now."</p>

<p>He hadn't meant to mention this. There's something a little
crude in talking about a wedding to a dying woman. He paused and
looked uncomfortably at his feet. The voice from the past reached
him again.</p>

<p>"You ought to have married Katie Easebrook."</p>

<p>"Eh? What's that? Me? Oh, no, old girl, what are you talking
about? Me marry Katie Easebrook? Why, I wouldn't have had the face
to ask her. Not when there's a good fellow like Charlie about."</p>

<p>Like some discerning oracle came the reply:</p>

<p>"Charlie's a good feller, a good-looking feller, too&mdash;but
you would have made her a better husband, Jim."</p>

<p>With some curious twist of chivalry and affection the little man
gripped the old woman's hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>"You've always thought too much of me, Martha, old girl."</p>

<p>"I've had good cause to, Jim...Good-bye."</p>

<p>He walked a little unsteadily down Radnor Street. A pale October
sun filtered through a light mist, and gave to the meagre front
gardens a certain glamour. Fat spiders hung in glistening webs
between the shrubs and Japanese anemones. Children were playing
absorbing games with chalk and stones upon the pavement. Cats
looked down sleepily from the security of narrow walls. He had to
pat a little girl's head and arbitrate in a dispute between two
girls and a boy regarding the laws of a game called "Snowball."</p>

<p>"Life is a lovely thing," he thought as he hurried on. "Poor old
Martha!...She's going out."</p>

<p>He was, of course, late for the service in the church. In some
way he did not regret this. He slipped quietly into a seat at the
back, unobserved. A hymn was being sung, or was it a Psalm? He
didn't know. There was something about a church service he didn't
like. It disturbed him at some uncomfortable level. Charlie was
standing by the altar, looking self-conscious and impatient. Katie
was a ghostly unrecognisable figure, like a fly bound up in a spool
in a spider's web. Thirty or forty people were scattered on either
side of the central aisle. He could only see their backs. The
parson began to drone the service, slowly enunciating the
prescribed purposes of the married state. Willy Nilly felt a flush
of discomfort. It somehow didn't seem right that Katie should have
to stand there before all these people and have things put to her
quite so straight.</p>

<p>"Rather detailed, old boy," he thought. "Perhaps that's why a
bride wears a veil."</p>

<p>When it was over, he walked boldly up the aisle and followed a
few intimates into the vestry. He was conscious of people
indicating him with nudges and whispering: "Look! That's Willy
Nilly!"</p>

<p>In the vestry, Katie's mother was weeping, and Katie appeared to
be weeping with one eye and laughing with the other. A few
relatives were shaking hands, kissing and talking excitedly.
Someone said: "Here's Willy Nilly."</p>

<p>Charlie gripped his hand and whispered:</p>

<p>"Come on Willie, old boy, kiss the bride."</p>

<p>The bride looked up at him with her glorious eyes, and held out
her arms.</p>

<p>"Dear old Willie...so glad you came, old boy."</p>

<p>He kissed the bride all right, and held her from him.</p>

<p>"God bless you, dear old girl. God bless you. May you...may all
your dreams come true, old girl."</p>

<p>In most weddings there is a streak of pathos, but in theatrical
weddings the note is predominant. It is as though the lookers on
realise that these people whose life is passed in make-believe are
bound to burn their fingers when they begin to touch reality.
Perhaps their reactions are too violent to be bound within the four
walls of a contract.</p>

<p>Katie's wedding certainly contained a large element of
sadness.</p>

<p>"She looks so sweet and fragile. I hope he'll be good to her,"
women whispered.</p>

<p>The lunch at the Hautboy Hotel was hilarious to an almost
artificial degree. A great deal of champagne was drunk, and toasts
were prolific. It was here that Willy Nilly came in. The Funny Man
excelled himself. He was among the people who knew him and loved
him. He made goo-goo eyes at the bridesmaids, he told stories, he
imitated all the denisons of a farmyard, he gave a mock conjuring
display, and his speech in proposing the health of the bride's
father and mother was the hit of the afternoon. (He was not allowed
the principal toast as that had been allocated to Charlie's father,
who was a stockbroker). To the waiter who hovered behind chairs
with napkined magnums of champagne, he kept on saying:</p>

<p>"Not too much, old boy. I've a rehearsal at three-forty."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he drained his glass every time it was filled. The
craving to be funny exceeded every other craving. Willy Nilly had
knocked about the world in every kind of company. It took a lot to
go to his head. It was almost impossible to make him drunk. When at
three o'clock it was time for the bride and bridegroom to depart he
was not by any means drunk, certainly not so drunk as Charlie, but
he was in a slightly detached, comatose state of mind. He kissed
the bride once more, and to Charlie he said:</p>

<p>"God bless you, old boy. Be good to her. You've got the dearest
woman in the world."</p>

<p>And Charlie replied:</p>

<p>"I know, old boy. You've been a brick to us. You oughtn't to
have sent the cheque as well as all that silver. Good luck, old
boy."</p>

<p>"O my in-laws, my in-laws, why don't you leave me be." It seemed
but a flash from one experience to another, from pressing the
girl's dainty shoulders in a parting embrace to stamping about on
the draughty stage and calling into the void:</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Prescott, I want a little more slowing down of this
passage. Do you see what I mean, old boy? It gives me more time for
the business."</p>

<p>The gag with the trombone player was considerably improved. Must
keep going, doing things&mdash;a contract to sign at five-fifteen.
He was feeling tired when the rehearsal was over&mdash;mustn't get
tired before the two shows to-night. Perhaps he could get half an
hour's nap after seeing the agent before it was time to feed.
Someone gave him a cup of tea in the theatre, and a dresser told
him a long story about a disease which his wife's father got
through sitting on a churchyard wall, waiting for the village pub
to open at six.</p>

<p>There appeared no interval of time between this and sitting in
front of the suave furtive-looking gentleman named Welsh who
"handled" him on behalf of the United Varieties Agency. He was
conscious of not being at his best with Welsh. He believed that he
could have got much better terms in his new contract, but somehow
the matter did not appear to him to be of great importance. He
changed the subject and told Welsh the story about the sea captain
and the Irish stewardess. Welsh laughed immoderately. After all,
quite a good fellow&mdash;Welsh. He was anxious to get away and see
some boys at the club. Jimmy would certainly have a new story
ready. He hadn't seen Jimmy for four days.</p>

<p>Jimmy was certainly there, and not only Jimmy, but old Barrow,
and Sam Lenning, and a host of others. He had a double Scotch
whisky and proceeded to take a hand in the game of swopping
improper stories. At one time something seemed to jog at his
consciousness and say: "Do you really think much of this kind of
thing, old boy?" And another voice replied: "What does it
matter?...They've just arrived at Brighton railway station. In
another ten minutes they'll be at 'The Ship.'"</p>

<p>"I thought you were going to have a chop at six-thirty, Willy,"
someone remarked to him suddenly.</p>

<p>"So I am, old boy."</p>

<p>"It's seven-fifteen now."</p>

<p>Good gracious! So it was! Well, he didn't particularly want a
chop. He would have a couple of sandwiches and another double
Scotch. He was quite himself again in his dressing-room at the
theatre. He loved the smell of grease paint and spirit gum, the
contact of fantastic whiskers and clothes, the rather shabby mirror
under a strong light. His first song was going to be "Old Fags,"
the feckless ruffian who picks up cigarette ends. The dresser,
whose name was Flood and who always called him Mr. Nilly, was ready
with his three changes.</p>

<p>"Number five's on," came the message down the corridors. Good!
There was only "Charlemayne," the equilibrist, between him and "his
people."</p>

<p>Willy Nilly had got to love "his people" as he mentally
designated them. He knew them, and they knew him&mdash;the reward
of many years' hard work. He loved stumbling down the corridors,
through the iron doors, and groping his way amidst the dim medley
of the wings, where gorgeous unreal women, and men in bowler hats
patted him as he passed and whispered:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Willy, old boy? Good luck!"</p>

<p>He loved to wait there and hear his number go up; the roar of
welcome which greeted it was the music to his soul.</p>

<p>"Number seven!"</p>

<p>The orchestra played the opening bars and then with a queer
shuffle he was before them, a preposterous figure with a bright red
nose, a miniature bowler hat, and a fearful old suit with ferns
growing out of the seams, and a heavy sack slung across his
back.</p>

<p class="poem">"Old Fags! Old Gags!<br>
See my collection of fine old fags.<br>
If you want to be happy,<br>
If you want to be gay,<br>
Empty your sack<br>
At the fag-end of the day."</p>

<p>Oh, yes, you ought to see Willy Nilly in "Old Fags." The
habitu&eacute;s at the Railham Empire will tell you all about him.
The doleful wheezy voice, the quaint antics, and then the
screamingly funny business when he empties the sack of cigarette
ends all over the stage and, of course, at the bottom is a bottle
of gin and a complete set of ladies' undies (apparently new and
trimmed in pink). Then the business of finding innumerable
cigarette ends in his unmanageable beard.</p>

<p>On that night, Willy Nilly was at his best. A lightning change
and he came on as "The Carpet Salesman" in which he brought on a
roll of carpet, the opportunities concerning which are obvious.
Then followed "The lady who works for the lady next door." The
inevitable encore&mdash;prepared for and expected&mdash;followed. A
terrible Russian&mdash;more whiskers, red this
time&mdash;singing:</p>

<p class="poem">"O Mary-vitch,<br>
O Ada-vitch<br>
I don't know which<br>
Ich lieber ditch;<br>
I told your pa<br>
I'd got the itch;<br>
He promptly hit me<br>
On the snitch."</p>

<p>It was difficult for Willy Nilly to escape after this valiant
satirical digression.</p>

<p>He fled perspiring to his dressing-room.</p>

<p>"Give me a drink, old boy," he gasped to the lugubrious
Flood.</p>

<p>He had smothered his face in cocoa-butter, when there was a
knock on the door.</p>

<p>"Mr. Peter Wilberforce, representing the <i>Railham
Mercury</i>."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, come in, old boy."</p>

<p>Mr. Wilberforce was in no hurry to depart. He had a
spot&mdash;"just a couple of fingers, old boy" of whisky. He wanted
a column of bright stuff for the next issue of the weekly. "Is
Railham behind the other suburbs in humour? Interview with the
famous Willy Nilly&mdash;our local product."</p>

<p>"You just give me a lead," said Mr. Wilberforce, "I'll fill in
the padding."</p>

<p>Willy Nilly found turning out the bright stuff immediately after
his performance the most exhausting experience of the day. He was
quite relieved when, at the end of forty minutes, there was a knock
at the door, and a woman with a lanky son was shown in. This was
the young man who wanted to go on the stage. The pressman departed
and the mother started forth on a long harangue about what people
said about her son's remarkable genius for acting. Before Willy
Nilly knew where he was, he was listening to the boy giving
imitations of Beerbohm Tree and Henry Ainley. It was quite easy to
tell which was meant to be which, and so Willy grasped the young
man's hand and said:</p>

<p>"Very good, old boy! Very good."</p>

<p>He promised to do what he could, but by the time the mother had
gone all over the same ground three times he found it was too late
to pop round to the club again. It was nearly time to make up for
the second show. He dozed in the chair for a few moments. Suddenly
he thought:</p>

<p>"They've had dinner. They're probably taking a stroll on the
front before turning in."</p>

<p>He poured himself out another tot of whisky and picked up his
red nose.</p>

<p>"O God! How tired I feel!...Not quite the man you were, old
boy."</p>

<p>He found it a terrible effort to go on that second time. "Old
Fags" seemed flat. He began to be subtly aware that the audience
knew that he knew that the song wasn't really funny at all. At the
end the applause was mild. "The Carpet Salesman" went even
worse.</p>

<p>"Pull yourself together, old boy," he muttered as he staggered
off. It wouldn't do. A man who tops the bill can't afford not to
bring the house down with every song. He made a superhuman effort
with "The lady who works for the lady next door." It certainly went
better than the others, just well enough to take an encore rather
quickly. On this occasion he altered his encore. Instead of
"Mary-vitch," he sang a hilarious song with the refrain:</p>

<p class="poem">"O my! Hold me down!<br>
My wife's gone away till Monday!"</p>

<p>At the end of the first verse he felt that he had got them.
Success excited him. He went for it for all he was worth. Willy
Nilly was himself again. The house roared at him. He had the
greatest difficulty in escaping without giving a further encore. As
he stumbled up the stone staircase to his dressing-room, he
suddenly thought:</p>

<p>"They've gone to bed now."</p>

<p>The imperturbable Flood followed him, laden with properties.</p>

<p>"I'll just have one more spot, Flood, old boy."</p>

<p>How tired he was! He cleaned up languidly and got into his
normal clothes.</p>

<p>"Well, that's that, old boy," he said to Flood. "Now I think
we'll toddle off to our bye-byes."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Mr. Nilly, wasn't you going round to Mr. Bird
Crafts?"</p>

<p>Eh? Oh, yes, for sure; he'd forgotten about poor old Bird.
Couldn't exactly let an old pal in. Well, he would have a cab and
hang the expense&mdash;just stay a few minutes&mdash;dear old Bird
would understand. But he stayed an hour at Bird Crafts. He listened
to three new comic songs and a lot of patter.</p>

<p>"Yes, you've got a winner there, old boy," he remarked at the
end of each song.</p>

<p>It was nearly one o'clock when he groped his way up the dim
staircase of his own house. The bedroom looked bleak and
uninteresting. It had never struck him before in quite that way. He
had always liked his bedroom with its heavy mahogany furniture and
red plush curtains, but somehow to-night the place seemed
forlorn...as though something was terribly lacking.</p>

<p>"You're tired, old boy."</p>

<p>He undressed and threw his clothes carelessly on chairs and
tables. He got into bed and regarded the room, trying with his
tired brain, to think what was wrong. His clothes ought not to have
been thrown about like that, of course. He felt that they and he
were out of place in the large room. A strange feeling of
melancholy crept over him.</p>

<p>"It's badly ordered...it's all badly ordered, old boy."</p>

<p>He had a great desire to cry, so weak he felt. But no, a man
mustn't do that; a funny man certainly mustn't. His mind wandered
back to his old mother. He remembered the days when she had taught
him to pray. He would give anything for the relief of prayer. But
he couldn't do that either. It didn't seem exactly playing the
game. He had put all that kind of thing by so long ago. He despised
those people who lead unvirtuous lives and then in the end turned
religious. He wasn't going to pretend. He turned out the light, and
closed his eyes. He would neither weep nor pray, but he must
express himself somehow. Perhaps he compromised between these two
human frailties. Certainly his voice was very near a sob, and his
accents vividly alive with prayer as he cried to the darkness:</p>

<p>"Charlie, old boy, be good to her...For God's sake be good to
her."</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>14. THE MATCH</h2>

<p>It is all so incredibly long ago that you must not ask me to
remember the scores. In fact, even of the result I am a little
dubious. I only know that it was just on such a day as this that we
were all mooning round Bunty Cartwright's garden after breakfast,
smoking, and watching the great bumble-bees hanging heavily on the
flowers. Along the flagged pathway to the house were standard
rose-trees, the blossoms and perfume of which excited one
pleasantly. It was jolly to be in flannels and to feel the sun on
one's skin, for the day promised to be hot.</p>

<p>For years it had been a tradition for dear old Bunty to ask us
all down for the week. There were usually eight or nine of us, and
we made up our team with the doctor and his son and one or two
other odds and ends of chaps in the neighbourhood. I know that on
this day he had secured the services of Dawkin, a very fast bowler
from a town near by, for Celminster, the team we were to play, were
reputed to be a very hot lot.</p>

<p>As we stood there laughing and talking, Bunty and Tony Peebles
were sitting within the stone porch, I remember, trying to finish a
game of chess started the previous evening; there was the crunch of
wheels on the road, and the brake arrived, accompanied by the
doctor's son, a thin slip of a boy on a bicycle.</p>

<p>Then there was the usual bustle of putting up cricket-bags and
going back for things one had forgotten, and the inevitable
"chipping" of "Togs," a boy whose real name I have forgotten, but
who was always last in everything, even in the order of going in.
It must have been fully half an hour before we made a start, and
then the doctor hadn't arrived. However, he came up at the last
minute, his jolly red face beaming and perspiring. Some of the
chaps cycled, and soon left us behind, but I think we were seven on
the brake. It was good to be high up and to feel the wind blowing
gently on our faces from the sea. We passed villages of amazing
beauty nestling in the hollows of the downs, and rumbled on our way
to the accompaniment of lowing sheep and the doctor's rich, burring
voice talking of cricket, and the song of the lark overhead that
sang in praise of this day of festival.</p>

<p>It was good to laugh and talk and watch the white road
stretching far ahead, then dipping behind a stretch of woodland. It
was good to feel the thrill of excited anticipation as we
approached the outskirts of Celminster. What sort of ground would
it be? What were their bowlers like? Who would come off for us?</p>

<p>It was good to see the grinning, friendly faces of the villagers
and then to descend from the brake, to nod to our opponents in that
curiously self-conscious way we have as a race, and then eagerly to
survey the field. And is there in the whole of England a more
beautiful place than the Celminster cricket ground?</p>

<p>On one side is a clump of buildings dominated by the straggling
yards and outhouses belonging to the "Bull" inn. On the farther
side is a fence, and just beyond a stream bordered by young
willows. At right angles to the inn is a thick cluster of
elms&mdash;a small wood, in fact&mdash;while on the fourth side a
low, grey stone wall separates the field from the road. Across the
road may be seen the spire of a church, the fabric hidden by the
trees, and away beyond sweeping contours of the downs.</p>

<p>In the corner of the field is a rough pavilion faced with
half-timber, and a white flagstaff with the colours of the
Celminster Cricket Club fluttering at its summit.</p>

<p>Members of the Celminster Club were practising in little knots
about the field, and a crowd of small boys were sitting on a long
wooden bench, shouting indescribably, and some were playing mock
games with sticks and rubber balls. A few aged inhabitants looked
at us with lazy interest and touched their hats.</p>

<p>A little man with a square chin and an auburn moustache came out
and grinned at us and asked for Mr. Cartwright. We discovered that
he was the local wheelwright and the Celminster captain. He showed
us our room in the pavilion and called Bunty "sir." Of course,
Bunty lost the toss. He always did during that week, and this led
to considerably more "chipping," and we turned out to field.</p>

<p>No one who has never experienced it can ever appreciate the
tense joy of a cricketer when he comes out to begin a match. The
gaiety of the morning, when the light is at its best and all one's
senses are alert; the sense of being among splendid deeds that are
yet unborn; and then the jolly red ball! How we love to clutch it
with a sort of romantic exultation and toss it to one another! For
it is upon it that the story of the day will turn. It is the
scarlet symbol of our well-ordered adventure, as yet untouched and
virginal, and yet strangely pregnant of unaccomplished actions.
What story will it have to tell when the day is done? Who will drop
catches with it? Who destroy its virgin loveliness with a fearful
drive against the stone wall?</p>

<p>As I have stated, it happened all so long ago that I cannot
clearly remember many of the details of that match, but curiously
enough I remember the first over that Dawkin sent down very
vividly.</p>

<p>A very tall man came in to bat. The first ball he played
straight back to the bowler; the second was a "yorker" and just
missed his wicket; the third he drove hard to mid-off and Bunty
stopped it; the fourth he stopped with his pads; the fifth he
played back to the bowler again; and the sixth knocked his leg
clean out of the ground.</p>

<p>One wicket for no runs! We flung the scarlet symbol backward and
forward in a great state of excitement, with visions of a freak
match, the whole side of our opponents being out for ten runs, and
so on. I remember the glum face of their umpire, a genial
corn-merchant, dressed in a white coat and a bowler hat, with a
bewildering number of sweaters tied round his neck, glancing
apprehensively at the pavilion. I remember that the next man in was
the little wheelwright, and he looked very solemn and tense. The
first three balls missed his wicket by inches, then he stopped
them. My recollection of the rest of that morning was a vision of
the little wheelwright, with his chin thrust forward, frowning at
the bowlers. He had a peculiarly uncomfortable stance at the
wicket, but he played very straight. He kept Dawkin out for about
five overs, then he started pulling him round to leg. The wicket
was rather fiery, and Dawkin was very fast. The wheelwright was hit
three times on the thigh, twice on the chest, and numberless times
on the arms, and one ball got up and glanced off his scalp, but he
did not waver. He plodded on, lying in wait for the short ball to
hook to leg. I do not remember how many he made, but it was a great
innings. He took the heart out of Dawkin and encouraged one or two
of the others to hit with courage. He was caught at last by a
brilliant catch by Arthur Booth running in from long leg.</p>

<p>One advantage of a village team like Celminster is that they
have no "tail," or, rather, that you never know what the tail will
do. You know by the costume that they have a tail, for the first
four or five batsmen appear in complete outfits of white flannels
and sweaters, and then the costumes start varying in a wonderful
degree. Number six appears in a black waistcoat with white flannel
trousers, number seven with brown pads and black boots, number
eight with a blue shirt and brown trousers, and so on to the last
man, who is dressed uncommonly like a verger. But this rallentando
of sartorial equipment does not in any way represent the
run-getting ability of the team, for suddenly some gentleman
inappropriately garbed, who gives the impression of never having
had a bat in his hand before, will lash out and score twenty-five
runs off one over.</p>

<p>On this particular occasion I remember one man who came in about
ninth, and who wore one brown pad and sand-shoes, and had on a blue
shirt with a dicky and a collar, but no tie, and who stood straight
in front of his wicket, looked grimly at Dawkin, and then hit him
for two sixes, a four, and a five, to the roaring accompaniment of
"Good old Jar-r-ge!" from a row of small boys near the pavilion.
The fifth ball hit his pad and he was given out l.b.w. He gave no
expression of surprise, disappointment or disgust, but just walked
grimly back to the pavilion. Celminster were all out before lunch,
but I cannot let the last man&mdash;the verger&mdash;retire (he was
bowled first ball off his foot) before speaking of our
wicket-keeper, Jimmy Guilsworth.</p>

<p>Jimmy Guilsworth was, in my opinion, an ideal wicket-keeper. He
was a little chap and wore glasses, but his figure was solid and
homely. He was by profession something of a poet, and wrote lyrics
in the celtic-twilight manner. He played cricket rarely, but when
he did, he was instinctively made wicket-keeper. He had that
curious, sympathetic mothering quality which every good
wicket-keeper should have. The first business of a wicket-keeper is
to make the opposing batsmen feel at home. When the man comes in
trembling and nervous, the wicket-keeper should make some
reassuring remark, something that at once establishes a bond of
understanding between honourable opponents. When the batsman is
struck on the elbow it is the wicket-keeper who should rush up and
administer first-aid or spiritual comfort. And when the batsman is
bowled or caught, he should say: "Hard luck, sir!"</p>

<p>At the same time it is his business to mother the bowlers on his
own side. He must be continually encouraging them and sympathizing
with them, but in a subdued voice, so that the batsman does not
hear. And, moreover, he must be prepared to act as chief of staff
to the captain. He must advise him on the change of bowlers and on
the disposition of the field. All of this requires great tact,
understanding and perspicacity.</p>

<p>All these qualities Jimmy Guilsworth had in a marked degree. If
he sometimes dropped catches and never stood near enough to stump
anyone, what was that to the sympathetic way he said, "Oh, hard
luck, sir!" to an opposing batsman when he was bowled by a long
hop, or the convincing way he would call out, "Oh, well hit, sir!"
when another opponent pulled a half-volley for four. What could
have been more encouraging than the way he would rest his hand on
young Booth's shoulder after he had bowled a disappointing over,
and say: "I say, old chap, you're in great form. Could you pitch
'em up just a wee bit?" When things were going badly for the side,
Jimmy would grin and whisper into Cartwright's ear. Then there
would be a consultation and a change of bowlers, or some one would
come closer up to third-man, and, lo! in no time something would
happen.</p>

<p>But it is lunch-time. In the pavilion a long table is set, with
a clean cloth and napkins and with gay bowls of salad. On a
side-table is a wonderful array of cold joints, hams, cold lamb,
and pies. We sit down, talking of the game. Curiously enough, we do
not mix with our opponents. We sit at one end, and they occupy the
other, but we grin at one another, and the men sitting at the point
of contact of the two parties occasionally proffer a remark.</p>

<p>Girls wait on us, and a fat man in shirt-sleeves, who produces
ale and ginger-beer from some mysterious corner. And what a lunch
it is! Does ever veal-and-ham pie taste so good as it does in the
pavilion after the morning chasing a ball? And then tarts and fruit
and custard and a large yellow cheese, how splendid it all seems,
with the buzz of conversation and the bright sun through the open
door! Does anything lend a fuller flavour to the inevitable pipe
than such a lunch, mellowed by the rough flavour of a pint of
shandy-gaff?</p>

<p>We stroll out again into the sun and puff tranquilly, and some
of us gather round old Bob Parsons, the corn-merchant, and listen
to his panegyric of cricket as played "in the old days." He's seen
a lot of cricket in his time, old Bob. His bony, weatherbeaten face
wrinkles, and his clear, ingenuous eyes blink at the heavens as he
recalls famous men: "Johnny Strutt, he was a good 'un. Aye, and ye
should ha' seen old Tom Kennett bowl in his time. Nine wicket' he
took against Kailhurst, hittin' the wood every toime. Fast he were,
faster'n they bowl now. Fower bahls he bahl fast, then put up a
slow."</p>

<p>He shakes his head meditatively, as though the contemplation of
the diabolical cunning of bowling a slow ball after four fast ones
was almost too much to believe, as though it was a demonstration of
intellectual calisthenics that this generation could not
appreciate.</p>

<p>It is now the turn of the opponents to take the field, while we
eagerly scan the score-sheet to see the order of going in, and
restlessly move about the pavilion, trying on pads, and making
efforts not to appear nervous.</p>

<p>And with what a tense emotion we watch our first two men open
the innings! It is with a gasp of relief we see Jimmy Guilsworth
cut a fast ball for two, and know, at any rate, we have made a more
fortunate start than our opponents did.</p>

<p>I do not remember how many runs we made that afternoon, though
as we were out about tea-time, I believe we just passed the
Celminster total, but I remember that to our joy Bunty Cartwright
came off. He had been unlucky all the week, but this was his
joy-day. He seemed cheerful and confident when he went in, and he
was let off on the boundary off the first ball! After that he did
not make a mistake.</p>

<p>It was a joy to watch Bunty bat. He was tall and graceful, and
he sprang to meet the ball like a wave scudding against a rock. He
seemed to epitomize the dancing sunlight, a thing of joy expressing
the fullness of the crowded hour. His hair blew over his face, and
one could catch the gleam of satisfaction that radiated from him as
he panted on his bat after running out a five.</p>

<p>He was not a great cricketer, none of us were, but he had a good
eye, the heart of a lion, and he loved the game.</p>

<p>I believe I made eight or nine. I know I made a cut for four.
The recollection of it is very keen to this day, and the satisfying
joy of seeing the ball scudding along the ground a yard out of the
reach of point. It made me very happy. And then one of those balls
came along that one knows nothing about. How remarkable it is that
a bowler who appears so harmless from the pavilion seems terrifying
and demoniacal when he comes tearing down the crease toward
you!</p>

<p>Yes, I'm sure we passed the Celminster total now, for I remember
at tea-time discussing the possibilities of winning by a single
innings if we got Celminster out for forty.</p>

<p>After tea, for some reason or other, one smokes cigarettes. We
strolled into a yard at the back of the "Bull" inn, and there was a
wicket gate leading to a lawn where some wonderful old men, whose
language was almost incomprehensible, were drinking ale and playing
bowls. At the side were some tall sunflowers growing amid piles of
manure.</p>

<p>Some one in the pavilion rang a bell, and we languidly returned
to take the field once more.</p>

<p>I remember that it was late in the afternoon that a strange
thing happened to me. I was fielding out in the long field not
thirty yards from the stream. Tony Peebles was bowling from the end
where I was fielding. I noted his ambling run to the wicket and the
graceful action of his arm as he swung the ball across. A little
incident happened, a thing trivial at the time, but which one
afterward remembers. The batsman hit a ball rather low on the off
side, which the doctor's son caught or stopped on the ground. There
was an appeal for a catch, given in the batsman's favour, but for
some reason or other he thought the umpire had said "out," and he
started walking to the pavilion. He was at least two yards out of
his crease when the doctor's son threw the ball to Jimmy Guilsworth
at the wicket. Jimmy had the wicket at his mercy, but instead of
putting it down he threw it back to the bowler. It was perhaps a
trivial thing, but it epitomized the game we played. One does not
take advantage of a mistake. It isn't done.</p>

<p>The sun was already beginning to flood the valley with the
excess of amber light which usually betokens his parting embrace.
The stretch of level grass became alive and vibrant, tremblingly
golden against the long, crisp shadows cast from the elms. The elms
themselves nodded contentedly, and down by the stream flickered
little white patches of children's frocks. Everything suddenly
seemed to become more vivid and transcendent. As if aware of the
splendour of that moment, all the little things struggled to
express themselves more actively. The birds and little insects in
solemn unison praised God, or, rather, to my mind, at that moment
they praised England, the land that gave them such a glorious
setting. The white-clad figures on the sunlit field, the smoke from
the old buildings by the inn trailing lazily skyward, the
comfortable buzz of the voices of some villagers lying on their
stomachs on the grass. Ah! My dear land!</p>

<p>I don't know how it was, but at that moment I felt a curious
contraction of the heart, like one who looks into the face of a
lover who is going on a journey. Perhaps a townsman gets a little
tired at the end of a day in the field, or the feeling may have
been due to the Cassandra-like dirge of a flock of rooks that swung
across the sky and settled in the elms.</p>

<p>The bat, cut from a willow down by the stream, the stumps, the
leather ball, the symbol of the wicket, the level lawn, cut and
rolled and true&mdash;all these things were redolent of the land we
moved on. They spoke of the love of trees and wind and sun and the
equipoise of man in Nature's setting. They symbolized our race,
slow-moving and serene, with a certain sensuous joy in movement, a
love of straightness, and an indestructible faith in custom. Ah,
that the beauty of that hour should fade, that the splendour and
serenity of it all should pass away! Strange waves of misgiving
flooded me.</p>

<p>If it should be all <i>too</i> slow-moving, <i>too</i> serene!
If at that moment the wheels of the Juggernaut of evolution were
already on their way to crush the splendour of it beneath their
weight!</p>

<p>Ah! my dear land, if you should be in danger! If one day another
match should come in which you would measure yourself
against&mdash;some unknown terrors! I was aware at that moment of a
poignant sense of prayer that when your trial should come it would
find you worthy of the clean sanity of that sunlit field; and if in
the end you should go down, as everything in nature <i>does</i> go
down before the scythe of Time, the rooks up there in the elm
should cry aloud your epitaph. They are very old and wise, these
rooks: they watched the last of the Ptolemes pass from Egypt, they
moaned above Carthage and Troy, and warned the Roman praetors of
the coming of Attila. And the epitaph they shall make for
you&mdash;for <i>they</i> saw the little incident of Jimmy
Guilsworth and the doctor's son&mdash;shall be: "Whatever you may
say of these people, they played the game."</p>

<p>I think those small boys down by the pavilion made too much fuss
about the catch I muffed. Of course, I did get both hands to it,
and as a matter of fact the sun was <i>not</i> in my eyes; but I
think I started a bit late, and it seemed to be screwing horribly.
Ironical jeers are not comforting. Bunty, like the dear good
sportsman he is, merely called out:</p>

<p>"Dreaming there?"</p>

<p>But it was a wretched moment. I remember slinking across at the
over, feeling like an animal that has contracted a disease and is
ashamed to be seen, and my mental condition was by no means
improved by the cheap sarcasms of young Booth or Eric Ganton. We
did not get Celminster out for the second time, and the certainty
that the result would not be affected by the second innings led to
introduction of strange and unlikely bowlers being put on and given
their chance.</p>

<p>I remember that just at the end of the day even young "Togs" was
tired. He sent down three most extraordinary balls that went
nowhere within reach of the batsman, the fourth was a full pitch,
and a young rustic giant who was then batting, promptly hit it
right over the pavilion. The next ball was very short and came on
the leg side. I was fielding at short leg and I saw the batsman
hunching his shoulders for a fearful swipe. I felt in a horrible
funk. I heard the loud crack of the ball on the willow, and I was
aware of it coming straight at my head. I fell back in an
ineffectual sort of manner, and despairingly threw up my hands in a
sort of self-defence. And then an amazing thing happened: the ball
went bang into my left hand and stopped there. I slipped and fell,
but somehow I managed to hang on to the ball. I remember hearing a
loud shout, and suddenly the pain of impact vanished in the
realization that I had brought off a hot catch.</p>

<p>It was a golden moment. The match was over. I remember all our
chaps shouting and laughing, and young "Togs" rushing up and
throwing his arms round me in a mock embrace. We ambled back to the
pavilion and it suddenly struck me how good looking most of our men
were, even Tony Peebles, whom I had always looked upon as the
plainest of the plain. My heart warmed toward Bunty with a
passionate zeal when he struck me on the back and said: "Good man!
You've more than retrieved your muff in the long field."</p>

<p>I know they ragged me frightfully in the pavilion when we were
changing, but it was no effort to take it good-humouredly. I felt
ridiculously proud.</p>

<p>We took a long time getting away, there was so much rubbing down
and talking to be done, and then there was the difficulty of
getting Len Booth out of the "Bull" inn. He had a romantic passion
for drinking ale with yokels, and a boy had stuck a pin into one of
Ganton's tyres, and he had to find a bicycle shop and get it
mended. It was getting dark when we all got established once more
in the brake.</p>

<p>I remember vividly turning the corner in the High Street and
looking back on the solemn profile of the inn. The sky was almost
colourless, just a glow of warmth, and already in some of the
windows lamps were appearing. We huddled together contentedly in
the brake, and I saw the firm lines of Bunty's face as he leaned
over a match lighting his pipe.</p>

<p>The grass is long to-day in the field where we played
Celminster, and down by the stream are two square, unattractive
buildings, covered with zinc roofing, where is heard the dull roar
of machinery. The ravages of time cannot eradicate from my memory
the vision of Bunty's face leaning over his pipe, or the pleasant
buzz of the village voices as we clattered among them in the High
Street, or the sight of the old corn-merchant's face as he came up
and spoke to Bunty (Bunty had stopped the brake to get more
tobacco) and touched his hat and said:</p>

<p>"Good noight, sir. Good luck to 'ee!"</p>

<p>Decades have passed, and I have to press the spring of my memory
to bring these things back; but when they come they are very dear
to me.</p>

<p>I know that in the wind that blows above Gallipoli you will find
the whispers of the great faith that Bunty died for. Eric Ganton,
young Booth, and Jimmy Guilsworth, where are they? In vain the soil
of Flanders strives to clog the free spirit of my friends.</p>

<p>"Good noight, sir. Good luck to 'ee!"</p>

<p>Again I see the old man's face as I gaze across the field where
the long grass grows, and I see the red ball tossed hither and
thither, with its story still unfinished, and I hear the sound of
Jimmy's voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, well hit, sir!" as he encourages an opponent.</p>

<p>The times have changed since then, but you cannot destroy these
things. Manners have changed, customs have changed, even the faces
of men have changed; and yet this calendar on my knee is trying to
tell me that it all happened <i>two years ago to-day</i>!</p>

<p>And overhead the garrulous rooks seem strangely flustered.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>15. THE OLD LADY WITH THE TWO
UMBRELLAS</h2>

<p>Paris can be an exceedingly dull city. One has only to miss a
keenly anticipated appointment with a friend, to catch a cold in
the head, to be disappointed in some love affair, to realise that
the cold grey waters of the Seine are the only really inviting
thing about it. One is down in the depths. Certainly these moods
are apt to be transitory. One burst of sunshine, and lo! the cold
in the head is forgotten, the friend has been waiting all the time,
the girl may turn up. I forget which of these misfortunes had
assailed me, but I know that I was in a very bad humour, sitting
alone outside a little caf&eacute; in Etoile. Imagine my delight,
then, when who should amble along the boulevard, and proceed to
seek a table near me, but my old friend Tolozan. I had not seen him
since his retirement from the police intelligence department at
Bordeaux, upon a modest but well-merited pension. He held out his
hand to me and smiled in that courtly and engaging manner which was
characteristic of him. One of the secrets of his successful career
had been that manner of inspiring immediate confidence. One went on
from the point where one last left off, however long an interval
may have intervened. He forgot nothing. All one's own opinions and
affections appeared to be stored away carefully in his memory. The
humdrum details of my particular trouble on this occasion evoked
from him a profound concern. (Looking back on it I think it must
have been a girl; no cold in the head would have called forth such
charming sympathy).</p>

<p>My affairs dismissed, he told me that he was living at Colombes
with his wife and daughter. He had a small villa and an acre of
garden, which occupied most of his time. He spoke lovingly of his
roses and gentians, his runner beans and leeks, and vegetable
marrows. He hoped I would pay him a visit. He had come to Paris to
buy seeds.</p>

<p>I was vaguely amused at my friend's enthusiasm. I could not help
being impressed by the contrast of these placid interests compared
with the turbulent incidents of his career spent amongst criminals
and courtesans. At the same time, I could not help rejoicing that
the perils and dangers of his life were passed, and that he had now
reached this calm haven, where he could enjoy a full measure of
repose, and indulge in those pleasant philosophical recreations and
theories, which always attracted him so.</p>

<p>Moreover, I had been anxious to meet him ever since his
retirement. I felt convinced that stored away in the archives of
his memory must be many interesting facts and stories which the
etiquette of the service would have prevented him from divulging
while in harness. Over our coffee I boldly insinuated that this
might be the case. He smiled deprecatingly and shrugged his
shoulders. He was not one of those old chaps who like to hold youth
spellbound by a recapitulation of their remarkable deeds and
exploits. He was no Tartarin of Tarascon. It was indeed difficult
to get him to talk about himself in a subjective sense at all. If a
discussion arose, he would point some little theory with a leaf or
two taken from the record of his own experiences, but as for
telling a tale in the accepted sense, well, he simply couldn't see
the sense of it. I dug out of him the story of the Old Lady with
the Two Umbrellas. Being a writer, and therefore a person with an
elastic conscience, I have no hesitation in repeating it. But I'm
glad I am to do it in a foreign language and in a foreign country,
for I feel that Tolozan would not approve. He told me once that the
only fiction he had ever read was "Monte Cristo," and he thought it
a poor book, pointless and improbable. He used to study Comte,
Montaigne, and seed catalogues.</p>

<p>I should never have got these facts out of him at all, I
believe, if it had not happened to commence raining whilst we were
sitting outside the caf&eacute;. We were under an awning and the
procession of people passing by, holding up umbrellas, reminded him
of the salient fact, for he turned to me and said abruptly:</p>

<p>"What would you think of anyone who always carried two
umbrellas?"</p>

<p>The question was so surprising that I had nothing to reply. Two
umbrellas? He continued meditatively:</p>

<p>"I knew a woman who did this."</p>

<p>I begged him to enlighten me upon the details of this unusual
fact, and by many questionings and promptings I got the story out
of him.</p>

<p>It happened after he had left the service. It appears that for a
year after his retirement he and his wife and daughter continued to
live in Bordeaux. They only came to Paris ultimately because it was
decided that the daughter should attend the conservatoire of music.
On retiring, his portfolio and the cases he had in hand were given
over to a younger man, named Freycinet. He was a young man for the
position, and a prot&eacute;g&eacute; and friend of Tolozan's. He
frequently visited the family at their flat in the Rue Judaique.
One evening towards the end of the summer&mdash;it was the summer
following the Armistice&mdash;Freycinet came to him in a great
state of consternation. He was obviously bewildered and distressed.
Tolozan took him into his little den and begged him to confide his
trouble.</p>

<p>"I'm likely to lose my position," he kept repeating.</p>

<p>"Well, old man, tell me all about it. Perhaps I can be of
service," said Tolozan.</p>

<p>"It's like this," spluttered Freycinet. "Two months ago we
received information from the prefecture that gold was leaking out
of the country over the Spanish border. I was sent down to Irun to
take charge of the matter. I did the usual thing, examined all
luggage, searched promiscuous people, arrested a few suspicious
characters, doubled the sentries at vital points on the border, but
nothing came of it. We could find no trace of the leaking gold. For
three weeks I was up night and day doing everything I could think.
Then a stern note came from headquarters. The gold was still going
through. Something more must be done. These Treasury people have
wonderfully sensitive ways of finding out. They believed it went
through to Bilbao; a steady stream of golden louis. I became more
drastic. For three days running I had every passenger on every
train thoroughly searched, all the luggage thoroughly sifted. I
even probed amongst the coal on the engines. I searched the guards
and porters and engine-drivers. The Government sent naval packets
to patrol the Bidassoa, a destroyer to watch off Hendaye, and two
others to cover the coast between there and Bordeaux. Not a boat
put out to sea without being searched. We never found a coin. A
fortnight later the prefect of the police sent for me. He was
furious. He said that he regretted to say that he held me
responsible. The Government were of opinion that the gold was going
through by land, and they were demanding a scapegoat. You see the
position I'm in, old man. That was only a week ago, and I've found
nothing."</p>

<p>Tolozan looked very grave. He pulled at his thin grey imperial
and muttered:</p>

<p>"Smuggling gold out of the country is a penal offence. A man or
woman who does that is a traitor to France."</p>

<p>He was very indignant. Tolozan had a criminal code of his own.
There were some crimes of which he was surprisingly tolerant. In
his opinion the worst crimes were the unpatriotic ones. He would
show no mercy to a traitor. Over this affair of Freycinet he wished
to make his position clear. He had retired, and he had no intention
of deliberately interfering. If he helped his old colleague with
his advice, he must understand that he only did so out of his
affection for him and for the safety of France. His name was not to
be made use of, neither would he take any active part. He would
merely observe, and if any illumination came to him he would pass
it on to Freycinet to act upon. He would accompany him to the
frontier, paying his own expenses.</p>

<p>Freycinet was naturally delighted at his friend's offer, and
thanked him profusely. On their way to the station he told him of
one unusual incident in the case.</p>

<p>"Naturally," he said, "I have been on the lookout for suspicious
characters, and also for people who pass backwards and forwards
frequently. Several of the latter I have examined and
cross-examined, and gone to the trouble of certifying their
statements. For the most part, they are quite innocuous, little
traders, commercials, and genuine business people, but there is one
old woman who mystifies me. She goes into Spain about twice a week
and returns the next day. She always carries two umbrellas and no
other luggage at all. The second time she went through I had her
up. The woman officials searched her. I searched the umbrellas.
There was nothing, nothing at all. She is patently an old crank of
some sort. When I asked her why she carried two umbrellas she
replied that one was for fair weather and the other for foul. The
next time she gave some other reason, quite trivial and absurd. She
is quite a character. She attracts a lot of attention in the
Customs, talks loudly to everyone, cheeks the officers. They all
know her, and are rather amused. They say 'Hullo, here comes Madame
Fair and Foul!'"</p>

<p>"Have you followed up her case more closely?" asked Tolozan.</p>

<p>"No. As we know that she neither takes gold out of the country
nor brings anything in, it hardly seems worth while. She says her
name is Madame Ponsolle. She lives in Bayonne and goes across to
visit her sick daughter in San Sebastian. She stays the night with
the daughter and returns."</p>

<p>"Are the umbrellas always the same?"</p>

<p>"No, since you mention it, they are not. Sometimes she carries
an old blue one with a black-and-white handle; sometimes a black
one with a brown handle. I have not made a careful note, but it has
struck me that the umbrellas are not always the same. What were you
thinking?"</p>

<p>"They may be a sign. A message may be conveyed by such
means."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but, I don't see how a message could affect the
smuggling of gold."</p>

<p>"It might be worth while to follow her. If the umbrellas were
always the same, I agree we could dismiss her as a crank, but the
fact that they are different&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Very good. I'll have her followed if she comes through
again."</p>

<p>The two friends arrived at Irun the same afternoon, and
Freycinet made arrangements to have all the passengers on the
evening express examined. None of his subordinates had anything to
report. The old lady with the two umbrellas had not been through
again. Tolozan took up his position on the platform, the figure of
an indolent, rather bored commercial traveller, with a leather
attach&eacute; case, and a small pile of Parisian newspapers tucked
under his arm. When the train came in, and the passengers were
turned out, and headed into the Custom House, he also drifted
thither. The noise was deafening&mdash;sleepy passengers grumbling
at the disturbance, porters struggling with bags and trunks,
everyone&mdash;including the inspectors&mdash;irritable and
peevish. Tolozan was pushed hither and thither. Suddenly above the
din he heard a shrill voice calling out:</p>

<p>"Oh, you devils! All this again, you miserable toads. As though
a lady of my irreproachable character can't carry an umbrella
without having all these magpies pecking at her. Ah, there he is!
There's a pretty apple-cheeked young man. Ren&eacute;! I'm sure his
name is Ren&eacute;. Come, come along. Hurry, little one. Much as
we love you, we can't spend the night here."</p>

<p>Tolozan heard one of the porters mutter: "There she is again.
There's old Madame Fair and Foul."</p>

<p>She was waving her umbrellas threateningly, the centre of an
astonished group. Even the disgruntled passengers could not
restrain a smile, and the officials shrugged their shoulders
helplessly. She was rather a tall woman with a black shawl round
her head and a shabby black frock. The shawl partly concealed her
face. A mop of white hair dangled down, almost covering her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Look at that extraordinary old woman," people were exclaiming.
"All her luggage seems to consist of two umbrellas."</p>

<p>While they were indulging in this reflection, an official came
in, and in an enormous voice bellowed out:</p>

<p>"All women to the right. All men to the left."</p>

<p>A search! Freycinet's work. Grumbles turned into curses,
irritation into violent abuse. Scandalous! What was the meaning of
it all? As though it wasn't bad enough to go through the Customs!
Where was liberty, equality, fraternity? What were these busybodies
thinking of? Sweating and groaning, the people poured into the
adjoining rooms and quickly forgot all about the old woman with the
umbrellas. Ten minutes later Tolozan drifted into a little office
where Freycinet sat in state. Various officials were bustling in
and out of the room.</p>

<p>"Well, old man?" he said, on observing Tolozan.</p>

<p>"I should like to examine the old lady's umbrellas."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the umbrellas were brought. There was nothing
about them to arouse the slightest suspicion except that one, with
a jade green handle, looked more expensive than the costume of the
old lady seemed to justify. The other was shabby enough, with a
handle of brown wood. Tolozan naturally examined the frames
carefully to see if there was any patent spring, or any possibility
of gold being secreted. But he quickly realised that such an
eventuality was quite out of the case. There was no spring, the
stems were much too thin, and the green one was made of steel.</p>

<p>"Would you like to question her?" said Freycinet.</p>

<p>"No," replied Tolozan. "Have you detailed anyone to follow
her?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"In that case it would amuse me to follow her myself, if you
have no objection."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I should be delighted, if you really
think&mdash;if you don't think it will be wasting your time."</p>

<p>"An idea occurred to me whilst I was watching the crowd in the
Custom House. I would rather not say anything about it. I may be on
the wrong track. But twenty-four hours' delay won't make such a
grave difference."</p>

<p>"Very good. The Spanish train leaves in a quarter of an
hour."</p>

<p>It is characteristic of Tolozan that he said very little about
his trip over the border. His attitude all through was that he was
a helper, not an actor, in this little drama. He wanted Freycinet
to find things out for himself. He was merely assisting,
suggesting. He did not return the next day. Indeed, he did not
return for over a week; but on the third day Freycinet received a
mysterious and cryptic message from him. It was scribbled across a
half sheet of notepaper like a formula from a school text, and was
initialled "T." It ran as follows:</p>

<p>"If one's attention is arrested by an old woman with two
umbrellas one is apt to overlook a young man with a
walking-stick."</p>

<p>Whatever did he mean? A young man with a walking-stick? Had
Tolozan seen or heard anything? Why didn't he return? Freycinet
continued his worrying tactics at the frontier town. He was
becoming unpopular among his subordinates, who were getting tired
of being nagged and sworn at by weary travellers. The old lady with
the two umbrellas had returned as usual the next day and gone back
to Bayonne.</p>

<p>"When he comes back I suppose I must keep my eyes skinned for a
young man with a walking-stick," thought Freycinet, who held his
old chief in almost reverential awe. Truly enough, the day after
receiving the message, Madame Ponsolle appeared again. Freycinet
followed her into the Custom House. There she was as garrulous and
noisy as ever. Freycinet glanced around. There was the same crowd
as usual&mdash;Basque peasants, clerks, shopkeepers, commercial
travellers, a few English and American tourists. A young man with a
walking-stick? Well, of course, there were several. Many of the men
were carrying walking-sticks. However, he felt bound to act upon
his friend's hint, so he went up to one young man who was standing
close behind the old lady, and tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Will you please come with me," he said.</p>

<p>The young man looked scared, but followed him quickly enough. In
the office he said:</p>

<p>"Please show me your papers."</p>

<p>Maxim Quinson, aged 43, traveller in machine tools to Messrs.
Charbonel et Cie, engineers of Bordeaux, visiting firms in San
Sebastian, Bilbao. Yes, everything in order.</p>

<p>"Open your valise and remove your overcoat."</p>

<p>The young man did as he was ordered.</p>

<p>In the valise were a few catalogues and papers, clean linen,
boots, and night attire. Nothing of any consequence. Neither did
the contents of his clothing reveal anything more interesting.</p>

<p>"This is ridiculous," thought Freycinet, "if I've got to arrest
every man who carries a walking-stick."</p>

<p>The little traveller was sent on his journey.</p>

<p>A few days later Tolozan returned.</p>

<p>"Has the old lady with the two umbrellas been through again?"
was the first question he asked.</p>

<p>"No," replied Freycinet. "But I should think she is about due.
Have you anything to report, Tolozan?"</p>

<p>Tolozan looked relieved, and slightly mysterious. He plucked at
his beard thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I would rather wait till after the evening train has been in
before I express any opinion. In the meantime, let us see whether
Madame Delarme can give us an omelette and a ragout. That Spanish
food always nauseates me." Tolozan was in gay humour over their
meal, and refused to discuss the affair of smuggled gold.</p>

<p>When the evening train came in, however, they both were on the
watch, and mingling with the crowd in the Custom House.</p>

<p>"As I thought," muttered Tolozan. The old lady with the two
umbrellas was as noisy and active as ever. Freycinet looked eagerly
to see if the young man with the walking-stick was accompanying
her. He was not. But, of course, there were other men with
walking-sticks struggling and gesticulating near the barrier.</p>

<p>"As I thought," again muttered Tolozan.</p>

<p>Freycinet glanced quickly at his friend. He was regarding a pale
middle-aged man standing behind the old lady.</p>

<p>"That's not the man who accompanied her the other day,"
whispered Freycinet.</p>

<p>"No? Does it occur to you that anything else is similar?"</p>

<p>"No-o, I can't say it does. Does it occur to you?"</p>

<p>"Only this&mdash;although it's not the same man, it's the same
walking-stick."</p>

<p>"Good God!"</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Freycinet! Isn't it more important for the
Government to know where the gold comes from rather than where it
goes to? Think. As a matter of fact, I believe I know where it goes
to."</p>

<p>"You know where it goes to! You make me feel like a baby,
Tolozan. Do you mean to say that the gold is actually in that
stick? And I had it in my hands the other day!"</p>

<p>"I have every reason to believe that it is. But there is another
point. I doubt whether the man who is carrying it knows what he is
carrying. There's only one person in this crowd who knows and
that's the old woman with the two umbrellas&mdash;the decoy."</p>

<p>Freycinet braced himself up. He knew that his friend expected
him to act, that he was leaving it to him. He walked quickly out of
the Custom House. In a few minutes an official entered and
announced that everyone was to be searched again. He asked Tolozan
to accompany him to his little office. "I'm simply doing this so
that the old lady shan't know we have found out," he said to
Tolozan, with the glance of a terrier seeking approval from his
master. In a few minutes the man with the walking-stick was brought
in.</p>

<p>"Your papers, please, and then open your bag and remove your
coat," said Freycinet; and then casually: "What a very handsome
cane! Allow me!"</p>

<p>He took the cane and examined it. It certainly was handsome. It
was made of some very hard South American wood&mdash;possibly snake
wood. It had a silver knob and a broad silver band a few inches
from the top. It was uncommonly heavy. Freycinet gave the knob
several twists, but nothing happened. Then he tried the silver
band. At the third attempt it moved. Exerting great pressure, he
succeeded in making it revolve.</p>

<p>"I observe you carry a sword-stick, Monsieur Grimaux," he
remarked.</p>

<p>The man looked very agitated. He was standing in his
shirt-sleeves. He mumbled:</p>

<p>"It doesn't belong to me, inspector. I borrowed it."</p>

<p>"Ah! Someone is very trusting. What is all this?"</p>

<p>The top of the stick had come off. Freycinet was pouring out on
the deal office table a stream of gold louis pieces!</p>

<p>The expression on the man's face was a strange mixture of
amazement and fear. He burst into a sob.</p>

<p>"I know nothing about it, inspector. I know nothing about
it."</p>

<p>"You know that smuggling gold over the frontier is a penal
offence?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I've heard so, monsieur, but I know nothing about it. I
didn't know the cane had gold concealed in it. Someone asked me to
bring it. I've a wife and three children, monsieur. I'm a poor man.
I've never done anything dishonest. I swear, inspector, I know
nothing about it."</p>

<p>"Come, come, pull yourself together. We want to get at the
truth. It will pay you to be quite candid. If you lie you will go
to prison. If you speak the exact truth, we may let you go. Tell us
exactly how you came by this."</p>

<p>The man was a poor specimen. His teeth were chattering. He
blurted out:</p>

<p>"They threatened to kill me if I blabbed."</p>

<p>"Go on. Tell us the exact story."</p>

<p>"I'm a traveller in hosiery," he stammered. "I bought my ticket
for Bilbao at the ticket-office in Bayonne, where I come from. Just
after I had got it a lady comes up to me and says: 'Excuse me,
monsieur; I heard you say you were going to Bilbao. I wonder
whether you would do me a favour?' 'Charmed, madamoiselle,' I
replied. She handed me the walking-stick and said, 'Will you take
this stick to my husband? He values it very much. He will give you
two hundred francs for your kindness.' I said I was delighted. I am
a poor man, and I have three children, one ailing. She said, 'Wait
two minutes and I'll get you the address.' She disappeared in the
crowd. A few minutes later an individual came up to me that I
didn't like the look of at all. He looked like a bull-fighter. He
said: 'The lady can't come back, but it's all right. Your
instructions are this&mdash;you've got to hang on to that cane like
grim death and never let it out of your sight. On the platform
you'll see an old woman with two umbrellas. You go up to her and
let her see you've got the stick, but you don't speak to her. You
keep close to her all the way to Bilbao, especially in the Customs.
The next morning after you get to Bilbao, you walk along the Calle
Major at twelve-fifteen. Just before you come to San Stefano you'll
meet a man with a blue rosette in his buttonhole. You hand him the
stick, and he'll give you an envelope containing two hundred
francs. That's all you have to do. It's money easily made. Only
don't let there be any nonsense.' He held his face close to mine
and said in a horrible voice: 'If you footle the little arrangement
you'll get a knife between your ribs.' And there it is, Monsieur
Inspector. I've footled it. I'm in danger. Oh! I wish I'd never
seen the stick."</p>

<p>Freycinet counted out the gold pieces. There were exactly two
hundred and seventy-eight. They fitted perfectly into the hollow of
the stick, which had obviously been made for them. He deliberately
poured them all back into the stick and snapped the top to. Then,
to the amazement of the traveller in hosiery, he handed it back to
him and said:</p>

<p>"We don't want you to be killed, Monsieur Grimaux; continue your
journey and carry out your instructions, and not a word of this to
anyone."</p>

<p>When this dazed individual had managed to escape from the room,
Freycinet turned to Tolozan and said:</p>

<p>"I see your point. It is more necessary to find out where this
gold comes from than where it goes to."</p>

<p>He rang a bell and a subordinate appeared.</p>

<p>"Tardieu," he said, "follow that man who has just gone out of
the bureau with a kit-bag and walking-stick. He's going to Bilbao.
But I want you to follow the stick and not the man. When he gives
it up, follow the person he has given it to, and come back and
report as soon as possible."</p>

<p>When the sub-inspector had gone, Tolozan nodded sagely.</p>

<p>There was nothing more to do that night, so the friends
adjourned to a local caf&eacute;, and Tolozan was quite eloquent
upon the new theories of Professor Einstein, the influence of Comte
upon modern theological reactions, and the splendour of rum
omelettes as supplied by the stepmother of one of his daughter's
school friends. Freycinet was sometimes a little abstracted during
these dissertations. He could not get his mind off the case in
hand. While Tolozan was talking about relativity, he was
thinking:</p>

<p>"How am I going to get hold of the real culprits? The old lady
with the two umbrellas is not going to run undue risks. A clever
idea to get all this smuggling done for you by innocent people. Who
is he? Who gets hold of the gold in the first place? Where does it
go to? It's all so disconnected. Whoever I arrest will say they
know nothing about it. There must be some big organisation at the
back somewhere. Who is it? What does Tolozan think? Damn
Einstein!"</p>

<p>Three days later Tardieu returned. This was his story. He had
followed the traveller in hosiery to Bilbao. The man had gone to a
quiet hotel, where Tardieu also secured a room. He had gone to bed
early and taken the walking-stick with him. The next morning he had
taken it out. He appeared very agitated. He sat about on the
boulevards, and kept on looking at his watch. At twelve o'clock he
had walked quickly to the Calle Major. There he had met a man with
a blue rosette in his buttonhole. He handed the cane over to him,
and received an envelope in exchange. Tardieu followed the man with
the blue rosette. He entered a restaurant and ordered lunch. In a
few minutes another man entered and joined him at table. They
talked quietly and were quick over their lunch. When it was
finished they parted, but Tardieu observed that in the process of
departure they had exchanged walking-sticks. He followed the second
man, who hailed a cab. Tardieu also got a cab and bade the driver
follow. They drove up to the commercial centre of the Town. The man
got out and entered a building divided up into various business
offices. He went up on the first floor and entered a room labelled
"Private." It was part of a suite of rooms belonging to a big
banking concern connected with one of the South American republics.
Tolozan would not tell the name of this republic, but I gathered
that it was a country whose Government had never been very friendly
to France.</p>

<p>Anyhow, in these offices Tardieu lost sight of the
walking-stick. The individual he had tracked returned without it in
about twenty minutes' time and drove away. The detective watched
the building for twenty-four hours, and though clerks and officials
were coming and going all the time no one came out with the
walking-stick. He then thought it advisable to report to his chief
as he had been instructed to do so as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"H'm," thought Freycinet. "I've bungled it again. We have lost
sight of the stick. To find it on its way back to Paris will be
like looking for a needle in a haystack."</p>

<p>However, there was nothing to do but to lie in wait for it at
Irun station and trust to luck. He detailed two inspectors to go
through each train as it came through, and to search for the stick
in most unlikely places. He and Tardieu took up positions in the
Custom House. Tolozan wandered languidly hither and thither. On the
second day, on the morning train the old lady with the two
umbrellas appeared, and the staff doubled their exertions. She
seemed less talkative than usual, and was attracting little
attention. Neither did there appear to be anyone dancing attendance
upon her. Several walking-sticks appeared in the Custom House, but
not one that resembled the all-important one to the slightest
degree. Freycinet was beginning to feel discouraged. He felt that
his whole career depended upon his success over this search. To
fail would be a terrible misfortune, but to fail under the eye of
Tolozan, and helped by his advice, would make the position doubly
bitter. He rushed hither and thither like a terrier on a rabbit
warren. It irritated him at one moment to observe Tolozan idly
chatting with a tall angular English clergyman, a ridiculous
foreign tourist in a mackintosh, and carrying the inevitable bag of
golf-clubs. As he passed he heard Tolozan droning about "mashies"
and "niblicks." Why wasn't he helping in the hunt? What had he come
from Bordeaux for? In five minutes' time the express would be
leaving and another opportunity lost. Five minutes, four minutes,
three minutes&mdash;someone tapped him on the shoulder. It was
Tolozan. Tolozan, with a slight flush of excitement tingling his
normal lethargy. He nodded in the direction of the train.</p>

<p>"In the third coach," he whispered. "Bound for Paris."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"The English cur&eacute;, the golf player."</p>

<p>"What about him?"</p>

<p>"He's got the walking-stick in his golf-bag."</p>

<p>A horn was blowing, warning people of the departure of the
train.</p>

<p>"<i>En voiture! En voiture!</i>"</p>

<p>Freycinet leaped upon that train like a cat springing at a bird.
It was very crowded, and he had to stand in the corridor. He had to
stand in the corridor nearly all the way to Paris, but he felt that
the discomfort was thoroughly justified. In a corner seat lolled
the angular English clergyman, with his golf-clubs in a bag on the
rack above him. Freycinet had plenty of time to consider how to
act. He wandered about the corridor and smoked until lunch was
served in the dining-car. As he expected, the clergyman was one of
the first to make a bee-line for that abode of material
refreshment. When he had gone, Freycinet slipped into his seat. He
was glad of the rest. He waited a few minutes; then he reached up
and pulled things about on the rack, as though searching for
something. The action was sufficient to enable him to verify
Tolozan's statement. There was the walking-stick, buried amongst
mashies and niblicks and drivers. He smiled contentedly and read a
newspaper. At the end of an hour the reverend gentleman returned.
Freycinet jumped up and said in English:</p>

<p>"Pardon, sir. I had not the good fortune to secure a seat, so I
took advantage of your absence to take a little rest."</p>

<p>"Quayte! Quayte! Don't let me disturb you."</p>

<p>"Ah, no, monsieur. I should not think of usurping&mdash;excuse
me."</p>

<p>The little scrimmage in manners was sufficient to inaugurate a
formal acquaintanceship. They talked about the weather, and the
luncheon service on the train, and the condition of the greens on
the San Sebastian golf course. Then Freycinet went in to lunch
himself. He had no desire to be more intimate with the clergyman
than the exigencies of the case demanded. He spoke to him once or
twice on the journey to Paris, but it was not until the train was
slackening up on its last run through that long tunnel into the
Gare Quai d'Orsay that Freycinet suddenly whispered:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, monsieur. In your golf-bag you have a walking-stick.
Will you be good enough to tell me how you came by it?"</p>

<p>The clergyman looked surprised, hesitated, and said
blushingly,</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;H'm&mdash;yes. Quayte. Quayte so. Rather peculiah
affair. Man at San Sebastian station&mdash;ah&mdash;came up to me
and asked me if I would object to taking it to Paris. Some
other&mdash;ah&mdash;um&mdash;fellow at the Quai d'Orsay with an
ambah tiepin in a blue tie would meet me and ask for it&mdash;very
old and&mdash;ah&mdash;valuable
stick&mdash;heirloom&mdash;ha&mdash;h'm&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>The man was at the station all right, and the clergyman
departed.</p>

<p>(If the Reverend Peter Dorking, of Instill Rectory, near
Dewsbury, should ever read these lines, let him stand up and take
note that he was very nearly involved in a very serious case.
Moreover, he might just as well have had the courage to speak the
truth. There was nothing to be ashamed of in the fact that it was a
<i>lady</i> who gave him the stick and not a man!)</p>

<p>In any case, with the advent of the man with the "ambah" tiepin,
Freycinet's interest in the clergyman vanished. He became very
alert. As I said before, I had to dig all these details out of
Tolozan. He contended that the case was the making of Freycinet,
and that he showed great acumen and energy over it. Of course, he
took no credit for any of it to himself. However that may be, it is
certain that Freycinet is now held in high esteem by the Police
Intelligence Headquarters in Paris, as well as by certain members
of the Government. The disappointing thing is that I am pledged in
secrecy to Tolozan not to reveal a certain name. When he came to it
he seemed so reluctant to mention it that he eventually wrote it
down on the back of an envelope and then tore it into little pieces
with an angry gesture. The sight of that name made me gasp.</p>

<p>It appears that the same procedure was followed as that which
had taken place in Bilbao, when Tardieu followed up the delivery of
the walking-stick. The man with the amber tiepin drove to a small
caf&eacute; in the Rue de la Boetie. There he was joined by a man
and a girl. They had two drinks together, and then the man and the
girl departed, and the walking-stick again changed hands. Freycinet
nearly missed them, owing to the difficulty of picking up a taxi,
but he got one just as they were nearly out of sight. A Parisian
taxi-driver requires no encouragement to drive like a madman,
because that is his normal method. The cabs raced up the Champs
Elys&eacute;es and turned to the left. They drove down the Avenue
Malakof, and then the front cab began to pull up.</p>

<p>Freycinet said that when he observed the house where the cab
stopped he felt his heart beating violently. He knew the gorgeous
Renaissance edifice quite well by sight. It belonged to one of the
wealthiest and most influential men in Paris, a member of the
Government, and a high official at the Treasury. We will call him
Monsieur P&mdash; . Freycinet could not believe but that there must
be some mistake, and then certain rumours and stories recurred to
him. The two people departed, and an hour later he saw Monsieur
P&mdash; himself come out of the house and enter his car. He was
carrying the walking-stick in his hand. Freycinet had dismissed his
cab, and there were none others about. He stopped and pretended to
light a cigarette. He heard Monsieur P&mdash; say:</p>

<p>"Drive first to the Treasury."</p>

<p>It was easy to see how the gold of the Republic was leaking
away!</p>

<p>In describing this incident Monsieur Tolozan looked as though he
were still tingling with the sense of outrage; then he smiled
wistfully, and added:</p>

<p>"As you may imagine, my friend, gold was not the only thing at
the back of this affair. As occurs not infrequently in our beloved
France, a woman was the agent of a man's destruction. They never
arrested Monsieur P&mdash; . With one so highly placed a different
procedure is usually adopted. He was simply notified that there was
to be an interpellation, that certain facts were to be made public.
You may remember the unfortunate affair of Monsieur P&mdash; . He
slept in a small room on the first floor in that house in the
Avenue Malakof. One night, a week after these events, he went to
bed as usual, but some servant had been tinkering with the top of
the stove which heated the room. Disgracefully careless, these
servants! The gas trickled out&mdash;hour after hour passed. Poor
fellow! He was found quite dead by his man-servant in the morning.
A deplorable ending to a brilliant career...deplorable, most
deplorable."</p>

<p>"But the woman?" I ventured to interject.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, the woman. Truly...As you know, Monsieur P&mdash; was
an elderly married man of irreproachable social character. He had
two sons, one in the Army and the other in the Diplomatic Service.
This woman suddenly appeared, no one quite knows from where. She
was a Spanish woman, not particularly beautiful, but she exercised
strange powers over many men. She was a dancer and actress, and
went by the name of 'Juanita.' Indeed, she still sings and dances
at our best variety theatres. She dances beautifully. If it would
not bore you, we might go together this evening to see her. She is
dancing at the Casino de Paris."</p>

<p>"That would be delightful. But tell me, Monsieur Tolozan, was
this woman in any way responsible for P&mdash;'s criminal smuggling
of gold?"</p>

<p>"We have every reason to believe so, but we could never bring
anything home to her. She is clever, very clever. We know that,
although of Spanish stock, she comes originally from that South
American State I have mentioned. She has wealthy and influential
friends there, and she returns every year. Paris harbours many such
women. She is a clever actress on the stage, but an even cleverer
one off."</p>

<p>"You have had experience of it?"</p>

<p>"On one occasion, yes."</p>

<p>"When was that?"</p>

<p>"She was the old lady with the two umbrellas."</p>

<p>"But, good Heavens! Tolozan, why haven't they arrested her?"</p>

<p>"Arrested! Tell me, what did she ever do except cross the front
with one superfluous umbrella? There's nothing criminal in that.
Come, let us go to the Casino. You will be delighted."</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>16. THE BENT TREE</h2>

<p>The call was irresistible. I had tramped for nearly two hours
along the white road, when suddenly a long stretch of open heath
with sparsely-scattered trees and high gorse bushes invited me to
break my journey and to seek the shade of a wood that fringed it on
the western side. The ground sloped upwards at a steep gradient and
I was soon among the cool shadows of the larch trees. After
climbing for nearly half-an-hour I found myself on a kind of
plateau, looking down upon one of the most beautiful sights in the
world, the Weald of Sussex trembling in a grey heat mist framed
through a thin belt of trees. I pushed forward, determining to rest
in this most attractive spot. Nearing the fringe of this little
clump, I observed a bent tree in a clearing. As I approached it it
occurred to me that the subject before me was curiously like
Corot's famous masterpiece. It was indeed a wonderful and romantic
spot. Beneath me a river rambled through the meadows and became
lost in the grey-blue distances. There was no sign of civilisation
except sleepy cattle and the well-kept fields, and occasionally a
village nestling in the hollow of the downs. The only sound was the
movement of leaves, the drone of bees and the lowing of cattle in
the distant meadows.</p>

<p>I sat down on the bent tree, and as I looked around it occurred
to me that the spot I had chosen was like a little arbour. It might
have been the home of some God of ancient Britain, who could have
lived here undisturbed through all the generations. I was wondering
whether anyone else had ever penetrated to this glorious retreat
from the world when my eye caught a small square of white paper
pinned on the trunk of the bent tree. I examined it, and lo! on it
was written in ink: "GONE TO LUNCH, BACK IN 20 MINUTES."</p>

<p>Now if there is one thing that makes me wretchedly unhappy it is
the action of people who find pleasure in disfiguring nature, in
carving their initials on tree-trunks, in scattering paper and
orange peel about the countryside; but somehow, when I caught sight
of this absurd city office formula pinned to a tree in this most
inaccessible and romantic spot, I must confess that "my lungs did
crow like Chanticleer." I felt that here indeed was the work of a
vast and subtle humorist. The formula was so familiar. How often
had I waited hours in murky passages, buoyed up by this engaging
promise! It seemed so redolent of drab staircases, and files and
roll-top desks, that its very mention out here struck a fantastic
note. That anyone should suggest that he carried on a business
here, that his time was precious, that after gulping down a cup of
coffee, he would rush back, cope with increasing press of affairs,
seemed to me wonderfully and amazingly funny. I must acknowledge
that I made myself rather ridiculous. I laughed till the tears
streamed down my face, and my only desire was for a companion with
whom to share the manna of this gigantic jest. I looked at the card
again. It was comparatively clean, so I presumed that the joke had
been perpetrated quite recently.</p>

<p>And then I began to wonder whether the jester would return,
whether, after all, the slip had any significance. Was it the
message of a poacher to a friend? Or was this the secret meeting
place of some gods of High Finance? I determined in any case to
wait the allotted span, and in the meantime I stretched myself on
the stem of the bent tree, and, lighting a cigarette, prepared to
enjoy the tranquillity of the scene.</p>

<p>It was barely ten minutes before my siesta was disturbed by a
man coming stealthily up the slope. He was a medium-sized,
sallow-faced fellow, with small tired eyes set in dark hollows. He
was wearing a tailcoat and a bowler hat. He shuffled quickly
through the wood, pushing the branches of the trees away from him.
His eyes fixed me furtively, and as he entered the little arbour,
he took off his hat and fidgetted with it, as though looking for a
customary hook on which to hang it.</p>

<p>"I hope I haven't kept you waiting?" was his greeting.</p>

<p>"Not at all," I found myself answering, for lack of a more
suitable reply.</p>

<p>"Did Binders send you?" he asked tentatively.</p>

<p>"No," I replied, pulling myself together. "I just happened to
come here."</p>

<p>A look of disappointment passed over his face. "Oh!" he said,
walking up and down. "I sometimes do a bit with Binders and his
friends, you know"&mdash;he waved his arms vaguely&mdash;"you know,
from Corlesham."</p>

<p>Corlesham I knew to be a village rather more than two miles
away, a sleepy hamlet of less than fifty souls.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," I replied, more with the idea of not discouraging
him than because any particular light had come to me.</p>

<p>He looked at me searchingly for some moments, and then, going
over to a thick gorse bush, he knelt down and groped underneath and
presently produced a thick pile of papers and circulars.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether you would like to do anything in these? These
West Australians are good. They're right down to 65. If you can
hold on, a sure thing. If you would like a couple of thousand
now..." he was nervously biting his nails; then he said, "Could you
spare me a cigarette?"</p>

<p>I produced my case and handed him one.</p>

<p>"Thanks very much," he said. "They don't like me to smoke at
home," and he waved his hand towards the north. I followed the
direction, and just caught sight of the top of a gable of a large
red-brick building through the trees.</p>

<p>So this was a solution.</p>

<p>"This is a glorious place," I said.</p>

<p>This seemed a very harmless platitude and one not likely to
drive a being to despair. But it had a strange effect on my
individual, for he sat down on a broken branch and burst into a
paroxysm of invective.</p>

<p>"Oh, Gawd!" he said. "I hate it, hate the sight of it! Day after
day&mdash;all the same! All these blinkin' trees and
fields&mdash;all the same, nothing happenin' ever."</p>

<p>I found it very difficult to meet this outburst. I could think
of nothing to say, so I kept silent. After a time he got up,
puffing feverishly at the cigarette, and walked round the little
arbour. Every now and then he would stop and make a gesture towards
the shrubs. I believe he was visualising files and folios, ledgers,
and typewriters. He made a movement of opening and shutting
drawers.</p>

<p>"You've been a bit run down, haven't you?" I said at last, with
a feeble attempt to bridge the gulf.</p>

<p>He looked at me uncertainly, and wiped the perspiration from his
brow.</p>

<p>"I was unlucky," he said sullenly. "I worked like a nigger for
thirty years, but so do the others&mdash;lots of them&mdash;and
they're all right. Just sheer bad luck, if you know what I mean. I
can do it now when they let me. That's why I come here. Binders
helps me a bit. He sends me people. And, do you know?" he whispered
to me confidentially, "I've got the postman on my side. He delivers
me letters here at twopence a time. Look! here is my mail-box!" He
stooped down and lifted a large stone and produced a further pole
of correspondence and circulars. "Would you like to buy some of
these Trinidads? I could work it for you."</p>

<p>He looked at me anxiously, and I made some elaborate excuse for
not seizing such a splendid opportunity. He sighed, and placed the
papers back under the stone.</p>

<p>"Have you ever dealt in big things?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not&mdash;in your sense," I answered, nurturing an
instinctive sense of outraged superiority against this person who,
I felt, despised me.</p>

<p>"You know what I mean by big things," he said fiercely.
"Millions and millions, and the lives and works of millions of
people! Do you know why I come down here to this rotten little
clearing? Because it sometimes reminds me of my office off
Throgmorton Street. Look! It was just this size. I had my desk over
there. Horswall, my secretary, had his desk here. Here was the
fireplace. The press just here by the window. Here the shelves with
all the files. Can you imagine what it's like to have been there
all those years, to have worked up what I did&mdash;all out of
nothing, mark you!&mdash;to have got the whole rubber market in the
hollow of my hand!&mdash;and then, oh, God! to be condemned
to&mdash;this!" and he made a gesture of fierce contempt towards
the Weald of Sussex.</p>

<p>"For nearly two years now," he continued, "I've been living in
this hole."</p>

<p>"Nature has a way," I said, in my most sententious manner, "of
coming back on us."</p>

<p>"Naycher! Naycher!" he almost screamed. "Don't talk to me about
Naycher! What sort of friend is Naycher to me or you? Naycher gives
you inclinations and then breaks you for following them! Two men
fall into a pond&mdash;what does Naycher care that one man was
trying to drown his enemy while the other was trying to save a dog?
They both stand their chance of death. Naycher leads you up blind
alleys and into marshes and lets you rot. Besides, isn't man
Naycher? Isn't it Naycher for me to work and make money, as it is
for these blighting birds to sing? Aren't roll-top desks as much
Naycher as&mdash;these blasted trees?"</p>

<p>He blinked savagely at the surrounding scene. The smoke from a
distant hamlet drifted sleepily heavenwards, like incense to the
gods of the Downs.</p>

<p>"My father was a turner in Walham Green, and he apprenticed me
to the joinery, but I had my ambitions even in those times." He
nodded knowingly, and mopped his brow. "At eighteen I was a clerk
in a wholesale house in St. Paul's Churchyard. For three years I
worked there underground, by artificial light. Then I got made
sub-manager of a wharf at the South end of Lower Thames Street. I
was there for five years, and saved nearly three hundred pounds out
of a salary of &pound;120 a year. Then I met Jettison, and we
started that office together, Jettison &amp; Gateshead, Commission
Agents. Work and struggle, work and struggle, year after year. But
it was not till I got on to rubber that I began to make things
move. That was eight years after. Do you remember the boom? I got
in with Gayo, who had lived out in the Malay Straits&mdash;knew
everything&mdash;we got the whole game at our fingers' ends. We
knew just when to buy and just when to sell. Do you know, I've made
as much as four thousand pounds in one afternoon, just talking on
the telephone! And we done it all in that little room"&mdash;he
gazed jealously round the little arbour in the hills, and scowled
at me. Then he produced a packet of cigarettes and lighted one from
the stump of the last one.</p>

<p>"In those days, through Gayo's friends, we followed the whole
course of the raw stuff. Then Gayo went out to Malay, and he used
to cable me every few days, putting me on to the right thing. My
God, he was a man! It went on for two years, when suddenly a cable
came to say he was dead&mdash;fever, or something, up-country. That
was the end. The slump came soon after. I worked hard, but I never
got control back. Down and down and down they went, as though Gayo
was dragging them through the earth." His lower lip trembled as he
rolled the emaciated cigarette over.</p>

<p>"Lord, what a fight I had, though I sat in that office there, in
my shirt-sleeves, day and night for months on end, checking tapes,
cabling, lying, faking, bluffing"&mdash;he chuckled with a
meditative intensity. "I'd have done it then, if they'd given me
time. But they closed in; there were two Scotch firms, and a man
named Klaus. I knew they meant to do me down. There was a set
against me. I wasn't there in the end. I was sitting in the office
one night..." He passed his hand over his brow and swept away a
wasp that had settled there. He sat silent for some moments, as
though trying to recall things, and twice started to speak without
framing a sentence.</p>

<p>"My brother was very good to me," he said suddenly, waving his
hand towards the red-brick gable in the trees. "He was very good to
me all through." Then he added, with a sort of contemptuous shrug,
"In the cabinet-making he was; got a little works at Bow&mdash;made
about four hundred a year&mdash;married, and five children."</p>

<p>He sat for some minutes with his head in his hands, and then he
sat up and gazed upon the joyous landscape with unseeing eyes.</p>

<p>I ventured to remark, "Well, I'm sure this place ought to do you
good." He turned his melancholy eyes upon me, and sighed.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, after a pause. "You're just the sort. I've seen
so many of you about. Some of you have butterfly nets." He kept
repeating at intervals, "Butterfly nets!" One felt that the last
word in contumely had been uttered. He sank into an apathy of
indifference. Then he broke out again.</p>

<p>"I tell you," he uttered fiercely, "that I had millions and
millions. I controlled the work and the lives of millions of men,
and you come here and talk to me of Naycher. Look at these damned
trees! They go green in the summer, yellow in the autumn, and bare
in the winter. Year after year, exactly the same thing, and that's
all there is in it. I'm sick of the sight of them. But look at men!
Think of their lives, the variety! What they can do! Their clothes,
their furniture, their houses, their cities! Think of their power!
The power of making and marring!"</p>

<p>"You mean the power of buying and selling," I ventured.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's just it!" he said, feeling that he was converting
me.</p>

<p>"The power of buying and selling! Of making men rich or poor!"
He stood up and waved his thin arms and gazed wildly round him.
"Not chasing butterflies!"</p>

<p>At the moment we both became aware that a third person was on
the scene. He was a well set-up man, with broad shoulders and
narrow hips. He was dressed in a dark-blue serge suit and a tweed
cap. He stepped quietly through the trees, and went up to my
companion, and said:</p>

<p>"Ah! there you are, Mr. Gateshead. I'm afraid it's almost time
for your afternoon nap, sir." And then, turning to me, he nodded
and remarked: "A warm afternoon, sir!" He spoke with a quiet, suave
voice that somehow conveyed the feeling of the 'iron hand in the
velvet glove.' His voice seemed to have a sedative effect on Mr.
Gateshead. My companion did not look at him, but he seemed to
shrink within himself. A certain flush that had accompanied his
excitement vanished, and his face looked old and set. He drew his
narrow shoulders together and his figure bent. He stood
abstractedly for a few moments, gazing at the trees around him, and
then, with a vague gesture that was characteristic of him, he
clutched the lapels of his coat, and with his head bent forward he
walked away towards the building. He did not cast a glance in my
direction, and the man in the serge suit nodded to me and followed
him leisurely.</p>

<p>I clambered down the slope of the wood, and for some reason felt
happy to get once more upon the road.</p>

<p>About half a mile from Corlesham I met the postman coming up the
hill, wheeling his bicycle. He was a sandy-haired man, splendidly
Saxon, with grey-blue eyes and broad mouth. I asked him if there
was a foot-path to Corlesham, and he directed me.</p>

<p>"Do you have a long round?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Three or four mile, maybe," he said, looking at me
narrowly.</p>

<p>"It's a good pull up to the Institution," I ventured.</p>

<p>"What institution might that be?" he said, and his mild blue
eyes disarmed me with their ingenuousness.</p>

<p>"The house with the three red gables," I answered.</p>

<p>"Oh!" came the reply. "You mean old Gateshead's."</p>

<p>"Does he own it?" I said incredulously.</p>

<p>"Ay, and he could own six others for all the difference it would
make to his money. He owns half the county."</p>

<p>"And yet what a strange idea," I murmured insinuatingly. "To own
a large house and yet to have one's letters delivered in a
wood!"</p>

<p>The postman swung his bag into a more comfortable position and
looked across his machine at me with a grin.</p>

<p>"Those as has money can afford to have any ideas they like," he
said at last.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid his money doesn't make him very happy," I ventured,
still groping for further enlightenment.</p>

<p>The postman gave his right pedal a vigorous twirl as a hint of
departure. He then took out a packet of Navy Cut cigarettes and
lighted one. This action seemed to stimulate his mental activities,
and he leant on the handle-bars and said:</p>

<p>"Ay, if one has no money maybe one can make oneself happy
thinking one has. And if one has money, maybe one can make oneself
happy by thinking one hasn't." He blinked at me, and then added, by
way of solving all life's mysteries: "If one&mdash;puts too much
store by these things."</p>

<p>I could find no remark to complement the postman's sententious
conclusions, and, dismissing me with a nod, he mounted his bicycle
and rode off up the hill.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>17. THE GOLDEN WINDMILL</h2>

<p>At the top of the hill the party halted. It had been a long trek
up and the sun was hot. Monsieur Roget fanned himself with his hat,
and his eye alighted on a large pile of cut fern-leaves.</p>

<p>"But this will suit me admirably!" he remarked, and he plumped
his squat little figure down, and taking out his large English pipe
he began to stuff tobacco into it.</p>

<p>"My little one," said his stout wife, "I should not advise you
to go to sleep. You know that to do so in the afternoon always
gives you an indisposition."</p>

<p>"Oh, la la! No, no, no. I do not go to sleep, but&mdash;this
position suits me admirably!" he replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, papa!...lazybones!" exclaimed his pretty daughter
Louise. "And if we leave you, you will sleep like a dormouse."</p>

<p>"It is very hot!" rejoined the father.</p>

<p>"Leave him alone," said Madame Roget, "and we will go down to
that place that looks like an inn, and see whether they will sell
us milk. Where is Lisette?"</p>

<p>"Lisette! Where should she be?"</p>

<p>And of course it was foolish to ask. Lisette, the younger
daughter, had been lost in the wood on the way up, with her
<i>fianc&eacute;</i>, Paul Fasquelle. Indeed, the party had all
become rather scattered. It is a peculiarity of picnics. Monsieur
Roget's eldest son, Anton, was playing at see-saw with his three
children on the trunk of a fallen tree. His wife was talking to
Madame Aubert, and occasionally glancing up to exclaim:</p>

<p>"Careful, my darlings!"</p>

<p>Monsieur Roget was left alone.</p>

<p>He lighted his pipe, and blinked at the sun. One has to have
reached a mature age to appreciate to the full the narcotic
seductiveness of good tobacco on the system, when the sun is
shining and there is no wind. If there is wind all the pleasant
memories and dreams are blown away, but if there is no wind the sun
becomes a kind, confidential old fellow. He is very, very mature.
And Monsieur Roget was mature. He was fifty-nine years old, given
to corpulence, rather moist and hot, but eminently comfortable
leaning against the pile of ferns. A glorious view across the woods
of Fontainebleau lay stretched before him, the bees droned in the
young gorse, his senses tingled with a pleasureable excitement,
and, as a man will in such moments, he enjoyed a sudden
crystallised epitome of his whole life. His struggles, and
failures, and successes. On the whole he had been a successful man.
If he died to-morrow, his beloved ones would be left in more than
comfort. Many thousand francs carefully invested, some house
property in the Rue Renoir, the three <i>comestibles</i>
establishments all doing reasonably well.</p>

<p>Things had not always been like that. There had been long years
of anxiety, worry, and even poverty. He had worked hard and it had
been a bitter struggle. When the children <i>were</i> children,
that had been the anxious time. It made Monsieur Roget shudder to
look back on it. But, God be praised! he had been fortunate, very
fortunate in his life-companion. During that anxious time, Madame
Roget had been patient, encouraging, incredibly thrifty, competent,
resourceful, a loyal wife, a very&mdash;Frenchwoman. And they had
come through. He was now a proud grandfather. Both his sons were
doing well, and were married. Lisette was engaged to a very
desirable young advocate. Of Louise there need be no apprehension.
In fact, everything...</p>

<p>"Name of a dog! that's very curious," suddenly thought Monsieur
Roget, interrupting his own pleasant reflections.</p>

<p>And for some minutes he could not determine exactly what it was
that was curious. He had been idly gazing at the clump of buildings
lower down the hill, whither his wife and daughter had gone in
search of milk. Perhaps the perfume of the young gorse had
something to do with it, but as he looked at the buildings, he
thought:</p>

<p>"It's very familiar, and it's very unfamiliar. In fact, it's
gone wrong. They've been monkeying with that gable on the east
side, and they've built a new loft over the stables."</p>

<p>But how should he know? What was the gable to him? or he to the
gable? He drew in a large mouthful of smoke, held it for some
seconds, and then blew it out in a cloud round his head. Where was
this? When had he been here before? They had driven out to a
village called Pavane-en-Bois, and from there they had walked, and
walked, and walked. He may have been here before, and have come
from another direction...</p>

<p>"Oo-eh!"</p>

<p>Monsieur Roget was glad that he was alone when he uttered this
exclamation, which cannot convey what it is meant to in print. Of
course, across there on the other side of the clearing was the low
stone wall, and the reliquary with the figure of the Virgin, and
doubtless at the bottom of the slope the other side would
be&mdash;the well!</p>

<p>It was exactly on this spot that he had met Diane&mdash;God in
heaven! how long ago? Ten, twenty, thirty...Exactly thirty-seven
years ago!</p>

<p>And how vividly it could all come back to one!</p>

<p>He was twenty-two, then, a slim young man&mdash;considered
elegant and rather distinguished-looking by some people&mdash;an
orphan without either brothers or sisters, the inheritor of a quite
substantial competence from his father, who had been a shipbroker
at Marseilles. He had gone to Paris to educate himself and to
prepare for a commercial career. He was a serious young man, with
modest ambitions, rather moody and given to abstract speculations.
Paris bewildered him, and he used to escape when he could, and seek
solitude in the country. At length he decided that he must settle
down to some definite career, and he became articled to a firm of
chartered accountants: Messrs. Manson et Cie. He took rooms at a
quiet <i>pension</i> near the Luxembourg, and there fell in love
with his patron's daughter, Lucile, a demure and modest brunette.
The affair was almost settled, but not quite. Monsieur Roget, even
in those days, was a man who never put his leg over the wall till
he had seen the other side. He was circumspect, cautious, and there
was indeed plenty of time.</p>

<p>And then one day he had found himself on this identical hillock.
He could not quite clearly remember how he came to be there.
Probably he had come for the day, to escape the clamour of Paris.
He certainly had no luggage. He was seated on this spot, dreaming
and enjoying the view, when he heard a cry coming from the other
side of the low stone wall. He jumped up and ran to it, and lo! on
the other side he beheld&mdash;Diane! The name was peculiarly
appropriate. She was lying there on her side like a wounded
huntress. When she caught sight of him she called out:</p>

<p>"Ah, monsieur, will you be so kind to help me? I fear I have
sprained my ankle."</p>

<p>Paul Roget leapt the wall and ran to her assistance (the thought
of leaping a wall now made him gasp!) He lifted her up, trembling
himself, and making sympathetic little clucks with his tongue.</p>

<p>"Pardon, pardon! very distressing!" he murmured, when she stood
erect.</p>

<p>"If monsieur will be good enough to allow me to rest my hand on
his shoulder, I shall be able to hop back to the auberge."</p>

<p>"With the greatest pleasure. Allow me."</p>

<p>On the ground was an upturned pail. He remarked:</p>

<p>"Would it distress mademoiselle to stand for one minute, whilst
I refill the pail?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no," she exclaimed. "Do not inconvenience
yourself."</p>

<p>"Then perhaps mademoiselle will allow me to return for the
pail?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, if you please! My father will do it."</p>

<p>She leant on his shoulder and hopped a dozen paces.</p>

<p>"How did it happen, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Imbecile that I am! I think I was dreaming. I had filled the
pail and was descending the embankment when I slipped. I tried to
step across the pail, but caught my foot in the rim. And
then&mdash;I don't know quite what happened. I fell. It is the
other ankle which I fear I have sprained."</p>

<p>"I am indeed most desolated. Is it far to the inn?"</p>

<p>"You see it yonder, monsieur. It is perhaps ten minutes' walk,
but twenty minutes' hop."</p>

<p>She laughed gaily, and Monsieur Roget said solemnly:</p>

<p>"If I might suggest it&mdash;I think it would be more
comfortable for Mademoiselle if she would condescend to place her
arm round my neck."</p>

<p>"It is too good of you."</p>

<p>They proceeded another hundred paces in silence, and then rested
against a stile. Suddenly she gave him one of her quick glances,
and said:</p>

<p>"You are very silent, monsieur."</p>

<p>"I was thinking&mdash;how very beautiful the day is."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he was not thinking anything of the sort.
He was in a fever. He was thinking how very beautiful, adorable,
attractive this lovely wild creature was hanging round his neck. He
had never before adventured such an experience. He had never kissed
Lucile. Women were an unopened book to him, and lo! suddenly the
most captivating of her sex was clinging to him. He felt the
pressure of her soft brown forearm on the back of his neck. Her
little teeth were parted with smiles, and she panted gently with
the exertion of hopping. Her dark eyes searched his, and appeared
to be slightly mocking, amused, interested.</p>

<p>"If only I might pick her up and carry her," he thought, but he
did not dare to make the suggestion.</p>

<p>Once she remarked:</p>

<p>"Oh, but I am tired," and he thought she looked at him
slily.</p>

<p>The journey must have occupied half-an-hour, and she told him a
little about herself. She lived with her father. Her mother had
died when she was a baby. It was quite a small inn, frequented by
charcoal-burners and woodmen, and occasionally by visitors from
Paris. She liked the country very much, but sometimes it was
dull&mdash;oh, dull, dull, dull!</p>

<p>"Ah, it is sometimes dull, even in Paris!" sighed Monsieur
Roget.</p>

<p>"You must come and speak to my father, and take a glass of
wine," she remarked.</p>

<p>In the forecourt of the inn the father appeared.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" he exclaimed. "What is all this?"</p>

<p>He was a rubicund, heavy-jowled gentleman, who by the wheezy
exhalations coming from his chest gave the impression of being a
chronic sufferer from asthma. Diane laughed.</p>

<p>"I have been through fire and water, my dear," she said, "and
this is my deliverer."</p>

<p>She explained the whole episode to the landlord, who shook hands
with Paul, and they led the girl into a sitting-room at the back of
the caf&eacute;. Paul was somewhat diffident about entering this
private apartment, but the landlord wheezed:</p>

<p>"Come in, come in, monsieur."</p>

<p>They sat Diane down on a sofa, and the landlord pulled off her
stocking. In doing so he revealed his daughter's leg as far as the
knee. She had a very pretty leg, but the ankle was considerably
swollen.</p>

<p>"The ankle is sprained," said the landlord.</p>

<p>"Will you allow me to go and fetch a doctor?" asked Paul.</p>

<p>"It is not necessary," replied the landlord. "I know all about
sprained ankles. When I was in the army I served in the ambulance
brigade. We will just bind it up very tight with cold linen
bandages. Does it hurt, little one?"</p>

<p>"Not very&mdash;yet. It tingles. I feel that it may. Won't you
offer Monsieur&mdash;I do not know his name&mdash;some
refreshment?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Paul Roget," said that gentleman, bowing. "But please
do not consider me. The sufferer must be attended first. Later on,
I would like to be permitted to partake of a little lunch in the
inn."</p>

<p>While the landlord, whose name was Jules Courturier, was binding
up his daughter's ankle, Paul slipped out and returned to the well,
filled the pail, and brought it back to the yard of the inn.</p>

<p>"But this is extremely agreeable of you, monsieur," exclaimed
the landlord, as he came bustling through the porch. "She will do
well. I know all about sprained ankles. Oh, yes! I have had great
experience. I beg you to share a little lunch with us. We are quite
simple folk, but I think we may find you an omelette and a ragout.
Quite country people, you know; nothing elaborate."</p>

<p>The lunch was excellent, and Diane had the sofa drawn up to the
table, and in spite of the pain she must have been suffering, she
laughed and joked, and they were quite a merry party. After lunch
he helped to wheel her out into the crab-apple orchard at the back,
and he told her all about himself, his life and work, and
ambitions. He told her everything, except perhaps about Lucile. And
he felt very strange, elevated, excited.</p>

<p>When the evening came he left it till too late to catch the
train back to Paris, and the landlord lent him some things and he
stayed the night.</p>

<p>He stayed three nights, and wrote to Messrs. Manson et Cie, and
explained that he had gone to Pavane-en-Bois, and had been taken
ill. He wrote the same thing to Lucile. And during the day he
talked to Diane, and listened to the landlord. Sometimes he would
wander into the woods, but he could not bring himself to stay away
for long. He brought back armfuls of flowers, which he flung across
her lap. He touched her hands, and trembled, and at night in bed he
choked with a kind of ecstasy and regret. It was horribly
distracting. He did not know how to act. He was behaving badly to
Lucile, and dishonourably to Manson et Cie. His conscience smote
him, but the other little fiend was dancing at the back of his
mind. Nothing else seemed to matter. He was mad&mdash;madly in love
with this little dark-eyed huntress.</p>

<p>At the end of three days he returned to Paris but not till he
had promised to come back at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I will go again in August," he sighed in the train. It
was then the seventh of June.</p>

<p>On the fifteenth of June he was back again in the "Moulin d'Or."
Diane was already much better. She could hobble about alone with
the help of two sticks. She was more bewitching than ever. He
stayed three weeks, till her ankle was quite well, and they could
go for walks together in the woods. And he called her Diane, and
she called him Paul. And one day, as the sun was setting, he flung
his arms round her and gasped:</p>

<p>"Diane...Diane! I love you!"</p>

<p>And he kissed her on the lips, and her roguish eyes searched
his.</p>

<p>"Oh, you!" she murmured. "You bad boy...you!"</p>

<p>"But I love you, Diane. I want you. I can't live without you.
You must come away with me. We will get married. We will build a
world of our own. Oh, you beautiful! Tell me you love me, or I
shall go mad!"</p>

<p>She laughed that low, gurgling, silvery laugh of hers.</p>

<p>"What are you saying?" she said. "How should I know? I think you
are&mdash;a nice boy. But I cannot leave my father."</p>

<p>"My dear, he managed all the time you had to lie with your foot
up. Don't torture me! Oh, you must love me, Diane. I couldn't love
you so much if you didn't love me a little in return."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I do," she said, smiling.</p>

<p>"What is it, then, Diane?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. I do not want to marry. I want to be free, to
see the world. I am ambitious. I have been to the conservatoire at
Souboise. They say I can sing and dance. My father has spent his
savings on me."</p>

<p>"Darling, if you marry me, you shall be free. You shall do as
you like. You shall dance and sing and see the world. Everything of
mine shall be yours if only you will love me. You must, you must,
Diane!"</p>

<p>"Well...we shall see. Come; father will be anxious."</p>

<p>In July he left his <i>pension</i> and moved out to Montmartre.
He had never definitely proposed to Lucile, but his expressions of
affection had been so definite that he felt ashamed. He spent his
holiday in August at the "Moulin d'Or." And Diane promised to marry
him "one day."</p>

<p>"Diane," he said, "I will work for you. You have inspired me. I
shall go back to Paris and think of you all day, and dream of you
all night."</p>

<p>"That won't give you much time to make your fortune, my little
cabbage."</p>

<p>"Do not mock me. Where would you like to live?"</p>

<p>"In Paris, in Nice, in Rome, in Vienna. And then, one day, I
would like to creep back here and just live in the 'Moulin
d'Or.'"</p>

<p>"'The Moulin d'Or?'"</p>

<p>"Oh, we could improve it. We could build an extra wing, with a
dancing-hall, and more nice bedrooms, and a garage. We could
improve the inn, but we could not improve these beautiful hills.
Isn't that true, little friend?"</p>

<p>"Nothing could be improved where you are. You are
perfection."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>In September Diane came to Paris. She stayed with an aunt in
Parnasse, and attended a conservatoire of dancing. And every
evening Paul called on her, and took her flowers and chocolates and
trinkets. And in the daytime, when the image of Diane's face did
not interpose between his eyes and his desk, he worked hard. He
meant to work hard and become a rich man, and take Diane to Nice,
and Rome, and Vienna, and make the structural alterations to the
"Moulin d'Or."</p>

<p>In a few months' time Diane made such progress that she was
offered an engagement in the ballet at Olympia. She accepted it and
Paul was consumed with a fever of apprehension. Every night he went
to the performance, waited for her, and escorted her home. But he
disliked the atmosphere of the music-hall intensely, and the other
girls, Diane's companions&mdash;Heaven defend her!</p>

<p>And then she quarrelled with her aunt, and Paul besought her to
marry him so that he might protect her. But she prevaricated, and
in the end he took some rooms for her, and she consented to allow
him to pay for them. She lived there for several weeks alone, only
attended by an old concierge, and then she took a friend, Babette
Baroche, to share the rooms with her, and Paul still continued to
pay. Paul disliked Babette. She was a frivolous, vain, empty-headed
little <i>cocotte</i>, and no fit companion for Diane. On occasions
Paul discovered other men enjoying the hospitality of the rooms,
and they were always of an objectionable sort. And Diane got into
debt, and he lent her four hundred francs.</p>

<p>At Christmas-time she was dismissed from her engagement, and in
a pervicacious mood she promised to marry him in the spring. Paul
was delirious. Nothing was good enough for his Diane, and he
engaged a complete flat for her, with the services of an elderly
<i>bonne</i>. Diane was very grateful and loving, and in the
transition Babette was dropped. However, a few weeks after he had
signed the lease, she was offered an engagement for a tour, and
after a lengthy dispute and many tears, she had her way and
accepted it. She was away three months, and Paul was consumed with
dread, and doubt, and gloomy forebodings. On occasions he dashed
down to Lyons, or Grenoble, or wherever she happened to be, for the
week-end. And he thought that the company she was with were a very
fast lot.</p>

<p>"But, my angel," he would exclaim, "only another month or two,
and all this will be over. You will be mine for ever and ever."</p>

<p>He was still paying the rent of the flat in Paris, and it was
necessary to send Diane flowers and presents wherever she was. It
was an expensive time, particularly as, owing to Diane having had
her purse stolen just when she was paying off a debt, he had to
send her another four hundred francs. She returned at the end of
March, and so great had been her success on tour that an egregious,
oily manager named Bonnat offered her a part in a new revue. She
received a good salary, but the management would not supply her
frocks. It was necessary to dress well for this part. It was her
first real chance. She ransacked shops in the Rue de Tivoli, and
Paul accompanied her. Eventually she spent twelve hundred francs on
them, and Paul advanced the money. She only allowed him to do so on
the understanding that she paid him back by instalments out of her
salary. It is needless to say that she never did so. However, the
frocks were a great success, and Diane made a hit. She was
undoubtedly talented. She danced beautifully, and she had a gift of
imitation. She very quickly became a star, and of course a star
could not scintillate in the poky little flat she had so far
occupied. She moved to a more fashionable quarter, and occupied a
flat the rent of which was rather more than her salary alone. She
developed more expensive tastes, and nearly always kept a taxi-cab
waiting for her at stage-doors and restaurants.</p>

<p>At this time Paul began to realise that he was living
considerably above his income. It would be necessary to reduce it
by breaking into his capital. He sold some house property and paid
Diane's debts and bought her a pearl pendant.</p>

<p>"Next month she will be my wife," he thought, "and then I shall
be able more easily to curb these extravagancies."</p>

<p>But when the next month came Diane was at the height of her
success. She had been given more to do in the revue, and her
imitations were drawing the town. The management raised her salary.
Her head was completely turned.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no! dear heart," she exclaimed. "Not this month. At
the end of the season. It would be imbecile when I have all Paris
at my feet."</p>

<p>Paul begged and urged her to re-consider, but she was obdurate.
She continued the same life, only that her tastes became more and
more extravagant. And one day Paul took her to task.</p>

<p>"My angel-flower," he said, "we must not go on like this. All
the savings for our wedding are vanishing. I am eating into my
capital. We shall be ruined."</p>

<p>"But, my little love," replied Diane, "I spend so little. Why,
you should see the electric brougham Z&eacute;nie at the Folies
Berg&egrave;res has. Besides, next year, or perhaps before, they
will have to double my salary."</p>

<p>"Yes, but in the meantime&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"In the meantime your little girl shall kiss away your naughty
fears."</p>

<p>And of course Diane soon had an electric brougham of her own.
The more salary she had, the more it seemed to cost Paul. He was
receiving merely a nominal salary himself from Messrs. Manson et
Cie, where he was little more than a pupil. However, at that time
he managed to get a small increase, and invested a good bulk of his
patrimony in a rubber company that a very astute business friend
advised him about. If the shares went up considerably he might sell
out, and reimburse himself for all these inroads on his
capital.</p>

<p>In the meantime a disturbing element crept into his love affair.
A depraved young fop, the Marquis de Lavernal, appeared on the
scene. He was one of these young men who have plenty of money and
frequent stage-doors. He was introduced by Babette, whom he almost
immediately forsook for Diane. He called upon her, left more
expensive flowers and chocolates than Paul could afford, and one
day took her to Longchamps in his car.</p>

<p>Paul was furious.</p>

<p>"This man must not come here," he exclaimed. "I shall kill
him!"</p>

<p>"Oo-oh! but why? He is quite a nice boy. He is nothing to me. He
is Babette's friend."</p>

<p>"I don't trust him. I won't have him here. Do you understand,
Diane? I love you so, I am distracted when that kind of person
speaks to you!"</p>

<p>"Oo-oh!"</p>

<p>Diane promised not to see him again alone, but Paul was dubious.
The trouble was that he did not know what went on in the daytime.
In the evening he could to a certain extent protect her. But in the
daytime&mdash;that raven! that ogre! that blood-sucker! He was the
kind of man who had the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> of all theatres, both
the back and the front. He went about with parties of girls. Diane
explained that it was impossible sometimes not to meet him. He was
always with her friends.</p>

<p>At the end of July Paul had a stroke of fortune. The rubber
shares he had bought went up with a great boom, quite suddenly. He
sold out and netted a considerable sum. And then he had a brilliant
inspiration. He would tell Diane nothing of this. He had plans of
his own.</p>

<p>One day he took the train and went down to see his prospective
father-in-law at the "Moulin d'Or." The old man was wheezier than
ever, but very cordial and friendly.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, how goes it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Excellently," said Paul. "Now, father-in-law, I have a
proposition to make. Diane and I are to be married after the summer
season. It has always been her ambition to live at the 'Moulin
d'Or.' But she has spoken of improvements. I want to suggest to you
with all respect that you allow me to make those improvements. I
would like to do it without her knowing it, and then to bring her
down as a great surprise."</p>

<p>"Well, well, very agreeable, I'm sure. And why not? It would be
very charming!"</p>

<p>"I suggest building a new wing, with a dancing-hall and several
nice bedrooms, and a garage; and laying out the gardens more
suitably."</p>

<p>"Well, good! It would be very desirable, and conducive to good
business. You may rely upon me to assist you in your project,
Monsieur Paul."</p>

<p>"I am indeed grateful to you, Monsieur Couturier."</p>

<p>Paul returned to Paris in high spirits. He made plans of the
suggested alterations on the back of an envelope, in the train. The
next morning he went to an eminent firm of contractors. So feverish
was he in his demands that he persuaded them to send a manager down
that very day to take particulars and prepare the estimate. The
work was commenced the same week.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Diane had bought some expensive little dogs,
because Fleurie at the Od&eacute;on kept expensive little dogs, and
a new silver tea-service because Lucie Castille at the Moulin Rouge
had a silver tea-service. And Paul was surprised because neither of
the accounts for these luxuries was sent to him. Diane said she had
paid for them herself, but the little demons of jealousy were still
gnawing away at his heart.</p>

<p>The revue was to terminate at the end of the third week in
August, and Paul said:</p>

<p>"And then, my love, we will marry quietly in Paris, and then we
will do the grand tour. We will go to Nice, and Rome, and Vienna,
and commence our eternal honeymoon at the 'Moulin d'Or.'"</p>

<p>Diane clapped her hands.</p>

<p>"Won't that be beautiful, my beloved!" she exclaimed, and she
twined her sinuous arms around his neck. "Fancy! just you and I
alone at the dear 'Moulin d'Or'! Ah! and then we will go to Venice,
and to Munich. Good gracious! it will be soon time to think about
the frocks and trousseau!"</p>

<p>Paul's heart swelled. The trousseau! Diane was becoming serious.
There had been moments when he had doubted whether she meant to
marry him at all, but&mdash;the trousseau! Why, yes, the matter
must be attended to at once. They spent three weeks buying Diane's
trousseau. Nearly every day she thought of something fresh, some
little trifle that was quite indispensable. When the bills came in
they amounted to twenty-two thousand francs! Paul was aghast. He
had no idea it was possible to spend so much on those flimsy
fabrics. And furniture had yet to be purchased. He went to his
astute business friend again, and begged for some enticing
investment. He was recommended a Nicaraguan Company that was just
starting. They had acquired the rights of a new method of refining
oil. It was going to be a big thing. With the exception of a sum of
money to pay for the improvements at the "Moulin d'Or" Paul put
practically the whole of his capital into the Nicaraguan
Company.</p>

<p>Nearly every day he called at the contractor's, or sent frenzied
telegrams to Monsieur Couturier to inquire how the work was
progressing. At length he received a verbal promise that the whole
thing would be completed by about the twentieth of September.</p>

<p>Excellent! That would fit in admirably. It would give him a
month's honeymoon with his beautiful Diane, and then, one glorious
September evening, he would drive up the hill, and jumping out of
the car in the new drive he would be able to exclaim:</p>

<p>"Behold! Do not all your dreams come true?"</p>

<p>And Diane would fling her arms round his neck, and the old
father would come toddling out and find them in that position, and
he would probably weep, and it would all be very beautiful.</p>

<p>A few days later there was a rather distressing incident. Quite
on her own responsibility Diane ordered a suite of Louis XVI
furniture. They were fabulously expensive copies. Paul had nothing
like enough money to pay for it. He did not want to sell his
Nicaraguan shares. In fact, he had only just applied for them. He
protested vehemently:</p>

<p>"But, my dear, you ought not to have done this! It is ruinous.
We cannot afford it."</p>

<p>"But, my Carlo, one must sit down!"</p>

<p>"One need not pay fifteen thousand francs to sit down!"</p>

<p>"Oo-oh!"</p>

<p>Paul knew the evidence of approaching tears, and he endeavoured
to stem the tide. In the end he went to a money-lender and borrowed
the money at an abnormal rate of interest, and then he went to
Diane and said:</p>

<p>"My beloved, you must promise me not to spend any more money
without my consent. The consequences may be serious. My affairs are
already getting very involved. You must promise me."</p>

<p>Diane promised, and the next day drove up to his office in a
great state of excitement. Bonnat had been to see her. They wanted
to take the revue for a two months' tour to Brittany and Normandy,
commencing at Dinard on August 22nd. He had offered her dazzling
terms. She simply must go. It might be her last chance. The wedding
must be postponed till the end of October. Paul protested, and they
both became angry and cried before two other clerks in Messrs.
Manson's office. They parted without anything being settled. When
he saw her at night after the theatre, she had signed the contract.
And Paul returned to his rooms, and bit his pillow with remorse and
grief.</p>

<p>On the twenty-first of August Diane locked up her trousseau, and
the furniture, and left with the company for Dinard. And Paul wrote
to her every day, and she replied once a week, and occasionally
sent him a telegram announcing a prodigious success. Only
occasionally did he get an opportunity of going to her over a
week-end. The journeys were very long and he resented spending the
money. In only one way did he derive any satisfaction from that
tour. The building work&mdash;like all building work&mdash;could
not possibly be completed in the time specified. If they had
arrived there on the 21st September, his beautiful Diane would have
found the place all bricks and mortar and muddle. As it was, it
would be comfortably finished by the middle of October.</p>

<p>When not going to Diane he would spend Sunday with Monsieur
Couturier, who was keenly excited about the improvement to his inn.
It was going to be very good for the business. All the countryside
spoke of it. The patron of the "Colonne de Bronze," further down
the hill, was furious, and this was naturally a matter of
satisfaction to Monsieur Couturier. He was proud of and devoted to
his future son-in-law.</p>

<p>At the end of September came the great blow. Paul heard of it
first through the newspapers. The Nicaraguan Company had failed.
The refining process had proved efficient, but far more expensive
to work than any other refining process. The company was wound up,
and the shareholders received about 2 per cent on their
investments. Paul was practically ruined. He would have to pay for
the building of the "Moulin d'Or." Beyond that he had only a few
thousand francs, and he had to meet the promissory note of the
money-lenders. He wrote to Diane and confessed the whole story. She
sent him a telegram which simply said: "Courage! courage!"</p>

<p>He wore the telegram inside his shirt for three days, till it
got rather too dilapidated. Then he concentrated on his work. Yes!
he would have courage. He would build up again. Diane trusted him.
In any case, they could sell the furniture and go and live at the
"Moulin d'Or." He wrote her long letters full of his schemes. On
October the twelfth the work was completed, and he went down and
spent two days and nights with Monsieur Couturier. Diane was to
return to Paris on the fifteenth. Monsieur Couturier was full of
sympathy and courage. They talked far into the night of how they
would manage. With the increase of business assured, the inn would
no doubt support the three of them. There were great possibilities,
and Paul was young and energetic. Nothing mattered so long as his
Diane believed in him.</p>

<p>The night before he returned to Paris he went for a walk in the
woods by himself. He visualised the days to come, the walks with
Diane, the tender moments when they held each other's hands; he
could see their children toddling hand in hand through the woods,
picking flowers. In an ecstasy he rushed to a thick bush, and
picked a bunch of red berries. He would take them to Diane. They
would be the symbols of their new life. Wild flowers from their
home, not exotic town-bred things. It was all going to be
joy...joy...joy!</p>

<p>He ran back to the inn, and spent a sleepless night, dreaming of
Diane and the days and nights to come.</p>

<p>In the morning came a letter from Messrs. Manson et Cie. His
dealings with the money-lenders had been disclosed. His services
were no longer desirable.</p>

<p>Well, there it was! It would take more than that to crush him in
ecstatic mood. He would start again. He would begin by helping
Monsieur Couturier to run the inn.</p>

<p>He returned to Paris late in the evening. He would go to Diane's
flat after she had returned from the theatre. She would be a little
sleepy, and comfortable, and comforting. She would wear one of
those loose, clinging, silky things, and she would take him in her
arms, and he would let down her beautiful dark blue-black hair, and
then he would make her a coronet of the red berries. He would make
her his queen...</p>

<p>He was too agitated to dine that evening. He walked the streets
of Paris, clasping the red berries wrapped in tissue paper. He kept
thinking:</p>

<p>"Now she is resting between the acts. Now she is dancing a
<i>pas seul</i> in the second act. Now she is giving her imitation
of Yvette Guilbert. Now she is taking a call. Now the manager
speaks to her, congratulating her&mdash;curse him! Now she awaits
her cue to go on again."</p>

<p>He was infinitely patient. He restrained his wild impetus to
rush to the theatre. He hung about the streets. He meant to
stage-manage his effect with discretion. He waited some time after
the theatre was closed. Then, very slowly, he walked in the
direction of her flat. As he mounted the stairs, he began to
realise that he was very exhausted. He wished that he had not
foregone his dinner. However, after the first rapturous meeting
with Diane, he would take a glass of wine. Very quietly he slipped
the key in the lock, and let himself in. (He had always had a key
of Diane's flat, which was in effect <i>his</i> flat.) Directly he
had passed the door he heard loud sounds of laughter. He swore
inwardly. How aggravating! Diane had brought home some of her
friends! There were evidently a good many of them, from the noise
and ribaldry. In the passage were several bottles and glasses. He
crept along silently to the <i>porti&egrave;re</i> concealing the
<i>salon</i>. He could hear Diane's voice. She was speaking, and
between each sentence the company screamed with laughter. Ah! she
was entertaining them with one of her famous imitations. He stood
there and listened. He made a tiny crack in the curtain and peeped
through. Diane was doing a funny little strut, and speaking in a
peculiar way. He listened and watched for three or four minutes
before he realised the truth of what he saw and heard. And when he
did realise it, he had to exert his utmost will-power to prevent
himself from fainting.</p>

<p>The person that Diane was imitating
was&mdash;<i>himself!</i></p>

<p>The realisation seemed to be bludgeoned into him, assisted by a
round of ironic cheers. People were calling out:</p>

<p>"<i>Brava! brava! Diane</i>!"</p>

<p>He heard Babette say:</p>

<p>"Where is the little end-of-a-man?"</p>

<p>And Diane's voice reply:</p>

<p>"Oh, he is coming back soon, I believe. I forget when."</p>

<p>A man's voice&mdash;he believed it was the Marquis de
Lavernal's&mdash;exclaimed:</p>

<p>"And when is our Diane going to marry it?"</p>

<p>Diane, very emphatically:</p>

<p>"Do not distress yourself, my dear; he's lost all his
money."</p>

<p>A roar of laughter drowned conversation, and Paul groped his way
along the passage, still clutching the red berries. He reached the
door. Then he re-considered the matter. He crept back to her
bedroom. He placed the berries under the coverlet, and taking a
sheet of paper, he wrote one word on it: "Good-bye."</p>

<p>He placed this on the berries, and then stole out into the
night.</p>

<p>Paul was then twenty-two, and his life was finished. He was a
crushed and broken man. He wandered the streets of Paris all night.
He spent hours grimly watching the enticing waters of the Seine,
the friend and comforter of so many broken hearts. At dawn he
returned to his own apartment. He slept for several hours, and then
woke up in a fever. He was very ill for some weeks.</p>

<p>But one must not despair for ever. At the end of that time, he
pulled himself together, and went out and sought employment. He
eventually got a situation as a junior clerk in a wholesale stores,
and he went back to live at the old <i>pension</i> near the
Luxembourg, and he resumed his friendship with Lucille. And in two
years' time he married Lucile. And then his life began. His life
began. His life began. And lo! here was Lucile walking slowly up
the hill, arm in arm with her daughter Louise. Yes, his life
began...</p>

<p>"Ah! there you are! What did I say?" exclaimed Louise. "He's
been asleep!"</p>

<p>"And we've had such an interesting time," added Madame Roget,
panting with exertion. "We've been to the inn."</p>

<p>"And there's such a pretty girl there," continued the daughter.
"You'd fall in love with her, papa."</p>

<p>"Is she very dark?" asked Monsieur Roget.</p>

<p>"Yes; she has blue-black hair and beautiful dark eyes."</p>

<p>"Good God!"</p>

<p>"I knew he would be interested. She gave us some milk, and she
has been telling us her story. She's quite young, and she owns the
inn, although it's very hard work to run it, she says. She only has
one woman and a potman. Her mother was a famous actress, who made a
lot of money and bought the inn and improved it. She died when
Mademoiselle was fifteen."</p>

<p>"Who was her father?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I rather gather that her father was a bad lot. He
died, too."</p>

<p>"How old is she?"</p>

<p>"Not much more than twenty."</p>

<p>"Then her mother must have been thirty-nine when she died."</p>

<p>"What makes you say so?"</p>

<p>"Of course she must have been. What happened to the old
man?"</p>

<p>"What old man?"</p>

<p>"Her grandfather."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about, papa? I don't believe you're quite
awake yet."</p>

<p>"She must have had a grandfather. Everybody has a
grandfather."</p>

<p>"Well, of course. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then he must be either dead or alive."</p>

<p>"How tiresome you are! We must be going. The others are waiting
for us lower down the hill."</p>

<p>Monsieur Roget struggled to his feet, and shook the little dead
fronds of fern from his clothes, and his wife dusted him down
behind.</p>

<p>"We shall be going back past the inn," she said.</p>

<p>"The inn! Why can't we go the other way? The way we came?"</p>

<p>"Don't be so absurd. What does it matter? The others are
awaiting us."</p>

<p>They went slowly down the hill, and came in sight of the "Moulin
d'Or."</p>

<p>"Isn't it disgusting," remarked Louise, "how these speculative
builders are always spoiling these old inns?"</p>

<p>"I don't see it's spoilt," answered her father petulantly.</p>

<p>"You are ridiculous, papa! Anyone can see the inn isn't half so
nice as it was."</p>

<p>As they approached the forecourt of the inn, a girl came out
carrying a pail. She had dark eyes, blue-black hair, and a swinging
carriage. Yes, yes, there was no doubt about it. She was the spit
and image of her mother.</p>

<p>As she approached she smiled pleasantly, and said:</p>

<p>"Good evening, <i>mesdames</i>; a pleasant journey. Good
evening, monsieur."</p>

<p>The ladies returned a friendly greeting, and Monsieur Roget
suddenly turned to the girl and said:</p>

<p>"Is your grandfather alive or dead?"</p>

<p>She continued smiling, and replied:</p>

<p>"I do not remember my grandfather, monsieur."</p>

<p>No, perhaps not; it was thirty-seven years ago, and old
Couturier was an old man then. Perhaps not.</p>

<p>"Papa, can't you see she's going to the well to fetch water? Why
don't you offer to help her?"</p>

<p>"Eh? No, I'm not going. Let her fetch it herself!"</p>

<p>"Papa!"</p>

<p>They walked on in silence till well out of hearing, when Louise
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Really, papa, I can't understand you. So ungallant! It's not
like you. You ought to have offered to fetch the water for her,
even if she refused."</p>

<p>"Eh? Oh, no! I wasn't going. Very dangerous. You might fall down
and sprain your ankle. Oh, no! Or she might fall down, or
something. It's very slippery up there by the well. You're not
going to get me to do it. Let her fetch her own water. Oh, no! no,
no, no, no!"</p>

<p>"Louise, dear," remarked Madame Roget. "Let us hurry. Your
father is most queer. I always warn him, but it is no good. If he
sleeps in the afternoon he always gets an indisposition."</p>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>18. "OLD FAGS"</h2>

<p>The boys called him "Old Fags," and the reason was not far to
seek. He occupied a room in a block of tenements off Lisson Grove,
bearing the somewhat grandiloquent title of Bolingbroke Buildings,
and conspicuous among the many doubtful callings that occupied his
time was one in which he issued forth with a deplorable old canvas
sack, which, after a day's peregrination along the gutters, he
would manage to partly fill with cigar and cigarette ends. The
exact means by which he managed to convert this patiently gathered
garbage into the wherewithal to support his disreputable body
nobody took the trouble to enquire. Neither were their interests
any further aroused by the disposal of the contents of the same
sack when he returned with the gleanings of dustbins distributed
thoughtfully at intervals along certain thoroughfares by a maternal
borough council.</p>

<p>No one had ever penetrated to the inside of his room, but the
general opinion in Bolingbroke Buildings was that he managed to
live in a state of comfortable filth. And Mrs. Read, who lived in
the room opposite, No. 477, with her four children was of opinion
that "Old Fags 'ad 'oarded up a bit." He certainly never seemed to
be behind with the payment of the weekly three-and-sixpence that
entitled him to the sole enjoyment of No. 475, and when the door
was opened, among the curious blend of odours that issued forth,
that of onions and other luxuries of this sort was undeniable.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was not a popular figure in the Buildings.
Many, in fact, looked upon him as a social blot on the Bolingbroke
escutcheon. The inhabitants were mostly labourers and their wives,
charwomen and lady helps, dressmakers' assistants; and several
mechanics. There was a vague tentative effort among a great body of
them to be a little respectable, and among some even to be
clean.</p>

<p>No such uncomfortable considerations hampered the movements of
Old Fags. He was frankly and ostentatiously a social derelict. He
had no pride and no shame. He shuffled out in the morning, his
blotchy face covered with dirt and black hair, his threadbare green
clothes tattered and in rags, the toes all too visible through his
forlorn-looking boots. He was rather a large man with a fat, flabby
person and a shiny face that was over-affable and bleary through a
too constant attention to the gin bottle. He had a habit of
ceaseless talk. He talked and chuckled to himself all the time, he
talked to every one he met in an undercurrent of jeering
affability. Sometimes he would retire to his room with a gin bottle
for days together and then (the walls at Bolingbroke Buildings are
not very thick) he would be heard to talk and chuckle and snore
alternately, until the percolating atmosphere of stewed onions
heralded the fact that Old Fags was shortly on the war-path
again.</p>

<p>He would meet Mrs. Read with her children on the stairs and
would mutter, "Oh, here we are again! All these dear little
children been out for a walk, eh? Oh, these dear little children!"
and he would pat one of them gaily on the head.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Read would say: "'Ere, you keep your filthy 'ands off
my kids, you dirty old swine, or I'll catch you a swipe over the
mouth!"</p>

<p>And Old Fags would shuffle off muttering: "Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
these dear little children! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!"</p>

<p>And the boys would call after him and even throw orange peel and
other things at him, but nothing seemed to disturb the serenity of
Old Fags. Even when young Charlie Good threw a dead mouse that hit
him on the chin he only said: "Oh, these boys! these
<i>boys</i>!"</p>

<p>Quarrels, noise and bad odours were the prevailing
characteristics of Bolingbroke Buildings and Old Fags, though
contributing in some degree to the latter quality, rode serenely
through the other two in spite of multiform aggression. The
penetrating intensity of his onion stews had driven two lodgers
already from No. 476, and was again a source of aggravation to the
present holders, old Mrs. Birdle and her daughter Minnie.</p>

<p>Minnie Birdle was what was known as a "tweeny" at a house in
Hyde Park Square, but she lived at home. Her mistress&mdash;to whom
she had never spoken, being engaged by the housekeeper&mdash;was
Mrs. Bastien-Melland, a lady who owned a valuable collection of
little dogs. These little dogs somehow gave Minnie an unfathomable
sense of respectability. She loved to talk about them. She told
Mrs. Read that her mistress paid "'undreds and 'undreds of pahnds
for each of them." They were taken out every day by a groom on two
leads of five&mdash;ten highly groomed, bustling, yapping,
snapping, vicious little luxuries. Some had won prizes at dog
shows, and two men were engaged for the sole purpose of ministering
to their creature comforts.</p>

<p>The consciousness of working in a house which furnished such an
exhibition of festive cultivation brought into sharp relief the
degrading social condition of her next room neighbour.</p>

<p>Minnie hated Old Fags with a bitter hatred. She even wrote to a
firm of lawyers who represented some remote landlord and complained
of "the dirty habits of the old drunken wretch next door." But she
never received any answer to her complaint. It was known that Old
Fags had lived there for seven years and paid his rent
regularly.</p>

<p>Moreover, on one critical occasion, Mrs. Read, who had periods
of rheumatic gout, and could not work, had got into hopeless
financial straits, having reached the very limit of her borrowing
capacity, and being three weeks in arrears with her rent, Old Fags
had come over and had insisted on lending her fifteen shillings!
Mrs. Read eventually paid it back, and the knowledge of the
transaction further accentuated her animosity toward him.</p>

<p>One day Old Fags was returning from his dubious round and was
passing through Hyde Park Square with his canvas bag slung over his
back, when he ran into the cort&egrave;ge of little dogs under the
control of Meads, the groom.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" muttered Old Fags to himself. "What dear
little dogs! H'm! What dear little dogs!"</p>

<p>A minute later Minnie Birdle ran up the area steps and gave
Meads a bright smile.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Mr. Meads," she said.</p>

<p>Mr. Meads looked at her and said: "'Ullo! you off?"</p>

<p>"Yes!" she answered.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he said, "Good-night! Be good!"</p>

<p>They both sniggered and Minnie hurried down the street. Before
she reached Lisson Grove Old Fags had caught her up.</p>

<p>"I say," he said, getting into her stride. "What dear little
dogs those are! Oh, dear! what dear little dogs!"</p>

<p>Minnie turned, and when she saw him her face flushed, and she
said: "Oh, you go to hell!" with which unladylike expression she
darted across the road and was lost to sight.</p>

<p>"Oh, these women!" said Old Fags to himself, "these
<i>women</i>!"</p>

<p>It often happened after that Old Fags's business carried him in
the neighbourhood of Hyde Park Square, and he ran into the little
dogs. One day he even ventured to address Meads, and to
congratulate him on the beauty of his canine
prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, an attention that elicited a very
unsympathetic response, a response, in fact, that amounted to being
told to "clear off."</p>

<p>The incident of Old Fags running into this society was entirely
accidental. It was due in part to the fact that the way lay through
there to a tract of land in Paddington that Old Fags seemed to find
peculiarly attractive. It was a neglected strip of ground by the
railway that butted at one end on to a canal. It would have made
quite a good siding but that it seemed somehow to have been
overlooked by the railway company and to have become a dumping
ground for tins and old refuse from the houses in the neighbourhood
of Harrow Road. Old Fags would spend hours there alone with his
canvas bag.</p>

<p>When winter came on there was a great wave of what the papers
call "economic unrest." There were strikes in three great
industries, a political upheaval, and a severe "tightening of the
money market." All these misfortunes reacted on Bolingbroke
Buildings. The dwellers became even more impecunious, and
consequently more quarrelsome, more noisy and more malodorous.
Rents were all in arrears, ejections were the order of the day, and
borrowing became a tradition rather than an actuality. Want and
hunger brooded over the dejected buildings. But still Old Fags came
and went, carrying his shameless gin and permeating the passages
with his onion stews.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Birdle became bedridden and the support of room No. 476
fell on the shoulders of Minnie. The wages of a "tweeny" are not
excessive, and the way in which she managed to support herself and
her invalid mother must have excited the wonder of the other
dwellers in the building if they had not had more pressing affairs
of their own to think about. Minnie was a short, sallow little
thing, with a rather full figure, and heavy grey eyes that somehow
conveyed a sense of sleeping passion. She had a certain instinct
for dress, a knack of putting some trinket in the right place, and
of always being neat.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bastien-Melland had one day asked who she was. On being
informed, her curiosity did not prompt her to push the matter
further, and she did not speak to her, but the incident gave Minnie
a better standing in the domestic household at Hyde Park Square. It
was probably this attention that caused Meads, the head dog-groom,
to cast an eye in her direction. It is certain that he did so, and,
moreover, on a certain Thursday evening had taken her to a cinema
performance in the Edgware Road. Such attention naturally gave rise
to discussion and alas! to jealousy, for there was an under
housemaid and even a lady's maid who were not impervious to the
attentions of the good-looking groom.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Bastien-Melland went to Egypt in January she took only
three of the small dogs with her, for she could not be bothered
with the society of a groom, and three dogs were as many as her two
maids could spare time for after devoting their energies to Mrs.
Bastien-Melland's toilette. Consequently, Meads was left behind,
and was held directly responsible for seven, five Chows and two
Pekinese, or, as he expressed it, "over a thousand pounds worth of
dogs."</p>

<p>It was a position of enormous responsibility. They had to be fed
on the very best food, all carefully prepared and cooked and in
small quantities. They had to be taken for regular exercise and
washed in specially prepared condiments. Moreover, at the slightest
symptom of indisposition he was to telephone to Sir Andrew
Fossiter, the great veterinary specialist, in Hanover Square. It is
not to be wondered at that Meads became a person of considerable
standing and envy, and that little Minnie Birdle was intensely
flattered when he occasionally condescended to look in her
direction. She had been in Mrs. Bastien-Melland's service now for
seven months and the attentions of the dog-groom had not only been
a matter of general observation for some time past, but had become
a subject of reckless mirth and innuendo among the other
servants.</p>

<p>One night she was hurrying home. Her mother had been rather
worse than usual of late, and she was carrying a few scraps that
the cook had given her. It was a wretched night and she was not
feeling well herself, a mood of tired dejection possessed her. She
crossed the drab street off Lisson Grove and as she reached the
curb her eye lighted on Old Fags. He did not see her. He was
walking along the gutter patting the road occasionally with his
stick.</p>

<p>She had not spoken to him since the occasion we have mentioned.
For once he was not talking: his eyes were fixed in listless apathy
on the road. As he passed she caught the angle of his chin
silhouetted against the window of a shop. For the rest of her walk
the haunting vision of that chin beneath the drawn cheeks, and the
brooding hopelessness of those sunken eyes, kept recurring to her.
Perhaps in some remote past he had been as good to look upon as
Meads, the groom! Perhaps some one had cared for him! She tried to
push this thought from her, but some chord in her nature seemed to
have been awakened and to vibrate with an unaccountable sympathy
toward this undesirable fellow-lodger.</p>

<p>She hurried home and in the night was ill. She could not go to
Mrs. Melland's for three days and she wanted the money badly. When
she got about again she was subject to fainting fits and sickness.
On one such occasion, as she was going upstairs, at the Buildings,
she felt faint, and leant against the wall just as Old Fags was
going up. He stopped and said: "Hullo, now, what are we doing? Oh,
dear! Oh, dear!" and she said: "It's all right, old 'un." These
were the kindest words she had ever spoken to Old Fags.</p>

<p>During the next month there were strange symptoms about Minnie
Birdle that caused considerable comment, and there were occasions
when old Mrs. Birdle pulled herself together and became the active
partner and waited on Minnie. On one such occasion Old Fags came
home late and, after drawing a cork, varied his usual programme of
talking and snoring by singing in a maudlin key, and old Mrs.
Birdle came banging at his door and shrieked out: "Stop your row,
you old&mdash; . My daughter is ill. Can't you hear?" And Old Fags
came to his door and blinked at her and said: "Ill, is she? Oh,
dear! Oh, dear! Would she like some stew, eh?" And old Mrs. Birdle
said: "No, she don't want any of your muck," and bundled back. But
they did not hear any more of Old Fags that night or any other
night when Minnie came home queer.</p>

<p>Early in March Minnie got the sack from Hyde Park Square. Mrs.
Melland was still away, having decided to winter in Rome; but the
housekeeper assumed the responsibility of this action, and in
writing to Mrs. Melland justified the course she had taken by
saying that "she could not expect the other maids to work in the
same house with an unmarried girl in that condition." Mrs. Melland,
whose letter in reply was full of the serious illness of poor
little Anisette (one of the Chows), that she had suffered in Egypt
on account of a maid giving it too much rice with its boned
chicken, and how much better it had been in Rome under the
treatment of Doctor Lascati, made no special reference to the
question of Minnie Birdle, only saying that "she was so sorry if
Mrs. Bellingham was having trouble with these tiresome
servants."</p>

<p>The spring came and the summer, and the two inhabitants of Room
476 eked out their miserable existence. One day Minnie would pull
herself together and get a day's charing, and occasionally Mrs.
Birdle would struggle along to a laundry in Maida Vale where a
benevolent proprietress would pay her one shilling and threepence
to do a day's ironing, for the old lady was rather neat with her
hands. And once when things were very desperate the brother of a
nephew from Walthamstow turned up. He was a small cabinet maker by
trade, and he agreed to allow them three shillings a week "till
things righted themselves a bit." But nothing was seen of Meads,
the groom. One night Minnie was rather worse and the idea occurred
to her that she would like to send a message to him. It was right
that he should know. He had made no attempt to see her since she
had left Mrs. Melland's service. She lay awake thinking of him and
wondering how she could send a message, when she suddenly thought
of Old Fags. He had been quiet of late, whether the demand for
cigarette ends was abating and he could not afford the luxuries
that their disposal seemed to supply, or whether he was keeping
quiet for any ulterior reason she was not able to determine.</p>

<p>In the morning she sent her mother across to ask him if he would
"oblige by calling at Hyde Park Square and asking Mr. Meads if he
would oblige by calling at 476, Bolingbroke Buildings, to see Miss
Birdle." There is no record of how Old Fags delivered this message,
but it is known that that same afternoon Mr. Meads did call. He
left about three-thirty in a great state of perturbation and in a
very bad temper. He passed Old Fags on the stairs, and the only
comment he made was: "I never have any luck! God help me!" and he
did not return, although he had apparently promised to do so.</p>

<p>In a few weeks' time the position of the occupants of Room 476
became desperate. It was, in fact, a desperate time all round. Work
was scarce and money scarcer. Waves of ill-temper and depression
swept Bolingbroke Buildings. Mrs. Read had gone&mdash;heavens knows
where. Even Old Fags seemed at the end of his tether. True, he
still managed to secure his inevitable bottle, but the stews became
scarcer and less potent. All Mrs. Birdle's time and energy were
taken up in nursing Minnie, and the two somehow existed on the
money now increased to four shillings a week, which the sympathetic
cabinet maker from Walthamstow allowed them. The question of rent
was shelved. Four shillings a week for two people means ceaseless
gnawing hunger. The widow and her daughter lost pride and hope, and
further messages to Mr. Meads failed to elicit any response. The
widow became so desperate that she even asked Old Fags one night if
he could spare a little stew for her daughter who was starving. The
pungent odour of the hot food was too much for her. Old Fags came
to the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" he said. "What trouble there is! Let's see
what we can do!"</p>

<p>He messed about for some time and then took it across to them.
It was a strange concoction. Meat that it would have been difficult
to know what to ask for at the butcher's, and many bones, but the
onions seemed to pull it together. To any one starving it was good.
After that it became a sort of established thing&mdash;whenever Old
Fags <i>had</i> a stew he sent some over to the widow and daughter.
But apparently things were not doing too well in the cigarette end
trade, for the stews became more and more intermittent, and
sometimes were desperately "boney."</p>

<p>And then one night a terrible climax was reached. Old Fags was
awakened in the night by fearful screams. There was a district
nurse in the next room, and also a student from a great hospital.
No one knows how it all affected Old Fags. He went out at a very
unusual hour in the early morning, and seemed more garrulous and
meandering in his speech. He stopped the widow in the passage and
mumbled incomprehensible solicitude. Minnie was very ill for three
days, but she recovered, faced by the insoluble proposition of
feeding three mouths instead of two, and two of them requiring
enormous quantities of milk.</p>

<p>This terrible crisis brought out many good qualities in various
people. The cabinet maker sent ten shillings extra and others came
forward as though driven by some race instinct. Old Fags
disappeared for ten days after that. It was owing to an unfortunate
incident in Hyde Park when he insisted on sleeping on a flower bed
with a gin-bottle under his left arm, and on account of the
uncompromising attitude that he took up toward a policeman in the
matter. When he returned things were assuming their normal course.
Mrs. Birdle's greeting was:</p>

<p>"Ullo, old 'un, we've missed your stoos."</p>

<p>But Old Fags had undoubtedly secured a more stable position in
the eyes of the Birdles, and one day he was even allowed to see the
baby.</p>

<p>He talked to it from the door. "Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" he said.
"What a beautiful little baby! What a dear little baby! Oh, dear!
Oh, dear!"</p>

<p>The baby shrieked with unrestrained terror at sight of him, but
that night some more stew was sent in.</p>

<p>Then the autumn came on. People whose romantic instincts had
been touched at the arrival of the child gradually lost interest
and fell away. The cabinet maker from Walthamstow wrote a long
letter saying that after next week the payment of the four
shillings would have to stop. He "hoped he had been of some help in
their trouble, but that things were going on all right now. Of
course he had to think of his own family first," and so on. The
lawyers of the remote landlord, who was assiduously killing stags
in Scotland, "regretted that their client could not see his way to
allow any further delay in the matter of the payment of rent due."
The position of the Birdle family became once more desperate. Old
Mrs. Birdle had become frailer, and though Minnie could now get
about she found work difficult to obtain, owing to people's demand
for a character from the last place. Their thoughts once more
reverted to Meads, and Minnie lay in wait for him one morning as he
was taking the dogs out. There was a very trying scene ending in a
very vulgar quarrel, and Minnie came home and cried all the rest of
the day and through half the night. Old Fags's stews became scarcer
and less palatable. He, too, seemed in dire straits.</p>

<p>We now come to an incident that we are ashamed to say owes its
inception to the effect of alcohol. It was a wretched morning in
late October, bleak and foggy. The blue-grey corridors of
Bolingbroke Buildings seemed to exude damp. The strident voices of
the unkempt children quarrelling in the courtyard below permeated
the whole Buildings. The strange odour that was its characteristic
lay upon it like the foul breath of some evil god. All its
inhabitants seemed hungry, wretched and vile. Their lives of
constant protest seemed for the moment lulled to a sullen
indifference, whilst they huddled behind their gloomy doors and
listened to the rancorous railings of their offspring. The widow
Birdle and her daughter sat silently in their room. The child was
asleep. It had had its milk, and it would have to have its milk
whatever happened. The crumbs from the bread the women had had at
breakfast lay ungathered on the bare table. They were both hungry
and very desperate. There was a knock at the door, Minnie went to
it, and there stood Old Fags. He leered at them meekly and under
his arm carried a gin-bottle three parts full.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" he said. "What a dreadful day! What a
dreadful day! Will you have a little drop of gin to comfort you?
Now! What do you say?"</p>

<p>Minnie looked at her mother; in other days the door would have
been slammed in his face, but Old Fags had certainly been kind in
the matter of the stews. They asked him to sit down. Then old Mrs.
Birdle did accept "just a tiny drop" of gin, and they both
persuaded Minnie to have a little. Now neither of the women had had
food of any worth for days, and the gin went straight to their
heads. It was already in Old Fags's head firmly established. The
three immediately became garrulous. They all talked volubly and
intimately. The women railed Old Fags about his dirt, but allowed
that he had "a good 'eart." They talked longingly and lovingly
about his "stoos," and Old Fags said:</p>

<p>"Well, my dears, you shall have the finest stoo you've ever had
in your lives to-night."</p>

<p>He repeated this nine times, only each time the whole sentence
sounded like one word. Then the conversation drifted to the child,
and the hard lot of parents, and by a natural sequence to Meads,
its father. Meads was discussed with considerable bitterness, and
the constant reiteration of the threat by the women that they meant
"to 'ave the lor on 'im all right," mingled with the jeering
sophistries of Old Fags on the "genalman's behaviour," and the
impossibility of expecting "a dog-groom to be sportsman," lasted a
considerable time.</p>

<p>Old Fags talked expansively about "leaving it to him," and
somehow as he stood there with his large puffy figure looming up in
the dimly lighted room, and waving his long arms, he appeared to
the women a figure of portentous significance. He typified powers
they had not dreamt of. Under the veneer of his hide-bound
depravity Minnie seemed to detect some slow-moving force trying to
assert itself. He meandered on in a vague monologue, using terms
and expressions they did not know the meaning of. He gave the
impression of some fettered animal launching a fierce indictment
against the fact of its life. At last he took up the gin-bottle and
moved to the door and then leered round the room. "You shall have
the finest stoo you've ever had in your life to-night, my dears!"
He repeated this seven times again and then went heavily out.</p>

<p>That afternoon a very amazing fact was observed by several
inhabitants of Bolingbroke Buildings. Old Fags washed his face! He
went out about three o'clock without his sack. His face had
certainly been cleaned up and his clothes seemed in some mysterious
fashion to hold together. He went across Lisson Grove and made for
Hyde Park Square. He hung about for nearly an hour at the corner,
and then he saw a man come up the area steps of a house on the
south side and walk rapidly away. Old Fags followed him. He took a
turning sharp to the left through a mews and entered a narrow
street at the end. There he entered a deserted-looking pub, kept by
an ex-butler and his wife. He passed right through to a room at the
back and called for some beer. Before it was brought Old Fags was
seated at the next table ordering gin.</p>

<p>"Dear, oh dear! what a wretched day!" said Old Fags.</p>

<p>The groom grunted assent. But Old Fags was not to be put off by
mere indifference. He broke ground on one or two subjects that
interested the groom, one subject in particular being dog. He
seemed to have a profound knowledge of dog, and before Mr. Meads
quite realised what was happening he was trying gin in his beer at
Old Fags's expense. The groom was feeling particularly morose that
afternoon. His luck seemed out. Bookmakers had appropriated several
half-crowns that he sorely begrudged, and he had other expenses.
The beer-gin mixture comforted him, and the rambling eloquence of
the old fool who seemed disposed to be content paying for drinks
and talking, fitted in with his mood.</p>

<p>They drank and talked for a full hour, and at length got to a
subject that all men get to sooner or later if they drink and talk
long enough&mdash;the subject of woman. Mr. Meads became confiding
and philosophic. He talked of women in general and what triumphs
and adventures he had had among them in particular. But what a
trial and tribulation they had been to him in spite of all. Old
Fags winked knowingly and was splendidly comprehensive and tolerant
of Meads's peccadillos.</p>

<p>"It's all a game," said Meads. "You've got to manage 'em. There
ain't much I don't know, old bird!"</p>

<p>Then suddenly Old Fags leaned forward in the dark room and
said:</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Meads, but you ought to play the game, you know. Oh,
dear, yes!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, <i>Mister Meads</i>?" said that gentleman
sharply.</p>

<p>"Minnie Birdle, eh? you haven't mentioned Minnie Birdle yet!"
said Old Fags.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you talking about?" said Meads
drunkenly.</p>

<p>"She's starving," said Old Fags, "starving, wretched, alone with
her old mother and your child. Oh, dear! yes, it's terrible!"</p>

<p>Meads's eyes flashed with a sullen frenzy, but fear was gnawing
at his heart, and he felt more disposed to placate this mysterious
old man than to quarrel with him.</p>

<p>"I tell you I have no luck," he said after a pause. Old Fags
looked at him gloomily and ordered some more gin. When it was
brought he said:</p>

<p>"You ought to play the game, you know, Mr. Meads&mdash;after
all&mdash;luck? Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Would you rather be the woman?
Five shillings a week you know would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I'm damned if I do!" cried Meads fiercely. "It's all right
for all these women. Gawd! How do I know if it's true? Look here,
old bird, do you know I'm already done in for two five bobs a week,
eh? One up in Norfolk and the other at Enfield. Ten shillings a
week of my&mdash; money goes to these blasted women. No fear, no
more, I'm through with it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" said Old Fags, and he moved a little
further into the shadow of the room and watched the groom out of
the depths of his sunken eyes. But Meads's courage was now
fortified by the fumes of a large quantity of fiery alcohol, and he
spoke witheringly of women in general and seemed disposed to
quarrel if Old Fags disputed his right to place them in the
position that Meads considered their right and natural position.
But Old Fags gave no evidence of taking up the challenge: on the
contrary, he seemed to suddenly shift his ground. He grinned and
leered and nodded at Meads's string of coarse sophistry, and
suddenly he touched him on the arm and looked round the room and
said very confidentially:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! yes, Mr. Meads. Don't take too much to heart what I
said."</p>

<p>And then he sniffed and whispered:</p>

<p>"I could put you on to a very nice thing, Mr. Meads. I could
introduce you to a lady I know would take a fancy to you, and you
to her. Oh, dear, yes!"</p>

<p>Meads pricked up his ears like a fox-terrier and his small eyes
glittered.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said. "Are you one of those, eh, old bird? Who is
she?"</p>

<p>Old Fags took out a piece of paper and fumbled with a pencil. He
then wrote down a name and address somewhere at Shepherd's
Bush.</p>

<p>"What's a good time to call?" said Meads.</p>

<p>"Between six and seven," answered Old Fags.</p>

<p>"Oh, hell!" said Meads, "I can't do it. I've got to get back and
take the dogs out at half-past five, old bird. From half-past five
to half-past six. The missus is back, she'll kick up a hell of a
row."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" said Old Fags. "What a pity! The young
lady is going away, too!"</p>

<p>He thought for a moment, and then an idea seemed to strike
him.</p>

<p>"Look here, would you like me to meet you and take the dogs
round the park till you return?"</p>

<p>"What!" said Meads. "Trust you with a thousand pounds' worth of
dogs! Not much!"</p>

<p>"No, no, of course not, I hadn't thought of that!" said Old Fags
humbly.</p>

<p>Meads looked at him, and it is very difficult to tell what it
was about the old man that gave him a sudden feeling of complete
trust. The ingenuity of his speech, the ingratiating confidence
that a mixture of beer-gin gives, tempered by the knowledge that
famous pedigree Pekinese would be almost impossible to dispose of,
perhaps it was a combination of these motives. In any case a
riotous impulse drove him to fall in with Old Fags's suggestion,
and he made the appointment for half-past five.</p>

<hr>

<p>Evening had fallen early, and a fine rain was driving in fitful
gusts when the two met at the corner of Hyde Park. There were ten
little dogs on their lead, and Meads with a cap pulled close over
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" cried Old Fags as he approached. "What
dear little dogs! What dear little dogs!"</p>

<p>Meads handed the lead over to Old Fags, and asked more precise
instructions of the way to get to the address.</p>

<p>"What are you wearing that canvas sack inside your coat for, old
bird, eh?" asked Meads, when these instructions had been given.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear sir," said Old Fags. "If you had the asthma like I
get it, and no underclothes on these damp days! Oh, dear! Oh,
dear!"</p>

<p>He wheezed drearily and Meads gave him one or two more
exhortations about the extreme care and tact he was to observe.</p>

<p>"Be very careful with that little Chow on the left lead. 'E's
got his coat on, see? 'E's 'ad a chill and you must keep 'im on the
move. Gently, see?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Poor little chap! What's his name?" said
Old Fags.</p>

<p>"Pelleas," answered Mr. Meads.</p>

<p>"Oh, poor little Pelleas! Poor little Pelleas! Come along. You
won't be too long, Mr. Meads, will you?"</p>

<p>"You bet I won't," said the groom, and nodding he crossed the
road rapidly and mounting a Shepherd's Bush motor-bus he set out on
his journey to an address that didn't exist.</p>

<p>Old Fags ambled slowly round the Park, snuffling and talking to
the dogs. He gauged the time when Meads would be somewhere about
Queen's Road, then he ambled slowly back to the point from which he
had started. With extreme care he piloted the small army across the
high road and led them in the direction of Paddington. He drifted
with leisurely confidence through a maze of small streets. Several
people stopped and looked at the dogs, and the boys barked and
mimicked them, but nobody took the trouble to look at Old Fags. At
length he came to a district where their presence seemed more
conspicuous. Rows of squalid houses and advertisement hoardings. He
slightly increased his pace, and a very stout policeman standing
outside a funeral furnisher's glanced at him with a vague
suspicion. However, in strict accordance with an ingrained
officialism that hates to act "without instructions," he let the
cort&egrave;ge pass. Old Fags wandered through a wretched street
that seemed entirely peopled by children. Several of them came up
and followed the dogs.</p>

<p>"Dear little dogs, aren't they? Oh my, yes, dear little dogs!"
he said to the children. At last he reached a broad gloomy
thoroughfare with low irregular buildings on one side, and an
interminable length of hoardings on the other that screened a strip
of land by the railway&mdash;land that harboured a wilderness of
tins and garbage. Old Fags led the dogs along by the hoarding. It
was very dark. Three children, who had been following, tired of the
pastime, had drifted away. He went along once more. There was a gap
in a hoarding on which was notified that "Pogram's Landaulettes
could be hired for the evening at an inclusive fee of two guineas.
Telephone, 47901 Mayfair."</p>

<p>The meagre light from a street lamp thirty yards away revealed a
colossal coloured picture of a very beautiful young man and woman
stepping out of a car and entering a gorgeous restaurant, having
evidently just enjoyed the advantage of this peerless luxury. Old
Fags went on another forty yards and then returned. There was no
one in sight.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear little dogs," he said. "Oh, dear! Oh, dear! What dear
little dogs! Just through here, my pretty pets. Gently, Pelleas!
Gently, very gently! There, there, there! Oh, what dear little
dogs!"</p>

<p>He stumbled forward through the quagmire of desolation, picking
his way as though familiar with every inch of the ground, to the
further corner where it was even darker, and where the noise of
shunting freight trains drowned every other murmur of the
night.</p>

<hr>

<p>It was eight o'clock when Old Fags reached his room in
Bolingbroke Buildings carrying his heavily laden sack across his
shoulders. The child in Room 476 had been peevish and fretful all
the afternoon and the two women were lying down exhausted. They
heard Old Fags come in. He seemed very busy, banging about with
bottles and tins and alternately coughing and wheezing. But soon
the potent aroma of onions reached their nostrils and they knew he
was preparing to keep his word.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock he staggered across with a steaming saucepan of
hot stew. In contrast to the morning's conversation, which though
devoid of self-consciousness, had taken on at times an air of
moribund analysis, making little stabs at fundamental things, the
evening passed off on a note of almost joyous levity. The stew was
extremely good to the starving women, and Old Fags developed a vein
of fantastic pleasantry. He talked unceasingly, sometimes on things
they understood, sometimes on matters of which they were entirely
ignorant and sometimes he appeared to them obtuse, maudlin and
incoherent.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he brought to their room a certain light-hearted
raillery that had never visited it before. No mention was made of
Meads. The only blemish to the serenity of this bizarre supper
party was that Old Fags developed intervals of violent coughing,
intervals when he had to walk around the room and beat his chest.
These fits had the unfortunate result of waking the baby. When this
undesirable result had occurred for the fourth time Old Fags
said:</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Oh, dear! This won't do! Oh, no, this won't do. I
must go back to my hotel!" a remark that caused paroxysms of mirth
to old Mrs. Birdle.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Old Fags retired and it was then just on eleven
o'clock. The women went to bed, and all through the night Minnie
heard the old man coughing. And while he is lying in this
unfortunate condition let us follow the movements of Mr. Meads.</p>

<p>Meads jumped off the 'bus at Shepherd's Bush and hurried quickly
in the direction that Old Fags had instructed him. He asked three
people for the Pomeranian Road before an errand boy told him that
he "believed it was somewhere off Giles Avenue," but at Giles
Avenue no one seemed to know it. He retraced his steps in a very
bad temper and inquired again. Five other people had never heard of
it. So he went to a post office and a young lady in charge informed
him that there was no such road in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>He tried other roads whose names vaguely resembled it, then he
came to the conclusion that "that blamed old fool had made a silly
mistake." He took a 'bus back with a curious fear gnawing at the
pit of his stomach, a fear that he kept thrusting back; he dare not
allow himself to contemplate it. It was nearly seven-thirty when he
got back to Hyde Park and his eye quickly scanned the length of
railing near which Old Fags was to be. Immediately that he saw no
sign of him or the little dogs, a horrible feeling of physical
sickness assailed him. The whole truth flashed through his mind. He
saw the fabric of his life crumble to dust. He was conscious of
visions of past acts and misdeeds tumbling over each other in a
furious kaleidoscope.</p>

<p>The groom was terribly frightened. Mrs. Bastien-Melland would be
in at eight o'clock to dinner, and the first thing she would ask
for would be the little dogs. They were never supposed to go out
after dark, but he had been busy that afternoon and arranged to
take them out later. How was he to account for himself and their
loss? He visualized himself in a dock, and all sorts of other
horrid things coming up&mdash;a forged character, an affair in
Norfolk and another at Enfield, and a little trouble with a
bookmaker seven years ago. For he felt convinced that the dogs had
gone for ever, and Old Fags with them.</p>

<p>He cursed blindly in his soul at his foul luck and the wretched
inclination that had lured him to drink "beer-gin" with the old
thief. Forms of terrific vengeance passed through his mind, if he
should meet the old devil again. In the meantime what should he do?
He had never even thought of making Old Fags give him any sort of
address. He dared not go back to Hyde Park Square without the dogs.
He ran breathlessly up and down peering in every direction. Eight
o'clock came and there was still no sign! Suddenly he remembered
Minnie Birdle. He remembered that the old ruffian had mentioned and
seemed to know Minnie Birdle. It was a connection that he had hoped
to have wiped out of his life, but the case was desperate.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, during his desultory courtship of Minnie he
had never been to her home, but on the only occasion when he had
visited it, after the birth of the child, he had done so under the
influence of three pints of beer, and he hadn't the faintest
recollection now of the number of the block. He hurried there,
however, in feverish trepidation. Now Bolingbroke Buildings harbour
some eight hundred people, and it is a remarkable fact that
although the Birdles had lived there about a year, of the eleven
people that Meads asked not one happened to know the name. People
develop a profound sense of self-concentration in Bolingbroke
Buildings. Meads wandered up all the stairs and through the
slate-tile passages. Twice he passed their door without knowing it:
on the first occasion only five minutes after Old Fags had carried
a saucepan of steaming stew from No. 475 to No. 476.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock he gave it up. He had four shillings on him and
he adjourned to a small "pub." hard by and ordered a tankard of
ale, and, as an afterthought, three pennyworth of gin which he
mixed in it. Probably he thought that this mixture, which was so
directly responsible for the train of tragic circumstances that
encompassed him, might continue to act in some manner toward a more
desirable conclusion. It did indeed drive him to action of a sort,
for he sat there drinking and smoking Navy Cut cigarettes, and by
degrees he evolved a most engaging but impossible story of being
lured to the river by three men and chloroformed, and when he came
to, finding that the dogs and the men had gone. He drank a further
quantity of "beer-gin" and rehearsed his role in detail, and at
length brought himself to the point of facing Mrs.
Bastien-Melland...</p>

<p>It was the most terrifying ordeal of his life. The servants
frightened him for a start. They almost shrieked when they saw him
and drew back. Mrs. Bastien-Melland had left word that he was to go
to a breakfast-room in the basement directly he came in and she
would see him. There was a small dinner-party on that evening and
an agitated game of bridge. Meads had not stood on the hearthrug of
the breakfast-room two minutes before he heard the foreboding swish
of skirts, the door burst open and Mrs. Bastien-Melland stood
before him, a thing of penetrating perfumes, high-lights and
trepidation.</p>

<p>She just said "Well!" and fixed her hard bright eyes on him.
Meads launched forth into his improbable story, but he dared not
look at her. He tried to gather together the pieces of the tale he
had so carefully rehearsed in the "pub.," but he felt like some
helpless barque at the mercy of a hostile battle fleet, the
searchlights of Mrs. Melland's cruel eyes were concentrated on him,
while a flotilla of small diamonds on her heaving bosom winked and
glittered with a dangerous insolence. He was stumbling over a
phrase about the effects of chloroform when he became aware that
Mrs. Melland was not listening to the matter of his story, she was
only concerned with the manner. Her lips were set and her straining
eyes insisted on catching his. He looked full at her and caught his
breath and stopped.</p>

<p>Mrs. Melland still staring at him was moving slowly to the door.
A moment of panic seized him. He mumbled something and also moved
toward the door. Mrs. Melland was first to grip the handle. Meads
made a wild dive and seized her wrist. But Mrs. Bastien-Melland
came of a hard-riding Yorkshire family. She did not lose her head.
She struck him across the mouth with her flat hand, and as he
reeled back she opened the door and called to the servants.
Suddenly Meads remembered that the rooms had a French window onto
the garden. He pushed her clumsily against the door and sprang
across the room. He clutched wildly at the bolts while Mrs.
Melland's voice was ringing out:</p>

<p>"Catch that man! Hold him! Catch thief!"</p>

<p>But before the other servants had had time to arrive he managed
to get through the door and to pull it to after him. His hand was
bleeding with cuts from broken glass, but he leapt the wall and got
into the shadow of some shrubs three gardens away. He heard
whistles blowing and the dominant voice of Mrs. Melland directing a
hue-and-cry. He rested some moments, then panic seized him and he
laboured over another wall and found the passage of a semi-detached
house. A servant opened a door and looked out and screamed. He
struck her wildly and unreasonably on the shoulder and rushed up
some steps and got into a front garden. There was no one there and
he darted into the street and across the road.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he was lost in a labyrinth of back streets and
laughing hysterically to himself. He had two shillings and
eightpence on him. He spent fourpence of this on whisky, and then
another fourpence just before the pubs closed. He struggled vainly
to formulate some definite plan of campaign. The only point that
seemed terribly clear to him was that he must get away. He knew
Mrs. Melland only too well. She would spare no trouble in hunting
him down. She would exact the uttermost farthing. It meant gaol and
ruin. The obvious impediment to getting away was that he had no
money and no friends. He had not sufficient strength of character
to face a tramp life. He had lived too long in the society of the
pampered Pekinese. He loved comfort.</p>

<p>Out of the simmering tumult of his soul grew a very definite
passion&mdash;the passion of hate. He developed a vast, bitter,
scorching hatred for the person who had caused this ghastly climax
to his unfortunate career&mdash;Old Fags. He went over the whole
incidents of the day again, rapidly recalling every phase of Old
Fags's conversation and manner. What a blind fool he was not to
have seen through the filthy old swine's game! But what had he done
with the dogs? Sold the lot for a pound, perhaps! The idea made
Meads shiver. He slouched through the streets harbouring his
pariah-like lust.</p>

<hr>

<p>We will not attempt to record the psychological changes that
harassed the soul of Mr. Meads during the next two days and nights,
the ugly passions that stirred him and beat their wings against the
night, the tentative intuitions urging toward some vague new start,
the various compromises he made with himself, his weakness and
inconsistency that found him bereft of any quality other than the
sombre shadow of some ill-conceived revenge. We will only note that
on the evening of the day we mention he turned up at Bolingbroke
Buildings. His face was haggard and drawn, his eyes blood-shot and
his clothes tattered and muddy. His appearance and demeanour was
unfortunately not so alien to the general character of Bolingbroke
Buildings as to attract any particular attention, and he slunk like
a wolf through the dreary passages and watched the people come and
go.</p>

<p>It was at about a quarter to ten when he was going along a
passage in Block "F" that he suddenly saw Minnie Birdle come out of
one door and go into another. His small eyes glittered and he went
on tiptoe. He waited till Minnie was quite silent in her room and
then he went stealthily to Room 475. He tried the handle and it
gave. He opened the door and peered in. There was a cheap tin lamp
guttering on a box that dimly revealed a room of repulsive
wretchedness. The furniture seemed mostly to consist of bottles and
rags. But in one corner on a mattress he beheld the grinning face
of his enemy&mdash;Old Fags. Meads shut the door silently and stood
with his back to it.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said. "So here we are at last, old bird, eh!"</p>

<p>This move was apparently a supremely successful dramatic coup,
for Old Fags lay still, paralyzed with fear, no doubt.</p>

<p>"So this is our little 'ome, eh?" he continued, "where we bring
little dogs and sell 'em. What have you got to say, you
old&mdash;"</p>

<p>The groom's face blazed into a sudden accumulated fury. He
thrust his chin forward and let forth a volley of frightful and
blasting oaths. But Old Fags didn't answer; his shiny face seemed
to be intensely amused with this outburst.</p>

<p>"We got to settle our little account, old bird, see?" and the
suppressed fury of his voice denoted some physical climax. "Why the
hell don't you answer?" he suddenly shrieked, and springing forward
he lashed Old Fags across the cheek.</p>

<p>And then a terrible horror came over him. The cheek he had
struck was as cold as marble and the head fell a little impotently
to one side. Trembling, as though struck with an ague, the groom
picked up the guttering lamp and held it close to the face of Old
Fags. It was set in an impenetrable repose, the significance of
which even the groom could not misunderstand. The features were
calm and childlike, lit by a half smile of splendid tolerance that
seemed to have overridden the temporary buffets of a queer world.
Meads had no idea how long he stood there gazing horror-struck at
the face of his enemy. He only knew that he was presently conscious
that Minnie Birdle was standing by his side and as he looked at
her, her gaze was fixed on Old Fags and a tear was trickling down
either cheek.</p>

<p>"'E's dead," she said. "Old Fags is dead. 'E died this morning
of noomonyer."</p>

<p>She said this quite simply as though it was a statement that
explained the wonder of her presence. She did not look at Meads or
seem aware of him. He watched the flickering light from the lamp
illumining the underside of her chin and nostrils and her quivering
brows.</p>

<p>"'E's dead," she said again, and the statement seemed to come as
an edict of dismissal as though love and hatred and revenge had no
place in these fundamental things. Meads looked from her to the
tousled head leaning slightly to one side of the mattress and he
felt himself in the presence of forces he could not comprehend. He
put the lamp back quietly on the box and tiptoed from the room.</p>

<p>Out once more in the night, his breath came quickly and a
certain buoyancy drove him on. He dared not contemplate the terror
of that threshold upon which he had almost trodden. He only knew
that out of the surging maelstrom of irresolution some fate had
gripped him. He walked with a certain elasticity in the direction
of Millwall. There would be doss-houses and docks there and many a
good ship that glided forth to strange lands, carrying human
freight of whom few questions would be asked, for the ship wanted
them to ease her way through the regenerating seas...</p>

<p>And in the cold hours of the early dawn Minnie Birdle lay awake
listening to the rhythmic breathing of her child. And she thought
of that strange old man less terrible now in his mask of death than
when she had first known him. No one to-morrow would follow him to
his pauper's grave, and yet at one time&mdash;who knows? She dared
not speculate upon the tangled skein of this difficult life that
had brought him to this. She only knew that somehow from it she had
drawn a certain vibrant force that made her build a monster
resolution. Her child! She would be strong, she would throw her
frail body between it and the shafts of an unthinking world. She
leant across it, listening intensely, then kissed the delicate down
upon its skull, crooning with animal satisfaction at the smell of
its warm soft flesh.</p>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>19. THE KIDNAPPED "GENERAL"</h2>

<p>Jim Parker and I climbed a stile, walked a hundred yards along a
sandy road, and came out on to a glorious common. The common was
dotted with clumps of furze, gorse bushes, and beeches. Here and
there a sandy pit broke the normal level of the landscape.</p>

<p>The origin of these weekly rambles of ours had been a mutual
antipathy to golf. Paying the usual physical penalties of men who
lead sedentary lives, we had each been advised by different doctors
"to take up golf." Now golf may be an excellent game&mdash;</p>

<p>I'm not going to argue about it. We did experiment, and lost an
enormous number of balls in an incredibly short space of time, but
the insistent admonition: "Ah, old man, what you ought to do is to
play golf," got on our nerves. We met in solemn conclave, and vowed
that we would not be bullied into playing golf. Eventually we
decided to absorb the benefits of golf without undergoing the
nervous strain of chasing that absurd little white ball.</p>

<p>We rambled far afield. On this occasion we were just over the
border in Buckinghamshire. Jim Parker sighed.</p>

<p>"I wonder they haven't turned this into one of their beastly
golf courses," he said.</p>

<p>"Touch wood," I answered. "We're not across it yet." But no,
there was no golf course on this nameless common. It was a
delightful and deserted spot. We walked across it for half a mile,
when we came to a kind of dingle formed by the opening into a long,
narrow sand-pit. We were just passing it when Jim remarked:</p>

<p>"There's a queer habitation for you!"</p>

<p>I looked in the direction his stick was pointing, and beheld
half-way up the dingle an odd-looking shanty in red and white.</p>

<p>"Um," I answered. "Let's go and have a look at it."</p>

<p>We entered the dingle and approached the rustic dwelling. At
first it appeared to be a double-storeyed cabin painted rather
gaily, with pots of flowers hanging from a balcony. On closer
inspection the truth became apparent. On the lower part of the
dwelling, dim but quite perceptible, was the word "General." It was
an old converted "General" motor-bus! The owner had certainly been
rather clever about it. The wheels had either been removed or were
buried in the sand. The lower part remained practically intact,
except for a surrounding wooden platform. The upper part had been
roofed in with timber, and a balcony built out, supported by wooden
posts. The woodwork was painted white; there were chintz curtains
at the windows, and flowers in profusion in pots and tubs. A gay
little dwelling. It was, I suppose, deplorably bad manners for Jim
Parker and me to stand there and laugh. But there was something
about the association of the "General" with this obscure and
picturesque retreat that was irresistible. We were still laughing
when a man came out on to the lower platform and regarded us. He
was a tall, strongly-built man, with a neat, pointed brown beard,
close-cropped hair turning grey, cold blue eyes, and the skin of a
man who lives in the open. He bowed to us gravely, and said:</p>

<p>"Good morning, gentlemen."</p>

<p>We pulled ourselves together and responded. Then he added:</p>

<p>"I presume they have sent you from the inn to hear the story of
the kidnapped General?"</p>

<p>It was the time of day when it was pleasant to hear that there
was an inn in the offing, but we explained that we had come from
the opposite direction, and that we were merely explorers, trying
to escape from the tyranny of social custom. We had no intention of
invading his privacy, but nevertheless the story of the kidnapped
General promised an entertaining diversion.</p>

<p>"Come and sit on this bench in the shade," said the sturdy
individual. "I regret I have no liquid refreshment to offer you,
other than water. My medical advisers&mdash;" He waved his hand in
the direction of the dwelling as though the position explained
itself. We all sat down and lighted our pipes.</p>

<p>"My name is McGregor," he said quite simply&mdash;"William
McGregor, but the story of the kidnapped General circles round the
character of one Ronny Skinner&mdash;Captain Ronald Skinner of the
Royal Engineers. Skinner his name was, but the boys called him
Grinner. He was that&mdash;essentially. He was a man who grinned
through life. He grinned through triumph and through disaster. He
grinned through battle and when things went wrong. He grinned even
when he was bullied or betrayed. He was an irrepressible grinner. A
stocky, merry, jolly chunk of a man who never had any luck, except
that he always managed to escape with his life. His war record
would probably bore you, it was like so many others. He was up to
his neck in it the first week, temporarily attached to the R.F.A.
as a motor-bike despatch rider. He was a wonderful chauffeur, and
could drive any car. You may remember at that time they sent the
despatch riders out in couples, one without lights carrying the
despatches, the other lighted up as a decoy. Ronny was always the
decoy. The war had only been on for five weeks when one night a
shell blew his front wheel to pieces. He was captured by the
Germans. He spent nine months in a concentration camp at Cassel. I
believe he even grinned there. And then one day he and another man
escaped, and got across the border into Switzerland. He reported
and went back into the line. Does this bore you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all&mdash;most interesting," Jim Parker and I both
interjected.</p>

<p>"He was over a year in Belgium, and he grinned when they removed
a piece of shrapnel from the fleshy part of his thigh. 'Dashed
lucky it didn't hit the bone,' he said. He grinned when they sent
him to Salonika, and kept him hanging about for nine months in a
fever-stricken marsh, playing football and cracking lice in his
shirt. He even grinned in Gallipoli when the flood came and carried
all his kit away, and he was eaten up by savage flying things and
poisonous growing things. He didn't grin much when he really got
the fever because he was unconscious most of the time. But he
grinned when he found himself in a clean bed at Imbros. 'Golly!
this is fine!' he said, and he hurried up to get well. He wrote to
his girl in England. Did I tell you there was a girl? She was a
pretty girl, the daughter of a wealthy provision merchant living
quite near here. They were not officially engaged. He had very
little money, and he had only just started his career when the war
came. The father would not sanction it, and there was no mother. I
can't tell you what he wrote to her, or what she wrote to him. But
when her letters came he used to grin contentedly, so one assumes
the girl was staunch. They sent him off to Egypt after that for
another sixteen months and then back to Blighty. Jemini! didn't he
grin when he saw the old white cliffs again! But that wasn't for
long, mind you. In another month he was in France again.</p>

<p>"The fellow went through everything, right up to the retreat in
March, 1918, and then the turn of the tide in July. Except for that
one wound in his thigh he was never touched. When the end came he
was in the army of occupation on the Rhine, grinning at the Boche
housewives, and helping them hang out their clothes to air. And
then they demobbed him and sent him back to England. In the
meantime his father, who was an architectural sculptor, was ruined
by the war. The old man had gone bankrupt, and was living with a
married sister, not much better off than himself. There was no one
to help the boy.</p>

<p>"When the war started Ronny was nineteen. He was now nearly
twenty-five, and he had had no training. He could do nothing except
drive a car. London was flooded with unemployed ex-service men who
could drive cars. He had to get a job anyway, and he went about
grinning into all kinds of offices and warehouses. Nobody wanted
him. The war was over, and the great need now was economy and
retrenchment. The girl was still writing to him, and so he went on
grinning and hoping. But the girl's father forbade him to enter the
house. He had made a lot of money during the war, and he wasn't
going to have his daughter thrown away on a penniless, out-of-work
loafer. By God, no, he wasn't.</p>

<p>"I don't know how Skinner eventually managed to get the job he
did. Things must have been getting pretty desperate, but one day he
blossomed out into a beautiful blue uniform with white piping and
large black buttons. He was a driver on a London General motor-bus.
And there he was sitting up in his box, grinning for all he was
worth, responding to the clang of the bell, swerving through the
traffic in a most skilful way. The company recognized that he was a
good driver, and he was very popular in the yard among the other
men. One day he received quite a promotion. There was a special
motor-bus that used to leave South Hampstead at five minutes to
nine in the morning and run express to the City&mdash;no stop. They
charged a shilling per skull for the trip, and it was very popular
amongst stockbrokers and City merchants. The 'bus was always full,
and the men were allowed to smoke inside. There was an express
return journey in the evening at five-thirty. To Ronny Skinner fell
the great honour of driving this 'bus. The conductor was a man
named Eyles, and they were great pals."</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor paused and looked at us, as though anxious to check
the impression of his story on our faces. The impression apparently
satisfied him, for he proceeded.</p>

<p>"I am now coming to the amazing crisis of this affair, which,
although not kept secret, was never satisfactorily treated, or
truthfully chronicled in the Press. It is not altogether
surprising. Accounts varied, and when reported they usually
appeared so incredible that cautious sub-editors were afraid of
their papers being ridiculed. I was one of the few people who knew
the truth, and even I never knew the whole truth. I have already
told you that there was a woman in the case.</p>

<p>"Ronny Skinner drove that 'bus every day for just on four
months. Every day there was almost identically the same crowd of
men. They rushed up a few minutes before it started, with their
newspapers and despatch-cases and pipes. They scrambled for the
best seats, talked to each other or read their newspapers all the
way down. They paid their shillings to the conductor but no one
took the slightest notice of the driver. I don't think any of them
would have recognised him. The 'bus always started to the minute
and arrived to the minute. There was never a hitch or an accident
of any sort. And yet one day during the first week of July Skinner
received a week's notice. No reason was given. The notice merely
stated that his services would not be required after the following
Friday. The truth was that one of the directors of the company had
written to the manager to say that a job had got to be found for a
chauffeur who was in his employ, and whom he wanted to get rid of.
This story got round. When Ronny heard it, he grinned and said:
'Oh, well, I'll have to look out for something else. That's all!'
He'd been through the war, you see...Now, one thing which affects
this story is a letter he received a few days later. It will be
better if I don't tell you about this till later on. All that week
Ronny grinned, and grinned, and grinned. There never was such a
grin. And one night after the last trip he took Eyles out, and they
went down town and did themselves well. The morning of his last day
was a glorious summer's day, just like this, gentlemen. The 'bus
was there outside Finchley Road Station twenty minutes before its
time, with Skinner and Eyles already aboard. The stockbrokers and
City merchants began to assemble. It was a very full load, and not
only was it full inside and out, but there were five standing
up.</p>

<p>"Five minutes to nine&mdash;clang went the bell! Grrh! Grrh!
went the starter. She was off. The stockbrokers started their usual
early morning badinage, papers rustled, cigar smoke curled upwards.
Everything was delightfully as usual. The 'bus went along at its
usual pace past Swiss Cottage. A little farther on it took a
turning to the right down-hill.</p>

<p>"'How provoking!' said the manager of a chain of tea-shops. 'I
suppose the road is up.' Several of the others looked equally
provoked, but no one was unduly alarmed. At the end of a few
minutes, however, a curious sense of misgiving crept over the
company. The 'bus had taken another turning to the right and <i>was
going back in the direction from which it had come</i>!</p>

<p>"Exclamations were flying around. 'What's the matter?' 'Why is
he doing this?' 'Here, ring the bell.' Eyles was appealed to, but
he only looked bewildered. He rang the bell. No notice was taken of
it. Some of them tapped on the glass, but all they could see was
Skinner's face, grinning furiously.</p>

<p>"In five minutes' time they were nearly a mile out of their
course, and making for somewhere west of Golder's Green. The
stockbrokers and City merchants began to get seriously alarmed. It
was not only that the 'bus was out of its course, but it was being
driven recklessly. It hardly slackened pace to go round corners.
When impeded it dashed along on the wrong side of the road; it
lurched through the traffic regardless of consequences. At one
corner a policeman held up his hand to stop it, but the 'bus
swerved past him, and at the last second he succumbed to the
popular slogan of 'Safety First' and leapt out of the way. After
that the 'bus went off the beaten track. It raced along
side-streets, and was already getting out into the country. Now, I
want you to get firmly fixed in your mind's eye the picture of that
company of gentlemen being whirled away from their lawful
occasions. I could give you the details of several specific cases.
There was for instance, the chief cashier of a banking
establishment in Lombard Street. He had the keys of the strong-room
on him. It meant that the bank could do no business until he turned
up. There was a barrister who had to defend a fraudulent company
promoter at the Old Bailey at eleven o'clock. There was another man
with six hundred and fifty pounds in cash in a bag. He had to pay
off a ship's company down at Tilbury Docks at ten-thirty. The
manager of the chain of tea-shops had to meet his directors at
Cannon Street Hotel at ten, and render his annual report. There
were innumerable board meeting appointments, business appointments,
urgent affairs to be settled that morning, stocks to be disposed
of, shares bought, certainties to be acted on, not even bookmakers
to be overlooked, and here they all were rushing out into the
country captive to the bow and spear (or shall we say wheel and
lever?) of a madman!</p>

<p>"Englishmen as a rule have the reputation of taking this kind of
adventure philosophically, but there was an element of outrage
about this performance which infuriated them. Liberty of the
subject indeed! It was the sudden realisation of their utter
helplessness which led to a condition of pandemonium. All they
could do was to ring the bell furiously all the time, bang on the
window, and yell out: 'Stop! Stop!' The men on top were no better
off. They tried to get at the driver, but he is protected by a
solid canopy. They could not even see him. They began to yell out
to the passers-by, but the noise was so uproarious and confused,
the passers-by merely thought it was some picnic or excursion party
cheering, and they cheered back in response and waved their hats.
The mad thing got right away into the country. Eyles was being
bullied and badgered, but he merely continued to look bewildered
and to mutter, 'I don't know what's the matter with the chap.
<i>I</i> can't stop him.' Some of the passengers crowded the
back-board with the idea of leaping off if the 'bus slackened its
pace at all, but it never went slow enough for that. There was
nothing to do but bawl, and yell, and argue. Jagged nerves led to
internal dissensions. One man wanted to smash the window and knock
the driver over the head, and when it was pointed out to him that
such an action would almost inevitably lead to a wreck of the 'bus,
or in any case to a very bad accident, he wanted to fight his
opponents, and was only prevented from carrying out his project by
being held down on the floor.</p>

<p>"The 'bus was scheduled to carry twenty-two passengers inside
and twenty-four out. In addition to this were the five straphangers
inside, making a total of fifty-one, of whom only three were women,
one being the secretary to the editor of a financial paper, another
a clerk in the Admiralty, and the third a lady with a summons to
serve on a jury. The three women were neither better nor worse than
the forty-eight men. The behaviour of the whole crowd of them can
only be described as deplorable.</p>

<p>"I do not propose to weary you gentlemen with a detailed
chronicle of the journey. Once well out into the country, the grin
of Skinner became broader, the venomous expression of the
passengers more menacing. All their business and other appointments
had gone by the wind. They were collectively buoyed up by the
anticipation of some sort of feral vengeance. They gave up hope of
any immediate release and simply waited for the mad journey to end,
as end it must. They rushed along the country roads, up and down
hills, across commons, through little villages, scattering all
before them. They ran over three fowls, a cat, and two geese. In
one village the left mudguard struck the wheel of a milk-cart and
hurled seventeen gallons of good milk into the roadway. These were
the only tragedies of note. In other respects it was a perfectly
successful and triumphant ride, reflecting the utmost credit on the
man at the wheel. Nothing happened, I say, until they
reached&mdash;this common. Coming round the bend where you
gentlemen came, the car began gradually to slow up. When it reached
the entrance to this dingle it was travelling at rather less than
six miles an hour. Suddenly it turned, swerved to the left, raced
up the dingle, and ran nose on into the sand with a pretty
considerable bump. And there it stuck, and there it remains to this
day."</p>

<p>Parker and I uttered an exclamation of astonishment, and Mr.
McGregor paused and critically examined the stem of his pipe.</p>

<p>"And then?" I asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Hats fell off, some of the men were jerked on to the floor, but
no one was seriously hurt. When they realised that the tension was
over, they scrambled off that 'bus like madmen. In a body they
rushed round and bore down on the chauffeur. Then an unpleasant
surprise awaited them. Skinner had already dismounted. He was
standing clear of the car, with an insolent grin on his face. In
either hand he held a six-chambered revolver. As the crowd
approached, he called out: 'Stand back!'</p>

<p>"Now, a panic-stricken crowd is liable to do all kinds of
unreasonable things, but there is something about the glitter of a
shiny little revolver that will steady the most rampageous. The
stockbrokers and City merchants, armed with walking-sticks,
newspapers, and despatch-cases drew back and wavered. A
white-whiskered City accountant with heavy gold chains hanging over
his pendulous stomach bawled out: 'What the devil is the meaning of
this outrage?' Skinner called out: 'Corporal Eyles, get all these
men and women into line!' There was then another disconcerting
discovery. Eyles appeared from the rear of the 'bus also carrying a
six-chamber. He drew himself up and saluted Skinner. Skinner
acknowledged the salute, and then, turning to the crowd, he said,
'There are fifty-one of you to two of us. With a little cohesion it
would be possible for you to overcome us, but I assure you before
that happened eighteen of you gentlemen would surely die. My
friend, Corporal Eyles, who was with me during the first battle of
the Marne will now get you into line. I will then address you from
the top of the 'bus.' A more remarkable sight has surely never been
seen on an English common. One of the women became hysterical and
ran away, and she was allowed to go. The rest, under cover of
Eyles' revolver, were drawn up in two lines of twenty-five. There
they all stood, the oddest collection of sizes, and ages, and
figures, in top-hats, and bowler hats, and Trilby hats, with
newspapers tucked under their arms, holding bags and
despatch-cases, and sticks and umbrellas. And the birds were
singing overhead, just as they are to-day, gentlemen, and the bees
were humming above the gorse. And there was Skinner, still in his
driver's uniform, standing commandingly on the top of that
ridiculous red 'bus. There was a clamour of angry protest from
those fifty throats, not unmixed with jeering and even a little
laughter. It became necessary for Skinner to flash one of the
horrid little revolvers to obtain complete silence. When this
desirable condition had been obtained, he spoke in a loud, ringing
voice: 'Ladies and gentlemen, let me relieve your minds at once of
what I know is the dominant fear that possesses you. Eyles and I
have not brought you here to rob you. You shall return with all
your property intact. Our exploit is rather a spiritual than a
material one. We are doing it for your good. If we had not
kidnapped you in this way you would now all be grinding and
grubbing away in the City, making money, losing it; planning to
make it, planning to lose it; contributing nothing of any real
importance to the human commonweal. And now here you are on a
lovely common with all the day before you, and the sun above your
heads. You do not see enough of Nature, you do not learn to live,
you do not see facts as they are. You never give yourselves a
chance. Your idea of visiting Nature is to motor down to some such
place as this, and then create for yourselves a miniature arena of
all the petty, fidgeting conditions of your City lives. You stoop
over a little white ball. Isn't that the expression you use: "Keep
your eye on the ball?" I ask you, gentlemen, don't keep your eye on
the ball, but keep your eye on the stars above you. Soften your
hearts, and, when you travel, think of the people who drive you;
when you labour and profit and play, think of the people who
minister to your necessities. I have mentioned that there are fifty
of you to two of us. Well, that represents roughly the percentage
of the non-combatant element in the Great War. Have you already
forgotten that there was a great war, gentlemen? Have you already
forgotten Eyles and me? or will you forget us to-morrow? Go, then,
all of you, wander the fields and commons, and look into your
hearts. Go, and be damned to you!' And without the slightest
hesitation, he turned his revolver on to the crowd and fired
point-blank into it!</p>

<p>"The panic that ensued is indescribable. The old man with the
white whiskers leapt sideways, jumped and fell into a gorse bush,
shot through the heart. No, that is not true, but that was the
immediate impression. As a matter of fact he did fall into a gorse
bush, but that was only because he caught his foot in a rut. With a
wild yell the whole company fled helter-skelter out of the dingle
and across the common, followed by shot after shot from three
revolvers. None of them was to know that the three revolvers were
only loaded with blank cartridges. Was there ever such a sight?
Top-hats fell off and were not reclaimed, bags and sticks and
newspapers were scattered hither and thither. Someone with
experience yelled out: 'Scatter! Open out!' They <i>did</i>
scatter, they <i>did</i> open out. Younger men were racing like the
wind. Fat old gentlemen were tumbling into sand-pits. The two women
were screaming and holding on to the men. The common was dotted
with black figures, ducking, doubling, and yelling. No one turned
to look back at the assailants. No one saw the broad grin on
Skinner's face."</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor again paused, and then he remarked casually:</p>

<p>"We've shifted the position of the old 'bus a little since those
days, and removed the wheels."</p>

<p>"We?" said Parker faintly.</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor seemed hesitating how to shape the crisis of his
story.</p>

<p>"I have mentioned the letter," he continued. "I cannot tell you
the exact contents of the letter. You see, it was one of those
sacred missives&mdash;a love-letter, and not written to me. But
this I know. It came from the girl&mdash;this girl of Skinner's.
Her father had died suddenly, and forgotten to make a will. The
daughter inherited his fortune. I think there was something in it
about a special licence, something about Paris, something about the
Italian Lakes. It may seem ironic that a man of Skinner's character
should accept money left by a war profiteer. On the other hand, it
seemed not altogether unfair that this money should go back to a
man who went through it all. I think the girl must have pointed it
out to him in the letter. He grinned so happily."</p>

<p>"But what happened when the stockbrokers scattered?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Everything was so easy after that. A parcel of
clothes&mdash;two suits&mdash;was produced from beneath the front
seat of the 'bus. The two men went behind some bushes in the dingle
and changed. You see, the reason why Skinner had come to this
particular common was because the girl lived at that little
Georgian house just beyond the pine trees over there. You can't see
it from here, but it is less than ten minutes' walk away. Thither
they both went."</p>

<p>"But we are still mystified, Mr. McGregor," said Parker,
noticing that our informant seemed inclined to leave off. "How is
it that the 'bus is still here? Why are <i>you</i> living here?
What action did the passengers take? and the company? Did Skinner
get away?"</p>

<p>McGregor sighed pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Ronny Skinner is not the kind of man to go back on a pal. It
may simplify things to you, gentlemen, if I tell you that my name
is not McGregor&mdash;it is Eyles! Skinner did not have the
slightest difficulty in getting away. No one recognised in the
handsome young man who arrived at Cathay House any resemblance to
the driver of the General. They had not even got his photograph,
you see, to put in the <i>Daily Mail</i>. No one had noticed him
very much. That is the advantage of being a nonentity. There was a
half-hearted law case between the passengers and the company, but,
as I have said, the majority were only too anxious to escape the
ridicule which the case brought upon them. As for the 'bus itself,
lawyers argued about it for nearly a year. It was so damaged that
the company was not over-anxious to have it back. The local Commons
Committee tried to make them. In the end it was found that Cathay
House estate&mdash;that is to say, the girl&mdash;had certain
rights over this particular dingle. The argument went on so long
that the whole thing petered out. About a year later Skinner said
to me: 'Eyles, old boy, here is a hundred pounds. You go and make
that 'bus into a snug little retreat, and live there when you want
a change.' And Skinner allows me two hundred a year to live on, for
helping him in the exploit. And here I am!"</p>

<p>"You seem a very educated man for a corporal and a 'bus
conductor," I remarked.</p>

<p>"My experience was almost identical to that of Skinner," said
Eyles. "When the war broke out I was just leaving Charterhouse. I
joined up as a private. When it was over I was twenty-four, with no
training, and my people had all been ruined. There are lots of
others, too, in our position."</p>

<p>Parker stood up and shook himself.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Eyles," he said. "I'm sure we are much obliged to
you. It's a most amazing story, and it's delightful to know that it
has a happy ending."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Eyles. "It has a happy ending. I hope I haven't
bored you. You'll find the inn a quarter of a mile past the cross
roads."</p>

<p>We thanked him profusely and departed. The kidnapped General! It
was a most amazing story. As we tramped along the road we discussed
and dissected the details of it.</p>

<p>"There's one thing that strikes me as queer," said Parker. "He
said he was leaving Charterhouse when the war broke out. Say he was
eighteen. When the war was over he would be approximately
twenty-three, so now he should be about twenty-seven. He looks much
older."</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, "he does, but that may be partly due to the
fact of his hair going grey. A lot of men went prematurely grey
during the war. He looks very wiry and fit."</p>

<p>"Do you believe it's possible that there wasn't a lot of talk
about it in the newspapers?"</p>

<p>"There may have been some. But you know what it is&mdash;one
often reads some fantastic story of that sort, and one simply does
not believe it. It's like freak dinners and explorers' yarns. One
thinks, 'Yes, yes,' and then you turn to see who won the
semi-finals at Wimbledon. It may be true. And then there is a lot
in what he says about ridicule. The majority of people would rather
be robbed than made to look ridiculous."</p>

<hr>

<p>A little farther on we came to the inn. It was a pleasant
lime-washed building set back from the road, and called "The
Harvester." A few carters and field labourers were drinking beer in
the public bar. We entered and called for bread and cheese and
beer. The landlord, a fat, melancholy-looking man in corduroy
trousers and a slate-grey flannel shirt, insisted on our having our
repast in a little room called a "coffee-room." He seemed friendly
but not inclined to be very discursive. This may have been due to
the fact that his pulmonary organs were obviously in need of
repair. He wheezed, and gasped, and panted as he toddled hither and
thither in the prosecution of his good offices. It was late and we
were hungry, and is there anything in such circumstances so
completely satisfying as bread and cheese and good brown ale? We
munched in happy silence, both, I believe, still ruminating on the
bearded man's strange story.</p>

<p>When we had finished, we called the landlord to settle our
reckoning.</p>

<p>Having done so, and come to complete agreement with him that it
was a fine day, one of us&mdash;I think it was Parker, said:</p>

<p>"That's a queer customer you have out there, living in the
motor-'bus on the common."</p>

<p>The landlord blinked his eyes, wheezed through the contortions
of his breathing apparatus:</p>

<p>"Mr. Ormeroyd?"</p>

<p>"No," one of us answered. "Mr. Eyles, the man in the shanty
built on the remains of an old General motor-'bus."</p>

<p>The landlord's face twisted into a form that was probably the
nearest thing it ever did in the way of a smile. When in control of
his voice more, he said:</p>

<p>"Eyles? Oh, so that's what he calls himself to-day, is it?"</p>

<p>At this surprising remark we both looked at each other
questioningly. Before we had had time to frame any query, however,
the landlord added:</p>

<p>"What story did he tell you about the 'bus to-day?"</p>

<p>As briefly as possible Parker recounted the story as told to us.
When it was finished, we listened patiently to the landlord's
lungs. At the end of a few minutes the bellows appeared to give
out.</p>

<p>"Oh, so that's the story to-day is it? A good one, too. He
always tells a different story."</p>

<p>"What!" I exclaimed. "You mean to say the whole thing is made
up?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't go so far as that," said the landlord. "There is a
story right enough, but it has never been told. I've heard tell
that if the true story was ever told&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped and blinked at a small canary in a diminutive cage in
front of the window.</p>

<p>We waited for the landlord's version, but it seemed never to be
coming.</p>

<p>"Did you say that his real name is Ormeroyd?" I asked at
length.</p>

<p>"So I've heard tell," answered our host. "They say he is a very
clever fellow. He's a very nice fellow, anyway. I've nothing
against him. They say he used to be a writer before the war. You
know, story-book stuff, tales and so on&mdash;made quite a big
name, I believe, and lots of money. Now all the stories he invents
concern the old 'bus."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;why? What is the cause?"</p>

<p>"I believe there is a story that, if told, would leave the story
you heard to-day not worth mentioning. D'you remember during the
first weeks of the war they sent a whole lot of London motor-'buses
out to help transport the troops? Well, Mr. Ormeroyd was a skilful
shuvver, and he volunteered, and got the billet to drive one of
these 'buses. I don't rightly know the details. He was only out
there six weeks. There was some awful incident&mdash;I believe he
was the only one of a company saved&mdash;he on his old battered
'bus. There was a score of them 'buses, men and drivers, and all
blown to pieces. It was somewhere in Belgium. He got away back to
the lines. But&mdash;well, it's kind of&mdash;what do you call
it?&mdash;you know, got on his nerves, never thinks of anything
else. He can still invent his stories, but they always concern the
old 'bus. When they discharged him, I believe he went to one of
these dumps and bought an old battered 'bus. He says it was his. It
may be, for all we know. People up on the common there gave him
permission to build his shanty. He lives there, thinkin' and
writin'. A clever fellow, they all say."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;hasn't he any friends? Can't they make it better for
him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he's got plenty of friends. The people at the house,
for instance&mdash;you know Cathay House&mdash;they look after him.
There's a girl there. They say it is better for him to live as he
does&mdash;a kind of rest-cure. He's getting better. They say he'll
get all right in time. He's got money and his health is otherwise
middlin' good. He's a clever fellow. He'll get it all back, they
say. His stories get better you know. I've noticed it. That one
about the stockbrokers! Oh, dear! He, he, he!"</p>

<p>"There is a girl, you say?" Parker almost whispered.</p>

<p>"A very nice girl, too, the daughter of Colonel Redding, who
owns Cathay House. Why, yes. Oh, I do like that about the
stockbrokers!"</p>

<p>The landlord was still chuckling as we took our departure.</p>

<hr>

<p>When we were once more upon the road, I remarked:</p>

<p>"So this story, also, may have a happy ending, Jim."</p>

<p>"I hope so," answered Parker. "I liked that fellow. I liked the
rude things he said about golf."</p>

<p>And borrowing a match from me, he lighted his pipe; and we
continued our pilgrimage.</p>

<br>
"I got into an awful funny mood lately. You'll think I'm barmy. It
comes over me like late in the evenin when its gettin dusky. It
started I think when I was in Egypt. Nearly all us chaps who was
out there felt it a bit I think. When you was on sentry go in the
dessert at night it was so quite and missterius. You felt you
wanted to <i>know</i> things if you know what I mean. Since I've
come back and settled in the saddlery again I still feel it most
always. A kind of discontented funny feelin if you know what I
mean. Well old girl what I mean is when we're spliced up and
settled over in Tibbelsford I want to be good for you and I want to
know all about things and that. Well I'm goin to write to Mr.
Weekes whose a gentleman and who lives in a private house near the
church. They say he is a littery society and if it be so I'm on for
joinin it. You'l think I'm barmy won't you. It isn't that old dear.
Me that has always been content to do my job and draw my screw on
Saturday and that. You'l think me funny. When you've lived in the
dessert you feel how old it all is. You want something and you
don't know what it is praps its just to improve yourself and that.
Anyway there it is and I'll shall write to him. See you Sunday. So

I have spoken to him and I am quite willing to acknowledge that he
may be a very good young man in his place. But why join a literary
society? Surely we want to raise the intellectual standard of the
society, not lower it? He is absolutely ignorant. He knows nothing
at all. Our papers and discussions will be Greek to him. If you
wanted an extra hand in your stables or a jobbing gardener well and
good, but I must sincerely protest against this abuse of the

"I must tell you about a perfect scream that is happening here. You
know the Tibbelsford literary society that Pa belongs to, and also
Jimmy Weekes? Well, it's like this. Dear Old Jimmy is always doing
something eccentric. The latest thing is he has discovered a
mechanic in the leather trade with a soul! (I'm not sure I ought
not to spell it the other way). He is also an ex-soldier and was
out in the East. He seems to have become imbued with what they
called 'Eastern romanticism.' Anyway, he wanted to join the
Society, and old Weekes rushed Pa into seconding him, and they got
him through. And now a lot of the others are up in arms about
it&mdash;especially old Baldwin&mdash;you know, we call him
'Permanganate of Potash.' If you saw him you'd know why, but I
can't tell you. I have been to two of the meetings specially to
observe the mechanic with the soul. He is really quite a dear. A
thick-set, square-chinned little man with enormous hands with a
heavy silver ring on the third finger of his left, and tattoo marks
on his right wrist. He sits there with his hands spread out on his
knees and stares round at the members as though he thinks they are
a lot of lunatics. The first evening he came the paper was on 'The
influence of Erasmus on modern theology,' and the second evening
'The drama of the Restoration.' No wonder the poor soul looks
bewildered. He never says a word. How is Tiny? I was in town on
Thursday and got a duck of a hat. Do come over soon.<br>

I am sure, will make a great appeal to our members, and I feel
convinced that we are in for an illuminating and informative
evening. With regard to our little conversation on Wednesday last,
I am entirely in agreement with you with regard to the quite
inexplicable action of Weekes in introducing the 'leather mechanic'
into the society. It appears to me a quite superfluous effrontery
to put upon our members. We do not want to lose Weekes but I feel
that he ought to be asked to give some explanation of his conduct.
As you remark, it lowers the whole standard of the society. We
might as well admit agricultural labourers, burglars, grooms and
barmaids, and the derelicts of the town. I shall sound the opinion

"I hope Harrogate is having the desired effect upon you. I was
about to say that you have missed few events of any value or
interest during your absence, but I feel I must qualify that
statement. You have missed a golden moment. The great Baldwin
evening has come and gone and I deplore the fact that you were not
there. My sense of gratification, however, is not due to Ephraim
himself but to my unpopular prot&eacute;g&eacute; and white
elephant&mdash;Alfred Codling. I tell you it was glorious! Ephraim
spoke for an hour and a half, the usual thing, a dull
<i>r&eacute;chauff&eacute;e</i> of Schopenhauer and Hegel, droning
forth platitudes and half-baked sophistries. When it was finished
the chairman asked if anyone else wished to speak. To my amazement
my ex-lance-corporal rose heavily to his feet. His face was brick
red and his eyes glowed with anger. He pointed his big fingers at
Ephraim and exclaimed: 'Yes, talk, talk, talk&mdash;that's all it
is. There's nothing in it at all!' and he hobbled out of the room
(you know he was wounded in the right foot). The position, as you
may imagine, was a little trying. I did not feel in the mood to
stay and make apologies. I hurried after Codling. I caught him up
at the end of the lane. I said, 'Codling, why did you do that?' He
could not speak for a long time, then he said: 'I'm sorry, sir. It
came over me like, all of a sudden.' We walked on. At the corner by
Harvey's mill we met a girl. Her face was wet&mdash;there was a
fine rain pouring at the time. They looked at each other these two,
then she suddenly threw out her arms and buried her face on his
chest. I realised that this was no place for me and I hurried on.
The following morning I received the enclosed letter. Please return
it to me.<br>

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>21. THE FALL</h2>

<p>The city of Bordeaux is a city of broad avenues, open spaces,
big blocks of commercial buildings, narrow alleys leading down to
congested docks, great wealth, great poverty, great industry. It
has a character widely differing from any other French city.
Broadly speaking, it is a hard-working, thriving, sober place.
People do not go there for pleasure; they go there to trade.
Nevertheless as in the case of all large cities, especially when
they happen to be ports, it is watered by a continuous social flux
that is anything but hard-working, thriving or sober. It holds out
endless temptation to the adventurer, the thief and the garrotter
and the speculator. The constant inflow of ingenuous sailors,
blue-eyed and bewildered, who draw their pay and get lost in the
mazes of the west side, attract the attentions of the more
malignant characters. The caf&eacute;s and cabarets abound with
mysterious individuals, willing and anxious to introduce the
new-comer to the most delectable and special attractions.</p>

<p>On the whole, Bordeaux is neither better nor worse than her
sister cities of the South. Less sophisticated than Marseilles, she
seems somehow more independent. Further removed from the nerve
centres of France, she contrives to lead a life of her own. The
depressing <i>Landes</i> country does not get on her nerves. She
re-acts to it. And there is always Biarritz, and St. Jean de Luz
and the gay little luxury towns within easy train journey. And
there is the Spanish border and untracked regions of the
Pyrenees&mdash;easily accessible places for the lady or gentleman
who suddenly finds that the only people desirous of his or her
company are the very efficient <i>gendarmerie de Bordeaux</i>.</p>

<p>Max Renault, alias Anton Sachs, alias Jules Destourney, was one
individual who more than once found getting over the border at
Irun, disguised as an old priest, a useful means of evading the
just retribution of the law. On the second occasion he was away two
years, wandering about the north coast of Spain. During that time
his experiences must have been unenviable. He knew little Spanish
and no Basque. The people he moved amongst were mostly beggars
themselves, or poor fishing-folk, living from hand to mouth. He
begged what he could, stole what he could, but the conditions of
life were very hard. He made himself a weird instrument, a kind of
piccolo, out of a cane stem. This he played somewhat unconvincingly
outside caf&eacute;s and eating-houses; but the Spaniards and
Basques are musicians themselves, and his awards were
negligible.</p>

<p>Once he stole a donkey, drove it into the hills, and sold it to
some gypsies for a trifling sum. He travelled far afield after
that, put up at an inn and drank much brandy.</p>

<p>And that night he dreamt about falling. We all have our pet
nightmares, and Jules' pet nightmare concerned falling. It was
horrible. He never actually fell, but he was always just on the
point of falling from some great height. Sometimes he would be on
the roof of a very high building, looking down into the street
below&mdash;just losing his balance. On other occasions he would be
seated on the front row of a gallery, very, very high up in a
theatre. There was no rail in front of him. His knees were giving
way. The floor below was attracting him. Sometimes he would be
peering over the edge of an enormous precipice, lying on his face
and looking down at the rocks beneath. He would try and edge away,
but an overwhelming power drew him forward. At such moments he
would try to scream, and be unable to. After an endless struggle he
would awaken with a start, and find himself clutching the
bedclothes, making horrible noises in his chest, and his brow would
be clammy with perspiration.</p>

<p>During those two years he did many reprehensible and desperate
actions, but he always managed to escape detection. At the end of
that time he found himself one day at the little fishing village of
Fuenterrabia, looking wistfully across the bay at his beloved
France. Surely the time was ripe for return. He had changed much in
those two years. The police must have been very busy with other
fugitive gentlemen. He thought longingly of Bordeaux, with its rich
merchants and stupid sailors, its familiar caf&eacute;s and
well-cooked food. Yes, he was a desperate man. Somehow or other he
would return there.</p>

<p>Whilst gazing across the sea, he became suddenly aware of
someone approaching him. Instantly alert, and prepared for flight,
Jules turned. One glance satisfied him that the man was an English
tourist. One of those absurd, comic Englishmen, as drawn in the
French journals. Elderly, with drooping moustaches, rather fat, in
a check suit with baggy knickerbockers and stockings, and thick
brown boots. Round his shoulder was slung a leather strap with
field-glasses, and in his hand he carried a camera. The Englishman
spoke to him in broken Spanish, but he seemed to know less Spanish
than Jules. Jules replied in French, which the Englishman spoke
tolerably well. He wanted to know how far it was to Pasaques across
the hills, how long it would take to get there and what sort of
place it was. But yes, of course, Jules smiled ingratiatingly, was
he not himself a professional guide?</p>

<p>It would take perhaps two hours, two hours and a half to
Pasaques. There was no road. It could only be found by one
accustomed to the mountain path. An enchanting
place&mdash;Pasaques, where the famous Victor Hugo lived for some
time, and there was a caf&eacute; there built over the bay with
passion flowers in profusion growing over the pergola. And the
patron would draw you up oysters straight from the river bed in a
basket. An enchanting place! Why, yes, he would guide the
distinguished visitor that very afternoon and they would return in
time for the Englishman's dinner at the Hotel Miramar.
Excellent!</p>

<p>As they picked their way up the mountain path that afternoon,
Jules was constantly thinking of Bordeaux. It was a steep climb. He
was quite surprised that the fat, elderly Englishman stood it so
well. Surprised&mdash;and angry.</p>

<p>Bordeaux? He wondered whether old Madame Lachaise still kept
that little comestible establishment in the Place Duquesne. There
were friends who would never give him away. There was no one to
fear except the police. Inspector Tolozan? Curse fate! Spit on all
these comfortable people to whom everything seemed to go right.
This fat, prosperous Englishman!</p>

<p>Once on a broken plateau they passed an ox-cart laden with ferns
and a peasant in a blue blouse. They passed no one else in a two
hours' walk. They were cut right off from the world, amidst
boulders of rocks, shrubs, thick masses of fern, distant peaks,
some snow-clad.</p>

<p>"Bella vista, monsieur!" said Jules, pointing across an opening
in the hills. The Englishman leant forward and looked in the
direction Jules' stick was pointing. Bella vista, indeed! There was
a sudden quick movement, and a knife was driven clean and truly
between the Englishman's shoulder blades.</p>

<p>When the convulsions had ceased, Jules dragged the heavy body
into a thick, high clump of ferns, and calmly went through the
pockets. There were a lot of papers that annoyed him intensely,
passports, letters of credit, bills, cheque book, things denoting
wealth but quite unnegotiable. Nevertheless, Jules had little cause
to complain. There were Spanish, French and English notes. There
was a gold watch and chain, a gold cigarette-case, loose silver and
various light trifles. He flung the camera away and also the case
of field-glasses, too compromising articles to be seen
with&mdash;but stuffed the field-glasses into his breast pocket.
Then he walked on hurriedly for half a mile, crawled under a dwarf
oak-tree and counted the spoil. He rapidly added up the notes,
calculated the total in francs, allowing for the rate of exchange,
and the probable selling value of the watch and chain, etc., in his
own market. He was the sudden possessor of approximately nine
thousand francs!</p>

<p>He cleaned up his hands on some damp moss, buried the knife deep
in the earth and covered that with moss and stones, and set out for
San Sebastian.</p>

<p>Fortune at last smiled upon him. He gave no further thought to
the ridiculous Englishman, except as an inert piece of matter that
might be compromising under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>He arrived in San Sebastian after dark, weary and footsore. He
knew the town well, and he made for a humble quarter, where food
and lodging would be procurable. He ate heartily, drank good red
wine and much brandy until he fell into a heavy torpid sleep. He
had, however, taken the precaution beforehand to see that he
secured a room in the lodging with a door that locked. Fortune and
security at last! Bordeaux at last!</p>

<p>He swung out into a glorious, rose-hued dreamland of happiness,
only to find himself, after an interval of time, clinging to the
flat surface of an enormous stone column above a square. The column
seemed to be swaying in the wind. Down below tiny figures were just
perceptible on the pavement. The old horror again possessed him. He
was bound to fall&mdash;hundreds of feet&mdash;into that terrifying
void below. It did not occur to him to wonder how he had got there.
The fact that he was there was sufficient. If only the dread thing
would keep still! If only there were any means of descending!
But&mdash;no, he was on a kind of large projecting capital. The
column beneath was narrower. He peered over the edge, and saw the
narrowing flutes of the column vanishing into perspective, lost
amongst the stone base hundreds of feet below. There was nothing at
all to cling to. He was falling! He screamed, but the screams were
stifled in his throat. This way! That way! Now he was off!...Oh,
God! He was hanging over&mdash;the edge of the bed, those choked,
ugly noises coming from his chest.</p>

<p>Ah, thank God! All a dream, all a dream! He would not sleep
again that night. He sat up, drank some water, lighted the candle,
counted his wealth all over again, lay there, inert and watchful,
till the light of dawn crept between the crevices of the shabby
curtain. Then he slept quite placidly for several hours.</p>

<p>The sun was shining on San Sebastian when he went out.
Everything was normal and gay. Along the front tamarisk trees, with
their soft, feathery outlines, blended into the warm haze above the
bay. Women in black mantillas passed by him, and he did not resent
the fact that their glances were not for him. He wandered about the
town, and bought a ready-made suit, a shirt, a scarf, a new Basque
cap and some canvas shoes. Then he returned to his lodgings,
changed his clothes, paid his bill, took the old clothes away with
him tied up in a paper parcel, and walked to the station.</p>

<p>In two days' time he arrived in Bordeaux, looking like a
respectable Spanish workman. His hair had turned grey during those
two years, and he had grown a moustache and a little stubby beard.
He made his way to the Place Duquesne, crept stealthily up the
stairs of number seventeen and gave three slow taps on the door,
the last tap being louder than the first. The door was opened a few
inches, and there was a short interval of inspection, and then a
voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Name of God! It's the Jackal!"</p>

<p>He was admitted. The room was occupied by two men. One was a
thick-set, malevolent-looking, middle-aged man, with very dark eyes
and a long scar running from just below the ear to the middle of
the throat. The other was a frowsy old man, with swivel eyes,
impossible to focus. It was the younger one who had admitted him.
He turned to the elder, and said:</p>

<p>"Do you hear, Uncle Sem? It's the Jackal!"</p>

<p>The old man appeared to be searching the ceiling. He
muttered:</p>

<p>"The Jackal&mdash;eh! Where have you been, my brave Jackal, all
these years?"</p>

<p>"Over the border, Uncle Sem."</p>

<p>"What have you come back for, fool? To compromise us? Don't you
know it's the Widow for you if they catch you?"</p>

<p>"I was bored, Uncle Sem. I had to come back. I was
lonely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Imbecile!"</p>

<p>"He's all right," interjected the younger man, known as La
Tonnerre. "Look at him, uncle! His mother wouldn't know her darling
boy. The Jackal was always a good workman, Uncle Sem. How have the
dice fallen, old boy?"</p>

<p>"Badly," answered Jules. "Pigs and stones. There's not a sou to
be scratched from the vile, evil-smelling swine. Nothing came my
way, until last week, when a fool of an Englishman fell into my
mouth. See here!"</p>

<p>And he produced the field-glasses, the gold watch and chain, the
cigarette-case and the other trifles. The older man's eyes regarded
the objects obliquely.</p>

<p>"Any money?"</p>

<p>"Only a few francs."</p>

<p>"Um!" grunted Uncle Sem, suspiciously. "Travelling Englishmen
usually carry more than a few francs upon them, especially when
they boast such finery as this."</p>

<p>"Letters of credit, cheque books, if they're any good to you,
Uncle!"</p>

<p>"Um. Let's have a glance. Where's the case to the
field-glasses?"</p>

<p>"I threw it away."</p>

<p>"Imbecile! A Zeiss too."</p>

<p>Whilst the old man was examining the watch and cigarette-case,
Jules inquired of La Tonnerre concerning their mutual
acquaintances.</p>

<p>"Where is Barouche?"</p>

<p>"Barouche! He is spending a long vacation out in Cochin China.
There was an unfortunate affair with the cashier of a bank at
Bayonne. Clumsy work!"</p>

<p>"And Anton?"</p>

<p>"Dead. He died quietly one morning at dawn. The blade was too
quick for him!"</p>

<p>"Lisette?"</p>

<p>"No one has seen her since you left. She was last seen walking
on the quays looking into the water."</p>

<p>"Toni Hecht?"</p>

<p>"They have sent him back to Selesia. They did not like his
face."</p>

<p>"Gabriel Foret?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is still working. But he becomes foolish. Women and
absinthe do not agree with him. Labori died in the infirmary. There
is no one left of our old company except Uncle Sem and myself. You
are welcome, Jules. We want men of intellect and go."</p>

<p>It was not an inspiring record. Jules felt a craving to escape
from it all. He had been drawn back to Bordeaux by the nostalgia of
old associations. He liked the place, the kind of food to be
procured there, familiar places and people. But the life of crime
terrified him. It was not conscience which troubled him. It was
just the physical dread of&mdash;falling. It was in his blood that
somewhere, at some time, in the prosecution of his nefarious craft,
he would fall. The nightmare would materialise. And yet what was he
to do? About his person he had concealed eight thousand francs.
From the sale of the field-glasses, the watch and cigarette-case,
he would be lucky if he got another two hundred. This was wealth,
comfort and security for a few months. And then what? He could not
afford to go back on his only two pals.</p>

<p>The old man was saying:</p>

<p>"Here, I will see what I can do with the watch and
cigarette-case. You take these glasses, Jackal, and try your luck
on the East side. You were an idiot to have taken these out of
their case."</p>

<p>"The case isn't of much value, Uncle Sem. And it was clumsy,
with a long leather strap attachment, difficult to conceal."</p>

<p>Uncle Sem said nothing, but he blinked vacantly at the ceiling,
stood up, and shuffled towards the door.</p>

<p>"He's a marvel!" exclaimed La Tonnerre, when the old man had
gone. "He must be seventy-two, and he has never made a slip. The
police watch him like cats, and they've never sprung within a metre
of him. I believe he could cast his shadow into the face of the
sun."</p>

<p>Jules sighed. "Let's go and eat," he said. "I have a few francs,
and that vile Spanish food wants forgetting."</p>

<p>They repaired to a quiet restaurant of which the patron was a
good fellow, not too inquisitive or squeamish about his guests. And
they did themselves well. Soup, a <i>bouillabaise</i>, tripe stewed
in oil with braised Spanish onions, Rockfort and radishes, and two
bottles of good Burgundy. Oh, it was glorious to be back in
Bordeaux!</p>

<p>And Jules kept on saying to himself:</p>

<p>"I mustn't talk too much. I mustn't let on to La Tonnerre that I
have eight thousand."</p>

<p>There is a fascination about spending freely almost as
intoxicating as any alcoholic material which may be the product of
this action. Once he thought at random: "Why, I've only got to sell
those field-glasses to make enough to pay for this luncheon."</p>

<p>La Tonnerre indeed was not unduly aroused. They both belonged to
the school which taught that the great thing in life was to eat,
drink, and be merry, for to-morrow&mdash;Ah! lots of nasty,
unpleasant episodes might happen to-morrow. One might fall for
instance. Clambering about on dangerous peaks there was always that
sickening attraction&mdash;the law of gravitation. Bah! Another
glass, old boy! Glorious to be back in Bordeaux.</p>

<p>The docks were alive with dear familiar sights&mdash;stately
liners, the black hulls of old sailing ships, weather-battered
smoke-stacks of tramps. There was the delicious odour of tar, oil,
hemp, brine and the chestnut braziers on the quays. There were the
familiar figures, wharfingers in blue blouses, foreign sailors, fat
old fishwives with their booths, women selling flowers, stockings
and gingerbread, port officials fussily conscious of their gold
trimmings. This was the place to live in, to lose oneself in. No
one took any particular stock of this respectable looking man. What
was he? a mechanic of some sort? a small shopkeeper? a ship's cook?
Who cared?</p>

<p>Having parted from La Tonnerre, who stated that he had to go and
claim some "commission" that was due to him, Jules wandered
luxuriously eastward. It was early afternoon and the sun was
pleasantly hot. He walked up the Rue Fondaudege and then took two
turnings, sharp to the left, then to the left again. He came to a
narrow middle-class street of shops. Near the end of the street he
stopped in front of an establishment, which bore the name of
Fran&ccedil;ois Mossel. He entered and produced the field-glasses.
A rather bored young clerk said: "Yes, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Do you want to buy some field-glasses, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Field-glasses!" exclaimed the young man in a tone that implied
that field-glasses were the very last thing that his employer would
ever dream of buying. Nevertheless he took them in his hand and
examined them.</p>

<p>"Where is the case?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The case is lost!"</p>

<p>The young man's face expressed bored indignation. However, he
disappeared behind a wooden partition with the glasses. In two or
three minutes an elderly Jew came in with the young man. He was
wearing thick spectacles and a black skull cap. He looked hard at
Jules and said:</p>

<p>"Where did you get these glasses from?"</p>

<p>"They belonged to my brother, monsieur, who died."</p>

<p>The Jew looked closely at Jules' face, his clothes, his shoes
and his cap. He made no attempt to conceal his suspicion.</p>

<p>"Where is the case?"</p>

<p>"There wasn't a case. My brother must have lost it,
monsieur."</p>

<p>"When did your brother die?"</p>

<p>"Last year, monsieur."</p>

<p>"This is a pair of new Zeiss field-glasses."</p>

<p>Jules flushed. What the devil business was it of the Jew when or
where his brother died? Why didn't he hurry up and give him the
money! Monsieur Mossel seemed to be meditating. He muttered to
himself:</p>

<p>"Curious...a new pair of Zeiss field-glasses without a
case."</p>

<p>Looking at Jules once more, he said in a melancholy voice:</p>

<p>"How much do you want for them?"</p>

<p>"Four hundred francs, monsieur."</p>

<p>The old Jew turned to his assistant with an expression clearly
conveying the fact that he had long since given up being surprised
at the insolent and extortionate demands made to him in his
profession. He turned the glasses over and over and examined them
more thoroughly. At last he said:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you twenty-seven francs
for them."</p>

<p>It was Jules' turn to express clearly that he had given up being
surprised at the preposterous offers one was to expect from these
money-lenders. He answered without hesitation:</p>

<p>"One hundred."</p>

<p>"Twenty-eight."</p>

<p>What was the use? He felt a wild desire to be rid of the whole
transaction. The atmosphere of this poky, furtive office frightened
him. He mumbled:</p>

<p>"Oh!...well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leave the glasses here and come in later at half-past five, and
you shall have the money. You must sign a written declaration."</p>

<p>Why? He didn't like this aspect of it at all. But something told
him to clear out of that place at the earliest possible moment. A
few minutes later he was thankful for this subconscious warning. He
had just crossed the street when he saw an elderly
distinguished-looking man turn the corner and saunter casually into
Mons. Mossel's shop. It was the last person in Bordeaux he was
desirous of meeting&mdash;Inspector Tolozan, chief of the
<i>gendarmerie de Bordeaux</i>.</p>

<p>He never went back for his twenty-eight francs. On the other
hand, he could not bring himself to tell the true story to Uncle
Sem and La Tonnerre. He said he had sold the glasses for ninety
francs, and he shared the spoil with them loyally. Uncle Sem
declared that he was only able to raise two hundred and forty
francs on the watch and cigarette-case. This was also divided.</p>

<p>Jules slept in an attic in the same house in the Place Duquesne
where his two companions resided. He continued to lead a life of
indolence and luxury.</p>

<p>At the end of a few weeks, however, he began to realize that
there was something queer happening to him. His health was not all
that could be desired. The fact was, that the sudden spasm of
luxurious living, after the two years of semi-starvation, was
seriously affecting his digestion. He suffered from attacks of
vertigo. Lying in his attic at night, he would have an abrupt
vision of the courtyard below. Some power seemed to compel him to
get out of bed and go to the window and look down. He would stand
there, clutching the window frame, his face bathed in cold sweat.
The terror was unendurable. After two or three of these experiences
he gave up the attic. He managed to secure a dingy room in the
basement of the house next door.</p>

<p>So far as the prosecution of his criminal practices was
concerned, he was entirely inactive. He had lost his nerve. He made
up elaborate stories to Uncle Sem and La Tonnerre of exploits about
purse-snatching and confidence tricks. He even handed them the
money as a share of the spoils, anything to buy peace. His small
fortune would not last long at this rate.</p>

<p>Once he dreamt he was on top of a lighthouse, out at sea. A high
wind was blowing, and he was clutching his few remaining notes and
trying to hang on to the smooth stone surface. A sudden, fiercer
gust came and carried the notes away. He looked over the edge, and
saw the notes fluttering on the surface of an angry sea, a hundred
feet below him. Again he tried to scream...</p>

<p>It was Uncle Sem's discovery&mdash;the fat Dutch ship-master,
who went nightly to a little caf&eacute; in the Rue Muyens and got
drunk. He appeared to have money. It was believed that he had on
his person the cash to pay off a ship's company that was expected
from Rio.</p>

<p>"Here is a neat little game we might play together," said Uncle
Sem.</p>

<p>Jules shivered, but he knew there was no escape. They couldn't
understand, these two; they couldn't understand this fear of
falling. On a certain night he found himself entering the
Caf&eacute; des Etoiles. Uncle Sem was whispering:</p>

<p>"This is the table."</p>

<p>They sat down, and ordered two anisettes. Uncle Sem was very
garrulous. After a little while the fat Dutchman entered. He
glowered at them, but took his usual corner seat, and ordered
Schnappes. Uncle Sem bowed to him very politely, and continued to
talk to Jules. After a few more glasses of Schnappes it was not
difficult to engage the Dutchman in conversation, in spite of his
villainous French. They discussed all kinds of subjects, and Uncle
Sem was most entertaining and hospitable, ordering innumerable
rounds of drinks. It was getting late, when La Tonnerre entered the
caf&eacute;. He was very smartly dressed. He looked round the room,
then, approaching Uncle Sem, he said diffidently:</p>

<p>"May I occupy this seat, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"But certainly," replied Uncle Sem.</p>

<p>In a few minutes La Tonnerre was drawn into the conversation,
and somehow or other it got round to the Dutch East Indies. La
Tonnerre said that he had often touched at Sumatra, when a
seafaring man. Curiously enough, Uncle Sem, according to his own
account, had once been manager of a tea plantation at Tebing
Tinggi. Helped by a nudge, Jules said he knew all the islands
intimately. This might have been all very well, except for the fact
that Uncle Sem referred to Tebing Tinggi as being on the north-east
coast of Sumatra.</p>

<p>"Tebing Tinggi!" exclaimed the Dutchman. "Why, it is in the
interior, one hundred and thirty miles west of Pelembeng!"</p>

<p>It is invariably about insignificant trifles that men lose their
tempers. The argument became heated.</p>

<p>"Considering I lived there for two years!" cried the Dutchman,
banging his fist down on the table.</p>

<p>Uncle Sem was equally emphatic and so was La Tonnerre, who
insisted that Tebing Tinggi was in the north. The argument became
more and more acrimonious. At last Uncle Sem said:</p>

<p>"I tell you what, gentlemen. I'm willing to bet. I suggest we
put up a hundred francs each. We all put the notes right down here
on the table. Then we each in turn draw a plan of the island,
indicating the position of Tebing Tinggi. That being done, we
borrow our patron's atlas. I know he has one. And we compare. The
one who has drawn the most accurate plan gets the lot."</p>

<p>"Done!" roared the Dutchman. "On one condition."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"That we make it two hundred francs."</p>

<p>"I agree," said Uncle Sem.</p>

<p>"Agreed," said La Tonnerre.</p>

<p>"Yes, I agree also," said Jules faintly.</p>

<p>The Dutchman produced a fat pocket-book. He took out two hundred
francs and put the notes down on the table. The others followed
suit. They drew lots for the order of performance. La Tonnerre drew
the first plan. He picked up a menu card and carefully drew a plan
of the island on the back, indicating the position of the disputed
town. The Dutchman, who had drawn second place, snorted with
contempt and was in a fever to get to work. Directly La Tonnerre
had finished, he snatched up the pencil and pored over the back of
another menu card. Very laboriously, with the tip of his fat tongue
pouting between his lips, he made a careful and exact plan of the
island. When he was half way through, La Tonnerre rose and
said:</p>

<p>"I'll get the atlas in the meantime."</p>

<p>He got up and walked out. The Dutchman had nearly finished his
drawing, when Uncle Sem exclaimed:</p>

<p>"My God!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" growled the Dutchman.</p>

<p>"The notes! the notes! That fellow has taken the notes!"</p>

<p>The Dutchman's eyes bulged. He glared round the table, gasped,
put his hand in his breast pocket.</p>

<p>"God in Heaven!" he wailed. "My pocket-book my pocket-book!
Which way did he go?"</p>

<p>"Good God! he's taken my pocket-book too!" said Uncle Sem.
"Curse him! the thief! the dirty thief! I believe he went out this
way."</p>

<p>And he jumped up and dashed to the door. The Dutchman dashed
after him. Jules was left alone. The thing had happened so quickly
that the other occupants of the caf&eacute; had not time to take it
all in. Besides, in that part of the world they are accustomed to
quarrelling and gambling among seafaring men. It is advisable
sometimes not to be too curious. A waiter came up to Jules and
said:</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"That stranger who came in went off with my pal's notes," he
replied.</p>

<p>The waiter shrugged his shoulders. Jules got up to follow the
others. Just as he rose his eye was attracted by a face on the
other side of the room. It seemed vaguely familiar. It was the face
of a young man, talking to a girl. What was disturbing was that the
young man was staring at him and quite patently talking to the girl
about him. As he reached the door, he remembered in a flash that it
was the young clerk to the Jew who had bought the field-glasses.
Once through the door, Jules ran as fast as he could until he had
put several abrupt turnings between himself and that sinister
caf&eacute;. He was terribly frightened. His heart was beating
against his ribs. The appearance of the young clerk from the
pawnbroker's shop seemed to be a portentous climax to the sordid
adventure. He must keep clear of that side of the river for some
time. He went a long way round, and avoiding the Pont de Bordeaux,
crossed the river by the railway bridge. His teeth were chattering
when he rejoined the other two in that crazy room in the Place
Duquesne. He found Uncle Sem feeding a fat moulting canary with
lumps of sugar, and calling it endearing names.</p>

<p>La Tonnerre was stretched luxuriously on an old couch, eating
sardines out of a tin. The evening had been a great success. The
Dutchman's wallet had contained seven thousand three hundred
francs.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said La Tonnerre, "Uncle Sem thinks a little
change of scenery might do us all good. Scatter, Uncle, eh? Wait
till the Dutch pig has had to return to his greasy country. I'm for
the South, I. I know a pair of dark eyes at St. Jean de Luz that
always welcome me, especially when I can slap my pockets, and throw
a franc or two round at random."</p>

<p>"I have an urgent affair to attend to in Paris, my children,"
said Uncle Sem. "Some dear relations I must visit. They miss me
dreadfully."</p>

<p>One eye appeared to be on the door, whilst the other was
searching the opposite curtain-pole. "Tweet! tweet! There's a
little darling! Tweet! tweet!"</p>

<p>Jules sat morosely apart. Where should he go? What should he
do?</p>

<p>"Wherever I go I know that&mdash;the fall is not far off," he
thought. The fall! He was high up now, and there was that courtyard
down below. Oh!...He stood up and pretended to yawn carelessly.</p>

<p>"I shall stay in Bordeaux," he said, and stumbled towards the
door.</p>

<p>"Imbecile!" hissed Uncle Sem, and then he appeared to chuckle
with malevolent glee. "Tweet! tweet! There's a dear little bird for
you!"</p>

<p>It was coming nearer. Ice-cold hands were clutching at his ribs,
drawing him up, preparing to hurl him down.</p>

<p>Three days had elapsed since Uncle Sem and La Tonnerre vanished
from Bordeaux. His pockets were well-lined with notes and silver.
He drifted from restaurant to restaurant, from caf&eacute; to
caf&eacute;, consuming quantities of rich food and wines, which
gave him no satisfaction. The richer the repast the more violent
the reaction. That morning he had seen the young clerk again with
the same girl. They were going out of a caf&eacute; where he was
seated. He thought the girl looked at him, but he could not be
certain. He felt too apathetic to leave. He sat there drinking
absinthe, and watching the door. He was waiting.</p>

<p>But no one came, and after a while he went out. All the
afternoon he wandered about the docks. The familiar scenes had lost
their attraction. He felt impatient for the crisis. This could not
go on indefinitely. It was now early evening. He was seated at
another caf&eacute; in the Rue Maille. The hour when one dines. But
no, he had no desire for food. Even the sight of a glass of
absinthe nauseated him. The thing was too near.</p>

<p>The caf&eacute; was dimly lighted and almost deserted. He was
still watching the door. A few seafaring men passed in and out.
Soon it would be quite dark. Why didn't they light up the
caf&eacute;? Lights...</p>

<p>Two sturdily-built men entered together. One had a paper in his
hand. They glanced round, whispered, and came up to him. The one
with the paper said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Max Renault, alias Anton Sachs, alias Jules
Destourney?"</p>

<p>Jules did not answer. He lay in a heap, staring at the
well-filled glass.</p>

<p>"We hold here a warrant for your arrest."</p>

<p>Well, what was it? The Dutchman, or&mdash;?</p>

<p>"You are arrested on an extradition warrant from the Spanish
Government, charged with the murder of an Englishman, John Watson,
five kilos from Fuenterrabia, on the afternoon of the 17th August.
Have you anything to say? Anything you will say&mdash;"</p>

<p>The scream came at last. There were none of the choked gaspings
of a dream. The fuddled mists cleared away. He experienced a moment
crowded with the pellucid vision of the onrush of a huge steel
knife! It had come&mdash;the ghastly end. Then the room swung into
darkness, filled with shouts and screams&mdash;his own. Followed a
period of impenetrable blackness, discomfort, and terror.
Frightened to focus...But it came at last. Where was this? Where
was it? He was lying in a bed. A dim light at the other end of the
room revealed other beds&mdash;five of them. A figure in blue was
walking by, clanking a bunch of keys. The air seemed to be filled
with a pornographic roar. Snoring. The other five beds seemed to be
occupied by men determined to snore their way to hell. His heart
was still behaving queerly, but bit by bit the true position was
dawning on him. A gaoler! This must be the prison infirmary. They
had him at last. How did they discover it all? Vultures! The
Englishman, John Watson, an inert piece of matter! The
field-glasses.</p>

<p>"Why did you throw the case away? Imbecile!"</p>

<p>Where was Uncle Sem? Why wasn't <i>he</i> here? He deserved
everything and always escaped. Liar, thief, seducer, murderer,
property receiver..."Tweet! Tweet!"</p>

<p>What a satisfaction to wring that fat canary's neck! Crush it
under foot! Where was La Tonnerre?</p>

<p>But they <i>had</i> him. That was the fact to be
faced&mdash;they had him at last, Jules Destourney. The Englishman,
John Watson? Ah, God, if he were the only one! The long relentless
arm of the police, the cold, relentless logic of the courts, the
calm, inevitable chain of evidence prepared by Inspector Tolozan,
who had been watching him for years&mdash;what chance had he to
stand against it? It couldn't be faced. Something must be done.
Some exit must be found. He lay there, with eyes half-closed. A
figure in a white overall passed through, other figures, vaguely
occupied.</p>

<p>It must be the middle of the night. The man in blue clanked by
once more. He went to the end of the room, and talked with someone
behind a screen. The door had been left ajar. Yes, there was one
thing he could do. Escape!</p>

<p>He slipped out of bed, and was surprised at the ease and silence
with which he glided through that door...like a ghost. In a flash
he was along that corridor, and turned down two others. The place
was all in darkness.</p>

<p>Here and there were piled-up trestles, and planks and short
ladders. Pails of size and lime-wash were lined along the wall.
This must be one of the Superintendent's quarters, being
re-decorated. Without any hesitancy, he opened a door and entered a
room. It was bare, except for more planks and trestles and
lime-wash. The room was lighted by the light of the moon. He crept
to the window. His heart beat violently. The window was not barred.
Across a narrow alleyway was a low stone building, all in darkness.
It must have been the Governor's house. This room was level with
the roof. On one side of the building was an iron spiral
staircase&mdash;a fire emergency staircase. This led to the
Governor's private grounds. As far as he could see on the farther
side was a wall not too high to scale.</p>

<p>But now, this alleyway between the room and the roof opposite?
It could be little more than three metres to the stone parapet. He
quickly calculated the length of the painters' planks. One was at
least three metres and a half, or four.</p>

<p>Someone would be coming! He listened at the door. There was no
lock. It had got to be done boldly. He gripped the plank and thrust
it through the open window. Good God, it barely reached! He could
not see how far on it was, but not more than the length of his
first finger, he could swear.</p>

<p>It had got to be done. No time to lose. Again he was surprised
at his own agility and nerve. He slipped quickly from the
window-sill on to the plank. Crawl slowly across on hands and
knees, that was the idea. He almost chuckled to himself as he swung
carefully forward.</p>

<p>"They won't get me! They shan't get me!"</p>

<p>He had gone a metre and a half, and then he looked down on to
the stone floor of the alley beneath.</p>

<p>In that brief instant he realized that he had reached the
culminating terror of his life. It was predestination. This was no
dream. <i>He was going to fall!</i> He lay there, completely
paralysed with the certain knowledge of what was to happen. He was
actively visualizing the whole experience. He was half-way across,
and he could go neither backwards nor forwards. The ground beneath
held him pinioned. The stone floor seemed to be sucking him towards
it. He shook with an ague of terror, and at the same instant the
plank seemed to be imperceptibly moving, as though he were rocking
one end off its support. If anyone came they could not save him.
Nothing could save him. <i>He was going to fall!</i></p>

<p>He wanted to scream again, as in his dreams, but, curiously
enough, the sounds were throttled in his breast in just the same
way. And then the plank distinctly swayed. He fell forward on his
face and clutched it. It turned up on one side. He flung his arms
round it, and fell free, hanging by its narrow edge. And still he
could not scream.</p>

<p>During the horrific instant that followed when he realized that
his strength was feebler than the suction of the ground beneath, he
was still perplexed with the problem of why it was he could not
scream.</p>

<p>The plank slipped from its support on the wall opposite at the
same moment that he lost his grip. His body seemed to drop and
leave his heart where it had been, and his hands clutching the air.
Some part of him was racing madly through space, and the ground was
rushing up to strike the heart which he had left above him. His
consciousness seemed to split up into a variety of vital
activities. There was something rushing through his ears, like the
roaring of a steam engine going through a tunnel. <i>He was
falling!</i></p>

<p>There was a sudden whirling vision of his mother stepping off
the gangway of a boat and saying: "Come on, my little one. Are you
tired then?" There was a hiss of water, the vision of a girl he had
known once at Bayonne, named Lisette. She was weeping into an apron
and crying out: "No, no, not that! not that!" Other visions crowded
simultaneously&mdash;his brother eating gingerbread, Uncle Sem, and
the canary which seemed to have reached vast dimensions, filling up
a whole room. There was a fat man in a tweed suit lying on his face
amongst some bushes, and coughing horribly. There was a
half-vision, half-realization, of something bursting, blowing up to
the sky in a horrible explosion of unbelievable violence. A
crystallized instant in which all the anger, all the feral
passions, crashed in an agony of blood...</p>

<hr>

<p>"You think, then, Doctor Lancret," said Inspector Tolozan, as
the two men entered the solemn mortuary, "that there will be no
need for a post-mortem examination of the body?"</p>

<p>"None at all, Monsieur Tolozan," replied the doctor. "The cause
of death was perfectly normal. The deceased passed away quietly in
his sleep as the result of cardiac failure, probably due to the
shock of his arrest and the nature of the charge against him. Such
cases are not at all uncommon, as you know, not at all."</p>

<p>"You yourself were on duty, Monsieur le docteur?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur Tolozan. When the&mdash;er&mdash;deceased was
brought in at 8.20 p.m. he was in a state of coma. We tested the
heart and found it to be in a very bad condition, very bad
condition indeed. He slept soundly until 3.20 a.m. when the
attendant called me to say that number 107 was showing signs of
collapse. I arrived, but we could do nothing. He sank rapidly and
passed away at three minutes past four. Um&mdash;yes, that was how
it was. Are you going to Madame Lombard's reception to-night?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Inspector Tolozan. "No, I am not going."</p>

<p>"You will excuse me, Monsieur Tolozan? I have much to do
before..."</p>

<p>"But, certainly, Monsieur le docteur, and thank you."</p>

<p>The doctor bustled out, and Inspector Tolozan turned once more
to the body covered with a white sheet. He raised the cloth and
regarded the features of the criminal, now immutably set in calm
repose.</p>

<p>And there crept into his eyes an expression of pity and wonder.
This analyst of human frailties, this solver of human problems
stood meekly in the presence of a mystery beyond his powers to
solve.</p>

<p>With a reverent gesture he replaced the cloth and went out
quietly.</p>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>22. THE HAPPY MAN</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>There had been much ado about a stool. You see during all the
twenty odd years that Mr. Journ&eacute;e had been in business he
had directed operations seated on a wooden box, that had eventually
become polished to a beautiful brown shine by the friction of his
pants. But when his son Anthony returned from college&mdash;where
only by exercising the most rigid economies had his father been
able to send him&mdash;and entered the workshops, the stool became
a mild centre of discord. Anthony resented his father sitting on
the box. There seemed something discreditable about it. At
Rainsworth College, where he had fairly distinguished himself,
people didn't sit on boxes. It was not as though there were no
chairs about. There were several in that part of the workshop which
served as a kind of reception-room. There were two even of a period
somewhere about the respectable Mr. Chippendale. But when his son
suggested a substitution he said no. He had always sat on the box,
and it was quite good enough for him. He was quite huffy about it,
which for a man of his equable and lovable nature was
remarkable.</p>

<p>Anthony made several more hints, but they were of no avail. Then
he adopted a very astute move. He waited until Christmas, and then
on Christmas morning he presented his father with a beautiful
circular mahogany stool with a green plush seat. He said: "I
thought you might like this, dad, to sit on in the shop."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e was cornered for the moment. He coughed and
spluttered out vague thanks. It was very good of the boy, of
course, very good indeed. H'm! Yes, well, well&mdash; When business
was resumed after Christmas the stool was substituted for the box.
But as the days went by it became apparent that Mr. Journ&eacute;e
was not happy about it. He fidgeted restlessly upon his stool, and
appeared preoccupied as though unable to concentrate on his work.
And a week later Anthony found him seated once more on the box,
with the stool tucked away under the bench. He said nothing, but he
felt angry.</p>

<p>Now we have not sufficient evidence to convict Anthony of the
disaster which happened the next morning, but it is certain that
his sympathy appeared a little strained at the time. For when Mr.
Journ&eacute;e went to sit down, there was a sudden crash, and the
top of the box fell in, and Mr. Journ&eacute;e with it. When he
picked himself up he called out:</p>

<p>"Who has been monkeying with this box?"</p>

<p>Anthony, who had been working on a clay model a dozen yards
away, hurried forward and helped to rectify the disturbance, but,
of course, he knew nothing about it. Mr. Journ&eacute;e growled and
carried the box to another part of the workshop and with his own
hands&mdash;he was a good workman&mdash;he repaired the box, and by
an arrangement of splats and screws he made the box strong enough
to support a he-elephant. And that was the end of that. Anthony
gave up, and Mr. Journ&eacute;e continued to sit on the box to the
end of his days.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>It might be advisable at this point to give a rough description
of Mr. Journ&eacute;e's workshops. They were situated down a narrow
cul-de-sac called Glaize Yard. You came to a black fence on which
was inscribed: "Paul Journ&eacute;e, architectural carver in wood
and stone." You entered an untidy yard, rendered unduly untidy by
the prodigal litter of loose plaster. In the summertime the plaster
blew about and covered everything like a frost. In the winter it
was dangerous to walk on it on account of the slipperiness. The
yard was filled with blocks of Portland stone, planks of timber,
and dilapidated plaster-casts. The workshops were in a buff brick
building on two floors. The ground floor was devoted to plaster,
stone, and sometimes marble. The floor upstairs was devoted to the
noble purposes of fashioning wood, that loyal and ancient friend to
man. It was a long narrow workshop with benches all along the wall
under the window, with rows of gouges and wood-carvers' tools
neatly arranged in front of each workman. The brick walls were
distempered an Indian red, and on them were a bewildering number of
casts, scraps of carving, sections of volutes, capitals, cornices,
cherub's heads, acanthus scrolls, lions rampant, and lions
couchant, and other heraldic devices, rough charcoal drawings,
architectural photographs, and full-size details.</p>

<p>The other side of the long workshop had a socially and
intellectually elastic character. For it had to express various
activities without definite lines of demarcation. At the further
end was a sink and some pegs, where the workmen washed and hung up
their clothes. Then came two long benches covered with drawings and
books, at which Mr. Journ&eacute;e and an old draughtsman, named
Lintot, used to work. At the back of these benches were two white
pine chests, a grandfather clock, and an oak chest. Then there came
a break in the wall, and the workshop began to take on a slightly
different character. One was slowly approaching the social and
business end of the workshop, near the entrance door. A deal bench
was covered by a piece of green baize, on which reposed pens, ink,
books, and correspondence. It was here that Mr. Journ&eacute;e
conducted the administrative side of his business, seated on his
wooden box. After that the workshop culminated in a surprising
touch of the magnificent. For one thing there was a square of
carpet, projecting sufficiently far out so that the wood-carvers
could avoid it when passing in and out. There was a fine old walnut
tallboy, another eight-day clock, three barometers, two Louis XVI
mirrors, a large framed print of the Colosseum at Rome, an
oil-painting by an unknown Italian painter, an ebony and ivory
Venetian chair, and three other old chairs. This was in effect Mr.
Journ&eacute;e's reception-room, where he interviewed his clients,
who were mostly architects.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The incident about the stool had a disturbing effect on Mr.
Journ&eacute;e. It was not that he regarded it as important in
itself as that it symbolized a disquieting side of his son's
nature. He himself was proud of his craft, of his good name, of his
Huguenot stock. The Journ&eacute;es had been English craftsmen of
some sort ever since the days of the massacre of St. Bartholomew.
He was a simple man, with a simple outlook, and passionately
devoted to his wife and son. It had been one of his great ambitions
that his son should take his place and carry on the fine tradition
of his calling. But a few months' service in the workshop gave
evidence that the young man was restless. It was not that he showed
any lack of ability. He gave promise of being an extremely
brilliant draughtsman. He was quick and clever in every way. But
the father became subtly aware that the son in some way despised
the business, and was even slightly contemptuous of himself. His
own education had been of a very sketchy nature. He had had to earn
his own living since he was fourteen. He occasionally dropped his
"h's," and invariably his "g's." He dressed in a slightly eccentric
manner, and was not alive to the finer meanings of social life. But
in these matters he could find nothing important. He was wrapped up
in his work.</p>

<p>When he had married at the age of twenty-four, he had been a
journeyman wood-carver, earning tenpence an hour. His wife Bessie
was the daughter of a piano-tuner. They lived in two rooms in
Kentish Town, and the boy was born the following year. The early
struggles of the young couple were severe. Being a journeyman
carver he was always liable to an hour's dismissal, and when work
was scarce he would frequently be out of employment for months. It
says a good deal for the courage and faith of this young workman
and the devotion and loyalty of his wife that they emerged from
these conditions successfully. At the age of twenty-six, a relative
died and left him seventy-five pounds, and he immediately set up in
business for himself. He worked in a kind of scullery in the
basement of the house where their lodgings were. He traipsed the
streets of London with samples and photographs of his work, and
called on innumerable architects. For the most part he was received
with indifference if not with rebuffs, frequently with that
chilling formula: "Very well. Leave your name and address. If an
opportunity occurs, Mr. So-and-so will let you know."</p>

<p>He was at that time a tall, clumsily-built young man,
high-shouldered, and too long in the thin flanks. When he walked
his spindley legs seemed to be shaking in disgust at the eager
onrush of those hunched shoulders and that keen projecting chin.
The face was narrow, and the nose and ears too large. His untidy
black hair, which was short behind, fell in unmanageable strands
across his temples and deep brown eyes. He looked like a gentle and
reflective vulture, if you can conceive such a thing. But in this
grim struggle to improve the lot of his kind he had one invaluable
asset. Old Lintot&mdash;who was devoted to him&mdash;used to say in
after years:</p>

<p>"Where the guv'nor gets away with it is that he <i>believes
in</i> things."</p>

<p>And he just went on <i>believing</i> in things. He had a simple
reverence for names, traditions, and beauty in every form. Not
understanding much, he felt it all intensely. His dreams were
coloured by magic yearnings. And because he believed in his dreams
he gradually influenced others to believe in him. Sometimes at
night when he and his wife were discussing how they could possibly
buy boots for the growing boy, they would suddenly change the
subject and talk eagerly about the wonderful trip they were going
to make to Italy "one day." They had got on. The boy had been sent
to a public school, but the dream of the trip to Italy had not yet
materialized.</p>

<p>The disturbing thoughts that crept into the mind of Paul
Journ&eacute;e when meditating upon his son's attitude, centred
round a recurring doubt, a doubt that&mdash;well, with all his
cleverness, his brilliance, his learning, did the boy really
<i>believe</i> in things?</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>If Anthony's advent to his father's workshop opened
inauspiciously it did in any case have one bright aspect to it, for
it synchronized with a wave of comparative prosperity. It was as
though nature, preparing this youth for a brilliant career, was
deliberately determined to see that his setting should always be
appropriate. Soon after his arrival the father received a large
order for carving on a municipal building in the Midlands, and soon
after another large order for carved chair-backs. This latter
demand came through Justin McGrath. The McGraths were the
Journ&eacute;es' closest and most intimate friends. Justin was a
chairmaker with premises in the neighbourhood. He and his wife were
much older than the Journ&eacute;es, and they had a daughter named
Laura. Laura was a sweet-tempered, rather plain girl in her
twenty-seventh year. She appeared to be considerably older, as a
result, no doubt, of living her life and submerging it in the lives
of two much older people. The old couple adored their daughter, and
were entirely oblivious of how much they preyed upon her youth and
vitality.</p>

<p>The two families supped together at least once a week, and
looked in on each other at odd hours of the day and night. Mr.
Journ&eacute;e always referred to Mr. McGrath as "the old 'un."
These two elderly craftsmen would sit over their pipes in the
evening and discuss Wren, and Jean Goujon, and Viollet-de-Duc. And
they would lend each other books, over which they would pore, books
with illustrations of Italian palaces, and sculpture, and gardens,
of French cathedrals, and Spanish iron. They were neither of them
of a keenly critical nature. They admired everything, as though
hushed into a profound reverence for the past. Mr. Journ&eacute;e
would adjust his spectacles and exclaim:</p>

<p>"By Jove, old 'un, here's a fine frieze!"</p>

<p>And Mr. McGrath would adjust his, and make little clucking
sounds of approbation. They belonged to a guild where men of their
kind foregathered, and read papers and held discussions on the
subjects which interested them. They went for a walk together
regularly every Sunday morning in Regent's Park, whilst their wives
prepared the Sunday dinner. Sometimes they allowed their minds to
wander in abstract speculations. They touched on politics,
religion, philosophy, and life, and so came to know each other.</p>

<p>During this year of Anthony's experiment in the workshop, the
slow-moving mind of Mr. Journ&eacute;e became quietly occupied with
a plan for the realization of a dream. For he was a careful man,
and, as Lintot said, "never put his leg over the stile till he
could see the other side." But things were going well, very well,
better than they had ever gone before. After paying his workmen on
Saturday morning he went carefully into his accounts. He made
calculations and estimates. Yes, it could be done. It was now the
end of February. He wouldn't tell Bessie. He would wait till April.
She would be so bitterly disappointed if it didn't come off. Lintot
and the foreman, Greville, would manage somehow. They would go off
for a month. They should realize that honeymoon dream of over
twenty years ago&mdash;a month in Italy. Rome, Padua, Florence,
Venice, Sienna. He could almost see the white palaces glistening in
the sun, the cypress-trees, the olive groves. He could almost hear
the low, musical cry of the gondoliers, as they glided their craft
down dimly-lighted canals out into the moon-flooded mystery of the
Venetian night, where the festival is held under the shadow of the
Santa Maria della Salute.</p>

<p>He suffered agonies of restraint in not breaking the news to his
wife, but the months went by and April came. One Sunday morning
when the daffodils were out in the Park, where he was walking with
his friend McGrath, he suddenly thought: "I will tell her
to-night." But he said nothing to McGrath. He felt it would be in
some way mean to let anyone know until he had told her.</p>

<p>After tea that evening Anthony followed him into the
drawing-room. The mother was washing up. He said:</p>

<p>"Father, can I have a bit of a jaw with you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e said: "Of course, my boy."</p>

<p>The young man seemed a little self-conscious and on edge. He
suddenly blurted out:</p>

<p>"You know, I don't think I'm going to be any good at this
business. It bores me."</p>

<p>An expression of troubled disappointment came into the eyes of
Mr. Journ&eacute;e, but he answered quietly:</p>

<p>"What do you want to do, Anthony?"</p>

<p>"Father, you've been&mdash;been doing pretty well lately,
haven't you? Couldn't you afford to send me to Paris? I'd like to
go over there and study to become a painter. I know two other chaps
going in the spring."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e looked into the bowl of his pipe. He took a
long time to answer and when he did he said:</p>

<p>"Anthony, is it that you <i>really</i> want to become a painter?
It isn't, is it, that you think you would just like to lead that
kind of life?"</p>

<p>"No. I've got ambitions. I feel cramped here. Everyone says I
have talent, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's true."</p>

<p>He paused again and fumbled with a match.</p>

<p>"I want you to do what you think is right, my boy. I shall have
to think this over."</p>

<p>And the young man went out, and Mr. Journ&eacute;e sat there
thinking. He could hear his wife singing over the clatter of the
teacups. Paris, eh? Of course, the boy must choose his own career.
But&mdash;Paris! this would mean a lot of expense, years and years
and the uncertain life of a painter. Of course, the boy's career
was more important than&mdash;than their pleasures. But that would
be the end of Italy&mdash;for the time. He poked the fire and
watched the grey ash fall into the pan. After a time his wife came
in. He said:</p>

<p>"Well, mother, finished?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, there wasn't much to do."</p>

<p>The tones of his voice seemed a little clouded as, after a
pause, he said:</p>

<p>"The McGraths are coming in to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad."</p>

<p>A happy smile lighted the face of Mrs. Journ&eacute;e, as she
picked up her work-basket, and took her accustomed seat facing her
husband.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Anthony was away until July, when he returned for a month's
holiday. The two families shared a furnished house at Angmering for
the month of August, with a rather surprising result. For Anthony
and Laura fell in love. The boy had been working hard, and he was
obviously keen and ambitious. The father was pleased to see that it
was, indeed, "the thing itself" his son was seeking, and not the
attractive features of a student's life in Paris. He had not felt
justified in allowing him more than just sufficient to live on
comfortably, and he had not got into debt. Although more animated
and eager in his manners, his attitude was, if anything, graver
than it had been before he went away. He was obviously in earnest.
Well, well, in that case the postponement of the trip to Italy was
justified. Business would improve, the boy would get on, the day
would not be far distant. Neither Mr. Journ&eacute;e nor Mr.
McGrath could spare a whole month from their business. They stayed
a fortnight and came down for the following two weekends. It was on
that first week-end, after they had been a week in town, that the
truth was brought home to them.</p>

<p>It came about most unexpectedly. Anthony and Laura had known
each other for years, and had never once regarded each other in any
other light than as good friends. She was seven years older than
he.</p>

<p>But there is something about the seashore which has always
proved a source of trouble to wayward hearts. After four months'
separation their meeting had about it an element of novelty. They
saw each other in a new light. There were aspects about his
Parisian experiences which caused Anthony to react rather violently
to this familiar, simple-minded girl friend. He had found himself
over there a little shy, home-sick, and bewildered. Everyone seemed
so clever, so sophisticated, so very much a part of it all. He had
not made many friends, and his knowledge of French was very
imperfect.</p>

<p>One morning, lying on the beach after bathing, he looked at
Laura, who was lying on her back by his side, taking a sun bath.
She was wrapped up in a towel, but her legs and arms were bare. Her
healthy plump face was framed in loose brown hair drying in the
sun. Her arms were stretched out, and her eyes closed, giving the
impression of complete contentment. Her little pink feet were
diapered with sand.</p>

<p>He looked away for a moment at the sea, and felt something queer
stir within him. Why had he never thought of this before?</p>

<p>This happened during the first week of his stay. Angmering is a
small place, and the days are idle. He had no other companions of
his own age. Even if&mdash;even if nothing came of it, it was
obviously the pleasantest way to pass one's time. They went for
rambles on the dunes, and lay side by side beneath the tamarisks.
And he told her eagerly of his life in Paris, his ambitions, and
his hopes. And he took her hand, and romped with her, as brothers
and sisters do. And still she did not see.</p>

<p>She was a difficult girl to flirt with. She accepted everything
as a literal statement. Her large, grey, innocent eyes seemed proof
against the most subtle erotic shafts. She was desperately
happy!</p>

<p>One thing concerning her irritated him. He could not get her to
come out with him in the evening. She would not leave her mother.
In the raw daylight he still felt a little self-conscious. He had
not had the experience to carry this thing by storm without the aid
of darkness. When it came to the question of any kind of
protestation of this new-found passion he felt quite inarticulate.
Perhaps there warred within him two forces uncertain of each other,
a subconscious egoism that did not mean to be denied, and an
unfamiliar passion he knew not how to interpret.</p>

<p>One night, however, the opportunity he was seeking occurred. She
had finished a game of bezique with her mother, and dashed out
hatless to the post. He followed, and at the angle of the road
called after her. She stopped and said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Tony, are you coming with me?"</p>

<p>He said "Yes" in a husky voice, and caught hold of her by the
forearm. They were by the side of a steep grass bank that walled-in
someone's garden. She noticed something strange about his pale face
in the moonlight, and she said:</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>For answer he threw his other arm around her, and kissed her
clumsily on the cheek. And still he could see that she did not
understand. She said:</p>

<p>"Are you in trouble, Tony?"</p>

<p>He tried to kiss her on the lips then, but she turned her cheeks
away, and raised her arms between them.</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish," she said calmly.</p>

<p>"Can't you see?" he exclaimed almost angrily.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I love you, Laura."</p>

<p>But when the words left his lips they did not sound as he meant
them to sound. They were less like an avowal of love than a
complaint of ill-treatment. But he saw her start, as though
awakened from a dream. She looked at him, with her lips
half-parted. She was probably blushing, but he could not be
certain. She muttered: "Oh, my dear, I did not know. You
mustn't&mdash;you mustn't&mdash;" She hurried across the road to
the pillar-box, and he followed her in silence.</p>

<p>When the letter was posted, and they were returning, they walked
arm in arm, but he did not try to kiss her again. They walked back
without speaking. He could see her bosom heaving, and her eyes were
bright. At the gate she gave his hand a tight little squeeze and
hurried in.</p>

<p>And as each of them fell asleep that night they both shared an
emotion in common. It was an emotion which had in it something of
an unknown blinding ecstasy; but the ecstasy of one was tinged with
contentment and a profound happiness; the ecstasy of the other with
a sense of fear and vague unhappiness.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Before the return of the two fathers the following Saturday,
things moved with surprising rapidity. It took Laura two days to
begin even to unravel the skeins of emotion which had suddenly
entangled her. Love! She had read about love in books&mdash;when
she had time to escape from her domestic obligations. She had even
dreamed of love as a remote passion applying to far-off people. But
to come upon <i>her</i> like this!</p>

<p>It was all wild and foolish. She was in any case much too old
for Anthony, much too plain and dull. Nevertheless, the next
morning she regarded him in an entirely new light. He had become
very good-looking of late. Paris had improved him. Everyone said he
was brilliant; that he had a brilliant career before him. Things
came his way. He was quick, clever, and charming in manners when he
wanted to be. She watched his lithe boyish figure sprinting across
the sands. She saw the laughter and the love-light in those keen,
dark, rather mysterious eyes. She liked him next to her, and what
he said aroused a thousandfold more interest than it had done the
previous day. She thought about him, and thought, and thought. And
she thought about herself, and her father and mother, and her God.
And a new book in her life seemed to be opened.</p>

<p>The first night she would not go out with him after supper, but
the second night she did. The old ladies went to bed very early.
They had all been for an excursion. Laura wanted to know, wanted to
hear, in any case, how people spoke when they were in love. She
wanted to hear how Anthony spoke. And that night he was eloquent
enough. For he took her down on to the sandbanks and kissed her on
the lips. She found herself clinging to him, and when he said he
loved her, his voice was vibrant and convincing. For the first time
she heard the voice of a lover speaking.</p>

<p>After that there was no pretence. Laura was incapable of
pretending, and Anthony had no desire to. They spent the day
rejoicing in each other, regardless of the glances of onlookers.
For the first time in her life Laura neglected her mother in the
evenings. At first the old lady did not understand. She became
peevish and querulous. But Mrs. Journ&eacute;e was quicker in her
perceptions. She did not rely upon her son with that
taken-for-granted assurance that her friend relied upon her
daughter. Perhaps for this reason she observed him more
objectively. She was more sensitive to the shifts of his moods. She
saw him again and again holding Laura's hand, gazing into her
eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>And she thought: "Oh, dear! oh, dear! I wish it was Saturday and
Paul was here." She was unused to grappling with any emotional
experience without her husband's help. This was tremendous,
cataclysmic, almost beyond itself. Her Anthony! Nancy's Laura! And
Laura was so much older&mdash; She could not face it.</p>

<p>It was not until she was enveloped in comfortable darkness, in
her own bed, on the Saturday night, and her husband was lying by
her side, that she unburdened herself. Mr. Journ&eacute;e was at
first inclined to laugh about it.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose there is anything in it, mother," he said.
"Young people, you know, the sea air and that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he was quite patently excited about it. To think
that his son and Justin's daughter&mdash;after all these years. Of
course, the girl was older than the boy, but still&mdash; He told
his wife about a new job he expected to get, a carved staircase for
a rich South African. He thought it well to distract her attention.
She might not sleep. She had probably not been sleeping too well.
He felt a tinge of conscience that he should have been absent, when
she was assailed by this emotional upheaval.</p>

<p>In the morning, he was up early, anxious to take his bearings.
Justin came down later and after breakfast the two families
wandered down to the beach. Mr. Journ&eacute;e was preoccupied. His
fellow-guildsman wanted to tell him about a contract that a firm of
decorators had secured by bribing a consulting architect, and also
about a sale of furniture that was coming off the following week in
Hanover Square, but Mr. Journ&eacute;e's eyes were intently fixed
upon two figures prancing about on the shore, and lying side by
side against the breakwater, and his mind was occupied with doubts
and misgivings. "Suppose he gets tired of her&mdash;"</p>

<p>In the afternoon he went for a walk by himself. Alone amidst the
murmur of the sea, and the intermittent screaming of the gulls, he
thought the thing out.</p>

<p>"No, I shan't tell the old 'un. It wouldn't be fair. He'll never
notice. It will probably all blow over. I would trust Laura. But
she's seven years older&mdash; Anthony might get tired of her. He's
clever. Poor Laura girl, you're dull and not too pretty. Of course,
if it had all been just the other way about or in any case a little
different&mdash; My son and his daughter! But we must try and do
the right thing, eh, old man? If the boy says anything I shall try
and dissuade him. When he gets back to Paris&mdash;"</p>

<p>He hummed to himself perplexedly. In this great open space the
world seemed very vast&mdash;vast and mysterious&mdash;and yet
somehow wonderfully satisfying. The tamarisks nodded in the breeze,
and the sun began to set.</p>

<p>"Life is very beautiful," he thought. "I mustn't let mother
worry."</p>

<p>And then he went back home, for with all its beauty, nature, as
he saw it then, seemed lacking in something.</p>

<p>The families spent a quiet evening. The two young ones
disappeared soon after supper, and the four elders devoted the
evening to a sleepily conversational game of whist. At half-past
ten Mrs. Journ&eacute;e declared for bed, and the McGraths followed
her. Mr. Journ&eacute;e said he would sit up a bit and read. The
night was warm, and he sat near the window turning over the sheets
of a Sunday newspaper which he had already read once. After a time
he heard the garden gate click, and two people come whispering up
the path. They stood near the window which was open, and he drew
back into the room. It was not his place to overhear. He heard the
front door open and shut, and two people tiptoeing up the stairs.
He must have dozed after that, for the room seemed cold, when, with
a start, he heard his name called, and, looking up, saw Justin
standing by the door. The old 'un was in a dressing-gown, looking
tousled, but somehow very agitated. He came straight up and,
without any preliminaries, tapped him on the shoulder and said
excitedly:</p>

<p>"Paul! Paul, old man. Do you know that our two children are
engaged?" And he held out his hand.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e was a man who extracted extreme delight out
of small things. It was an intense pleasure to him to polish his
boots&mdash;he never allowed anyone else to touch his square-toed
brown boots&mdash;brush his clothes, or clean out his pipe. When he
came down in the morning at Angmering he would stroll out into the
garden, take several deep breaths in a way someone had shown him,
do a few clumsy exercises, and then light his pipe for a few whiffs
before breakfast. He would stand there in the sun, blinking at the
flowers or the glittering dew on a spider's web, and feel good.
Nature felt good to him, because he never questioned her
prescriptions. He liked to feel life pouring through him, and he
the reverent medium for life's expression.</p>

<p>Before Anthony returned to Paris he enjoyed many such mornings.
His early misgivings were overcome by the contagious optimism of
the rest, and particularly of his old friend Justin. Justin
dismissed the question of the difference in the ages of the young
people as of little consequence. They were both young in his eyes,
so what did a mere matter of seven years make in a lifetime? In his
opinion it was an ideal match. His wife agreed with him, only
adding a hope that they would not marry "for a long, long time." As
for Mrs. Journ&eacute;e, she wept a little when she heard that the
affair was already settled, but she did not let her husband see her
tears.</p>

<p>That the affair would not happen for a long long time was fairly
obvious. Anthony had only just begun to study for one of the most
precarious professions in the world, and neither of the parents was
in a position to set the young couple up in a life partnership. It
gave Mr. Journ&eacute;e an opportunity of giving his son a broad
hint that he should forego his extravagant ambitions, and return to
the workshops. It was a solider career. In only a few years' time
he might be able to make him a partner, and then he could marry and
settle down. At the expression "settle down," Anthony tossed his
head. He said that he had no intention of settling down, even when
married. Settling down meant curbing your ambitions, becoming a
cabbage. Mr. Journ&eacute;e didn't quite understand what he meant.
He said defensively that there was "no harm in anyone having a
touch of cabbage about them."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, having once acquiesced in the affair, Mr.
Journ&eacute;e subscribed to it whole-heartedly. He was as excited
as a schoolboy. He kissed Laura and already began to treat her as
his own daughter. He playfully ragged his wife about it, and felt
drawn closer than ever to his old friend. And in his morning
walk&mdash;he always did a mile walk before starting his day's
work&mdash;he dreamt of this new-born happiness the earth was
producing, and of his grandchildren&mdash;what he would do for
them. Perhaps by that time the business would be paying well. He
visualised soft clinging little limbs about his knees, and baby
voices calling "Grandpa!" Anthony went back to Paris with his
ambitions; but he left his heart behind, and also a beautiful gold
ring set with a pearl and two small rubies (paid for by his
father). It was all very rapid. But as Mr. Journ&eacute;e said, "It
was not as though they had only <i>known</i> each other a
month."</p>

<p>Two years passed rapidly and uneventfully. He and Laura
corresponded frequently. We must not pry into these letters, but
their devotion was apparent and constant. Laura began studying all
the art books she could borrow, and she made frequent visits to the
National Gallery and the Wallace Collection. She could already
distinguish between a Raphael and a Raeburn. She was preparing
herself as the wife of a famous painter.</p>

<p>One day Mrs. McGrath had a mild paralytic seizure. She was
confined to bed for several months. Laura waited on her day and
night. Coming out of the house one night and standing by the hall
door, where Laura was seeing him off, Mr. Journ&eacute;e suddenly
thought:</p>

<p>"Good Lord! Poor Laura, how she's ageing. She must be over
thirty, but she looks&mdash;she looks anything to-night. Those dark
lines round her eyes. It's quite time she was married&mdash;"</p>

<p>The problem began to obsess him. Anthony was getting on well.
But&mdash;well, he had not sold a picture yet, and was not likely
to for some time. His own business was going fairly well, but
nothing to write home about. Old McGrath had his hands full to keep
things going. But he would like the boy to get married. He spent
long hours over his books, and his calculations. It was certain
that he and his wife couldn't do that Italian trip until the young
couple were launched. But still&mdash;</p>

<p>If only the boy would settle down a bit. It would be as cheap to
keep them both in London as to keep the boy in Paris. If they could
manage not to have children for a year or two, for instance; or,
for that matter, why shouldn't Laura go to Paris?</p>

<p>Returning home one Sunday morning from their weekly walk, he
said:</p>

<p>"Old un, I think it's time those children got married."</p>

<p>"Eh? what's that?" said Justin. "Married! But surely Anthony
could hardly&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was impossible for Mr. Journ&eacute;e to explain that he was
thinking less of his son in the matter than of his friend's
daughter. He pretended to a greater state of affluence than he had
any claim to. After a good deal of misgiving he offered to set the
young people up "in a modest way" until such time as Anthony should
be in a position to support the household. The old 'un almost shed
tears of gratitude. It would certainly be very desirable. He
deplored the fact that he could do so little himself. He would
however, do what he could. Mrs. McGrath, on the other hand, offered
every objection. It was wrong, for young people to marry without
means. Besides, what was going to happen to her?</p>

<p>"I married when I was earning tenpence an hour," argued Mr.
Journ&eacute;e. And as a bright after-reflection he suggested that,
perhaps, they would agree to live with Mr. and Mrs. McGrath so that
Laura could still carry out her filial obligations. When Anthony
came home for the Christmas holidays the proposal was put to him,
and to everyone's surprise he accepted it.</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Anthony and Laura were married the following Easter. The
ceremony was carried out with as much &eacute;clat as the means of
the parties concerned allowed for. Mr. Journ&eacute;e was all for a
little show. He liked the ceremonial and sentimental side of it. He
bought a tailcoat and a top-hat. A wedding cake was ordered, and
they were married in a church. The ceremony was followed by a
wedding breakfast to which some fifteen guests were invited. Mr.
Journ&eacute;e was up early in a great state of excitement. Being a
nervous man he fussed over every little detail. He was the kind of
man who, when he had to catch a train, was always at the station at
least three-quarters of an hour before the train was due to start.
And at the wedding he was ready at least two hours too soon,
fussing about and calling out:</p>

<p>"Now then, Mary, has that claret come yet? Mother, are you
nearly ready? Anything I can do, my dear? God bless my soul! we
haven't any cigarettes for the young men. Where's Anthony? You mean
to say the boy's not up yet! Does he know it's <i>his</i> wedding
and not mine? Anthony! Anthony!"</p>

<p>Anthony took no pains to show that all this fuss was distasteful
to him. He regarded it as frankly Philistine, not to say, common.
He would have liked to have been married at a registrar's office,
and to have quietly slipped away. He was in a perfect dread that
his father would want to make a speech at the wedding breakfast,
saying silly and sentimental things and dropping his "h's" and
"g's" all over the place. Fortunately, there would be no one there
who mattered. He thought, however, that it was advisable to give
way on certain points, as he had been somewhat lordly in his terms
in agreeing to the wedding at all. He had agreed that he and his
wife should live with the McGraths, on the understanding that he
had a studio out. He had, indeed, become a little tired of Paris,
and the idea of marriage seemed to present a pleasant change. He
was anxious, too, to work on his own, unrestricted by French
professors.</p>

<p>His attitude at the wedding breakfast was, rather, one of bored
tolerance. He did not know that his father had actually rehearsed a
speech. Mr. Journ&eacute;e wanted to talk about love and happiness,
about his own married life, and his long friendship with the
bride's father. When he got upon his legs, however, his eye
alighted on his son's face, and he merely stammered:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the toast of the bride and
bridegroom."</p>

<p>Everyone cheered and raised their glasses and there were loud
calls for a speech from the bridegroom, but the latter merely shook
his head and smiled uncomfortably. He was anxious to be off.</p>

<p>When they left there was the usual tragic-comic parting
associable with such events. The funny man and some of his friends,
to whom it meant just a wedding, some of whom had drunk a little
too much and were hilarious; the Journ&eacute;es and McGraths
rather pathetically trying to be gay; Mrs. McGrath weeping a little
when she kissed her daughter; the bride radiantly happy and trying
not to cry; Mr. Journ&eacute;e showing meticulous interest in all
the details of their journey to the Isle of Wight, where they were
going for the honeymoon, and all the time deeply stirred by the
larger aspects of the great affair; the bridegroom posing as
essentially the man of the world, to whom being married was an
everyday occurrence.</p>

<p>They went at last, and the guests gradually departed. Mr.
McGrath went too, as he had to see a man on business. The two
mothers sat in the drawing-room and talked. The evening crept on.
Mr. Journ&eacute;e put on his hat and strolled across to his
workshops, which had been closed for the day in honour of the
event. He let himself in and went upstairs.</p>

<p>Deep in thought, he paced the long, narrow shop. On the other
side of the yard were other workshops, from which came the sound of
someone beating on iron. It had a soothing rhythmic sound. He
became subtly aware of the smell of wood. Wood! all his life had
been spent under the smell of wood. At the end of the shop was a
heap of pine shavings. He went up and stirred them affectionately
with his foot. Then he strolled along the benches, examining the
men's work.</p>

<p>"H'm!" he thought, "Dawes is getting too much relief into the
scroll. Some of these fellows get a tool in their hand and there's
no holding 'em. I must tell him. By Jove! that's a lovely
egg-and-tongue! Charlie's cutting that beautifully. That young man
will get on. I shall have to give him another twopence an hour
soon. Sievewright's clamped this baluster in a funny way. I don't
see how he's going to get at it. Must ask him to-morrow."</p>

<p>He put on his steel-rimmed spectacles, and examined Lintot's
drawing.</p>

<p>"Now where has that old man got that detail from? It's not
Gibbons. It's not even Inigo Jones. Clever old rascal though!
Expect he has some authority."</p>

<p>He wandered down towards the administrative side of the shop.
Suddenly he caught sight of a stool beneath his writing-bench.
Quite mechanically he pulled it out and examined it. It was a
circular mahogany stool with a green plush seat. He had forgotten
all about it. It still looked bright and new and somehow
uncompanionable. He turned it over and muttered:</p>

<p>"H'm, yes, very good of the boy, very good, of course."</p>

<p>Then he tucked it away in the place from which he had taken it.
The workshop seemed to get a little lonely then. He lighted his
pipe, the match flickering impatiently over the bowl, as though the
hand that held it was not quite steady. Then he pulled his large
slouch hat over his eyes and went out.</p>

<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Work is the social leaven that keeps men and women sane. Some
people avoid it and become degenerates. Others abuse it and become
unbalanced. It was work which kept the eye of Mr. Journ&eacute;e
bright, whilst his son was away on his honeymoon. It was work which
drove Anthony back from his honeymoon, rather precipitately a week
before he was due. He had become restless. After a few days at the
sea, he became convinced that there was no need for the delights of
early married life to interfere with the thrust of his ambitions.
He had seen the great world, and he desired to be part and parcel
of it. His fingers itched to express something that should be
noticed&mdash;something that would make his name. Laura talked of
her home, and what she would do with the rooms allocated to them,
and how she would manage details that seemed hardly worth worrying
about to Anthony. He had already, in imagination, designed the
place they would live in when he was famous. He visualised
receptions where all the notabilities foregathered, and he and
Laura standing at the top of a noble staircase receiving them. He
could already hear the hushed whispers of the crowd: "Look! there
he is, that's Anthony Journ&eacute;e!"</p>

<p>The explanation of their return was perhaps a little lame, but
it satisfied the parents. When Mr. McGrath said raggingly:</p>

<p>"What my dear, tired of honeymooning already?"</p>

<p>She blushed and whispered:</p>

<p>"It didn't seem important being down there, dad. Our life is
going to be one long honeymoon. Besides, Anthony naturally wants to
get on with his work, and I must get the place straight."</p>

<p>They both set about their respective duties with avidity. The
person most delighted to see them back was old Mrs. McGrath.
Nothing had been right while Laura was away. She could never find
anything. Her food was never cooked properly. Her husband was out
all day and the servant neglected her, and was rude and
careless.</p>

<p>"If you hadn't come back soon, my dear, I'm sure I should have
been really seriously ill."</p>

<p>All that was soon put to rights. Anthony went off to his studio
directly after breakfast and returned in time for dinner in the
evening. This in itself was an innovation to the McGraths and the
Journ&eacute;es, who were accustomed to have their dinner midday.
Anthony was not made aware of the time and attention devoted to his
mother-in-law. The rooms he lived in were clean and bright and
comfortable. His dinner was always excellently cooked and served.
He did not know that it was the second hot meal his wife had cooked
that day. Indeed, he made no inquiries at all about the domestic
details of the McGrath household. He arrived home rather surly and
preoccupied. Laura soon discovered that it was better to say little
to him till he had fed. After dinner he would stretch himself, talk
glib satisfaction about his day's work, be a little amorous, smoke
many cigarettes, read the newspaper, and go to bed.</p>

<p>Laura was perfectly happy. In only one particular did she find
her union with Anthony disconcerting. And that curiously enough was
in connection with his work.</p>

<p>She had taken great pains to attain some understanding of the
old masters. And to her alarm she found she was all wrong. Anthony
seemed to have no great respect for the old masters. He spoke of
them superciliously, in the same tone that he spoke of the
McGrath's and Journ&eacute;e's relatives and friends. It was as
though he had something up his sleeve about them that it was hardly
worth his while to impart to her. His own work seemed quite
incomprehensible. He painted in the manner of some French school
she had not heard of. It impressed her as being curiously angular
and unconvincing. Neither did he ever seem very anxious that she
should come round to his studio. If she went, he would kiss her and
play with her hair, but he made no attempt to explain his work. It
appeared to be the kind of painting that was done by a certain set,
and which, in a few years' time, would become all the rage.</p>

<p>But if Laura was bewildered by her husband's surprising
productions, Mr. Journ&eacute;e was even more so. He arrived all
aglow to observe his son's progress. He was given to understand
that he principally painted interiors, and he envisaged an
immature, but promising display of works in the manner of Pieter de
Hoogh. Instead of which he found himself regarding most astonishing
daubs of pink and green, tables all out of perspective, curious
patterns, intending to represent herrings and teapots and such-like
things.</p>

<p>In his naivet&eacute; he asked what it was all about, and
Anthony simply shut him up. He told his father he knew nothing
about art, and was very rude to him. It was the unpleasantest
interview that had ever taken place between father and son.
Discussing it that night with old McGrath&mdash;he had forgiven his
son by then&mdash;he said:</p>

<p>"I don't know, old 'un, I'm sure. It seems to me funny stuff.
Founded on nothing. Of course, I may be wrong. I've been brought up
to believe in tradition. But perhaps we're getting out of date, old
'un. The boy says it's the thing that's coming. He talks above my
head. I've never yet heard of anything good coming out of nothing.
But we may be wrong. Life is very mysterious. These young
people&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused and blinked at the gas chandelier.</p>

<p>"Do people buy that kind of thing?" grunted the old 'un.</p>

<p>"Ah! that I don't know. He said nothing about that."</p>

<p>"He said nothing about it!"</p>

<p>The two elderly gentlemen sat there in silence; Mr. McGrath
surprised that his friend should show so little sympathy for the
interests of his daughter; Mr. Journ&eacute;e wondering whether the
long tradition of craftsmanship he had the honour to represent was
going to end in abortion or genius.</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p>It was a strange two years which followed this union of the
Journ&eacute;es and McGraths. Beneath the surface of apparent
success there was a disturbing undercurrent. Over many pipes Mr.
Journ&eacute;e often pondered whether he had been wise in sending
his son to a public school, in allowing him to go to Paris, in
lavishing upon him more than the surplus of his hard-earned gains.
He had read somewhere a line which ran: "Each man kills the thing
he loves," and the phrase haunted him. At the same time he felt
that Anthony was in some queer way beyond him. He felt a little
proud&mdash;as people always do&mdash;of producing something he
didn't understand. And it produced in him a certain sense of
egotistical vanity to be able to tell his friends that his son was
going to be a painter, that he had been to Paris, and that he had a
studio of his own. After his own hard lot and struggles it appeared
to him a piquant luxury to be the parent of such a situation.</p>

<p>He buried himself in his workshops, making large charcoal
drawings of pediments and friezes, supervising the workmen, getting
out estimates of cornices and egg-and-dart at so much per foot. He
kept his accounts&mdash;seated on his wooden box&mdash;paid his
men, interviewed architects, got out quantities for builders, and
discussed detail with Lintot. The business fluctuated. Sometimes he
was very busy, sometimes very slack. On the whole doing fairly
well.</p>

<p>He would have been really in a position to put money by, but for
the expenses of his married son. It was not that the boy was
extravagant in himself&mdash;his domestic expenses were negligible,
thanks to Laura. But his muse appeared to be an eccentric mistress.
She required an enormous number of canvases and strange colours,
and materials. And occasionally it appeared to be imperative that
the young artist should go over to Paris or Munich. He always went
by himself, and usually returned more reserved and aloft than
usual, more oblivious to his surroundings. He began to develop a
personality that could only be described as exotic. There were
lines of insolent beauty about his face and the poise of his head.
Also he made friends in Chelsea and Kensington, people of a wealthy
aesthetic set. He never took his wife there, and hardly ever
referred to them among his own family. It was as though he
considered it impossible to explain. These were two alien worlds.
In the one he was loved, and love is a quality common to the
masses. In the other he was admired, and admiration is a quality
reserved for the few.</p>

<p>It was old McGrath who began to kick against the situation. A
child was expected. And as he said to his friend one night:</p>

<p>"Paul, how much longer is this monkeying about with new art
going on? What is going to happen when the child comes? It's unfair
on you."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e frankly didn't know what to do. He wanted to
do the best for the boy. It was not as though he were indolent or
dissolute. He worked very hard and was very keen. It was true he
didn't understand his son's work. But he might be wrong. He knew
that he mixed with people who were much talked about and who
admired his son, who avowed that he had genius. But the time must
come when ways and means would have to be considered. One day he
decided that he would take his son to task and thrash the whole
matter out.</p>

<p>He said nothing to his wife at supper-time. He felt nervous. He
thought out carefully just what he would say to his son, the
questions he would put, the advice he would give&mdash;he was a
difficult boy to talk to. He was always slightly apprehensive that
his son was laughing at him deep down in his soul, that he meant
nothing to him at all, except as a rather foolish means to an
enigmatic end.</p>

<p>After supper he put on his hat and toddled across to the
McGraths. Old Justin turned on the light in the hall, and opened
the door to him. He said:</p>

<p>"Good evening, old 'un, is the boy in?"</p>

<p>Old McGrath stared for a moment as though hardly recognising
him. Then he said: "No. He left this afternoon for Paris. He said
it was very important. He borrowed ten pounds from me."</p>

<p>Then, melting to a different mood, the old man seized his hand
and added:</p>

<p>"Come in Paul. Laura's very bad."</p>

<h3>XI</h3>

<p>The child&mdash;a boy&mdash;was born forty-eight hours later,
after what the doctor described as "a very difficult case." Anthony
had not returned. They wired to him, and received a reply the
following day: "Congratulations, love, wiring later, Anthony." They
heard no more from him for four days, and there was a distinct rift
in the lute of family affection. Laura made no complaint.</p>

<p>"He is busy," she said. "Besides, what good can he do? He will
come soon."</p>

<p>She was, perhaps, too blinded by this magic bundle of delight
that had so abruptly, painfully, and mysteriously thrust itself
into her life to be unduly perturbed by the absence of her husband.
But Mrs. McGrath complained that she thought it was "a very curious
way of going on," and Mr. McGrath was righteously indignant. He was
even inclined to blame Mr. Journ&eacute;e, as though he considered
that he was partly to blame.</p>

<p>If you thrust a stick into an ants' nest and stir it up the ants
immediately start rebuilding. But human creatures are not so
recuperative. It takes time for their emotions to focus before
building work can be even considered. It seemed a curiously hard,
cruel stick that Anthony had suddenly thrust into this nest,
unnecessarily cruel and thoughtless, to say the least of it. Fancy
deserting one's wife in such a crisis, going off without
explanation, and sending such a bald telegram!</p>

<p>On the fourth day, however, the further telegram as promised
arrived. Its contents were equally astonishing. It ran: "Sold
picture <i>petit salon</i> fifteen thousand francs, writing, love,
Anthony." On the receipt of this telegram the ants immediately
foregathered and tried to piece their emotions into a workable
form. Laura exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm <i>so</i> glad for him. He will be so happy, poor dear.
He's sure to come back soon now."</p>

<p>And she went on feeding the baby. Mr. McGrath said:</p>

<p>"Good gracious me!" and he took out an envelope and, on the back
of it, he rapidly calculated that the sum meant something between
four and five hundred pounds.</p>

<p>They all agreed&mdash;they were all anxious to&mdash;that this
accounted for everything. Anthony had had an appointment with some
wealthy client, whom he had gone over to meet. But why had he said
nothing about it? Mr. Journ&eacute;e was very perplexed. So far as
he knew, his son had never sold a thing in his life, and this
seemed a vast sum for a novice. Of course, he was glad, glad, very
glad. It meant that he was wrong. There must be something in the
boy's work after all. At the same time he couldn't help feeling
that&mdash;well, he wished he hadn't gone off like that. He wasn't
sure that he wouldn't rather have had the boy stick by his wife and
not sell the picture, even at a loss to himself.</p>

<p>It was not till three days later that the letter came to Laura.
She did not show it to the others, but she tried to tell them the
gist of it. It seemed rather a confused description, affecting as
it did, various people they had not heard of. There appeared to be
an Italian countess, who was a sculptress and lived in Chelsea. She
had a great friend in Paris, another Italian woman, the wife of a
wealthy South American. She adored the "Vortex School," and had
bought works by Pinneti, Lammonde, and Sasha McFay, three of the
greatest exponents. It was she who had introduced Anthony to the
South American. He had been to stay with them at Fontainebleau. The
outcome was the sale. She was likely to buy more. He hoped to
return the following week&mdash; There was nothing more in the
letter that Laura quoted, and it was the quick eye of Mr.
Journ&eacute;e that detected a tear hovering near her lash as she
finished.</p>

<p>"Damn the boy!" he thought as he turned away.</p>

<h3>XII</h3>

<p>Who were all these people, Pinneti, Lammonde, Sasha McFay? What
in God's name was the Vortex School? Why was Anthony running about
the Continent with Italian countesses, when he should be dancing
attendance on his wife? Mr. Journ&eacute;e was seriously alarmed.
The act seemed to mark the first definite line of cleavage between
his son's life and his own. He recalled vividly the night when
Anthony was born. He was out of work at the time, and they were
living in poor lodgings in Kentish Town. He had only a few pounds
in the world. He remembered his feverish pacing of the streets, his
tearing anxiety, his complete sense of helplessness. He ate nothing
for twenty-four hours. He remembered in a spasmodic fit of
abstraction, going out late in the afternoon and selling a marble
clock that had been given him by an uncle as a wedding present, for
fifteen shillings. He remembered turning the fifteen shillings over
in his hand, staring hard at it, regarding it
lovingly&mdash;another tiny bulwark to protect his wife's life. He
remembered his reward&mdash;that blinding ecstasy in the early
hours of a Sunday morning. She was well, well, and the child
lived&mdash;nothing else mattered! He had got work soon after and
their marital bliss had not been obscured for one hour.</p>

<p>And Anthony? Was it just Anthony, or was it the gesture of this
modern generation that had lost the sense of tradition? From what
he could see of them, looking around, they seemed to be thin,
evanescent people, irreverent, respecting neither themselves, nor
others, nor the past. They lived in postures, and phrases, and a
kind of morbid self-analysis unconnected with life. It was
deplorable. He had never met these people except by hearsay and
books and the theatre. He had hardly accepted them as reality. It
had taken his son's defection to bring home to him the truth that
such people lived.</p>

<p>Amidst the shavings, the smell of wood, and the sound of mallets
striking gouges, he decided that he would have it out with Anthony
when he returned. Unfortunately it was a full week before this
happened, and by that time his anger&mdash;as usual&mdash;had
abated. He yearned for his son, and wanted to see him again.</p>

<p>Anthony returned nonchalantly, as though his behaviour had been
quite normal. He went in to see his wife and child, and later in
the evening the two families sat round Laura's bed, and he became
quite eloquent. It was true that he only talked about himself, but
the father could not resent a sneaking pride in his son. There was
about him a certain richness of personality, a definite promise of
distinction. He was no ordinary young man. The world, so hard to
others, had to make allowances for such a creature. He had sold two
other pictures to this Madame Forzamba, the wife of the South
American. He had returned enriched by over a thousand pounds!</p>

<p>He did not seem to regard it as very remarkable, merely the
natural due to his genius. He said nothing about repaying his
father, or making other arrangements for his family. He took a
perfunctory interest in the baby, and said he should like to see it
painted by Lammonde.</p>

<p>The next morning he was at his studio, working feverishly. He
never went to his father's workshop, or inquired what he was doing.
The next evening he went to Chelsea and did not get home till three
in the morning.</p>

<p>This went on for several days. He spent an hour or two with his
wife, but finding that she was most inconveniently bedridden for
the time being, he dined out in the evening and came home late.
When with the family he sat around like one doped. He gazed at the
poorly furnished rooms, and could hardly conceal the expression of
disgust upon his face. It was apparent that he was in an atmosphere
entirely uncongenial and distasteful to him. His mind was wandering
elsewhere. On the fourth evening, Mr. Journ&eacute;e met him going
out. He went straight up to him and said:</p>

<p>"Anthony, come over to the shop. I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>There was a hard drawn line about the father's mouth. They
walked over in silence and went upstairs. The men had gone. Mr.
Journ&eacute;e lighted a gas-jet and said:</p>

<p>"Sit down."</p>

<p>They were both terribly self-conscious, as between two men fond
of each other, but separated by a wide gulf of unfamiliar
experience. After a time Mr. Journ&eacute;e said:</p>

<p>"Anthony boy, I don't think&mdash;I don't think you're quite
playing the game. You went off like that and left Laura just when
she&mdash; We all feel it very much&mdash;your mother,
too&mdash;"</p>

<p>He coughed, and Anthony shifted uneasily in his seat. He said in
a weak voice:</p>

<p>"I had to. It was business, you know."</p>

<p>"I've never heard of you being interested in business before.
Talking of that, boy, I think now that you&mdash;that you
are&mdash;well, beginning to make a move. I think it's up to you to
keep your wife and child. Mother and I have been only too happy
that we could help a bit&mdash;you know, when you really needed it.
But business is not too good. We have to think of old age and
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes of course," said Anthony, and there was a meaningless,
non-committal pause. In Mr. Journ&eacute;e's voice there suddenly
came a more vibrant note.</p>

<p>"But, Anthony boy, I don't really care so much about that. It's
you I'm thinking of. This set you get in to. I know nothing about
it. Only I don't&mdash;I don't&mdash;I'd rather you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e became inarticulate. Under the flickering
light of the one gas-jet he could just see the dark, mocking eyes
of his son. And in the son's voice there crept a note of querulous
anger.</p>

<p>"You don't understand," he said, and stood up.</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e was about to reply, also on a note of anger.
Then he looked down at the blotting-paper on the desk in front of
him. After a pause he said resignedly:</p>

<p>"No, I suppose I don't understand."</p>

<p>He looked crumbled and careworn. Anthony edged towards the door.
The situation was intolerable. With his hand on the latch he
said:</p>

<p>"Good-night, father!"</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e did not look up. He replied quietly:</p>

<p>"Good-night!"</p>

<p>After he had gone, Mr. Journ&eacute;e continued to stare at the
blotting-paper. Once he mumbled to it:</p>

<p>"No, I suppose I don't understand."</p>

<p>Out in the street Anthony picked up a vagrant taxi. To the man
he cried angrily:</p>

<p>"Drive like blazes to the Caf&eacute; Royal!"</p>

<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>That Laura had some curious appeal for him was incontestable.
For a few weeks after she was up and about again he actually took
her to call on his friend, the Countess Strozzetti, at Chelsea. How
much he was influenced by the interview with his father it is
impossible to say. But in his own way he certainly gave evidence of
certain feelings of remorse at his behaviour. He was too proud or
too egoistic to say anything about it, but he paid more attention
to his wife. He bought her a necklace, and suggested that they
should take a house of their own in the neighbourhood. But this, of
course, raised the old difficulty of Mrs. McGrath. The old lady,
however, was overridden in her wishes by the other members of the
family. It was pointed out to her that it was only fair, since
Anthony was wishing to play the game, that he should be allowed a
home of his own. Moreover, being in the neighbourhood, Laura could
pop in every day for such time as she could spare from the
baby.</p>

<p>They, therefore, rented a seven-roomed semi-detached house less
than half a mile away, and at the next quarter-day Anthony wrote
quite a polite note to his father and said that he thought he
should be able to manage all right now, and at the same time he
thanked him for all his kindness in the past. It was the kind of
thing he could write to his father, but which he would have been
much too self-conscious to say. But the gesture alone made Mr.
Journ&eacute;e very happy. A good boy, Anthony, a splendid chap!
Just had his head a wee bit turned by this sudden and facile
success. Of course, he had never meant to act like that. Returning
from their guild meeting that night&mdash;where the paper had been
on "French engravings of the seventeenth and nineteenth
centuries"&mdash;Mr. Journ&eacute;e discussed it with Justin.</p>

<p>"What I object to about these new-fangled movements is just that
very thing; it has no relation to true values. When we started in,
old 'un, we were paid according to our worth&mdash;starting at
fivepence and sixpence an hour&mdash;this, mind you, after serving
a long apprenticeship without payment. We had to learn our
job&mdash;a recognised job with a tradition behind it. We didn't
suddenly make a thousand pounds like a stockbroker. To whom can a
painting of a beginner like Anthony possibly be worth four hundred
pounds or more? It's an artificial growth on the side of true
art."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e was rather pleased with this last phrase, and
he repeated it. And Justin, knocking his pipe out against a
lamp-post, said:</p>

<p>"Yes, not only on the side of art, too, Paul; on the side of
society. It is impossible to teach this younger generation that
nothing comes out of the blue. They believe it does. Sometimes they
snatch something out of the blue. They think they've found the
divine afflatus. Instead of that it's a thunderbolt, and it
destroys them. We've linked up, you see, linked up with the dead
and&mdash;the unborn."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e accompanied his friend home. They found Mrs.
McGrath sitting by the fireside knitting.</p>

<p>"Well, Nancy," said Mr. Journ&eacute;e, "how are&mdash;" he was
about to say "the children," but feeling that it might be an
embarrassing question he altered it to "things?"</p>

<p>Mrs. McGrath had a queer puzzled look on her face. She said with
what was for her considerable animation:</p>

<p>"Anthony has taken Laura out to a party&mdash;some of his
friends in Chelsea."</p>

<p>The two fathers looked at each other. They could not have
appeared more surprised if Mrs. McGrath had informed them that he
had taken her to the South Pole. Mr. McGrath sat there with his
mouth open. Mr. Journ&eacute;e was about to utter an exclamation
but thought better of it. He yawned, and said casually:</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nice&mdash;that's very nice."</p>

<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>Anthony explained to his wife that it wasn't a party they were
going to, it was just a "studio evening." One didn't have to dress.
She had never heard of a "studio evening," and she didn't like to
ask what it meant. Nevertheless, she felt all agog, a little
flustered and nervous, but terribly proud that Anthony should
condescend to take her to meet his friends. She wore her best
frock, and examined her face carefully in the mirror. It was some
time since she had taken such a close personal interest in her own
face. She noticed the little sharp-cut lines developing beneath her
eyes, the tiny cracks along the brow, the slightly puffy chin. It
was no good. She was beginning to show her age. And yet she felt
happy and high-spirited. There was nothing to be ashamed of in
getting old. She thought of a child's book illustration she had
seen years ago. "Jane is a good girl and has a kind face." Perhaps
she looked like that.</p>

<p>She had, in any case, a handsome and clever husband, a child, a
home. One couldn't expect everything.</p>

<p>They arrived at the studio just before ten, and there were
already about twenty people there. The first thing that struck her
was that their hostess, a large dark, rather handsome woman, with a
suspicion of down on her upper lip, called Anthony "Pan." Her
greeting was:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Pan! Good egg!" and then catching sight of Laura, she
said: "Is this the wife? How nice!"</p>

<p>She shook hands, and, without waiting for any further greeting,
she continued:</p>

<p>"Lobby is being perfectly absurd. He keeps on giving an
imitation of Sarah Bernhardt, and it's no more like her than it is
like George Robey. I wish you'd shut him up, Pan."</p>

<p>When Laura had had time to focus the room and the company, she
found herself in a most astounding environment. Several women were
sitting straddle-legged on cushions on the floor, drinking coffee
or beer; others were lolling on ottomans or against easels.
Everyone seemed to be leaning against something. There was a loud
buzz of talk, frequently broken by strident laughter. A
swarthy-looking Jewish man, in a black shirt and a black scarf with
no apparent collar, was talking to a thin woman with a dead white
face and carmine lips. A fierce-looking man, with a square blond
beard, was striking his left palm with his right fist and
declaiming:</p>

<p>"My dear nincompoop, James Branch Cabell is not a romanticist.
He's a mountebank."</p>

<p>A large-eyed young man listening to him appeared to be about to
burst into tears. A pretty woman, who looked like a mischievous
linnet, with bright eyes, caught hold of Anthony and said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Pan, how are you, darling?"</p>

<p>She was about to dart away without waiting for an answer, when
Anthony grabbed her. He said:</p>

<p>"Come here, you little devil! This is my wife. Laura, this is
Gina Cherbourg, one of the worst adventuresses in London!"</p>

<p>Gina squealed with laughter, and held out her hand to Laura.</p>

<p>"Nice!" she said. "Have some coffee?"</p>

<p>Laura felt it incumbent upon her to try and adapt herself to her
surroundings. She said:</p>

<p>"Yes, I'd like some, please."</p>

<p>The linnet darted away, but she was caught by two young men in
plus fours, one of whom was wearing a monocle. It looked curiously
out of place. He said to the linnet:</p>

<p>"Darling, I haven't seen you for a week. Keep still. I want to
make love to you."</p>

<p>The other young man turned away, as though this type of
conversation bored him. Catching sight of Anthony, who was standing
at his elbow, he grunted:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Pan!"</p>

<p>Anthony said: "Look after my wife a minute. I want to talk to
Bistowe."</p>

<p>The young man turned to Laura and gave a stiff little bow. He
looked at her closely, and she was fully conscious of having his
entire disapproval. She could see him desperately trying to think
of something to say. At last he said:</p>

<p>"Do you know the Challices?"</p>

<p>"No," said Laura.</p>

<p>This reply also seemed to meet with his disapproval. He
said:</p>

<p>"We had an awful binge there last night."</p>

<p>Laura didn't know what a "binge" was, but she said politely
enough:</p>

<p>"Really!"</p>

<p>After that the conversation lapsed. She saw Anthony across the
room, the centre of a group. She couldn't hear what he was saying,
but he was making them all laugh. He seemed to be imitating
someone's broken English. A large man, with a walrus moustache, was
splitting with laughter, and kept slapping Anthony on the back and
exclaiming: "Good! good! excellent!"</p>

<p>The linnet had forgotten all about Laura's coffee, but a
schoolboy, very proud of his office, was handing round cakes. He
offered her some and she said:</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," and took a piece.</p>

<p>After a considerable interval of neglect, the hostess came up to
her with a thin, sad-faced man who looked terribly ill. She
said:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Journ&eacute;e, I want to introduce you to an old friend
of your husband's, Bernard Ossip. Bernard, this is Pan's wife!"</p>

<p>The melancholy man looked doubtfully at his hostess and
said:</p>

<p>"I didn't know he had a wife"; then, taking her hand, which he
squeezed very hard between his bony fingers, he exclaimed: "Well,
I'm damned!"</p>

<p>They were left alone, and he continued:</p>

<p>"Paint at all?"</p>

<p>"No, not at all."</p>

<p>He nodded, as much as to imply that anyone could see that. Then
he appeared to rouse himself from his stupor, and said with a
degree of animation:</p>

<p>"Your husband's a genius. I was with him in Paris. We shared an
apartment in the Rue Visconti."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course," said Laura, who seemed now to have vaguely
heard the name Ossip mentioned once. Anthony's friend
proceeded:</p>

<p>"Have you seen the Sasha McFay's at Ryders?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "not yet."</p>

<p>He nodded again, as though realising that he had asked a foolish
question. After a pause he said: "I don't know whether Pan told
you. I've been very bad, you know&mdash;kidneys; doctor thought I
had Bright's disease."</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>am</i> sorry," said Laura, really meaning it.</p>

<p>"It pulls you down so. Anything to do with the kidneys is always
depressing. You have to stick to a diet&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was about to enter into further details about his kidneys,
when a girl in a jade green frock went to the piano, and sang a
French song. It was charmingly done, and the company all laughed at
the various sallies. Laura laughed too. It was funny, it was all
very funny, but&mdash;why had Anthony married her?</p>

<p>She caught sight of his handsome face, silhouetted against a
dark curtain. He was so very much at home here, so different, so
animated, so happy. These people understood him, and liked him. It
wasn't all his fault, poor boy! What was she going to do? She could
never fit in. It was an utterly different world she found herself
in, and it was Anthony's world. It couldn't be helped.</p>

<p>Going home in the cab he did not seem dissatisfied with her. He
did not say much, but he was in good spirits. He had drunk quite a
number of glasses of <i>cr&ecirc;me-de-menthe</i>, and he kissed
her rather sloppily on the lips. She made no protest.</p>

<p>The next morning her mother said:</p>

<p>"Well, dear, what was it like?"</p>

<p>She replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, it was very amusing, mother. Very different, you know, very
different from&mdash;what we are used to."</p>

<h3>XV</h3>

<p>One late September morning, Mr. Journ&eacute;e awakened with a
twinge of rheumatism in his left shoulder. It was a melancholy day,
with the rain coming down in torrents.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" he thought, "and soon we shall have winter here!
Seven or eight months of it!"</p>

<p>And suddenly his mind reverted to the old desire&mdash;Italy! At
that moment the sun would be gilding the dome of St. Mark's. The
little church of San Miracule, which he had studied so often in
photographs, would be trembling with light against the deep blue
sky. The peasant women in their black shawls would be flocking into
the Baptistery at Florence. The maize fields would be a blaze of
gold. Well, why not? The years of physical enjoyment were numbered.
Anthony was getting on. He had sold two more of his extraordinary
pictures. He was no longer dependent on his father.</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e got up, rubbed his shoulder with ointment,
washed himself, and went down to breakfast. So optimistic did he
suddenly feel that he said to his wife:</p>

<p>"Mother, what do you say? why shouldn't we do that little trip
to Italy?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Journ&eacute;e was never at her best in the early morning.
The servants hadn't been able to get the fire to go, and the bacon
was burnt, the boy had left a white loaf&mdash;Mr. Journ&eacute;e
always had to have brown&mdash;and there was a bill from a
dressmaker. She said:</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk such nonsense, Paul."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e made allowances. They had been married for
twenty-seven years, and he had, perhaps, talked too much about this
trip to Italy&mdash;talked and done nothing. There always seemed
some obstacle. And on a morning like this, with the rain pouring
down, and all the petty frictions of domestic life, it seemed as
remote as ever.</p>

<p>In the evening, however, he broached the subject again. It was
feasible. He could afford it. They were not very busy, and Lintot
could manage while he was away. Over her sewing Mrs. Journ&eacute;e
pondered the problem carefully. As a young girl it had been her
wildest dream to go to Italy with Paul. The idea no longer excited
her. She was happy in her home, and travelling frightened her. But
still&mdash;if <i>he</i> wanted to go, why, yes, yes, of course.
There was no longer Anthony to consider. It would doubtless do Paul
good. She said:</p>

<p>"It would be lovely, dear."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e bought a Baedeker, a map, and got together a
collection of travel bureau circulars. He worked the whole thing
out carefully in detail: Paris, Milan, Verona, Venice; then to
Florence, Sienna, Rome, and back to Genoa. They would start at the
end of the month.</p>

<p>During the following weeks Mr. Journ&eacute;e walked about as
though in a dream. He was like a schoolboy with the end of term
approaching. One evening he was sitting in his workshop, after the
men had gone, going into his accounts. There was a sudden knock at
the door, the click of the latch, and Justin came hurrying in. One
glance at his face, and Mr. Journ&eacute;e could see that his
friend was in trouble. He instinctively stood up. Justin came
straight up to him and said:</p>

<p>"Paul, Paul, I'm in for it!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter, old man?"</p>

<p>"My workshops were burnt down last night, and, my God, I'd
forgotten to send the insurance money last week! I'm ruined,
Paul!"</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e stood erect, and looked very solemn. He
patted his friend's shoulder. "Good God!" he muttered. "Not
insured, eh?"</p>

<p>He took one or two paces up and down and came back. "What can I
do, old man?"</p>

<p>"Can you lend me two hundred and fifty pounds, Paul? I'll pay
you back one day."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e passed his hand through his hair. After a
brief pause and said:</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>He did not tell his wife about this when he got home. He could
not lend &pound;250 and go to Italy as well. The situation was
grave. Poor old Justin! Another vague hope crept to the back of his
mind. Anthony! It was the boy's father-in-law, and, after all, he
was doing very well now. Perhaps he might help the old man a
little. Why shouldn't he?</p>

<p>After supper Mr. Journ&eacute;e said he was going out for a
stroll. He put on his hat, and took a bus. He found Laura alone
making some mysterious baby garment. He kissed her, and after the
usual formalities, said:</p>

<p>"Where's Anthony?"</p>

<p>Laura bent over her work, and speaking with perfect control,
replied:</p>

<p>"Anthony? Oh, he's gone off to Italy with some friends of
his."</p>

<p><i>Italy!</i>...</p>

<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>Anthony wrote to Laura from Italy. He described Venice as "a
common little bourgeois swamp, overrun with trippers." Florence
bored him. Rome was on a par with Birmingham. He seemed to spend
most of his time at Milan, studying some new school of painting
that had sprung up there. Though with whom he had gone, and with
whom he was staying, he did not reveal.</p>

<p>He was away four months, and the trip might be described as
Anthony's last phase. Further successes, both financial and social,
had come to him. He became frankly egocentric, a creature living in
abstractions that recognised no moral or social code. Laura never
told him of her father's loss, and when Mr. Journ&eacute;e, trying
to sympathise with her in her position, deplored what he called
"the set" that the boy had drifted into, she turned on him very
fiercely. "After all," she said, "they are his people. They
understand him and like him. It is the world he belongs to."</p>

<p>She hid her grief in the little claims of her home, and the
laughter of her son. And Mr. Journ&eacute;e hid his in his work,
and in the genial satisfaction of setting an old friend on his
feet. He still did his breathing exercises, smoked his pipe, and
walked in the park. The air seemed sweet and good. The little
grandson was an eternal joy&mdash;"People have queer ways of
seeking happiness," he said at random one day to old Justin.</p>

<p>When Anthony eventually returned, the change in him was apparent
and striking. From the shy, self-conscious young man, he had
developed into a cynical poseur. He was superficial, patronising,
and bored. Laura was a middle-aged matron, slopping about the
house. He found his home disgusting&mdash;all baby and cooking. He
met the family in the evening, and talked languidly of his
experiences and successes. The names of countesses and men of
genius were ever on his lips. At the same time he seemed afraid to
be alone with his father. Mr. Journ&eacute;e asked him over to the
shop to have a talk. He promised to go, but never turned up. He
disappeared a few days later. And the mind of Laura registered this
reflection:</p>

<p>"He will never come back. It was wicked of me to have married a
man seven years younger than I."</p>

<p>She went about her work with calm deliberation. Colin was going
to be a splendid boy&mdash;</p>

<p>It was nearly two years, however, before the inevitable
happened. He came occasionally, and would sometimes send her a
spasmodic cheque. And then one day there came a letter, obviously
dictated by a lawyer, and enclosing a receipted hotel bill. She was
glad that no one was present when the letter came. She turned quite
white, and put it in her chatelaine. That evening she called on Mr.
Journ&eacute;e at his shop, and showed him the letter. The old man
put on his spectacles and read it, his hands trembling. And he took
her in his arms and held her close. There seemed nothing to say.
They were just two creatures clinging together in the darkness for
support.</p>

<p>"He wants me to divorce him, so I suppose I must," Laura
reflected, but she did not discuss the matter with her family. She
went to a lawyer and asked for the thing to be done as quietly and
quickly as possible. It took a year, however, for the formalities
to be arranged, and by that time Anthony was something of a
notoriety, the divorce was mentioned in all the daily papers.</p>

<p>The climax filled Mr. Journ&eacute;e with dull anger, like an
outrage on his own personal pride. It seemed in some strange way
incomprehensible, meaningless. He brooded upon it all day. And when
the men had gone in the evening he poured out his troubles to old
Lintot.</p>

<p>"I feel I'm wrong, Lintot. I'm somehow responsible. What have I
done that makes me deserve this. He was a good boy. I educated him.
I did what I thought was the very best always for him. It seemed as
though he couldn't be happy. He hadn't the faculty. I doubt whether
he's happy now. Whether he ever could be&mdash;that's the great
trouble."</p>

<p>Old Lintot regarded his master thoughtfully. A dank cigarette
hung from the corner of his heavily bearded mouth. He twisted it
and wriggled it from one side to the other. At last he put on his
hat and shuffled towards the door. With his hand on the latch, he
turned and said in a melancholy voice:</p>

<p>"A man who doesn't believe in things, guv'nor, never finds
happiness."</p>

<p>He added: "Good-night!" rather jerkily, as though afraid to
trust his voice.</p>

<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>Believe in things! Was the old man right? Was that perhaps just
the trouble? You can educate the mind, but you cannot educate the
heart. You can believe in things yourself, but can you teach others
to do so? The boy had been bored with Italy! Italy? no, he knew
that he would never go there now. The time had passed. But he could
still walk with Leonardo through the squares of Florence. He could
gaze reverently at the Duomo, and listen to the chanting of
priests. He could be at one with all the masters of the past,
because, without knowing, he desired so much to contribute in his
humble way to their tradition. And at night he could creep through
the olive groves, and gaze up at the stars, and feel the majesty of
life pour through him. Across the valley he could hear the silver
tinkle of a bell in some remote campanile. And he could be happy,
because he loved it all, the beauty of the world, and the great
soul that moved behind its mysterious purposes.</p>

<p>He thought that he would never see his son again, but he did
just once. It was five years later, and he came to borrow money. He
had married a French woman, and was living at Mentone. The Vortex
School was a little out of date. He had been gambling, and got into
the hands of money-lenders. His rich friends seemed to have
deserted him. In a state of despair he had come to London, and
sought out his father. He called at the workshop, quite casually
one evening, as though it were the most ordinary thing in the world
to call and borrow &pound;500. His face was lined, haggard, and
furtive. Mr. Journ&eacute;e had often visualised the coming of his
son. He had rehearsed in his mind the things he meant to say. He
had not forgotten Laura's dictum: "After all, they are his people.
They understand him, and like him. It is the world he belongs to."
He had meant to be magnanimous, forgiving. We can none of us quite
help being what we are, perhaps.</p>

<p>But with his son before him, he could think of none of the
things he wished to say. There arose between them again that solid
wall of unfamiliar experience. He felt that anything he said the
young man would either not understand, or consider banal and
worthless. His clever sophisticated face rebelled any approach to
emotional comprehension. He talked glibly of certain vague
securities, and spoke of the loan as of a quite temporary
arrangement. Mr. Journ&eacute;e lent him &pound;100. He could not
afford more. He had been keeping Laura for years, and there was the
grandson's future to consider. He did not resent this. The
responsibility enlarged his horizon. He accepted Anthony's worth at
Laura's valuation. But he would not give him more than a
hundred.</p>

<p>Just as he was going he noticed a strange expression on his
son's face. He looked around the workshop, at the carved panels and
friezes, the charcoal drawings, and the workmen's tools. He seemed
to sniff the wood, and suddenly gave his father a keen hungry
glance. And in that glance the father became aware of a salient
fact. <i>The boy was envious of him!</i> Not only that, but
somewhere deep down in him he loved his father. He had drugged the
passion, but it was there.</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e wanted to say: "Anthony, my boy, speak to me.
Tell me all about yourself. What are you really thinking? What are
you really feeling? Speak to me! Speak to me!"</p>

<p>But he merely blotted and handed him the cheque. The young man
took it and put it in his pocket-book, with a hang-dog air. He
said:</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully, father," and shuffled towards the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e watched him go. He heard the latch click, and
the door shut. Then he heard the footsteps clattering down the
iron-clamped stairs. When the footsteps had nearly reached the
bottom, he suddenly raised his head and cried hoarsely: "Anthony!
come back!...Come back!"</p>

<p>But he heard the front door shut, and the footsteps die away
across the yard. And the old man buried his face in his hands.</p>

<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>Colin was ten years old. He went to school. On Sundays he always
accompanied his two grandfathers on their weekly walk in Regent's
Park. He had accepted the familiar explanation about his father
having "gone on a long journey" with complete acquiescence. He
seldom asked about him now. Laura also found that she could talk
about her husband dispassionately. She rather liked to talk about
him to Mr. Journ&eacute;e. She could see that the old man was still
troubled, and it somehow helped him to hear her talk about his son.
She called him "Father Paul." Once when he was deploring the boy's
behaviour, she said:</p>

<p>"I can't altogether blame him, Father Paul. We are all made
differently. It's a curious thing that on those few occasions when
he took me out to visit those friends of his, I liked him better
than at any other time. He was quite natural there, and, somehow,
so charming and entertaining. I could not mix with his friends, and
he knew it. It was unfortunate that he&mdash;well, that he married
me, more than anything else. He loved me in a way. I fitted in with
a certain mood. He needed me. But love with him was not a personal
thing so much as a condition. He slipped out of that mood and he
didn't need me. The trouble with him was that&mdash;unlike
you&mdash;he had no faculty for happiness."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e regarded her thoughtfully. Happiness! that
was just what old Lintot had said. Something like that&mdash;about
believing in things. He said: "You're a brave girl, Laura."</p>

<p>One October, Mrs. Journ&eacute;e got her feet wet marketing. The
next day she developed a chill, which lasted for some days. It was
practically cured, when, probably through cleaning out a cupboard
in a draughty loft, it recurred with renewed violence. The
following night she developed pneumonia, and a doctor was sent for.
For days she lay in a critical condition.</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e's distress was pitiful to watch. He would
sometimes dart over to his workshop, but in half an hour he would
be back. He wandered about the house helplessly, picking things up
and putting them down again. He would go into his wife's bedroom,
clutch her hand, and murmur:</p>

<p>"Well, mother?"</p>

<p>He would look at the medicine bottles, and finger them
nervously, as though appealing to them, or accusing them of
inertia. Then he would wander about the room on tiptoe, making
curious little noises of distress like a wounded animal.</p>

<p>Laura&mdash;who at that time had given up her house, and was
living with her parents again&mdash;came in and took up her abode.
She relieved the night nurse, who had been called in. On the second
day the doctor said to her:</p>

<p>"The situation is very grave."</p>

<p>At dinner-time that day Mr. McGrath called to make inquiries. As
he was leaving he said to Laura:</p>

<p>"I see in the paper, my dear, that Anthony is in London. Look!
he is staying with&mdash;with his wife at this address."</p>

<p>Laura mechanically looked at the paper. After her father had
gone this information that Anthony was in London kept interrupting
her thoughts. Anthony no longer meant anything to her that
mattered. But this was his mother. It was of Mr. Journ&eacute;e
that she kept thinking. There was Anthony within a cab ride of his
dying mother. There was Mr. Journ&eacute;e blindly groping for
comfort and sympathy from all the world...</p>

<p>When evening came she had arrived at a decision. The night nurse
relieved her at eight o'clock. She would put her pride in her
pocket and go to him. When she was leaving she looked in on Mr.
Journ&eacute;e who was standing in front of a neglected fire in the
dining-room. She kissed him and said:</p>

<p>"I may come back later, Father Paul."</p>

<p>He kissed her lightly, and answered in a preoccupied manner:</p>

<p>"No, no, my dear, you look so tired and pale. Go to bed! Go to
bed! It will be all right."</p>

<p>She pressed his arm and said confidently: "You must still
believe, Father Paul. We expect you to believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>She went away hurriedly, and after a search she found a cab, and
told the driver to go to a certain address on Chelsea Embankment.
The evening was cold and foggy. The cab crept round corners, and
was continually being blocked in the traffic. The journey seemed
interminable. She set her teeth and clutched the window strap.</p>

<p>At last they pulled up at a little white house. She paid the
driver, and he began to abuse her because she only gave him a
threepenny tip. She blushed confusedly. She was so unaccustomed to
taking cabs that she did not know. She wanted to say: "Please,
please, not to-night&mdash;"</p>

<p>She hurriedly gave him another shilling, and went up to the door
and rang the bell. After a time the door was opened by a
solemn-looking butler. She asked for Mr. Anthony Journ&eacute;e.
The man had a strange scared expression on his face.</p>

<p>He seemed uncertain how to act. He let her in and left her
standing in the hall without a word. The house seemed to smell of
some curious odour she could not recognize. In a room on the right
she heard a woman behaving hysterically. She was left alone for two
or three minutes, and then two burly-looking men came out to her.
They ushered her into another room, and looked at her searchingly.
The elder said:</p>

<p>"Will you tell me who you are, madam?"</p>

<p>She answered quickly: "Does it matter? I have come from Mr.
Journ&eacute;e's father. His mother is seriously ill."</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other, and the same speaker replied
quietly:</p>

<p>"Mr. Anthony Journ&eacute;e is dead! He was murdered this
afternoon by a woman!"</p>

<p>Laura was conscious of some strong underlying power forcing her
to a surprising degree of control. She thought instinctively of her
son, and then of old Mr. Journ&eacute;e pacing that lonely room in
front of the neglected fire. There were others to fight for. She
must not think of herself.</p>

<p>As he spoke the man handed her a card, and she just glimpsed the
fact that he was a police inspector. She felt terribly undecided
how to act&mdash;what to ask. She heard the voices of a man and
woman almost screaming at each other in the hall. The door opened
abruptly. The man and woman entered. The man was a foreigner of
some sort, with a sallow skin, and a black moustache. The woman was
also obviously a foreigner, with a dead white skin, and unnaturally
glittering eyes, which she was mopping with a handkerchief. She was
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"I don't believe it! I don't believe it! I was at Amalfi all the
time. He never met her there&mdash;"</p>

<p>She caught sight of Laura, and ejaculated: "Oh, mon Dieu!"</p>

<p>The man was saying:</p>

<p>"I don't know, Mimi. Why do you bully me? It is only the
Contesse's word&mdash;"</p>

<p>The two police inspectors stood up. Suddenly the woman looked at
Laura again, a new light coming into her eyes. She screamed
out:</p>

<p>"Oh, how funny! Do you know who this is? This is his
wife&mdash;his first wife!"</p>

<p>She went off into hysterical laughter, and snapped her fingers
in Laura's face. The scent from the handkerchief mingled with that
other more penetrating smell. The man, the woman, and the police
inspectors all seemed to be talking at the same time. She heard
unfamiliar names flung about, threats, menaces. Out of the
confusion she sensed some sordid episode, which is generously
spoken of as the <i>crime passionelle</i>. The whole thing seemed
terribly unreal. It was as though she had stepped from moving
reality straight into a film.</p>

<p>She turned to the police inspector as to the one stable thing in
a reeling world, and said quite calmly:</p>

<p>"I presume I may go?"</p>

<p>Her placidity appeared to anger the Frenchwoman. She spat at
her, abused her, and called her names. The two inspectors
intervened, and ushered her quickly from the room.</p>

<p>When out in the air she nearly fainted. She rested for a time on
an embankment seat, and watched the river.</p>

<p>"So that was the end of it," she thought. "My poor Anthony!"</p>

<p>She choked back a little sob, the only personal indulgence she
had allowed herself that night, and hailed a cab.</p>

<p>She found Mr. Journ&eacute;e up, and when she saw him she knew
that he had good news. He clutched her hands, and said eagerly:</p>

<p>"Laura, Laura girl, the doctor says he thinks the crisis is
past. She will get better, please God!"</p>

<p>She stayed with him an hour, watching him gradually calm
down.</p>

<p>"Poor Father Paul!" she thought, "your anguish for the night is
not yet over."</p>

<p>It would be in all the papers in the morning. Even if he did not
see it, someone would tell him. It were better that she told him
herself.</p>

<p>When he seemed quite calm, she said softly:</p>

<p>"Father Paul, I have bad news for you."</p>

<p>She got up and turned the light very low. She somehow felt that
it was easier to say what she had to in the dark. Going close up to
him and resting her face on his shoulder, she said:</p>

<p>"Anthony is dead!"</p>

<p>And then she wept tempestuously. She made no attempt to restrain
her tears. She wanted him to feel that she relied on him. That the
pity for himself would be submerged in that greater pity of which
he had so inexhaustible a store.</p>

<p>When she had spent herself she lay inertly against him ready to
succour him in any way he needed. They remained silent for a long
while. At last he sighed and murmured:</p>

<p>"That fellow was right, you know, Laura, that fellow was
right."</p>

<p>"What fellow, Father Paul?"</p>

<p>"That fellow who said, 'Each man kills the thing he loves.'
Come, my dear, kiss me good-night."</p>

<h3>XIX</h3>

<p>It was Colin's twelfth birthday, and five other children were
invited to the birthday party. There was a great to-do. The
tea-table was laden with cakes and bonbons. In the centre was a
large cake covered with pink icing on which was modelled in white,
"C. J., 12 years."</p>

<p>Mr. Journ&eacute;e had come home very early. He was in a great
state of excitement, running from one room to another, calling
out:</p>

<p>"Now then, mother, anything I can do, my dear? Where are those
candles? Colin, Colin! God bless my soul! I don't believe the boy
has washed his face yet! Scaramouche! Come along, hurry up! They'll
all be here soon. What did I do with that parcel I brought in?
Laura, Laura! Have you seen a large brown-paper parcel?"</p>

<p>The children arrived, all a little shy of each other. They
glanced furtively at the cakes, and then at each other. The tea
began in almost sepulchral silence, so far as they were concerned.
Only Mr. Journ&eacute;e kept up a running fire of badinage. A
bonbon popped. A small girl began to giggle. One boy pushed another
off a chair (roars of laughter)! In a few minutes the fun was fast
and furious. The tea finished in a din, all the children wearing
paper caps. A move was made into the other room, and games began.
Coloured air-balloons were banged hither and thither, to the
detriment of sundry vases and pieces of furniture. They played
musical chairs and postman's knock, and a curious game invented by
Mr. Journ&eacute;e called "Squidge," in which everyone had to
imitate an animal of some sort.</p>

<p>Old Lintot came in later. He had a niece there, and he stood on
the fringe of the party smiling amusedly. Laura brought him some
tea, and talked to him.</p>

<p>Suddenly she said: "Look at Father Paul! Isn't he
wonderful?"</p>

<p>He was at that particular moment being an elephant, and two
small boys were riding on his back. His eyes were bright, and he
was totally immersed in the game. A few minutes later he was a lion
roaring under the piano. Old Lintot said:</p>

<p>"I've known him thirty-five years, Mrs. Laura."</p>

<p>He meditatively bit a piece of seed cake, and added:</p>

<p>"He's a genius, Mrs. Laura. If you know what I mean, he has the
greatest genius of all, the genius for happiness. He's not afraid
of letting himself feel things, even if they make him suffer. He is
always seeing, you know, what the old poet spoke of 'sermons in
stones, books in the running brooks, good in everything.' It's the
one thing really worth while. It's when a man loses the child in
himself that he goes wrong."</p>

<p>The old man flicked some crumbs from his beard, muttering:
"Excuse me!" Then he looked at Laura, as though doubting whether he
hadn't been a little tactless. He put down his teacup, and
said:</p>

<p>"Of course, it's no good blaming anyone. We are all fearfully
and wonderfully made,&mdash;a fine boy that of yours."</p>

<p>Laura suddenly plucked him by the sleeve.</p>

<p>"Come into the other room a moment, Mr. Lintot," she
whispered.</p>

<p>When they arrived there, she said:</p>

<p>"You have been such an old friend of&mdash;of everyone's, Mr.
Lintot. Did Father Paul ever tell you the little incident about
poor Anthony's will?"</p>

<p>"No, no. He did not."</p>

<p>"He left a will on half a sheet of notepaper. It was made many,
many years ago, when he was at the height of his success. He left
it with a lawyer. It simply said: 'I leave everything I may possess
when I die to my son Colin. May he be more like my father than like
me.' The lawyer told me he brought it to him one evening when he
was very drunk. He made him put it away in a safe, and promise to
act on it when he died."</p>

<p>Old Lintot nodded. He murmured:</p>

<p>"Ah! Yes, yes, I understand. Truth in the cup! It's very strange
how this 'leperous distilment' will sometimes make a man see truth
when all else fails. And has the lawyer acted on it?"</p>

<p>Laura shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Poor boy! his only legacy was debts and debts and debts. But,
oh! that little gesture flung out on a drunken night..."</p>

<p>"It made your father happy, I'll be bound."</p>

<p>"Yes, father always believed in him, you see."</p>

<p>The old man took her arm, leading her back to the party. His
voice was almost inaudible as he repeated:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, we're fearfully and wonderfully made. It's no good
blaming anyone&mdash;thank you for your confidence, Mrs.
Laura."</p>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>23. OLD IRON</h2>

<p>You know how the story goes, of course. Husband and wife just
about to retire to bed. Wife yawns, husband knocks out his pipe on
the grate and remarks:</p>

<p>"Well, better turn in, I suppose."</p>

<p>Wife replies:</p>

<p>"Yes"; then adds languidly:</p>

<p>"I meant to call round to ask the Cartwrights to dinner on
Thursday."</p>

<p>Husband, after prolonged pause:</p>

<p>"I'll pop round and ask them now, if you like. They never go to
bed till very late."</p>

<p>"I wish you would, dear."</p>

<p>Husband pulls on a cloth cap and goes out. Wife yawns again, and
picks up "The Ladies' Boudoir," and idly examines charmeuse gown,
and notes the prices of gloves at Foxtrot's &amp; Fieldfern's.
Yawns again more audibly. Collects sewing and places it in
work-basket. Takes the kitten out and locks it up in the scullery.
Yawns, and walks languidly upstairs. Turns on the light and spends
fifteen minutes examining face at various angles in the glass.
Begins to disrobe. Thinks sleepily: "Tom's a long time." Brushes
out her hair and admires it considerably. Conceives a new way of
dressing it for future festivities. Disrobes farther. Yawns.
Disrobes completely and re-robes&mdash;dressing-gown.</p>

<p>"It's too bad being all this time!"</p>

<p>Vitality slightly stirred in the direction of resentment and a
kind of mild apprehension. Lies on the bed and drowsily reviews the
experiences of the day. Dreams...Suddenly starts with a
consciousness of cold. Gropes for her wrist watch. <i>A quarter
past one!</i> Jumps from the bed, feeling the cold hand of fear on
her heart. Runs downstairs and stares helplessly out of the front
door. Pauses to consider a thousand possible eventualities. Returns
to bedroom and completely re-robes, not forgetting to do her hair
neatly and powder her nose. Puts on cloak and goes out.
Cartwright's house all in darkness. Bangs on the front door and
rings bell. Head of old Mr. Cartwright at first-floor window:</p>

<p>"Who's the devil that?"</p>

<p>"It's me! Where's Tom?"</p>

<p>"Tom! Haven't seen him for weeks!"</p>

<p>"Good God! Let me in."</p>

<p>Cartwright family aroused. Panic. Fainting scene in
drawing-room. Brandy, smelling-salts and eau-de-cologne. Young
George Cartwright mounts his bicycle&mdash;rides to the
police-station; on the way talks to policeman on point duty. No, no
one heard anything of a thin man with a snuff-coloured moustache.
At police-station, no accidents so far reported. Chief Inspector
will make a note and await developments. Night passes, and the
following day. No news.</p>

<p>Weeks, months, years elapse. Eight years slide easily by. The
wife survives her grief. She marries the local organist, a blond
and commendable young man. They continue to live in the wife's
house. Children gather round her knee. One, two, three, twins, an
interval, six, seven handsome blond children. They grow up.</p>

<p>Twenty-two years elapse. They are sitting at tea. The father,
the mother and the eldest son, a handsome young man in a grey
flannel suit. He kisses his mother and says:</p>

<p>"I must go now, mother dear. I have to take a Bible-class."</p>

<p>He goes out (presumably to the Bible-class). The mother smiles
with pride, the father glows with benignity and helps himself to
another buttered muffin. Everything perfect.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opens, and an old man in a long grey beard and
a perambulating manner wanders into the room. He stares at the
wife, and mumbles:</p>

<p>"Did you say Thursday or Friday?...My memory is not what it
was."...</p>

<p>And the wife stares at the old man, and then at the blond
organist. And the blond organist stares at the mother of his
beautiful children, and then at the bearded interloper. And they
all stare at each other and feel very embarrassed.</p>

<p>The story is familiar to you? Well, perhaps so. It is the story
of the eternal triangle, the most useful of geometrical forms in
the construction of a romantic pattern.</p>

<p>Heigho! the trouble with human triangles is that they are never
equilateral. Two sides together are invariably greater than the
third side.</p>

<p>Jim Canning was the third side of a triangle, and he got
flattened out. In fact, his wife used to flatten him out on every
possible occasion. She was bigger than he, and she was aided by the
<i>tertium quid</i>, Ted Woollams, who was nothing more or less
than a professional pugilist. What was Jim to do? In every
well-conducted epic the hero performs physical feats which leave
you breathless. He is always tall and strong, and a bit too quick
with the rapier for any villain who crosses his path. But what
about a hero who is small and elderly, of poor physique,
shortsighted, asthmatical, with corns which impede his gait? You
may say that he has no place in the heroic arena. He should clear
out, go and get on with his job, and leave heroism to people who
know how to manage the stuff. And yet there was something heroic in
the heart of Jim Canning: a quick sympathy, and an instinct for
self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>He used to keep a second-hand furniture shop, which, you must
understand, is a very different thing from an antique shop. Jim's
furniture had no determinate character such as that which goes by
the name of Chippendale, Sheraton or Heppelwhite. It was just
"furniture." Well-worn sofas, broken chairs and tables, mattresses
with the stuffing exuding from holes, rusty brass beds with the
knobs missing, broken pots and mirrors and dumbbells; even clothes,
and screws, false teeth and birdcages, and ancient umbrellas. But
his speciality was old iron. Trays and trays and baskets filled
with scraps of old iron.</p>

<p>His establishment used to be known in Camden Town at that time
as "The Muck Shop." At odd times of the day you might observe his
small pathetic figure trundling a barrow laden with the spoils of
some hard-pressed inhabitant. What a tale the little shop seemed to
tell! Struggle and poverty, homes broken up, drink, ugly passions,
desperate sacrifices&mdash;a battered array of the symbols of
distress. And, somehow, in his person these stories seemed to be
embodied. One felt that he was sorry for the people whose property
he bought. He was always known as a fair dealer. He paid a fair
price and never took advantage of ignorance.</p>

<p>His marriage was a failure from the very first. She was a big,
strapping woman, the daughter of a local greengrocer. Twelve years
younger than Jim, vain, frivolous, empty-headed and quarrelsome.
Her reasons for marrying him were obscure. Probably she had arrived
at the time when she wanted to marry, and Jim was regarded as a
successful shopkeeper who could keep her in luxury. He was blinded
by her physical attractions, and tried his utmost to believe that
his wife was everything to be desired. Disillusionment came within
the first month of their married life, at the moment, indeed, when
Clara realised that her husband's business was not so thriving as
she had been led to believe. She immediately accused him of
deceiving her. Then she began to sulk and neglect him. She despised
his manner of conducting business&mdash;his conscientiousness and
sense of fair dealing.</p>

<p>"If you'd put some ginger into it," she once remarked, "and not
always be thinking about the feelings of the tripe you buy from, we
might have a house in the Camden Road and a couple of
servants."</p>

<p>This had never been Jim's ambition. Many years ago he had
attended a sale at Shorwell Green, on the borders of Sussex, a
glorious spot near the downs, amidst lime-trees and little running
streams. It had been the dream of his life that one day he would
retire there, with the woman he loved&mdash;and her children. When
he put the matter to Clara, she laughed him to scorn.</p>

<p>"Not half!" she said. "Catch me living among butterflies and
blinking cows. The Camden Road is my game."</p>

<p>Jim sighed, and went on trundling his barrow. Well, there it
was! If the woman he had married desired it, he must do what she
wanted. In any case it was necessary to begin to save. But with
Clara he found it exceedingly difficult to begin to save. She idled
her day away, bought trinkets, neglected her domestic offices, went
to the pictures, and sucked sweets. Any attempt to point out to her
the folly of her ways only led to bitter recriminations, tears and
savage displays of temper, even physical violence to her
husband.</p>

<p>Then there came a day when Jim fondly believed that the
conditions of their married life would be ameliorated. A child was
born, a girl, and they called her Annie. Annie became the apple of
his eye. He would hurry back from the shop to attend at Annie's
bath. He would creep in at night and kiss the warm skin of her
little skull. He would think of her as he pottered around amidst
his broken chairs and tables, and utter little croons of
anticipatory pleasure. Annie! She would grow up and be the mainstay
of his life. He would work and struggle for her. Her life should be
a path of roses and happiness. For a time his wife, too, appeared
to improve upon the advent of Annie. The baby absorbed her. She
displayed a kind of wild animal joy in its existence. She nursed it
and fondled it, and did not seem to resent the curtailment of her
pleasures. It was an additional mouth to feed; nevertheless, their
expenses did not seem to greatly increase, owing probably to
Clara's modified way of living.</p>

<p>Four years of comparative happiness followed. Jim began to save.
Oh! very slowly; very, very slowly. He still had less than three
hundred pounds put on one side for&mdash;that vague future of
settled security. But still it was a solid beginning. In another
ten or fifteen years he would still be&mdash;well, not quite an old
man; an active man, he hoped. If he could save only one hundred
pounds a year!</p>

<p>It was at this point that Ted Woollams appeared on the scene. He
was the son of a manager of a Swimming Bath. On Sundays he used to
box in "Fairyland" for purses of various amounts&mdash;he was a
redoubtable middle-weight. During the week he swaggered about
Camden Town in new check suits, his fingers glittering with rings.
He met Clara one evening at a public dance. The mutual attraction
appears to have been instantaneous. They danced together the whole
evening, and he saw her home.</p>

<p>And then began the squeezing out of the third side of the
triangle. Jim was not strong enough for them. At first he professed
to see nothing in the friendship. He described Ted as "a jolly
young fellow, a great pal of my wife's." And Ted treated him with a
certain amount of respect. He called in at odd times, stayed to
meals, drank Jim's beer, and smoked Jim's tobacco. The triangle was
quite intact. It was Annie who caused the first disruption. She
disliked the prize-fighter, and screamed at the sight of him. This
led to reprisals when he had gone, and Jim's championship of the
child did not help to cement the always doubtful nature of the
affection between husband and wife. There were cross words and
tears, and once she pushed him over a chair, and, in the fall, cut
his temple.</p>

<p>A few days later, Ted Woollams called in a great state of
agitation. He wished to see Jim alone. It appeared that a wonderful
opportunity had occurred to him. It was a complicated story about a
quantity of bonded brandy which he had a chance of acquiring and
selling at an enormous profit. He wanted to borrow fifty pounds
till Saturday week, when he would pay Jim back sixty. Jim said he
would lend him the fifty, but he didn't want any interest.</p>

<p>When Saturday week came, Ted said the deal had fallen through,
but he would let him have the money back the following Saturday. In
the meantime he came to supper nearly every night. Sometimes he
drank too much beer.</p>

<p>Then Clara began to dress for the part. She bought expensive
frocks, and had the account sent in to Jim. She neglected the
child.</p>

<p>The months drifted by, and Ted was always going to pay, but he
became more and more part and parcel of the household. Jim's
savings began to dwindle. He protested to both his wife and Ted,
but they treated him with indifference. The boxer began to abuse
his familiarity. He would frequently tell Jim that he was not
wanted in the drawing-room after supper. When spoken to about the
money he laughed and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, you've got plenty, old 'un. Lend us another fiver."</p>

<p>On one occasion Jim was foolish enough to lend him another ten
pounds, under the spell of some heartrending story about a poor
woman in the street where Woollams lived. This lopsided triangle
held together for nearly four years. Jim was unhappy and
distracted. He did not know how to act. He could not leave his wife
for the sake of the child. If he turned her out&mdash;and he had no
legal power to do so&mdash;she would probably take Annie with her.
And the child was devoted to him. They were great friends, and it
was only this friendship which prevented him indulging in some mad
act. Several times he ordered Woollams out of the house and forbade
him to come again, but the boxer laughed at him and called him an
old fool. He knew that his wife was practically keeping the man.
They went to cinemas together, and often disappeared for the whole
day, but she always returned at night, although it was sometimes
two or three in the morning before she did so. Jim had no proof of
actual unfaithfulness. Neither could he afford to hire detectives,
a course of action which in any case appeared to him distasteful.
Far from saving a hundred pounds a year, he was spending more than
his income. His savings had dwindled to barely forty pounds. His
business was stagnant, but still he trundled his barrow hither and
thither, calling out, "Old iron! Old iron!" and he struggled to pay
the fair price.</p>

<p>During a great period of his life Jim had enjoyed an
unaccountable but staunch friendship with a gentleman named Isaac
Rubens. Isaac Rubens was a Jew in a slightly similar way of
business to himself, and he conducted a thriving business at the
corner of Holy Angel Road. Isaac was in many respects a very
remarkable man. Large, florid and puffy, with keen eagle eyes and
an enormous nose, he was a man of profound knowledge of the history
and value of <i>objets d'art</i>. He was, moreover, a man of his
word. He was never known to give or accept a written contract, and
never known to break a verbal one. The friendship between these two
was in many respects singular. Isaac was a keen man of business,
and Jim was of very little use to him. Isaac's furniture was the
real thing, with names and pedigrees. He did not deal in old iron
but in stones and jewels and ornaments. Nevertheless, he seemed to
find in Jim's society a certain pleasure. Jim would call on his
rounds and, leaving his barrow out in the road, would spend
half-an-hour or so chatting with the Jew across the counter.</p>

<p>Sometimes after supper they would call on each other and smoke a
pipe and discuss the vagaries of their calling, or the more
abstract problems of life and death.</p>

<p>When this trouble came upon Jim he immediately repaired to his
friend's house and told him the whole story.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! oh, dear! This is a bad business! a bad business!"
exclaimed Isaac, when it was over. His moist eyes glowed amidst the
general humidity of his face. "How can I advise you? An erring wife
is the curse of God. You cannot turn her away without knowledge.
Thank God, my Lena...But there! among my people such lapses are
rare. You have no evidence of unfaithfulness?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"You must be gentle with her, gentle but firm. Point out the
error of her ways."</p>

<p>"I am always doing that, Isaac."</p>

<p>"She may get over it&mdash;a passing infatuation. Such things
happen."</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for the child!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I understand. Oh, dear! oh, dear! very distressing,
my friend. If I can be of any assistance&mdash;"</p>

<p>He thrust out his large hands helplessly. It is the kind of
trouble in which no man can help another, and each knew it. Jim
hovered by the door.</p>

<p>"It's nice to have someone to&mdash;talk to, anyway," he
muttered; then he picked up his cap and shuffled away, calling
out:</p>

<p>"Old iron! Old iron!"</p>

<p>Annie was nine when the climax came. An intelligent, pretty
child, with dark hair and quick, impulsive manners. Her passionate
preference for her father did not tend to smooth the troubles of
the household. She attended the grammar-school and had many
girl-friends. She saw very little of her mother.</p>

<p>One evening Jim returned home late. He had been on a visit to
his friend, Isaac. He found Annie seated on the bottom stair, in
her nightdress. Her face was very pale and set, her eyes bright.
She had been crying. When she saw her father she gasped:</p>

<p>"Daddy!...Oh, Daddy!"</p>

<p>He seized her in his arms and whispered:</p>

<p>"What is it, my dear?"</p>

<p>Then she cried quietly while he held her. He did not attempt to
hurry her. At last she got her voice under control and gasped
quietly:</p>

<p>"I had gone to bed. I don't know why it was. I got restless in
bed. I came down again softly. I peeped into the sitting-room...Oh,
Daddy!"</p>

<p>"What? What, my love?"</p>

<p>"That man...that man and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He was kissing her and&mdash;oh!"</p>

<p>Jim clutched his child and pressed her head against his
breast.</p>

<p>"I went in...He <i>struck</i> me."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"He struck me because I wouldn't promise not to tell."</p>

<p>"He struck you, eh? He struck you! That man struck you, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Daddy."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"They're&mdash;up there now. I'm frightened."</p>

<p>"Go to bed, my love. Go to bed."</p>

<p>He carried her up the stairs and fondled her, and put her into
bed.</p>

<p>"It's all right, my love. Go to sleep. Pleasant dreams. It's all
right. Daddy will look after you."</p>

<p>Then he went downstairs.</p>

<p>A shout of laughter greeted him through the door of the
sitting-room. He gripped the handle and walked deliberately in. Ted
Woollams was stretching himself luxuriously on the sofa. His heavy
sensual face appeared puffy and a little mussed. Clara was lying
back in an easy chair, smoking a cigarette. Jim did not speak. He
walked up to Ted and without any preliminary explanation struck him
full on the nose with his clenched fist. For a moment the boxer
appeared more surprised than anything. His eyes narrowed, then the
pain of the blow appeared to sting him. He rose from the sofa with
a growl. As he advanced upon Jim, the latter thought:</p>

<p>"He's going to kill me. What a fool I was not to strike him with
a poker!"</p>

<p>He thrust out his arms in an ineffectual defence. There was
something horribly ugly, ugly and revolting in the animal-like
lurch of the man bearing down on him...the demon of an inevitable
doom. Jim struck wildly at the other's arms, at the same time
thinking:</p>

<p>"My little girl! I promised to look after her."</p>

<p>A jarring blow above the heart staggered him, and as he began to
crumple forward he had a quick vision of the more destroying fate,
the something which came crashing to his jaw. He heard his wife
scream; then darkness enveloped him.</p>

<p>A long and very confused period followed. His glimpses of
consciousness were intermittent and accompanied by pain. He heard
people talking, and they appeared strangers to him. There was a lot
of talking going on, quarrelling, perhaps. When he was once more a
complete master of his brain he realised abruptly that he was in
the ward of a hospital. His jaw was strapped up tight and was
giving him great pain; a nurse was feeding him through a silver
tube. Two of his teeth were missing. He wanted to talk to her, but
found he could not speak. Then he recalled the incident of his
calamity. Well, there it was. He had been brought up in a hard
school. Old iron! The instinct of self-preservation prompted him to
bide his time. Doubtless his jaw was broken; a long job, but he
would get well again. At the end of the journey Annie awaited him.
What was the child doing now? Who was looking after her? He passed
through periods of mental anguish and misgiving, and then long
periods of drowsy immobility. Night succeeded day. To his surprise,
on the following afternoon, his wife appeared. She came and sat by
the bed, and said:</p>

<p>"Going on all right?"</p>

<p>He nodded. She looked uneasily round, then whispered:</p>

<p>"You needn't have taken on like that. Ted's going off to
America, to-morrow&mdash;fulfilling engagements."</p>

<p>Jim stared at the ceiling, then closed his eyes. Ted no longer
interested him. He wanted Annie, and he could not ask for her.
Clara stayed a few moments, chatted with the nurse, and vanished.
Why had she come? Later on, he was removed to the operating
theatre, and they re-set his jaw. The shift of time again became
uncertain. A long while later he remembered a kindly-faced man in a
white overall saying:</p>

<p>"Well, old chap, who struck you this blow?"</p>

<p>He bent his ear down to Jim's lips, and the latter managed to
reply:</p>

<p>"A stranger."</p>

<p>Isaac came, humid and concerned, and pressed his hand.</p>

<p>"Well, well, I've found you, old friend! A neighbour told me.
Distressing, indeed. They say you must not talk. Well, what can I
do?"</p>

<p>Jim indicated with his hands that he wished to write something
down. Isaac produced an envelope and a pencil, and he wrote:</p>

<p class="letter">"Go and see my little gal Annie send her to me
keep an eye on her."</p>

<p>Isaac nodded gravely, and went away.</p>

<p>There appeared an eternity of time before the child came, but
when she did all his dark forebodings vanished. She came smiling up
the ward, and kissed him. They held each other's hands for a long
time before she spoke.</p>

<p>"They would not tell me where you were. It was old Mr. Rubens.
Oh, Daddy, are you getting better?"</p>

<p>Yes, he was getting better. Much better. During the last two
minutes he had improved enormously. He felt that he could speak. He
managed to mumble:</p>

<p>"How are you, my love?"</p>

<p>"All right. Mother has been very cross. That horrid man has gone
away. Mr. Rubens said you hurt your face. How did it happen,
Daddy?"</p>

<p>"I slipped on the stairs, my dear, and fell."</p>

<p>Annie's eyes opened wide very, but she did not speak. He knew by
her manner that she did not believe him. At the back of her eyes
there still lurked something of that horror which haunted them on
the night when she had discovered "that horrid man" embracing her
mother. It was the same night that her father "slipped on the
stairs." The child was too astute to dissociate the two incidents,
but she did not want to distress him.</p>

<p>"I shall come every day," she announced.</p>

<p>He smiled gratefully, and she stayed and chatted with him until
the sister proclaimed that visitors were to depart.</p>

<p>From that day the convalescence of Jim Canning, although slow,
was assured. Apart from the broken jaw, he had suffered a slight
concussion owing to striking the back of his head against the wall
when he fell. The hospital authorities could not get out of him how
the accident happened. Annie and Isaac Rubens were regular
visitors, but during the seven weeks he remained in hospital Clara
only visited him twice, and that was to arrange about money. On the
day that he was discharged he had drawn his last five pounds from
the bank.</p>

<p>"Never mind, never mind," he thought to himself; "we'll soon get
that back."</p>

<p>And within a few days he was again trundling his barrow along
the streets, calling out in his rather high tremolo voice, "Old
iron! Old iron!"</p>

<p>There followed after that a long period in the life of the
Canning family which is usually designated as "humdrum." With the
departure of Ted Woollams Clara settled down into a listless
prosecution of her domestic routine. She seldom spoke to her
husband except to nag him, or to grumble about their reduced
circumstances, and these for a time were in a very serious state.
Debts had accumulated, and various odds and ends in the house had
disappeared while he had been in hospital. Clara was still smartly
dressed, but Annie's clothes, particularly her boots, were in a
deplorable condition. But Jim set to work, leaving home in the
morning at seven o'clock and often not returning till eight or nine
at night. For months the financial position remained precarious. A
period of hunger, and ill-temper, and sudden ugly brawls. But
gradually he began again to get it under control. Clara had not
lost her taste for good living, but she was kept in check by the
lack of means. She was furtive, sullen and resentful. Jim insisted
that whatever they had to go without, Annie was to continue with
her schooling.</p>

<p>They never spoke of Ted Woollams, but Jim knew that he had only
gone away for four or five months. Jim struggled on through the
winter months, out in all weathers in his thin and battered coat.
Sometimes twinges of rheumatism distorted his face, but he
mentioned it to no one, not even Isaac.</p>

<p>It was in April that a sudden and dramatic change came into
Jim's life. One morning he was alone in the shop. It was raining,
and no customers had been in for several hours. Jim was struggling
with the unsolvable problem of getting things straight and sorted
out. Beneath a bed he came across a jumble of indescribable things,
bits of iron and broken pots, odd boots, sections of brackets,
nameless odd-shaped remnants covered with dust and grime. He
sighed. He remembered this lot quite well. They had been a great
disappointment to him. He had trundled his barrow all the way down
to a sale in Greenwich, where he had been given the tip that there
were some good things going. Owing to losing his way, he had
arrived late, and all the plums had been devoured by rival dealers.
He had picked up this lot at the end of the sale for a few
shillings, not that they appealed to him as a good bargain, but
because he did not want to feel that he had completely wasted his
day. He had brought them back and dumped them under the bed,
intending to go through them later on. That was many months ago,
long before he had been to the hospital, and there they had
remained ever since.</p>

<p>Jim's ideas of dusting were always a little perfunctory. With a
small feather brush he flicked clouds of dust from one object to
another. No; there was nothing here of any value, though that piece
of torn embroidery might fetch five shillings, and the small oblong
iron box which someone had painted inside and out a dark green
might be worth a little more. He picked it up and examined it. A
ridiculous notion to paint iron; but there, people were fools,
particularly his customers. Of course it might be copper or brass.
In that case it would be worth more. He pulled out a long
jack-knife and scraped the surface. The paint was old but
incredibly thick. It must have had a dozen coats or so. When he
eventually got down to the surface he found a dark-blue colour.</p>

<p>"Um!" thought Jim. "That's a funny thing."</p>

<p>And he scraped a little more, and found some brown and
white.</p>

<p>"That's enamel," he said out loud. "An enamel box. Um! I'll show
that to Isaac. An enamel box might be worth several pounds."</p>

<p>He put the box on one side, and continued tidying up. That
evening, after supper, he wrapped the box up in a piece of
newspaper and took it round to his friend.</p>

<p>Isaac adjusted his thickest glasses and examined the spot where
Jim had scratched. Then he went to the door and called out:</p>

<p>"Lizzie, bring me some turpentine."</p>

<p>When the turpentine was brought, Isaac began to work away at the
surface with a rag and penknife. His face was very red, but he made
no remark except once to mutter:</p>

<p>"This paint alone is twenty or thirty years old."</p>

<p>It took him nearly half an hour to reveal a complete corner of
the box. Then he sat back and examined it through a microscope. Jim
waited patiently. At last Isaac put it down and tapped the
table.</p>

<p>"This," he said deliberately, "is a Limoges enamel box of the
finest period. It is an amazing find! Where did you obtain it?"</p>

<p>"I bought it at a sale of the effects of an old lady named
Brandt, at Greenwich. She died intestate, and had no
relatives."</p>

<p>"You are in luck's way, Jim Canning."</p>

<p>"But why was it painted dark green?"</p>

<p>"There are many mysteries in our profession. It was probably
stolen many years ago&mdash;possibly a century ago. The thief knew
that the piece was too well-known to attempt to dispose of it for
some time. So for security he painted it in order to hide it. Then
something happened. He may have died or been sent to prison. The
box passed into other hands. Nobody worried about it. It was just
an old iron box. It has probably been lying in a lumber-room for
years."</p>

<p>"It's been lying in my shop for five months. Is it worth a great
deal, Isaac?"</p>

<p>Isaac thoughtfully stroked his chin.</p>

<p>"I am of opinion that if it is undamaged, and if the rest of it
is up to the standard of this part we have disclosed, it is worth
many thousand pounds."</p>

<p>Jim looked aghast.</p>

<p>"But I only gave six-and-six for the lot!"</p>

<p>"It is the fortune of our profession."</p>

<p>The upshot of it was that Jim left the box in Isaac's hands to
deal with as he thought fit. At first Isaac wished to waive the
question of commission, but when Jim pointed out that but for
Isaac's superior knowledge he would probably have sold it for a
five-pound note, the Jew agreed to sell it on a ten per cent basis.
Fair bargaining on both sides.</p>

<p>Jim returned home, almost dazed by the news. Was it fair to
obtain such a large sum of money in such a way? He had done nothing
to deserve it. And yet&mdash;who should have it, if not he? The old
lady had not even any relations. She was an eccentric who lived
alone with a crowd of cats. An enamel box has no attraction to a
cat.</p>

<p>He said nothing about his find to his wife or to Annie. He did
not wish to buoy them up with false hopes. Perhaps, after all,
Isaac might be mistaken, or he may have overvalued the object. A
thousand pounds! A dazzling sum. Why, he could almost retire upon
it to&mdash;Shorwell Green, where it was so quiet and peaceful. But
no! Clara would not agree to that&mdash;the Camden Road! He
detested the Camden Road, but still, there it was. Clara was his
wife. It was only fair to consider her wishes, although they were
so unhappy together. In any case, it would be a great relief;
security for years to come.</p>

<p>He went back to his work as though nothing had happened. Weeks
went by, and Jim heard nothing about the enamel box; and then, one
morning, he received a note from Isaac asking him to call round at
once.</p>

<p>When he entered his friend's shop he knew that something
exceptional had happened. Isaac was excited. He glowed and smiled,
and was almost jocular.</p>

<p>"Come into my little room," he said.</p>

<p>When they were seated, he elaborately produced a cheque from his
vest pocket, and handed it across the table to Jim.</p>

<p>"Here is your little share. I have kept my commission."</p>

<p>It was a cheque for &pound;4,140. Isaac had sold it for
&pound;4,600 to a well-known collector.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was like a dream to Jim. Truly, he returned
and pretended to be busy. In the afternoon, he even went out and
trundled his barrow, calling out, "Old iron! Old iron!" but he did
it more by force of habit.</p>

<p>"I need not do this any more," he kept on thinking. His mind was
occupied with many visions. It was a bright Spring day, with light
fleecy clouds scudding above the chimney-pot. How beautiful it
would be in that Sussex vale! The flowers would be out, and the
young pollard-willows reflected in the cool streams. Pleasant to
lie on the bank and fish, and forget this grimy life. And Annie,
racing hither and thither, picking the buttercups and marguerites,
and nestling by his side. He could do all this! Freedom, by one of
those queer twists of fate.</p>

<p>The day wore on, and he still continued his work in a dazed,
preoccupied manner. When the evening came, a feeling of exhaustion
crept over him. Yes, probably he was tired. He wanted a rest and
change. How fortunate he was. And yet he dreaded breaking the news
to Clara. She would immediately demand a complete social upheaval.
A new house, new furniture, luxuries, and parties, and social
excitements. He arrived home late. During supper he was very
silent.</p>

<p>"I will tell her afterwards," he thought. Annie was in bed. She
should be told to-morrow. But to-night it must be broken to Clara.
After all, it was true, she <i>was</i> his wife. It was the fair
thing to do. He tried to recall the moments of passion and
tenderness of the early days of their honeymoon, but all the other
ugly visions kept dancing before his eyes. He lighted his pipe and
gazed around the untidy room. Perhaps she would improve. Perhaps
the changed conditions would soften her, and make her more
amenable. But still, she was his wife, and if she wished to live in
the Camden Road, well...</p>

<p>It was nearly dark, and Clara went out of the room, humming. She
seemed peculiarly cheerful to-night. Almost as if she knew...He
fingered the cheque in his breast pocket. She had gone
upstairs&mdash;probably to fetch a novel. When she came down, he
would lay the cheque on the table, and say:</p>

<p>"Look, Clara; see what has happened to us!"</p>

<p>And then he would be a little tender with her, try and make her
understand how he felt. They would start all over again.</p>

<p>And then happened a variant of that hypothetical case described
at the beginning of this story. Only, in this case it was the woman
who went out.</p>

<p>Jim was sitting there with his fingers on the cheque that was to
be their means of reconciliation, and with the tears already banked
in his unuttered speech, when Clara put her head in the door. She
had her hat on. She said:</p>

<p>"I'm going to the post."</p>

<p>Jim removed his hand from his breast pocket. He sat back, and
heard the door slam.</p>

<p>"I'll tell her when she comes in."</p>

<p>But Clara never came in. He waited half-an-hour, and then he
thought:</p>

<p>"She's gone to some dissipation with a friend. Oh, well, I must
wait up till she returns, I suppose. I'm sorry she has disappointed
me on&mdash;a night like this, though."</p>

<p>He sat dreaming in the chair, till he became suddenly painfully
aware of cold. It was quite dark. He lighted the gas. It was one
o'clock. He felt his heart beating with a physical dread. Something
had happened to Clara. Perhaps she had been run over, at the very
moment when everything was going to change for the better for her.
He blundered his way out into the hall, where a gas-jet flickered
feebly, and groped for his overcoat. On it he found a note pinned.
He turned up the gas higher, and read:</p>

<p class="letter">"I'm going off to Ted Woollams. I'm sick of you,
and the stinking little house. Ted's made a bit in America, and I
give you the address. You can do what you like about it, but it's
no good you ever trying to get me back.<br>
<br>
"Clara."</p>

<p>It was characteristic of Jim Canning that this note made him
cry. He was so sensitive to its utter callousness and ingratitude.
Then he dabbed his eyes with his old red handkerchief, and went
upstairs. He tapped on Annie's door, then he opened it and said
quietly:</p>

<p>"Annie, it's all right, my dear. It's only me. May I come
in?"</p>

<p>The sleeping child was awake abruptly. She held out her
arms.</p>

<p>"I ought not to have woken you up, my love, only I felt a
little&mdash;lonely. Annie, would you like to come away with me to
a beautiful place in the country, where it's all woods and flowers,
and little streams?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Daddy, yes! And would there be lambs, too, and little black
pigs, and brown calves?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear; all those things; and birds, too, and quietness,
and freedom."</p>

<p>"But, Daddy, could we?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; I've had some good fortune."</p>

<p>Annie was very wide awake now, and she sat up and clapped her
hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, Daddy, when can we go?"</p>

<p>"Quite soon, my dear. Perhaps in a few weeks."</p>

<p>When he had closed the door, he dabbed his eyes again, and
thought:</p>

<p>"It was unthinking of me. I oughtn't to have woken her up,
but&mdash;she is all I have."</p>

<p>A week later he wrote to Clara:</p>

<p class="letter">"Dear Clara,&mdash;<br>
<br>
"I understand that for the last week you have been living with Ted
Woollams. I do not critticize your action. We are all as God made
us. I shall in the dew course take divorse proceedings not as a act
of hostility to you but that you may marry the man of your choice
and be respectable. I also shall share with you the result of a
good deal last week in order that you may not want and so close
with check for &pound;2020. I think this fair.<br>
<br>
Jim."</p>

<p>It was Isaac who helped him over all the difficult problems
which occurred at that time, and it was Isaac who persuaded him
that he was overdoing the "fairness" to Clara. He said that under
the circumstances he had no moral obligation to Clara, and that
&pound;500 would be lavish. So in the end Jim altered the cheque to
that amount. It was Isaac who took over the little shop, which he
used as a kind of dumping ground of his superfluous stock. And it
was Isaac who a year after returned letters addressed to Jim in a
handwriting he recognised, "Gone away. Address not known." And it
was he who in later years bore the brunt of the wild invective of a
drunken harridan who said that her husband had deserted her, and
would not hand her any of the fortune he must have inherited. He
shook his head sadly, and replied that he knew nothing. Mr. Canning
and his daughter had left London. He thought they had gone to
Australia.</p>

<p>When she had gone, he said to himself:</p>

<p>"It would distress Jim to know that a woman who had once been
his wife had sunk to such a condition."</p>

<p>As he passed through the room at the back he smiled and
thought:</p>

<p>"How fortunate she did not come in here!"</p>

<p>On the table was a large bowl of red and white roses, with the
label and card still lying on the table. On the card was inscribed,
"With love to Uncle Isaac. A."</p>

<p>The postmark on the label was a village in Sussex.</p>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>24. THE SONG OF PRAISE</h2>

<p>George Arthur always began the day with song. Almost directly he
awoke he would sit bolt upright against the pillow, his small chest
thrust out, his bright blue eyes fixed on the sky and the nodding
branches of the elms visible from the night-nursery window, and he
would sing.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful song. It had no recognisable air and no
recognisable words. It was a volume of sound that rose and fell,
rushed onward, sometimes repeated itself, sometimes hung poised,
sometimes rumbled with a deep mock-manly note, sometimes lingered
and sometimes scurried. But whatever its tempo, and whatever its
rhythm, it always contained that quality which it shared with the
birds on the branches below, the quality of triumph, the quality of
praise.</p>

<p>It was as though, after the pause of darkness, when everything
fell apart and became detached, one could not accept these golden
gifts of the awakening and uniting god without due recognition. The
story must be continued from where it left off when the sun
departed.</p>

<p>To the sophisticated this interruption of darkness is accepted
with the insolent assumption that in precisely so many hours and
minutes it will again be light. But why? Why regard this astounding
miracle with cynical indifference?</p>

<p>George Arthur and the birds had no cause to doubt the coming of
the light, but it still remained a miracle. It still remained a
subject upon which to pour out one's heart in praise. Through his
open door he could see through the open door of Nan-nan's room, and
observe her bustling movements, but he never felt impelled to offer
her any kind of greeting until the song had run its full course.
And not even then in the general sense of the term greeting.</p>

<p>When, on this particular morning, she appeared some twenty
minutes later, he immediately broke into a lively torrent of
discourse concerning two rabbits, one of which the gardener's son
had allowed to escape into Major Towle's kitchen-garden, and how it
had been chased and nearly killed by the red setter.</p>

<p>The unabated frenzy of the narrative lasted well into breakfast
time. And breakfast was no inconsiderable trifle with George
Arthur, consisting as it did of wheat flakes and cream, a boiled
egg, toast, butter, jam and some stewed prunes, this solid
nutriment being helped down by two cups of warm milk.</p>

<p>These matters being disposed of, George Arthur was aware that
the serious business of the day was about to start. But not quite
yet. For the first and most important business of the day was the
visit to <i>Her</i>. And for some reason or other she did not like
him to visit her until a certain time known only to Nan-Nan and
herself.</p>

<p>So in a spasmodic way he continued his song, lying on his tummy
on the nursery floor, and making a drawing of a steamer with clouds
of smoke pouring out of the funnels, until she sent for him.</p>

<p>This was always a golden hour to George Arthur, the time when he
had her entirely to himself, without fear of interruption. He was
intimately aware of her astounding beauty, her gold-brown hair
framed by the white pillow, her wonderful pink and white skin,
those large, wistful, blue-grey eyes. There was a wonderful perfume
about her body, which he could only recognise vaguely as the
essence of their intimacy.</p>

<p>In bed she wore a wonderful pale blue thing trimmed with white
fur. In fact, everything she wore was beautiful, far more beautiful
than things worn by other women. He had even heard people say so.
And she moved more gracefully, and her voice was deeper, gentler,
more musical than any other voice in the world. By the side of the
bed was her breakfast-tray. Her breakfast never seemed to consist
of anything but tea, toast and letters. And sometimes, while she
was talking to him, she would pick up one of the letters and glance
through it abstractedly.</p>

<p>He forgave these aberrations because, knowing that she was the
most beautiful woman in the world, everyone wanted her. The house
always seemed to be full of people wanting her. And they stayed to
meals, played cards, or made her sing; and sometimes they took her
away with them for long stretches of time, all night sometimes, and
even several nights. But when, on these occasions, she returned, he
always noticed an added pressure of her arms, a kind of breathless
expression of her nearness.</p>

<p>Particularly did he notice this when "Dadda" was away, and Dadda
was away quite a lot. A curious person, Dadda, not a bit like her.
There was nothing beautiful about him. He was rather bald with
heavy black moustaches. Everything about him was rather heavy. He
wore heavy dark clothes and watchchains, and rings, and although he
was always in a hurry he moved heavily. Sometimes he would come
across George Arthur, and exclaim in his heavy voice:</p>

<p>"Well, my old cockalorum!" and he would pat him and admire his
drawings, but very quickly he would seem to get tired of this and
he would keep on looking at his watch, or else Mr. Lanyard, his
secretary, would come bustling along with a brown leather case, and
would say:</p>

<p>"The car is here, sir."</p>

<p>And then they would go off together, and nothing more would be
seen of Dadda until the next morning, or until many next mornings.
There was something unsatisfactory about this. Of course Dadda
didn't matter in the way <i>she</i> mattered. He was not
indispensable. But George Arthur always felt a kind of queer pity
for him. He would have liked to know him better; but they were
always both a little shy in each other's company.</p>

<p>It seemed to George Arthur that Dadda was always driven along by
some hidden power to do the things he didn't want to do. He so
often seemed worried and distracted, and sometimes when at home he
would sit forward on his chair and look at <i>her</i>, with an odd,
appealing look in his eyes, just like Jimmy, Major Towle's red
setter, when his master had told him to "Wait." But George Arthur
seldom saw them together. There were all these people always
wanting her, and there was Dadda driven hither and thither by Mr.
Lanyard, and the brown leather case.</p>

<p>There were occasions, as on this morning, when Dadda had been
away some time, that George Arthur would feel a sudden need for
him, as though he felt there were something missing in the general
scheme of things, and nestling in the crook of her white arm he
said abruptly:</p>

<p>"When is Dadda coming back?"</p>

<p>There was a pause and she seemed to laugh a little
uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"I don't quite know, darling. Not yet."</p>

<p>"What is he doing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's busy. Business, you know."</p>

<p>"What is business?"</p>

<p>"Being busy, darling. Selling things, making money&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it hard to make money?"</p>

<p>"To some people, not to others."</p>

<p>"To Dadda?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. He&mdash;there, don't lean on me, darling. I must
go and have my bath."</p>

<p>On some mornings he accompanied her into the bathroom. He liked
to watch her long white body glistening under the water. But this
morning he refrained. He wanted to think something out.</p>

<p>For the last few weeks he had determined&mdash;and he had
elaborated the idea minutely to Nan-nan&mdash;that when he grew up
he was going to be a policeman. Not, as he explained, an ordinary
policeman, but an "important" policeman, one who rode on a horse
and wore white gloves and ordered the motor-cars about. He had seen
one on his last visit to London town, when they stayed at a large
dark house in a square. He had seen this policeman in one of the
busy streets near a park and he had been duly impressed. But now he
was wondering whether it wouldn't be nicer to be a business man, to
have a lot of cases and papers, and dash about in a motor-car, with
everybody very deferential, and handing you bags of gold over
counters.</p>

<p>The only great objection to this seemed to be that one had to be
so much in London town, a place he did not like. When they went to
stay at that dark house in the square he was always conscious of a
feeling of depression. It seemed no place for games and
make-believe, and sometimes he went into the garden of the square,
and he noticed that the trees were dirty. The seats were dirty, and
everything you touched made your hands black. And the other
children and their nursemaids never seemed disposed to be
friendly.</p>

<p>Which reminded him! In a leap he was off the bed and down the
stairs. This was the morning that Joan and Nigel were coming in to
play Red Indians. Joan was five and Nigel eight, and they belonged
to Major Towle's, next door.</p>

<p>Of course they had not come, and Nan-nan called out of the
window that they would not be here yet, not till eleven o'clock.
Oh, bother eleven o'clock! What a world of waiting this was!
Nothing ever seemed to happen at once. It was always: soon, or
presently, or by-and-by, or one day, or later on, or we-shall-see,
or eleven o'clock. How he hated these expressions! When was eleven
o'clock? It sounded a remote and sinister hour. Wasn't the whole
essence of everything to do it immediately?</p>

<p>However, the sun was shining brilliantly, and he rushed to the
hutches behind the garage and engaged the rabbit in conversation.
He pushed cabbage stalks through the wire and told "Joey" he was an
old silly. And the rabbit's nostrils worked up and down so rapidly
it seemed just as though he were eagerly corroborating this
criticism.</p>

<p>Then there was Beauchamp, the chauffeur, turning the hose on to
the Daimler. He also had to be interviewed. There were, indeed, a
great number of garden activities that required attention, and the
time passed quickly. George Arthur had, in fact, forgotten all
about his fellow Red Indians until a familiar war-whoop greeted him
from the other side of the vegetable garden. Nigel was in full war
paint with feathers and tomahawk complete, and Joan was wearing a
headdress and a coloured shawl.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" was his greeting. "I'm not ready."</p>

<p>He dashed indoors and yelled out to Nan-nan for his Indian suit.
There were times when her dilatoriness infuriated him. It was not
that she was actually so slow in movement as that she did not
always appreciate the importance of certain things.</p>

<p>There she was calmly ironing something out, and laughing and
talking with Annie, the parlour-maid, while "the tribe" were
waiting for him below! However, by the employment of a certain
amount of violence, both physical and vocal, he managed to persuade
her to help him into his suit and feathers.</p>

<p>Down in the hall he ran into <i>her</i>. She was exquisitely
gowned in some pale mauve colour with a small black hat. She was
just going out to the car.</p>

<p>"Oh, darling, how splendid you look!" she exclaimed, drawing on
her gloves. "I shan't be long. I shall be home to tea in any
case."</p>

<p>In the ordinary way he would have protested at her going out for
so long a time, but in an instant he sensed that she, too, like
Nan-nan, failed to judge the true importance of the situation.
There was a shade of insincerity in her admiration. She was, he
knew, anxious to get off "without a fuss." She had her interests
and he had his, and there it was. Moreover, this was not the time
of day for emotions and regrets.</p>

<p>He allowed her to kiss him on the cheek, and then with a quick:
"All right, then," he dashed past her into the garden.</p>

<p>Beyond the vegetable garden, was a narrow strip of copse, and
here the Indians pitched their tent. It was a glorious morning.
There was much spying and creeping through the undergrowth, and
waving of tomahawks. There were muttered whispers of "Walla, walla,
walla," and similar sounds, alien tribes were defeated, victims
scalped, bears and buffaloes tracked, and slain, and Joan rescued
from the clutches of the enemy about to burn her. The morning
seemed to go like a flash.</p>

<p>A smiling ayah glided into view almost simultaneously with
Nan-nan.</p>

<p>Oh, bother, bother, bother, bother, bother! What a tyranny were
the interventions of these grown-ups. In the same way that nothing
ever happened at once, neither did it ever happen continuously.
There were always these absurd interruptions and
intervals&mdash;just when one was getting into things.</p>

<p>"Now children, your rest before lunch."</p>

<p>It was not even as though they could resume the game quite soon.
After lunch Joan and Nigel had to go out, he knew. He, too, would
probably have to go out for a walk with Nan-nan. Mum didn't like
him to play in the garden all day&mdash;then home to tea. Perhaps
they could come after tea? But, no, Joan and Nigel, it seemed, had
promised to go to tea with some other children, to play with them.
To play with other children!</p>

<p>George Arthur felt a little stab of jealousy. He turned abruptly
away and ran into the house. Lying on his bed, during his rest
before lunch, he began again to think about Mum. Why did she always
want to be going about seeing other people, leaving him to his own
and Nan-nan's devices? Had he treated her rather brusquely that
morning, though? Oh, well, there were moments when he felt a queer
desire to punish her in some fantastic way, or at least if not to
punish her, to show his power over her. He hummed to himself, and
turned to his drawing-book.</p>

<p>He found that Indian warfare had given him an appetite, and he
did full justice to a meal consisting of roast chicken, vegetables,
stewed damsons, custard and cream, and ending up with a
nectarine.</p>

<p>It seems a significant comment upon the nature of the animal
that immediately after this he could stand on his head in the
corner of the room with his legs bent and balance the kitten on his
knees, amidst shrieks of laughter from himself, mild protests from
Nan-nan, and dubious acquiescence from the kitten.</p>

<p>After the excitement of the morning the afternoon seemed a mild
and rather uneventful experience. He went on to the common with
Nan-nan, and he took a kite, but owing to lack of wind this was not
a success, neither was sailing a boat on a small muddy pond. These
failures, however, were a little discounted by the sight of a large
rat, which scuttled away from the reeds of the pond, and
disappeared under a culvert. Then they sat down on a rug and
Nan-nan read to him. It was a lovely story about "Winnie, the
Pooh." He had heard it before several times, but he did not like
stories that were unfamiliar.</p>

<p>Nan-nan had a pretty voice&mdash;Scotch. Sometimes he found it
difficult to understand her, and he would stop her and ask her to
repeat something. Sometimes he found himself just listening to the
cadence of her voice, and not following the story. There was
something very attractive about it when she read; much more
attractive than when she just talked in the ordinary way.</p>

<p>He began to wonder how much he loved her. Her hair, pulled
tightly back, was turning grey. Her cheeks were red and a little
rough, but her eyes were deep and grey and understanding. She was
very dear to him, sitting there bolt upright, with her back to a
furze-bush and reading in her pretty Scotch voice. She was dear to
him because she was so familiar, and reliable, and understanding.
Of course it wasn't like Mum&mdash;there was nothing exciting about
it. But he leant against her for a moment, and without stopping her
reading, she put an arm round him, and pressed him to her.</p>

<p>Bees were droning in the yellow gorse. Little specks of white
cloud drifted idly overhead. An aeroplane appeared from nowhere,
the sound of its engine drowning the hum of the bees.</p>

<p>Tea-time was always the most important and exciting time of the
day, especially when <i>she</i> was to be there. It seemed to mark
the crisis of the day's adventures. The only danger lay in people.
Mum had an unfortunate habit of bringing people home to tea. When
they were strangers, or people he objected to, then the meal was
spoilt. But sometimes people whom he liked came&mdash;you never
knew.</p>

<p>There was Uncle Arthur, Dadda's elder brother. He was a big,
clumsy man, too solemn in his manners. He and George Arthur had
much in common. What he liked about Uncle Arthur was that he talked
to him quite seriously, as between man and man. He never seemed to
be laughing at him, or patronising. He knew the importance of
things. And there was Aunt Mildred, and Betty Smallpiece, and
Grandmamma, and, oh, quite a number of nice people.</p>

<p>From the edge of the common they could see that tea was set in
the sunk rose garden. There was the gleam of white napery, and the
glitter of silver and china. Two or three people were wandering
around, admiring the roses. There was Mum, two people he could not
recognise, and then to his profound disgust&mdash;"that man!" He
always called him "that man" to Nan-nan, who reproved him mildly
with:</p>

<p>"Oh, hush, Georgie! I'm sure Mr. Sievewright is very nice."</p>

<p>She, as any adult might, found it very difficult to explain
George Arthur's bitterness against Oswald Sievewright. A more
charming gentleman Nan-nan had never met. Young, good-looking,
boyish, gay, noone had made greater efforts to ingratiate himself
with George Arthur; but it had all been in vain. The small boy
would have nothing to do with him. He showed his dislike
openly.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, George Arthur regarded him as his secret enemy,
his pet aversion. And he had noticed of late than when "that man"
was there there was something subtly different about <i>her</i>.
She spoke differently, moved differently, and what was most
unpardonable, behaved slightly differently to George Arthur. She
seemed worried by his inimical attitude, and was always trying to
wheedle him into a more friendly one.</p>

<p>During tea he sat at his mother's elbow, and wouldn't speak. The
two strangers, a man and a woman, seemed harmless. In any case,
they didn't try to be familiar. But "that man" seemed to monopolise
everyone's attention, and his attempts to draw George Arthur out or
be friendly with him were so persistent and abortive that Mum
eventually said:</p>

<p>"Oh, leave him alone, Ossy. He's a funny boy."</p>

<p>A few minutes later she was conscious of a disturbance at her
elbow. She glanced round and saw that her small son was shaking,
and tears were assembling on the brink of his eyes. Tea was in any
case nearly finished, and she arose and said calmly:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, good people. Georgie and I are going for a little
stroll."</p>

<p>She tried to chatter to him dispassionately of other things, but
when they were out of sight the storm burst. She picked him up,
patted him, and tried to comfort him.</p>

<p>"What is it, Georgie? What's the matter? Tell Mum."</p>

<p>But he would not speak. In the midst of his tears he uttered
small groans of pain like one whose soul has been stricken. She
knew him well enough to realise that it was no use to cross-examine
too closely in an emotional crisis: moreover, she had a shrewd
suspicion of the cause of the trouble. In a conflict between two
personalities she had for an instant taken the side of the enemy.
She said, in her effort to appease:</p>

<p>"There, there, darling, policemen don't cry."</p>

<p>This statement had in any case the satisfactory effect of
eliciting a reply, jerked vehemently through diminishing sobs:</p>

<p>"I'm not going to be a policeman. I'm going to be a
business."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're going to be a business, are you!"</p>

<p>She smiled weakly, wondering what this might portend.</p>

<p>A few minutes later something exciting happened. Nan-nan came
out to say that the new "fairy car" promised by Uncle Arthur had
just arrived by the carrier. All troubles were instantly forgotten.
The car was unpacked. It was painted scarlet and green. George
Arthur mounted it and raced round the lawns, violently ringing the
bell. The garden immediately became a playground, a paradise, a
fairyland. He squealed with delight, and grinned with pride at the
onlookers' praise of his skill.</p>

<p>The two strangers went, but "that man" stayed on. In the corner
of the rose garden he was sitting very close to Mum. They seemed
absorbed in each other. He was whispering to her and smiling. Her
eyes were lowered. They appeared to be concentrated on the ground,
but now and then she would look up at him and sigh. Neither of them
was any longer interested in the skill of the cyclist. The latter
kept pausing and looking in their direction. Once or twice he felt
deeply stirred to protest, but something prompted him to bide his
time.</p>

<p>Nan-nan had disappeared, but it was getting near the time when
she would come for him for his bath. Sometimes when they were alone
Mum would give him his bath, but not very frequently. Certainly no
chance of it while "that man" was there.</p>

<p>He rode down past the copse, and out of sight. There was no one
about. He felt a little stab of melancholy. At the end of the copse
was a little wooden gate and bridge that crossed a tiny stream,
dividing the garden property from the common. He dismounted and
stood staring about him. Then he heard Nan-nan call.</p>

<p>Acting on a sudden impulse, he conducted his fairy car across
the stream. Then he tipped it up on edge, and ran away into the
common. He heard Nan-nan calling, and he crept into the heart of a
thick bush, where he was entirely hidden, but where he had a good
view of what might take place near the bridge. Indians with a
vengeance!</p>

<p>Her calls became louder, and at last she appeared at the bridge,
and caught sight of the car. She hurried towards it, picked it up,
gave a quick glance at the stream, and then peered all around her.
She was obviously a little bewildered and frightened. She called on
a higher note:</p>

<p>"Georgie! Georgie! Where are you?"</p>

<p>She seemed about to make a search of the common, then she
crossed the bridge again and ran in the direction of the house.
This was a lovely game! In a few minutes she returned, accompanied
by Mum, and "that man." He heard the latter exclaim:</p>

<p>"I bet you he's only hiding."</p>

<p>And he began whistling and calling loudly, and then started a
running trot across the common. He passed within two yards of
Georgie, who crouched down, and held his breath. When his enemy
passed he chuckled with glee. Mum was calling out in her deep
musical voice:</p>

<p>"Geor-gie!"</p>

<p>There was a note of anxiety in it. She drifted uncertainly in
his direction, continuing her call. He waited until she was within
pouncing distance, then he sprang out with a triumphant yell. He
saw her stagger for a moment, and put her hand across her eyes.</p>

<p>"Georgie," she said quietly, "you shouldn't do that."</p>

<p>He had accomplished what he had set out to do! He had
established the fact that his hold over her was greater than the
hold over her of&mdash;any rival. He danced around her with savage
delight. Her relief had its reaction. She was a little angry.</p>

<p>She said: "You're a silly boy," and she called out to "that
man." But the latter had already heard, and came running back,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Where was the young monkey?"</p>

<p>They all went back to the house. George Arthur didn't care very
much if she was angry. He had won. He mounted his fairy car and
rode vigorously around the lawns. He elected to be perverse. When
Nan-nan called him he rang his bell, laughed, and dodged her. The
chase went on until it was late for his bath-time. Nan-nan herself
was getting winded and a little angry.</p>

<p>Mum showed her disapproval by leaving him and going into the
drawing-room with "that man." At last he dismounted and pushed the
tricycle away. He crept into the drawing-room after her. She and
"that man" were sitting on the Chesterfield. He went up and
whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>"You give me my bath to-night."</p>

<p>She whispered back: "No, I can't to-night, darling. I&mdash;I've
got something else to do. Run on upstairs, there's a darling. I'll
come up and see you when you're in bed."</p>

<p>It was all nonsense. She had nothing to do. She was just sitting
there talking to "that man." He wheedled and coaxed, but she would
not come. He had never known her so obstinate. He had his ultimate
weapon&mdash;tears, but he was not going to use it in front of
"that man." Besides&mdash;with a sulky wriggle he left her.</p>

<p>"Good-night, old man," called out "that man."</p>

<p>He did not answer. George Arthur was not a well-behaved little
boy. And to-night he was angry. Something was all wrong with the
world. He didn't know exactly what it was, but he felt disasters
and disappointments crowding upon him. He proceeded to take it out
of Nan-nan. He splashed her and threw the soap out of the bath, and
also the three motor-boats which usually afforded such absorbing
entertainment while ablutions were being performed. Nan-nan
struggled bravely with her exasperations. She had had strict
instructions from both parents that in no circumstances was she
ever to slap or physically chastise the child. Neither had she any
desire to do so, but there were moments&mdash;like the
present&mdash;when she rather envied the people who had not so much
conscience in these matters. But when she was drying him he seemed
to change suddenly. He looked at her and said:</p>

<p>"Are you tired, Nan-nan?"</p>

<p>"You make me tired sometimes, Georgie, when you are a naughty
boy."</p>

<p>Sitting up in his small bed, when she was out of the room, he
felt a wave of pity for her sweep over him. Poor Nan-nan! She,
too&mdash;there was something all wrong with the world these days.
She returned with his banana and biscuits, and as though to make
atonement for his misdeeds he told her the full details of his
adventures with Joan and Nigel, and he gave imitations of bears and
tigers and the language of Indians.</p>

<p>He was interrupted in the performance by the entrance of Mum,
who had come to say good-night. Nan-nan went out of the room. As
soon as he was alone with her he was aware of some unusual
disturbance. Before she came he had entirely calmed down. He had
become quite normal and himself. But now he felt not only that
curious emotional thrill which her presence always gave to him, but
the sense of something else, something more disturbing. She was
looking pale, and seemed to be struggling to be matter-of-fact.
Once or twice she looked at him, and then looked around the room
curiously, as though she had never seen it before.</p>

<p>Her voice shook when she said: "Was it a nice banana,
darling?"</p>

<p>She kept touching things in an odd, jerky manner. And when she
kissed him good-night she hurt him with a kind of savage hug. And
though she looked into his face and there was the old familiar
hungry look in her eyes, he noticed that she looked away almost
immediately, and made some casual remark about the stuffed elephant
on the chest of drawers.</p>

<p>She had gone before he had time to determine the shape of his
own attitude towards her. He had felt aggrieved, and in need of
comfort, and loving assurance, and she had not given it to him. He
felt an immediate desire to cry out, and yell for her return, but
some stubborn impulse made him hold his peace. He had learnt that
in dealing with grown-ups one had to invent one's own weapons. They
didn't always fight fair. They had all the advantages, and their
reserves were inexhaustible. There were, nevertheless, ways of
defeating them. In this cumulating sense of a world against him Mum
had somehow got involved. He struggled to think the matter out, but
it eluded him. It began to get dark.</p>

<p>Nan-nan came in and talked to him a little. He would have liked
to tell her of his trouble, but he didn't know what his trouble
was. It was indefinable. Neither was she somehow quite the person
to tell, much as he loved her. She was neither in it, nor out of
it. He didn't feel that she could help him. He was almost relieved
at last when she went.</p>

<p>It was quite dark now, for he would never have a night-light. He
lay there struggling with his load of trouble, trying not to cry.
He thought of other things, flying impressions of the day, his new
fairy car, Uncle Arthur and the rabbits, but the load remained.</p>

<p>He slept at last, still suffering as the dumb suffer. He did not
know how long he slept, or what had happened in his dreams, but he
knew that after what appeared a great lapse of time he awoke quite
suddenly as though someone had touched him. He looked around.</p>

<p>It was daylight, but there was no one in the room. What hour was
this? It was some unfamiliar time, much earlier than usual. He
heard the birds outside, but there were no sounds of activity
within the house. It was a forlorn, deserted hour. The
recollections of yesterday had faded, but suddenly the burden of
them came back to him in a concentrated form. He knew he could
stand it no longer. He must cry. Not an ordinary whimper which one
may do in bed, but an important cry. Something which would
definitely relieve his depression.</p>

<p>He jumped out of bed and pattered across the room in his
pyjamas. Nan-nan's door was open, but he ignored it. He was in
search of bigger game. He ran down the passage, opened Mum's door,
and trotted in.</p>

<p>The fact that she was sitting on the edge of her bed partly
dressed gave him no surprise, the fact that when she saw him she
turned quite pale, and started like a person who had seen a ghost,
seemed of small consequence. He flew at her, like an arrow to its
mark, flung his arms around her and began to sob. His little bosom
beat against hers, his tears ran down her neck. What could she do
but hug him, and sway, beating time on his back with each rhythmic
sob coming from his entire body?</p>

<p>"There, there, darling. It's all right. What is it? What is
Georgie crying about?"</p>

<p>No answer; only the continual sob and the pat upon the afflicted
back. She swung up her legs, and lay down on the bed still holding
him close, and crooning softly. In that first fierce assault the
defences of her own personal interest in the matter were carried,
and she knew instinctively that she would never recover the ground
lost. But her own tears were not far away.</p>

<p>"Oh, Georgie, why did you&mdash;how did you know?"</p>

<p>He heard her say this and he remembered it afterwards, but he
did not answer. Know! know what? It was largely the fact of not
knowing that had brought him to this condition. He was fighting
with his own weapons, and he continued to sob.</p>

<p>Through his tears he caught a glimpse of her face. It still had
that haunted scared expression, as though there was something she
could not understand. She was desperately anxious to calm him.</p>

<p>"It's all right, darling, it's all right. Mum's not going. She's
staying here with Georgie." He was not going to acknowledge his
goal, or gloat over the spoils of an uncertain victory. His
business was to make sure. He clung to her the tighter, and for a
long time neither spoke. But his sobs gradually diminished and he
appeared to sleep. But her deep, troubled eyes were very wide
awake. They travelled from the chintz curtains of her beautiful
room to a small hand-bag, partially packed, and then back to her
son. They alighted upon a Limoges enamel box, brought back from her
honeymoon, and from there to a note, addressed to Nan-nan, propped
up on the flap of the rose-wood escritoire, and then back to her
son. She knew that she was beaten. And amidst the anguish of defeat
she was already conscious of the balm of relief which would
eventually heal her wounds.</p>

<p>"Wait for me, darling. Mum must go and telephone
to&mdash;someone. She won't be long."</p>

<p>He saw her glide out of the room, closing the door behind her.
He heard her go down to the little room off the hall, and there was
that funny click of a bell which meant someone was asking for a
number. Then followed a long interval. Then the click of that bell
again, which meant the receiver had been put up. Another short
interval, and she glided back into the room. She looked pale. She
put her hand to her brow, and stared about vaguely. Then she seemed
to shiver, and to emit a little sigh. She picked up the letter from
the escritoire and tore it into a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>"I must go and have a bath, Georgie." She said this almost
petulantly, as though she were struggling to force herself into the
normal observances of the working day.</p>

<p>He again watched her go without comment. He heard the bath water
running, and the usual splashing which follows soon after. Other
sounds of activity from the house and garden reached him. He knew
that it would soon be <i>his</i> time to get up. Nan-nan would be
wondering where he was.</p>

<p>And then suddenly he remembered that it was time for his song.
In a crystalline instant he realised that whatever happened in this
world, the song must go on. And so, propped up against Mum's
pillow, with his little chest thrust out, he began his morning song
of praise and triumph.</p>

<p>With his bright blue eyes fixed on the blue of the sky there
seemed to flood through him a praise of all living things, and a
faith of man to surmount all obstacles. Tigers and Indians, elves
and elephants, the menace of darkness, unseen and unknown powers
ever conspiring to beat him down.</p>

<p>But the mission of man was to rise above all this. He must stand
by his fellowman. Perhaps that was the true purport of George
Arthur's song. Divided, he was at the mercy of the powers of
darkness. The world was a battlefield where real blood and anguish
flowed. United, it was the happy playground of a thousand dreams.
And while he played and dreamed there would flow for ever through
his heart the golden melody of song&mdash;the song of praise, the
song of triumph.</p>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>25. THE OCTAVE OF JEALOUSY</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>A tramp came through a cutting by old Jerry Shindle's nursery,
and crossing the stile, stepped into the glare of the white road.
He was a tall swarthy man with stubby red whiskers which appeared
to conceal the whole of his face, except a small portion under each
eye about the size of a two shilling piece. His skin showed through
the rents in a filthy old black green garment, and was the same
colour as his face, a livid bronze. His toes protruded from his
boots, which seemed to be home-made contraptions of canvas and
string. He carried an ash stick, and the rest of his worldly
belongings in a spotted red and white handkerchief. His worldly
belongings consisted of some rags, a door-knob, a portion of a
foot-rule, a tin mug stolen from a workhouse, half a dozen date
stones, a small piece of very old bread, a raw onion, the shutter
of a camera and two empty match-boxes.</p>

<p>He looked up and down the road as though uncertain of his
direction. To the north it curved under the wooded opulence of
Crawshay Park. To the south it stretched like a white ribbon across
a bold vista of shadeless downs. He was hungry and he eyed,
critically, the potential possibilities of a cottage, standing back
from the road. It was a shabby little three-roomed affair with
fowls running in and out of the front door, some washing on a line,
and the sound of a child crying within. While he was hesitating, a
farm labourer came through a gate to an adjoining field, and walked
toward the cottage. He, too, carried property tied up in a red
handkerchief. His other hand balanced a steel fork across his left
shoulder. He was a thick-set, rather dour-looking man. As he came
up the tramp said:</p>

<p>"Where does this road lead to, mate?"</p>

<p>The labourer replied brusquely:</p>

<p>"Pondhurst."</p>

<p>"How far?"</p>

<p>"Three and a half miles."</p>

<p>Without embroidering this information any further he walked
stolidly across the road and entered the garden of the cottage. The
tramp watched him put the fork down by the lintel door. He saw him
enter the cottage, and he heard a woman's voice. He sighed and
muttered into his stubbly red beard: "Lucky devil!" Then, hunching
his shoulders, he set out with long flat-footed strides down the
white road which led across the downs.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Having kicked some mud off his boots, the labourer, Martin
Crosby, said to his wife:</p>

<p>"Dinner ready?"</p>

<p>Emma Crosby was wringing out some clothes. Her face was shiny
with the steam and the heat of the day. She answered
petulantly:</p>

<p>"No, it isn't. You'll have to wait another ten minutes, the
'taters aren't cooked. I've enough to do this morning I can tell
you, what with the washing, and Lizzie screaming with her teeth,
and the biler going wrong."</p>

<p>"Ugh! There's allus somethin'."</p>

<p>Martin knew there was no appeal against delay. He had been
married four years; he knew his wife's temper and mode of life
sufficiently well. He went out into the garden and lighted his
pipe. The fowls clucked round his feet and he kicked them away. He,
too, was hungry. However, there would be food of a sort&mdash;in
time. Some greasy pudding and potatoes boiled to a liquid mash, a
piece of cheese perhaps. Well, there it was. When you work in the
open air all day you can eat anything. The sun was pleasant on his
face, the shag pungent and comforting. If only old Emma weren't
such a muddler! A good enough piece of goods when at her best, but
always in a muddle, always behind time, no management, and then
resentful because things went wrong. Lizzie: seven months old and
two teeth through already and another coming. A lovely child, the
spit and image of&mdash;what her mother must have been. Next time
it would be a boy. Life wasn't so bad&mdash;really.</p>

<p>The gate clicked, and the tall figure of Ambrose Baines
appeared. He was dressed in a corduroy coat and knickers, stout
brown gaiters and square thick boots. Tucked under his arm was a
gun with its two barrels pointing at the ground. He was the
gamekeeper to Sir Septimus Letter. He stood just inside the gate
and called out:</p>

<p>"Mornin', Martin."</p>

<p>Martin replied: "Mornin'."</p>

<p>"I was just passin'. The missus says you can have a cookin' or
so of runner beans if you wants 'em. We've got more than enough,
and I hear as yours is blighty."</p>

<p>"Oh!...ay, thank'ee."</p>

<p>"Middlin' hot to-day."</p>

<p>"Ay...terrible hot."</p>

<p>"When'll you be comin'?"</p>

<p>"I'll stroll over now. There's nowt to do. I'm waitin' dinner. I
'specks it'll be a half-hour or so. You know what Emma is."</p>

<p>He went inside and fetched a basket. He said nothing to his
wife, but rejoined Baines in the road. They strolled through the
cutting and got into the back of the gamekeeper's garden just
inside the wood. Martin went along the row and filled his basket.
Baines left him and went into his cottage. He could hear Mrs.
Baines singing and washing up.</p>

<p>Of course <i>they</i> had had their dinner. It would be like
that. Mrs. Baines was a marvel. On one or two occasions Martin had
entered their cottage. Everything was spick and span, and done on
time. The two children always seemed to be clean and quiet. There
were pretty pink curtains and framed oleographs. Mrs. Baines could
cook, and she led the hymns at church&mdash;so they said. Even the
garden was neat, and trim, and fruitful. Of course <i>their</i>
runner beans would be prolific while his failed. Mrs. Baines
appeared at the door and called out:</p>

<p>"Mornin', Mr. Crosby."</p>

<p>He replied gruffly: "Mornin', Mrs. Baines."</p>

<p>"Middlin' hot."</p>

<p>"Ay...terrible hot."</p>

<p>She was not what you would call a pretty, attractive woman; but
she was natty, competent, irrepressibly cheerful. She would make a
shilling go as far as Emma would a pound. The cottage had five
rooms, all in a good state of repair. The roof had been newly
thatched. All this was done for him, of course, by his employer. He
paid no rent; Martin had to pay five shillings a week, and then the
roof leaked, and the boiler never worked properly&mdash;but perhaps
that was Emma's fault. He picked up his basket and strolled toward
the outer gate. As he did so, he heard the two children laughing,
and Baines's voice joining in.</p>

<p>"Some people do have luck," Martin murmured, and went back to
his wife.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="poem">Jack and Jill went up the hill<br>
To fetch a pail of water;<br>
Jack fell down and broke his crown<br>
And Jill came tumbling after!</p>

<p>It was very pretty&mdash;the way Winny Baines sang that,
balancing the smaller boy on her knee, and jerking him skyward on
the last word. Not what the world would call a pretty woman, but
pretty enough to Ambrose, with her clear skin, kind motherly eyes,
and thin brown hair. Her voice had a quality which somehow always
expressed her gentle and unconquerable nature.</p>

<p>"She's too good for me," Ambrose would think at odd moments.
"She didn't ought to be a gamekeeper's wife. She ought to be a
lady&mdash;with carriages, and comforts, and well-dressed
friends.</p>

<p>The reflection would stir in him a feeling of sullen resentment,
tempered with pride. She was a wonderful woman. She managed so
well; she never complained. Of course, so far as the material
necessities were concerned, there was enough and to spare. The
cottage was comfortable, and reasonably well furnished&mdash;so far
as he could determine. Of food there was abundance; game, rabbits,
vegetables, eggs, fruit. The only thing he had to buy in the way of
food was milk from the farm, and a few groceries from Mr. Mead's
shop. He paid nothing for the cottage and yet&mdash;he would have
liked to have made things better for Winny. His wages were small,
and there were clothes to buy, all kinds of little incidental
expenses. There never seemed a chance to save and soon there would
be the boy's schooling.</p>

<p>In spite of the small income, Winny always managed to keep
herself and the children neat and smart, and even to help others
like the more unfortunate Crosbys. She did all the work of the
cottage, the care of the children, the mending and washing, and
still found time to make jam, to preserve fruit, to grow flowers,
and to sing in the church choir. She was the daughter of a
piano-tuner at Bladestone, and the glamour of this early connection
always hung between Ambrose and herself. To him a piano-tuner
appeared a remote and romantic figure. It suggested a world of
concerts, theatres, and Bohemian life. He was never quite clear
about the precise functions of a piano-tuner, but he regarded his
wife as the daughter of a public man, coming from a world far
removed from the narrow limits of the life she was forced to lead
with him.</p>

<p>In spite of her repeated professions of happiness, Ambrose
always felt a shade suspicious, not of her, but of his own ability
to satisfy her every demand. Sometimes he would observe her looking
round the little rooms, as though she were visualising what they
might contain. Perhaps she wanted a grand piano, or some inlaid
chairs, or embroidered coverings. He had not the money to buy these
things, and he knew that she would never ask for them; but still it
was there&mdash;that queer gnawing sense of insecurity. At dawn he
would wander through the coppices, drenched in dew, the gun under
his arm, and the dog close to heel. The sunlight would come
rippling over the jewelled leaves, and little clumps of primroses
and violets would reveal themselves. Life would be good then, and
yet somehow&mdash;it was not Winny's life. Only through their
children did they seem to know each other.</p>

<p class="poem">Jack and Jill went up the hill<br>
To fetch a pail of water;<br>
Jack fell down and broke his crown<br>
And Jill came tumbling after!</p>

<p>"Oo&mdash;Ambrose," the other boy was tugging at his beard, when
Winny spoke. He pretended to scream with pain before he turned to
his wife.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Will you be passing Mr. Mead's shop? We have run out of
candles."</p>

<p>"Oh? Roight be, my love. I'll be nigh there afore sundown. I
have to order seed from Crumblings."</p>

<p>He was later than he expected at Mr. Mead's shop. He had to wait
whilst several women were being served. The portly owner's new cash
register went "tap-tapping!" five times before he got a chance to
say:</p>

<p>"Evenin', Mr. Meads, give us a pound of candles, will ye?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Meads came in through a parlour at the back, in a rustling
black dress. She was going to a welfare meeting at the vicar's. She
said:</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Baines, hope you are all nicely."</p>

<p>A slightly disturbing sight met the eye of Ambrose. The parlour
door was open, and he could see a maid in a cap and apron clearing
away tea things in the gaily furnished room. The Meads had got a
servant! He knew that Meads was extending his business. He had a
cheap clothing department now, and he was building a shed out at
the back with the intention of supplying petrol to casual
motorists, but&mdash;a servant!</p>

<p>He picked up his packet of candles and muttered gruffly: "Good
evenin'."</p>

<p>Before he had reached the door he heard "Tap-tapping!"
<i>His</i> one and twopence had gone into the box. As he swung down
the village street, he muttered to himself:</p>

<p>"God! I wish I had his money!"</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>When Mrs. Meads returned from the welfare meeting at half-past
eight, she found Mr. Meads waiting for her in the parlour, and the
supper laid. There was cold veal and beetroot, apple pie, cheese
and stout.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I'm late, dear," she said.</p>

<p>"That's all right, my love," replied Mr. Meads, not looking up
from his newspaper.</p>

<p>"We had a lovely meeting&mdash;Mrs. Wonnicott was there, and
Mrs. Beal, and Mrs. Edwin Pillcreak, and Mrs. James, and Ada, and
both the Jamiesons, and the Vicar was perfectly sweet. He made two
lovely speeches."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was nice," said Mr. Meads, trying to listen and read a
piquant paragraph about a divorce case at the same time.</p>

<p>"I should think you want your supper."</p>

<p>"I'm ready when you are, my love."</p>

<p>Mr. Meads put down his newspaper, and drawing his chair up to
the table, began to set about the veal. He was distinctly a man for
his victuals. He carved rapidly for her, and less rapidly for
himself. From this you must not imagine that he treated his wife
meanly. On the contrary, he gave her a large helping, but a close
observer could not help detecting that when carving for himself he
seemed to take more interest in his job. Then he rang a little
tinkly hand-bell and the new maid appeared.</p>

<p>"Go into the shop, my dear," he said, "and get me a pot of
pickled walnuts from the second shelf on the left before you come
to them bales of calico."</p>

<p>The maid went, and Mrs. Meads clucked:</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;being a bit extravagant to-night, John."</p>

<p>"The labourer is worthy of his hire," quoted Mr. Meads
sententiously. He put up a barrage of veal in the forefront of his
mouth&mdash;he had no back teeth, but managed to penetrate it with
an opaque rumble of sound. "Besides we had a good day
to-day&mdash;done a lot of business. Pass the stout&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it," replied Mrs. Meads. "It's about time
things began to improve, considerin' what we've been through. Mrs.
Wonnicott was wearin' her biscuit-coloured taffeta with a new lace
yoke. She looked smart, but a bit stiff for the Welfare to my way
of thinkin'."</p>

<p>"Ah!" came rumbling through the veal.</p>

<p>"Oh, and did I tell you Mrs. Mounthead was there, too? She was
wearing her starched ninon&mdash;no end of a swell she looked."</p>

<p>Mr. Meads's eyes lighted with a definite interest at last. Mrs.
Mounthead was the wife of James Mounthead, the proprietor of that
handsome hostelry, "The Die is Cast." When his long day's work was
over, Mr. Meads would not infrequently pop into "The Die is Cast"
for an hour or so before closing time and have a long chat with Mr.
James Mounthead. He swallowed half a glass of stout at a gulp, and
helped himself liberally to the pickled walnuts which the maid had
just brought in. Eyeing the walnuts thoughtfully, he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, so she's got into it, too, has she?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she's really quite a pleasant body. She told me coming
down the street that her husband has just bought Bolder's farm over
at Pondhurst. He's setting up his son there who's marrying Kate
Steyning. Her people have got a bit of money, too, so they'll be
all right. By the way, we haven't heard from Charlie for nearly
three weeks."</p>

<p>Mr. Meads sighed. Why were women always like that? There was
Edie. He was trying to tell her that things were improving, going
well in fact. The shed for petrol and motor accessories was nearly
finished; the cheap clothing department was in full swing; he had
indulged in pickled walnuts for supper (her supper, too); and there
she must needs talk about&mdash;Charlie! Everybody in the
neighbourhood knew that their son Charlie was up in London, and not
doing himself or anybody else any good. And almost in the same
breath she must needs talk about old Mounthead's son. Everyone knew
that young Mounthead was a promising industrious fellow. Oh! and so
James had bought him Bolder's farm, had he? That cost a pretty
penny, he knew. Just bought a farm, had he? Not put the money into
his business; just bought it in the way that he, Sam Meads, might
buy a gramophone, or an umbrella. Psaugh!</p>

<p>"I don't want no tart," he said, on observing Edie begin to
carve it.</p>

<p>"No tart!" she exclaimed. "Why, what's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," he replied. "Don't feel like
it&mdash;working too hard&mdash;bit flatulent. I'll go out for a
stroll after supper."</p>

<p>An hour later he was leaning against the bar of "The Die is
Cast," drinking gin and water, and listening to Mr. Mounthead
discourse on dogs. The bar of "The Die is Cast" was a
self-constituted village club. Other cronies drifted in. They were
all friends of both Mr. Meads and Mr. Mounthead. Mrs. Mounthead
seldom appeared in the bar, but there was a potman and a barmaid
named Florrie; and somewhere in the rear a cook, two housemaids, a
scullerymaid, a boy for knives and boots, and an ostler. Mr.
Mounthead had a victoria and a governess car, as well as a van for
business purposes, a brown mare and a pony. He also had his own
farm well stocked with pigs, cattle, and poultry. While taking his
guests' money in a sleepy leisurely way, he regaled them with the
rich fruits of his opinions and experiences. Later on he dropped
casually that he was engaging an overseer at four hundred a year to
take his son's place. And Mr. Meads glanced round the bar and noted
the shining glass and pewter, the polished mahogany, the little
pink and green glasses winking at him insolently.</p>

<p>"He doesn't know what work is either," suddenly occurred to him.
Mr. Mounthead's work consisted mostly in a little bookkeeping, and
in ordering people about. He only served in the shop as a kind of
social relaxation. If he, Sam Meads, didn't serve in his shop
himself all day from early morning till late evening, goodness
knows what would happen to the business. Besides&mdash;the
pettiness of it all! Little bits of cheese, penny tins of mustard,
string, weighing out sugar and biscuits, cutting bacon, measuring
off ribbons and calico, and flannelette. People gossiping all day,
and running up little accounts it was always hard to collect. But
here&mdash;oh, the snappy quick profit. Everybody paying on the
nail, served in a second, and what a profit! Enough to buy a farm
for a son as though it was&mdash;an umbrella. Walking home, a
little dejectedly, later on, he struck the road with his stick, and
muttered:</p>

<p>"Damn that man!"</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Mrs. James Mounthead was rather pleased with her starched ninon.
She leant back luxuriously in the easy chair, yawned, and pressed
her hands along the sides of her well-fitting skirt. Gilt bangles
round her wrists rattled pleasantly during this performance. A
paste star glittered on her ample bosom. She heard James moving
ponderously on the landing below; the bar had closed. He came
puffily up the stairs and opened the door.</p>

<p>"A nightcap, Queenie?" he wheezed through the creaking machinery
of his respiratory organs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mounthead smiled brightly. "I think I will to-night,
Jim."</p>

<p>He went to a cabinet and poured out two mixed drinks. He handed
his wife one, and raising the other to his lips said:</p>

<p>"Well, here's to the boy!"</p>

<p>"Here's to James the Second!" she replied, and drank deeply. Her
eyes sparkled. Mrs. Mounthead was excited. The bangles clattered
against the glass as she set it down.</p>

<p>"Come and give me a kiss, old dear," she said, leaning back.</p>

<p>Without making any great show of enthusiasm, James did as he was
bidden. He, too, was a little excited, but his excitement was less
amorous than commercial. He had paid nearly twelve hundred pounds
less for Bolder's farm than he had expected. The news of his
purchase was all over the neighbourhood. It had impressed everyone.
People looked at him differently. He was becoming a big man,
<i>the</i> big man in those parts. He could buy another farm
to-morrow, and it wouldn't break him. And the boy&mdash;the boy was
a good boy; he would do well, too.</p>

<p>A little drink easily affected Mrs. Mounthead. She became
garrulous.</p>

<p>"I had a good time at the Welfare, though some of the old cats
didn't like me, I know. Ha, ha, ha, what do I care? We could buy
the whole lot up if we wanted to, except perhaps the Wonnicotts.
Mine was the only frock worth a tinker's cuss. Lord! You should
have seen old Mrs. Meads! Looked like a washerwoman on a Sunday.
The vicar was ever so nice. He called me madam, and said he 'oped I
often come. I gave a fiver to the fund. Ha, ha, ha, I didn't tell
'em that I made it backing 'Ringcross' for the Nunhead Stakes
yesterday! They'd have died."</p>

<p>During this verbal explosion, James Mounthead thoughtfully
regarded his glass. And he thought to himself: "Um. It's a pity
Queenie gives herself away sometimes." He didn't particularly want
to hear about the Welfare. He wanted to talk about "James the
Second" and the plans for the future. He wanted to indulge in the
luxury of talking about their success, but he didn't want to boast
about wealth in quite that way. He had queer ambitions not
unconnected with the land he lived on. He had not always been in
the licensing trade. His father had been a small landed proprietor
and a stock breeder; a man of stern, unrelenting principles. From
his father he, James Mounthead, had inherited a kind of reverence
for the ordered development of land and cattle, an innate respect
for the sanctity of tradition, caste, property and fair dealing.
His wife had always been in the licensing trade. She was the
daughter of a publican at Pondhurst. As a girl she had served in
the bar. All her relations were licensing people. When she had a
little to drink&mdash;she was apt to display her worst side, to
give herself away. James sighed.</p>

<p>"Did Mrs. Wonnicott say anything about her husband?" he asked,
to change the subject.</p>

<p>"You bet she did. Tried to put it across us&mdash;when I told
her about us buying Bolder's farm&mdash;said her old man had
thought of bidding for it, but he knew it was poor in root crops
and the soil was no good for corn, and that Sturge had neglected
the place too long. The old cat! I said: 'Yes, and p'raps it
wouldn't be convenient to pay for it just now, after 'aving bought
a lawn mower! Ha, ha, ha. He, he, he. O my!'"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have said that," mumbled Mr. Mounthead, who knew,
however, that anything was better than one of Queenie's violent
reactions to quarrelsomeness. "Come on, let's go and turn in, old
girl."</p>

<p>An hour later, James Mounthead was tossing restlessly between
the sheets. Queenie's reference to the Wonnicotts had upset him. He
could read between what she had said sufficiently to envisage a
scene, which he himself deplored. Queenie, of course, had given
herself away again to Mrs. Wonnicott. He knew that both the
Wonnicotts despised her, and through her, him. He had probably as
much money as Lewis Wonnicott, if not more. He certainly had a more
fluid and accumulative way of making it, but there the matter
stopped. Wonnicott was a gentleman; his wife a lady. He, James,
might have been as much a gentleman as Wonnicott
if&mdash;circumstances had been different. Queenie could never be a
lady in the sense that Mrs. Wonnicott was a lady. Wonnicott led the
kind of life <i>he</i> would like to live&mdash;a gentleman farmer,
with hunters, a little house property, and some sound vested
interests; a man with a great knowledge of land, horses, finance,
and politics.</p>

<p>He loved Queenie in a queer enduring kind of way. She had been
loyal to him, and she satisfied most of his needs. She loved him,
but he knew that he could never attain the goal of his vague
ambitions, with her clinging to his heels. He thought of Lewis
Wonnicott sleeping in his white panelled bedroom with chintz
curtains and old furniture, and his wife in the adjoining room,
where the bay window looked out on to the downs; and the heart of
James became bitter with envy.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>"I don't think I shall attend those Welfare meetings any more,"
remarked Mrs. Lewis Wonnicott with a slight drawl. She gathered up
her letters from the breakfast table and walked to the window.</p>

<p>In the garden below, Leach, the gardener, was experimenting with
a new mower on the well-clipped lawns. The ramblers on the pergola
were at their best. Her husband in a broad check suit and a white
stock, looked up from <i>The Times</i> and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, how is that, my dear?"</p>

<p>"They are getting such awful people in. That dreadful woman, the
wife of Mounthead, the publican, has joined."</p>

<p>"Old Mounthead's all right&mdash;not a bad sort. He knows a
gelding from a blood mare."</p>

<p>"That may be, but his wife is the limit. I happened to say
something about the new mower, and she was simply rude. An awful
vulgar person, wears spangles, and boasts about the money her
husband makes out of selling whisky."</p>

<p>"By gad! I bet he does, too. I wouldn't mind having a bit in his
pub. Do you see Canadian Pacifics are still stagnant?"</p>

<p>"Lewis, I sometimes wish you wouldn't be so material. You think
about nothing but money."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, my dear, I'm interested in a crowd of other
things&mdash;things which I don't make money out of, too,"</p>

<p>"For instance?"</p>

<p>"The land, the people who work on it, horses, cattle, game, the
best way to do things for everybody. Besides, ain't I interested in
the children? The two girls' careers at Bedales? Young Ralph at
Rugby and going up to Cambridge next year?"</p>

<p>"You know they're there, but how much interest you take, I
couldn't say."</p>

<p>"What is it you want me to do, my dear?"</p>

<p>"I think you might bestir yourself to get amongst better people.
The girls will be leaving school soon and coming home. We know no
one, no one at all in the neighbourhood."</p>

<p>"No one at all! Jiminy! Why, we know everyone!"</p>

<p>"You spend all your time among horse-breeders and
cattle-dealers, and people like Mounthead, and occasionally call on
the Vicar, but who is there of any importance that we know?"</p>

<p>"Lord! What do you want? Do you want me to go and call at
Crawshay Park, and ask Sir Septimus and Lady Letter to come and
make up a four at bridge?"</p>

<p>"Don't be absurd! You know quite well that the Letters are
entirely inaccessible. He's not only an M.P. and owner of half the
newspapers in the country, but a millionaire. They entertain house
parties of ministers and dukes, and even royalty. They can afford
to ignore even the county people themselves. But there are others.
We don't even know the county."</p>

<p>"Who, for instance?"</p>

<p>"Well, the Burnabys. You met St. John Burnaby at the
Constitutional Club two or three times and yet you have never
attempted to follow it up. They're very nice people and neighbours.
And they have three boys all in the twenties, and the girl
Sheila&mdash;she's just a year younger than Ralph."</p>

<p>"My word! Who's being material now?"</p>

<p>"It isn't material, it's just&mdash;thinking of the
children."</p>

<p>"Women are wonderful," muttered Lewis Wonnicott into his white
stock, without raising his head. Mrs. Wonnicott swept to the door.
Her thin lips were drawn in a firm straight line. Her refined hard
little face appeared pinched and petulant. With her hand on the
door-handle she said acidly:</p>

<p>"If you can spare half an hour from your grooms and pigs, I
think you might at least do this to please me&mdash;call on Mrs.
Burnaby to-day."</p>

<p>And she went out of the room, shutting the door crisply.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jiminy-Piminy!" muttered Mr. Wonnicott.
"Jiminy-Piminy!"</p>

<p>He stood up and shook himself. Then with feline intentness he
walked quickly to the French window, and opening it walked down the
steps into the garden. All the way to the sunk rose-garden he kept
repeating, "Jiminy-Piminy!"</p>

<p>Once among the rose-bushes he lighted his pipe. (His wife
objected to smoking in the house). He blew clouds of tobacco smoke
amongst imaginary green-fly. Occasionally he would glance furtively
out at the view across the downs. Half buried amongst the elms near
Basted Old Church he could just see the five red gables of the
Burnaby's capacious mansion.</p>

<p>"I can't do it," he thought, "I can't do it, and I shall have to
do it."</p>

<p>It was perfectly true he had been introduced to St. John Burnaby
and had spoken to him once or twice. It was also true that Burnaby
had never given any evidence of wishing to follow up the
acquaintanceship. Bit of a swell, Burnaby, connected with all sorts
of people, member of half a dozen clubs, didn't race but went in
for golf, and had a shooting box in Scotland. Some said he had
political ambitions, and meant to try for Parliament at the next
election. He didn't racket round in a check suit and a white stock
and mix with grooms and farm hands; he kept up the flair of the
gentleman, the big man, acres of conservatory, and peacocks, and a
son in the diplomatic service, a daughter married to a bishop. His
wife, too, came of a poor but aristocratic family. Over at the
"Five Gables" they kept nine gardeners and twenty odd servants.
Everything was done tip-top.</p>

<p>Lewis Wonnicott turned and regarded his one old man gardener,
trying the new mower, which Mrs. Mounthead had been so rude about
to Dorothy. Poor Dorothy! She was touchy, that's what it was. Of
course she <i>did</i> think of the children&mdash;no getting away
from it. She was ambitious more for them than for herself or
himself. She had given up being ambitious for him. He knew that she
looked upon him as a slacker, a kind of cabbage. Well, perhaps he
had been. He hadn't accomplished all he ought to. He had loved the
land, the feel of horse-flesh, the smell of wet earth when the
morning dews were on it. He had been a failure...a failure. He was
not up to county people. He was unworthy of his dear wife's
ambitions. Jiminy-Piminy! It would be a squeeze to send Ralph up to
Cambridge next year!</p>

<p>He looked across the valley at the five red gables among the
elms, and sighed.</p>

<p>"Lucky devil!" he murmured. "Damn it all! I suppose I must
go."</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>"You don't seem to realise the importance of it," said Gwendolen
St. John Burnaby as her husband leant forward on his seat on the
terrace, and tickled the ear of Jinks, the Airedale. "A career in
the diplomatic service without influence is about as likely to be a
success as a&mdash;as a performance on a violin behind a
sound-proof curtain. There's Lal, wasting his&mdash;his talents and
genius at that wretched little embassy at Oporto, and all you've
got to do is to drive three miles to Crawshay Park and put the
matter before Sir Septimus."</p>

<p>"These things, always seem so simple to women," answered Sir
John, a little peevishly.</p>

<p>"Well, isn't it true? Do you deny that he has the power?"</p>

<p>"Of course he has power, my dear, but you may not realise the
kind of life a man like that lives. Every minute of the day is
filled up, all kinds of important things crowding each other out.
He's always been friendly enough to me, and yet every time I meet
him I have an idea he has forgotten who I am. He deals in movements
in which men are only pawns. If I told him about Lal he would say
yes, he would do what he could&mdash;make a note of it, and forget
about it directly I turned my back."</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John Burnaby stamped her elegant Loyis heels.</p>

<p>"Is nothing ever worth trying?"</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish, Gwen, haven't I tried? Haven't I
ambition?"</p>

<p>"For yourself, yes. I am thinking of Lal."</p>

<p>"Women always think of their sons before their husbands. He
knows I've backed his party for all I'm worth. He knows I'm
standing for the constituency next time. When I get elected will be
the moment. I shall then have a tiny atom of power. For a man
without even a vote in Parliament do you think Letter is going to
waste his time?"</p>

<p>"Obstinate!" muttered Mrs. Burnaby with metallic clearness. The
little lines round the eyes and mouth of a face that had once been
beautiful became accentuated in the clear sunlight. The constant
stress of ambitious desires had quickened her vitality, but in the
process had aged her body before its time. She knew that her
husband was ambitious, too, but there was always just that little
something he lacked in the great moments, just that little special
effort that might have landed him among the gods&mdash;or in the
House of Lords. He had been successful enough in a way. He had made
money&mdash;a hundred thousand or so&mdash;in brokerage and dealing
indirectly in various manufactured commodities; but he had not even
attained a knighthood or a seat in Parliament. His heavy dark face
betokened power and courage, but not vision. He was indeed as she
had said&mdash;obstinate. In minnow circles he might appear a
triton, but living within the same county as Sir Septimus
Letter&mdash;Bah!</p>

<p>About to leave him, her movement was arrested by the approach of
a butler followed by a gentleman in a check suit and a white stock,
looking self-conscious.</p>

<p>Mrs. St. John Burnaby raised her lorgnette. "One of these local
people," she reflected.</p>

<p>On being announced the gentleman in the check suit exclaimed
rapidly:</p>

<p>"Excuse the liberty I take&mdash;neighbours, don't you know.
Remember me at the Constitutional Club, Mr. Burnaby? Thought I
would drop in and pay my respects."</p>

<p>St. John Burnaby nodded.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, quite. I remember,
Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Mr.&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wonnicott."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, of course. How do you do? My wife&mdash;Mr.
Wonnicott."</p>

<p>The wife and the Wonnicott bowed to each other, and there was an
uncomfortable pause. At last Mr. Wonnicott managed to say:</p>

<p>"We live over at Wimpstone, just across the valley&mdash;my
wife, the girls are at school, boy's up at Rugby."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;really?" This was Mrs. Burnaby, who was thinking
to herself:</p>

<p>"The man looks like a dog fancier."</p>

<p>"Very good school," said St. John Burnaby. "Hot to-day, isn't
it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's exceedingly warm."</p>

<p>"Do you golf?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't golf. I ride a bit."</p>

<p>"You must excuse me," said Mrs. St. John Burnaby, "I have got to
get a trunk call to London."</p>

<p>She fluttered away across the terrace, and into the house. Mr.
Wonnicott chatted away for several minutes, but St. John Burnaby
was preoccupied and monosyllabic. The visitor was relieved to
rescue his hat at last and make his escape. Walking down the drive
he thought:</p>

<p>"It's no good. He dislikes me."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact St. John Burnaby was not thinking about him
at all. He was thinking of Sir Septimus Letter, the big man, the
power he would have liked to have been. He ground his teeth and
clenched his fists:</p>

<p>"Damn it!" he muttered, "I will not appeal for young Lal. Let
him fight his own battles."</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>On a certain day that summer when the sun was at its highest in
the heavens, Sir Septimus Letter stood by the bureau in his cool
library and conversed with his private secretary.</p>

<p>Sir Septimus was wearing what appeared to be a ready-made navy
serge suit and a low collar. His hands were thrust into his trouser
pockets. The sallow face was heavily marked, the strangely restless
eyes peered searchingly beneath dark brows which almost met in one
continuous line. The chin was finely modelled, but not too strong.
It was not indeed what is usually known as a strong face. It had
power, but of the kind which has been mellowed by the friction of
every human experience. It had alert intelligence, a penetrating
absorption, above all things it indicated vision. The speech and
the movements were incisive; the short wiry body a compact tissue
of nervous energy. He listened with the watchful intensity of a dog
at a rabbit-hole. Through the door at the end of the room could be
heard the distant click of many typewriters.</p>

<p>The secretary was saying:</p>

<p>"The third reading of the Nationalization of Paper Industries
Bill comes on at five-thirty, sir. Boneham will be up, and I do not
think you will be called till seven. You will, of course, however,
wish to hear what he has to say."</p>

<p>"I know what he'll say. You can cut that out, Roberts. Get Libby
to give me a pr&eacute;cis at six forty-five."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. Then there will be time after the Associated
News Service Board at four to see the minister with regard to this
question of packing meetings in East Riding. Lord Lampreys said he
would be pleased if I could fix an appointment. He has some
information."</p>

<p>"Right. What line are Jennins and Castwell taking over
this?"</p>

<p>"They're trying to side-track the issue. They have every
un-associated newspaper in the North against you."</p>

<p>"H'm, h'm. Well, we've fought them before."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. The pressure is going to be greater this time, but
everyone has confidence you will get them down."</p>

<p>The little man's eyes sparkled. "Roberts, get through on the
private wire to&mdash;Lambe; no, get through to all of them, and
make it quite clear. This is not to be a party question. They're to
work the unctious rectitude stuff, you know&mdash;liberty of the
subject and so on."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir. The car comes at one-fifteen. You are lunching
with Cranmer at Shorn Towers, the Canadian paper interests will be
strongly represented there. I will be at Whitehall Court at three
with the despatches. It would be advisable, if possible, to get
Loeb of the finance committee. Oh, by the way, sir, I had to advise
you from Loeb. They have received a cabled report of the expert's
opinion from Labrador. There are two distinct seams of coal on that
land you bought in '07. A syndicate from Buffalo have made an
offer. They offer a million and a quarter dollars down."</p>

<p>"What did we pay?"</p>

<p>"One hundred and twenty thousand."</p>

<p>"Don't sell."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you seen my wife lately?"</p>

<p>"I have not seen Lady Letter for some days, sir. I believe she
is at Harrogate."</p>

<p>The little man sighed, and drew out a cigarette-case, opened it
and offered one to Roberts, who accepted it with an elegant
gesture. Then he snapped it to, and replaced it in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Damn it, Roberts, Reeves says I mustn't smoke."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!&mdash;only a temporary disability I trust, sir."</p>

<p>"Everything is temporary, Roberts."</p>

<p>With his hands still in his pockets, he walked abstractedly out
of the room. A little ormolu clock in the outer corridor indicated
twenty minutes to one. The car was due at one-fifteen. Thirty-five
minutes: oh, to escape for only that brief period! Through the
glass doors he could see his sister, talking to two men in golfing
clothes, some of the house party. The house party was a perpetual
condition at Crawshay. He turned sharply to the right, and went
through a corridor leading out to the rear of the garage. He
hurried along and escaped to a path between two tomato houses. In a
few moments he was lost to sight. He passed through a shrubbery,
and came to a clearing. Without slackening his pace, he walked
across it, and got amongst some trees. The trees of Crawshay
Park&mdash;his trees!...He looked up at the towering oaks and elms.
Were they his trees&mdash;because he had bought them? They were
there years before he was born. They would be there years after his
death. He was only passing through them&mdash;a fugitive.
"Everything is temporary, Roberts&mdash;" Yes, even life itself.
Jennins and Castwell! Of course they wanted to get him down! Were
they the only ones? Does one struggle to the top without hurting
others to get there? Does one get to the top without making
enemies? Does one get to the top without suffering, and bitterness,
and remorse? The park sloped down to a low stone wall, with an
opening where one could obtain a glorious view across the weald of
Sussex. The white ribbon of a road stretched away into
infinity.</p>

<p>As he stood there, he saw a dark swarthy figure clamber down a
bank, and stand hesitating in the middle of the road. He was a
tramp with a stubbly red beard nearly concealing his face, and a
filthy black green suit. In his hand he carried a red handkerchief
containing his worldly belongings&mdash;a door-knob, a portion of a
foot-rule, a tin mug stolen from a workhouse, some date stones, an
onion, the shutter of a camera, and two empty match-boxes.</p>

<p>Sir Septimus did not know this fact; he merely regarded the
tramp as an abstraction. He observed him hesitate, exchange a word
with a field labourer, look up at the sky, hunch his shoulders, and
suddenly set out with long swinging strides down the white road.
Whither? There stirred within the breast of the millionaire a
curious wistful longing. Oh, to be free! To be free! To walk across
those hills without a care, without a responsibility. The figure,
with its easy gait, fascinated him. The dark form became smaller
and smaller, swallowed up in the immensity of nature. With a groan,
Sir Septimus Letter buried his face in his hands and murmured:</p>

<p>"Lucky devil!...lucky devil! O God! If I could die..."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>26. THE SPOIL-SPORT</h2>

<p>I can't remember how we got on to the question of
"spoil-sports," but I know that the Colonel suddenly became very
indignant about them. He, Jimmy Tamaren, and I were seated in a
large flat-bottomed punt, tied up to stakes, in the middle of a
backwater on the grounds of old Sir John Gostard, whose guests we
were. We were lolling there, smoking and talking, and waiting for
the sun to get lower in the heavens, at which time we proposed to
do a little of what is known as rough fishing. I think the subject
of spoil-sports must have arisen from the obvious beauty and
attractiveness of our setting; a perfect place and time of day for
lovers. It seemed absurd somehow that three men should monopolise
it all. And there was something pleasantly ironical in the
situation that the eldest of us, to whom erotic experiences could
have been little more than a fragrant memory, was the one to wax
indignant about this tampering with the prerogatives of lovers.</p>

<p>"These blackmailers that you hear of in the parks and on
heaths," he said. "I'd like to wring their necks." He wasted three
matches getting a light for his pipe, and then continued in a more
subdued tone:</p>

<p>"I often think how damned hard it is on the lower middle
classes, the artisan, and working classes generally, in the big
cities. A fellow meets a girl and gets keen on her, and he never
gets a chance to get her all alone to himself. Where can they go?
Probably both his people and her people are living in more or less
congested conditions. If he calls on her or she calls on him, they
never get a room to themselves. There's nothing to do but to walk
about the streets, or sit on a seat in the park. They are being
watched all the time. How can you make love to a girl when you know
that if you give her more than a brotherly peck on the cheek when
you meet and when you part, you will be accused of some sort of
criminal intentions?"</p>

<p>"They can always go to the pictures," suggested Jimmy.</p>

<p>The Colonel's eyes and moustache twitched in unison.</p>

<p>"That's a nice, stuffy, dirty solution," he spluttered. "The
very worst atmosphere for young lovers. There's nothing to do there
but grasp at each other in the dark. How can they talk, and say all
the things that lovers want to say with a frowsy band playing
nigger ragtime, and the people round them demanding silence? How
can you make love to a woman if you can't look into her eyes? How
can you concentrate when you are being constantly distracted by
close-ups of murders?"</p>

<p>"I leave it to you, partner," said Jimmy, nonchalantly.</p>

<p>A motor-boat went "touf-toufing" down the main stream, and our
punt rocked pleasantly under the effect of its back-wash.</p>

<p>The Colonel for the moment seemed to have spent his indignation,
and Jimmy took up the thread:</p>

<p>"I'm not sure it's not a salutary restriction for this
particular class. You see, I'm frankly a snob. When I was very
young I used to be a red-hot socialist like the Colonel."</p>

<p>"A socialist!" barked that gentleman, from his layers of
cushions. "What the devil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Some genius once said that if a man is not a socialist up to
the age of twenty-five it shows he has no heart. If he is a
socialist after twenty-five it shows he has no brains. This fits in
with my own case precisely. The Colonel's age I wouldn't like to
guess at."</p>

<p>"Who said anything about being a socialist?"</p>

<p>"The word was not used, but you implied that the lower classes
in this respect were being abused at the expense of the upper
classes. I'm rather inclined to think it's the other way about. The
passing of the chaperon has been a serious disaster to what is
known as the upper classes. I'm not a prig&mdash;at least I hope
I'm not&mdash;but I believe all our young people are being spoilt
by too much freedom. It is not so much that they go morally wrong
as that they go romantically wrong. Or rather that they lose
romance altogether. What happens to that exquisite thrill you get
in touching a girl's hand in a crowded room, the mysterious and
entrancing propinquity of her, when you know quite well you have
only got to ask her to come up the river with you, and she will
turn up, with her bobbed hair, her cigarettes, and her bare legs,
and be quite content to spend the afternoon with you in an obscure
backwater, and talk unblushingly about&mdash;well, the awful and
intimate things that girls do talk about these days. In my opinion
it would be to everyone's advantage, instead of agitating for more
freedom, to agitate for more chaperons, spoil-sports, and Nosey
Parkers."</p>

<p>"There is an element of bitterness in your comments, Jimmy," I
remarked.</p>

<p>Swallows were flying low, apparently supping on the swarms of
midges, upon whom unfortunately they seemed to make no impression.
An orange-coloured dragonfly darted hither and thither among the
reeds. The Colonel was heard banging out his pipe.</p>

<p>"I met a spoil-sport once," said Jimmy, reminiscently.</p>

<p>"It sounds like the beginning of a story," I said. "Once upon a
time there was a spoil-sport&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It does almost make a story," he replied.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you threw him into the river," suddenly bawled the
Colonel. "If you didn't throw him into the river I shall go to
sleep."</p>

<p>"It happened in a country singularly free from rivers, although
there were many dried-up river courses. It was indeed in Northern
Africa quite near the desert."</p>

<p>"Nothing will be rising for half-an-hour, Jimmy, so let's have
the yarn," I said.</p>

<p>Jimmy relighted his pipe with slow deliberation.</p>

<p>"It happened a good twenty years ago," he began. "I remember
there had been a little dust-up at the time because I wanted to
marry a girl, whom some people averred to be the first woman
chemist. In any case, she used to make up prescriptions for her
father, who had a chemist's shop at Staines, where we were then
living. I have entirely forgotten the girl's face, although I
believe she was dark, and used to wear bangles.</p>

<p>"I know that the upshot was that my father very generously sent
me abroad for three months by myself to study and reflect. He was a
great believer in travel and had already taken me with him to
Holland once, and to France twice. But this was to be an entirely
novel experience. I was, as it were, thrown into the deep end.</p>

<p>"I want to begin appropriately enough at Charing Cross Station.
Since those days I have been on the Continent some fifteen or
twenty times, and one thing always impresses me. You see the French
satirical journals with caricatures of English tourists, and you
are apt to say: 'Absurd!' but go to Charing Cross or Victoria
Station and see the Continental Express go off and lo and behold!
There they all are. Where do they come from, these people? You
never see them in England, except at these stations. And then an
hour before the train starts they come pouring in&mdash;elderly
ugly women, with mackintoshes, and protruding teeth; fat, red-faced
men, with walrus moustaches, wearing cloth caps and plus fours.
They swarm all over the train, and they swarm all over the
Continent. Wherever they go they clamour for eggs and bacon, and
marmalade, and whisky, and steak, and bass, and the <i>Daily
Mail</i>, and cold baths at inconvenient moments.</p>

<p>"On the morning I left England there was this usual galaxy. My
father, who came to see me off, had booked me a corner seat, which
was fortunate, as the train was very full. When I took my seat I
was relieved to find that the rest of the party in my carriage were
not all of the 'Englishman abroad' type. There was an elderly
gentleman with his wife, obviously cultured people, and their two
good-looking daughters, who were probably college girls. In spite
of my political creed the snob in me warmed to these pleasant
people, and I felt correspondingly shy in their presence. The
journey promised to be entertaining. About a quarter of an hour
before the train started, however, there was a certain amount of
commotion in the corridor, and in bundled one of my pet
aversions&mdash;a living model of a French caricature. He was
wearing loud tweeds and knickerbockers&mdash;we didn't call them
plus fours in those days&mdash;and he was thick-set, red-cheeked,
and he had a fair drooping moustache. He had a seat right opposite
me.</p>

<p>"I had of course no tangible reason to be aggrieved with this
individual, except that he made himself immediately so very much at
home, and in certain readjustments of the luggage rack he called me
'ma lad,' which made me feel young and ridiculous in the presence
of those other people; and when my father made some suggestion
about one of my bags, he said: 'That's all right, pa. I'll manage
it.' Which made my father seem old and somehow absurd. I went hot
and cold with the thought that these other highly respectable
people might think he was a friend or connection of mine. Such is
extreme youth!</p>

<p>"When the train started he immediately began talking to me in a
broad Lancashire accent. He said he came from Blundellsands and was
in the jute trade. I did not object to this so much; what
exasperated me was the fact that he began to pump me in a loud
voice about who I was, what I was doing, and what my business was.
I simply detested the man, and quite deliberately snubbed him by
muttering monosyllables over the top of a magazine cover. I had no
chance of conversation with the charming family.</p>

<p>"On the boat I lost them, and never saw them again. That is one
of the curses of travel, one is always meeting people whom you feel
might be your bosom friends for life, and then Nemesis in the form
of a guard or a ticket collector comes along and snatches them away
from you.</p>

<p>"Of course I saw plenty of the man from Blundellsands. He was
promenading the deck, smoking a bulldog pipe, and talking in a loud
voice to all and sundry. Once or twice he came up and spoke to
me&mdash;he seemed to have quite overlooked my attempts at
snubbing. He apparently regarded me as a small boy.</p>

<p>"He repeated: 'Well, lad, are ye all reet?' (I can't imitate
Lancashire accent, so don't ask me!) On the Paris train, to my
delight, I quite lost track of him, I hoped for ever.</p>

<p>"My plans were rather indefinite. I intended in any case to
visit Northern Italy, and possibly afterwards go South to Sicily.
But I had booked nothing beyond Paris. I may say that I had not
been many days in that intriguing city before my passion for the
girl who made up prescriptions began to wane. Paris smelt good.
There was that curious peaty, coffeeish smell about it that seemed
to betoken adventure. I stayed there a week, and then I booked a
ticket through to Milan.</p>

<p>"The night before I left I wandered around alone, and late in
the evening strolled into the Olympia. The entertainment was
singularly boring, consisting mostly of freak dancing or
equilibrists. After a time I went to the long bar at the back, and
had a demi-bock. I had only been sitting there five minutes when a
hand slapped me on the back and a voice said: 'Hallo, ma lad, how
art thee gettin' on?'</p>

<p>"I felt a curious sinking feeling at the pit of my stomach. What
a nuisance the man was! A moment's reflection told me that of
course this was just the kind of place I should meet him. It was my
own fault. I was as polite as I could be. He said: 'Ay, lad, when
thou'rt in a foreign country it's soomtimes nice to meet one of th'
own people.'</p>

<p>"One of my own people! In this cosmopolitan place chiefly
patronised by English and Americans it seemed rather an extravagant
form of solicitude. There being no one else to talk to, however,
and the evening being young for Paris, I stayed with him, and
afterwards we took a taxi out to Montparnasse, and my youthful
vanity was a little flattered by being able to show off my inner
knowledge of night life to this ponderous Lancastrian, who must
have been a good twenty years my senior.</p>

<p>"We parted in a friendly enough spirit, and he wanted to make an
appointment for the morrow, but I gave some evasive answer. I felt
I had done my duty by 'one of my own people.'</p>

<p>"I left the next day for Milan, and forgot all about him, which
was not surprising, for it was there that I met Desir&eacute;e
Freyre. I ran plump into her in the lounge of the Hotel Bristol,
after dinner. I will not bore you with a description of her. It is
sufficient to say that within five minutes of our meeting the girl
who made up prescriptions and indeed all the other girls who had
made my youthful heart to flutter, promptly became back
numbers.</p>

<p>"I don't even remember how I got into conversation with her. She
was travelling with a companion, a very plain, genial soul much
older than herself. Desir&eacute;e was of the limpid, helpless
sort, with large appealing eyes, a manner that suggested hidden
fires beneath an easy-going companionable exterior. She was the
kind of woman who called you 'my dear' on first acquaintanceship,
and persuaded you that your troubles were her troubles.</p>

<p>"We spent the next two days doing the sights of Milan together,
though what they were I couldn't tell you, for my eyes were
entirely occupied with my companion.</p>

<p>"I found that she and her friend had just done Northern Italy
and were on their way to Genoa, and then by easy stages along the
C&ocirc;te d'Azur to Marseilles, where they had booked berths to
Algiers. They proposed spending three months in Algeria.</p>

<p>"I had taken a ticket through to Florence, but when I suggested
cancelling it, and accompanying these two ladies to Algeria, I
found that the suggestion was accepted with encouraging readiness.
I wrote rather a light-headed letter to my father, telling him of
my change of plans, but of course not giving the reason.</p>

<p>"We left a few days later. I cannot describe that journey to
Marseilles. We stayed days and nights at Genoa, Bordighera,
Mentone, Monaco, and Nice. As my father wanted to eradicate the
memory of the chemist's assistant I'm sure he could not have chosen
a more effective way himself, though I am a little dubious whether
he would have chosen precisely these means. I was madly in love,
and this love had for its setting instead of the familiar byways of
Staines, a novel and romantic atmosphere of tamarisks, deep blue
sea, orange groves, picturesque people, and the eternal
accompaniment of bands of nomad musicians. I believe we were a
fortnight getting to Marseilles, but it went like a flash.</p>

<p>"We spent the first few days there lazing in the sun, inhaling
the perfume of early summer flowers, playing with the tame monkeys
that used to come down and gambol in the wood beyond the garden,
and occasionally going for a short drive in the vicinity. I got
more intimate with Desir&eacute;e here than I had done before.
There were times when she became serious, and told me about her
mother, who had been an opera singer, and her father, who had been
an engineer, and had invented some contraption for making thin
steel plates, and had made a lot of money and lost it, and made it
again, and lost it again. Both her parents were now dead.</p>

<p>"And one night, under a clump of pistoia trees, with the moon
making patterns on the ground at our feet, and on the white shawl
of my companion, she told me something which aroused my interests
even more, about her&mdash;husband, a major in the Artillery, who
had been killed in the war. And when she told me, I could not see
her face, for it was pressed against my own, but I could feel her
warm tears on my own cheek. She had a way, when I think she felt
she was becoming too intimate, of giving me an almost savage pat on
the cheek and saying: 'Oh, you boy, you!' She did so on this
occasion, and I felt my love for her ennobled by a great wave of
compassion.</p>

<p>"I must confess that there were moments when I was free from the
embraces of my beloved that I had moments of apprehension. She was
so entirely alien to the world I came from. I could not conceive
her as fitting into the social environment of Staines! My father
for instance&mdash;I dared not imagine a meeting between him and
Desir&eacute;e.</p>

<p>"In the hotel were many interesting people. I was not
unmindful&mdash;and indeed a little proud of&mdash;the glances of
envy that followed me about when I strolled on the terrace or into
the dining-room, accompanied by the beautiful Desir&eacute;e
Freyre. Of course, the eyes were focussed on her, but I knew that
they also looked at me to see who the lucky fellow was who had
captured so dazzling a prize. On only one occasion was I made to
feel a little disconcerted. One evening I was talking to the
companion in the lounge, waiting for Desir&eacute;e. She had some
little business to discuss with the hall-porter, and was talking to
him at the door. A party of French
people&mdash;newcomers&mdash;came down the stairs. There was an
elderly man with a black moustache. He glanced in the direction of
Desir&eacute;e, and then turned, and I heard him say to an old lady
in French: 'Gracious, mamma! Do you see who's here?'</p>

<p>"The old lady looked in the same direction, and another woman
came up. I could not hear what was said, but there was a good deal
of whispering and laughing, and shrugging of shoulders.</p>

<p>"The table of these people was within sight of ours, and I saw
Desir&eacute;e glance once in their direction. I thought I observed
a little frown pucker her brow as she turned away. She did not look
at them again.</p>

<p>"The next day she was anxious to put into effect a project we
had been discussing for some time. That was a visit to Constantine,
a wonderful old town, built on a limestone plateau.</p>

<p>"It was nearly two hundred miles from Algiers, but we could take
a train to El-Guerrah, and from there it was just a comfortable
five hours' ride in a diligence. I was hoping that I might have
Desir&eacute;e's company alone on this trip&mdash;or in any case
with only one companion&mdash;but as she could not resist
discussing it rather animatedly with the other hotel
habitu&eacute;s, several of them expressed a desire to accompany
us, and it would have been churlish to refuse. It was not till late
in the evening that I managed to get Desir&eacute;e to myself, and
then we escaped to a small summer-house in the grounds. That was an
eventful night for me, for she promised to marry me.</p>

<p>"The night air was intoxicating with its rich aroma of flowers
and unfamiliar herbs. My mind was in a whirl of ecstasy and
anticipation. I little suspected the unpleasant little shock being
prepared for me in the morning. Our diligence was to leave at
eleven o'clock, and we were to have lunch at a caravanserai on the
way.</p>

<p>"The diligence turned up rather before its time, and our party
began to assemble. I was talking to a Russian princess, and feeling
very much of the great world, when a thick-set figure in tweeds
came out of the hotel with the Commissionaire and made straight for
the diligence. I felt a wave of positive horror. It was the man
from Blundellsands!</p>

<p>"He did not see me for a moment. He was busy giving instructions
about luggage. Indeed, the whole party had collected and were ready
to get aboard when he saw me. His face lighted up:</p>

<p>"'Ay, laddie!' he exclaimed. 'Fancy seeing thee! Well, now,
that's fine. Art going Constantine by cooch?'</p>

<p>"I felt myself going hot and cold all over. I could tell by the
faces of the others that they were thinking: Who on earth is this
awful bourgeois person?</p>

<p>"But what could I do? There was no escaping from him. And he was
quite as justified in taking the trip as I was. The worst of it was
he insisted on sitting next to me, and bawling out about the places
he had been to, and asking me questions. And of course he
reiterated: 'Ay, when thee gets right away in a foreign country,
lad, it's fine to meet a fellow-countryman!'</p>

<p>"Fellow-countryman! I didn't want to talk to him, or have
anything to do with him. I wished he'd die. I felt, in truth, that
he had turned up as a kind of fate, an unpremeditated Spoil-sport
between myself and Desir&eacute;e.</p>

<p>"We stopped at several Arab villages on the way and probed about
in the markets which struck us as being curiously deserted.
Desir&eacute;e was angry with me. 'Can't you get rid of this awful
person?' she whispered. I could only shrug my shoulders and feel
helpless. He was wearing in his buttonhole a ridiculously large
bunch of purple heather. Seeing me look at it, he said: 'Lad, see
yon heather. Cooms all tha way from Bloondellsands. Ma sister sent
it wrapped oop in ma socks.' 'Rather like coals to Newcastle,' I
tried to sneer. 'Ay,' he answered. 'But when it cooms from th' own
people&mdash; There's a bit of common just outside oor
toon&mdash;'</p>

<p>"I managed to get to the other end of the diligence on the way
to the caravanserai. There we partook of a strange and wonderful
lunch, in which stewed bustard was a feature, I remember.</p>

<p>"Now in the strange occurrence that happened to me that day I
was convinced that the stewed bustard played the leading
r&ocirc;le. I was to learn a long while later that it had nothing
to do with it. But at the time I was dominated by this illusion.
Hanging up in the caravanserai had been a stuffed bustard. I had
never seen one before. In the middle of the afternoon, as we drove
over the sandy waste thickly studded with scrub and halfagrass, the
bustard I had eaten and the bustard that was hanging up became one
and the same bird. It seemed to flutter against the roof of the
diligence and make it darker and darker. I had the greatest
difficulty in seeing, hearing, or breathing. I remember at one time
a crowd of faces staring at me, and I was not certain who they
were, and not particularly interested. I knew I was ill, and that
all my powers of resistance were vanishing. My head seemed to be in
iron clamps, and my body was throbbing as though stirred by a
hundred fevers. I had no sense of time, only a sense of
impenetrable darkness, that increased, that increased&mdash;"</p>

<hr>

<p>Jimmy shook himself and gave a little shiver. The Colonel was
silent and invisible behind my back. The sun had already tipped the
horizon. There was no need for me to interrupt the flow of his
story, and he continued:</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you have even been unconscious for a long
time under the pressure of raging fever. It is horrible. Apart from
racking pains one is desperately unhappy in an inexplicable way.
The fever seems to get right through to one's soul. I had glimpses
of semi-consciousness, in which all the people I had ever known
became inconsequentially involved. After some interminable passage
of time I had a glimpse of reality. I awakened in some dim light,
and was aware of a woman in white gliding about the room. 'I have
been very ill' was the first intelligible thought I had had for a
long time, and then a name came involuntarily to my lips,
'Desir&eacute;e!'</p>

<p>"I know not how long passed between this brief return to
consciousness and another more placid one. It was a twilight hour,
and I felt cool, and master of myself. I waited patiently, and the
woman in white came back. It was not Desir&eacute;e. A wave of
disappointment flooded me, and I tried to speak, to protest against
this outrage. The nurse said in English: 'There, there! that's
better! Don't talk. I will give you something.' She poured a white
liquid between my lips. I gradually felt stronger, but she would
not talk or answer my questions. A French doctor came and examined
me. He came every day. At the end of nearly a week the nurse talked
a little. She told me I was in a ward of the Isolation Hospital of
the White Sisters at Algiers. 'But what has been the matter with
me? I feel as though I have had something awful&mdash;like
typhoid.' 'You have had something worse than that,' she said.</p>

<p>"'What was it?' I asked. 'Typhus,' she said quietly.</p>

<p>"'Typhus!'</p>

<p>"There was a little epidemic of it in some of the villages along
the coast, brought they say by a coaster from the Levant.</p>

<p>"'But you are English,' I said, fencing for time, my mind
occupied with other aspects of the case.</p>

<p>"'I am an Irish nun,' she answered. 'They put me to nurse you
because I speak English.'</p>

<p>"I waited, not quite knowing how to frame the questions I was
burning to ask. At last I said: 'I was with a party, going to
Constantine. Tell me, what happened to them?'</p>

<p>"'When they heard what was the matter with you they fled. They
hired a car and drove to El-Guerrah, and took the next train back
to Algiers.'</p>

<p>"'All of them?' I faltered.</p>

<p>"'No, one remained behind and nursed you, and somehow got you
back here.'</p>

<p>"I sighed contentedly. My spirits rose. I knew that <i>she</i>
in any case would not have deserted me under those conditions.
After a pause I whispered hoarsely: 'Where is she now?'</p>

<p>"'It was a he,' said the nurse in a low voice. 'An Englishman.
He said he came from Lancashire. Had it not been for him you would
have died.'</p>

<p>"I turned my face away, for I did not want the Irish nurse to
see it. I tried to speak as casually as I could.</p>

<p>"'Oh,' I said, 'what was his name? Did he leave his
address?'</p>

<p>"'No,' she answered, 'he went away quietly one morning. He left
neither name nor address. But look! he left his bunch of heather.
He said it was for luck&mdash;"look" he called it. He waited till
you were out of danger. On the morning he left he came and saw you
and said: "Poor laddie! I had a boy like you." He told me his boy
was killed in the South African War. And then as though to
apologise for his emotion, he said something about one must do what
one can for a fellow countryman.'</p>

<p>"'And then he went away?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, we none of us knew his name. He was very generous. By the
way,' she added, 'your father is here in Algiers. We telegraphed to
him. As soon as you are free from contagion we shall send you to
him.'"</p>

<hr>

<p>"You never saw the man from Blundellsands again?" I ventured.
"And what about the&mdash;your fianc&eacute;e?"</p>

<p>"You must remember," said Jimmy, "all this happened about twenty
years ago. Honestly I have no clearer recollection of her face than
I have of the girl who made up prescriptions. No, I never
saw&mdash;any of the party again. But from what I since heard one
other man came out of the affair with credit."</p>

<p>"Who was that?"</p>

<p>"The Frenchman who laughed in that hotel at Mustapha. Come,
let's get busy. The fish are rising."</p>

<p>"And the Colonel has gone to sleep," I answered. "That's because
you didn't throw your spoil-sport into the river!"</p>

<p>"Poor old chap! don't let's wake him up," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we shall have to," I said. "He's gone to sleep on
the gentles."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>27. ARPEGGIO</h2>

<p>It was not a pretty company. There was Diehl, who apparently
occupied the position of president. He had a square black beard,
and sinister blood-shot eyes. His thin sneering voice was pitched
on a high monotonous level. In this rather shabby little salon the
fourth floor of the Hotel St. Just in the Rue Papini&eacute;re, he
dominated the rest by his bulk, and his insolent sense of mental
superiority. It was apparent that he utterly despised the other
four. A stranger entering the room would undoubtedly have been
impressed by one characteristic of the whole company. To glance at
them it was almost impossible to tell either their ages or even
their nationalities. The plump little man they called Max, with his
waxed moustache and his heavy eyelids, might have been Portuguese.
On the other hand he might have been Belgian; his age anything
between thirty-five and fifty-five. The thin, highly-strung Luigi,
with his wild mop of dark hair and glittering eyes, might have been
Levantine. On the other hand, he might easily have come from the
mining districts of Yorkshire. His age was also indeterminate.
Orman, with his reddish hair, pale pink cheeks, and clear
expressionless eyes, was surely Irish. And yet there are many
Scandinavian people like him, especially among the Swedes. Kettner
was essentially Russian, but what does "Russian," with its sixty
odd varied races, mean? As for Diehl, with the square black beard,
he might have been the proprietor of unmentionable establishments
in Singapore, the director of an Art Museum at Dresden, or the
commissioner of a bible society in Boston. With a little more
spirituality of mien he might even have passed as the Metropolitan
of Constantinople.</p>

<p>But if this unpleasant quintette was divers in outward form and
bearing, it appeared to be solid in its opinion on certain matters.
That its mood was tense and "edgy" was evident from the way in
which the members spoke and behaved, and their united irritation
over the fact that a piano in an adjoining room was audible.</p>

<hr>

<p>During the whole time the "conference" had been
sitting&mdash;nearly an hour and a half&mdash;someone had been
playing an arpeggio scale in the next room. Over and over again, up
and down the keys raced the invisible fingers. There is something
about this ceaseless repetition to try the strongest nerves. Every
now and then one of the men would break off to curse "that
confounded piano."</p>

<p>But now the "conference" was finished, and Diehl leant back, a
cigar in the corner of his mouth, to give his last
instructions.</p>

<p>"Well, Max and Luigi, my fine cabbages, we must congratulate
you. Owing to the perfection of our arrangements, I fail to see how
anything could go wrong. The good fortune of this opportunity of
achievement has fallen to you. And if you carry it out with that
discretion which you, Luigi, showed in connection with the Grand
Duchess at Zurich, the blessings of the Fraternity will go with
you. What is the matter with you, Luigi? You seem all on edge."</p>

<p>Luigi was swaying restlessly, and passing his hands through his
tousled hair.</p>

<p>"I wish there wasn't forty-eight hours to wait. That's all.
And&mdash;and&mdash;that confounded piano gets on my nerves..."</p>

<p>Diehl laughed. "The piano! my dear comrade, when we have gone,
why don't you call on the young lady with a bouquet? I'm sure that
with your well-known fascination over the fair sex, the young lady
will gladly desist, if indeed she is not willing to be more
companionable. We will leave you and Max to make your final
arrangements. Now listen to me once more.</p>

<p>"It was the genius of Orman which foresaw the magnificent
opportunity afforded by this empty suite of rooms on the top floor
of the block of office buildings in the rue St. Augustin. It
commands on both the north and the east side the exact juncture
where the president's carriage will pass on Friday afternoon. It
also has command of the roof. While paying tribute to Orman, we
must also congratulate Kettner on the skilful way he has endeared
himself to the old concierge of the building. The old dear has a
curious penchant for anisette, it seems. Kettner is also a
connoisseur of anisette. You will have no trouble on that score. At
the moment when the&mdash;the&mdash;er&mdash;episode happens, the
concierge will be enjoying, shall we say, a profound afternoon nap.
The key of the top floor will be given you."</p>

<p>He looked round with a sigh of relief, noticing that the
arpeggio had ceased, and then continued:</p>

<p>"The work of our skilful young chemist, Cosimo Malatesti, is
also complete. He will arrive from Lyons on Friday morning,
carrying a small black bag, the kind usually carried by
piano-tuners. He will go straight to the Caf&eacute; Pigalle, where
you will all lunch together. And I implore you eat plenty and drink
nothing but one glass of cognac. You should be in your position at
2.15. The carriage passes at 2.30. You want time to take your
bearings, but not long enough to draw attention to yourselves. As
to which of you has the honour to carry the piano-tuner's bag, and
to&mdash;er&mdash;administer, the last coup of justice, that of
course you may settle between yourselves."</p>

<p>The arpeggio started again, and the president scowled. Luigi
mopped his brow and muttered:</p>

<p>"Damn that piano!"</p>

<p>Max took a long drink of water, and Kettner&mdash;perhaps the
most fervent member present&mdash;exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Down with presidents, kings and capitalists!"</p>

<p>"And pianists!" interjected Orman. This frivolous addition made
the company laugh uneasily. Diehl rose and put some papers
together.</p>

<p>"These papers," he said. "You had better keep till the morning
of&mdash;till Friday morning, when they will be fetched. Remember
they are the most secret papers of the Fraternity. There are here
the two lists, one French and one foreign. There is also here the
code. You will want these for warning our friends in Vienna, Rome,
Berlin, and London. Never let these papers out of your sight."</p>

<p>He re-lit the stump of his cigar, which had gone out, and
reached for his hat.</p>

<p>"One moment," said Luigi, with an hysterical catch in his voice.
"Is it true that&mdash;that&mdash;the Mole is working against
us?"</p>

<p>"Why should you think so?" said the president, frowning.</p>

<p>"You know, it's&mdash;it's common gossip. And after all it was
he who got Schlotz in Vienna, and the Pirelli brothers in
Amsterdam, and others..."</p>

<p>"How do you know? it was never proved."</p>

<p>"No. It was never proved because&mdash;he works in the dark,
underground. That's why."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" replied Diehl. "The Mole is a figment of the
imagination. He has no reality. Hysteria invented him."</p>

<p>"Moles can be caught in traps," interjected Kettner.</p>

<p>"How is it all these Brothers met their death in the same
way&mdash;a bullet through the keyhole or out of the darkness just
a day or a few hours before&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"There are, of course, risks in our community. But it is absurd
to ascribe these&mdash;er&mdash;accidents to the work of one man.
Your nerves are in a bad way, Luigi."</p>

<p>"Who is the Mole supposed to be, anyway?" said Orman.</p>

<p>"That's the point," said Luigi. "No one knows. No one has seen
him. I heard that he was an officer, a colonel who fought with the
White army under Deniken. But his nationality no one knows. They
say he's as clever as the devil, can speak eight languages, and is
a dead shot with a revolver. Apart from that..."</p>

<p>Max twirled the ends of his little waxed moustaches.</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of the Mole," he said, a little unconvincingly.
"It's the building I want to know about. Suppose we are seen coming
out of the empty flat just after..."</p>

<p>"I have already pointed out to you," said Diehl, with a peevish
drawl, as though reprimanding timorous school children, "there is
no danger at all. The block of offices is eight storeys high, the
roof concealed by buttresses and low brick walls. It will take
several minutes to focus from which direction this bolt from
Heaven, this engine of justice has fallen. Within a few seconds you
may be back in the corridors or staircases. There will probably be
a thousand people in the building on that occasion. It is a gala
day, and the good bourgeoisie will be entertaining their wives and
daughters. Who should take any notice of two handsome well-dressed
men like you, mingling with this crowd? There are four exits, and
Kettner will be waiting with a taxi, under the lamp-post by Lucien
Bahar's <i>comestible</i> establishment round the corner."</p>

<p>He flung his cloak around him, with a gesture of finality and
added:</p>

<p>"Good luck go with you!"</p>

<p>Kettner and Orman came forward and solemnly shook hands without
saying a word, and the three of them trouped out. Max sat staring
in front of him, occasionally twirling his moustaches, and then
turning over the papers on the table, without looking at them.
Luigi paced the room. In the middle of one turn he stopped, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Listen! that confounded scale has left off."</p>

<p>"You didn't want it to go on, did you?" said Max sullenly. "Now
that they've gone I'm going to have a drink." He rose and rang the
bell by the fireplace. After an interval of some seconds the door
opened and a waiter with a pale, impassive face entered.</p>

<p>"Bring up a small bottle of brandy and a seltzer," said Max.</p>

<p>"Certainly sir," said the waiter. He was just about to leave the
room when the arpeggio started again. Luigi called out:</p>

<p>"Wait!" Nervously plastering down his recalcitrant locks, he
said:</p>

<p>"Will you please ask the young lady in the next room if she
could desist from playing her scales for a bit, as there is a
gentleman in here who is unwell."</p>

<p>The waiter bowed and went out. After an interval the arpeggio
stopped. Luigi heaved a sigh of relief, and continued his prowl.
Max began to peruse the papers. Their respite was short-lived,
however. Just as the waiter re-entered with the brandy, seltzer,
and glasses the arpeggio started again.</p>

<p>"Did you give her my message?" said Max savagely.</p>

<p>The waiter set down the tray, and said gravely:</p>

<p>"The pianist said the request was impossible, sir."</p>

<p>The two men were so surprised they could think of no comment
until the waiter had retired, when Max exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Confounded impertinence! some beastly Conservatoire student
practising for a concert. Why the devil doesn't she play a tune
anyway?"</p>

<p>Then he growled:</p>

<p>"Come along, Luigi, let's check this list together. We've got to
go through with it anyway. Have a drink first."</p>

<p>He poured himself a generous portion of brandy and added a
little seltzer. Luigi, who was trembling, did the same, and sat
down by his side.</p>

<p>"Now, then," said Max. "There's Karl Bonnard. He's at Abbeville,
I see..."</p>

<p>Luigi was staring abstractedly at the door. Suddenly he
remarked:</p>

<p>"Did you notice one thing, Max?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"He said the pianist. He didn't say the lady pianist."</p>

<p>"Well, what does that matter to us, whether it's a man or a
woman making the damned row?"</p>

<p>"No. I was only wondering..."</p>

<p>"Don't be an imbecile. With the help of the code book we've got
to frame a general notification. So far as I can see it need be
only three words."</p>

<p>Luigi, who was not listening had again rung the bell.</p>

<p>"What are you ringing for?" said Max.</p>

<p>"I want to ask the waiter something."</p>

<p>"Idiot!" growled Max.</p>

<p>The waiter entered noiselessly.</p>

<p>"Waiter," said Luigi. "Just now you referred to the pianist. Is
the pianist a man or a woman?"</p>

<p>The waiter appeared to hesitate, then he replied:</p>

<p>"A gentleman, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah! what is his name?"</p>

<p>"It is not my custom, sir, to enquire the name of hotel
guests."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, look here. Will you go back to him, and ask him if he
will kindly not practise for a bit as there are two gentlemen in
the adjoining room engaged on important business. Perhaps he will
understand that."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p>The door closed, and a moment later the arpeggio stopped again.
But only for half a minute. Then it started again with renewed
vigour. The two men glanced at each other and muttered curses. The
waiter re-entered.</p>

<p>"The gentleman says he regrets he cannot comply with your
request. He says he does not doubt the importance of the business
you gentlemen have to discuss, but he himself has an important
appointment this evening, and he is getting his fingers in."</p>

<p>"He's getting his fingers in!" exclaimed Luigi.</p>

<p>"An expression common, I believe, in the musical profession,"
said Max.</p>

<p>"Getting his fingers in for what?"</p>

<p>"He's playing at a concert, I suppose. All right, waiter, you
can go. I shall ring up the manager's office."</p>

<p>When the waiter had gone Max shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"After all, why should we worry about it? We're not a couple of
hysterical women. If I remember rightly, old cauliflower, over the
affair of the Grand Duchess there was a Jazz band playing all the
afternoon in the Square beneath."</p>

<p>"A Jazz band! Yes, I could stand a Jazz band. It's this infernal
repetition, on and on, and on it goes, no change, no variety...It's
like a kind of fate..."</p>

<p>"Come now, I'll tick off the addresses. There are only about
seventeen in all. If you'll help me to frame the code message. We
can finish the whole thing in half an hour, and go out."</p>

<p>"It'll be playing when we come back."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I feel it. I feel it!" He went up and banged violently on the
wall with his fist and shouted: "Shut up, you devil!" The arpeggio
did not stop. Then Luigi snatched up the telephone, lifted the
receiver, and vibrated the bell. He called out: "Hullo! hullo!
hullo!" He continued to call, but there was no answer. "The
confounded thing's out of order," he barked.</p>

<p>His eye began to wander restlessly around the room, as though he
were taking stock of an eventuality. The room had only one door,
but opposite it was a French window leading on to a small iron
balcony which ran along the front of the hotel. Between the
division of each room the balcony was dissected by a low iron
grille, less than a metre in height. As it was evening a curtain
was drawn across the window which was nevertheless open, for the
night was close.</p>

<p>"Come and sit down," said Max. "You're getting on my nerves. Why
should I have to do all the work. Which brings me to the
point&mdash;you know, the point the president has left to us to
settle between us."</p>

<p>"What point?"</p>

<p>"On Friday we meet Cosimo at the Caf&eacute; Pigalle. Unless
your wits have gone completely astray you may remember that Cosimo
will have with him a small black piano-tuner's bag. One of us is to
have the honour of carrying it to the rue St. Augustin. One of us
is to have the honour of delivering it to its final destination.
Hein?"</p>

<p>An expression of cunning and fear crept into the face of
Luigi.</p>

<p>"Honour?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't it an honour?"</p>

<p>"If you consider it an honour you are welcome to it."</p>

<p>"Come, my old cauliflower, is that quite the way to speak? I'm
afraid such an expression getting to the ears of the
president&mdash;in our Fraternity you know the iron law 'There is
no going back.' There are special arrangements made for anyone who
either retires from the brotherhood, or goes back on his
obligations."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know, I know...well?"</p>

<p>Max drew a pack of cards from the drawer.</p>

<p>"We have the same rule, I take it. One cut, and the honour to
the highest. Shall I cut or will you?"</p>

<p>Luigi trembled, but his eyes were still wandering. Suddenly he
went up close to Max and whispered breathlessly:</p>

<p>"Do you see we could get him?&mdash;get him while he's sitting
there at the piano&mdash; The balcony!&mdash;the door is
open&mdash;his door too&mdash;one spring and we could settle him
for ever&mdash;"</p>

<p>He produced a steel knife from his hip-pocket.</p>

<p>The eyes of Max rolled.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about? You can't knife a man for playing
the piano just because it gets on your nerves. Don't be a
fool!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but..."</p>

<p>"Since you seem all over the place I will cut first. Do you
agree?"</p>

<p>Luigi suddenly seemed curiously indifferent. He merely nodded,
his eye wandering from the pack of cards to the curtain. He saw Max
cut, and hold the card up to him. It was the ten of clubs. Almost
mechanically he cut the pack himself and drew the knave. He heard
Max utter a gasp of relief, and then say in his suave voice:</p>

<p>"The honour is to you, comrade."</p>

<p>Luigi put down the card and continued to prowl around the room
like a beast of prey. Sometimes he drew his knife, stood by the
curtain, then replaced it. Max said abruptly:</p>

<p>"I fail to understand your extravagant interest in this
pianist."</p>

<p>Luigi stared at him, took another turn up and down, and then
came close up to him and whispered:</p>

<p>"You do, do you? You haven't yet grasped the truth of the whole
matter then?"</p>

<p>"Truth? what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That man in there playing the piano is The Mole!"</p>

<p>Almost as though he had been overheard the music stopped. Luigi
started and the slow sense of panic began to invade Max. It was Max
this time who muttered:</p>

<p>"What has he stopped for!" Then as if to reassure himself he
said:</p>

<p>"Nonsense! what makes you think so?"</p>

<p>Luigi again began to creep about the room. It was as though the
moment had come when the silence was more nerve-racking than the
playing. After some minutes to their relief the arpeggio started
again.</p>

<p>Again approaching his comrade Luigi said:</p>

<p>"Don't you remember the first thing we heard about 'The Mole?'
Before he went into the army, before he took up politics actively,
he used to be a famous pianist. He played at concerts all over the
world. I believe they said he was a Lithuanian or a Pole. He only
took up politics in middle life and even now he goes back to his
first love for spells. He mixes the two, they say. Listen, Max,
he's playing now. Can't you see while he's playing there&mdash;his
back to us probably..."</p>

<p>"Yes, you fool, but they would be bound to suspect us. They'd
get us. What about our Cause? the president?"</p>

<p>"What better service could we render the Cause than to rid it of
its greatest enemy?"</p>

<p>Max rang the bell.</p>

<p>"What did you ring the bell for?"</p>

<p>"I want to get a newspaper."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"If he's playing at a concert perhaps we can find out the
name?"</p>

<p>"What does the name matter? It will convey nothing to us."</p>

<p>"No, but we can tell the president. This is someone else's job.
We've got on all we want."</p>

<p>"Yes, but in the meantime..."</p>

<p>"Why doesn't that damned waiter come!"</p>

<p>He stood up and walked across to the door, and angrily turned
the handle. To his amazement he could not open the door. He rattled
the handle and banged on the panel. Then turned to Luigi:</p>

<p>"What does this mean? The bell, the telephone, the
door&mdash;we're locked in, we're cornered, do you see! Oh, my
God!"</p>

<p>It was apparent that Max had worked himself up into a greater
panic than the highly-strung Luigi. Indeed the latter suddenly
revealed himself as a man of action. Carrying his knife in his
sleeve he made a gesture as though to calm the other.</p>

<p>"That settles it, then. There is only one way. And that while
he's playing."</p>

<p>He made three stealthy strides across the room, and then the
arpeggio stopped suddenly in the middle of a passage. He gave a low
cry and dropped his knife, knelt and groped for it on the floor.
While he was fumbling for it Max cowered in the corner and screamed
faintly:</p>

<p>"Oh, God! hurry, hurry, Luigi! Get him. Oh, for a gun! Why the
devil didn't I have one? Turn the light off. Blast you!"</p>

<p>Luigi was on his feet again, the knife in his hand, moving
towards the curtain.</p>

<p>Max continued:</p>

<p>"Hurry, damn you! he'll shoot us! Mind the curtains! Look out! I
saw it move. Hullo! Hullo! who is that there behind the curtain?
Curse you!"</p>

<p>Luigi was within a yard of the curtain when two shots rang out
in rapid succession. Luigi fell forward on his face; Max crumpled
up against the wall. The curtain moved almost imperceptibly, and
there was a silence. After a time the arpeggio started again.</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant the door opened quietly and the
impassive waiter entered. He was wearing wash-leather gloves and in
one hand he carried two revolvers. He shut the door after him and
locked it. Then he glanced through the papers. He sorted out
several, folded them neatly together, and put them in his pocket.
Having satisfied himself that this part of the performance was in
order he went over to Max and put one of the revolvers in his right
hand. He then crossed to Luigi, twisted the body round and placed
the other revolver on the ground near the body. He then proceeded
to turn over the side table quietly, scattering ornaments, vases
and bottles over the floor. He did the same with two chairs and a
screen. He then turned and surveyed his work, with his head on one
side, like an artist regarding a picture to which he has put the
finishing touches. No further accents apparently being required, he
sat at the table and picked up the telephone receiver. After a
brief pause he said quietly:</p>

<p>"Will you please give me room twenty-four."</p>

<p>A minute passed and the piano stopped abruptly. Speaking in a
low voice he said:</p>

<p>"Everything in order, colonel. My hearty congratulations! I have
both the lists and the code. Exactly. I will now inform the
management of this deplorable tragedy. There are all the evidence
of a grim struggle. It may never be known what caused this quarrel
which has ended so tragically. Exactly. Not at all, not at all. By
the way, Monsieur Doumergue, the Conductor of the Philharmonic,
rang up. He begged me not to disturb you if you were working. He
only wanted to ask you if you would be so kind as to be at the
concert to-night ten minutes early. Exactly. He just wants to
consult you about a passage in the slow movement. He said he was
under the impression at the rehearsal yesterday that you thought he
took it a shade too slowly. Exactly. That will be eight-twenty,
then, colonel. Very good. Not at all. Au revoir."</p>

<p>The waiter hung up the receiver and looked around him. The piano
started again, but this time the invisible pianist was not playing
an arpeggio but the slow movement of the Emperor Concerto. The
waiter smiled and sat there for a moment as though entranced,
murmuring to himself:</p>

<p>"Exquisite! exquisite!"</p>

<p>Then, as though starting out of a dream, he arose, surveyed the
scene once more, took off his wash-leather gloves and put them in
his pocket. Having gone to the door, and unlocked it, he returned
to the telephone, picked up the receiver, and said in an agitated
voice:</p>

<p>"For God's sake give me the manager's office..."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>28. "FACE"</h2>

<p>It will not, of course, surprise you to know that it was at the
Cravenford National School that he was first known as "Face." The
people of Essex are well-known for their candour and lucidity of
expression. He was an exceptionally&mdash;well, plain boy. There
was nothing abnormal, or actually mal-formed about him, it was only
that his features had that perambulatory character which is the
antithesis of classic. It was what the Americans call a "homely"
face. The proportions were all just wrong, the ears actually
protruding, the jaw too lantern, the eyes actually too wide apart.
Moreover, his figure was clumsy in the extreme. He seemed all
hands, and feet, and knees, and chin. It was impossible for him to
pass any object without kicking it. Neither was his personality
enhanced by his manner, which was taciturn and sullen,
<i>gauche</i> in the extreme. The games and amusements of other
boys held no attractions for him. He made no friends, exchanged no
confidences, distinguished himself at nothing. Yet those of the
impatient world who found time to devote a second glance to this
uncouth exterior were bound to be impressed by the appeal of those
deep brown expectant eyes.</p>

<p>They were not essentially intelligent eyes, but they had a kind
of breadth of sympathy, a profound watchfulness, like the eyes of
some caged animal to whom the full functions of its being had not
so far been revealed.</p>

<p>It was the universality of this nickname, "Face," which
preserved it, for the boys of Cravenford National School knew that
Caleb Fryatt resented it, and individually they feared him. That
very clumsiness and imperviousness of his was apt to be
overwhelming when adapted to militant purposes. Not that he was
easy to rouse, but it was difficult to know when he was
roused&mdash;he gave no outward manifestation of it&mdash;but when
he was, it was difficult to get him to stop. He was a grim and
merciless fighter, who could take punishment with a kind of morbid
relish. It only inspired him to a more terrible onslaught. The boys
preferred to attack him in company, and then usually vocally, by
peeping over the churchyard wall and calling out:</p>

<p>"Face! Face! Oh, my! There's a face!"</p>

<p>The tragic setting of his home life explained much. He had had a
brother and two elder sisters, all of whom had died in infancy. He
lived with his father and mother in a meagre dilapidated cottage a
mile beyond the church. His father worked at a stud farm, at such
moments as the mood for work was upon him. He was a man of morose
and vicious temper, quickened by spasmodic outbreaks of alcoholic
indulgence. Of poor physique, he was nevertheless a dangerous
engine of destruction in these moods, particularly in respect to
the frailer sex. Caleb had been brought up in a code which
recognised unquestioningly the right of might, which accepted tears
and blows as a natural concomitant to its reckoning. He had stood
powerless and affrighted at the vision of his little mother beaten
unreasonably almost to insensibility, and he had never heard her
complain. His own body was scarred by the thousand attentions of
sticks and belts. He, too, had not complained. In some dumb way he
suffered more from the blows his mother received than he did from
those he received himself.</p>

<p>But he was growing up now&mdash;ugly, clumsy old "Face." When at
the age of fourteen he passed through the first standard and out of
the school, he was already as tall as his father, and somewhat
thicker in girth, more agile, tougher in fibre. The significance of
this development did not occur to him at the time. He was sent to
work at Sam Hurds', the blacksmith, a dour, intelligent, religious
giant, who instructed him in the intricacies of his craft with
relentless thoroughness, but without much sympathy. The boy liked
the work, although he showed no great aptitude at it. He had a way
of plodding on, appearing to understand, serving long hours, and
then in a period of abstraction forgetting all that he had been
told. He loved the blazing forge, the clang of metal upon metal,
the sheen upon the carter's horses that came in to be shod, the
sunlight making patterns on the road outside...</p>

<p>He was two years with Sam Hurds. At seventeen his muscles were
like a man's. His overgrown, hulking body like a fully developed
farm labourer's. His appearance had not improved. Even the smith
adopted the village nickname and called him "Face." At first it was
"Young Face," then "Face," then as their sombre familiarity
developed, and the smith realised the boy's sound qualities and the
something far too old for his years, it became "Old Face." He knew
that his assistant had no powers of adaptability, little invention,
not a very real grasp of the essentials, but at the same time he
knew he could trust him. He would do precisely as he was told. He
would stick to it. He could be relied upon like a sheep dog.
Nothing could shift him from his post of duty.</p>

<p>The smith was right, but he had not allowed for those outward
thrusts of fate which upset the soberest plans.</p>

<p>One night Caleb arrived home and found his mother crying. He had
never seen her cry before. He regarded her spellbound.</p>

<p>"What is it, mother?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, lad, nothing. Come, your tea's keeping warm upon the
hob. There's a pasty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, you wouldn't cry for nowt, mother. Lift up your head."</p>

<p>She lifted up her head and dashed the tears away, but as she
moved toward the kitchen he noticed that she was trying to conceal
a limp. He caught her up.</p>

<p>"He has been striking you again."</p>

<p>"It's nothing, lad."</p>

<p>"Show me."</p>

<p>He pulled her down to him and she wept again. Lifting the hem of
her skirt, she revealed her leg above the ankle, bound up in
linen.</p>

<p>"He kicked me, dear, but it is nothing. It will pass."</p>

<p>Caleb ate his tea in silence. His table manners were never of
the finest, and on this occasion he masticated his food, and
swilled his tea, like an animal preoccupied with some disturbance
of its normal life. Afterward he sat apart and thought, his mother
busy with household matters. Later she popped across the road to a
neighbouring cottage to borrow some ointment.</p>

<p>While she was out his father returned. It was getting dark, and
a fine rain was beginning to fall. His father came stumbling up the
cottage garden singing. Caleb blocked his passage in the little
entrance hall, and said deliberately:</p>

<p>"You didn't ought to have kicked mother."</p>

<p>His father, emerging from the shock of surprise, scowled at
him.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"You didn't ought to have kicked mother."</p>

<p>For a moment Stephen Fryatt was speechless, then he lurched
forward and pushed his son away.</p>

<p>"What the devil's it to do with you, whipper-snapper?"</p>

<p>Caleb thrust his father back against the wall and repeated:</p>

<p>"You didn't ought to have kicked her."</p>

<p>Then Stephen saw red. He struck at his son with his clenched
hand, and the blow split the boy's ear. Caleb took his father by
the throat and shook him. The latter tried to bring his knee into
play. At this foul method of attack, Caleb, too, became angry.
Those long powerful fingers gripped tighter. He closed up, and
flung his father's body against the lintel of the door. He did not
realise his own newly developed strength. When his mother returned
a little later she found her man lying in the passage with the back
of his head in a pool of blood, her son hovering ghost-like in the
background. She gave a cry:</p>

<p>"What's this ye've done, Caleb?"</p>

<p>A hollow voice came out of the darkness:</p>

<p>"He didn't ought to have kicked ye, mother."</p>

<p>She screamed and, kneeling upon the floor, she supported the
battered head upon her knee. It appeared an unrecognisable thing,
the hair so much blacker in the ivory-hued face, the eyes staring
stupidly.</p>

<p>Followed then a shifting phantasmagoria, scenes and emotions
incomprehensible to the defender. Neighbours, and doctors and
policemen, talking and arguing, whispering together, pointing at
him. He was led away. In all that early turmoil, and in the more
bewildering proceedings which followed, the one thing which
impressed him deeply was the attitude of his mother. She had
changed toward him entirely. She accused him, reviled him, even
cursed him. He would ponder upon this in his dark cell at night. He
had never imagined that his mother could have loved his
father&mdash;not in that way, not to that extent. His brown ox-like
eyes tried to penetrate the darkness for some solution. He had no
fear as to what they would do with him, but everything was
inexplicable...unsatisfying. The days and weeks which
followed&mdash;he lost all sense of time&mdash;added to the sense
of mystification. He appeared to be passed from one judge to
another, beginning with a gentleman in a tweed suit and
knickerbockers, and ending with a very old man in a white wig and
gold-rimmed glasses, of whom only the head and the thin pale
fingers seemed visible. Yes, yes, why did they keep on torturing
him like this? He had answered all the questions again and again,
always giving the same replies, always ending up with the solemn
asseveration:</p>

<p>"He didn't ought to have kicked her."</p>

<p>At the same time he had never meant to kill his father. He had
under-estimated his strength. He had become very strong in the
forge. His father had attacked him first. It was unfortunate that
the back of Mr. Fryatt's head had struck the sharp corner of the
lintel post. He was in any case crazy with drink. The boy was only
seventeen. He believed he was defending his mother. Of course,
these pleas were not his. This version of the case had not occurred
to him, but to his surprise a learned-looking gentleman, who had
visited him in his cell, had stood up in Court and made them
vehemently. And hearing the case put like that Caleb nodded his
head. He hadn't thought of it in that light, but it was quite true.
Oh, but the arguments which ensued! The long words and phrases, the
delays, and pomp and uncertainty. Never once did the question seem
to come up as to whether his father "ought to have done it," or
not. According to his mother his father appeared to have been
almost a paragon of a father.</p>

<p>It was all settled at last, and he was sent away to a "Home" for
two years.</p>

<p>Home! The ironic travesty of the word penetrated his thick skull
immediately he had passed what looked like a prison gate. There
were two hundred boys in this home. It seemed strange to live in a
home ruled over by a governor in uniform, policed by gaolers and
superintendents. Strange to have a home one could not leave at
will, where iron discipline turned one out at dawn, drove one like
a slave to long hours of hard and uncongenial work. Strange that
home should breathe bitterness and distrust that it should be under
a code which seemed to repeat eternally:</p>

<p>"Don't forget you are a criminal. Young as yet, but the taint is
in you!"</p>

<p>It was true there were momentary relaxations, football and other
games which he detested, bleak and interminable services in a
chapel, organ recitals and concerts. The other boys disgusted him
with their endless obscenities and suggestions, their universal
conviction that the great thing was to "get through it," so as to
be able to resume those criminal practices inherent in them,
practices which the home did nothing to eradicate or relieve.</p>

<p>If "Old Face" had not been of the toughest fibre, dull witted,
impervious, and in a sense unawakened, those two years would have
broken him. As it was they dulled his sensibilities even more, they
embittered him. Those brown eyes had almost lost that straining
glance of expectancy, as though the home had taught him that there
was nothing for him in any case to expect. He was a criminal,
hall-marked for eternity. When he had been there six months they
sent for him to go and visit the chaplain. That good man looked
very impressive, and announced that the governor had received
information that Caleb's mother was dead, and that it was his
solemn duty to break the news to him. He appeared relieved that the
boy did not at once burst into tears. He then delivered a little
homily on life and death, and pointed out that it was Caleb's evil
and vicious actions which had hastened his mother's death. He
advised him to pour out his heart in penitence to God, who was
always our Rock and Saviour in times of tribulation. He quoted
passages from Leviticus, and Caleb stared at him dully, thinking
the while:</p>

<p>"I'll never see my mother again, never, never."</p>

<p>He did not give way to grief. The news only bewildered him the
more. He went about his duties in the home stolidly. He was quite
an exemplary immate, hardly up to the average standard of quickness
and intelligence, but quiet, obedient, and well behaved. At the end
of his term of service he was sent up before the governor and other
officials. The clumsy scrawl of his signature was demanded upon
innumerable forms. He believed he was once more to be a free man.
And so he was in a qualified sense. But he was not to escape
without the seal of the institution being indelibly stamped upon
him. In round-about phrases the governor explained that he was to
leave the home, but he was not to imagine that he was a free agent
to go about the world murdering whomever he liked. He was still a
criminal, requiring supervision and watching. Out of their
Christian charity the governors had found employment for him at a
timber-merchant's at Bristol. Thither he would go, but he must
remember that he was still under their protection. Every few weeks
he must report to the police. Any act of disobedience on his part
would be treated&mdash;well, by a sterner authority. On the next
occasion he would not be sent to a nice comfortable establishment
like the home, where they played football and had concerts, but to
Wormwood Scrubbs or Dartmoor. Did he understand? Oh, yes, Caleb
understood&mdash;at least, partly. He was to be free, free in a
queer way.</p>

<p>The arrangement did not exactly tally with his sense of freedom,
any more than this building tallied with his idea of home, but he
was only nineteen and his body was strong and his spirit not
completely broken. Any ideas he may have entertained that the new
life was going to spell freedom in any sense were quickly
shattered. The timber merchant at Bristol was a man named Barnet, a
tyrant of the worst description. He knew the kind of material he
was handling. Most of his employees were ex-convicts,
ticket-of-leave-men, Lascars, or social derelicts. He acted
accordingly. Caleb slept in a shed with nine other men, four of
whom were coloured. They worked ten hours a day loading timber on
barges. They were given greasy cocoa and bread at six o'clock in
the morning, a meal of potatoes and little square lumps of hard
meat at twelve, then tea and bread at four o'clock in the
afternoon. In addition to this he was paid twelve shillings a week.
The slightest act of insubordination or slackness was met with the
threat:</p>

<p>"Here, you! Any more of that and you go back to where you came
from!"</p>

<p>Before he had been there a month he felt that the home was
indeed a home in comparison. Strangely enough, it was one of the
coloured men who rescued him from his thraldom, a pleasant voiced
coon with only one eye. He appeared to take a fancy to Caleb. One
night he came to him and whispered:</p>

<p>"Say, boss, would you like to beat it?"</p>

<p>It took some time for the boy from Cravenford to understand the
coloured man's phraseology and plan, but when he did, he fell in
with it with alacrity. The following Saturday they visited a little
public-house down by the docks and were there introduced to a
grizzled mate. Hands were wanted on a merchantman sailing for
Buenos Ayres the following week. The coloured man was a free agent
and he signed on, and Caleb signed on in the name of J. Bullock.
Two nights before sailing he hid in a barge and joined his ship the
following morning. All day long he experienced the tremors of dread
for the first time in his life. The primitive instinct of escape
and the call of the sea was upon him. He could have danced with joy
when he heard the rattling of the chains, and the hoarse cries of
the deck hands as the big ship got under way at dusk.</p>

<p>The voyage to Buenos Ayres was uneventful. The work was hard and
the discipline severe, but he was conscious all the time of sensing
the first draught of freedom that he had experienced since he left
his village. This feeling was accentuated at port when he realised
that after being paid off, he was free to leave the ship. But the
rigid magnificence of Buenos Ayres depressed him. He learnt that
after unloading they were to refit and convey cattle to Durban in
South Africa, so he signed on again for the next voyage. This
proved to be a formidable experience. A week out they ran into very
heavy seas. He was detailed to attend the cattle. The cattle
superintendent was a drunken bully. The stench among the cattle
pens, added to the violent heaving of the ship, brought on
sickness, but he was not allowed any respite. The cattle themselves
were seasick, and many of them died and had to be thrown overboard.
The voyage lasted three weeks, and when he arrived at Durban he
determined to try his luck once more as a landsman. At that time
there was plenty of demand for unskilled labour for men of Caleb's
physique in South Africa, but it was poorly paid. He drifted about
the country doing odd jobs. He visited Cape Town, Kimberly and
Pietermaritzburg. The fever of <i>wanderlust</i> was upon him. He
never remained in one situation for more than a few months. He was
the man who desired to see over the ridge. Perhaps further, just a
little further, would be&mdash;he knew what not, some answer to the
inexpressible yearning within him, deep calling unto deep. At the
age of twenty-two he was working on the railroad near Nyanza. They
came and told him about the great war, which had just started in
Europe. A keen-faced little man, one of the gangers, tapped him on
the shoulder, and said:</p>

<p>"It's lucky for you lad you're out here. Otherwise they'd be
telling you that 'your king and country need you.'"</p>

<p>The phrase disturbed him. Night after night he lay awake
dreaming of England. Memories of the home and of the
timber-merchant at Bristol vanished. He thought only of Cravenford,
the grey ivy-coloured church, the rambling high street, the pond by
Mr. Larry's farm, the crossroads where he and another boy named
Stoddard had fought one April afternoon, his mother's cottage, now,
alas! deserted, but always sacred, old Sam Hurds banging away in
the smithy, the rooks circling above the great elms in the
park&mdash;all, all these things were perhaps in danger whilst he
lay sulking in a foreign land. They had called him "Face." Well,
why not? He knew he was not particularly prepossessing. The fellow
workmen had always been at great pains to point this out to him.
But still&mdash;stolidly and indifferently he went about his work,
and then one day in the old manner he vanished...</p>

<p>We will not attempt to record Caleb's experiences of the war. He
had no difficulty in joining a volunteer unit in Capetown, which
was drafted to England. There he asked to be transferred to one of
his own county regiments. The request was overlooked in the clamour
of those days. He found himself with a cockney infantry regiment,
and he remained with it through the whole course of the war. His
life was identical to that of his many million comrades. In some
respects he seemed to enjoy lapses of greater freedom than he had
experienced for a long time. He was better fed, better clothed,
better looked after. He had money in his pocket which he knew not
what to do with. He made a good soldier, doing unquestioningly what
he was told, sticking grimly to his post, being completely
indifferent to danger.</p>

<p>Save for a few months on the Italian front, he served the whole
time in France. He was slightly wounded three times, and in 1917
was awarded a military cross for an astounding feat of bravery in
bombing a German dug-out and killing five of the enemy
single-handed in the dark. Those queer spiritual strivings so deep
down in his nature derived no satisfaction from the war. It was all
quite meaningless and incomprehensible. When he left South Africa
he had an idea that the fighting would be in England. He visualised
grim battles in the fields beyond Cravenford, and he and the other
boys from the school defending their village. He had never
conceived that a war could be like this. Sometimes he would lie
awake at night and ruminate vaguely upon the queer perversity of
fate which suddenly made murder popular. He had been turned out of
England because he had quite inadvertently killed his father for
kicking his mother across the shins, and now he was praised for
killing five men within a few minutes. He didn't know, of course,
but perhaps some of those men&mdash;particularly that elderly plump
man who coughed absurdly as he ran on to Caleb's
bayonet&mdash;perhaps they were better men than his father,
although foreigners, although enemy. It was very perplexing...</p>

<p>After a grey eternity of time, the thing came to an end. He
found himself back in England. During the war much had been
forgotten and forgiven. No one asked him for his credentials. The
police never interfered with him. With his three wound stripes, his
military cross, and his papers all in order, he was for a time a
<i>persona grata</i>.</p>

<p>He had a bonus beyond the pay which he had saved, and he had
never been so wealthy in his life. He stayed in London, and tried
to adapt himself to a life of luxury and freedom, but he was not
happy. In restaurants he was self-conscious, in theatres bored, in
the streets bewildered. And so one day he set out and returned to
his native village. Strangely, little had it altered! There was the
church, the smithy, and the old street all just the same. He called
on the smith, who was startled at the sight of him, but on
perceiving his strips and ribbons, reasonably polite. He ransacked
the village for old friends. Alas! How many of his school
associates had gone, never to return. He called on Mr. Green, the
miller, Mrs. Allport, at the general shop, Bob Canning, the
carrier. Oh, dear me! yes, they all remembered him, were quite
courteous, glad he had done well at the war, got through safely.
Well, well! And soon the story got round. "Old Face has returned.
Old Face! The boy who murdered his father!"</p>

<p>The novelty of his re-appearance and return soon wore off, and
he knew that he was held in distrust in the village. He wandered
far afield, and eventually obtained employment at a brickworks at
Keeble, four miles down the valley toward Blaizing-Killstoke. Here
the rumours concerning him gradually percolated, but they carried
little weight or significance. He was a good workman, and time
subdues all things.</p>

<p>Then the strangest miracle happened to Caleb Fryatt. He was
nearly thirty, hard-bitten, battered, ill-mannered, with a scar
from a bullet on his left cheek, little money, no prospects and no
ambition&mdash;an unattractive chunk of a man. But what should we
all do if love itself were not the greatest miracle of all? Anne
Tillie was by no means a beauty herself, but she was not without
attraction. She had a round, bright red ingenuous face, a heavily
built figure with rather high shoulders and long arms. She was a
year older than Caleb and inclined to be deaf, but there was a
transparent honesty and simplicity about her. One could see that
she would be honest, loyal, and true to all her purposes. She was
the daughter of the postman at Blaizing-Killstoke. She and Caleb
used to meet in the evenings and wander the lanes together. They
did not appear to converse very much, but they would occasionally
laugh, and give each other a hearty push. To her father's disgust,
these attentions led to marriage the following year. They went to
live in a tiny cottage on the outskirts of Keeble, ten minutes'
bicycle ride from the works. Anne made an excellent wife. She
seemed to understand and adapt herself to her husband's
idiosyncrasies. She kept the cottage spotlessly clean, tended his
clothes, and kept him in clean linen, cooked well, and studied all
his little wants and peculiarities. She found time to attend to the
garden, grow her own vegetables, and even see after a dozen
fowls.</p>

<p>Caleb had never enjoyed such material comfort. In the evening
they would sit either side of the fire, he with his pipe and she
with her sewing. They were an unusually silent couple. Apart from
her deafness, they never seemed prompted to exchange more than
cursory remarks about the weather, their food, or some matter of
local gossip. In the summer they sat in the garden, and watching
the blue smoke from his pipe curl away into the amber light of the
setting sun, Caleb felt that he had reached a haven after a
restless storm. He worked remorselessly hard at the brickworks, and
in two years' time was made a kiln foreman, receiving good wages.
Malevolent people still whispered the story concerning the boy who
murdered his father, and pointed an accusing finger at the back of
his bulky form, but no one dared to remind Anne of that tragic
happening. She knew the full details of it quite well, and woe to
any unfortunate individual who dared to suggest that her man was in
the wrong! In course of time he built a barn, and a toolshed, and
they bought an adjoining orchard. They kept pigs, and then a pony
and trap, and on Thursdays Anne would drive to market, and sell
eggs, and chickens and apples. Oh, yes, they were becoming a
prosperous pair. Caleb had surely outlived the ugly vicissitudes of
his face. Was he happy? Was he completely satisfied? Who shall say?
The promptings from the soul come from some deep root no one has
fathomed. He was conscious of a greater peace than he had ever
known. He sometimes hummed quite unrecognisable tunes as he went
about his work. The mornings enchanted him with gossamer webs
gleaming with dew, swinging between the flowers. But the eyes still
sometimes appeared to be seeking&mdash;one knows not what.</p>

<p>They had been married five years and seven months when the child
was born. It came as a great surprise to Caleb. He had hardly dared
to visualise such an eventuality. What a to-do there was in the
cottage! Another room to be prepared, strange garments suddenly
appearing upon the line in the kitchen, a visiting nurse somewhat
important and discursive.</p>

<hr>

<p>"A boy! Ho!" thought Caleb, as he trundled along on his bicycle
the following morning. A boy who would grow up and perhaps become
like himself. Well, that was very strange, very remarkable. Most
remarkable that such a possibility had never occurred to him. All
day long, and for nights and weeks after he thought about the boy
who was going one day to be a man like himself. The thought at
first worried and perplexed him. Was he&mdash;had he been&mdash;the
kind of man the world would want perpetuated? He felt the fierce
censure and distrust mankind had always lavished upon himself
beginning to focus upon the boy, and gradually the protective sense
developed in him to a desperate degree. The boy should have better
chances than he ever had, the boy should be protected, cared for,
shown the way of things...Caleb ruminated. His wife became very
dear to him. He was a man on the threshold of revelation. But
before his eyes had fully opened to the complete realisation of all
that this meant to him, a wayward gust of fever shattered the
spectrum. The little fellow died when barely four months old. For a
time Caleb was most deeply concerned for the health of his wife,
who was a victim of the same scourge, but, as she gradually
recovered, a feeling of unendurable melancholy crept over him. He
began to observe the grey perspective of his life, its past and
future. When Anne was once more normal, their intercourse became
more taciturn than ever. There fell between them long, empty
silences. There were times when he regarded her with boredom,
almost with aversion. The years would roll on...wander-spirit would
assail him. He would be tempted to pick up his cap and go forth and
seek some port, where a ship under ballast might be preparing to
essay the vast insecurity of heaving waters. But something told him
that that would be cruel. His wife's love for him was the most
moving experience of his life, far greater than his love for her.
She was middle-aged now, and her deafness was more pronounced than
ever.</p>

<p>Once she went away to stay with her father for a few days. The
morning after she left, a wall in the brickyard collapsed and
crushed his right foot. He was carried home in excruciating pain. A
neighbour came in and attended him and they fetched the doctor.
They wanted to send for his wife but he told them not to bother
her. All night he was delirious, and for the next two days and
nights he went through a period of torment. As the fever abated a
deep feeling of depression crept over him. He began to yearn for
his wife profoundly. The neighbour, an elderly woman, wife of the
local corn-chandler, was kindness itself. But everything she did
was just wrong. How could she know the way Caleb liked things, and
he lying there silent and uncomplaining?</p>

<p>On the third evening Anne arrived. She had heard the news. She
came bustling into the cottage, dropped her bag, pressed her lips
to his.</p>

<p>"Silly Billy, why didn't you send for me?"</p>

<p>Silly Billy! That was her favourite term of raillery when he had
behaved foolishly.</p>

<p>He choked back a desire to cry with relief.</p>

<p>"It's nothing, nothing to bother about."</p>

<p>But a feeling of deep contentment crept over him. His eyes
regarded her thick plump figure moving busily but quietly about the
room. There would be nothing now to disturb or annoy him.
Everything would be done just&mdash;just as he liked it. She deftly
re-arranged the positions of tables, and cups, and curtains. As the
evening wore on she hovered above him, watching his every little
movement, like a tigress watching over its cub. She eased the
pillow, stroked his hair, and by some adroit manoeuvre relieved the
pressure on his throbbing leg. A deep sense of tranquillity
permeated him. For the first time for three days he felt the desire
to sleep, the cottage seemed so inordinately quiet, secure. Once
when she was stooping near the chair by the bed, he seized her
rough, strong forearm and pulled her to him. He believed he slept
at last with her cheek pressed against his own...</p>

<p>They treated him very well at the brickworks, and his wages were
paid every week during his absence. It was nearly two months before
he could get about again, and the doctors said he must expect to
have a permanent limp. Summer vanished in the October mists, and a
long winter dragged through its course. Spring again. Its pulse a
little feebler than in the old days? Well, well, what could a man
expect? Some of the old desires raised their heads and tugged at
his heart-strings. He was very happy&mdash;off and on a little
soiled, perhaps, by the stress of bitter years, a little more
ordinary, a little more sociable. He sometimes visited "The Green
Man" and would drink beer with Mr. White, the corn-chandler, and
old Tom Smethwick. And after a glass or two he would be quite a
social acquisition, and would be inclined to boast a little of his
deeds in the Great War, and of his adventures in foreign lands. No
harm in it. Not such a bad sort, Old Face, the boy who murdered his
father.</p>

<p>Heigho! But how the years ravage us! 'Twas but a while when
things were so and so, and now...He was forty-four when two
disturbing factors came into his life, threatening to wreck its
calm tenor, and they occurred almost simultaneously. There was a
girl at the brickworks who came from London. She was the manager's
secretary and she worked in his office. Oh, but she was a smart
piece of goods, and the men never tired of discussing her. In the
early twenties, distinctly pretty, with a mass of chestnut hair,
pert manners and a wrist watch. Passing through the yards, she
would sometimes chat with the men at the kilns, and in their dinner
hour she would laugh and joke with them. Their estimate of her was
not always expressed in very refined or flattering language. Old
Ingleton, the time-keeper, swore she had given him the "glad-eye,"
but as one of his own eyes was glass, his confession did not carry
great weight. She had never singled Caleb out for any particular
attention although she was always friendly with him. The cataclysm
came upon him quite suddenly one day in late September. He was
digging a trench by a mound covered with nettles, and a few
sunflowers. He rested on his spade and was enjoying the pleasant
tranquillity of the scene, when the girl came round the corner and
looked at him. She smiled and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"A lovely day, Mr. Fryatt!"</p>

<p>He instinctively touched his hat and said "Ay."</p>

<p>And that was the end of the conversation. But Caleb watched her
walking up the narrow path toward the manager's shanty, and some
restless fever stirred within him. She was unique. He had seen such
women from a distance, smartly apparelled, walking about the
streets of London and Capetown, but he had always looked upon them
as creatures of a different world from his own, and hardly given
them a thought. But here was one smiling at him, speaking to him.
After all, she was not so remote. She was a girl, indeed, a working
girl, quite accessible and friendly. And what a lithesome, dainty
figure! What an appealing pretty face! Those lips! Ugh! A large
worm wriggled free from the side of the little trench, and quite
unreasonably he cut it in half with his spade.</p>

<p>From that moment forward Caleb began to think of Agnes Fareham.
Alas! He began to dream about her also. She was a note of bright
and vivid colour in the drab monotony of his life. He began to lie
in wait for her, to force his clumsy attentions upon her and she
did not seem to resent it unduly. The affair became an obsession.
His faculty for reasoning had never been considerable. In some dim
way he felt that there was the solution of all those buried
yearnings and thwarted desires which had accompanied him through
life. Here was an explanation. He was content to be held by the
experience, without formulating any plan or definite resolution.
Whether the girl would ultimately succumb to his solicitations,
whether she would go away with him, and if so how he was to manage
to keep her; moreover, how he was to face the appalling cruelty of
his own attitude toward Anne&mdash;all these questions he put
behind him. For the moment they appeared immaterial to the blinding
obsession. One day while still in this indeterminate mood he went
home as usual to his midday dinner. As he dismounted his bicycle
and leant it against the garden fence, Anne came out of the cottage
and said:</p>

<p>"Caleb, there's a gentleman to see you."</p>

<p>He went inside and beheld a small keen-faced elderly man, who
nodded to him and said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Caleb Fryatt?"</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>The little man examined him closely.</p>

<p>"I will come straight to the business I have in hand. I am the
head clerk of Rogers, Mason and Freeman, solicitors of
Blaizing-Killstoke. You, I believe, are the only child of Stephen
and Mary Fryatt, late of Cravenford?"</p>

<p>"Ay."</p>

<p>"You may be aware that your father had a brother, named Leonard,
in Nova Scotia?"</p>

<p>"I've heard tell on 'ee."</p>

<p>"Your uncle died last year. He left a little property and no
will. My principals are of opinion that you are the lawful legatee.
They would be obliged if you would pay them a visit so that the
matter may be fully determined. Here is my card."</p>

<p>Caleb stared dully at the piece of pasteboard, but Anne who had
entered the cottage just previously, asked to have the business
explained to her. Caleb shouted in her ear. Then she turned to the
lawyer and said:</p>

<p>"And how much money did his Uncle Leonard leave? Do you know,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Quite without prejudice, and entirely between ourselves, I
believe it is a matter of approximately four thousand pounds."</p>

<p>It took the whole of the afternoon for this news thoroughly to
penetrate the skull of the fortunate legatee. Indeed, it was not
till he had had a pint of beer at "The Green Man" on the way home
that the full significance came home to him. It is to be regretted
that after his supper he returned to "The Green Man," and for the
first time in his life Mr. Caleb Fryatt got drunk. He stood drinks
lavishly and indiscriminately. He told everyone his news. The
amount became a little distorted. It may have been due to the
lawyer's use of the word "approximately." This orgy acted upon him
disastrously. As he reeled up the village street, only one vision
became clear to him. Agnes! He could take her away, buy her a
mansion and smart frocks. He could take her to hotels and theatres
in London. At the same time, he could settle money on Anne. He was
a millionaire. The world belonged to him. With a tremendous effort
he controlled his feet and voice when he reached the cottage, but
he went to bed at once. In the morning he had a headache and Anne
bound his head in damp linen handkerchiefs and brought him tea.</p>

<p>By Monday everyone on the countryside from Cravenford to Billows
Weir knew that "Old Face," the ugly man, known as the boy who
murdered his father, had come in for a huge fortune left by an
uncle in Canada. The first person he met in the brickworks on
Monday was Agnes, who came up to him and held out her hand:</p>

<p>"I believe we are to congratulate you, Mr. Fryatt."</p>

<p>He smiled at her foolishly and held her hand an unnecessarily
long time. There was no doubt she had taken to him. She liked him.
Could he stir her deeper emotion?</p>

<p>The weeks went by in a dream. He visited the lawyers. Everything
was in order. They even offered to advance him money. He could not
visualise the full dimensions of his fortune; neither had he the
power to act upon it. He still went on at the brickworks and the
cottage, listening to Anne's sensible admonitions to invest the
money in small amounts so as to have a nest egg for their old age.
But he could not detach this miracle of wealth from the figure of
Agnes. They had come together. They belonged to each other,
fantastic phenomena jerking him violently out of the deep rut of
his existence. One day he went into the town and bought a gold
locket, set with blue stones. He gave four pounds ten for it. He
waited for Agnes that evening and gave it to her. He had been in an
agony as to whether she would accept it, but to his delight she
received it with gratitude and thanked him bewitchingly. This
seemed to bind her to him indissolubly. A few evenings later he met
her in the lane. There was no one about. Without a word he took her
in his arms and pressed his lips to hers. She gasped and
spluttered:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Fryatt, please...no."</p>

<p>But she wasn't angry. Oh, no, not really angry&mdash;just
provocative, more alluring than ever...They met frequently after
that, in secret disused corners of the brick-field, in the lanes at
night. He bought her more presents, and one Saturday they went
secretly to a fair at Molesham and only returned by the last train.
The men naturally began to get wind of this illicit courtship, but
as far as he knew no rumour had penetrated the deafness of Anne. He
was drifting desperately beyond care in either respect. Two months
of this intensive worship and the madness was upon him. He
said:</p>

<p>"You must come with me. We will run away."</p>

<p>"Where, Caleb?"</p>

<p>"We'll go to London."</p>

<p>"Where should we stay?"</p>

<p>"At swell hotels. We will have a carriage. I will buy frocks and
jewels."</p>

<p>The girl's eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"What about your wife?"</p>

<p>"I'll make it all right. I'll settle some money on her."</p>

<p>But Agnes was not so easily won. Oh dear, no! There were tears
and emotion. You see, she was only a young and innocent girl.
Suppose he deserted her? What assurance had she? This scheming and
plotting went on for weeks. At length they came to an agreement.
Agnes would go to London with him if he would first settle a
thousand pounds upon her. It was very cheap at the price, and a
fair and reasonable bargain. One Saturday they journeyed together
to his lawyers at Blaizing-Killstoke. The deed was drawn up, and
they both signed various papers. The elopement was fixed for the
following Saturday. All the week Caleb walked like a man
unconscious of his surroundings. The purposes of his life were to
be fulfilled. True, he had odd moments of misgivings. He dared not
think about Anne. Also at times he had gloomy forebodings
concerning London hotels, how to behave, whether the people would
laugh at him, what clothes to wear, whether Agnes would quickly
sicken of him. But still he had pledged himself. He jingled the
money in his pocket...His destiny.</p>

<p>Friday was a disastrous day. It was cold and damp, and to his
disgust he awoke with a severe twinge of rheumatism in his left
shoulder. It made him irritable and nervous all day. Agnes was very
preoccupied. He had advanced her some money to buy frocks, and she
went backward and forward to her lodgings with large cardboard
boxes. He had selected the morrow, because Anne was going away to
spend a few days with her father. In the afternoon his rheumatism
became worse, and he became aware of the symptoms of a feverish
chill. He left off work at his usual time and cycled home. The
cottage was all in darkness. He lighted the lamp. Anne had left his
supper ready for him on the tray. The little room looked neat and
tidy. She had also left a note for him. He picked it up carelessly
and held it under the lamp. This is what he read:</p>

<p class="letter">
</p>

<p>Caleb dear, I hear that you have made some money over to Agnes
Fareham and that you are wishful to go away with her. My dear! I do
not want to interfere with your happiness. I thowt I had been a
good wife to you but you know best. I am goin to my father and I
shall not come back. Please God you may be happy.<br>
<br>
Your broking hearted wife,<br>
Anne.<br>
<br></p>

<p>Bless you dear for all you have been to me and the happiness you
have give me.</p>

<p>And Caleb buried his face in his hands. Without touching his
supper he carried the lamp into the bedroom and went to bed. Curse
it! How his teeth were chattering! He would have liked a little
brandy, but there was none in the cottage, and there was no one to
go and fetch it. He wrapped himself up and rolled over, the
interminable night began. What a weak fool he was! All the
experiences and temptations of his life crowded upon him and
tortured him. Idle dreams! Idle dreams! His shoulder ached
insufferably. If Anne were here, she would rub it with that yellow
oil. He could not rub his own shoulder and back. Then she would
wrap it up in a thick shawl and say:</p>

<p>"Silly Billy, you must be careful of the damp."</p>

<p>He could visualise her moving about the room, arranging the
curtain so that there was no draught, stirring something in a cup,
giving those little dexterous pokes to the bed clothes which meant
so much, sitting placidly by the window, his coarse woollen socks
in her hand. She loved darning his socks...doing things for him,
even all the unpleasant, ugly things of domestic life.</p>

<p>He ought to have some soup or gruel or something, but he could
not be bothered to make it. He turned out the lamp. And all night
long Caleb turned and fretted, and strangely enough he gave little
thought to Agnes. She was now becoming the unreality, the vain
fancy, a feather drifting on the ocean. She was nothing to him. She
had no part in that deep consciousness, amongst whose folds he had
sought so desperately to find inner relief. What was it? Where was
it? Toward dawn he slept fitfully, struggling to keep awake on
account of the disturbing dreams that crowded upon him. When things
at last became visible the first thing he was aware of was an old
shawl of his wife's on a nail by the door, and cap which she wore
to do the housework in. The things became to him an emblem of the
love she bore him, and truth came to him with the rising of the
sun. Love&mdash;the deep secret her hand had sought; the love that
struggles to endure through any conditions, the love that as far as
human nature is concerned is permanent and indestructible. He
observed its action upon his own career. His mother's love for his
father, a love which he had so tragically misinterpreted. Later his
love for his country, which had crept upon him across the years and
whispered to him across the endless waste of waters. And lastly the
love that existed between his wife and himself, a love that was so
near and familiar to him that he could not always see it. He sighed
and the dreams no longer worried him. It must have been some hours
later that he awoke and made himself some tea. He was still shaky,
and his shoulder hurt, so he went back to bed.</p>

<p>In the middle of the morning he heard the latch of the front
door click, and his heart beat rapidly.</p>

<p>"She has come back," he thought. He heard some one moving in the
passage, his door opened, and on the threshold of the room
stood&mdash;Agnes! It was queer that on observing her his first
thought was with regard to his teeth. During the war he had lost
three front teeth. A loving government had presented him with a
plate and three false teeth which he always wore in daytime, but
which at night, on Anne's advice, he always kept in a glass of
water by the side of the bed. He stretched out his hand for the
teeth, and then he felt that he would be ridiculous putting the
plate in, so he left the matter alone. She advanced into the room,
and neither of them spoke. It is difficult to know precisely what
attitude Agnes had resolved to take, but the appearance and
atmosphere of that room may have altered or modified it. She merely
grinned rather uncomfortably at Caleb. He could not have been an
attractive sight. He had slept badly, and he had not washed or
shaved. He was wearing a coarse woollen nightgown, and his three
front teeth were missing. Perhaps it occurred to her abruptly that
in the round of life one has to take the unshorn early morning with
the gaily bedecked evening, and she was already wondering whether
the combination was worth while. In any case she merely said:</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>And Caleb replied, "Hullo!"</p>

<p>They both looked a little ashamed then, and Agnes glanced out of
the window as though dreading some one's approach. As he did not
speak further, she turned and said:</p>

<p>"You're not coming then?"</p>

<p>He turned his face to the wall and answered "No."</p>

<p>There was a definite expression of relief on the girl's face.
She was very smartly dressed in a tailormade coat and skirt. She
edged toward the door. Then she said in a mildly querulous
voice:</p>

<p>"I knew you'd back out of it."</p>

<p>Caleb sat up and exclaimed feelingly:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Agnes."</p>

<p>This seemed to quite appease her, and she said:</p>

<p>"Anything you want, Caleb, before I go?"</p>

<p>The man stared thoughtfully at the ceiling before replying:</p>

<p>"Yes; wait a minute, Agnes."</p>

<p>He took a pencil and a sheet of paper, and wrote out a telegram
addressed to his wife:</p>

<p>"Come back, dear, I want you."</p>

<p>The girl took up the telegram and read it through thoughtfully.
Then she once more edged toward the door. She fumbled with the
latch. Suddenly she turned and said:</p>

<p>"That'll be elevenpence."</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"That'll be elevenpence&mdash;for the telegram."</p>

<p>He fumbled with his trousers on the chair by the side of the bed
and produced a shilling.</p>

<p>"There, lass, I haven't any change. Don't bother about the
penny."</p>

<p>She took the shilling and went back to the door.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Caleb."</p>

<p>"Good-bye."</p>

<p>When she had gone he thought it was rather queer of her to ask
for the shilling. He had already given her a thousand pounds, and
many frocks and presents. She might in any case have offered to
give him the penny change. However, he soon forgot her in the fever
of anxiety he was in as to the return of his wife. All day long no
one came near the cottage. The day was wet, and a thick white mist
drifted with the rain. He could not trouble to light the fire. He
ate some bread and cheese at midday, and vainly tried to rub his
shoulder with the oil. Soon after five it began to be dark again.
He was in a terror of remorse and fear. Had he destroyed the lamp
of his happiness? He buried his face in the pillow and groaned: "I
didn't understand! I didn't understand!"</p>

<p>He began to feel so weak; he was losing sense of time. He
awakened once with a start. The room seemed suddenly filled with an
enveloping comfort. He held out his arms. He felt those wet cheeks
pressed close to his. That voice so dear and familiar to him was
whispering in his ear:</p>

<p>"Silly Billy, I knew ye would send for me."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>29. BURNEY'S LAUGH</h2>

<p>After breakfast was a good time. Throughout the day there was no
moment when his vitality rose to such heights as it did during the
first puffs of that early cigar. He would stroll out then into the
conservatory, and the bright colour of the azaleas would produce in
him a strange excitement. His senses would seem sharpened, and he
would move quickly between the flowers, and would discuss minor
details of their culture with Benyon the gardener. Then he would
stroll through the great spaces of his reception-rooms with his
head bent forward. The huge Ming pot on its ebony stand would seem
to him companionable and splendid, the Majolica plaques which he
had bought at Padua would glow serenely. He would go up and feast
his eyes on the Chinese lacquer cabinet on its finely-wrought gilt
base; and his lips would quiver with a tense enjoyment as he
lingered by the little carved Japanese ivories in the recess. Above
all, he liked to stand near the wall and gaze at the Vandyke above
the fireplace. It looked well in the early morning light, dignified
and impressive.</p>

<p>All these things were his. He had fought for them in the arena
of the commercial world. He had bought them in the teeth of
opposition. And they expressed <i>him</i>, his sense of taste, his
courage, his power, his relentless tenacity, the qualities that had
raised him above his fellows to the position he held. The
contemplation of them produced in him a curious vibrant
exhilaration. Especially was this so in the early morning when he
rose from the breakfast table and lighted his first cigar.</p>

<p>The great hall, too, satisfied his quivering senses. The walnut
panelling shone serenely, and brass and pewter bore evidence that
the silent staff whom his housekeeper controlled had done their
work efficiently. It was early&mdash;barely nine o'clock&mdash;but
he knew that in the library Crevace and Dilgerson, his private
secretaries, would be fidgeting with papers and expecting him. He
would keep them waiting another ten minutes while he gratified this
clamorous proprietary sense. He would linger in the drawing-room,
with its long, grey panels and splendid damask hangings, and touch
caressingly the little groups of statuary. The unpolished satinwood
furniture appealed to some special aesthetic appetite. It was an
idea of his own. It seemed at once graceful and distinguished.</p>

<p>He seemed to have so little time during the rest of the day to
feel these things. And if he had the time, the satisfaction did not
seem the same, for this was the hour when he felt most virile.</p>

<p>In the library the exultation that he had derived from these
aesthetic pleasures would gradually diminish. It is true that
Dilgerson had prepared the rough draft of his amendment to the new
Peasant Allotment Bill, and it was an amendment he was intensely
interested in, for if it passed it might lead to the overthrow of
Chattisworth, and that would be a very desirable thing, but
nevertheless his interests would flag.</p>

<p>He had a fleeting vision of a great triumph in the House, and
himself the central figure. He settled down to discuss the details
with Dilgerson. Dilgerson was a very remarkable person. He had a
genius for putting his finger on the vital spot of a bill, and he
had moreover an unfathomable memory. But gradually the discussion
of involved financial details with Dilgerson would tire him. He
would get restless and say, "Yes, yes. All right, Dilgerson. Put it
your own way."</p>

<p>He turned aside to the table where Crevace, coughing nervously,
was preparing some sixty odd letters for him to sign. A charming
young man, Crevace, with gentle manners and a great fund of
concentration. He was the second son of Emma Countess of Waddes. He
had not the great abilities of Dilgerson, but he was conscientious,
untiring, and infinitely ornamental.</p>

<p>He discussed the letters and a few social matters with Crevace,
while Dilgerson prepared the despatch-case for the Cabinet meeting
at twelve o'clock.</p>

<p>At half-past eleven a maid entered and brought him a raw egg
beaten up with a little neat brandy, in accordance with custom.</p>

<p>He told her that Hervieu, the chauffeur, need not come for him.
He would walk over to Downing Street with Mr. Dilgerson. As a
matter of fact, there were still one or two points upon which he
was not quite clear about the rights of rural committees. Dilgerson
had made a special study of these questions. It was a great
temptation to rely more and more on Dilgerson.</p>

<p>He enjoyed a Cabinet meeting. He felt more at home there than in
the House. He liked the mixture of formality and urbanity with
which the most important affairs were discussed. He liked to sit
there and watch the faces of his fellow-ministers. They were
clever, hard-headed men, men who like himself had climbed, and
climbed, and climbed. They shared in common certain broad political
principles, but he did not know what was at the back of any one of
their minds. It amused him to listen to Brodray elaborating his
theories about the Peasant Allotment Bill, and enunciating
commendable altruistic principles. He knew Brodray well. He was a
good fellow, but he did not really believe what he was saying. He
had another axe to grind, and he was using the Peasant Allotment
Bill as a medium. The divagations of "procedure" were absorbing. It
was on the broad back of "procedure," that the interests of all
were struggling to find a place. It was the old parliamentary hand
who stood the best chance of finding a corner for his wares. The
man who knew the ropes. He, too, had certain ambitions...</p>

<p>It seemed strange to look back on. He had been in political
affairs longer than he dare contemplate. Two distinct decades. He
had seen much happen. He had seen youth and ambition ground to
powder in the parliamentary machine. He had seen careers cut short
by death or violent social scandal. Some men were very foolish,
foolish and lacking in&mdash;moral fibre, that must be it. Moral
fibre! the strength not to overstep the bounds, to keep passion and
prejudice in restraint, like hounds upon a leash, until their veins
become dried and atrophied, and they lack the desire to race before
the wind...</p>

<p><i>He</i> had done that. And now he sat there in the sombre room
among the rustling papers, and the greatest Minister of them all
was speaking to him, asking his opinion, and listening attentively
to his answers. He forced himself to a tense concentration on the
issue. He spoke quietly but well. He remembered all the points that
the excellent Dilgerson had coached him in. He was conscious of the
room listening to him attentively. He knew they held the opinion
that he was&mdash;safe, that he would do the best thing in the
interest of the Party.</p>

<p>O'Bayne spoke after that, floridly, with wild dashes of Celtic
fun, and they listened to him, and were amused but not impressed.
O'Bayne, too, had an axe to grind, but he showed his hand too
consciously. He did not know the ropes.</p>

<p>As the meeting broke up, Brodray came up to him and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way, you know I'm dining with you to-night. May I
bring my young nephew with me? He's a sub, in town for a few days'
leave."</p>

<p>Of course he smiled and said it would be delightful. What else
could he say?</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he would rather not have had the young sub.
He had arranged a small bachelors' dinner&mdash;just eight of
them&mdash;and he flattered himself he had arranged it rather
skilfully. There was to be Brodray, and Nielson, the director of
the biggest agricultural instrument works in the country, Lanyon
the K.C., Lord Bowel of the Board of Trade, Tippins, a big
landowner from the North, Sir Andrew Griggs, the greatest living
authority on the Land Laws (he had also written a book on
"artificial manures"), and Sir Gregory Caste, director of the
Museum of Applied Arts.</p>

<p>The latter, he felt, would be perhaps a little out of it with
the rest, but he would help to emphasize his own aspect of social
life, its irreproachable taste and patronage of the arts. It would
be a very eclectic dinner-party, and one in which the fusion of the
agricultural interests might tend to produce certain opinions and
information of use in conducting the Peasant Allotment Bill, and a
young red-faced sub dumped into the middle of it would be neither
appropriate nor desirable. There was, however, nothing to be done.
He and Brodray had always been great friends&mdash;that is to say,
they had always worked hand in hand.</p>

<p>He rested in the afternoon, for as the years advanced he found
this more and more essential. There were the strictest instructions
left that under no circumstances was he to be disturbed till
half-past four. In the meanwhile the egregious Dilgerson would cope
with his affairs.</p>

<p>At half-past four he rose and bathed his face, and after
drinking one cup of tea he rejoined his secretaries in the library.
In his absence many matters had developed. There was a further
accumulation of correspondence, and a neat typewritten list of
telephone messages and applications for appointments. But there was
no flurry about Dilgerson; everything was in order, and the papers
arranged with methodical precision.</p>

<p>He lighted his second cigar of the day and sat down. The
graceful head of Crevace was inclined over the papers, and the
suave voice of Dilgerson was saying:</p>

<p>"I see, sir, that Chattisworth has been speaking up in
Gaysfield. Our agent has written, he thinks it might be advisable
for you to go up North and explain our attitude towards the Bill to
your constituents. They must not be&mdash;er&mdash;neglected for
long in these restless times."</p>

<p>Yes, there was something satisfying in this. The sense of power,
or rather the sense of being within the power focus, the person who
understood, who knew what power meant, and yet was great enough to
live outside it. Strange why to-day he should be so introspective,
why things should appear so abstract! He had a curious feeling as
though everything was slipping away, or as though he were seeing
himself and his setting from a distance.</p>

<p>He gazed at Dilgerson with his square chin, and his neat
moustache, deftly stowing papers into a file whilst he spoke. He
momentarily envied Dilgerson with his singular grip on life. He was
so intense, so sure...</p>

<p>"Yes...yes," he said after a time, "we'd better go up there,
Dilgerson. As you say, they get restless. You might draft me a
rough summary of Chattisworth's points. Let me know what you would
suggest&mdash;precedents, historical parallels and so on. It is
true; they so soon get restless."</p>

<p>A feeling of apathy came to him after a time, and he left his
secretaries and strolled out into the Mall. A fine rain was
drifting from the south, and the tops of the winter trees seemed
like a band of gauze veiling the buildings of Whitehall. He went
into St. James's Park and watched the pale lights from the
Government Buildings. Some soldiers passed him, and a policeman
touched his hat.</p>

<p>Usually these things moved him with a strange delight. They were
the instruments of power, the symbols of the world he believed in.
But to-night the vision of them only filled him with an
unaccountable melancholy.</p>

<p>He suddenly remembered a day when he had strolled here with his
wife twenty-five years ago...</p>

<p>He passed his hand across his brow and tried to brush back a
certain memory. But it would not be denied. It was a grey day like
this. She had made some remark, something sentimental
and&mdash;entirely meretricious. He remembered vividly that he had
chided her at the time. One must not think like that; one must
restrain and control these emotional impulses. They are retrograde,
destroying. He had succeeded, risen to the position he held,
because&mdash;he had always been master of himself.</p>

<p>After his wife's death it had been easier to do this. His two
daughters had married well, one to the Bishop of St. Lubin, and the
other to Viscount Chesslebeach, a venerable but well-informed
gentleman, who had been loyal to the Party. His son was now in
India, holding a position of considerable responsibility. He was
free, free to live and struggle for his great ambitions. He was
fortunate in that respect; in fact, he had always been
fortunate.</p>

<p>He made his way back across the muddy pathway of the Mall,
imbued with a sudden uncontrollable desire for light and
warmth.</p>

<p>Gales met him in the hall and relieved him of his coat. There
was an undeniable sense of comfort and security about Gales. He
glanced furtively at the ponderous figure of his head "man," who
had been with him now longer than he could remember. He muttered
something about the inclemency of the weather, and it soothed him
to note the ingratiating acquiescence of the servant, as though by
addressing him he had conferred a great benefit upon him. He heard
the heavy breathing of Gales as he bustled away with his hat and
coat, and then he warmed his hands by the fire, and strolled
upstairs to dress.</p>

<p>As he entered his bedroom an indefinable feeling of dreariness
came over him again. It was very silent there, and the
well-modulated lights above the dressing-table revealed his
gleaming silver brushes and the solid properties of the mahogany
bed. He looked at the fire and lighted a cigarette, a very unusual
habit for him. Then he went into his dressing-room and noted his
clothes all neatly laid out for him, and the brass can of hot-water
wrapped in the folds of a rough towel. The door half-open revealed
the silver rails and taps in the bathroom, and a very low hum of
sound suggested a distant power station or the well-oiled machinery
of a lift. It was all wonderfully ordered, wonderfully
co-ordinated.</p>

<p>He strolled from one room to the other on the thick pile carpet,
trying to thrust back the waves of dejection that threatened to
envelop him.</p>

<p>At last he threw his cigarette away, and, disrobing himself, he
washed and dressed.</p>

<p>He felt better then, a little more alert and interested. He
turned down the light and went downstairs. He felt suddenly
curiously nervous and apprehensive about the dinner-party. He went
into the dining-room and found Gales instructing a new butler in
the subtleties of his profession. The table was laid for nine, and
indeed looked worthy of Gales and of himself. There was a certain
austerity and distinction about the three bowls of red tulips that
were placed at intervals along it, and the old silver and the
Nuremberg glasses, and the cunning arrangements of concealed lights
emphasised his own sure taste and discrimination. Nevertheless, he
felt nervous. He fussed about the table, and took the
champagne-bottles from their ice beds to satisfy himself that Gales
had brought up the right year. He fidgeted with one of the
typewritten menu-cards, and told Gales that on a previous occasion
Fouchet had overdone the Lucca oil in the Hollandaise. He must
speak to him. He was not sure that Fouchet was not going off. His
eyesight was failing, or he was becoming careless. The straw
potatoes served with the pheasant had been cut too thick, and his
savouries were apt to be too dry. Gales listened to these
criticisms with a lugubrious sympathy, and, bowing, he left the
room to convey them to the <i>chef</i>.</p>

<p>After that he retired to the small Japanese room on the ground
floor. When he had a bachelor party he preferred to receive his
guests there. There was something about the black walls, and the
grotesquely carved fireplace, and the heavily timbered ceiling,
also carved and painted dark red, that appealed to his sense of
appropriateness in a men's dinner-party. It was essentially a man's
room, a little foreboding and bizarre. It symbolised also his
appreciation of a race who were above all things clever; clever and
patient, industrious, aesthetic, with some quality that excited the
mystic tendencies of the cultivated Westerner.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait before two of his guests
arrived&mdash;Sir Gregory Caste and Lanyon the K.C. They had met in
the cloak-room, and, having previously made each other's
acquaintance at an hotel at Baden-Baden, were discussing the
medical values of rival Bavarian springs. It was a subject on which
he himself was no mean authority. The conversation had not
progressed far before Lord Bowel was shown in. He was a very big
man with a heavy dome of a head, large pathetic eyes and a thick
grey beard. He shook hands solemnly without any gleam of welcome,
and immediately gave an account of an incurable disease from which
his sister was suffering.</p>

<p>Tippins then arrived, a square-headed Northcountryman, who did
not speak all the evening except in self-defence, and he was
followed by Sir Andrew Griggs and Nielson. Sir Andrew was well into
the eighties, and Nielson was a thin, keen-faced man with very
thick glasses. There was a considerable interval before Brodray
arrived with his nephew. They were at least ten minutes late, and
Brodray was very profuse with apologies.</p>

<p>It was curious that the young man was almost precisely as he had
pictured him. He was just a red-faced boy in khaki. He fancied that
Brodray introduced him as "Lieutenant Burney," but he was not sure.
It was in any case some such name, something ordinary and
insignificant.</p>

<p>They then all adjourned to the dining-room without breaking the
general level of their conversation, and sat down.</p>

<p>On his right he had Lord Bowel, and on his left Sir Andrew
Griggs. Brodray faced him with Sir Gregory Caste on his right and
his nephew on the left. Lanyon sat next to the lieutenant, and
Nielson and Tuppins occupied the intervening spaces. He had thought
this arrangement out with considerable care.</p>

<p>It was not until the sherry and caviare had fulfilled their
destiny that Lord Bowel managed to complete the full description of
his sister's disease. He spoke very slowly and laboriously, and
moved his beard with a curious rotary movement as he masticated his
food.</p>

<p>Sir Andrew Griggs then managed to break into the conversation
with a dissertation on the horrors of being ill in a foreign hotel.
He had once been suddenly seized with a serious internal trouble,
and had had to undergo an operation in an hotel in Zermatt. It was
very trying, and the hotel people were very unreasonable.</p>

<p>Brodray sang the praises of a new American osteopath during the
removal of the soup plates, and the salmon found the director of
the National Museum of Applied Arts dilating upon the virtues of
grape-fruit as a breakfast food.</p>

<p>The host was in no hurry. He knew that the course of events
would be bound to draw the conversation into channels connected
with matters that were of moment to the construction of the Peasant
Allotment Bill.</p>

<p>What more natural than that the virtues of grape-fruit should
lead to the virtues of fresh air and exercise, and then obviously
to horse-flesh. At the first glass of champagne, the company were
already in the country. Horses and dogs! Ah! how difficult to
eliminate them from the conversation of a party of representative
Englishmen!</p>

<p>Lord Bowel was the first to express his views upon the Bill. The
conversation led to it quite naturally at the arrival of the
pheasant. They were better cooked to-night, and the potatoes were
thinner, more refined.</p>

<p>He watched the curious movement of Lord Bowel's beard as he bit
the pheasant, and said in his sepulchral voice:</p>

<p>"The Groynes amendment will in my opinion inflict a grave
injustice on the agricultural classes. You may remember that in
Gangway's Rural Housings Bill in eighteen ninety-five, Lord
Pennefy, who was then on the Treasury Bench, said..."</p>

<p>The ball had started. He had a curious feeling that he wished
Dilgerson were there. Dilgerson had such a remarkable memory. He
particularly wanted to get Lanyon's views. Lanyon had a great
reputation among the people who knew. Unfortunately he was not a
good Party man. They said of him that he had a mind like a
double-edged sword. He was keen, analytical, and recondite; and he
did not mind whom he struck. The lawyer was listening to Lord Bowel
intently. His skin was dry and cracked into a thousand little
crevices, his cheek-bones stood out, and his cold, abstract eyes
were gazing through his rimless pince-nez at his empty glass. For
he did not drink.</p>

<p>Lord Bowel dwelt at great length on the Bill's unfortunate
attitude towards the agricultural labourer, and at even greater
length on the probable result of that attitude upon the
agricultural labourer at the polls. When he mentioned the Party he
sank his voice to a lower key, and spoke almost humanly.</p>

<p>The pheasants had disappeared, and little quails in aspic had
quivered tremulously in the centre of large plates surrounded by a
vegetable salad, the secret of which he himself had discovered when
living in Vienna, before Lanyon entered the arena with a cryptic
utterance, quoting from an Act of James II. He spoke harshly and
incisively, like a judge arraigning a criminal. It was very
interesting, for the host became aware that as Lanyon proceeded he
was not speaking from conviction. He had heard that Lanyon had
ambitions of a certain legal position. The Bill would not affect it
one way or the other, but his reputation as a dialectician must be
established beyond question. He had his game to play, too.</p>

<p>Nielson broke in and seemed to the host to agree with Lord Bowel
in an almost extravagant manner. He, too, spoke feelingly when the
Party was the theme. It was said that Lord Bowel was the power
behind the Chief. He certainly exerted a great influence in the
selection of office-holders. Men whose political reputation was not
made invariably agreed with Lord Bowel, in any case before his
face.</p>

<p>The game pursued its normal course, the even tenor of the men's
voices sounded one long drone of abstract passionless sound. Under
the influence of the good wine, and the solemn procession of
cunningly arranged foods, they sank into a detached unity of
expression. They looked at each other tolerantly, listening for
signs and omens, and measuring the value of each other's remarks.
There was no enthusiasm, no passion, nothing to belie the suave and
cultivated accents of their voices. They seemed perhaps unreal to
each other, merely a segregation of ideas meeting in a mirage,
without prejudice, or bias, or any great desire for personal
expression.</p>

<p>It was as the savoury was being removed that young Burney
laughed. The host did not catch what it was that made him laugh,
neither did he ever know. It was probably some mildly humorous
remark of Tippins. But it came crashing through the room like the
reel of pipes in a desert. It was not a boisterously loud laugh,
but it was loud enough to rise above the general din. It was the
quality of it that seemed to rend the air like an electric thrill.
It was clear, mellow, vibrant, and amazingly free. It rang out with
an unrestrained vibrato of enjoyment. It hung in the air and
satisfied its purpose; it seemed to lash the walls of the room and
hurl its message defiantly at the ceiling. It could not be subdued,
and it could never be forgotten. It was an amazing laugh. It was
like the wind on the moors, or the crash of great high waves
breaking on a rock, something that had been imprisoned and suddenly
breaks free and rides serenely to its end...</p>

<p class="poem">"And the saintly Cybeline"&mdash;</p>

<p>It was curious. Why, immediately he heard the young man's laugh,
did this line occur to him? Gales was standing by the sideboard
looking flustered and perturbed. People did not laugh in the
presence of Gales. He had a faculty of discouraging any flippant
digressions from the dignity of politics or dinner. Lanyon was
looking in the young man's direction, his keen eyes surveying the
wine-glasses set there.</p>

<p>Old Sir Andrew looked at him also and smiled dimly; but,
surprisingly enough, the others hardly seemed to have noticed the
laugh.</p>

<p>Lord Bowel was saying:</p>

<p>"If, therefore, we are prepared to accept this crisis which the
Opposition&mdash;with a singular lack of insight, in my
opinion&mdash;seem disposed to precipitate upon the country, we
shall be&mdash;er&mdash;lacking in loyalty not only to
the&mdash;er&mdash;Constitution, but to ourselves, and I said to
the Chief on Wednesday..."</p>

<p class="poem">"And the saintly Cybeline"&mdash;</p>

<p class='noindent'>What on earth did it mean? What was Lord Bowel
talking about? Why did the young man's laugh still seem to be
ringing round the room? He looked at him, the boy was talking
animatedly to Brodray and grinning; he thought he caught something
about "we didn't sleep under cover for a fortnight." He had not
been drinking&mdash;certainly not to excess. No one had had sherry
except the silent Tippins. He might have had three glasses of
champagne. It certainly didn't account for the laugh; besides, it
was not that sort of laugh.</p>

<p class="poem">"There was something, something, something,<br>
And the something will entwine,<br>
And the something, something, something<br>
With the saintly Cybeline."</p>

<p>A shadowy vision glimmered past the finger-bowl in front of him.
He remembered now&mdash;it was in Frodsee's room at Magdalen. There
was a tall chap, with curly dark hair, sitting on Frodsee's table,
swinging his legs. He was in "shorts," and his bare knees and
stockings were splashed with mud. Frodsee himself was standing by
the window, declaiming his ridiculous jingle. And there was a third
boy there who was laughing uncontrollably.</p>

<p class="poem">"With the saintly Cybeline."</p>

<p>He wished he could remember the rest of the words. The sun was
streaming through the window, and the young willows were whispering
above the river. The jingle finished and they all laughed, and one
laugh rang out above the rest. Strange that it should all come
rushing back to him at that moment&mdash;the free ring of his own
laughter across the years! He had something then, he couldn't think
what it was, something that he had since lost.</p>

<p>"Even if in the end we have to sacrifice some of these minor
principles, I am inclined to think, sir, that the broader issues
will be better served...The interests of the Party are
interdependent..."</p>

<p>Nielson was speaking, nervously twisting the cigar in his
mouth.</p>

<p>He made a desperate plunge to find his place in the flow of this
desultory discussion. He mumbled some inchoate remark upon the Land
Laws. It was not in any way germane to what had just been said, and
he knew it, only he wanted them to draw him back among them, to
protect him from the flood of perverse memories that strove to
increase his melancholy.</p>

<p>But the memory of that laugh unnerved him. He could not
concentrate. He longed once more for Dilgerson, or for some power
that would give him a grip upon his concrete existence. He rose
from the table and led his guests back into the Japanese room. He
lighted a cigar, and, contrary to his custom, he indulged in a
liqueur. His guests formed themselves into little groups, and he
hovered between them, afraid to remain with either long, in case
they should discover his horror, that in that hour&mdash;all
through a boy's laugh&mdash;he had lost the power to
concentrate.</p>

<p>Perhaps something in his manner conveyed itself to his guests,
for they broke up early. First old Griggs, then Nielson, then
Brodray, and the boy. He shook the boy's hand, but made no
comment.</p>

<p>Lanyon took his departure alone, and Tippins followed. Lord
Bowel seemed the only one disposed to remain. He sank back in an
easy chair and talked interminably, unconscious of any
psychological change in the atmosphere of the room. He found a
patient listener in Gregory Caste, to whom the discussions of a
Government official were as balm.</p>

<p>The host moved restlessly, blinking at his two remaining guests.
Sometimes he would sit furtively on the edge of a chair and listen,
and nod his head, and say, "Yes...yes, I quite agree. Yes, that is
so."</p>

<p>Then he would rise, and walk to the fireplace and move some
object an inch or two from the position in which it was placed, and
then move it back again. He drank a glass of lemon-water, a row of
which were placed on a silver tray by the wall, and smoked another
cigarette. Then the instinct of common courtesy prompted him once
more to join his two remaining guests. He looked closely at Lord
Bowel's heavy cheeks, and a curious feeling of disgust came over
him. The voice of the Board of Trade official boomed on luxuriously
about the arts of Eastern people, about ceramics, about the
diseases of bees, the iniquity of licensing restrictions, the
influence of Chaldean teaching on modern theology, on the best
hotel in Paris, on the vacillating character of the principal
leaders of the Opposition. There seemed no end to the variety of
theme, and no break in the dull monotony of voice.</p>

<p>It must have been well after midnight that Lord Bowel suddenly
sighed heavily and rose. He took his host's hand and said
gloomily:</p>

<p>"It has been a most delightful evening."</p>

<p>He watched the two men pass out into the hall, and saw Gales
come ponderously forward and help them with their coats. Then he
drew back and looked into the fire. He pressed his hand to his
brow. He had not a headache, but he felt peculiarly exhausted, as
though he had been through some great strain. In the fire he saw
again the nodding heads of willows and the young clouds scudding
before the wind...He started. He could not understand; he could
have sworn that at that moment he again heard someone laugh. He
looked round to convince himself that he was alone in the room. He
shivered and stood up. He was not well. He was getting old. A time
comes to all men&mdash; Anyway, he had not been a failure. He had
succeeded, in fact, beyond his wildest dreams. His name was known
to everyone in England. His features even graced the pages of the
satiric journals. He was the "safe" man of the Party. One paper had
nicknamed him "Trumps," the safest card in the pack. It was
something to have achieved this, even if&mdash;he had sacrificed
things, impulses, convictions, passions, the fierce joy of
expressing his primitive self. Perhaps in the process he had lost
something.</p>

<p>Ah, God! He wished the young man had not laughed.</p>

<p>There was a gentle tap on the door, and Gales came in.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon, sir!" he murmured softly.</p>

<p>"It's all right. I'm going to bed."</p>

<p>He rose weakly from the chair and went upstairs. Once more in
the bedroom, the silence tormented him. The furniture seemed no
longer his own, no longer an expression of himself, but a cold,
frigid statement of dead conformity. He touched the bed, and then
walked up and down. What could he do? He had no power to combat the
strange terrors of remorse that flooded him. He sat there silently
waiting for the mood to pass. He knew that if he struggled it
<i>would</i> pass. He would be himself again. It was all so
foolish, so unworthy of him. He kept saying that to himself, but
underneath it all something else seemed stirring, something that
went to the roots of his being and shook him violently.</p>

<p>He waited there a long time, till the house seemed given over to
the embraces of the night, then he stealthily crept downstairs
again. It was all in darkness. He turned on the light in the hall
and dining-room. He wandered to his accustomed chair at the
dining-table and huddled into it. He struggled to piece together
the memories of days of freedom and splendour, when he had
sacrificed nothing, when life was an open book.</p>

<p>He visualised little incidents of his childhood and schooldays,
but they seemed trivial and without significance or humour.</p>

<p>Ah, God! if he could laugh!</p>

<p>He started suddenly at the sound of someone moving in the hall.
He knew instinctively it would be Gales. He jumped up. He did not
want his loyal retainer to think him a fool. It would be the most
terrible thing of all to appear ridiculous to Gales. He walked
round the room nervously peering at the floor.</p>

<p>Gales blinked at him. He was in a dressing-gown, and he
mumbled:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir?"</p>

<p>He glanced at Gales but said nothing. He continued searching the
floor. Gales advanced into the room and coughed, and looked at him
curiously. He had never known Gales look at him before in quite
that way. He felt suddenly angry with the servant and wanted to get
rid of him, but at the same time he was self-conscious and afraid.
He was aware of the level tones of Gales's voice murmuring:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir, may I help you? Have you lost anything? Can
I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The horror came home to him with increased violence as he
glanced at the puffy cheeks of the butler. He felt that he could
not endure him for another moment. He almost ran to the door,
calling out in a harsh voice as he did so:</p>

<p>"Yes...yes. I've lost something."</p>

<p>He brushed past the butler, his cheeks hot and dry, and his eyes
blazing with an unforgiving anger. He did not turn again, but
hurried away, like an animal that is ashamed to be seen, and ran
whimpering upstairs to his bedroom.</p>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>30. ONE LAW FOR THE RICH</h2>

<p>Reuben and his brother Isaac went trudging across the wet grass
on their way back from cousin Hermann's funeral. A cold penetrating
rain was falling, and suddenly Reuben emitted a loud sneeze,
followed by a cough.</p>

<p>"There!" he exclaimed. "Just what Rebecca warned me about! These
confounded funerals!"</p>

<p>As though in fraternal sympathy Isaac also suddenly sneezed and
coughed, and answered: "Beathly!"</p>

<p>Before reaching the cemetery gates it was obvious that both
brothers had caught cold at the funeral. They were sneezing and
coughing for all they were worth. Outside the gates stood an
enormous car, the outside shaped like a bladder, the inside
upholstered like a mannequin parlour. It belonged to Reuben. I must
mention at this point that in appearance the brothers were very
much alike, and in their almost identical mourning clothes there
was nothing to betoken the fact that whereas Isaac was a poor man
Reuben was enormously rich. Isaac owned a small stationer's shop in
Notting Hill and he lived above the premises with his wife and five
young children. The business just paid its way, and the family
seemed quite comfortable and satisfied.</p>

<p>Reuben had started out in some business in connection with
corsets, but he had branched out into other lines, and was now so
rich as to be notorious wherever men foregathered in search of
wealth or success. In fact, one of the political parties, feeling
presumably that some recognition should be paid to such a lot of
money as all that, had presented him with a knighthood. He was now
Sir Reuben.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Sir Reuben at the cemetery gates. "I'll drop
you."</p>

<p>I'm afraid I must again break off to do a little moralising. Oh,
you who are rich and have large cars, don't go in for "dropping"
people. Either leave them alone or take them right home to their
doors. The few extra minutes makes little difference to you, but
you have no idea what a difference it makes to your temporary
guest. After travelling so luxuriously it spoils all the pleasure
to have to get out and walk, or scramble on to a 'bus for the last
part of your journey. Sir Reuben was by nature a "dropper."
Kind-hearted and well meaning, he was all in favour of generosity
up to the point where it didn't interfere with his own comforts and
convenience. And so he "dropped" his brother Isaac near the Marble
Arch and left him to make his way home as best he might, while he
himself rolled on to his pseudo-Italian palace in Kensington.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined from this that Reuben did not love his
brother Isaac. He did, but his mind was very preoccupied with all
this coughing and sneezing. He detested illness and discomfort.
Moreover, he detested and dreaded the idea of death. So one may say
that when he dropped his brother at the Marble Arch he dropped him
also from his mind for some time to come. Arrived in his own noble
hall he called out for his wife, but as she did not respond at once
he clapped his hands. (This was a trick which found great disfavour
in the eyes of the head butler, who, however, having a delicate
wife and two children, was not in a position to protest.) Then
Rebecca came. She was a good wife, and she bustled him to bed, gave
him two hot water bottles, and telephoned to Sir Angus McHeath,
their family physician. The latter arrived two hours later. He came
armed with stethoscopes, tubes, and mysterious gadgets. He took the
patient's pulse, respiration, temperature, blood-pressure, and
other things. He said: "Ah!" and "H'm!" a number of times. Then he
sent for Rebecca and said: "I think we had better send for a night
nurse. This is a very sharp attack." And he mumbled something that
sounded like Latin. Reuben had a bad night, worrying about his
illness, and when he nearly fell asleep the night nurse would come
and administer a powder. The next morning Sir Angus arrived early
and a day nurse was requisitioned. Sir Angus made a more prolonged
examination. He appeared disturbed and more mysterious than ever.
At last he said: "I don't like the look of that uvula at all, Sir
Reuben. I think if you don't object I should like my friend Sir
Alan Blaikie to have a look at it."</p>

<p>Sir Reuben, who was very frightened, nodded his head, and said:
"Yes, yes." Sir Alan came that same afternoon. He also made an
exhaustive examination, but after a consultation with Sir Angus it
appeared that the root of the trouble was not in the uvula, but in
the larynx. Now there was only one man in London who really
understood the larynx, and that was Sir James Baird McHoick.
Fortunately Sir James was in town and he managed to spare time for
a visit the next morning. After his examination he and Sir Angus
and Sir Alan (Good old Scotland!) held a consultation. It lasted an
hour. At the end of that time Sir Angus came back to Sir Reuben. He
said they were of opinion that a "teeny-weeny" operation on the
throat would be advisable. Quite a slight one, but they were
anxious to avoid all risks. The small eyes of the patient glowed as
he muttered: "Yes, yes. Avoid all risks." In the meantime,
continued Sir Angus, there was just a shade of uncertainty as to
what extent the lung might be affected, and he would like his
friend Sir Bryan Buggesley to just go over it. "Yes, yes," said
Reuben. The lung proved to be quite sound, but the next day Sir
James Baird McHoick arrived, accompanied by Sir Angus and also by
Dr. Hector Brown-Browne McIntosh, who was said to be the best
anaesthetist in London. And the "teeny-weeny" operation was
performed quite successfully. (The "teeny-weeny" account for same
followed in the course of a few posts.) And Reuben recovered, and
when he was well enough to sit up, Sir Angus came and discussed
climates. "Well, now, I think, Sir Reuben, a month at Las Palmas or
Teneriffe would set you up properly." In the end they compromised
with Madeira, and Reuben went off with his beloved Rebecca and
spent a month at Funchal. And Reuben sat blinking in the sun,
thinking what a lot of money he might be making were he in
England.</p>

<p>And then one day they returned, and the morning after their
arrival Reuben went down to business as usual. He left early in the
afternoon as the doctor advised him. Driving back home he suddenly
remembered his brother Isaac. Lordy! Lordy! how he had forgotten
Isaac! The day of Hermann's funeral came back to him, and he and
Isaac tramping across the grass, both coughing and sneezing. They
were both apparently in a similar condition. What had happened to
Isaac? Reuben at that moment realised that he loved his brother. He
called through the speaking tube and told the chauffeur to go to an
address in Notting Hill. Suppose&mdash;suppose Isaac were dead!
<i>He</i> had no money to hire expensive doctors or to visit sunny
climes. Oh, what had happened to Isaac? A bell rang crazily as he
entered the shop, and the assistant, Meyers, who recognised him,
smiled and ushered him into the back parlour. And Isaac came,
followed by his wife Emma, both looking quite well and smiling
friendly. "Well, well, Reuben?" "Well, well, Isaac?" They talked of
indifferent things for some moments, and then Reuben said:</p>

<p>"You remember the day of Hermann's funeral, Isaac? and how we
both coughed and sneezed?" "Why, I should think I do," answered
Isaac. "I came home feeling dreadful, dreadful. And Emma pushed a
spoon into my mouth and said, 'Why, Isaac, you've got a relaxed
throat!'"</p>

<p>"Yes, and then what did you do?" asked Reuben.</p>

<p>"Oh, Emma sent me to bed, put on a cold water compress, gave me
a stiff whisky toddy, and I was all right the next day."</p>

<p>Oh, Holy Fire and Water! Jiminy-Piminy! Reuben stared at his
plump hands resting on his knees. Unreason and unfairness
everywhere! A cold water compress! Oh, Lordy, Lordy! All right the
next morning! Figures flashed through Reuben's mind. Specialists,
nurses, the operation, the trip to Madeira, somewhere round about
twelve hundred pounds&mdash;apart from losses in business through
absence. Unreason and unfairness! A cold water compress, indeed!
Someone was speaking to him. He looked up to see Emma's shining
face.</p>

<p>"You'll stay and have a cup of tea, Reuben?"</p>

<p>He nodded his head vigorously several times. Not that he wanted
tea; he never touched the stuff. The room smelt faintly of cooking
and carpet soap. Somewhere upstairs children were making an
infernal noise. But he didn't want to go. He felt at that moment
that, as it were, he might learn something from these people, that
indeed he might <i>gain</i> something.</p>

<p>A cold water compress, indeed! Oh, Lordy, Lordy!</p>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>31. TWO OF THOSE WOMEN</h2>

<p>When travelling on the continent one must always be impressed, I
think, by curious types of Englishwomen whom one never sees in
their own country. One regards the French caricaturists' impression
of the Englishwomen as a piece of absurd extravagance until one
joins the Paris express at Charing Cross or Victoria. Very often
they are middle-aged or quite elderly, and they go about singly, or
in pairs, or sometimes in a party of three or four, like flocks of
drab swallows. There is something terribly pathetic in their
demeanour, particularly when one begins to realise the fact that
they are not tourists, but hotel habitu&eacute;es. For there is a
difference. The tourist is there temporarily for pleasure or
sight-seeing, but the hotel habitu&eacute;e is a permanent, tragic,
and often inexplicable figure. All over the South of France and
Italy particularly there are thousands of these women staying at
pensions and small hotels, drifting from place to place,
rudderless, unwanted, and patently unhappy. They have the
atmosphere of exiles, as of people who have committed some crime in
their own country, and dare not return. And in many cases the crime
that they have committed is, I suspect, the unpardonable crime of
poverty. Women who have held some kind of social position in their
own country, and become impoverished, develop the not unreasonable
idea that they can live more cheaply, and with more dignity in a
foreign hotel. Some are exiled for reasons or illusions of health,
or because some one has disappointed them or broken their hearts.
These women in any case never give the impression that their mode
of life is an entirely voluntary one. Although they may assume a
perfunctory interest in the life and activities of the place of
their sojourn, I have noticed that their chief concern is
invariably&mdash;the next mail from England.</p>

<p>The story that I am going to tell is about two such women, and
if I appear as a rather unscrupulous eavesdropper, you must please
understand that I was a very unwilling one. In fact, I derived no
actual enjoyment from it at all.</p>

<p>The accommodation in the little Hotel Beau-sejour at Antibes is
very limited. I was trying to write something at the only writing
table in the lounge, when two of these women&mdash;as I will call
them&mdash;came along and seated themselves opposite me, and began
to talk in languid voices.</p>

<p>Now I don't know what your powers of concentration are, but
personally whenever I hear people talking I am bound to listen to
what they say, however banal and trivial it may be. On this
occasion I honestly did try to concentrate for a time, but their
conversation soon usurped my entire attention. I realised that it
was going to be no good, and so I drifted into the dishonest but
popular habit of drawing diagrams on the back of hotel
envelopes.</p>

<p>One of these women was about sixty, the other could hardly have
been thirty, and they were obviously strangers to each other. But
they had one thing in common. It might be called a kind of
soul-weariness. Both were tired and bored, existing only in
reminiscences. And it became very apparent that neither wanted to
listen to the other. The old lady wanted to talk about her son. The
younger one wanted to talk about some other man, and having missed
the opening sentences I could not gather at first whether it was
her brother, her lover, or her husband. But I could not help being
impressed by the impatient attitude of either, while the other was
speaking. They kept on interjecting: "Yes, yes. No. Really! Fancy!
and the way they said it showed that neither had taken in a word of
what the other had said.</p>

<p>"I shall never forget the pranks he used to play at Bolsover
House School," the elder woman was saying. "There was a Euclid and
gymnastic master there none of the boys liked...what was his name?
I have forgotten. And there was a Miss Beaswyck, the matron, a very
prim and severe person, who always wore black kid gloves. One day
she annoyed Georgie very much. I have forgotten why. And Mr.
Raynes&mdash;yes, that was his name, funny how it comes to you when
you're telling a story, and not trying to remember&mdash;well, he
had punished Georgie for not doing his home work. When Mr. Raynes
went to bed that night he found Miss Beaswyck's black kid gloves,
filled with cold porridge, in his bed. And Miss Beaswyck found Mr.
Raynes boxing gloves filled with cold porridge in <i>her</i> bed.
Oh dear! there was a to-do!"</p>

<p>"Really! how amusing!" said the younger woman, without
enthusiasm. "Well, it happened in the very early spring..."</p>

<p>"Of course, where Georgie was so splendid was, he confessed. He
confessed simply because the master suspected one of the other
boys, and although nothing could be proved, he couldn't bear the
idea of the other boy living under this eternal stigma."</p>

<p>"Quite right," said the younger woman. "There are so few people
with any sense of altruism. Now when I first met Peter, I was
coming off duty at the base hospital at Amiens. We had had a
terrible thirty-six hours. I was feeling awful&mdash;done up and
finished. I must have looked awful. It was just after dawn. In the
courtyard I suddenly felt my knees sagging. I was talking to an
orderly, when I heard a voice say 'Can't you see she's going to
faint?' Before I did faint, I just had time to glimpse a pair of
deep blue eyes, and the kindest face I have ever seen. He carried
me somewhere. He never asked my name. He just did the kind thing
and went away&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, my dear, there were some wonderful men in the War.
Some vile, some sublime. My son, for instance. Ah, yes, we
women...We women...It was wicked of me, I suppose, but oh, how I
used to pray that it would be over before my Georgie came of age!
Oh, why couldn't they have come to some arrangement!"</p>

<p>"I know. I believe we women who...who had some one in it we
loved all felt that. Of course, I did see him again, otherwise, I
shouldn't be telling you all this..."</p>

<p>The elder woman uttered a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"We were so helpless though. Georgie never told me. He joined up
a year before he was qualified, as a <i>private</i>, mind you! a
private! and to think that my uncle commanded a brigade in the
South African War! Of course he was such a splendid boy. He stood
nearly six feet when he was eighteen. He looked every inch an
officer even in his Tommy's uniform. A lot of the others used
instinctively to call him 'Sir.' He wrote me such lovely letters,
so cheerful, so gay, even when he was down with fever in those
dreadful swamps in Greece. He used to write home about&mdash;oh,
about everything except the war. It was just as though he were more
interested in our little doings at Battlinghurst than he was
in&mdash;in himself and the war."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the younger woman wearily. "I met Peter a few
days later quite by chance in a narrow street near the railway
station. He walked straight up to me and gravely asked me how I
was. I was amazed that he remembered me. He looked, in the curious
outfit they used to wear in the trenches, like one of those
mediaeval knights. He told me he was going up to the front line in
two hours' time. We had only a few hurried words and then he
went."</p>

<p>The elder woman clicked her tongue with what was meant to be a
display of sympathy and interest, but her aged and shortsighted
eyes were elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Games! that was what he was so good at. Cricket, football, all
those things. They said there were several colleges at both Oxford
and Cambridge anxious to have him because he could run a hundred
yards in&mdash;ten minutes, was it? and he could knock anybody over
at football. And yet the wonderful thing was he was so gentle with
it all. He wouldn't hurt a fly if he could help it. Of course he
got his commission, my dear, did I tell you?"</p>

<p>I saw on the face of the younger woman a sudden expression of
utter disgust and annoyance. She was, I am sure, thinking: "Oh, you
tedious old fool! What do I care about your ridiculous son! Don't
you understand I'm trying to tell you about Peter. Peter! you know,
my Peter, the most wonderful person in the world."</p>

<p>The old lady was continuing:</p>

<p>"It seems strange to me, my dear, that after all these years,
that part of it seems unreal. I can remember very little about it.
Nothing at all about names and places and regiments and all those
things. It was just a terrible nightmare coming between me and
Georgie. When I think of him it is always of him when he was a baby
or a boy. Everything, everything, I remember everything of those
early days."</p>

<p>The expression of the younger woman suggested: What was the
interest of a baby and a schoolboy compared with the interest of a
young man in the first flush of virile manhood? She fidgetted in
her chair, and there was a silence. The two of them seemed to fall
apart and forget each other. After a pause they drifted together
again like migratory birds on a long flight. Strangely enough, it
was the elder woman who seemed first conscious of their need for
some kind of communion. Perhaps her conscience stabbed her that she
had occupied too much of the conversation. She said
hesitatingly:</p>

<p>"Did you marry this&mdash;did you marry the young man, my
dear?"</p>

<p>It was evident that the question moved the younger woman
profoundly.</p>

<p>She put her hand to her throat, and whispered almost
inaudibly:</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Then controlling herself with an effort she continued:</p>

<p>"No, no, no. But you may guess the reason."</p>

<p>"He was killed?"</p>

<p>The younger woman shook her head, and her voice shaking with
tears, said:</p>

<p>"I do not know. In the war it was so easy to lose touch with
people. We only met four times. But he swore that he loved me at
our last meeting. God knows I loved him. Soon after he went I
developed typhoid fever. I was terribly ill and sent to England.
When I recovered I could find no trace of him. Whether he had been
killed or sent to another front, perhaps killed there, perhaps
married to someone else...I don't know, I tell you, I don't know. I
shall never know. It was more than ten years ago this coming April,
when the chestnut trees were blossoming along the banks of the
Canal...I was only a girl then...oh, my God!"</p>

<p>She was trembling from the effect of this little outbreak, but
in the pause she seemed to realise that it was she who had been
monopolising the conversation. It was comforting to have
<i>anyone</i> to tell all this to, you could see. And after all,
the poor old lady had lost her son. Could it be as terrible to lose
a son as a lover? Controlling herself she said:</p>

<p>"Where was your boy killed?"</p>

<p>The older woman was apparently reacting to this emotional
display. Her eyes were fixed on the ground, and her tongue was
beating a little tattoo between her lips. She did not answer the
question.</p>

<p>"That dreadful uncertainty!" she suddenly exclaimed, "how it has
eaten me up. Men have never quite known what it means. Why do they
have these wars? Why can't they come to some arrangement, I say?
You are young, my dear. You may yet have a son, and pour out all
your substance into making him a man. And when he has arrived at
that..."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders helplessly, and the younger woman
said:</p>

<p>"No, I shall never have a son. I could never, never, love anyone
but Peter."</p>

<p>It was quite apparent that during the last few minutes the women
had been drawn more closely together. A link was formed by their
common grief. Neither of them was any longer entirely preoccupied
with her individual trouble. The younger woman repeated her
question:</p>

<p>"Where was your boy killed, Mrs.&mdash;er&mdash;?"</p>

<p>In her effort to appear interested she was handicapped by not
knowing her companion's name, and she plainly did not like to
address her as she herself was addressed as "my dear." What did it
matter? They had drifted together, as they would drift apart. A
name or a term meant nothing. Then the elder woman made a remark
which surprised me:</p>

<p>"My son was not killed. He is still alive."</p>

<p>I think this interested me more than it did the younger woman.
Indeed, her brow puckered into a little perplexed frown, as though
she thought that the other had not been quite playing the game. Why
all this extravagant grief if she had not lost the boy after all?
What was the old woman making this fuss about? The latter was
continuing:</p>

<p>"He was captured by the Turks, you know. Did I tell you? Was it
the Turks or the Arabs? some of those dark people, anyway, over
there..."</p>

<p>She made a vague gesture in the direction of the North Pole.</p>

<p>"Georgie was two and a half years in one of their foul prisons.
Ah! how vile it is that a man should be sent to prison for merely
serving his country! Oh, and the conditions of it, the misery, the
torture, the anguish! No, I think for part of the time it was a
Russian prison. I can't remember all that. I was so distracted. He
lost an eye, a leg, and memory to a large extent. He had fever, I
know. He hardly told us anything. And when in the end he came back,
everything about him seemed to be lost. All his youth, and spirits.
He hardly seemed to remember or care for me. Before he went out he
was engaged to Millicent Brander, our vicar's daughter, as nice a
girl as you could wish to meet. He would have nothing to do with
her. And she was quite willing to marry him in spite of his missing
eye, and leg, and memory. In delirious moments he swore he loved
some other woman he had met on the Continent. I'm not sure it
wasn't other women&mdash;vague names he mumbled. Absurd, of course,
it all was. The doctors tried to persuade me that he would get
right. He was chock full of illusions and panics...But eight years
have passed, and he is little better. He takes little interest in
anything except carpentry, and flowers, and keeping bees."</p>

<p>"Where does he live?"</p>

<p>"At present he is in Switzerland. Someone persuaded me, I've
forgotten who. He's staying with one of these new German doctors,
they make so much fuss about these days. You know, what do they
call it? men who treat the mind. I don't believe in it, but he
might as well be there as anywhere. Oh, yes, I believe it was my
brother who persuaded me, and he is a doctor himself. A qualified
medical man, but he dabbles in this other business. But why should
I distress you, my dear, with all this? I'm an old fool, I know.
Tell me more about your&mdash;Stephen, wasn't it? What is he
like?"</p>

<p>The younger woman heaved a deep sigh. I could see that she
considered the story unsatisfactory and inconclusive. Then as
though relieved to turn to a more congenial subject, she said:</p>

<p>"Peter? oh, Peter..." A long pause. "He had deep blue eyes, very
wide apart, a square chin, clean shaven. He was tall and strong,
and there was a kind of&mdash;kind of elasticity about him. Elastic
in mind and body. Beneath the gay exterior you were conscious of
something profound and strong."</p>

<p>The elder woman's interest appeared vaguely aroused.</p>

<p>"But," she said, "didn't you&mdash;didn't you enquire at the War
Office? the Records Office, wasn't it? they knew pretty well."</p>

<p>"That was the absurd part about it. I&mdash;we&mdash;" a girlish
blush came to the younger woman's face. "You see, well, when we
first met it was just a flirtation. I christened him Peter. He made
up a name for me. Life was so unreal in those days. Death seemed to
be the only reality. What did it matter what we were called, who we
were, or, for that matter, what we did? Oh, yes...we did flirt. We
had...lovely times together. It was not till that last meeting when
we both realised that the thing had gone far&mdash;become very
serious. Just before he was leaving when it dawned upon us that
neither knew the other's real name, and we had of course promised
to correspond! There were other officers at the station, and he
took out a card, scribbled his address on it, and thrust it into my
hand. I didn't look at it, but slipped it into my purse. When I got
back to the hospital the purse had disappeared! He had gone and I
did not even know his name! So absorbed had we been with all the
foolish little things that&mdash;people like us talk
about&mdash;you've no idea how in those days we conspired together,
men and women, to ignore the War&mdash;I did not even know his
regiment. I only knew that he was in the heavy artillery."</p>

<p>"Heavy artillery," repeated the elder woman dully.</p>

<p>"Three days later I developed my fever. Oh, I'm not sure&mdash;I
was so worried&mdash;I think the fever started before&mdash;I
nearly went out of my mind."</p>

<p>"You are sure it was the <i>heavy</i> artillery?" said the elder
woman.</p>

<p>The younger one dabbed her nose and nodded. Both seemed to have
fallen apart once more. The elder appeared to be ruminating. As
though to herself she muttered, "These German doctors say that
there is only one thing that could cure my Georgie...but
suppose..."</p>

<p>She took off her spectacles, wiped them, and regarded the other
with the impaired vision of her naked sight, as though by this
means she could observe something, unobserved herself.</p>

<p>"What was the pet name he called you, my dear?"</p>

<p>The younger woman appeared to hesitate. This was sacred ground.
This old woman had no right to trespass. And yet, after all, she
had already said so much. Greed for sympathy and understanding, she
said in a quiet clear voice:</p>

<p>"Little Wind-flower."</p>

<p>The elder woman stood up and faced the window. She was still not
wearing her glasses. The girl could not see her face, but I could.
And I have never seen a stranger expression on the face of any
living creature. Her eyes were wide open, and probably seeing
nothing, but to me they seemed to absorb all the phenomena of
existence at a glance. They were alight with amazement, and
questioning. She was trembling violently, her lips were shaking,
and I quite expected her to swoon. I felt most terribly
embarrassed, as though I had stepped into a forbidden sanctuary. I
did not know how to act. Neither of the women had taken the
slightest notice of me. They had spoken in the quiet normal voices
which women of their kind usually employ in an hotel, rather
indifferent as to whether they are overheard or not by the other
hotel guests. They had probably been aware of me at first, when the
conversation opened so conventionally, but had forgotten me when
they began to exchange their profound confidences.</p>

<p>But the elder woman did not swoon. After considerable effort she
repeated in a perfectly controlled voice:</p>

<p>"Little Wind-flower!"</p>

<p>She turned and glanced overtly at the younger, but whether she
could see her or not I could not say. Then she sat down, put on and
carefully adjusted her spectacles. With a motherly gesture she put
her hand on the other's, and said casually:</p>

<p>"What are your plans, my dear?"</p>

<p>The younger woman shrugged her shoulders, in the manner of one
to whom plans have no longer interest or significance.</p>

<p>"Listen, then," said the elder. "Will you do me a favour? I am
leaving on Thursday for Lausanne to see my son. Will you come as my
companion?"</p>

<p>The younger woman hesitated, and the elder seemed to press her
hands harder, and she spoke earnestly and vehemently:</p>

<p>"Please do, my dear. I had a companion, and she had to leave
because of illness in her family. I don't know what your position
is, but I would gladly pay you. I am not badly off. My uncle, the
brigadier, left me money last year. Please come. Oh, do please
come."</p>

<p>"You are extremely kind," said the younger woman. "I must think.
I&mdash;have no plans, but this is&mdash;oh, please forgive me if I
go away and think. It is most generous of you. I have just enough
to pig along at these little hotels. But still&mdash;please forgive
me."</p>

<p>She gave both her companion's hands a tight squeeze and hurried
out of the lounge. The old lady removed her spectacles once more.
She wiped them with her handkerchief, and again dabbed her eyes.
She was entirely oblivious to my presence. Her whole character
seemed to have changed. She was still shaking, but it was with a
kind of elation. For several minutes she sat there, mumbling to
herself. Twice I heard her mutter:</p>

<p>"Little Wind-flower! Peter, she called him, did she?"</p>

<p>Unaccountable tears clouded her old eyes. Pressing her hand to
her temple she whispered hoarsely: "Oh, if it should be&mdash;"</p>

<p>She rose very slowly, and appeared to grope her way out of the
room.</p>

<p>I sat there for a long time until it began to get dark.</p>

<p>A waiter came in.</p>

<p>"Shall I turn on the light, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"No, please," I said, "leave it all just as it is."</p>

<p>And I continued to stare at my empty writing pad.</p>

<p>Two of those women? God forgive me!</p>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>32. LITTLE WHITE FROCK</h2>

<p>When their careers are finished, the painter, the author, the
architect, the sculptor, may point to this or that, and say "Lo,
this is my handiwork. Future generations shall rejoice in me."</p>

<p>But to the actor and the executive musician there is nothing
left but&mdash;memories.</p>

<p>Their permanence lies in the memories of the people who loved
them. They cannot pass it on. Someone may say to you: "Ah! my boy,
you should have heard Jean de Reske." Or: "You should have seen
Macready play that part." And you are bound in all politeness to
accept this verdict, but if you have not heard Jean de Reske, nor
seen Macready, it leaves no definite impression on you at all.
Indeed the actor is in worse case than the musician. For at the
present time there are ingenious mechanical devices for caging the
performance of a musican with varying degrees of success, but no
mechanism could ever imprison the electric thrill of Joseph
Jefferson or Henry Irving on their great nights of triumph. They
are gone for ever, cast away among the limbo of the myths. These
melancholy reflections occurred to me on the first occasion when I
visited Colin Brancker. I met the old chap first of all in the
public library. He had a fine distinguished head with long,
snow-white hair. He was slim, and in spite of a pronounced stoop,
he carried himself with a certain distinction and alertness. I was
a fairly regular visitor to the library, and I always found him
devouring the magazines and newspapers which I particularly wanted
to read myself. A misunderstanding about a copy of "The Saturday
Review" lead to a few formal expressions of courtesy, on the
following day to a casual nod, later on to a few words about the
weather, then to a profound bow on his part, and an inquiry after
his health from me. Once we happened to be going out at the same
time and I walked to the end of the road with him.</p>

<p>He interested me at once. His clear, precise diction, with its
warm timbre of restrained emotion, was very arresting. His sympathy
about the merest trifles stirred you to the depths. If he said
"What a glorious day it is to-day!" it was not merely a
conventional expression, but a kind of paean of all the joy and
ecstasy of spring life, sunshine and young lambs frisking in the
green meadows.</p>

<p>If he said: "Oh! I'm so sorry," in reply to your announcement
that you had lost your 'bus ticket coming along and had had to pay
twice, the whole dread incident appeared to you envisaged through a
mist of tears. The grief of Agamemnon weeping over the infidelity
of Clytemnestra seemed but a trite affair in comparison.</p>

<p>One day with infinite tact he invited me to "his humble abode."
He occupied the upper part of a small house in Talbot Road. He
lived alone, but was apparently tended by a gaunt middle-aged woman
who glided about the place in felt slippers.</p>

<p>The rooms were as he expressed it "humble" but not by any means
poverty-stricken. He had several pieces of old furniture and
bric-a-brac, innumerable mementos and photographs. It was then that
I realised the peculiar position of the actor. If he had been a
painter I could have looked at some of his work and have "placed"
him, but what could you do with an old actor who lived so much in
the past? The position seemed to me pitiable.</p>

<p>Doubtless in his day he had been a fine and distinguished actor
and here was I, who knew nothing about him, and did not like to ask
what parts he had played because I felt that I ought to know.
Neither was he very informing. Not that he was diffident in
speech&mdash;he talked well and volubly&mdash;but I had to gather
what he had done by his various implications. There was a signed
photograph of himself in the character of Malvolio and in many
other Shakespearian parts. There were also signed photographs of J.
L. Toole, and Henry Irving, and innumerable actors, some of whom
were famous and others whose names were unfamiliar to me. By slow
degrees I patched together some of the romantic tissues of his
life. Whatever position he may have held in the theatrical world,
he certainly still had the faculty of moving one person
profoundly&mdash;myself. Everything in that little room seemed to
vibrate with romance. One of Irving's photographs was inscribed:
"To my dear old friend, Colin Brancker." On the circular table was
an enamel snuff-box given him by Nellie Farren.</p>

<p>When he spoke of his mother his voice sounded like some distant
organ with the <i>vox humana</i> stop pulled out. I gathered that
his mother had been a famous French actress. On the piano was a fan
given her by the Empress Eugenie. He never spoke of his father.
Nearly everything had some intimate association. I formed a habit
of calling on old Brancker on Thursday evenings when my wife
usually visited an invalid aunt. The experience was always a
complete entertainment. He knew nothing of my world and I knew
nothing of his. I came completely under the spell of his imagery. I
had only to touch some trinket on the mantel-piece to set the whole
machinery of retrospection on the move. He came haltingly to his
subject as though he were feeling for it through the
lavender-scented contents of some old drawer. But when the subject
was discovered, he brought the whole picture vividly before my
mind. I could see those people strutting before the footlights,
hear them laugh and joke in their stuffy lodgings and their green
rooms, follow their hard life upon the road, their struggles and
adversities, and successes, and above all the moving throb of their
passions and romances.</p>

<p>And then the picture would die out. It had no beginning and no
end. It was just an impression. The angle of vision would alter.
Something else would appear upon the scene.</p>

<p>After a time, touched with pity for this lonely and derelict old
actor, my wife and I occasionally sent him little presents of game
and port wine, when such things came our way. I would like to
explain at this point that my wife is younger than I. Her outlook
is less critical and introspective. To use her own expression, she
is out to have a good time. She enjoys dances and theatres and gay
parties. And after all, why shouldn't she? She is young and
beautiful and full of life. Her hair&mdash;but I digress! In spite
of the pheasants and the port she had never met old Brancker. But
one day we all happened to meet at the corner of the Talbot Road. I
then enjoyed an entirely novel vision of my hero. He was
magnificent. The bow he made, the long sweep of the hat would have
put D'Artagnan to shame. When I introduced them, he held her hand
for a moment and said:</p>

<p>"It is indeed a great pleasure!"</p>

<p>It doesn't sound very much in print, but Alice completely went
under. She blushed with pleasure and told me afterwards that she
thought he was "a perfect old dear!" The affair lapsed for several
weeks. I still continued to call upon him, and we nearly exhausted
the whole gamut of his belongings. We even routed through old
drawers where faded remnants of ancient fustian would recall some
moving episode of the past. I became greedy for these visionary
adventures.</p>

<p>One night rather late I found the little white frock. So
familiar had I become with my old friend that I was allowed to poke
about his rooms on my own and ask him questions. It was a child's
frock and it lay neatly folded on the top of a chest in the
passage. I brought it into the room, where he was sipping his rum
and water, and said:</p>

<p>"What's this, Mr. Brancker?"</p>

<p>He fixed his eyes upon the frock and instantly I was aware that
he was strangely moved. At first an expression of surprise and
bewilderment crept over his face, then I observed a look of utter
dejection and remorse. He did not speak, and rather confusedly I
went up to him and touched him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," I said. "Doubtless there is some story....I ought
not to have&mdash;"</p>

<p>Instantly he patted my arm in return and muttered:</p>

<p>"No, no. It's quite all right, old boy. And I will tell you,
only not to-night. No, not to-night."</p>

<p>He stood up and took one or two turns up and down the room in
silence. I did not dare to intrude into the secret chamber of his
memories. Suddenly he turned to me, and putting his arm round my
shoulder, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Old boy, come in to-morrow. Come to dinner. Bring the wife.
Yes, you must both come. Come to dinner at seven-thirty. And
then&mdash;I will tell you the story of that little white
frock."</p>

<p>It happened that a dance my wife had intended going to the
following night had fallen through. To my surprise she jumped at
Mr. Brancker's invitation. She said that she thought it would be
extremely interesting. I felt a little nervous of taking her. An
invitation to dinner for the first time is always a doubtful
number. The social equation varies so alarmingly and unexpectedly.
My wife frequently dined at what she called "smart" houses. How
could old Brancker possibly manage a dinner in his poky rooms? I
warned her to wear her oldest and shabbiest, and to have a sandwich
before we started. Needless to say my advice was ignored. She
appeared in a wonderful gown of pearl-grey. Experience told me it
was useless to protest, and I jogged along the street by her side
in my tweed suit. And then I had my second surprise. Old Brancker
was in immaculate evening dress. Cunningly modulated lights
revealed a table glittering with silver and glass. I mumbled some
apology for my negligence but in his most courtly way he expressed
his pleasure that I had treated him with such friendly lack of
ceremony. Nevertheless this question of dress&mdash;as so often
happens&mdash;exercised a very definite effect upon my whole
evening. I felt a little out of it. My wife and old Brancker seemed
to belong to one world and I to another. Moreover, their
conversation flowed easily and naturally. The old actor was in his
most brilliant mood, and Alice sparkled and gurgled in response.
Although she was younger and Brancker older than I, I felt at times
that I was the oldest of the three, and that they were just
children playing an absorbing game. And the dinner was the third
surprise.</p>

<p>The gaunt woman served it, gliding in and out of the room with a
quiet assurance. It was no lodging-house dinner, but the artful
succession of little dishes which symbolises the established creed
of superior living creatures. Wine, too, flowed from long-necked
bottles, and coffee was served in diminutive cups. At length Mrs.
Windsor collected the last vestiges of this remarkable feast, but
left on the table a silver tray on which were set four liqueur
glasses and a decanter of green Chartreuse.</p>

<p>"Let us all sit round the fire," said our host. "But first, let
me press you to have a little of this excellent beverage. It was
given me by a holy brother, a man who led a varied life, but who,
alas! died in disgrace."</p>

<p>He passed his hand across his brow as though the memory were too
sacred to be discussed. I sighed involuntarily, and my wife said
brightly:</p>

<p>"Not for me, Mr. Brancker, but you help yourself. And now you're
going to tell us the story of the white frock!"</p>

<p>He raised his fine head and looked at her. Then he stretched out
his long arm across the table and gently pressed her hand.</p>

<p>"I beg of you, dear lady," he said gently, "just one
drop&mdash;in memory of my friend."</p>

<p>The implied sanctity of the appeal could not be denied. Both my
wife and I partook of half a glass, and though I am by nature an
abstainer, I must acknowledge that it tasted very good. Old
Brancker's hand trembled as he poured out the Chartreuse. He drank
his at a gulp, and as though the emotion were not yet stilled he
had another one. Then he rose and taking my wife's arm he led her
to the easy chair by the fire. I was rather proud of my intimate
knowledge of the old actor's possessions, and I pointed out the
snuff-box which Nellie Farren had given him, and the photograph of
Irving with its inscription: "To my dear old friend."</p>

<p>Brancker sighed and shrugged his shoulders. Perhaps one does not
boast of these associations. Perhaps it is vulgar, but I knew how
interested Alice would be. When we had done a round of the rooms,
whither in his fatherly way he had conducted my wife by the arm,
and occasionally rested his hand ever so lightly on her shoulder,
we returned to the dining-room and Alice said:</p>

<p>"Now, show me this little white frock!"</p>

<p>He bowed and without a word went out into the hall and returned
with the frock, which he spread reverently over the back of a
chair.</p>

<p>"How perfectly sweet!" said my wife.</p>

<p>For a few moments he buried his head in his hands, and Alice and
I were silent. I could not but observe the interesting
mise-en-sc&egrave;ne in which I found myself. The dim recesses of
the room heavy with memories. My wife cosily curled up in the high
arm-chair, the firelight playing on her fresh&mdash;almost
childlike&mdash;face, a simple ring sparkling on her finger, and on
the pearly glint of her diaphanous gown. On the other side of the
table where the little glasses stood, the clear-cut features and
long snow-white hair of the old actor, silhouetted against a dark
cabinet. And then like some fragile ghost recalled to bear witness
to its tragic past, the dim outline of the child's white frock.</p>

<p>"It was before your time, mes enfants, long long before your
time," he said suddenly. "You would not remember the famous Charles
Carside Company who starred the provinces. We became known as the
Capacity Company. The title was doubly-earned. We always played to
full houses and in those days&mdash;"</p>

<p>He turned to me with a penetrating, almost challenging, look and
added:</p>

<p>"There were <i>actors</i>. Comedy, and tragedy, history,
everything worth doing in the legitimate was in our repertoire. We
changed our bill every night and sometimes twice a day. Ay, and we
changed our parts, sir. I remember Terry O'Bane and I reversing the
parts of Othello and Iago on alternate nights for two weeks at a
stretch. I played Lord Stamford to his Puttick in 'The Golden
Dawn.' He played Shylock to my Bassanio. I will not bore you with
these details. Ah! Poor old Terry! Poor dear old Terry!"</p>

<p>He stopped and looked down at his hands, and neither of us
spoke.</p>

<p>"When I say that Terry O'Bane and I were friends I want to tell
you that we were friends as only artists can be friends. We loved
each other. For three years we worked together side by
side&mdash;never a suspicion of envy, never a suspicion of
jealousy. I remember one night after Terry's delivery of Jacques's
speech on the fool he did not get a hand. I found him weeping in
the wings. 'Old fellow!' I said, but he gripped me by the arm.
'Colly boy,' he answered, 'I was thinking of you. I knew how
distressed you would be!' Think of that! His only concern was that
I should be distressed. Ah! in those days..."</p>

<p>He stretched his long white fingers and examined them, then
turning suddenly to my wife he said:</p>

<p>"I want to ask you, mademoiselle" (he persisted in calling her
mademoiselle all the evening) "to make allowances in what I am
about to tell you for the <i>tempora et mores</i>. In my young days
love had a different significance to what it has now. In this
modern world I observe nothing but expedience and opportunism. No
one is prepared to sacrifice, to run risks. The love between O'Bane
and me was an epic of self-sacrifice, and it ran its full course.
It found its acid test on the day when Sophie Wiles joined our
company at Leeds."</p>

<p>He stood up and his voice trembled in a low whisper. Looking at
Alice he said:</p>

<p>"She was as beautiful, as fragile, as adorable as you are,
mademoiselle. Strange how these great secrets are conveyed
imperceptibly. O'Bane and I looked at each other, and instinctively
we understood. We said nothing. We made no comment about her. We
were entirely solicitous of each other's feelings. We referred to
her as 'Miss Wiles' and we addressed her as 'Miss Wiles.' Before we
had been three weeks on the road I know that if I had not known
O'Bane's feelings I should have gone to her and said, 'Sophie, my
darling, my angel, I love you, I adore you. Will you marry me?' But
would it have been chivalrous to do this, knowing O'Bane's
sentiments? We were two months on the road before the matter
reached its climax. And during that time&mdash;under an unspoken
compact&mdash;neither of us made love to Sophie. And then one night
I could bear it no longer. I saw the drawn and hungry look on my
colleague's eye as he watched her from the wings. I went up to him
and whispered: 'Old fellow, go in and win. She's worthy of you.' He
understood me at once and he pressed my hand. 'Colly,' he said,
'you're right. This can't go on. Meet me after the show and come
round to my rooms.'"</p>

<p>The old actor's lips were trembling. He drew his chair nearer to
my wife's. "I cannot tell you of the heartburning interview I had
with my old friend that night. Each tried to give way to the other.
It was very terrible, very moving. At length we decided that the
only solution would be to put the matter to a hazard. We could not
cut cards or throw dice. It seemed profane. We decided to play a
game of chess. We set out the pieces and began. But at the end of a
few moments it was apparent that each was trying to let the other
win. 'Stay' I said, 'we must leave the verdict to impartial destiny
after all,' and I rose. On the sideboard&mdash;as it might be
here&mdash;was a large bowl of gloire-de-Dijon roses. I took the
largest bloom and said 'Terry, old boy, if there are an odd number
of petals in this rose she is yours. If an even number, I will pay
her court.' He agreed. Slowly and deliberately, petal by petal, I
destroyed the beautiful bloom. There were fifty-eight petals. When
Terry saw the last petal fall he turned white and swayed. I helped
him to the easy chair and handed him a little grog. It was nearly
dawn. Already the birds were twittering on the window-sill."</p>

<p>He turned and gazed at the window as though even now the magic
of that early morning was upon him.</p>

<p>"The dawn was clear for me, but for my friend how dark and
foreboding! Or so it seemed to both of us at that hour. But as
Mahomet said 'With women, life is a condition of flux.' At eleven
o'clock that morning I was on my bended knees to Sophie. I poured
out all my pent-up feelings of the two months. There are some
things too sacred to repeat even to those who are&mdash;dear to
us."</p>

<p>He gasped and stretching out his arm poured out another glass of
the Chartreuse.</p>

<p>"She refused me, or if she did not actually refuse
me&mdash;indeed she did not; she was sympathetic almost loving, but
so&mdash;indeterminate that I was almost driven to a frenzy of
despair. When one is young, one is like that. One must have all and
at once, or go crazy with despair. For a week I courted her day and
night, and I could not make her decide. She liked me, but she did
not love me. At the end of that time I went to O'Bane and I said,
'Old man, it is your call. My part is played!' Under great pressure
from me he consented to enter the lists and I withheld my hand as
he had done. Even now the memory of that week of anguish when I
knew that my greatest friend was making love to my adored is almost
unbearable. At the end of the week he came to me and said, 'Old
boy, I don't know how I stand. She likes me but I hardly think she
loves me.' I will not burden you with the chronicle of our strange
actions which followed. We decided that as the position was
identical it should be an open fight in a fair field, otherwise
between us we should lose her altogether. We would both pay court
to her wherever and whenever the opportunity occurred. And we would
do so without animosity or ill-will. The tour lasted three months
and I knew that O'Bane was winning. There was no question about it.
He was the favourite. Every minute I expected to hear the dread
glad tidings. And then a strange thing happened."</p>

<p>He leant back in his chair and passed his hands through his hair
with a graceful gesture.</p>

<p>"An uncle in Australia died and left O'Bane an enormous fortune.
He was rich beyond the dreams of avarice. The company all knew of
it and were delighted, all&mdash;all except one person."</p>

<p>He glanced towards my wife and sighed.</p>

<p>"I have lived a good many years and yet I seem to find the heart
of woman as unfathomable, as unexplorable as ever. They are to me
the magic casements opening on the night. There is no limit...every
subtle human experience is capable of endless variation. Sophie
refused to marry O'Bane because people would think she married him
for his money. The anguish of those last weeks I shall never
forget. She definitely refused him, and I was torn between my love
for O'Bane and my love for Sophie. I can say with perfect
truth&mdash;literal truth&mdash;that the fortune killed O'Bane.
When we arrived in London he began to squander. He drank, gambled,
and led a depraved life, all because the woman he loved would not
marry him. In the spring he left the company and took a house in
town. It became the happy hunting ground of loose characters. It is
needless to say that if Sophie wouldn't marry him there were plenty
of other women willing to marry a young millionaire. He became
entangled with a fast and pretty creature called Annabel Peacock.
He married her and in the following year they had a child."</p>

<p>The fire crackled on the hearth; my wife did not take her eyes
from the old actor's face. A black cat strolled leisurely across
the room and stretched itself before the fire. He continued:</p>

<p>"It was then that I experienced an entirely novel vision of
woman's character. Sophie who would not marry O'Bane because he was
rich and who shivered with disgust in the presence of Annabel
Peacock, developed an amazing affection and interest for their
child. We were out again in the Capacity Company. I had her all to
myself. I laid siege to her heart. I was patient, tactful,
importunate, imploring, passionate. But it was all no good, my
boy...no good at all. Heigho! would you believe it for ten years of
my life from that date I was that woman's slave, and she was the
slave of Terry's child. Company after company I joined in order to
be with her. I gave up good parts. I sacrificed leads and in place
I even accepted a walk-on&mdash;anything to be with Sophie. Sophie,
who would not listen to me, who treated me like a little pet, to
run hither and thither, and who spent all her money and time on
toys and clothes for Terry's child. Would you believe it?"</p>

<p>To my surprise my wife spoke for the first time. She said:
"Yes."</p>

<p>Brancker looked at her keenly and nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes. In any affair between a man and a woman, a man finds
himself at a disadvantage. Mademoiselle, you see, understands.
Women have all kinds of mysterious intuitions and senses which we
wot not of. She is armed at every point. She has more resources.
She is better equipped than man. Sophie even made a friend of
Annabel. She wrote her loving letters and called her 'my dearest.'
For you must know that two years after his marriage my old friend
Terry O'Bane went under. He awakened one night feeling ill; he
groped in a chest where he usually kept a flask of brandy. He took
a gulp. The liquid he drew into his throat was pure liquid ammonia
which Annabel had been using for photographic work. She was a keen
photographer. He rushed out into the street in his pyjamas and died
in the arms of a policeman at the corner."</p>

<p>The horror of this episode was written plainly in the old man's
face. He delivered it with a kind of dramatic despair, as though he
knew it had to be told and he could not control himself. Then he
seemed to fall to pieces, and lay huddled at the back of his chair.
I looked at Alice furtively and I could see a tear swimming on the
brink of her eye. It was some moments before he could continue.</p>

<p>"These were all the best years of my life, mes enfants, when my
powers were at their highest. My old friend Toole offered me a good
part in London. He said to me, 'Brancker, old man, you're wasting
yourself in the provinces. Come to town and take a lead.' I could
only press his hand and thank him. In another week or two I was on
the road again with Sophie. As the years went by she became more
and more absorbed by Terry's unattractive child, and more and more
distressed concerning it. For you must know that in spite of his
profligate life, Terry still had left a considerable fortune, and
Annabel continued to live in the same way. And it was the worst
possible atmosphere to bring a young child up in. Annabel was kind
to the child in a spasmodic way, passionate and unreliable. She
would pet it and coax it, and buy it expensive toys and dresses and
then suddenly neglect or scold it. Sophie knew this, and all the
time she could spare she went to London and tried to help the
situation. She humoured and flattered Annabel, who was quite
manageable if you treated her like this, and she did what she could
to influence the early training of the child for good. But as you
may imagine, the little minx grew up the spit and image of her
mother. She was vain, fickle and spoilt. By the time she was ten
she thought of nothing but her looks and her frocks, and she was
indeed a very pretty child. She all had the prettiness of her
mother, with something of her father's grace and charm. She was
encouraged to amuse the vulgar people who came to the house, and
she was allowed to listen to all the loose talk, and to sit up to
any hour she liked, unless Annabel happened to be in a contrary
mood, when she would slap the child and lock her in her room.</p>

<p>"'Aunt Sophie' as she called her was a favourite with Lucy, but
only, I'm afraid, because 'Aunt Sophie' gave her expensive toys,
and lavished her love persistently upon the child. She wrote to her
nearly every day wherever she happened to be, and sent her little
gifts."</p>

<p>The old man mopped his forehead. He was evidently labouring
under the severe strain which the invoking of these memories put
upon him. He walked to the sideboard and poured himself out a glass
of water, into which he poured&mdash;as an afterthought&mdash;a
tiny drop of rum. After taking two long meditative gulps he resumed
his seat. He seemed to have forgotten all about our presence. He
was living in the past. But suddenly he turned to my wife and
said:</p>

<p>"I have many of the beautiful frocks which Sophie made for
little Lucy. They have come down to me. If it would not bore you to
call one afternoon, mademoiselle, I could show you some that might
interest you." There was a strange eager appeal in his voice. It
seemed a matter of tremendous moment that Alice should go and
inspect the frocks. My heart bled for him. "Of course she will go,"
I thought, but to my surprise she said nothing. She just looked at
him with that queer watchful expression that women alone are
capable of. Perhaps it is part of what the old chap referred
to&mdash;their equipment. She toyed with the chain on her frock and
his eye meditated upon her movements. He hesitated, and then rather
nervously proceeded, as though talking to himself.</p>

<p>"Frocks! What a part they play in our lives. Carlyle was right.
Sophie was extraordinarily clever with her needle. She had a genius
for combining materials. Her theatrical experience helped her. She
made the most alluring frocks. The child adored 'Aunt Sophie's'
frocks, They always looked so striking and so professional. The
crisis in my life, and which I am about to tell you of, was indeed
occasioned by one of the frocks which Sophie made for Lucy. It came
about in this way."</p>

<p>He paused again, and tapped the top of the table with his
beautiful white hands.</p>

<p>"That last year&mdash;that year when Lucy reached her tenth
birthday, the excesses in Annabel's house reached their zenith. The
place became notorious. Annabel had taken to herself a drunken
lord, Lord Starborough. He was a dissipated young rou&eacute;. He
rather took a fancy to Lucy and he spoilt her in the same way that
Annabel did. We heard stories of the goings on. The child was taken
to houses to dance. I believe she was even taught to put on rouge.
There was a rich family called the Arkwrights who also had children
and who had lived a similar life. These children were Lucy's great
friends. They vied with each other in their infantile snobbery. The
parents gave elaborate parties and tried to outshine each other in
the lavishness of their entertainment, and the overdressing of the
children. It was very, very painful. Even I, whose life was being
wrecked by Sophie's adulation of this child, felt sorry. My heart
bled for my old friend's daughter."</p>

<p>"We had a long tour that autumn, Sophie and I. We were out in
'The Woman Who Failed.' Sophie had a lead, but I was only playing
the part of a butler. It was a long and trying tour up North. The
weather was very bitter. There was a good deal of sickness, and our
chief was a hard man. Early in December Sophie caught a cold which
rapidly developed into bronchitis. She had a narrow escape. She
was, however, only out of the bill for ten days. She insisted on
returning and struggling on. The tour was to end on Christmas Eve.
One day she had a letter from Lucy. I remember the exact words to
this day. 'Dear Aunt Sophie, do make me a lovely frock for
Christmas Eve. The Arkwrights are having a lovely ball and I know
Irene is having a gold and green with a sparkling veil. Your loving
Lucy.'</p>

<p>"When Sophie got this letter she smiled. She was happy. She was
always happy when doing a service. Ah me...! For nearly a week she
thought and dreamt about the frock she was going to make for Lucy
for the Arkwrights' party. She knew what the child wanted&mdash;a
frock to outshine all the others. Then another story reached us. I
have forgotten what it was; some distressing record of these
Arkwright people. One night after the show she sent for me. I could
tell she was very agitated. She clutched my arm and said: 'Old man,
I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to make Lucy a frock which
will outshine all the others. And it will be just a plain white
frock with no adornment of any sort. Just think of it, amongst all
those vulgar, overdressed children, one little girl, as pretty as
Lucy&mdash;in plain white. And they will be bound to appreciate it.
It will tell. And perhaps she will realise&mdash;what it means.
Good taste and refinement will always tell against vulgarity.' I
applauded Sophie's idea, and I went with her to get the material.
But she fainted in the shop. During those last few days I began to
realise that Sophie was very ill. She was simply living on her
nervous force, keeping herself going in order to complete the tour,
and to deliver Lucy's frock in time for the ball.</p>

<p>"Our last journey back was from Nottingham. We arrived in London
at five o'clock on Christmas Eve. I was in a fever of dread. I
believed that Sophie was dying. She kept swaying in the train as
though she was going to drop. Her face was deadly white, her eyes
unnaturally bright, and her fingers were still busy on the frock.
So absorbed had I been in Sophie's affairs, I had made no
arrangements about lodgings in town. Neither had she. But my old
friend, Joe Gadgers, seeing my distress, said: 'Old boy, leave it
to me. I know a snug little place where they'll take you in. I'm
not stopping. I'm going straight through to Hastings.' I thanked my
old friend and embraced him. When we got to Euston, we got Sophie
into a four-wheeled cab, and Joe Gadgers came with us to arrange
the introduction. I hardly noticed where the lodgings
were&mdash;somewhere in Clapham, I think. We arrived there and a
good lady took us in without hesitation. We put Sophie to bed. She
was almost delirious, but still the frock was not quite finished.
Joe left us, and I sat by her bedside, watching her busy fingers. I
knew it was useless to protest. The clock on the mantel-piece
ticked and outside the snow was beginning to fall."</p>

<p>Colin Brancker stood up, and suddenly picked up the little white
frock from the back of the chair. He held it in his arms reverently
and tenderly. His voice was strong and resonant. He stood there and
acted the scene vividly before my eyes.</p>

<p>"At ten minutes to seven I left the house holding the frock in
my arms. I rushed out without a hat, without a coat. I flew along
the street, calling out for a cab like a madman...At last I got
one. I told the driver to drive like the furies to the address I
gave him in Kensington. In the cab I stamped my feet and rocked the
dress in my arms as though it were a fevered child. I don't know
how we got there. It seemed an eternity. I flung into the house,
calling out 'Lucy! Lucy!' I found her in the drawing-room. She was
dressed in a flaming orange and silver dress with a sparkling tiara
in her hair. She was looking in a mirror and putting finishing
touches to her hair. She cried out when she saw me: 'Hullo, I
thought Aunt Sophie had forgotten me. I've hired a frock from
Rocos.' 'Child,' I said, 'your Aunt Sophie has been working out her
life's blood for you. Here is the frock!' She grabbed it and
examined it. 'Frock!' she said. 'It looks more like a nightdress. I
don't want the beastly old thing,' and she threw it across the
room. I believe at that moment I could have struck the child. I was
blind with fury. Fortunately, I remembered in time that she was my
old friend Terry O'Bane's daughter. I picked up the frock.
'Ungrateful child!' I exclaimed. 'You don't know what you're doing.
You're murdering an ideal. You're killing your aunt.' She tossed
her insolent head and actually pressed the bell for the butler to
see me out! Just like a grown-up person! Dazed and baffled I
clutched the little white frock and staggered out into the street.
The night was dark, and the snow was still falling. Christmas bells
were beginning to peal...I plunged on and on my heart beating
against my ribs. People stared at me but I was too distressed to
care. How could I go back to Sophie with the insulting message?
Suddenly, at the corner of Hyde Park, a most appalling realisation
flashed through my mind. <i>I had made no note of the address of
the lodgings where Sophie and I were staying!</i>...God in heaven!
What was I to do? The only man who could help me, my old friend,
Joe Gadgers, had gone to Hastings. What could I do? Could I go to
the police and say, 'Will you help me to find the address of some
lodgings where an actress is staying. I think it's somewhere round
about Clapham. I don't know the name of the landlady, or the name
of the street, or the number?' They would have thought I was mad.
Perhaps I was mad. Should I go back to Lucy? The child wouldn't
know...and all this time Sophie was dying. Ah! merciful God!
perhaps she would die. If she died before I found her she would die
in the happy belief that the frock had been worn. Her last hours
would be blessed with dreams, visions of purity and joy...whilst
I...I should have no place in them, perhaps...but I, too, after all
I'd suffered for her sake. Who knows?...Who knows?..."</p>

<p>His voice broke off in a low sob. I leant forward watching his
face, wracked with anguish. The room was extraordinarily still. I
dare not look at Alice, but I was conscious of the pearly sheen of
her frock under the lamp. Away in the distance one could hear the
rumble of the traffic on the High-road. The remorseless tick of the
clock was the only sound in the room. Once I thought it ticked
louder and then I realised that it was someone tapping gently at
the door. The door opened a little way and against the dim light in
the passage appeared the gaunt face of the old serving woman,
phantom like, unreal...</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir." She peered into the room. The old actor gazed
at her with unseeing eyes. He stood with one hand on the back of
the chair, and across the other arm lay the white frock, a
dignified and pathetic figure.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry to trouble you, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Windsor?"</p>

<p>"My little niece 'as just called. I can't find it anywhere. That
little white frock I made for 'er last week. I put it in the chest.
I thought perhaps you might 'ave. Ah! there it is, sir. Do you
mind&mdash;? Thank you very much sir. I'm sorry to have disturbed
the company."</p>

<p>In the sanctuary of our bedroom that night, my wife said:</p>

<p>"Did you really believe that that writing on the photograph was
by Henry Irving?"</p>

<p>"My dear," I answered. "When their careers are finished, the
painter, the author, the architect or the sculptor may point to
this or that and say 'Lo, this is my handiwork.' But to the actor
nothing remains but&mdash;memories. Their permanence lies in the
memories of those who loved them. Are we to begrudge them all the
riches of imagination? After all, what is the line of demarcation
between what we call reality and what we call imagination? Is not
the imagery invoked by Shelley when he sings of dubious myths as
real a fact as the steel rivets in the Forth Bridge? What is
reality? Indeed, what is life?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what life is," answered my wife, switching off the
light. "But I know what you are. You're a dear old, perfect
old&mdash;BOOB!"</p>

<p>"Alice, what do you mean?" I said.</p>

<p>She laughed softly. "Women are 'equipped,' you know," she
replied enigmatically, and insisted on going to sleep.</p>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>33. THE GRAYLES</h2>

<p>Henry Cottesby Grayle was a publisher of architectural and
archaeological books. He was a widower and lived with his son and
two daughters in a small house to which was attached a studio and a
large garden in the neighbourhood of Regents Park.</p>

<p>At the time of which I write the Grayles had become the centre
of a set of people of varying degrees of celebrity in the artistic
and dramatic world and it is perhaps a little difficult to account
for this. They were certainly a very devoted and likeable family,
and the children called their father "Harry." One felt at once
their innate kindness, and their loyal affection for each other,
but the mentality of neither of them was of a very high order, and
I do not remember hearing any one of them express any particularly
original or individual point of view. They were physically
unattractive, having badly proportioned figures and they were all
shortsighted, both the girls, Wanda and Olivia (or "Pan" as we
called her) as well as the father wearing thick glasses. The son,
Arthur, was less shortsighted, he only wore pince-nez for reading,
but he was an awkward looking chap with a head that seemed too
heavy for his shoulders. To say that they were unselfish would be
putting too mild a term to their dominant characteristic. I should
imagine that they were one of the most elaborately unselfish
families that ever existed. They carried this system of
unselfishness to such a degree that it was always defeating its own
end. For instance, Mr. Grayle, who hated the East Coast, would get
an idea into his head that the East Coast was good for the girls,
so he would let fall a hint that he would like to go to the East
Coast for his holidays. Now Wanda and Pan also hated the East
Coast, and a doctor had told Pan that it was bad for her, but they
would pretend that they loved the East Coast, and would not like to
go anywhere else, because they secretly thought that their father
wanted to go there. And Arthur would give up an invitation to go
and stay with friends in Devonshire&mdash;a county that he
adored&mdash;in order to enjoy the dubious benefits of the east
wind, for the same reason. And so neither member of the family
hardly ever got what he or she really wanted, except the
satisfaction of feeling that they had done the right thing. Perhaps
one of the most attractive features of the Grayle establishment was
the tennis court and garden. It was really an excellent court
backed by a dark hedge on three sides, and the garden was
remarkable for London, with a very alluring terrace just above the
tennis court, where tea went on at sporadic intervals from four
o'clock till half-past six. The house was easy of access from any
part of London, and it was very pleasant to pop in there in the
afternoon and to be certain of finding people who were pleased to
see one, and to play tennis and to talk. Besides there was always
an element of surprise at the Grayles, one never knew whom one
would meet. And then there were two extremely pretty girls, and
great friends of Wanda's and Pan's. Their names were Toni and
Mildred Sholt. They were actresses by profession, although they
never by any chance seemed to have an engagement, except to play at
special matinees for some society for the advancement of the Drama,
but they were fluffy companionable girls. They seemed to know every
member of the dramatic profession by some intimate nickname, and
they were always bringing new people to the tennis court. They even
brought two of the Russian dancers from Drury Lane one day, and Guy
Haveling, the famous Comedian, who set everyone in roars of
laughter by his antics when serving.</p>

<p>There seemed an endless procession of girls who were Wanda and
Pan's "dearest friends," there were people who were just beginning
to be talked about, architects, writers, musicians and Pagans of
every description. In the winter, or when the weather was
unpleasant in the summer, we used to go into the studio, and Wanda
and Pan roasted chestnuts and we played most preposterous paper
games, and talked. If the conversation at times became a little
"precious," it had the compensating advantage of being extremely
naive, and often engagingly personal. We were always talking about
each others' characters, and fiercely criticizing each other behind
our backs. This was not done in a spirit of tittle-tattle or
malice. It was pure interest, and a love of analysis.</p>

<p>People began to refer to the "Grayle set," but I am not sure
that the Grayles themselves were the pivots of this set, though
their garden and studio were undoubtedly its headquarters. I'm
afraid many of us used to laugh about the Grayles even on their own
court and in their own studio. In spite of the open house they
kept, and the erratic company that enjoyed their hospitality, they
had peculiar fussy little mannerisms. And they encouraged each
other in these. There were certain things that had always been and
consequently <i>had</i> to be. Arthur had to have porridge with his
breakfast&mdash;although the others never touched it&mdash;and he
had to have a tray of biscuits and anchovy paste and a glass of
lime juice to take up to his bedroom at night. "Harry" must not
under any circumstances be disturbed between the hours of
six-thirty and seven-thirty in the evening, which he spent alone in
the room upstairs. Pan had to have a glass of hot milk at
eleven-fifteen every morning, and always scrambled eggs on toast
for breakfast. Wanda would not touch tea if the milk had been put
in first, and no one would dream of interfering with the tradition
that gave her the right to take the rest of the family to three
lectures at the Royal Society of Arts every year. She had at some
remote period joined this Society, and although the lectures bored
the whole family to death, they would come out chatting gaily, and
persuade each other that the lecture was even more interesting than
the last.</p>

<p>In fine, the family was intensely sentimental. They would not
have acknowledged that, in fact they laughed at and scorned
sentimentality as expressed in sentimental plays and stories. They
simply did not realise that the only difference lay in the fact
that they did not express it. Of course they all kissed each other,
but they never gave expression to any extremely endearing or
emotional terms. But they watched each other with a sort of
furtively erotic zest, they pampered each others' whims, and
silently studied and prophesied each others' desires. The girls
would scheme together to forestall their father's and brother's
wishes, and the father or brother would lie awake at night thinking
how best to please the girls. One shuddered to think of the effect
of the emotionalism of these good people if they had given it
rein.</p>

<p>In addition to the people who came to tennis and tea and supper,
there were invariably people staying in the house, cousins, and
various deserving people working in obscure causes. I remember also
that there was an American woman who was nearly always there. She
rejoiced in the name of Florence Cheesewright Cannifer. She was not
so formidable a person as her name might suggest, in fact she was
delightful. She was broad&mdash;in every sense&mdash;she had broad
shoulders and hips, and a broad low brow and deep set kind grey
eyes. I could never quite locate her, she may have been some sort
of relation. All the family kissed her (including Mr. Grayle) and
they called her "Bee." She was the sort of person that one kissed
automatically. It always surprised me how badly all the Grayles
played tennis, considering they played nearly every day in the
summer and had done so for so long as anyone could remember. This
may have been due largely to their defective eyesight. They were
extremely good at indoor games, being very quick, and all having a
mathematical sense. They had a most bewildering repertoire of games
of all sorts, and they would sit in the studio with all the windows
shut, and the air blue with tobacco smoke, and play games with
frenzied excitement very often till two or three in the
morning.</p>

<p>I need hardly tell you that all of us in the Grayle set were
Socialists, at least when I say Socialists, I mean that we were
people supremely discontented with existing social conditions,
although this discontent manifested itself in different ways. Mr.
Grayle who was a little more inured to these social conditions,
voted Liberal as a sort of compromise, but both the girls and
Arthur belonged to some Socialist organisation in Gray's Inn, and
pursued an active propaganda; the majority of us limited our
activities to the point of sneering at Constitutions, and
monarchies, and politicians, and of adopting an attitude of extreme
superiority to these mundane things.</p>

<p>When the War broke out, the news dropped like a bombshell into
the security of our comfortable ideals. I knew that the Grayles,
with their intense humanitarian instincts, and their hatred of
cruelty in any form, would be upset; but I hardly expected them to
be as affected as they were. On the evening when it was announced
that England had declared war, I found the whole family in the
studio with Florence Cheesewright Cannifer, and the Sholt girls and
a sculptor named Rohan Lees who was supposed to be more or less
engaged to Mildred Sholt. They were sitting round in a circle
immersed in newspapers looking scared and tragic and what surprised
me most&mdash;definitely angry.</p>

<p>"It's detestable!" Wanda was muttering.</p>

<p>"Disgusting patriotism!" Pan ejaculated.</p>

<p>Toni Sholt tried to be facetious but was hushed up, while Rohan
Lees' occasional attempts to sing "Land of Hope and Glory" in
falsetto were received in chilling silence. It is true that later
in the evening we tried to play a game called "Ware Wilkins." It
was a poor game at its best, but on this evening it fell
particularly flat. I forget the rules, but I remember that it was
played with cards and just before you suspected someone of playing
a certain card&mdash;I think it was the Queen of Diamonds&mdash;you
had to call out "Ware Wilkins" and then there were forfeits and so
on. It was a game that Mr. Grayle usually shone at, but on this
occasion he was always at fault, which was deplorable,
in-as-much-as Wanda and Pan had obviously suggested the game to
distract his mind. His mind was not distracted, and he only played
because he imagined that the girls wanted to. The only member of
the family who seemed at all reasonable about it all was Arthur,
who confessed to me on the quiet that he was reserving his
judgement, but at present he had to say that he could hardly see
how Sir Edward Grey could have acted otherwise.</p>

<p>After that it became a sort of understood thing that the War was
a subject not to be discussed in the Grayle family. It was
avoided&mdash;like an unclean thing. Occasionally people would be
brought who did not understand this, and they would launch into
discussions about the War, but they found themselves isolated,
talking in detached groups, and the conversation never became
general.</p>

<p>Certain events which followed were precipitated by the oratory
of a certain Mr. Robson, who appeared at that time. I don't know
where he came from or what his relationship was. He seemed to be a
friend of Mr. Grayle's. He was an elderly man, with a sour
lugubrious countenance and a stoop. He had lived on the East Coast
of Africa for seven years, and had contracted some chronic internal
trouble that doctors agreed was incurable, but he might live for a
long time. He spoke with a deep booming voice like a park-keeper at
closing time. He seemed quite out of his element at the Grayles,
but indifferent to the fact. One got the idea that he would boom on
in that voice, enunciating his unpalatable sophistries, in any
climate or in any society. It made no difference to him if he were
addressing a gang of coloured plate-layers on an African Railway or
a young ladies school on the South Coast. The mere fact of us
calling him <i>Mr.</i> Robson showed that he was not one of us. He
seemed like some vague impersonal force, against which all our most
cherished ideas dashed in vain. One knew of course that the Grayle
family thought about the War. In fact they thought about it too
much, and they each secretly devoured the newspapers. With their
quick intuitions and sympathies they suffered many of the horrors
of the whole thing, only the ambition of each was that the others
should not suffer these horrors. But Mr. Robson had no such
scruples. He boomed on about the War from morning to night. He
might have been Hansard himself doomed to an eternal punishment of
declaiming the redundant products of his volumes. Nothing could
stop him, but occasionally some member of the family or their
friends would flash bitingly across his path, and interject some
facile argument. He would look at them with an expression of
unutterable sadness like one who has lost the faculty of listening
but who deplores any diversion to a prescribed idea, and would then
continue from the point at which he was interrupted.</p>

<p>I remember Arthur telling me one day that any doubts he held
that the War was in any way justifiable were entirely dispelled by
listening to Mr. Robson.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to say," he said, "that the English Government is
any more culpable than the German, probably, it's not. But there's
not much to choose between them. Civilisation is rotten to the
core. The whole thing has been worked by contractors, politicians,
and wire pullers all over the World. This Robson represents the
official mind. You can do nothing with it. It has no fluidity, no
sympathy, no intelligence. It's just an atrophied organ."</p>

<p>It was surprising therefore to hear Arthur that same evening
break a lance with Mr. Robson, and even get angry with him, and he
was vigorously seconded by Wanda and Pan, and in a more
cold-blooded manner by Rohan Lees. No one could ever quite
understand how Mildred Sholt got engaged to Rohan Lees. He was a
queer little chap, and looked rather dirty. He smoked about sixty
cigarettes during the day, was a sort of Art madman. He did
impressionist sculpture that no one could make head or tail of, and
always suggested that his work was the sort of thing that
<i>Rodin</i> was trying to do. For some reason or other Mr. Robson
fixed on Rohan, and suddenly asked him if he weren't going to join
the Army, and do something for his King and Country. Now we all
knew that if Rohan held any political views at all they were
entirely anarchical, and we all laughed. But Rohan took the matter
up, and said: "I tell you what, Robson" (he was the only one of us
who didn't call him <i>Mr.</i> Robson) "I'm an outsider. I never
<i>have</i> done anything conventional or fashionable, why should
I? I don't care a damn about Society. They don't appreciate me or
want me. Well, I mean to stick like it. When it's been fashionable
to go grouse shooting, or go to bridge parties, or play golf, I've
stopped at home and gone on with my work. Now it happens to be the
thing to go out and do a bit of killing or being killed. Well, let
those people who always have to do the right thing, keep on doing
it. I'm going to remain unconventional."</p>

<p>"Do you never consider what you owe to your country? Liberty,
freedom&mdash;Power?"</p>

<p>"Yes," interposed Pan, "or slums, wretchedness, and disgraceful
society inequality?"</p>

<p>"The social system," continued Mr. Robson, "was not invented in
a night by some fiend as some of you young people seem to think. It
is the result of the steady growth of thousands of years, history,
character, environment, the survival of the fittest."</p>

<p>"Of the physically fittest," said Wanda. "It's no good, Mr.
Robson. Nothing can justify War. It's simply a return to the beast
age."</p>

<p>Florence Cheesewright Cannifer took pity on the poor man and
told us we were not to bully him for being a patriot. "It's natural
to love one's country," she said. We all agreed with her, but
protested that one should not love one's country at the expense of
other countries. The discussion took its normal course, that is to
say, round in a circle without leading anywhere, when "Harry"
Grayle came in. I thought he looked tired, and I knew that as a
matter of fact he was a little worried by a newspaper agitation for
conscription. Of course he said nothing about this, but I noticed
him looking narrowly at Arthur, and I believed he was summing up
the physical attributes of his son, and wondering whether he would
pass the Army doctor, if conscription were brought in. There was a
little chap called Skinner who used to come and play tennis
sometimes. I don't know what he was by profession. We used to call
him "Scaly Skinner." I think because he used to get very hot, and
his nose peeled in the summer. Directly the War broke out Scaly
Skinner rushed off and joined something, and was made a Corporal.
We were all very much amused about this, and often laughed about
Corporal Scaly Skinner! When Mr. Grayle came in on this evening, he
told us quietly that he had just heard that "Scaly Skinner" had
been killed. I need hardly say that this news caused a profound
impression. Pan, with genuine tears in her eyes, emphasized her
view that the whole idea of War was more unspeakable and disgusting
than ever, and we all felt that if Mr. Robson said much more we
should jump on him.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, this gentleman said very little more, but
he made one cryptic utterance, that was destined to have a
far-reaching effect. He looked lugubriously round the studio and
sighed, as though he had gathered the full complement of our
idealistic thoughts and then his voice once more boomed forth in
level tones.</p>

<p>"Do you ever realise that you are only allowed to have these
ideas, and to express them, by virtue of the fact that men like
your friend, Mr. Scaly Skinner, are out at the Front fighting for
you and giving their lives for you?"</p>

<p>There was an imperceptible pause, and then Mr. Grayle glancing
at his son, nodded and said&mdash;"That's very true." I believe he
glanced at Arthur apprehensively because he dreaded what effect
this unarguable remark might have on his impressionable son.</p>

<p>He muttered "That's very true," almost automatically because he
realised that it <i>was</i> an abstract truth. It came out before
he had had time to consider the effect. I saw Arthur catch his
father's eye, and take in his pale worried glance, and I know that
in a flash he thought "Father thinks I ought to join. He's too
decent to say so, but he's a little ashamed of me." Incidentally,
too, he thought of Scaly Skinner. It seemed appalling to think of a
chap like Scaly Skinner whom they had all despised, going out and
fighting so that he (Arthur) should be safe at home, and free to
express any views he liked.</p>

<p>I remember very little more of what was said that evening. I
think Florence Cheesewright came to the rescue by talking about
"some dandy ponjee she'd bought that afternoon at a store on Oxford
Street." I know we didn't play any games and we broke up early.</p>

<p>My next intimation of a development in the matter came by way of
a visit from Wanda two days later. She said she and Pan were in
trouble. It was like this. They&mdash;the girls&mdash;had come to
the conclusion that Arthur was worrying. They believed that he felt
a call to join the Army. Of course he was much too unselfish to
worry <i>them</i> about it, and they believed that he thought too
much about their feelings. They didn't think he <i>would</i> join,
simply because he knew how unhappy it would make them. It was very
difficult for them. Of course they simply <i>loathed</i> the idea
of his going, at the same time it would be selfish to impose their
own feelings to such an extent that he acted against his own
conscience and inclination.</p>

<p>I asked them what their father thought, but they said that he
had not spoken, and they should not worry him about it, especially
as there might be nothing in it. I said that if it would be
satisfactory to them, I would sound Arthur and find out what he did
think.</p>

<p>I tackled him the same evening, but he would only talk about
Scaly Skinner. Mr. Robson's remark about Scaly Skinner seemed to
have bitten deep, but I believe he was really thinking more about
his father's glance, and his acquiescence to Mr. Robson's view. I
could only report to Wanda that it <i>did</i> seem as though his
conscience troubled him in the matter. After that the girls, I
thought, behaved very splendidly. In an almost imperceptible manner
they mollified their views. By gentle degrees they allowed that
under certain circumstances War might be possibly justifiable, if
honourably conducted. They listened more leniently to Mr. Robson's
diatribe, and took a more technical interest in the operations on
hand. This change of view was not lost on Arthur. He thought "The
girls think I ought to go." And Mr. Grayle thought "The girls think
Arthur ought to join. It would be selfish of me to interpose."</p>

<p>I do not want to dwell on the heartburnings that went on in the
Grayle family up to that time when Arthur walked down one morning
to a recruiting office in the Strand and offered himself as a
private. I can only say that he joined the Army in the way that he
went to the East Coast, because he somehow believed his family
wished it. Everybody was tremendously surprised that Arthur was
accepted, for he was the most unmilitary looking person you can
imagine. But when it comes to a fine point, one found that there
was nothing really radically wrong with him, and he was fairly
wiry, and occasionally had camped out in August. He was sent first
of all down to a place near Bedford and occasionally got a few
days' leave. The atmosphere of the Grayles house seemed entirely
altered. This was in October, so of course the garden was deserted,
and the girls and "Harry" seemed to prefer the drawing-room or
their bedroom to the studio. Mr. Robson had taken his departure, as
though his mission were fulfilled, and we were at liberty to
scatter the seeds of his moribund philosophy in some other clime.
Florence Cheesewright was still there and I must say that she was
splendid all through that time, mothering the trembling fabrics of
the Grayle family in turn. We never played games and the girls
started their interminable knitting.</p>

<p>They always spoke of Arthur in cheerful voices, but they could
not control their strained faces when one heard the cold rain
driving down on the studio roof on the dark evenings. One
instinctively thought of anchovy biscuits and lime juice, and
wondered how Arthur was faring. When he came home on leave he
looked surprisingly fit, and spoke cheerfully, though he told me on
the quiet that "it was damnable" and that "he was heartily fed up
with it."</p>

<p>On those occasions we always held high revel, and played "Ware,
Wilkins," or some such game in the studio and the Sholt girls came
in and anyone else who got wind of it. I got the impression that
the Grayle family did not desire tremendously to be alone on these
occasions, I think they were a little afraid. It is so much easier
to keep bright and gay when there are others about.</p>

<p>Arthur did not go till April, and I had the doubtful privilege
of being present at his last leave. I must say candidly that it was
awful. It was so horribly strained and unreal. We played games
desperately and talked of most trivial things as though they were
matters of tremendous moment. When it came time for Arthur to go
the only person who was allowed to cry was Florence Cannifer, and
this she did right loyally. He might have been going to post a
letter for all the effusion there was between his family and
himself. They pecked at each other as though they were kissing
through a glass screen, and thought it rather amusing but
impossible. Arthur said "So long, Harry" to his father, and the
latter said "Bye-bye! have you packed that stuff for your
feet?"</p>

<p>They watched him go furtively, hovering amongst each other, and
afraid to look at each others' faces. We went back to the
drawing-room after he had gone, and I talked to Mr. Grayle about
early French renaissance architecture and the girls encouraged me.
I felt that it gave them power to look at their father's face. I
admired old Grayle very much that evening, he controlled himself
amazingly, for I believe he was much more upset than the girls. I
wondered whether at night they all lay shivering apart, but they
undoubtedly showed the traces of anxious dread upon their faces the
next day.</p>

<p>Of course the very thing happened that one would expect to
happen to a family nervously constituted like the Grayles, and it
happened with dramatic suddenness. Arthur had been out there less
than a month, and they had received three letters from him, all
couched in cheery terms. He did not seem to have received any of
the elaborate packages that had been sent, but he was apparently
having the time of his life. And then one day the news came
crashing across the horizon of three strained lives. Arthur was
"missing, believed killed." This is perhaps the most disturbing
news any family can receive, and the Grayles no longer pretended to
ride serenely. They were terribly distraught, and Pan developed an
illness which served the useful purpose of distracting the other
two. It seemed she had been taking sleeping draughts, and had taken
too much. Wanda and her father did not acknowledge that they also
had been in the habit of taking sleeping draughts. But they nursed
Pan assiduously, and Pan kept up her illness as long as possible,
because she saw that it was doing the others good.</p>

<p>A week later a correction appeared in the official
announcements. Previously "missing believed killed" should now read
"wounded, not missing."</p>

<p style="margin-left:10%">MIDDLESUSSEX, 7th (T.F.): GRAYLE, 9093.
A.G.</p>

<p>When I saw the face of old Mr. Grayle reading this correction I
thought that the gods could not have chosen a more unfortunate
victim for their unholy jest. He cried in front of the girls. Of
course the matter only lasted inside a minute but it was the most
terrible minute I ever lived through.</p>

<p>Then they all went to the War Office. They spent ten days there
asking questions of most unlikely people, and making each other
drink copious draughts of hot milk in an A.B.C. in Westminster
Bridge Road. It was a time of great congestion, and they got no
information till they heard that Arthur was back and in a hospital
at Folkestone. The poor chap had been badly wounded and had lost
his right leg below the knee and had a shrapnel wound in his back.
I did not see the Grayles when the news of this arrived, they had
all gone to Folkestone, and there they remained for three months
till Arthur was well enough to be moved. But in the meantime more
surprising news had arrived which was nothing less than that Arthur
had received a D.S.O. or was it a D.C.M.? It was not in any case a
V.C., but it was some high order given in recognition of
conspicuous gallantry in face of the enemy!</p>

<p>The official story was that he held a section of a trench single
handed, when all the other defenders had been killed or wounded for
seven hours, till reinforcements arrived, and thus saved an
important position in the line.</p>

<p>I went down to Folkestone twice and saw Arthur when he was on
the move again. He seemed quite cheerful, and they had fitted him
up with a very nice artificial leg. He seemed disinclined to talk
about his experiences, so I naturally avoided referring to the War.
The family were living in rooms down there, and Mr. Grayle came up
to town twice a week to business. It was not till about two months
later&mdash;when Arthur had been invalided out of the
Army&mdash;and the family were once more back at the house in
Regents Park, that he gave me any intimation that he would care to
talk. We were sitting in his room upstairs after dinner one
evening, and finding him in the mood I asked him if he could tell
me how he won his medal. He puffed at his pipe for a long time and
then he said:</p>

<p>"Honestly my dear chap, I only have the vaguest notion. I knew I
should be frightened, but I never thought it possible to have such
a ghastly fear. When I first came under fire I was
sick&mdash;actually physically sick...I don't remember a bit how
long the whole thing lasted. I blazed away from the trench with my
rifle whenever there was an excuse, it seemed to comfort me. One
felt that one was looking out over the edge of creation and trying
to keep back things that wanted to prove one had never lived. I was
horribly frightened. Believe me, I wasn't thinking of the guvnor or
the girls, I was in a stark staring terror of death and
damnation...For I felt that after this there could be nothing...it
was just pre-neolithic, as though man had never been born, as
though there was nothing...When night came I didn't believe it had
ever been daylight. A shell struck the angle of our trench, four
chaps were blown to nothing, a chap named Rettison&mdash;he was
rather a cad as a matter of fact&mdash;he was smashed up near
me...I felt his blood running over my boots. The trench was
crumbling&mdash;honestly I went mad&mdash;There was a whole bunch
of those damned little things you throw&mdash;you know 'grenades.'
I picked them up one at a time and threw them about...I threw one
at the dead body of Rettison&mdash;I felt I couldn't stand it
there&mdash;if even I saw anything move I flung a grenade. I denied
God and I believe I foamed at the mouth. I may have thrown them at
English or French or anyone&mdash;I should have thrown one at our
Colonel if he had been there&mdash;perhaps I did&mdash;I had lost
all cosmic sense...I was nothing&mdash;just a crumbling negation
waiting for the earth to close up. And then something vital
happened&mdash;I believe I dropped one of the damned things on my
foot...I swung out into a darkness."</p>

<p>Arthur coughed and rolled his pipe round in his mouth. His lips
were trembling in a peculiar way, and I said I thought I heard
someone downstairs calling. I thought it better for us to go, so I
took Arthur's arm, and we found them all in the drawing-room. On a
table there was the medal that Arthur had lately received from the
King. They were looking at it as we came in, and they all looked
round at us. There was a curiously strained moment, in which a
jumble of emotions seemed to vibrate through the room. I did not
know why this should be so, or how much of Arthur's story the
others knew, but it was Florence Cheesewright's suave voice as
usual, with its soothing upward inflection that seemed to relieve
the tension.</p>

<p>"My! what a dandy ribbon!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>34. ARMISTICE</h2>

<p>On the evening of November 10th, 1918, a French officer, in the
pale blue uniform of a Captain of Artillery, was ambling slowly up
and down Little Compton Street. There was about his slow but
watchful movements the air of a man who is being kept waiting. And
such indeed proved to be the case. For after some minutes there
came hurrying in his direction a fellow-countryman, of somewhat
similar build to himself, but in mufti. And the greeting of the
latter was:</p>

<p>"Pardon, my dear Anton! I was detained."</p>

<p>They shook hands with cordiality, and repaired to the
Monaco.</p>

<p>Over glasses of vermouth they carried on the following
conversation in their own language:</p>

<p>"You have heard the news, of course?"</p>

<p>"The Armistice?"</p>

<p>"It is to be signed to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"Thank God! But that I imagine is not the urgent matter you
wished to discuss with me."</p>

<p>"As you say, Max, that is not the matter. But listen, the war is
to all intents and purposes over. Our cause and our country have
claimed four and a half precious years of our lives. During that
time one had no right to claim any consideration for one's own
interests, if they were in any way likely to affect the great
issue. Am I right?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, my dear Anton."</p>

<p>"But now that it is over one may perhaps indulge a little in the
consideration of one's own personal affairs, eh? Passions that
have&mdash;that have slumbered may be assuaged. You remember that
little affair of your own at Chamb&eacute;ry many years ago?"</p>

<p>"With that upstart lieutenant in the Dragoons?"</p>

<p>"I had the honour to be of assistance to you. And at the time
you said&mdash;"</p>

<p>The face of the officer in mufti looked startled.</p>

<p>"My dear Anton, do I understand that you wish to fight a
duel?"</p>

<p>The officer addressed as Anton bowed solemnly.</p>

<p>"Can it be that&mdash;that English officer, Captain Hignett? I
remember you telling me that there had been trouble.
Pauline!...Wasn't that the girl's name?"</p>

<p>"She was my fianc&eacute;e."</p>

<p>"But a duel! My dear old man, the English do not fight duels.
Even in our country it is no longer&mdash;"</p>

<p>Anton rapped his fist down upon the table.</p>

<p>"There shall be a duel even if it is the last one in the story
of the world. A duel, or a thrashing, or a murder."</p>

<p>His eyes rolled, his pale cheeks shook as though with an ague of
passion. It was clear from his restless movements that his nerves
were all on edge. His neck was scarred by the track of a piece of
shrapnel. He was barely thirty-five years of age, but his
close-cropped hair was nearly white. His face was lined and
twisted, like a man who for a generation has been observing the
tortures of the damned.</p>

<p>"I regret this extremely," said his friend.</p>

<p>"You gave me a promise," answered Anton de Thiepval, almost
sullenly.</p>

<p>"Which I shall most assuredly keep, old friend. I only
repeat&mdash;I regret this extremely. The War is over. Let us bury
all animosities."</p>

<p>"There are some things which only cowards and poltroons
bury."</p>

<p>"Come then. Remind me of the details. It was, I think, two years
ago. Things move so rapidly these days. I am myself submerged in
the vibrations of tragedy."</p>

<p>"You will remember, my dear Max, I was liaison officer at that
time attached to the British 97th Division. I was slightly wounded
during the first week of the war and sent to a base hospital at
Rouen. It was there I met Pauline. She was the daughter of an
advocate at Lamballe, an old Breton family. When I met her she was
a ward sister, one of the most beautiful, adorable women who ever
lived. I fell desperately in love, and I had every reason to
believe she reciprocated my affections. But she was a difficult
woman to understand, Max. She made me jealous from the very first.
She loved everyone. At first I thought it was the men, and that she
was flirting with them. In time I came to understand that it was
her way. She had no capacity for flirting at all. She loved
everyone, men, women, children, even dogs. She was lavish with her
affections. And so absorbed was she with her work that you could
safely aver that love with her was a pure abstraction. I ceased to
be jealous, but I told her plainly that I loved her and wanted to
make her my wife. Her answer was always the same. She would
smile&mdash;oh, ever so kindly and murmur: 'We are all mad, Anton.
Wait till this is all over.' I never got anything more satisfactory
out of her than that, but it satisfied me. She could not look at me
as she did and not mean more. I set my mind, like an alarm clock,
against the day when it would all be over. I repeated to myself
again and again: 'We are all mad. But one day we shall be sane, and
Pauline will be my wife.' When I was discharged from the hospital I
was passed as unfit for active service, but owing to my knowledge
of English, I was, as I just told you, appointed liaison officer to
this British division. It was then that I met Captain Hignett. He
was a good-looking man of that lean English kind, reserved but
entirely friendly. He too had been wounded while serving with a
machine-gun company, and was now a transport officer at Amiens. My
work brought me in close touch with him, and we spent many pleasant
days and evenings together. I saw nothing of Pauline, although I
wrote to her regularly. Her replies were brief and perfunctory,
although couched in affectionate terms. I could not complain of
this. I knew the poor girl was worked to death, and the world was
'not yet sane.' A whole year passed. And then one day to my delight
I heard that she was coming to Amiens. She had been very ill, and
her father having some important Government post at Amiens she
joined him there for a brief rest. I need not say that I lost no
time in paying the family my respects. I found Pauline looking pale
and worn, but more adorable than ever. She was surrounded by her
family&mdash;there were two sisters, a cousin, and an aunt in the
household&mdash;so I had great difficulty in getting her by
herself. But when the chestnuts began to bloom along the side of
the canal she would sometimes go there to sit or read, and there I
would pour out my heart to her. She appeared to be in a yielding
mood, and again and again I imagined she was on the point of
succumbing to my entreaties. But it always came back to the same
story&mdash;<i>The World was insane</i>. It was impossible to form
judgments, to do things rationally. In such a mood one might act,
and then live to repent. Men and women were all behaving in a crazy
unbalanced way, eating, drinking, loving, knowing that there might
be no to-morrow. I accepted her attitude as a compliance upon the
terms of the war being over.</p>

<p>"And then one evening, I made my fatal mistake. I took this
Captain Hignett to visit her. I little knew the anguish this was to
bring me. He talked in his quiet voice to the father about fishing
and shooting.</p>

<p>"You know what these English are. You could not tell from his
manner what he was thinking or feeling. He almost seemed to ignore
Pauline. He certainly paid her no compliments, and expressed no
great anxiety to see her again. Walking home from the house he made
no comment about her, or about the family. He talked shop.</p>

<p>"The father, however, had invited him there to dinner the
following Sunday. It was on this occasion that I became aware of
the preoccupation of Pauline. When I was talking to her I observed
her eyes following the stranger....My dear Max, the English are our
good Allies. I do not propose to offer any criticism. But I am
convinced that they and we will never understand each other. This
man embodied in himself the salient characteristics of his race. As
the days passed I could not determine whether the man was a fool or
a consummate actor. He was almost <i>gauche</i> in his attitude
towards Pauline, nor could I get him to speak of her. But I saw him
glance at her once or twice in a way I did not like. It was the
expression of a man either dreaming, mad, or struggling with
temptation. I tried to draw him out by enlarging upon my own love
for Pauline, and he infuriated me with his attitude of detached
patronage. It was as though he could not be bothered with <i>my</i>
troubles, but he had to work some problem out by himself. A week
later I met them walking side by side by the canal, Pauline doing
all the talking, and the Englishman frowning and looking very
solemn. When they saw me coming Pauline looked distinctly
flustered, but Hignett appeared quite unconcerned and he greeted me
as though the position were quite normal. I need hardly say that
after that there was a coldness between us.</p>

<p>"I was of course prepared to concede that this meeting may have
been an accident, but my hopes in this direction were quickly
dissipated. They were seen together day after day. My friends
brought me reports of clandestine meetings. Pauline, I could see,
was profoundly disturbed in my presence. I suspected that she
arranged things so that I could never get her alone. She began to
adopt towards me that attitude which every lover detests, the
attitude of sisterly pity. I consoled myself with the memory of her
reflection that the world was not sane. I felt convinced that she
would do nothing until the war was over, and then we should all
meet on equal ground. Hignett had the advantage of me in that he
was stationed at Amiens. My duties called me all over the place,
and I was away for days and weeks at a time. But my rage at the
perfidy of this Englishman was beginning to reach boiling-point.
One day I was under orders to go to the other end of the line, and
I knew that I should probably be away for months.</p>

<p>"The night before I left I met Captain Hignett in the street.
After a formal greeting I told him I was going and I said sternly:
'Captain Hignett, you have an English expression&mdash;<i>It isn't
done!</i> I would ask you to ponder that carefully in relation to
your actions.' He looked surprised, then answered coolly: 'I'm not
conscious of doing, or being about to do, anything dishonourable.'
I replied: 'Very good! I trust to your honour as an officer and a
gentleman,' and I turned on my heel.</p>

<p>"Barely a month passed, Max, barely a month, when the whole
world came tumbling about my ears. I was at Bapaume when a friend
sent me the soul-destroying news. One of my sources of comfort had
been that a few days after my departure Pauline was due to return
to Rouen. Now came the news that instead of going to Rouen she had
gone to England with Hignett. She had married him at Amiens. I
cannot tell you what I suffered. I tried to be sent back to the
firing line. I craved for death, extinction. I was only sustained
by the slumbering passions of revenge. My soul raged with blind
anger against this perfidious traitor and the woman who said that
such a thing as marriage was not to be considered 'till the world
was sane.'</p>

<p>"Sane! God in heaven! Was I sane? Was Pauline sane? Or was this
a prankish reaction to the world insanity? I couldn't sleep. My
thoughts were poisoned. I had never had a fair chance. While my
back was turned this cool snake had crept in and robbed the nest
that should have been my future home. I developed a fever, and
spent many months lying on my back, raging against Fate and the
universe. When I recovered I promised myself that when the world
was sane again I would shock its smugness with my insanity.
Honestly, old friend, I nurtured the darkest inclinations in my
heart. I understood how men have been driven to the last extremity
of the <i>crime passionelle</i>. It has only been by reminding
myself constantly that I am an officer, and that this treacherous
friend wears the uniform of an officer of an allied race, that I am
able to force myself to give him the opportunity of
satisfaction."</p>

<p>Max regarded his empty glass thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"You are fully determined, then, to see this thing through?"</p>

<p>"But yes."</p>

<p>"And you demand my assistance?"</p>

<p>"As you say."</p>

<p>"And when is this&mdash;this challenge to be delivered?"</p>

<p>"To-night, my friend. We go straight from here."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>In the library of a square-brick house, with its lawns sloping
down to the river, at Teddington, a tall slim young man was sorting
out a collection of army forms. His clear grey eyes were alight
with eagerness. He had just heard the news on the telephone of the
probable Armistice on the morrow, and he hummed gaily to himself at
his work. After some minutes he rang the bell, and an ancient
butler entered. He looked up and said:</p>

<p>"Ah, Mason! I'm expecting a friend to-night to dinner. An
American gentleman, Lieutenant Frazier Brandt. He may be here at
any moment. Show him in."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"What time did my wife say she would be home?"</p>

<p>"Madame said she might be a little late, sir. About eight
o'clock. Shopping, I think, sir."</p>

<p>"Very good. How is my father to-day?"</p>

<p>"The General is pretty well, thank you, sir."</p>

<p>Mason had been in the family thirty-five years, and he adopted a
proprietary interest in his master, even when the solicitude came
from the son.</p>

<p>"All right, Mason, thank you. Show Lieutenant Brandt in when he
comes."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>When the butler retired the young man continued to sort his
papers, but his manner was restless and preoccupied. Armistice! The
war over! Pauline! Thank God! Plans and anticipations jostled each
other in a joyous riot. He would be able to resign, to return to
civil life. He would be able to take his wife for a real honeymoon
at last. Italy, Algeria, Egypt! Then they would return and he would
go back to scientific research, and they would start that wonderful
home they had dreamed of and planned during the last years of
horror and suspense. Home, security, Pauline, children! It seemed
too wonderful to be true!...</p>

<p>Nearly half an hour passed amid these pleasant reveries when the
butler re-entered and announced:</p>

<p>"Mr. Frazier Brandt."</p>

<p>A thick-set young American in officer's uniform swung into the
room and gripped his hand:</p>

<p>"Why, Hignett, I'm mighty pleased to see you. How are you?"</p>

<p>"Fine, and how are you, Brandt?"</p>

<p>"Bully. I had some little difficulty finding this place."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's my father's house, you know. He's a widower, lives
here with odds and ends of relatives. Pauline and I are just
camping here till we can find a place of our own."</p>

<p>"Well, that's fine. I'm real glad to see you, Hignett. You've
heard the news, of course?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they're signing to-morrow, I'm told."</p>

<p>"Gosh! Isn't it wonderful? I just can't realise it. All the boys
getting away back home. No more of these ghastly horrors, broken
homes, broken limbs. Fancy being just a free man again, Hignett,
and feeling you can do and act like a human being. I feel just
crazy."</p>

<p>"I know. I shall go crazy to-morrow myself if it comes off. One
has got so used to it one simply can't believe that there can ever
be the old life again. Where and when do you think you'll be going,
Brandt? I don't believe you ever told me anything about your
people, when we met in Paris."</p>

<p>"I have a wife and three kiddies and an old mother and two
sisters, waiting for me in the little burg of Trenton, and I am
going to get right back on the first boat I can crowd on to going
west. Oh, it's great; it's fine! Golly! there's some good times
coming to us yet, Hignett!"</p>

<p>Hignett stood up and laughed, and the two young men banged each
other on the shoulder in sheer exuberance. They had met by pure
chance at a cabaret in Paris, and had formed one of those quick war
friendships, which in some cases lasted a lifetime.</p>

<p>"I'm just crazy to meet your missus," said Brandt.</p>

<p>"I'm crazy to show her to you," replied Hignett, and he pointed
at a photograph in a silver frame. "She'll be home to dinner about
eight."</p>

<p>"My! that's fine," said Brandt, examining the photo. "It makes
me feel real home-sick. Gosh! She's a peach&mdash;French, isn't
she?"</p>

<p>Hignett nodded.</p>

<p>"I met her at Amiens. She's one of the best, Brandt. Poor child!
It hasn't been much of a married life for her so far. But if the
Boche signs to-morrow we'll be able to make all that up."</p>

<p>He was holding the photograph in his hand when there was another
tap on the door, and Mason entered. He was carrying two visiting
cards on a tray. He approached Hignett and said:</p>

<p>"These two gentlemen wish to see you, sir."</p>

<p>Hignett picked up the cards, examined them, and looked a little
puzzled. Then he said quickly:</p>

<p>"Show them in, Mason."</p>

<p>When the butler had withdrawn he murmured:</p>

<p>"Anton de Thiepval! That's a queer thing, Brandt. This was the
very chap who introduced me to Pauline. I didn't think he was
friendly with me. I believe he was very keen on Pauline himself. I
didn't get the whole story from her. I know he had been hanging
about a lot. I know she liked him to a certain extent at one time.
It's difficult to understand Frenchmen when it comes to their
relations with women. You never can quite get the hang of how much
they mean. They protest so much that their affairs are apt to lose
all sense of proportion&mdash;"</p>

<p>The events of the next two minutes were so sudden and so
astounding, that Brandt would be likely to remember them all his
days. He saw the butler enter, announce two names, and retire. On
his heels followed two very intense-looking men, one in the pale
blue uniform of a French artillery officer. He heard Hignett
exclaim:</p>

<p>"Hullo, de Thiepval!"</p>

<p>The next moment without a word of warning he saw the French
officer give his friend a sharp rap across the face with an open
glove. He exclaimed, "Gosh!" and sprang forward as though to come
to his assistance. He felt Hignett's hand grip his forearm. He
could tell by the latter's tense face and clenched fists that his
instincts were the same as his own, but his startled expression
seemed to be struggling to focus the amazing situation, and in some
manner to keep it under control. He stood very erect, and merely
muttered:</p>

<p>"This is my father's house."</p>

<p>The two Frenchmen were obviously waiting for him to make some
further move.</p>

<p>After a momentary hesitation, he said quite calmly:</p>

<p>"May I ask, de Thiepval, what is the meaning of this&mdash;this
unexpected attention?"</p>

<p>With a dramatic gesture de Thiepval declaimed:</p>

<p>"You are posturing, Captain Hignett. You know quite well you
betrayed my trust in your honour. While my duties called me away to
serve my fatherland, you ran off with the woman who was affianced
to me!"</p>

<p>"Pauline was never affianced to you to my knowledge."</p>

<p>"You lie! I loved her. She told me to wait till the war was
over, <i>till the world was sane</i>. I trusted her. I trusted you.
If the world was insane for me it was insane for you."</p>

<p>"Love, so far as I may judge, is not dependent upon any degree
of sanity or insanity of an outside world...I am sorry you take it
like this, de Thiepval. It was an open field."</p>

<p>"It was not an open field. You crawled in whilst my back was
turned! You are, in your own language, a dirty traitor."</p>

<p>"I must ask you to withdraw that statement."</p>

<p>The other officer then stepped into the breach.</p>

<p>"I would draw your attention, Captain Hignett, to the fact that
you have been insulted by my friend, Captain de Thiepval."</p>

<p>"I am vividly aware of that, Major Fougeret. And I deplore the
fact that your friend should have thought it necessary to behave in
this manner here, in my father's house. If he wants any kind of a
rough house there are other places&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Goody!" exclaimed Brandt suddenly. "You see what he's after,
Hignett? He wants to fight a duel."</p>

<p>This, surprisingly enough, had not so far occurred to Hignett.
His expression was one almost of angry disgust. The situation
seemed to him a little ludicrous, like a scene from an
<i>op&eacute;ra-bouffe</i>. People don't fight duels these days.
Controlling himself as well as he could, he said:</p>

<p>"This is absurd. You have no right to come here and behave in
this ridiculous fashion. If this were my house I'd kick you out.
But my father upstairs is old and an invalid. If you wish to be
rude to me please do it outside, or anywhere you like to
choose."</p>

<p>Fougeret bowed.</p>

<p>"I regard this, then, as an acceptance of my friend's challenge.
May I assume that this gentleman here will act for you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, come now," said Brandt, in his heavy paternal voice, "let's
cut all this out. To-morrow there's to be peace. Surely there's
been enough blood-letting these last four years. Why can't you boys
pull yourselves together? I'm sure my friend, Hignett, wouldn't
play any underhand games. He's a gentleman. My view is that there
was an open field for the hand of Mrs. Hignett and you didn't just
happen to pull it off, Captain. Hignett won and that's all there is
to it."</p>

<p>"He won while my back was turned."</p>

<p>Fougeret turned towards Hignett, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"This is an affair in which my friend's honour is at stake. I
shall be glad to know what you propose to do about it."</p>

<p>Hignett was still maintaining his puzzled, rather contemptuous
attitude. He spoke testily.</p>

<p>"The whole thing is childish. I have no intention of fighting a
duel."</p>

<p>The face of de Thiepval turned a shade paler. He said
acidly:</p>

<p>"After these four years during which England and France have
been allies it pains me to have to call an English officer a
coward!"</p>

<p>Hignett was patently uncertain how to act. His face was
beginning to flush with anger, which he was at pains to control. At
the same time his feelings appeared to be more bewildered by the
unexpected outrage than profoundly stirred. Secure in his own sense
of rectitude in the matter, conscious of the completeness of his
triumph, absorbed in his own happiness, he could not but harbour a
sneaking pity for de Thiepval.</p>

<p>As he hesitated, de Thiepval suddenly stepped forward and spat
upon his uniform!</p>

<p>The face of Hignett underwent a strange transformation.
Bewilderment, hesitation and forbearance vanished, nothing seemed
to be left but the hard, cold anger of the fighting man. He turned
to Brandt and said:</p>

<p>"Brandt, I think you understand the situation. I leave it to you
to settle the details with Captain de Thiepval's friend. When you
have done so, will you kindly ring the bell. The butler will show
these gentlemen out."</p>

<p>With that he walked deliberately out of the room, closing the
door very quietly after him.</p>

<p>Brandt was dumbfounded. When he had trundled out in a taxi to
this dull-looking house at Teddington, he little expected to be
suddenly whirled into the midst of a deplorable tragedy. He felt as
though he had been chloroformed and awakened to find himself
trajected across the centuries, or taking part in the sham
posturing of a film. With Hignett absent he felt his powers of
protestation to be useless. He listened attentively to the incisive
suggestions of Fougeret.</p>

<p>One memory jumped vividly to the forefront of his mind. Whilst
in Paris he and Hignett had visited a "Tir des Pigeons." He had
discovered that his friend was a deadly shot with a revolver. He
promptly rejected Fougeret's suggestion of sabres or
&eacute;p&eacute;es. For all he knew, Hignett had never handled
"the darn things." He found himself making arrangements concerning
duelling pistols for dawn near a small village in the pas de
Calais, the affair to take place two days later. He made a note of
the details. After the officers had gone, he sought for Hignett,
but the butler told him he was upstairs "reading to the general."
It was half an hour before he came down. Brandt met him on the
staircase.</p>

<p>"Gosh, Hignett," he said, "why did you do it?"</p>

<p>"He spat on the King's uniform," replied Hignett quietly.
"Listen, I hear my wife. Come on downstairs and I'll introduce you
to her."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>At eleven o'clock precisely the maroons went off. The King and
Queen came out on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. A massed band
of the Guards played "Land of Hope and Glory" in the courtyard
below. The great concourse, which had already assembled, cheered.
But their cheers had not the fervour and the frenzy which was to be
their character later in the day. Drugged by the misery of four and
a half years of war, the people appeared to regard this
manifestation as one further episode in the story. They had not yet
grasped the full significance of it. There was nothing about the
familiar figures of their King and Queen, or the grey coats of the
Guards, or the drab, characterless November sky, to suggest that
this was one of the most momentous days in history. Nevertheless,
the forecourt of Buckingham Palace remained throughout the day the
pivot of the people's activities. From that hour they began to
stream in the direction of the Palace, as though the news they had
received by word of mouth, or in the newspapers, required some kind
of material confirmation. When they had seen the King and Queen, or
heard the solemn melodies played by the Guards, they turned to each
other and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"My God, it's all over!"</p>

<p>And they went away with light hearts. By twelve o'clock the
crowd was so dense that no traffic could get within half a mile of
the Palace gates. And what a strange traffic it was! Every
conceivable kind of motor and horse vehicle merged to this centre,
weighted down by indiscriminate humanity. At the stupendous
realisation all social barriers snapped. Every vehicle was a public
conveyance, restricted only by its cubic capacity. By midday the
countless millions began to roar themselves hoarse in frenzied
yells&mdash;of relief. For it may be said that throughout that day
there was one simple emotion which stirred the multitude as though
it were a unit, the emotion of intense relief. There existed no
spirit of triumph, malice, recrimination&mdash;there was indeed
little interest in the terms of the pact&mdash;there was only one
thought expressed in the common formula of the day:</p>

<p>"Thank God, it's over!"</p>

<p>Having completed his business at the War Office, Hignett was one
of the early arrivals outside the Palace gates. He too was not so
far deeply affected by the significance of the affair. He was still
shaken and exasperated by the events of the previous evening, still
dominated by the claims of his personal preoccupations. His anger
and disgust were being slowly penetrated by a greater disquiet. The
previous evening's contretemps appeared so foolish, so unnecessary.
The days that he had been living for, the days when he was to
devote himself to Pauline, and to realise their united dream of
happiness, were abruptly jeopardised at the very last moment. To
have survived that awful war and then perhaps to fall to a bullet
in a foolish quarrel! Or even to kill the other man!...And he could
not tell his wife. She would not understand. And somehow it did not
seem quite fair to her.</p>

<p>He wandered down the Mall, watching the crowd. In spite of
himself its exuberant quality began to excite him. He saw officers
and privates walking arm in arm, veteran "brass-hats" lying back in
their cars surrounded by screaming little munition girls, waving
flags. Flags seemed to spring up from everywhere. And the most
surprising and un-English attitude was that everyone was talking to
everyone else. All class distinctions had vanished; and not only
were they talking, they were talking excitedly, and laughing,
cheering, and singing, and even embracing each other.</p>

<p>He had appointed to meet Pauline, Frazier Brandt, and two women
friends of Pauline for lunch at the Barbarotti restaurant on the
Embankment, and he arrived there well before his time. It was the
natural instinct to share the magic of this hour with those one
loved. The gay restaurant was already crowded with cheering people,
the band was playing, and excited couples were dancing between the
tables. New-comers were greeted with shouts of "Hurrah! hurrah!" as
though by their presence they were contributing to the
entertainment of this wonderful experience. Frazier Brandt was the
first to appear, with two other American officers, whose names
Hignett did not catch&mdash;Brandt made some light-hearted apology
for bringing them. One of them was an exceptionally tall man in
uniform, but wearing a shiny black topper, which he had purloined
from somewhere, and which he insisted on wearing all through lunch.
Pauline arrived with an even larger party, some of whom were quite
unknown to her. As the restaurant was so crowded, they all had to
sit where they could. But their party was quickly absorbed into the
larger party. There was in effect only one party, but Hignett,
Pauline and Brandt managed to sit at the same table.</p>

<p>They drank champagne, not that they needed stimulant, but
because champagne seemed the appropriate symbol of festivity, and
their eyes shone as though with the lustre of revelation. They
toasted each other, and life, and men, and strangers and even
ideas. Suddenly two of them would rise and dance, or grip the hands
of strangers.</p>

<p>At their table sat Dr. Caswell, the well-known osteopath, an
elderly man with horn-rimmed spectacles and the manners of a
judge.</p>

<p>"Watch them, Hignett," he said between the courses. "The
readjustment of the rhythm of life has already begun. It is a
notorious fact that after any such great upheaval the primary
instinct of every people is to dance. For years now everyone will
be dancing mad. When the street-bells have been jangled, out of
tune and harsh, and all the ordered rhythms blown to pieces, the
vital energy that survives instantly starts to re-establish the
rhythms. War is a cacophony, but life is rhythm."</p>

<p>The tables were cleared, but the dancing went on. Some went and
others came. They wanted to be everywhere at once, to meet old
friends and to make new ones, to feel the warm vibration of human
life around them, to know that everyone regarded his
fellow-creature as a friend. Hignett was dancing with his wife,
their bodies swaying in perfect unison. Suddenly he thought:</p>

<p>"Rhythm!...rhythm! and in twenty-four hours I may be dead."</p>

<p>"Darling," she whispered, "let's ask them all out to Teddington
to-night. Everyone. Let us make what you call&mdash;a night of
it."</p>

<p>To-night? Well, why not? There was no reason why one shouldn't
dance <i>to-night</i>. "Make a night of it!" By all means. Ask
everyone. Light up the old hall with youth and gaiety, and let his
old father rejoice in the sight.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Pauline, you are a genius! We will ask them all."</p>

<p>Hignett was seated talking to Pauline, who was breathlessly
discussing the arrangements for the evening, when he was startled
by the abrupt approach of two figures towards the table. It was de
Thiepval and his friend! De Thiepval's eyes were glowing with a
strange light. He appeared to be on the point of tears. Hignett
jumped up, but the French officer gave him a ceremonious bow, then
turning to Pauline, he took her hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>"Madame," he said, and his voice was hoarse with emotion, "you
once said to me, 'When the world was sane.' Now...now I understand
you."</p>

<p>Then he turned to Hignett and held out both his arms.</p>

<p>"Captain, forgive me. I have&mdash;I have seen a people
<i>sane</i>. Everything false suddenly falls away from me. Madame
was right, and I was wrong. I cannot&mdash;I cannot&mdash;you
understand&mdash;forgive me for my rudeness&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hignett felt a lump come into his throat. For a moment he could
not speak. Then he took the other's hand in a firm grasp, patted
his shoulders, and said in that shy English manner:</p>

<p>"My dear chap!"</p>

<p>There was something childlike and a little pathetic about de
Thiepval as he bravely tried to control his tears.</p>

<p>"I did not know&mdash;I did not think&mdash;there could ever be
such a day, such a spirit. One sees everything clearly."</p>

<p>Frazier Brandt had been watching this reconciliation. He
suddenly put his arm around the Frenchman and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"De Thiepval, old man, that's fine! Come and have a drink with
us, and your friend too. I've forgotten his name. I'm a little
drunk, as a matter of fact. Put it there. We're all friends
now&mdash;eh? No more wars, no more troubles, all good
friends&mdash;eh? Waiter, another bottle of Pol Roger."</p>

<p>The wine was brought, and the toasts started again.</p>

<p>"To France! To England! To America!"</p>

<p>"How will they be feeling in Berlin?"</p>

<p>"Relieved I should think. Poor devils!"</p>

<p>"Poor devils!"</p>

<p>Pauline suddenly stood up, her beautiful eyes aglow. She raised
her glass to the two Frenchmen.</p>

<p>"My dear Anton, my dear Max, you must both come to-night to
Teddington. We make a night of it."</p>

<p>"Teddington! But how&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There are no 'hows.' There is Dr. Caswell's car, and some
taxis, or munition vans. One gets there. Then one either gets back
or does not get back. There are beds and shake-downs, and sofas,
and some food, and much dancing, and all goodwill, and love, and
friendship. Anyone who says he is my friend comes back to
Teddington, if only to prove that the world is sane. Will you come,
Anton?"</p>

<p>De Thiepval bowed solemnly.</p>

<p>"Whatever the goddess decrees."</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The impromptu party arranged by Pauline on Armistice night at
General Hignett's house at Teddington consisted of about
thirty-five people, of whom no less than fifteen stayed the night.
The telephone was kept busy, and the guests came and went in
bewildering fashion. The old general himself dressed and came down,
even donning his Boer War medals. He did not join the party at
dinner, but he appeared soon after for a short period, and insisted
upon being presented to the young officers, to each of whom he made
a ceremonious little speech, formally thanking them for their
services to the allied cause. The irresponsible gaiety of the
evening seemed to puzzle him a little.</p>

<p>A gramophone was already emitting the strains of a foxtrot, and
with it the glamour of Armistice Day seemed to take on renewed
life. Young men and young women, strong of body and keen of mind,
and the gloomy menace of four and a half years abruptly removed by
the stroke of a pen! To be free to make one's life as one desired!
How simple seemed the claims of personal love and personal success
unhampered by the grinding machinery of State control!</p>

<p>The young people glanced over their shoulders to admire the
wonderful diamonds of Madame Beneventuros. She was the wife of an
Argentine senator and cattle king. Her diamonds were famous.
Hignett had met her husband over Government business, and as
Beneventuros had to go to Barcelona for a few days on family
affairs, he and Pauline had asked Madame Beneventuros to stay with
them. These gleaming gems seemed symbolic of the unexplored riches
of this newly awakened world.</p>

<p>De Thiepval had quickly succumbed to the spirit of the day. His
jealousy had evaporated. His spirits were as gay as they had
formerly been morose. He danced with Pauline, and in a quiet corner
of the hall spoke freely of the quarrel and of his contrition.</p>

<p>By midnight Frazier Brandt was garrulous. He had drunk more
champagne than he was accustomed to, and the result had heightened
his natural bias towards kindliness, good-fellowship, and universal
love. He was disposed to embrace everyone, men and women alike, and
tell them what fine and noble specimens of humanity they were.
There had been a halt in the evening's activities, and the whole
company had reassembled in the dining-room, where more drinks and
sandwiches were being served. It was at this moment that his
garrulousness received an inspiration. He got on to his legs and
made a speech.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, I love you all. This is the greatest day
in the history of the world. The greatest day, believe me. You will
come to know it and look back on it. What we have to do, my good
friends, is to keep it up. Keep up Armistice Day for ever, and
ever, and ever. D'you get me? And it's not only in the big things,
it's in the little things. Armistice Day! No more wars, no more
envy, jealousy or malice. No more petty quarrels. Just all good
friends, free...free men, free women, loving one another. Now I'm
going to put across a proposition. All of us in this room, we've
determined there's going to be no more war, no more bloodshed.
There was very nearly&mdash;no, I can't tell you, it's a personal
affair; anyway, I guess it's not up to me to talk about it. But,
listen, I want to suggest that right here and now all we officers,
and any others of you who've got guns, stilettos, or any other
implements, put the whole lot into a sack, and that we then proceed
down the garden to the boat-house and solemnly commit the whole
kiboosh to the bosom of your ancient River Thames. And we make a
prayer and say:</p>

<p>"'Oh, Thames, here is our burnt-offering. See to it that there
is no more war, no more strife, but that henceforth all men live in
peace and goodwill towards each other.'"</p>

<p>Brandt's speech somehow fitted into the mood of the party.
Everyone laughed, clapped, or cheered. Hignett was specially
enthusiastic, although he was laughing too. A sheet was procured,
and every man who had a weapon of any sort deposited it in the
heap, which was then tied up. Then the whole party, including the
women, some in overcoats and mackintoshes, and some even carrying
umbrellas, formed into a procession, and, to the strains of "The
Marseillaise," played on combs and whistled, they marched down to
the boathause. Hignett took the bundle, and, leaning over the edge
of the platform, he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, Father Thames, at the inspiration of our bright young
friend from America we commit this bundle to your keeping. We are
fed up to the teeth with war and strife, and envy and jealousy. We
pray you see to it that these things never happen again. Let the
world remain free, and simple, and pure in heart as it has been on
this Armistice Day. Amen!"</p>

<p>The bundle went plomp into the dark waters. The action produced
on the whole company an almost involuntary effect of awe, then they
turned and marched solemnly back to the house to the strains of
"Land of Hope and Glory."...And still the dance went on.</p>

<p>Sometimes they would break up into little groups and talk, but
for the most part dancing held sway.</p>

<p>Madame Beneventuros retired at half-past one.</p>

<p>It was not until nearly 3.30 that the rest of the party, with
final embraces and benedictions, eventually retired to their
various shake-downs and sleeping quarters, and it was not until
they lay down that each member realised his or her extreme fatigue.
For within a quarter of an hour or so all were in profound
sleep.</p>

<p>In order to follow the amazing event which happened within the
next hour and a half it is necessary to visualise roughly the plan
of the ground floor of General Hignett's house.</p>

<p>The main entrance door, which was in the centre, led into a
small vestibule, serving no other purpose than that of a buffer
between the front door and the lobby which led into the large
central hall. This lobby was about fifteen feet long and eight feet
wide, and had one door leading into a cloak-room on the right. The
other rooms on this floor, the dining-room and the L-shaped
drawing-room on the west side and the library and billiard-room on
the east side, all had doors leading into the central hall. In line
with the entrance door and the lobby was a staircase which led up
to a balcony on the north side, overlooking the hall. On the west
side, but separated from the main balcony, and entered by a
separate staircase, was another small section of balcony. This was
the part occupied by the General and his personal servants. The
only three guests sleeping on the ground floor were the two French
officers in the library, and an American&mdash;the same who had
paraded the streets of London in a topper&mdash;who was comfortably
ensconced on a lounge in the billiard-room. All the others were
scattered in various rooms upstairs or above the garage.</p>

<p>By half-past four the whole household was in a profound sleep,
with the possible exception of Hignett, whose mind was still
semi-active with the events of the extraordinary day. He was half
dreaming&mdash;pleasant riotous dreams interlarded with airs of
foxtrots and jumbled phrases, and a sense of the promise of some
newly awakened happiness. When suddenly the penumbra of his mind
was pierced by a loud scream. He jumped out of bed and ran to the
door. The balcony and hall were in complete darkness, but he was
vaguely conscious of movement. There was the sound of a banging
door, a rustle, and a dim vision of something white, and then,
pitched on an hysterical note, the voice of Madame
Beneventuros:</p>

<p>"He's got my diamonds!"</p>

<p>He called out at random. "All right, Madame!" and groped for the
switch. For some moments he could not find it. During that interval
he heard the louder screams of Madame Beneventuros, and the opening
of other doors, and voices calling out:</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>When he got to the switch it only lighted the balcony, the
switch for the hall being below. The hall, however, was dimly
visible. He saw two figures, one lurking by the lobby entrance, the
other hurrying across the hall. They were both masked.</p>

<p>Hignett's mind came out of its torpid condition with a violent
jerk. A crowd of small facts impressed themselves upon him at the
same instant. One salient feature was that the men were armed, for
he saw the tall American standing by the billiard-room door,
holding up his hands. He was covered by the revolver of the man
from the lobby. He could also hear the muffled throb of an
automobile engine outside the front porch. The other man was moving
with professional deftness in the direction of a cabinet that held
some gold plate and gems. He hardly appeared to be in a hurry.</p>

<p>"This is a carefully arranged plot by highly skilled expert
thieves. They came for the diamonds of Madame Beneventuros, but
this gentleman thinks he might have a few extras as well. We'll
see&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hignett made an instinctive spring on to the staircase, and an
equally instinctive spring back, for a bullet grazed his elbow. He
scrambled towards his bedroom only to bump into Pauline.</p>

<p>"Get back, darling, get back! It's all right," he said, and then
uttered a curse. He had gone back to the bedroom for his revolver.
And suddenly the ironic truth struck him. Every single weapon of
defence had been consigned to the gentle care of "Father Thames"!
Of all those men in the house, not one had a weapon. These men must
have been watching their every movement. It was a damnable
situation. He heard other cries and screams, and crept back to the
balcony. Quite a number of men were there in dressing-gowns and
pyjamas, all helpless! For one of the thieves had his revolver
covering the whole scene of operations, whilst the other calmly
began to remove the contents of the cabinet into a large black bag.
And then in a flash the whole bizarre business had reached a crisis
of tragedy.</p>

<p>Without observing how she got there, Hignett suddenly observed
Pauline at the foot of the stairs rushing in the direction of the
thief and crying out, "No, no!"</p>

<p>He sensed in an instant the cause of her onset. In the cabinet
were the jewels and little trinkets which had belonged to her
mother and which had been temporarily placed there. His heart gave
a throb of dread as he rushed after her. He sprang down the stairs
in two bounds, but even that was not quick enough to avert the
tragedy. The one thief continued to pack, but the other fired, and
the bullet went clean through the heart of&mdash;de Thiepval!</p>

<p>The French officer had made a spring from the library door!
Hignett caught Pauline in his arms and turned, and as he did so he
was aware of a new element in the conflict. For there was the ping
of a rifle-shot followed by a scream of pain from the man who had
fired. In spite of the danger of his position with his beloved
burden, Hignett could not help but turn, and the truth became
evident to him at a glance. Up in his own section of balcony the
General was busy with an old Lee-Metford rifle, such as was used
during the Boer War. He was taking cover behind the projections in
the balustrade, and calmly proceeding to snipe the enemy.</p>

<p>At this unexpected onslaught both the marauders dashed into the
lobby and through the front door, each leaving a trail of blood. A
car was heard to start. They had the diamonds, it was true, but
little else, and each was wounded. Some of the men rushed after
them, others hastened to the telephone. The police were informed
and a doctor sent for, although all knew, alas! that the doctor's
services were a mere matter of form. De Thiepval had died in the
gallant way that he would have chosen. They placed his body in one
of the bedrooms and, setting two candles, Pauline, weeping a
little, knelt and prayed for his soul...With the raw light of dawn
came the news that the thieves had been captured, and a bedraggled
company met over tea and coffee and rolls and discussed the night's
adventure.</p>

<p>The old gentleman had been badly shaken, but he insisted that he
wished to see all the young officers and speak to them.</p>

<p>"It's an order from G.H.Q.," said Hignett, shrugging his
shoulders, and he went upstairs, the others following him. The old
man was sitting up in his bed; his eyes were very bright, and his
lips moving jerkily. The men stood around the bed, and he looked at
them, nodded and smiled. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Where is that other young Frenchman?"</p>

<p>Hignett coughed. "He&mdash;he fell in the conflict, sir."</p>

<p>The old General nodded slowly. Almost inaudibly, as if talking
to himself, he suddenly said:</p>

<p>"You young men!..."</p>

<p>Then he raised himself and called out as though it were a
military command:</p>

<p>"The strong man may lay down his arms, but he does not throw
them away."</p>

<p>He lay back as though exhausted after that, and smiled once
more.</p>

<p>"You young men...you young men..."</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, but his lips continued their jerky
movement...</p>
