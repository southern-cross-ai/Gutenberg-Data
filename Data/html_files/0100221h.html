<h2><a name="prologue" id="prologue">PROLOGUE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">The moon had risen above the rim of the canyon
near the headwaters of the Little Colorado. It bathed in soft light
the willows that line the bank of the little mountain torrent and
the cottonwood trees beneath which stood the tiny cabin where I had
been camping for a few weeks in the White Mountains of Arizona.</p>

<p>I stood upon the little porch of the cabin enjoying the soft
beauties of this Arizona night; and as I contemplated the peace and
serenity of the scene, it did not seem possible that but a few
years before the fierce and terrible Geronimo had stood in this
same spot before this self-same cabin, or that generations before
that this seemingly deserted canyon had been peopled by a race now
extinct.</p>

<p>I had been seeking in their ruined cities for the secret of
their genesis and the even stranger secret of their extinction. How
I wished that those crumbling lava cliffs might speak and tell me
of all that they had witnessed since they poured out in a molten
stream from the cold and silent cones that dot the mesa land beyond
the canyon.</p>

<p>My thoughts returned again to Geronimo and his fierce Apache
warriors; and these vagrant musings engendered memories of Captain
John Carter of Virginia, whose dead body had lain for ten long
years in some forgotten cave in the mountains not far south of this
very spot&mdash;the cave in which he had sought shelter from
pursuing Apaches.</p>

<p>My eyes, following the pathway of my thoughts, searched the
heavens until they rested upon the red eye of Mars shining there in
the blue-black void; and so it was that Mars was uppermost in my
mind as I turned into my cabin and prepared for a good night's rest
beneath the rustling leaves of the cottonwoods, with whose soft and
soothing lullaby was mingled the rippling and the gurgling of the
waters of the little Colorado.</p>

<p>I was not sleepy; and so, after I had undressed, I arranged a
kerosene lamp near the head of my bunk and settled myself for the
enjoyment of a gangster story of assassination and kidnaping.</p>

<p>My cabin consists of two rooms. The smaller back room is my
bedroom. The larger room in front of it serves all other purposes,
being dining room, kitchen, and living room combined. From my bunk,
I cannot see directly into the front room. A flimsy partition
separates the bedroom from the living room. It consists of
rough-hewn boards that in the process of shrinking have left wide
cracks in the wall, and in addition to this the door between the
two rooms is seldom closed; so that while I could not see into the
adjoining room, I could hear anything that might go on within
it.</p>

<p>I do not know that I am more susceptible to suggestion than the
average man; but the fact remains that murder, mystery, and
gangster stories always seem more vivid when I read them alone in
the stilly watches of the night.</p>

<p>I had just reached the point in the story where an assassin was
creeping upon the victim of kidnappers when I heard the front door
of my cabin open and close and, distinctly, the clank of metal upon
metal.</p>

<p>Now, insofar as I knew, there was no one other than myself
camped upon the headwaters of the Little Colorado; and certainly no
one who had the right to enter my cabin without knocking.</p>

<p>I sat up in my bunk and reached under my pillow for the .45 Colt
automatic that I keep there.</p>

<p>The oil lamp faintly illuminated my bedroom, but its main
strength was concentrated upon me. The outer room was in darkness,
as I could see by leaning from my bunk and peering through the
doorway.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" I demanded, releasing the safety catch on my
automatic and sliding my feet out of bed to the floor. Then,
without waiting for a reply, I blew out the lamp.</p>

<p>A low laugh came from the adjoining room. "It is a good thing
your wall is full of cracks," said a deep voice, "or otherwise I
might have stumbled into trouble. That is a mean-looking gun I saw
before you blew out your lamp."</p>

<p>The voice was familiar, but I could not definitely place it.
"Who are you?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Light your lamp and I'll come in," replied my nocturnal
visitor. "If you're nervous, you can keep your gun on the doorway,
but please don't squeeze the trigger until you have had a chance to
recognize me."</p>

<p>"Damn!" I exclaimed under my breath, as I started to relight the
lamp.</p>

<p>"Chimney still hot?" inquired the deep voice from the outer
room.</p>

<p>"Plenty hot," I replied, as I succeeded at last in igniting the
wick and replacing the hot chimney. "Come in."</p>

<p>I remained seated on the edge of the bunk, but I kept the
doorway covered with my gun. I heard again the clanking of metal
upon metal, and then a man stepped into the light of my feeble lamp
and halted in the doorway. He was a tall man apparently between
twenty-five and thirty with grey eyes and black hair. He was naked
but for leather trappings that supported weapons of unearthly
design&mdash;a short sword, a long sword, a dagger, and a pistol;
but my eyes did not need to inventory all these details before I
recognized him. The instant that I saw him, I tossed my gun aside
and sprang to my feet.</p>

<p>"John Carter!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"None other," he replied, with one of his rare smiles.</p>

<p>We grasped hands. "You haven't changed much," he said.</p>

<p>"Nor you at all," I replied.</p>

<p>He sighed and then smiled again. "God alone knows how old I am.
I can recall no childhood, nor have I ever looked other than I look
tonight; but come," he added, "you mustn't stand here in your bare
feet. Hop back into bed again. These Arizona nights are none too
warm."</p>

<p>He drew up a chair and sat down. "What were you reading?" he
asked, as he picked up the magazine that had fallen to the floor
and glanced at the illustration. "It looks like a lurid tale."</p>

<p>"A pretty little bedtime story of assassination and kidnaping,"
I explained.</p>

<p>"Haven't you enough of that on earth without reading about it
for entertainment?" he inquired. "We have on Mars."</p>

<p>"It is an expression of the normal morbid interest in the
horrifying," I said. "There is really no justification, but the
fact remains that I enjoy such tales. However, I have lost my
interest now. I want to hear about you and Dejah Thoris and
Carthoris, and what brought you here. It has been years since you
have been back. I had given up all hope of ever seeing you
again."</p>

<p>He shook his head, a little sadly I thought. "It is a long
story, a story of love and loyalty, of hate and crime, a story of
dripping swords, of strange places and strange people upon a
stranger world. The living of it might have driven a weaker man to
madness. To have one you love taken from you and not to know her
fate!"</p>

<p>I did not have to ask whom he meant. It could be none other than
the incomparable Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, and consort of
John Carter, Warlord of Mars&mdash;the woman for whose deathless
beauty a million swords had been kept red with blood on the dying
planet for many a long year.</p>

<p>For a long time John Carter sat in silence staring at the floor.
I knew that his thoughts were forty-three million miles away, and I
was loath to interrupt them.</p>

<p>At last he spoke. "Human nature is alike everywhere," he said.
He flicked the edge of the magazine lying on my bunk. "We think
that we want to forget the tragedies of life, but we do not. If
they momentarily pass us by and leave us in peace, we must conjure
them again, either in our thoughts or through some such medium as
you have adopted. As you find a grim pleasure in reading about
them, so I find a grim pleasure in thinking about them.</p>

<p>"But my memories of that great tragedy are not all sad. There
was high adventure, there was noble fighting; and in the end there
was&mdash;but perhaps you would like to hear about it."</p>

<p>I told him that I would, so he told me the story that I have set
down here in his own words, as nearly as I can recall them.</p>

<h2><a name="chap1" id="chap1">I. &mdash; RAPAS THE ULSIO</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Over nineteen hundred miles east of The Twin
Cities of Helium, at about Lat. 30 degrees S., Lon. 172 degrees E.,
lies Zodanga. It has ever been a hotbed of sedition since the day
that I led the fierce green hordes of Thark against it and,
reducing it, added it to the Empire of Helium.</p>

<p>Within its frowning walls lives many a Zodangan who feels no
loyalty for Helium; and here, too, have gathered numbers of the
malcontents of the great empire ruled over by Tardos Mors, Jeddak
of Helium. To Zodanga have migrated not a few of the personal and
political enemies of the house of Tardos Mors and of his son-in-
law, John Carter, Prince of Helium.</p>

<p>I visited the city as seldom as possible, as I had little love
either for it or its people; but my duties called me there
occasionally, principally because it was the headquarters of one of
the most powerful guilds of assassins on Mars.</p>

<p>The land of my birth is cursed with its gangsters, its killers,
and its kidnappers but these constitute but a slight menace as
compared with the highly efficient organizations that flourish upon
Mars. Here assassination is a profession; kidnaping, a fine art.
Each has its guild, its laws, its customs, and its code of ethics;
and so widespread are their ramifications that they seem
inextricably interwoven into the entire social and political life
of the planet.</p>

<p>For years I have been seeking to extirpate this noxious system,
but the job has seemed a thankless and hopeless one. Entrenched
behind age-old ramparts of habit and tradition, they occupy a
position in the public consciousness that has cast a certain
glamour of romance and honor upon them.</p>

<p>The kidnappers are not in such good odor, but among the more
notorious assassins are men who hold much the same position in the
esteem of the masses as do your great heroes of the prize ring and
the baseball diamond.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in the war that I was waging upon them, I was also
handicapped by the fact that I must fight almost alone, as even
those of the red men of Mars who felt as I did upon the subject
also believed that to take sides with me against the assassins
would prove but another means for committing suicide. Yet I know
that even this would not have deterred them, had they felt that
there was any hope of eventual success.</p>

<p>That I had for so long escaped the keen blade of the assassin
seemed little less than a miracle to them, and I presume that only
my extreme self-confidence in my ability to take care of myself
prevented me from holding the same view.</p>

<p>Dejah Thoris and my son, Carthoris, often counseled me to
abandon the fight; but all my life I have been loath to admit
defeat, nor ever have I willingly abandoned the chance for a good
fight.</p>

<p>Certain types of killings upon Mars are punishable by death, and
most of the killings of the assassins fell in such categories. So
far, this was the only weapon that I had been able to use against
them, and then not always successfully, for it was usually
difficult to prove their crime, since even eyewitnesses feared to
testify against them.</p>

<p>But I had gradually evolved and organized another means of
combating them. This consisted of a secret organization of super-
assassins. In other words, I had elected to fight the devil with
fire.</p>

<p>When an assassination was reported, my organization acted in the
role of detective to ferret out the murderer. Then it acted as
judge and jury and eventually as executioner. Its every move was
made in secret, but over the heart of each of its victims an "X"
was cut with the sharp point of a dagger.</p>

<p>We usually struck quickly, if we could strike at all; and soon
the public and the assassins learned to connect that "X" over the
heart as the mark of the hand of justice falling upon the guilty;
and I know that in a number of the larger cities of Helium we
greatly reduced the death rate by assassination. Otherwise,
however, we seemed as far from our goal as when we first
started.</p>

<p>Our poorest results had been gained in Zodanga; and the
assassins of that city openly boasted that they were too smart for
me, for although they did not know positively, they guessed that
the X's upon the breasts of their dead comrades were made by an
organization headed by me.</p>

<p>I hope that I have not bored you with this exposition of these
dry facts, but it seemed necessary to me that I do so as an
introduction to the adventures that befell me, taking me to a
strange world in an effort to thwart the malign forces that had
brought tragedy into my life.</p>

<p>In my fight against the assassins of Barsoom, I had never been
able to enlist many agents to serve in Zodanga; and those stationed
there worked only in a half-hearted manner, so that our enemies had
good reason to taunt us with our failure.</p>

<p>To say that such a condition annoyed me would be putting it
mildly; and so I decided to go in person to Zodanga, not only for
the purpose of making a thorough investigation, but to give the
Zodangan assassins a lesson that would cause them to laugh out of
the other side of their mouths.</p>

<p>I decided to go secretly and in disguise, for I knew that if I
were to go there as John Carter, Warlord of Mars, I could learn
nothing more than I already knew.</p>

<p>Disguise for me is a relatively simple matter. My white skin and
black hair have made me a marked man upon Mars, where only the
auburn-haired Lotharians and the totally bald Therns have skin as
light colored as mine.</p>

<p>Although I had every confidence in the loyalty of my retainers,
one never knows when a spy may insinuate himself into the most
carefully selected organization. For this reason, I kept my plans
and preparations secret from even the most trusted members of my
entourage.</p>

<p>In the hangars on the roof of my palace are fliers of various
models, and I selected from among them a one-arm scout flier from
which I surreptitiously removed the insignia of my house. Finding a
pretext to send the hangar guard away for a short time early one
evening, I smuggled aboard the flier those articles that I needed
to insure a satisfactory disguise. In addition to a red pigment for
my own skin and paints for the body of the flier, I included a
complete set of Zodangan harness, metal, and weapons.</p>

<p>That evening I spent alone with Dejah Thoris; and about
twenty-five xats past the eighth zode, or at midnight earth time, I
changed to a plain leather harness without insignia, and prepared
to leave upon my adventure.</p>

<p>"I wish you were not going, my prince; I have a premonition
that&mdash;well&mdash;that we are both going to regret it."</p>

<p>"The assassins must be taught a lesson," I replied, "or no one's
life will be safe upon Barsoom. By their acts, they have issued a
definite challenge; and that I cannot permit to go unnoticed."</p>

<p>"I suppose not," she replied. "You won your high position here
with your sword; and by your sword I suppose you must maintain it,
but I wish it were otherwise."</p>

<p>I took her in my arms and kissed her and told her not to
worry&mdash;that I would not be gone long. Then I went to the
hangar on the roof.</p>

<p>The hangar guard may have thought that it was an unusual time of
night for me to be going abroad, but he could have had no suspicion
as to my destination. I took off toward the West and presently was
cutting the thin air of Mars beneath the myriad stars and the two
gorgeous satellites of the red planet.</p>

<p>The moons of Mars have always intrigued me; and tonight, as I
gazed upon them, I felt the lure of the mystery that surrounds
them. Thuria, the nearer moon, known to earth men as Phobos, is the
larger; and as it circles Barsoom at a distance of only 5,800 miles,
it presents a most gorgeous sight. Cluros, the farther moon, though
only a little smaller in diameter than Thuria, appears to be much
smaller because of the greater distance of its orbit from the
planet, lying as it does, 14,500 miles away.</p>

<p>For ages, there was a Martian legend, which remained for me to
explode, that the black race, the so-called First-born of Barsoom,
lived upon Thuria, the nearer moon; but at the time I exposed the
false gods of Mars, I demonstrated conclusively that the black race
lived in the Valley Dor, near the south pole of the planet.</p>

<p>Thuria, seemingly hanging low above me, presented a gorgeous
spectacle, which was rendered still more remarkable by the fact
that she apparently moved through the heavens from west to east,
due to the fact that her orbit is so near the planet she performs a
revolution in less than one-third of that of the diurnal rotation
of Mars. But as I watched her this night in dreamy fascination,
little could I guess the part that she was so soon to play in the
thrilling adventures and the great tragedy that lay just beyond my
horizon.</p>

<p>When I was well beyond The Twin Cities of Helium, I cut off my
running lights and circled to the South, gradually heading toward
the East until I held a true course for Zodanga. Setting my
destination compass, I was free to turn my attention to other
matters, knowing that this clever invention would carry the ship
safely to its destination.</p>

<p>My first task was to repaint the hull of the flier. I buckled
straps onto my harness and onto rings in the gunwale of the craft;
and then, lowering myself over the side, I proceeded to my work. It
was slow work, for after painting as far as I could reach in all
directions, I had to come on deck and change the position of the
straps, so that I could cover another portion of the hull. But
toward morning it was finally accomplished, though I cannot say
that I looked with pride upon the result as anything of an artistic
achievement. However, I had succeeded in covering the old paint and
thus disguising the craft insofar as color was concerned. This
accomplished, I threw my brush and the balance of the paint
overboard, following them with the leather harness that I had worn
from home.</p>

<p>As I had gotten almost as much paint upon myself as upon the
hull of the boat, it took me some little time to erase the last
vestige of this evidence that would acquaint a discerning observer
with the fact that I had recently repainted my craft.</p>

<p>This done, I applied the red pigment evenly to every square inch
of my naked body; so that after I had finished, I could have passed
anywhere on Mars as a member of the dominant red race of Martians;
and when I had donned the Zodangan harness, metal, and weapons, I
felt that my disguise was complete.</p>

<p>It was now mid-forenoon; and, after eating, I lay down to snatch
a few hours of sleep.</p>

<p>Entering a Martian city after dark is likely to be fraught with
embarrassment for one whose mission may not be readily explained.
It was, of course, possible that I might sneak in without lights;
but the chances of detection by one of the numerous patrol boats
was too great; and as I could not safely have explained my mission
or revealed my identity, I should most certainly be sent to the
pits and, doubtless, receive the punishment that is meted to
spies&mdash;long imprisonment in the pits, followed by death in the
arena.</p>

<p>Were I to enter with lights, I should most certainly be
apprehended; and as I should not be able to answer questions
satisfactorily, and as there would be no one to sponsor me, my
predicament would be almost equally difficult; so as I approached
the city before dawn of the second day, I cut out my motor and
drifted idly well out of range of the searchlights of the patrol
boats.</p>

<p>Even after daylight had come, I did not approach the city until
the middle of the forenoon at a time when other ships were moving
freely back and forth across the walls.</p>

<p>By day, and unless a city is actively at war, there are few
restrictions placed upon the coming and going of small craft.
Occasionally the patrol boats stop and question one of these; and
as fines are heavy for operating without licenses, a semblance of
regulation is maintained by the government.</p>

<p>In my case, it was not a question of a license to fly a ship but
of my right to be in Zodanga at all; so my approach to the city was
not without its spice of adventure.</p>

<p>At last the city wall lay almost directly beneath me; and I was
congratulating myself upon my good fortune, as there was no patrol
boat in sight; but I had congratulated myself too soon, for almost
immediately there appeared from behind a lofty tower one of those
swift little cruisers that are commonly used in all Martian cities
for patrol service, and it was headed directly toward me.</p>

<p>I was moving slowly, so as not to attract unfavorable attention;
but I can assure you that my mind was working rapidly. The one-man
scout flier that I was using is very fast, and I might easily have
turned and outdistanced the patrol boat; however, there were two
very important objections to such a plan. One was that,
unquestionably, the patrol boat would immediately open fire on me
with the chances excellent that they would bring me down. The other
was, that should I escape, it would be practically impossible for
me to enter the city again in this way, as my boat would be marked;
and the entire patrol system would be on the lookout for it.</p>

<p>The cruiser was steadily approaching me, and I was preparing to
bluff my way through with a cock-and-bull story of having been long
absent from Zodanga and having lost my papers while I was away. The
best that I could hope from this was that I should merely be fined
for not having my papers, and as I was well supplied with money,
such a solution of my difficulties would be a most welcome one.</p>

<p>This, however, was a very slim hope, as it was almost a foregone
conclusion that they would insist upon knowing who my sponsor was
at the time my lost papers were issued; and without a sponsor I
would be in a bad way.</p>

<p>Just as they got within hailing distance, and I was sure that
they were about to order me to stop, I heard a loud crash above me;
and glancing up, I saw two small ships in collision. I could see
the officer in command of the patrol boat plainly now; and as I
glanced at him, I saw him looking up. He barked a short command;
the nose of the patrol boat was elevated; and it circled rapidly
upward, its attention diverted from me by a matter of vastly
greater importance. While it was thus engaged, I slipped quietly on
into the city of Zodanga.</p>

<p>At the time, many years ago, that Zodanga was looted by the
green hordes of Thark, it had been almost completely razed. It was
the old city with which I had been most familiar, and I had visited
the rebuilt Zodanga upon but one or two occasions since.</p>

<p>Cruising idly about, I finally found that for which I
sought&mdash;an unpretentious public hangar in a shabby quarter of
the city. There are quarters in every city with which I am familiar
where one may go without being subjected to curious questioning, so
long as one does not run afoul of the officers of the law. This
hangar and this quarter of Zodanga looked such a place to me.</p>

<p>The hangar was located on the roof of a very old building that
had evidently escaped the ravages of the Tharks. The landing space
was small, and the hangars themselves dingy and unkempt.</p>

<p>As my craft settled to the roof, a fat man, well smeared with
black grease, appeared from behind a flier upon the engine of which
he was evidently working.</p>

<p>He looked at me questioningly, and I thought with none too
friendly an expression. "What do you want?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Is this a public hangar?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I want space for my craft."</p>

<p>"Have you got any money?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I have a little. I will pay a month's rental in advance," I
replied.</p>

<p>The frown melted from his face. "That hangar there is vacant,"
he said, pointing. "Run her in there."</p>

<p>Having housed my flier and locked the controls, I returned to
the man and paid him.</p>

<p>"Is there a good public house near by?" I asked, "one that is
cheap and not too dirty."</p>

<p>"There is one right in this building," he replied, "as good as
any that you will find around here."</p>

<p>This suited me perfectly, as when one is on an adventure of this
nature, one never knows how quickly a flier may be required or how
soon it may be all that stands between one and death.</p>

<p>Leaving the surly hangar proprietor, I descended the ramp that
opened onto the roof.</p>

<p>The elevators ran only to the floor below the roof, and here I
found one standing with its door open. The operator was a
dissipated looking young fellow in shabby harness.</p>

<p>"Ground floor?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am looking for lodgings," I replied. "I want to go to the
office of the public house in this building."</p>

<p>He nodded, and the elevator started down. The building appeared
even older and more dilapidated from the inside than the out, and
the upper floors seemed practically untenanted.</p>

<p>"Here you are," he said presently, stopping the elevator and
opening the door.</p>

<p>In Martian cities, public houses such as this are merely places
to sleep. There are seldom but few, if any, private rooms. Along
the side walls of long rooms are low platforms upon which each
guest places his sleeping silks and furs in a numbered space
allotted to him.</p>

<p>Owing to the prevalence of assassination, these rooms are
patrolled night and day by armed guards furnished by the
proprietor; and it is largely because of this fact that private
rooms are not in demand. In houses that cater to women, these
guests are segregated; and there are more private rooms and no
guards in their quarters, as the men of Barsoom seldom, if ever,
kill a woman, or I may qualify that by saying that they do not
employ assassins to kill them, ordinarily.</p>

<p>The public house to which chance had led me catered only to men.
There were no women in it.</p>

<p>The proprietor, a burly man whom I later learned was formerly a
famous panthan, or soldier of fortune, assigned me a sleeping place
and collected his fee for a day's lodging; and after directing me
to an eating-place in response to my inquiries, left me.</p>

<p>Scarcely any of the other guests were in the house at this hour
of the day. Their personal belongings, their sleeping silks and
furs, were in the spaces allotted to them; and even though there
had been no guards patrolling the room, they would have been safe,
as thievery is practically unknown upon Mars.</p>

<p>I had brought with me some old and very ordinary sleeping silks
and furs and these I deposited upon the platform. Sprawled in the
adjoining space was a shifty-eyed individual with an evil face. I
had noticed that he had been eyeing me surreptitiously ever since I
had entered. At last he spoke to me.</p>

<p>"Kaor!" he said, using the familiar form of Martian
greeting.</p>

<p>I nodded and replied in kind.</p>

<p>"We are to be neighbors," he ventured.</p>

<p>"So it would seem," I replied.</p>

<p>"You are evidently a stranger, at least in this part of the
city," he continued. "I overheard you asking the proprietor where
you could find an eating-place. The one he directed you to is not
as good as the one that I go to. I am going there now; if you'd
like to come along, I'll be glad to take you."</p>

<p>There was a furtiveness about the man that, in connection with
his evil face, assured me that he was of the criminal class; and as
it was among this class that I expected to work, his suggestion
dovetailed nicely with my plans; so I quickly accepted.</p>

<p>"My name is Rapas," he said, "they call me Rapas the Ulsio," he
added, not without a touch of pride.</p>

<p>Now I was sure that I had judged him correctly, for Ulsio means
rat.</p>

<p>"My name is Vandor," I told him, giving him the alias I had
selected for this adventure.</p>

<p>"By your metal, I see that you are a Zodangan," he said, as we
walked from the room to the elevators.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "but I have been absent from the city for
years. In fact, I have not been here since it was burned by the
Tharks. There have been so many changes that it is like coming to a
strange city."</p>

<p>"From your looks, I'd take you to be a fighting man by
profession," he suggested.</p>

<p>I nodded. "I am a panthan. I have served for many years in
another country, but recently I killed a man and had to leave." I
knew that if he were a criminal, as I had guessed, this admission
of a murder upon my part would make him freer with me.</p>

<p>His shifty eyes glanced quickly at me and then away; and I saw
that he was impressed, one way or another, by my admission. On the
way to the eating-place, which lay in another avenue a short
distance from our public house, we carried on a desultory
conversation.</p>

<p>When we had seated ourselves at a table, Rapas ordered drinks;
and immediately after he had downed the first one his tongue
loosened.</p>

<p>"Are you going to remain in Zodanga?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That depends upon whether or not I can find a living here," I
replied. "My money won't last long; and, of course, leaving my last
employer under the circumstances that I did, I have no papers; so I
may have trouble in finding a place at all."</p>

<p>While we were eating our meal, Rapas continued to drink; and the
more he drank the more talkative he became.</p>

<p>"I have taken a liking to you, Vandor," he announced presently;
"and if you are the right kind, as I think you are, I can find you
employment." Finally he leaned close to me and whispered in my ear.
"I am a gorthan," he said.</p>

<p>Here was an incredible piece of good fortune. I had hoped to
contact the assassins, and the first man whose acquaintance I had
made admitted that he was one.</p>

<p>I shrugged, deprecatively.</p>

<p>"Not much money in that," I said.</p>

<p>"There is plenty, if you are well connected," he assured me.</p>

<p>"But I am not connected well, or otherwise, here in Zodanga," I
argued, "I don't belong to the Zodangan guild; and, as I told you,
I had to come away without any papers."</p>

<p>He looked around him furtively to see if any were near who might
overhear him. "The guild is not necessary," he whispered; "we do
not all belong to the guild."</p>

<p>"A good way to commit suicide," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Not for a man with a good head on him. Look at me; I am an
assassin, and I don't belong to the guild. I make good money too,
and I don't have to divide up with anyone." He took another drink.
"There are not many with as good heads on them as Rapas the
Ulsio."</p>

<p>He leaned closer to me. "I like you, Vandor," he said; "you are
a good fellow." His voice was getting thick from drink. "I have one
very rich client; he has lots of work, and he pays well. I can get
you an odd job with him now and again. Perhaps I can find steady
employment for you. How would you like that?"</p>

<p>I shrugged. "A man must live," I said; "he can't be too
particular about his job when he hasn't very much money."</p>

<p>"Well, you come along with me; I am going there tonight. While
Fal Sivas talks to you, I will tell him that you are just the man
that he needs."</p>

<p>"But how about you?" I inquired. "It is your job; certainly no
man needs two assassins."</p>

<p>"Never mind about me," said Rapas; "I have other ideas in my
head." He stopped suddenly and gave me a quick, suspicious look. It
was almost as though what he had said had sobered him. He shook his
head, evidently in an effort to clear it. "What did I say?" he
demanded. "I must be getting drunk."</p>

<p>"You said that you had other plans. I suppose you mean that you
have a better job in view."</p>

<p>"Is that all I said?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"You said that you would take me to a man called Fal Sivas who
would give me employment."</p>

<p>Rapas seemed relieved. "Yes, I will take you to see him
tonight."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap2" id="chap2">II. &mdash; FAL SIVAS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">For the balance of the day Rapas slept, while I
occupied my time puttering around my flier in the public hangar on
the roof of the hostelry. This was a far more secluded spot than
the public sleeping room or the streets of the city, where some
accident might pierce my disguise and reveal my identity.</p>

<p>As I worked over my motor, I recalled Rapas's sudden fear that
he had revealed something to me in his drunken conversation; and I
wondered idly what it might be. It had come following his statement
that he had other plans. What plans? Whatever they were, they were
evidently nefarious, or he would not have been so concerned when he
feared that he had revealed them.</p>

<p>My short acquaintance with Rapas had convinced me that my first
appraisal of his character was correct and that his sobriquet of
Rapas the Rat was well deserved.</p>

<p>I chafed under the enforced inactivity of the long day; but at
last evening came, and Rapas the Ulsio and I left our quarters and
made our way once more to the eating-place.</p>

<p>Rapas was sober now, nor did he take but a single drink with his
meal. "You've got to have a clear head when you talk to old Fal
Sivas," he said. "By my first ancestor, no shrewder brain was ever
hatched of a woman's egg."</p>

<p>After we had eaten, we went out into the night; and Rapas led me
through broad avenues and down narrow alleyways until we came to a
large building that stood near the eastern wall of Zodanga.</p>

<p>It was a dark and gloomy pile, and the avenue that ran before it
was unlighted. It stood in a district given over to warehouses, and
at this time of night its surroundings were deserted.</p>

<p>Rapas approached a small doorway hidden in an angle of a
buttress. I saw him groping with his hands at one side of the door,
and presently he stepped back and waited.</p>

<p>"Not everyone can gain admission to old Fal Sivas's Place," he
remarked, with a tinge of boastfulness. "You have to know the right
signal, and that means that you have to be pretty well in the
confidence of the old man."</p>

<p>We waited in silence then for perhaps two or three minutes. No
sound came from beyond the door; but presently a very small, round
port in its surface opened; and in the dim light of the farther
moon I saw an eye appraising us. Then a voice spoke.</p>

<p>"Ah, the noble Rapas!" The words were whispered; and following
them, the door swung in.</p>

<p>The passage beyond was narrow, and the man who had opened the
door flattened himself against the wall that we might pass. Then he
closed the door behind us and followed us along a dark corridor,
until we finally emerged into a small, dimly lighted room.</p>

<p>Here our guide halted. "The master did not say that you were
bringing another with you," he said to Rapas.</p>

<p>"He did not know it," replied Rapas. "In fact, I did not know it
myself until today; but it is all right. Your master will be glad
to receive him when I have explained why I brought him."</p>

<p>"That is a matter that Fal Sivas will have to decide for
himself," replied the slave. "Perhaps you had better go first and
speak to him, leaving the stranger here with me."</p>

<p>"Very well, then," agreed my companion. "Remain here until I
return, Vandor."</p>

<p>The slave unlocked the door in the far side of the anteroom; and
after Rapas had passed through, he followed him and closed it.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that his action was a little strange, as I had
just heard him say that he would remain with me, but I would have
thought nothing more of the matter had I not presently become
impressed with the very definite sensation that I was being
watched.</p>

<p>I cannot explain this feeling that I occasionally have. Earth
men who should know say that this form of telepathy is
scientifically impossible, yet upon many occasions I have
definitely sensed this secret surveillance, later to discover that
I really was being watched.</p>

<p>As my eyes wandered casually about the room, they came to rest
again upon the door beyond which Rapas and the slave had
disappeared. They were held momentarily by a small round hole in
the paneling and the glint of something that might have been an eye
shining in the darkness. I knew that it was an eye.</p>

<p>Just why I should be watched, I did not know; but if my observer
hoped to discover anything suspicious about me, he was
disappointed; for as soon as I realized that an eye was upon me, I
walked to a bench at one side of the room and sat down, instantly
determined not to reveal the slightest curiosity concerning my
surroundings.</p>

<p>Such surveillance probably meant little in itself, but taken in
connection with the gloomy and forbidding appearance of the
building and the great stealth and secrecy with which we had been
admitted, it crystallized a most unpleasant impression of the place
and its master that had already started to form in my mind.</p>

<p>From beyond the walls of the room there came no sound, nor did
any of the night noises of the city penetrate to the little
anteroom. Thus I sat in utter silence for about ten minutes; then
the door opened, and the same slave beckoned to me.</p>

<p>"Follow me," he said. "The master will see you. I am to take you
to him."</p>

<p>I followed him along a gloomy corridor and up a winding ramp to
the next higher level of the building. A moment later he ushered me
into a softly lighted room furnished with Sybaritic luxury, where I
saw Rapas standing before a couch on which a man reclined, or I
should say, crouched. Somehow he reminded me of a great cat
watching its prey, always ready to spring.</p>

<p>"This is Vandor, Fal Sivas," said Rapas, by way of
introduction.</p>

<p>I inclined my head in acknowledgment and stood before the man,
waiting.</p>

<p>"Rapas has told me about you," said Fal Sivas. "Where are you
from?"</p>

<p>"Originally I was from Zodanga," I replied, "but that was years
ago before the sacking of the city."</p>

<p>"And where have you been since?" he asked. "Whom have you
served?"</p>

<p>"That," I replied, "is a matter of no consequence to anyone but
myself. It is sufficient that I have not been in Zodanga, and that
I cannot return to the country that I have just fled."</p>

<p>"You have no friends or acquaintances in Zodanga, then?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Of course, some of my acquaintances may still be living; that I
do not know," I replied, "but my people and most of my friends were
killed at the time that the green hordes overran the city."</p>

<p>"And you have had no intercourse with Zodanga since you left?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"None whatsoever."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are just the man I need. Rapas is sure of it, but I
am never sure. No man can be trusted."</p>

<p>"Ah, but master," interrupted Rapas, "have I not always served
you well and faithfully?"</p>

<p>I thought I saw a slight sneer curl the lip of Fal Sivas.</p>

<p>"You are a paragon, Rapas," he said, "the soul of honor."</p>

<p>Rapas swelled with importance. He was too egotistical to note
the flavor of sarcasm in Fal Sivas's voice.</p>

<p>"And I may consider myself employed?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You understand that you may be called upon to use a dagger more
often than a sword," he asked, "and that poisons are sometimes
preferred to pistols?"</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>He looked at me intently.</p>

<p>"There may come a time," he continued, "when you may have to
draw your long sword or your short sword in my defense. Are you a
capable swordsman?"</p>

<p>"I am a panthan," I replied; "and as panthans live by the sword,
the very fact that I am here answers your question."</p>

<p>"Not entirely. I must have a master swordsman. Rapas, here, is
handy with the short sword. Let us see what you can do against
him."</p>

<p>"To the death?" I asked.</p>

<p>Rapas guffawed loudly. "I did not bring you here to kill you,"
he said.</p>

<p>"No, not to the death, of course," said Fal Sivas. "Just a short
passage. Let us see which one can scratch the other first."</p>

<p>I did not like the idea. I do not ordinarily draw my sword
unless I intend to kill, but I realized that I was playing a part
and that before I got through I might have to do many things of
which I did not approve; so I nodded my assent and waited for Rapas
to draw.</p>

<p>His short sword flashed from its scabbard. "I shall not hurt you
badly, Vandor," he said; "for I am very fond of you."</p>

<p>I thanked him and drew my own weapon.</p>

<p>Rapas stepped forward to engage me, a confident smile upon his
lips. The next instant his weapon was flying across the room. I had
disarmed him, and he was at my mercy. He backed away, a sickly grin
upon his face. Fal Sivas laughed.</p>

<p>"It was an accident," said Rapas. "I was not ready."</p>

<p>"I am sorry," I told him; "go and recover your weapon."</p>

<p>He got it and came back, and this time he lunged at me
viciously. There would have been no mere scratch that time if his
thrust had succeeded. He would have spitted me straight through the
heart. I parried and stepped in, and again his sword hurtled
through the air and clanked against the opposite wall.</p>

<p>Fal Sivas laughed uproariously. Rapas was furious. "That is
enough," said the former. "I am satisfied. Sheath your swords."</p>

<p>I knew that I had made an enemy of Rapas; but that did not
concern me greatly, since being forewarned I could always be
watchful of him. Anyway, I had never trusted him.</p>

<p>"You are prepared to enter my service at once?" asked Fal
Sivas.</p>

<p>"I am in your service now," I replied.</p>

<p>He smiled. "I think you are going to make me a good man. Rapas
wants to go away for a while to attend to business of his own.
While he is away, you will remain here as my bodyguard. When he
returns, I may still find use for you in one way or another. The
fact that you are unknown in Zodanga may make you very valuable to
me." He turned to Rapas. "You may go now, Rapas," he said, "and
while you are away, you might take some lessons in
swordsmanship."</p>

<p>When Fal Sivas said that, he grinned; but Rapas did not. He
looked very sour, and he did not say good-bye to me as he left the
room.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that you offended his dignity," said Fal Sivas
after the door had closed behind the assassin.</p>

<p>"I shall lose no sleep over it," I replied, "and anyway it was
not my fault. It was his."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded Fal Sivas.</p>

<p>"Rapas is not a good swordsman."</p>

<p>"He is considered an excellent one," Fal Sivas assured me.</p>

<p>"I imagine that as a killer he is more adept with the dagger and
poison."</p>

<p>"And how about you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Naturally, as a fighting man, I prefer the sword," I
replied.</p>

<p>Fal Sivas shrugged. "That is a matter of small concern to me,"
he said. "If you prefer to kill my enemies with a sword, use a
sword. All I ask is that you kill them."</p>

<p>"You have many enemies?" I asked.</p>

<p>"There are many who would like to see me put out of the way," he
replied. "I am an inventor, and there are those who would steal my
inventions. Many of these I have had to destroy. Their people
suspect me and seek revenge; but there is one who, above all
others, seeks to destroy me. He also is an inventor, and he has
employed an agent of the assassins' guild to make away with me.</p>

<p>"This guild is headed by Ur Jan, and he personally has
threatened my life because I have employed another than a member of
his guild to do my killing."</p>

<p>We talked for a short time, and then Fal Sivas summoned a slave
to show me to my quarters. "They are below mine," he said; "if I
call, you are to come to me immediately. Good night."</p>

<p>The slave led me to another room on the same level. In fact, to
a little suite of three rooms. They were plainly but comfortably
furnished.</p>

<p>"Is there anything that you require, master?" the slave
inquired, as he turned to leave me.</p>

<p>"Nothing," I replied.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow a slave will be assigned to serve you." With that he
left me, and I listened to see if he locked the door from the
outside; but he did not, though I would not have been surprised had
he done so, so sinister and secretive seemed everything connected
with this gloomy pile.</p>

<p>I occupied myself for a few moments inspecting my quarters. They
consisted of a living room, two small bedrooms, and a bath. A
single door opened from the living room onto the corridor. There
were no windows in any of the rooms. There were small ventilators
in the floors and in the ceilings, and draughts of air entering the
former indicated that the apartment was ventilated mechanically.
The rooms were lighted by radium bulbs similar to those generally
used throughout Barsoom.</p>

<p>In the living room was a table, a bench, and several chairs, and
a shelf upon which were a number of books. Glancing at some of
these, I discovered that they were all scientific works. There were
books on medicine, on surgery, chemistry, mechanics, and
electricity.</p>

<p>From time to time, I heard what appeared to be stealthy noises
in the corridor; but I did not investigate, as I wanted to
establish myself in the confidence of Fal Sivas and his people
before I ventured to take it upon myself to learn any more than
they desired me to know. I did not even know that I wanted to know
anything more about the household of Fal Sivas; for, after all, my
business in Zodanga had nothing to do with him. I had come to
undermine and, if possible, overthrow the strength of Ur Jan and
his guild of assassins; and all I needed was a base from which to
work. I was, in fact, a little disappointed to find that Fate had
thrown me in with those opposed to Ur Jan. I would have preferred
and, in fact, had hoped to be able to join Ur Jan's organization,
as I felt that I could accomplish much more from the inside than
from the out.</p>

<p>If I could join the guild, I could soon learn the identity of
its principal members; and that, above all other things, was what I
wished to do, that I might either bring them to justice or put the
cross upon their hearts with the point of my own sword.</p>

<p>Occupied with these thoughts, I was about to remove my harness
and turn in to my sleeping silks and furs when I heard sounds of
what might have been a scuffle on the level above and then a thud,
as of a body falling.</p>

<p>The former preternatural silence of the great house accentuated
the significance of the sounds that I was hearing, imparting to
them a mystery that I realized might be wholly out of proportion to
their true importance. I smiled as I realized the effect that my
surroundings seemed to be having upon my ordinarily steady nerves;
and had resumed my preparations for the night when a shrill scream
rang through the building.</p>

<p>I paused again and listened, and now I distinctly heard the
sound of feet running rapidly. They seemed to be approaching, and I
guessed that they were coming down the ramp from the level above to
the corridor that ran before my quarters.</p>

<p>Perhaps what went on in the house of Fal Sivas was none of my
affair, but I have never yet heard a woman scream without
investigating; so now I stepped to the door of my living room and
threw it open, and as I did so I saw a girl running rapidly toward
me. Her hair was disheveled; and from her wide, frightened eyes she
cast frequent glances backward over her shoulder.</p>

<p>She was almost upon me before she discovered me; and when she
did she paused for a moment with a gasp of astonishment or fear, I
could not tell which; then she darted past me through the open door
into my living room.</p>

<p>"Close the door," she whispered, her voice tense with suppressed
emotion. "Don't let him get me! Don't let him find me!"</p>

<p>No one seemed to be pursuing her, but I closed the door as she
had requested and turned toward her for an explanation.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" I demanded. "From whom were you
running?"</p>

<p>"From him." She shuddered. "Oh, he is horrible. Hide me; don't
let him get me, please!"</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean? Who is horrible?"</p>

<p>She stood there trembling and wide-eyed, staring past me at the
door, like one whom terror had demented.</p>

<p>"Him," she whispered. "Who else could it be?"</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;?"</p>

<p>She came close and started to speak; then she hesitated. "But
why should I trust you? You are one of his creatures. You are all
alike in this terrible place."</p>

<p>She was standing very close to me now, trembling like a leaf. "I
cannot stand it!" she cried. "I will not let him!" And then, so
quickly that I could not prevent her, she snatched the dagger from
my harness and turned it upon herself.</p>

<p>But there I was too quick for her, seizing her wrist before she
could carry out her designs.</p>

<p>She was a delicate-looking creature, but her appearance belied
her strength. However, I had little difficulty in disarming her;
and then I backed her toward the bench and forced her down upon
it.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself," I said; "you have nothing to fear from
me&mdash;nothing to fear from anybody while I am with you. Tell me
what has happened. Tell me whom you fear."</p>

<p>She sat there staring into my eyes for a long moment, and
presently she commenced to regain control of herself. "Yes," she
said presently, "perhaps I can trust you. You make me feel that
way&mdash;your voice, your looks."</p>

<p>I laid my hand upon her shoulder as one might who would quiet a
frightened child. "Do not be afraid," I said; "tell me something of
yourself. What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Zanda," she replied.</p>

<p>"You live here?"</p>

<p>"I am a slave, a prisoner."</p>

<p>"What made you scream?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I did not scream," she replied; "that was another. He tried to
get me, but I eluded him, and so he took another. My turn will
come. He will get me. He gets us all."</p>

<p>"Who? Who will get you?"</p>

<p>She shuddered as she spoke the name. "Fal Sivas," she said, and
there was horror in her tone.</p>

<p>I sat down on the bench beside her and laid my hand on hers.
"Quiet yourself," I said; "tell me what all this means. I am a
stranger here. I just entered the service of Fal Sivas
tonight."</p>

<p>"You know nothing, then, about Fal Sivas?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Only that he is a wealthy inventor and fears for his life."</p>

<p>"Yes, he is rich; and he is an inventor, but not so great an
inventor as he is a murderer and a thief. He steals ideas from
other inventors and then has them murdered in order to safeguard
what he has stolen. Those who learn too much of his inventions die.
They never leave this house. He always has an assassin ready to do
his bidding; sometimes here, sometimes out in the city; and he is
always afraid of his life.</p>

<p>"Rapas the Ulsio is his assassin now; but they are both afraid
of Ur Jan, chief of the guild of assassins; for Ur Jan has learned
that Rapas is killing for Fal Sivas for a price far lower than that
charged by the guild."</p>

<p>"But what are these wonderful inventions that Fal Sivas works
upon?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know all of the things that he does, but there is the
ship. That would be wonderful, were it not born of blood and
treachery."</p>

<p>"What sort of a ship?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A ship that will travel safely through interplanetary space. He
says that in a short time we shall be able to travel back and forth
between the planets as easily as we travel now from one city to
another."</p>

<p>"Interesting," I said, "and not so very horrible, that I can
see."</p>

<p>"But he does other things&mdash;horrible things. One of them is
a mechanical brain."</p>

<p>"A mechanical brain?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but of course I cannot explain it. I have so little
learning. I have heard him speak of it often, but I do not
understand.</p>

<p>"He says that all life, all matter, are the result of mechanical
action, not primarily, chemical action. He holds that all chemical
action is mechanical.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am probably not explaining it right. It is all so
confusing to me, because I do not understand it; but anyway he is
working on a mechanical brain, a brain that will think clearly and
logically, absolutely uninfluenced by any of the extraneous media
that affect human judgments."</p>

<p>"It seems rather a weird idea," I said, "but I can see nothing
so horrible about it."</p>

<p>"It is not the idea that is horrible," she said; "it is the
method that he employs to perfect his invention. In his effort to
duplicate the human brain, he must examine it. For this reason he
needs many slaves. A few he buys, but most of them are kidnaped for
him."</p>

<p>She commenced to tremble, and her voice came in little broken
gasps. "I do not know; I have not really seen it; but they say that
he straps his victims so that they cannot move and then removes the
skull until he has exposed the brain; and so, by means of rays that
penetrate the tissue, he watches the brain function."</p>

<p>"But his victims cannot suffer long," I said; "they would lose
consciousness and die quickly."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "No, he has perfected drugs that he injects
into their veins so that they remain alive and are conscious for a
long time. For long hours he applies various stimuli and watches
the reaction of the brain. Imagine if you can, the suffering of his
poor victims.</p>

<p>"Many slaves are brought here, but they do not remain long.
There are only two doors leading from the building, and there are
no windows in the outer walls. The slaves that disappear do not
leave through either of the two doorways. I see them today;
tomorrow they are gone, gone through the little doorway that leads
into the room of horror next to Fal Sivas's sleeping quarters.</p>

<p>"Tonight Fal Sivas sent for two of us, another girl and myself.
He purposed using only one of us. He always examines a couple and
then selects the one that he thinks is the best specimen, but his
selection is not determined wholly by scientific requirements. He
always selects the more attractive of the girls that are
summoned.</p>

<p>"He examined us, and then finally he selected me. I was
terrified. I tried to fight him off. He chased me about the room,
and then he slipped and fell; and before he could regain his feet,
I opened the door and escaped. Then I heard the other girl scream,
and I knew that he had seized her, but I have won only a reprieve.
He will get me; there is no escape. Neither you nor I will ever
leave this place alive."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"No one ever does."</p>

<p>"How about Rapas?" I asked. "He comes and goes apparently as he
wishes."</p>

<p>"Yes, Rapas comes and goes. He is Fal Sivas's assassin. He also
aids in the kidnaping of new victims. Under the circumstances he
would have to be free to leave the building. Then there are a few
others, old and trusted retainers, really partners in crime, whose
lives Fal Sivas holds in the palm of his hand; but you may rest
assured that none of these know too much about his inventions. The
moment that one is taken into Fal Sivas's confidence, his days are
numbered.</p>

<p>"The man seems to have a mania for talking about his inventions.
He must explain them to someone. I think that is because of his
great egotism. He loves to boast. That is the reason he tells us
who are doomed so much about his work. You may rest assured that
Rapas knows nothing of importance. In fact, I have heard Fal Sivas
say that one thing that endeared Rapas to him is the assassin's
utter stupidity. Fal Sivas says that if he explained every detail
of an invention to him, Rapas wouldn't have brains enough to
understand it."</p>

<p>By this time the girl had regained control of herself; and as
she ceased speaking, she started toward the doorway. "Thank you so
much," she said, "for letting me come in here. I shall probably
never see you again, but I should like to know who it is who has
befriended me."</p>

<p>"My name is Vandor," I replied, "but what makes you think you
will never see me again, and where are you going now?"</p>

<p>"I am going back to my quarters to wait for the next summons. It
may come tomorrow."</p>

<p>"You are going to stay right here," I replied; "we may find a
way of getting you out of this, yet."</p>

<p>She looked at me in surprise and was about to reply when
suddenly she cocked her head on one side and listened. "Someone is
coming," she said; "they are searching for me."</p>

<p>I took her by the hand and drew her toward the doorway to my
sleeping apartment. "Come in here," I said. "Let's see if we can't
hide you."</p>

<p>"No, no," she demurred; "they would kill us both then, if they
found me. You have been kind to me. I do not want them to kill
you."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me," I replied; "I can take care of myself.
Do as I tell you."</p>

<p>I took her into my room and made her lie down on the little
platform that serves in Barsoom as a bed. Then I threw the
sleeping silks and furs over her in a jumbled heap. Only by close
examination could anyone have discovered that her little form lay
hidden beneath them.</p>

<p>Stepping into the living room, I took a book at random from the
shelf; and seating myself in a chair, opened it. I had scarcely
done so, when I heard a scratching on the outside of the door
leading to the corridor.</p>

<p>"Come in," I called.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Fal Sivas stepped into the room.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap3" id="chap3">III. &mdash; TRAPPED</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Lowering my book, I looked up as Fal Sivas
entered. He glanced quickly and suspiciously about the apartment. I
had purposely left the door to my sleeping room open, so as not to
arouse suspicion should anyone come in to investigate. The doors to
the other sleeping room and bath were also open. Fal Sivas glanced
at the book in my hand. "Rather heavy reading for a panthan," he
remarked.</p>

<p>I smiled. "I recently read his Theoretical Mechanics. This is an
earlier work, I believe, and not quite so authoritative. I was
merely glancing through it."</p>

<p>Fal Sivas studied me intently for a moment. "Are you not a
little too well educated for your calling?" he asked.</p>

<p>"One may never know too much," I replied.</p>

<p>"One may know too much here," he said, and I recalled what the
girl had told me.</p>

<p>His tone changed. "I stopped in to see if everything was all
right with you, if you were comfortable."</p>

<p>"Very," I replied.</p>

<p>"You have not been disturbed? No one has been here?"</p>

<p>"The house seems very quiet," I replied. "I heard someone
laughing a short time ago, but that was all. It did not disturb
me."</p>

<p>"Has anyone come to your quarters?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, was someone supposed to come?"</p>

<p>"No one, of course," he said shortly, and then he commenced to
question me in an evident effort to ascertain the extent of my
mechanical and chemical knowledge.</p>

<p>"I really know little of either subject," I told him. "I am a
fighting man by profession, not a scientist. Of course, familiarity
with fliers connotes some mechanical knowledge, but after all I am
only a tyro."</p>

<p>He was studying me quizzically. "I wish that I knew you better,"
he said at last; "I wish that I knew that I could trust you. You
are an intelligent man. In the matter of brains, I am entirely
alone here. I need an assistant. I need such a man as you." He
shook his head, rather disgustedly. "But what is the use? I can
trust no one."</p>

<p>"You employed me as your bodyguard. For that work I am fitted.
Let it go at that."</p>

<p>"You are right," he agreed. "Time will tell what else you are
fitted for."</p>

<p>"And if I am to protect you," I continued, "I must know more
about your enemies. I must know who they are, and I must learn
their plans."</p>

<p>"There are many who would like to see me destroyed, or destroy
me themselves; but there is one who, above all others, would profit
by my death. He is Gar Nal, the inventor." He looked up at me
questioningly.</p>

<p>"I have never heard of him," I said. "You must remember that I
have been absent from Zodanga for many years."</p>

<p>He nodded. "I am perfecting a ship that will traverse space. So
is Gar Nal. He would like not only to have me destroyed, but also
to steal the secrets of my invention that would permit him to
perfect his; but Ur Jan is the one I most fear, because Gar Nal has
employed him to destroy me."</p>

<p>"I am unknown in Zodanga. I will hunt out this Ur Jan and see
what I can learn."</p>

<p>There was one thing that I wanted to learn right then, and that
was whether or not Fal Sivas would permit me to leave his house on
any pretext.</p>

<p>"You could learn nothing," he said; "their meetings are secret.
Even if you could gain admission, which is doubtful, you would be
killed before you could get out again."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," I said; "it is worth trying, anyway. Do you know
where they hold their meetings?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but if you want to try that, I will have Rapas guide you
to the building."</p>

<p>"If I am to go, I do not want Rapas to know anything about it,"
I said.</p>

<p>"Why?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Because I do not trust him," I replied. "I would not trust
anyone with knowledge of my plans."</p>

<p>"You are quite right. When you are ready to go, I can give you
directions so that you can find their meeting place."</p>

<p>"I will go tomorrow," I said, "after dark."</p>

<p>He nodded his approval. He was standing where he could look
directly into the bedroom where the girl was hidden. "Have you
plenty of sleeping silks and furs?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Plenty," I replied, "but I will bring my own tomorrow."</p>

<p>"That will not be necessary. I will furnish you all that you
require." He still stood staring into that other room. I wondered
if he suspected the truth, or if the girl had moved or her
breathing were noticeable under the pile of materials beneath which
she was hidden.</p>

<p>I did not dare to turn and look for myself for fear of arousing
his suspicions further. I just sat there waiting, my hands close to
the hilt of my short sword. Perhaps the girl was near discovery;
but, if so, Fal Sivas was also near death that moment.</p>

<p>At last he turned toward the outer doorway. "I will give you
directions tomorrow for reaching the headquarters of the gorthans,
and also tomorrow I will send you a slave. Do you wish a man or a
woman?"</p>

<p>I preferred a man, but I thought that I detected here a possible
opportunity for protecting the girl. "A woman," I said.</p>

<p>He smiled. "And a pretty one, eh?"</p>

<p>"I should like to select her myself, if I may."</p>

<p>"As you wish," he replied. "I shall let you look them over
tomorrow. May you sleep well."</p>

<p>He left the room and closed the door behind him; but I knew that
he stood outside for a long time, listening.</p>

<p>I picked up the book once more and commenced to read it; but not
a word registered on my consciousness, for all my faculties were
centered on listening.</p>

<p>After what seemed a long time, I heard him move away; and
shortly after I distinctly heard a door close on the level above
me. Not until then did I move, but now I arose and went to the
door. It was equipped with a heavy bar on the inside, and this I
slid silently into its keeper.</p>

<p>Crossing the room, I entered the chamber where the girl lay and
threw back the covers that concealed her. She had not moved. As she
looked up at me, I placed a finger across my lips.</p>

<p>"You heard?" I asked in a low whisper.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow I will select you as my slave. Perhaps later I shall
find a way to liberate you."</p>

<p>"You are kind," she said.</p>

<p>I reached down and took her by the hand. "Come," I said, "into
the other room. You can sleep there safely tonight, and in the
morning we will plan how we may carry out the rest of our
scheme."</p>

<p>"I think that will not be difficult," she said. "Early in the
morning everyone but Fal Sivas goes to a large dining room on this
level. Many of them will pass along this corridor. I can slip out,
unseen, and join them. At breakfast you will have an opportunity of
seeing all the slaves. Then you may select me if you still wish to
do so."</p>

<p>There were sleeping silks and furs in the room that I had
assigned to her, and I knew that she would be comfortable; so I
left her, and returning to my own room completed my preparations
for the night that had been so strangely interrupted.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *

<p>Early the next morning Zanda awoke me. "It will soon be time for
them to go to breakfast," she said. "You must go before I do,
leaving the door open. Then when there is no one in the corridor, I
will slip out."</p>

<p>As I left my quarters, I saw two or three people moving along
the corridor in the direction that Zanda had told me the dining
room lay; and so I followed them, finally entering a large room in
which there was a table that would seat about twenty. It was
already over half filled. Most of the slaves were women&mdash;young
women, and many of them were beautiful.</p>

<p>With the exception of two men, one sitting at either end of the
table, all the occupants of the room were without weapons.</p>

<p>The man sitting at the head of the table was the same who had
admitted Rapas and me the evening before. I learned later that his
name was Hamas, and that he was the major-domo of the
establishment.</p>

<p>The other armed man was Phystal. He was in charge of the slaves
in the establishment. He also, as I was to learn later, attended to
the procuring of many of them, usually by bribery or abduction.</p>

<p>As I entered the room, Hamas discovered me and motioned me to
come to him. "You will sit here, next to me, Vandor," he said.</p>

<p>I could not but note the difference in his manner from the night
before, when he had seemed more or less an obsequious slave. I
gathered that he played two roles for purposes known best to
himself or his master. In his present role, he was obviously a
person of importance.</p>

<p>"You slept well?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Quite," I replied; "the house seems very quiet and peaceful at
night."</p>

<p>He grunted. "If you should hear any unusual sounds at night," he
said, "you will not investigate, unless the master or I call you."
And then, as though he felt that that needed some explanation, he
added, "Fal Sivas sometimes works upon his experiments late at
night. You must not disturb him no matter what you may hear."</p>

<p>Some more slaves were entering the room now, and just behind
them came Zanda. I glanced at Hamas and saw his eyes narrow as they
alighted upon her.</p>

<p>"Here she is now, Phystal," he said.</p>

<p>The man at the far end of the table turned in his seat and
looked at the girl approaching from behind him. He was scowling
angrily.</p>

<p>"Where were you last night, Zanda?" he demanded, as the girl
approached the table.</p>

<p>"I was frightened, and I hid," she replied.</p>

<p>"Where did you hide?" demanded Phystal.</p>

<p>"Ask Hamas," she replied.</p>

<p>Phystal glanced at Hamas. "How should I know where you were?"
demanded the latter.</p>

<p>Zanda elevated her arched brows. "Oh, I am sorry," she
exclaimed; "I did not know that you cared who knew."</p>

<p>Hamas scowled angrily. "What do you mean by that?" he demanded;
"what are you driving at?"</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "I wouldn't have said anything about it at all
but I thought, of course, that Fal Sivas knew."</p>

<p>Phystal was eyeing Hamas suspiciously. All the slaves were
looking at him, and you could almost read their thoughts in the
expressions on their faces.</p>

<p>Hamas was furious, Phystal suspicious; and all the time the girl
stood there with the most innocent and angelic expression on her
face.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by saying such a thing?" shouted Hamas.</p>

<p>"What did I say?" she asked, innocently.</p>

<p>"You said&mdash;you said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I just said, 'ask Hamas.' Is there anything wrong in that?"</p>

<p>"But what do I know about it?" demanded the major-domo.</p>

<p>Zanda shrugged her slim shoulders. "I am afraid to say anything
more. I do not want to get you in trouble."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the less said about it, the better," said Phystal.</p>

<p>Hamas started to speak, but evidently thought better of it. He
glowered at Zanda for a moment and then fell to eating his
breakfast.</p>

<p>Just before the meal was over, I told Hamas that Fal Sivas had
instructed me to select a slave.</p>

<p>"Yes, he told me," replied the major-domo. "See Phystal about
it; he is in charge of the slaves."</p>

<p>"But does he know that Fal Sivas gave me permission to select
anyone that I chose?"</p>

<p>"I will tell him."</p>

<p>A moment later he finished his breakfast; and as he was leaving
the dining room, he paused and spoke to Phystal.</p>

<p>Seeing that Phystal also was about ready to leave the table, I
went to him and told him that I would like to select a slave.</p>

<p>"Which one do you want?" he asked.</p>

<p>I glanced around the table, apparently examining each of the
slaves carefully until at last my eyes rested upon Zanda.</p>

<p>"I will take this one," I said.</p>

<p>Phystal's brows contracted, and he hesitated.</p>

<p>"Fal Sivas said that I might select whomever I wished," I
reminded him.</p>

<p>"But why do you want this one?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"She seems intelligent, and she is good-looking," I replied.
"She will do as well as another until I am better acquainted here."
And so it was that Zanda was appointed to serve me. Her duties
would consist of keeping my apartments clean, running errands for
me, cleaning my harness, shining my metal, sharpening my swords and
daggers, and otherwise making herself useful.</p>

<p>I would much rather have had a man slave, but events had so
ordered themselves that I had been forced into the role of the
girl's protector, and this seemed the only plan by which I could
accomplish anything along that line; but whether or not Fal Sivas
would permit me to keep her, I did not know. That was a contingency
which remained for future solution when, and if, it eventuated.</p>

<p>I took Zanda back to my quarters; and while she was busying
herself with her duties there, I received a call summoning me to
Fal Sivas.</p>

<p>A slave led me to the same room in which Fal Sivas had received
Rapas and me the night before, and as I entered the old inventor
greeted me with a nod. I expected him to immediately question me
concerning Zanda, for both Hamas and Phystal were with him; and I
had no doubt but that they had reported all that had occurred at
the breakfast table.</p>

<p>However, I was agreeably disappointed, for he did not mention
the incident at all, but merely gave me instructions as to my
duties.</p>

<p>I was to remain on duty in the corridor outside his door and
accompany him when he left the room. I was to permit no one to
enter the room, other than Hamas or Phystal, without obtaining
permission from Fal Sivas. When he left the room, I was to
accompany him. Under no circumstances was I ever to go to the level
above, except with his permission or by his express command. He was
very insistent in impressing this point upon my mind; and though I
am not overly curious, I must admit that now that I had been
forbidden to go to any of the levels above, I wanted to do so.</p>

<p>"When you have been in my service longer and I know you better,"
explained Fal Sivas, "I hope to be able to trust you; but for the
present you are on probation."</p>

<p>That was the longest day I have ever spent, just standing around
outside that door, doing nothing; but at last it drew to a close,
and when I had the opportunity, I reminded Fal Sivas that he had
promised to direct me to Ur Jan's headquarters, so that I might try
to gain entrance to them that night.</p>

<p>He gave me very accurate directions to a building in another
quarter of the city.</p>

<p>"You are free to start whenever you wish," he said, in
conclusion; "I have given Hamas instructions that you may come and
go as you please. He will furnish you with a pass signal whereby
you may gain admission to the house. I wish you luck, but I think
that the best you will get will be a sword through
your heart. You are pitting yourself against the fiercest and most
unscrupulous gang of men in Zodanga."</p>

<p>"It is a chance that I shall have to take," I said. "Good
night."</p>

<p>I went to my quarters and told Zanda to lock herself in after I
had left and to open the door only in answer to a certain signal
which I imparted to her. She was only too glad to obey my
injunction.</p>

<p>When I was ready to leave the building, Hamas conducted me to
the outer doorway. Here he showed me a hidden button set in the
masonry and explained to me how I might use it to announce my
return.</p>

<p>I had gone but a short distance from the house of Fal Sivas when
I met Rapas the Ulsio. He seemed to have forgotten his anger toward
me, or else he was dissimulating, for he greeted me cordially.</p>

<p>"Where to?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Off for the evening," I replied.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, and what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I am going to the public house to get my things together and
store them, and then I shall look around for a little
entertainment."</p>

<p>"Suppose we get together later in the evening," he
suggested.</p>

<p>"All right," I replied; "when and where?"</p>

<p>"I will be through with my business about half after the eighth
zode. Suppose we meet at the eating-place I took you to
yesterday."</p>

<p>"All right," I said, "but do not wait long for me. I may get
tired of looking for pleasure and return to my quarters long before
that."</p>

<p>After leaving Rapas, I went to the public house where I had left
my things; and gathering them up I took them to the hangar on the
roof and stored them in my flier. This done, I returned to the
street and made my way toward the address that Fal Sivas had given
me.</p>

<p>The way led me through a brilliantly lighted shopping district
and into a gloomy section of the old town. It was a residential
district, but of the meaner sort. Some of the houses still rested
upon the ground, but most of them were elevated on their steel
shafts twenty or thirty feet above the pavement.</p>

<p>I heard laughter and song and occasional brawling&mdash;the
sounds of the night life of a great Martian city, and then I passed
on into another and seemingly deserted quarter.</p>

<p>I was approaching the headquarters of the assassins. I kept in
the shadows of the buildings, and I avoided the few people that
were upon the avenue by slipping into doorways and alleys. I did
not wish anyone to see me here who might be able afterward to
recognize or identify me. I was playing a game with Death, and I
must give him no advantage.</p>

<p>When finally I reached the building for which I was seeking, I
found a doorway on the opposite side of the avenue from which I
could observe my goal without being seen.</p>

<p>The farther moon cast a faint light upon the face of the
building but revealed to me nothing of importance.</p>

<p>At first, I could discern no lights in the building; but after
closer observation I saw a dim reflection behind the windows of the
upper floor. There, doubtless, was the meeting-place of the
assassins; but how was I to reach it?</p>

<p>That the doors to the building would be securely locked and
every approach to the meeting-place well guarded, seemed a foregone
conclusion.</p>

<p>There were balconies before the windows at several levels, and I
noticed particularly that there were three of these in front of
windows on the upper story. These balconies offered me a means of
ingress to the upper floor if I could but reach them.</p>

<p>The great strength and agility which the lesser gravitation of
Mars imparts to my earthly muscles might have sufficed to permit me
to climb the exterior of the building, except for the fact that
this particular building seemed to offer no foothold up to the
fifth story, above which its carved ornamentation commenced.</p>

<p>Mentally debating every possibility, by a process of
elimination, I was forced to the conclusion that my best approach
would be by way of the roof.</p>

<p>However, I determined to investigate the possibilities of the
main entrance on the ground floor; and was about to cross the
avenue for that purpose when I saw two men approaching. Stepping
back into the shadows of my hiding-place, I waited for them to
pass; but instead of doing so they stopped before the entrance to
the building I was watching. They were there but a moment when I
saw the door open and the men admitted. This incident convinced me
that someone was on guard at the main entrance to the building, and
that it would be futile for me to attempt to enter there.</p>

<p>There now remained to me only the roof as a means of entrance to
the building, and I quickly decided upon a plan to accomplish my
design.</p>

<p>Leaving my hiding-place, I quickly retraced my steps to the
public house in which I had been lodging, and went immediately to
the hangar on the roof.</p>

<p>The place was deserted, and I was soon at the controls of my
flier. I had now to run the chance of being stopped by a patrol
boat, but this was a more or less remote contingency; as, except in
cases of public emergency, little attention is paid to private
fliers within the walls of the city.</p>

<p>However, to be on the safe side, I flew low, following dark
avenues below the level of the roof tops; and in a short time I
reached the vicinity of the building that was my goal.</p>

<p>Here I rose above the level of the roofs and, having located the
building, settled gently to its roof.</p>

<p>The building had not been intended for this purpose, and there
was neither hangar nor mooring rings; but there are seldom high
winds on Mars, and this was a particularly quiet and windless
night.</p>

<p>Leaving the deck of the flier, I searched the roof for some
means of ingress to the building. I found a single small scuttle,
but it was strongly secured from within, and I could not budge
it&mdash;at least without making far too much noise.</p>

<p>Going to the edge of the building, overlooking the avenue, I
looked down upon one of the balconies directly below me. I could
have lowered myself from the eaves and, hanging by my hands,
dropped directly onto it; but here again I faced the danger of
attracting attention by the noise that I must make in
alighting.</p>

<p>I examined the face of the building just below me and discovered
that, in common with most Martian buildings, the carved
ornamentation offered handholds and footholds sufficient to my
need.</p>

<p>Slipping quietly over the eaves, I felt around with my toes
until I found a projection that would support me. Then, releasing
one hand, I felt for a new hold; and so, very slowly and carefully,
I descended to the balcony.</p>

<p>I had selected the place of my descent so that I was opposite an
unlighted window. For a moment I stood there listening. Somewhere
within the interior of the building I heard subdued voices. Then I
threw a leg over the sill and entered the darkness of the apartment
beyond.</p>

<p>Slowly I groped my way to a wall and then followed along it
until I came to a door at the end of the room opposite the window.
Stealthily I felt for the latch and lifted it. I pulled gently; the
door was not locked; it swung in toward me without noise.</p>

<p>Beyond the door was a corridor. It was very faintly illuminated,
as though by reflected light from an open doorway or from another
corridor. Now the sound of voices was more distinct. Silently I
crept in the direction from which they came.</p>

<p>Presently I came to another corridor running at right angles to
the one I was following. The light was stronger here, and I saw
that it came from an open doorway farther along the corridor which
I was about to enter. I was sure, however, that the voices did not
come from this room that I could see, as they would have been far
more clear and distinct had they.</p>

<p>My position was a precarious one. I knew nothing at all about
the interior arrangements of the building. I did not know along
which corridor its inmates came and went. If I were to approach the
open doorway, I might place myself in a position where discovery
would be certain.</p>

<p>I knew that I was dealing with killers, expert swordsmen all;
and I did not try to deceive myself into believing that I would be
any match for a dozen or more of them.</p>

<p>However, men who live by the sword are not unaccustomed to
taking chances, sometimes far more desperate chances than their
mission may seem to warrant.</p>

<p>Perhaps such was the case now, but I had come to Zodanga to
learn what I could about the guild of assassins headed by the
notorious Ur Jan; and now that fortune had placed me in a position
where I might gain a great deal of useful information, I had no
thought of retreating because a little danger confronted me.</p>

<p>Stealthily I crept forward, and at last I reached the door. Very
cautiously I surveyed the interior of the room beyond, as I moved,
inch by inch, across the doorway.</p>

<p>It was a small room, evidently an anteroom; and it was
untenanted. There was some furniture in it&mdash;a table, some
benches; and I noticed particularly an old-fashioned cupboard that
stood diagonally across one corner of the room, one of its sides
about a foot from the wall.</p>

<p>From where I stood in the doorway, I could now hear the voices
quite distinctly; and I was confident that the men I sought were in
the adjoining room just beyond.</p>

<p>I crept into the anteroom and approached the door at the
opposite end. Just to the left of the door was the cupboard that I
have mentioned.</p>

<p>I placed my ear close to the panels of the door in an effort to
overhear what was being said in the room beyond, but the words came
to me indistinct and muffled. This would never do. I could neither
see nor hear anything under these conditions.</p>

<p>I decided that I must find some other point of approach and was
turning to leave the room when I heard footsteps approaching along
the corridor. I was trapped!</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap4" id="chap4">IV. &mdash; DEATH BY NIGHT</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">On more than one occasion in my life have I been
in tight places, but it seemed to me at the time that I had seldom
before blundered into such a trap. The footsteps were approaching
rapidly along the corridor. I could tell by their sound that they
were made by more than one person.</p>

<p>If there were only two men, I might fight my way past them; but
the noise of the encounter would attract those in the room behind
me, and certainly any sort of a fight whatever would delay me long
enough so that those who were attracted by it would be upon me
before I could escape.</p>

<p>Escape! How could I escape if I were detected? Even if I could
reach the balcony, they would be directly behind me; and I could
not climb out of reach toward the roof before they could drag me
down.</p>

<p>My position seemed rather hopeless, and then my eye fell upon
the cupboard standing in the corner just beside me and the little
foot wide crack between it and the wall.</p>

<p>The footsteps were almost opposite the doorway. There was no
time to be lost. Quickly I slipped behind the cupboard and
waited.</p>

<p>Nor was I a moment too soon. The men in the corridor turned into
the room almost immediately, so soon, in fact, that it seemed to me
that they must have seen me; but evidently they had not, for they
crossed directly to the door to the inner chamber, which one of
them threw open.</p>

<p>From my hiding place I could see this man plainly and also into
the room beyond, while the shadow of the cupboard hid me from
detection.</p>

<p>What I saw beyond that door gave me something to think about.
There was a large room in the center of which was a great table,
around which were seated at least fifty men&mdash;fifty of the
toughest looking customers that I have ever seen gathered together.
At the head of the table was a huge man whom I knew at once to be
Ur Jan. He was a very large man, but well proportioned; and I could
tell at a glance that he must be a most formidable fighter.</p>

<p>The man who had thrown open the door I could see also, but I
could not see his companion or companions as they were hidden from
me by the cupboard.</p>

<p>Ur Jan had looked up as the door opened. "What now?" he
demanded. "Who have you with you?" and then, "Oh, I recognize
him."</p>

<p>"He has a message for you, Ur Jan," said the man at the door.
"He said it was a most urgent message, or I would not have brought
him here."</p>

<p>"Let him come in," said Ur Jan. "We will see what he wants, and
you return to your post."</p>

<p>"Go on in," said the man, turning to his companion behind him,
"and pray to your first ancestor that your message interests Ur
Jan; as otherwise you will not come out of that room again on your
own feet."</p>

<p>He stood aside and I saw a man pass him and enter the room. It
was Rapas the Rat.</p>

<p>Just seeing his back as he approached Ur Jan told me that he was
nervous and terrified. I wondered what could have brought him here,
for it was evident that he was not one of the guild. The same
question evidently puzzled Ur Jan, as his next words indicated.</p>

<p>"What does Rapas the Ulsio want here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I have come as a friend," replied Rapas. "I have brought word
to Ur Jan that he has long wanted."</p>

<p>"The best word that you could bring to me would be that someone
had slit your dirty throat," growled Ur Jan.</p>

<p>Rapas laughed&mdash;it was a rather weak and nervous laugh.</p>

<p>"The great Ur Jan likes his little joke," mumbled Rapas
meekly.</p>

<p>The brute at the head of the table leaped to his feet and
brought his clenched fist down heavily upon the solid sorapus wood
top.</p>

<p>"What makes you think I joke, you miserable little slit throat?
But you had better laugh while you can, for if you haven't some
important word for me, if you have come here where it is forbidden
that outsiders come, if you have interrupted this meeting for no
good reason, I'll put a new mouth in your throat; but you won't be
able to laugh through it."</p>

<p>"I just wanted to do you a favor," pleaded Rapas. "I was sure
that you would like to have the information that I bring, or I
would not have come."</p>

<p>"Well, quick! out with it, what is it?"</p>

<p>"I know who does Fal Sivas's killing."</p>

<p>Ur Jan laughed. It was rather a nasty laugh. "So do I," he
bellowed; "it is Rapas the Ulsio."</p>

<p>"No, no, Ur Jan," cried Rapas, "you wrong me. Listen, Ur
Jan."</p>

<p>"You have been seen entering and leaving the house of Fal
Sivas," accused the assassin chief. "You are in his employ; and for
what purpose would he employ such as you, unless it was to do his
killing for him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I went to the house of Fal Sivas. I went there often. He
employed me as his bodyguard, but I only took the position so that
I might spy upon him. Now that I have learned what I went there to
learn, I have come straight to you."</p>

<p>"Well, what did you learn?"</p>

<p>"I have told you. I have learned who does his killing."</p>

<p>"Well, who is it, if it isn't you?"</p>

<p>"He has in his employ a stranger to Zodanga&mdash;a panthan
named Vandor. It is this man who does the killing."</p>

<p>I could not repress a smile. Every man thinks that he is a great
character reader; and when something like this occurs to
substantiate his belief, he has reason to be pleased; and the more
so because few men are really good judges of character, and it is
therefore very seldom that one of us is open to self congratulation
on this score.</p>

<p>I had never trusted Rapas, and from the first I had set him down
as a sneak and a traitor. Evidently he was all these.</p>

<p>Ur Jan glowered at him skeptically. "And why do you bring me
this information? You are not my friend. You are not one of my
people, and as far as I know you are the friend of none of us."</p>

<p>"But I wish to be," begged Rapas. "I risked my life to get this
information for you because I want to join the guild and serve
under the great Ur Jan. If that came to pass, it would be the
proudest day of my life. Ur Jan is the greatest man in
Zodanga&mdash;he is the greatest man on all Barsoom. I want to
serve him, and I will serve him faithfully."</p>

<p>All men are susceptible to flattery, and oftentimes the more
ignorant they are, the more susceptible. Ur Jan was no exception.
One could almost see him preening himself. He squared his great
shoulders and threw out his chest.</p>

<p>"Well," he said in a milder voice, "we'll think it over. Perhaps
we can use you, but first you will have to arrange it so that we
can dispose of this Vandor." He glanced quickly around the table.
"Do any of you men know him?"</p>

<p>There was a chorus of denials&mdash;no one admitted to knowing
me.</p>

<p>"I can point him out to you," said Rapas the Ulsio. "I can point
him out this very night."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" asked Ur Jan.</p>

<p>"Because I have an engagement to meet him later on at an
eating-place that he frequents."</p>

<p>"Not a bad idea," said Ur Jan. "At what time is this
meeting?"</p>

<p>"About half after the eighth zode," replied Rapas.</p>

<p>Ur Jan glanced quickly around the table. "Uldak," he said, "you
go with Rapas; and don't return while this Vandor still lives."</p>

<p>I got a good look at Uldak as Ur Jan singled him out; and as I
watched him come toward the door with Rapas on his way to kill me,
I fixed every detail of the man's outward appearance indelibly upon
my mind, even to his carriage as he walked; and though I saw him
for but a moment then, I knew that I should never forget him.</p>

<p>As the two men left the larger chamber and crossed the anteroom
in which I was concealed, Rapas explained to his companion the plan
that he had in mind.</p>

<p>"I will take you now and show you the location of the eating-place
in which I am to meet him. Then you can return later and you
will know that the man who is with me is the man whom you
seek."</p>

<p>I could not but smile as the two men turned into the corridor
and passed out of earshot. What would they and Ur Jan have thought,
had they known that the object of their criminal purpose was within
a few yards of them?</p>

<p>I wanted to follow Rapas and Uldak, for I had a plan that it
would have been amusing to carry out; but I could not escape from
behind the cupboard without passing directly in front of the
doorway leading into the room where sat Ur Jan and his fifty
assassins.</p>

<p>It looked as though I would have to wait until the meeting ended
and the company had dispersed before I could make my way to the
roof and my flier.</p>

<p>Although I was inclined to chafe at the thought of this enforced
inactivity, I nevertheless took advantage of the open door to
familiarize myself with the faces of all of the assassins that I
could see. Some of them sat with their backs toward me, but even
these occasionally revealed a glimpse of a profile.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that I took early advantage of this opportunity
to implant the faces of my enemies upon my memory, for but a moment
or two after Rapas and Uldak had left the room, Ur Jan looked up
and noticed the open door and directed one of the assassins sitting
near it to close it.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the lock clicked when I was out from behind the
cupboard and into the corridor.</p>

<p>I saw no one and heard no sound in the direction that the
assassins had used in coming into and going from the anteroom; and
as my way led in the opposite direction, I had little fear of being
apprehended. I moved rapidly toward the apartment through the
window of which I had entered the building, as the success of the
plan I had in mind depended upon my being able to reach the
eating-place ahead of Rapas and Uldak.</p>

<p>I reached the balcony and clambered to the roof of the building
without mishap, and very shortly thereafter I was running my flier
into the hangar on the roof of the public house where I stored it.
Descending to the street, I made my way to the vicinity of the
eating-place to which Rapas was conducting Uldak, reasonably
certain that I should arrive there before that precious pair.</p>

<p>I found a place where I could watch the entrance in comparative
safety from discovery, and there I waited. My vigil was not of long
duration, for presently I saw the two approaching. They stopped at
the intersection of two avenues a short distance from the place,
and after Rapas had pointed it out to Uldak, the two separated,
Rapas continuing on in the direction of the public house where I
had first met him, while Uldak turned back into the avenue along
which they had come from the rendezvous of the assassins.</p>

<p>It still lacked half a zode of the time that I was to meet
Rapas, and for the moment at least I was not concerned with
him&mdash;my business was with Uldak.</p>

<p>As soon as Rapas had passed me upon the opposite side of the
street, I came out of my hiding place and walked rapidly in the
direction that Uldak had taken.</p>

<p>As I reached the intersection of the two streets, I saw the
assassin a little distance ahead of me. He was walking slowly,
evidently merely killing time until he might be certain that the
hour had arrived when I was to meet Rapas at the eating-place.</p>

<p>Keeping to the opposite side of the street, I followed the man
for a considerable distance until he entered a quarter that seemed
to be deserted&mdash;I did not wish an audience for what I was about to
do.</p>

<p>Crossing the avenue, I increased my gait; and the distance
between us rapidly lessened until I was but a few paces behind him.
I had moved very quietly, and he was not aware that anyone was near
him. Only a few paces separated us when I spoke.</p>

<p>"You are looking for me?" I inquired.</p>

<p>He wheeled instantly, and his right hand flew to the hilt of his
sword. He eyed me narrowly. "Who are you?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have made a mistake," I said; "you are Uldak, are you
not?"</p>

<p>"What of it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>I shrugged. "Nothing much, except that I understand that you
have been sent to kill me. My name is Vandor."</p>

<p>As I ceased speaking, I whipped out my sword. He looked utterly
astonished as I announced my identity, but there was nothing for
him to do but defend himself, and as he drew his weapon he gave a
nasty little laugh.</p>

<p>"You must be a fool," he said. "Anyone who is not a fool would
run away and hide if he knew that Uldak was looking for him."</p>

<p>Evidently the man thought himself a great swordsman. I might
have confused him by revealing my identity to him, for it might
take the heart out of any Barsoomian warrior to know that he was
facing John Carter; but I did not tell him. I merely engaged him
and felt him out for a moment to ascertain if he could make good
his boast.</p>

<p>He was, indeed, an excellent swordsman and, as I had expected,
tricky and entirely unscrupulous. Most of these assassins are
entirely without honor; they are merely killers.</p>

<p>At the very first he fought fairly enough because he thought
that he could easily overcome me; but when he saw that he could
not, he tried various shady expedients and finally he attempted the
unpardonable thing&mdash;with his free hand, he sought to draw his
pistol.</p>

<p>Knowing his kind, I had naturally expected something of the
sort; and in the instant that his fingers closed upon the butt of
the weapon I struck his sword aside and brought the point of my own
heavily upon his left wrist, nearly severing his hand.</p>

<p>With a scream of rage and pain, he fell back; and then I was
upon him in earnest.</p>

<p>He yelled for mercy now and cried that he was not Uldak; that I
had made a mistake, and begged me to let him go. Then the coward
turned to flee, and I was forced to do that which I most disliked
to do; but if I were to carry out my plan I could not let him live,
and so I leaped close and ran my sword through his heart from
behind.</p>

<p>Uldak lay dead upon his face.</p>

<p>As I drew my sword from his body, I looked quickly about me. No
one was within sight. I turned the man over upon his back and with
the point of my sword made a cross upon his breast above his
heart.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap5" id="chap5">V. &mdash; THE BRAIN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Rapas was waiting for me when I entered the
eating- place. He looked very self-satisfied and contented.</p>

<p>"You are right on time," he said. "Did you find anything to
amuse you in the night life of Zodanga?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I assured him. "I enjoyed myself immensely. And you?"</p>

<p>"I spent a most profitable evening. I made excellent
connections; and, my dear Vandor, I did not forget you."</p>

<p>"How nice of you," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, you shall have reason to remember this evening as long as
you live," he exclaimed, and then he burst into laughter.</p>

<p>"You must tell me about it," I said.</p>

<p>"No, not now," he replied, "It must remain a secret for a time.
You will know all about it soon enough, and now let us eat. It is
my treat tonight. I shall pay for everything."</p>

<p>The miserable rat of a man seemed to have swelled with
importance now that he felt himself almost a full-fledged member of
Ur Jan's guild of assassins.</p>

<p>"Very well," I said, "this shall be your treat," for I thought
it would add to my enjoyment of the joke to let the poor fool foot
the bill, and to make it still more amusing I ordered the most
expensive dishes that I could find.</p>

<p>When I had entered the eating-place, Rapas had already seated
himself facing the entrance; and he was continually glancing at it.
Whenever anyone entered, I could see the look of expectation on his
face change to one of disappointment.</p>

<p>We spoke of various unimportant things as we ate; and as the
meal progressed, I could not but note his growing impatience and
concern.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Rapas?" I inquired after a while. "You seem
suddenly nervous. You are always watching the entrance. Are you
expecting someone?"</p>

<p>He got himself in hand then, very quickly; but he cast a single
searching glance at me through narrowed lids. "No, no," he said, "I
was expecting no one; but I have enemies. It is always necessary
for me to be watchful."</p>

<p>His explanation was plausible enough, though I knew of course
that it was not the right one. I could have told him that he was
watching for someone who would never come, but I did not.</p>

<p>Rapas dragged the meal out as long as he could, and the later it
grew, the more nervous he became and the more often his glance
remained upon the entrance. At last I made a move to go, but he
detained me. "Let us stop a little longer," he said. "You are in no
hurry, are you?"</p>

<p>"I should be getting back," I replied. "Fal Sivas may require my
services."</p>

<p>"No," he told me, "not before morning."</p>

<p>"But I must have some sleep," I insisted.</p>

<p>"You will get plenty of sleep," he said; "don't worry."</p>

<p>"Well, if I am going to, I had better start for bed," I said,
and with that I arose.</p>

<p>He tried to detain me, but I had extracted about all the
pleasure out of the evening that I thought it held for me, and so I
insisted upon leaving.</p>

<p>Reluctantly he arose from the table. "I will walk a little way
with you," he said.</p>

<p>We were near the door leading to the avenue when two men
entered. They were discussing something rather excitedly as they
greeted the proprietor.</p>

<p>"The Warlord's agents are at work again," said one of them.</p>

<p>"How is that?" asked the proprietor.</p>

<p>"They have just found the body of one of Ur Jan's assassins in
the Avenue of the Green Throat&mdash;the cross of the Warlord was
above his heart."</p>

<p>"More power to the Warlord," said the proprietor. "Zodanga would
be better off if we were rid of all of them."</p>

<p>"By what name was the dead man known?" asked Rapas, with
considerably more concern, I imagine, than he would have cared to
reveal.</p>

<p>"Why, some man in the crowd said that he believed his name was
Uldak," replied one of the two men who had brought the news.</p>

<p>Rapas paled.</p>

<p>"Was he a friend of yours, Rapas?" I asked.</p>

<p>The Ulsio started. "Oh, no," he said. "I did not know him. Let
us be going."</p>

<p>Together we walked out into the avenue and started in the
direction of the House of Fal Sivas. We walked shoulder to shoulder
through the lighted district near the eating-place. Rapas was very
quiet and seemed nervous. I watched him out of the corner of my eye
and tried to read his mind, but he was on guard and had closed it
against me.</p>

<p>Oftentimes I have an advantage over Martians in that I can read
their minds, though they can never read mine. Why that is, I do not
know. Mind reading is a very commonplace accomplishment on Mars,
but to safeguard themselves against its dangers, all Martians have
cultivated the ability to close their minds to others at
will&mdash;a defense mechanism of such long standing as to have
become almost a universal characteristic; so that only occasionally
can one be caught off his guard.</p>

<p>As we entered the darker avenues, however, it became apparent
that Rapas was trying to drop behind me; and then I did not have to
read his mind to know what was in it&mdash;Uldak had failed, and
now The Rat had an opportunity to cover himself with glory and win
the esteem of Ur Jan by carrying out the assignment of Uldak.</p>

<p>If a man has a sense of humor, a situation such as this can be
very enjoyable, as, indeed, it was to me. Here I was walking along
a dark avenue with a man who intended to murder me at the first
opportunity, and it was necessary for me to thwart his plans
without letting him know that I suspected them; for I did not want
to kill Rapas the Ulsio, at least not at present. I felt that I
could make use of him in one way or another without his ever
suspecting that he was aiding me.</p>

<p>"Come," I said, at last, "why do you lag? Are you getting
tired?" And I linked my left arm through his sword arm, and thus we
continued on toward the house of Fal Sivas.</p>

<p>After a short distance, at the intersection of two avenues,
Rapas disengaged himself. "I am leaving you here," he said; "I am
not going back to the house of Fal Sivas tonight."</p>

<p>"Very well, my friend," I said; "but I shall be seeing you soon
again, I hope."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "soon."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow night, possibly," I suggested, "or if not tomorrow
night, the night after. Whenever I am at liberty, I shall come to
the eating-house; and perhaps I shall find you there."</p>

<p>"Very well," he said; "I eat there every night."</p>

<p>"May you sleep well, Rapas."</p>

<p>"May you sleep well, Vandor." Then he turned into the avenue at
our left, and I proceeded on my way.</p>

<p>I thought that he might follow me, but he did not, and so I came
at last to the house of Fal Sivas.</p>

<p>Hamas admitted me, and after passing a few words with him I went
directly to my quarters where, in answer to my signal, Zanda
admitted me.</p>

<p>The girl told me that the house had been very quiet during the
night, and that no one had disturbed her or attempted to enter our
quarters. She had prepared my sleeping silks and furs; and, as I
was rather tired, I soon sought them.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *

<p>Immediately after breakfast the next morning, I went on duty
again at the door of Fal Sivas's study. I had been there but a
short time when he summoned me to his person.</p>

<p>"What of last night?" he asked. "What luck did you have? I see
that you are here alive; so I take it that you did not succeed in
reaching the meeting-place of the assassins."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I did," I told him. "I was in the room next to
them and saw them all."</p>

<p>"What did you learn?"</p>

<p>"Not much. When the door was closed, I could hear nothing. It
was open only a short time."</p>

<p>"What did you hear while it was open?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They knew that you had employed me as your body guard."</p>

<p>"What!" he demanded. "How could they have known that?"</p>

<p>I shook my head. "There must be a leak," I told him.</p>

<p>"A traitor!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>I did not tell him about Rapas. I was afraid that he would have
him killed, and I did not want him killed while he might be of use
to me.</p>

<p>"What else did you hear?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Ur Jan ordered that I be killed."</p>

<p>"You must be careful," said Fal Sivas. "Perhaps you had better
not go out again at night."</p>

<p>"I can take care of myself," I replied, "and I can be of more
service if I can get about at night and talk to people on the
outside than I can by remaining cooped up here when I am off
duty."</p>

<p>He nodded. "I guess you are right," he said, and then for a
moment he sat in deep thought. Finally he raised his head. "I have
it!" he exclaimed. "I know who the traitor is."</p>

<p>"Yes?" I asked politely.</p>

<p>"It is Rapas the Ulsio&mdash;Ulsio! He is well named."</p>

<p>"You are sure?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It could be no one else," replied Fal Sivas emphatically. "No
one else has left the premises but you two since you came. But we
will put an end to that as soon as he returns. When he comes back,
you will destroy him. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>"It is a command," he said; "see that it is obeyed." For some
time he sat in silence, and I could see that he was studying me
intently. At last he spoke. "You have a smattering of the sciences
I judge from the fact of your interest in the books in your
quarters."</p>

<p>"Only a smattering," I assured him.</p>

<p>"I need such a man as you," he said, "if I could only find
someone whom I might trust. But who can one trust?" He seemed to be
thinking aloud. "I am seldom wrong," he continued musingly. "I read
Rapas like a book. I knew that he was mean and ignorant and at
heart a traitor."</p>

<p>He wheeled suddenly upon me. "But you are different. I believe
that I can take a chance with you, but if you fail me&mdash;" he
stood up and faced me, and I never saw such a malevolent expression
upon a human face before. "If you fail me, Vandor, you shall die
such a death as only the mind of Fal Sivas can conceive."</p>

<p>I could not help but smile. "I can die but once," I said.</p>

<p>"But you can be a long time at the dying, if it is done
scientifically." But now he had relaxed, and his tone was a little
bantering. I could imagine that Fal Sivas might enjoy seeing an
enemy die horribly.</p>

<p>"I am going to take you into my confidence&mdash;a little just a
little," he said.</p>

<p>"Remember that I have not asked it," I replied, "that I have not
sought to learn any of your secrets."</p>

<p>"The risk will be mutual," he said, "your life against my
secrets. Come, I have something to show you."</p>

<p>He led me from the room, along the corridor past my quarters,
and up the ramp to the forbidden level above. Here we passed
through a magnificently appointed suite of living quarters and then
through a little door hidden behind hangings, and came at last into
an enormous loft that extended upward to the roof of the building,
evidently several levels above us.</p>

<p>Supported by scaffolding and occupying nearly the entire length
of the enormous chamber, was the strangest looking craft that I
have ever seen. The nose was ellipsoidal; and from the greatest
diameter of the craft, which was just back of the nose, it sloped
gradually to a point at the stem.</p>

<p>"There it is," said Fal Sivas, proudly; "the work of a lifetime,
and almost completed."</p>

<p>"An entirely new type of ship," I commented. "In what respect is
it superior to present types?"</p>

<p>"It is built to achieve results that no other ship can achieve,"
replied Fal Sivas. "It is designed to attain speed beyond the
wildest imaginings of man. It will travel routes that no man or
ship has ever traveled.</p>

<p>"In that craft, Vandor, I can visit Thuria and Cluros. I can
travel the far reaches of space to other planets."</p>

<p>"Marvellous," I said.</p>

<p>"But that is not all. You see that it is built for speed. I can
assure you that it is built to withstand the most terrific
pressure, that it is insulated against the extremes of heat and
cold. Perhaps, Vandor, other inventors could have accomplished the
same end. In fact, I believe Gar Nal has already done so, but there
is only one man upon Barsoom, doubtless there is only one brain in
the entire Solar System, that could have done what Fal Sivas has
done. I have given that seemingly insensate mechanism a brain with
which to think. I have perfected my mechanical brain, Vandor, and
with just a little more time, just a few refinements, I can send
this ship out alone; and it will go where I wish it to go and come
back again.</p>

<p>"Doubtless, you think that impossible. You think Fal Sivas is
mad; but look! Watch closely."</p>

<p>He centered his gaze upon the nose of the strange-looking craft,
and presently I saw it rise slowly from its scaffolding for about
ten feet and hang there poised in mid-air. Then it elevated its
nose a few feet, and then its tail, and finally it settled again
and rested evenly upon its scaffolding.</p>

<p>I was certainly astonished. Never in all my life had I seen
anything so marvellous, nor did I seek to hide my admiration from
Fal Sivas.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "I did not even have to speak to it. The
mechanical mind that I have installed in the ship responds to
thought waves. I merely have to impart to it the impulse of the
thought that I wish it to act upon. The mechanical brain then
functions precisely as my brain would, and directs the mechanism
that operates the craft precisely as the brain of the pilot would
direct his hand to move levers, press buttons, open or close
throttles.</p>

<p>"Vandor, it has been a long and terrible battle that I have had
to wage to perfect this marvellous mechanism. I have been compelled
to do things which would revolt the finer sensibilities of mankind;
but I believe that it has all been well worthwhile. I believe that
my greatest achievement warrants all that it has cost in lives and
suffering.</p>

<p>"I, too, have paid a price. It has taken something out of me
that can never be replaced. I believe, Vandor, that it has robbed
me of every human instinct. Except that I am mortal, I am as much a
creature of cold insensate formulas as that thing which you see
resting there before you. Sometimes, because of that, I hate it;
and yet I would die for it. I would see others die for it,
countless others, in the future, as I have in the past. It must
live. It is the greatest achievement of the human mind."</p>

<h2><a name="chap6" id="chap6">VI. &mdash; THE SHIP</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Every one of us, I believe, is possessed of two
characters. Oftentimes they are so much alike that this duality is
not noticeable, but again there is a divergence so great that we
have the phenomenon of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in a single
individual. The brief illuminating self-revealment of Fal Sivas
suggested that he might be an example of such wide divergence in
character.</p>

<p>He seemed immediately to regret this emotional outburst and
turned again to an explanation of his invention.</p>

<p>"Would you like to see the inside of it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Very much," I replied.</p>

<p>He concentrated his attention again upon the nose of the ship,
and presently a door in its side opened and a rope ladder was
lowered to the floor of the room.</p>

<p>It was an uncanny procedure&mdash;just as though ghostly hands
had performed the work.</p>

<p>Fal Sivas motioned me to precede him up the ladder. It was a
habit of his to see that no one ever got behind him that bespoke
the nervous strain under which he lived, always in fear of
assassination.</p>

<p>The doorway led directly into a small, comfortably, even
luxuriously furnished cabin.</p>

<p>"The stern is devoted to storerooms where food may be carried
for long voyages," explained Fal Sivas. "Also aft are the motors,
the oxygen and water-generating machines, and the temperature-
regulating plant. Forward is the control room. I believe that that
will interest you greatly," and he motioned me to precede him
through a small door in the forward bulkhead of the cabin.</p>

<p>The interior of the control room, which occupied the entire nose
of the ship, was a mass of intricate mechanical and electrical
devices.</p>

<p>On either side of the nose were two large, round ports in which
were securely set thick slabs of crystal.</p>

<p>From the exterior of the ship these two ports appeared like the
huge eyes of some gigantic monster; and, in truth, this was the
purpose they served.</p>

<p>Fal Sivas called my attention to a small, round metal object
about the size of a large grapefruit that was fastened securely
just above and between the two eyes. From it ran a large cable
composed of a vast number of very small insulated wires. I could
see that some of these wires connected with the many devices in the
control room, and that others were carried through conduits to the
aft of the craft.</p>

<p>Fal Sivas reached up and laid a hand almost affectionately upon
the spherical object to which he had called my attention. "This,"
he said, "is the brain." Then he called my attention to two spots,
one in the exact center of each crystal of the forward ports. I had
not noticed them at first, but now I saw that they were ground
differently from the balance of the crystals.</p>

<p>"These lenses," explained Fal Sivas, "focus upon this aperture
in the lower part of the brain," and he called my attention to a
small hole at the base of the sphere, "that they may transmit to
the brain what the eyes of the ship see. The brain then functions
mechanically precisely as the human brain does, except with greater
accuracy."</p>

<p>"It is incredible!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"But, nevertheless, true," he replied. "In one respect, however,
the brain lacks human power. It cannot originate thoughts. Perhaps
that is just as well, for could it, I might have loosed upon myself
and Barsoom an insensate monster that could wreak incalculable
havoc before it could be destroyed, for this ship is equipped with
high-power radium rifles which the brain has the power to discharge
with far more deadly accuracy than may be achieved by man."</p>

<p>"I saw no rifles," I said.</p>

<p>"No," he replied. "They are encased in the bulkheads, and
nothing of them is visible except small round holes in the hull of
the ship. But, as I was saying, the one weakness of the mechanical
brain is the very thing that makes it so effective for the use of
man. Before it can function, it must be charged by human
thought-waves. In other words, I must project into the mechanism
the originating thoughts that are the food for its functioning.</p>

<p>"For example, I charge it with the thought that it is to rise
straight up ten feet, pause there for a couple of seconds, and then
come to rest again upon its scaffolding.</p>

<p>"To carry the idea into a more complex domain, I might impart to
it the actuating thought that it is to travel to Thuria, seek a
suitable landing place, and come to the ground. I could carry this
idea even further, warning it that if it were attacked it should
repel its enemies with rifle fire and maneuver so as to avoid
disaster, returning immediately to Barsoom, rather than suffer
destruction.</p>

<p>"It is also equipped with cameras, with which I could instruct
it to take pictures while it was on the surface of Thuria."</p>

<p>"And you think it will do these things, Fal Sivas?" I asked.</p>

<p>He growled at me impatiently. "Of course it will. Just a few
more days and I will have the last detail perfected. It is a minor
matter of motor gearing with which I am not wholly satisfied."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I can help you there," I said. "I have learned several
tricks in gearing during my long life in the air."</p>

<p>He became immediately interested and directed me to return to
the floor of his hangar. He followed me down, and presently we were
poring over the drawings of his motor.</p>

<p>I soon found what was wrong with it and how it might be
improved. Fal Sivas was delighted. He immediately recognized the
value of the points I had made.</p>

<p>"Come with me," he said; "we will start work on these changes at
once."</p>

<p>He led me to a door at one end of the hangar and, throwing it
open, followed me into the room beyond.</p>

<p>Here, and in a series of adjoining rooms, I saw the most
marvellously equipped mechanical and electrical shops that I have
ever seen; and I saw something else, something that made me shudder
as I considered the malignity of this man's abnormal obsession for
secrecy in the development of his inventions.</p>

<p>The shops were well manned by mechanics, and every one of them
was manacled to his bench or to his machine. Their complexions were
pasty from long confinement, and in their eyes was the hopelessness
of despair.</p>

<p>Fal Sivas must have noted the expression upon my face; for he
said quite suddenly, and apropos of nothing else than my own
thoughts, "I have to do it, Vandor; I cannot take the risk of one
of them escaping and revealing my secrets to the world before I am
ready."</p>

<p>"And when will that time come?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Never," he exclaimed, with a snarl. "When Fal Sivas dies, his
secrets die with him. While he lives, they will make him the most
powerful man in the universe. Why, even John Carter, Warlord of
Mars, will have to bend the knee to Fal Sivas."</p>

<p>"And these poor devils, then, will remain here all their lives?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"They should be proud and happy," he said, "for are they not
dedicating themselves to the most glorious achievement that the
mind of man has ever conceived?"</p>

<p>"There is nothing, Fal Sivas, more glorious than freedom," I
told him.</p>

<p>"Keep your silly sentimentalism to yourself," he snapped. "There
is no place for sentiment in the house of Fal Sivas. If you are to
be of value to me, you must think only of the goal, forgetting the
means whereby we attain it."</p>

<p>Well, I saw that I could accomplish nothing for myself or his
poor victims by antagonizing him, and so I deferred with a shrug.
"Of course, you are right, Fal Sivas," I agreed.</p>

<p>"That is better," he said, and then he called a foreman and
together we explained the changes that were to be made in the
motor.</p>

<p>As we turned away and left the chamber, Fal Sivas sighed. "Ah,"
he said, "if I could but produce my mechanical brain in quantities,
I could do away with all these stupid humans. One brain in each
room could perform all the operations that it now takes from five
to twenty men to perform and perform them better, too&mdash;much
better."</p>

<p>Fal Sivas went to his laboratory on the same level then, and
told me that he would not require me for a while but that I should
remain in my quarters and keep the door open, seeing that no
unauthorized person passed along the corridor toward the ramp
leading to his laboratories.</p>

<p>When I reached my quarters, I found Zanda polishing the metal on
an extra set of harness that she said Fal Sivas had sent to me for
my use.</p>

<p>"I was talking with Hamas's slave a little while ago," she
remarked, presently. "She says that Hamas is worried about
you."</p>

<p>"And why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He thinks that the master has taken a fancy to you, and he
fears for his own authority. He has been a very powerful man here
for many years."</p>

<p>I laughed. "I don't aspire to his laurels," I told her.</p>

<p>"But he does not know that," said Zanda. "He would not believe
it, if he were told. He is your enemy and a very powerful enemy. I
just wanted to warn you."</p>

<p>"Thanks, Zanda," I said. "I shall be watchful of him, but I have
a great many enemies; and I am so accustomed to having them that
another, more or less, makes little difference to me."</p>

<p>"Hamas may make a great difference to you," she said. "He has
the ear of Fal Sivas. I am so worried about you, Vandor."</p>

<p>"You mustn't worry; but if it will make you feel any better, do
not forget that you have the ear of Hamas through his slave. You
can let her know that I have no ambition to displace Hamas."</p>

<p>"That is a good idea," she said, "but I am afraid that it will
not accomplish much; and if I were you, the next time I went out of
the building, I should not return. You went last night, so I
suppose that you are free to come and go as you will."</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "I am."</p>

<p>"Just as long as Fal Sivas does not take you to the floor above
and reveal any of his secrets to you, you will probably be allowed
to go out, unless Hamas makes it a point to prevail upon Fal Sivas
to take that privilege away from you."</p>

<p>"But I have already been to the level above," I said, "and I
have seen many of the wonders of Fal Sivas's inventions."</p>

<p>She gave little cry of alarm, then. "Oh, Vandor, you are lost!"
she cried. "Now you will never leave this terrible place."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I shall leave it tonight, Zanda," I told her.
"Fal Sivas has agreed that I should do so."</p>

<p>She shook her head. "I cannot understand it," she said, "and I
shall not believe it until after you have gone."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *

<p>Toward evening Fal Sivas sent for me. He said that he wanted to
talk to me about some further changes in the gearing of the motor,
and so I did not get out that night, and the next day he had me in
the shops directing the mechanics who were working on the new
gears, and again he made it impossible for me to leave the
premises.</p>

<p>In one way or another, he prevented it night after night; and
though he didn't actually refuse permission, I began to feel that I
was, indeed, a prisoner.</p>

<p>However, I was much interested in the work in the shops and did
not mind much whether I went out or not.</p>

<p>Ever since I had seen Fal Sivas's wonder-craft and had listened
to his explanation of the marvellous mechanical brain that
controlled it, it had been constantly in my thoughts. I saw in it
all the possibilities of power for good or evil that Fal Sivas had
visualized, and I was intrigued by the thought of what the man who
controlled it could accomplish.</p>

<p>If that man had the welfare of humanity at heart, his invention
might prove a priceless boon to Barsoom; but I feared that Fal
Sivas was too selfish and too mad for power to use his invention
solely for the public good.</p>

<p>Such meditation naturally led me to wonder if another than Fal
Sivas could control the brain. The speculation intrigued me, and I
determined to ascertain at the first opportunity if the insensate
thing would respond to my will.</p>

<p>That afternoon Fal Sivas was in his laboratory, and I was
working in the shops with the poor manacled artisans. The great
ship lay in the adjoining room. Now, I thought, presented as good a
time as any to make my experiment.</p>

<p>The creatures in the room with me were all slaves. Furthermore,
they hated Fal Sivas; so it made no difference to them what I
did.</p>

<p>I had been kind to them and had even encouraged them to hope,
though they could not believe that there was any hope. They had
seen too many of their number die in their chains to permit them to
entertain a thought of escape. They were apathetic in all matters,
and I doubt that any of them noticed when I left the shop and
entered the hangar where the ship rested upon its scaffolding.</p>

<p>Closing the door behind me, I approached the nose of the craft
and focused my thoughts upon the brain within. I imparted to it the
will to rise from its scaffolding as I had seen Fal Sivas cause it
to do and then to settle down again in its place. I thought that if
I could cause it to do that, I could cause it to do anything that
Fal Sivas could.</p>

<p>I am not easily excited; but I must confess that my every nerve
was tense as I watched that great thing above me, wondering if it
would respond to those invisible thought-waves that I was
projecting into it.</p>

<p>Concentrating thus upon this one thing naturally curtailed the
other activities of my mind, but even so I had visions of what I
might accomplish if my experiment proved successful.</p>

<p>I presume that I had been there but a moment, yet it seemed a
long while; and then slowly the great craft rose as though lifted
by an invisible hand. It hovered for a moment ten feet above its
scaffolding, and then it settled down to rest again.</p>

<p>As it did so, I heard a noise behind me; and, turning quickly, I
saw Fal Sivas standing in the doorway of the shop.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap7" id="chap7">VII. &mdash; THE FACE IN THE
DOORWAY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Nonchalance is a corollary of poise. I was
thankful at that moment that the poise gene of some ancient
forebear had been preserved in my line and handed down to me.
Whether or not Fal Sivas had entered the room before the ship came
to rest again upon its scaffolding, I did not know. If not, he had
only missed the sight by a matter of a split second. My best
momentary defense was to act on the assumption that he had not
seen, and this I determined to do.</p>

<p>Standing there in the doorway, the old inventor was eyeing me
sternly. "What are you doing in here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"The invention fascinates me; it intrigues my imagination," I
replied. "I stepped in from the shop to have another look at it.
You had not told me that I should not do so."</p>

<p>He knitted his brows in thought. "Perhaps, I didn't," he said at
last; "but I tell you now. No one is supposed to enter this room,
unless by my express command."</p>

<p>"I will bear that in mind," I said.</p>

<p>"It will be well for you if you do, Vandor."</p>

<p>I walked then toward the door where he stood, with the intention
of returning to the shop; but Fal Sivas barred my way.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," he said, "perhaps you have been wondering if
the brain would respond to your thought-impulses."</p>

<p>"Frankly, I have," I replied.</p>

<p>I wondered how much he knew, how much he had seen. Perhaps he
was playing with me, secure in his own knowledge; or perhaps he was
merely suspicious and was seeking confirmation of his suspicion.
However that might be, I was determined not to be trapped out of my
assumption that he had not seen and did not know.</p>

<p>"You were not, by any chance, attempting to see if it would
respond?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Who, other than a stupid dolt, once having seen this invention,
would not naturally harbor such a thought?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Quite right, quite right," he admitted; "it would only be
natural, but did you succeed?" The pupils of his eyes contracted;
his lids narrowed to two ominous slits. He seemed to be trying to
bore into my soul; and, unquestionably, he was attempting to read
my mind; but that, I knew, he could not accomplish.</p>

<p>I waved my hand in the direction of the ship. "Has it moved?" I
asked with a laugh.</p>

<p>I thought that I saw just a faint hint of relief in his
expression, and I felt sure then that he had not seen.</p>

<p>"It would be interesting, however, to know whether the mind of
another than myself could control the mechanism," he said. "Suppose
you try it."</p>

<p>"It would be a most interesting experiment. I should be glad to
do so. What shall I try to have it do?"</p>

<p>"It will have to be an original idea of your own," he told me;
"for if it is my idea, and I impart it to you, we cannot be
definitely sure whether the impulse that actuates it originated in
your brain or mine."</p>

<p>"Is there no danger that I might unintentionally harm it?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"I think not," he replied. "It is probably difficult for you to
realize. That ship sees and reasons. Of course, its vision and
its mental functioning are purely mechanical but none the less
accurate. In fact, I should rather say, because of that, more
accurate. You might attempt to will the ship to leave the room. It
cannot do so because the great doors through which it will
eventually pass out of this building are closed and locked. It
might approach the wall of the building, but the eyes would see
that it could not pass through without damage; or, rather, the eyes
would see the obstacle, transmit the impression to the brain, and
the brain would reason to a logical conclusion. It would,
therefore, stop the ship or, more likely, cause it to turn the nose
about so that the eyes could seek a safe avenue of exit. But let us
see what you can do."</p>

<p>I had no intention of letting Fal Sivas know that I could
operate his invention, if he did not already know it; and so I
tried to keep my thoughts as far from it as possible. I recalled
football games that I had seen, a five-ring circus, and the
Congress of Beauties on the Midway of the 1893 Chicago World's
Fair. In fact, I tried to think of anything under the sun rather
than Fal Sivas and his mechanical brain.</p>

<p>Finally, I turned to him with a gesture of resignation. "Nothing
seems to happen," I said.</p>

<p>He appeared vastly relieved. "You are a man of intelligence," he
said. "If it will not obey you, it is reasonably safe to assume
that it will obey no one but me."</p>

<p>For several moments he was lost in thought, and then he
straightened up and looked at me, and his eyes burned with demoniac
fire. "I can be master of a world," he said; "perhaps I can even be
master of the universe."</p>

<p>"With that?" I asked, nodding toward the ship.</p>

<p>"With the idea that it symbolizes," he replied; "with the idea
of an inanimate object energized by scientific means and motivated
by a mechanical brain. If I but had the means to do so&mdash;the
wealth&mdash;I could manufacture these brains in great quantities,
and I could put them into small fliers weighing less than a man
weighs. I could give them means of locomotion in the air or upon
the ground. I could give them arms and hands. I could furnish them
with weapons. I could send them out in great hordes to conquer the
world. I could send them to other planets. They would know neither
pain nor fear. They would have no hopes, no aspirations, no
ambitions that might wean them from my service. They would be the
creatures of my will alone, and the things that I sent them to do
they would persist in until they were destroyed.</p>

<p>"But destroying them would serve my enemies no purpose; for
faster than they could destroy them, my great factories would turn
out more.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "how it would work?" and he came close and
spoke almost in a whisper. "The first of these mechanical men I
would make with my own hands, and as I created them I would impel
them to create others of their kind. They would become my
mechanics, the workmen in my factories; and they would work day and
night without rest, always turning out more and more of their kind.
Think how rapidly they would multiply."</p>

<p>I was thinking of this. The possibilities astounded and stunned
me. "But it would take vast wealth," I told him.</p>

<p>"Yes, vast wealth," he repeated; "and it was for the purpose of
obtaining this vast wealth that I built this ship."</p>

<p>"You intend to raid the treasure houses of the great cities of
Barsoom?" I asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"By no means," he replied. "Treasures vastly richer lie at the
disposal of the man who controls this ship. Do you not know what
the spectroscope tells us of the riches of Thuria?"</p>

<p>"I have heard," I said, "but I never took much stock in it. The
story was too fabulous."</p>

<p>"It is true, nevertheless," he said. "There must be mountains of
gold and platinum on Thuria, and vast plains carpeted with precious
stones."</p>

<p>It was a bold enterprise; but after having seen this craft, and
knowing the remarkable genius of Fal Sivas, I had little doubt but
that it was feasible.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as was his way, he seemed to regret that he had
confided in me and brusquely directed me to return to my duties in
the shop.</p>

<p>The old man had told me so much now that I naturally began to
wonder if he would consider it safe to permit me to live, and I was
constantly on my guard. It seemed highly improbable that he would
consent to my leaving the premises, but I determined to settle this
question immediately; for I wanted to see Rapas before he could
visit the establishment of Fal Sivas again, thereby compelling me
to destroy him. Day after day had passed and Fal Sivas had
contrived to prevent my leaving the house, though he had
accomplished it so adroitly that it was never actually apparent
that he did not wish me to leave.</p>

<p>As he dismissed me that evening, I told him that I was going out
to try to locate Rapas and attempt again to contact the assassins
of Ur Jan.</p>

<p>He hesitated so long before he replied that I thought he was
going to forbid me going out, but at last he nodded in
acquiescence. "Perhaps it will be as well," he said. "Rapas does
not come here anymore, and he knows too much to be at large, unless
he is in my service and loyal to me. If I must trust one of you, I
prefer that it be you, rather than Rapas."</p>

<p>I did not go to the evening meal with the others, as I intended
eating at the place that Rapas frequented and where we had planned
to meet when I was at liberty.</p>

<p>It was necessary to acquaint Hamas with the fact that I was
leaving, as only he could open the outer door for me. His manner
toward me was not quite as surly as it had been the past few days.
In fact, he was almost affable; and the change in his manner put me
even more on my guard, for I felt that it boded me no
good&mdash;there was no reason why Hamas should love me any more
today than he had yesterday. If I induced pleasant anticipations in
him, it must be because he visualized something unpleasant
befalling me.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *

<p>From the house of Fal Sivas, I went directly to the eating-
place; and there I inquired of the proprietor regarding Rapas.</p>

<p>"He has been in every evening," replied the man. "He usually
comes about this time and again about half after the eighth zode,
and he always asks me if you have been here."</p>

<p>"I will wait for him," I said, and I went to the table The Rat
and I usually occupied.</p>

<p>I had scarcely seated myself before Rapas entered. He came
directly to the table and seated himself opposite me.</p>

<p>"Where have you been keeping yourself?" he demanded. "I was
commencing to think that old Fal Sivas had made away with you or
that you were a prisoner in his house. I had about made up my mind
to go there tonight and call on the old man, so that I could learn
what had happened to you."</p>

<p>"It is just as well that I got out tonight before you came," I
said.</p>

<p>"Why?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Because it is not safe for you to go to the house of Fal
Sivas," I told him. "If you value your life, you will never go
there again."</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you," I replied, "but just take my word for it,
and keep away." I did not want him to know that I had been
commissioned to kill him. It might have made him so suspicious and
fearful of me that he would be of no value to me in the future.</p>

<p>"Well, it is strange," he said; "Fal Sivas was friendly enough
before I took you there."</p>

<p>I saw that he was harboring in his mind the thought that, for
some reason, I was trying to keep him away from Fal Sivas; but I
couldn't help it, and so I changed the subject.</p>

<p>"Has everything been going well with you, Rapas, since I saw
you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, quite well," he replied.</p>

<p>"What is the news of the city? I have not been out since I saw
you last, and of course we hear little or nothing in the house of
Fal Sivas."</p>

<p>"They say that the Warlord is in Zodanga," he replied. "Uldak,
one of Ur Jan's men, was killed the last night I saw you, as you
will recall. The mark of the Warlord's agent was above his heart,
but Ur Jan believes that no ordinary swordsman could have bested
Uldak. Also he has learned from his agent in Helium that John
Carter is not there; so, putting the two facts together, Ur Jan is
convinced that he must be in Zodanga."</p>

<p>"How interesting," I commented. "And what is Ur Jan going to do
about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll get his revenge," said The Rat; "if not in one way,
then in another. He is already planning; and when he strikes, John
Carter will wish that he had attended to his own affairs and left
Ur Jan alone."</p>

<p>Shortly before we finished our meal, a customer entered the
place and took a seat alone at a table across the room. I could see
him in a mirror in front of me. I saw him glance in our direction,
and then I looked quickly at Rapas and saw his eyes flash a message
as he nodded his head very slightly; but without that, I would have
known why the man was there, for I recognized him as one of the
assassins that had sat at the council with Ur Jan. I pretended not
to notice anything; and my glance wandered idly to the doorway,
attracted by two customers who were leaving the place at the
time.</p>

<p>Then I saw something else of interest&mdash;of vital interest.
As the door swung open, I saw a man outside looking in. It was
Hamas.</p>

<p>The assassin at the table across the room ordered only a glass
of wine; and when he had drunk it, he arose and left. Shortly after
his departure, Rapas got up.</p>

<p>"I must be going," he said; "I have an important
engagement."</p>

<p>"Shall I see you tomorrow night?" I asked.</p>

<p>I could see him attempt to suppress a grin. "I shall be here
tomorrow night," he said.</p>

<p>We went out then onto the avenue; and Rapas left me, while I
turned my steps in the direction of the house of Fal Sivas. Through
the lighted districts I did not have to be particularly on my
guard; but when I entered the darker sections of the city, I was
watchful; and presently I saw a figure lurking in a dark doorway. I
knew it was the assassin waiting to kill me.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap8" id="chap8">VIII. &mdash; SUSPICION</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Cluros, the farther moon, rode high in the
heavens, lighting dimly the streets of Zodanga like a dusty bulb in
a huge loft; but I needed no better light to see the shadowy form
of the man awaiting my coming.</p>

<p>I knew precisely what was in the man's mind, and I must have
smiled. He thought that I was coming along in total ignorance of
his presence or the fact that anyone was planning upon murdering me
that night. He was saying to himself that after I had passed he
would spring out and run his sword through my back; it would be a
very simple matter, and then he would go back and report to Ur
Jan.</p>

<p>As I approached the doorway, I paused and cast a hasty glance
behind me. I wanted to make sure, if I could, that Rapas had not
followed me. If I killed this man, I did not want Rapas to know
that it was I.</p>

<p>Now I resumed my way, keeping a few paces from the building so
that I would not be too close to the assassin when I came opposite
his hiding place.</p>

<p>When I did come opposite it, I turned suddenly and faced it.
"Come out of there, you fool," I said in a low voice.</p>

<p>For a moment the man did not move. He seemed utterly stunned by
his discovery and by my words.</p>

<p>"You and Rapas thought that you could fool me, didn't you?" I
inquired. "You and Rapas and Ur Jan! Well, I will tell you a
secret&mdash;something that Rapas and Ur Jan do not dream. Because
you are trying to kill the wrong man, you are not using the right
method. You think that you are attempting to kill Vandor, but you
are not. There is no such person as Vandor. The man who faces you
is John Carter, Warlord of Mars." I whipped out my sword. "And now
if you are quite ready, you may come out and be killed."</p>

<p>At that, he came forth slowly, his long sword in his hand. I
thought that his eyes showed a trace of astonishment and his voice
certainly did, as he whispered, "John Carter!"</p>

<p>He did not show any fear, and I was glad of that, for I dislike
fighting with a man who is really terrified of me, as he starts his
fight with a terrible handicap that he can never overcome.</p>

<p>"So you are John Carter!" he said, as he stepped out into the
open, and then he commenced to laugh. "You think you can frighten
me, do you? You are a first-class liar, Vandor; but if you were all
the first-class liars on Barsoom rolled into one, you could not
frighten Povak."</p>

<p>Evidently he did not believe me, and I was rather glad of it,
for the encounter would now afford me far richer sport as there was
gradually revealed to my antagonist the fact that he was pitted
against a master swordsman.</p>

<p>As he engaged me, I saw that, while in no respect a mean
swordsman, he was not as proficient as had been Uldak. I should
have been glad to have played with him for a while, but I could not
risk the consequences of being discovered.</p>

<p>So vicious was my attack that I soon pressed him back against
the wall of the building. He had had no opportunity to do more than
defend himself, and now he was absolutely at my mercy.</p>

<p>I could have run him through on the instant, but instead I
reached out quickly with my point and made a short cut upon his
breast and then I made another across it.</p>

<p>I stepped back then and lowered my point. "Look at your breast,
Povak," I said. "What do you see there?"</p>

<p>He glanced down at his breast, and I saw him shudder. "The mark
of the Warlord," he gasped, and then, "Have mercy upon me; I did
not know that it was you."</p>

<p>"I told you," I said, "but you wouldn't believe me; and if you
had believed me, you would have been all the more anxious to kill
me. Ur Jan would have rewarded you handsomely."</p>

<p>"Let me go," he begged. "Spare my life, and I will be your slave
forever."</p>

<p>I saw then that he was a craven coward, and I felt no pity for
him but only contempt.</p>

<p>"Raise your point," I snapped, "and defend yourself, or I shall
run you through in your tracks."</p>

<p>Suddenly, with death staring him in the face, he seemed to go
mad. He rushed at me with the fury of a maniac, and the impetuosity
of his attack sent me back a few steps, and then I parried a
terrific thrust and ran him through the heart.</p>

<p>At a little distance from me, I saw some people coming,
attracted by the clash of steel.</p>

<p>A few steps took me to the entrance of a dark alleyway into
which I darted; and by a circuitous route, I continued on my way to
the house of Fal Sivas.</p>

<p>Hamas admitted me. He was very cordial. In fact, far too
cordial. I felt like laughing in his face because of what I knew
that he did not know that I knew, but I returned his greeting
civilly and passed on to my quarters.</p>

<p>Zanda was waiting up for me. I drew my sword and handed it to
her.</p>

<p>"Rapas?" she asked. I had told her that Fal Sivas had commanded
me to kill The Rat.</p>

<p>"No, not Rapas," I replied. "Another of Ur Jan's men."</p>

<p>"That makes two," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied; "but remember, you must not tell anyone that
it was I who killed them."</p>

<p>"I shall not tell anyone, my master," she replied. "You may
always trust Zanda."</p>

<p>She cleaned the blood from the blade and then dried and polished
it.</p>

<p>I watched her as she worked, noticing her shapely hands and
graceful fingers. I had never paid very much attention to her
before. Of course, I had known that she was young and well-formed
and good-looking; but suddenly I was impressed by the fact that
Zanda was very beautiful and that with the harness and jewels and
hair-dressing of a great lady, she would have been more than
noticeable in any company.</p>

<p>"Zanda," I remarked at last, "you were not born a slave, were
you?"</p>

<p>"No, master."</p>

<p>"Did Fal Sivas buy you or abduct you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Phystal and two slaves took me one night when I was on the
avenues with an escort. They killed him and brought me here."</p>

<p>"Your people," I asked, "are they still living?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied; "my father was an officer in the old Zodangan
Navy. He was of the lesser nobility. He was killed when John Carter
led the green hordes of Thark upon the city. In grief, my mother
took the last long journey on the bosom of the sacred Iss to the
Valley Dor and the Lost Sea of Korus.</p>

<p>"John Carter!" she said, musingly, and her voice was tinged with
loathing. "He was the author of all my sorrows, of all my
misfortune. Had it not been for John Carter robbing me of my
parents I should not be here now, for I should have had their
watchful care and protection to shield me from all danger."</p>

<p>"You feel very bitterly toward John Carter, don't you?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"I hate him," she replied.</p>

<p>"You would be glad to see him dead, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You know, I presume, that Ur Jan has sworn to destroy him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that," she replied; "and I constantly pray that he
will be successful. Were I a man, I should enlist under the banner
of Ur Jan. I should be an assassin and search out John Carter
myself."</p>

<p>"They say he is a formidable swordsman," I suggested.</p>

<p>"I should find a way to kill him, even if I had to descend to
the dagger or poison."</p>

<p>I laughed. "I hope, for John Carter's sake, that you do not
recognize him when you meet him."</p>

<p>"I shall know him all right," she said. "His white skin will
betray him."</p>

<p>"Well, let us hope that he escapes you," I said laughingly, as I
bade her good night and went to my sleeping silks and furs.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *

<p>The next morning, immediately after breakfast, Fal Sivas sent
for me. As I entered his study, I saw Hamas and two slaves standing
near him.</p>

<p>Fal Sivas looked up at me from beneath lowering brows. He did
not greet me pleasantly as was his wont.</p>

<p>"Well," he snapped, "did you destroy Rapas last night?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied; "I did not."</p>

<p>"Did you see him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw him and talked with him. In fact, I ate the evening
meal with him."</p>

<p>I could see that this admission surprised both Fal Sivas and
Hamas. It was evident that it rather upset their calculations, for
I judged that they had expected me to deny having seen Rapas, which
I might have done had it not been for the fortunate circumstance
that had permitted me to discover Hamas spying upon me.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you kill him?" demanded Fal Sivas. "Did I not order
you to do so?"</p>

<p>"You employed me to protect you, Fal Sivas," I replied; "and you
must rely upon my judgment to do it in my own way. I am neither a
child nor a slave. I believe that Rapas has made connections that
will be far more harmful to you than Rapas, himself; and by
permitting him to live and keeping in touch with him, I shall be
able to learn much that will be to your advantage that I could
never learn if I destroyed Rapas. If you are not satisfied with my
methods, get someone else to protect you; and if you have decided
to destroy me, I suggest that you enlist some warriors. These
slaves would be no match for me."</p>

<p>I could see Hamas trembling with suppressed rage at that, but he
did not dare say anything or do anything until Fal Sivas gave him
the word. He just stood there fingering the hilt of his sword and
watching Fal Sivas questioningly, as though he awaited a
signal.</p>

<p>But Fal Sivas gave him no signal. Instead, the old inventor sat
there studying me intently for several minutes. At last he sighed
and shook his head. "You are a very courageous man, Vandor," he
said; "but perhaps a little overconfident and foolish. No one
speaks to Fal Sivas like that. They are all afraid. Do you not
realize that I have it within my power to destroy you at any
moment?"</p>

<p>"If you were a fool, Fal Sivas, I might expect death this
moment; but you are no fool. You know that I can serve you better
alive than dead, and perhaps you also suspect what I
know&mdash;that if I went out I should not go alone. You would go
with me."</p>

<p>Hamas looked horrified and grasped the hilt of his sword firmly,
as though about to draw it; but Fal Sivas leaned back in his chair
and smiled.</p>

<p>"You are quite right, Vandor," he said; "and you may rest
assured that if I ever decide that you must die, I shall not be
within reach of your sword when that sad event occurs. And now tell
me what you expect to learn from Rapas and what makes you believe
that he has information that will be of value to me?"</p>

<p>"That will be for your ears, alone, Fal Sivas," I said, glancing
at Hamas and the two slaves.</p>

<p>Fal Sivas nodded to them. "You may go," he said.</p>

<p>"But, master," objected Hamas, "you will be left alone with this
man. He may kill you."</p>

<p>"I shall be no safer from his sword if you are present, Hamas,"
replied the master. "I have seen and you have seen how deftly he
wields his blade."</p>

<p>Hamas's red skin darkened at that; and without another word he
left the room, followed by the two slaves.</p>

<p>"And now," said Fal Sivas, "tell me what you have learned or
what you suspect."</p>

<p>"I have reason to believe," I replied, "that Rapas has made
connections with Ur Jan. Ur Jan, as you have told me, has been
employed by Gar Nal to assassinate you. By keeping in touch with
Rapas, it is possible that I may be able to learn some of Ur Jan's
plans. I do not know of course, but it is the only contact we have
with the assassins, and it would be poor strategy to destroy
it."</p>

<p>"You are absolutely right, Vandor," he replied. "Contact Rapas
as often as you can, and do not destroy him until he can be of no
more value to us. Then&mdash;" his face was contorted by a fiendish
grimace.</p>

<p>"I thought that you would concur in my judgment," I replied. "I
am particularly anxious to see Rapas again tonight."</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, "and now let us go to the shop. The work
on the new motor is progressing nicely, but I want you to check
over what has been done."</p>

<p>Together we went to the shop; and after inspecting the work, I
told Fal Sivas that I wanted to go to the motor room of the ship to
take some measurements.</p>

<p>He accompanied me, and together we entered the hull. When I had
completed my investigation I sought an excuse to remain longer in
the hangar, as there was half-formed in my mind a plan that would
necessitate more intimate knowledge of the room in the event that I
found it necessary or feasible to carry out my designs.</p>

<p>In pretended admiration of the ship, I walked all around it,
viewing it from every angle; and at the same time viewing the
hangar from every angle. My particular attention was riveted upon
the great doorway through which the ship was to eventually pass out
of the building. I saw how the doors were constructed and how they
were secured; and when I had done that, I lost interest in the ship
for the time being at least.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *

<p>I spent the balance of the day in the shop with the mechanics,
and that night found me again in the eating-place on the Avenue of
Warriors.</p>

<p>Rapas was not there. I ordered my meal and had nearly finished
it, though I was eating very slowly; and still he had not come.
Still I loitered on, as I was very anxious to see him tonight.</p>

<p>But at last, when I had about given him up, he came. It was
evident that he was very nervous, and he appeared even more sly and
furtive than ordinarily.</p>

<p>"Kaor!" I said, as he approached the table; "you are late
tonight."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "I was detained."</p>

<p>He ordered his meal and fidgeted about, uneasily.</p>

<p>"Did you reach home last night all right?" he said.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, of course."</p>

<p>"I was a little bit worried about you," he said. "I heard that a
man was killed on the very avenue through which you must have
passed."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" I exclaimed. "It must have happened after I had
passed by."</p>

<p>"It is very strange," he said; "it was one of Ur Jan's
assassins, and again he had the mark of John Carter upon his
breast."</p>

<p>He was eyeing me very suspiciously, but I could see that he was
afraid even to voice what was in his mind. In fact, I think it
frightened him even to entertain the thought.</p>

<p>"Ur Jan is certain now that John Carter, himself, is in the
city."</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "why be so upset about it? I am sure that it
does not concern either you or me."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap9" id="chap9">IX. &mdash; ON THE BALCONY</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Eyes speak the truth more often than the lips. The
eyes of Rapas the Ulsio told me that he did not agree with me that
the killing of one of Ur Jan's assassins was of no concern to
either him or me, but his lips spoke otherwise.</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, "it is nothing to me; but Ur Jan is
furious. He has offered an immense reward for the positive
identification of the man who killed Uldak and Povak. Tonight he
meets with his principal lieutenants to perfect the details of a
plan which, they believe, will definitely and for all time end the
activities of John Carter against the guild of assassins.
They&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, and his eyes registered a combination of
suspicion and terror. It was as though for a moment his stupid mind
had forgotten the suspicion that it had held that I might be John
Carter and then, after exposing some of the secrets of his master,
he had recalled the fact and was terrified.</p>

<p>"You seem to know a great deal about Ur Jan," I remarked,
casually. "One would think that you are a full-fledged member of
his guild."</p>

<p>For a moment he was confused. He cleared his throat several
times as though about to speak, but evidently he could not think of
anything to say, nor could his eyes hold steadily to mine. I
enjoyed his discomfiture greatly.</p>

<p>"No," he disclaimed, presently; "it is nothing like that. These
are merely things that I have heard upon the street. They are
merely gossip. It is not strange that I should repeat them to a
friend."</p>

<p>Friend! The idea was most amusing. I knew that Rapas was now a
creature of Ur Jan's and that, with his fellows, he had been
commissioned to kill me; and I had been commissioned by Fal Sivas
to kill Rapas; yet here we were, dining and gossiping together. It
was a most amusing situation.</p>

<p>As our meal drew to an end, two villainous-looking fellows
entered and seated themselves at a table. No sign passed between
them and Rapas, but I recognized them both and knew why they were
there. I had seen them both at the meeting of the assassins, and I
seldom forget a face. Their presence was a compliment to me and an
admission that Ur Jan realized that it would take more than one
swordsman to account for me.</p>

<p>I should have been glad to put my mark upon their breasts, but I
knew that if I killed them, the suspicion that Ur Jan harbored that
I might be John Carter would be definitely confirmed. The killing
of Uldak and Povak and the marking of their breasts with the sign
of the Warlord might have been a coincidence; but if two more men,
sent to destroy me, met a similar fate, no doubt could remain even
in a stupid mind but that all four had come to their end at the
hands of John Carter himself.</p>

<p>The men had but scarcely seated themselves when I arose. "I must
be getting along, Rapas," I said; "I have some important work to do
tonight. I hope you will forgive me for running off like this, but
perhaps I shall see you again tomorrow night."</p>

<p>He tried to detain me. "Don't hurry away," he exclaimed; "wait
just a few moments. There are a number of things I should like to
talk to you about."</p>

<p>"They will have to wait until tomorrow," I told him. "May you
sleep well, Rapas," and with that I turned and left the
building.</p>

<p>I went only a short distance along the avenue in the opposite
direction to that which led toward the house of Fal Sivas. I
concealed myself in the shadows of a doorway then and waited, nor
had I long to wait before the two assassins emerged and hurried off
in the direction in which they supposed I had gone. A moment or two
later Rapas came out of the building. He hesitated momentarily and
then he started walking slowly in the direction taken by the
assassins.</p>

<p>When all three were out of sight, I came from my hiding-place
and went at once to the building on the top of which my flier was
stored.</p>

<p>The proprietor was puttering around one of the hangars when I
came onto the roof. I could have wished him elsewhere, as I did not
particularly care to have my comings and goings known.</p>

<p>"I don't see much of you," he said.</p>

<p>"No," I replied; "I have been very busy." I continued in the
direction of the hangar where my ship was stored.</p>

<p>"Going to take your flier out tonight?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Watch out for the patrol boats," he said, "if you are on any
business you wouldn't want the authorities to know about. They have
been awfully busy the last couple of nights."</p>

<p>I didn't know whether he was just giving me a friendly tip, or
if he were trying to get some information from me. There are many
organizations, including the government, that employ secret agents.
For aught I knew, the fellow might be a member of the assassins'
guild.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, "I hope the police don't follow me tonight." He
pricked up his ears. "I don't need any help; and, incidentally, she
is extremely good-looking." I winked at him and nudged him with my
elbow as I passed, in a fashion that I thought his low mentality
would grasp. And it did.</p>

<p>He laughed and slapped me on the back. "I guess you're worried
more about her father than you are the police," he said.</p>

<p>"Say," he called after me, as I was climbing to the deck of my
flier, "ain't she got a sister?"</p>

<p>As I slipped silently out over the city, I heard the hangar man
laughing at his own witticism; and I knew that if he had had any
suspicions I had lulled them.</p>

<p>It was quite dark, neither moon being in the heavens; but this
very fact would make me all the more noticeable to patrol boats
above me when I was passing over the more brilliantly lighted
portions of the city, and so I quickly sought dark avenues and flew
low among the dense shadows of the buildings.</p>

<p>It was a matter of only a few minutes before I reached my
destination and dropped my flier gently to the roof of the building
that housed the headquarters of the assassins' guild of
Zodanga.</p>

<p>Rapas' statement that Ur Jan and his lieutenants were perfecting
a plan aimed at my activities against them was the magnet that had
lured me here this night.</p>

<p>I had decided that I would not again attempt to use the anteroom
off their meeting-place, as not only was the way to it fraught with
too much danger but even were I to safely reach the shadowed niche
behind the cupboard, I still would be unable to hear anything of
their proceedings through the closed door.</p>

<p>I had another plan, and this I put into immediate execution.</p>

<p>I brought my flier to rest at the edge of the roof directly
above the room in which the assassins met; then I made a rope fast
to one of the rings in her gunwale.</p>

<p>Lying on my belly, I looked over the edge of the roof to make
sure of my position and found that I had gauged it to a nicety.
Directly below me was the edge of a balcony before a lighted
window. My rope hung slightly to one side of the window where it
was not visible to those within the room.</p>

<p>Carefully I set the controls of my ship and then tied the end of
a light cord to the starting lever. These matters attended to, I
grasped the rope and slipped over the eaves of the roof, carrying
the light cord in one hand.</p>

<p>I descended quietly, as I had left my weapons on my flier lest
they clank against one another or scrape against the side of the
building as I descended and thus attract attention to me.</p>

<p>Very cautiously I descended; and when I had come opposite the
window, I found that I could reach out with one hand and grasp the
rail of the balcony. I drew myself slowly to it and into a position
where I could stand securely.</p>

<p>Shortly after I had dropped below the edge of the roof, I had
heard voices; and now that I was close to the window, I was
delighted to discover that it was open and that I could hear quite
well nearly all that was going on within the room. I recognized Ur
Jan's voice. He was speaking as I drew myself to the balcony.</p>

<p>"Even if we get him tonight," he said, "and he is the man I
think he is, we can still collect ransom from the girl's father or
grandfather."</p>

<p>"And it should be a fat ransom," said another voice.</p>

<p>"All that a great ship will carry," replied Ur Jan, "and with it
a promise of immunity for all the assassins of Zodanga and their
promise that they will not persecute us further."</p>

<p>I could not but wonder whom they were plotting against
now&mdash;probably some wealthy noble; but what connection there
was between my death and the kidnaping of the girl, I could not
fathom, unless, perhaps, they were not speaking of me at all but of
another.</p>

<p>At this point, I heard a rapping sound and Ur Jan's voice
saying, "Come in."</p>

<p>I heard a door open and the sound of men entering the room.</p>

<p>"Ah," exclaimed Ur Jan, clapping his hands together, "you got
him tonight! Two of you were too many for him, eh?"</p>

<p>"We did not get him," replied a surly voice.</p>

<p>"What?" demanded Ur Jan. "Did he not come to the eating-place
tonight?"</p>

<p>"He was there all right," said another voice, which I recognized
instantly as that of Rapas. "I had him there, as I promised."</p>

<p>"Well, why didn't you get him?" demanded Ur Jan angrily.</p>

<p>"When he left the eating-place," explained one of the other men,
"we followed him immediately; but he had disappeared when we
reached the avenue. He was nowhere in sight; and though we walked
rapidly all the way to the house of Fal Sivas, we saw nothing of
him."</p>

<p>"Was he suspicious?" asked Ur Jan. "Do you think that he guessed
that you had come there for him?"</p>

<p>"No, I am sure he did not. He did not seem to notice us at all.
I did not even see him look at us."</p>

<p>"I cannot understand how he disappeared so quickly," said Rapas,
"but we can get him tomorrow night. He has promised to meet me
there then."</p>

<p>"Listen," said Ur Jan; "you must not fail me tomorrow. I am sure
that this man is John Carter. After all, though, I am glad that we
did not kill him. I have just thought of a better plan. I will send
four of you tomorrow night to wait near the house of Fal Sivas. I
want you to take John Carter alive and bring him to me. With him
alive, we can collect two shiploads of treasure for his
princess."</p>

<p>"And then we will have to hide in the pits of Zodanga all the
rest of our lives," demurred one of the assassins.</p>

<p>Ur Jan laughed. "After we collect the ransom, John Carter will
never bother us again," he said.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I am an assassin, am I not?" demanded Ur Jan. "Do you think
that an assassin will let a dangerous enemy live?"</p>

<p>Now I understood the connection between my death and the
abduction of the girl they had mentioned. She was none other than
my divine princess, Dejah Thoris. From Mors Kajak, Tardos Mors, and
myself, the scoundrels expected to collect two shiploads of ransom;
and they well knew, and I knew, that they had not figured amiss. We
three would gladly have exchanged many shiploads of treasure for
the safety of the incomparable Princess of Helium.</p>

<p>I realized now that I must return immediately to Helium and
insure the safety of my princess, but I lingered there on the
balcony a moment longer listening to the plans of the
conspirators.</p>

<p>"But," objected one of Ur Jan's lieutenants, "even if you
succeed in getting Dejah Thoris&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no 'even' about it," snapped Ur Jan. "It is already as
good as accomplished. I have been preparing for this for a long
time. I have done it very secretly so that there would be no leak;
but now that we are ready to strike, it makes no difference. I can
tell you that two of my men are guards in the palace of the
princess, Dejah Thoris."</p>

<p>"Well, granted that you can get her," objected the former
speaker skeptically, "where can you hide her? Where, upon all
Barsoom, can you hide the Princess of Helium from the great Tardos
Mors, even if you are successful in putting John Carter out of the
way?"</p>

<p>"I shall not hide her on Barsoom," replied Ur Jan.</p>

<p>"What, not upon Barsoom? Where, then?"</p>

<p>"Thuria," replied Ur Jan.</p>

<p>"Thuria!" The speaker laughed. "You will hide her on the nearer
moon. That is good, Ur Jan. That would be a splendid
hiding-place&mdash;if you could get her there."</p>

<p>"I can get her there all right. I am not acquainted with Gar Nal
for nothing."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean that fool ship he is working on? The one in which
he expects to go visiting around among the planets? You don't think
that thing will work, even after he gets it finished, do
you&mdash;if he ever does get it finished?"</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> finished," replied Ur Jan, "and it will fly to
Thuria."</p>

<p>"Well, even if it will, we do not know how to run it."</p>

<p>"Gar Nal will run it for us. He needs a vast amount of treasure
to complete other boats, and for a share of the ransom he has
agreed to pilot the ship for us."</p>

<p>Now, indeed, I realized all too well how carefully Ur Jan had
made his plans and how great was the danger to my princess. Any day
now they might succeed in abducting Dejah Thoris, and I knew that
it would not be impossible with two traitors in her guard.</p>

<p>I decided that I could not waste another moment. I must leave
for Helium at once, and then Fate intervened and nearly made an end
of me.</p>

<p>As I started to climb the rope and swung away from the balcony,
a part of my harness caught upon one of its iron ornaments; and
when I attempted to disengage it, the thing broke loose and fell
upon the balcony.</p>

<p>"What was that?" I heard Ur Jan's voice demand, and then I heard
footsteps coming toward the window. They came fast, and an instant
later the figure of Ur Jan loomed before me.</p>

<p>"A spy," he yelled, and leaped onto the balcony.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10">X. &mdash; JAT OR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Were I prone to seek excuses outside of myself to
explain the causes of misfortunes which overtake me, I might, at
that moment, have inquired why Fate should throw her weight in
favor of evildoers and against me. My cause was, unquestionably, a
cause of righteousness, yet the trifling fact that an iron ornament
upon a balcony in the city of Zodanga had been loose and that my
harness had accidentally caught upon it had placed me in a
situation from which it seemed likely that I could not escape with
my life.</p>

<p>However, I was not dead yet; and I had no intention of resigning
myself to the dictates of an unkind and unjust Fate without a
struggle. Furthermore, in the idiom of a famous American game, I
had an ace in the hole.</p>

<p>As Ur Jan clambered out onto the balcony, I had swung away from
it, clinging to the rope attached to my flier above; and, at the
same time, I started to climb.</p>

<p>Like a pendulum, I swung; and, having reached the end of my arc,
I swung back again, seemingly directly into the arms of Ur Jan.</p>

<p>It all happened very quickly, much more quickly than I can tell
it. Ur Jan laid hold of the hilt of his sword; I drew my knees well
up against my body; I swung toward him; then, as I was almost upon
him, I kicked him with both feet full in the chest and with all my
strength.</p>

<p>Ur Jan staggered back against another of the assassins who was
following him onto the balcony, and they both went down in a
heap.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, I pulled on the light cord that I had attached
to the starting lever of my motor. In response, the ship rose; and
I rose with it, dangling at the end of my rope.</p>

<p>My situation was anything but an enviable one. I could not, of
course, guide the ship; and if it failed to rise rapidly enough, I
stood an excellent chance of being dashed to death against some
building as I was dragged across the city; but even this menace was
by no means the greatest which threatened me, for now I heard a
shot, and a bullet whirred past me&mdash;the assassins were
attempting to shoot me down.</p>

<p>I climbed as rapidly as I could toward my flier; but climbing a
small rope, while swinging beneath a rising airship, is not an
enviable situation, even without the added hazard of being fired at
by a band of assassins.</p>

<p>The ship carried me diagonally across the avenue upon which
stood the building that harbored Ur Jan's band. I thought surely
that I must hit the eaves of the opposite building; and, believe
me, I put every ounce of my strength and agility into climbing that
rope, as I swung rapidly across the avenue.</p>

<p>In this instance, however, Fate favored me; and I skimmed just
above the roof of the building.</p>

<p>The assassins were still firing at me, but I imagine that most
of their hits in the past had been scored with daggers or poison,
for their pistol practice was execrable.</p>

<p>At last my fingers closed over the gunwale of my ship, and a
moment later I had drawn myself to her deck. Reaching for her
controls, I opened the throttle wide and set her nose for
Helium.</p>

<p>Perhaps I was reckless, for I ignored the threat of the patrol
boats and made no effort to escape their vigilance. Nothing
mattered to me now but to reach Helium in time to safeguard my
princess.</p>

<p>How well my enemies knew where to strike at me! How well they
knew my vulnerable parts! They knew that nothing I possessed,
including my life, would I refuse to give for the preservation of
Dejah Thoris. They must have known, too, the price that they would
have to pay if harm befell her; and this fact marked them for the
desperate men that they were. I had threatened their security and
their lives, and they were risking all in this attempt to defeat
me.</p>

<p>I wondered if any of them had recognized me. I had not seen
Rapas at the window; and, in the darkness of the night, there
seemed little likelihood that the other two assassins, who had seen
me but momentarily in the eating-place, could have been sure that
it was I whom they saw for a second dangling at the end of a
twirling rope. I felt that they might have suspected that it was
Vandor, but I hoped that they were not sure that it was John
Carter.</p>

<p>My swift craft moved rapidly across the city of Zodanga; and I
thought that I was going to get away without difficulty, when
suddenly I heard the warning wail of a patrol boat, signaling me to
stop.</p>

<p>It was considerably above me, and slightly ahead and to the
starboard, when it discovered me. My throttle was open wide, and I
was racing through the thin air of the dying planet at full
speed.</p>

<p>The patrol boat must have realized instantly that I had no
intention of stopping, for it shot forward in a burst of speed, at
the same time diving for me. Its velocity in that long dive was
tremendous; and though it was, normally, not as fast a craft as
mine, its terrific speed in the dive was far greater than my craft
could attain.</p>

<p>I was already too low to gain speed by diving, nor could I thus
have equaled the great speed of the larger craft, the weight of
which added to its momentum.</p>

<p>It was coming right down on top of me and overhauling me
rapidly&mdash;coming diagonally from my starboard side.</p>

<p>It seemed futile to hope that I could escape it; and when it
opened up on me with its bow guns, I almost had it in my mind to
give up the fight and surrender, for at least then I should be
alive. Otherwise, I should be dead; and dead I could be of no help
to Dejah Thoris. But I was faced then with the fact that I would be
delayed, that I might not be able to reach Helium in time. I was
sure to be arrested, and almost certainly I would be imprisoned for
attempting to escape the patrol boat. I had no papers, and that
would make it all the harder for me. I stood an excellent chance of
being thrown into slavery, or into the pits beneath the city to
await the coming games.</p>

<p>The risk was too great. I must reach Helium without delay.</p>

<p>Suddenly I swung my helm to starboard; and, so quickly the
little craft obeyed my will, I came very near to being catapulted
from her deck as she swung suddenly into the new course.</p>

<p>I tacked directly beneath the hull of the patrol boat as she
hurtled close above me; and thus she could not fire upon me, as her
guns were masked by her own hull.</p>

<p>Now it was that her greater weight and the speed of her dive
worked to my advantage. They could not check the velocity of this
larger ship and turn her onto the new course with the same facility
with which I had maneuvered my lighter one-man craft.</p>

<p>The result was that before she was on my trail again, I had
passed far beyond the outer walls of Zodanga; and, running as I was
without lights, the patrol boat could not pick me up.</p>

<p>I saw her own lights for a few moments, but I could tell that
she was not upon the right course; and then, with a sigh of relief,
I settled myself for the long journey to Helium.</p>

<p>As I sped through the thin air of dying Mars, Thuria rose above
the Western horizon ahead, flooding with her brilliant light the
vast expanse of dead sea bottoms where once rolled mighty oceans
bearing on their bosoms the great ships of the glorious race that
then dominated the young planet.</p>

<p>I passed their ruined cities upon the verges of these ancient
seas; and in my imagination I peopled them with happy, carefree
throngs. There again were the great jeddaks who ruled them and the
warrior clans that defended them. Now all were gone, and doubtless
the dark recesses of their stately buildings housed some wild tribe
of cruel and mirthless green men.</p>

<p>And so I sped across the vast expanse of waste land toward The
Twin Cities of Helium and the woman I loved&mdash;the woman whose
deathless beauty was the toast of a world.</p>

<p>I had set my destination compass on my goal, and now I stretched
myself upon the deck of my flier and slept.</p>

<p>It is a long and lonely journey from Zodanga to Helium, and this
time it seemed stretched to interminable length because of my
anxiety for the safety of my princess, but at last it was ended,
and I saw the scarlet tower of greater Helium looming before
me.</p>

<p>As I approached the city, a patrol boat stopped me and ordered
me alongside.</p>

<p>During the day, I had removed the red pigment from my skin; and
even before I gave my name, the officer in command of the patrol
boat recognized me.</p>

<p>I thought I noticed some restraint and embarrassment in his
manner, but he said nothing other than to greet me respectfully and
ask if his ship might escort me to my palace.</p>

<p>I thanked him and asked him to follow me so that I would not be
detained by other patrol boats; and when I was safely above my own
hangars, he dipped his bow and left.</p>

<p>As I alighted on the roof, the hangar guard ran forward to take
the ship and run her into her hangar.</p>

<p>These men were old and loyal retainers who had been in my
service for years. Ordinarily, they greeted me with enthusiasm when
I returned from an absence, their manner toward me, while always
respectful, being more that of old servants than strictly military
retainers; but tonight they greeted me with averted eyes and seemed
ill at ease.</p>

<p>I did not question them, though I felt intuitively that
something was amiss. Instead, I hastened down the ramp into my
palace and made my way immediately toward the quarters of my
princess.</p>

<p>As I approached them, I met a young officer of her personal
guard; and when he saw me he came rapidly to meet me. His face
looked lined and careworn, and I could see that he was laboring
under suppressed emotions.</p>

<p>"What is wrong, Jat Or?" I demanded; "first the commander of the
patrol boat, then the hangar guard, and now you all look as though
you had lost your last friend."</p>

<p>"We have lost our best friend," he replied.</p>

<p>I knew what he meant, but I hesitated to demand a direct
explanation. I did not want to hear it. I shrank from hearing the
words that I knew he would speak, as I had never shrunk from
anything before in my life, not even a rendezvous with death.</p>

<p>But Jat Or was a soldier, and so was I; and however painful a
duty may be, a soldier must face it bravely.</p>

<p>"When did they take her?" I asked.</p>

<p>He looked at me in wide-eyed astonishment. "You know, sir?" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>I nodded. "It is what I hastened from Zodanga to prevent; and
now, Jat Or, I am too late; am I not?"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," I said.</p>

<p>"It happened last night, my prince&mdash;just when, we do not
know. Two men were on guard before her door. They were new men, but
they had successfully passed the same careful examination and
investigation that all must who enter your service, sir. This
morning when two female slaves came to relieve the two that were on
duty with the princess last night, they found her gone. The two
slave women lay dead in their sleeping silks and furs; they had
been killed in their sleep. The two guards were gone. We do not
know; but we believe, of course, that it was they who took the
princess."</p>

<p>"It was," I said. "They were agents of Ur Jan, the assassin of
Zodanga. What has been done?"</p>

<p>"Tardos Mors, the jeddak, her grandfather, and Mors Kajak, her
father, have dispatched a thousand ships in search of her."</p>

<p>"It is strange," I said; "I saw not a single ship on my entire
flight from Zodanga."</p>

<p>"But they were sent out, my prince," insisted Jat Or. "I know
because I begged to be permitted to accompany one of them; I felt
that the responsibility was mine, that in some way it was my fault
that my princess was taken."</p>

<p>"Wherever they are searching, they are wasting their time," I
said. "Carry that word from me to Tardos Mors. Tell him to call
back his ships. There is only one ship that can follow where they
have taken Dejah Thoris, and only two men in the world who can
operate that ship. One of them is an enemy; the other is myself.
Therefore, I must return to Zodanga at once. There is no time to be
lost; otherwise, I would see the Jeddak myself before I leave."</p>

<p>"But is there nothing that we can do here?" he demanded. "Is
there nothing that I can do? If I had been more watchful, this
would not have happened. I should have slept always before the door
of my princess. Let me go with you. I have a good sword; and there
may come a time when even the Warlord, himself, would be glad of
another to back up his own."</p>

<p>I considered his appeal for a moment. Why not take him? I have
been on my own so much during my long life that I have come to rely
only upon my own powers, yet on the occasions when I have fought
with good men at my side, I have been glad that they were
there&mdash;such men as Carthoris, Kantos Kan, and Tars Tarkas.
This young padwar I knew to be clever with the sword; and I knew,
too, that he was loyal to my princess and myself. At least, he
would be no hindrance, even if he were no help.</p>

<p>"Very well, Jat Or," I said. "Change into a plain harness. You
are no longer a padwar in the navy of Helium; you are a panthan
without a country, at the service of any who will take you. Ask the
Officer of the Guard to come to my quarters at once; and when you
have changed, come there also. Do not be long."</p>

<p>The Officer of the Guard reached my quarters shortly after I
did. I told him that I was going in search of Dejah Thoris and that
he would be in charge of the household until I returned.</p>

<p>"While I am waiting for Jat Or," I said, "I wish that you would
go to the landing deck and signal for a patrol boat. I want it to
escort me beyond the walls of the city, so that I shall not be
delayed."</p>

<p>He saluted and left, and after he had gone I wrote a short note
to Tardos Mors and others to Mors Kajak and Carthoris.</p>

<p>As I completed the last of these, Jat Or entered. He was a trim
and efficient-looking fighting man, and I was pleased with his
appearance. Although he had been in our service for some time I had
not known him intimately in the past, as he was only a minor padwar
attached to the retinue of Dejah Thoris. A padwar, incidentally,
holds a rank corresponding closely to that of lieutenant in an
earthly military organization.</p>

<p>I motioned Jat Or to follow me, and together we went to the
landing deck. Here I selected a fast two-man flier; and as I was
running it out of its hangar, the patrol boat that the Officer of
the Guard had summoned settled toward the deck.</p>

<p>A moment later we were moving toward the outer walls of greater
Helium under escort of the patrol boat; and when we had passed
beyond, we dipped our bows to one another in parting salute. I set
the nose of my flier in the direction of Zodanga and opened the
throttle wide, while the patrol boat turned back over the city.</p>

<p>The return journey to Zodanga was uneventful. I took advantage
of the time at my disposal to acquaint Jat Or with all that had
occurred while I was in Zodanga and of all that I had learned
there, so that he might be well prepared in advance for any
emergency which might arise. I also again tinted my flesh with the
red pigment which was my only disguise.</p>

<p>Naturally, I was much concerned regarding the fate of Dejah
Thoris, and devoted much time to useless conjecture as to where her
abductors had taken her.</p>

<p>I could not believe that Gar Nal's interplanetary ship could
have approached Helium without being discovered. It seemed,
therefore, far more reasonable to assume that Dejah Thoris had been
taken to Zodanga and that from that city the attempt would be made
to transport her to Thuria.</p>

<p>My state of mind during this long journey is indescribable. I
visualized my princess in the power of Ur Jan's ruffians; and I
pictured her mental suffering, though I knew that outwardly she
would remain calm and courageous. To what insults and indignities
would they subject her? A blood-red mist swam before my eyes as
thoughts like these raced through my brain, and the blood-lust of
the killer dominated me completely, so that I am afraid I was a
rather surly and uncommunicative companion that Jat Or sailed with
during the last hours of that flight.</p>

<p>But at last we approached Zodanga. It was night again.</p>

<p>It might have been safer to have waited until daylight, as I had
on a previous occasion, before entering the city; but time was an
all important factor now.</p>

<p>Showing no lights, we nosed slowly toward the city's walls; and
keeping constant watch for a patrol boat, we edged over the outer
wall and into a dark avenue beyond.</p>

<p>Keeping to unlighted thoroughfares, we came at last in safety to
the same public hangar that I had patronized before.</p>

<p>The first step in the search for Dejah Thoris had been
taken.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11">XI. &mdash; IN THE HOUSE OF GAR
NAL</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Ignorance and stupidity occasionally reveal
advantages that raise them to the dignity of virtues. The ignorant
and stupid are seldom sufficiently imaginative to be intelligently
curious.</p>

<p>The hangar man had seen me depart in a one-man flier and alone.
Now he saw me return in a two-man flier, with a companion. Yet, he
evidenced no embarrassing curiosity on the subject.</p>

<p>Storing our craft in a hangar and instructing the hangar man
that he was to permit either one of us to take it out when we
chose, I conducted Jat Or to the public house in the same building;
and after introducing him to the proprietor, I left him, as the
investigation that I now purposed conducting could be carried on to
better advantage by one man than two.</p>

<p>My first objective was to learn if Gar Nal's ship had left
Zodanga. Unfortunately, I did not know the location of the hangar
in which Gar Nal had built his ship. I was quite sure that I could
not get this information from Rapas, as he was already suspicious
of me, and so my only hope lay in Fal Sivas.</p>

<p>I was quite sure that he must know, as from remarks that he had
dropped, I was convinced that the two inventors had constantly
spied upon one another; and so I set out in the direction of the
house of Fal Sivas, after instructing Jat Or to remain at the
public house where I could find him without delay should I require
his services.</p>

<p>It was still not very late in the evening when I reached the
house of the old inventor. At my signal, Hamas admitted me. He
appeared a little surprised and not overly pleased when he
recognized me.</p>

<p>"We thought that Ur Jan had finally done away with you," he
said.</p>

<p>"No such luck, Hamas," I replied. "Where is Fal Sivas?"</p>

<p>"He is in his laboratory on the level above," replied the
major-domo. "I do not know that he will want to be disturbed,
though I believe that he will be anxious to see you."</p>

<p>He added this last with a nasty inflection that I did not
like.</p>

<p>"I will go up to his quarters, at once," I said.</p>

<p>"No," said Hamas; "you will wait here. I will go to the master
and ask his pleasure."</p>

<p>I brushed past him into the corridor. "You may come with me, if
you will, Hamas," I said; "but whether you come or not, I must see
Fal Sivas at once."</p>

<p>He grumbled at this disregard of his authority and hastened
along the corridor a pace or two ahead of me.</p>

<p>As I passed my former quarters, I noticed that the door was
open; but though I saw nothing of Zanda within, I gave the matter
no thought.</p>

<p>We passed on up the ramp to the level above, and there Hamas
knocked on the door of Fal Sivas's apartment.</p>

<p>For a moment there was no answer; and I was about to enter the
room when I heard Fal Sivas's voice demand querulously, "Who's
there?"</p>

<p>"It is Hamas," replied the major-domo, "and the man, Vandor, who
has returned."</p>

<p>"Send him in, send him in," directed Fal Sivas.</p>

<p>As Hamas opened the door, I brushed past him and, turning,
pushed him out into the corridor. "He said, 'Send him in,'" I said.
Then I closed the door in his face.</p>

<p>Fal Sivas had evidently come out of one of the other rooms of
his suite in answer to our knock, for he stood now facing me with
his hand still on the latch of a door in the opposite wall of the
room, an angry frown contracting his brows.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Naturally, I have not been accustomed to being spoken to in the
manner that Fal Sivas had adopted; and I did not relish it. I am a
fighting man, not an actor; and, for a moment, I had a little
difficulty in remembering that I was playing a part.</p>

<p>I did even go so far as to take a couple of steps toward Fal
Sivas with the intention of taking him by the scruff of the neck
and shaking some manners into him, but I caught myself in time; and
as I paused, I could not but smile.</p>

<p>"Why don't you answer me?" cried Fal Sivas, "You are laughing;
do you dare to laugh at me?"</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I laugh at my own stupidity?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Your own stupidity? I do not understand. What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I took you for an intelligent man, Fal Sivas; and now I find
that I was mistaken. It makes me smile."</p>

<p>I thought he was going to explode, but he managed to control
himself. "Just what do you mean by that?" he demanded angrily.</p>

<p>"I mean that no intelligent man would speak to a lieutenant in
the tone of voice in which you have just addressed me, no matter
what he suspected, until he had thoroughly investigated. You have
probably been listening to Hamas during my absence; so I am
naturally condemned without a hearing."</p>

<p>He blinked at me for a moment and then said in a slightly more
civil voice, "Well, go ahead, explain where you have been and what
you have been doing."</p>

<p>"I have been investigating some of Ur Jan's activities," I
replied, "but I have no time now to go into an explanation of that.
The important thing for me to do now is to go to Gar Nal's hangar,
and I do not know where it is. I have come here to you for that
information."</p>

<p>"Why do you want to go to Gar Nal's hangar?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Because I have word that Gar Nal's ship has left Zodanga on a
mission in which both he and Ur Jan are connected."</p>

<p>This information threw Fal Sivas into a state of excitement
bordering on apoplexy. "The calot!" he exclaimed, "the thief, the
scoundrel; he has stolen all my ideas and now he has launched his
ship ahead of mine. I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, Fal Sivas," I urged him. "We do not know yet
that Gar Nal's ship has sailed. Tell me where he was building it,
and I will go and investigate."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he exclaimed, "at once; but Vandor, do you know
where Gar Nal was going? Did you find that out?"</p>

<p>"To Thuria, I believe," I replied.</p>

<p>Now, indeed, was Fal Sivas convulsed with rage. By comparison
with this, his first outburst appeared almost like enthusiastic
approval of his competitor for inventive laurels. He called Gar Nal
every foul thing he could lay his tongue to and all his ancestors
back to the original tree of life from which all animate things on
Mars are supposed to have sprung.</p>

<p>"He is going to Thuria after the treasure!" he screamed in
conclusion. "He has even stolen that idea from me."</p>

<p>"This is no time for lamentation, Fal Sivas," I snapped. "We are
getting no place. Tell me where Gar Nal's hangar is, so that we may
know definitely whether or not he has sailed."</p>

<p>With an effort, he gained control of himself; and then he gave
me minute directions for finding Gar Nal's hangar, and even told me
how I might gain entrance to it, revealing a familiarity with his
enemy's stronghold which indicated that his own spies had not been
idle.</p>

<p>As Fal Sivas concluded his directions, I thought that I heard
sounds coming from the room behind him&mdash;muffled sounds&mdash;a
gasp, a sob, perhaps. I could not tell. The sounds were faint; they
might have been almost anything; and now Fal Sivas crossed the room
toward me and ushered me out into the corridor, a little hurriedly,
I thought; but that may have been my imagination. I wondered if he,
too, had heard the sounds.</p>

<p>"You had better go, now," he said; "and when you have discovered
the truth, return at once and report to me."</p>

<p>On my way from the quarters of Fal Sivas, I stopped at my own to
speak to Zanda; but she was not there, and I continued on to the
little doorway through which I came and went from the house of Fal
Sivas.</p>

<p>Hamas was there in the anteroom. He looked disappointed when he
saw me. "You are going out?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"Are you returning again tonight?"</p>

<p>"I expect to," I replied; "and by the way, Hamas, where is
Zanda? She was not in my quarters when I stopped in."</p>

<p>"We thought you were not returning," explained the major-domo,
"and Fal Sivas found other duties for Zanda. Tomorrow I shall have
Phystal give you another slave."</p>

<p>"I want Zanda again," I said. "She performs her duties
satisfactorily, and I prefer her."</p>

<p>"That is something you will have to discuss with Fal Sivas," he
replied.</p>

<p>I passed out then into the night and gave the matter no further
thought, my mind being occupied with far more important
considerations.</p>

<p>My way led past the public house where I had left Jat Or and on
into another quarter of the city. Here, without difficulty, I
located the building that Fal Sivas had described.</p>

<p>At one side of it was a dark narrow alley. I entered this and
groped my way to the far end, where I found a low wall, as Fal
Sivas had explained that I would.</p>

<p>I paused there a moment and listened intently, but no sound came
from the interior of the building. Then I vaulted easily to the top
of the wall, and from there to the roof of a low annex. Across this
roof appeared the end of the hangar in which Gar Nal had built his
ship. I recognized it for what it was by the great doors set in the
wall.</p>

<p>Fal Sivas had told me that through the crack between the two
doors, I could see the interior of the hangar and quickly determine
if the ship were still there. But there was no light within; the
hangar was completely dark, and I could see nothing as I glued an
eye to the crack.</p>

<p>I attempted to move the doors, but they were securely locked.
Then I moved cautiously along the wall in search of another
opening.</p>

<p>About forty feet to the right of the doors, I discovered a small
window some ten feet above the roof upon which I was standing. I
sprang up to it and grasped the sill with my fingers and drew
myself up in the hope that I might be able to see something from
this vantage point.</p>

<p>To my surprise and delight, I found the window open. All was
quiet inside the hangar&mdash;quiet and as dark as Erebus.</p>

<p>Sitting on the sill, I swung my legs through the window, turned
over on my belly, and lowered myself into the interior of the
hangar; then I let go of the sill and dropped.</p>

<p>Such a maneuver, naturally, is fraught with danger, as one never
knows upon what he may alight.</p>

<p>I alighted upon a moveable bench, loaded with metal parts and
tools. My weight upset it, and it crashed to the floor with a
terrific din.</p>

<p>Scrambling to my feet, I stood there in the darkness waiting,
listening. If there were anyone anywhere in the building, large as
it appeared to be, it seemed unlikely that the racket I had made
could pass unnoticed, nor did it.</p>

<p>Presently I heard footsteps. They seemed at a considerable
distance, but they approached rapidly at first and then more
slowly. Whoever was coming appeared to grow more cautious as he
neared the hangar.</p>

<p>Presently a door at the far end was thrown open, and I saw two
armed men silhouetted against the light of the room beyond.</p>

<p>It was not a very brilliant light that came from the adjoining
chamber, but it was sufficient to partially dispel the gloom of the
cavernous interior of the hangar and reveal the fact that there was
no ship here. Gar Nal had sailed!</p>

<p>I had evidently been hoping against hope, for the discovery
stunned me. Gar Nal was gone; and, unquestionably, Dejah Thoris was
with him.</p>

<p>The two men were advancing cautiously into the hangar. "Do you
see anyone?" I heard the man in the rear demand.</p>

<p>"No," replied the leader, and then, in a loud voice, "who is
here?"</p>

<p>The floor of the hangar had a most untidy appearance. Barrels,
crates, carboys, tools, parts&mdash;a thousand and one
things&mdash;were scattered indiscriminately about it. Perhaps this
was fortunate for me; as, among so many things, it would be
difficult to discover me as long as I did not move, unless the men
stumbled directly upon me.</p>

<p>I was kneeling in the shadow of a large box, planning upon my
next move in the event that I was discovered.</p>

<p>The two men came slowly along the center of the room. They came
opposite my hiding-place. They passed me. I glanced at the open
door through which they had come. There seemed to be no one there.
Evidently these two men had been on guard; and they, alone, had
heard the noise that I had made.</p>

<p>Suddenly a plan flashed to my mind. I stepped out of my
hiding-place and stood between them and the open door through which
they had entered.</p>

<p>I had moved quietly, and they had not heard me. Then I
spoke.</p>

<p>"Do not move," I said, "and you will be safe."</p>

<p>They stopped as though they had been shot, and wheeled
about.</p>

<p>"Stand where you are," I commanded.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked one of the men.</p>

<p>"Never mind who I am. Answer my questions, and no harm will
befall you."</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the men laughed. "No harm will befall us," he
said. "You are alone, and we are two. Come!" he whispered to his
companion; and drawing their swords, the two rushed upon me.</p>

<p>I backed away from them, my own sword ready to parry their
thrusts and cuts. "Wait!" I cried. "I do not want to kill you.
Listen to me. I only want some information from you, and then I
will go."</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! He does not want to kill us," shouted one of the men.
"Come now," he directed his fellow, "get on his left side, and I
will take him on the right. So he does not want to kill us,
eh?"</p>

<p>Sometimes I feel that I am entitled to very little credit for my
countless successes in mortal combat. Always, it seems to me, and
it certainly must appear even more so to my opponents, my flashing
blade is a living thing inspired to its marvellous feats by a power
beyond that of mortal man. It was so tonight.</p>

<p>As the two men charged me from opposite sides, my steel flashed
so rapidly in parries, cuts, and thrusts that I am confident that
the eyes of my opponents could not follow it.</p>

<p>The first man went down with a cloven skull the instant that he
came within reach of my blade, and almost in the same second I ran
his companion through the shoulder. Then I stepped back.</p>

<p>His sword arm was useless; it hung limp at his side. He could
not escape. I was between him and the door; and he stood there,
waiting for me to run him through the heart.</p>

<p>"I have no desire to kill you," I told him. "Answer my questions
truthfully, and I will let you live."</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what do you want to know?" he growled.</p>

<p>"Never mind who I am. Answer my questions, and see that you
answer them truthfully. When did Gar Nal's ship sail?"</p>

<p>"Two nights ago."</p>

<p>"Who was on board?"</p>

<p>"Gar Nal and Ur Jan."</p>

<p>"No one else?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"No," he replied.</p>

<p>"Where were they going?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?"</p>

<p>"It will be well for you, if you do know. Come now, where were
they going; and who were they taking with them?"</p>

<p>"They were going to meet another ship somewhere near Helium, and
there they were going to take aboard someone whose name I never
heard mentioned."</p>

<p>"Were they kidnaping someone for ransom?" I demanded.</p>

<p>He nodded. "I guess that was it," he said.</p>

<p>"And you don't know who it was?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Where are they going to hide this person they are
kidnaping?"</p>

<p>"Some place where no one will ever find her," he said.</p>

<p>"Where is that?"</p>

<p>"I heard Gar Nal say he was going to Thuria."</p>

<p>I had gained about all the information that this man could give
me that would be of any value; so I made him lead me to a small
door that opened onto the roof from which I had gained entrance to
the hangar. I stepped out and waited until he had closed the door;
then I crossed the roof and dropped to the top of the wall below,
and from there into the alleyway.</p>

<p>As I made my way toward the house of Fal Sivas, I planned
rapidly. I realized that I must take desperate chances, and that
whatever the outcome of my adventure, its success or failure rested
wholly upon my own shoulders.</p>

<p>I stopped at the public house where I had left Jat Or, and found
him anxiously awaiting my return.</p>

<p>The place was now so filled with guests that we could not talk
with privacy, and so I took him with me over to the eating-place
that Rapas and I had frequented. Here we found a table, and I
narrated to him all that had occurred since I had left him after
our arrival in Zodanga.</p>

<p>"And now," I said, "tonight I hope that we may start for Thuria.
When we separate here, go at once to the hangar and take out the
flier. Keep an eye out for patrol boats; and if you succeed in
leaving the city, go directly west on the thirtieth parallel for
one hundred haads. Wait for me there. If I do not come in two days,
you are free to act as you wish."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12">XII. &mdash; "WE BOTH MUST
DIE!"</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Thuria! She had always intrigued my imagination;
and now as I saw her swinging low through the sky above me, as Jat
Or and I separated on the avenue in front of the eating- place, she
dominated my entire being.</p>

<p>Somewhere between that blazing orb and Mars, a strange ship was
bearing my lost love to some unknown fate.</p>

<p>How hopeless her situation must appear to her, who could not
guess that any who loved her were even vaguely aware of her
situation or whither her abductors were taking her. It was quite
possible that she, herself, did not know. How I wished that I might
transmit a message of hope to her.</p>

<p>With such thoughts was my mind occupied as I made my way in the
direction of the house of Fal Sivas; but even though I was thus
engrossed, my faculties, habituated to long years of danger, were
fully alert, so that sounds of footsteps emerging from an avenue I
had just crossed did not pass unnoticed. Presently, I was aware
that they had turned into the avenue that I was traversing and were
following behind me, but I gave no outward indication that I heard
them until it became evident that they were rapidly overtaking
me.</p>

<p>I swung around then, my hand upon the hilt of my sword; and as I
did so, the man who was following addressed me.</p>

<p>"I thought it was you," he said, "but I was not certain."</p>

<p>"It is I, Rapas," I replied.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" he asked. "I have been looking for you
for the past two days."</p>

<p>"Yes?" I inquired. "What do you want of me? You will have to be
quick, Rapas; I am in a hurry."</p>

<p>He hesitated. I could see that he was nervous. He acted as
though he had something to say, but did not know how to begin, or
else was afraid to broach the subject.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," he commenced, lamely, "we haven't seen each
other for several days, and I just wanted to have a visit with
you&mdash;just gossip a little, you know. Let's go back and have a
bite to eat."</p>

<p>"I have just eaten," I replied.</p>

<p>"How is old Fal Sivas?" he asked. "Do you know anything
new?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing," I lied. "Do you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just gossip," he replied. "They say that Ur Jan has
kidnaped the Princess of Helium." I could see him looking at me
narrowly for my reaction.</p>

<p>"Is that so?" I inquired. "I should hate to be in Ur Jan's shoes
when the men of Helium lay hold of him."</p>

<p>"They won't lay hold of him," said Rapas. "He has taken her
where they will never find her."</p>

<p>"I hope that he gets all that is coming to him, if he harms
her," I said; "and he probably will." Then I turned as though to
move away.</p>

<p>"Ur Jan won't harm her, if the ransom is paid," said Rapas.</p>

<p>"Ransom?" I inquired. "And what do they consider the Princess of
Helium worth to the men of Helium?"</p>

<p>"Ur Jan is letting them off easy," volunteered Rapas. "He is
asking only two shiploads of treasure&mdash;all the gold and
platinum and jewels that two great ships will carry."</p>

<p>"Have they notified her people of their demand?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A friend of mine knows a man who is acquainted with one of Ur
Jan's assassins," explained Rapas; "communication with the
assassins could be opened up in this way."</p>

<p>So he had finally gotten it out of his system. I could have
laughed if I had not been so worried about Dejah Thoris. The
situation was self-evident. Ur Jan and Rapas were both confident
that I was either John Carter or one of his agents, and Rapas had
been delegated to act as intermediary between the kidnapers and
myself.</p>

<p>"It is all very interesting," I said; "but, of course, it is
nothing to me. I must be getting along. May you sleep well,
Rapas."</p>

<p>I venture to say that I left The Rat in a quandary as I turned
on my heel and continued on my way toward the house of Fal Sivas. I
imagine that he was not so sure as he had been that I was John
Carter or even that I was an agent of the Warlord; for certainly
either one or the other should have evinced more interest in his
information than I had. Of course, he had told me nothing that I
did not already know; and therefore there had been nothing to
induce within me either surprise or excitement.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would have made no difference either one way or the
other had Rapas known that I was John Carter; but it pleased me, in
combating the activities of such men, to keep them mystified and
always to know a little more than they did.</p>

<p>Again Hamas admitted me when I reached the gloomy pile that Fal
Sivas inhabited; and as I passed him and started along the corridor
toward the ramp that leads up to Fal Sivas's quarters on the next
level, he followed after me.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" he asked, "to your quarters?"</p>

<p>"No, I am going to the quarters of Fal Sivas," I replied.</p>

<p>"He is very busy now. He cannot be disturbed," said Hamas.</p>

<p>"I have information for him," I said.</p>

<p>"It will have to wait until tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>I turned and looked at him. "You annoy me, Hamas," I said; "run
along and mind your own business."</p>

<p>He was furious then, and took hold of my arm. "I am major-domo
here," he cried, "and you must obey me. You are only
a&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An assassin," I prompted him meaningly, and laid my hand upon
the hilt of my sword.</p>

<p>He backed away. "You wouldn't dare," he cried. "You wouldn't
dare!"</p>

<p>"Oh, wouldn't I? You don't know me, Hamas. I am in the employ of
Fal Sivas; and when I am in a man's employ, I obey him. He told me
to report back to him at once. If it is necessary to kill you to do
so, I shall have to kill you."</p>

<p>His manner altered then, and I could see that he was afraid of
me. "I only warned you for your own good," he said. "Fal Sivas is
in his laboratory now. If he is interrupted in the work that he is
doing, he will be furious&mdash;he may kill you himself. If you
are wise, you will wait until he sends for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Hamas," I said; "I am going to see Fal Sivas now.
May you sleep well," and I turned and continued on up the corridor
toward the ramp. He did not follow me.</p>

<p>I went at once to the quarters of Fal Sivas, knocked once upon
the door, and then opened it. Fal Sivas was not there, but I heard
his voice coming from beyond the little door at the opposite end of
the room.</p>

<p>"Who's that? What do you want? Get out of here and do not
disturb me," he cried.</p>

<p>"It is I, Vandor," I replied. "I must see you at once."</p>

<p>"No, no, go away; I will see you in the morning."</p>

<p>"You will see me now," I said; "I am coming in there."</p>

<p>I was halfway across the room, when the door opened and Fal
Sivas, livid with rage, stepped into the room and closed the door
behind him.</p>

<p>"You dare? You dare?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Gar Nal's ship is not in its hangar," I said.</p>

<p>That seemed to bring him to his senses, but it did not lessen
his rage; it only turned it in another direction.</p>

<p>"The calot!" he exclaimed, "the son of a thousand million
calots! He has beaten me. He will go to Thuria. With the great
wealth that he will bring back, he will do all that I had hoped to
do."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "Ur Jan is with him, and what such a combination
as Ur Jan and a great and unscrupulous scientist could do is
incalculable; but you too have a ship, Fal Sivas. It is ready. You
and I could go to Thuria. They would not suspect that we were
coming. We would have all the advantage. We could destroy Gar Nal
and his ship, and then you would be master."</p>

<p>He paled. "No, no," he said, "I can't. I can't do it."</p>

<p>"Why not?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Thuria is a long way. No one knows what might happen. Perhaps
something would go wrong with the ship. It might not work in
practice as it should in theory. There might be strange beasts and
terrible men on Thuria."</p>

<p>"But you built this ship to go to Thuria," I cried. "You told me
so, yourself."</p>

<p>"It was a dream," he mumbled; "I am always dreaming, for in
dreams nothing bad can happen to me; but in Thuria&mdash;oh, it is
so far, so high above Barsoom. What if something happened?"</p>

<p>And now I understood. The man was an arrant coward. He was
allowing his great dream to collapse about his ears because he did
not have the courage to undertake the great adventure.</p>

<p>What was I to do? I had been depending upon Fal Sivas, and now
he had failed me. "I cannot understand you," I said; "with your own
arguments, you convinced me that it would be a simple thing to go
to Thuria in your ship. What possible danger can confront us there
that we may not overcome? We shall be veritable giants on Thuria.
No creature that lives there could withstand us. With the stamp of
a foot, we could crush the lives from the greatest beasts that
Thuria could support."</p>

<p>I had been giving this matter considerable thought ever since
there first appeared a likelihood that I might go to Thuria. I am
no scientist, and my figures may not be accurate, but they are
approximately true. I knew that the diameter of Thuria was supposed
to be about seven miles, so that its volume could be only about two
percent of that of, let us say, the Earth, that you may have a
comparison that will be more understandable to you.</p>

<p>I estimated that if there were human beings on Thuria and they
were proportioned to their environment as man on Earth is to his,
they would be but about nine-and-a-half inches tall and weigh
between four and five pounds; and that an earth-man transported to
Mars would be able to jump 225 feet into the air, make a standing
broad jump of 450 feet and a running broad jump of 725 feet, and
that a strong man could lift a mass equivalent to a weight of 4
tons on earth. Against such a Titan, the tiny creatures of Thuria
would be helpless&mdash;provided, of course, that Thuria were
inhabited.</p>

<p>I suggested all this to Fal Sivas, but he shook his head
impatiently. "There is something that you do not know," he said.
"Perhaps Gar Nal, himself, does not know it. There is a peculiar
relationship between Barsoom and her moons that does not exist
between any of the other planets in the solar system and their
satellites. The suggestion was made by an obscure scientist
thousands of years ago, and then it seemed to have been forgotten.
I discovered it in an ancient manuscript that I came upon by
accident. It is in the original handwriting of the investigator and
may have had no distribution whatsoever.</p>

<p>"However, the idea intrigued me; and over a period of twenty
years I sought either to prove or disprove it. Eventually, I proved
it conclusively."</p>

<p>"And what is it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"There exists between Barsoom and her satellites a peculiar
relation which I have called a compensatory adjustment of masses.
For example, let us consider a mass traveling from Barsoom to
Thuria. As it approaches the nearer moon, it varies directly as the
influences of the planet and the satellite vary. The ratio of the
mass to the mass of Barsoom at the surface of Barsoom, therefore,
would be the same as the ratio of the mass to the mass of Thuria,
at the surface of Thuria.</p>

<p>"You were about right in assuming that an inhabitant of Thuria,
if such exists, if he were of the same proportion to Thuria as you
are to Barsoom, would be about eight sofs tall; and consequently,
if my theory is correct, and I have no reason to doubt it, were you
to travel from Barsoom to Thuria you would be but eight sofs tall
when you reached the surface of the moon."</p>

<p>"Preposterous!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>He flushed angrily. "You are nothing but an ignorant assassin,"
he cried. "How dare you question the knowledge of Fal Sivas? But
enough of this; return to your quarters. I must get on with my
work."</p>

<p>"I am going to Thuria," I said; "and if you won't go with me, I
shall go alone."</p>

<p>He had turned back to enter his little laboratory, but I had
followed him and was close behind him.</p>

<p>"Go away from here," he said; "keep out, or I will have you
killed."</p>

<p>Just then I heard a cry from the room behind him, and a woman's
voice calling, "Vandor! Vandor, save me!"</p>

<p>Fal Sivas went livid and tried to dash into the room and close
the door in my face, but I was too quick for him. I leaped to the
door and pushed him aside as I stepped in.</p>

<p>A terrible sight met my eyes. On marble slabs, raised about four
feet from the floor, several women were securely strapped, so that
they could not move a limb or raise their heads. There were four of
them. Portions of the skulls of three had been removed, but they
were still conscious. I could see their frightened, horrified eyes
turn toward us.</p>

<p>I turned upon Fal Sivas. "What is the meaning of this?" I cried.
"What hellish business are you up to?"</p>

<p>"Get out! Get out!" he screamed. "How dare you invade the holy
precincts of science? Who are you, dog, worm, to question what Fal
Sivas does; to interfere with the work of a brain the magnitude of
which you cannot conceive? Get out! Get out! or I will have you
killed."</p>

<p>"And who will kill me?" I demanded. "Put these poor creatures
out of their misery, and then I will attend to you."</p>

<p>So great was either his rage or his terror, or both, that he
trembled all over like a man with the palsy; and then, before I
could stop him, he turned and darted from the room.</p>

<p>I knew that he had gone for help; that presently I should
probably have all the inmates of his hellish abode upon me.</p>

<p>I might have pursued him, but I was afraid that something might
happen here while I was gone, and so I turned back to the girl on
the fourth slab. It was Zanda.</p>

<p>I stepped quickly to her side. I saw that she had not yet been
subjected to Fal Sivas's horrid operation, and drawing my dagger I
cut the bonds that held her. She slipped from the table and threw
her arms about my neck. "Oh, Vandor, Vandor," she cried, "now we
must both die. They come! I hear them."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap13" id="chap13">XIII. &mdash; PURSUED</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Heralding the approach of armed men was the clank
of metal on metal. How many were coming, I did not know; but here I
was with only my own sword between me and death and my back against
the wall.</p>

<p>Zanda was without hope, but she remained cool and did not lose
her head. In those few brief moments I could see that she was
courageous.</p>

<p>"Give me your dagger, Vandor," she said.</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They will kill you, but Fal Sivas shall not have me nor these
others to torture further."</p>

<p>"I am not dead, yet," I reminded her.</p>

<p>"I shall not kill myself until you are dead; but these others,
there is no hope for them. They pray for merciful death. Let me put
them out of their misery."</p>

<p>I winced at the thought, but I knew that she was right, and I
handed her my dagger. It was a thing that I should have had to have
done myself. It took much more courage than facing armed men, and I
was glad to be relieved of the ghastly job.</p>

<p>Zanda was behind me now. I could not see what she was doing, and
I never asked her what she did.</p>

<p>Our enemies had paused in the outer room. I could hear them
whispering together. Then Fal Sivas raised his voice and shouted to
me.</p>

<p>"Come out of there and give yourself up," he screamed, "or we
will come in and kill you."</p>

<p>I did not reply; I just stood there, waiting. Presently Zanda
came close to me and whispered, "There is a door on the opposite
side of this room, hidden behind a large screen. If you wait here,
Fal Sivas will send men to that door; and they will attack you from
in front and behind."</p>

<p>"I shall not wait, then," I said, moving toward the door leading
into the outer room where I had heard my enemies whispering.</p>

<p>Zanda laid a hand upon my arm, "Just a moment, Vandor," she
said. "You remain where you are, facing the door; and I will go to
it and swing it open suddenly. Then they cannot take you by
surprise, as they could if you were to open it."</p>

<p>The door was hinged so that it swung in, and thus Zanda would be
protected as she drew it inward and stepped behind it.</p>

<p>Zanda stepped forward and grasped the handle while I stood
directly in front of the door and a few paces from it, my long
sword in my hand.</p>

<p>As she opened the door, a sword flashed inward in a terrific cut
that would have split my skull had I been there.</p>

<p>The man who wielded the sword was Hamas. Just behind him, I saw
Phystal and another armed man, while in the rear was Fal Sivas.</p>

<p>Now the old inventor commenced to scream at them and urge them
on; but they held back, for only one man could pass through the
doorway at a time; and none of them seemed to relish the idea of
being the first. In fact, Hamas had leaped back immediately
following his cut; and now his voice joined with that of Fal Sivas
in exhorting the other two to enter the laboratory and destroy
me.</p>

<p>"On, men!" cried Hamas. "We are three, and he is only one.
Onward, you, Phystal! Kill the calot!"</p>

<p>"In with you, yourself, Hamas," growled Phystal.</p>

<p>"Go in! Go in and get him!" shrieked Fal Sivas. "Go in, you
cowards." But no one came in; they just stood there, each urging
the other to be first.</p>

<p>I did not relish this waste of time, and for two reasons. In the
first place, I could not abide the thought of even a moment's
unnecessary delay in starting out upon my quest for Dejah Thoris;
and, secondly, there was always the danger that reinforcements
might arrive. Therefore, if they would not come in to me, I would
have to go out to them.</p>

<p>And I did go out to them, and so suddenly that it threw them
into confusion. Hamas and Phystal, in their efforts to avoid me,
fell back upon the man behind them. He was only a slave, but he was
a brave man&mdash;the bravest of the four that faced me.</p>

<p>He pushed Phystal and Hamas roughly aside and sprang at me with
his long sword.</p>

<p>Fal Sivas shouted encouragement to him.</p>

<p>"Kill him, Wolak!" he shrieked; "kill him and you shall have
your freedom."</p>

<p>At that, Wolak rushed me determinedly. I was fighting for my
life, but he was fighting for that and something even sweeter than
life; and now Hamas and Phystal were creeping in on me&mdash;like
two cowardly jackals, they hovered at the edge of the fight,
waiting to rush in when they might do so without endangering
themselves.</p>

<p>"Your weight in gold, Wolak, if you kill him," screamed Fal
Sivas.</p>

<p>Freedom and wealth! Now, indeed, did my antagonist seem
inspired. Life, liberty, and riches! What a princely reward for
which to strive; but I, too, was fighting for a priceless treasure,
for my incomparable Dejah Thoris.</p>

<p>The impetuosity of the man's attack had driven me back a couple
of paces, so that I now stood at the doorway, which was really a
most strategic position in that it prevented either Hamas or
Phystal from attacking me from the side.</p>

<p>Just behind me stood Zanda, spurring me on with low words of
encouragement; but though I appreciated them, I did not need them.
I was already set to terminate the affair as quickly as
possible.</p>

<p>The edge of a Martian long sword is just as keen as a razor, and
the point needle-like in sharpness. It is a trick to preserve this
keen edge during a combat, taking the blows of your adversary's
weapon on the back of your blade; and I prided myself upon my
ability to do this, saving the keen cutting edge for the purpose
for which it is intended. I needed a sharp edge now, for I was
preparing to execute a little trick that I had successfully used
many times before.</p>

<p>My adversary was a good swordsman and exceptionally strong on
defense; so that, in ordinary swordplay, he might have prolonged
the duel for a considerable time. For this, I had no mind. I wished
to end it at once.</p>

<p>In preparation, I pushed him back; then I thrust at his face. He
did the very thing that I knew he would do. He threw his head back,
involuntarily, to avoid my point; and this brought his chin up
exposing his throat. With my blade still extended, I cut quickly
from right to left. The point of my sword moved but a few inches,
but its keen edge opened his throat almost from ear to ear.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the look of horror in his eyes as he
staggered back and crumpled to the floor.</p>

<p>Then I turned my attention to Hamas and Phystal.</p>

<p>Each of them wanted the other to have the honor of engaging me.
As they retreated, they made futile passes at me with their points;
and I was steadily pushing them into a corner when Fal Sivas took a
hand in the affair.</p>

<p>Heretofore, he had contented himself with screaming shrill
encouragement and commands to his men. Now he picked up a vase and
hurled it at my head.</p>

<p>Just by chance, I saw it coming and dodged it; and it broke into
a thousand fragments against the wall. Then he picked up something
else and threw at me, and this time he hit my sword hand, and
Phystal nearly got me then.</p>

<p>As I jumped back to avoid his thrust, Fal Sivas hurled another
small object; and from the corner of my eye I saw Zanda catch
it.</p>

<p>Neither Phystal nor Hamas was a good swordsman, and I could
easily have overcome them in fair fight, but I could see that these
new tactics of Fal Sivas were almost certain to prove my undoing.
If I turned upon him, the others would be behind me; and how they
would have taken advantage of such a God-given opportunity!</p>

<p>I tried to work them around so that they were between Fal Sivas
and myself. In this way, they would shield me from his missiles,
but that is something easier said than done when you are fighting
two men in a comparatively small room.</p>

<p>I was terribly handicapped by the fact that I had to watch three
men; and now, as I drove Hamas back with a cut, I cast a quick
glance in the direction of Fal Sivas; and as I did so, I saw a
missile strike him between the eyes. He fell to the floor like a
log. Zanda had hoisted him with his own petard.</p>

<p>I could not repress a smile as I turned my undivided attention
upon Hamas and Phystal.</p>

<p>As I drove them into a corner, Hamas surprised me by throwing
his sword aside and falling upon his knees.</p>

<p>"Spare me, spare me, Vandor!" he cried, "I did not want to
attack you. Fal Sivas made me." And then Phystal cast his weapon to
the floor; and he, too, went upon his marrow bones. It was the most
revolting exhibition of cowardice that I had ever witnessed. I felt
like running them through, but I did not want to foul my blade with
their putrid blood.</p>

<p>"Kill them," counseled Zanda; "you cannot trust either of
them."</p>

<p>I shook my head. "We cannot kill unarmed men in cold blood," I
said.</p>

<p>"Unless you do, they will prevent our escape," she said, "even
if we can escape. There are others who will stop us on the lower
level."</p>

<p>"I have a better plan, Zanda," I said, and forthwith I bound
Hamas and Phystal securely in their own harness and then did the
same with Fal Sivas, for he was not dead but only stunned. I also
gagged all three of them so that they could not cry out.</p>

<p>This done, I told Zanda to follow me and went at once to the
hangar where the ship rested on her scaffolding.</p>

<p>"Why did you come here?" asked Zanda. "We ought to be getting
out of the building as quickly as possible&mdash;you are going to
take me with you, aren't you, Vandor?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I am," I said, "and we are going out of the building
very shortly. Come, perhaps I shall need your help with these
doors," and I led the way to the two great doors in the end of the
hangar. They were well hung, however, and after being unlatched,
slid easily to the sides of the opening.</p>

<p>Zanda stepped to the threshold and looked out. "We cannot escape
this way," she said; "it is fifty feet to the ground, and there is
no ladder or other means of descent."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, we are going to escape through that doorway," I
told her, amused at her mystification. "Just come with me, and you
will see how."</p>

<p>We returned to the side of the ship, and I must say that I was
far from being as assured of success as I tried to pretend, as I
concentrated my thoughts upon the little metal sphere that held the
mechanical brain in the nose of the craft.</p>

<p>I think my heart stopped beating as I waited, and then a great
wave of relief surged through me as I saw the door open and the
ladder lowering itself toward the floor.</p>

<p>Zanda looked on in wide-eyed amazement. "Who is in there?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>"No one," I said. "Now up with you, and be quick about it. We
have no time to loiter here."</p>

<p>She was evidently afraid, but she obeyed me like a good soldier,
and I followed her up the ladder into the cabin. Then I directed
the brain to hoist the ladder and close the door, as I went forward
into the control room, followed by the girl.</p>

<p>Here I again focused my thoughts upon the mechanical brain just
above my head. Even with the demonstration that I had already had,
I could not yet convince myself of the reality of what I was doing.
It seemed impossible that that insensate thing could raise the
craft from its scaffolding and guide it safely through the doorway,
yet scarcely had I supplied that motivating thought when the ship
rose a few feet and moved almost silently toward the aperture.</p>

<p>As we passed out into the still night, Zanda threw her arms
about my neck. "Oh, Vandor, Vandor!" she cried, "you have saved me
from the clutches of that horrible creature. I am free! I am free
again!" she cried, hysterically. "Oh, Vandor, I am yours; I shall
be your slave forever. Do with me whatever you will."</p>

<p>I could see that she was distraught and hysterical.</p>

<p>"You are excited, Zanda," I said, soothingly. "You owe me
nothing. You are a free woman. You do not have to be my slave or
the slave of any other."</p>

<p>"I want to be your slave, Vandor," she said, and then in a very
low voice, "I love you."</p>

<p>Gently I disengaged her arms from about my neck. "You do not
know what you are saying, Zanda," I told her; "your gratitude has
carried you away. You must not love me; my heart belongs to someone
else, and there is another reason why you must not say that you
love me&mdash;a reason that you will learn sooner or later, and
then you will wish that you had been stricken dumb before you ever
told me that you loved me."</p>

<p>I was thinking of her hatred of John Carter and her avowed
desire to kill him.</p>

<p>"I do not know what you mean," she said; "but if you tell me not
to love you, I will try to obey you, for no matter what you say, I
am your slave. I owe my life to you, and I shall always be your
slave."</p>

<p>"We will talk about that some other time," I said; "just now I
have something to tell you that may make you wish that I had left
you in the house of Fal Sivas."</p>

<p>She knitted her brows and looked at me questioningly. "Another
mystery?" she asked. "Again you speak in riddles."</p>

<p>"We are going on a long and dangerous journey in this ship,
Zanda. I am forced to take you with me because I cannot risk
detection by landing you anywhere in Zodanga; and, of course, it
would be signing your death warrant to set you down far beyond the
walls of the city."</p>

<p>"I do not want to be set down in Zodanga or outside it," she
replied. "Wherever you are going, I want to go with you. Some day
you may need me, Vandor; and then you will be glad that I am
along."</p>

<p>"Do you know where we are going, Zanda?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "and I do not care. It would make no difference
to me, even if you were going to Thuria."</p>

<p>I smiled at that, and turned my attention again to the
mechanical brain, directing it to take us to the spot where Jat Or
waited; and just then I heard the wailing signal of a patrol boat
above us.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14">XIV. &mdash; ON TO THURIA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Although I had realized the likelihood of our
strange craft being discovered by a patrol boat, I had hoped that
we might escape from the city without detection. I knew that if we
did not obey their command they would open fire on us, and a single
hit might put an end to all my plans to reach Thuria and save Dejah
Thoris.</p>

<p>While the armament of the ship, as described to me by Fal Sivas,
would have given me an overwhelming advantage in an encounter with
any patrol boat, I hesitated to stand and fight, because of the
chance that a lucky shot from the enemy's ship might disable
us.</p>

<p>Fal Sivas had boasted of the high potential speed of his brain
conception; and I decided that however much I might dislike to flee
from an enemy, flight was the safest course to pursue.</p>

<p>Zanda had her face pressed to one of the numerous ports in the
hull of the ship. The wail of the patrol boat siren was now
continuous&mdash;an eerie, menacing voice in the night, that
pierced the air like sharp daggers.</p>

<p>"They are overhauling us, Vandor," said Zanda; "and they are
signaling other patrol boats to their aid."</p>

<p>"They have probably noticed the strange lines of this craft; and
not only their curiosity, but their suspicion has been
aroused."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We are going to put the speed of Fal Sivas's motor to a test,"
I replied.</p>

<p>I glanced up at the insensate metal sphere above my head. "Speed
up! Faster! Escape the pursuing patrol boat!" Such were the
directing thoughts that I imparted to the silent thing above me;
then I waited.</p>

<p>I did not, however, have long to wait. No sooner had my thoughts
impinged upon the sensitive mechanism than the accelerated whirr of
the almost noiseless motor told me that my directions had been
obeyed.</p>

<p>"She is no longer gaining on us," cried Zanda excitedly. "We
have leaped ahead; we are outdistancing her."</p>

<p>The swift staccato of rapid fire burst upon our ears. Our enemy
had opened fire upon us, and almost simultaneously, intermingling
with the shots, we heard in the distance the wail of other sirens
apprising us of the fact that reinforcements were closing in upon
us.</p>

<p>The swift rush of the thin air of Mars along the sides of our
ship attested our terrific speed. The lights of the city faded
swiftly behind us. The searchlights of the patrol boats were
rapidly diminishing bands of light across the starlit sky.</p>

<p>I do not know how fast we were going but probably in the
neighborhood of 1350 haads an hour.</p>

<p>We sped low above the ancient sea bottom that lies west of
Zodanga; and then, in a matter of about five minutes&mdash;it could
not have been much more&mdash;our speed slackened rapidly, and I
saw a small flier floating idly in the still air just ahead of
us.</p>

<p>I knew that it must be the flier upon which Jat Or awaited me,
and I directed the brain to bring our ship alongside it and
stop.</p>

<p>The response of the ship to my every thought direction was
uncanny; and when we came alongside of Jat Or's craft and seemingly
ghostly hands opened the door in the side of our ship, I
experienced a brief sensation of terror, as though I were in the
power of some soulless Frankenstein; and this notwithstanding the
fact that every move of the ship had been in response to my own
direction.</p>

<p>Jat Or stood on the narrow deck of his small flier gazing in
astonishment at the strange craft that had drawn alongside.</p>

<p>"Had I not been expecting this," he said, "I should have been
streaking it for Helium by now. It is a sinister-looking affair
with those great eyes giving it the appearance of some unworldly
monster."</p>

<p>"You will find that impression intensified when you have been
aboard her for a while," I told him. "She is very 'unworldly' in
many respects."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to come aboard now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "after we make disposition of your flier."</p>

<p>"What shall we do with it?" he asked. "Are you going to abandon
it?"</p>

<p>"Set your destination compass on Helium, and open your throttle
to half speed. When you are under way, we will come alongside again
and take you aboard. One of the patrol boats at Helium will pick up
the flier and return it to my hangar."</p>

<p>He did as I had bid, and I directed the brain to take us
alongside of him after he had gotten under way. A moment later he
stepped into the cabin of Fal Sivas's craft.</p>

<p>"Comfortable," he commented; "the old boy must be something of a
Sybarite."</p>

<p>"He believed in being comfortable," I replied, "but love of
luxury has softened his fibre to such an extent that he was afraid
to venture abroad in his ship after he had completed it."</p>

<p>Jat Or turned to look about the cabin, and it chanced that his
eyes fell upon the doors in the side of the ship just as I directed
the brain to close them. He voiced an ejaculation of
astonishment.</p>

<p>"In the name of my first ancestor," he exclaimed, "who is
closing those doors? I don't see anyone, and you have not moved or
touched any sort of operating device since I came aboard."</p>

<p>"Come forward into the control room," I said, "and you shall see
the entire crew of this craft reposing in a metal case not much
larger than your fist."</p>

<p>As we entered the control room, Jat Or saw Zanda for the first
time. I could see his surprise reflected in his eyes, but he was
too well bred to offer any comment.</p>

<p>"This is Zanda, Jat Or," I said. "Fal Sivas was about to remove
her skull in the interests of science when I interrupted him this
evening. The poor girl was forced to choose between the lesser of
two evils; that is why she is with me."</p>

<p>"That statement is a little misleading," said Zanda. "Even if my
life had not been in danger and I had been surrounded by every
safeguard and luxury, I would still have chosen to go with Vandor,
even to the end of the universe."</p>

<p>"You see, Jat Or," I remarked, with a smile, "the young lady
does not know me very well; when she does, she will very probably
change her mind."</p>

<p>"Never," said Zanda.</p>

<p>"Wait and see," I cautioned her.</p>

<p>On our trip from Helium to Zodanga, I had explained to Jat Or
the marvellous mechanism that Fal Sivas called a mechanical brain;
and I could see the young padwar's eyes searching the interior of
the control room for this marvellous invention.</p>

<p>"There it is," I said, pointing at the metal sphere slightly
above his head in the nose of the craft.</p>

<p>"And that little thing drives the ship and opens the doors?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"The motors drive the ship, Jat Or," I told him, "and other
motors operate the doors and perform various other mechanical
duties aboard the craft. The mechanical brain merely operates them
as our brains would direct our hands to certain duties."</p>

<p>"That thing thinks?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"To all intents and purposes, it functions as would a human
brain, the only difference being that it cannot originate
thought."</p>

<p>The padwar stood gazing at the thing in silence for several
moments. "It gives me a strange feeling," he said at last, "a
helpless feeling, as though I were in the power of some creature
that was omnipotent and yet could not reason."</p>

<p>"I have much the same sensation," I admitted, "and I cannot help
but speculate upon what it might do if it could reason."</p>

<p>"I, too, tremble to think of it," said Zanda, "if Fal Sivas has
imparted to it any of the heartless ruthlessness of his own
mind."</p>

<p>"It is his creature," I reminded her.</p>

<p>"Then let us hope that it may never originate a thought."</p>

<p>"That, of course, would be impossible," said Jat Or.</p>

<p>"I do not know about that," replied Zanda. "Such a thing was in
Fal Sivas's mind. He was, I know, working to that end; but whether
he succeeded in imparting the power of original thought to this
thing, I do not know. I know that he not only hoped to accomplish
this miracle eventually, but that he was planning also to impart
powers of speech to this horrible invention."</p>

<p>"Why do you call it horrible?" asked Jat Or.</p>

<p>"Because it is inhuman and unnatural," replied the girl.
"Nothing good could come out of the mind of Fal Sivas. The thing
you see there was conceived in hate and lust and greed, and it was
contrived for the satisfaction of such characteristics in Fal
Sivas. No ennobling or lofty thoughts went into its fabrication;
and none could emanate from it, had it the power of original
thought."</p>

<p>"But our purpose is lofty and honorable," I reminded her; "and
if it serves us in the consummation of our hope, it will have
accomplished good."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I fear it," replied Zanda. "I hate it because it
reminds me of Fal Sivas."</p>

<p>"I hope that it is not meditating upon these candid avowals,"
remarked Jat Or.</p>

<p>Zanda slapped an open palm across her lips, her wide eyes
reflecting a new terror. "I had not thought of that," she
whispered. "Perhaps this very minute it is planning its
revenge."</p>

<p>I could not but laugh at her fear. "If any harm befalls us
through that brain, Zanda," I said, "you may lay the blame at my
door, for it is my mind that shall actuate it as long as the ship
remains in my possession."</p>

<p>"I hope you are right," she said, "and that it will bear us
safely wherever you wish to go."</p>

<p>"And suppose we get to Thuria alive?" interjected Jat Or. "You
know I have been wondering about that. I have been giving the
matter considerable thought, naturally, since you said that that
was to be our destination; and I am wondering how we will fare on
that tiny satellite. We shall be so out of proportion in size to
anything that we may find there."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we shall not be," I said, and then I explained to him
the theory of compensatory adjustment of masses as Fal Sivas had
expounded it to me.</p>

<p>"It sounds preposterous," said Jat Or.</p>

<p>I shrugged. "It does to me, too," I admitted; "but no matter how
much we may abhor Fal Sivas's character, we cannot deny the fact
that he has a marvellous scientific brain; and I am going to hold
my opinion in abeyance until we reach the surface of Thuria."</p>

<p>"At least," said Jat Or, "no matter what the conditions there
may be, the abductors of the princess will have no advantage over
us if we find them there."</p>

<p>"Do you doubt that we shall find them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It is merely a matter of conjecture, one way or another," he
replied; "but it does not seem within the realms of possibility
that two inventors, working independently of one another, could
each have conceived and built two identical ships capable of
crossing the airless void between here and Thuria, under the
guidance of mechanical brains."</p>

<p>"But as far as I know," I replied, "Gar Nal's craft is not so
operated. Fal Sivas does not believe that Gar Nal has produced such
a brain. He does not believe that the man has even conceived the
possibility of one, and so we may assume that Gar Nal's craft is
operated by Gar Nal, or at least wholly by human means."</p>

<p>"Then which ship has the better chance to reach Thuria?" asked
Jat Or.</p>

<p>"According to Fal Sivas," I replied, "there can be no question
about that. This mechanical brain of his cannot make mistakes."</p>

<p>"If we accept that," said Jat Or, "then we must also accept the
possibility of Gar Nal's human brain erring in some respects in its
calculations."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It just occurred to me that through some error in calculations
Gar Nal might not reach Thuria; whereas, directed by an errorless
brain, we are certain to."</p>

<p>"I had not thought of that," I said, "I was so obsessed by the
thought that Gar Nal and Ur Jan were taking their victim to Thuria
that I never gave a thought to the possibility that they might not
be able to get there."</p>

<p>The idea distressed me, for I realized how hopeless my quest
must be if we reached Thuria only to find that Dejah Thoris was not
there. Where could I look for her? Where could I hope to find her
in the illimitable reaches of space? But I soon cast these thoughts
from me, for worry is a destructive force that I have tried to
eliminate from my philosophy of life.</p>

<p>Zanda looked at me with a puzzled expression. "We are really
going to Thuria?" she asked. "I do not understand why anyone should
want to go to Thuria; but I am content to go, if you go. When do we
start, Vandor?"</p>

<p>"We are well on our way, now," I replied. "The moment that Jat
Or came aboard, I directed the brain to head for Thuria at full
speed."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15">XV. &mdash; THURIA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Later, as we hurtled on through the cold, dark
reaches of space, I urged Zanda and Jat Or to lie down and
rest.</p>

<p>Although we had no sleeping silks and furs we should not suffer,
as the temperature of the cabin was comfortable. I had directed the
brain to control this, as well as the oxygen supply, after we left
the surface of Barsoom.</p>

<p>There were narrow but comfortable divans in the cabin, as well
as a number of soft pillows; so there was no occasion for any of us
suffering during the trip.</p>

<p>We had left Barsoom about the middle of the eighth zode, which
is equivalent to midnight earth-time; and a rather rough
computation of the distance to be traveled and our estimated speed,
suggested that we should arrive on Thuria about noon of the
following day.</p>

<p>Jat Or wanted to stand watch the full time, but I insisted that
we must each get some sleep; so, on my promise to awaken him at the
end of five hours, he lay down.</p>

<p>While my two companions slept, I made a more careful examination
of the interior of the ship than I had been able to do at the time
that Fal Sivas had conducted me through it.</p>

<p>I found it well supplied with food, and in a chest in the
storeroom I also discovered sleeping silks and furs; but, of
course, what interested me most of all were the weapons. There were
long swords, short swords, and daggers, as well as a number of the
remarkable Barsoomian radium rifles and pistols, together with a
considerable quantity of ammunition for both.</p>

<p>Fal Sivas seemed to have forgotten nothing, yet all his thought
and care and efficiency would have gone for nothing had I not been
able to seize the ship. His own cowardice would have prevented him
from using it; and of course he would not have permitted another to
take it out, even had he believed that another brain than his could
have operated it, which he had been confident was not possible.</p>

<p>My inspection of the ship completed, I went into the control
room and looked out through one of the great eyes. The heavens were
a black void shot with cold and glittering points of light. How
different the stars looked when one had passed beyond the
atmosphere of the planet.</p>

<p>I looked for Thuria. She was nowhere in sight. The discovery was
a distinct shock. Had the mechanical brain failed us? While I was
wasting my time inspecting the ship, was it bearing us off into
some remote corner of space?</p>

<p>I am not inclined to lose my head and become hysterical when
confronted by an emergency; nor, except when instant action is
required, do I take snap judgment. I am more inclined to think
things out carefully, and so I sat down on a bench in the control
room to work out my problem.</p>

<p>Just then Jat Or came in. "How long have I been sleeping?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Not long," I replied; "you had better go back and get all the
rest that you can."</p>

<p>"I am not sleepy," he said. "In fact it is rather difficult to
contemplate sleep when one is in the midst of such a thrilling
adventure. Think of it, my prince&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vandor," I reminded him.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I forget," he said; "but, anyway, as I was saying,
think of the possibilities; think of the tremendous possibilities
of this adventure; think of our situation."</p>

<p>"I have been thinking of it," I replied a little gloomily.</p>

<p>"In a few hours we shall be where no other Barsoomian has ever
been&mdash;upon Thuria."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," I replied.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Take a look ahead," I told him. "Do you see anything of
Thuria?"</p>

<p>He looked out of one of the round ports and then turned to the
other. "I don't see Thuria," he said.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," I replied. "And do you realize what that
suggests?"</p>

<p>He looked stunned for a moment. "You mean that we are not bound
for Thuria&mdash;that the brain has erred?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," I replied.</p>

<p>"How far is it from Barsoom to Thuria?" he asked.</p>

<p>"A little over 15,700 haads," I replied. "I estimated that we
should complete the trip in about five zodes."</p>

<p>Just then Thuria hurtled into view upon our right, and Jat Or
voiced an exclamation of relief. "I have it," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Your mechanical brain is functioning better than ours," he
replied. "During the ten zodes of a Barsoomian day, Thuria revolves
about our planet over three times; so while we were traveling to
the path of her orbit she would encircle Barsoom one and a half
times."</p>

<p>"And you think the mechanical brain has reasoned that out?"</p>

<p>"Unquestionably," he said; "and it will time our arrival to meet
the satellite in its path."</p>

<p>I scratched my head. "This raises another question that I had
not thought of before," I said.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Jat Or.</p>

<p>"The speed of our ship is approximately 3,250 haads per zode,
whereas Thuria is traveling at a rate of over 41,250 haads during
the same period."</p>

<p>Jat Or whistled. "Over twelve and a half times our speed," he
exclaimed. "How in the name of our first ancestor are we going to
catch her?"</p>

<p>I made a gesture of resignation. "I imagine we shall have to
leave that to the brain," I said.</p>

<p>"I hope it doesn't get us in the path of that hurtling mass of
destruction," said Jat Or.</p>

<p>"Just how would you make a landing if you were operating the
ship with your own brain?" I asked.</p>

<p>"We've got to take Thuria's force of gravity into
consideration," he said.</p>

<p>"That is just it," I replied. "When we get into the sphere of
her influence, we shall be pulled along at the same rate she is
going; and then we can make a natural landing."</p>

<p>Jat Or was looking out at the great orb of Thuria on our right.
"How perfectly tremendous she looks," he said. "It doesn't seem
possible that we have come close enough to make her took as large
as that."</p>

<p>"You forget," I said, "that as we approached her, we commenced
to grow smaller&mdash;to proportion ourselves to her size. When we
reach her surface, if we ever do, she will seem as large to us as
Barsoom does when we are on its surface."</p>

<p>"It all sounds like a mad dream to me," said Jat Or.</p>

<p>"I fully agree with you," I replied, "but you will have to admit
that it is going to be a most interesting dream."</p>

<p>As we sped on through space, Thuria hurtled across our bow and
eventually disappeared below the Eastern rim of the planet that lay
now so far below us. Doubtless, when she completed another
revolution, we should be within the sphere of her influence. Then,
and not until then, would we know the outcome of this phase of our
adventure.</p>

<p>I insisted now that Jat Or return to the cabin and get a few
hours' sleep, for none of us knew what lay in the future and to
what extent our reserves of strength, both physical and mental,
might be called upon.</p>

<p>Later on, I called Jat Or and lay down myself to rest. Through
it all, Zanda slept peacefully; nor did she awaken until after I
had had my sleep and returned to the control room.</p>

<p>Jat Or was sitting with his face glued to the starboard eye. He
did not look back at me, but evidently he heard me enter the
cabin.</p>

<p>"She is coming," he said in a tense whisper. "Issus! What a
magnificent and inspiring sight!"</p>

<p>I went to the port and looked out over his shoulder. There
before me was a great world, one crescent edge illuminated by the
sun beyond it. Vaguely I thought that I saw the contour of
mountains and valleys, lighter expanses that might have been sandy
desert or dead sea bottom, and dark masses that could have been
forests. A new world! A world that no earthman nor any Barsoomian
had ever visited.</p>

<p>I could have been thrilled beyond the power of words to express
at the thought of the adventure that lay before me had my mind not
been so overcast by fear for the fate of my princess. Thoughts of
her dominated all others, yet they did not crowd out entirely the
sense of magnificent mystery that the sight of this new world
aroused within me.</p>

<p>Zanda joined us now; and as she saw Thuria looming ahead, she
voiced a little exclamation of thrilled excitement. "We are very
close," she said.</p>

<p>I nodded. "It will not be long now before we know our fate," I
said. "Are you afraid?"</p>

<p>"Not while you are with me," she answered simply.</p>

<p>Presently I realized that we had changed our course. Thuria
seemed directly beneath us now instead of straight ahead. We were
within the sphere of her influence, and were being dragged through
space at her own tremendous velocity. Now we were spiraling
downward; the brain was functioning perfectly.</p>

<p>"I don't like the idea of landing on a strange world at night,"
said Jat Or.</p>

<p>"I am not so enthusiastic about it myself," I agreed. "I think
we had better wait until morning."</p>

<p>I then directed the brain to drop to within about two hundred
haads of the surface of the satellite and cruise slowly in the
direction of the coming dawn.</p>

<p>"And now, suppose we eat while we are waiting for daylight," I
suggested.</p>

<p>"Is there food on board, master?" inquired Zanda.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "you will find it in the storeroom abaft the
cabin."</p>

<p>"I will prepare it, master, and serve you in the cabin," she
said.</p>

<p>As she left the control room, Jat Or's eyes followed her. "She
does not seem like a slave," he said, "and yet she addresses you as
though she were your slave."</p>

<p>"I have told her that she is not," I said, "but she insists upon
maintaining that attitude. She was a prisoner in the house of Fal
Sivas, and she was assigned to me there to be my slave. She really
is the daughter of a lesser noble&mdash;a well-bred, intelligent,
cultured girl."</p>

<p>"And very beautiful," said Jat Or. "I think she loves you, my
prince."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she thinks it is love," I said, "but it is only
gratitude. If she knew who I were, even her gratitude would be
turned to hate. She has sworn to kill John Carter."</p>

<p>"But why?" demanded Jat Or.</p>

<p>"Because he conquered Zodanga; because all her sorrows resulted
from the fall of the city. Her father was killed; and, in grief,
her mother took the last long journey upon the bosom of Iss; so you
see she has good reason to hate John Carter, or at least she thinks
she has."</p>

<p>Presently Zanda called us, and we went into the cabin where she
had a meal spread upon a folding table.</p>

<p>She stood to wait upon us, but I insisted that she sit with us
and eat.</p>

<p>"It is not seemly," she said, "that a slave should sit with her
master."</p>

<p>"Again I tell you that you are not my slave, Zanda," I said. "If
you insist upon retaining this ridiculous attitude, I shall have to
give you away. Perhaps I shall give you to Jat Or. How would you
like that?"</p>

<p>She looked up at the handsome young padwar seated opposite her.
"Perhaps he would make a good master," she said, "but I shall be
slave to no one but Vandor."</p>

<p>"But how could you help it if I gave you to him?" I asked. "What
would you do about it?"</p>

<p>"I would kill either Jat Or or myself," she replied.</p>

<p>I laughed and stroked her hand. "I would not give you away if I
could," I said.</p>

<p>"If you could?" she demanded. "Why can't you?"</p>

<p>"Because I cannot give away a free woman. I told you once that
you were free, and now I tell you again in the presence of a
witness. You know the customs of Barsoom, Zanda. You are free now,
whether you wish to be or not."</p>

<p>"I do not wish to be free," she said; "but if it is your will,
Vandor, so be it." She was silent for a moment, and then she looked
up at me. "If I am not your slave," she asked, "what am I?"</p>

<p>"Just at present, you are a fellow adventurer," I replied, "an
equal, to share in the joys and sorrows of whatever may lie before
us."</p>

<p>"I am afraid that I shall be more of a hindrance than a help,"
she said, "but of course I can cook for you and minister to you. At
least I can do those things which are a woman's province."</p>

<p>"Then you will be more of a help than a hindrance," I told her.
"And to make sure that we shall not lose you, I shall detail Jat Or
to be your protector. He shall be responsible for your safety."</p>

<p>I could see that this pleased Jat Or, but I could not tell about
Zanda. I thought she looked a little hurt; but she flashed a quick
sweet smile at the young padwar, as though she were afraid he might
have guessed her disappointment and did not wish to hurt him.</p>

<p>As we cruised low over Thuria, I saw forests below us and
meandering lines of a lighter color that I took to be brooks or
rivers; and in the distance there were mountains. It seemed a most
beautiful and intriguing world.</p>

<p>I could not be sure about the water because it was generally
believed on Barsoom that her satellites were practically without
moisture. However, I have known scientists to be mistaken.</p>

<p>I was becoming impatient. It seemed that daylight would never
arrive, but at last the first rosy flush of dawn crept up behind
the mountain tops ahead of us; and slowly the details of this
strange world took form below us, as the scene in a photographic
print takes magic form beneath the developer.</p>

<p>We were looking down upon a forested valley, beyond which low
foothills, carpeted with lush vegetation, ran back to higher
mountains in the distance.</p>

<p>The colors were similar to those upon Barsoom&mdash;the scarlet
grasses, the gorgeous, strange-hued trees; but as far as our vision
reached, we saw no living thing.</p>

<p>"There must be life there," said Zanda, when Jat Or commented
upon this fact. "In all that wealth of beauty, there must be living
eyes to see and to admire."</p>

<p>"Are we going to land?" asked Jat Or.</p>

<p>"We came here to find Gar Nal's ship," I replied, "and we must
search for that first."</p>

<p>"It will be like looking for a tiny bead among the moss of a
dead sea bottom," said Jat Or.</p>

<p>I nodded. "I am afraid so," I said, "but we have come for that
purpose and that purpose alone."</p>

<p>"Look!" exclaimed Zanda. "What is that&mdash;there, ahead?"</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16">XVI. &mdash; INVISIBLE FOES</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Looking down in the direction that Zanda had
indicated, I saw what appeared to be a large building on the bank
of a river. The structure nestled in a clearing in the forest, and
where the rising sun touched its towers they sent back scintillant
rays of many-hued light.</p>

<p>One section of the building faced upon what appeared to be a
walled court, and it was an object lying in this court which
aroused our interest and excitement to a far greater extent than
the building itself.</p>

<p>"What do you think it is, Zanda?" I asked, for it was she who
had discovered it.</p>

<p>"I think that it is Gar Nal's ship," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?" asked Jat Or.</p>

<p>"Because it is so much like this one," she replied. "Both Gar
Nal and Fal Sivas stole ideas from one another whenever they could,
and I should be surprised indeed if their ships did not closely
resemble one another."</p>

<p>"I am sure that you are right, Zanda," I said. "It is not
reasonable to assume that the inhabitants of Thuria have, by some
miraculous coincidence, constructed a ship so similar to that of
Fal Sivas's; and the possibility is equally remote that a third
Barsoomian ship has landed on the satellite."</p>

<p>I directed the brain to spiral downward, and presently we were
flying at an altitude that gave us a clear view of the details of
the building and the surrounding terrain.</p>

<p>The more closely we approached the ship in the courtyard the
more certain we became that it was Gar Nal's; but nowhere did we
see any sign of Gar Nal, Ur Jan, or Dejah Thoris; nor, indeed, was
there any sign of life about the building or its grounds. The place
might have been the abode of the dead.</p>

<p>"I am going to ground the ship beside Gar Nal's," I said. "Look
to your weapons, Jat Or."</p>

<p>"They are ready, my&mdash;Vandor," he replied.</p>

<p>"I do not know how many fighting men are aboard that ship," I
continued. "There may be only Gar Nal and Ur Jan, or there may be
more. If the fight goes our way, we must not kill them all until we
are positive that the princess is with them.</p>

<p>"They left Barsoom at least a full day ahead of us; and while it
is only a remote possibility, still they may have made some
disposition of their prisoner already. Therefore, we must leave at
least one of them alive to direct us to her."</p>

<p>We were descending slowly. Every eye was on the alert. Zanda had
stepped from the control room a moment before, and now she returned
with the harness and weapons of a Martian warrior strapped to her
slender form.</p>

<p>"Why those?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You may need an extra sword hand," she replied. "You do not
know against how many foemen you will be pitted."</p>

<p>"Wear them, if you like," I said, "but remain in the ship where
you will be safe. Jat Or and I will take care of the fighting."</p>

<p>"I shall go with you and fight with you," said Zanda, quietly
but emphatically.</p>

<p>I shook my head. "No," I said; "you must do as I say and remain
on this ship."</p>

<p>She looked me steadily in the eye. "Against my will, you
insisted upon making me a free woman," she reminded me. "Now I
shall act as a free woman and not as a slave. I shall do as I
please."</p>

<p>I had to smile at that. "Very well," I said; "but if you come
with us, you will have to take your chances like any other fighting
man. Jat Or and I may be too busy with our own antagonists to be
able to protect you."</p>

<p>"I can take care of myself," said Zanda, simply.</p>

<p>"Please stay on board," pleaded Jat Or solicitously; but Zanda
only shook her head.</p>

<p>Our ship had settled quietly to the ground beside that of Gar
Nal. I caused the door in the port side to be opened and the ladder
lowered. Still there was no sign of life either on the other craft
or elsewhere about the castle. A deathly silence hung like a heavy
mantle over the entire scene.</p>

<p>Just a moment I stood in the doorway looking about; and then I
descended to the ground, followed by Jat Or and Zanda.</p>

<p>Before us loomed the castle, a strange weird building of
unearthly architecture, a building of many towers of various types,
some of them standing alone and some engaged in groups.</p>

<p>Partially verifying Fal Sivas's theory of the tremendous mineral
wealth of the satellite, the walls of the structure before us were
constructed of blocks of precious stones so arranged that their
gorgeous hues blended and harmonized into a mass of color that
defies description.</p>

<p>At the moment, however, I gave but cursory attention to the
beauties of the pile, turning my attention instead to Gar Nal's
ship. A door in its side, similar to that in our ship, was open;
and a ladder depended to the ground.</p>

<p>I knew that in ascending that ladder, a man would be at great
disadvantage if attacked from above; but there was no alternative.
I must discover if there were anyone on board.</p>

<p>I asked Zanda to stand at a little distance, so that she could
see into the interior of the ship and warn me if an enemy exhibited
himself. Then I mounted quickly.</p>

<p>As the ship was already resting on the ground, I had only to
ascend a few rungs of the ladder before my eyes were above the
level of the cabin floor. A quick glance showed me that no one was
in sight, and a moment later I stood inside the cabin of Gar Nal's
ship.</p>

<p>The interior arrangement was slightly different from that of Fal
Sivas's, nor was the cabin as richly furnished.</p>

<p>From the cabin, I stepped into the control room. No one was
there. Then I searched the aft of the ship. The entire craft
was deserted.</p>

<p>Returning to the ground, I reported my findings to Jat Or and
Zanda.</p>

<p>"It is strange," remarked Jat Or, "that no one has challenged us
or paid any attention to our presence. Can it be possible that the
whole castle is deserted?"</p>

<p>"There is something eerie about the place," said Zanda, in low,
tense tones. "Even the silence seems fraught with suppressed sound.
I see no one, I hear no one, and yet I feel&mdash;I know not
what."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> mysterious," I agreed. "The deserted appearance of
the castle is belied by the well-kept grounds. If there is no one
here now, it has not been deserted long."</p>

<p>"I have a feeling that it is not deserted now," said Jat Or. "I
seem to feel presences all around us. I could swear that eyes were
on us&mdash;many eyes, watching our every move."</p>

<p>I was conscious of much the same sensation myself. I looked up
at the windows of the castle, fully expecting to see eyes gazing
down upon us; but in none of the many windows was there a sign of
life. Then I called aloud, voicing the common peace greeting of
Barsoom.</p>

<p>"Kaor!" I shouted in tones that could have been heard anywhere
upon that side of the castle. "We are travelers from Barsoom. We
wish to speak to the lord of the castle."</p>

<p>Silence was my only answer.</p>

<p>"How uncanny!" cried Zanda. "Why don't they answer us? There
must be someone here; there <i>is</i> someone here. I know it! I
cannot see them, but there are people here. They are all around
us."</p>

<p>"I am sure that you are right, Zanda," I said. "There must be
someone in that castle, and I am going to have a look inside it.
Jat Or, you and Zanda wait here."</p>

<p>"I think we should all go together," said the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Jat Or; "we must not separate."</p>

<p>I saw no valid objection to the plan, and so I nodded my
acquiescence; then I approached a closed door in the face of the
castle wall. Behind me came Jat Or and Zanda.</p>

<p>We had crossed about half the distance from the ship to the
door, when at last suddenly, startlingly, the silence was shattered
by a voice, terror-ridden, coming from above, apparently from one
of the lofty towers overlooking the courtyard.</p>

<p>"Escape, my chieftain!" it cried. "Escape from this horrible
place while you may."</p>

<p>I halted, momentarily stunned&mdash;it was the voice of Dejah
Thoris.</p>

<p>"The princess!" exclaimed Jat Or.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "the princess. Come!" Then I started on a run
toward the door of the castle; but I had taken scarce a half dozen
steps, when just behind me Zanda voiced a piercing scream of
terror.</p>

<p>I wheeled instantly to see what danger confronted her.</p>

<p>She was struggling as though in the throes of convulsions. Her
face was contorted in horror; her staring eyes and the motions of
her arms and legs were such as they might have been had she been
battling with a foe, but she was alone. There was no one near
her.</p>

<p>Jat Or and I sprang toward her; but she retreated quickly, still
struggling. Darting to our right, and then doubling back, she moved
in the direction of the doorway in the castle wall.</p>

<p>She seemed not to move by the power of her own muscles but
rather as though she were being dragged away, yet still I saw no
one near her.</p>

<p>All that I take so long to tell, occurred in a few brief
seconds&mdash;before I could cover the short distance to her
side.</p>

<p>Jat Or had been closer to her; and he had almost overtaken her
when I heard him shout, "Issus! It has me, too."</p>

<p>He went to the ground then as though in a faint, but he was
struggling as Zanda struggled&mdash;as one who gives battle to an
assailant.</p>

<p>As I raced after Zanda my long sword was out, though I saw no
enemy whose blood it might drink.</p>

<p>Scarcely ever before in my life have I felt so futile, so
impotent. Here was I, the greatest swordsman of two worlds,
helpless in defense of my friends because I could not see their
foes.</p>

<p>In the grip of what malign power could they be that could
seemingly reach out through space from the concealment of some
hidden vantage point and hold them down or drag them about as it
wished?</p>

<p>How helpless we all were, our helplessness all the more
accentuated by the psychological effect of this mysterious and
uncanny attack.</p>

<p>My earthly muscles quickly brought me to Zanda's side. As I
reached out to seize her and stop her progress toward the castle
door, something seized one of my ankles; and I went down. I felt
hands upon me&mdash;many hands. My sword was torn from my grasp; my
other weapons were snatched away.</p>

<p>I fought, perhaps never as I have fought before. I felt the
bodies of my antagonists pressing against me. I felt their hands as
they touched me and their fists as they struck me; but I saw no
one, yet my own blows landed upon solid flesh. That was something.
It gave me a little greater sense of equality than before; but I
could not understand why, if I felt these creatures, I could not
see them.</p>

<p>At least, however, it partially explained the strange actions of
Zanda. Her seeming convulsions had been her struggles against these
unseen assailants. Now they were carrying her toward the doorway;
and as I battled futilely against great odds, I saw her disappear
within the castle.</p>

<p>Then the things, whatever they were that assailed me,
overpowered me by numbers. I knew that there were very many of
them, because there were so many, many hands upon me.</p>

<p>They bound my wrists behind my back and jerked me roughly to my
feet.</p>

<p>I cannot accurately describe my sensations; the unreality of all
that had occurred in those few moments left me dazed and uncertain.
For at least once in my life, I seemed wholly deprived of the power
to reason, possibly because the emergency was so utterly foreign to
anything that I had ever before experienced. Not even the phantom
bowmen of Lothar could have presented so unique a situation, for
these were visible when they attacked.</p>

<p>As I was jerked to my feet, I glanced about for Jat Or and saw
him near me, his hands similarly trussed behind his back.</p>

<p>Now I felt myself being pushed toward the doorway through which
Zanda had disappeared, and near me was Jat Or moving in the same
direction.</p>

<p>"Can you see anyone, my prince?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I can see you," I replied.</p>

<p>"What diabolical force is this that has seized us?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"I don't know," I replied, "but I feel hands upon me and the
warmth of bodies around me."</p>

<p>"I guess we are done for, my prince," he said.</p>

<p>"Done for?" I exclaimed. "We still live."</p>

<p>"No, I do not mean that," he said; "I mean that as far as ever
returning to Barsoom is concerned, we might as well give up all
hope. They have our ship. Do you think that even if we escape them,
we shall ever see it again, or at least be able to repossess it?
No, my friend, as far as Barsoom is concerned we are as good as
dead."</p>

<p>The ship! In the excitement of what I had just passed through I
had momentarily forgotten the ship. I glanced toward it. I thought
that I saw the rope ladder move as though to the weight of an
unseen body ascending it.</p>

<p>The ship! It was our only hope of ever again returning to
Barsoom, and it was in the hands of this mysterious unseen foe. It
must be saved.</p>

<p>There was a way! I centered my thoughts upon the mechanical
brain&mdash;I directed it to rise and wait above the castle, out
of harm's way, until I gave it further commands.</p>

<p>Then the invisible menace dragged me through the doorway into
the interior of the castle. I could not know if the brain had
responded to my directions.</p>

<p>Was I never to know?</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17">XVII. &mdash; THE CAT- MAN</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">My thoughts were still centered upon the brain in
the nose of Fal Sivas's ship as I was being conducted through a
wide corridor in the castle. I was depressed by the fear that I
might not have been able to impart my controlling directions to it
at so great a distance or while my brain was laboring under the
stress and excitement of the moment. The ship meant so much to us
all, and was so necessary to the rescue of Dejah Thoris, that the
thought of losing it was a stunning blow; yet presently I realized
that worrying about it would do no good, and so I expelled these
subversive thoughts from my mind.</p>

<p>Raising my eyes, I saw Jat Or moving along the corridor near me.
As he caught my eyes upon him, he shook his head and smiled
ruefully.</p>

<p>"It looks as though our adventure on Thuria might be short-
lived," he said.</p>

<p>I nodded. "The future doesn't look any too bright," I admitted.
"I have never been in such a situation before, where I could
neither see my enemy nor communicate with him."</p>

<p>"Nor hear him," added Jat Or. "Except for the feel of hands on
my arms and the knowledge that some force is dragging me along this
corridor, I am not conscious of the presence of any but ourselves
here. The mystery of it leaves me with a sense of utter
futility."</p>

<p>"But eventually we must find someone whom we can see and against
whom we can pit our own brain and fighting ability on a more
equable basis, for this castle and what we see about us indicate
the presence of creatures not unlike ourselves. Notice, for
instance, the benches and divans along the walls of this corridor.
They must have been intended for creatures like ourselves. The
beautiful mosaics that decorate the walls, the gorgeous rugs and
skins upon the floor&mdash;these things are here to satisfy a love of
beauty that is a peculiar attribute of the human mind, nor could
they have been conceived or produced except by human hands under
the guidance of human brains."</p>

<p>"Your deductions are faultless," replied Jat Or, "but where are
the people?"</p>

<p>"There lies the mystery," I replied. "I can well believe that
our future depends upon its solution."</p>

<p>"While I am concerned with all these questions," said Jat Or
presently, "I am more concerned with the fate of Zanda. I wonder
what they have done with her."</p>

<p>That, of course, I could not answer, although the fact that she
had been separated from us caused me no little concern.</p>

<p>At the end of the corridor, we were conducted up a wide and
ornate staircase to the next level of the castle; and presently we
were led into a large room&mdash;a vast chamber in which we saw at
the far end a single, lonely figure.</p>

<p>It was Zanda. She was standing before a dais upon which were two
large ornate throne chairs.</p>

<p>The room was gorgeous, almost barbaric in its decoration. Gold
and precious stones encrusted floor and walls. They had been
fabricated into an amazing design by some master artist who had had
at his disposal rare gems such as I had never seen either upon
earth or upon Barsoom.</p>

<p>The invisible force that propelled us conducted us to Zanda's
side; and there the three of us stood, facing the dais and the
empty throne chairs.</p>

<p>But I wondered if they were empty. I had that same strange
feeling that I had noticed in the courtyard, of being surrounded by
a multitude of people, of having many eyes fixed upon me; yet I saw
none and I heard no sound.</p>

<p>We stood there before the dais for several minutes, and then we
were dragged away and conducted from the room. Along another
corridor we were taken, a narrower corridor, and up a winding
stairway which Jat Or had some little difficulty in negotiating.
Such contrivances were new to him, as stairways are not used on
Mars, where inclined ramps lead from one level of a building to
another.</p>

<p>I had once tried to introduce stairways in my palace in Helium;
but so many of my household and my friends came near breaking their
necks on them, that I eventually replaced them with ramps.</p>

<p>After ascending several levels, Zanda was separated from us and
taken along a diverging corridor; and at another level above, Jat
Or was dragged away from me.</p>

<p>None of us had spoken since we had entered the great throne
room, and I think that now that we were being separated words
seemed wholly inadequate in the hopelessness of our situation.</p>

<p>Now I was quite alone; but yet up and up I climbed, guided by
those invisible hands upon my arms. Where were they taking me? To
what fate had they taken my companions? Somewhere in this great
castle was the princess whom I had crossed the void to find, yet
never had she seemed farther away from me than at this minute;
never had our separation seemed so utterly complete and final.</p>

<p>I do not know why I should have felt this way, unless again it
was the effect of this seemingly unfathomable mystery that
surrounded me.</p>

<p>We had ascended to such a great height that I was confident that
I was being conducted into one of the loftier towers in the castle
that I had seen from the courtyard. Something in this fact and the
fact that we had been separated suggested that whatever the power
that held us, it was not entirely certain of itself; for only fear
that we might escape or that, banded together, we might inflict
harm upon it, could have suggested the necessity for separating us;
but whether or not I reasoned from a correct premise was only
conjecture. Time alone could solve the mystery and answer the many
questions that presented themselves to my mind.</p>

<p>My mind was thus occupied when I was halted before a door. It
had a peculiar latch which attracted my attention, and while I was
watching it I saw it move as though a hand turned it; then the door
swung in, and I was dragged into the room beyond.</p>

<p>Here the bonds were cut from my wrists. I turned quickly
intending to make a bolt for the door; but before I could reach it,
it closed in my face. I tried to open it, but it was securely
locked; and then, disgusted, I turned away from it.</p>

<p>As I turned to inspect my prison, my eyes fell upon a figure
seated upon a bench at the far side of the room.</p>

<p>For want of a better word, I may describe the figure that I saw
as that of a man; but what a man!</p>

<p>The creature was naked except for a short leather skirt held
about its hips by a broad belt fastened by a huge golden buckle set
with precious stones.</p>

<p>He was seated upon a red bench against a panel of grey wall; and
his skin was exactly the color of the wall, except that portion of
his legs which touched the bench. They were red.</p>

<p>The shape of his skull was similar to that of a human being, but
his features were most inhuman. In the center of his forehead was a
single, large eye about three inches in diameter; the pupil a
vertical slit, like the pupils of a cat's eyes. He sat there eyeing
me with that great eye, apparently appraising me as I was
appraising him; and I could not but wonder if I presented as
strange an appearance to him as he did to me.</p>

<p>During those few moments that we remained motionless, staring at
one another, I hurriedly took note of several of his other strange
physical characteristics.</p>

<p>The fingers of his hands and four of the toes of each of his
feet were much longer than in the human race, while his thumbs and
large toes were considerably shorter than his other digits and
extended laterally at right angles to his hands and feet.</p>

<p>This fact and the vertical pupils of his eye suggested that he
might be wholly arboreal or at least accustomed to finding his food
or his prey in trees.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most outstanding features of his hideous
countenance were his mouths. He had two of them, one directly above
the other. The lower mouth, which was the larger, was lipless, the
skin of the face forming the gums in which the teeth were set, with
the result that his powerful white teeth were always exposed in a
hideous, death-like grin.</p>

<p>The upper mouth was round, with slightly protruding lips
controlled by a sphincter-like muscle. This mouth was
toothless.</p>

<p>His nose was wide and flat, with upturned nostrils. At first I
detected no ears, but later discovered that two small orifices near
the top of the head and at opposite sides served the purposes of
audition.</p>

<p>Starting slightly above his eye, a stiff yellowish mane about
two inches wide ran back along the center of his cranium.</p>

<p>All in all, he was a most unlovely spectacle; and that grinning
mouth of his and those powerful teeth, taken in connection with his
very noticeable muscular development, suggested that he might be no
mean antagonist.</p>

<p>I wondered if he were as ferocious as he looked, and it occurred
to me that I might have been locked in here with this thing that it
might destroy me. It even seemed possible that I might be intended
to serve as its food.</p>

<p>Not once since I had entered the room had the creature taken
that single, awful eye from me, nor in fact had I looked elsewhere
than at it; but now, having partially satisfied my curiosity
insofar as that could be accomplished by vision, I let my eyes
wander about the room.</p>

<p>It was circular and evidently occupied the entire area and
evidently the highest level of a tower. The walls were paneled in
different colors; and even here in this high-flung prison cell was
evidence of the artistic sensibilities of the builder of the
castle, for the room was indeed strangely beautiful.</p>

<p>The circular wall was pierced by half a dozen tall, narrow
windows. They were unglazed, but they were barred.</p>

<p>On the floor, against one portion of the wall, was a pile of
rugs and skins&mdash;probably the bedding of the creature
imprisoned here.</p>

<p>I walked toward one of the windows to look out, and as I did so
the creature rose from the bench and moved to the side of the room
farthest from me. It moved noiselessly with the stealthy tread of a
cat; and always it transfixed me with that terrible, lidless
eye.</p>

<p>Its silence, its stealth, its horrible appearance, made me wary
lest it leap upon my back should I turn my face away from it. Yet I
cast a hasty glance through the window and caught a glimpse of
distant hills and, below me, just outside the castle wall, a river
and beyond that a dense forest.</p>

<p>What little I saw suggested that the tower did not overlook the
courtyard in which the ship lay, and I was anxious to see that part
of the castle grounds to ascertain if I had been successful in
directing the brain to take the ship to a point of safety.</p>

<p>I thought that perhaps I might be able to discover this from one
of the windows on the opposite side of the tower; and so, keeping
my eyes on my cell-mate, I crossed the room; and as I did so he
quickly changed his position, keeping as far from me as
possible.</p>

<p>I wondered if he was afraid of me or if, cat-like, he was just
awaiting an opportunity to pounce on me when he could take me at a
disadvantage.</p>

<p>I reached the opposite window and looked out, but I could see
nothing of the courtyard, as others of the numerous towers of the
castle obstructed my view on this side. In fact, another loftier
tower rose directly in front of me in this direction and not more
than ten or fifteen feet distant from the one in which I was
incarcerated.</p>

<p>Similarly, I moved from window to window searching in vain for a
glimpse of the courtyard; and always my weird and terrible
cell-mate kept his distance from me.</p>

<p>Having convinced myself that I could not see the courtyard nor
discover what success I had had in saving the ship, I turned my
attention again to my companion.</p>

<p>I felt that I must learn something of what his attitude toward
me might be. If he were to prove dangerous, I must ascertain the
fact before night fell; for something seemed to tell me that that
great eye could see by night; and inasmuch I could not remain awake
forever, I must fall easy prey to him in the darkness of the night,
if his intentions were lethal.</p>

<p>As I glanced at him again, I noticed a surprising change in his
appearance. His skin was no longer grey but vivid yellow, and then
I noted that he was standing directly in front of a yellow panel.
This was interesting in the extreme.</p>

<p>I moved toward him, and again he changed his position. This time
he placed himself in front of a blue panel, and I saw the yellow
tint of his skin fade away and turn to blue.</p>

<p>On Barsoom there is a little reptile called a darseen which
changes its colors to harmonize with its background, just as do our
earthly chameleons; but I had never seen any creature even remotely
resembling a human being endowed with this faculty of protective
coloration. Here, indeed, was the most amazing of all the amazing
creatures that I have ever seen.</p>

<p>I wondered if it were endowed with speech, and so I addressed
it. "Kaor!" I said; "let's be friends," and I raised my sword hand
above my head with the palm toward him, indicating my friendly
intentions.</p>

<p>He looked at me for a moment; and then from his upper mouth
issued strange sounds, like the purring and meowing of a cat.</p>

<p>He was trying to speak to me, but I could not understand him any
more than he could understand me.</p>

<p>How was I to learn his intentions toward me before night
fell?</p>

<p>It seemed hopeless, and I resigned myself to wait with composure
whatever might occur. I therefore decided to ignore the presence of
the creature until it made advances, either hostile or otherwise;
and so I walked over and seated myself on the bench that it had
quitted.</p>

<p>Immediately it took up a new position as far from me as possible
and this time in front of a green panel, whereupon its color
immediately changed to green. I could not but wonder what
kaleidoscopic result would be obtained were I to chase the thing
around this multi-colored apartment. The thought caused me to
smile, and as I did so I saw an immediate reaction in my cell-
mate. He made a strange purring sound and stretched his upper mouth
laterally in what might have been an attempt at an answering smile.
At the same time he rubbed his palms up and down his thighs.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that the stretching of the mouth and the
rubbing of the thighs might constitute the outward expression of an
inner emotion and be intended to denote its attitude toward me; but
whether that attitude were friendly or hostile, I could not know.
Perhaps my smile had conveyed to the creature a meaning wholly at
variance with what a smile is usually intended to convey among the
human inhabitants of Earth or Mars.</p>

<p>I recalled that I had discovered this to be a fact among the
green men of Barsoom, who laugh the loudest when they are
inflicting the most diabolical tortures upon their victims;
although that is scarcely analogous to what I mean, as in the case
of the green Martians, it is the result of a highly specialized
perversion of the sense of humor.</p>

<p>Perhaps, on the other hand, the grimace and the gesture of the
creature constituted a challenge. If that were true, the sooner I
discovered it the better. In fact, it was far more necessary to
know the truth at once, if he were unfriendly, than if he were
friendly. If the former were true, I wanted to know it before
darkness fell.</p>

<p>It occurred to me that I might gain some knowledge of his
intentions by repeating his own gestures, and so I smiled at him
and rubbed my palms up and down my thighs.</p>

<p>His reaction was immediate. His upper mouth stretched sideways;
he came toward me. I stood up as he approached, and when he came
quite close to me, he stopped; and reaching forth one of his hands
stroked my upper arm.</p>

<p>I could not but believe that this was an overture of friendship,
and so I similarly stroked one of his arms.</p>

<p>The result astounded me. The creature leaped back from me, that
strange purring noise issuing from its lips; and then it broke into
a wild dance. With cat-like springs, it leaped and cavorted about
the room in wild abandon.</p>

<p>Hideous and grotesque as was its physical appearance, yet was I
impressed by the consummate grace of all its movements.</p>

<p>Three turns about the room it took, as I seated myself again
upon the bench and watched it; then, its dance completed, it came
and sat down beside me.</p>

<p>Once again it purred and meowed in an evident attempt to
communicate with me; but I could only shake my head, to indicate
that I did not understand, and speak to it in the tongue of
Barsoom.</p>

<p>Presently it ceased its meowing and addressed me in a language
that seemed far more human&mdash;a language that employed almost
the same vowel and consonant sounds as those languages of the human
race to which I am accustomed.</p>

<p>Here, at last, I detected a common ground upon which we might
discover mutual understanding.</p>

<p>It was obvious that the creature could not understand any
language that I could speak, and it would serve no purpose to
attempt to teach him any of them; but if I could learn his language
I would then be able to communicate with some of the inhabitants of
Thuria; and if the creatures of Thuria had a common language as did
the inhabitants of Mars, then my existence upon this tiny satellite
would be fraught with fewer difficulties.</p>

<p>But how to learn his language? That was the question. My captors
might not permit me to live long enough to learn anything; but if I
were to accept such an assumption as final, it would preclude me
from making any attempt to escape or to alleviate my condition
here. Therefore I must assume that I had plenty of time to learn
one of the languages of Thuria, and I immediately set about to do
so.</p>

<p>I commenced in the usual way that one learns a new language. I
pointed to various articles in the room and to various parts of our
bodies, repeating their names in my own language. My companion
seemed to understand immediately what I was attempting to do; and
pointing to the same articles himself, he repeated their names
several times in the more human of the two languages which he
seemed to command, if his meowings and purrings could be called a
language, a question which, at that time, I should have been unable
to answer.</p>

<p>We were thus engaged when the door to the room opened; and
several vessels appeared to float in and settle themselves on the
floor just inside the door, which was immediately closed.</p>

<p>My companion commenced to purr excitedly, and ran over to them.
He returned immediately with a jar of water and a bowl of food
which he set on the bench beside me. He pointed to the food and
then to me, as though indicating that it was mine.</p>

<p>Crossing the room once more, he returned with another jar of
water and a cage containing a most remarkable-appearing bird.</p>

<p>I call the thing a bird because it had wings; but to what family
it belonged, your guess is as good as mine. It had four legs and
the scales of a fish, but its beak and comb gave its strange face a
bird-like appearance.</p>

<p>The food in the bowl set before me was a mixture of vegetables,
fruit, and meat. I imagine that it was very nutritious, and it was
quite palatable.</p>

<p>As I quenched my thirst from the jar and sampled the food that
had been brought me, I watched my companion. For a moment or two he
played with the bird in the cage. He inserted a finger between the
bars, whereat the creature flapped its wings, voiced a shrill
scream, and tried to seize the finger with its beak. It never quite
succeeded, however, as my cell-mate always withdrew his finger in
time. He seemed to derive a great deal of pleasure from this, as he
purred constantly.</p>

<p>Finally he opened the door in the cage and liberated the
captive. Immediately the creature fluttered about the room, seeking
to escape through the windows; but the bars were too close
together. Then my companion commenced to stalk it, for all the
world like a cat stalking its prey. When the thing alighted, he
would creep stealthily upon it; and when he was close enough,
pounce for it.</p>

<p>For some time it succeeded in eluding him; but finally he struck
it down heavily to the floor, partially stunning it. After this he
played with it, pawing it around. Occasionally he would leave it
and move about the room pretending that he did not see it.
Presently he would seem to discover it anew, and then he would rush
for it and pounce upon it.</p>

<p>At last, with a hideous coughing roar that sounded like the roar
of a lion, he leaped ferociously upon it and severed its head with
a single bite of his powerful jaws. Immediately he transferred the
neck to his upper mouth and sucked the blood from the carcass. It
was not a pretty sight.</p>

<p>When the blood had been drained, he devoured his prey with his
lower jaws; and as he tore at it he growled like a feeding
lion.</p>

<p>I finished my own meal slowly, while across the room from me my
cell-mate tore at the carcass of his kill, swallowing in great
gulps until he devoured every last vestige of it.</p>

<p>His meal completed, he crossed to the bench and drained his
water jar, drinking through his upper mouth.</p>

<p>He paid no attention to me during all these proceedings; and
now, purring lazily, he walked over to the pile of skins and cloths
upon the floor and lying down upon them curled up and went to
sleep.</p>

<h2><a name="chap18" id="chap18">XVIII. &mdash; CONDEMNED TO
DEATH</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Youth adapts itself easily to new conditions and
learns quickly; and, though only my Creator knows how old I am, I
still retain the characteristics of youth. Aided by this fact, as
well as by a sincere desire to avail myself of every means of
self-preservation, I learned the language of my companion quickly
and easily.</p>

<p>The monotony of the days that followed my capture was thus
broken, and time did not hang so heavily upon my hands as it would
otherwise.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the elation that I felt when I realized
that my cell-mate and myself were at last able to communicate our
thoughts to one another, but even before that time arrived we had
learned one another's name. His was Umka.</p>

<p>The very first day that I discovered that I could express myself
well enough for him to understand me, I asked him who it was that
held us prisoners.</p>

<p>"The Tarids," he replied.</p>

<p>"What are they?" I asked. "What do they look like? Why do we
never see them?"</p>

<p>"I do see them," he replied. "Don't you?"</p>

<p>"No; what do they look like?"</p>

<p>"They look very much like you," he replied; "at least they are
the same sort of creature. They have two eyes and a nose and only
one mouth, and their ears are big things stuck on the sides of
their heads like yours. They are not beautiful like we
Masenas."</p>

<p>"But why do I not see them?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"You don't know how," he replied. "If you knew how, you could
see them as plainly as I do."</p>

<p>"I should like very much to see them," I told him. "Can you tell
me how I may do so?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you," he said, "but that does not mean that you will
be able to see them. Whether you do or not will depend upon your
own mental ability. The reason you do not see them is because by
the power of their own minds they have willed that you shall not
see them. If you can free your mind of this inhibition, you can see
them as plainly as you see me."</p>

<p>"But I don't know just how to go about it."</p>

<p>"You must direct your mind upon theirs in an effort to overcome
their wish by a wish of your own. They wish that you should not see
them. You must wish that you should see them. They were easily
successful with you, because, not expecting such a thing, your mind
had set up no defense mechanism against it. Now you have the
advantage upon your side, because they have willed an unnatural
condition, whereas you will have nature's forces behind you,
against which, if your mind is sufficiently powerful, they can
erect no adequate mental barrier."</p>

<p>Well, it sounded simple enough; but I am no hypnotist, and
naturally I had considerable doubt as to my ability along these
lines.</p>

<p>When I explained this to Umka, he growled impatiently.</p>

<p>"You can never succeed," he said, "if you harbor such doubts.
Put them aside. Believe that you will succeed, and you will have a
very much greater chance for success."</p>

<p>"But how can I hope to accomplish anything when I cannot see
them?" I asked. "And even if I could see them, aside from a brief
moment that the door is open when food is brought us, I have no
opportunity to see them."</p>

<p>"That is not necessary," he replied. "You think of your friends,
do you not, although you cannot see them now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, I think of them; but what has that to do with
it?"</p>

<p>"It merely shows that your thoughts can travel anywhere. Direct
your thoughts, therefore, upon these Tarids. You know that the
castle is full of them, because I have told you so. Just direct
your mind upon the minds of all the inhabitants of the castle, and
your thoughts will reach them all even though they may not be
cognizant of it."</p>

<p>"Well, here goes," I said; "wish me luck."</p>

<p>"It may take some time," he explained. "It was a long time after
I learned the secret before I could pierce their invisibility."</p>

<p>I set my mind at once upon the task before me, and kept it there
when it was not otherwise occupied; but Umka was a loquacious
creature; and having long been denied an opportunity for speech, he
was now making up for lost time.</p>

<p>He asked me many questions about myself and the land from which
I came, and seemed surprised to think that there were living
creatures upon the great world that he saw floating in the night
sky.</p>

<p>He told me that his people, the Masenas, lived in the forest in
houses built high among the trees. They were not a numerous people,
and so they sought districts far from the other inhabitants of
Thuria.</p>

<p>The Tarids, he said, had once been a powerful people; but they
had been overcome in war by another nation and almost
exterminated.</p>

<p>Their enemies still hunted them down, and there would long since
have been none of them left had not one of their wisest men
developed among them the hypnotic power which made it possible for
them to seemingly render themselves invisible to their enemies.</p>

<p>"All that remain of the Tarids," said Umka, "live here in this
castle. There are about a thousand of them altogether, men, women,
and children.</p>

<p>"Hiding here, in this remote part of the world, in an effort to
escape their enemies, they feel that all other creatures are their
foes. Whoever comes to the castle of the Tarids is an enemy to be
destroyed."</p>

<p>"They will destroy us, you think?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied.</p>

<p>"But when, and how?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"They are governed by some strange belief," explained Umka; "I
do not understand it, but every important act in their lives is
regulated by it. They say that they are guided by the sun and the
moon and the stars.</p>

<p>"It is all very foolish, but they will not kill us until the sun
tells them to, and then they will not kill us for their own
pleasure but because they believe that it will make the sun
happy."</p>

<p>"You think, then, that my friends, who are also prisoners here,
are still alive and safe?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I think so," he replied. "The fact that you
are alive indicates that they have not sacrificed the others, for I
know it is usually their custom to save their captives and destroy
them all in a single ceremony."</p>

<p>"Will they destroy you at the same time?"</p>

<p>"I think they will."</p>

<p>"And you are resigned to your fate, or would you escape if you
could?"</p>

<p>"I should certainly escape, if I had the chance," he replied;
"but I shall not have the chance; neither will you."</p>

<p>"If I could only see these people and talk to them," I said, "I
might find the way whereby we could escape. I might even convince
them that I and my friends are not their enemies, and persuade them
to treat us as friends. But what can I do? I cannot see them; and
even if I could see them, I could not hear them. The obstacles seem
insuperable."</p>

<p>"If you can succeed in overcoming the suggestion of their
invisibility which they have implanted in your mind," said Umka,
"you can also overcome the other suggestion which renders them
inaudible to you. Have you been making any efforts along these
lines?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I am almost constantly endeavoring to throw off the
hypnotic spell."</p>

<p>Each day, near noon, our single meal was served to us. It was
always the same. We each received a large jar of water, I a bowl of
food, and Umka a cage containing one of the strange bird-like
animals which apparently formed his sole diet.</p>

<p>After Umka had explained how I might overcome the hypnotic spell
that had been placed upon me and thus be able to see and hear my
captors, I had daily placed myself in a position where, when the
door was opened to permit our food to be placed within the room, I
could see out and discover if the Tarid who brought our food to us
was visible to me.</p>

<p>It was always with a disheartening sense of frustration that I
saw the receptacles containing the food and water placed upon the
floor just inside the door by invisible hands.</p>

<p>Hopeless as my efforts seemed, I still persisted in them, hoping
stubbornly against hope.</p>

<p>I was sitting one day thinking of the hopelessness of Dejah
Thoris's situation, when I heard the sound of footsteps in the
corridor beyond our door and the scraping of metal against metal,
such as the metal of a warrior makes when it scrapes against the
buckles of his harness and against his other weapons.</p>

<p>These were the first sounds that I had heard, other than those
made by Umka and myself&mdash;the first signs of life within the
great castle of the Tarids since I had been made a captive there.
The inferences to be drawn from these sounds were so momentous that
I scarcely breathed as I waited for the door to open.</p>

<p>I was standing where I could look directly out into the corridor
when the door was opened.</p>

<p>I heard the lock click. Slowly the door swung in upon its
hinges; and there, distinctly visible, were two men of flesh and
blood. In conformation they were quite human. Their skins were very
fair and white, and in strange contrast were their blue hair and
blue eyebrows. They wore short close-fitting skirts of heavy gold
mesh and breastplates similarly fabricated of gold. For weapons,
each wore a long sword and a dagger. Their features were strong,
their expressions stern and somewhat forbidding.</p>

<p>I noted all these things in the few moments that the door
remained open. I saw both men glance at me and at Umka, and I was
quite sure that neither of them was aware of the fact that they
were quite visible to me. Had they known it, I am sure that their
facial expressions would have betrayed the fact.</p>

<p>I was tremendously delighted to find that I had been able to
throw off the strange spell that had been cast upon me; and after
they had gone, I told Umka that I had been able to both see and
hear them.</p>

<p>He asked me to describe them; and when I had done so, he agreed
that I had told the truth.</p>

<p>"Sometimes people imagine things," he said, in explanation of
his seeming doubt as to my veracity.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *

<p>The next day, in the middle of the forenoon, I heard a
considerable commotion in the corridor and on the stairway leading
to our prison. Presently the door was opened and fully twenty-five
men filed into the room.</p>

<p>As I saw them, a plan occurred to me that I thought might
possibly give me an advantage over these people if an opportunity
to escape presented itself later on; and therefore I pretended that
I did not see them. When looking in their direction, I focused my
eyes beyond them; but to lessen the difficulty of this playacting I
sought to concentrate my attention on Umka, whom they knew to be
visible to me.</p>

<p>I regretted that I had not thought of this plan before, in time
to have explained it to Umka, for it was very possible that he
might inadvertently betray the fact that the Tarids were no longer
invisible to me.</p>

<p>Twelve of the men came close to me, just out of reach. One man
stood near the door and issued commands; the others approached
Umka, ordering him to place his hands behind his back.</p>

<p>Umka backed away and looked questioningly at me. I could see
that he was wondering if we might not make a break for liberty.</p>

<p>I tried to look as though I were unaware of the presence of the
warriors. I did not wish them to know that I could see them.
Looking blankly past them, I turned indifferently around until my
back was toward them and I faced Umka; then I winked at him.</p>

<p>I prayed to God that if he didn't know what a wink was some
miracle would enlighten him in this instance. As an added
precaution, I placed a finger against my lips, enjoining
silence.</p>

<p>Umka looked dumb, and fortunately he remained dumb.</p>

<p>"Half of you get the Masena," ordered the officer in charge of
the detachment; "the rest of you take the black-haired one. As you
can see, he does not know that we are in the room; so he may be
surprised and struggle when you touch him. Seize him firmly."</p>

<p>I guess Umka must have thought that I was again under the
influence of the hypnotic spell, for he was looking at me blankly
when the warriors surrounded and took him in hand.</p>

<p>Then twelve of them leaped upon me. I might have put up a fight,
but I saw nothing to be gained by doing so. As a matter of fact, I
was anxious to leave this room. I could accomplish nothing while I
remained in it; but once out, some whim of Fate might present an
opportunity to me; so I did not struggle much, but pretended that I
was startled when they seized me.</p>

<p>They then led us from the room and down the long series of
stairways up which I had climbed weeks before and finally into the
same great throne room through which Zanda, Jat Or, and I had been
conducted the morning of our capture. But what a different scene it
presented now that I had cast off the hypnotic spell under which I
had labored at that time.</p>

<p>No longer was the great room empty, no longer the two throne
chairs untenanted; instead the audience chamber was a mass of light
and color and humanity.</p>

<p>Men, women, and children lined the wide aisle down which Umka
and I were escorted toward the dais upon which stood the two throne
chairs. Between solid ranks of warriors, resplendent in gorgeous
trappings, our escort marched us to a little open space before the
throne.</p>

<p>Congregated there under guard, their hands bound, were Jat Or,
Zanda, Ur Jan, another whom I knew must be Gar Nal, and my beloved
princess, Dejah Thoris.</p>

<p>"My chieftain!" she exclaimed. "Fate is a little kind in that
she has permitted me to see you once again before we die."</p>

<p>"We still live," I reminded her, and she smiled as she
recognized this, my long-time challenge to whatever malign fate
might seem to threaten me.</p>

<p>Ur Jan's expression revealed his surprise when his eyes fell
upon me. "You!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I, Ur Jan."</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"One of the pleasures of the trip I am to be robbed of by our
captors," I replied.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The pleasure of killing you, Ur Jan," I replied.</p>

<p>He nodded understandingly, with a wry smile.</p>

<p>My attention was now attracted to the man on the throne. He was
demanding that we be silent.</p>

<p>He was a very fat man, with an arrogant expression; and I noted
in him those signs of age that are so seldom apparent among the red
men of Barsoom. I had also noted similar indications of age among
other members of the throng that filled the audience chamber, a
fact which indicated that these people did not enjoy the almost
perpetual youth of the Martians.</p>

<p>Occupying the throne at the man's side was a young and very
beautiful woman. She was gazing at me dreamily through the heavy
lashes of her half-closed lids. I could only assume that the
woman's attention was attracted to me because of the fact that my
skin differed in color from that of my companions as, after leaving
Zodanga, I had removed the disguising pigment.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" she whispered, languidly.</p>

<p>"What is that?" demanded the man. "What is splendid?"</p>

<p>She looked up with a start, as one awakened from a dream. "Oh!"
she exclaimed nervously; "I said that it would be splendid if you
could make them keep still; but how can you if we are invisible and
inaudible to them, unless," she shrugged, "you silence them with
the sword."</p>

<p>"You know, Ozara," demurred the man, "that we are saving them
for the Fire God&mdash;we may not kill them now."</p>

<p>The woman shrugged. "Why kill them at all?" she asked. "They
look like intelligent creatures. It might be interesting to
preserve them."</p>

<p>I turned to my companions. "Can any of you see or hear anything
that is going on in this room?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Except for ourselves, I can see no one and hear no one," said
Gar Nal, and the others answered similarly.</p>

<p>"We are all the victims of a form of hypnosis," I explained,
"which makes it impossible for us either to see or hear our
captors. By the exercise of the powers of your own minds you can
free yourselves from this condition. It is not difficult. I
succeeded in doing it. If the rest of you are also successful, our
chances of escape will be much better, if an opportunity to escape
arises. Believing that they are invisible to us, they will never be
on their guard against us. As a matter of fact, I could, this
moment, snatch a sword from the fellow at my side and kill the
Jeddak and his Jeddara upon their thrones before anyone could
prevent me."</p>

<p>"We cannot work together," said Gar Nal, "while half of us have
it in our hearts to kill the other half."</p>

<p>"Let us call a truce on our own quarrels, then," I said, "until
we have escaped from these people."</p>

<p>"That is fair," said Gar Nal.</p>

<p>"Do you agree?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied.</p>

<p>"And you, Ur Jan?" I asked.</p>

<p>"It suits me," said the assassin of Zodanga.</p>

<p>"And you?" demanded Gar Nal, looking at Jat Or.</p>

<p>"Whatever the&mdash;Vandor commands, I shall do," replied the
padwar.</p>

<p>Ur Jan bestowed a quick glance of sudden comprehension upon me.
"Ah," he exclaimed; "so you are also Vandor. Now I understand much
that I did not understand before. Did that rat of a Rapas
know?"</p>

<p>I ignored his question. "And now," I said, "let us raise our
hands and swear to abide by this truce until we have all escaped
from the Tarids and, further, that each of us will do all in his
power to save the others."</p>

<p>Gar Nal, Ur Jan, Jat Or, and I raised our hands to swear.</p>

<p>"The women, too," said Ur Jan; and then Dejah Thoris and Zanda
raised their hands, and thus we six swore to fight for one another
to the death until we should be free from these enemies.</p>

<p>It was a strange situation, for I had been commissioned to kill
Gar Nal; and Ur Jan had sworn to kill me, while I was intent upon
killing him; and Zanda, who hated them both, was but awaiting the
opportunity to destroy me when she should learn my identity.</p>

<p>"Come, come," exclaimed the fat man on the throne, irritably,
"what are they jabbering about in that strange language? We must
silence them; we did not bring them here to listen to them."</p>

<p>"Remove the spell from them," suggested the girl he had called
Ozara. "Let them see and hear us. There are only four men among
them; they cannot harm us."</p>

<p>"They shall see us and they shall hear us when they are led out
to die," replied the man, "and not before."</p>

<p>"I have an idea that the light-skinned man among them can see us
and hear us now," said the girl.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" demanded the man.</p>

<p>"I sense it when his eyes rest upon mine," she replied dreamily.
"Then, too, when you speak, Ul Vas, his eyes travel to your face;
and when I speak, they return to mine. He hears us, Ul Vas, and he
sees us."</p>

<p>I was indeed looking at the woman as she spoke, and now I
realized that I might have difficulty in carrying on my deception;
but this time, when the man she had called Ul Vas replied to her, I
focused my eyes beyond the girl and did not look at him.</p>

<p>"It is impossible," he said. "He can neither see nor hear us."
Then he looked down at the officer in command of the detachment
that had brought us from our cells to the audience chamber.
"Zamak," he demanded, "what do you think? Can this creature either
see or hear us?"</p>

<p>"I think not, All-highest," replied the man. "When we went to
fetch him, he asked this Masena, who was imprisoned with him, if
there were anyone in the room, although twenty-five of us were all
about him."</p>

<p>"I thought you were wrong," said Ul Vas to his jeddara; "you are
always imagining things."</p>

<p>The girl shrugged her shapely shoulders and turned away with a
bored yawn, but presently her eyes came back to me; and though I
tried not to meet them squarely thereafter, I was aware during all
the rest of the time that I was in the audience chamber that she
was watching me.</p>

<p>"Let us proceed," said Ul Vas.</p>

<p>Thereupon an old man stepped to the front and placed himself
directly before the throne. "All-highest," he intoned in a sing-
song voice, "the day is good, the occasion is good, the time has
come. We bring before you, most august son of the Fire God, seven
enemies of the Tarids. Through you, your father speaks, letting his
people know his wishes. You have talked with the Fire God, your
father. Tell us, All-highest, if these offerings look good in his
eyes; make known to us his wishes, almighty one."</p>

<p>Ever since we had come into the audience chamber, Ul Vas had
been inspecting us carefully; and especially had his attention been
centered upon Dejah Thoris and Zanda. Now he cleared his
throat.</p>

<p>"My father, the Fire God, wishes to know who these enemies are,"
he said.</p>

<p>"One of them," replied the old man who had spoken before, and
whom I took to be a priest, "is a Masena that your warriors
captured while he was hunting outside our walls. The other six are
strange creatures. We know not from whence they came. They arrived
in two unheard-of contraptions that moved through the air like
birds, though they had no wings. In each of these were two men and
a woman. They alighted inside our walls; but from whence they came
or why, we do not know, though doubtless it was their intention to
do us harm, as is the intention of all men who come to the castle
of the Tarids. As you will note, All-highest, five of these six
have red skins, while the sixth had a skin only a little darker
than our own. He seems to be of a different race, with his white
skin, his black hair, and his grey eyes. These things we know and
nothing more. We await the wishes of the Fire God from the lips of
his son, Ul Vas."</p>

<p>The man on the throne pursed his lips, as though in thought,
while his eyes traveled again along the line of prisoners facing
him, lingering long upon Dejah Thoris and Zanda. Presently, he
spoke.</p>

<p>"My father, the Fire God, demands that the Masena and the four
strange men be destroyed in his honor at this same hour, after he
has encircled Ladan seven times."</p>

<p>There were a few moments of expectant silence after he had
ceased speaking&mdash;a silence that was finally broken by the old
priest.</p>

<p>"And the women, All-highest?" he asked; "what are the wishes of
the Fire God, your father, in relation to them?"</p>

<p>"The Fire God, to show his great love," replied the jeddak, "has
presented the two women to his son, Ul Vas to do with as he
chooses."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap19" id="chap19">XIX. &mdash; OZARA</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Life is sweet; and when I heard the words of doom
fall from the lips of the jeddak, Ul Vas, the words that condemned
five of us to die on the seventh day, I must naturally have
experienced some depressing reaction; but I was not conscious of
it, in view of the far greater mental perturbation induced by the
knowledge that Dejah Thoris's fate was to be worse than death.</p>

<p>I was glad that she was mercifully deaf to what I had heard. It
could not help her to know the fate that was being reserved for
her, and it could only cause her needless anguish had she heard the
death sentence pronounced upon me.</p>

<p>All my companions, having seen nothing and heard nothing, stood
like dumb cattle before the throne of their cruel judge. To them it
was only an empty chair; for me it held a creature of flesh and
blood&mdash;a mortal whose vitals the point of a keen blade might
reach.</p>

<p>Again Ul Vas was speaking. "Remove them now," he commanded.
"Confine the men in the Turquoise Tower, and take the women to the
Tower of Diamonds."</p>

<p>I thought then to leap upon him and strangle him with my bare
hands, but my better judgment told me that that would not save
Dejah Thoris from the fate for which she was being reserved. It
could only result in my own death, and thus would be removed her
greatest, perhaps her only, hope of eventual succor; and so I went
quietly, as they led me away with my fellow-prisoners, my last
memory of the audience chamber being the veiled gaze of Ozara,
Jeddara of the Tarids.</p>

<p>Umka and I were not returned to the cell in which we had
previously been incarcerated; but were taken with Jat Or, Gar Nal,
and Ur Jan to a large room in the Turquoise Tower.</p>

<p>We did not speak until the door had closed behind the escort
that had been invisible to all but Umka and myself. The others
seemed mystified; I could read it in the puzzled expressions upon
their faces.</p>

<p>"What was it all about, Vandor?" demanded Jat Or. "Why did we
stand there in silence in that empty chamber before those vacant
thrones?"</p>

<p>"There was no silence," I replied; "and the room was crowded
with people. The Jeddak and his Jeddara sat upon the thrones that
seemed vacant to you, and the Jeddak passed the sentence of death
upon all of us&mdash;we are to die on the seventh day."</p>

<p>"And the princess and Zanda, too?" he demanded.</p>

<p>I shook my head. "No, unfortunately, no."</p>

<p>"Why do you say unfortunately?" he asked, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Because they would prefer death to what is in store for them.
The Jeddak, Ul Vas, is keeping them for himself."</p>

<p>Jat Or scowled. "We must do something," he said; "we must save
them."</p>

<p>"I know it," I replied; "but how?"</p>

<p>"You have given up hope?" he demanded. "You will go to your
death calmly, knowing what is in store for them?"</p>

<p>"You know me better than that, Jat Or," I said. "I am hoping
that something will occur that will suggest a plan of rescue;
although I see no hope at present, I am not hopeless. If no
opportunity occurs before, then in the last moment, I shall at
least avenge her, if I cannot save her; for I have an advantage
over these people that they do not know I possess."</p>

<p>"What is that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They are neither invisible nor inaudible to me," I replied.</p>

<p>He nodded. "Yes, I had forgotten," he said; "but it seemed
impossible that you could see and hear where there was nothing to
be seen nor heard."</p>

<p>"Why are they going to kill us?" demanded Gar Nal, who had
overheard my conversation with Jat Or.</p>

<p>"We are to be offered as sacrifices to the Fire God whom they
worship," I replied.</p>

<p>"The Fire God?" demanded Ur Jan. "Who is he?"</p>

<p>"The sun," I explained.</p>

<p>"But how could you understand their language?" asked Gar Nal.
"It cannot be possible that they speak the same tongue that is
spoken upon Barsoom."</p>

<p>"No," I replied, "they do not; but Umka, with whom I have been
imprisoned ever since we were captured, has taught me the language
of the Tarids."</p>

<p>"What are Tarids?" asked Jat Or.</p>

<p>"It is the name of the people in whose power we are," I
explained.</p>

<p>"What is their name for Thuria?" asked Gar Nal.</p>

<p>"I am not sure," I replied; "but I will ask Umka. Umka," I said,
in his own language, "What does the word, <i>Ladan</i>, mean?"</p>

<p>"That is the name of this world we live on," he replied. "You
heard Ul Vas say that we should die when the Fire God had encircled
Ladan seven times."</p>

<p>We Barsoomians fell into a general conversation after this, and
I had an opportunity to study Gar Nal and Ur Jan more
carefully.</p>

<p>The former was, like most Martians, of indeterminate age. He was
not of such extreme age that he commenced to show it, as did Fal
Sivas. Gar Nal might have been anywhere from a hundred to a
thousand years old. He had a high forehead and rather thin hair for
a Martian, and there was nothing peculiarly distinctive about his
features, except his eyes. I did not like them; they were crafty,
deceitful, and cruel.</p>

<p>Ur Jan, whom of course I had seen before, was just what one
might have expected&mdash;a burly, brutal fighting man of the
lowest type; but of the two, I thought then that I should have
trusted Ur Jan farther than Gar Nal.</p>

<p>It seemed strange to me to be confined here in such small
quarters with two such bitter enemies; but I realized, as they must
have also, that it would profit us nothing to carry on our quarrel
under such circumstances, whereas if an opportunity to escape
presented itself, four men who could wield swords would have a very
much better chance to effect the liberty of all than if there were
only two of us. There would not have been more than two, had we
dared to continue our quarrel; for at least two of us, and possibly
three, must have died in order to insure peace.</p>

<p>Umka seemed rather neglected as we four talked in our own
tongue. He and I had grown to be on very friendly terms, and I
counted on him to assist us if an opportunity arose whereby we
might attempt escape. I was therefore particularly anxious that he
remain friendly, and so I drew him into the conversation
occasionally, acting as interpreter for him.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *

<p>For days, day after day, I had watched Umka play with the
hapless creatures that were brought to him for his food, so that
the sight no longer affected me; but when the food was brought us
this day, the Barsoomians watched the Masena in fascinated horror;
and I could see that Gar Nal grew actually to fear the man.</p>

<p>Shortly after we had completed our meal, the door opened again
and several warriors entered. Zamak, the officer who had conducted
Umka and me to the audience chamber, was again in command.</p>

<p>Only Umka and I could see that anyone had entered the room; and
I, with difficulty, pretended that I was not conscious of the
fact.</p>

<p>"There he is," said Zamak, pointing to me; "fetch him
along."</p>

<p>The soldiers approached and seized my arms on either side; then
they hustled me toward the door.</p>

<p>"What is it?" cried Jat Or. "What has happened to you?" he
shouted. "Where are you going?" The door was still ajar, and he saw
that I was headed toward it.</p>

<p>"I do not know where I am going, Jat Or," I replied. "They are
taking me away again."</p>

<p>"My prince, my prince," he cried, and sprang after me, as though
to drag me back; but the soldiers hustled me out of the chamber,
and the door was slammed in Jat Or's face between us.</p>

<p>"It's a good thing these fellows can't see us," remarked one of
the warriors escorting me. "I think we should have had a good fight
on our hands just now, had they been able to."</p>

<p>"I think this one could put up a good fight," said one of the
fellows who was pushing me along; "the muscles in his arms are like
bands of silver."</p>

<p>"Even the best of men can't fight antagonists that are invisible
to them," remarked another.</p>

<p>"This one did pretty well in the courtyard the day that we
captured him; he bruised a lot of the Jeddak's guard with his bare
hands, and killed two of them."</p>

<p>This was the first intimation that I had had any success
whatsoever in that encounter, and it rather pleased me. I could
imagine how they would feel if they knew that I could not only see
them but hear them and understand them.</p>

<p>They were so lax, because of their fancied security, that I
could have snatched a weapon from almost any of them; and I know
that I should have given a good account of myself, but I could not
see how it would avail either me or my fellow-prisoners.</p>

<p>I was conducted to a part of the palace that was entirely
different from any portion that I had hitherto seen. It was even
more gorgeous in its lavish and luxurious decorations and
appointments than the splendid throne room.</p>

<p>Presently we came to a doorway before which several warriors
stood on guard.</p>

<p>"We have come, as was commanded," said Zamak, "and brought the
white-skinned prisoner with us."</p>

<p>"You are expected," replied one of the guardsmen; "you may
enter," and he threw open the large double doors.</p>

<p>Beyond them was an apartment of such exquisite beauty and
richness that, in my poor vocabulary, I find no words to describe
it. There were hangings in colors unknown to earthly eyes, against
a background of walls that seemed to be of solid ivory, though what
the material was of which they were composed, I did not know. It
was rather the richness and elegance of the room's appointments
that made it seem so beautiful, for after all, when I come to
describe it, I find that, in a sense, simplicity was its dominant
note.</p>

<p>There was no one else in the room when we entered. My guard led
me to the center of the floor and halted.</p>

<p>Presently a door in the opposite side of the room opened, and a
woman appeared. She was a very good-looking young woman. Later I
was to learn that she was a slave.</p>

<p>"You will wait in the corridor, Zamak," she said; "the prisoner
will follow me."</p>

<p>"What, alone, without a guard?" demanded Zamak in surprise.</p>

<p>"Such are my commands," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"But how can he follow you," asked Zamak, "when he can neither
see nor hear us; and if he could hear us, he could not understand
us?"</p>

<p>"I will lead him," she replied.</p>

<p>As she approached me, the soldiers relinquished their grasp upon
my arms; and taking one of my hands, she led me from the
apartment.</p>

<p>The room into which I was now conducted, though slightly
smaller, was far more beautiful than the other. However, I did not
immediately take note of its appointments, my attention being
immediately and wholly attracted by its single occupant.</p>

<p>I am not easily surprised; but in this instance I must confess
that I was when I recognized the woman reclining upon a divan, and
watching me intently through long lashes, as Ozara, Jeddara of the
Tarids.</p>

<p>The slave girl led me to the center of the room and halted.
There she waited, looking questioningly at the Jeddara; while I,
recalling that I was supposed to be deaf and blind to these people,
sought to focus my gaze beyond the beautiful empress whose veiled
eyes seemed to read my very soul.</p>

<p>"You may retire, Ulah," she said presently.</p>

<p>The slave girl bowed low and backed from the room.</p>

<p>For several moments after she departed, no sound broke the
silence of the room; but always I felt the eyes of Ozara upon
me.</p>

<p>Presently she laughed, a silvery musical laugh. "What is your
name?" she demanded.</p>

<p>I pretended that I did not hear her, as I found occupation for
my eyes in examination of the beauties of the chamber. It appeared
to be the boudoir of the empress, and it made a lovely setting for
her unquestionable loveliness.</p>

<p>"Listen," she said, presently; "you fooled Ul Vas and Zamak and
the High Priest and all the rest of them; but you did not fool me.
I will admit that you have splendid control, but your eyes betrayed
you. They betrayed you in the audience chamber; and they betrayed
you again just now as you entered this room, just as I knew they
would betray you. They showed surprise when they rested upon me,
and that can mean only one thing; that you saw and recognized
me.</p>

<p>"I knew, too, in the audience chamber, that you understood what
was being said. You are a highly intelligent creature, and the
changing lights in your eyes reflected your reaction to what you
heard in the audience chamber.</p>

<p>"Let us be honest with one another, you and I, for we have more
in common than you guess. I am not unfriendly to you. I understand
why you think it to your advantage to conceal the fact that you can
see and hear us; but I can assure you that you will be no worse off
if you trust me, for I already know that we are neither invisible
nor inaudible to you."</p>

<p>I could not fathom what she meant by saying we had much in
common, unless it were merely a ruse to lure me into an admission
that I could both see and hear the Tarids; yet on the other hand, I
could see no reason to believe that either she or the others would
profit by this knowledge. I was absolutely in their power, and
apparently it made little difference whether I could see and hear
them or not. Furthermore, I was convinced that this girl was
extremely clever and that I could not deceive her into believing
that she was invisible to me. On the whole, I saw no reason to
attempt to carry the deception further with her; and so I looked
her squarely in the eyes and smiled.</p>

<p>"I shall be honored by the friendship of the Jeddara, Ozara," I
said.</p>

<p>"There!" she exclaimed; "I knew that I was right."</p>

<p>"Yet perhaps you had a little doubt."</p>

<p>"If I did, it is because you are a past master in the art of
deception."</p>

<p>"I felt that the lives and liberty of my companions and myself
might depend upon my ability to keep your people from knowing that
I can see and understand them."</p>

<p>"You do not speak our language very well," she said. "How did
you learn it?"</p>

<p>"The Masena with whom I was imprisoned taught me it," I
explained.</p>

<p>"Tell me about yourself," she demanded; "your name, your
country, the strange contrivances in which you came to the last
stronghold of the Tarids, and your reason for coming."</p>

<p>"I am John Carter," I replied, "Prince of the house of Tardos
Mors, Jeddak of Helium."</p>

<p>"Helium?" she questioned. "Where is Helium? I never heard of
it."</p>

<p>"It is on another world," I explained, "on Barsoom, the great
planet that you call your larger moon."</p>

<p>"You are, then, a prince in your own country?" she said. "I
thought as much. I am seldom mistaken in my estimate of people. The
two women and one of the other men among your companions are
well-bred," she continued; "the other two men are not. One of them,
however, has a brilliant mind, while the other is a stupid lout, a
low brute of a man."</p>

<p>I could not but smile at her accurate appraisal of my
companions. Here, indeed, was a brilliant woman. If she really
cared to befriend me, I felt that she might accomplish much for us;
but I did not allow my hopes to rise too high, for after all she
was the mate of Ul Vas, the Jeddak who had condemned us to
death.</p>

<p>"You have read them accurately, Jeddara," I told her.</p>

<p>"And you," she continued; "you are a great man in your own
world. You would be a great man in any world; but you have not told
me why you came to our country."</p>

<p>"The two men that you last described abducted a princess of the
reigning house of my country."</p>

<p>"She must be the very beautiful one," mused Ozara.</p>

<p>"Yes," I said. "With the other man and the girl, I pursued them
in another ship. Shortly after we reached Ladan, we saw their ship
in the courtyard of your castle. We landed beside it to rescue the
princess and punish her abductors. It was then that your people
captured us."</p>

<p>"Then you did not come to harm us?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," I replied. "We did not even know of your
existence."</p>

<p>She nodded. "I was quite sure that you intended us no harm," she
said, "for enemies would never have placed themselves thus
absolutely in our power; but I could not convince Ul Vas and the
others."</p>

<p>"I appreciate your belief in me," I said; "but I cannot
understand why you have taken this interest in me, an alien and a
stranger."</p>

<p>She contemplated me in silence for a moment, her beautiful eyes
momentarily dreamy.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is because we have so much in common," she said;
"and again perhaps because of a force that is greater than all
others and that seizes and dominates us without our volition."</p>

<p>She paused and regarded me intently, and then she shook her head
impatiently.</p>

<p>"The thing that we have in common," she said, "is that we are
both prisoners in the castle of Ul Vas. The reason that I have
taken this interest in you, you would understand if you are one-
tenth as intelligent as I gave you credit for."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap20" id="chap20">XX. &mdash; WE ATTEMPT ESCAPE</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Ozara may have overestimated my intelligence, but
she underestimated my caution. I could not admit that I understood
the inference that I was supposed to draw from what she had said to
me. As a matter of fact, the implication was so preposterous that
at first I was inclined to believe that it was a ruse intended to
trap me into some sort of an admission of ulterior designs upon her
people, after she had wholly won my confidence; and so I sought to
ignore the possible confession in her final statement by appearing
to be dumbfounded by her first statement, which really was a
surprise to me.</p>

<p>"You, a prisoner?" I demanded. "I thought that you were the
Jeddara of the Tarids."</p>

<p>"I am," she said, "but I am no less a prisoner."</p>

<p>"But are not these your people?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No," she replied; "I am a Domnian. My country, Domnia, lies far
away across the mountains that lie beyond the forest that surrounds
the castle of Ul Vas."</p>

<p>"And your people married you to Ul Vas, Jeddak of the Tarids?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"No," she replied; "he stole me from them. My people do not know
what has become of me. They would never willingly have sent me to
the court of Ul Vas, nor would I remain here, could I escape. Ul
Vas is a beast. He changes his jeddaras often. His agents are
constantly searching other countries for beautiful young women.
When they find one more beautiful than I, I shall go the way of my
predecessors; but I think that he has found one to his liking
already, and that my days are numbered."</p>

<p>"You think that his agents have found another more beautiful
than you?" I asked; "it seems incredible."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the compliment," she said "but his agents have
not found another more beautiful than I. Ul Vas has found her
himself. In the audience chamber, did you not see him looking at
your beautiful compatriot? He could scarcely keep his eyes from
her, and you will recall that her life was spared."</p>

<p>"So was the life of the girl, Zanda," I reminded her. "Is he
going to take her also to be his jeddara?"</p>

<p>"No, he may only have one at a time," replied Ozara. "The girl
whom you call Zanda is for the High Priest. It is thus that Ul Vas
propitiates the gods."</p>

<p>"If he takes this other woman," I said, "she will kill him."</p>

<p>"But that will not help me," said Ozara.</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Because while one jeddara lives, he cannot take another," she
explained.</p>

<p>"You will be destroyed?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I shall disappear," she replied. "Strange things happen in the
castle of Ul Vas, strange and terrible things."</p>

<p>"I commence to understand why you sent for me," I said; "you
would like to escape; and you think if you can help us to escape,
we will take you with us."</p>

<p>"You are commencing to understand at least a part of my
reasons," she said. "The rest," she added, "I shall see that you
learn in time."</p>

<p>"You think there is a chance for us to escape?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Just a bare chance," she said; "but inasmuch as we are to die
anyway, there is no chance that we may not take."</p>

<p>"Have you any plans?"</p>

<p>"We might escape in the ship, the one that is still in the
courtyard."</p>

<p>Now I was interested. "One of the ships is still in the
courtyard?" I demanded. "Only one? They have not destroyed it?"</p>

<p>"They would have destroyed it, but they are afraid of it; they
are afraid to go near it. When you were captured, two of Ul Vas's
warriors entered one of the ships, whereupon it immediately flew
away with them. It did not fly away before the first one who had
entered it had called back to his companion that it was deserted.
Now they think that these ships are under a magic spell, and they
will not go near the one that lies in the courtyard."</p>

<p>"Do you know what became of the other ship?" I asked. "Do you
know where it went?"</p>

<p>"It lies in the sky, far above the castle. It just floats there,
as though it were waiting&mdash;waiting for something, we know not
what. Ul Vas is afraid of it. That is one reason why you have not
been destroyed before. He was waiting to see what the ship would
do; and he was also waiting to screw up his courage to a point
where he might order your destruction, for Ul Vas is a great
coward."</p>

<p>"Then you think that there is a chance of our reaching the
ship?" I asked.</p>

<p>"There is a chance," she said. "I can hide you here in my
apartment until nightfall, and the castle sleeps. Then if we can
pass the guard at the outer doorway and reach the courtyard, we
should succeed. It is worth trying, but you may have to fight your
way past the guard. Are you skilled with the sword?"</p>

<p>"I think that I can give a good account of myself," I replied,
"but how are we to get the rest of my party into the
courtyard?"</p>

<p>"Only you and I are going," she said.</p>

<p>I shook my head. "I cannot go unless all my people go with
me."</p>

<p>She eyed me with sudden suspicion. "Why not?" she demanded. "You
are in love with one of those women; you will not go without her."
Her tone was tinged with resentment; it was the speech of a jealous
woman.</p>

<p>If I were to effect the escape of the others, and especially of
Dejah Thoris, I must not let her know the truth; so I thought
quickly, and two good reasons occurred to me why she and I could
not depart alone.</p>

<p>"It is a point of honor in the country from which I come," I
told her, "that a man never deserts his comrades. For that reason,
I could not, in honor, leave without them; but there is another
even more potent reason."</p>

<p>"What is that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"The ship that remains in the courtyard belongs to my enemies,
the two men who abducted the princess from my country. My ship is
the one that floats above the castle. I know nothing at all about
the mechanism of their ship. Even if we succeeded in reaching it I
could not operate it."</p>

<p>She studied this problem for a while, and then she looked up at
me. "I wonder if you are telling me the truth," she said.</p>

<p>"Your life depends upon your believing me," I replied, "and so
does mine, and so do the lives of all my companions."</p>

<p>She considered this in silence for a moment, and then with a
gesture of impatience she said, "I do not know how we can get your
friends out into the courtyard and to the ship."</p>

<p>"I think I know how we may escape," I said, "if you will help
us."</p>

<p>"How is that?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"If you can get me tools with which we can cut the bars to the
windows of their prison cells, and also describe exactly the
location of the room in which the girls are imprisoned, I am sure
that I can be successful."</p>

<p>"If I did these things, then you could escape without me," she
said suspiciously.</p>

<p>"I give you my word, Ozara, that if you do as I ask, I shall not
leave without you."</p>

<p>"What else do you want me to do?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Can you gain entrance to the room where the princess and Zanda
are imprisoned?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think that I can do that," she replied, "unless Ul Vas
should realize that I suspected his intention and might think that
I intended to kill the women; but I am not so sure that I can get
the tools with which you may cut the bars to the windows of your
prison. I can get them," she corrected herself, "but I do not know
how I can get them to you."</p>

<p>"If you could send some food to me, you might conceal a file or
saw in the jar with the food," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Just the thing!" she exclaimed; "I can send Ulah to you with a
jar of food."</p>

<p>"And how about the bars on the windows of the girls' prison?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"They are in the Diamond Tower," she replied, "very high. There
are no bars on their windows because no one could escape from the
Diamond Tower in that way. There are always guards at its base, for
it is the tower in which are the Jeddak's quarters; so if you are
planning on your women escaping through a window, you might as well
abandon the idea at once."</p>

<p>"I think not," I replied. "If my plan works, they can escape
with even greater ease from the Diamond Tower than from the
courtyard."</p>

<p>"But how about you and the other men of your party? Even if you
are able to lower yourselves from the window of your cell, you will
never be able to reach the Diamond Tower to insure our escape."</p>

<p>"Leave that to me," I said; "have confidence in me, and I think
that if you do your part, we shall all be able to escape."</p>

<p>"Tonight?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, I think not," I said; "we had better wait until tomorrow
night, for we do not know how long it will take to sever the bars
of our window. Perhaps you had better send me back now and smuggle
the tools to me as soon thereafter as possible."</p>

<p>She nodded. "You are right."</p>

<p>"Just a moment," I said. "How am I to know the Tower of
Diamonds? How am I to find it?"</p>

<p>She appeared puzzled. "It is the central and loftiest tower of
the castle," she explained, "but I do not know how you will reach
it without a guide and many fighting men."</p>

<p>"Leave that to me, but you must help guide me to the room where
the two women are imprisoned."</p>

<p>"How can I do that?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"When you reach their room, hang a colored scarf from a window
there&mdash;a red scarf."</p>

<p>"How can you see that from inside the castle?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Never mind; if my plan works, I shall find it. And now, please
send me away."</p>

<p>She struck a gong hanging near her and the slave girl, Ulah,
entered the apartment. "Take the prisoner back to Zamak," she
instructed, "and have him returned to his cell."</p>

<p>Ulah took me by the hand and led me from the presence of the
Jeddara, through the adjoining apartment and into the corridor
beyond, where Zamak and the guards were waiting. There she turned
me over to the warriors who conducted me back to the room in the
Turquoise Tower, where my companions were imprisoned.</p>

<p>Jat Or voiced an exclamation of relief when he saw me enter the
room. "When they took you away, my prince, I thought that I should
never see you again; but now fate is growing kinder to me. She has
just given me two proofs of her returning favor&mdash;I have you
back again, and when the door opened I saw the Tarids who returned
with you."</p>

<p>"You could see them?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I could see them and hear them," he replied.</p>

<p>"And I, too," said Gar Nal.</p>

<p>"How about you, Ur Jan?" I asked, for the more of us who could
see them, the better chance we would have in the event that there
was any fighting during our attempt to rescue the women and
escape.</p>

<p>Ur Jan shook his head gloomily. "I could see nothing or hear
nothing," he said.</p>

<p>"Don't give up," I urged; "you <i>must</i> see them. Persevere,
and you shall see them."</p>

<p>"Now," I said, turning to Gar Nal, "I have some good news. Our
ships are safe; yours still lies in the courtyard. They are afraid
to approach it."</p>

<p>"And yours?" he asked.</p>

<p>"It floats in the sky, high above the castle."</p>

<p>"You brought others with you from Barsoom?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No," I replied.</p>

<p>"But there must be somebody aboard the ship, or it could not get
up there and remain under control."</p>

<p>"There is someone aboard it," I replied.</p>

<p>He looked puzzled. "But you just said that you brought no one
with you," he challenged.</p>

<p>"There are two Tarid warriors aboard it."</p>

<p>"But how can they handle it? What can they know about the
intricate mechanism of Fal Sivas's craft?"</p>

<p>"They know nothing about it and cannot handle it."</p>

<p>"Then how in the name of Issus did it get up there?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"That is something that you need not know, Gar Nal," I told him.
"The fact is, that it is there."</p>

<p>"But what good will it do us, hanging up there in the sky?"</p>

<p>"I think that I can get it, when the time comes," I said,
although, as a matter of fact, I was not positive that I could
control the ship through the mechanical brain at so great a
distance. "I am not so much worried about my ship, Gar Nal, as I am
about yours. We should recover it, for after we escape from this
castle, our truce is off; and it would not be well for us to travel
on the same ship."</p>

<p>He acquiesced with a nod, but I saw his eyes narrow craftily. I
wondered if that expression reflected some treacherous thought; but
I passed the idea off with a mental shrug, as really it did not
make much difference what Gar Nal was thinking as long as I could
keep my eyes on him until I had Dejah Thoris safely aboard my own
craft.</p>

<p>Ur Jan was sitting on a bench, glaring into space; and I knew
that he was concentrating his stupid brain in an effort to cast off
the hypnotic spell under which the Tarids had placed him. Umka lay
curled up on a rug, purring contentedly. Jat Or stood looking out
of one of the windows.</p>

<p>The door opened, and we all turned toward it. I saw Ulah, the
Jeddara's slave, bearing a large earthen jar of food. She set it
down upon the floor inside the door, and stepping back into the
corridor, closed and fastened the door after her.</p>

<p>I walked quickly to the jar and picked it up; and as I turned
back toward the others, I saw Ur Jan standing wide-eyed staring at
the door.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Ur Jan?" I asked. "You look as though you
had seen a ghost."</p>

<p>"I saw her!" he exclaimed. "I saw her. Ghost or no ghost, I saw
her."</p>

<p>"Good!" ejaculated Jat Or; "now we are all free from that
damnable spell."</p>

<p>"Give me a good sword," growled Ur Jan; "and we'll soon be free
of the castle, too."</p>

<p>"We've got to get out of this room first," Gar Nal reminded
him.</p>

<p>"I think we have the means of escape here, in this jar," I told
them. "Come, we might as well eat the food, as long as we have it,
and see what we find in the bottom of the jar."</p>

<p>The others gathered around me, and we started to empty the jar
in the most pleasurable fashion; nor had we gone deep into it
before I discovered three files, and with these we immediately set
to work upon the bars of one of our windows.</p>

<p>"Don't cut them all the way through," I cautioned; "just weaken
three of them so that we can pull them aside when the time
arrives."</p>

<p>The metal of which the bars were constructed was either some
element unknown upon Earth or Barsoom or an equally mysterious
alloy. It was very hard. In fact, it seemed at first that it was
almost as hard as our files; but at last they commenced to bite
into it, yet I saw that it was going to be a long, hard job.</p>

<p>We worked upon those bars all that night and all of the
following day.</p>

<p>When slaves brought our food, two of us stood looking out of the
window, our hands grasping the bars so as to cover up the evidence
of our labors; and thus we succeeded in finishing the undertaking
without being apprehended.</p>

<p>Night fell. The time was approaching when I might put to trial
the one phase of my plan that was the keystone upon which the
success of the entire adventure must rest. If it failed, all our
work upon the bars would be set for naught, our hopes of escape
practically blasted. I had not let the others know what I purposed
attempting, and I did not now acquaint them with the doubts and
fears that assailed me.</p>

<p>Ur Jan was at the window looking out. "We can pull these bars
away whenever we wish," he said, "but I do not see what good that
is going to do us. If we fastened all our harnesses together, they
would not reach to the castle roof below us. It looks to me as
though we have had all our work for nothing."</p>

<p>"Go over there and sit down," I told him, "and keep still. All
of you keep still; do not speak or move until I tell you to."</p>

<p>Of them all, only Jat Or could have guessed what I purposed
attempting, yet they all did as I had bid them.</p>

<p>Going to the window, I searched the sky; but I could see nothing
of our craft. Nevertheless, I sought to concentrate my thoughts
upon the metallic brain wherever it might be. I directed it to drop
down and approach the window of the tower where I stood. Never
before in my life, I think, had I so concentrated my mind upon a
single idea. There seemed to be a reaction that I could feel almost
as definitely as when I tensed a muscle. Beads of cold sweat stood
out upon my forehead.</p>

<p>Behind me the room was as silent as the grave; and through the
open window where I stood, no sound came from the sleeping castle
below me.</p>

<p>The slow seconds passed, dragging into a seeming eternity of
time. Could it be that the brain had passed beyond the sphere of my
control? Was the ship lost to me forever? These thoughts assailed
me as my power of concentration weakened. My mind was swept into a
mad riot of conflicting hopes and doubts, fears and sudden swift
assurances of success that faded into despond as rapidly as they
had grown out of nothing.</p>

<p>And then, across the sky I saw a great black hulk moving slowly
toward me out of the night.</p>

<p>For just an instant the reaction left me weak; but I soon
regained control of myself and pulled aside the three bars that we
had cut.</p>

<p>The others, who had evidently been watching the window from
where they either sat or stood, now pressed forward. I could hear
smothered exclamations of surprise, relief, elation. Turning
quickly, I cautioned them to silence.</p>

<p>I directed the brain to bring the ship close to the window; then
I turned again to my companions.</p>

<p>"There are two Tarid warriors aboard her," I said. "If they
found the water and food which she carried, they are still alive;
and there is no reason to believe that starving men would not find
it. We must therefore prepare ourselves for a fight. Each of these
men, no doubt, is armed with a long sword and a dagger. We are
unarmed. We shall have to overcome them with our bare hands."</p>

<p>I turned to Ur Jan. "When the door is opened, two of us must
leap into the cabin simultaneously on the chance that we may take
them by surprise. Will you go first with me, Ur Jan?"</p>

<p>He nodded and a crooked smile twisted his lips. "Yes," he said,
"and it will be a strange sight to see Ur Jan and John Carter
fighting side by side."</p>

<p>"At least we should put up a good fight," I said.</p>

<p>"It is too bad," he sighed, "that those two Tarids will never
have the honor of knowing who killed them."</p>

<p>"Jat Or, you and Gar Nal follow immediately behind Ur Jan and
me." And then, in his own language, I told Umka to board the ship
immediately after Jat Or and Gar Nal. "And if the fighting is not
all over," I told him, "you will know what to do when you see the
two Tarid warriors." His upper mouth stretched in one of his
strange grins, and he purred contentedly.</p>

<p>I stepped to the sill of the window, and Ur Jan clambered to my
side. The hull of the craft was almost scraping the side of the
building; the doorway was only a foot from the sill on which we
stood.</p>

<p>"Ready, Ur Jan," I whispered, and then I directed the brain to
draw the doors aside as rapidly as possible.</p>

<p>Almost instantly, they sprang apart; and in the same instant Ur
Jan and I sprang into the cabin. Behind us, came our three
companions. In the gloom of the interior, I saw two men facing us;
and without waiting to give either of them a chance to draw, I
hurled myself at the legs of the nearer.</p>

<p>He crashed to the floor, and before he could draw his dagger I
seized both his wrists and pinioned him on his back.</p>

<p>I did not see how Ur Jan handled his man; but a moment later,
with the assistance of Jat Or and Umka, we had disarmed them
both.</p>

<p>Ur Jan and Gar Nal wanted to kill them offhand, but that I would
not listen to. I can kill a man in a fair fight without a single
qualm of conscience; but I cannot kill a defenseless man in cold
blood, even though he be my enemy.</p>

<p>As a precautionary measure, we bound and gagged them.</p>

<p>"What now?" demanded Gar Nal. "How are you going to get the
women?"</p>

<p>"First, I am going to try and get your ship," I replied, "for
even if we extend our truce, we shall stand a better chance of
returning to Barsoom if we have both ships in our possession, as
something might happen to one of them."</p>

<p>"You are right," he said; "and, too, I should hate to lose my
ship. It is the fruit of a lifetime of thought and study and
labor."</p>

<p>I now caused the ship to rise and cruise away until I thought
that it was out of sight of the castle. I adopted this course
merely as a strategy to throw the Tarids off our track in the event
that any of the guards had seen the ship maneuvering among the
towers; but when we had gone some little distance, I dropped low
and approached the castle again from the side where Gar Nal's ship
lay in the courtyard.</p>

<p>I kept very low above the trees of the forest and moved very
slowly without lights. Just beyond the castle wall, I brought the
ship to a stop and surveyed the courtyard just ahead and below
us.</p>

<p>Plainly I saw the outlines of Gar Nal's ship, but nowhere upon
that side of the castle was there any sign of a guard.</p>

<p>This seemed almost too good to be true, and in a whisper I asked
Umka if it could be possible that the castle was unguarded at
night.</p>

<p>"There are guards within the castle all night," he said, "and
upon the outside of the Tower of Diamonds, but these are to guard
Ul Vas against assassination by his own people. They do not fear
that any enemy will come from beyond the walls at night, for none
has ever attacked except by day. The forests of Ladan are full of
wild beasts; and if a body of men were to enter them at night, the
beasts would set up such a din of howling and roaring that the
Tarids would be warned in ample time to defend themselves; so you
see, the beasts of the forest are all the guards they need."</p>

<p>Thus assured that there was no one in the courtyard, I took the
ship across the wall and dropped it to the ground beside Gar
Nal's.</p>

<p>Quickly I gave my instructions for what was to follow. "Gar
Nal," I said, "you will go aboard your ship and pilot it, following
me. We are going to the window of the room where the girls are
confined. As I draw in and stop at their window, both the doors in
the sides of my ship will be open. Open the door on the port side
of your ship and place it alongside mine, so that if it is
necessary you can cross through my ship and enter the room where
the women are confined. We may need all the help that we have, if
the women are well guarded."</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap21" id="chap21">XXI. &mdash; IN THE TOWER OF
DIAMONDS</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Vague misgivings disturbed me as I saw Gar Nal
enter his ship. They seemed a premonition of disaster, of tragedy;
but I realized that they were based upon nothing more substantial
than my natural dislike for the man, and so I sought to thrust them
aside and devote my thoughts to the business in hand.</p>

<p>The night was dark. Neither Mars nor Cluros had risen. It was,
indeed, because of the fact that I knew neither of them would be in
the sky that I had chosen this hour for my attempt to rescue Dejah
Thoris and her companion.</p>

<p>Presently I heard the motors of Gar Nal's ship, which we had
decided should be the signal that he was ready to start. Leaving
the ground, I rose from the courtyard, crossed the wall and set a
course away from the city. This I held until I felt that we were
out of sight of any possible watcher who might have discovered us.
Trailing us was the dark hulk of Gar Nal's ship.</p>

<p>In a wide spiral, I rose and circled back to the opposite side
of the castle; and then, approaching it more closely, I picked out
the lofty Tower of Diamonds.</p>

<p>Somewhere in that gleaming shaft were Dejah Thoris and Zanda;
and if Ozara had not betrayed me and if no accident had befallen
her plan, the Jeddara of the Tarids was with them.</p>

<p>There had been moments when I had been somewhat concerned as to
the honesty and loyalty of Ozara. If she had spoken the truth, then
there was every reason why she should wish to escape from the
clutches of Ul Vas. However, she might not be so enthusiastic about
the escape of Dejah Thoris and Zanda.</p>

<p>I confess that I do not understand women. Some of the things
that they do, their mental processes, are often inexplicable to me.
Yes, I am a fool with women; yet I was not so stupid that I did not
sense something in Ozara's manner toward me, something in the very
fact that she had sent for me, that indicated an interest on the
part of the Jeddara of the Tarids that might prove inimical to the
interests of the Princess of Helium.</p>

<p>Ozara, Jeddara of the Tarids, however, was not the only doubtful
factor in the problem which confronted me. I did not trust Gar Nal.
I doubt that anyone who had once looked into the man's eyes could
trust him. Ur Jan was my avowed enemy. His every interest demanded
that he either betray or destroy me.</p>

<p>Zanda must have learned by this time from Dejah Thoris that I
was John Carter, Prince of Helium. That knowledge would,
undoubtedly, free her from all sense of obligation to me; and I
could not but recall that she had sworn to kill John Carter if ever
the opportunity presented itself. This left only Jat Or and Umka
upon whom I could depend; and, as a matter of fact, I was not
depending too much upon Umka. His intentions might be good enough,
but I knew too little of his fighting heart and ability to be able
to definitely assure myself that the cat-man of Ladan would prove
an important and effective ally.</p>

<p>As these discouraging thoughts were racing through my brain, I
was causing the ship to drop slowly toward the Diamond Tower and
circle it; and presently I saw a red scarf across the sill of a
lighted window.</p>

<p>Silently the ship drew closer. The doors in both sides of the
cabin were open to permit Gar Nal to cross from his ship to the
window in the tower.</p>

<p>I stood upon the threshold of the port doorway, ready to leap
into the room the instant that the ship drew close enough.</p>

<p>The interior of the room beyond the window was not brilliantly
lighted, but in the dim illumination I could see the figures of
three women, and my heart leaped with renewed hope.</p>

<p>The discovery of the scarlet scarf flying from the window had
not wholly reassured me, as I was fully conscious of the fact that
it might have been placed there as a lure; but the presence of the
three women in the chamber appeared reasonable evidence that Ozara
had carried out her part of the agreement loyally.</p>

<p>As the ship came closer to the sill, I prepared to leap into the
room beyond; and just as I jumped I heard a voice raised in alarm
and warning far below me at the base of the tower. We had been
discovered.</p>

<p>As I alighted from the floor of the chamber, Dejah Thoris voiced
a little exclamation of happiness. "My chieftain!" she cried. "I
knew that you would come. Wherever they might have taken me, I knew
that you would follow."</p>

<p>"To the end of the universe, my Princess," I replied.</p>

<p>The warning cry from below that told me that we had been
discovered left no time now for greeting or explanation, nor would
either Dejah Thoris or myself reveal to strangers the emotions that
were in our breasts. I wanted to take her to my heart, to crush her
beautiful body to mine, to cover her lips with kisses; but instead
I only said, "Come, we must board the ship at once. The guard below
has raised the alarm."</p>

<p>Zanda came and clutched my arm. "I knew you would come, Vandor,"
she said.</p>

<p>I could not understand her use of that name. Could it be that
Dejah Thoris had not told her who I was? Ozara also knew my name.
It seemed incredible that she should not have mentioned it when she
came to the room to explain to the two women imprisoned there that
a rescue had been planned and who was to execute it.</p>

<p>The Jeddara of the Tarids did not greet me. She scrutinized me
beneath narrowed lids through the silky fringe of her long lashes;
and as my eyes rested for a moment on hers, I thought that I
recognized in her glance a hint of malice; but perhaps that was
only my imagination, and certainly I had no time now to analyze or
question her emotions.</p>

<p>As I turned toward the window with Dejah Thoris, I was filled
with consternation. The ships were gone!</p>

<p>Running to the opening, I looked out; and to the left I saw both
crafts moving off into the night.</p>

<p>What had happened to thus wreck my plans in the very instant of
success?</p>

<p>The three women shared my consternation. "The ship!" exclaimed
Dejah Thoris.</p>

<p>"Where has it gone?" cried Ozara.</p>

<p>"We are lost," said Zanda, quite simply. "I can hear armed men
running up the stairway."</p>

<p>Suddenly I realized what had happened. I had directed the brain
to approach the window, but I had not told it to stop. I had
jumped, and it had gone on before my companions could follow me;
and Gar Nal, not knowing what had occurred, had continued on with
it, following me as I had directed.</p>

<p>Instantly, I centered my thoughts upon the mechanical brain and
directed it to bring the ship back to the window and stop there.
Self-reproach now was useless but I could not help but be cognizant
of the fact that my carelessness had jeopardized the safety of my
princess and those others who had looked to me for protection.</p>

<p>I could now plainly hear the warriors approaching. They were
coming swiftly. From the window, I could see both ships turning
now. Would they reach us before it was too late? I commanded the
brain to return at the highest speed compatible with safety. It
leaped forward in response to my wishes. The warriors were very
close now. I judged that they were approaching the next level
below. In another moment they would be at the door.</p>

<p>I carried the long sword of one of the Tarid warriors that we
had overpowered in the cabin of the craft, but could a single sword
for long prevail over the many that I knew must be coming?</p>

<p>The ships drew closer, Gar Nal's almost abreast of mine. I saw
Jat Or and Ur Jan standing in the doorway of Fal Sivas's ship.</p>

<p>"The alarm has been raised and warriors are almost at the door,"
I called to them. "I will try to hold them off while you get the
women aboard."</p>

<p>Even as I spoke, I heard the enemy just outside the door of the
chamber. "Stay close to the window," I directed the three women,
"and board the boat the moment it touches the sill;" then I crossed
the room quickly to the door, the Tarid long sword ready in my
hand.</p>

<p>I had scarcely reached it, when it was thrown open; a dozen
warriors crowded in the corridor beyond. The first one to leap into
the room leaped full upon the point of my blade. With a single,
piercing scream he died; and as I jerked my steel from his heart,
he lunged forward at my feet.</p>

<p>In the brief instant that my weapon was thus engaged, three men
forced themselves into the room, pushed forward by those
behind.</p>

<p>One thrust at me, and another swung a terrific cut at my head. I
parried the thrust and dodged the cut, and then my blade clove the
skull of one of them.</p>

<p>For a moment I forgot everything in the joy of battle. I felt my
lips tense in the fighting smile that is famous in two worlds.
Again, as upon so many other fields, my sword seemed inspired; but
the Tarids were no mean swordsmen, nor were they cowards. They
pushed forward into the room over the bodies of their dead
companions.</p>

<p>I think that I could have accounted for them all singlehanded,
with such fierce enthusiasm did I throw my whole being into the
defense of my princess; but now from below I heard the tramp of
many feet and the rattling of accouterments. Reinforcements were
coming!</p>

<p>It had been a glorious fight so far. Six lay dead upon the floor
about me; but now the other six were all in the room, yet I would
have felt no discouragement had I not heard the thunderous pounding
of those many feet leaping rapidly upward from below.</p>

<p>I was engaged with a strapping fellow who sought to push me
back, when one of his companions attempted to reach my side and
distract my attention, while another edged to my opposite side.</p>

<p>My situation at that moment was embarrassing, to say the least,
for the man who engaged me in front was not only a powerful fellow
but a splendid swordsman; and then I saw a sword flash at my right
and another at my left. Two of my adversaries went down, and in the
next instant a quick glance showed me that Ur Jan and Jat Or were
fighting at my side.</p>

<p>As the three remaining Tarids bravely leaped in to take the
places of their fallen comrades, the van of their reinforcements
arrived; and a perfect avalanche of yelling warriors burst into the
apartment.</p>

<p>As I finally succeeded in spitting my antagonist, I snatched a
momentary opportunity to glance behind me.</p>

<p>I saw the three women and Umka in the room and Gar Nal standing
upon the sill of the window.</p>

<p>"Quick, Gar Nal," I cried, "get the women aboard."</p>

<p>For the next few minutes I was about as busy as I can remember
ever having been before in my life. The Tarids were all around us.
They had succeeded in encircling us. I was engaged constantly with
two or three swordsmen at a time. I could not see what was taking
place elsewhere in the room, but my thoughts were always of Dejah
Thoris and her safety; and suddenly it occurred to me that if all
of us who were fighting there in the room should be destroyed, she
would be left in the power of Gar Nal without a defender.</p>

<p>Jat Or was fighting near me. "The princess!" I called to him;
"she is alone on the ship with Gar Nal. If we are both killed, she
is lost. Go to her at once."</p>

<p>"And leave you, my prince?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"It is not a request, Jat Or," I said; "it is a command."</p>

<p>"Yes, my prince," he replied, and fought his way to the
window.</p>

<p>"Help him, Ur Jan," I commanded.</p>

<p>The three of us managed to cut a path for Jat Or to the window,
and as we stood with our backs to it, I saw something which filled
me with consternation. At one side, struggling in the grip of two
warriors, was Ozara, the Jeddara of the Tarids.</p>

<p>"Save me, John Carter," she cried. "Save me, or I shall be
killed."</p>

<p>There was nothing else that I could do. No other path would be
honorable. Ozara had made it possible for us to escape. Perhaps her
deed had already succeeded in saving Dejah Thoris. My own stupidity
had placed us in this position, which now had become a definite
threat to the life of the Jeddara.</p>

<p>Jat Or, Ur Jan, and I had succeeded in cutting down the warriors
that immediately faced us; and the others, probably the least
courageous of the band, seemed to hesitate to engage us again
immediately.</p>

<p>I turned to my companions. "On board with you, quick," I cried,
"and hold the entrance to the ship until I bring the Jeddara
aboard."</p>

<p>As I started toward the warriors holding Ozara, I saw Umka at my
side. He had given a good account of himself in the fight, although
he had carried no sword, which, at the time, I did not understand
because there was a plentiful supply of weapons aboard the craft;
but later I was to learn that it is not the manner of the Masenas
to fight with swords or daggers, with the use of which they are
wholly unfamiliar.</p>

<p>I had seen in this encounter how he fought; and I realized that
his powerful muscles and the terrible jaws of his lower mouth were
adequate weapons even against a swordsman, aided as they were by
the catlike agility of the Masena.</p>

<p>Umka had received a number of wounds; and was bleeding
profusely, as, in fact, were all of us; but I thought that he
looked about finished and ordered him back to the ship. He demurred
at first, but finally he went, and I was alone in the room with the
remaining Tarids.</p>

<p>I knew that my position was hopeless, but I could not leave to
her death this girl who had aided me.</p>

<p>As I sprang forward to attack her captors, I saw another
contingent of reinforcements burst into the room.</p>

<p>My case was now, indeed, hopeless.</p>

<p>The newcomers paid no attention to me; they ran straight for the
window where the ship lay. If they succeeded in boarding her, the
doom of Dejah Thoris would be sealed.</p>

<p>There was only one way in which I could circumvent them, though
it definitely spelled the end for me.</p>

<p>The two men holding Ozara were waiting for me to attack them,
but I paused long enough to hurl a mental order at the mechanical
brain in the nose of Fal Sivas's ship.</p>

<p>I cast a glance back at the craft. Ur Jan and Umka stood in the
doorway; Jat Or was not there; but at the very instant that the
ship started to move away in obedience to my command, the young
padwar sprang into view.</p>

<p>"My prince," he cried, "we have been betrayed. Gar Nal has fled
with Dejah Thoris in his own ship."</p>

<p>Then the Tarids were upon me. A blow upon my head sent me down
to merciful unconsciousness.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap22" id="chap22">XXII. &mdash; IN THE DARK CELL</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Enveloped in darkness, surrounded by the silence
of the grave, I regained consciousness. I was lying on a cold,
stone floor; my head ached; and when I felt it with my palms, it
was stiff with dried blood; and my hair was matted.</p>

<p>Dizzily, I dragged myself to a sitting posture and then to my
feet. Then came realization that I probably was not seriously
injured, and I commenced to investigate my surroundings.</p>

<p>Moving cautiously, groping through the darkness with
outstretched hands before me, I soon came in contact with a stone
wall. This I followed for a short distance, when I discovered a
door. It was a very substantial door, and it was securely fastened
from the opposite side.</p>

<p>I moved on; I encircled the room and came to the door again. It
was a small room, this new cell of mine. It had nothing to offer to
either my eyes or to my ears. I commenced to realize the sort of
world that the blind and the deaf must live in.</p>

<p>There were left to me then, only the senses of taste and smell
and touch.</p>

<p>The first, of course, was useless to me under the circumstances;
my nose, at first, identified a stale and musty odor; but presently
becoming accustomed to it, it did not react at all. There was left
to me then only the sense of touch. A strong wall broken by a
wooden door&mdash;this was my world.</p>

<p>I wondered how long they would leave me here. It was like being
buried alive. I knew that I must steel my will against the horrible
monotony of it, with only the stone wall and that wooden door and
my thoughts for company.</p>

<p>My thoughts! They were not pleasant. I thought of Dejah Thoris
alone in the power of Gar Nal; I thought of poor Jat Or imprisoned
in a ship that he could not control, with Ur Jan, the brutal
assassin of Zodanga. I knew what his thoughts must be, knowing
nothing of my fate, and feeling his sole responsibility for the
safety of Dejah Thoris, whom he was helpless either to protect or
avenge.</p>

<p>I thought of poor Zanda, to whom fate had been so unkind,
condemned now to almost certain death above this distant
satellite.</p>

<p>And Umka. Well, Umka had expected to die; and so he was no worse
off now than he would have been had he never met me.</p>

<p>But the bitterest thought of all was that my own carelessness
had brought disaster upon those who had looked to me for aid and
protection.</p>

<p>Thus, futilely, I added mental torture to the monotony of those
dragging hours.</p>

<p>The vault-like hole in which I was incarcerated was chill and
damp. I surmised that they had placed me in the pits beneath the
castle where no ship could reach me. My muscles were stiff; my
blood ran sluggishly through my veins; hopelessness engulfed
me.</p>

<p>Presently I realized that if I gave way to my morbid
reflections, I should indeed be lost. Again and again I reminded
myself that I still lived. I told myself that life was sweet; for
so long as it persisted, there was still a chance that I might
redeem myself and go out into the world again to serve my
princess.</p>

<p>Now I commenced to move around my cell, encircling it several
times until I knew its dimensions; and then I trotted to and fro,
back and forth, around and around; and like a shadow boxer, I led
and feinted and parried, until at last I had my blood flowing again
and felt the warmth of life renewing my vitality and flushing the
sediment of foul worry from my brain.</p>

<p>I could not keep this up constantly, and so I sought to find
other diversions by counting the stones set in the walls of my
cell. I started at the door and moved around to the left. It was
not the most entertaining pastime in which I had indulged, but at
least there was a spice of excitement added to it by the thought
that I might find some loose stones and possibly uncover an
aperture leading to another apartment and to escape. Thus my
imagination helped to alleviate the horrors of the darkness and the
silence.</p>

<p>I could not, of course, measure time. I did not know how long I
had been imprisoned there, but finally I became sleepy. I lay down
upon the cold, damp floor.</p>

<p>When I awoke, I did not know how long I had slept; but I was
very much refreshed, and so I concluded that I had passed the
normal number of hours in rest.</p>

<p>Again, however, I was numb and cold; and once more I set myself
to the exercises that would restore my circulation to normal; and
as I was thus engaged, I heard sounds beyond the door of my
cell.</p>

<p>I stopped and listened. Yes, someone was approaching. I waited,
watching in the direction that I knew the door to be; and presently
it opened, and a light flared in.</p>

<p>It was a blinding light to one whose eyes had become accustomed
to the total darkness of the cell. I had to turn away my head and
shield my eyes with my hand.</p>

<p>When I could look again, I saw a single warrior carrying a
torch, a bowl of food, and a jug of water.</p>

<p>He had opened the door only wide enough to permit him to pass
the receptacles through and set them on the floor of my cell. I saw
that a heavy chain prevented the door from opening farther, as well
as preventing me from attacking the bearer of my food and
escaping.</p>

<p>The fellow raised his torch above his head and looked at me,
inserting it through the crack of the door so that it fully
illuminated the entire interior of the cell, or at least as high as
some heavy wooden beam that spanned the room about twenty feet from
the floor.</p>

<p>"So you weren't killed after all," commented the warrior.</p>

<p>"That is more than you can say for some of the others who fought
in the Diamond Tower last night," I replied; "or was it last
night?"</p>

<p>"No, it was night before last," he said. "It must have been some
fight," he added. "I was not there, but the whole castle has been
talking about it ever since. Those who fought against you say you
are the greatest swordsman that ever lived. They would like to have
you stay here and fight for them instead of against them, but old
Ul Vas is so furious that nothing will satisfy him but your
death."</p>

<p>"I can imagine that he doesn't feel very kindly toward me," I
agreed.</p>

<p>"No, my life on it, he doesn't. It was bad enough letting all
his prisoners escape, but planning to take his jeddara with you,
phew! By my life, that was something. They say that the reason that
you still live is because he hasn't been able to think of any death
commensurate with your crime."</p>

<p>"And the Jeddara?" I asked; "what of her?"</p>

<p>"He's got her locked up; she'll be killed, too. I imagine that
he is planning to put you both to death at the same time and
probably in the same way. It is a shame to kill such a swordsman as
you, but I am sure that it is going to be very interesting. I hope
that I shall be fortunate enough to see it."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "I hope you enjoy it."</p>

<p>"Everyone will enjoy it but you and Ozara," he said, good-
naturedly; and then he withdrew the torch, closed and locked the
door; and I heard his footsteps receding as he departed.</p>

<p>I groped my way over to the food and water, as I was both hungry
and thirsty; and as I ate and drank, I speculated upon what he had
told me and upon what I had seen in the light of the flaring
torch.</p>

<p>The beams, twenty feet above the floor, intrigued me. Above them
there seemed to be nothing but a dark void, as though the ceiling
of the cell was much farther above.</p>

<p>As I finished my meal, I determined to investigate what lay
above those beams. On Mars, my earthly muscles permitted me to jump
to extraordinary heights. I recalled the calculation that a
full-sized earth man on Thuria could jump to a height of 225 feet.
I realized, of course, that my size had been reduced, so that in
proportion to Thuria I was no larger than I had been upon Barsoom;
but I was still certain that my earthly muscles would permit me to
jump much higher than any inhabitant of Ladan.</p>

<p>As I prepared to put my plan into practice, I was confronted by
the very serious obstacle which the total darkness presented. I
could not see the beams. In jumping for them, I might strike my
head squarely against one of them with highly painful, if not
fatal, results.</p>

<p>When you cannot see, it is difficult to tell how high you are
jumping; but I had no light and no way of making a light; so all I
could do was to be as careful as I could and trust to luck.</p>

<p>I tried springing upward a little way at a time at first, my
hands extended above my head; and this proved very successful, for
eventually I struck a beam.</p>

<p>I jumped again to place its exact position, and then I leaped
for it and caught it. Raising myself onto it, I felt my way along
to the wall. There I stood erect and reached upward, but I could
feel nothing above me.</p>

<p>Then I went to the opposite end of the beam, and still I found
nothing to give me any ray of hope.</p>

<p>It would have been suicidal to have investigated farther by
leaping up from the beam, and so I dropped to the floor again. Then
I leaped for another beam and made a similar investigation, with
the same result.</p>

<p>Thus, one beam at a time, I explored the void above them as far
as I could reach; but always the result was the same.</p>

<p>My disappointment was intense. In a situation such as mine, one
grasps at such tiny straws. He reposes all his hopes, his future,
his very life upon them; and when they are inadequate to support
the weight of so much responsibility, he is plunged into the
uttermost depths of despair.</p>

<p>But I would not admit defeat. The beams were there; they seemed
to have been providentially placed for me to use in some way.</p>

<p>I racked my brain, searching for some plan whereby I might
escape. I was like a rat in a trap, a cornered rat; and my mind
commenced to function with all the cunning of a wild beast seeking
to escape a snare.</p>

<p>Presently an idea came to me. It seemed Heaven-sent; but that
was probably more because it was the only plan that had presented
itself, rather than because it had any intrinsic merit. It was a
wild, hare-brained plan that depended upon many things over which I
had no control. Fate must needs be very kind to me if it were to
succeed.</p>

<p>I was sitting disconsolately upon the last beam that I had
investigated when it came to me. Immediately I dropped to the floor
of my cell and went and stood by the door, listening.</p>

<p>How long I remained there, I do not know. When fatigue overcame
me, I lay down and slept with my ear against the door. I never left
it. I took my exercise jumping about in the same spot there by that
fateful door.</p>

<p>At last my ears were rewarded by that for which they had been
listening.</p>

<p>Footsteps were approaching. I could hear them shuffling in the
distance; I could hear the clank of metal upon metal. The sounds
were increasing in volume. A warrior was approaching.</p>

<p>I leaped for the beam directly above the door; and crouching
there like a beast of prey, I waited.</p>

<p>The footsteps halted just outside my cell. I heard the bars that
secured the door sliding from their keepers, and then the door was
pushed open and a light appeared. I saw an arm and hand extend into
the room and set down jars of food and water. Then a flaming torch
was thrust into the room, followed by a man's head. I saw the
fellow looking around the interior of the cell.</p>

<p>"Hey, there!" he cried; "where are you?"</p>

<p>The voice was not that of the man who had brought my food on the
previous occasion. I did not reply.</p>

<p>"By the crown of the Jeddak," he muttered, "has the fellow
escaped?"</p>

<p>I heard him fussing with the chain that held the door from
opening but a few inches, and my heart stood still. Could it be
that my wild hope was to be realized? Upon this one hoped-for
possibility hinged all the rest of my plans and hopes.</p>

<p>The door swung open, and the man stepped cautiously into the
room. He was a sturdy warrior. In his left hand he carried the
torch, and in his right he gripped a keen long-sword.</p>

<p>He moved cautiously, looking around him at every step.</p>

<p>He was still too close to the door. Very slowly he started
across the cell, muttering to himself; and in the darkness above, I
followed along the beam, like a panther stalking its prey. Still
mumbling surprised exclamations, he started back. He passed beneath
me; and as he did so, I sprang.</p>

<br>

<h2><a name="chap23" id="chap23">XXIII. &mdash; THE SECRET DOOR</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Echoing through the chamber and the corridor
beyond, the screams of the warrior seemed enough to bring every
fighting man in the castle upon me, as I launched myself upon him
and brought him to the floor.</p>

<p>As the man went down, the light of the torch was extinguished;
we fought in total darkness. My first aim was to quiet his screams,
and this I did the instant that my fingers found his throat.</p>

<p>It seemed almost in the nature of a miracle that my dream of
escape should be materializing, step by step, almost precisely as I
had visualized it; and this thought gave me hope that good fortune
might continue to attend me until I was safely out of the clutches
of Ul Vas.</p>

<p>The warrior with whom I struggled upon the stone floor of that
dark cell beneath the castle of the Tarids was a man of only
ordinary physical strength, and I soon subdued him.</p>

<p>Possibly I accomplished this sooner than I might have otherwise;
for, after I got my fingers on his throat, I promised I would not
kill him if he would cease his struggling and his attempted
screaming.</p>

<p>With me, time was an all-important factor; for even if the man's
outcry had not been heard by his comrades above stairs, it seemed
quite reasonable that if he did not return to his other duties
within a reasonable time, a search for him would be instituted. If
I were to escape, I must get out at once; and so, after I made my
offer to the man and he ceased his struggling momentarily, I
released my grip upon his throat long enough for him to accept or
refuse my proposition.</p>

<p>Being a man of intelligence, he accepted.</p>

<p>I immediately bound him with his own harness and, as an added
precaution, stuffed a gag in his mouth. Next I relieved him of his
dagger, and after groping around on the floor for some time I found
the long-sword that had fallen from his hand when I first attacked
him.</p>

<p>"And now good-bye, my friend," I said. "You need not feel
humiliated at your defeat; far better men than you have gone down
before John Carter, Prince of Helium." Then I went out and closed
and locked the door of the cell after me.</p>

<p>The corridor was very dark. I had had but one brief glimpse of
it, or rather of a portion of it, when my food had been brought to
me the previous day.</p>

<p>It had seemed to me then that the corridor led straight away
from the entrance to my cell, and now I groped my way through the
darkness in that direction. Probably I should have moved slowly
along that unknown passageway; but I did not, for I knew, that if
the warrior's cries had been heard in the castle above, there might
be an investigation; and I most certainly did not wish to meet a
body of armed men in that <i>cul-de-sac</i>.</p>

<p>Keeping one hand against the wall to guide me, I moved rapidly
forward; and I had gone perhaps a hundred yards when I discerned a
faint suggestion of light ahead of me. It did not seem to be the
yellowish light of a torch, but, rather, diffused daylight.</p>

<p>It increased in volume as I approached it, and presently I came
to the foot of the stairway down which it was shining.</p>

<p>All this time, I had heard nothing to indicate that anyone was
coming to investigate; so it was with a feeling of at least some
security that I ascended the stairway.</p>

<p>With the utmost caution, I entered the level above. Here it was
much lighter. I was in a short corridor with a doorway on either
side; ahead of me the passageway ended in a transverse corridor. I
moved quickly forward, for I could now see my way quite clearly, as
the corridor, although extremely gloomy, was much better lighted
than that from which I had emerged.</p>

<p>I was congratulating myself upon my good fortune as I was about
to turn into the transverse corridor, when I bumped full into a
figure at the turn.</p>

<p>It was a woman. She was probably much more surprised than I, and
she started to scream.</p>

<p>I knew that, above all things, I must prevent her from giving an
alarm; and so I seized her and clapped a hand across her mouth.</p>

<p>I had just turned the corner into the other corridor when I
collided with her; its full length was visible to me; and now, as I
silenced the woman, I saw two warriors turn into it at the far end.
They were coming in my direction. Evidently I had congratulated
myself too soon.</p>

<p>Unencumbered by my captive, I might have found a hiding-place,
or, failing that, I could have lain in ambush for them in this
darker passageway and killed them both before they could raise an
alarm; but here I was with both of my hands occupied, one of them
holding the struggling girl and the other effectually silencing her
attempt to cry out.</p>

<p>I could not kill her, and if I turned her loose she would have
the whole castle on me in a few moments. My case seemed entirely
hopeless, but I did not give up hope. I had come this far; I would
not, I could not, admit defeat.</p>

<p>Then I recalled the two doors that I had passed in the short
corridor. One of them was only a few paces to my rear.</p>

<p>"Keep still, and I will not harm you," I whispered, and then I
dragged her along the corridor to the nearest door.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it was unlocked; but what lay beyond it, I did not
know. I had to think quickly and decide what I should do if it were
occupied. There seemed only one thing to do, push the girl into it
and then run back to meet the two warriors that I had seen
approaching. In other words, try to fight my way out of the castle
of Ul Vas&mdash;a mad scheme, with half a thousand warriors to
block my way.</p>

<p>But the room was not occupied, as I could see the moment that I
entered it; for it was well lighted by several windows.</p>

<p>Closing the door, I stood with my back against it, listening. I
had not looked down at the woman in my arms; I was too intent upon
listening for the approach of the two warriors I had seen. Would
they turn into this corridor? Would they come to this very
room?</p>

<p>I must have unconsciously released my pressure upon the girl's
lips; for before I could prevent it, she tore my hand away and
spoke.</p>

<p>"John Carter!" she exclaimed in a low tone.</p>

<p>I looked down at her in surprise, and then I recognized her. It
was Ulah, the slave of Ozara, the Jeddara of the Tarids.</p>

<p>"Ulah," I said, earnestly, "please do not make me harm you. I do
not wish to harm anyone in the castle; I only wish to escape. More
than my life depends upon that, so very much more that I would
break the unwritten law of my caste even to killing a woman, were
it necessary to do so to accomplish my purpose."</p>

<p>"You need not fear me," she said, "I will not betray you."</p>

<p>"You are a wise girl," I said; "you have bought your life very
cheaply."</p>

<p>"It was not to save my life that I promised," she said. "I would
not have betrayed you in any event."</p>

<p>"And why?" I asked. "You owe me nothing."</p>

<p>"I love my mistress, Ozara," she said simply.</p>

<p>"And what has that to do with it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I would not harm one whom my mistress loves."</p>

<p>Of course, I knew that Ulah was romancing&mdash;letting her
imagination work overtime; and as it was immaterial what she
believed so long as she helped me, I did not contradict her.</p>

<p>"Where is your mistress now?" I asked.</p>

<p>"She is in this very tower," she replied. "She is locked in a
room directly above this one, on the next level. Ul Vas is keeping
her there until he is ready to destroy her. Oh, save her, John
Carter, save her!"</p>

<p>"How did you learn my name, Ulah?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The Jeddara told me," she replied; "she talked about you
constantly."</p>

<p>"You are better acquainted with the castle than I am, Ulah," I
said; "is there any way in which I can reach the Jeddara? Can you
get a message to her? Could we get her out of that room?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied; "the door is locked, and two warriors stand
guard outside it day and night."</p>

<p>I walked to the window and looked out. There seemed to be no one
in sight. Then I leaned out as far as I could and looked up.
Perhaps fifteen feet above me was another window. I turned back
into the room.</p>

<p>"You are sure that the Jeddara is in the room directly above
this?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I know it," she replied.</p>

<p>"And you want to help her to escape?"</p>

<p>"Yes; there is nothing that I would not do to serve her."</p>

<p>"What is this room used for?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing, now," she replied; "you see everything is covered with
dust. It has not been used for a long time."</p>

<p>"You think it is not likely that anyone will come here?" I
asked. "You think I might hide here safely until tonight?"</p>

<p>"I am sure that you are perfectly safe," she replied; "I do not
know why anyone should come here."</p>

<p>"Good!" I exclaimed. "Do you really want to help your mistress
to escape?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart," she replied. "I could not bear to see her
die."</p>

<p>"You can help her, then," I said.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Bring me a rope and a strong hook. Do you think you can do
it?"</p>

<p>"How long a rope?"</p>

<p>"About twenty feet."</p>

<p>"When do you want them?"</p>

<p>"Whenever you can bring them without danger of detection, but
certainly before midnight tonight."</p>

<p>"I can get them," she said. "I will go at once."</p>

<p>I had to trust her; there was no other way, and so I let her
depart.</p>

<p>After she had gone and I had closed the door behind her, I found
a heavy bar on the inside. I dropped this into its keeper so that
no one could enter the room unexpectedly and take me by surprise.
Then I sat down to wait.</p>

<p>Those were long hours that dragged themselves slowly by. I could
not but constantly question my wisdom in trusting the slave girl,
Ulah. What did I know about her? By what loyalty was she bound to
me, except by the thin bond engendered by her foolish imagination?
Perhaps, already, she had arranged for my capture. It would not be
at all surprising that she had a lover among the warriors, as she
was quite beautiful. What better turn could she serve him than by
divulging the place of my concealment and permitting him to be the
means of my capture and perhaps thereby winning promotion?</p>

<p>Toward the end of the afternoon, when I heard footsteps coming
along the corridor toward my hiding place&mdash;the first sounds
that I had heard since Ulah left me&mdash;I was certain that
warriors were coming to seize me. I determined that I would give a
good account of myself; and so I stood by the door, my long sword
ready in my hand; but the footsteps passed by me. They were moving
in the direction of the stairway up which I had come from the black
corridor leading to my cell.</p>

<p>Not long after, I heard them returning. There were a number of
men talking excitedly, but through the heavy door I could not quite
catch their words. When they had passed out of hearing, I breathed
a sigh of relief; and my confidence in Ulah commenced to take new
heart.</p>

<p>Night fell. Light began to shine beyond many of the windows in
the castle visible from the room in which I hid.</p>

<p>Why did not Ulah return? Had she been unable to find a rope and
a hook? Was something or someone detaining her? What futile
questions one propounds in the extremity of despair.</p>

<p>Presently I heard a sound outside the door of the room. I had
heard no one approaching; but now I knew that someone was pushing
on the door, attempting to enter. I went close to it and put my ear
against the panels. Then I heard a voice. "Open, it is Ulah."</p>

<p>Great was my relief as I drew the bar and admitted the slave
girl. It was quite dark in the room; we could not see one
another.</p>

<p>"Did you think I was never going to return, John Carter?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I was commencing to have my doubts," I replied. "Were you able
to get the things I asked for?"</p>

<p>"Yes, here they are," she said, and I felt a rope and a hook
pressed into my hand.</p>

<p>"Good!" I exclaimed. "Have you learned anything while you were
away that might help me or the Jeddara?"</p>

<p>"No," she said, "nothing that will help you but something that
may make it more difficult for you to leave the castle, if that
were possible at all, which I doubt."</p>

<p>"What is that?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"They have learned of your escape from the cell," she replied.
"The warrior who was sent there with your food did not return; and
when other warriors went to investigate, they found him bound and
gagged in the cell where you should have been."</p>

<p>"It must have been they I heard passing the door late in the
afternoon," I said. "It is strange they have not searched this
room."</p>

<p>"They think you went in another direction," she explained. "They
are searching another part of the castle."</p>

<p>"But eventually they will come here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said; "eventually they will search every room in the
castle, but that will take a long time."</p>

<p>"You have done well, Ulah," I said. "I am sorry that I can offer
you nothing more in return than my thanks."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to do even more," she said; "there is nothing
that I would not do to help you and the jeddara."</p>

<p>"There is nothing more that you can do," I told her; "and now
you had better go, before they find you here with me."</p>

<p>"You are sure that there is nothing more I can do?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"No, nothing, Ulah," and I opened the door, and she went
out.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, and good luck, John Carter," she whispered, as I
closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>I went at once to the window, after rebolting the door. It was
very dark outside. I had wanted to wait until after midnight and
until the castle was asleep before I attempted to put into practice
the plan I contemplated for the rescue of Ozara, but the knowledge
that they were searching the castle for me forced me to put aside
every consideration except haste.</p>

<p>I fastened one end of the rope securely to the hook that Ulah
had brought me. Then I sat on the window sill and leaned far
out.</p>

<p>I took one end of the rope in my left hand where I grasped the
frame of the window, and held the hook in my right hand, permitting
the slack of the rope to fall free beneath me against the side of
the tower outside the window.</p>

<p>I gauged the distance upward to the sill of the window above. It
seemed too far for me to hope to make a successful cast from the
position in which I was sitting, and so I arose and stood on the
sill of the window. This brought me a few feet nearer my goal and
also gave me a little more freedom of action.</p>

<p>I was very anxious to be successful at the first cast; for I
feared that if I missed, the rattling of the metal hook against the
side of the tower might attract attention.</p>

<p>I stood there several minutes gauging the distance and going
through all the motions of throwing the hook except actually
releasing it.</p>

<p>When I felt that I had the timing and the distance as accurately
gauged as it was possible to do in this manner, I swung the hook
upward and released it.</p>

<p>I could see the sill above me, because a faint light was coming
from the room beyond it. I saw the hook swing into this light; I
heard it strike the sill with a metallic ring; then I pulled down
upon the rope.</p>

<p>The hook had caught! I put considerable weight upon the rope,
and still the hook held. I waited a moment to see if I had
attracted the attention of Ozara or anyone else who might be in the
room with her.</p>

<p>No sign came out of the silence above, and I let my body swing
out upon the rope.</p>

<p>I had to ascend very carefully, for I did not know how secure a
hold the hook had upon the sill above.</p>

<p>I had not a great distance to climb, yet it seemed an eternity
before my hand touched the sill.</p>

<p>First the fingers of one hand closed over it; then I drew myself
up until I could grasp it with my other hand. Slowly, by main
strength, I raised myself until my eyes were above the level of the
sill. Before me was a dimly lighted room, apparently vacant.</p>

<p>I drew myself up farther until I could get one knee upon the
sill, and always I was very careful not to dislodge the hook.</p>

<p>When, at last, my position was secure, I entered the room,
taking the hook in with me lest it slip and fall to the bottom of
the tower on the outside.</p>

<p>Now I saw that the room was occupied. A woman rose from her bed
upon the opposite side. She was looking at me with wide,
horror-struck eyes. It was Ozara. I thought she was going to
scream.</p>

<p>Raising a warning finger to my lips, I approached her. "Make no
sound, Ozara," I whispered; "I have come to save you."</p>

<p>"John Carter!" She breathed the name in tones so low that they
could not have been heard beyond the door. As she spoke, she came
close and threw her arms about my neck.</p>

<p>"Come," I said, "we must get out of here at once. Do not talk;
we may be overheard."</p>

<p>Taking her to the window, I drew in the rope and fastened the
lower end of it around her waist.</p>

<p>"I am going to lower you to the window of the room just below,"
I whispered. "As soon as you are safely inside, untie the rope and
let it swing out for me."</p>

<p>She nodded, and I lowered her away. Presently the rope went
slack, and I knew that she had reached the sill of the room below.
I waited for her to unfasten it from her body; then I engaged the
hook over the sill upon which I sat, and quickly descended to the
room below.</p>

<p>I did not wish to leave the hook and the rope as they were,
because, in the event that anyone should enter Ozara's cell above,
this evidence would point immediately to the room below; and I did
not know how long we might have to wait here.</p>

<p>As gently as possible, I shook the hook loose and was fortunate
in catching it as it dropped and before it could scrape against the
side of the tower.</p>

<p>As I entered the room, Ozara came close to me and placed her
hands upon my breast. She was trembling, and her voice was
trembling as she spoke.</p>

<p>"I was so surprised to see you, John Carter," she said. "I
thought that you were dead. I saw them strike you down, and Ul Vas
told me that they had killed you. What a terrible wound; I do not
see how you recovered. When you faced me in the room above and I
saw the blood dried upon your skin and in your hair, it was as
though a dead man had come back to life."</p>

<p>"I had forgotten what a spectacle I must present," I said. "I
have had no opportunity to wash the blood from me since I was
wounded. What little water they brought me barely sufficed for
drinking purposes; but as far as the wound is concerned, it does
not bother me. I am quite recovered; it was only a flesh
wound."</p>

<p>"I was so frightened for you," she said; "and to think that you
took that risk for me, when you might have escaped with your
friends."</p>

<p>"You think they got away all right?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, "and Ul Vas is very furious about it. He
will make you and me pay, if we do not escape."</p>

<p>"Do you know of any way by which we can escape from this
castle?" I asked her.</p>

<p>"There is a secret doorway, known only to Ul Vas and two of his
most faithful slaves," she replied. "At least, Ul Vas thinks that
only those three know of it; but I know. It leads out to the edge
of the river where the waters lap the walls of the castle.</p>

<p>"Ul Vas is not well-liked by his people. There are plots and
intrigues in the castle. There are factions that would like to
overthrow Ul Vas and set up a new jeddak. Some of these enemies are
so powerful that Ul Vas does not dare destroy them openly. These,
he murders secretly; and he has his two faithful slaves carry the
bodies to this secret doorway and cast them into the river.</p>

<p>"Once, suspecting something of the kind, I followed him,
thinking that I might discover a way to escape and return to my own
people in Domnia; but when I saw where the passage led, I was
afraid. I would not dare to jump into the river; and even if I did,
beyond the river there is a terrible forest. I do not know, John
Carter, that we would be much better off either in the river or the
forest than we are here."</p>

<p>"If we remain here, Ozara, we know that we shall meet death and
that there will be no escape. In the river or the forest beyond,
there will be at least a chance; for often wild beasts are less
cruel than men."</p>

<p>"I know that all too well," she replied; "but even in the forest
there are men, terrible men."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I must take the chance, Ozara," I told her. "Will
you come with me?"</p>

<p>"Wherever you take me, John Carter, whatever fate befalls us, I
shall be happy as long as I am with you. I was very angry when I
learned that you loved that woman from Barsoom," she said; "but now
she is gone, and I shall have you all to myself."</p>

<p>"She is my mate, Ozara."</p>

<p>"You love her?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Of course," I replied.</p>

<p>"That is all right," she said, "but she is gone, and you are
mine now."</p>

<p>I had no time to waste on such matters then. It was apparent
that the girl was self-willed; that she had always had her own way,
had everything that she wished, and could not brook being crossed,
no matter how foolish her whim might be. At another time, if we
lived, I might bring her to her senses; but now I must bend every
effort to escape.</p>

<p>"How can we reach this secret doorway?" I asked. "Do you know
the way from here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied; "come with me."</p>

<p>We crossed the room and entered the corridor. It was very dark,
but we groped our way to the stairs that I had ascended from the
pit earlier in the day. When she started down these, I questioned
her.</p>

<p>"Are you sure this is the right way?" I asked. "This leads to
the cell in which I was imprisoned."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it does," she said; "but it also leads to a distant
part of the castle, close to the river, where we shall find the
doorway we are seeking."</p>

<p>I hoped that she knew what she was talking about as I followed
her down the stairway and through the Stygian darkness of the
corridor below.</p>

<p>When I had come through it before, I had guided myself by
pressing my right hand against the wall at my side. Now Ozara
followed the opposite wall; and when we had gone a short distance,
turned into a corridor at our right that I had passed without
knowing of its existence, because I had been following the opposite
wall; and of course in the absolute darkness of the corridor, I had
not been able to see anything.</p>

<p>We followed this new corridor for a long distance, but finally
ascended a circular stairway to the next level above.</p>

<p>Here we came into a lighted corridor.</p>

<p>"If we can reach the other end of this without being
discovered," whispered Ozara, "we shall be safe. At the far end is
a false door that leads into the secret passageway ending at the
door above the river."</p>

<p>We both listened intently. "I hear no one," she said.</p>

<p>"Nor I."</p>

<p>As we started down the long corridor, I saw that there were
rooms opening from it on either side; but as we approached each
door I was relieved to find that it was closed.</p>

<p>We had covered perhaps half the length of the corridor when a
slight noise behind us attracted my attention; and, turning, I saw
two men step from one of the rooms we had recently passed. They
were turning away from us, toward the opposite end of the corridor;
and I was breathing a sigh of relief, when a third man followed
them from the room. This one, through some perversity of fate,
glanced in our direction; and immediately he voiced an exclamation
of surprise and warning.</p>

<p>"The Jeddara!" he cried, "and the black-haired one!"</p>

<p>Instantly the three turned and ran toward us. We were about
halfway between them and the door leading to the secret passage
that was our goal.</p>

<p>Flight, in the face of an enemy, is something that does not set
well upon my stomach; but now there was no alternative, since to
stand and fight would have been but to insure disaster; and so
Ozara and I fled.</p>

<p>The three men pursuing us were shouting at the tops of their
voices for the evident purpose of attracting others to their
assistance.</p>

<p>Something prompted me to draw my long-sword as I ran; and it is
fortunate that I did so; for just as we were approaching a doorway
on our left, a warrior, attracted by the noise in the corridor,
stepped out. Ozara dodged past him just as he drew his sword. I did
not even slacken my speed but took him in my stride, cleaving his
skull as I raced past him.</p>

<p>Now we were at the door, and Ozara was searching for the secret
mechanism that would open it to us. The three men were approaching
rapidly.</p>

<p>"Take your time, Ozara," I cautioned her, for I knew that in the
haste of nervousness her fingers might bungle the job and delay
us.</p>

<p>"I am trembling so," she said; "they will reach us before I can
open it."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about them," I told her. "I can hold them off until
you open it."</p>

<p>Then the three were upon me. I recognized them as officers of
the Jeddak's guard, because their trappings were the same as those
worn by Zamak; and I surmised, and rightly, that they were good
swordsmen.</p>

<p>The one in the lead was too impetuous. He rushed upon me as
though he thought he could cut me down with his first stroke, which
was not the part of wisdom. I ran him through the heart.</p>

<p>As he fell, the others were upon me but they fought more
cautiously; yet, though there were two of them, and their blades
were constantly thrusting and cutting in an endeavor to reach me,
my own sword, moving with the speed of thought, wove a steel net of
defense about me.</p>

<p>But defense alone would not answer my purpose; for if they could
keep me on the defensive, they could hold me here until
reinforcements came; and then, by force of numbers, I must be
overcome.</p>

<p>In the instant, following a parry, my point reached out and
pricked one of my adversaries sharply above the heart.
Involuntarily, he shrank back; and as he did so I turned upon his
companion and opened his chest wide.</p>

<p>Neither wound was mortal, but they slowed my adversaries down.
Ozara was still fumbling with the door. Our situation promised to
be most unpleasant if she were unable to open it, for now at the
far end of the corridor I saw a detachment of warriors racing
toward us; but I did not warn her to hurry, fearing that then, in
her excitement, she would never be able to open it.</p>

<p>The two wounded men were now pressing me hard again. They were
brave warriors and worthy foemen. It is a pleasure to be pitted
against such, although there are always regrets when one must kill
them. However, I had no choice, for then I heard a sudden cry of
relief from Ozara.</p>

<p>"It is open, John Carter," she cried. "Come! Hurry!"</p>

<p>But now the two warriors were engaging me so fiercely that I
could not break away from them.</p>

<p>But just for an instant was I held. With a burst of speed and a
ferocity such as I imagine they had never beheld before, I took the
battle to them. A vicious cut brought down one; and as he fell, I
ran the other through the chest.</p>

<p>The reinforcements running toward us had covered half the length
of the corridor as I hurried through the doorway after Ozara and
closed the door behind me.</p>

<p>Now again we were in complete darkness. "Hurry!" cried Ozara.
"The passageway is straight and level all the way to the door."</p>

<p>Through the darkness, we ran. I heard the men behind me open the
door, and knew that they were in the passageway at our rear; fully
twenty of them there must have been.</p>

<p>Suddenly I ran full upon Ozara. We had come to the end of the
passage, and she was standing at the door. This door she opened
more quickly; and as it swung in, I saw the dark river flowing
beneath us. Upon the opposite shore was the gloomy outline of the
forest.</p>

<p>How cold and mysterious this strange river looked. What
mysteries, what dangers, what terrors, lay in the sinister wood
beyond?</p>

<p>But I was only vaguely conscious of such thoughts. The warriors
who would seize us and carry us back to death were almost upon us
as I took Ozara in my arms and jumped.</p>

<hr>
<br>

<h2><a name="chap24" id="chap24">XXIV. &mdash; BACK TO BARSOOM</a>
</h2>

<p class="first">Dark, forbidding waters closed over our heads and
swirled about us as we rose to the surface; and, equally dark and
forbidding, the forest frowned upon us. Even the moaning of the
wind in the trees seemed an eerie warning; forbidding, threatening.
Behind us, the warriors in the doorway shouted curses upon us.</p>

<p>I struck out for the opposite shore, holding Ozara in one arm
and keeping her mouth and nose above water. She lay so limp that I
thought she had fainted, nor would I have been surprised, for even
a woman of the strongest fibre might weaken after having undergone
what she had had to during the last two days.</p>

<p>But when we reached the opposite shore, she clambered out on the
bank in full possession of all her faculties.</p>

<p>"I thought that you had swooned," I said; "you lay so very
still."</p>

<p>"I do not swim," she replied; "and I knew that if I struggled,
it would hamper you." There was even more to the erstwhile Jeddara
of the Tarids than I had imagined.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do now, John Carter?" she asked. Her teeth
were chattering from cold, or terror; and she seemed very
miserable.</p>

<p>"You are cold," I said; "if I can find anything dry enough to
burn, we shall have a fire."</p>

<p>The girl came close to me. I could feel her body trembling
against mine.</p>

<p>"I am a little cold," she said, "but that is nothing; I am
terribly afraid."</p>

<p>"But why are you afraid now, Ozara? Do you think that Ul Vas
will send men after us?"</p>

<p>"No, it is not that," she replied. "He couldn't make men come
into this wood at night, and even by daylight they would hesitate
to venture into it on this side of the river. Tomorrow he will know
that it will be useless to send after us, for tomorrow we shall be
dead."</p>

<p>"What makes you say that?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"The beasts," she said, "the beasts that hunt through the forest
by night; we cannot escape them."</p>

<p>"Yet you came here willingly."</p>

<p>"Ul Vas would have tortured us," she replied; "the beasts will
be more merciful. Listen! You can hear them now."</p>

<p>In the distance, I heard strange grunts and then a fearsome
roar.</p>

<p>"They are not near us," I said.</p>

<p>"They will come," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then I had better get a fire started; that will keep them
away."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>I knew that in any forest there must be deadwood; and so,
although it was pitch dark, I commenced to search for fallen
branches; and soon I had collected a little pile of these and some
dry leaves.</p>

<p>The Tarids had not taken away my pocket pouch, and in it I still
had the common Martian appliance for making fire.</p>

<p>"You said that the Tarids would hesitate to enter the forest on
this side of the river even by day," I remarked, as I sought to
ignite the dry leaves with which I hoped to start my fire. "Why is
that?"</p>

<p>"The Masenas," she replied. "They often come up the river in
great numbers, hunting the Tarids; and unfortunate is he whom they
find outside the castle walls. It is seldom, however, that they
cross to the other side of the river."</p>

<p>"Why do they hunt the Tarids?" I asked. "What do they want of
them?"</p>

<p>"Food," she replied.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that the Masenas eat human flesh?" I
demanded.</p>

<p>She nodded. "Yes, they are very fond of it."</p>

<p>I had succeeded in igniting the leaves, and now I busied myself
placing small twigs upon my newborn fire and building it up into
the semblance of something worth while.</p>

<p>"But I was imprisoned for a long time with one of the Masenas,"
I reminded her. "He seemed very friendly."</p>

<p>"Under those circumstances, of course," she said, "he might not
try to eat you. He might even become very friendly; but if you
should meet him here in the forest with his own people, you would
find him very different. They are hunting beasts, like all of the
other creatures that inhabit the forest."</p>

<p>My fire grew to quite a respectable size. It illuminated the
forest and the surface of the river and the castle beyond.</p>

<p>When it blazed up and revealed us, the Tarids called across to
us, prophesying our early death.</p>

<p>The warmth of the fire was pleasant after our emersion from the
cold water and our exposure to the chill of the forest night. Ozara
came close to it, stretching her lithe, young body before it. The
yellow flames illuminated her fair skin, imparted a greenish tinge
to her blue hair, awakened slumberous fires in her languorous
eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly she tensed, her eyes widened in fright. "Look!" she
whispered, and pointed.</p>

<p>I turned in the direction that she indicated. From the dense
shadows just beyond the firelight, two blazing eyes were
flaming.</p>

<p>"They have come for us," said Ozara.</p>

<p>I picked a blazing brand from the fire and hurled it at the
intruder. There was a hideous, bloodcurdling scream as the eyes
disappeared.</p>

<p>The girl was trembling again. She cast affrighted glances in all
directions.</p>

<p>"There is another," she exclaimed presently, "and there, and
there, and there."</p>

<p>I caught a glimpse of a great body slinking in the shadows; and
all about us, as I turned, I saw blazing eyes. I threw a few more
brands, but the eyes disappeared for only a moment to return again
almost immediately, and each time they seemed to come closer; and
now, since I had cast the first brand, the beasts were roaring and
growling and screaming continuously&mdash;a veritable diapason of
horror.</p>

<p>I realized that my fire would not last long if I kept throwing
it at the beasts, as I had not sufficient wood to keep it
replenished.</p>

<p>Something must be done. I cast about me rather hopelessly in
search of some avenue of escape and discovered a nearby tree that
looked as though it might be easily scaled. Only such a tree would
be of any advantage to us, as I had no doubt that the creatures
would charge the moment that we started to climb.</p>

<p>I took two brands from the fire and handed them to Ozara, and
then selected two for myself.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?" she asked.</p>

<p>"We are going to try to climb that tree," I replied. "Perhaps
some of these brutes can climb, too, but we shall have to take a
chance. Those I have seen look too large and heavy for
climbing.</p>

<p>"We will walk slowly to the foot of the tree. When we are there,
throw your brands at the nearest beasts; and then start to climb.
When you are safely out of their reach, I will follow."</p>

<p>Slowly we crossed from the fire to the tree, waving the blazing
brands about us.</p>

<p>Here, Ozara did as I had bid her; and when she was safely out of
the way, I grasped one of my brands in my teeth, hurled the other,
and started to climb.</p>

<p>The beasts charged almost instantly, but I reached a point of
safety before they could drag me down, though what with the smoke
of the brand in my eyes and the sparks being scraped off against my
naked hide, I was lucky to have made it at all; but I felt that we
must have the light of the brand, as I did not know what arboreal
enemies might be lurking in the branches above.</p>

<p>I immediately examined the tree, climbing to the highest
branches that would support my weight. With the aid of my light, I
discovered that no creature was in it, other than Ozara and myself;
and high among the branches I made a happy find&mdash;an enormous
nest, carefully woven and lined with soft grasses.</p>

<p>I was about to call down to Ozara to come up, when I saw her
already ascending just below me.</p>

<p>When she saw the nest, she told me that it was probably one of
those built by the Masenas for temporary use during a raid or
expedition into this part of the forest. It was certainly a most
providential find, as it afforded us a comfortable place in which
to spend the remainder of the night.</p>

<p>It was some time before we could accustom ourselves to the
noises of the beasts howling beneath us, but at last we fell
asleep; and when we awoke in the morning, they had departed; and
the forest was quiet.</p>

<p>Ozara had told me that her country, Domnia, lay across the
mountains that rose beyond the forest and that it might be reached
by following the river down for a considerable distance to the end
of the range, where we could follow another river up to Domnia upon
the opposite side.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *

<p>The most remarkable feature of the following two days was the
fact that we survived them. We found food in plenty; and as we were
always near the river, we never suffered for lack of water; but by
day and by night we were constantly in danger of attack by the
roving flesh-eaters.</p>

<p>We always sought to save ourselves by climbing into trees, but
upon three occasions we were taken by surprise; and I was forced to
fall back upon my sword, which had seemed to me a most inadequate
weapon of defense against some of the ferocious beasts that
assailed us.</p>

<p>However, in these three instances, I managed to kill our
attackers, although, I must confess, that it seemed to me then, and
still does, wholly a matter of luck that I succeeded.</p>

<p>By now, Ozara was in a more sanguine frame of mind. Having
survived this long, she felt that it was entirely possible that we
might live to reach Domnia, although originally she had been
confident that we could not come through the first night alive.</p>

<p>She was often quite gay now, and she was really very good
company. Especially was this true on the morning of the third day
as we were making good progress toward our distant goal.</p>

<p>The forest seemed to be unusually quiet; and we had seen no
dangerous beasts all that day, when suddenly a chorus of hideous
roars arose all about us; and simultaneously a score or more of
creatures dropped from the concealing foliage of the trees about
us.</p>

<p>Ozara's happy chatter died on her lips. "The Masenas!" she
cried.</p>

<p>As they surrounded us and started to close in on us, their
roaring ceased and they commenced to meow and purr. This, to me,
seemed far more horrifying. As they came closer, I decided to make
our capture cost them dearly, though I knew that eventually they
would take us. I had seen Umka fight, and I knew what to
expect.</p>

<p>Although they closed about me, they did not seem anxious to
engage me. By pushing close to me on one side and then on the
other, by giving away here and then there, I was forced to move
about considerably; but I did not realize until it was too late
that I was moving in the direction that they wished me to move and
in accordance with their designs.</p>

<p>Presently they got me where they wanted me, beneath the branches
of a great tree; and immediately a Masena dropped upon my shoulders
and bore me to earth. Simultaneously, most of the others swarmed on
top of me, while a few seized Ozara; and thus they disarmed me
before I could strike a blow.</p>

<p>There was a great amount of purring after that, and they seemed
to be having some sort of a discussion; but as it was in their own
language, I did not understand it. Presently, however, they started
down river, dragging us along with them.</p>

<p>After perhaps an hour, we came to a section of the forest from
which all the brushwood had been cleared. The ground beneath the
trees was almost like a lawn. The branches of the trees were
trimmed to a considerable distance about the ground.</p>

<p>As we reached the edge of this park-like space, our captors set
up a loud roaring which was presently answered from the trees we
were approaching.</p>

<p>We were dragged to the foot of a great tree, up which several of
our captors swarmed like cats.</p>

<p>Then came the problem of getting us up. I could see that it
puzzled the Masenas, as well it might have. The bole of the tree
was so large in diameter that no ordinary man could scale it, and
all the branches had been cut off much higher than a man could
jump. I could easily have entered it, but I did not tell them so.
Ozara, however, could never have succeeded alone.</p>

<p>Presently, after considerable meowing and purring and not a
little growling, some of those in the tree above lowered a pliant
liana. One of the Masenas on the ground seized Ozara around the
waist with one arm and the liana with his free hand and both his
feet. Then those above hoisted this human elevator until it could
find secure footing for itself and its passenger among the branches
above.</p>

<p>In like manner, I was hoisted into the tree, where, thereafter,
the climbing was easy.</p>

<p>We ascended only a few feet, however, before we came to a rude
platform upon which was built one of the strange, arboreal houses
of the Masenas.</p>

<p>Now, in all directions, I could see similar houses as far as my
eyes could penetrate through the foliage. I could see that in some
places branches had been cut and laid from tree to tree to form
walk-ways between the houses. In other places there were only
lianas where the Masenas must have crossed hand over hand from one
tree to its neighbor.</p>

<p>The house into which we were now conducted was quite large and
easily accommodated not only the twenty-odd men that had captured
us but fully fifty more that soon congregated.</p>

<p>The Masenas squatted upon their haunches facing the far end of
the room where sat, alone, a single male that I took to be their
king.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of meowing and purring as they discussed
us in their language, and finally I became impatient. Recalling
that Umka had spoken the language of the Tarids, I thought it not
at all unlikely that some of these others might; and so I addressed
them in that tongue.</p>

<p>"Why have you captured us?" I demanded. "We are not your
enemies. We were escaping from the Tarids, who are. They had us
imprisoned and were about to kill us. Do any of you understand what
I am saying?"</p>

<p>"I understand you," replied the creature whom I took to be king.
"I understand your words, but your argument is meaningless. When we
leave our houses and go down into the forest we may mean harm to no
creature, yet that does not protect us from the beasts of prey that
feed upon the flesh of their kill. There are few arguments that
would satisfactorily overcome the cravings of the belly."</p>

<p>"You mean that you are going to eat us?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied.</p>

<p>Ozara shrank closer to me. "So this is the end," she said, "and
what a horrible end! It did us no good to escape from Ul Vas."</p>

<p>"We have at least had three days of freedom that we would not
otherwise have had," I reminded her; "and, anyway, we must die some
time."</p>

<p>The Masena king spoke to his people in their own tongue, and
immediately they set up a great meowing and purring, as, with
savage growls, a number of them seized Ozara and me and started to
drag us toward the entrance.</p>

<p>They had almost reached the doorway with us when a lone Masena
entered and paused before us.</p>

<p>"Umka!" I cried.</p>

<p>"John Carter!" he exclaimed. "What are you doing here, and the
Jeddara of the Tarids?"</p>

<p>"We escaped from Ul Vas, and now we are about to be eaten by
your people," I told him.</p>

<p>Umka spoke to the men who were dragging us from the room; they
hesitated a moment; and then they led us back before the Masena
king, whom Umka addressed for several minutes.</p>

<p>After he had ceased, the king and others in the room carried on
what appeared to be a heated discussion. When they had finished,
Umka turned toward me.</p>

<p>"You are to be set free," he said, "in return for what you did
for me; but you must leave our country at once."</p>

<p>"Nothing would suit us better," I replied.</p>

<p>"Some of us are going with you to see that none of our people
attack you while you are still in the land of the Masenas."</p>

<p>After we had set out with our strange escort, I asked Umka to
tell me what he knew of my friends.</p>

<p>"After we left the castle of the Tarids," he explained, "we
drifted around idly in the air for a long time. They wanted to
follow the man who had taken the woman away in the other ship, but
they did not know where to search. Today I looked down and saw that
we were over Masena, and I asked them to put me on the ground. This
they did, and they are still there for all I know, as they were
taking fresh water aboard and were going to gather fruits and hunt
for meat."</p>

<p>It developed that the landing had been made at no great distance
from where we then were, and at my request he led us to the
spot.</p>

<p>As we approached it, the hearts of two of that party almost
stopped beating, so great was the suspense. It quite easily might
mean the difference between life and death for Ozara and me.</p>

<p>And then we saw it, the strange craft, lying in a little
clearing among the trees.</p>

<p>Umka thought it best that he and his fellows should not approach
the craft, as he might not be able to restrain them in the presence
of these others whom they had not promised to protect; so we
thanked him and bade him good-bye, and he and his weird companions
melted into the forest.</p>

<p>None of the three on the ship had noticed our approach, and we
were quite close to her before they discovered us. They greeted us
enthusiastically as two returned from the dead. Even Ur Jan was
genuinely pleased to see me.</p>

<p>The assassin of Zodanga was furious with Gar Nal because he had
broken his oath; and now, to my astonishment, the fellow threw his
sword at my feet and swore eternal fealty to me.</p>

<p>"Never in my life," he said, "have I fought shoulder to shoulder
with such a swordsman, and never shall it be said that I have drawn
sword against him."</p>

<p>I accepted his service, and then I asked them how they had been
able to maneuver the ship to this point.</p>

<p>"Zanda was the only one who knew anything about the mechanism or
its control," explained Jat Or; "and after a little experimenting,
she found that she could operate it." He looked proudly at her, and
I read much in the smile that passed between them.</p>

<p>"You seem none the worse off for your experiences, Zanda," I
said; "in fact, you appear very happy."</p>

<p>"I am very happy, <i>Vandor</i>," she replied, "happier than I
ever expected to be in my life."</p>

<p>She emphasized the word Vandor, and I thought that I detected a
smile lurking deep in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Is your happiness so great," I asked, "that it has caused you
to forget your vow to kill John Carter?"</p>

<p>She returned my bantering smile as she replied. "I do not know
anyone by the name of John Carter."</p>

<p>Jat Or and Ur Jan were laughing but I could see that Ozara did
not know what it was all about.</p>

<p>"I hope for his sake that you never meet him, Zanda," I said,
"for I am rather fond of him, and I should hate to see him
killed."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I should hate to kill him, for I know now that
he is the bravest man and the truest friend in the world&mdash;with
possibly one exception," she added, with a sly glance at Jat
Or.</p>

<p>We discussed our situation at length, and tried to make plans
for the future, and at last we decided to act upon Ozara's
suggestion that we go to Domnia and enlist the aid of her father.
From there, she thought, we might more easily conduct the search
for Gar Nal and Dejah Thoris.</p>

<p>I shall not take up your time with an account of our journey to
Ozara's country or of the welcome that we received at the hands of
her father and the strange sights that we saw in this Thurian
city.</p>

<p>Ozara's father is the jeddak of Domnia. He is a powerful man,
with political affiliations in other cities of the nearer moon. His
agents are everywhere among the peoples with whom his country has
relations, either amicable or otherwise; and it was not long before
word reached him that a strange object that floated in the air had
become disabled and had been captured in the country of Ombra. In
it were a man and a woman.</p>

<p>The Domnians gave us explicit directions for reaching Ombra;
and, exacting a promise from us that we would return and visit them
after the conclusion of our adventure, they bid us good- bye.</p>

<p>My parting with Ozara was rather painful. She told me quite
frankly that she loved me, but that she was resigned to the fact
that my heart belonged to another. She exhibited splendid strength
of character then that I had not believed she possessed, and when
she bid me farewell it was with the wish that I find my princess
and enjoy the happiness that I deserved.</p>

<p>As our ship rose above Domnia, my heart was full with a sense of
elation, so great was my assurance that I should soon be united
with the incomparable Dejah Thoris. I was thus certain of success
because of what Ozara's father had told me of the character of the
Jeddak of Ombra. He was an arrant coward, and almost any sort of a
demonstration would bring him to his knees suing for peace.</p>

<p>Now we were in a position to make a demonstration such as the
Ombrans had never witnessed; for, in common with the other
inhabitants of Thuria that we had seen thus far, they were entirely
ignorant of firearms.</p>

<p>It was my intention to fly low and make my demands for the
return of Dejah Thoris and Gar Nal to me, without putting myself in
the power of the Ombrans.</p>

<p>If they refused, which I was quite certain that they would, I
intended giving them a demonstration of the effectiveness of the
firearms of Barsoom through the medium of the ship's guns that I
have already described. That, I was confident, would bring the
Jeddak to terms; and I hoped to accomplish it without unnecessary
loss of life.</p>

<p>We were all quite gay as we sailed off toward Ombra. Jat Or and
Zanda were planning upon the home they expected to establish in
Helium, and Ur Jan was anticipating a position among the fighting
men of my retinue and a life of honor and respectability.</p>

<p>Presently, Zanda called my attention to the fact that we were
gaining considerable altitude, and complained of dizziness. Almost
at the same time I felt a weakness stealing over me, and
simultaneously Ur Jan collapsed.</p>

<p>Followed by Jat Or, I staggered to the control room, where a
glance at the altimeter showed me that we had risen to dangerous
heights. Instantly I directed the brain to regulate the oxygen
supply in the interior of the ship, and then I directed it to drop
nearer to the surface of the satellite.</p>

<p>It obeyed my directions insofar as the oxygen supply was
concerned, but it continued to rise past the point where the
altimeter could register our height.</p>

<p>As Thuria faded in the distance astern, I realized that we were
flying at tremendous speed, a speed far in excess of that which I
had directed.</p>

<p>It was evident that the brain was entirely out of control. There
was nothing more that I could do; so I returned to the cabin. Here
I found that both Zanda and Ur Jan had recovered, now that the
oxygen supply had been replenished.</p>

<p>I told them that the ship was running wild in space and that our
eventual fate could be nothing more than a matter of idle
speculation&mdash;they knew as much about it as I.</p>

<p>My hopes, that had been so high, were now completely dashed; and
the farther that we sped from Thuria, the greater became my
anguish, though I hid my personal feelings from my companions.</p>

<p>It was not until it became apparent that we were headed for
Barsoom that even hope of life was renewed in the breasts of any of
us.</p>

<p>As we drew near the surface of the planet, it became evident to
me that the ship was fully under control; and I wondered whether or
not the brain itself had discovered the power of original thought,
for I knew that I was not controlling it nor were any of my
companions.</p>

<p>It was night, a very dark night. The ship was approaching a
large city. I could see the lights ahead, and as we drew closer I
recognized that the city was Zodanga.</p>

<p>As though guided by a human hand and brain, the ship slid
silently across the eastern wall of the great city, dropped into
the shadows of a dark avenue, and moved steadily toward its unknown
destination.</p>

<p>But not for long was the destination to be unknown. Presently
the neighborhood became familiar. We were moving very slowly. Zanda
was with me in the control room, gazing through one of the forward
ports.</p>

<p>"The house of Fal Sivas!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>I recognized it, too, and then just in front of us I saw the
open doors of the great hangar from which I had stolen the
ship.</p>

<p>With the utmost precision, the ship turned slowly about until
its tail pointed toward the hangar doorway. Then it backed in and
settled down upon its scaffolding.</p>

<p>At my direction, the doors opened and the ladder dropped out to
the floor; and a moment later I was searching for Fal Sivas, to
demand an explanation. Ur Jan and Jat Or accompanied me with drawn
swords, and Zanda followed close behind.</p>

<p>I went at once to Fal Sivas's sleeping quarters. They were
deserted; but as I was leaving them, I saw a note fastened beside
the door. It was addressed to me.</p>

<p>I opened it and read the following:</p>
<br>

<p class="letter">From Fal Sivas<br>
Of Zodanga</p>

<p class="letter">To John Carter<br>
Of Helium</p>

<p class="letter">Let this be known:</p>

<p class="letter">You betrayed me. You stole my ship. You thought
that your puny mind could best that of the great Fal Sivas.</p>

<p class="letter">Very well, John Carter, it shall be a duel of
minds&mdash;my mind against yours. Let us see who will win.</p>

<p class="letter">I am recalling the ship.</p>

<p class="letter">I am directing it to return from wherever it may
be and at full speed. It is to allow no other brain to change its
course. I am commanding it to return to its hangar and remain there
forever unless it receives contrary directions from my brain.</p>

<p class="letter">Know you then, John Carter, when you read this
note, that I, Fal Sivas, have won; and that as long as I live, no
other brain than mine can ever cause my ship to move.</p>

<p class="letter">I might have dashed the ship to pieces against
the ground and thus destroyed you; but then I could not have
gloated over you, as I now shall.</p>

<p class="letter">Do not search for me. I am hidden where you can
never find me.</p>

<p class="letter">I have written. That is all.</p>
<br>

<p>There was a grim finality about that note and a certain
authority that seemed to preclude even faint hope. I was
crushed.</p>

<p>In silence, I handed it to Jat Or and asked him to read it aloud
to the others. When he had finished it, Ur Jan drew his short sword
and offered it to me hilt first.</p>

<p>"It is I who am the cause of your sorrow," he said. "My life
belongs to you. I offer it to you now in atonement."</p>

<p>I shook my head and pushed his hand away. "You did not know what
you were doing, Ur Jan," I said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is not the end," said Zanda. "Where can Fal Sivas
hide that determined men may not find him?"</p>

<p>"Let us dedicate our lives to that purpose," said Jat Or; and
there, in the quarters of Fal Sivas, we four swore to hunt him
down.</p>

<p>As we stepped out into the corridor, I saw a man approaching. He
was tiptoeing stealthily in our direction. He did not see me
instantly because he was casting an apprehensive glance back across
his shoulder, as though fearful of discovery from that
direction.</p>

<p>When he faced me, we were both surprised&mdash;it was Rapas the
Ulsio.</p>

<p>At sight of Ur Jan and me standing side by side, The Rat went
ashen grey. He started to turn, as though to run; but evidently he
thought better of it, for he immediately faced us again, and stood
staring at us as though fascinated.</p>

<p>As we approached him, he affected a silly grin. "Well, Vandor,"
he said, "this is a surprise. I am glad to see you."</p>

<p>"Yes, you must be," I replied. "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>"I came to see Fal Sivas."</p>

<p>"Did you expect to find him here?" demanded Ur Jan.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Rapas.</p>

<p>"Then why were you sneaking in on your tiptoes?" inquired the
assassin. "You are lying, Rapas. You knew that Fal Sivas was not
here. If you had thought that he was here, you would not have had
the nerve to come, for you knew that he knew that you were in my
employ."</p>

<p>Ur Jan stepped forward quickly and grasped Rapas by the throat.
"Listen, you rat," he growled; "you know where Fal Sivas is. Tell
me, or I'll wring your neck."</p>

<p>The fellow commenced to grovel and whine.</p>

<p>"Don't, don't; you are hurting me," he cried. "You will kill
me."</p>

<p>"At least you have told the truth for once," growled the
assassin. "Quick now; out with it. Where is Fal Sivas?"</p>

<p>"If I tell you, will you promise not to kill me?" asked The
Rat.</p>

<p>"We will promise you that and more," I said; "Tel us where Fal
Sivas is, and I'll give you your weight in treasure."</p>

<p>"Speak up," said Ur Jan, giving the fellow a shake.</p>

<p>"Fal Sivas is in the house of Gar Nal," whispered Rapas, "but
don't tell him that I told you; don't tell him that I told you or
he will kill me horribly."</p>

<p>I did not dare turn Rapas loose for fear he would betray us, and
furthermore he promised to gain entrance to Gar Nal's for us and
lead us to the room where we would find Fal Sivas.</p>

<p>I could not imagine what Fal Sivas was doing in the house of Gar
Nal, unless he had gone there in Gar Nal's absence in an attempt to
steal some of his secrets; nor did I bother to question Rapas about
it, as it did not seem of any great importance to me. It was enough
that Fal Sivas was there, and that I should find him.</p>

<p>It was half after the eighth zode, or around midnight earth-
time, that we reached Gar Nal's. Rapas admitted us and led us to
the third level of the house, up narrow ramps at the rear of the
building where we met no one. We moved silently without speaking,
and at last our guide halted before a door.</p>

<p>"He is in there," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Open the door," I said.</p>

<p>He tried it, but it was locked. Ur Jan pushed him aside, and
then hurled his great bulk against the door. With a loud
splintering of wood, it burst in. I leaped across the threshold;
and there, seated at a table, I saw Fal Sivas and Gar Nal&mdash;Gar
Nal, the man whom I had thought to be imprisoned in the city of
Ombra on the nearer moon.</p>

<p>As the two men recognized Ur Jan and me, they leaped to their
feet; their evil faces were studies in surprise and terror.</p>

<p>I sprang forward and seized Gar Nal before he could draw his
sword, and Ur Jan fell upon Fal Sivas. He would have killed him
offhand, but I forbade it. All that I wanted was to learn the fate
of Dejah Thoris, and one of these men must know the truth
concerning her. They must not die until I knew.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, Gar Nal?" I demanded. "I thought that
you were a prisoner in Ombra."</p>

<p>"I escaped," he replied.</p>

<p>"Do you know where my princess is?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>A cunning look entered his eyes. "You would like to know,
wouldn't you?" he asked with a sneer; "but do you think Gar Nal is
fool enough to tell you? No, as long as I know and you don't, you
will not dare to kill me."</p>

<p>"I'll get the truth out of him," growled Ur Jan. "Here, Rapas,
heat a dagger for me. Heat it red-hot." But when we looked around,
Rapas was not there. As we had entered the room, he had made good
his escape.</p>

<p>"Well," said Ur Jan, "I can heat it myself; but first let me
kill Fal Sivas."</p>

<p>"No, no," screamed the old inventor. "I did not steal the
Princess of Helium; it was Gar Nal."</p>

<p>And then the two commenced to accuse one another, and presently
I discovered that after Gar Nal's return from Thuria, these two
master inventors and great scoundrels had patched up a truce and
joined forces because of their mutual fear of me. Gar Nal was to
hide Fal Sivas, and in return Fal Sivas was to show him the secret
of his mechanical brain.</p>

<p>They had both been certain that the last place in the world that
I would look for Fal Sivas would be in the house of Gar Nal. Gar
Nal had instructed his servants to say that he had never returned
from his trip with Ur Jan, giving the impression that he was still
upon Thuria; and he was planning to leave that very night for a
distant hiding-place.</p>

<p>But all this annoyed me. I did not care about them, or their
plans. I wanted to know but one thing, and that was the fate of
Dejah Thoris.</p>

<p>"Where is my princess, Gar Nal?" I demanded; "tell me that, and
I will spare your life."</p>

<p>"She is still in Ombra," he replied.</p>

<p>Then I turned upon Fal Sivas. "That is your death warrant, Fal
Sivas," I told him.</p>

<p>"Why?" he demanded. "What have I to do with it?"</p>

<p>"You keep me from directing the brain that operates your ship,
and only thus may I reach Ombra."</p>

<p>Ur Jan raised his sword to cleave Fal Sivas's skull, but the
coward went down upon his knees and begged for his life.</p>

<p>"Spare me," he cried, "and I will turn the ship over to you and
let you control the brain."</p>

<p>"I can't trust you," I said.</p>

<p>"You can take me with you," he pleaded; "that will be better
than death."</p>

<p>"Very well," I said; "but if you interfere with my plans or
attempt to betray me, you shall pay for your treachery with your
life."</p>

<p>I turned toward the door. "I am returning to Thuria tonight," I
said to my companions. "I shall take Fal Sivas with me, and when I
return with my princess (and I shall not return without her), I
hope to be able to reward you in some material way for your
splendid loyalty."</p>

<p>"I am going with you, my prince," said Jat Or; "and I ask for no
reward."</p>

<p>"And I, too, am going," said Zanda.</p>

<p>"And I," growled Ur Jan, "but first, my prince, please let me
run my sword through the heart of this scoundrel," and as he spoke
he advanced upon Gar Nal. "He should die for what he has done. He
gave you his word, and he broke it."</p>

<p>I shook my head. "No," I said. "He told me where I could find my
princess; and in return for that, I have guaranteed his
safety."</p>

<p>Grumbling, Ur Jan returned his sword to its scabbard; and then
we four, with Fal Sivas, moved toward the door. The others preceded
me. I was the last to pass out into the corridor; and just as I did
so, I heard a door open at the opposite end of the room we were
just leaving. I turned to glance back; and there, in the doorway
across the room, stood Dejah Thoris.</p>

<p>She came toward me with arms outstretched as I ran to meet
her.</p>

<p>She was breathing very hard and trembling as I took her in my
arms. "Oh, my prince," she cried, "I thought I should not be in
time. I heard all that was said in this room, but I was bound and
gagged and could not warn you that Gar Nal was deceiving you. It
was only just this instant that I succeeded in freeing myself."</p>

<p>My exclamation of surprise when I first saw her had attracted
the attention of my companions, and they had all returned to the
room; and as I held my princess in my arms, Ur Jan leaped past me
and ran his sword through the putrid heart of Gar Nal.</p>
