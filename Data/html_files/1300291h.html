<h3>INTRODUCTION.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Originally the initial footnote.]</p>
<p>The accounts of the colony (many of them written by private
individuals to their friends in England), which appeared from
time to time in the newspapers and magazines of one hundred years
ago [the present work was published in 1893], contained, in very
many cases, information for which we look in vain in the official
despatches of the Governor or his subordinates. For this reason,
and also because they are now practically beyond the reach of the
ordinary reader, they have been reprinted; and inasmuch as they
are not, in the strict sense of the word, original records, they
have been grouped together in the order of their dates, and are
published as an Appendix [<i>this</i> Appendix E].</p>

<h3>CRIME IN THE YEAR 1785.**</h3>
<p class="source">[** Reprinted from the <i>Hibernian
Journal</i>, Dublin, 21st December, 1785.]</p>
<p><small>NOTWITHSTANDING</small> the enormous number of
transports lately sent from our prisons&mdash;we are sorry to
find that such are the depravities daily experienced among
us&mdash;the ensuing month will probably exhibit as sanguinary
spectacles of irritated justice as hitherto known. Our jails are
crowded with felons, and every day continues to crowd them.
Crimes tread on the heels of crimes, and human enormity seems at
its highest. Not only in the city, but in the country, are
murders and rapine evinced, and such will be always the case if
we substitute not some mode of punishment beside death; for
eternity has lost its terrors with guilt, and hard labour is more
alarming than an offended deity.</p>

<h3>CRIME IN THE YEAR 1786.***</h3>
<p class="source">[*** Reprinted from the <i>Edinburgh
Magazine</i>, March, 1786.]</p>
<p><small>THE</small> Sheriffs of London, accompanied by the City
Remembrancer, attended the lev&eacute;e at St. James's, and
presented the felons petition to his Majesty.</p>
<p align="center">"To the King's Most Excellent Majesty.</p>
<p>"The humble petition of the Court of Lord Mayor and Aldermen
of the City of London,&mdash;</p>
<p>"Sheweth,&mdash;</p>
<p>"That your petitioners, the magistrates for the City of
London, have had an opportunity of observing, with the most
heartfelt concern, the rapid and alarming increase of crimes and
depredations in this city and its neighbourhood, especially
within the last three years.</p>
<p>"The fact of such increase is too publicly known and too
severely felt by your Majesty's subjects to be doubted; and if
any direct proof of it were wanting, it will most evidently
appear from the number of days employed in the trial of felons at
the Old Bailey, which, upon an average of the last three years,
have been upwards of fifty-five in the year, whereas the highest
average of any three years prior to the year 1776 was less than
forty-five, and the general average of twenty years prior to that
period less than thirty-four days in the year.</p>
<p>"That the increase of the crime of burglary is become most
alarming to your Majesty's subjects, which increase your
petitioners are inclined to ascribe to the great number of
experienced and well-practised thieves in the kingdom, who commit
this atrocious crime with such art that scarce any precautions
are sufficient to guard against it. And the same experience that
enables these offenders to perpetrate this offence with ease has
probably convinced them that it is attended with less personal
danger and hazard of detection than most other offences.</p>
<p>"That in the years from January, 1766, to December, 1775, both
inclusive (which time immediately preceded the stop that was put
to transportation), above three thousand one hundred persons were
transported from London and Middlesex alone; and having reason to
believe that all the rest of the kingdom have furnished an equal
number, the whole amount of the transports in these ten years
have been above six thousand. That the number of prisoners tried
and convicted of felony in the ten succeeding years, from the
beginning of 1776 to 1786, having greatly increased, there is
every reason to believe that if the executive justice had
remained the same the transports in those years would have much
exceeded the number of the ten preceding; but the regular course
of transportation having been interrupted during that period, and
few opportunities found by Government of sending convicts
abroad&mdash;and those only in small numbers&mdash;your
petitioners humbly submit to your Majesty that it necessarily
follows that after making an allowance for the small number sent
abroad, and for the convicts who may have died during that
period, there must now remain within the kingdom, either at large
or in the different prisons, at least four thousand persons who,
in the judgment of the law, were proper to have been sent out of
it.</p>
<p>"That your petitioners humbly conceive that this dreadful
accumulation is alone sufficient to account for all the evils
that are so heavily felt and so justly complained of, both as to
the overcrowded state of the gaols and the increase of crimes and
of offenders.</p>
<p>"To what extent the mischiefs that are so severely felt
already, and the fatal consequences so justly apprehended, may be
carried by a longer continuance of so rapid and alarming an
accumulation of convicts within the kingdom, no human wisdom can
foresee.</p>
<p>"When facts so important as these, and which so materially
affect the peace and security of your Majesty's subjects in
general, and especially of this great city, have come within the
knowledge of your petitioners, they would ill discharge their
duty to your Majesty, or the public, if they neglected most
humbly to lay them at the foot of the Throne, earnestly
beseeching your Majesty to direct such measures to be taken, as
to your Royal wisdom shall seem best, for providing a speedy and
due execution of the law, both as to capital punishment and
transportation; without which all other regulations must prove
nugatory and abortive, and the mischiefs complained of must daily
and rapidly increase."</p>

<h3>DUTCH CLAIMS TO AUSTRALIA.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Dublin Evening
Herald</i> of 30th October, 1786.]</p>
<p><small>AN</small> opposition to the intended settlement of
Botany Bay has been lately started from a quarter from which it
was little expected. The Dutch have always claimed the
sovereignty of it by the right of discovery, a right which has
been greatly respected by the different powers of Europe; and we
are credibly informed that his Excellency the Baron de Leyder,
the Dutch ambassador to our Court, has received orders to
remonstrate with our Ministers, in the name of the
States-General, against our regular planting of a territory which
they assert belongs to another country.</p>

<h3>ENGLISH OPINION ON THE PROJECTED COLONY.**</h3>
<p class="source">[** Reprinted from the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i> of November, 1786.]</p>
<p align="right">5th November, 1786.   </p>
<p>Mr. Urban,</p>
<p>While the plan for settling a colony at Botany Bay is
preparing to be carried into execution, the more objections that
are made to it the better. Government will, by that means, be
enabled to obviate them; to provide for every known want and
supposed danger.</p>
<p>You have observed that the eastern coast of New Holland is the
least-inhabited and worst-cultivated country in the Southern
Hemisphere. To this it has been answered that the want of
cultivation is no proof of the barrenness of the soil, nor the
deficiency of inhabitants a reason why the natural productions of
the climate should not be sufficient for the support of a greater
number; and, as an argument in favor of this assertion, the
account that Lieut. Cook gives of Botany Bay is everywhere cited
as an authority by those who, perhaps, never read his Voyage.</p>
<p>[The writer quotes from Cook's Journals to show the dangerous
character of the natives there. He then remarks]:&mdash;</p>
<p>The inference I mean to draw from this narrative is this:
<i>That much blood must be spilt before a colony among these
savages can be established;</i> and that it will be in vain to
depend on the grain to be raised among them, as most certainly,
till they are subdued, they will destroy it by fraud or
force.</p>

<h3>REPLY TO FOREGOING.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i> of December, 1786.]</p>
<p align="right">Shadwell, 4th December, 1786.   </p>
<p>Mr. Urban,</p>
<p>Presuming that your useful miscellany is circulated for
information, and not disputation (at least disputation with
acrimony), I am induced to reply to your correspondent H.D., who
modestly says objections should be made (for a very commendable
purpose) that they may be removed; and, as the latter part of his
letter, more particularly distinguished by italics, claims the
attention of your readers, I shall just say that it has certainly
been the intention of Government to obviate every difficulty, and
to render everything as permanently comfortable to the unhappy
convicts as the nature of the case will admit. I advance this
general testimony upon the presumption of those particulars which
I have been an eye-witness to, and which are a strict and marked
attention to their well-being by the respective officers under
the Navy Board, both as to ships, provisions, and every necessary
that they may stand in need of. To enumerate particulars would be
needless; even trifles have been thought of. And when I compare
the manner in which they are provided for in their voyage with
the mode that used to be adopted, I hesitate not to assert that
Government have paid a minute attention to them. One instance as
a proof&mdash;they have now comfortable beds. Formerly, when the
convicts were transported by contract to America, there were no
beds. Government paid a certain sum, and the contractor took
[care] that "no luxuries were allowed."</p>
<p>That the best digested plans are capable of improvements there
can be no doubt; but in this, at present, I think none can be
pointed out. A general negative on the undertaking is no argument
why it should not be, unless a plan on better principles can be
advanced. Besides, can it be supposed for a moment that these men
are to encounter with no difficulty? Do they deserve to meet with
no difficulties? Are they to be treated by the mother country (I
speak of them as an infant colony) as dutiful children? What
shall I say? Let me turn your thoughts to the Loyalists that have
lately emigrated from their improved estates, after perhaps a
life of industry and honour&mdash;after leaving their dead
friends and relatives on the spot, who fell in defence of the
laws of the parent State (not transgressors against those laws).
Look at them; see them encounter the difficulties of an
inhospitable shore. See them in latitudes to which their
constitutions were strangers, struggling to begin the world
afresh. Revolve immediately in your mind the mild climate of
34&deg;, the very name of the spot the convicts are going to, the
characters of the first visitors (I mean of our countrymen
lately), who declare it favorable to vegetation and agriculture,
and say if the delinquents are not bountifully provided for. How
long have the American Indians been peaceful? Have not all new
settlers difficulties to encounter with? Now, admitting for a
moment, sir, that "there must be blood spilt," is it not better
that even half die in battle who are doomed to a halter than that
the whole should be hanged. But this is only a momentary
supposition.</p>
<p>As I have quoted the Loyalists (men, by-the-bye, that bear no
comparison but in the name of new settlers), how are they
situated now? Under a mild government, raising populous towns,
carrying on extensive commerce, even to the envy of their
neighbours. May we not hope that the spirit of reformation may
take place, and under the fostering care of a generous and
forgiving nation, this colony may one day flourish and be
respectable, as no incentives to their natural propensities will
remain by their vicinity to a large capital or populous cities,
or to the luxuries of life? It is a possible presumption that it
may be.</p>

<h3>EQUIPMENT OF THE FIRST FLEET.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Dublin Evening
Herald</i> of 4th December, 1786.]</p>
<p><small>THURSDAY</small> an entry was made of a very large
quantity of stores for the supply of the colony intended to be
established at Botany Bay. Amongst other articles were thirteen
tons weight of slop clothing, furnished by Mr. James Wadham; half
a ton weight of woollen stockings, by Mr. John Yerbury; two tons
weight and a-half of shoes, by Mr. Wm. Goodman; half a ton weight
of stockings, by Mr. Pope; and one ton weight of hats, by Mess.

<h3>GOVERNOR PHILLIP.**</h3>
<p class="source">[** Reprinted from <i>The World</i> of 8th
January, 1787.]</p>
<p><small>CAPTAIN PHILLIP</small>, the officer who is to have the
conduct of the ladies and gentlemen to Botany Bay, is very highly
spoken of as a man of knowledge and intrepidity in the naval
world. He has been in the Portuguese service, and from his
different expeditions is said to be well informed on the subject
of forming settlements.</p>

<h3>THE DETACHMENT OF MARINES.***</h3>
<p class="source">[*** Reprinted from the <i>Public
Advertiser</i> of 12th January, 1787.]</p>
<p><small>TUESDAY</small> a party of the soldiers who were
drafted from the Guards to go to Botany Bay set out for
Portsmouth, where they are to embark with other soldiers who are
to guard the convicts. They are allowed additional pay for their
service, and clothing suitable to the climate. They are to
continue there five years, then to be relieved by other troops
from England, and return home.</p>
<p>A correspondent assures us that the female convicts in Newgate
are to be sent with the first vessels to Botany Bay, but that the
male convicts in the same jail and the other jails in the
metropolis are to be sent to Africa. The convicts in the county
jails are, however, to be sent to Botany Bay. The policy of this
distinction is obvious&mdash;the country convicts are supposed to
be fittest for agriculture, &amp;c.; while the villains of London
are thought to be most proper to be sent to Africa.</p>

<h3>GOVERNOR PHILLIP AND THE CONVICTS.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Public Advertiser</i>
of 29th March, 1787.]</p>
<p><small>GOVERNOR PHILLIP</small> is still in town, and it is
supposed his sailing with the fleet to Botany Bay will be
postponed till after Lord George Gordon's trial on the second
libel he is charged with by the Attorney-General. With respect to
the felony laws and executions, the Act of Parliament lately
passed for the government of the felons convict, when they arrive
at their destination, gives powers unknown to the practice in the
courts of law in England, but puts them nearly on a footing with
the loyal subjects in India under the new Board of Controul.</p>

<p align="center"><b><small>LETTER</small> from an Officer on
board the Scarborough, transport.**</b></p>
<p class="source">[** Reprinted from the <i>Dublin Evening
Herald</i> of Friday, 6th June, 1788.]</p>
<p align="right">Table Bay, November, 1787.   </p>
<p><small>WE</small> left Rio Janeiro the 4th of August, 1787.
Nothing material happened until the 19th, when a convict fell
overboard from the Charlotte, transport, and in despight of every
effort to save him was drowned. From that time to the 25th we had
bad weather, rain, and heavy lightning. On the 3rd of September
we discovered an intent among the seamen of our ship to mutiny,
but by the timely exertions of our Commodore and officers the
ringleader was punished, and we were happily relieved from
danger. At this time the Charlotte had thirty sick, and the rest
of the ships' crews, marines, and convicts had many ill; but by
the blessing of God, soon after, the weather clearing up, the
sick were sent upon deck, which method, with the cleanliness
preserved throughout the fleet, proved restorative; health was
reinstated among us, and we prosecuted our voyage in high
spirits. About this time some female convicts on board different
ships increased the number of souls by an addition of seven
children. Our doctor baptized them on an appointed day, and the
weather being exceeding fine, the christenings were kept on board
the respective ships with great glee, an additional allowance of
grog being distributed to the crews of those ships where births
took place.</p>
<p>On the 7th of October, the Alexander, transport, threw out
three signals of distress, upon which the Commodore ordered our
boats to be manned and sent on board. The captain of the
Alexander informed the commanding officer that his men had
mutinied, and attempted to release the convicts, in order to
strengthen themselves; but our well-timed assistance prevented
those desperadoes from effecting their evil intention. Our people
secured four of the most daring and sent them in irons on board
the Siris [Sirius]. The principal part of the marines on board
the Alexander being ill, and therefore unable to prevent any
attempt they might make after our departure, the next day the
Alexander sent two convicts on board our ship, they having been
very disorderly the preceding night.</p>
<p>On the 12th of October, to our great joy, we made Table Bay,
and our Commodore having ordered the signal to be thrown out for
all the ships to come into his wake, the captains received their
instructions for the disposition in which the fleet was entered
and moored.</p>
<p>They immediately hoisted their colours, saluting the Commodore
as they passed by, sailing into the bay. Joy now beamed in every
countenance, and we congratulated each other on the pleasing
prospect of plenty of fresh provisions, with abundance of herbs,
roots, and fruits, the production of this fine country. Judge,
then, after a run of 1,094 leagues, our happiness at the pleasing
scene before our eyes.</p>
<p>In passing into the bay our satisfaction was allayed by the
loss of the second mate of the Friendship, a worthy character and
a good seaman; he fell overboard and perished.</p>
<p>On the 1st of November one of the Lady Penrhyn's women, a
convict, fell overboard, but was saved by our boat. The next day
we had the further satisfaction of preserving some Dutch seamen
belonging to an East Indiaman, whose boat had overset in a gust
of wind and was lost.</p>
<p>Our worthy Commodore and our Agent, to whom the greatest
praise is due for their humanity and attention, have given public
notice to the masters of the different ships to hold themselves
in readiness to receive sailing instructions on the 10th of
December, as it is intended to quit the Cape of Good Hope on the
11th day of December.</p>
<p>We have plentiful provision of live stock and other
necessaries for the new settlement, an enumeration of which I
here subjoin, viz., 3 bulls, 10 cows, 3 stone-horses, 12 mares,
220 rams and ewes, 4 male and 20 female goats, 80 dozen fowls, 20
dozen ducks, 6 dozen of geese, and 4 dozen of turkies, corn,
wheat, flour, garden seeds, spirits, and other necessaries,
independant of the live stock, to the amount of
2,000<i>l</i>.</p>
<p>Whilst we remain here every person is allowed one pound and
a-half of meat, one pound and a-half of bread, and one gallon of
beer per diem; and I can assure you our agent has purchased
plenty of belly timber for the remainder of the voyage.</p>
<p>The only place proposed to stop at between the Cape and Botany
Bay is the Island of Desolation, so called from its being a rock
on which no herbage grows, in the centre of which rock is a
beautiful lake of fresh water, a supply of which will be
necessary to preserve our live stock. This island was discovered
by Captain Cook, and, of course, named by that gallant
commander.* It has but one port, called Christmas Harbour, so
called from being discovered and entered into on that day.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Vol. i, part 1, p. 369 (note).]</p>
<p>To be brief, our fleet will be in good repair; our seamen,
soldiers, and convicts are in high spirits. The provision made by
Government has filled the hearts of the new settlers with
gratitude, and now has reconciled them to their fate. The more
rational part of them are convinced that on their arrival at
Botany Bay, by industry and attention, they will enjoy all the
requisites reasonable beings can desire; that the disgrace they
suffered in England, due to their crime, will by good behaviour
at Botany Bay be buried in oblivion; that, removed from their
wicked companions at London, they will have no seducing
opportunities to swerve from the cause of virtue; and that in all
probability they may be the founders of an empire greater than
that from which they are banished.</p>

<h3>THE PENAL CODE IN 1788.**</h3>
<p class="source">[** Reprinted from the <i>Hibernian Journal</i>
of 30th April, 1788.]</p>
<p>As many of the common people may be inclined to cut down and
carry away timber-trees from gentlemen's inclosures for the
purpose of May-bushes, we think it our duty to warn them of the
danger of such depredations, which were always liable to the
penalty of fine or whipping, but are now transportation by a late
Act of Parliament. Such inconsiderate people should reflect that
a silly drunken dance round a May-pole or bush is scarce worth
the chance of taking a nine months' voyage to New Holland, and
spending their lives in constant hard labour at Botany Bay.</p>

<h3>LETTER FROM AN OFFICER AT SYDNEY.***</h3>
<p class="source">[*** Reprinted from the <i>Morning Post and
Daily Advertiser</i> of 23rd April, 1789.]</p>
<p class="blok">[<i>Note by the Editor</i>:&mdash;The following
authentic letter from Botany Bay comes from a very intelligent
gentleman at that quarter, on whose veracity we have so perfect a
dependence that, though this account of the place differs from
most others, we can confidently deliver it to our readers as a
representation on which they may rely:]****</p>
<p class="foot">[**** The sentiments of the writer are those of
Major Ross; the language in some places bears a remarkable
resemblance to the letter of 18th November, 1788 (Vol. i, part 2,
p. 221), which is also anonymous. In other places, particularly
where reference is made to native gums, the expressions are
almost identical with those used by Assistant-Surgeon Considen in
his letter to Sir Joseph Banks of 18th November, 1788 (ib., p.

<p align="right">Sydney Cove, 12th July, 1788.   </p>
<p>My Dear Friend,</p>
<p>I did myself the pleasure to write to you from the Cape of
Good Hope on the 17th of November last, and not doubting but that
you received my letter in due time, I shall not repeat what I
then said to you. I will endeavour now to give you a short sketch
of our passage from the Cape to Botany Bay, and from thence to
our present residence, and of the country round us, &amp;c.</p>
<p>As far as I can recollect, we sailed from the Cape of Good
Hope on the 20th of November, 1787,* having experienced three
weeks of contrary winds and tempestuous weather. We at last
doubled the Cape, and afterwards had rather a favourable passage
to Botany Bay, where we arrived on the 19th of January,
1788.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* According to Phillip, the Fleet sailed from
the Cape on the 12th November (Vol. i, part 2, pp. 121 and 165).
King gives the date as the 13th (ante, p. 530).]</p>
<p class="foot">[** The vessels which arrived on the 19th January
were the Scarborough, Alexander, and Friendship. Ante, p.
540.]</p>
<p>Here we expected to find a beautiful country, &amp;c., as well
as to rest ourselves from our fatigues at least for two or three
years; but you will be as much surprised as we were disappointed
when I assure you that there is not a spot of ground large enough
for a cabbage-garden fit for cultivation within several miles of
it, and barely fresh water sufficient to supply our present
wants.</p>
<p>The country, for several miles round it, is either swamps or
rugged hills, covered with rocks and trees and underwood; and
some, barren and sandy, covered with brushwood. Here we lay for
four days, condoling on our hard fate, while his Excellency the
Governor explored the coast to the northward. However, he at last
returned with the pleasing account of having discovered the
finest harbour in the world. Highly elated with this discovery,
we quitted Botany (which by-the-bye is a beautiful bay, but does
not afford safe anchorage all the year round for ships) on the
20th of January, in the morning, and in six hours after arrived
at Port Jackson, the harbour above alluded to, which is only ten
or twelve miles to the northward of Botany Bay.</p>
<p>On the day following we landed at Sydney Cove (so called by
the Governor), where we have fixed our residence, and laid a
foundation for a colony. I am really not capable of describing
this harbour, which is without exception, I believe, the finest
in the known world. Suffice it to say, that it extends fourteen
or fifteen miles into the country, forming many beautiful bays or
coves on every side, which in the summer season abounds with
variety of fish, but now being winter not a fish can be
caught.</p>
<p>I heartily wish I could say as much of the country round it,
which is similar to that of Botany, but not quite so bad. There
are some spots here and there at two or three miles distance from
this cove which may be cultivated. The country has been explored
for upwards of forty miles round us, and hardly one acre of
ground could be found in any one place free from wood or rocks;
and what is very singular, no fresh-water river, or even a
spring, has as yet been discovered. The water we make use of is
the oozing of the hills and swamps, which caused many diseases at
the beginning; but now that we are used to it the bad effects
have partially ceased.</p>
<p>The natives are accurately described by Capt. Cook (I wish he
had as faithfully described the country). They are, I believe,
the most miserable of God's creatures! they are clad in nature's
dress, and live chiefly on fish and nuts, which last we are not
as yet well acquainted with. Their weapons are long poles, well
mounted with hard wood, sharp-pointed, and shark's teeth, and all
barbed, which they use indiscriminately in striking fish or
assailing their enemies. Their working-tools are an axe and a
chisel&mdash;the one, a piece of stone shaped and fixed in a
piece of wood; the other made of an oyster-shell. Their huts are
few and miserable, they in general inhabiting the cavities of
rocks and hollow trees, which they burn for that purpose. When
treated kindly they seem to be familiar and good-natured; still,
in my opinion, they are treacherous, for they have murdered three
or four of the convicts, whom they met unarmed. I say they are
treacherous, because they never attacked any that were armed; the
sight of a musket, if presented, would make a hundred of them
scout. They will not suffer their women to be seen if they can
avoid it. This miserable state of the natives appears to me to be
a sure sign of the poverty of the country.</p>
<p>The quadrupeds here are few. The kangaroo, for a description
of which I refer you to Cook's <i>Voyage</i>, is the largest so
far as we know yet; several have been killed. The flesh is coarse
and lean, and eats somewhat like very coarse mutton. Those that
were killed weighed from fifty to one hundred pounds, one only
excepted, which weighed near two hundred. The opossum is somewhat
larger than a cat, and is the next in size, the native dogs
excepted, which are of the fox kind. There are some other
quadrupeds not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The feathered creation is by no means as numerous as you may
suppose in a wild and woody country. Still they are rare in their
kinds. One ostrich and one black swan (the <i>rara avis</i> of
the antients) have been killed, and several were seen. Paraquets,
loriquets, and all the species of the parrot kind are very
beautiful. Different sorts of small birds, totally unknown in
Europe, sing pretty wild notes, and are in general of the
woodpecker and fly-catcher species.</p>
<p>The bays frequented by the natives produce wild spinage,
cellery, parsley, samphire, and wild beans. Some wild grapes have
been found in different parts of the country; and a shrub that
produces small berries, which are as tart as gooseberries, and
make as good pies, grows very common on the hills. The country
produces various sorts of flowers unknown in England. There are
three or four kinds of trees which are of little use except for
burning; one only I can except, a species of fir, which may be of
use in building, &amp;c. Two very different kinds of these trees
produce the same sort of red astringent gum, which is used in
medicine. A large shrub produces a yellow gum of the <i>Tolu</i>
kind, with which the natives fasten together their weapons,
tackles for fishing, &amp;c., and which may be used in medicine,
and for varnish. Of these I'll collect what I can at my leisure;
hitherto, I have had hardly time to look round me. You may easily
suppose the climate is temperate when we can live in marquees
now, being the middle of winter, without fire. The thermometer
rose frequently at noon to 90&deg; in the middle of summer, the
time we arrived here; and now seldom higher than 60&deg; at noon,
and never lower than 35&deg; the coldest night, which is three
degrees above the freezing-point. The rainy season set in three
weeks ago, during the whole of which time it has rained
incessantly, which we felt the more being obliged to live in
marquees, as I have already told you, having no huts as yet built
for us.</p>
<p>Having now given you a sketch of this country and its
productions, I leave you to form your own opinion of it. I shall
only venture to say it will never answer the intentions of
Government, and I make no doubt but we shall be recalled, which I
sincerely wish. His Excellency the Governor has set on foot a
brick manufactory, which succeeds to his wishes, having already
burnt several thousands for his own house. We are all extremely
busy in building huts, principally of the cabbage-trees, but only
two officers are as yet hutted.</p>
<p>You expect, perhaps, I'll give you some further account of
myself and situation here. On this head I can only say that I am
happy in the company of three messmates&mdash;no four could be
more united, or more agreeable to each other; besides, I have
enjoyed a tolerable share of good health, thank God, since I left
England. Every officer on this settlement is allowed two acres of
land, besides a certain space for a garden near his house. Four
of us, uniting our estates, have already sown half an acre of
wheat, which I am told by my farmer promises well. I propose to
set a few potatoes next week, which are the produce of some I set
on my arrival here, and which answered my expectations.</p>
<p>I brought six sheep from the Cape at a great expence, and
every one of them is either dead through the badness of this
country or killed by some villains among the convicts, who, in
spite of every punishment that can be inflicted, still persist in
their former villainous practices. Four of them have been
executed since our arrival here, and three more are very likely
to suffer the same fate very shortly.</p>
<p>I forgot to say we had a deal of thunder and lightning, which
has done some damage, and a few days ago we had a slight shock of
an earthquake. In short, I believe this country to be the outcast
of God's works.</p>
<p>I shall have an opportunity to write again in the course of
two months by Mr. Sharp, master of the Golden Grove.</p>

<h3>A LETTER FROM SYDNEY.</h3>

Botany Bay, received by the Golden Grove, transport, Captain
Sharp.*</b></p>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>London Chronicle</i>

<p align="right">November, 1788.   </p>
<p><small>THE</small> Governor's commission being read after the
troops and convicts were landed, and the laws also read with
great solemnity, they had so little effect upon the convicts that
they soon found means to break open the King's stores and stole
some articles thereout, for which a man of the name of Barret was
executed on the 27th of February, 1788; and on the 2nd of May
three more were convicted of thieving, one of whom only was
executed, and the others reprieved.</p>
<p>A convict, who it is probable was a coiner,** having produced
some bronze and metal resembling gold, said he had discovered a
gold-mine, and on condition of being sent home with a favorite
female convict he would shew it, and that he had sold a quantity
of gold to a gentleman belonging to the Golden Grove, which was
considered as so amazing an acquisition by the new settlers that
his request was granted. Inquiry being made to whom the gold was
sold, the convict replied, "To a black-complexioned man." On
this, an immediate muster was made in his presence, but he was
not able to point out the person. He still persisted in his
discovery, and that he would point out the spot, on which an
officer and twenty men were despatched with him in search of the
place. After traversing about ten miles, he pretended to have
occasion to go aside, and was permitted; but he set off by some
other way to the settlement, and told the Deputy-Governor that
the mine was so extensive it would need as many more hands to
work and guard it, on which a fresh detachment was preparing to
march in aid of the first, when, lo! the officer and his men came
into garrison, telling how they had been tricked by this culprit.
He was immediately put in irons, tried, and ordered a severe
flogging; between every hundred lashes he was asked relative to
the mine, and he persisted that he had discovered and knew where
it was until he had received three hundred, when he confessed the
whole to be a falsehood.</p>

<h3>LETTER FROM A FEMALE CONVICT.</h3>
<p align="right">Port Jackson, 14th November, 1788.   </p>
<p><small>I TAKE</small> the first opportunity that has been
given us to acquaint you with our disconsolate situation in this
solitary waste of the creation. Our passage, you may have heard
by the first ships, was tolerably favourable; but the
inconveniences since suffered for want of shelter, bedding,
&amp;c., are not to be imagined by any stranger. However, we have
now two streets, if four rows of the most miserable huts you can
possibly conceive of deserve that name. Windows they have none,
as from the Governor's house, &amp;c., now nearly finished, no
glass could be spared; so that lattices of twigs are made by our
people to supply their places. At the extremity of the lines,
where since our arrival the dead are buried, there is a place
called the church-yard; but we hear, as soon as a sufficient
quantity of bricks can be made, a church is to be built, and
named St. Philip, after the Governor. Notwithstanding all our
presents, the savages still continue to do us all the injury they
can, which makes the soldiers' duty very hard, and much
dissatisfaction among the officers. I know not how many of our
people have been killed. As for the distresses of the women, they
are past description, as they are deprived of tea and other
things they were indulged in in the voyage by the seamen, and as
they are all totally unprovided with clothes, those who have
young children are quite wretched. Besides this, though a number
of marriages have taken place, several women, who became pregnant
on the voyage, and are since left by their partners, who have
returned to England, are not likely even here to form any fresh
connections. We are comforted with the hopes of a supply of tea
from China, and flattered with getting riches when the settlement
is complete, and the hemp which the place produces is brought to
perfection. Our kingaroo rats are like mutton, but much leaner;
and there is a kind of chickweed so much in taste like our
spinach that no difference can be discerned. Something like
ground ivy is used for tea; but a scarcity of salt and sugar
makes our best meals insipid. The separation of several of us to
an uninhabited island was like a second transportation. In short,
every one is so taken up with their own misfortunes that they
have no pity to bestow upon others. All our letters are examined
by an officer, but a friend takes this for me privately. The
ships sail tomorrow.*</p>

<h3>A LETTER FROM SYDNEY.</h3>
<p align="center"><b><small>SOME</small> account of New Holland,
in a letter from Edward Home, carpenter, to a gentleman in
Edinburgh.**</b></p>
<p class="source">[** Reprinted from the <i>Edinburgh
Magazine</i>, July, 1789.]</p>
<p align="right">July, 1789.   </p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>You will excuse the imperfection of this account, but I shall
give it in the best manner I am able.</p>
<p>We made the South Cape of New Holland the 8th of January,
1788, in lat. 43&deg; 32' S., long. 146&deg; 56' E. The weather
being very fine, we had an opportunity of taking a view of the
South Cape on Van Dieman's Land, which appeared to us very high
and mountainous. In the evening the inhabitants made a very large
fire on a low sandy point of land, whether to welcome us or not
we were not able to understand. We left the cape that evening,
and proceeded for Botany Bay, at which place we arrived in twelve
days.</p>
<p>The natives, who appeared in numbers on Cape Banks, threw a
great quantity of sticks and stones at our ships, some running
into the woods, others among the rocks and clefts. We all came to
anchor that day in Botany Bay, in company with the Ceres
[Sirius], man-of-war, and Supply, tender. The whole fleet
remained here the space of five days, when the Governor, not
thinking this a convenient place for settling the new colony,
sailed with the whole convoy for Port Jackson, about three
leagues to the northward of Botany Bay, which place we found to
be one of the most commodious harbours in the world; the tide
there, by my own observation, rose and fell to the amount of
eleven feet perpendicular at spring tides, and at ordinary tides
about seven.</p>
<p>The land, in general, about Port Jackson, near the water, is
rocky and full of large timber of three sorts, a small specimen
of each of which I have sent you. The rock, in general, is of a
soft kind, somewhat resembling the Portland stone; the harder
part of the stones, some small pieces of which I have sent you,
generally occupies the rising ground a little way from the
waterside. The soil, in general, is black, and fit for any kind
of grain sown, or roots planted in it, but produces nothing
naturally. Some parts up the country are white sandy plains,
yielding a shrub from which the yellow gum is produced, of which
you have a sample, but nothing else that I could see. The red and
white trees have the same kind of gum, viz., red, which, when the
tree is cut, pours out in great quantities. The live oak produces
nothing but its natural sap. The natives, I think, are the most
miserable of the human form under heaven, the men, women, and
children being entirely naked, without exception of age or sex;
their persons in general are thin, though some of them are six
feet high; their hair, which I could not find was woolly, is so
clotted with gum that it sticks out something like a thrumb mop;
their hair is of a dirty brown; their habitations are the hollow
cavities which Nature has formed in the rocks by the waterside,
or, up the country, small wigwams made of the bark of a tree;
their canoes are made of the bark of some trees, and are of a
miserable construction, consisting of three or four pieces of
bark sewn together, tied at each end like a sack, and spread with
two or three pieces of wood to keep them apart. I have often met
with these in the coves a-fishing, and have observed the people
bring the fish on shore, make a fire and broil them, and have no
reason to think they are that cannibal race we were taught to
believe them. In meeting the different gangs of these people,
their common salutation was <i>warrey</i>, the meaning of which I
am unable to explain. I generally used to answer them with the
same word, without knowing whether it indicated friendship or
hostility, but as I generally carried firearms with me in the
woods, at meeting them my method was to clap my arms behind my
back, and to lay my hand on my breast, which they answered by
putting their spear behind them and their hand in the same
manner, and then both advancing we shook hands.</p>

<h3>TRANSPORTATION OR DEATH.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from <i>Scots Magazine</i> of
September, 1789.]</p>
<p><small>SATURDAY</small>, September 19th, the sessions ended at
the Old Bailey, when 12 convicts received sentence of death; 54
convicts, for felony, received sentence of transportation for
seven years; 82 respites were pardoned on condition of being
transported to Botany Bay for life, and 23 for the term of seven
years; 12 convicts to be kept to hard labour in the House of
Correction at Clerkenwell; 7 to be imprisoned in Newgate; 12 to
be publicly whipped and discharged; and 43 discharged by
proclamation.</p>
<p>A vast number of prisoners, who had on former occasions
received sentence of death, but whose executions had been delayed
during the late Royal indisposition, and from other causes, were
brought up and asked whether they would accept his Majesty's
mercy, on condition of their being transported to New South Wales
during their natural lives? The greater number of them accepted
this conditional pardon, but many with great hesitation. Eight,
however, peremptorily refused to accept of mercy on such terms,
and preferred their former sentence of death. They were all
seriously exhorted by the court, and told that if they persisted
in refusing to accept of the King's mercy they should be ordered
for execution as soon as the sheriff could be prepared for that
purpose.</p>
<p>They still persisted, and were ordered to the
condemned-cells.</p>
<p>About three hours afterwards, and a few minutes before the
court adjourned, Mr. Villette, the Ordinary of Newgate, informed
the court that he had visited these deluded men, and had
prevailed on them to alter their sentiments; they had, therefore,
commissioned him to implore the forgiveness of the court for
their obstinacy, and intreated that they might be permitted to
accept of the mercy of the Sovereign.</p>
<p>The court received their contrition, and sentenced them to
transportation for the term of their natural lives.</p>
<p>Three, however, still persisted in their refusal to accept of
the King's conditional pardon, preferring their former sentence
of death. They were ordered to the condemned-cells, and informed
that they will be executed as soon as the sheriff can be
prepared. The names of these obdurate convicts are, William
Davis, Edward Carruther, and Thomas Weston.</p>
<p>On Monday, Sept. 21, one of these deluded wretches was to have
been executed before Newgate. Every preparation for the dreadful
ceremony was made; the sheriffs stayed the execution to the
latest moment, when the unfortunate man, finding himself on the
brink of eternity, begged, and received, his Majesty's mercy on
the terms first offered to him. The other two availed themselves
of the Royal clemency on Saturday, the 19th.</p>

<p align="right">Portsmouth, 19th December, 1789.   </p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>The ship Neptune, under your command, being ready for sea, you
are to proceed with all convenient speed to Port Jackson, on the
coast of New South Wales, and there deliver your convicts and
Government stores to the order of Governor Phillip (taking three
certificates for them), one of which forward to us direct, if an

from China, where you are to proceed without loss of time from
Port Jackson, and load a cargo of teas for the Honourable East
India Company, conformable to our charter with them for that
purpose, the copy of which you have herewith; and thence return
to London direct.</p>
<p>Should it be found necessary on your passage to New South
Wales to touch at any place to take refreshments and water, we
particularly recommend the Cape of Good Hope for that purpose,
being more immediately in your way, and where the least time will
be lost in providing such matters as you may be in need of.
Lieutenant Shapcote, the Navy Agent, who goes with you, concurs
with us in this matter; but before you go into any port you must
request him to give you instructions, setting forth that he finds
it necessary to obtain refreshments for the sick, as we expect
Government to allow us demurrage for any detention in the passage
on that account.</p>
<p>Whilst you are in a foreign port the soldiers and convicts are
to be supplied with fresh beef two days in a week, as you will
perceive by the copy of the contract with the Navy Board, in your
possession; and you must take certificates of the number of days
they are so victualled with fresh beef, as also of the number of
days the soldiers, soldiers' wives, and convicts' wives and
children are victualled on board, from their first embarkation to
their being landed at New South Wales, which you will forward
with the certificates of their delivery.</p>
<p>You are, at Port Jackson or China (at your option), to receive
from the Scarborough all the provisions put on board her, for the
convicts and troops unexpended, together with the watercasks and
stores, and to dispose of them, with your own and those on board
the Surprize, to the best advantage for our account. After the
convicts and troops are landed it will be necessary to have a
survey of the provisions remaining on board each ship, that we
may be able to know what the exact expenditure has been on the
passage, distinct from the ship's company, the contract for the
troops and convicts being a separate matter from the ship's
altogether; but any of the provisions found necessary may be
taken for the ship's use.</p>
<p>The convicts and troops must be victualled and supplied
conformable to contract (copy of which in your possession); but
you must be very careful and see the expenditure does not exceed
it, as under the construction of wastage we may be made
considerable sufferers if it is not particularly attended to;
and, at all events, there must not be a greater consumption than
we have agreed for, including all allowance whatever; and as
Captain Anstis* and Captain Marshall** have merely extracts of
the contract from us, you must furnish them with any further
information on this subject they may stand in need of.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Nicholas Anstis, master of the Surprize,
transport.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** John Marshall, master of the Scarborough,
transport.]</p>
<p>At New South Wales, or on your passage to China, you are to
remove all bulkheads, storerooms, and obstructions of every kind,
both in the hold and between the lower and middle decks, and to
stow both the hold and lower deck, in the best and most
advantageous manner, completely full of teas from one end of the
ship to the other, save and except sufficient space for the
tiller to traverse over in the gunroom and to be shipped or
unshipped, and no more; and as there is a greater quantity of
iron kentlage on board than required by the East India Company,
we consider your taking China would be detrimental to us;
therefore, avoid it if you can, and procure as much black teas as
possible to stow in the bottom, for the purpose of keeping the
ship stiff.</p>
<p>You are not, directly or indirectly, to carry on, or suffer to
be carried on, any private trade whatever on board your said
ship, or in anywise depending thereon; nor are you to suffer your
officers to take on board any privilege, it being understood they
are to have none; and you are to be accountable for all
deficiencies of teas which may be lost or embezzled from on
board, and which we shall be liable to account for to the East
India Company.</p>
<p>In consideration for the due performance of the above services
to be done and performed, we do hereby agree to allow you ten
pounds sterling per calendar month, and five pounds per month for
finding yourself and your officers with cabin stores and
necessaries, and ten per cent. upon the freight of all surplus
tonnage the ship shall bring home from China, which wages and
commission is to be in lieu of every emolument whatever; and in
all things concerning the convicts, troops, and dispatch of the
ship you are to consult and be governed by the direction and
advice of Mr. Shapcote, who goes in your ship, appointed by the
Navy Board as agent, to superintend the expedition to New South
Wales; but after the convicts, stores, &amp;c., are delivered
there, you have nothing further to do with Government, and must
make the best of your way without loss of time. Mr. Shapcote, and
Captain Nepean, who has the command of the troops, are to be
accommodated in a respectable and comfortable manner at your
table, without any expence to themselves whatever; and for any
additional expence you may be put to on that account we will
reimburse you. We have only to request you will write us by every
occasion that may offer; and sincerely wishing you a good voyage
and safe return,</p>

<h3>DISPOSAL OF IRISH CONVICTS.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Dublin Chronicle</i>
of 18th February, 1790.]</p>
<p align="center"><i>Parliament of Ireland.&mdash;House of
Commons.</i></p>
<p align="right">Monday, 15th February.   </p>
<p><small>THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER</small> rose to attract
the attention of the House to a matter of very considerable
importance; it was upon the subject of those wretched people who
were sentenced in this country for transportation. It appeared
that a number of them had been lately put on shore at
Newfoundland, from which they had been lately compelled to
return. The fact was that we had no place for their reception.
England, for her convicts, possessed Botany Bay, or a settlement
on an island near that place. Whether Ireland would avail herself
of this circumstance was for the consideration of the House. The
expence attending the transportation of convicts to that quarter
of the globe was enormous. The mere price of conveyance was about
eighteen pounds per head; besides this, there was a charge of
twenty-eight pounds or twenty-nine pounds for clothing and other
necessaries, which raised the expence of each convict to
something about fifty pounds. There were other articles attending
the conveyance of transports from England, which raised the cost
of their transportation to about seventy pounds each man. His
idea, therefore, was that persons convicted of lesser crimes
should be employed in hard labour, or in some manner beneficial
to the country, and that those guilty of greater should be
transported for life; for certain he was that wherever they might
be placed they would be bad subjects. It would be in the wisdom
of the House to consider whether the establishment of
penitentiary houses, or hospitals, similar to those in England,
would not be worthy adoption. In England, it appeared that the
produce of labour, in a variety of instances, more than
compensated the whole expence of the establishment and the rent
of the building. He threw out this idea for general
consideration, and he called upon the gentlemen of the several
counties to give their assistance, as they must be best
acquainted with the local arrangements most suitable to their
several counties. Administration only made the proposal, as they
judged it improper to let the opportunity escape of submitting so
salutary an arrangement to the attention of the kingdom. The
object for consideration was, whether they should think it
advisable to transport their convicts to Botany Bay at the
expence above mentioned, or whether they should provide places at
home for their reception, in order to render their services
useful to the country. Doubtless the latter would be attended
with some expence. He thought it, therefore, more respectful to
submit the matter to Parliament in the first instance than to
come forward with any specific system. He should allow gentlemen
four or five days to revolve the subject in their minds, at the
expiration of which he would bring in a Bill.</p>
<p><small>MR. HOLMES</small> thought, that upon the ground of
humanity, reason, and policy, the subject which had been brought
forward by the right hon. gentleman solicited the most serious
attention; but he conceived that a system might be adopted upon
the plan suggested, without the attendance of any circumstance of
expence to alarm the public. In England, it was well known, the
labour of penitentiary houses more than compensated the expences
of the establishment. He instanced the penitentiary house of
Wimbledon, in Norfolk, for an example, which appeared, by a
return, to produce more from the industry of the culprits then
was necessary to defray the expences of the institution. He
mentioned an excellent regulation which prevailed at that place.
When the term of the convict expired, he was treated according to
the merits of his conduct. If he had behaved himself with
becoming propriety, he received decent apparel, a letter of
recommendation was given, and he was enabled to depart from the
place of his captivity with money in his pocket. This certainly
put him beyond the necessity of resorting to his former
enormities, and the habits of industry which he had been in
naturally induced him to seek a support by his own honest
exertions. In this country the case was very different; no person
would entertain&mdash;no person would employ&mdash;an unfortunate
wretch who had once received the sentence of the laws, and they
were of necessity obliged to recur to that mode of livelihood
which had been the cause of their disgrace and punishment. On
looking over the list of transports who had returned from
Newfoundland, he discovered that some of the convicts were under
the age of twelve, and that six were under the age of fourteen.
This he submitted as a strong argument in favour of penitentiary
houses or buildings upon the plan mentioned by the right hon.
gentleman, for there was something shocking in thus abandoning
early youth to infamy without the hope of reclaiming their pliant
minds. Certainly the restraints of solitude, silence, hard
labour, and spare diet would have a powerful effect in recovering
the culprit to virtue. But above all, some such regulation was
necessary upon the ground of presumptive justice. A disregard to
this, he said, had stained our code of criminal law with cruelty;
it had multiplied executions without profit to the community, and
had caused the effusion of our fellow-creatures' blood without
producing any public advantage. Mr. Holmes was decidedly in
favour of some salutary regulation of this nature, and expressed
an opinion that it would meet the support of every part of the
House.</p>
<p><small>MR. FORBES</small> had no other objection to the system
proposed but that it would, like all other applications of public
money, be rendered a source of profusion in this country.
Probably two or three Parliamentary gentlemen would be
accommodated with places under it. The expence of building
penitentiary houses would be very considerable, he imagined, but
of which he was able to make no estimate. But he thought it
better to get rid of bad members of the community by exporting
them to Botany Bay, were the expence sixty or seventy pounds
each, than to keep them within the precincts of our own society,
when they might possibly have an opportunity of corrupting the
honest and industrious.</p>
<p><small>THE CHANCELLOR or THE EXCHEQUER</small> replied that he
was far from wishing to connect the plan he had mentioned to the
purposes of expence or patronage. On the contrary, he desired and
solicited his assistance in framing the Bill to guard against
these errors which he apprehended, and to correct others, if any
should appear.</p>

<h3>THE WRECK OF THE GUARDIAN.*</h3>

letter from a gentleman at the Cape of Good Hope."]</p>
<p align="right">Cape of Good Hope, 1st March, 1790.   </p>
<p><small>I DARESAY</small> you will not easily tire of hearing
of the Guardian. Before this reaches you, I suppose, accounts of
her miraculous escape must have got home. She came in here eight
days ago in a situation not to be credited without ocular proofs.
She had, I think, nine feet water in her when she anchored. The
lower gundeck served as a second bottom; it was stowed with a
very great weight equally fore and aft. To this, and to the
uncommon strength of it, Captain Riou ascribes his safety. Seeing
an English ship with a signal of distress, four of us went on
board, scarcely hoping but with busy fancy still pointing her out
to be the Guardian,&mdash;and, to our inexpressible joy, we found
it was her. We stood in silent admiration of her heroic commander
(whose supposed loss had drawn tears from us before), shining
through the rags of the meanest sailor. The fortitude of this man
is a glorious example for British officers to emulate. Since that
time we have gone on board again to see him. He is affable in his
manners, and of most commanding presence; add to that, a fine
manly figure, of about twenty-eight, which I suppose his age to
be. Perhaps we, under the influence of that attraction which
great sufferings always produce, may, in the enthusiasm of our
commendation, be too lavish in his praise; were it not for this
fear I would at once pronounce him the most God-like mortal I
ever viewed. They were two months from the time the accident
happened until they reached this place. Every man shared alike in
the labour; and not having at all attended to their persons
during the whole of that dismal period they looked like men of
another world&mdash;long beards, dirt, and rags covered them. Mr.
Riou got one of his hands crushed and one of his legs hurt, but
both are getting well. None of his people died during their
fatigues. He says his principal attention was to keep up their
spirits and to watch over their health. He never allowed himself
to hope until the day before he got in here, when he made the
land. Destitute of that support, how superior must his fortitude
be! He has this morning, for the first time, come on shore,
having been employed getting stores, &amp;c., out to lighten the
ship. He wavers what to do with her&mdash;whether to put
Government to the expence of repairing her here (which would
almost equal her first cost, perhaps exceed it), or burn her.
Most likely the last will be resolved on.</p>

<h3>A LETTER FROM SURGEON ALLEY.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Dublin Chronicle</i>
of 28th August, 1790. The editor described it as "the substance
of a letter from Mr. Alley, a surgeon in the Lady Juliana,
transport, bound for Botany Bay."]</p>
<p align="right">Cape of Good Hope, 22nd March, 1790.   </p>
<p><small>WE</small> sailed from Plymouth the 29th of July, with
226 convicts and six children on board, and arrived in Port Praya
Bay on the 23rd of September; but on the same day we proceeded on
our passage to the Brazils. As we advanced towards the Line the
weather was become intolerably hot, which, joined to the heavy
rains and calms that soon after came on, made us very
apprehensive for the health of the convicts and ship's company,
having at that time sixty dangerously ill. Contrary, however, to
expectation, after we had crossed the Equator the weather proved
very favourable during our passage to the Brazils; and on the
26th of November we anchored before the city of St. Sebastian, at
Rio Janeiro. The town is very extensive and populous; the streets
are narrow but well paved, abounding with shops of all kinds, in
which the wants of a stranger, if money is not one of them, can
hardly remain unsatisfied. At the corner of each street stands an
image of the Virgin, stuck round with lights, at which strangers
commonly stop and sing psalms and pray. The height to which
religious zeal is carried in this place by the Portuguese cannot
fail of creating astonishment in a stranger. The markets are well
stored with butcher's meat, and vegetables of all kinds,
pine-apples, grapes, melons, and oranges abound in great plenty.
The convicts were daily victualled with fresh provisions,
vegetables, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Having refreshed the convicts, on the morning of the 10th of
January we took our departure from Rio Janeiro, amply furnished
with such things as the place afforded, and the day after we lost
sight of the American shore. Nothing particular occurred on the
passage to the Cape of Good Hope, except the loss of our
carpenter, who fell overboard and was drowned in spite of every
effort to save him, and on the 1st instant we arrived at Table
Bay. Found riding here his Majesty's ship Guardian, which had a
very narrow escape from foundering at sea. She struck against an
island of ice, which almost shattered her to pieces, so much that
seventy of the people left her, of whom all except eight must
have perished, consisting of the master, purser, and chaplain,
with five other men, who were taken up at sea by a French ship,
and arrived here some time ago. These people have taken up their
passage for Europe in the same vessel; and through Providence the
Guardian arrived here a few days after they had sailed from this
place, so that the first news in England will be of her having
foundered at sea. The surgeon and two midshipmen, with five
others, perished in a small boat alongside the ship. Mr. Riou,
the commander of the ship, with twenty men, stood by the ship
with a resolution to sink with her, but, as I have mentioned
before, Providence brought them in here. Mr. Riou declares that
he knows not in what manner the Guardian got here, she being
waterlogged, and could not be steered for want of the rudder.</p>
<p>Port Jackson will suffer greatly by the disappointment of so
valuable a cargo as she had, which consisted of provisions of all
kinds, of live stock, such as horses, cows, bulls, sheep, and a
great quantity of bale goods for the poor wretches at New
Holland. The loss of those articles must distress the colony to a
great degree.</p>
<p>I omitted in the former part of my letter to mention the
number of deaths and births which have occurred since we left
England. Of the former we have had only five, and of the latter
seven, so that we have increased only two; and in a few days I
expect three more births. At present we are remarkably healthy;
how long we may remain so God knows, as the worst of our passage
will be to New Holland.</p>

Williams, boatswain of the Guardian, to his agents in
London.*</b></p>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Public Advertiser</i>
of 6th August, 1790.]</p>
<p align="right">Table Bay, Cape of Good Hope,        <br>
27th March, 1790.   </p>
<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>I have taken this opportunity to acquaint you that his
Majesty's ship Guardian is safe arrived at the Cape of Good Hope
after a moast troablesum and disagreuble axident that as
happened. I shold be glad to give the particular of evrey thing,
but time will not permit; but all that I can inform you with I
will. We was in a verry fair way of making a quick passage to our
intended poart. December the 22, in the latt. of 42&middot;52
south, lond. 42&middot;22 east, we fell in with several islands
of ice. On the 23rd fell in with a large island of ice about
twice as high as our mastheads. We sent our boats to pick up
loose ice that was about, by wich means we had like to have lost
our boats and men, for the weather came on thick and begun to
blow verry hard, so 'twas with a great deale of troble that they
got to the ship. We cleereed them of the ice that they had picked
up to make fresh water of, and then we hoisted the boats in and
stud from the island of ice for two hours; then tacked and stood
to the eastward. The ice was so lofty that itt drifted faster
than we expected, by the wind having so much hold of itt, the
weather being so thick that wee could scarce see the length of
the ship, the wind blowing fresh that we run foul of itt and
received a great deale of dammage, knocked away our rudder,
broake the tiller in three pieces, broake one of the after-beams
in two, knocked the sternpost from the keel, and dammaged the
ship in a shocking manner. This axident happened on the 23rd of
December; and on the 25th the boats left us with moast of the
officers and a great part of the seamen. The mastergunner,
purser, one master's mate, one midshipman, and a person [?
parson],** with nine seamen, was got into the longboat and all
saved. The doctor and four or five men got into a cutter and was
upset close to the ship, and all of them was drowned. As for the
rest of the boats, I believe must be lost and all in them
perrished, for wee was not nigh any land. We was about six
hundred leagues from any land. There was about fifty-six men
missing; a number drowned jumping into the boats; the sea ran so
high that the boats could scarce live. The commander had a strong
resulution, for he said he would soner go down in the ship than
he wold quid hur. All the officers left in the ship is the
commander, the carpenter, one midshipman, and myself. After the
boats left us we had two chances&mdash;either to pump or sink. We
cold just get into the sailroom. We got up a new forecourse and
stuck itt full of oakum and rags, and put itt under the ship's
bottom; this called fothering the ship. We found some benefit by
itt, for pumping and bailing we gained on hur; that gave us a
little hopse of saving our lives. We was in this terable
situation for nine weeks before we got to the Cape of Good Hope.
Sometimes our upper-deck scuppers was under water outside, and
the ship leying like a log on the water, and the sea breaking
over her as if she was a rock in the sea. Sixteen foot of water
was the common run for the nine weeks in the hold. I am not
certain what we are to doo with the ship as yeat. We have got
allmoast of our cargo out; it is all dammaged but the beef and
pork, which is in good order. I have lost a great dele of my
cloaths, and I am thinking of drawing of about six pound, wich I
think I can make shift with. If this axcident had not hapned I
shold not have had aney call for aney. As for my stores, [there]
is a great part of them thrown overboard; likewise all the
officers' stores in the ship is gone the same way, for evry thing
that came to hand was thrown overboard to lighten the ship. I
think that we must wait till ordars comes from England to know
what we are to do with the ship.</p>

<h3>A CONVICT'S LETTER.</h3>
<p align="center"><b><small>EXTRACT</small> of a letter from a
young man at Port Jackson to Mr Thomas Olds, of James-street,
Oxford Road.*</b></p>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Gazetteer</i> of 29th
December, 1790.]</p>
<p align="right">9th April, 1790.   </p>
<p><small>I SEIZE</small> this opportunity of letting you know,
by a vessel that will sail very soon, our wretched situation,
which has been occasioned by the miscarriage of our supplies, and
that perhaps you have not yet heard of. To give a just
description of the hardships that the meanest of us endure, and
the anxieties suffered by the rest, is more than I can pretend
to. In all the Crusoe-like adventures I ever read or heard of, I
do not recollect anything like it; for though you may be told of
the quantity of salt meat that is allowed us, its quality in
boiling does not make it above half as much, besides other
inconveniences I cannot now mention, and which I think make so
many of the children very unhealthy. On the same account, I
believe few of the sick would recover if it was not for the
kindness of the Rev. Mr. Johnson, whose assistance out of his own
stores makes him the physician both of soul and body. All our
improvements, except our gardens, have lately been quite at a
stand, neither do I think they will go on again till we have more
assistance from England. God only knows what our Governor thinks
of it, or what word he has sent home; but for my part, from the
highest to the lowest, I see nobody that is so contented as they
were at first. We fear the troops, and they are not contented
with seeing those who live better than themselves, nor with us
who live worse; and I think if the savages knew that we were as
short of powder as we are of provisions they would soon be more
daring than they are. We have heard that some convicts at home,
who might have been pardoned for capital crimes, have chose their
former sentence rather than come here; and which, though it was
contradicted, we cannot help thinking is true. We cannot tell, if
they have heard of our situation, how it could be, unless from
the Cape or Norfolk Island, which we hear no more from than from
England. We had some Jews and Dutchmen from thence that would
have settled if they had thought it worth while. I should now be
very glad of the things I refused to take with me when I came
from London, and hope you will venture to send me some needles
and blue thread; for, as the cloaths are all wore out that we
brought from home, we are mostly in our Woolwich dresses, and the
women look like gypsies. But to be serious. We have had so many
disappointments about arrivals, &amp;c., that the sullen reserve
of superiority has only increased our apprehensions; and some of
the most ignorant have no other idea than that they are to be
left by the troops and the shipping to perish by themselves! And
really, if you was to see with what ardent expectations some of
the poor wretches watch an opportunity of looking out to sea, or
the tears that are often shed upon the infants at the breast, you
must have feelings that otherwise you never could have any
experience of.</p>

<h3>EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM AN OFFICER.</h3>
<p align="right">Port Jackson, New South Wales, 14th April,
1790.*   </p>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from <i>The Oracle</i> of 25th
April, 1791.]</p>
<p><small>BY</small> the time this reaches you, the fate of this
settlement, and all it contains, will be decided. It is now more
than two years since we landed here, and within less than a month
of three since we left England. So cut off from all intercourse
with the rest of mankind are we, that, subsequent to the month of
August, 1788, we know not of any transaction that has happened in
Europe, and are no more assured of the welfare or existence of
any of our friends than of what passes in the moon. It is by
those only who have felt the anguish and distress of such a state
that its miseries can be conceived.</p>
<p>The little European knowledge that we are masters of we picked
cat of some old English newspapers which were brought from the
Cape of Good Hope about a twelvemonth back, in the Sirius, by
which ship you may possibly recollect to have received a letter
from me, dated October 1, 1788; but as to all family news, all
knowledge of our private affairs, or little endearing accounts,
which no man, I presume, is without a wish to receive, nothing
but a blank for the long space of three years has been presented
to us. But great as our anxiety on this head is, it falls short
of what we suffer on another account: the dread of perishing by
famine stares us in the face; on the day I write we have but
eight weeks' provisions in the public stores, and all chance of a
reinforcement under seven months is cut off, unless ships from
England should yet, notwithstanding the lateness of the season,
come in upon us. The hope of this is, however, very feeble, for,
without the most shameful and cruel inattention on your part,
ships must have left England by the first of August last, to come
here; and if so, they have undoubtedly perished on their route.
Even this alternative, dreadful as it is, is less afflicting than
to believe that our country would send us out here as a sacrifice
to famine and the savages of the place, who, if ever they shall
by any means learn our situation, will prove extremely
troublesome.</p>
<p>To add to our misfortunes, the Sirius (one of the two ships of
war on this station) was totally and irretrievably lost on
Norfolk Island, the 19th of last month. The particulars of this
trying calamity I cannot at present spare time to write, but I am
happy to say that Captain Hunter and all the rest of her crew
were saved, with difficulty. She had left us, for Norfolk Island,
in the beginning of the month, and carried to that place the
Lieutenant-Governor, half the battalion of marines, and 200
convicts, whom it was thought adviseable to send there, in order
that we may be as variously dispersed in the approaching crisis,
to procure food, as possible. Had the Sirius returned safely
here, it was intended to have despatched her immediately to
China, to load with provisions for the colony.</p>
<p>You never saw such dismay as the news of the wreck occasioned
among us all; for, to use a sea term, we looked upon her as our
sheet-anchor. All that can now be done is to despatch the Supply,
a little brig, commanded by a lieutenant of the Navy, to Batavia,
where she is, if possible, by offering any price, to procure a
large ship, and load her with relief for us. By this conveyance
the opportunity of writing is afforded me, but God knows how or
when it will reach you, though it is proper to observe that an
officer is to proceed from Batavia to England with despatches for
the Secretary of State as quickly as can be done. This is written
in a very different language to my last letter, when I exulted
with hope, and looked forward with confidence. Let what will
happen, I shall be cheered by the reflection of my misfortunes
not being caused by my own errors, an unspeakable consolation,
besides which, I am not very apt to despair, and have many things
in my favour. I am a stranger to sickness, and find that neither
heat, cold, wet, or dry, affect my constitution in any shape
whatever, Some little private comforts, which in better days I
did not wanton away, are yet left me&mdash;nay, I have had enough
to succour more than one of my neighbours in distress. It is
true, our present allowance is a short one: two pounds of pork
(which was cured four years ago, and shrinks to nothing if
boiled), two pounds and an half of flour, a pound of rice, and a
pint of pease per week is what we live upon. Now, on this ration,
reduced as it is, I have no fear of being able to crawl on for
many months to come; so that if Heaven be but favourable to the
voyage of the Supply (and, thank God, she is as ably commanded
and navigated as any ship in the King's service) all things will
yet do, for when I spoke of only eight weeks' provisions in the
stores, I meant at full allowance, whereas what we are at at
present is but a third. Again, to help us out, we use every means
to get fish, and sometimes with good success, which is an
incredible relief. On the fishing service, the officers, civil
and military, take it in turns every night to go out for the
whole night in the fishing-boats; and the military, besides, keep
a guard at Botany Bay, and carry on a fishery there, taking it
three days and three days, turn and turn about. Were the ground
good, our gardens would be found of infinite use to us in these
days of scarcity, but with all our efforts we cannot draw much
from them; however, they afford something, and by industry and
incessant fatigue mine is one of the best. Were you to see us
digging, hoeing, and planting, it would make you smile. As to
parade duties and shew, we have long laid them aside, except the
mounting a small guard by day and a picquet at night. Our
soldiers have not a shoe, and mount guard barefoot. "Pride, pomp,
and circumstance of glorious war are at an end." After having
suffered what we do, I shall be grievously hurt, on landing in
England, to meet the sneers of a set of holiday troops, whose
only employ has been to powder their hair, polish their shoes,
and go through the routine of a field-day, though I must own that
our air, gait, and raggedness will give them some title to be
merry at our expence. So incessantly have we been employed that
no military manoeuvre of the least consequence has been practised
by us since our embarkation at Plymouth. To cut down trees, turn
up ground, and build houses have engrossed all our labour and
attention.</p>
<p>Among other letters which I write by this opportunity is a
very long one to the *  *  *  *  *, in which I have very fairly
and freely set down my opinion of this country. The following
passage, which I extract for your satisfaction, and with which I
close my account, will, I hope, impress his Lordship strongly
with the idea of giving his opinion for abandoning the colony,
should he ever be consulted on the occasion, or should it at any
time become matter of Parliamentary debate. As to the veracity
and justice with which it is written, I will maintain them
against any interested opponent who may choose to start against
me, in the face of the whole world.</p>
<p>"The country, my Lord, is past all dispute a wretched one, a
very wretched, and totally incapable of yielding to Great Britain
a return for colonizing it. Amidst its native productions I
cannot number one which is valuable as an article of commerce.
There is no wood fit for naval purposes; no fibrous grass or
plant from which cordage can be made; no substance which can aid
or improve the labours of the manufacturer; no mineral
productions; no esculent vegetables worth the care of collecting
and transporting to other climes; and lastly, which is of the
most serious consideration, no likehood that the colony will be
able to support itself in grain or animal food for many years to
come, so that a regular annual expence is entailed on the mother
country as long as it shall be kept."</p>
<p>Besides this, I have given his *  *  *  * every other piece of
information relative to our Government, management of the
convicts, and knowledge of the natives, in my power.</p>

<h3>THE MUTINY ON THE SCARBOROUGH, TRANSPORT.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Dublin Chronicle</i>
of Saturday, 23rd October, 1790.]</p>
<p align="right">18th April, 1790.   </p>
<small>A VERY</small> affecting letter has been received by a
gentleman of Lincoln's Inn, from Samuel Burt, the person
convicted of forgery, but pardoned on condition of going to New
South Wales, dated from the Scarborough, transport, False Bay,
Cape of Good Hope, April 18, which contains the following account
of the intended mutiny and massacre of the crew by the
convicts.**
<p class="foot">[** Collins (vol. i, p. 123) mentions the part
Samuel Burt took in preventing the mutiny.]</p>
<p>The convicts having laid a plot to surprize the crew and
murder the officers, and run away with the vessel, only waited
for opportunity to put their horrid designs into execution. The
substance of his letter is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>"On the 12th of February, our ship having separated from the
Surprize, transport, the Neptune being a great way ahead, and the
sea perfectly calm, these unhappy wretches began to whisper from
one to the other their mutinous intentions. The plot being
communicated to myself, I readily agreed to the scheme, assenting
to every proposal of plunder and murder, until such time as I
became completely master of the conspiracy and the ringleaders of
it. I then apprised the captain of the ship and the military
officers of the dangers they were likely to encounter; and so
thoroughly did my information prepare them for the business that
with little or no trouble the ringleaders were secured and the
scheme entirely frustrated. The parties being examined, they made
such confession that human nature would almost shudder at the
thoughts of. Several of them have been flogged with the greatest
severity, and others of more dangerous description are at this
time chained to the deck, and it is supposed will be tried and
executed immediately on their arrival at New South Wales."</p>
<p>The circumstances of Burt's case were rather remarkable. Being
rejected by a woman whom he wished to marry, he committed a
forgery, and immediately afterwards surrendered himself at
Bow-street, declaring to his friend he had done it for the
purpose of getting hanged. Being considered as an object of
compassion, he was offered his Majesty's most gracious pardon,
which he twice or thrice refused. The lady at length consented to
marry him. He then became as solicitous to live as he had before
been anxious for death; but during her repeated visits to him in
Newgate she caught the gaol-fever and died.</p>

<h3>AN OFFICER'S LETTER.*</h3>
<p align="center"><b>[Extract.]</b></p>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>
of 30th December, 1790. The letter bears no date, but it was
probably carried by Lieutenant King, who arrived in England on
the 21st December, 1790. If so, the date would be either March or
April, 1790. But for the fact that Major Ross was absent at
Norfolk Island, the close resemblance of the sentiments and
language to those of his letter to Nepean of 10th July, 1788
(Vol. i, part 2, p. 176), would point to him as the author.]</p>
<p><small>I DO</small> not know what representations of this
colony and of Norfolk may have been given to Government and the
country. We suspect that a favourable picture has been drawn. But
give me leave to assure you, if such be the case, you may rely on
its being a gross falsehood and base deception. The country, take
my word for it, has no one thing to recommend it; and what could
have induced Government to form a settlement here without having
first examined it particularly I cannot imagine. One thing is
certain, it will never answer.</p>
<p>In our present alarming situation the Governor thought proper
to summon us all to council, a step he never thought it expedient
to take before; and I will venture to affirm that he would not
now have thought it worth his while to submit himself to the
opinion of anyone but that dire necessity, and a want of
sufficiency in himself, pointed out to him the propriety of such
a salutary measure. The sum of our deliberations amounted to the
fixing of plans for our support in the present exigency, which we
hope will not prove abortive.</p>
<p>What I have said of the country, our general situation, and
mode of administration falls very short of a full description of
their wretched and deplorable condition. But I am sure it is
strictly true. And I should have considered myself guilty of a
great neglect of my duty to my country, you, and myself, if I had
omitted this opportunity of acquainting you with our unhappy
circumstances.</p>

<h3>WRECK OF THE GUARDIAN.**</h3>
<p class="source">[** Reprinted from the <i>London Chronicle</i>
of 24th April, 1790.]</p>
<p><small>THE</small> fate of the Guardian so immediately
following the disaster of the Bounty is the more extraordinary
and piteous. Lieutenant Riou was at the Cape of Good Hope, and
had an interview with Lieutenant Bligh just after he had reached
that port; and the Guardian sailed on her voyage within a few
days previous to Mr. Bligh's departure from the Cape to
England.</p>
<p>The most speedy exertions were made by Captain Riou, her
commander, to accomplish the object of his voyage while at the
Cape. Near a score of cows, six horses, several goats, sheep, a
few deers, and other animals, with rabbits and poultry, were
taken on board and properly disposed. The ship struck on the ice
about eight or ten days after she left the Cape.</p>
<p>At first some hopes were entertained that the leak might be
stopped; but the straw and sailcloth thus applied was soon forced
away, and the boats were the only resort. Five boats were all the
Guardian had, and of these one was instantly stove, and some
people in consequence perished. Her entire crew were in number
ninety-five, besides the commander.</p>
<p>The boat which was taken up contained about sixteen of the
crew, under the direction of Mr. Clements, the master; the day
after, they left the wreck and the heroic Mr. Riou, a solitary
victim to rigid duty, on her deck. The boat in which was Mr.
Crowther, the chaplain, came to solicit a quadrant from Mr.
Clements; while this was reaching to him the chaplain sprung on
board, and thus his life was preserved.</p>
<p>The fate of the other boats excites much apprehension, and in
particular the want of water was the evil they were least likely
to surmount.</p>
<p>A letter has been received at the Admiralty, which was written
by the captain of the Guardian about an hour before she sunk, in
which letter Captain Riou had shown great magnanimity and
coolness when in the most imminent danger. The part of the crew
who have arrived safe here by the way of St. Helena relate that
Captain Riou sat down in his own cabin with the utmost composure
to write the above letter when the ship was wrecked, and he had
scarce any hopes left of saving his own life, whatever might be
the lucky fate of some of his crew.</p>
<p>It is with deep concern that we acquaint our readers that Mr.
Pitt, the only son of Lord Camelford, was on board the Guardian,
sloop, and is supposed to have perished among the rest of that
numerous crew, excepting only thirteen out of 300 souls on
board.</p>

<h3>THE WRECK OF THE GUARDIAN.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Public Advertiser</i>
of 28th April, 1790.]</p>
<p><small>THE</small> Guardian, ship-of-war, had public stores to
the amount of &pound;70,000 on board, besides the private
property. Her deck was a complete garden. The plants were in a
thriving condition, and her live stock was uncommonly healthy.
She was obviously too far to the southward when she struck upon
the island. It will be for the Admiralty to shew that the captain
had not orders to take that course. Surely, under all the
circumstances of the voyage, the squadron ought not to have
delayed their time a moment in making discoveries.</p>

<h3>THE WRECK OF THE GUARDIAN.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Public Advertiser</i>
of 30th April, 1790.]</p>
<p><small>THOUGH</small> beyond the verge of all probability, we
are enabled to announce that his Majesty's ship Guardian is safe!
She arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on the 21st of February
last. Of this important event official dispatches, signed by
Lieutenant Riou, and dated the Cape of Good Hope, are received at
the Admiralty Office.</p>
<p>The disaster which befell the ship having been offered to the
public eye in various jarring accounts, we call their attention
to the following summary of authentic particulars:&mdash;</p>
<p>"The island of ice was first seen on the 23rd of December,
twelve days after the Guardian sailed from the Cape of Good Hope,
on her way to New South Wales.</p>
<p>"The weather was extremely foggy, and the island was not very
distinct when first beheld. Lieutenant Riou gave directions to
stand towards it, in order to collect lumps of ice to supply the
ship with water. This proceeding was judged highly expedient, as
the daily demand of water was prodigious, owing to the great
quantity of cattle on board. As the ship approached the island
the boats were hoisted out and manned, and several lumps
collected. During this time the ship lay to, and on the supply of
water being brought on board she attempted to stand away. Very
little apprehension was at this time entertained of her safety,
although the enormous bulk of the island occasioned an
unfavourable current, and in some measure gave a partial
direction to the wind.</p>
<p>"On a sudden the base of the island, which projected under
water considerably beyond the limits of the visible parts, struck
the bow of the ship; she instantly swung round, and her head
cleared, but her stern, coming on the shoal, struck repeatedly,
and the sea being very heavy, her rudder broke away, and all her
works abaft were shivered. The ship in this situation became in a
degree embayed under the terrific bulk of ice; the height was
twice that of the mainmast of a ship of the line. The prominent
head of the ice was every moment expected to break away and
overwhelm the ship. At length, after every practicable exertion,
she was got off the shoal, and the ice floated past her.</p>
<p>"It was soon perceived that the ship had six feet water in her
hold, and it was increasing very fast. The hands were set to the
pumps and to find out the leaks, and occasionally relieved each
other. Thus they continued labouring unceasingly on the 24th,
although on the 23rd not one of them had the least rest. The ship
was at one period so much relieved that she had only two feet
water in the hold; but at this time, when their distress bore the
best aspect, the water increased in a moment to ten feet; and the
ship being discovered to be strained in all her works, and the
sea running high, every endeavour to check the progress of a
particular leak proved ineffectual. An immediate project was
fixed on to lighten the ship, and the cows, horses, sheep, and
all the other live stock for the colony were, with their fodder,
committed to the deep to perish.</p>
<p>"At Lieutenant Riou's exhortive appeals the exhausted crew had
again recourse to the pumps, but after repeated trials the water
could not be kept under, and the pumps, it was found, had lost
all their efficiency and power. The crew, thus disheartened, on
the 25th (Christmas Day), besought the commander to permit them
to hoist out the boats. The cutter, and then the launch, with the
jollyboat and others, were accordingly let over the ship's
side.</p>
<p>"While these preparations were on foot, Mr. Riou withdrew, and
wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Admiralty, which is said
to be one of the most uncommon proofs of fortitude and virtue
that ever adorned human nature. He delivered this to Mr.
Clements, and took leave of the boats as they stood away from the
ship. One of the boats, however, was stove, owing to the swell of
the sea, and only four left the Guardian. In these scarce
one-third of the company embarked; the rest chose to remain with
their heroic commander and share his fate.</p>
<p>"In this hopeless state the ship continued for some days
without a rudder and wholly unmanageable, but the application to
reduce the water in her hold was resumed whenever the weary crew
felt the return of strength and power, and thus was the Guardian
kept afloat till a Dutch packet-boat from the Spice Islands and
Batavia, providentially steering a high southerly latitude, fell
in with her, and affording her aid of men and materials enabled
her to make her way back to the Cape of Good Hope, and kept her
company during her course. The Guardian was full 400 leagues from
the Cape when she fell in with the island of ice.</p>
<p>"The longboat of the Guardian was at sea fourteen days, during
which time her wretched passengers were obliged to drink
saltwater; the consequences were, of course, dreadful in the
effects on their weak frames. A small boat in which a few
embarked, after parting, was heard of no more.</p>
<p>"Several officers remained on board, determined to share the
fate of their commander.</p>
<p>"This important intelligence was brought at a late hour on
Wednesday evening to the Admiralty by the master of a
fishing-vessel that was lying off Dungeness, and had been hailed
by the captain of a Dutch packet from the Cape in eight weeks,
who gave him a letter from Lieutenant Riou to be forwarded to the
Lords of the Admiralty.</p>
<p>"The letter which contained the particulars of this most
miraculous escape was immediately forwarded to the King, who
expressed uncommon pleasure on the occasion; and Lord Chatham
instantly set off in a post-chaise and four for Lord Camelford's
seat to congratulate with his noble relation on the safety of his
only and much-beloved son.</p>
<p>"Mr. Pitt had adopted the naval profession in positive
opposition to the wishes of his noble parent, Lord Camelford. The
voyage was ordered by an injunction to make the young gentleman
suffer all the hardships of a seaman, to deter and disgust him
from the pursuit."</p>

<h3>VOYAGE OF THE LADY JULIANA.</h3>
<p align="center"><b><small>EXTRACT</small> from a letter by one
of the female convicts transported in the Lady Juliana.*</b></p>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>
of 4th August, 1791.]</p>
<p align="right">Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, 24th July,
1790.   </p>
<p><small>WE</small> arrived here safe after a long voyage, in
very good health, thanks to our good agent,** on board, and the
gentleman in England who sent us out, as we had everything that
we could expect from them, and all our provisions were good. We
landed here 223 women and twelve children; only three women
died,*** and one child. Five or six were born on board the ship;
they had great care taken of them, and baby linen and every
necessary for them were ready made to be put on. The greatest
part of the women were immediately sent to Norfolk Island, a
place about 100 miles from here, but very bad for shipping; there
is no place to land at but in very fine weather. The Sirius,
man-of-war, was lost at this place about six or seven months ago,
when she carried some men and women from here. She landed them
all safe, but lost almost all their provisions. This place was in
a very starving condition before we arrived, and on allowance of
only 2 lb. of flour and 2 lb. of pork for each man for a week,
and these were almost starved, and could not work but three hours
in the day; they had no heart, and the ground won't grow
anything, only in spots here and there. There is a place called
Rose Hill, about twenty miles from this, where, they say, there
are four cornfields, but it does not grow much wheat; we are now
much in want of almost everything; we have hardly any cloaths;
but since the Scarborough, Neptune, and Surprize arrived we have
had a blanket and a rug given us, and we hope to have some
cloaths, as the Justinian,**** a ship that came from London with
provisions, [is] bringing some cloth and linen, and we are to
make the cloaths. Oh! if you had but seen the shocking sight of
the poor creatures that came out in the three ships it would make
your heart bleed; they were almost dead, very few could stand,
and they were obliged to fling them as you would goods, and hoist
them out of the ships, they were so feeble; and they died ten or
twelve of a day when they first landed; but some of them are
getting better. There died in their way on board the Neptune, 183
men and 12 women, and in the Scarborough, 67 men, and in the
Surprize, 85. They were not so long as we were in coming here,
but they were confined, and had bad victuals and stinking water.
The Governor was very angry, and scolded the captains a great
deal, and, I heard, intended to write to London about it, for I
heard him say it was murdering them. It, to be sure, was a
melancholy sight. What a difference between us and them. God
bless our good agent (I don't mean the captain). We had no reason
to complain against him for anything; all our provisions and
cloaths were good. I don't think I ever shall get away from this
place to come again to see you without an order from England, for
some of the men's times were out, and they went and spoke to the
Governor of it, and told him that they would not work. He told
them he could not send them home without orders from London, and
if they would not work they should have nothing to eat, so they
almost all went again to work, except ten, who were saucy, and
the Governor ordered them a good flogging; but all that came from
London in the First Fleet time will be out in less than two
years' time. I hope you will try to get an order for me, that I
may once more see you all.</p>

<h3>FORGOTTEN BY GOVERNMENT.</h3>
<p align="center"><b><small>EXTRACT</small> of a letter from
Botany Bay.*</b></p>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>
of 8th September, 1791]</p>
<p align="right">Port Jackson, New South Wales, 7th August,
1790.   </p>
<p><small>I AM</small> truly surprised that I have not heard from
you by the last fleet from England, which arrived here in June,
very sickly, though their voyage was a very short one. Before now
you must be acquainted with the loss of his Majesty's ship the
Guardian, by which every person in this settlement is a very
great sufferer; for my own part, a few letters excepted, I have
not received anything sent by her. By the Supply, which sailed to
Batavia in April last for supplies, to prevent us from starving,
I wrote you a long letter, to which I refer you, as I have
nothing to add but that most unexpectedly we were relieved by the
arrival of the Lady Juliana, Justinian, Neptune, Scarborough, and
Surprize, transports, from the most distressed and starving
condition that ever people were in.</p>
<p>Indeed, before the arrival of these ships, we really thought
that Government had forgotten us. I am sure, if they were well
informed of the badness of the country we are placed in, which of
itself affords less resources than any in the known world, they
would not have been so very tardy in sending to know what was
become of us. Had it not been for a trip that the Sirius, before
she was left on Norfolk Island, made to the Cape of Good Hope to
bring us six months' flour, we should have, long before the
arrival of the fleet, been food for the crows; for when the
transports came into this port, and for three months before, we
were reduced to so low a ration of provisions as four ounces of
pork and the same quantity of flour and rice per day, every other
species of provisions being long expended.</p>
<p>I wish I could say something in favour of this place, which I
can by no means do consistent with truth. I am told by the
officer of the [New] South Wales Corps that in England the
reports with respect to this country are flattering and
favourable. I am sure whoever gave that account cannot be an
honest man, or regard truth, which, to their sorrow, I believe,
they are already convinced of.</p>

<h3>LIEUTENANT KING'S ACCOUNT.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Public Advertiser</i>
of the 23rd December, 1790.]</p>
<p><small>THE</small> despatches from the new colony of Botany
Bay were brought by Lieut. King,** of the Navy, commanding at
Norfolk Island, in New South Wales, who went in the Supply,
tender, from Botany Bay to Batavia, from thence came to Europe in
a Dutch East Indiaman, and landed on Sunday at Harwich.
Government has received samples of its produce of wheat, barley,
and rice, all of which are of the finest quality, and very
abundant in their growth. The harvest of last year already
produced 300 bushels of corn.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Lieutenant King arrived in London on 21st
December, 1790.&mdash;Vol. i, part 2, p. 428.]</p>
<p>The report of the natives having shewn an unfriendly
disposition to our Government, and that skirmishes between our
settlers and them have occurred, is without the smallest
foundation. A principal chief among the natives lives with
Governor Phillip in his house, and a native female lives as
servant to the chaplain. They are convinced of the superiority of
the British Government, and shew no signs of resistance.</p>
<p>The settlement was in no great want of provisions when Lieut.
King left it. A further supply from Europe might be expected to
arrive at Botany Bay about six weeks after Lieut. King's
departure, as the storeships which left England last November had
arrived at the Cape and sailed again.</p>
<p>The allowance to each convict was 2 lb. of pork, 4 lb. of
flour, and 7 lb. of rice per week, besides fish, which are caught
in abundance. This portion of food is in every respect ample.
There was abundance of cloathing.</p>
<p>In addition to the supplies that might be expected front
England, that sent by Lieut. Riou from the Cape would likewise
arrive soon after Mr. King left Botany Bay.</p>
<p>We are sorry to conclude this account by informing the public
of the loss of the Sirius, sloop-of-war, of ten guns, Capt. J.
Hunter, which had been sent from Botany Bay to Norfolk Island,
where she was at anchor when a violent gale of wind came on,
which obliged her crew to drive her on shore, and she was
entirely lost. There were few or no stores in her, and all the
crew were saved.</p>

<h3>CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN THE YEAR 1790.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Dublin Chronicle</i>

<p align="center"><i>The Old Bailey Sessions for 1790.</i></p>
<p><small>ONLY</small> twenty-eight (of the number of capital
convictions in the year 1790) were executed, a far less number
than we can find upon record for some years back; but then it
must be remembered that only a week or two ago not less than
forty-eight of the capital convicts were pardoned on condition of
going to Botany Bay, which they all accepted, save only one
woman. During the summer, likewise, a similar pardon was tendered
to several capital convicts, and accepted by all but two, who
preferred hanging, and were immediately gratified with the object
of their choice.</p>

<h3>STATE OF THE COLONY, 1790.</h3>
<p align="center"><b><small>EXTRACT</small> from a letter by a
Surgeon's Mate at Botany Bay.**</b></p>
<p class="source">[** Reprinted from the <i>Dublin Chronicle</i>
of 13th January, 1791.]</p>
<p><small>IT</small> is now so long since we have heard from home
that our clothes are worn threadbare. We begin to think the
mother country has entirely forsaken us. As for shoes, my stock
has been exhausted these six months, and I have been obliged
since that time to beg and borrow among the gentlemen, for no
such article was to be bought. In this deplorable situation
famine is staring us in the face. Two ounces of pork is the
allowance of animal food for four-and-twenty hours, and happy is
the man that can kill a rat or crow to make him a dainty meal. We
have raised some excellent vegetables, but such food, without the
mixture of the animal, does not supply strength, but keeps us lax
and weakly. I dined most heartily the other day on a fine dog,
and hope I shall soon again have an invitation to a similar
repast. The animals that were meant to stock the country are
almost all butchered. Hunger will be appeased while any eatable
remains.</p>
<p>Several of the convicts have perished by the hands of the
natives, by rambling too far into the woods. I accompanied two of
our gentlemen on a shooting party. We penetrated near thirty
miles in two days over a delightful country, free from underwood,
when we arrived at a rapid river that was not fordable.* On the
other side the country seemed to be in a state of romantic and
uncultivated nature. The landscape was finished by a range of
hills that rise one above another, in a very grand style, to a
considerable height.</p>

such short allowance, being obliged to supply the party a second
time from the common stock. To prevent murmuring, officers and

remarkable, women who were supposed past child-bearing, and
others who had not been pregnant for fifteen or sixteen years,
have lately become mothers.</p>

<p><small>OUR</small> departure from Newgate was so sudden it was
utterly impossible to leave you even a single word. We had not
the least notice of it till four o'clock in the morning; and
before we could well get the better of the shock three hundred
and nineteen of us were conveyed to the river-side. Dreadful
reflection! The unfortunate wretches were all of them loaded with
irons and chained together except me, who was permitted to walk
unfettered between the Sheriff and Mr. Akerman, whose humanity to
me will long be remembered.</p>
<p>You may be sure I have often pictured to myself the state of
your mind upon finding me dragged away without our seeing one
another at parting! But such are the laws of our country! It has,
however, given me infinitely more pain and misery than the
punishment itself. The many years' endearment, the fond
affections of a father, and all the flattering hopes of a
reclaimed life, in case I had been fortunate enough to have
escaped on my late trial, crowded before me, and made me anxious,
indeed, to have remained with you and my dear child, and to have
continued an useful member of society&mdash;at least, to have bid
a short adieu to you and the public. With respect to the prospect
before me, sad and distressing as it may appear, all may
ultimately be for our good. With the best of hearts and best of
dispositions there is, God knows, an overbearing fate that
counteracts our best designs, and makes us act (that is
pickpockets) in spite of ourselves. But no more of that. It is
now too late for me to reason.</p>
<p>Pray remember me to Charles H&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;and
the rest of my friends, and let me see you and my child as soon
as possible, agreeable to the directions in the postcript
hereof.***</p>

<h3>IRISH CONVICTS.*</h3>

<p align="right">3rd March, 1791.   </p>
<p><small>THE</small> number of convicts sent off from the new
prison last week, in order to be conveyed to Cork, and there to
join the Botany Bay fleet,** amounted to sixty men and fifteen
women. The military guard was 100 men and two commissioned
officers. It was remarkable that most of the women seemed to have
less feeling for their situation than the men; and Rositer, the
woman who had been condemned to die for robbing one of the rooms
at the Linenhall, called out to the soldier to clear the way till
she mounted her landau. Carr, who was also lately under
condemnation of death, formed part of the above number.</p>

hair, and between the soles of their shoes, for the purpose of
sawing off their irons.</p>
<p>This strategem was discovered by one of the convicts having on
a very old pair of shoes, and the saw was discovered through the
openness of the sole. A general search was then made, and upwards
of 200 convicts had saws found on them.</p>

<h3>A LETTER FROM SYDNEY.***</h3>
<p class="source">[*** Reprinted from <i>The Bee</i> of 15th May,
1792. <i>Note by Editor</i>:&mdash;"Authentic advices from Sydney
Cove, New South Wales, being an extract of a letter obligingly
communicated to the editor by a gentleman of eminence in
Britain." <i>The Bee</i> was an Edinburgh weekly paper.]</p>
<p align="right">24th March, 1791.   </p>
<p><small>IN</small> my last to you, by way of Batavia, I
endeavoured to inform you of our wretched condition here, and
acquainted you that we had unanimously resolved to lengthen out
the scanty remains of our provision by our united exertions in
gardening, fishing, &amp;c. By the diligent use of such means we
did not despair of being able to hold out until the Supply should
return from Batavia. But we had dropped all thought of receiving
any relief from England for a considerable time, as we judged
that such ships as might have sailed for this port were
unfortunately lost. Our savings in the public store were but very
small, for all we could do, but still we continued cheerful, and
resolved to persevere.</p>
<p>We were preparing to commemorate the birthday of our Royal
master with his Excellency the Governor, when, about three in the
afternoon of the third of June, the flag at the entrance of the
harbour was displayed as a signal for a ship in sight; and in the
evening of the same day the ship Lady Juliana came safely to an
anchor in the lower part of the harbour. The glad tidings were
soon communicated through our little town, and received with
great joy and gratitude; and our pleasure was increased by the
assurance of his Majesty's perfect recovery from a late alarming
and almost fatal illness. A day of thanksgiving to God for his
happy recovery was ordered to be given here, and an address was
drawn up, to which we about all signed our names, and presented
it to the Governor to be forwarded to England.</p>
<p>We are now informed that his Majesty's ship Guardian had
struck an island of ice on her passage hither, and with the
utmost difficulty returned back to the Cape of Good Hope, with
the loss of some lives, all the cattle, and the greatest part of
both public and private property. This unfortunate accident,
which happened in December, 1789, confirmed our suspicions of
some mischance intervening, and reducing us to the severe
distresses which we suffered.</p>
<p>The Lady Juliana had on board two hundred and twenty-five
female convicts, with two years' provisions for them only; so
that, saving the glad tidings of other ships being forwarded on
their passage here, we had little to expect from any relief she
could give us. They were remarkably healthy throughout the
voyage, most likely from the judicious plan of affording them
tea, sugar, and soap, with frequent refreshments by the way.
Cleanliness and comforts ought to be attended to rigidly on a
passage so distant and dangerous as this is, or many lives will
certainly be sacrificed.</p>
<p>We were entertaining ourselves with the abundance of news
which had transpired, and anticipating the arrival of supplies,
which we were given to understand could not be far distant, when,
on Sunday, the 20th of June, the Justinian, of London, arrived
safe in the cove, after a passage of five months only, loaded
with provisions for the settlement. This seasonable relief
brought us full allowance, and dispelled that gloom and fear of
famine which had been likely to visit us.</p>
<p>By this ship we learned that part of the corps raised for the
service of this country were forwarded in their passage in three
transports, having on board a considerable body of convicts; and
that the major-commandant* would shortly follow in his Majesty's
ship Gorgon, with the remaining part of the troops. The marines,
who are to be relieved by the new corps, feel great satisfaction
at the prospect of getting home; but they are surprised to learn
that the cause of their being relieved is attributed to
disagreements among the officers. That very unpleasant
differences have taken place between their commandant and the
Governor we are all well aware of. Who is right or who is wrong
will certainly hereafter be made known. But it is a grievous
hardship that unconcerned individuals should, by
misrepresentation, be involved in such affairs, or be deprived of
that merit which is so dearly bought by their services in this
country.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Francis Grose.]</p>
<p>Much credit is due to Mr. Maitland, the master of the
Justinian, for his expedition on the voyage, which he assured us
would have been completed in four months but for the untoward and
boisterous weather he met with on this coast. This ship was
followed by the Surprize on the 26th of June, and by the Neptune
and Scarborough, transports, on the 29th, all of them after a
passage of little more than five months.</p>
<p>The Neptune embarked two officers of the troops and forty-two
soldiers; 433 male convicts, seventy-eight female; six convicts'
wives, free women; and thirteen children. They lost on the
passage 162, and landed 269 sick at the hospital. The Surprize
had on board two officers and thirty-eight troops, one of whom
died on the passage; and 252 male convicts, forty-two of whom
died on the passage, and 126 were landed at the hospital.</p>
<p>The Scarborough had two officers and thirty-four soldiers, and
256 male convicts, sixty-eight of whom died on the passage, and
ninety-six were landed sick at the hospital. And in spite of
every effort to relieve the afflicted, 124 of them have since
fallen victims to disease.</p>
<p>It was shocking to behold the deplorable condition to which
the poor wretches were reduced by dysentery and scurvy. The
liberal supply of hospital stores enabled us to assist them with
some comforts as well as medicines. But the miserable state to
which the poor wretches were reduced by perpetual confinement
below throughout the passage put it beyond the power of art to
restore many of them. The sole direction of them on board was
left to the masters of transports, who, either from inclination
or a want of knowledge, denied them those indulgences which might
have been a means of preserving their health, or at least of
preventing so great a mortality.</p>
<p>The Justinian and Surprize were ordered to be cleared as fast
as possible, that they might carry a supply of stores and an
additional number of people to Norfolk Island. We entertained
many doubts with respect to their situation at that place; and,
unfortunately for us, we had no prospect of making ourselves
acquainted with their state before the return of the Supply from
Batavia, as the ships on clearing at that port were to proceed
immediately to China. I shall not attempt to describe the
confusion that existed at that time in our colony.</p>
<p>The Governor now perceived the necessity of providing
habitations for the people that had disembarked, as well as those
that were expected soon to follow; for the little conveniences
that had been raised, chiefly at the expence and labor of the
first colonists, were everywhere crowded by the newcomers, both
bond and free; and it was said that no houses could be considered
as the private property of any individual on the settlement.</p>
<p>Our new guests expressed great concern at not finding
everything here in a very prosperous state. They had been led to
believe that matters were in a very fair train, and that plenty
of conveniences were ready for their reception at landing; but
they found quite the contrary to be the case.</p>
<p>His Excellency has ordered a town to be erected as fast as
possible at Rosehill, and has employed all the artificers on that
duty. They have already got up about a hundred huts, of one
story, twenty-five feet long by twelve broad each. The streets
are to be two hundred feet wide, and each hut is to be furnished
with some garden-ground backwards. Upon the whole, the plan seems
to be made the most regular of any yet laid down at this
place.</p>
<p>Since the arrival of ships, the following terms have been
offered to settlers, viz.:&mdash;To every non-commissioned
officer, an allotment of one hundred and thirty acres of land, if
single; and of one hundred and sixty, if married. To every
private soldier, an allotment of eighty acres, if single; and of
one hundred, if married. And an allotment of ten acres of land to
every child of such non-commissioned officer or private soldier
as may choose to settle. Such allotments to be free of all fees,
taxes, quit-rents, and other acknowledgments, for the space of
ten years, but after the expiration of that time to be liable to
an annual quit-rent of one shilling for every fifty acres.</p>
<p>His Majesty has, likewise, willed that a bounty of three
pounds per man be offered to each non-commissioned officer or
private man who may be disposed to continue in this country and
enlist in the corps appointed for the service of New South Wales.
And, should their behaviour be good, they shall, after a further
service of five years, be entitled to a double proportion of land
than would be granted them, provided they quit the service at the
relief of the marines, free of all taxes, fees, quit-rents,
&amp;c., for the space of fifteen years; subject, however, after
that time to the same acknowledgments as before. His Majesty has
also willed, as a further encouragement to the above description
of men, that upon their being discharged or relieved, or after a
further service of five years in the new corps, they shall
receive, out of the public stores, a proportion of clothing for
one year, together with a suitable proportion of seeds and grain
for the tillage of land, and a proportion of tools and implements
proper for their use, for that time. And when any of them can
feed and clothe such a number of convicts as may be judged
necessary for their use, for the time being, to assist them in
clearing and cultivating the soil, the service of such convicts
shall be assigned to them.</p>
<p>No proposal has been made to any of the officers, civil or
military, nor do I hear that any of those to whom they have been
made have, as yet, resolved on accepting them.* The country, for
all we have yet been able to observe, is not by any means
favourable to our wishes. Some of the free men, who are
considered as judges in farming, report the land at Rosehill to
be light and sandy, and equal to such as would be let at 15s. an
acre within three miles of Lewis, in Sussex, but at a distance
from a market-town not above half as much. And, on making a
calculation of the average price of land about High Wycomb, in
Bucks, they find, by three or four thousand acres, that it lets,
on an average, at 19s. 6d. per acre&mdash;not more. The tenant,
besides, pays the church and poor rates; the poor rates amount to
about 1s. 6d., the church to about 8s. in the pound. This land is
much better than the average land about Rosehill. These
circumstances, added to the scarcity of fresh water, want of
cattle, and the proper means of agriculture, together with the
bad returns that have as yet been obtained from the different
crops, are, I think, prognostics that very little advantage can
be obtained from this country, or that it can maintain its new
inhabitants within a great length of time, and without a very
great expence to the nation.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The answers of the principal officers to the
proposal to remain in the colony will be found on p. 201 of Vol.
i, part 2.]</p>
<p>The return of grain this season from Rosehill, which is the
only farm in cultivation for the public, has not, from all I can
learn, been more than threefold and a-half, if so much; perhaps,
in some measure, owing to the very great drought which has
prevailed this season. But it is feared little can be expected
from it at best; for the farmer, on the part of Government, says
he sowed forty-five bushels of wheat in maiden land at that place
last year, and reaped six or seven fold only. He expected a much
better return this season, from the ground being longer opened,
but is disappointed; and he has since declared that very little
can be expected in future unless cattle can be procured
sufficient to manure it. Two hundred and ninety-three acres of
land are now cleared of the timber at Rosehill, but the roots are
all left in the ground&mdash;a circumstance that must prevent the
labouring of the land by any other means than that of the spade
or hoe until they are removed, which is a work I fear cannot be
accomplished.</p>
<p>The coast has not as yet been examined by us further to the
southward than Botany Bay, or to the northward than Broken Bay;
but several excursions have been made into the country by some of
the officers, whose judgment can be depended upon. They all agree
in thinking it unfit for almost any purpose. They have for the
most part found it rugged and unkindly, and complain of a very
great scarcity of water. What they have met with is generally
contained in stagnant pools, which seem to be reservoirs for
rainwater. Sometimes there is a continuation of them for a little
distance; and after very heavy rains they frequently communicate
with each other, and then send out a stream through some of the
adjacent vallies, which ceases to run shortly after the rain has
ceased to fall.</p>
<p>It is impossible to tell what could have occasioned the
description of Botany Bay that appears in the voyages of Captain
Cook. The meadowland, after the most minute examination, is found
to be nothing but a perfect quagmire. In short, so totally
different is it from what has been said of it that had it not
been for the latitude and longitude, which are accurately laid
down, we should not have known the place from the account given
of it.</p>
<p>Of Norfolk Island, I can only speak from hearsay. The return
of the Supply from Batavia has given us a late opportunity of
knowing something of their state at that place, which we find to
have been much worse than ours before the ships arrived. And had
they not been fortunate enough to save the greatest part of the
provisions from the wreck of the Sirius, they would have been
left with not more than six weeks' provisions at the utmost to
subsist upon. The soil at that place is said to be good, and the
climate a healthy one; but both the wood and the flax, which were
so much spoken of, are neither of them objects of much
consideration. The flax grows only on points jutting out to the
sea; and the pinetree, as it is called, is found to be so brittle
as to render it unfit for masts and many other purposes. Besides,
the necessity of clearing the island for the maintenance of its
inhabitants precludes a possibility of applying more of the
timber than now stands to any public purpose, or of cultivating a
sufficient quantity of the flaxplant to be of any service. But to
what purpose retain a spot situated in the middle of the ocean,
and at such a distance from England, when it is seldom possible
for any vessel to approach it in safety from the dreadful surf
which in general lashes its shore; where there is no kind of
shelter even for a boat, nor any place of anchorage to be
depended upon; and, in fine, whose utmost extent does not exceed
five miles in length and three in breadth. In addition to the
wreck of the Sirius and former losses which have happened there,
a boat unloading one of the transports, with seven people, was
destroyed in the presence of the inhabitants, who had it not in
their power to give them any assistance, although within a few
yards of the spot, so suddenly did the surf get up.</p>
<p>Three years have elapsed in January last since our arrival in
this country, and, saving a chance meal, the chief of our diet
has been salt meat, and that sometimes in very reduced
quantities.</p>
<p>The state we were in when the dispatches went from this place
in the Supply sternly threatens us again, there being no more
than seven months' provision now in store at the present
allowance, which must in the course of a month, if no ships
arrive, be reduced to two-thirds, and shortly after that to
one-half (or perhaps less), if no relief appears. We have little
to look to from our granaries; and the live stock, which consists
of goats, pigs, and poultry, are so degenerate and few in number
from want of food that the whole would not afford the colony two
days' subsistence.</p>
<p>What can have become of the Gorgon,* with Major Grose and the
rest of the troops, baffles all conjectures. The detachment under
Captain Nepean have been here now eight months in daily
expectation of their arrival. I am afraid it is our fate to be
very unfortunate.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Gorgon was detained in England until 15th
March, 1791.]</p>
<p>The new corps seem to have come out without being well
acquainted with their situation at this place. It is said they
are to pay threepence per day for their ration, and to have no
spirits allowed them. If so, their case is pitiable.</p>
<p>It is probable Government does not intend to continue the
allowance of spirits any longer, for, except a three months'
proportion, which has lately been served, there has not been any
issued for eight months past. The soldiers feel the want of that
article very much, as they live but poorly, and have been long
accustomed to the use of it.</p>
<p>Much cannot be said respecting the natives; their wretched
manner of life is a proof, among the many others, of the
wretchedness of their country. They have lately been persuaded to
trust themselves amongst us, and their desire for food, without
being at the trouble of collecting it, has induced them to
continue their intercourse. Previous, however, to this
connection, his Excellency, from reposing too great confidence in
them, had nearly lost his life by a wound from one of their
spears, and his gamekeeper has since been killed by one of them
at Botany Bay. These are, I think, the only accidents that have
happened lately, and I think it is likely our attention to them
will be the means of preventing any happening in future.</p>
<p>Five convicts, who had previously furnished themselves with a
few provisions and necessaries, made their escape from this place
in a small open boat. We apprehend their intention was to reach
some of the East India islands, but they were, upon the whole, so
badly appointed that it is very improbable they could have
survived long.</p>
<p>Detaining and punishing the convicts for attempting to get
away after their terms of transportation have expired has
occasioned much murmuring and discontent among them, and will no
doubt impel them to attempt their liberty, however dismal or
distant the prospect of obtaining it may be.</p>
<p>I send this by Mr. Worgan, surveyor [surgeon] of his Majesty's
ship Sirius, who returns to England in the Dutch vessel that
brought us a little better than two months' provisions from
Batavia. He is a young gentleman of approved character and
merit.</p>
<p>If you condescend to receive this and give him a hearing, you
will receive a very just account of our situation in this
colony.</p>
<p>Much also may be expected from Captain Hunter, whose virtue
and integrity is as conspicuous as his merit; and his officers,
who are for the most part men of respectable characters, can from
real experience describe the sterile territory of New South
Wales.</p>

<h3>LETTER FROM A FEMALE CONVICT.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Dublin Chronicle</i>
of 1st November, 1791, the editor of which described it as a
"letter from one of the female convicts to a gentleman in
England, who had exerted himself very humanely in her behalf to
get her the liberty of transporting herself and family to
America, though without success, giving an account of her passage
to St. Jago, on her way to New South Wales."]</p>
<p align="right">St. Jago, 29th March, 1791.   </p>
<p>Most Honoured Sir,</p>
<p>Your past kindness to me induces me to trouble you with some
account of where I am, and what kind of voyage I have had; the
latter, however, cannot be a very favourable one, for we have
been surrounded by danger. We sailed from Portsmouth the 23rd of
February, with the wind much against us, and were so much in
danger that we feared we should have shared the fate of a ship
which was lost within sight of us. Our good captain very kindly
dropped anchor at the Nore, but did not stop more than one night,
and sailed for the Downs, where we sent our pilot on shore. On
the 25th and 26th, along the coast, we had a violent storm, which
lasted twenty-four hours. During every moment of its continuance
we expected to perish, and were washed out of our beds between
decks, while the sea-sickness and the groans and shrieks of so
many unhappy wretches made the situation we were in truly
distressing, for there were 138 women and five children, two of
the latter born after we sailed, and one only died on our passage
hither, where we remain no longer than is necessary to repair the
ship and take in water. Our captain hopes we shall arrive at
Botany Bay in August, if it please God the weather should prove
favourable. This is a very fine island, supposed to be very rich,
but the inhabitants I have seen are principally blacks. The
general produce is poultry, hogs, and goats, which are very fine
of their kind; and rich fruits, such as oranges, melons, &amp;c.,
are very plentiful and cheap. The 16th of March we crossed the
Line, where we were dipped in a tub of salt-water by the sailors,
and tarred all over, it being a rule amongst them to make every
one pay so much money or undergo this, and we all shared the same
fate. I have been greatly distressed for want of money, because I
came away without being able to see my husband.</p>
<p>If, sir, you have any success in your application for my
pardon, you can send it me by any of the captains coming out to
Botany Bay, which, I am sure, your goodness will endeavour to do
for the sake of my motherless children; they are the only cause
of my anxiety and unhappiness. I hope your generous exertions,
aided by the goodness of God, will one day restore me to them;
yet, whether you succeed or not, that God, I sincerely hope, will
reward you&mdash;fully reward you&mdash;for your past unequalled
kindness to me. Pray, sir, be good enough to let my husband know
you have had a letter from me, and beg him to take care of my
dear children. I think it hard I did not see him before I sailed,
for we laid a week at Gravesend, and I should have left my
country less sorrowfully had I given him my last charges and bade
him farewell.</p>
<p>If you will send to me, sir, direct it to be left for me at
Governor Phillip's, New South Wales, and say anything in behalf
of my character&mdash;it will serve me much; and if you can write
immediately, the letter will be there before me, and mention that
I am coming in the Mary Ann, Captain Murrow [Monroe], because
your recommendation, in the most trifling degree, will do me
great service on my arrival.</p>
<p>I hope you will excuse my being so troublesome to you. I sent
you two letters from Gravesend, and mentioned my going to send
one by the Barra, but as the man never came I hope you did not
send anything. You, sir, are the only friend I ever had in my
afflictions, and I remember your goodness without grief, except
when I reflect that I have no reward to offer you but my humble
thanks.</p>
<p>We are much better off than we expected, and have as much
liberty as our unhappy situation possibly allows. I am much
better in my health than I have been for some time, and with
God's assistance and yours I do not despair of yet living to be a
comfort to my children. This, sir, is the only prayer for herself
in the heart of one bound in duty and by gratitude to pray for
you and your family as long as her life and heart have power to
think of or utter a prayer to God, and who is your most humble
and obedient servant,</p>
<p align="right"><small>MARY TALBOT.</small>   </p>
<p>We have given the above unfortunate woman's letter a place in
our paper, as her case is of that nature to interest us in her
behalf. It appears that she was tried for stealing a piece of
linen from a shop in Tavistock-street (the only theft she says
she ever committed), and was sentenced for seven years'
transportation. When the vessel was at Gravesend, a man, whose
wife was a convict, contrived by a boat to get them on shore from
the ship, and she was retaken some time after, and sentence of
death pronounced for returning from transportation before her
time; but after laying in Newgate near a year, received his
Majesty's pardon on condition on going to Botany Bay for life,
which she refused at the bar on account of not being permitted to
take her children with her, and was taken back to Newgate in
strong convulsions, and her shrieks were re-echoed through the
whole gaol. The occasion of her committing the theft, from her
own and her husband's account, was as follows:&mdash;They were
natives of Ireland. He was by trade a stonemason, but on coming
to England entered into the service of a merchant in Austin
Friars, where he continued till after they were married, when he
returned to his trade, and had worked with a stonemason at the
west end of the town, near two years, when he had the misfortune
to have a stone fall on him, and was carried to St. Thomas's
hospital; that during the time he was there, having nothing to
support herself and children, she committed the theft for which
she was convicted; that fearing it might disgrace her husband she
was tried by her maiden name; that after she escaped she secreted
herself till her husband could procure means of their returning
to Ireland; but venturing out one evening she was recognised by
one of the gaol-runners, and unfortunately taken hold of.</p>

<h3>MUTINY ON THE ALBEMARLE.*</h3>

repulsed and driven to take refuge in the hold and in their
prison-room. Some of them were wounded. In the search after the
ringleaders we admitted one of them King's evidence, and he
confessed the circumstances of the whole design. After they were
subdued it was unanimously agreed by the officers and crew that
it was expedient to hang up the two ringleaders at the yard-arm,
which was accordingly put in execution. There were no ships in
sight at the time they rose. One of the ringleaders was an
American. Two of the crew, who were accomplices in the
insurrection, were set on shore here, not considering it safe to
proceed with such treacherous villains on board the ship. We are
one and all armed day and night, and keep the most vigilant
look-out over the convicts, six of whom have died since our
departure from England. To-morrow we sail for St. Jago, the place
of general rendezvous; there we shall stay a few days, and then
take our departure for [New] South Wales.</p>
<p>Our passage hither from the Lizard has been extremely
boisterous; we have been twenty-five days buffeting it with
contrary winds for the most part of the way. My four consorts
have parted company; some from stress of weather, others
designedly.</p>

<h3>GEORGE BARRINGTON TO A GENTLEMAN IN THE COUNTY OF
YORK.***</h3>
<p class="source">[*** Reprinted from the <i>Western County
Magazine</i> for 1792.]</p>
<p align="right">Cape of Good Hope, 1st July, 1791.   </p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I anticipate the surprise you must feel at the receipt of a
letter from this part of the Globe, but I am inclined to hope it
will prove an agreeable surprise. I have reason to conclude that
my old friend <i>report</i>, with its usual accuracy, its
particular attention to every matter which concerns me, has
pronounced me totally lost, or, to use a sea phrase, that I am by
this time <i>safe in Davy Jones's locker</i>; a time, therefore,
that brings you authentic intelligence to the contrary may not be
quite unacceptable. You have favoured me with some share of your
esteem, and you will do me the justice to believe that I cannot
be insensible to your merit; and I assure you, dear sir, that
about this time twelvemonth I had flattered myself strongly with
the agreeable hope of renewing some or those convivial hours I
have had the pleasure of passing with you. But how uncertain are
all human expectations! How soon are the brightest prospects
clouded! And what sudden, surprising revolutions will sometimes
happen in the affairs of nations, as well as individuals! If ever
there was a man who seemed destined to encounter difficulties,
and to struggle with disappointments, that man is myself. At the
very moment I was going to Doncaster some unlooked for
circumstances frustrated my intention, so I commissioned an
acquaintance, who was passing that way, to call on you, with my
respects, and the cash you were so kind as to advance some time
before on my account. He assured me he would not fail, and I hope
he has been punctual. A month had scarcely elapsed afterwards
when the unfortunate affair took place which has compelled me to
become a circumnavigator. Perhaps I am wrong to call it
unfortunate&mdash;perhaps all is best that happens; but I leave
you to judge, sir, what I must feel when we weighed anchor at
Spithead, and our sails swelled with that wind which was to waft
me, for ever, perhaps, from everything that was dear to man. God
knows what a number of painful circumstances I had then to
combat; but surely they were sufficient to dismay the stoutest
heart. If I was not pennyless, I was, at least, next door to it,
not being possessed of a dozen guineas, including cash,
necessaries, and property of every kind. What a stock for so vast
a voyage! What a provision to carry me from one part of the world
to the other, and to lay a foundation for future subsistence! I
was, at the same time, in so impaired a state of health as to
damn the probability that I should survive a month in so
comfortless a condition. These, however, were the least of my
afflictions: yet it was then I found what the heart was capable
of enduring&mdash;what amazing resources it could strike out to
support itself under the worst embarrassments. Till that hour I
never thoroughly knew that the mind was indeed a kingdom in
itself; it told me that life, at the best, was nothing more than
a voyage or a journey, and, however rough to some, or smooth to
others, the road might prove, it must still have an end; and
where was the difference then?</p>
<p>The world imagined I had done it some injury; but however it
might have been magnified by the tongue of detraction, the
balance between us in that respect was more equal than was
generally supposed, for I also had met some injuries, and those
of as harsh a nature as any I ever inflicted. But complaint was
childish, and I knew it was by manly fortitude, not petulant
repining, that great difficulties were to be surmounted. The ills
I had done, or the ills I had received, were come to a crisis. My
own misconduct I might regret, and time possibly might repair,
but I could not recall it. And the injuries I had received in the
course of my life had always proceeded from persons who were not
worth casting away a thought upon. So I banished from my mind
every idle vexatious idea, and every emotion of resentment and
ill-nature. You, virtuous Europeans, I hope, will not be less
generous than a poor banished sinner; you will pardon me, I
trust, the many ruffianly deeds I have done, the many friends I
have betrayed, the many houses I have fired, the many murders I
have committed, and the many treasons I have conspired against my
sovereign and the nation. To be serious, sir, I left England and
Europe without a spark of malevolence in my mind against any
creature whatever, wishing every good heart as much happiness as
it could wish itself, and every bad one to become better,
perfectly resigned to whatever might happen, and not without hope
in the kindness of Providence. With this temper I committed
myself to the winds and waves, and with this temper I hope I
shall descend to the grave, and I am very easy about where that
grave may happen, whether in Europe, in New South Wales, or in
the bosom of the ocean. To my thinking, it is of little
consequence where the <i>residuum</i> lies, if the <i>spirit</i>
ascends to Heaven.</p>
<p>We have now been three months and two days at sea, without
putting into, or almost without seeing, any land till we arrived
here. It has pleased God to preserve me in a wonderful manner,
under such complicated affliction as I had to struggle with, and
our voyage, so far, has exceeded my most sanguine expectations. I
find myself now, at the Cape of Good Hope, in much better health
than when I left England, and in suitable spirits&mdash;in as
composed, if not chearful, spirits as ever I was in my life. The
gout and rheumatism, with that dreadful disorder the scurvy,
which too often makes such havoc at sea, I never had a touch of;
and still, thank Heaven, am as great a stranger to them as ever,
as far as relates to myself. I have had no illness of any sort
since we sailed, not even an hour of the usual sea-sickness; and
I know you will feel pleasure from hearing that it has pleased
God to raise me up valuable friends even in this remote
region.</p>
<p>Our ship is moored at present in a fine bay, completely
sheltered on all sides by hills and mountains of various figures,
forming a singular and very romantic view. Here we take in water,
vegetables, and every other refreshment so agreeable to people
who have been a long time at sea, and especially to those who
have been used to the comforts of what is generally called good
living. Here is tolerable beef, and as fine well-fed mutton as
ever I saw in England. A very large sheep, which we have laid in
for the use of our mess, cost four dollars. As for such
vegetables as carrots, cabbages, and onions, they are not to be
excelled in any part of the world; and the same may be said of
the fruits, particularly sweet oranges and pears, as fine and by
many degrees the largest I ever saw before. Yet it is now the
very depth of what they call winter; though, from the beautiful
verdure of the cultivated spots, and the mildness of the ambient
air, an Englishman would be apt to conclude it was spring
entering into summer. I have drank your health in a bumper of
choice Cape wine, and you were sometimes remembered during the
voyage&mdash;over a can of grog. You will scarcely believe, sir,
that arrack, so much esteemed in Europe, can be laid in here for
half-a-crown per gallon; such, however, is the cordial fact.
There are in the bay with us two ships (which have been at Port
Jackson with people, have since touched at China, and are now on
their return to England), the Lady Juliana and Neptune, which
afford us an excellent opportunity of writing home. But, why
should I say <i>home</i>? What is England, or Ireland, or
Scotland to me now? Though I wish their prosperity as much as the
richest of their inhabitants, yet that is my country where I can
find content; and content is confined to no particular
country&mdash;it may be excluded from a palace, it may be found
in a wilderness. Thank Heaven, I am not much influenced by local
prejudices. The nearer we approach the destined land, where, in
length of time, <i>every man is to sit under the shade of his own
vine and his own fig-tree</i>, the more favourable the account
becomes; but I shall suspend my opinion till I can judge from my
own observation. There is no doubt but the country is very
romantic, and the air salubrious, and these are material points.
It is expected that in less than two months we shall arrive
there.</p>
<p>You find, dear sir, that though in a state of captivity, I am
still possessed of two of life's greatest blessings&mdash;health
and a tranquil mind. Sweet Hope, like a faithful companion, has
constantly attended me in all my troubles, and still continues
unshaken by my side. And why should I despair, who am yet in the
prime of years? The united efforts of falsehood, malice, and
rancour have not been able to deprive me of life or
health&mdash;of the esteem and good wishes of the liberal part of
the world&mdash;or even of that firmness of mind which the smiles
of Fortune cannot give and her frowns cannot take away. I have
the satisfaction to know that my heart never was by any means so
black as some blacker hearts have suggested; and as for my life,
it is in the care of Providence. Death is the grand ultimatum of
the wealth and the poverty, the pleasure and the pain, of this
world; this must happen to every one, and they who live longest
will, perhaps, have most reason to say that 'tis "All vanity and
vexation of spirit." How many did I leave behind in Europe in
ample possession of beauty, youth, health, and splendour, who
have since experienced, by the gripe of death, how vain a thing
life is.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope, dear sir, that you and the whole of your
amiable family are hearty and well. If wishes had power, mine
would not be wanting to make you as happy as your own desire. But
you have one of the greatest possessions in the world&mdash;a
worthy heart; with it a man cannot be very unhappy in the
roughest storm of adversity, and without it you may depend that
riches, titles, and success can impart but an empty satisfaction.
If I live till New Year's Day, I will drink your health at the
antipodes, though it be but in the crystal element. I have
sometimes done it in a more exhilarating, though not, perhaps, in
a more safe or wholesome, beverage.</p>
<p>Farewell, dear sir! Whatever climate or circumstances I may be
in I shall not cease to be, with sincere regard and esteem,</p>
<p align="right">Yours, &amp;c.,        <br>
<small>GEO. BARRINGTON</small>.   </p>
<p>P.S.&mdash;I understand it was reported in the papers that
when I came on board my hair was cut off, and my clothes taken
away, but nothing of the kind happened to me. I was permitted to
retain both, and continue to this hour to meet every indulgence
that can soften my situation. My respects and warmest wishes wait
on all my friends.</p>

<h3>HINTS RESPECTING THE NEW SETTLEMENT AT BOTANY BAY.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from <i>The Bee</i>, October,
1791.]</p>
<p align="center"><i>To the Editor of The Bee</i>.</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>In a late number of <i>The Bee</i> you informed us, on
official authority, that previous to the 18th of March, 1791,
2,029 convicts have been shipped from England for New South
Wales. We also learned that prior to the 9th of February, in the
same year, the expences of this establishment amounted to
&pound;374,000. Besides this sum, we are told of contingencies
that cannot as yet be stated! It was for the Minister's credit to
make his project appear as wise as possible, and to suppress a
part of this enormous expenditure to serve the temporary purposes
of debate. We may safely affirm that the contingencies referred
to make no trifling sum. Six additional months fall now to be
added to the account, and it is more reasonable to compute the
total expences up to this date at &pound;600,000.** Each of these
unhappy persons has therefore cost this country &pound;300
sterling; and supposing that on an average they survive
transportation for twenty years, the total expenditure of each
convict will at this rate amount to perhaps &pound;1,500. It may
indeed be acknowledged that before that time the country will be
reduced to a state of cultivation. But a circumstance mentioned
by the Governor sufficiently shows the great distance and
uncertainty of such a prospect. It cost him and a party five days
to penetrate thirty miles into the desert, and the fatigues they
underwent during this journey were excessive. In the same paper
you tell us that 1,831 additional convicts were then under orders
for shipping. It is impossible to estimate with any degree of
certainty what may be the annual expence of this colony before
the end of the Eighteenth Century. By a very moderate computation
we may suppose that before ten years elapse the colony will
receive at least 10,000 additional convicts; and it is but fair
to compute that of the whole number by that time transported
10,000 will then be alive, and maintained at the expence of
Government. Now, if each of these gentry cost us only &pound;30 a
year, the whole annual expence would amount to &pound;300,000. At
the end of twenty years it may rise to double that sum. Will the
British nation, with its eyes open, walk into such a gulf? We
must infer that the Botany Bay scheme is the most absurd,
prodigal, and impracticable vision that ever intoxicated the mind
of man. Transportation to North America was in comparison but a
ride before breakfast. New South Wales is at the distance of
6,000 or 8,000 leagues, if we include the windings and turnings
necessary on the passage. In the former country the price of a
felon*** when landed was sufficient to pay the expence of his
voyage; but in the latter, a convict, the moment we set him on
shore, is enrolled with many other right honourable gentlemen in
the respectable and useful band of national pensioners. There is
not an old woman in the three kingdoms who could not have
suggested a better plan. But, indeed, its valuable inhabitants
may very possibly save him that trouble by cutting the throats of
their taskmasters and embarking on board their shipping in the
bay. Could this revolution be accomplished without bloodshed, it
is in itself an event extremely desirable.</p>
<p align="right"><small>TUMBLEDOWN</small>.   </p>
<p class="foot">[** It will be seen from statement of expenses of
the settlement to June, 1793 (ante, p. 38), that the estimates of
this corespondent were much too high.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** "The price of a felon". This remark has
reference to the system of transportation to North America, in
force prior to the War of Independence. Under that system the
convict, from the time he stepped upon the transport-ship, was
regarded as a chattel. The Crown ceased to have any interest in
his movements; and, until his sentence expired, he was as much
the private property of the planter to whom the master of the
vessel sold him, as if he were an African negro. In the journals
of the House of Commons, under date 1st April, 1779, occurs a
report of a Special Committee on transportation. Amongst other
witnesses summoned by this committee was Mr. Duncan Campbell,
overseer of convicts. Questioned upon transportation to the
American colonies, he said:&mdash;"He had been concerned twenty
years in contracting for felons sentenced to transportation. Five
pounds per man were allowed by Government till the last three
years, when, in consequence of a competition for the contract, he
agreed to take them without any profit but that which accrued to
him by disposing of their servitude in the colonies; that many
convicts who had money bought off their servitude, and their
punishment was only banishment for the term prescribed; he
carried them only to the provinces of Maryland and Virginia, and
sold common male convicts, not artificers, on an average for
&pound;10 a piece; females at about &pound;8 or &pound;9; those
who were of useful trades, such as carpenters and blacksmiths,
from &pound;15 to &pound;25; the old and infirm he used to
dispose of to those humane people who chose to take them, but
with some he was obliged to give premiums. Being asked whether
they could be disposed of in any other colonies, he said he
apprehended not in any considerable number, which was the reason
he declined contracting for them upon the revolt of the colonies
of Virginia and Maryland; that he imagined about 100 might be
disposed of annually in Georgia and upon the frontiers of
Florida, but did not think any could in Canada; that he
transported on an average of seven years, 473 convicts annually;
that he carried from 100 to 200 persons in a ship; that the
ordinary passage was about two months, during which time, and in
the gaol where they were confined frequently two months before
their embarkation, rather more than a seventh part of the felons
died, many of the gaol fever, but more of the small-pox. He
observed that the number of women who died were only half in
proportion to the men, which he imputed to their constitutions
being less impaired, and to their sobriety. Your committee
thought proper, therefore, to examine how far transportation
might be practicable to other parts of the world."]</p>

<h3>A LETTER FROM SYDNEY.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from <i>The Bee</i> of 8th August,
1792.]</p>
<p align="right">Sydney, New South Wales, 29th October,
1791.   </p>
<p><small>THE</small> Governor continues to direct his views
chiefly to Norfolk Island and the settlement at Rosehill (now
called Parramatta, from the native name). The town there
continues to enlarge, according to the first plan, and 200 acres
of land are cleared of the timber; but the intense drought which
has prevailed for upwards of twelve months past has almost
deprived us of water to drink, and marred our hopes of reaping
any considerable increase from the harvest.</p>
<p>Indian corn is likely to be the most profitable grain that can
be raised in this country, and our views are chiefly directed to
the cultivation of that article; but how we can succeed in
raising a sufficient quantity I know not, without a more speedy
method of preparing the ground is hit upon than by the spade and
hoe. To labor with a plough** is impracticable, as the stumps of
the trees and their roots still remain in the ground, and cannot
now be removed without an immensity of trouble. Such of the
convicts whose times are out and choose to become settlers have
small grants of land given to them, and men to cut down the
trees, with eighteen months' provisions from the public store.
But the clearing and cultivation of the land depends wholly upon
themselves. The Governor has endeavoured to place them as
contiguous to fresh water as possible; but that article is so
scarce that there is a danger of their being without it, even
with the best management. They are allowed grain also to sow
their first crop, and a good many lately have made trial of the
business; but some of them are already repenting of their
bargains, and it is highly probable they will have greater cause
ere long. A reform of government (if this country is continued)
is much wanted; but nothing can be so truly acceptable as freedom
and a trial by jury in all cases.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Captain John Macarthur claims to have been
the first to employ a plough in the Colony. Ante, p. 510.]</p>
<p>Our journies to the northward or southward along the coast
have not as yet extended farther than Broken Bay and Botany Bay;
but the country backwards has been penetrated and pretty
accurately examined for upwards of thirty miles; but, as I have
formerly said, it has not been commended, some few tracts
excepted, that have presented a better appearance.</p>
<p>Norfolk Island, I am informed from the benignity of its soil,
bids fair to support five or six hundred colonists very well; but
a greater number, it is thought, would prove a burden, as a
sufficient quantity of timber must be left for firewood; and the
whole island does not exceed 11,000 acres.</p>
<p>At this place and Parramatta bricks and tiles are made in
numbers, and with ease, so that more permanent buildings than our
original habitations were are erecting as fast as possible. I
wish we could fill our granaries as readily as we can build
houses.</p>
<p>The Mary Ann arrived here on the 9th of July last with 141
female convicts, after a passage of four months and twelve days
from Gravesend; since which the Gorgon and six of the transports
bound to this part of the world have come in all safety; the
other four were left at the Cape. They have been very healthy
throughout the voyage, and few of them have greatly exceeded five
months on their passage. These ten sail of transports will nearly
land us 2,000 convicts, without bringing more than a proportion
of six months' provisions for their subsistence; so that
storeships will need to arrive shortly, or else we shall soon be
sorely pinched.</p>
<p>The Governor is authorized by this conveyance to inform such
of the convicts as have served their terms of transportation that
they are at liberty to go where they think proper.* Had this been
made known before it would have prevented much murmuring and
discontent among them. They all despaired of ever being able to
leave this country, which operated so powerfully on their minds
that labour became painful, and any chance of escaping, however
dangerous, appeared to them preferable to that of remaining in
perpetual slavery. Fifteen of them set out at different times in
two open boats belonging to the settlement. How they will succeed
I cannot devise, but the chance is certainly much against them.
The marines, who have justly felt much indignation at the
treatment they have met with here, are, to their great joy, to
return home immediately in the Gorgon. On their arrival, as well
as Captain Hunter, matters must be brought to light, and I have
no doubt but the injured will obtain ample justice. The
discontent and murmuring that has already arisen in the New South
Wales Corps prognosticates very little harmony in that quarter,
and I believe the chiefs in politics here are heartily sorry for
the exchange, but themselves are to blame for it they do not
deserve pity.</p>

<h3>A LETTER FROM SYDNEY.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Dublin Chronicle</i>
of Tuesday, 25th September, 1792.]</p>
<p align="right">Sydney Cove, Port Jackson,        <br>
24th November, 1791.   </p>
<p><small>WE</small> sailed from Spithead the 27th March, with
300 convicts on board.** After a very boisterous passage through
the Bay of Biscay, we passed the Canary and Cape de Verd Islands
the latter end of April, and on the 3rd of May came to an anchor
off St. Jago, where we watered and got some fresh provisions,
fruits, &amp;c. On the 12th we sailed for the Cape of Good Hope,
where we arrived on the 14th of July. At this place we had a very
plentiful supply of exceeding fine mutton, though very bad beef.
Greens were very dear, and consequently few came to the ship's
company's share, but still fewer to the poor unhappy convicts,
whose miserable situation was deplorable beyond description.
After staying here to water, and to get other things which we
wanted, until the 18th of August, we again set sail for New South
Wales, which lays due east from this place about 140 degrees in
longitude (an immense tract of water to traverse). In this
passage we had dreadful heavy seas and gales of wind, a great
deal of thunder, and the lightning continually flashing around us
both day and night. At last we arrived safe here on Sunday, the
16th of October, about two o'clock in the afternoon (which
corresponds with two in the morning in England), where great
numbers of the inhabitants flocked down in groupes to enquire
after their relations and friends in England, and some few black
natives out of idle curiosity.</p>
<p class="foot">[** It is evident from the contents of this
letter that the writer sailed in the Admiral Barrington. Out of
the three hundred convicts, thirty-six died on the
passage.&mdash;Collins, vol. i, p. 182.]</p>
<p>We found lying here on our arrival his Majesty's ships Gorgon
and Supply, brig, with ten sail of transports, such a sight as
was never known here before. On the 17th we sent on shore to the
King's hospital about one hundred of the convicts in an emaciated
state, owing in some measure to the flux and scurvy which raged
among them with much inveteracy; and likewise to other causes
which ought to have been prevented. Were those poor deluded
wretches who bid defiance to and trample wantonly upon all laws
but once to know what they have to undergo, both on their passage
here and on their disembarking, I think few, if any, would be
foolhardy enough to continue their nefarious courses of life.
When severely pinched with gnawing hunger, how have I seen many
fine fellows supplicating in the most pressing manner imaginable
for the damaged bread that was for the hogs and poultry. I have
seen the poor fellows so exhausted with hunger and thirst that
they could hardly stand alone.</p>
<p>The 19th and 21st we delivered the remainder of our convicts
and soldiers, some of whom were sent to Norfolk Island, a place
about one thousand miles from this, and the rest were sent to a
place about twenty-four miles in the woods, called by the natives
Parramatta, and by our people Rosehill. From this to the 12th of
November delivered our cargo, &amp;c., &amp;c., and now, having
some leisure time, have made several small excursions into the
woods, where we could go with safety; and surely there never was
discovered a place so unlikely to answer the intentions of
Government as this. It produces hardly anything natural to
support man or beast, and what efforts art can render to assist
nature seldom repays sufficient for the trouble. There are some
cabbage-trees, a kind of wild cherries, currants, and some wild
nuts, but very few of either. There is, likewise, an herb used as
greens, but they are very salt, as they grow upon the sea-beech,
and another herb tasting exactly like Spanish liquorish, which,
when boiled, yields a kind of sweet drink. These are the only
natural productions fit for the use of man. Those of the
inhabitants (which is not one in twenty) who have little gardens
grow a few cabbages, greens, peas, kidney-beans, turnips,
carrots, onions, leeks, parsley, &amp;c., &amp;c., but not many
come to perfection. There is in some wheat and other grain
growing, but most of it is very bad, owing to the excessive heat
and scorching winds. The natives, who are all blacks of a
ferocious nature, go entirely naked, both male and female; they
have neither hut nor any kind of habitations, except the cavities
of cragged rocks and hollow trunks of stupendous, lofty trees.
Their living is mostly the roots of fern, which they roast for
bread, and fish, which are here in great plenty, of various
kinds, particularly oisters, cockles, and muscles, very large of
their kind, but not so palatable as ours. There are great numbers
of birds of the parrot kind, and some pelicans and other rare
sorts. There are, likewise, many cangaroos, but they are very
shy, and keep mostly in the interior parts of the woods. We
sometimes get some to buy for sixpence per pound, but it must be
done privately, as the Governor will not allow it. It tastes much
like our venison, but not so rich, and no fat upon it. The
opposum, of which there is a great number, are something larger
than a rabbit; eat very well. There are plenty of flying
squirrels, large rats and mice, a great number of snakes,
lizards, guanos, and other reptiles, but none venomous except the
centipedes, of which I saw a number in the woods last Sunday.
There are various kinds of insects different from those in
England, and others exactly the same.</p>
<p>You will, perhaps, scarcely credit me when I tell you the
exorbitant price of things here. Tobacco has been sold lately for
&pound;1 5s. per lb., and is now, since the arrival of the fleet,
to 6s. 8d., and some 10s., per lb.; sugar, 3s.; soap, 2s., has
been as high as 7s.; tea, 15s. to 20s. and 25s. per lb.; rum,
30s. per gallon, and a great favour to procure it. Tobacco-pipes,
of which I had a good stock, but unfortunately destroyed in gales
of wind at sea, are sold at 3d. apiece. Everything in the way of
women's apparel sells excessively high. I see a great number of
faces whom I knew in London. One I saw in the woods who
recollected me, and made enquiry after sundry persons belonging
to Billingsgate. He belonged to Leadenhall-market, and I think he
told me his name was Michael Wrany; he is for life.</p>
<p>We buried thirty-seven convicts and one soldier's child, and
had one born on the passage The Queen and Atlantic, of 400 tons
each, are to be dispatched from hence to Calcutta to buy flour
for the settlement.</p>

soon after they had landed the convicts, the captain and mate
opened a warehouse on the island, and sold the provisions which
the unhappy convicts ought to have had; that, when landed, they
were swarming with vermin; and that, on account of the above
persons making complaint, they had been very ill-treated by the
captain and mate, and had wounds to shew of the ill-treatment
they had received.</p>

<h3>EXPIREES.**</h3>
<p class="source">[** Reprinted from the <i>Dublin Chronicle</i>
of 13th December, 1791.]</p>
<p><small>SEVERAL</small> letters, now in town from Botany Bay,
mention a circumstance entirely novel in the annals of
transportation, viz., the impossibility of the return of the
convicts who have served, or may serve, their time at that place.
It appears that some of the transports, who had served part of
their sentence at Woolwich, applied for a passage home at the
expiration of it, but received for answer that their request
could not be complied with unless they could pay their own
passage, as it had cost far too much to bring them there to think
of sending them back again upon any other terms.</p>
<p>Two persons of this description had received 100 lashes for
their insolence, as it was termed. One of them was near sixty
years of age, who had added to his crime by secreting himself in
the hold of a homeward-bound ship, where it was his fate to be
discovered.</p>

<p><small>THE</small> Botany Bay business is certainly to become
the object of Parliamentary investigation. The return of the
convicts, after their times are expired, their treatment on the
passage, and their preclusion from the possibility of appeal to
civil justice and humanity, are concerns of much importance. In
answer to the observations on Botany Bay, it may be remarked that
there never was an instance of persons being brought back, on the
expiration of their sentence, at the expense of the publick.</p>

<p><small>THE</small> convicts on board the Pitt, Captain
Manning, for Botany Bay, were attacked with the small-pox, and
which went through the soldiers. At one time there were more than
150 on the sicklist. They all recovered, only eight convicts and
two children being lost. Three children have been born, and more
were expected. The convicts were, in general, remarkably
well-behaved; so much so, that several were permitted to assist
in the navigation of the ship and to attend the watering-parties
in landing without their fetters. What a contrast this to the
voyage made by the Neptune.</p>

<h3>THE NEPTUNE, TRANSPORT.***</h3>
<p class="source">[*** Reprinted from the <i>Dublin Chronicle</i>

<p><small>MR. EVANS</small>, in his account of the voyage of the
Neptune to Botany Bay, has given a scene of misery on the part of
the convicts, and cruelty on the part of those concerned in their
transportation, which makes humanity shudder. We hope some
exaggeration has crept in; if not, that due punishment will fall
on the guilty. A great quantity of goods, it seems, were shipped
on freight, and which took up most of that room which the
wretched passengers ought to have had the benefit of. The
following is the description he gives of the part of the orlop,
or third deck, allowed for these unhappy sacrifices to the
justice of their country.</p>
<p>According to the dimensions given me of this place, it
contained 75 feet, or thereabouts, in length; 35 feet, or
thereabouts, at the utmost, in breadth; and 6 feet 6 inches, or
thereabouts, in height between the beams; and 5 feet 7 inches, or
thereabouts, in height below the beams; within which space were
built the miserable apartments for confining, boarding, and
lodging upwards of 400 male convicts, in four rows of cabins one
story high, viz., one row on each side of the ship from the
mainmast forwards, and two rows in the middle, or midships, not
quite so long. These cabins were about six feet in length and
breadth, and the bottom boards of the lower cabin were four
inches above the deck.</p>

<p><small>A COURT-MARTIAL</small> on board his Majesty's ship

to enquire into the cause and circumstance of the loss of his

her officers, and company, for their conduct on that occasion;
and having heard the evidence, and completed the enquiry, the
court is of opinion that the loss of the Sirius was not in any
respect owing to mismanagement, or a want of proper attention to
her safety, but that Captain Hunter, her officers, and company
did everything that was possible to be done for the preservation
of his Majesty's ship Sirius, and for the good of his Majesty's

<h3>A PRIVATE JOURNAL.</h3>
<p align="center"><b>[Extracts.]</b></p>
<p align="center">[<i>The Journal of George Thompson, who sailed
in the Royal Admiral, May, 1792.</i>]</p>
<p><small>THE</small> entrance of the harbour is formed by two
heads, called the North and South Heads, lying nearly in those
directions, and about three-quarters of a mile distant from each
other. Just within the Heads, and in the middle of the harbour,
is a shoal, with about four fathom water upon it at spring ebbs;
in the channel about fifteen fathom; it gradually shoals as you
get farther up. The whole abounds with islands, coves, creeks,
and harbours up to Sydney, which is about nine* miles from the
entrance, and makes the most complete harbour in the universe.
There your ships lay within fifty yards of the shore, in five
fathom and a-half, and as smooth as in a fish-pond. From Sydney
Cove the harbour takes its course to Rose Hill (or Parramatta).
There is water up at low water for a large longboat; the tide
flows about eight feet at neap tides, and ten feet at the spring,
with very little strength. The harbour abounds with a variety of
fish, most of them unknown in England. Here is plenty of oysters,
cockles, and other shell-fish. The best fish that are caught are
snappers, mullets, light horseman (so called from their head
resembling much a light horseman's cap),**[?] flatheads, salmon,
whitings, and there are many other kinds of fish too tedious to
mention.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Note in the MS</i>.:&mdash;"Governor
Phillip makes Sydney Cove about five or six miles from the
entrance into the harbour. The harbour also must be more than
three-quarters of a mile across, according to Phillip and White.
In other respects Thompson's account agrees tolerably well with
theirs."]</p>
<p>Sydney is the spot where the first settlement was formed,
merely for the advantage of good water and the conveniency of the
harbour. In this part are only gardens sufficient to supply the
inhabitants with vegetables, &amp;c. The Governor and principal
officers chiefly reside here, and as many convicts as are
sufficient to attend the storehouses, fishing-boats, different
officers, &amp;c. Those whose sentence is expired and are in
expectation of getting home ** chiefly choose this place for
their residence. About two miles from this place are the
brickfields, where a great number of bricks and tiles have been
lately made, but they are still in great want of limestone, or a
substitute for it. At present a stiff kind of clay is used to
build with, but it is such a weak cement they dare not attempt to
raise their houses even one story. There is not such a thing in
the colony as a set of stairs, except in the Governor's house,
which is only one story, and is built with lime brought from
England. The bricks and tiles are both of one colour&mdash;of a
light-brown&mdash;which make the buildings quite romantic. Those
that are built of wood are whitewashed with pipeclay, which is
found here in great plenty.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Note in the MS</i>.:&mdash;"None worth
mentioning have ever returned."]</p>
<p>Parramatta is the grand settlement, about sixteen miles from
Sydney by land. The buildings are the same as at that place,
forming one large street nearly one mile long. The houses are all
separate from one another, space being left to enlarge them when
necessary. There is a large hospital, church, storehouses,
&amp;c. The Governor has a house here upon Rose Hill, a most
delightful spot. Here is a large park, called Cumberland Park,
where the Government cattle are put to graze The greatest part of
the cattle and sheep, belonging to different people, are at this
place. There is at present about 100 acres of corn standing here,
chiefly Indian corn, some wheat, oats, barley, &amp;c. They look
remarkably well, and there is not the least doubt of its being
the most fruitful harvest the colony has ever experienced. It
will commence in about eight or ten weeks.</p>
<p>About four miles from this place is another
settlement&mdash;Toongabby&mdash;where the greatest number of
convicts are, and work very hard (there is also a good crop of
corn standing, and promises well). Their hours for work are from
five in the morning till eleven*; they then leave off till two in
the afternoon, and work from that time till sunset. They are
allowed no breakfast hour, because they have seldom anything to
eat. Their labour is felling trees, digging up the stumps,**
rooting up the shrubs and grass, turning up the ground with
spades or hoes, and carrying the timber to convenient places.
From the heat of the sun, the short allowance of provision, and
the ill-treatment they receive from a set of merciless wretches
(most of them of their own description) who are their
superintendants, their lives are rendered truly miserable. At
night they are placed in a hut, perhaps fourteen, sixteen, or
eighteen together (with one woman, whose duty is to keep it clean
and provide victuals for the men while at work), without the
comfort of either beds or blankets, unless they take them from
the ship they come out in, or are rich enough to purchase them
when they come on shore. They have neither bowl, plate, spoon, or
knife but what they make of the green wood of this country, only
one small iron pot being allowed to dress their poor allowance of
meat, rice, &amp;c.; in short, all the necessary conveniences of
life they are strangers to, and suffer everything they could
dread in their sentence of transportation. Some time since it was
not uncommon for seven or eight to die in one day, and very often
while at work, they being kept in the field till the last moment,
and frequently while being carried to the hospital. Many a one
has died standing at the door of the storehouse waiting for his
allowance of provision, merely for want of sustenance and
necessary food. So great was the mortality among them, that
upwards of &mdash;&mdash;*** <i>died in one year</i>; and of 450
that came from England in the Pitt,**** only twenty-nine were
alive six weeks since at a general muster.***** Those that are
now living chiefly owe their lives to those that are dead, the
provision being so scarce that, had they not died, all must have
perished. When our ship arrived (which was quite unexpected)
there was no more than one week's salt provision in the store at
the full allowance, which would have been reduced to one-third on
the following week.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Note in the MS</i>.:&mdash;"Captain Tench
says till ten."]</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Note in the MS</i>.:&mdash;"This may,
perhaps, be done now, but when Capt. Tench was there, it is
observed in his Journal, November 16, 1790, 'As all the trees on
our cleared ground were cut down and not grubbed up, the roots
and stumps remain.'"]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Blank in the MS.]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** <i>Note in the MS</i>.:&mdash;"The Pitt
sailed in May, 1791, and returned in 1793. I think I have heard
that some of these convicts went to Norfolk Island, and ought to
be deducted from this account." According to the MS. journal of
Lieutenant-Governor King, fifty-seven convicts were sent to
Norfolk Island.]</p>
<p class="foot">[***** This statement is probably exaggerated.
According to the report of the officers appointed to inspect her
(ante, p. 451), the Pitt originally contained 443 convicts, of
whom 33 were removed before sailing. Collins states (vol. i, p.
201) that 368 adult convicts were landed. It is, however, evident
from official statements that the death-rate for some months
after the arrival of the Pitt (14th February, 1792) was very
high. On p. 466, ante, the population of the settlements on the
18th March, 1792, is given as 4,204, and although by the Royal
Admiral and the Kitty an addition of 489 was made to the
population in October and November, 1792 (Collins, vol. i, pp.
236, 243-4), yet it appears by the Commissary's return of 8th
December, 1792 (Vol. i, part 2, p. 677), that the population was
only 4,203, i.e., in less than nine months 490 deaths had
occurred out of a population of 4,693. What the number of deaths
was between the arrival of the Pitt, in February, and the date of
the first of the two above-mentioned returns, it is impossible to
say.]</p>
<p>The women have a more comfortable life than the men. Those who
are not fortunate enough to be selected for wives (which every
officer, settler, and soldier is entitled to, and few are
without) are made hutkeepers; those who are not dignified with
this office are set to make shirts, frocks, trousers, &amp;c.,
for the men, at a certain number per day; ocasionally to pick
grass in the fields, and for a very slight offence are kept
constantly at work the same as the men. It is absolutely
necessary to keep a strict discipline among such people, and
their punishments are very severe. The colony is by no means
without good laws and officers of justice. There is a Judge,
Justice of the Peace, and constables; most of the latter are
convicts. At this time Barrington holds the post of
head-constable at Parramatta, and is a very diligent officer. For
a very trifling offence a convict is put into the stocks until it
is convenient to examine him. If guilty, he is taken to a
cart-wheel to receive a Botany Bay dozen, which is twenty-five
lashes; if the crime is such as would be punished by a dozen on
board a ship or on shore in England, it is here punished with two
or three hundred. If it is anything of consequence, such as
theft, they are tried by a regular court, which generally
terminates in a sentence of death, or a second transportation to
Norfolk Island for life. At the same time, the convicts have the
advantage of the laws as well as others. No person, unless those
immediately concerned with them, is allowed to strike them, or by
any means ill-use them. All complaints must be made to the
Justice, who must be consulted on the most trifling
occasions.</p>
<p>The natives of New South Wales are not very numerous*; towards
the sea-coast they are quite black, of the middle size, and in
general well-limbed; have large flat noses, thick lips, and short
hair&mdash;not of the woolly kind like the African negroes. They
are a lazy, indolent people, and of no ingenuity. They never even
think of seeking for food till hunger presses them. Their chief
living is fish, which they catch with a hook and line, or with a
fishgig made of wood, and sharpened with fishbones or kangaroo
teeth. They have no other method of cooking but roasting the fish
on the fire, which is generally done as soon as they get them out
of the water, and they are frequently so hungry as not to allow
themselves time to dress them, but eat them half-raw. They
commonly fish and eat till they can scarcely move; they then go
on shore, make a fire, and lay down to sleep by the side of it.
They have no kind of cloathing; both men and women are always
naked. If it rains, they fly to some hollow rock or cavern for
shelter; if it is fine, they just pull up some long grass, make a
fire, dry it, and go to sleep on it. They cannot bear to be
confined to a hut or tent. The Governor has built a very neat
brick hut for one of the chiefs, but neither he nor his family
will live in it; they will sometimes stay at the place for a day,
then make a fire on the outside of it. In short, they prefer
living in the woods and going naked to the best house or clothes
in the colony. There are many of them that visit Sydney every day
for the sake of what they can get to eat, and at night they
return to the woods.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Note in the MS</i>.:&mdash;"Capt. Hunter
seems to intimate they are numerous, though I think by his own
Historical Journal, it appears they are not so, as well as from
the accounts of others."]</p>
<p>There are three or four of the chiefs who attend the
Governor's house every day for their dinner and a glass of wine.
Several of the officers have both boys and girls as servants, but
they are so lazy that it is with difficulty you can persuade them
to get themselves a drink of water. If you attempt to strike
them, they will immediately set out for the woods, and stay four
or five days. Indeed, it is common for them to strip off what
clothes they may have on, and take a trip to the woods, whether
offended or not. If they were shy at the first settling in the
colony, that is not the case now, for the people can scarcely
keep them out of their houses in daytime. At the same time they
must be cautious how they affront them. If they offend them, at
the first opportunity they will certainly spear them, at which
they are very dexterous.* Their spears are made of the stem of
the grass-tree, are about twelve or fourteen feet long, pointed
with fishbone or teeth, and bearded with shells stuck on with
gum, and are very dangerous weapons; they will throw them fifty
or sixty yards,** and strike within two or three inches at a
certainty. They are very treacherous and deceiving. If they
chance to meet any person in the woods singly, it is ten to one
but they spear him and strip him of his clothes, though of no use
to them. If there are two or three together they will not attempt
to assault them, particularly if they have a musket, at which
they are much frightened; few people travel the woods without
one. Some time since one of them speared the Governor quite
through the shoulder from near the backbone to the neck, which
went through above five inches. He had one of their chiefs with
him at his house some time, and fearing he would go away had made
him a prisoner; however, he made his escape. The Governor,
hearing where he went, next day went about seven miles from
Sydney, and found him and several more together. To convince them
he did not intend them any harm, he went to them by himself, and
while he was expostulating with this chief, and intreating him to
return, one of them, who was behind, struck him with the spear,
and ran away to the woods. But he suffered severely for the
offence as soon as he was found by the rest; they beat him in a
most unmerciful manner, knocked one of his eyes out, and nearly
deprived him of life, while the Governor was carried home with
the spear in his shoulder, which, however, was not attended with
any bad consequence; in less than three weeks he was able to walk
out. They are divided into several tribes or casts, and are known
to which they belong by the loss of one of their fore teeth, or
the joint of their fore or little finger.*** They have frequent
wars and desperate battles with each other at fixed times.
Whenever a dispute arises between them that causes a fight, they
name a certain day and fix a place to meet for the engagement.
Everyone is armed with his spear, a large club, stone hatchet,
and a shield. They are at great pains to paint themselves and
make the most terrible appearance they can at those times. Those
who fall in the battle are left lying on the ground without any
more notice, except it be a chief or some one much respected.
Then they cover him with wood, set fire to it until the flesh is
burnt from the bones, and in this state they leave it. Those that
die naturally are not buried, but are left where they die, unless
they be of note; then they are burnt. They cannot bear the idea
of dying by a natural death, which is indeed seldom the case,
their frequent wars not suffering them to live to a great age.
The oldest that I remembered to have seen did not to appearance
exceed thirty years,**** If one of a family dies, they generally
put one or more of the survivors to death, and a family of eight
or nine has been often known to be reduced to two or three in the
course of a month. These two causes prevent their being numerous.
They are very quick in learning to speak English, and will repeat
any sentence after you immediately, particularly any tune. When
in their canoes, they keep constantly singing while they paddle
along. They have the French tune of Malbrook very perfect; I have
heard a dozen or twenty singing it together.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Note in original</i>:&mdash;"In 1790,
Governor Phillip observes that no less than seventeen of our
people had either been killed or wounded by their spears."]</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Note in original</i>:&mdash;"He might have
said sixty or seventy; Capt. Hunter says, I have since seen a
strong young man throw the lance full ninety yards.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>Note in original</i>:&mdash;"This seems

not been able to discover the cause of these defects."]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** <i>Note in original</i>:&mdash;"Though in
general they are not long-lived, yet some are known to live till
fifty or sixty years of age."]</p>
<p>The different kinds of beasts, birds, and insects are
numerous, and the birds in general are very beautiful. There is a
great variety of different sorts of parrots, parroquetts, and
many other birds unknown in England; a great many insects also,
which are very troublesome and destructive, one in particular,
that in the hot, dry season destroys the corn. These have been
known to overspread a field of corn in the course of one night
and totally destroy it. The musquittoes and flies are in great
quantities; the latter will infect fresh meat in such a manner
that it is sometimes difficult to keep it free from maggots even
one hour after it is killed. Of the beasts, the kangaroo is found
to be the best eating, exactly resembling venison; they are
sometimes shot, and sometimes taken with dogs. In dry weather it
is difficult to get them any way, owing to their swiftness in
leaping; but in rainy and wet weather they are easily caught or
shot. They often wound the dogs in a desperate manner with their
tail, with which they strike with great force. They grow very
slowly, and are near two years before they come to their full
size, and then they will weigh about 2 cwt.* They have a false
belly, in which they secure their young when pursued, and
commonly carry them till they are five or six months old. There
are a great many oppossums and flying squirrels, which are good
eating. Guanas, snakes, &amp;c., are very plentiful. There are
also some of the finest dogs wild in the woods, and many other
kind of beasts, but none of them in the least dangerous.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Note in original</i>:&mdash;"This
circumstance is worth mentioning, that at its birth the kangaroo
is not so large as a full-grown mouse."]</p>
<p>The trees with which the whole country abounds are found to be
of little use&mdash;not fit either for building houses or boats,
though there are many boats built with them, but they will not
last long; and likewise houses, for necessity has no law. There
are two kinds of oak, called the he and the she oak, but not to
be compared with English oak, and a kind of pine and mahogany, so
heavy that scarce either of them will swim. Some distance up the
country the trees grow very strait, and to a great heighth,
though not one in a hundred are sound. As an instance, when the
Supply was ordered for England, she wanted a new foremast, and to
find one to answer such a small ship it cost them upwards of
three weeks' labour, in which time they cut down more than thirty
trees before one was found to be sound at the heart, and this of
such a weight it was with difficulty they moved and erected it.
There are trees which produce two sorts of gum&mdash;a yellow
kind, which the natives make use of for their spears, fishgigs,
and canoes; and a kind which is called dragon's blood, but they
are of no use but for the fare.</p>

<h3>ESCAPEES.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>Dublin Chronicle</i>
of Saturday, 21st July, 1792]</p>
<p align="right">Public Office, Bow-street.   </p>
<p align="center"><i>Wonderful Escape from Botany Bay.</i></p>
<p><small>ON</small> Saturday, James Martin, John Butcher,
William Allen, Nathaniel Lilley, and Mary Briant [Bryant], were
brought by several of Sir Sampson Wright's officers, from on
board the Gorgon frigate, to this office. They are all that
survive of eleven persons who escaped from the settlement at
Sydney Cove. This escape was, perhaps, the most hazardous and
wonderful effort ever made by nine persons (for two were infants)
to regain their liberty, which they declare they should not have
ventured on but from the dread of starving, and the certainty
that if they did survive the period for which they were
transported they should never again see their native country.
They said that Governor Phillips used them very well, but that
the soil did not return half the quantity of grain which had been
sown on it. Their cattle had been destroyed by the natives, and a
famine was the consequence. They were reduced to four ounces of
flour and four of salt beef per day, half of which was cut off,
if, from illness or accident, they were unable to work; they,
therefore, seized the first opportunity of throwing themselves
upon the mercy of the sea, rather than perish upon this
inhospitable shore. A Dutch schooner, under the command of
Captain Smith, brought a small supply of provisions for the
colony from Batavia, and William Briant [Bryant], who had married
the prisoner, Mary Briant [Bryant], found means to pursuade the
captain, for a sum of money (for the convicts, not having any use
for their money in the colony, had all by them which they took
from this country), to let them have a six-oared boat, with a
lug-sail, a quadrant, and a compass. The captain gave them 100
pound weight of rice, and they purchased of the baker of the
colony 100 weight of flour, at half-a-crown and eighteenpence per
pound, which, with fourteen pounds of pork they also got from the
captain, and ten gallons of water, was all the provisions they
had. At ten o'clock at night, on the 28th of March, 1791, William
Bryant, with his wife and two children (one three years, and the
other one year old), Samuel Bird, William Morton, James Cox,
James Martin, John Butcher, William Allen, and Nathaniel Lilley,
embarked in order to reach the island of Timor. They were ten
weeks but one day on the voyage. The first five weeks they had
continual rain, and were wet the whole time. When forced to lie
on shore they were in continual danger of being murdered and ate
by the savage natives, and part of them were obliged to keep a
strict watch while the rest slept. They discovered an island in
latitude 26&deg; 27', where the boat was swamped in going on
shore, and they were near losing her and their lives. On this
island they found plenty of turtles, but no inhabitants. They
dried, and took to sea with them, as much turtle as lasted them
ten days, which, with a few fish they caught, was all they got
while they were out. On the 5th of June they all landed at
Cupang, a Dutch settlement on the Island of Timor. The Governor,
whom they told that they belonged to an English ship which had
been wrecked on her passage to New South Wales, treated them very
kindly, but happened one day to overhear a conversation among
them by which he discovered that they were convicts who had
escaped from New South Wales. On the 29th of August, 1791, his
Majesty's ship Pandora, in her voyage to New South Wales, was
wrecked between that place and New Guinea. The captain, Edward
Edwards, Esq., and those of the crew who survived, took to their
boats and got safe to Cupang, when the Governor told Captain
Edwards of the people he had got there, and of the conversation
he had overheard. Captain Edwards took them with him to Batavia,
where Wm. Briant [Bryant] and his eldest child died; from thence
the captain hired the Rambang, a Dutch ship, in which he sailed
with the rest for the Cape of Good Hope. On the passage there,
Bird, Wm. Martin, and Cox died. On his arrival at the Cape he
found the Gorgon, frigate, bound for England, and gave the
survivors of these unfortunate adventurers in charge to Captain
Parker, who brought them all to England but Charlotte Briant
[Bryant], the second child of Wm. and Mary Briant [Bryant].
William Allen is fifty-five years old; he was convicted at
Norwich, more than six years ago, of stealing some handkerchiefs,
the property of Messrs. Lewis and Haywood. John Butcher is fifty
years of age; he was convicted of stealing three pigs, the
property of John Harsbury, five years and a half ago, at
Shrewsbury. Nathaniel Lilley, thirty-nine; he was capitally
convicted five years ago last March, at Bury St. Edmunds, of
stealing a fish-net, a watch, and two spoons, the property of
Benjamin Summerset, privately in his dwelling, but there being
favourable circumstances in his case the Judge reprieved him on
his agreeing to go for seven years to Botany Bay. James Martin,
of the county of Antrim, Ireland, thirty-two years of age, was
convicted at Exeter, six years and a half ago, of stealing some
old lead and iron, in the whole about 20 lb. weight, the property
of Lord Courtney. Mary Briant [Bryant] was convicted by the name
of Broad, at the same assizes with Martin, of a street robbery
and stealing a cloak, which being a capital offence, she received
sentence of death, but was, with two other women who were
convicted of the same offence, pardoned on condition of their
going for seven years to Botany Bay. William Briant [Bryant] was
convicted of interrupting some revenue officers in the execution
of their duty, and immediately on his landing at Botany Bay
married the above woman. They were each sentenced to be
transported for seven years. It was remarked by every person
present, and by the magistrate, that they never saw people who
bore stronger marks of a sincere repentence, and all joined in
the wish that their past sufferings may be considered as a
sufficient expiation of their crimes. They all declared they
would sooner suffer death than return to Botany Bay. They were
committed to Newgate.*</p>

<h3>THE CASE OF THE NEPTUNE, TRANSPORT.</h3>
<p align="center"><b><small>REMARKS</small> and statement of the
proceedings of Donald Trail, master of the Neptune, during his
passage to Port Jackson.**</b></p>
<p class="source">[** Reprinted from <i>The Diary, or Woodfall's
Register</i>, of 4th August, 1792. The statement was evidently
drawn up in answer to the charges of Mr. Evans (ante, pp. 461-4).
See also the owners' instructions to Captain Trail, dated 19th
December, 1789 (ante, p. 750); and the charges made against the
captain and mate by minor officers and seamen of the vessel
(ante, p. 791).]</p>
<p><small>THE</small> convicts were ironed under the inspection
of Lieutenant Shapcote, the Navy Agent, and those of good
character, or those not in health, were exempted; and, whenever a
convict was reported not in health, the agent saw him taken out
of irons. The convicts that died in Stoke's Bay were always sunk
with ballast brought from the shore, except one day, when it blew
too hard to send a boat from the ship, and then the body was sunk
with coals.</p>
<p>The male convicts were admitted on deck fifty or sixty at a
time, and relieved every two hours. Exclusive of these, all the
sick that could be brought up, and the boys, and those who
behaved well, were permitted to come up at the same time. In
short, no male convict that chose to come upon deck had less than
from two to four hours each day. The hatch admitted two at a
time. It was necessary to have it of this size, in order to
prevent a surprize.</p>
<p>The convicts lodged in the upper tier of cabins were upon deck
as much as those in the lower tier; and, exclusive of the light
from the hatches, there were many lights burned on the orlop deck
amongst the convicts till eight o'clock at night.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Shapcote, on his coming on board in Stoke's Bay,
ordered the convicts to be searched, among whom were found
between seventy and one hundred knives, a great number of chests
with large iron hinges and iron clasps at the corners; also a
number of tinpots. All these articles were, by his orders, and
under his personal inspection, taken from their rooms. Whoever
could sell or otherways dispose of his chest among the sailors
and soldiers were at liberty to do so. Their knives and tinpots,
which they converted into knives, were withheld from them. Many
of the chests and old clothes were thrown overboard by the
agent's directions, he being fearful they might bring the gaol
distemper into the ship. Neither the agent or Mr. Trail took
anything from them to appropriate to their own uses, nor were the
convicts without bowls, platters, or tinpots, when necessary.
They had a knife to each mess to cut their victuals.</p>
<p>The method of serving the convicts can only be answered by the
ship's steward. There was seldom any complaint made to the master
about the mode, the agent always taking upon himself the seeing
provisions served out.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The agent, Mr. Shapcote, died on the passage
from the Cape to Port Jackson more than two years before this
statement was made public.]</p>
<p>The male convicts were allowed three pints of water per day,
exclusive of what was made use of for cooking their victuals.
Neither were the sick, or any of the others, without cans, or
smaller vessels than kegs, to drink out of.</p>
<p>When, in hot weather, near the Line, in order to thin the
rooms, more convicts were allowed to sleep upon deck every night
than the number of soldiers and sailors to guard them. Nothing
but humanity could have authorized the agent and Mr. Trail to
have run this risk. During their continuance between the Tropics,
every precaution, with windsails and the ports up fore and aft,
was taken for keeping the rooms cool; and Mr. Trail verily
believes their apartments were the coolest in the ship.</p>
<p>The women convicts, during the passage, had the range of the
poop and quarter-deck. A pint of water was allowed each for tea
in the morning (exclusive of their daily allowance, which was so
large as to enable them to wash their linen), nor was there any
obstruction to their boiling it before their arrival at the Cape.
As for the ship's company being severely flogged for speaking to
them, it is not true; they frequently deserved it for breaking
into the rooms of the females, and many times it was found that
the females had been taken out of their rooms in the night by the
ship's company, and lodged where they had an opportunity of
conversing with the male convicts.</p>
<p>It is true that on the ship's arrival at the Cape of Good Hope
every male convict in health was put in irons, the reason for
which was that the ship laid so near the shore that it was
necessary to take every precaution to prevent their landing, the
commander and owners having given bond that none should be
suffered to escape. Every man that chose to come upon deck had
two hours in his turn. While the ship continued at the Cape the
convicts were well supplied with fresh beef or mutton every day,
and vegetables allowed them in their broth. The agent was
perfectly satisfied they were well supplied, and Mr. Trail says
he never heard of any complaint.</p>
<p>No female convict was out of the ship in the night. One was
permitted, under the charge of one of the ship's company, to wash
and dry linen on shore in the daytime, and she, with the man (her
guard), returned to the ship with the linen before dark. This
happened but twice.</p>
<p>Major Delisle and a captain in the Dutch service returned a
visit to Captain Nepean, and the distance from Cape Town (where
they lived) to the ship being upwards of twenty miles, and the
roads bad, they could not return the same night, therefore
accepted a bed in the cabin with Captain Nepean. They were both
married men, and their wives at the Cape. It cannot be thought
they could stay on account of the female convicts, as insinuated
by Mr. Evans,* neither did any other Dutch officer sleep in the
ship during the time she remained at the Cape.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The particular statement of Mr. Evans in which
this insinuation occurs is not available.]</p>
<p>Mr. Trail, in order to serve Government, and relieve the
settlement in New South Wales, received on board the Neptune 300
tierces of provisions from Capt. Riou, of the Guardian; but
neither Mr. Trail or his owners derived any benefit
therefrom.</p>
<p>When the ship had made her passage about halfway between the
Cape and Port Jackson, it being then the middle of winter, we had
a continuance of heavy gales of wind and high seas, so that
cooking became impracticable upon deck; for this reason the
convicts' provisions were obliged to be dressed in the ship's
coppers below. Being under the necessity of cooking for the
ship's company and convicts in the same coppers, they probably
were not so regularly served as they had formerly been; but it
did not happen that they had any cause of complaint more than
twice or thrice at most, and that from the severity of the
weather. It must be obvious to everyone a saving of coals could
not be the object, as we were going to a woody country. The women
convicts had leave to boil water at pleasure, but from the
badness of the weather, as above stated, and being obliged to
cook below, there was not the room as formerly (when there were
two fires) for each female's pot; a large copper was, therefore,
boiled every other morning for them; this, however, was only for
a short time, but at all times there was water boiled for the
sick, both male and female.</p>
<p>After the ship left the Cape of Good Hope a violent epidemical
fever, together with the scurvy, appeared amongst the convicts,
and everyone was affected in a more or less degree, in
consequence of which the commander made application to Lieutenant
Shapcote for an order to serve out porter to them, which was
refused, the agent not thinking himself justified in giving such
orders. Mr. Trail, therefore, supplied them with vinegar to wash
their mouths, and vegetables that he brought from the Cape for
his own use (without any expence to Government), which restored
many of them. They, likewise, as the weather was very bad and
cold, frequently refused to come upon deck, and were oftentimes
obliged to be forced up, in order to preserve their health. After
the death of the agent, the greatest part of the convicts had
their irons taken off, and for some days previous to their
arrival at Port Jackson not one of them was in confinement.</p>
<p>Two or three weeks before the arrival of the ship at Port
Jackson, Mr. Trail received information that a Mrs. Wheeler, a
female convict, had stolen one of his table-cloths. He sent for
her trunk, which was opened in the presence of the officers of
the troops and of the ships. A part of the cloth was found in the
trunk, which, being compared with the others belonging to Mr.
Trail (above sixty in number, all of the same width and pattern),
exactly corresponded. The convict was asked who had been
concerned with her in the theft, and what was become of the other
part of it. She would not say. Mr. Trail, therefore, ordered her
clothes and the piece of cloth to be locked up in the gun-room,
there to remain until her arrival in New South Wales, when he
intended to have applied to the Court of Justice to have her
punished. However, on their arrival he ordered his steward to let
Mrs. Wheeler have all her things again, even the piece of cloth
in dispute. Her trunk, when searched for the cloth, was found to
swarm with bugs, on which account it was thrown overboard. This
trunk was the only one thrown overboard belonging to the female
convicts, and the aspersion thrown out by Mr. Evans that Mr.
Trail ordered all the females' trunks and boxes to be examined,
and after choosing anything he liked and taking it to himself,
saying, "Damn you, you bitch, this is mine, you stole it from
me," is totally false; neither is it the language of Mr. Trail to
call the most abandoned of the sex by such opprobrious names.</p>
<p>While the ship lay in Stoke's Bay the convicts were not at any
allowance of water, but had it to go to, and even to wash with,
without any hindrance; nor were they locked up, as described by
Mr. Evans, on the orlop deck, but at least 150 were always upon
deck. Had they been treated as described, it is more than
probable they would have made it known among their other
complaints to the Treasury, for complaints they made of their
being heavily ironed, and an inquiry was made in consequence.</p>
<p>Four hundred and twenty-one male and seventy-eight female
convicts embarked or sailed from England, and twelve others were
received on board at the Cape, so that the whole number embarked
amounted to 511 persons, out of which number 158 died, as appears
by the master's affidavit sworn at Sidney, New South Wales, as
asserted by Mr. Evans.</p>
<p>As it would have been dangerous to have taken up all the
convicts at once, the orlop deck could not be washed, neither
would the situation of the cabins admit of it. This deck was
daily scraped, swabbed, or mopped, and twice a week sprinkled
with oil of tar or vinegar, and was as free from nastiness or bad
smells as any ship that ever carried convicts.</p>
<p>Stores were certainly stowed on the gun-deck, but it was in
order to keep the other deck clear for the convicts. It was
assuredly the carpenter's duty to put tarpaulings on the hatches.
And Mr. Evans has observed that he was every way disposed to
contribute to the comfort of the convicts; but the fact is that
he was so indolent a man that before he could be got upon deck a
splash of sea might get down the hatches; but, from the diligence
and attention of the officers on deck, this accident seldom
happened&mdash;and this is what Mr. Evans calls a leak.</p>
<p>The surgeon had a regular education at Edinburgh, I think
under Dr. Munro, from [whom] he has certificates of
qualification. He was supplied with a large medicine-chest, which
was sufficiently filled with medicines for the voyage. He daily
visited the sick; therefore must know who was and who was not
dead.</p>
<p>The convicts in the adjoining cabins, not receiving any
advantage from the dead men's rations, would certainly have
discovered and complained of dead bodies being kept among
them.</p>
<p>The hump-back man, said to have jumped overboard, was in a
state of insanity; he had no reason for complaint. Whilst under
or near the Line he was indulged with sleeping upon deck, where
he could not suffer from the heat, and had been on deck some
nights and days before this happened, so that Mr. Trail verily
believes he fell overboard.</p>
<p>As to the insinuation of the agent having died an untimely
death, it is well known that he had been some time in a declining
state of health; that the night previous to his dissolution he
supped with Mr. Trail, his wife, the commanding officer of the
troops, and the surgeon; that he ate very heartily of sallad and
bread and cheese, and said he felt himself much better than he
had been for some time before: that he went to bed about nine
o'clock; that between three and four o'clock in the morning Mr.
Trail was awaked by the chief mate, who informed him that a
female convict (who had constantly attended Mr. Shapcote) had
just acquainted him of the death of the agent, upon which
information, Mr. Trail, together with the commanding officer of
the troops and the surgeon, went to his berth and locked his
bureau; and that he was so very offensive that they were obliged
to bury him about ten o'clock the same morning, when the funeral
service was read over him at the gangway, by &mdash; &mdash;
&mdash; * in presence of the ship's company, soldiers, and the
greatest part of the convicts; and that after the funeral the
commanding officer of the troops, attended by the chief and
second mates, took an inventory of his effects, which was
afterwards given to his son at Port Jackson.</p>

Editor:&mdash;"The following is the most favourable account we
have yet seen of the new colony, and, as such, feel a pleasure in
laying it before our readers. It is from a gentleman at
Toongabbe, a place situated about eighteen miles inland from
Sydney Cove."]</p>
<p align="right">30th November, 1792.   </p>
<p><small>THE</small> hills in general are of good black earth;
but the valleys, which are well watered, are an entire rock to
the surface. Both hills and vales are covered with trees to an
amazing height, and in many instances nine yards in
circumference. They grow perfectly straight, and nearly 100 feet
high before the branches shoot off; they are supported entirely
by the bark, which often bids defiance to the best English saws
and axes, the inside being entirely decayed and rotten. There
are, however, abundance of large red and white gum-trees, oak,
fir, mahogany, apple, pear, cherry, &amp;c.; the fruit of the
latter trees are not, however, eatable. There are but few shrubs
and underwood. Five hundred convicts were constantly employed for
twelve months in clearing 720 acres of land, now thus disposed
of: 172 acres in wheat, 12 acres of barley, 460 acres of Indian
corn or maize; the town and gardens occupy the remaining 26.** We
are now getting in the harvest; four stacks of wheat and barley
are already formed. The produce of wheat we estimate at 17
bushels per acre, barley at 14 bushels per acre, potatoes nearly
300 bushels per acre. The Indian hoe is the principal instrument
of husbandry. We have a great number of hogs, sheep, and goats,
25 cows, 6 young bulls, 2 horses, and 7 mares, with poultry in
abundance. The grass is excellent. A desire in each to preserve
his stock makes all kinds of provisions dear. Pork is 1s. per
pound, a hen 10s., an egg 3d., a sow from &pound;5 to &pound;12,
and everything else in proportion. The convicts are allowed to
keep what live stock they can purchase. Nothing can equal the
salubrity of the climate. The thunderstorms, which are at present
frequent, it is expected will be less so as the country becomes
clear and open.</p>
<p class="foot">[** This leaves 50 acres unaccounted for.]</p>
<p>There are about three hundred yearling vines of the most
promising appearance.</p>

<h3>A LETTER FROM SYDNEY.***</h3>
<p class="source">[*** Reprinted from the <i>Western County
Magazine</i> for 1792. The following note was prefixed by the
Editor:&mdash;"The present situation of this colony is made known
by the following extract of a letter from Sydney Cove."]</p>
<p><small>I WILL</small>, by the opportunity that now offers,
endeavour to answer all your questions; and, first, whether there
is any prospect that this colony will be able to maintain itself?
I shall say, No. The soil round the settlement at Sydney Cove is
so very indifferent that it cannot afford sufficient grain for
the present inhabitants to feed the stock they now raise, and the
crops, such as they are, are destroyed by a variety of vermin,
according to the nature of the season; and at all times by
kangaroo rats, which are exceedingly numerous, and in spite of
our endeavours to the contrary, continue increasing, from the
circumstance of being better supplied from our storehouses than
formerly. All housed grain, flour, pease, or any dried vegetable,
suffer much from their depredations. A settlement we have made at
the head of the harbour (Rose Hill), about fourteen miles from
Sydney Cove, is in a better soil, but it is found by experience
that no grain can succeed there except Indian corn. To this
settlement everything must be carried by water, in boats, which
must wait the tide to get up to Rose Hill.</p>
<p align="center">*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *</p>
<p>The plough and the harrow are useless. For want of cattle, the
manure of every kind must be carried on the land by men, which,
when added to the trouble and labour of clearing a woody country,
will account for the slow progress we make. You are to consider
that, without the use of cattle to assist the labourer, we can
never hope for any extent of cultivation. The roots of large
trees, which have been in the ground for ages, are so interlaced
with one another that to clear these roots is a labour of
infinite fatigue, and disheartening in a soil which is ungrateful
enough to refuse a return for the trouble of clearing it. As to
the enclosures making with a view to preserve the cattle from
straggling and being lost in future, that can only be done on a
very small scale. The providing them with grass and proper food
will become a very great charge on such a soil as this. A few
settlers, with great assistance, might by dint of labour maintain
themselves in time; but as to the idea of the possibility of
supporting an extensive and numerous settlement, it must be given
up. As to Norfolk Island, which you must consider in England as
an appendage to this settlement, it is so&mdash;if at the
distance of 300 leagues it can be called an appendage. It is as
far from this as Gibraltar from England, which is seldom
considered as an appendage to England, although dependant on the
mother country. Norfolk Island is a better soil than Sydney Cove,
and will produce corn on cultivation after it is cleared. This
has likewise its difficulties. One of the principal is that it
has no anchorage round it, and is so difficult of access, on
account of the constant surf, that landing on it is dangerous at
all times, and for several days at a time wholly impracticable.
The island is very small&mdash;about four miles long. It is very
much pestered with vermin, and particularly caterpillars, which
destroy the growing crop and do infinite damage. The female
convicts on the island are employed collecting these vermin, and
are tasked at three quarts a day in the time of the crops. This
island may probably be able to support 200 or 300 people when it
is cleared and cultivated, and is certainly a proper place for
banishment, from being so difficult of access. This appears to me
to be the only place that can continue of any use, for as to the
present settlement of Sydney Cove, it cannot ever become equal to
the support of any number of inhabitants, and the more you
encrease the number the more you will encrease the
difficulty.</p>

<h3>GOVERNOR PHILLIP'S ACCOUNT.***</h3>
<p class="source">[*** Reprinted from the <i>Dublin Chronicle</i>
of 4th June, 1793.]</p>
<p align="right">London, 30th May.   </p>
<p><small>GOVERNOR PHILLIP</small> tells many curious stories of
his Majesties subjects in Botany Bay. Barrington is high
constable of the settlement, and administers justice with an
impartial hand. There is no severity that will operate to the
prevention of the natives [convicts] stealing one another's
cabbages. There is one of the convicts has built a comfortable
house, and has cultivated his share of ground to great advantage.
His time has expired, but he refuses to return to England, and
actually gives his share of the Government provision to his
neighbours, as he is able to live with his family on his own
farm. The sterility of the ground and the badness of the climate
are such as to prevent the settlement from ever realizing the
expectation of the philosophers who first suggested the measure
of establishing one at Botany Bay.</p>
<p>The female convict who made her escape from Botany Bay, and
suffered the greatest hardships during a voyage of three thousand
leagues, and who was afterwards retaken and condemned to death,
has been pardoned, and released from Newgate. In the story of
this woman there is something extremely singular. A gentleman of
high rank in the Army visited her in Newgate, heard the detail of
her life, and for that time departed. The next day he returned,
and told the old gentleman who keeps the prison that he had
procured her pardon, which he shewed him, at the same time
requesting that she should not be apprised of the circumstance.
The next day he returned with his carriage, and took off the poor
woman, who almost expired with the excess of gratitude.</p>

<p align="right">Norfolk Island, 19th November, 1793.   </p>
<p><small>THE</small> Britannia is chartered to bring provisions,
&amp;c., for this colony from Bengal. Captain Raven sailed from
Port Jackson in October last for Dusky Bay, in New Zealand, which
he had left twelve months ago, to kill seals. On his return he
found them all well,*** and they had about 4,590 sealskins,
although they were very deficient of tackle to kill them with.
During their stay at this bay they built a small vessel of 150
tons burden, entirely out of the wood of the country, which, they
say, is equal to the English oak, and grows in great abundance.
The bay is large, commodious, and well sheltered from the winds.
During their stay at the bay they caught such an abundance of
fine fish, and a kind of woodhen, which cannot fly, having no
long feathers in its wings; and they had scarce any occasion for
their salt meat all the time they remained there. They saw no
natives; but on one of their excursions into the country they
found a fire in a small hut. They left some axes, &amp;c., on a
tree which lay in front of the hut, but the natives had not
removed them when they left the island. They speak so highly of
the country, for the goodness of the soil and the fine timber
with which it abounds, that it may be an object to Government in
course of time.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Captain Raven had in December, 1792, left a
party of men at Dusky Bay. Ante, p. 94.]</p>
<p>I should have mentioned in my former letter, had time
permitted, the D&aelig;dalus having brought two of the natives of
New Zealand to instruct the people to manufacture the flax-plant.
The process proves to be a very simple one. They divide the fibre
or haum across the leaf, about half through, with the point of a
knife (in New Zealand they do this with a cockle-shell), then
they draw it three or four times under the back of a knife, so
that the outer part strips off. It is then taken to the water,
and beat with a round stick; after this it is hung out in the sun
to bleach; when sufficiently bleached, it is then hackled and
spun into yarn. The two last parts of the process are an
improvement made on the New Zealand mode of preparing it. By this
method there has been some excellent canvas made out of it at
this island, a sample of which is sent home. All that is now
wanting is a machine that will dress it in a more expeditious
manner, which might be easily invented by an artist, the New
Zealand method being rather tedious, and requiring a number of
hands.</p>
<p>The New Zealanders are pleasant and good-natured beyond
anything one could expect to meet with amongst so barbarous a
people as they have always been considered to be. One of them is
called Odoo, the other Tugee. The former is son to one of the
princes of that country; the other is son to one of their
priests. They live constantly at the Lieutenant-Governor's, and
eat at his table. They seem very well content at their present
situation. At times they express a wish to return to their native
country, which will be complied with the first favourable
opportunity that offers.</p>
<p>Various are the accounts respecting this colony (and not more
so than the causes that have produced them), some of them, I am
convinced, from a want of competent knowledge or sufficient
information on the subject they spoke of. This has been the case
with some, in my opinion, as I believe them to be men of the
greatest veracity, and incapable of misrepresenting things; but
that there have been misrepresentations is beyond a doubt, and
many of them so unfavourable to the colony that nothing but time
and facts can obliterate them. However, most people allow the
climate to be very fine, and that there are considerable tracts
of fine ground; and the general opinion is that, were there a
sufficient number of black cattle imported, the colony would soon
amply supply itself. As to this island, all agree that the soil
is excellent; all it wants is a good harbour, and much could be
done to remove this inconvenience should the place prove to be an
object worth that attention. To conclude this part of my letter,
I am of opinion that New South Wales is not sufficiently known to
authorize anyone to give a decisive account of the country, as
there are not above thirty miles known one way, and not more than
twenty the other, which is but a speck, speaking of such an
immense tract of country as New Holland is.</p>
<p>I have some seeds and specimens of plants for you, which I
shall send in the first ship that sails from this directly to
Europe. I would have sent them by this conveyance but, from the
long voyage, I think they would share the same fate as those I
sent you before.</p>
<p>The two New Zealanders, Tugee and Odoo, having expressed the
greatest anxiety to return to their native country, and the
Governor, being desirous that they should return impressed with
those favourable ideas which they have hitherto imbibed of the
friendship and kind treatment they had received at this island,
was equally anxious that their wishes should be complied with;
and on the afternoon of Friday, the 8th of March,
Lieutenant-Governor King, the Rev. Mr. Bain, myself,* Mr.
Chapman, the two natives, two non-commissioned officers, and
seventeen privates belonging to the New South Wales Corps,
embarked on board the Britannia. The wind being fair, made sail
about four o'clock p.m. The weather continued fine, and the wind
favourable. Nothing particular occurred until Tuesday morning,
when we made the Three Kings, a small island which lies off the
north end of New Zealand. About eleven o'clock we were abreast of
North Cape. As soon as the bay opened, the natives came off in
their canoes, and came alongside of the ship with the greatest
confidence, unprovided with any warlike instruments, except a few
which they brought to dispose of. By evening there were no less
than seven of these canoes alongside, containing, upon an
average, twenty men each. They exchanged their cloth, flax,
fishing-hooks, lines, &amp;c., &amp;c., with the people on board,
for knives, axes, pieces of iron, hoops, &amp;c., &amp;c. This
traffic was carried on, with the strictest honesty by both
parties, until the evening put an end to it, when the canoes
returned to the shore.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Lieutenant-Governor King, in his despatch of
the 19th November, 1793, ante, p. 88, gives the names of those
who embarked with him. It will be seen from this that the writer
of this letter was Mr. Thomas Jamison, assistant-surgeon.]</p>
<p>It was almost calm during the night, and in the morning there
were only light airs, with some appearance (by the clouds) of a
contrary wind, the ship being about fifteen leagues from the
place where the two natives lived. As this night seemed extremely
likely to detain the ship longer than the Governor wished for, he
asked Tugee and Odoo if they would go in one of the natives'
canoes, to which they seemed very much averse. Some time after
one of the principal chiefs came on board, who informed them that
their chief had been on a visit there about three days before the
ship arrived&mdash;that the two tribes were on the strongest
terms of amity with each other. They informed the Governor of
this, and seemed perfectly convinced of the truth of it, and were
satisfied to go with him in his canoe. The Governor told them it
might be a deception, and that if they had any doubt they had
better return to Norfolk, and wait for another opportunity; to
which Tugee replied "that chiefs never told lies, and that they
were quite satisfied to go in the canoe."</p>
<p>The Governor finding that the ship was not likely to get round
to the bay, and being also convinced of the truth of what the
chief had told them, as one of the natives who had stayed on
board all night had related the same story, he now consented to
their going in the canoe, and sent for the chief and told him
that he should be back in four months, and, should he find Tugee
and Odoo well, he would make him and his tribe a very handsome
present; to which he replied by saluting with the nose&mdash;that
is, he applied his nose to the Governor's, in which position he
continued for some minutes. This done, the stock, Indian corn,
wheat, and garden seeds, &amp;c., &amp;c., were put into the
canoe. Poor Tugee and Odoo now came to take leave of us with very
full hearts indeed, and seemed gratefully impressed with a sense
of the obligations they were under to Governor King, whom they
were very much attached to. Everything being now in the canoe,
they put off for the shore. The next day we had a fair wind for
Norfolk, where we arrived on Tuesday, the 18th, about four
o'clock, being just ten days on our passage to New Zealand and
back again to Norfolk.</p>
<p>I can give you no information respecting this country, as we
did not land. As to the coast, it looks to be sandy in many
places, but in general it seems covered with green herbage. I
think a large quantity of flax might be bought from the natives
for very little. I send you a specimen of it, and some other
curiosities which I purchased of them. I also send you enclosed
in the letter a small specimen of the Norfolk Island flax, as
dressed ready for the hackle.</p>

<p align="right">London, 15th March.   </p>
<p><small>THE</small> Kitty, transport, which arrived at
Portsmouth on Friday last from Botany Bay, left that place on the
4th of June, at which time, we learn, the colony had begun to
surmount those difficulties natural to an infant settlement; that
the wheat was remarkable good, the bushel weighing sixty-two and
sixty-three pounds; that potatoes, peas, French beans,
cauliflowers, cabbages, melons, &amp;c., &amp;c., were
exceedingly fine, and very productive; grape-vines answer every
expectation. Tobacco may be cultivated to great advantage, and
the castor is self-sown in various places. The olive no doubt
would do well. They have fish in great plenty, but boats on the
construction of the Peter-boats would give them a continual and
ample supply, as they might go safely without the harbour to
fish. The convicts are well clothed, &amp;c.</p>
<p>About 1,800 acres of land is cleared at Paramatta and the
adjacent settlements. Owing to the very long drought, the Indian
corn had yielded very short of expectation; but from the very
great quantity of land now clearing, from the officers of the
colony having taken grants, it is thought the next year will make
ample amends. Fresh pork sold at 8d. and 9d. per lb., and a good
fowl at 3s. The few cows they have were all in calf. Sheep and
goats increase fast; the latter in general having three kids. A
supply of black cattle would forward the colony much. Barrington
is head-constable at Paramatta, and renders himself very useful
by his good conduct and attention to his duty.</p>
<p>Norfolk Island, which contains about 1,000 inhabitants, will,
no doubt, in future produce sufficient corn for its own
consumption. Fish is in astonishing plenty there.</p>

<p><small>THIS</small> place is situated eighteen miles inland
from Sydney Cove. I thank God we live at present in a state of
ease and tranquillity, having a plentiful supply of every
necessary from England, the East Indies, and America.</p>
<p>On the 8th of March, at eleven o'clock in the morning, the
last ounce of animal food then in store was actually issued to
all ranks and descriptions of people alike, and nothing but
absolute famine stared us in the face; the labour of the convicts
was remitted, and everyone seemed to despond, when, in the
evening of the same day, the William arrived from London, and a
ship from Bengal, loaded with provisions of every kind.</p>
<p>At present everything bears the appearance of plenty, there
being about 2,000 acres of wheat. I am now a farmer in my own
right, having a grant of 100 acres of fine land, well watered,
and in good cultivation. I have 100 head of fine goats, and am
hopeful by Christmas to have both horses, cows, and sheep. I have
this season returned to his Majesty's stores 1,514 bushels of
Indian corn, at 5s. per bushel, and have now upwards of 1,000
bushels on the farm, in order to pay for men's labour in building
a dwelling-house, barns, out-houses, &amp;c. I have likewise
purchased a farm called Egleton's, containing sixty acres of
land, felled and cleared, for which I paid sixty guineas, and am
going to sow the whole with millet.</p>
<p>Upwards of 4,000 acres of land being cleared, thunder and
lightning are by no means so violent as before. There are nearly
300 convicts whose term of transportation is expired, and who
live by their labour. I have six of those men employed on my farm
at taskwork, who earn from 18s. to a guinea per week, so that no
settler is at a loss for men to perform his work. I am well
persuaded that trade will soon be established between America,
Batavia, Bengal, and the Cape of Good Hope, as this place will at
all times take off the entire cargoes of provisions and liquors.
Goats thrive better than sheep here, and fetch from seven to ten
pounds each.</p>

<h3>A SOLDIER'S LETTER.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from <i>Saunders's News-Letter</i>
of Friday, 31st July, 1795. The Editor describes it as "an
abstract of a narrative written by a native of Derby, in the New
South Wales Corps, now in Botany Bay," adding that its
authenticity could be depended upon. The letter contains internal
evidence of having been written by a passenger on board the
Pitt.]</p>
<p align="right">Sydney, 13th December, 1794.   </p>
<p><small>ON</small> the 17th July, 1791, we sailed from
Portsmouth. After passing the Land's End we bade adieu to our
native country, and for awhile to every sight of terra firma, not
seeing any shore until the 27th, when at a distance we saw Cape
Ortegal (the Spanish shore), which appeared very mountainous.
August 6th, saw the Deserters, three small islands near Madeira.
16th, made Port Praya Bay, Island of St. Jago. This is the first
port we anchored at since we left England. Goats and poultry are
here plentiful. Fruit, viz., pines, grapes, bananas, cocoanuts,
lemons, oranges, tamarinds, &amp;c., are in abundance. It is
intensely hot, burning your feet through your shoes. This place
belongs to the Portuguese; wretched fortifications, and their
military cut as bad a figure. The houses, or more properly huts,
are all on the groundfloor. The native women adorn themselves
beautifully with a cloth gauze of their own manufacture in the
Chinese fashion; like other negroes, they smell filthily of oil.
Fresh water is here very scarce. The current coins
are&mdash;dollar, 5s.; crusado nova, 3s. 2d.; and pistareen, 1s.
In September the seamen and soldiers died three and four in a day
of a fever caught at St. Jago, and I hourly expected the same
fate. It was a dreadful disease, and deprived them of life in
twelve hours raging mad. On the 15th Sept., passed the Line.
October 7, we passed the Tropic of Capricorn. The 8th, anchored
in the delightful harbour of Rio de Janeiro, in South America.
This is truly a pleasant and fertile country. In sailing up the
harbour nature is profusely displayed, and art also, in defence
of this Portuguese settlement, in innumerable batteries. About
five miles from the entrance of the river is the pleasant city of
St. Sebastian; the buildings are lofty and sumptuous, and in
general white. The decorations of their chapels surpass all
description. The Roman Catholic religion appears to be the sole
pleasure of these people. I was admitted into a nunnery; this
also surprised my imagination&mdash;rich, elegant, beautiful, and
sublime. The women do not appear in the daytime, as their
devotions are performed after sunset. No foreigner is suffered
here to walk the streets without being regularly attended
according to his rank. At the corner of almost every street is
the figure of our Saviour, &amp;c., to which the inhabitants pay
great adoration when passing by. They support their religion to
great excess. I observed the priest when administering the
sacrament drink the wine himself. We happened to arrive at a
particular season of their festivity; very beautiful
illuminations were in every street. The market for the negroes up
the country is Sunday, who attend curiously ornamented with
feathers, each village having their colours and music. The people
are very pompous, as every tailor, barber, and boy wears a sword,
tho' in other respects almost naked. Poultry, vegetables, and
fruit plentiful and cheap. English goods of every sort are to be
had at this place.</p>
<p>On the 31st of October we left this luxuriant country, and on
November 26th entered the harbour of Table Bay (Cape of Good
Hope), and saw the remains of the unfortunate ship Guardian. On
the 23rd December left the plentiful and nourishing refreshments
of the Cape; and on the 7th of February, 1792, we passed the
South Cape of Van Dieman's Land. I looked very anxiously at a
continent on which I was likely to spend the prime of my life. We
sailed along the coast until the 14th Feb., when we anchored in
Sydney Cove port. Providence has been good to me the whole
voyage, being almost a stranger to sickness. I have many great
friends here, and live much better than might have been expected
in my station&mdash;in a military life.</p>
<p>The settlement on the coast of New South Wales contains two
principal towns: Sydney, the capital, and Pamaratta [sic]
(formerly named Rose Hill), distant about seventeen miles. Sydney
is situated at the head of a beautiful cove, which leads into an
excellent harbour. Major Grose has made great improvements.
Sydney contains 700 good comfortable huts, exclusive of numerous
brick buildings, the property of Government. The soil is sandy,
but by industry will produce sufficiently. Most of the gentlemen
have farms about four miles from Sydney, which have grown a good
crop of wheat, and I am of opinion that wheat will be plentiful
in a few years. There are many settlers in different parts.</p>
<p>The only or principal thing wanting is cattle, which might be
kept in any number, grass being in plenty. We have many pigs and
goats, but they are chiefly in the hands of gentlemen. Poultry
and fish are tolerably cheap, but it must be remembered that this
is the most flourishing period the colony ever experienced.</p>
<p>Spirits being now plentiful, a number of persons retail the
same, but the price, as well as quality, varies much; the
gentlemen always purchase the cargoes, and this watery mixture is
sold at 16s. per gallon. A convict was not, until very lately, on
any account suffered to take spirits in payment for his work, but
now the prisoners have plenty of liquor. Liquor, or more properly
grog, purchases what money will not, viz., settlers' farms or
crops unripe, &amp;c. Kangaroos formerly were plenty, but they
are retired up the country. The trees never entirely shed their
leaves. The summer is intensely hot, and the winters are very
cold at nights and in the mornings, though the climate is much
milder since I have been here, owing to the country being
cleared. The seasons here are precisely opposite to the seasons
in England, your winter being our summer.</p>
<p>Paramatta is a town situated at the extreme cove of Port
Jackson. On your ascending the wharf appears a row of huts on
each side, and a spacious road to the distance of a mile; at the
upper end, Governor Phillips erected his country seat. The garden
that surrounds it is beautiful, abounding, in the season, with
grapes, melons, pumpkins, and every other fruit and vegetable.
The florist may also amuse himself. In short, the country may
well be called Botany Bay; for the botanist, I believe, may here
find the most beautiful shrubs and evergreens that produce very
fragrant flowers. The Governor's garden at Paramatta is so
situated by nature that, in my opinion, it is impossible for art
to form so rural a scene.</p>
<p>Five miles from Paramatta is another village. At this place
Government have a great deal of land in cultivation. Every mile
you travel inland the soil improves. At fourteen miles from the
village of Irongabber [Toongabbie] is another settlement, called
the Hawkesbury, at which place is a spacious fresh-water river,
and the soil rich; and I have not a doubt but in a short time
this place will be very flourishing.</p>
<p>December 13, 1794.&mdash;The farmers are now gathering their
wheat. It may appear to you extraordinary, but true it is, that
the summers will produce two crops of vegetables. The quantity of
timber surpasses all description, though the country has been so
much cleared since I came. A great number of boats have been
built, which supply us with plenty of fish, and the oysters are
the largest I ever saw.</p>
<p>About nine days sail from Sydney is Norfolk Island, a most
fertile place, about the size of the Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>The natives, in general, of Botany Bay are tall and slender,
with very black curly hair, flat faces, and very large mouths;
some of them run sticks through their nose; they draw the front
tooth in tribute to their chief, are much scarified on the back
and breast, done by an oyster-shell cemented with gum at the end
of the whommora (or throwing-stick); they talk very quick, dance
by raising their arms and wheeling in a circle, at same time
singing or making a continued noise. One of the females sits
thumping her stomach, which gives a droll sound. They burn their
dead, are very expert at throwing their spears, and with
exactness at a great distance. Their canoes are formed of solid
bark, which they carve from the trees by means of a stone axe.
They fight in a most savage manner. Their subsistence is chiefly
on fish, the women being very expert at this duty; the lines are
curiously platted from the bark of trees, and the hook is a piece
of bark (sic). They assemble in small tribes, each having a
different size. The children, when young, ride on the parents'
shoulders, holding by the hair of the head. After death they
expect a removal to the sun, which they worship. They are a very
dirty and lazy set of people.</p>
<p>The D&aelig;dalus, that conveys this, takes also our worthy
Major Grose and family to Europe, and we expect Governor Hunter
soon. My commanding officer, prior to his departure, was pleased
to give me a grant of twenty-five acres of good rich land for
ever, so that in a short time I hope to be a respectable farmer,
having besides with me a hut of three comfortable rooms, a good
garden of half an acre of land, where I have every production of
this place in profusion. My live stock at present are two pigs,
twelve fowls, three pigeons, a dog and a cat, which with my
station, stock, garden, and farm, give sufficient employ.</p>

<h3>TREATMENT OF CONVICTS PENDING TRANSPORTATION.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from <i>Saunders's News-Letter</i>
of Friday, 1st May, 1795.]</p>
<p><small>IT</small> is really surprising that Government does
not somehow dispose of such convicts as are sentenced to
transportation. Their staying confined for a great length of
time, sometimes even for years, is inflicting a punishment that
the law does not warrant, and far exceeds the sentence pronounced
on them. Besides, this will appear to be a very cruel neglect,
when it is considered that the term of their transportation does
not commence till they are actually embarked, and their
imprisonment is a superaddition of punishment. One of those who
escaped** was four years in prison under that rule&mdash;a very
decent prologue to seven years' transportation. Add to this, that
the long continuance of prisoners before they are sent away is a
very heavy expense on the city of Dublin, which is obliged to
support them till they are embarked.</p>

<p><small>THIS</small> settlement is wonderfully improved since
the time I left it. It appears now to be making rapid progress
towards an independence for provision. Our corn-fields (wheat) at
this moment appear as beautiful and luxuriant as any I ever saw
in any part of the world; and barring those accidents to which
all countries are liable, we shall have a rich and abundant
harvest. Our gardens are equally productive; we shall have a
variety of fruit, European as well as tropical. Our grapes are in
immense quantities; some of the gentlemen, from their own
gardens, expect to make a butt, some two butts, of wine this
year. The few cattle we have are thriving exceedingly. The sheep
and goats are wonderfully prolific; three lambs at a time is no
uncommon thing, and that twice a year; the goats still more so.
We find the best breed of sheep to be between the small Bengal
ewe and the large Cape ram; they produce a middle size, which is
delicate fine meat. All the superfluous males among the goats are
prepared for the pot or spit, and are so fine that I would defy
even an epicure to say whether it was mutton or caperate he was
eating.</p>

<h3>MUTINY ON A CONVICT-SHIP.</h3>
<p align="center"><b><small>EXTRACT</small> from a letter from an
officer on board the Marquis Cornwallis, East Indiaman, to his
brother, in London.*</b></p>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from the <i>True Briton</i>, 18th
June, 1796.]</p>
<p align="right">St. Helena, 22nd October, 1795.   </p>
<p><small>ON</small> the 11th of September we discovered a most
desperate plot formed by the men convicts, who, to the number of
163, are the most horrid ruffians that ever left the kingdom of
Ireland. They were on the point of putting the captain, officers,
and ship's company to death, when one of them, either through the
fear of punishment or from a hope of reward, discovered the whole
affair. It was a common practice for Captain Hogan and the
officers of the deck to go down and see that their berths were
clean twice a week, at which time they were to watch an
opportunity to seize the captain, surgeon, and such other
officers as were down with them, whom they were to put to death
with their own swords, and force their way upon deck, where they
were to be assisted by the Serjeant, corporal, and some of the
private soldiers, who were to dispatch the officers upon deck,
and also supply the convicts with arms. We got the ringleaders
upon deck, to the number of forty, who, after a severe
punishment, confessed the whole.</p>
<p>We thought this might put a stop to any further proceedings,
but in this we were much mistaken. About two nights after they
made an attempt to break out. They began by strangling the man
who discovered the plot; while the rest were to force down the
bulkhead, force their way upon deck, put those not in the plot to
death, and take possession of the ship, or die in the attempt.
The captain and officers did all in their power to appease them
by fair words, and also by threats, but all would not do; they
were desperate.</p>
<p>Captain Hogan rushed down the fore hatchway, followed by Mr.
Richardson and three more of the officers and myself, armed with
a pair of pistols and cutlass each, where began a scene which was
not by any means pleasant.</p>
<p>We stuck together in the hatchway, and discharged our pistols
amongst them that were most desperate, who, seeing their comrades
drop in several places, soon felt a damp upon their spirits;
their courage failed them, and they called out for quarter. I
broke my cutlass in the affray, but met with no accident myself.
There were none killed upon the spot, but seven have since died
of their wounds. The Serjeant was severely punished, and is since
dead.</p>

<h3>STATE OF THE SETTLEMENT IN 1795.*</h3>
<p class="source">[* Reprinted from <i>Saunders's News-Letter</i>
of Monday, 30th January, 1797.]</p>
<p><small>LETTERS</small> from Port Jackson, dated the 21st of
December, 1795, mention that the settlement then was in a very
flourishing state, and that the harvest, which was then
collecting, was so abundant as to be thought equal to two years'
consumption. The only scarcity was that of animal food. The
capital of the colony is Sydney town, The other settlements are
Hawkesbury and Parra Matee. The productions of the country are
but few; at least, they have not been fortunate enough to make
any recent discovery; the interior is, however, little known.</p>
<p>The following fact is a striking instance of the want of
enterprise and activity. A few days after the first arrival of
the colony (now eight years since) a bull and six cows strayed
from their keeper into the woods. A fear of venturing far amongst
the natives, then somewhat hostile, repressed all attempts to
regain them; indolence succeeded these fears, and no search was
ever instituted. Some time since, an officer's servant, shooting
in the woods, between twenty and thirty miles from Sydney,
discovered them, and conducted the Governor and a party of his
friends to the spot, where they found a heard consisting of
nearly sixty head of remarkably fine cattle. The bull attacked
the party, who, with some difficulty, escaped unhurt. That a
neighbourhood of thirty miles by land, presenting no unusual
obstacles to an adventurer, should, in the almost starving state
of the colony, have remained unexplored for so long a period, is
not to be accounted for otherwise than by the apathy or
despondency of the settlers.</p>
<p>Muir, Skirving, Margarot, and Gerald are there, and treated
with every possible indulgence; their conduct had been exemplary.
Of Palmer, as much cannot be said. Gerald was very ill. Each of
these had grants of land, and were allowed convicts to clear
their ground.</p>
<p>The accounts from Norfolk Island do not represent that place
in so favourable a light.</p>
