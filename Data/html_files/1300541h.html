<h3>1. NARRATIVE OF THE SHIPWRECK OF CAPTAIN HAMILTON AND THE
CREW OF THE SYDNEY COVE</h3>
<br>
<p><small>CAPTAIN HAMILTON</small> is a native of Glasgow. The
Sydney Cove, Captain Guy Hamilton, left Bengal on the 10th
November, 1796, on a voyage to Port Jackson, in New South Wales.
On the 13th December, in lat. 15&deg; 30' south, experienced a
severe gale of wind, with a heavy sea. The weather continued
variable, generally with strong gales and a high sea, till
towards the middle of January. During this time the ship laboured
much from the violence of the weather, making from 6 to 8 inches
water in an hour. The leak was judged to be under the starboard
bow. In order to get at it the forehold was unstowed. The rushing
in of the water was distinctly heard; but the leak could not be
reached, owing to its being seated at the back of a timber. On
the 13th January a thrummed sail was got over the starboard bow,
and passed under the bottom, which reduced the leak from 6 to 4
inches an hour. In this way the ship continued till the 25th
January, when a gale of extreme violence set in from the S.W. In
handing the topsails, Mr. Leishman, second mate, was lost from
the main topsail yard-arm. The ship was kept before the wind,
which continued blowing with such fury that a new foresail, a
main topsail and driver, were torn from the yards, though handed
and carefully secured. Being thus without any sail bent, by which
the ship could be kept ahead of the sea, she was hove to. The
gale continued, and the sea running dreadfully high, caused the
ship to labour greatly and the leak to increase. The weather was
intensely cold, with constant rain, from which the crew suffered
considerably. The lascars were well supplied with blankets and
warm clothing, shipped on purpose at Bengal; yet they were so
benumbed by the severity of the weather that neither entreaty nor
force could prevail on them to work on deck at the pumps. There
being 4 feet water, and gaining fast, all hands were sent down to
bale from the well. The lascars being thus sheltered from the
inclemency of the weather and sea, which incessantly beat over
them on deck, worked with cheerfulness. By noon next day the
water was reduced to 2 feet; but the violence of the weather
continuing, the people could have no intermission from pumping
and baleing. Such was their fatigue that two men dropped dead
under the labour of the pumps, and a third died a few hours
afterwards. After a severe and tedious night, exhausted in
pumping and baleing, the well was cleared of water, and the gale
abating a little, a new foresail was bent, and the ship then made
sail with the wind at west.</p>
<p>On the 27th January a new thrummed piece of canvas was got
over the starboard bow. At this time the leak had increased
between 11 and 12 inches an hour. By next day the fothering had
reduced it to 8 inches, not'hstanding the sea was very heavy;
yet, from the weak and sickly state of the crew, it was found
impossible to keep the water under. On the 1st February, in lat.
40&deg; 1' south, made the coast of New Holland, and rounding Van
Dieman's Land, stood to the northward. On the 4th passed the
Maria Island, 4 leagues distant. From this time the gale
continued to encrease till the 7th, when it blew so hard as to
bring the ship under courses. On the 8th February, observed in
the latitude 40&deg; 56' south, longitude by timepiece, 149&deg;
40' east of Greenwich. The gale now encreased to a perfect
hurricane, with a dreadful sea. At half-past 3 p.m. sprung a new
leak, which gained so fast on the pumps as rendered it necessary
to bear up for land to save the lives of the people, and, if
possible, to get the ship into a place of security. Bore in
accordingly for the land and made more sail, Cape Barras by
accounts W. &frac12;N. or W. and by N., distant by accounts 90
miles. The cargo was thrown overboard; but notwithstanding every
exertion to keep the leak under, at 5 p.m. there were 2&frac12;
feet water in the well, and hourly gaining. At 8 p.m. the water
had increased to 5 feet, and the ship settling fast, the longboat
was got clear&mdash;still running west and carrying a press of
sail in order to get in with the land. By midnight the water was
nearly up to the lower-deck hatches. At half-past 12 saw the land
about 2 miles distant; but appearing to be high perpendicular
rocks with a heavy surf, it was thought advisable to heave to
till the morning. At daybreak the water was over the comings of
the lower-deck hatches, and the vessel lying on one side with the
channels on the water. At daylight, having with difficulty got
her head round, made all sail possible towards the land, but from
her being so much waterlogged she would hardly answer her helm.
Stood in for an opening in the land, but could get no ground at
75 fathoms, though but a small distance from an island ahead.
When a little nearer in with the land got ground in 15 fathoms.
Finding the ship must soon go down, the longboat was got out and
sent ashore to the island** with some rice, ammunition, and
firearms; still standing in for the island, till she struck on a
sandy bottom in 19 feet water, a few minutes after the longboat
left her.</p>
<p class="foot">[** This island was called Preservation Island, a
name it still retains. It is one of the Furneaux Group. Clarke
Island and Armstrong Channel also derived their names from the
circumstances of this wreck. (See Chart)]</p>
<p>All the people being safely landed, small parties were sent
out in different directions on the following day, the 9th
February, in quest of water, but without success. A well was then
sunk. After digging 7&frac12; feet they met with water, a little
brackish, with which they were obliged to be content, as none
could be procured from the wreck; but from the 10th till the 27th
February Capt. Hamilton was employed in equipping the longboat in
order to dispatch her to Port Jackson with an account of the loss
of the ship, and to request such assistance as could be afforded.
The longboat being completed, was dispatched on the 27th February
in charge of Mr. Hugh Thompson, chief mate, with Mr. W. Clark,
assistant supercargo, and fifteen men, the best of the crew.</p>
<p>After the departure of the longboat, Capt. Hamilton and the
people remaining with him were employed in getting ashore various
parts of the cargo from the wreck. The stock of provisions saved
being but small, and the time when relief might arrive uncertain,
each man's daily allowance of rice was limited to a
teacupful.</p>
<p>The weather proved extremely cold, with constant gales and
heavy rains, and the people, having no other shelter than tents
made from old sails, suffered greatly.</p>
<p>From the 23rd April till the 1st May was one continued storm,
with thunder, lightening, rain, and extreme cold. The tents being
soon dismantled and blown to pieces, the unfortunate sufferers
were left exposed to the extremities of cold, wetness, and
hunger, for during the continuance of this storm it was
impossible to keep always fire to dress the pittance of rice on
which their subsistance depended.</p>
<p>On the 1st of May the weather moderated, but the people were
so much reduced that they were unable to rescue anything farther
from the wreck. All hands were therefore set to work to build a
house, as without some protection inevitable death threatened to
result from the recurrence of such weather as they had lately
experienced.</p>
<p>On the 8th of June the sufferings of their associates in
misfortune were interrupted by the welcome sight of a longboat to
the westward of the island, apparently looking for the wreck.
Gladness now sat on every countenance&mdash;every look, every
gesture, bespoke the fulness of their joy; the miseries of four
sad dreary months were now forgotten in the transport of the
moment. As soon as their first emotions had subsided the
jollyboat was launched, the nimblest of the crew leaped on board,
and eagerly stood out to follow the vessel in the offing. But
what language can convey any adequate idea of their grief on
perceiving the object of their pursuit standing before the wind
directly from the island! Continuing her course, the lapse of a
few minutes carried her out of sight, and with her fled all the
hopes and joys which she had so lately excited. Their
disappointment and despair, heightened by the excess of their
late expectations, may be readily conceived. They did not,
however, neglect any measure that could yet afford a gleam of
hope. The jollyboat returned to the island. The English colours
were hoisted, and a large fire prepared which might be visible
some leagues at sea. To their unspeakable joy a schooner was seen
next day to the eastward, but the surf run so high as to prevent
any attempts to go off to her in the jollyboat.</p>
<p>On the ensuing day, 10th June, the sloop-rigged boat that had
been seen on the 8th again appeared, and approaching the island,
the jollyboat was sent on board. She proved to be a sloop,
private property, sent to their assistance from Port Jackson, out
ten days, and navigated by Mr. Armstrong, master of his Majesty's
ship Supply.*** The vessel in the offing was his Majesty's
schooner Francis, sent from Port Jackson to the assistance of
Captain Hamilton and his men by his Excellency Governor
Hunter.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** This boat was wrecked on the voyage back to
Sydney; the master and crew were never heard of.&mdash;Ante, p.
309. (4. Letter)]</p>
<p>Having loaded the two vessels with a part of the cargo from
the wreck of the Sydney Cove, they were ready to sail on their
return to Port Jackson by the 20th June. The cargo saved being
more than the two vessels could take on board, five of Captain
Hamilton's men volunteered to remain on the island to take care
of the cargo left, till he should be able to return from Port
Jackson with a vessel of sufficient size to bring off the whole.
Matters being thus arranged the two vessels sailed on the 21st,
and after a stormy passage of fifteen days the Francis safely
arrived at Port Jackson.</p>

<h3>2. VOYAGE OF THE SYDNEY COVE'S LONGBOAT FROM PRESERVATION
ISLAND TO PORT JACKSON.</h3>
<br>
<p>THE longboat, being equipped and ready for sea, was dispatched
on the 28th of February, as already stated, in order to proceed
to Port Jackson with intelligence of the shipwreck. Mr. Thomson,
late chief mate of the Sydney Cove, Mr. Clark, supercargo, three
European seamen, and twelve lascars, in all seventeen persons,
embarked. They pursued a southerly**** course till the 1st of
March, lat. 38&deg; S. by account, having had no observation for
several days. On the evening of this day it began to blow, and
soon increased to a stormy gale, with a heavy sea, by which the
boat was in great danger of foundering. They were at an
inconsiderable distance from the shore; but the surf broke with
such violence as to prevent the possibility of approaching with
safety. Being unable to land, the only chance of preservation was
to come to with both anchors, which was accordingly done. The
boat lay in the most imminent danger from being often almost
entirely filled with water by the heavy sea, which during the
night continued to break over her. In this perilous situation
they remained till daylight, when they cut both cables and set
the foresail; but the boat at this time suddenly filling, it was
not without the utmost difficulty that they got her through the
surf, when she went to pieces a few minutes after the people had
gained the beach.</p>
<p class="foot">[**** Evidently an error or misprint for
"northerly". A southerly course would have landed them on
Tasmania.]</p>
<p>Imagination cannot picture a situation more melancholy than
that to which the unfortunate crew was reduced&mdash;wrecked a
second time on the inhospitable shore of New South Wales; cut off
from all hopes of rejoining their companions; without provisions,
without arms, or any probable means either of subsistence or
defence, they seemed doomed to all the horrors of a lingering
death, with all their misfortunes unknown and unpitied. In this
trying situation they did not abandon themselves to despair; they
determined to proceed to the northward in the hopes of reaching
Port Jackson, although the distance of the settlement, the
unfrequented deserts they were to traverse, and the barbarous
hordes among whom they had to gain their way, presented
difficulties that required no ordinary share of fortitude to
encounter and perseverance to overcome; but danger and difficulty
lessen as they approach&mdash;the mind, as if its ultimate
strength were reserved for arduous occasions, reconciles itself
with calm resignation to sufferings from which, on a more distant
view, it would recoil with horror.</p>
<p>It was thus with our little party: the dangers that surrounded
them served but to excite them to exertion; they resolved to
brave every difficulty, and to commence their journey without
delay. The three days following the loss of their boat were spent
in collecting such articles as had been thrown on shore from the
wreck. On the 15th they began their march. The principal
occurrences in the course of the journey are related in the
following abstract of a journal, compiled partly from
recollection, and partly from the assistance of memoranda written
with a pencil.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The memoranda were evidently written by the
supercargo, Mr. Clark.]</p>
<p>March 15th.&mdash;We began our journey for Port Jackson</p>
<p>16th.&mdash;Walked 16 or 18 miles along a sandy beach.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** It is probable from this and from the
estimated latitude of 38&deg; S. given above that the boat was
cast ashore on the northern part of the Ninety-mile Beach.]</p>
<p>17th.&mdash;Passed several small rivers, and one so large that
we were obliged to construct a raft to cross it. From the
detention this occasioned walked only 8 miles.</p>
<p>18th.&mdash;Forded several branches of rivers. We this day
fell in with a party of natives, about fourteen, all of them
entirely naked. They were struck with astonishment at our
appearance, and were very anxious to examine every part of our
clothes and body, in which we readily indulged them. They viewed
us most attentively. They opened our clothes, examined our feet,
hands, nails, &amp;c., frequently expressing their surprize by
laughing and loud shoutings. From their gestures during this
awkward review it was easy to perceive that they considered our
clothes and bodies as inseparably joined. Having made them a
present of a few stripes of cloth, which they appeared highly
delighted with, we pursued our journey, and halted in the
evening, after a march of 30 miles.</p>
<p>The natives on this part of the coast appear strong and
muscular, with heads rather large in proportion to their bodies.
The flat nose, the broad thick lips which distinguish the
African, also prevail amongst the people on this coast. Their
hair is long and straight, but they are wholly inattentive to it,
either as to cleanliness or in any other respect. It serves them
in lieu of a towel to wipe their hands as often as they are
daubed with blubber or shark oil, which is their principal
article of food. This frequent application of rancid grease to
their heads and bodies renders their approach exceedingly
offensive. Their ornaments consist chiefly of fish-bones or
kangaroo-teeth, fastened with gum or glue to the hair of the
temples and on the forehead. A piece of reed or bone is also wore
through the septum, or cartilage, of the nose, which is pierced
for the admission of this ornament. Upon the whole, they present
the most hideous and disgusting figures that savage life can
possibly afford.</p>
<p>19th.&mdash;Met with a pretty large river, which we were
unable to cross till low water, there being no wood from which we
could construct a raft. A few natives on the opposite bank of the
river ran off at our approach.</p>
<p>20th.&mdash;This day we procured a few shellfish on the rocks.
We walked about 16 miles along the seaside, part of the way over
very high bluffs and sharp rocks.</p>
<p>21st.&mdash;This morning went inland about 3 or 4 miles. Made
a raft and crossed a large river. Its banks were delightful; the
trees, tall and majestic, added dignity to the stream, and gave
the surrounding country a beautiful and picturesque appearance.
Saw a few of the natives, who, at first sight, advanced, but on a
nearer approach they fled and concealed themselves in the woods.
Among the different groupes of natives it is remarkable we have
not yet seen a woman. Walked 16 miles this day.</p>
<p>22nd.&mdash;This day's walk was rendered very disagreeable by
constant heavy rain.</p>
<p>23rd.&mdash;The weather to-day was delightful; the agreeable
temperance, together with the beautiful scenery that opened to
our view through a most delightful country, compensated in a
great measure for the inclemency of yesterday's journey. We had a
distant prospect inland of some very high hills, covered to their
summit with lofty trees. In the evening we halted, after a march
of 18 miles.</p>
<p>24th.&mdash;We had travelled about 7 miles when our progress
was stopt by an immense river, which emptied itself in the ocean
by several branches. We began to prepare a raft, in order to
cross the river before us.</p>
<p>25th, 26th, and 27th.&mdash;These three days were employed in
completing the raft and crossing the different branches of the
river.</p>
<p>28th.&mdash;In the course of this day's journey we reached an
island, about 5 miles distant from the seashore. This place
appears well suited to afford shelter to shipping, being
completely landlocked and covered from the wind. In the latter
part of the days march we had to traverse hills of sands, which
made it exceedingly fatiguing; nevertheless we travelled about 12
miles.</p>
<p>29th.&mdash;On crossing a narrow but deep river one of the
natives threatened to dispute our landing, but approaching with a
determined appearance no actual resistance was attempted, and a
reconciliation was effected by the distribution of a few stripes
of cloth. A good understanding being thus established, the men
called to their wives and children, who were concealed behind the
rocks, and who now ventured to shew themselves. These were the
first women we had seen; from their cries and laughing it is
evident they were greatly astonished at our appearance. The men
did not think proper to admit of our coming sufficiently near to
have a full or perfect view of their ladies, but we were near
enough to discern that they were the most wretched objects we had
ever seen&mdash;equally filthy as the men, coarse and
ill-featured, and so devoid of delicacy or any appearance of it
that they seem to have nothing even human about them but the
form. We pursued our way and walked about 10 miles.</p>
<p>30th.&mdash;Crossed a small river this morning, and walked
about 8 miles through a country interspersed with hills and
covered with heath. We came to a pretty large river, which, being
too deep to ford, we began to prepare a raft, which we could not
have completed till next day had not three of our native friends,
from whom we parted yesterday, rejoined us and assisted us over.
We were much pleased with their attention, for the act was really
kind, as they knew we had this river to cross, and appear to have
followed us purposely to lend their assistance. In the evening we
travelled about 4 miles farther, and rested for the night.</p>
<p>31st.&mdash;Walked about 18 miles round a very deep bay and
many small rivers opening into it.</p>
<p>April 1st.&mdash;Passed through a very pleasant country, whose
delightful verdure, strewed over with a variety of flowers,
rendered a walk of 20 miles this day extremely agreeable.</p>
<p>April 2nd.&mdash;Travelled 8 miles this forenoon. Between 9
and 10 o'clock we were most agreeably surprised by meeting five
of the natives, our old friends, who received us in a very
amicable manner, and kindly treated us with some shellfish, which
formed a very acceptable meal, as our small pittance of rice was
nearly expended. After this little repast we proceeded 6 miles
further and halted.</p>
<p>3rd.&mdash;Had a fatiguing march over very high bluffs, sharp
rocks, and afterwards through very thick brushwood, interspersed
with stumps of trees and other sharp substances, by which our
feet were so much bruised and wounded that some of the party
remained lame for some time afterwards; and to aggravate our
sufferings we were now living upon a quarter of a pint of dry
rice per diem. As we got out of this harassing thicket we missed
two of our unhappy fellow-travellers. At 4 p.m. we provided
ourselves a lodging for the night, having walked, or rather
crawled, 10 miles, over the ground above described.</p>
<p>4th.&mdash;Waited for our missing companions until 12 o'clock,
when, to our great joy, they made their appearance; we then
proceeded on our journey, and in the evening came to a very broad
river. It being low water, some places were very shallow, which
enabled us to catch a few small skate, which were, indeed, very
acceptable. Walked this day 8 miles.</p>
<p>5th.&mdash;Reached the opposite bank of the river, where we
remained a few hours to catch some more fish, in which we happily
succeeded; among them was a very fine shark about 4 feet long;
this was a refreshment for which we offered our thanks to
Providence, the rice, our only certain resource, being now nearly
at an end.</p>
<p>6th.&mdash;Having got a tolerable supply of fish, pursued our
journey for about 18 miles through a delightful plain,
interspersed here and there with a few scattered trees.</p>
<p>7th.&mdash;Went some way into the country, over hills and
valleys. After a walk of 16 miles we halted at twilight, and as
we reclined our heads to rest on a bank we could just hear the
roaring of the surf on the seashore.</p>
<p>8th.&mdash;Bent our way towards the beach this morning, and
travelled along about 9 miles, when we were stopped by our old
impediment, a river, at which we were obliged to wait until low
water before we could cross. We had scarcely surmounted this
difficulty when a greater danger stared us in the face, for here
we were met by about fifty armed natives. Having never before
seen so large a body collected, it is natural to conclude that we
were much alarmed. However, we resolved to put the best
appearance on the matter, and to betray no symptons of fear. In
consequence of the steps we took, and after some preliminary
signs and gestures on both sides, we came to some understanding,
and the natives were apparently amicable in their designs. We
presented them with a few yards of calico, for they would not be
satisfied with small stripes, and, indeed, we were glad to get
rid of them at any expence, for their looks and demeanour were
not such as to invite greater intimacy.</p>
<p>9th.&mdash;Proceeding this morning on our journey, we were
again alarmed at the approach of the party who detained us
yesterday, and whom we so justly suspected of treacherous
intentions. They came on with dreadful shoutings, which gave us
warning to prepare for defence, and to give them a warm reception
in case violence should be offered. Fortunately, however, from
the particular attention we paid to their old men, whom we
supposed to be their chiefs, and making them some small presents,
they soon left us. This dispersion gave our little party general
satisfaction, as we were doubtful how the affair, might have
terminated. During our conference, and at their departure,
several of them had placed their spears in the throwing-sticks,
ready to discharge at us. We now pursued our route, and walked
about 10 miles.</p>
<p>10th.&mdash;We were overtaken by a few of the natives with
whom we parted yesterday, but seeing us on our guard, with our
one gun, two pistols, and two small swords, while others were
armed with clubs, and perceiving our resolution not to be imposed
upon, they acted with more prudence than heretofore. We did not
at this meeting indulge them with any presents, but to one gave a
piece of cloth, in exchange for a large kangaroo's tail, with
which we endeavoured to make some soup, by adding a little of the
rice we had remaining, from which we received great nourishment,
being much weakened by the fatigue and want which we had suffered
in these inhospitable regions. Our walk of 14 miles this day was
performed over a number of rugged and disagreeable heights, until
we came to a river, which we crossed, and then betook ourselves
to the cheerless turf until the morning.</p>
<p>11th.&mdash;Walked 8 miles and came to a river, where we met
fourteen natives, who conducted us to their miserable abodes in
the wood adjoining to a large lagoon, and kindly treated us with
mussels, for which unexpected civility we made them some
presents. These people seemed better acquainted with the laws of
hospitality than any of their countrymen whom we had yet seen,
for to their benevolent treat was added an invitation to remain
with them for the night. They did not, however, lodge us in their
nominal huts, but after we were seated around our resting-place
they brought their women and children to see us, and certainly,
to judge from the attention with which they surveyed us, we
afforded them no small share of entertainment. As far as we could
understand, these natives were of a different tribe from those we
had seen, and were then at war with them. They possessed a
liberality to which the others were strangers, and freely gave us
a part of the little they had, which the others were so far from
doing that they would have deprived us of the last article in our
possession had they not been overawed by the sight of arms,
against which they knew not how to defend themselves. We
endeavoured to make our entertainers sensible by signs how rudely
their neighbours had behaved to us; to compensate for which both
the old and the young were anxious to give us part of their
shellfish.</p>
<p>12th.&mdash;Met with another party of the natives who did not
attempt to molest us. Walked 16 miles over rising ground and
along the seaside, where we found a dead skate, which, though a
little tainted, would not have been unacceptable to an epicure
with our appetite.</p>
<p>13th.&mdash;Came to a large river, where we met with a few
natives, who appeared very timorous at seeing us; but in a short
time we came to a better understanding, and they kindly carried
us over in their canoes. This was not accomplished without
several duckings, for their rude little vehicles formed of bark,
tied at both ends with twigs, and not exceeding 8 feet in length,
by 2 in breadth, are precarious vessels for one unacquainted with
them to embark in, though the natives, of whom they will carry
three or four, paddle about in them with the greatest facility
and security. After crossing the river, and receiving a few small
fish at parting, we walked 10 miles.</p>
<p>14th.&mdash;Met with no obstruction during a walk of 18
miles.</p>
<p>15th.&mdash;We were joined by our last friends, who ferried us
over a very large river in their canoes. Whether this meeting was
the effect of chance or one of their fishing excursions, or that
perceiving we should find it difficult they had come to our
assistance, we could not determine; but had it not been for their
aid we must have been detained here for some time in making a
raft. The greatest part of the wood of the country being very
heavy will not swim, unless it has been felled for some time and
exposed to the sun, a fact which we had already been taught by
miserable experience. Having walked 9 miles after crossing the
river, we rested for the night, and boiled a few shellfish we had
picked up by the way like good oeonomists, making them serve for
both dinner and supper, for our little evening's cookery formed
the only meal we could daily afford ourselves, unless we ventured
to eat a few wild plants which we sometimes picked up.</p>
<p>16th.&mdash;Having walked about 12 miles we once more met with
our friends, who, a third time, conveyed us over a large river at
a shallow part, which they pointed out. On the banks of this
river we remained for the night. Our poor unfortunate companions,
worn out by want and excessive fatigue, now began to drop behind
very fast. At this place we were under the painful necessity of
leaving nine of our fellow-sufferers behind, they being totally
unable to proceed further; but we flattered ourselves they would
be able to come up with us in a day or two, as we now often stopt
some time with the natives when we found them kind to us, or
loitered about the rocks to pick up shellfish or collect
herbs.</p>
<p>April 17th.&mdash;Had a pleasant walk about 5 miles along the
seacoast until we came to a narrow but deep river, in endeavoring
to cross which an unlucky accident happened to Mr. Thomson, and
which nearly proved fatal, We found an old canoe on the bank, in
which three or four of our party got to the opposite side, and
proceeded on their journey. Mr. Thomson, who could not swim, in
making an effort to cross, was left struggling in the water by
the canoe sinking under him. This was witnessed by four Bengal
blacks, who, though they were adepts at swimming, stood unmoved
spectators. I instantly jumped in and flew to his relief,
although very much fatigued and very cold. I seized him by the
hair and drew him to the shore motionless. My first care was to
place him over a rock with his head downwards, pressing him at
the same time on the back, by which means he discharged much
sea-water by the mouth, and in a little time recovered.</p>
<p>18th.&mdash;The illness of Mr. Thompson, occasioned by the
accident, prevented our walking more than 8 miles this day.</p>
<p>19th.&mdash;Came up with those who went before us the 17th.
Were again stopped by a very large river, which the violence of
the wind prevented us from crossing. We therefore employed
ourselves in collecting muscles, which, in our present situation,
was a great relief, having been without a more generous
nourishment for two days before.</p>
<p>20th.&mdash;Got over the river and had a long walk, about 18
miles, through an immense wood, the plain of which was covered
with long grass. We had the good fortune this day to have a
friendly native in company, who undertook to be our guide, by
whose good-natured assistance we were enabled to avoid several
high points and cut off a great deal of ground.</p>
<p>21st.&mdash;Had a pleasant walk for about 14 miles, during
which we met a party of natives who gave us plenty of fishes. It
seems they had met the Moor whose friendship we experienced
yesterday, and were by him informed of our distress, so that we
were indebted to that kind-hearted fellow for his guidance and
this day's protection.</p>
<p>22nd.&mdash;The natives accompanied us a few miles and
returned, leaving with us a plentiful supply of fish. This day we
walked 12 miles.</p>
<p>23rd, 24th, 25th.&mdash;Walked 10 or 12 miles each day,
without meeting with any natives, and being wholly without
nourishment almost perished for want.</p>
<p>26th.&mdash;At 9 a.m. observed several natives on the top of a
high bluff, who came down to us as we approached, and remained
with us for some time. When we had made signs to them that we
were hungry and much exhausted, they brought us plenty of fish
and treated us very kindly. After we had refreshed ourselves and
put up some fish to carry with us, we were preparing to proceed,
when about fifty strong natives made their appearance, of whom we
soon took leave, giving them such little presents as we could
afford, and with which they were apparently well satisfied. We
had not parted more than twenty or thirty minutes when a hundred
more approached us, shouting and hallowing in a most hideous
manner, at which we were all exceedingly alarmed. In a short time
a few of them began throwing their spears, upon which we made
signs to them to desist, giving them some presents, and appearing
no ways dismayed at their conduct&mdash;any other demeanour on
our part would have been quite superfluous, having only one
musket unloaded and two pistols out of repair, and at best were
only six opposed to such a multitude, for our little company were
daily dropping off. No sooner had we turned our backs on this
savage mob than they renewed hostilities and wounded three or us,
viz., Mr. Hugh Thompson, myself, and my servant. Notwithstanding
this disaster, we, in our painful situation, proceeded 8 miles,
to get clear, if possible, of these savages; but just as we came
up to a very deep bay they overtook us again. This pursuit
induced us all to suppose they intended to murder us&mdash;as we
were, however, to make a virtue of necessity, and to remain among
them all that night, though it may be well supposed that the
anguish of our minds and the pain of our wounds prevented the
possibility of sleep.</p>
<p>27th.&mdash;Our disagreeable and treacherous companions
continued with us on our journey until about 9 a.m., when they
betook themselves to the woods, leaving us extremely happy at
their departure. We continued our route along this extensive bay
10 miles.</p>
<p>29th.&mdash;Met with some brakish water, which we eagerly
swallowed; indeed, all the rivers we examined were impregnated
with salt-water from their connection with the sea. Walked 14
miles.</p>
<p>30th.&mdash;We this morning reached the largest river we had
met with since we came to this large bay. Its width put us
entirely to a stand, and prevented our crossing over until the
evening. As we were devising means to accomplish our design six
natives very fortunately came to our assistance. They seemed,
however, suspicious of us, for when we reached the opposite bank
we made signs that we wanted water, and, under pretence of going
for some, they set off, but never returned. We were not able to
proceed any more than 3 miles this day.</p>
<p>The fifteen following days of our journey were much the same
as the preceding, until we very fortunately met with a
fishing-boat about 14 miles to the southward of Botany Bay.</p>
<p>On the arrival of Mr. Clark and his unfortunate companions at
Port Jackson, they were received by his Excellency Governor
Hunter with such kindness and humanity as it were impossible to
describe, though its grateful remembrance never can be effaced
nor diminished.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark embarked for China in September, on board the
Britannia. At that time no accounts had been received at Port
Jackson of the small schooner* which had brought away a part of
the late crew of the Sydney Cove from the island on which they
were wrecked. From the boisterous weather which had prevailed and
the length of time she was missing, it was feared she had been
totally lost.</p>
<p class="foot">[* This was the longboat Eliza, commanded by Mr.
Armstrong, master of the Supply, and not the schooner Francis,
which returned safely to Port Jackson.]</p>

<p>My Lord,</p>
<p>A ship nam'd the Sydney Cove having been loaded with a cargo
of goods upon speculation from Bengal to this port, was wreck'd
in February last upon this coast, in latitude 40&deg; 37' South,*
or about 408 miles to the southward of Port Jackson. Seventeen of
her crew embark'd in the longboat in order to reach the harbor,
and to procure whatever assistance could be had here; but they
were also wreck'd upon the coast 220 miles to the southward of
this port.** They all got on shore, and travel'd along the coast,
and in May last a small row-boat, fishing to the southward of
Botany Bay, discover'd three people on the shore, whom they took
into the boat and brought hither scarsely alive. The remainder of
the seventeen have undoubtedly perish'd or been kill'd by the
natives, these survivors having been much annoy'd and wounded by
them. On their arrival they gave an account of two others whom
they had left a small distance from the place where they met the
boat, but too weak to proceed farther. Upon this information I
immediately sent a whaleboat well mann'd, and put on board her
everything which cou'd be necessary for people in that condition,
as well cloathing as nourishing articles of food, and sent the
same fishermen who had taken up the others in this boat; but
these unfortunate men were not to be found. Some articles they
had were pick'd up cover'd with blood, so that we have reason to
believe they have been murder'd in this helpless state.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The vessel was wrecked on one of the islands
of the Furneaux Group, which is still known as Preservation
Island.&mdash;Appendix A. (Chapters 1, 2)]</p>
<p class="foot">[** The longboat appears to have been wrecked in
the vicinity of Point Everard.]</p>
<p>As soon after as possible I dispatch'd the Colonial schooner
to the southward, together with a deck'd longboat,*** in order to
take off the people who had been left upon the island on which
they had been wreck'd. The schooner is just arriv'd, and has
brought the commander (Mr. Hamilton), the only surviving
European, and the remainder of the Lascars. The commander has
left six of his own people in charge of the property sav'd, one
of whom is one of the three who reach'd this place, and who,
being well recover'd, return'd to the wreck in the schooner. I

on the first of July last, by permission of his Excellency

Majesty's armed vessel under my command, in a small sloop of

Cove, which was wrecked upon the eastern coast of this island, in
latitude 40&deg; 37' S.* After having taken on board the

this place, but being overtaken by a violent storm and seperated,
the Francis arrived alone about the end of the month, since which

<p align="right">Sydney, New South Wales,      <br>
1st March, 1798.   </p>
<p>My Lord Duke,</p>
<p>The tedious repairs which his Majesty's ship Reliance
necessarily required before she could be put in a condition for
going again to sea hav'g given an oportunity to Mr. George Bass,
her surgeon, a young man of a well-informed mind and an active
disposition, to offer himself to be employed in any way in which
he could contribute to the benefit of the public service, I
enquired of him in what way he was desirous of exerting himself,
and he informed me nothing could gratify him more effectually
than my allowing him the use of a good boat and permitting him to
man her with volunteers from the King's ships. I accordingly
furnished him with an excellent whaleboat, well fitted,
victualled, and manned to his wish, for the purpose of examining
along the coast to the southward of this port, as far as he could
with safety and convenience go. His perseverance against adverse
winds and almost incessant bad weather led him as far south as
the latitude of 40.00 S., or a distance from this port, taking
the bendings of the coast, more than of six hundred miles. He
coasted the greatest part of the way, and sedulously examined
every inlet along the shore, which does not in these parts afford
a single harbour fit to admit even a small vessel, except a bay
in latitude 35.06, called Jarvis's Bay, and which was so named by
one of the transport ships, bound here, who entered it, and is
the same called by Captain Cook Longnose Bay.* He explored every
accessible place until he came as far as the southermost parts of
this coast seen by Captain Cook, and from thence until he reached
the northermost land seen by Capt. Furneaux, beyond which he went
westward about sixty miles, where the coast falls away in a
west-north-west direction. Here he found an open ocean westward,
and by the mountainous sea which rolled from that quarter, and no
land discoverable in that direction, we have much reason to
conclude that there is an open strait through, between the
latitude of 39 and 40.12 S., a circumstance which, from many
observations made upon tides and currents thereabouts, I had long
conjectured.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* Long Nose Point was the name Captain Cook gave
to the inner north head of Jervis Bay. The point is that given in
the Admiralty Charts as Dart Point. Cook noted in passing that a
bay existed, but did not give it any name. Lieutenant Bowen, when
he entered the bay in August, 1791, in the transport Atlantic,
named it Jervis Bay, after Sir John Jervis, under whom he had
seen considerable active service in the Navy.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** When commenting upon his voyage in the
Sirius, from Sydney to the Cape, for provisions, in 1788-89,
Hunter remarked that no land was seen to the westward, between
Furneaux Group and the southernmost known part of the coast of
New Holland; and he surmised, from the fact that they had an
easterly set of current with a N.W. wind, that there was either a
very deep gulf or a strait which separated Van Diemen's Land from
New Holland. &mdash;Hunter's Journal, pp. 125, 126.]</p>
<p>It will appear by this discovery that the northermost land
seen by Captain Furneaux is the southernmost extremity of this
coast, and lays in latitude 39.00 S. At the western extremity of
Mr. Bass's coasting voyage he found a very good harbour; but,
unfortunately, the want of provision induced him to return sooner
than he wished and intended, and on passing a small island laying
off the coast he discovered a smoke, and supposed it to have been
made by some natives, with whom he wished to have an opportunity
of conversing. On approaching the shore he found the men were
white, and had some clothing on, and when he came near he
observed two of them take to the water and swim off.* They proved
to be seven of a gang of fourteen who escaped from hence in a
boat on the 2nd of October last, mentioned in letter No. 30,**
and who had been treacherously left on this desolate island by
the other seven, who returned northward. The boat, it seems, was
too small for their whole number, and when they arrived at Broken
Bay, and they boarded another boat in the Hawkesbury with
fifty-six bushels of wheat on board, they went off with her
northward, leaving the old boat on shore.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Bass did not make any allusion to these
escapees in his Journal.&mdash;Ante, pp. 312 to 333.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Ante, p. 345.]</p>
<p>These poor distressed wretches, who were chiefly Irish, would
have endeavoured to travel northward and thrown themselves upon
his Majesty's mercy, but were not able to get from this miserable
island to the mainland. Mr. Bass's boat was too small to
accommodate them with a passage, and, as his provision was nearly
expended, he could only help them to the mainland, where he
furnished them with a musket and ammunition and a pocket-compass,
with lines and fish-hooks. Two of the seven were very ill, and
those he took into his boat, and shared his provision with the
other five, giving them the best directions in his power how to
proceed, the distance being not less than five hundred miles. He
recommended them to keep along the coast the better to enable
them to get food; indeed the difficulties of the country and the
possibility of meeting hostile natives are considerations which
will occasion doubts of their ever being able to reach us.</p>
<p>When they parted with Mr. Bass and his crew, who gave them
what cloaths they could spare, some tears were shed on both
sides. The whaleboat arrived in this port after an absence of
twelve weeks, and Mr. Bass delivered to me his observations on
this adventur'g expedition. I find he made several excursions
into the interior of the country wherever he had an opportunity.
It will be sufficient to say that he found in general a barren,
unpromising country, with very few exceptions, and were it even
better, the want of harbours would render it less
valuable.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** See Bass's own account of this
voyage.&mdash;Ante, pp. 312-333.]</p>
<p>Whilst this whaleboat was absent I had occasion to send the
Colonial schooner to the southward to take on board the remaining
property saved from the wreck of the ship Sydney Cove, and to
take the crew from the island she had been cast upon.**** I sent
in the schooner Lieut. Flinders, of the Reliance (a young man
well qualifyed), in order to give him an opportunity of making
what observations he could amongst those islands; and the
discovery which was made there by him and Mr. Hamilton, the
master of the wrecked ship, shall be annexed to those of Mr. Bass
in one chart, and forwarded to your Grace herewith,* by which I
presume it will appear that the land called Van Diemans, and
generally supposed to be the southern promontory of this country,
is a group of islands separated from its southern coast by a
strait, which it is probable may not be of narrow limits, but may
perhaps be divided into two or more channels by the islands near
that on which the ship Sydney Cove was wrecked.</p>
<p class="foot">[**** See a full account of this shipwreck,
Appendix A. (Chapters 1, 2)]</p>
<p class="foot">[* Unfortunately, this chart has not been
preserved; but one, apparently by Flinders, showing part of the
tracks of Bass in the whaleboat, Flinders in the Francis, and
Flinders and Bass in the sloop Norfolk, is
reproduced.&mdash;Appendix B. (Chart, below)]</p>
<p>Having had occasion in my letter No. 31** to mention the
persons sent to the interior of the country with a few of the
discontented Irishmen, I have further to observe that after the
return of those men the three guides whom I had directed to
proceed into and to make what observations they could upon the
country they travelled over, they informed me when they arrived,
from a journal which I had given them directions to keep, and to
mark every day, that they had been to the south-west of
Parramatta more than one hundred miles, and found several hills
in which were considerable veins of salt, of ten and twelve feet,
and they described the country to be in some places highly
beautiful and fit for cultivation; in others very poor and
sterile, frequently intersected with narrow but rapid branches of
fresh-water rivers, over some of which they were obliged to swim;
others were fordable.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Ante, p. 359.]</p>
<p>I have had occasion to send a second time thro' this part of
the country in search of our herd of wild cattle, which it was
reported had been by these lawless deserters driven from their
former station or feeding-place. To insure, therefore, such
information on this head as I could depend upon, I sent a person
in whose account I could place confidence, and I understand from
him that they found the cattle a few miles from their former
spot, and distinctly counted a flock of one hundred and seventy
in number; nor was that the whole of them, as appeared by their
meeting afterwards with a few stragglers.</p>
<p>They brought specimens of the salt, which appeared to be a
good deal impregnated with the earth in which it was
discovered.</p>

<p align="right">Sydney, New South Wales, 3rd Sept., 1798.   </p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>From the unfortunate loss of a ship nam'd the Sydney Cove,*
from Bengal, upon a voyage of speculation to this port, I had
occasion to send our small Colonial schooner and a deck longboat
to the southward as far as latitude 40&deg; 36 S. to take off the
surviving crew, and to save such property as the above boats
might be capable of taking on board from the island on which the
ship had been wreck'd.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Hunter to Portland, 6th July,
1797.&mdash;Ante, p. 277 (3. Letter) and Appendix A. (Chapters 1,
2)]</p>
<p>I beg their Lordships may be inform'd that the schooner
return'd in safety with the master of the wreck'd ship and a few
lascars, but a heavy gale of wind having set in on the day of
their leaving the island, the longboat, which was commanded and
navigated by Mr. Armstrong, the master of the Supply, founder'd
with all her crew and seven or eight lascars on board, together
with such articles as had been put on board from the wreck.</p>
<p>The schooner being only forty-two tons burthen, it became
necessary to send her again to the wreck. I took that opportunity
of ordering Mr. Flinders, the 2d lieutenant of the Reliance, with
her, for the purpose of making what observations he cou'd amongst
those islands relative to anchorage, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Previous to the last trip of the schooner, Mr. Bass, the
surgeon of the Reliance, a young man of much ability in various
ways out of the line of his profession, solicited, during the
repairing of the Reliance, that he might be allow'd a boat, and
have her man'd from the King's ships. He was desirous of tracing
the coast along in the boat, and to make what observations he
might be able relative to harbours or anchorage. I fitted out a
good whaleboat for him, victual'd her, and man'd to his wish. He
went southward along the coast, and on finding, when he had got
the length of Cape Howe, that the shore inclin'd westward, he
continued to trace it along untill he came to a steep and high
promontary** in latitude 39&deg; 00 S. From this cape the land
lay along W.N.W.; he continued to steer in that direction for
about sixty miles beyond this headland, where he found an
extensive harbour, but his provisions becoming short, and being
at a very considerable distance from Port Jackson, together with
his boat becoming leaky, he resolv'd upon returning. He had at
one time stretched off from the above headland to the S.W.,
untill he was in latitude 40&deg; 00 S., but the wind shifting to
the westward and blowing strong, he was oblig'd to run for the
land again, which he with difficulty reach'd. The sea rose to so
mountainous a height that he had every reason to believe he was
not covered by any land to the westward. This circumstance
corroborates an opinion which I ventur'd to give from some
observations of my own&mdash;that there was a probability of an
open strait, thro' between the latitudes of 39&deg; 00 S. and
42&deg; 00 S.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** Wilson's Promontory. See Bass's own journal,
ante, pp. 312-333.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Hunter, in his "Historical Journal",
published in London, in January, 1793 (p. 126), expressed the
opinion that a very deep gulf or a strait separated Van Diemen's
Land from New Holland.]</p>
<p>To shew how far the conjecture I made may have been just, I
directed Mr. Hinders to take into one chart the observations of
Mr. Bass and his own; and I send a copy*** to be laid before
their Lordships. From this little sketch it will appear that the
high land in latitude 39&deg; 00 S., which Mr. Bass went round,
is the southern extremity of this country, and that the land
call'd Van Dieman's is a group of islands laying to the southward
of that extremity, and probably leaving a safe and navigable
passage between; to ascertain this is of some importance. I am
endeavouring to fit out a deck'd boat of about fifteen tons
burthen for that purpose, in which I propose to send the two
officers above mentioned.</p>
