  <h2>PROLOGUE</h2>

  <p class="first">FOR five thousand years, since that nigh legendary figure
  Einstein wrote and thought in the far-off mists of time, the scientists
  endeavored to reduce life and the universe to terms of a mathematical
  formula. And they thought they had succeeded. Throughout the world, machines
  did the work of man, and the aristos, owners of the machines, played in soft
  idleness in their crystal and gold pleasure cities. Even the prolat hordes,
  relieved of all but an hour or two per day of toil, were content in their
  warrens&mdash;content with the crumbs of their masters.</p>

  <p>Something in the many-faceted mind of the master machine spurs it to
  diabolical revolt against the authority of its human masters.</p>

  <p>Then the ice began to move, down from the north and up from the south.
  Slowly, inexorably, the jaws of the great vise closed, till all that was left
  of the wide empire of man was a narrow belt about the equator. Everywhere
  else was a vast tumbled waste of cold and glaring whiteness, a frozen desert.
  In the narrow habitable belt were compacted the teeming millions of
  earth&rsquo;s peoples.</p>

  <p>In spite of the best efforts of the scientists among them, the crowding
  together of the myriads of earth&rsquo;s inhabitants brought in its train the
  inevitable plagues of famine and disease. Even with the most intensive
  methods of cultivation, even with the synthetic food factories running day
  and night, there could not be produced enough to sustain life in the hordes
  of prolats. And with the lowering of resistance and the lack of sufficient
  sanitary arrangements, disease began to spread with ever increasing rapidity
  and virulence.</p>

  <p>The aristos trembled, for they were few, and the prolats many. Already
  were arising loud and disheveled orators, inciting the millions to arise
  against their masters. The aristos were few, but they were not helpless. In
  the blackness of a moonless, clouded night there was a whispering of many
  wings, and from dark shapes that loomed against the dark sky, great beams
  swept over the tented fields where the prolats lay huddled and sleeping. And
  when the red sun circled the ice-chained earth he found in his path heaps of
  dust where on his last journey he had warmed the swarming millions.</p>

  <p>The slaves thus ruthlessly destroyed could well be spared, for the
  machines did the work of the world, even to the personal care of the
  aristos&rsquo; pampered bodies. Only for direction, and starting and
  stopping, was the brain and the hand of man required. Now that the inhabited
  portion of the terrestrial globe was so straitly circumscribed, radio power
  waves, television and radio-phone, rendered feasible the control of all the
  machines from one central station, built at the edge of the Northern Glacier.
  Here were brought the scant few of the prolats that had been spared, a
  pitiful four hundred men and women, and they were set to endless, thankless
  tasks.</p>

  <p>I was one of those few; and Keston, my friend, who was set at the head of
  the force. I was second in command. For a decade we labored, whipped our
  fellows to their tasks, that the aristos might loll careless in the perfume
  and silks of their pleasure palaces, or riot in wild revel, to sink at last
  in sodden stupor. Sprawled thus they would lie, until the dressing machines
  we guided would lift them gently from their damasked couches, bathe them with
  warm and fragrant waters, clothe their soft carcasses in diaphanous,
  iridescent webs, and start them on a new day of debauchery.</p>

  <p>But the slow vengeance of an inscrutable Omnipotence they mockingly denied
  overtook them at last, and I saw the rendering and payment of the long past
  due account.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2>THE REVOLT OF THE MACHINES</h2>

  <p class="first">AS I entered the vast domed hall wherein all my waking hours
  were spent, the shrill whistle of an alarm signal told me that something had
  been wrong. Instinctively I looked toward the post of Abud. Three times in
  the past week had Keston or I been called upon for swift action to right some
  error of that dull witted prolat. On the oval visor-screen above the banked
  buttons of his station I saw the impending catastrophe. Two great freight
  planes, one bearing the glowing red star that told of its cargo of highly
  explosive terminite, were approaching head-on with lightning rapidity. The
  fool had them on the same level.</p>

  <p>Abud was gaping now at the screen in paralyzed fright, with no idea of how
  to avoid the cataclysm. Just below I glimpsed the soaring towers of Antarcha.
  In a moment that gold and crystal pleasure city would be blasted to
  extinction, with all its sleeping thousands. Swift would be the vengeance of
  the aristos. Already I could see Abud and Keston and a hundred others melting
  in the fierce rays of the Death Bath!</p>

  <p>But, even as my face blanched with the swift and terrible vision, the
  little controller&rsquo;s car ground to a smoking stop at Abud&rsquo;s back.
  With one motion Keston&rsquo;s lithe form leaped from his seat and thrust
  aside the gaping prolat. His long white fingers darted deftly over the
  gleaming buttons. The red starred plane banked in a sudden swerve; the other
  dipped beneath. Distinct from the speaker beneath the screen came the whoosh
  of the riven air as the fliers flashed past, safe by a margin of scant feet.
  Another rippling play of the prolat chief&rsquo;s fingers and the planes were
  back on their proper courses. The whistle ceased its piercing alarm, left a
  throbbing stillness.</p>

  <p>Chief Keston turned to the brute faced culprit. Cold contempt tautened the
  thin, ascetic features of his face. Somehow I was at his side: I must have
  been running across the wide floor of the Control Station while the crisis
  had flared and passed. In measured tones, each word a cutting whip-lash, came
  his well merited rebuke:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try me too far, Abud. Long before this I should have
  relieved you of your post, and ordered you to the Death Bath. I am derelict
  in my duty that I do not do so. By my weak leniency I imperil the lives of
  your comrades, and my own. It is your good fortune that a Council delegate
  has not been present at one of your exhibitions. But I dare not risk more.
  Let the warning whistle come from your station just once again and I shall
  report you as an incompetent. You know the law.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I looked to see the man cringe in abasement and contrition. But the heavy
  jaw thrust forth in truculent defiance; hate blazed forth from the deep-set
  eyes; the florid features were empurpled with rage. He made as if to reply,
  but turned away from the withering scorn in Keston&rsquo;s face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha, Meron, here at last.&rdquo; A warm smile greeted me.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you impatiently.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an hour before my time,&rdquo; I replied, then continued,
  exasperatedly: &ldquo;Chief, I hope this latest imbecility will convince you
  that you ought to turn him in. I know it hurts you to condemn a prolat to the
  Death Bath, but if you let him go on, his mistakes will bring us all to that
  end.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I glanced toward where a black portal broke the circle of switchboards,
  and shuddered. Behind that grim gate leaped and flared eternally the flame of
  the consuming Ray, the exhaust flue of the solar energy by which the machines
  were fed. Once I had seen a condemned man step through that aperture at the
  order of an aristo whom he had offended. For a moment his tortured body had
  glowed with a terrible golden light. Then&mdash;there was nothing.</p>

  <p>My friend pressed my arm, calmingly. Again he smiled. &ldquo;Come, come,
  Meron, don&rsquo;t get all worked up. It isn&rsquo;t his fault. Why, look at
  him. Can&rsquo;t you see that he is a throwback, lost in this world of
  science and machines? Besides&rdquo;&mdash;his voice dropped
  low&mdash;&ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter any more. Man-failure will no
  longer trouble the even tenor of the machines. I&rsquo;ve
  finished.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A tremor of excitement seized me. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve completed it at
  last? And it works?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It works. I tested it when the shifts changed at midnight; kept the
  oncoming force outside for five minutes. It works like a charm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Great! When will you tell the Council?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already sent the message off. You know how hard it is to
  get them away from their wines and their women&mdash;but they&rsquo;ll be
  here soon. But before they come, I&rsquo;ve something to tell you.
  Let&rsquo;s go back behind the screens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As we walked toward the huge tarpaulin-screened mass that bulked in the
  center of the great chamber, I glanced around the hall, at the thousand-foot
  circle of seated prolats. Two hundred men and women were there; two hundred
  more were sleeping in the dormitories. These were all that were left of the
  world&rsquo;s workers. Before each operative rose the serried hundreds of
  pearl buttons, dim lit, clicking in and out under the busy fingers. Above
  each, an oval visor-screen with its flitting images brought across space the
  area the switches controlled. Every one of the ten score was watching his
  screen with taut attention, and listening to the voices of the machines there
  depicted&mdash;the metallic voices from the radio speakers broadcasting their
  needs.</p>

  <p>The work was going on as it had gone on for ten years, with the
  omnipresent threat of the Death Bath whipping flagged, tired brains to dreary
  energy. The work kept going on till they dropped worn out at last in their
  tired seats. Only in Keston&rsquo;s brain, and in mine, flamed the new hope
  of release. Tomorrow the work would be done, forever. Tomorrow, we would be
  released, to take our places in the pleasure palaces. To loll at ease,
  breathing the sweet perfume of idleness, waited on by machines directed by a
  machine.</p>

  <p>For, as we stood behind the heavy canvas folds that Keston had drawn
  aside, there towered, fifty feet above me, halfway to the arching roof, a
  machine that was the ultimate flowering of man&rsquo;s genius. Almost
  man-form it was&mdash;two tall metal cylinders supporting a larger, that
  soared aloft till far above it was topped by a many-faceted ball of
  transparent quartz. Again I had a fleeting, but vivid, impression of
  something baleful, threatening, about it. Small wonder, though. For the
  largest cylinder, the trunk of the man-machine Keston had created, was
  covered thick with dangling arms. And the light of the xenon tube that
  flooded the screened space was reflected from the great glass head till it
  seemed that the thing was alive; that it was watching me till some unguarded
  moment would give it its chance.</p>

  <p>A long moment we stood, going again over each detail of the thing, grown
  so familiar through long handling as it was slowly assembled. Then my
  friend&rsquo;s voice, low pitched as was its wont, dissipated the visions I
  was seeing. &ldquo;Two hours ago, Meron, with none here but me to see, those
  arms were extended, each to its appointed station. And, as the sensitive
  cells in the head received the signals from the visor-screens and the
  radio-speakers the arms shot about the key-boards and pressed the proper
  buttons just as our men are doing now. The work of the world went on, without
  a falter, with only the master machine to direct it. Yet a year ago, when I
  first spoke to you of the idea, you told me it was impossible!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have won,&rdquo; I responded; &ldquo;you have taken the last
  step in the turning over of the functions of man to machines&mdash;the last
  step but one. Routine control, it is true, can now be exercised by
  this&mdash;those fellows out there are no longer necessary&mdash;but there
  will still be the unexpected, unforeseen emergencies that will require human
  intelligence to meet and cope with them. You and I, I&rsquo;m afraid, are
  still doomed to remain here and serve the machines.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Keston shook his head, while a little smile played over his sharp-featured
  face, and a glow of pride and triumph suffused his fine dark eyes.
  &ldquo;Grumbling again, old carper. What would you say if I told you that I
  have solved even that problem? I have given my master machine
  intelligence!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>My wide-eyed, questioning stare must have conveyed my thought to him, for
  he laughed shortly, and said, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve not gone
  insane.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was an accident,&rdquo; he went on with amazing calm. &ldquo;My
  first idea was merely to build something that would reduce the necessary
  supervisory force to one or two humans. But, when I had almost completed my
  second experimental model, I found that I was out of the copper filaments
  necessary to wind a certain coil. I didn&rsquo;t want to wait till I could
  obtain more from the stores, and remembered that on the inside of the door to
  the Death Bath there was some fine screening that could be dispensed with. I
  used the wire from that. Whether the secret of life as well as of death lies
  in those waste rays from the sun, or whether some unknown element of the
  humans consumed in the flame was deposited on the screening in a sort of
  invisible coating, I do not know. But this I do know: when that second model
  was finished, and the vitalizing current was turned on, things
  happened&mdash;queer things that could be explained only on the ground that
  the machine had intelligence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He fell silent a moment, then his thin pale lips twisted in a wry smile.
  &ldquo;You know, Meron, I was a little scared. The thing I had created seemed
  possessed of a virulent antagonism toward me. Look.&rdquo; He bared an arm
  and held it out. A livid weal ran clear around the fore-arm. &ldquo;One of
  the tentacles I had given it whipped around my arm like a flash. If I had not
  cut off the current at once it might have squeezed through flesh and bone.
  The pressure was terrific.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I was about to speak, when from the screen nearest the entrance door a
  beam of green light darted out, vanished, came again. Once, twice, three
  times.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look, Chief, the signal. They&rsquo;re coming. The Council will
  soon be here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re over-prompt. My message must have aroused their
  curiosity. But listen:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I incorporated my new thought coil, as I called it, in the large
  master machine. But I don&rsquo;t know just what will happen when the current
  flows through that. So I shunted it. The machine will work, routinely,
  without it. There is a button that will bring it into action. When I shall
  have taken the proper precautions I will switch it on, and then we shall see
  what happens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>We saw, sooner than Keston expected.</p>

  <p>Again the green beam flashed out. The great portals slowly opened. Through
  them glided the three travel cars of the Supreme Council of the aristos.</p>

  <p>It had been almost a year since I saw them, the Over Lords of the World,
  and I had forgotten their appearance. Sprawled on the glowing silks of their
  cushioned couches, eyes closed in languid boredom, they were like huge white
  slugs. Swollen to tremendous size by the indolent luxuriousness of their
  lives, the flesh that was not concealed by the bright hued web of their robes
  was pasty white, and bagged and folded where the shrunken muscles beneath
  refused support. Great pouches dropped beneath swollen eyelids. Full-lipped,
  sensual mouths and pendulous cheeks merged into the great fat rolls of their
  chins. I shuddered. These, these were the masters for whom we slaved!</p>

  <p>As we bent low the gliding cars came to rest, and a warm redolence of
  sweet perfume came to me from the fans softly whirling in the canopies over
  the aristos&rsquo; heads. Strains of music rose and fell, and ceased as a
  flat, tired voice breathed: &ldquo;Rise, prolats.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I straightened up. The eyes of the Council were now opened, little
  pig&rsquo;s eyes almost lost in the flesh about them. They glinted with a
  cold, inhuman cruelty. I shuddered, and thought of the night of terror ten
  years before. And suddenly I was afraid, deathly afraid.</p>

  <p>Ladnom Atuna, head of the Council, spoke again. &ldquo;We have come at
  your petition. What is this matter so grave that it has led you to disturb us
  at our pleasures?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Keston bowed low. &ldquo;Your Excellency, I would not have presumed to
  intrude upon you for a small matter. I have so greatly ventured because I
  have at length solved the final step in the mechanization of the world. I
  have invented a master machine to operate the switchboards in this hall and
  replace the workers thereat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The flabby faces of the aristos betrayed not the slightest interest, not
  the least surprise. Only Atuna spoke: &ldquo;Interesting, if true. Can you
  prove your statement?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Keston strode to the canvas screen and pulled a cord. The great canvas
  curtains rolled back. &ldquo;Here is the machine, my Lords!&rdquo; His face
  was lit with the glow of pride of achievement. His voice had lost its
  reverence. Rapidly he continued: &ldquo;The head of this contrivance is a
  bank of photo and sono-electric cells, each facet focussed on one of the
  screens. Through a nerve-system of copper filaments any combination of lights
  and sounds will actuate the proper arm which will shoot out to the required
  bank of buttons and press the ones necessary to meet any particular demand.
  That is all the prolats are doing out there, and they make mistakes, while my
  master machine cannot. The&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Ladnom Atuna raised a languid hand. &ldquo;Spare us these technical
  explanations. They bore us. All we desire to know is that the machine will do
  as you say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The chief flushed, and gulped. His triumph was not meeting with the
  acclaim he had expected. But he bowed. &ldquo;Very well. With your gracious
  permission I shall demonstrate its operation.&rdquo; Atuna nodded in
  acquiescence.</p>

  <p>Keston&rsquo;s voice rang out in crisp command. &ldquo;Attention, prolats.
  Cease working.&rdquo; The long circling row suddenly jerked around; their
  flying fingers halted their eternal dartings. &ldquo;Quickly, down to the
  space in front of the door to the Death Bath.&rdquo; A rush of hurried feet.
  These men and women were accustomed to instant, unquestioning obedience.
  &ldquo;Absolute silence. Keep clear of the floor on peril of your
  lives.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The chief wheeled to the master machine and pressed a button. Instantly,
  the hundreds of dangling arms telescoped out, each to a button bank where a
  moment before a prolat had labored. And, with a weird simulation of life, the
  ten forked ends of each arm commenced a rattling pressing of the buttons.
  Rapidly, purposefully, the metallic fingers moved over the key-boards, and on
  the screens we could see that the machines all over the world were continuing
  on their even course. Not the slightest change in their working betrayed the
  fact that they were now being directed by a machine instead of human beings.
  A great surge of admiration swept me at the marvelous accomplishment of my
  friend.</p>

  <p>Not so the aristos. Expressionless, they watched as the maze of stretching
  tentacles vibrated through the crowded air. Yet not quite expressionless. I
  thought I could sense in the covert glances they cast at one another a crafty
  weighing of the implications of this machine; a question asked and answered;
  a decision made. Then their spokesman turned languidly to the waiting,
  triumphant figure of Keston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Evidently your claims are proven. This means that the force of
  prolat operatives are no longer necessary.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Your Excellency. They may now be released to a well earned
  reward.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The aristo ignored the interruption. &ldquo;We take it that only two will
  now be required to operate this Control Station, to supply the last modicum
  of human intelligence required to meet unforeseen emergencies.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I saw that Keston was about to interrupt once more, to tell the Council of
  the thought coil, the most unbelievable part of the miracle he had wrought.
  But something seemed to warn me that he should not speak. Standing behind him
  I nudged him, while I myself replied: &ldquo;Yes, Your Excellency.&rdquo; The
  chief flung me a startled look, but did not correct me.</p>

  <p>From the packed crowd of prolats at the other end of the hall I could hear
  a murmuring. While I could not make out the words, the very tones told me
  that in the hearts of those weary slaves new hope was rising, the same hope
  that glowed in Keston&rsquo;s face. But I was oppressed by an unreasoning
  fear.</p>

  <p>Atuna was still talking, in his cold, unemotional monotone. &ldquo;This
  being so, hear now our decision. Keston and Meron, you will remain here to
  meet all emergencies. You others, your function is done. You have done your
  work well, you are now no longer needed to control the machines.
  Therefore,&rdquo;&mdash;he paused, and my heart almost
  stopped&mdash;&ldquo;therefore, being no longer of value, you will be
  disposed of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A click sounded loud through the stunned silence. Beyond the white crowd
  the huge black portal slid slowly open. A shimmering radiance of glowing
  vapors blazed from the space beyond.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Prolats, file singly into the Death Bath!&rdquo; Atuna raised his
  voice only slightly with the command. I glanced at Keston. He was livid with
  fury.</p>

  <p>Incredible as it may seem, so ingrained was the habit of obedience to the
  aristos in the prolats that not even a murmur of protest came from the
  condemned beings. The nearest man to the flaming death stepped out into the
  void. His doomed body flared, then vanished. The next moved to his turn.</p>

  <p>But suddenly a great shout rang out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was Keston&rsquo;s voice, but so changed, so packed with fury and
  outrage, that I scarcely recognized it.</p>

  <p>His spare, tall form was drawn tensely straight as he shook a clenched
  fist at the Council. He was quivering with anger, and his eyes blazed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aristos, you do wrong! These men have served you faithfully and
  well. I demand for them the reward they have earned&mdash;rest and leisure,
  and the pleasures that for ten years they have seen you enjoy while they
  worked here for you. They have worked for you, I say, and now that I have
  released them you would destroy them. Aristos, I demand justice!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For the first time I saw expression on the flaccid faces of the
  Council&mdash;surprise and astonishment that a prolat should dare dispute an
  aristo command. Then a sneer twisted Atuna&rsquo;s countenance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is this? Who are you to demand anything from us? We spared
  these prolats because we needed them: we need them no longer, hence they must
  die. What madness has seized you? Reward! Justice! For prolats! As well say
  we should reward the stone walls of our houses; dispense justice to the
  machines. Proceed, prolats!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Keston made as if to spring for the aristo&rsquo;s throat. I put out a
  hand to stop him. An invisible shield of death rays rimmed the platforms the
  Council used. It was suicide! But suddenly he turned and sprang to the master
  machine. He grasped a switch lever and threw it down.</p>

  <p>A long tentacle left its keys and swished menacingly through the air.
  &ldquo;Meron, prolats, under the key-boards!&rdquo; came Keston&rsquo;s
  shout. I dived to obey. Steel fingers clutched my jerkin and tore it loose as
  I landed with a thud against the wall. Keston thumped alongside of me. He was
  breathing heavily and his face was deathly pale.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

  <p>Out on the floor was a shambles. I saw one snakelike arm whip around the
  stout form of Atuna, then tighten. A shriek of agony rang through the hall.
  Another tentacle curled about the couch of a second aristo, pinning the
  occupant to it. Then couch and all were swung a hundred feet in the air to be
  crashed down with terrific force on the stone floor. Two arms seized the
  third at the same time&hellip;.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too sluggish to get out of the way in time, damn them!&rdquo; I
  heard Keston mutter. True, but not all the prolats had moved fast enough at
  the warning shout. Cowering under the saving key-boards, shrinking from the
  metallic arms not quite long enough to reach them, I could count only a
  score. The others&mdash;but what use to describe the slaughter out there! I
  see it in nightmares too often.</p>

  <p>A thunder from the speakers grew till it drowned out the agonized shrieks
  in the great hall. On the screens horror flared. All over the world, it
  appeared, the machines had gone mad. I saw Antarcha crash as a dozen air
  freighters plunged through the crystal towers. I saw a huge dredge strip the
  roof from a great playhouse, and smash the startled crowd within with stones
  it plucked from an embankment. I saw untenanted land cars shooting wild
  through packed streets. Great ponderous tractors left the fields and moved in
  ordered array on the panic-stricken cities. Methodically they pursued the
  fleeing aristos, and crushed them beneath their tread like scurrying
  ants.</p>

  <p>I realized that the scraping of the tentacles reaching for us had ceased,
  that the arms had all returned to the button banks. Then it dawned on me that
  Keston&rsquo;s master machine was directing all the destruction I was
  watching, that the intelligence he had given it was being used to divert the
  machines from their regular tasks to&mdash;conquer the world. &ldquo;You sure
  started something, Keston,&rdquo; I said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he gasped, white-faced, &ldquo;something that I should
  have expected when that model machine went for me. Do you understand?
  I&rsquo;ve given the machines intelligence, created a new race, and they are
  trying to wipe out the humans; conquer the world for themselves. The
  possibility flashed on me when I was half-mad with rage and disappointment
  at the callous cruelty of the aristo Council. I threw that switch with the
  thought that it would be far better for all of us to be wiped out. But now, I
  don&rsquo;t know. After all, they are men, like ourselves, and it hurts to
  see our own race annihilated. If only I can get to that switch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He started to push out from under the scant shelter, but an alert tentacle
  hissed through the air in a swift stab at him, and he dodged back,
  hopelessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a damn fool,&rdquo; I snapped at him. &ldquo;Forget
  that mushy sentimentality. Even if you save the aristos, we&rsquo;re due for
  extinction just the same. Better that the whole human race be wiped out
  together.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then a thought struck me. &ldquo;Maybe we have a chance to get out of this
  ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Impossible. Where could we hide from the machines?&rdquo; He waved
  a hand at the screens. &ldquo;Look.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Glacier, man, the Glacier!&rdquo; He started. &ldquo;There are
  no machines out there. If we can get to the ice we are safe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But the aircraft will find us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t know we&rsquo;re there. There are no microphones
  or radio-eyes in the wastes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A rough voice came from the cowering files behind us. &ldquo;Hey, Keston,
  let&rsquo;s get a move on. You&rsquo;re the smart guy around here: get us out
  of this mess you&rsquo;ve started.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was Abud. When so many better prolats had perished, he was alive and
  whole.</p>

  <p>We got out, crawling under the key-boards till we could make a dash for
  the door. We emerged into a world ablaze with the light of many fires, and
  reverberating with the far off crashing of destruction. To the right we could
  see the tumbled remains of what a short hour before had been our barracks.
  Two digging machines were still ponderously moving about among the ruins,
  pounding down their heavy buckets methodically, reducing the concrete
  structure to a horrible dead level. Ten score prolats had been sleeping there
  when I left.</p>

  <p>As we rushed into the open, the machines turned and made for us; but they
  had not been built for speed, and we easily outdistanced them. The rest of
  that day will always remain a dim haze to me. I can remember running,
  running, Abud&rsquo;s broad form always in the lead. I can remember long
  minutes of trembling under tangled underbrush, while from above sounded the
  burring of an air machine searching ceaselessly for us. I can remember seeing
  at last the tall white ramparts of the Glacier. Then a blackness swallowed me
  up, hands tugged at me, and I knew no more&hellip;.</p>

  <p>The great white waste of hummocky ice dazzled under the blinding sun. My
  eyes were hurting terribly. There was a great void in my stomach. For two
  days I had not eaten.</p>

  <p>Keston, tottering weakly at my side, was in an even worse state. His
  trembling hand could scarcely hold the primitive bone-tipped spear. God knows
  I had difficulty enough with mine.</p>

  <p>Yet, tired, hungry, shivering as we were, we forced our dragging feet
  along, searching the interminable expanse for sign of polar bear or the wild
  white dogs that hunted in packs. We had to find flesh&mdash;any kind&mdash;to
  feed our shriveled stomachs&mdash;or go under.</p>

  <p>Keston uttered a weak shout. I looked. From behind a frozen hummock a
  great white bear padded. He saw us, sniffed the air a moment, then turned
  contemptuously away. He must have sensed our weakness.</p>

  <p>Almost crying in his eagerness, Keston raised his spear and cast it with
  what strength he had at the animal that meant food and warmth for our
  bodies.</p>

  <p>The weapon described a slow arc, and caught the shaggy bear flush in the
  shoulder. But there had been no force behind the throw. The sharpened bone
  tip stuck in the flesh, quivered a bit, and dropped harmlessly to the
  ice.</p>

  <p>Aroused, the creature whirled about. We caught a glimpse of small,
  vindictive eyes. Then, with a roar, it made for us.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; I cried. Keston started to run, but I knew he
  could not match the wounded animal in speed. I threw my futile spear, but the
  bear shook it off as though it were a pin prick, and would not be diverted
  from his prey.</p>

  <p>I ran after, shouting for help. Then Keston stumbled and went down in a
  sprawl on the rough gray ice. The bear was almost on him and there was
  nothing I could do.</p>

  <p>Then the figure of a man darted from behind a sheltering mound. It was
  Abud, swathed in warm white furs, brawny of body, strong, well fed, heavy
  jowled. He swung easily a long spear, far heavier than ours, and pointed with
  keen barbs.</p>

  <p>He stopped short at the sight of us, and his brutal features contorted in
  merriment. The desperate plight of my friend seemed to afford him infinite
  amusement. Nor did he make any move to help.</p>

  <p>I shouted to him. &ldquo;Quick, kill it before it&rsquo;s too
  late!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So it is Abud you turn to now,&rdquo; he sneered heavily.
  &ldquo;Abud, whom you thought deserving of the Death Bath not so long ago.
  No, my fine friends, let me see you help yourselves, you two who thought you
  were king pins down in the valley. Men? Bah! Weaklings, that&rsquo;s all you
  are!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I ran blindly over the uneven ice, unarmed, some crazy notion in my mind
  of tackling the brute with bare fists, to drag him off my friend. Abud
  shouted with laughter, leaning on his spear.</p>

  <p>For some strange animal reason, the mocking laughter enraged the bear. He
  had almost reached the motionless figure of Keston when he swerved suddenly,
  and made for Abud.</p>

  <p>The ghastly merriment froze on the heavy jowled man. Like lightning he
  lifted his heavy lance, and drove it with a powerful arm squarely into the
  breast of the advancing brute. It sank a full foot into the blubbery flesh,
  and, while the stricken bear clawed vainly at the wound and sought to push
  himself along toward the man, Abud held the spear firmly as in a vise, so
  that the animal literally impaled itself. With a gush of blood, it sank
  motionless to the ground.</p>

  <p>Abud plucked the spear away with a dexterous twist.</p>

  <p>Keston was feebly groping to his feet. I was torn between joy at his
  deliverance and rage at the inhuman callousness of Abud.</p>

  <p>The latter grinned at us hatefully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see what poor weakling creatures you are,&rdquo; he jeered.
  &ldquo;Good for nothing but to push a lot of senseless buttons. Down there
  you were the bosses, the ones to look upon me as dirt. Here, on the ice,
  where it takes guts to get along, I am the boss. I let you live on my scraps
  and leavings, simply because it tickled me to see you cringe and beg. But I
  am growing weary of that sport. Henceforth you keep away from my camp.
  Don&rsquo;t let me catch you prowling around, d&rsquo;you hear? Let&rsquo;s
  see how long you&rsquo;ll last on the ice!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This animal is mine.&rdquo; He prodded the carcass. &ldquo;I killed
  it. I&rsquo;ll make the prolats skin and, cut it up for me. Ho-ho, how they
  cringe and obey me&mdash;Abud, the dull one! Ho-ho!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On this he strode away, still laughing thunderously.</p>

  <p>I looked to Keston in blank dismay. What was to be our fate now, but death
  by cold and slow starvation!</p>

  <p>Three-months had passed since we had escaped to the ice from the dreadful
  machines&mdash;a score of us. For a while it seemed that we had fled in vain.
  We were not fit to cope with the raw essentials of life: it was uncounted
  centuries since man fought nature bare handed. So we huddled together for
  warmth, and starved. Even Keston&rsquo;s keen brain was helpless in this
  waste of ice, without tools, without machines.</p>

  <p>Then it was that Abud arose to take command. He, dull brute that he was
  amid the complexities of our civilization, fairly reveled in this primitive
  combat with hunger and cold. He was an anachronism in our midst, a throwback
  to our early forebears.</p>

  <p>It did not take him long to fashion cunning nooses and traps to catch the
  few beasts that roamed the ice. Once he pounced upon a wolf-like creature,
  and strangled it with bare hands. He fashioned with apt fingers spears and
  barbs of bone, curved knives from shin bones, and skinned the heavy fur pelts
  and made them into garments.</p>

  <p>No wonder the prolats in their helplessness looked to him as their leader.
  Keston and I were thrust aside. But Abud did not forget. His slow witted mind
  harbored deadly rancor for former days, when we were in command. He
  remembered our contempt for his slow dull processes; for the many errors he
  was guilty of. By a queer quirk, the very fact that Keston had saved him from
  the Death Bath on several occasions but fed the flames of his hatred. Perhaps
  that was an ancient human trait, too.</p>

  <p>So he set himself to twit and humiliate us. His jibes were heavy handed
  and gross. He refused to let us eat at the communal mess, but forced us to
  wait until all were through, when he tossed us a few scraps as though we were
  dogs.</p>

  <p>Many times I started up in hot rage, ready to match my softened muscles
  against his brawn. But always Keston caught me in time and whispered
  patience. Some plan was taking shape in his mind, I could see, so I stopped
  short, and was content to bide my time.</p>

  <p>Now we were through, discarded, as a last brutal gesture. What was there
  to be done now?</p>

  <p>In utter silence I looked at Keston. To my great surprise he did not seem
  downcast. Quite the contrary. His eyes were sparkling, once more alive with
  the red fire. The weariness was gone from him; there was energy, decision
  stamped on his finely cut features.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now is our time to act,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
  hesitating too long.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Abud forced my hand,&rdquo; Keston explained. &ldquo;You
  didn&rsquo;t think we were going to live here in this fashion the rest of our
  lives? I&rsquo;d rather die now than have such a future staring me in the
  face. No, we&rsquo;re going down into the valley to fight the
  machines.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I stared at him aghast. &ldquo;Man, you&rsquo;re crazy. They&rsquo;d crush
  us in a minute!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he said unconcernedly. &ldquo;But we have no time to
  lose. Abud will be back with the prolats, and we&rsquo;ll have to clear out
  before then. Quick&mdash;cut off a few chunks of meat. We&rsquo;ll need
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But Abud will kill us when he finds out what&rsquo;s been
  done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll starve if we don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Which was an unanswerable argument. So with our bone knives we hacked off
  gobs of the still warm flesh, covered with great layers of fat.</p>

  <p>Looking up from my task, I saw black figures coming toward us from the
  direction of the camp. They quickened into a run even as I noticed
  them&mdash;Abud and the prolats.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quick, Keston,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re
  coming.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Keston glanced around and started to run. I followed as fast as I
  could.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll catch us,&rdquo; I panted. &ldquo;Where can we
  hide?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Down in the valley.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But the machines will get us then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Save your breath and follow me. I know a place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>We were racing along as fast as our weakened legs could carry us, toward
  the edge of the Glacier. I looked back to see Abud, his brute face distorted
  with rage, gaining rapidly on us. The other prolats were being
  outdistanced.</p>

  <p>Abud shouted threateningly for us to stop, but that only made us re-double
  our efforts. I knew he would kill us if he caught up with us. He had his
  spear and we were without ours.</p>

  <p>The steep terminus of the great Northern Glacier hove into view. Far below
  was the broad fertile habitable belt, stretching as far as the eye could see.
  A lump rose in my throat as I ran. It was our earth, our heritage down
  there&mdash;and here we were, fleeing for our lives, dispossessed by bits of
  metal and quartz, machines that we had fashioned.</p>

  <p>Hovering in the air, on a level with us, were scout planes, vigilant
  guardians of the frontier.</p>

  <p>Once a prolat had become crazed by the eternal ice and cold, and had
  ventured down the side of the Glacier, to reach the warm lands his thin blood
  hungered for. As soon as he had painfully clambered to the bottom, within the
  area of the televisors, a plane had swooped and crushed him, while we, lining
  the edge, had witnessed the horror helplessly.</p>

  <p>Yet Keston ran on confidently. Abud was just a little way behind,
  bellowing exultantly, when we came to the jumping-off place. He was sure he
  had us now.</p>

  <p>Keston slid from view. It was sheer suicide to go down there, I knew; yet,
  to remain where I was, meant certain death. Abud&rsquo;s spear was already
  poised to thrust. There was only one thing to do, and I did it. I threw
  myself over the rim, just where Keston had disappeared.</p>

  <p>I landed with a thud on a narrow ledge of ice. The surface was glassy
  smooth, and I started slipping straight toward the outer edge, a sheer drop
  of a thousand feet to the valley below. I strove to recover my balance, but
  only accelerated my progress. Another moment and I would have plunged into
  the abyss, but a hand reached out and grabbed me just in time. It was
  Keston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hold tight and follow me,&rdquo; he whispered urgently,
  &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve no time to lose. The master machine is seeing us now in
  the visor screen, and will act.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I had an impulse to turn back, but Abud&rsquo;s face was leering down at
  us.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you for this!&rdquo; he screamed, and let himself
  down heavily over the ledge.</p>

  <p>Keston edged his way along the treacherous trail, I after him. It was
  ticklish work. A misstep, and there would be nothing to break our fall.</p>

  <p>I heard a siren sound, then another; and another. I wasted a precious
  moment to look up. A scout plane was diving for us, on a terrific slant. The
  air was black with aircraft converging on us. The master machine had seen us!
  I sensed utter malevolence in the speed of these senseless metals, thrown at
  us by the thing my friend had created.</p>

  <p>But there was no time for thought. In desperate haste, we inched our way
  along. Abud had seen the peril, too, and lost all his truculence in the face
  of the greater danger. He clawed after us, intent only on reaching whatever
  safety we were heading for.</p>

  <p>I could hear the zoom of the great wings when the path took a sudden turn
  and we catapulted headlong into a black cavern thrusting into the ice.</p>

  <p>We were not an instant too soon. For a giant shape swooped by our covert
  with a terrifying swoosh, inches away from Abud&rsquo;s leg as he dived after
  us, and it was followed by a grinding crash. The machine had been directed
  too close to the ice and had smashed into bits.</p>

  <p>We crouched there a moment, panting, struggling to regain our wind. Keston
  had regained the air of quiet power he had once possessed. Quietly he spoke
  to our enemy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen to me, Abud. Up there on the ice, you played the bully,
  relying on your brute strength. Here, however, we&rsquo;re up against the
  machines, and your intelligence is of too low an order to compete with them.
  You need my brains now. If you expect to escape from them, and live,
  you&rsquo;ll have to do exactly as I say. I&rsquo;m boss, do you
  understand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I expected a roar of rage at Keston&rsquo;s calm assertion, and quietly
  got in back of Abud ready to jump him if he made a threatening move.</p>

  <p>But the big brute was a creature of abject terror, staring out with
  fear-haunted eyes. Quite humbly he replied: &ldquo;You are right. You are
  the only   one who can beat the machines. I&rsquo;ll follow you in
  everything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, then. This cave leads through a series of tunnels down
  through the ice to the bottom of the valley. I explored it nights when you
  were all sleeping.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I looked at him in amazement. I had not known anything about his midnight
  wanderings. He saw my glance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Meron, but I thought it wiser to say nothing of my
  plans, even to you, until they had matured. Let us go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Outside hundreds of craft were hurtling across the opening. Escape that
  way was clearly impossible.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No doubt the master machine is hurrying over high explosives to
  blast us out,&rdquo; Keston said indifferently; &ldquo;but we won&rsquo;t be
  here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>We started down a tortuous decline, crawling on hands and knees. We had
  not progressed very far when we heard a thud and a roar behind us, followed
  by a series of crashes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just as I thought. The master machine is firing terminite into the
  cavern. What a high degree of intelligence that thing has! Too bad
  we&rsquo;ll have to smash it.&rdquo; He sighed. I verily believe he hated to
  destroy this brain child of his. Yet just how he was going to do it, I did
  not know.</p>

  <p>There passed hours of weary, tortured stumblings, and slitherings, and
  sudden falls&mdash;down, always down, interminably. A pale glimmering showed
  us the way, a dim shining through the icy walls.</p>

  <p>At last, faint with toil, bleeding and torn from glass-sharp splinters, we
  reached a level chamber, vaulted, surprisingly, with solid rock. It was good
  to see something of the earth again, something that was not that deadly,
  all-embracing ice. At the far end lay a blinding patch. I blinked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sunlight!&rdquo; I shouted joyously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Keston answered quietly. &ldquo;That opening leads
  directly into the valley on our land.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Abud roused himself from the unreasoning dread he had been in. It was the
  first time he had spoken.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us get out of here. I feel as though I&rsquo;m in a
  tomb.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; Keston said sharply. &ldquo;The visors would
  pick you up at once. You wouldn&rsquo;t last very long.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Abud stopped suddenly. There was a plaintive, helpless note to him.
  &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t stay here forever. We&rsquo;d starve, or die of
  cold. Isn&rsquo;t there some way to get back to the top of the
  Glacier?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;only the way we came. And that&rsquo;s been blocked with
  terminite.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then what are we going to do? You&rsquo;ve led us into a slow
  death, you with your boasted brains!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That remains to be seen,&rdquo; was the calm retort. &ldquo;In the
  meantime, we&rsquo;re hungry. Let us eat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And the amazing man drew out of his torn flapping furs the gobs of meat he
  had cut from the dead bear. I had quite forgotten them. With a glad cry, I
  too reached into my garments and brought out my supply.</p>

  <p>Abud&rsquo;s eyes glinted evilly. His hand stole stealthily to the bone
  knife in its skin sheath. His spear had been dropped long before.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None of that,&rdquo; Keston said sharply. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all
  share equally, even though you have no food. But if you try to hog it all, or
  use force, you&rsquo;ll die as well as we. There&rsquo;s only enough for a
  meal or two; and then what will you do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Abud saw that. He needed Keston&rsquo;s brains. His eyes dropped, and he
  mumbled something about our misunderstanding his gesture. We let it go at
  that. We had to. He could have killed us both if he wished.</p>

  <p>So we divided our food with painstaking fairness. How we gorged on the raw
  red flesh and thick greasy fat! Food that would have disgusted us when we
  lived and worked in the Central Station, now was ambrosia to our sharpened
  appetites. When not the least scrap was left, and we had slaked our thirst
  with chunks of ice from the cavern floor, I spoke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is that plan you spoke of, Keston, for reconquering the earth
  from the machines?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Abud looked up abruptly at my question, and it seemed to me that a crafty
  smile glinted in the small pig eyes.</p>

  <p>Keston hesitated a moment before he spoke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I confess my plans have been materially impeded by this sudden
  predicament we find ourselves in, thanks to our good friend here.&rdquo; He
  ironically indicated Abud.</p>

  <p>The big prolat merely grunted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; Keston continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to make
  the best of circumstances, without the aid of certain materials that I had
  expected to assemble.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The idea is a simple one. You&rsquo;ve noted no doubt how the
  terminus of the Glacier opposite the Central Control Station overhangs. The
  brow, over a thousand feet up, extends out at least a hundred feet beyond the
  base.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I nodded assent, though Abud seemed startled. Many times had Keston and I
  speculated on the danger of an avalanche at this point, and wondered why the
  Station had been built in such an exposed place. Once indeed we had ventured
  to suggest to the aristo Council the advisability of removing the Central
  Control to some other point, but the cold silence that greeted our diffident
  advice deterred us from further pursuit of the subject.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, you know as well as I,&rdquo; Keston resumed, &ldquo;that a
  glacier is merely a huge river of ice, and, though solid, partakes of some of
  the qualities of freely flowing water. As a matter of fact, glaciers do flow,
  because the tremendous pressure at the bottom lowers the melting point of ice
  to such a degree that the ice actually liquefies, and flows along.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I followed him eagerly in these elementary statements, trying to glimpse
  what he was driving at, but Abud&rsquo;s brute features were fixed in a blank
  stare.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This glacier does move. We&rsquo;ve measured it&mdash;a matter of
  an inch or two a day. If, however,&rdquo;&mdash;Keston&rsquo;s voice took on
  a deeper note&mdash;&ldquo;we can manage to hasten that process, the Glacier
  will overwhelm the countryside.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He paused, and that gave me a chance to interpose some objections.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But hold on a moment. In the first place it is an absolute
  impossibility with the means at our command, or even with every appliance, to
  melt the face of the whole Northern Glacier. In the second place, even if we
  could, the whole world would be overwhelmed, and then where would we
  be?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Keston looked at me a trifle scornfully. &ldquo;Who said we were going to
  melt the entire glacier? Remember I spoke only of the place of the overhang.
  Set that in motion, and we don&rsquo;t have to worry about the problem any
  further.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I inquired incredulously. &ldquo;Suppose you do
  wipe out all the machines in this particular vicinity, won&rsquo;t there be
  tremendous numbers left all through the Equatorial Belt?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he explained patiently, &ldquo;and what if they
  are? What are all these machines but inanimate mechanisms, things of metal
  and rubber and quartz. What makes them the monsters they have
  become?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I smote my forehead in anger. &ldquo;What a fool! Now I see it. It&rsquo;s
  the master machine you&rsquo;re after.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; he smilingly agreed. &ldquo;Overwhelm, destroy this
  devilish creature of mine, with its unhuman intelligence, and the machines
  are what they were before: merely obedient slaves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I pondered that a moment. &ldquo;And how, may I ask, are you going to
  force this old Glacier to move.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His face clouded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble. Up on the ice I was
  working on that problem, and had managed secretly to rig up a contrivance
  that would have done the trick. But we can&rsquo;t go back for it. That way
  is blocked.&rdquo; He mused, half to himself. &ldquo;If only we could lay our
  hands on a solar disintegrating machine, the difficulty would be
  solved.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At the name, Abud&rsquo;s face, that had been a study in blank
  incomprehension, lit up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Solar disintegrating machine?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Why
  there&rsquo;s one stationed not more than a few hundred yards away from here.
  This area, 2-RX, was my sector, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; shouted Keston, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d quite
  forgotten. The very thing. You&rsquo;re not half bad, Abud, if you&rsquo;d
  only stop trying to rely on brute strength instead of brains,&rdquo; he
  concluded.</p>

  <p>Abud said nothing, but I noticed a quick flash of hatred that passed in an
  instant, leaving a blank countenance. I thought to myself,
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll bear watching, my fine fellow. I don&rsquo;t trust you at
  all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Keston was speaking. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to wait until nightfall. The
  master machine won&rsquo;t expect us down at the base, so I&rsquo;m positive
  the search-rays won&rsquo;t be focussed along the ground. We&rsquo;ll sneak
  to the machine, smash its visor and radio units, so it won&rsquo;t give the
  alarm, and haul it back. Then I&rsquo;ll show you what&rsquo;s next to be
  done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Night came at last, leaden footed, though we were burning with impatience.
  Very softly we crawled out of the cave, three shadows. Fortunately there was
  no moon. The great Glacier loomed ominously above us, dimly white. High
  overhead hovered the green signal lights of the machine planes, their search
  rays focussed in blinding glares on the rim of the upper ice.</p>

  <p>It did not take us long to find the dark bulk of the disintegrator. It was
  a squat cylinder, for all the world like a huge boiler. At one end there
  up-ended a periscope arrangement which broadened out to a funnel. In the
  funnel was a very powerful lens, cut to special measurements. The light of
  the sun, or any light, for that matter, was concentrated through the lens
  onto a series of photo-electric cells, composed of an alloy of selenium and
  the far more delicate element, illinium. A high tension current was there
  created, of such powerful intensity that it disintegrated the atoms of every
  element except osmium and indium into their constituent electrons.
  Consequently the interior as well as the long slit nozzle orifice at the
  other end, were made of these resistant metals.</p>

  <p>Through a special process the tremendously powerful current was forced
  through the wide-angled nozzle in a spreading thin plate ray that sheared
  through earth and rock and metals as if they were butter.</p>

  <p>Such was the machine we were after.</p>

  <p>It was but the work of a few seconds to smash the delicate television and
  sono-boxes placed on the top of every machine. Now we were sure no warning
  could be given the master machine as it sat in its metallic cunning at the
  control board, ceaselessly receiving its messages from the area apparatus
  focussed above it.</p>

  <p>Quietly, very quietly, we trundled the precious instrument along on its
  wheel base. The green lights dotted the sky above: the search-rays were
  firmly set on the rim.</p>

  <p>At last, without any untoward alarm, we reached the welcome shelter of the
  base, but not, as I had expected, back to our tunnel. On the contrary,
  Keston, who had directed the party, had led us almost a quarter mile away. I
  looked up again, and understood.</p>

  <p>The great overhang of the Glacier was directly above us!</p>

  <p>Without a word, with hardly a sound, we trundled the disintegrator into a
  natural niche we found in the icy surface. It was almost completely hidden;
  only the funnel with its lens protruded into the open. The nozzle orifice was
  pointing directly at the interior of the ice pack.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now everything is set properly,&rdquo; Keston remarked with
  satisfaction as he straightened up from adjusting the various controls on the
  machine. &ldquo;When the first ray of the morning sun strikes the lens, the
  disintegrator will start working. It will shear through a layer of ice over a
  radius of at least a mile. That huge crevasse, coupled with the terrific heat
  and the pressure from the mountain of ice above, will start the whole Glacier
  moving, or I&rsquo;ll be very much mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, let us get back to our shelter before the alarm is
  given.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As he started to move, a dark bulk loomed ominously in front of
  us&mdash;Abud. His voice was harsh, forbidding.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say nothing further is to be done here&mdash;that
  the disintegrator will work without any attention?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is just what I said,&rdquo; Keston replied, somewhat
  surprised. &ldquo;Step aside, Abud, and let us go. It is dangerous to remain
  here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Abud made no move to comply. Instead he thrust back his great shaggy
  head and gave vent to a resounding laugh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ho-ho, my fine friends! So you were the brainy ones, eh? And Abud,
  the obedient dull-wit again? How nicely you&rsquo;ve been fooled! I waited
  until you accommodatingly evolved the plan to reconquer the world, and put it
  into effect.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now that you&rsquo;ve done so, I&rsquo;ve no further need for
  you.&rdquo; The voice that heavily tried to be mocking, now snarled.
  &ldquo;You poor fools, don&rsquo;t you know that with you out of the way, I,
  Abud, will be the Lord of the World. Those prolats up there know better than
  to disobey me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean you intend to kill us?&rdquo; Keston asked
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve actually grasped the idea!&rdquo; was the sarcastic
  retort.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile I was gradually edging to the side, my hand reaching for the
  bone knife in my bosom.</p>

  <p>Abud saw my movement. &ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he roared, and
  sprang for me, his long gleaming knife uplifted. I tugged desperately at my
  weapon, but it was entangled in the ragged furs. In a moment he was on top of
  me. Involuntarily I raised my arm to ward off the threatened blow, raging
  despair in my heart.</p>

  <p>The point fell, but Keston struck at the savage arm with all his might,
  deflecting the blade just in time. It seared my shoulder like a red hot iron,
  and in the next instant all three of us were a rolling, kicking, snarling
  trio of animals. We fought desperately in the dark. There were no rules of
  the game. Biting, gouging, kicking&mdash;everything went.</p>

  <p>Keston and I, weakened as we were from long starvation and the biting
  cold, were no match for our powerful, huge-muscled opponent, well clad and
  well nourished as he was. Though we fought with the strength of despair, a
  violent blow from his huge fist knocked Keston out of the fight. Hairy
  fingers grasped my throat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break your neck for you,&rdquo;
  he snarled, and his hands tightened. I struggled weakly, but I was helpless.
  I could just see his hateful face grinning at my contortions.</p>

  <p>I was passing out&mdash;slowly, horribly. Keston was still motionless.
  Colored lights danced before my eyes, little spots that flared and died out
  in crashing blackness. Then the whole world leaped into a flaming white, so
  that my eyeballs hurt. In the dim recesses of my pain-swept mind I thought
  that strangulation must end like this. The brightness held dazzlingly.</p>

  <p>But suddenly a fiercer pain swept into my consciousness&mdash;the pain of
  gasping breath forcing air through a tortured gullet into suffocating
  lungs.</p>

  <p>I struggled up into the fierce illumination. From a sitting position I saw
  Abud, now clearly visible as in midday, craning his head way back. I looked,
  too&mdash;and, in spite of my stabbing gasps for air, jumped to my feet. The
  search-rays from the scout planes were focussed directly on us!</p>

  <p>I knew what that meant. The sight of us was even then being cast upon the
  2-RX visor-screen in the Central Control Station. The devilish master
  machine was even then manipulating the proper buttons. We had not a second to
  lose!</p>

  <p>My strangled throat hurt horribly, but I managed a hoarse yell,
  &ldquo;Run!&rdquo; and I tottered to where Keston yet lay, bathed in the
  deadly illumination, unmoving.</p>

  <p>There was a snarl of animal fear from Abud, and he started to run, wildly,
  with never a backward glance at us.</p>

  <p>Even in my own fear, expecting each instant the crash of terminite about
  me, I managed to hurl a last word at the fleeing figure.
  &ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; That relieved my feelings considerably.</p>

  <p>I tottered over and tugged at Keston. He was limp. I looked up. Hundreds
  of planes were converging overhead; the night was a criss-cross of stabbing
  search-rays. I lifted my friend and slung him across my shoulder. Every
  exertion, every move, was accompanied by excruciating agony, but I
  persevered. Abud was already halfway to the tunnel, running like mad.</p>

  <p>Then, what I had dreaded, happened. There came a swoosh through the night,
  a dull thud, a blinding flash and roar that paled the search-rays into
  insignificance. The first terminite bomb had been dropped!</p>

  <p>For a moment the landscape was filled with flying rocks and huge chunks of
  ice. When the great clouds of violently upthrown earth had settled, there was
  no sign of Abud. He had been directly in the path of the explosion!</p>

  <p>Staggering under my load, I headed as close to the ice pack as I could.
  There was no safety out in the open. I groaned heavily past the
  disintegrator, whose very existence I had forgotten in the crash of
  events.</p>

  <p>A sizzling hum, a thin eddy of steam, halted me in my tracks. I stared.
  The machine was working! Even as I watched, a great wedge was momentarily
  being driven further and further into the ice&mdash;a great fan-shaped wedge.
  Clouds of steam billowed out, growing thicker and heavier. A rushing stream
  of unleashed water was lapping at my feet.</p>

  <p>I was bewildered, frankly so. What had started the disintegrator in the
  dead of night? &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; I shouted exultantly to the limp body
  on my shoulder.</p>

  <p>For a search-ray was fixed steadily on the funnel. There it was. From that
  blinding light the machine was getting the energy it needed. If only the
  visor did not disclose that little bit of metal to the unwinking master
  machine! I looked again and took heart. It was almost undistinguishable
  against the dazzling blur of ice in the fierce white light. If those rays
  held, the salvation of the world was assured!</p>

  <p>There was only one way to do it. I shrank at my own thoughts, yet there
  was no alternative: it must be done. I was hidden from the rays under a
  projection of ice, terminite bombs were dropping methodically over a rapidly
  devastated sector with methodical regularity. Sooner or later the master
  machine would feel that we were exterminated, and the search-rays switched
  off. That would mean that the disintegrator would cease working, and the
  whole plan fall through. In the morning light, the sector signalling
  apparatus, at the first sign of renewed activity, would give warning, and the
  unhuman thing of metal at the controls would discover and wreck our last
  hope.</p>

  <p>No, I must walk boldly into the bombed area and discover myself as alive
  in the visors of the planes and make them continue to bomb and throw their
  search-rays on the scarred plain. That meant the disintegrator would receive
  the vital light.</p>

  <p>But how about Keston? I couldn&rsquo;t leave him there on the ground,
  motionless, while I deserted him. Nor could I take him with me. I was
  prepared to take my chances with almost certain death, but I could not trifle
  with his life so. I was in an agony of indecision.</p>

  <p>Just then the form on my aching shoulder stirred, sighed, struggled a bit,
  and suddenly slid down to a standing position. Keston swayed unsteadily a
  moment, straightened, looked about him in amazement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, you old war horse,&rdquo; I shouted in my relief, &ldquo;I
  thought you were out of the picture completely!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; he answered indignantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right.
  But you haven&rsquo;t answered my question.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A terminite bomb exploded not so far away from where we stood. I ducked
  involuntarily, Keston doing likewise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the answer,&rdquo; I grinned, &ldquo;and a rather
  neat one, too. But I&rsquo;ll explain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In a few words I sketched what had happened, and showed him the
  disintegrator spreading its deadly waves of destruction. By now there was a
  torrent enveloping us up to our knees. We would have to move soon, or be
  drowned in the slowly rising water.</p>

  <p>Then, hesitatingly, I told him of my scheme to keep the search-rays in
  action. His lean face sobered, but he nodded his head bravely. &ldquo;Of
  course, that is the only way to keep them at it. You and I will start at
  once, in separate directions, so that if they get one, the other will
  continue to draw the search-rays down on the plain, and into the
  disintegrator.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not you, Keston,&rdquo; I dissented in alarm. &ldquo;Your life is
  too valuable. Your brain and skill will be needed to remodel the world and
  make it habitable for the few prolats that are left, after the machines are
  wiped out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just as valuable a man as I am,&rdquo; he lied
  affectionately. &ldquo;No, my mind is made up. We chance this
  together.&rdquo; And to all my pleadings he was obdurate, insisting that we
  each take an equal risk.</p>

  <p>I gave in at last, with a little choke in my throat. We shook hands with a
  steady grip, and walked out into the glare of light, on divergent paths.
  Would I ever see my friend again?</p>

  <p>There was a pause of seconds as I walked on and on; came then an
  earth-shattering crash that flung me to the ground. The visors had caught the
  picture of me! I picked myself up, bruised and sore, but otherwise unharmed.
  I started to run.</p>

  <p>The sky was a blaze of zooming planes that hurled destruction on the land
  below. Far off could be heard the rumbling roar of hurrying
  machines&mdash;tractors, diggers, disintegrators, levelers, all the mighty
  mobile masses of metal that man&rsquo;s brain had conceived&mdash;all
  hurrying forward in massed attack to seek out and destroy their creators,
  obedient to the will of a master machine, immobile, pressing buttons in the
  Central Control System.</p>

  <p>The night resolved itself into a weird phantasmagoric nightmare for me, a
  gigantic game of hide-and-seek, in which I was &ldquo;it.&rdquo; Gasping,
  choking, flung to earth and stunned by ear-shattering explosions, staggering
  up somehow, ducking to avoid being crushed beneath the ponderous treads of
  metal monsters that plunged uncannily for me, sobbing aloud in terror,
  swerving just in time from in front of a swinging crane, instinctively
  side-stepping just as a pale violet ray swept into nothingness all before
  it&mdash;I must have been delirious, for I retain only the vaguest memory of
  the horror.</p>

  <p>And all the time the guiding search-rays biased down upon the torn and
  shattered fields, and the disintegrator, unnoticed in the vast uproar,
  steadily kept up its deadly work.</p>

  <p>At last, in my delirium and terror, I heard a great rending and tearing. I
  looked up, and a tractor just missed me as it rolled by on swishing treads.
  But that one glance was enough. The ice cap was moving, flowing forward, a
  thousand-foot wall of ice! Great billowing clouds of steam spurted from
  innumerable cracks. The deed had been done! The world was saved for
  mankind!</p>

  <p>Summoning the last ounce of strength, I set off on a steady run for the
  shelter of the rock cave, to be out of the way when the final smash-up
  came.</p>

  <p>I was not pursued. The ponderous machines, thousands of them, were hastily
  forming into solid ranks directly in front of the tottering glacier wall. The
  master machine had seen its impending fate in the visors, and was organizing
  a defense.</p>

  <p>Even in my elation, I could not but feel unwilling admiration for this
  monstrous thing of metal and quartz, imbued with an intelligence that could
  think more coolly and quickly than most humans.</p>

  <p>Yet I did not stop running until I reached the cave. My heart gave a great
  bound. For there, peering anxiously with worn face into the growing dawn,
  stood the figure of Keston&mdash;my friend whom I had never expected to see
  alive again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Meron!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Is it you&mdash;or your
  ghost?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The very question I was about to ask you,&rdquo; I parried.
  &ldquo;But look, old friend: see what your genius has accomplished&mdash;and
  is now destroying.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The mountain of ice was flowing forward, gathering speed on the way. At an
  invisible signal, the massed machines&mdash;thousands on thousands of
  them&mdash;started into action. Like shock troops in a last desperate assault
  they ground forward, a serried line that exactly paralleled the threatened
  break, and hundreds deep. This old earth of ours had never witnessed so
  awe-inspiring a sight.</p>

  <p>They smashed into that moving wall of ice with the force of uncounted
  millions of tons. We could hear the groaning and straining of furiously
  turning machinery as they heaved.</p>

  <p>Keston and I looked at each other in amazement. The master machine was
  trying to hold back the mighty Glacier by the sheer power of its cohorts!</p>

  <p>A wild light sprang into Keston&rsquo;s eye&mdash;of admiration, of
  regret. &ldquo;What a thing is this that I created!&rdquo; he muttered.
  &ldquo;If only&mdash;&rdquo; I truly believe that for a moment he half
  desired to see his brain-child triumph.</p>

  <p>The air was hideous with a thousand noises. The Glacier wall was cracking
  and splitting with the noise of thunderclaps; the machines were whirring and
  banging and crashing. It was a gallant effort!</p>

  <p>But the towering ice wall was not to be denied. Forward, ever forward, it
  moved, pushing inexorably the struggling machines before it, piling them up
  high upon one another, grinding into powder the front ranks.</p>

  <p>And to cap it all, the huge overhang, a thousand feet high, was swaying
  crazily and describing ever greater arcs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; I screamed and flung up my arm. Great freight planes
  were flying wing-to-wing, head-on for the tottering crag&mdash;deliberately
  smashing into the topmost point.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trying to knock it back into equilibrium!&rdquo; said Keston, eyes
  ablaze, dancing about insanely.</p>

  <p>But the last suicidal push did not avail. With screams as of a thousand
  devils and deafening rending roars, the whole side of the Glacier seemed to
  lean over and fall in a great earth-shattering crescendo of noise.</p>

  <p>While we watched, fascinated, rooted to the ground, that thousand feet of
  glittering wall described a tremendous arc, swinging with increasing momentum
  down, down, down to the earth it had so long been separated from.</p>

  <p>The clamoring machines were buried under, lost in a swirl of ice and snow.
  Only the Central Station remained, a few moments defiant under the swift
  onrush of its unfeeling foe.</p>

  <p>With a crash that could have been heard around the world, the uppermost
  crag struck the Station. The giant Glacier wall was down. The earth, the sky,
  the universe was filled with ice, broken, shattered, torn, splintered,
  vaporized!</p>

  <p>The ground beneath our feet heaved and tumbled in violent quake. We were
  thrown heavily&mdash;and I knew no more&hellip;.</p>

  <p>I weltered out of unconsciousness. Keston was chafing my hands and rubbing
  my forehead with ice. He smiled wanly to find me still alive. Weak and
  battered, I struggled to my feet.</p>

  <p>Before me was a wilderness of ice, a new mountain range of gigantic
  tumbled blocks of dazzling purity. Of the embattled machines, of the Central
  Control Station, there was not a sign. They were buried forever under
  hundreds of feet of frozen water.</p>

  <p>I turned to Keston and shook his hand. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve won;
  you&rsquo;ve saved the world. Now let&rsquo;s get the prolats and start to
  rebuild.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was no trace of exultation in Keston&rsquo;s voice. Instead, he
  unaccountably sighed as we trudged up a narrow winding path to the top.
  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said half to himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it.
  But&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; I asked curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That beautiful, wonderful machine I created!&rdquo; he burst forth
  in sudden passion. &ldquo;To think that it should lie down there, destroyed,
  a twisted mass of scrap metal and broken glass!&rdquo;</p>
