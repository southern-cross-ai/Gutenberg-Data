    The Child, And What She Led Me Into</b></h2>
  <p>I  was walking at a rapid pace up the avenue one raw, fall evening, when somewhere  near the corner of Fifty&mdash;Street I was brought to a sudden stand-still by the  sound of a child&rsquo;s voice accosting me from the stoop of one of the handsome  houses I was then passing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  sir!&rdquo; it cried, &ldquo;please come in. Please come to grandpa. He&rsquo;s sick and wants  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Surprised,  for I knew no one on the block, I glanced up and saw bending from the open  doorway the trembling figure of a little girl, with a wealth of curly hair  blowing about her sweet, excited face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have made a mistake,&rdquo; I called up to her. &ldquo;I am not the person you suppose. I  am a stranger. Tell me whom you know about here and I will see that someone  comes to your grandpa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  this did not satisfy her. Running down the stoop, she seized me by the arm with  childish impetuosity, crying: &ldquo;No, no. There isn&rsquo;t time. Grandpa told me to  bring in the first man I saw going by. You are the first man. Come!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was urgency in her tones, and unconsciously I began to yield to her insistence,  and allow myself to be drawn towards the stoop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is your grandpa?&rdquo; I asked, satisfied from the imposing look of the house that  he must be a man of some prominence. &ldquo;If he is sick there are the servants&rdquo;&mdash;But  here her little foot came down in infantile impatience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grandpa  never waits!&rdquo; she cried, dragging me with her small hands up the stoop and into  the open door. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t hurry he&rsquo;ll think I didn&rsquo;t do as he told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  man would not have yielded? The hall, as seen from the entrance, was wide and  unusually rich. Indeed, an air of the highest respectability, as well as of  unbounded wealth, characterised the whole establishment; and however odd the  adventure appeared, it certainly offered nothing calculated to awaken distrust.  Entering with her, I shut the door behind me. In an instant she was half-way  down the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here!  here!&rdquo; she cried, pausing before a door near its end.</p>
  <p>The  confidence with which she summoned me (I sometimes wonder if my countenance  conveys more than the ordinary amount of good nature) and the pretty picture  she made, standing in the flood of light which poured from the unseen apartment  toward which she beckoned me, lured me on till I reached her side, and stood in  full view of a scene which certainly justified her fear if not the demand she  made upon a passing stranger.</p>
  <p>In  the midst of a small room, plain as any office, I saw an elderly gentleman  standing who, even to my unaccustomed eyes, seemed to be not simply ill, but in  the throes of actual dissolution.</p>
  <p>Greatly  disturbed, for I had anticipated nothing so serious, I turned to fly for  assistance, when the little child, rushing by me, caught her grandfather by the  knees and gave me such a look, I had not the heart to leave her.</p>
  <p>Indeed  it would have been cruel to do so. The appearance and attitude of the sick man  were startling even to me. Though in a state bordering on death, he was, as I  have said, standing, not lying, and his tall figure swaying against the large  table to which he clung, formed a picture of mental and physical suffering such  as I had never before seen, and can never in all my life to come, forget. One  hand was pressed against his heart, but the other, outspread in a desperate attempt  to support his weight, had fallen on some half-dozen sheets or so of  typewritten paper, which, slipping under the pressure put upon them, kept him  tottering, though he did not fall. He was looking my way, and as I advanced  into the room, his collapsing frame shook with sudden feeling, and the hand  which he held clenched over his heart opened slightly, revealing a scrap of  paper crushed between his fingers.</p>
  <p>Struck  with compassion, for the contrast was pitiful between his naturally imposing  appearance and his present helplessness, I murmured some words of sympathy and  encouragement, and then supposing him to be alone in the house with his  grandchild, inquired what I could do to serve him.</p>
  <p>He  cast a meaning glance down at his hand, then seeing that I did not understand  him, made a super-human effort and held that member out, uttering some  inarticulate words which I was able to construe into a prayer to take from him  the paper which his stiffening clutch made it difficult for him to release.</p>
  <p>Touched  by his extremity, and anxious to afford him all the solace his desperate case  demanded, I drew the paper from between his fingers. As I did so I noted,  first, that it was a portion of one of the sheets I saw scattered about on  every side, and, secondly, that it was folded together as if intended for  someone&rsquo;s private perusal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  shall I do with this?&rdquo; I asked, consulting his eye over which a glaze was fast  forming.</p>
  <p>He  let his own glance wander eagerly till it fell upon some envelopes, then it  became fixed, and I understood.</p>
  <p>Drawing  out one, I placed the slip in it, and fastening the envelope, consulted his  face with a smile.</p>
  <p>He  answered with a look so full of thanks, appreciation, and confidence that I  felt abashed. Something of more than ordinary significance was conveyed by that  look, and I was about to ask what name I should write on the envelope, when the  faint sounds with which he had been trying to express his secret wishes became  articulate, and I heard these words:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700491h-images/page005.png" width="506" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  no one&mdash;no one else! To&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Alas!  at this critical moment and just as the name was faltering on his lips, his  utterance failed. He strove for expression, but no words would come.</p>
  <p>In  a desperation, which was but the faint reflection of his own, I tried to help  him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it for your lawyer?&rdquo; I suggested; then, as he made no sign, I hastily added: &ldquo;For  your doctor? For your wife? For anyone in the house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  gave me one supreme look, raised his eyes, and for an instant stood in an attitude  so expressive of joy and indefinable expectancy that I was astonished beyond  words and forgot that I was in the presence of death. But only for a moment.  While I was still marvelling at this sudden change in him, the child who was  clinging to him uttered a terrified scream and unloosed her arms. Then I saw  him sink, gasp, and fall forward, and, springing, caught him in my arms before  his head could touch the floor. Alas! it was the last service I could render him.  By the time I had laid him down he had expired, and I found myself, in no other  company than that of a trembling child, bending above the dead body of a man  who with his last breath had charged me with a commission of whose purport I  understood nothing, save that under no circumstances and upon no pretext was I  to deliver the letter he had entrusted to me, to anyone but the person for whom  it was intended.</p>
  <p>But  who was this person? Ah, that was the question! Certainly my position in this  house of strangers was a most extraordinary one.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
    The Young Doctor And The Old</b></h2>
  <p>Meanwhile  the child had started down the hall, and up the stairs, calling:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Papa!  Papa!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Startled  by this intimation of another person&rsquo;s presence in a house I had supposed to  hold no one but ourselves, I hastily followed her till she reached the floor  above and paused before a shut door. Here something seemed to restrain her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Papa&rsquo;s  inside,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>If  this was so, he was not alone. Laughter, quick exclamations, and the clink of  glasses could plainly be heard through the door; and shocked at the contrast  offered by this scene of mirth to the solemn occurrence which had just taken  place below, I hesitated to enter, and looked about for some means of  communicating with the servants who I now felt must be below. But here the  terrified child, who was clinging to my knee, interposed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not think papa is there. Papa does not like cards. Uncle George does. Come,  let&rsquo;s look for papa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  dragged me toward the front of the house, entered another room, and seemed  surprised to find the light turned down and her papa gone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  he is with Uncle Alph,&rdquo; she faltered, and, bounding up another flight of  stairs, turned around to see if I was behind her.</p>
  <p>There  seemed no alternative left but to follow her till I came upon someone; so I  hastened up this second staircase. She had already entered a room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O  Uncle Alph!&rdquo; I heard her cry. &ldquo;Grandpa&rsquo;s lying on the floor downstairs. I  cannot find papa. I&rsquo;m so frightened,&rdquo; and she ran sobbing towards the young  man, who rose to receive her in an abstraction which even these startling words  failed to break.</p>
  <p>For  this and other reasons I noticed him particularly notwithstanding the  embarrassment of my own position. He was a handsome man of the luxury-loving  type, whose characteristics it would be useless to describe, since they were of  a nature to suggest, rather than explain the extent of his attractions. I  afterwards heard from such of my friends as were in the habit of walking the  avenue with him, that he never failed to draw the attention of passers-by;  something in his features, his carriage, or the turn of his head and shoulders  stamping him as a man worth looking at, not only once, but twice. At this moment,  however, I was not so much impressed by his good looks, as by his uneasy and  feverish expression.</p>
  <p>He  had caught up a letter which he had been engaged in writing at our entrance,  and as the child&rsquo;s appeal rang out, he crumpled it nervously in his hand, and  dropped it into the waste-paper basket. As a certain furtive haste  characterised this action, my attention was caught by it, and I found myself  wondering whether it was a letter or memorandum he thus sacrificed to his  surprise.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  he seemed to be trying to take in what the little one wanted. Evidently he had  not as yet noticed me standing in the doorway, and I thought it best to  introduce myself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am Arthur Outhwaite of the firm of Robinson &amp;  Outhwaite, lawyers. I was passing by the house when this child called me in to  the assistance of her grandfather whom, I am sorry to say, I found in a very  precarious condition in his study downstairs. If he is your father, you have my  sympathy for his sudden demise. He died in my arms a moment ago; and having  been the witness of his last moments, I could not leave the house without  explaining my position to his relatives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead!  Father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was not grief, it was hardly astonishment which gave force to this brief and  involuntary exclamation. It was something quite different, something which it  shocked me to hear in his tones and see sparkle in his eye. But this  expression, whatever it betokened, lasted but a moment. Catching up the child  in his arms, he hid his face behind her and rushed towards the door. Me he  hardly noticed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is he?&rdquo; he asked, ignoring or forgetting what I had told him.</p>
  <p>It  was the child who answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the den, Uncle Alph. Don&rsquo;t take me there; I&rsquo;m afraid. Set me down; I want to  find Hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  hastily obeyed her, and the child ran away. Then, and only then, he seemed to  take in my presence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were called in from the street?&rdquo; he wonderingly observed; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand  it. Where were my brothers? They were near enough to render him assistance. Why  should a stranger be called in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was a question for which I had no answer, so I made none. He did not seem to be  struck by the omission.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us go down,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>I  opened the door which the little one had closed behind her, and proceeded  toward the stair-head. From certain indistinct noises which I had heard during  the foregoing short interchange of words, I expected to find the house in a  state of alarm and everyone alert. But the card-players were still at their  game on the floor below, and I was not surprised to see my companion pause and  give an admonitory kick to the door through which such incongruous noises  issued.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s  ill!&rdquo; he shouted in a voice hoarse with many passions; and waiting for no  reply, he rushed ahead of me downstairs, followed by some half-dozen partially  sobered men.</p>
  <p>Among  these latter I noticed one whom I took to be the elder brother of him whom the  little one had addressed as Uncle Alph. He had the same commanding appearance,  the same abstracted air, and woke, when he did wake, to the same curious  condition of conflicting emotions. But I did not have time to dwell long upon  this feature of the extraordinary affair in which I had become thus curiously  involved.</p>
  <p>The  alarm which had been so slow in spreading above, had passed like wildfire  through the lower part of the house, and we found some half-dozen servants standing  in and about the small room where the master of the house lay stretched. Some  were wringing their hands, some were crying, and some, rigid with terror,  stared at the face they had so lately seen with the hue of health upon it.</p>
  <p>At  our approach they naturally withdrew to the hall, and I presently found myself  standing between the group thus formed and the three or four young gentlemen  visitors who had not followed the brothers into the room. Amongst the latter I  saw one whose face was not altogether unfamiliar, and it was from him that I  gained my first information concerning the man to whose dying passion I had  been witness, and from whom I had received the strange commission which,  unknown to those about me, made my continued presence in this house a necessity  from which the embarrassment of the occasion could not release me.</p>
  <p>The  dead man was Archibald Gillespie, the well-known stockbroker and railroad  magnate, whose name, as well as those of his three spendthrift sons, was in  every man&rsquo;s mouth since that big deal by which he had made two millions in less  than two months.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  one of the gentlemen who had accompanied the two Gillespies into the room where  their father lay, came out looking very pale. He was a doctor, though to all  appearance not the family physician.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  one of you go for Dr. Bennett?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Bring him at once and at any cost;  Mr. Gillespie cannot be moved till he comes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Bennett evidently was the family physician.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  can&rsquo;t he be moved?&rdquo; called out a voice near me. &ldquo;Is there anything wrong? Mr.  Gillespie was violently sick a month ago. I suppose he got around too quickly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the young doctor, without replying, stepped back into the room, leaving us all  agog, though few of us ventured upon open remonstrance.</p>
  <p>In  another minute one of the men near me slipped out in obedience to the request  just made.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  Mrs. Gillespie living?&rdquo; I asked, after a moment spent in more or less  indecision.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  have you come from?&rdquo; was the answer given, seasoned by a stare I bore with what  equanimity I could. &ldquo;Mrs. Gillespie has been dead these fifteen years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So!  the letter was not meant for his wife.</p>
  <p>Here  I caught an eye fixed on mine. It was that of one of the servants who stood  huddled about the doorway of what appeared to be a large dining-room on the  opposite side of the hall. When this man, for it was a male servant, saw that  he had attracted my attention, he made me an imperceptible sign. As he was old  and grey-haired, I heeded the sign he made and stepped towards him. Instantly  he greeted me with the whisper:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to be the only sober man here. Don&rsquo;t let them do anything till Mr.  Leighton comes in. He is the saint of the family, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he the little girl&rsquo;s father?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>The  man nodded. &ldquo;And a good man, too,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;A very good man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  this honest judgment or sarcasm? I had heard that each of Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s sons  had given his father no end of trouble.</p>
  <p>Meantime  a silence deeper than that of awe had spread throughout the house. Feeling  myself out of place and yet strangely in place, I drew aside into as  inconspicuous a corner as I could find, and waited as all the others did, for  the family physician.</p>
  <p>While  doing so I caught stray glimpses of my first acquaintance, Alfred Gillespie,  who, fretted by some anxiety he could not altogether conceal, came more than  once into the hall and threw furtive glances up the stairway. Was it the little  girl he was concerned about? If so, I shared his anxiety.</p>
  <p>At  last the bell rang. Instantly, so great was the strain upon us, we all moved,  and one or two bounded towards the door. But it was opened by the butler with  that mechanical habitude such old servants acquire, and, though nothing could  shake the calm deference of this trained domestic, there was something in the  bow with which he greeted the newcomer which assured us that the man we so  anxiously expected had arrived.</p>
  <p>I  had seen Dr. Bennett more than once, but never before showing so much anxiety.  Whether from shock or some secret cause not to be communicated to us, this old  and capable physician seemed to be in a condition of as much agitation as  ourselves, and obeyed the summons of the young doctor who stood beckoning to  him from the threshold of the little den, with an appearance of alacrity that  nevertheless had an odd element of hesitation in it. I might not have noticed  this under other circumstances, and am quite sure that no one else detected any  peculiarity in his manner, but to me, everything was important which offered  anything like a clue to the proper understanding of a situation in which I  found myself so deeply, yet so secretly involved.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gillespie&rsquo;s physician remained for some minutes closeted with the sons of the  deceased and their young medical friend; then he came out. Instantly I saw from  his expression that our fears or rather, those of the young doctor, were not  without foundation. Yet he was careful not to raise an alarm, and in addressing  us, spoke in strictly professional tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  sad case, gentlemen! Mr. Gillespie has taken an overdose of chloral. We will  have to leave him where he is till the coroner can be called.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  gasp followed by the clink of breaking glass came from the dining-room behind  me. The old butler had dropped a glass he had just lifted off the mantel-shelf  of the dining-room.</p>
  <p>The  doctor was at his side in a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is that?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
  <p>The  butler stooped for the pieces.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  the glass Mr. Gillespie drank out of. He asked for wine a half hour ago. Your  words frightened me, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did not look frightened; but old servants of his stamp possess a strange  immobility.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will pick up these pieces,&rdquo; said the doctor, stooping beside the man.</p>
  <p>The  butler drew back. Dr. Bennett picked up the pieces. They were all dry.  Evidently the glass had been drained.</p>
  <p>As  he came out he cast a keen but not unkindly glance at the group of young men  drawn up in the doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  of you was the witness of Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s death?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>I  bowed. I dreaded his questions, yet saw no way of evading them. If only Mr.  Gillespie had been able to articulate the one word which would have relieved me  of all further responsibility in this matter!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are the person who was called into the house by Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s grandchild?&rdquo;  the doctor now asked, meeting my eye with the same expression of instantaneous  and complete confidence I had seen on the features of his unhappy patient.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am,&rdquo; I replied; and proceeded to relate the circumstances with all the  simplicity the occasion required. Only I said nothing about the letter which  had been entrusted to me for delivery to some unknown person. How could I?  There had been no encouragement in Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s expression when I asked him  if the note I had taken from him was meant for his doctor.</p>
  <p>The  account I was able to give of the deceased broker&rsquo;s last moments seemed to  deepen the impression which had been made upon the physician by the condition  in which he found him. Taking up the pieces of glass he had collected from the  dining-room hearth, he sniffed them carefully, during which act the two sons of  Mr. Gillespie watched him with starting eyes. When he laid them down again, we  could none of us conceal our curiosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have something dreadful to communicate,&rdquo; murmured the elder son.</p>
  <p>The  doctor hesitated; then he glanced from one to the other of the two handsome  faces before him, and remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  brother is not here. Do you know if he is likely to return soon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Mr. Leighton?&rdquo; inquired Alfred, turning towards the servants. &ldquo;I thought he  meant to remain home to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  butler respectfully advanced.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Leighton went out an hour ago,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He and Mr. Gillespie had a few words  in the den, sir, after which he put on his hat and coat and went out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see your master at that time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir, I only heard his voice.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  that sound natural?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old servant seemed loath to reply, but feeling the doctor&rsquo;s eye resting  imperatively upon him, he hesitatingly admitted:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  wasn&rsquo;t quiet, sir, if you mean that. Mr. Gillespie seemed to be angry or very  much displeased. He spoke quite loud.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  were you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the dining-room, sir, putting away the last of the dinner dishes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you hear what your master said?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir; it was something about religion; too much religion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  brother attends too many mission services to please my father,&rdquo; explained  Alfred in a low tone.</p>
  <p>The  doctor heard, but did not take his eye from the old servant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  this before he took the glass of wine you have just told us he asked for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, just before. It was Mr. Leighton who came for it. He said his father  looked tired.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  and how came the glass to be back then on the dining-room mantel-shelf?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know, sir. Perhaps Mr. Gillespie put it there himself. He never liked any  litter on his study table, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this statement the older brother opened his lips, but I noticed he did not  speak. There were no traces of intoxication about him now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you would show me the bottle from which you poured the wine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  butler, whose name I afterwards learned to be Hewson, led the way to a large  buffet extending half across the dining-room wall. From where I stood in the  hall-way I could see him pointing out a bottle of what looked like sherry.  Suddenly he gave a start.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  isn&rsquo;t the one,&rdquo; he cried, loud enough for me to hear. &ldquo;The bottle I took out  for Mr. Leighton was half-empty. This is quite full.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  I saw the lips of the elder brother move, and again he refrained from speaking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like to have that bottle found,&rdquo; said the physician; &ldquo;but no one need  look for it now. Indeed, it would be better for us to wait for Leighton&rsquo;s  return before making any further movement. George, Alfred, may I ask you to  leave me alone with your father for a few minutes. And let the dining-room be  cleared. I don&rsquo;t want to have to make any excuses to the coroner when he  arrives. Your father has not died a natural death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was an announcement for which we had been in a measure prepared by the serious  manner of the young doctor, yet it seemed to me it ought to have occasioned a  greater, or at least a different display of feeling on the part of the two most  intimately concerned. I looked for an exchange of glances between them or at  least some hurried words of sorrow or dismay. But though all evinced strong  emotion, no looks passed between them, nor did they make the least attempt at  mutual sympathy or encouragement. Were they not on confidential terms? The moment  certainly was one to call out whatever brotherly feeling they possessed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall have to make use of the telephone,&rdquo; Dr. Bennett now announced. &ldquo;You must  pardon my seeming disrespect to the dead. The occasion demands it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  with one hurried look to see that his commands had been obeyed, and that the  dining-room had been cleared of the huddling servants, he stepped back into the  so-called den and closed the door behind him.</p>
  <p>Next  moment we heard his voice rise in the inevitable &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t understand Dr. Bennett&rsquo;s strange demeanour,&rdquo; I now heard uttered in  remark near me. It was George speaking in a low tone to his brother.</p>
  <p>But  that brother, with one of his anxious looks up the stairs, failed to answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father  was in the habit of taking chloral, but I thought he always waited until he got  to his own room. I never knew him to take it downstairs before,&rdquo; George went on  in a low tone between a whisper and a grumble.</p>
  <p>This  time Alfred answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  made an exception to-night,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;When I ran down to your door at  half-past eight, I met Claire coming out of father&rsquo;s room with a bottle in her  hand. She had been sent up after the chloral, and was taking it down to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>George  gave his brother a suspicious look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  she say so?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  child! She will miss her grandfather. I wonder if she knows?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  felt that I had no right to listen. But I was standing where the doctor had  left me, and hardly knew how to withdraw till I had received my dismissal from  someone in authority. Yet I was thinking of going farther front when the doctor  came out again and, approaching me, remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  delay is probably causing you great inconvenience. But I must ask you to remain  a short time longer. I presume you can find a seat in the drawing-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a glance at the young gentlemen, I expressed my obligations for his courtesy,  but did not make a move towards the room he had indicated.</p>
  <p>Instantly,  and with an understanding of my feelings which surprised me, George took the  hint I had given him, and stepping forward, raised a heavy plush curtain at the  left and begged me to be seated in the richly appointed room within. But I had  hardly taken a step towards it when a diversion was created by the entrance  into the house of a gentleman whom I at once took to be the third brother for  whose presence all waited with more or less suspense.</p>
  <p>He  was sufficiently prepossessing in appearance to awaken admiration, but he bore  no resemblance to his brothers. He seemed to have more character and less&mdash;well,  I find it difficult to say just what impression he made upon me at this moment.  Enough that with my first glimpse of him I felt confident that no ordinary  person had entered upon the scene, though just what special characteristic of  his personality or disposition would prove the emphatic one it was not easy to  judge, at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>
  <p>He  had a downcast air, and to my eyes looked weary to the point of collapse, but  he roused at the sight of a stranger, and cast an inquiring look at the doctor  and then at the servants crowding in the passage beyond.</p>
  <p>He  evidently took me for one of his brothers&rsquo; boon companions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  amiss?&rdquo; he demanded in some irritation&mdash;an irritation I was fain to construe  into a total lack of preparation for the fatal news awaiting him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the  matter, George? What&rsquo;s the matter, Alph?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  worst!&rdquo; came in simultaneous reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father  is dead!&rdquo; cried George.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Took  too much chloral,&rdquo; added Alfred.</p>
  <p>Leighton  Gillespie stood stock-still for a moment, then threw off his hat and rushed  down the hall. But at the door of what now might be called the chamber of  death, he found the doctor standing in an attitude which compelled him to come  to a sudden stop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a moment,&rdquo; said that gentleman. &ldquo;I have to correct an impression. Your father  has not died from an overdose of chloral as I had at first supposed, but from a  deadly dose of prussic acid. You have only to smell his lips to be certain of  this fact. Now, Leighton, you may enter.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
    What A Door Hid</b></h2>
  <p>It  was a startling declaration, and the horror it called up was visible on every  face. But the surprise which should have accompanied it was lacking, and  however quickly the three nearest the deceased man&rsquo;s heart strove to cover up  their first instinctive acceptance of a fact so suggestive of hidden troubles,  I could not but see that the prosperous stockbroker had had griefs, anxieties,  or hopes to which this sudden end seemed to those who knew him best, a natural  sequence.</p>
  <p>I  began to regret the chance which had brought me into such close relations with  this family, and felt the closed envelope in my pocket weighing on my breast  like lead.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  he whom they called Leighton was saying in a highly strained tone, which he  vainly endeavoured to make natural:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  not Dr. Bennett be mistaken? There is the chloral bottle on the shelf over the  fireplace. We are not in the habit of seeing it here. Does not its presence in  this room argue that father felt the need of it. Prussic acid can only be  obtained through a doctor, and I am confident you never prescribed him such a  dangerous drug, Dr. Bennett.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  for it is totally inapplicable to his case. But you will find that he died from  taking it, Leighton; all his symptoms show it, and we have only to determine  now whether he took it in the chloral, in the glass of wine he drank, or by  means of some other agency not yet discovered. I regret to speak so  unequivocally, but I never mince matters where my profession is concerned. And,  besides, the coroner would not show you this consideration even if I did. The  fact is too patent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  were now inside the study and I did not hear Leighton&rsquo;s reply, but when they  all came out again, I saw that the latter had not only accepted the situation,  but that he had been informed of the part I had been called upon to play in  this matter. This was apparent from the way he greeted me, and the questions he  put concerning his child&rsquo;s conduct during the last terrible moments of her  grandfather&rsquo;s life.</p>
  <p>As  he did this I had a fuller opportunity for studying his face. It was the most  melancholy one I had ever seen, and what struck me as being worthy of remark  was that this melancholy seemed a settled one and quite apart from the present  grief and disturbance. Yet he had been heavily shaken by his father&rsquo;s sudden if  not inexplicable death, or appeared to be, which possibly is not quite the same  thing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not understand why my father should have called anyone in from the street to  witness his sufferings while he had sons in the house,&rdquo; he courteously  remarked; &ldquo;but having felt this necessity and having succeeded in obtaining  such help, I am glad that chance favoured him and us with a person of such  apparent good feeling as yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  scarcely heeded him. I was pondering over the letter and whether I should pass  it over to this man. But instinct withheld me, or rather my lawyer-like habits  which happily acted as a restraint upon my natural impulse. I had received no  intimation as yet that it was intended for any of Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s sons.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will oblige us by waiting for the coroner?&rdquo; he now went on. &ldquo;He has telephoned  that he will be here immediately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall wait,&rdquo; I said. And it was by his invitation I now stepped into the  parlour.</p>
  <p>A  quarter of an hour, a half-hour, passed before the front door bell rang again.  From the hubbub which ensued, I knew that the man we wished for had arrived,  but it was a long while before he entered the room in which I sat, during which  tedious interim I had to possess my soul in patience. But at last I heard his  step on the threshold, and looking up, I beheld a spare, earnest man who  approached me with great seriousness, and sat down near enough to indulge in  confidential talk without running the risk of being heard by anyone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are Mr. Outhwaite,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I have heard of your firm and have more than  once seen Mr. Robinson. Had you any acquaintance with Mr. Gillespie or his  family before to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir; Mr. Gillespie was known to me only by reputation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  it was pure chance which led you to be a witness of his final moments?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pure  chance, if we do not believe in Providence,&rdquo; I returned.</p>
  <p>He  surveyed me quite intently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Relate  what passed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now  here was a dilemma. Did my duty exact a revelation of the facts which I had  hitherto felt obliged to keep even from the deceased man&rsquo;s sons? It was a  question not to be decided in a moment, so I made up my mind to be guided by  developments, and confined my narration to a recapitulation of my former plain  account of Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s last moments. This narrative I made as simple as I  could. When I had finished he asked if Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s grandchild had been  present at the moment her grandfather expired.</p>
  <p>I  answered that she had been clinging to him all the time he remained erect, but  shrank back and ran out of the room the moment he gave signs of falling to the  floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he speak to her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  that I heard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he say anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  few inarticulate words, no names.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did not ask for his sons?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  none of them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  came the alarm to be spread?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went up with the child and called the young men down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Coroner  Frisbie stroked his chin, still looking at me intently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  there an empty phial or a piece of paper lying about on the study-table or on  the floor when you went in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I started.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paper?&rdquo;  I repeated. &ldquo;What kind of paper?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  as is used by druggists and physicians in rolling up their prescriptions. The  prussic acid which Mr. Gillespie has evidently taken must have been bought in  liquid form. The bottle which held it should be lying about and possibly the  paper in which it was wrapped. That is, if this poison was swallowed  intentionally by Mr. Gillespie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  recalled the exact look of the scrap of paper I had put into an envelope at  this gentleman&rsquo;s request. It was not such a one as is used by druggists in  wrapping up parcels, and I felt my breast grow lighter by a degree.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not see any such paper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is the little girl?&rdquo; he now queried. &ldquo;I must see her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had made up my mind to one thing. If the child said that I had been given a  paper by her grandfather I would acknowledge it and produce the envelope. But  if she had forgotten the fact or had been too frightened to notice it, I would  preserve silence in regard to it a little longer, in the hope of being shown a  way out of my difficulty.</p>
  <p>I  was therefore not sorry to hear him ask for the little girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  take it that you are not anxious to remain here,&rdquo; he now remarked. &ldquo;If you will  give me your address and hold yourself in readiness to obey my summons, I can  excuse you for the night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  answer I held out my card, and seeing that I had no further excuse for  lingering, was moving toward the door, when Dr. Bennett came hurriedly in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have found something&mdash;&rdquo; he began, and then paused with a quick glance in my  direction, as if questioning the propriety of proceeding further with his  discovery in my presence.</p>
  <p>The  coroner showed no such hesitation. Hastening to meet the old family physician,  he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have found the bottle or only the paper in which the bottle was wrapped?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Bennett drew him aside, and I saw what looked like a small cork pass between  them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  it in Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s study you found this?&rdquo; queried the coroner. &ldquo;I thought I  had thoroughly searched the study.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  answer was uttered in the lowest of low tones, but I had no difficulty in  catching the gist of what he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was on the dining-room floor, under the edge of the rug. A very suspicious  fact, don&rsquo;t you think so? Mr. Gillespie would never have thrust it there. Some  other person&mdash;don&rsquo;t know who&mdash;not say anything yet&mdash;shrink from seeing the police  in this house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two doctors interchanged a look which I surprised in the large mirror opposite.  But I gave no sign of having seen anything extraordinary. I felt too keenly the  delicacy of my own position. Next minute we were all walking towards the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;  came in admonitory tones from the coroner as we paused for a moment on the  threshold. &ldquo;Let us not disturb the young men any further than is necessary  to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  that moment we heard the cry:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is Miss Meredith? Has anyone seen Miss Meredith? I cannot find her in any of  the rooms upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hope!  Hope! Where are you, Hope?&rdquo; called out another voice, charged with feeling.</p>
  <p>Hope!  Did my heart beat faster as this name, destined to play such a part in my  future life, was sounded in my ears? I cannot say. That heart has beat often  enough since at the utterance of this sweet monosyllable, but at that time&mdash;well,  I think I was too interested in the alarm which this cry instantly raised, to  note my personal sensations. From one end of the house to the other, men and  women rushed from room to room, and I heard not only this name called out, but  that of the child, which it seems was Claire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cannot  the child be found either?&rdquo; I inquired impetuously of the coroner who still  lingered in the lower hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  seems not. Who is Miss Meredith?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was the old butler who answered him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is the young gentlemen&rsquo;s cousin,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;She was a great favourite with Mr.  Gillespie, and lived here like a daughter. They will find her somewhere  upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  the prophecy proved to be a false one. Slowly the servants came creeping down  whispering among themselves and looking very much frightened. Then we saw  George descend shaking his head impatiently, and then Leighton, wild with an  anxiety for which he had no name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  must be here!&rdquo; he cried, thinking only of his child. &ldquo;Claire! Claire!&rdquo; And he  began running through the great drawing-room where we knew she could not be.</p>
  <p>Alfred  had remained above.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  I recalled a fact connected with my own visit upstairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  they been up to the fourth floor?&rdquo; I inquired of Dr. Bennett. &ldquo;When I was in  Mr. Alfred Gillespie&rsquo;s room on the third floor, I remember hearing someone rush  through the hall. I supposed at that time it was someone going below. But it  may have been someone going higher up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us go see!&rdquo; the doctor suggested.</p>
  <p>I  followed him without a thought. As we passed Alfred&rsquo;s door, we could see him  standing in the middle of the room in a state of rage which made him oblivious  of our approach. He was tearing into morsels a piece of paper which had the  same appearance as the one he had formerly thrust into the waste-paper basket,  and as he tore, he muttered words amongst which I caught the following:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I write? If she loved me she would wait. She would not run away now,  unless he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Bennett, with his finger on his lip, slid by. I hastened after him, and  together we mounted the last flight.</p>
  <p>We  were now in a portion of the building as new to the doctor as to myself. When  we reached the top of the stairs we found the whole place dark save for a  little glimmer towards the front which proved to be a gas-jet burning low in  one of the attic rooms.</p>
  <p>Turning  this up we looked around, opened a closet-door or two, then walked into the  back, where the doctor struck a match. Two closed doors met our eyes. One of  these upon being opened disclosed a well-furnished room, similar in appearance  to those in front, the other an unfinished garret half filled with trunks and  boxes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;  he ejaculated, as the match went out upon this scene. &ldquo;This is a mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo;  I urged; &ldquo;our ears rather than our eyes must do service in this emergency.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  took the hint, and together we listened till some sound&mdash;was it the breathing of  a person concealed near us?&mdash;caused us both to start and the doctor to light  another match.</p>
  <p>This  time we saw something, but the match went out before we could determine what.</p>
  <p>Annoyed  by these momentary flashes of light, I dashed back into one of the rooms we had  left, and catching up a candle I had previously noted there, lit it at the  gas-jet, and proceeded back with it to this garret room.</p>
  <p>Instantly  a sight full of the strangest interest revealed itself.</p>
  <p>Crouched  against the farther wall, with wide-extended eyes fixed full upon us, we  perceived a woman, upon whose pallid face and risen locks terror or some other  equally emphatic passion had so fixed its impress that she looked like some  affrighted creature balked in flight by some dreadful, some unprecedented sight  which held her spell-bound. That she was beautiful, in that touching, feminine  way which goes to the heart, did not lessen the effect of her appearance, nor  were we unmoved by the fact that the child for whom the house had just been ransacked  lay curled up and asleep at her feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is it?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Miss Meredith?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  doctor pressed my hand. &ldquo;We must be careful,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;She seems on the  verge of delirium.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  child shows no fear,&rdquo; I murmured.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  the doctor was approaching the new object of his care.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  choose so cold a place?&rdquo; he asked, smiling on the young girl who still clung,  as if fastened, to the wall against which she had drawn herself. &ldquo;Claire will  catch cold; had you not better come downstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a start she looked down at the little one resting at her feet, and her eyes  showed a sudden intelligence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did she come here?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I did not call her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how came you to be here?&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;Your white dress looks out of place in  this garret.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  lifted herself straight up, with her back to the wall. Claire, who was thus  dislodged from the place at her feet woke, and began to cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard that Mr. Gillespie was dead,&rdquo; came from lips so stiff with fright or some  other deep emotion that I wondered they could form the words. &ldquo;I loved Mr.  Gillespie, and I brought my grief here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700491h-images/page030.png" width="502" height="750"></p>
  <p>She  was still standing pressed against the wall, her hands behind her; and disguise  the fact as I would, I could see that her teeth were chattering with something  more than cold, or even such fear as might follow the sudden death of a near  friend and benefactor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you not come below?&rdquo; urged the doctor, taking up Claire to his fatherly breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;  her lips seemed to cry; but I heard no sound, and when the doctor, giving me  the child, threw his arm about her and drew her away, she yielded pliantly  enough, though with a steady look into his face I did not understand then nor  for a long time afterwards.</p>
  <p>At  the stair-head we met Alfred. Perhaps he had heard us go up, perhaps he had  simply thought of searching the attic himself. His recoil and the exclamation  he made were simultaneous.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have found her!&rdquo; was his cry, a cry which did not refer to the child. Then in  reproachful tones: &ldquo;Hope, why should you give us such a scare? Had we not  enough to face without having our hearts wrung with terror for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  answer was a murmur. With the first moment of encounter with this man her face  had become a mask.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  &ldquo;He Drank It <i>Alone</i>&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>In  making this statement it is not my wish to create any special prejudice against  Alfred. Indeed, I have no right to do so, for when a few minutes later his  brother Leighton came running up the stairs at sound of his child&rsquo;s voice, I  noticed the same recoil on her part, followed by the same impassibility. Nor  did she show a different feeling when in the hall below George came forward  with the inquiries her surprising absence had naturally provoked. From one and  all she involuntarily shrank, but not without suffering to herself and an obvious  attempt to hide this natural impulse under a demeanour more in accordance with  her near relationship to these three men. In Alfred this chilling conduct  awakened emotions only too easy to read; in Leighton, surprise, and in George,  a distrust bordering upon a passion so fierce that he turned from white to red  and from red to white in an instant. Evanescent expressions all of them, but  important as showing the feelings entertained towards her by these men among  whom she had been living for more or less time as a sister.</p>
  <p>But  of my personal sensations you have already heard too much, especially at this  period of my story. Happily, I was able to hide them from other eyes, and  simply showed a natural curiosity when Dr. Bennett, with a sly look in her  direction, whispered in my ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  came she to know of her uncle&rsquo;s death so soon after its occurrence? You say you  heard her rush upstairs while you were in Alfred&rsquo;s room. That was very soon  after you laid the old gentleman out of your arms. Is it possible that you had  already met Miss Meredith? Did she share that first alarm with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  to my knowledge,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;My first view of her was in the attic with you.  Yet she may have been somewhere in this great hall, or in some of the many  rooms I see about us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  I was taking in her beauty, or what I must call beauty from the lack of any  other adequate word. I believe she was not what people call beautiful. She did  not need to be; her charm was incontestable without it; too incontestable, I  fear, for the peace of mind of more men than Alfred and George Gillespie.</p>
  <p>She  was standing by the newel-post, in a position startlingly like that she had  maintained above; and while I shrank from the doubts thus called up, I could  not but perceive in the straightforward look of her eyes, and the fierce clutch  of her hands behind her, that some determination was absorbing all her  energies; a determination little in accord, I fear, with the attitude of simple  grief she made such an effort to maintain. Leighton appeared to see this also,  for he set down the child he had been straining to his breast, and approaching his  cousin, plied her with a few hurried questions.</p>
  <p>But  the coroner, who had shown some embarrassment at the appearance on the scene of  so young and charming a lady, advanced at this juncture and prevented the  answer which was slowly forming on her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you are Miss Meredith, Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s niece and assistant, you are justified  in your grief. Mr. Gillespie has passed away under very extraordinary  circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  hands which had been behind her, came suddenly together in front, but she did  not shift her eyes from the point where she had fixed them. Perhaps she dreaded  to encounter the gaze of the three young men grouped behind the man addressing  her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  those circumstances been related to you?&rdquo; resumed Dr. Frisbie with the  encouragement in his tone which her loveliness and sorrow naturally called  forth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  answer came quickly, and with a sharp accentuation which showed her to be a  woman of force, notwithstanding the condition in which we had first found her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  this little one had said nothing,&rdquo; he continued with a glance at Claire who had  nestled again at her cousin&rsquo;s feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Claire?&rdquo;  she exclaimed in evident surprise. &ldquo;Claire?&rdquo; and her eyes followed his till  they fell inquiringly upon the child whose presence up to this moment she had  probably not noticed. &ldquo;No, she has said nothing; at least nothing that I have  heard.&rdquo; And her hand went out as if she would urge the child away. But she did  not complete the gesture, and I doubt if anyone understood her movement unless  it was myself.</p>
  <p>The  coroner seemed anxious to spare her feelings. &ldquo;Dr. Bennett will communicate to  you our conclusions in this matter,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I simply want to ask you when  you last saw Mr. Gillespie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alive?&rdquo;  she asked, her eyes stealing towards the door of the little den.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  miss; you surely have not seen him dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was with him at supper,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;We were all there&rdquo;; and for the first  time she let her gaze fall on each one of her cousins in succession. &ldquo;My uncle  seemed as well then as at any time since his illness. He ate a good meal and  drank&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  drank,&rdquo; repeated the coroner with a stern look behind him at the young men who  had all moved at this.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  usual glass of wine at dessert. He drank it <i>alone!</i>&rdquo;  she suddenly emphasised, her tone rising in sudden excitement. &ldquo;I can never  forget that he drank it alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  sigh or a suspicion of a sigh answered her. It came from one of her cousins,  but I never knew from which. At its sound she shrank as if heart-pierced, and  put up her hands&mdash;those tell-tale hands&mdash;and covered her ears; then she as  quickly dropped them, and regarded the young men before her slowly, separately,  and with a heartrending significance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would so gladly have joined him in this attempt at old-time sociability had I  but known it would have been his last,&rdquo; she said, and dropped her head again  with a sob.</p>
  <p>At  this look and simple action a burden rolled from my heart. But upon the coroner  and the physician lingering near my side, both look and words fell with a  weight which made this investigation, if investigation it could be called, halt  a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not understand you,&rdquo; observed the former after a momentary interval  surcharged with deep emotion. &ldquo;Was Mr. Gillespie in the habit of sharing his  wine with those who sat at his board, that you feel the pathos of that lonely  glass so keenly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I never knew the dinner to close before without some sort of toast from one of  his sons. It is the coincidence that affects me. But I should not have  mentioned it. No one could have known that this was destined to be our last  meal together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was looking straight before her now. Though it seems more or less incredible,  she was evidently unconscious of having raised the black banner of suspicion  over the heads of her three cousins. But the blank silence which followed her  words appeared to give her some idea of what she had done, for with a sudden  start and a change in her appearance which startled us all, she threw out her  arms with the cry:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are keeping something from me. How did my uncle die? Tell me! tell me at once!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leighton  sprang for his child, caught her up and fled with her into a farther room.  George tottered, then drew himself proudly erect. Alfred, who had been gnawing  his finger-ends in restrained passion, alone stepped forward to her aid, though  in a deprecatory way which robbed him of a large part of his natural grace. But  she appeared insensible to them all. Her attention was fixed upon the doctor,  whom she followed with an agonising gaze, which warned him to be brief if she  was to hear his words at all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  uncle is the victim of <i>poison</i>,&rdquo; said  he. &ldquo;But we have reason to think he took it some time later than at the evening  meal. Prussic acid makes quick work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  latter explanation fell unheeded. She had fallen at the word <i>poison</i>.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
    Hope</b></h2>
  <p>This  was the proper moment for me to leave, or rather it would have been had it not  been for the communication in my pocket which remained to be delivered. To go  without fulfilling my duty in this regard or at least without stating to the  coroner that I held in charge a paper of so much importance, seemed an improper  if not criminal proceeding, while to speak, and thus give up to public perusal  an enclosure upon the right delivery of which the dying man laid such stress,  struck me as an equal breach of trust only to be justified by my total  inability to carry out the wish of the deceased as expressed to me in his last intelligible  appeal.</p>
  <p>That  this inability was an assured fact I was not yet convinced. An idea had come to  me in the last few minutes which, if properly acted upon, might open a way for  me out of this dilemma. But before making use of it I felt it necessary to know  more of this family and the ties which bound them. To gain this knowledge was,  therefore, of not only great but immediate importance; and where could I hope  to gain it so soon or so well as here.</p>
  <p>I  consequently lingered, and the young medical friend of George, having for some  reason shown the same disregard as myself to the open hint thrown out by the  coroner, we drew together near the front door, and fell immediately into  conversation. As he seemed on fire to speak, I left it for him to make the  opening remark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fine  girl!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Very fond of her uncle. Used to help him with his  correspondence. I hate to see women faint. Though I have been in practice now  two years I have never got used to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Anxious  as I was to understand the very relationship he hinted at, it was so obnoxious  to me to discuss Miss Meredith with this man whom I had first seen in a  condition little calculated to prejudice me in his favour, that somewhat  inconsistently, I own, I turned the conversation upon Mr. Gillespie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Gillespie was then a very busy man,&rdquo; I observed. &ldquo;I judged so from the look of  his den or study. Overwork often drives men to suicide.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  glance this called out from the now thoroughly sobered young doctor was a sharp  one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he acquiesced; but it was an acquiescence which, from the tone in which it was  uttered, had a most suspicious ring.</p>
  <p>My  position had now become an embarrassing one. I looked around for the coroner,  and saw him talking earnestly with the old and enfeebled butler, who seemed  ready to sink with distress. At the same instant, the rattling of two keys  could be heard in their several locks. The dining-room was being closed against  intrusion, and it was to the coroner the keys were brought.</p>
  <p>Miss  Meredith, who had been carried into an adjoining room, was slowly recovering.  This was evident from the countenance and attitude of Alfred Gillespie, who  stood half in and half out of the room, with his eyes fixed upon her face. This  left the hall clear, and, as my companion chose to preserve silence, I  presently could hear the story the old butler was endeavouring to relate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was waiting on the table as usual, sir, and it was my hand which uncorked the  bottle and set it down before Mr. Gillespie. The young gentlemen had nothing to  do with that bottle; they did not even touch it, for none of them seemed  inclined to drink. Mr. George said he had a headache, and Mr. Leighton, well,  he makes a point of not touching port; while Mr. Alfred gave no excuse; simply  waved it away when I passed it, so that the old gentleman drank alone. He didn&rsquo;t  seem to feel quite happy, sir, and that was why Miss Meredith got so excited. She  never could bear to see her uncle displeased with her cousins.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  where is that bottle of port and the glass out of which Mr. Gillespie drank at  the table?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O,  sir, you must excuse me, sir, but&mdash;but&mdash;I drank what was left in that bottle. I  often do when there is only a little left. Master didn&rsquo;t mind. He often said,  if he was in the mood to remember me, &lsquo;You may finish that, Hewson,&rsquo; and though  he did not say it to-night, I made so bold as to remember the times he had. You  see I have lived for twenty years in the family. I was a young man when Mr.  Gillespie took me into his service first, and we had become used to each other&rsquo;s  ways. As for the glass, that was washed, sir, long ago. He was well enough up  to nine o&rsquo;clock, you see, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  until after he had taken the sherry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  you also brought him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir; I took it out of the buffet, sir; but it was Mr. Leighton who carried it  into the den. He rang for me from the dining-room, and when I came up he asked  for his father&rsquo;s bottle of sherry, and I gave it to him. Then I went downstairs  again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And <i>that</i> bottle has not been found?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not seen it, sir. Perhaps someone else has. It was not a full one. He had  had a glass or two out of it before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have not said where the glass came from, from which Mr. Gillespie drank the  sherry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  the buffet also. We always keep a supply in one of the lower cupboards, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you take it out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you take the first one you came to and hand it directly to Mr. Leighton?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  the room light or dark? Could you see plainly where to lay your hand, or did  you have to feel about for a glass?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t remember it as being any too light. There was only one gas-jet turned on,  and the room is a big one. But I saw the glasses plainly enough. I know just  where to find them, you see, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. Then you probably noticed whether the one you took out was clean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are always clean. I wear my spectacles when I wash them.&rdquo; The old butler seemed  quite indignant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; then you have to wear spectacles?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I wipe the glasses? Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  coroner pushed the matter no further. I think he feared it would seem like an  attempt to fix the guilt on Leighton. Besides, he had no time to do so, for at  this moment Miss Meredith appeared on the threshold of the room into which she  had been carried, and, pausing there, stood looking up and down the hall with  an ardent and disquieted gaze which Alfred, who had started aside at her  approach, tried in vain to draw upon himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Claire?  Where is Claire?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I want to put her to bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  she is,&rdquo; answered Leighton, coming from the drawing-room with the child fast  asleep on his shoulder. &ldquo;Take her, Hope, and be careful not to wake her. Better  lay her down as she is than have her frightened again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hope  held out her arms. I was startled at her aspect. &ldquo;Miss Meredith is not able as  yet to carry the child upstairs,&rdquo; spoke up the doctor; but the child was  already nestled against her breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can carry her,&rdquo; she assured him, drawing her head back as the father stooped to  kiss the child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you sure?&rdquo; asked Alfred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite.&rdquo;  Her arms had closed spasmodically over the child.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me go with you,&rdquo; he prayed. But catching the coroner&rsquo;s eye, he quickly added, &ldquo;that  is, if you feel the need of any assistance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Apparently  she did not, for next minute I saw her faltering figure proceeding up alone,  while the scowl which had begun to form on George&rsquo;s forehead had smoothed out,  and only Alfred showed discomfiture.</p>
  <p>The  next minute the coroner had concentrated the attention of us all by saying  gravely to the three young men before him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You,  as sons of Mr. Gillespie, will surely see the justice of my making an immediate  attempt to find out how and when your father took the poison, which, to all  appearance, has ended his invaluable life.&rdquo; Then, as no one replied, he added quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  bottle is missing; the bottle of sherry from which he drank a glass since  supper. Will you grant me leave to search the house till I find it? So little  time has passed, it must assuredly be somewhere within reach.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can tell you where it is,&rdquo; rejoined one of the brothers. &ldquo;I wanted a drink. I  had friends upstairs, and I came down and carried off the first bottle I saw.  You will find it in my room above. We all drank our share, so there can have  been no harm in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was George who spoke, and I now saw why his lips had moved when this bottle was  first mentioned.</p>
  <p>The  coroner showed relief, yet made a movement singularly like a signal towards the  rear hall which I had supposed vacant since the servants had been sent out of  it. That he was speaking in the meantime did not detract from the  suggestiveness of the gesture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  and your friends drank of it?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Very good. That settles one doubt.&rdquo;  And he waited, or appeared to wait, for some event connected, as I felt sure,  with the step we all could now hear moving in that hall.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  these steps grew louder, and a young man, evidently as much of a stranger to  the occupants of the house as to myself, approached from the servants&rsquo;  staircase with a bottle in his hand.</p>
  <p>Quietly  the coroner took it, quietly he held it up before the last speaker, without  attempting to explain or to apologise in any way for the presence of the man of  whom he had just made such dramatic use.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this the bottle you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That  young gentleman nodded.</p>
  <p>The  coroner held the bottle up to the light. Only a few drops remained in it. These  he both smelled and tasted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the contents of this bottle seem pure.&rdquo; And he handed it  back to the man, who immediately carried it out of sight.</p>
  <p>Leighton  looked as if he would like to demand who this fellow was, but he did not.  Indeed it seemed hardly necessary. His confident manner, his alert eye which  took us all in at a glance, satisfied us that the event we had all dreaded had  transpired, and that a detective had entered the house.</p>
  <p>Noticing,  but not heeding, the effect which this unwelcome intruder had produced upon the  proud trio he held under his eye, Dr. Frisbie proceeded with the questions  naturally called forth by the acknowledgment made by George.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were on this floor, then, previous to your father&rsquo;s death, possibly previous to  his taking the draught which has so unfortunately ended his life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was on this floor an hour or so ago; yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you see your father or anyone else at that time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  To tell you the truth, I was a little ashamed of my errand. It was early in the  evening for the social glass, so I just took the bottle off the buffet and went  back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the glasses?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I always have enough of them in my room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  coroner&rsquo;s hand went in characteristic action to his chin. Evidently he found  his position difficult.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  poison in this bottle,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;None in the one your old butler drained,  and, so far as we are able to judge, none in the phial of chloral found  standing on the study mantelpiece! Yet your father died from taking prussic  acid. Cannot one of you assist me in saying how this came about? It will save  us unnecessary trouble and the house some scandal.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was an appeal which the sons of Mr. Gillespie could little afford to ignore.  Yet while each and all of them paled under the searching gaze which accompanied  it, none of them spoke till the silence becoming unendurable, Leighton made an  extraordinary effort and remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father was a proud man. If he chose&mdash;I say, if he chose to end his troubles in  this unfortunate way, he would plan to leave behind him no sign of an act  calculated to bring such opprobrium upon his household. He would have acted  under the hope that his death would be taken as the result of his late sickness.  That is doubtless why you fail to find the phial from which the poison was  poured.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hum!  Yes! I see. Your father had troubles, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  answer was unexpected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father had three sons, none of whom gave him unalloyed comfort. Is not this  true, George? Is not this true, Alfred?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Startled  by the sudden appeal which, coming as it did from a man of great personal  pride, produced an effect thrilling to the spectators as well as to the men  addressed, the brothers flushed deeply, but ventured upon no protest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  and father have always been on good enough terms,&rdquo; growled George, with an  attempt at fairness which gained point from the dogged air with which it was  given.</p>
  <p>This  brought a shadow over the face which a moment before had shone with something  like lofty feeling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot forget that we quarrelled an hour before he died,&rdquo; murmured Leighton,  moving off with an air of great depression.</p>
  <p>Meantime  I had taken a resolution. Advancing from the remote end of the hall where I had  been standing with their young medical friend, I spoke up firmly, calmly, but  with decision:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,  I have been waiting to see what my duty was. I have reason to think,  notwithstanding my position as a stranger among you, that the clue to your  father&rsquo;s strange act is to be found in my hands. Will you allow me, before  explaining myself further, to request your answer to a single question?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  surprise which this evoked, was shared by the coroner, who probably thought he  had exhausted my testimony at our first interview.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a question which will strike you as strange and out of place at a time so  serious. But I pray you to show your confidence in me by giving me a  straightforward reply. Was Mr. Gillespie a man of dramatic instincts? Had he  any special powers of mimicry, or, if I may speak plainly, had he what you  might call marked facial expression?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  the astonishment this called out I saw no dissent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father  was a man of talent,&rdquo; Alfred grudgingly allowed. &ldquo;I have often heard Claire  laugh at his stories, which she said were like little plays. But this is a  peculiar if not inappropriate question to put to us at a time of such distress,  Mr. Outhwaite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I forewarned you,&rdquo; I rejoined, turning to the coroner. &ldquo;Dr. Frisbie, I must  throw myself upon your clemency. When I entered this house in response to an  appeal from Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s grandchild, I found that gentleman labouring under  great mental as well as physical distress. He was anxious, more than anxious,  to have some special wish carried out; and being tongue-tied, found great  difficulty in indicating what this was. But after many efforts, he made me understand  that I was to take from him a paper which he held in his clenched hand; and  when I had done so, that I was to enclose it, folded as it was, in one of the  envelopes lying on the table before us. Not seeing any reason then for  non-compliance with his wishes, I accomplished this under his eye, and then  asked him for the name and address of the person for whom this communication  was intended; but by this time his faculties had failed to such an extent, he  could not pronounce the name. He could only ejaculate: &lsquo;To no one else&mdash;only to&mdash;to&mdash;&rsquo;  Alas! he could not finish the sentence. But, gentlemen, while waiting here I  have been enabled to complete in my own mind this final attempt at speech on  the part of your father. Anxious to make no mistake (for the impression made by  his dying adjuration not to deliver this letter into the wrong hands, was no  ordinary one), I have not allowed myself to be moved by any hurried or  inconsiderate impulse, to part with this communication even to those whose  claims upon it might be considered paramount to those of a mere stranger like myself.  But since seeing Miss Meredith, above all since hearing you address her by her  name of Hope, I cannot help feeling justified in believing that this final  communication from Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s hand was meant for her. For when in my  perplexity I pressed him to give me some sign by which I could make out whether  it was intended for his doctor, his lawyer, or his household, he roused and his  face showed an elevated look which I now feel compelled to regard as a dramatic  attempt to express in action the name he could no longer utter. Gentlemen, I  have described his action. What name among those you are accustomed to speak  best fits it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hope,&rdquo;  was the simultaneous reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I have presumed to think.&rdquo; And turning to Dr. Frisbie, I added: &ldquo;I have been  told that this young lady was in her uncle&rsquo;s confidence. Will you allow me to  deliver this envelope to Miss Meredith, in accordance with the injunction I  firmly believe myself to have received from Mr. Gillespie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a silence during which no movement was made. Then the coroner replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  if it is done in my presence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  turned again to the young gentlemen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Commiserate  my position and send for Miss Meredith,&rdquo; I prayed. &ldquo;I feel bound to place this  in her hands myself. If I make a mistake in thus interpreting the look given me  by your father, it will at least be made under your eye and from unquestionable  motives. With my limited knowledge of the family, I know of no one who has a  better claim to this communication than she. Do you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>None  of them attempted a reply.</p>
  <p>Dr.  Bennett had already gone up for Miss Meredith.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
    A Happy Inspiration</b></h2>
  <p>While  waiting for this young lady, I surveyed the three Gillespies with a more  critical attention than I had hitherto had the opportunity of giving them. As a  result, George struck me as being the most candid, Leighton the most  intellectual, and Alfred the most turbulent and ungovernable in his loves and  animosities. All were under the same mental tension and in all I beheld  evidence of deep humiliation and distrust, but this similarity of feeling did  not draw them together even outwardly, but rather seemed to provoke a self-concentration  which kept them widely apart. As I looked longer, Leighton impressed himself  upon me as an interesting study&mdash;possibly because he was difficult to  understand; Alfred as a good lover but dangerous hater; and George as the best  of good fellows when his rights were not assailed or his kindly disposition  imposed upon. None of them seemed to take any interest in <i>me.</i> To them I was simply a connecting link between their dead  father and the letter I held in charge for Miss Meredith.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  the coroner showed but one anxiety, and that was for the lady&rsquo;s speedy  appearance and the consequent reading of the letter upon which all minds were  fixed.</p>
  <p>She  came sooner than we expected. As her soft footfall descended the stairs a  visible change took place in us all. Drooping figures started erect and  furrowed brows grew smooth. Some of us even assumed that appearance of reserve  which men unconsciously take on when their deeper feelings are stirred. Only  Leighton acted in a perfectly natural manner; consequently it was in his  direction her frightened glances flew when she realised that she had been  summoned for some definite purpose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what more you can want of me to-night,&rdquo; she protested in a tone  little short of a frightened gasp. &ldquo;I am hardly fit to talk. But the doctor  said I must come down. Why couldn&rsquo;t you have left me with Claire?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,  dear Hope, this gentleman you see here, and who, as you know, was with my  father when he died, says he has a letter, or some communication from your  uncle, which he is sure was meant for your eye only. Do you think my father  would be likely to leave you such a message? Have you any reason for expecting  his last thoughts would be for you, rather than for his sons? Answer; we are  quite prepared to hear you say Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  had been trying to steady herself without laying hold of his arm. But she found  this impossible. With an expression of deepest anguish she caught at his wrist,  and then facing us, murmured in failing tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  might. I have helped him lately a great deal with his letter-writing. Must I  read it <i>here?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In  this last question and her manner of uttering it there was an appeal which  almost took the form of prayer. But it failed to produce any effect upon the  coroner, favourably as he seemed disposed to regard her. With some bluntness, I  had almost said harshness, he answered her with a peremptory:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  miss, <i>here</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was not prepared for this refusal, and her eyes, full of entreaty, flashed from  one face to another till they settled again on the coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Spare me! I do not seem to have full use of my  faculties. My head swims&mdash;I cannot see&mdash;let me take it to the light over there&mdash;I  am a nervous girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  had gradually drawn herself away from Leighton. The envelope which had been  given her was trembling in her hand, and her eyes, wandering from George to  Alfred, seemed to pray for some encouragement they were powerless to give. &ldquo;I  ought to be allowed the right to read the last words of one so dearly loved  without feeling myself under the eyes of&mdash;of strangers,&rdquo; she finally declared  with a certain pitiful access of hauteur certainly not natural to one of her  manifestly generous temperament.</p>
  <p>Was  the shaft meant for me? I did not think so, but, in recognition of the hint  conveyed, I stepped back and had almost reached the door when I heard the  coroner say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  the words you find there have reference solely to your own interests, Miss  Meredith, you will be allowed to read them in privacy. But if they refer in any  way to the interests of the man who wrote it, you will yourself desire to read  his words aloud, as the manner and meaning of his death is a mystery which you  as well as all the other members of his household must desire to see  immediately cleared up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Open  it!&rdquo; she cried, thrusting it into the hands of the physician, who by this time  had rejoined the group. &ldquo;And may God&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  did not finish. The sacred name seemed to act as a restraint upon the passion  in whose cause it had been invoked. With her back to them all she waited for the  doctor to read the lines to which she seemed to attach so apprehensive an  interest.</p>
  <p>It  was impossible for me to leave at a moment so critical. Watching the doctor, I  saw him draw out the paper I had so carefully enclosed in an envelope, and  after looking at it, turn it over and over in such astonishment and perplexity  that we all caught the alarm and crowded about him for explanation. Alas, it  was a simple one! The paper concerning which I had endured so many qualms of  conscience, and from the reading of which the young girl had shrunk with every  appearance of intolerable dread, proved upon opening it to be an absolutely  blank one.</p>
  <p>There  was not upon its smooth surface so much as the faintest trace of words.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
    The Elderly Gentleman By The Newel-Post</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is surprising. Do you understand this, Miss Meredith? There is nothing written  here. The sheet is perfectly blank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  turned, stared, and laughed convulsively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blank,  do you say? What a fuss about nothing! No words, no words at all? Let me see. I  certainly expected you to find some final message in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  a change of manner! The moment before she had confronted us, a silent agonised  woman; now her words rattled forth with such feverish volubility we scarcely  knew her. The coroner, not noticing, or purposely blind to the relief she  showed, handed her the slip without a word. The brothers had all drawn off, and  for the first time began to whisper among themselves. As for myself, I did not  know what to do or think. My position, if anything, had changed for the worse.  I seemed to have played some trick. I wanted to beg her pardon and theirs, and  seeing her finally let the paper fall to the floor with an incredulous shake of  the head, I began to stammer out some words of explanation, which sounded weak  enough under the tension of suppressed excitement called forth in every breast  by this unexpected incident.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  feel&mdash;I am persuaded&mdash;you will not give me credit either for good sense or for  the sincerity of my desire to be of service to you,&rdquo; I made out to say. &ldquo;I  certainly thought from Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s actions, above all from the expressions  which accompanied them, that he had entrusted me with a communication of no  little importance, and that this communication was meant for Miss Meredith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To  my chagrin, my plea went unheeded: she was too absorbed in hiding her own  satisfaction at the turn affairs had taken, and her cousins in deciding to what  extent their position had been improved by the discovery of a blank sheet of  paper where all had expected to find words, and very important words, too.  Consequently it fell to Dr. Bennett to answer me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one can doubt your intentions, Mr. Outhwaite. Miss Meredith will be the first  to acknowledge her indebtedness to you when she comes to herself. You have  fulfilled your commission according to the dictates of your own conscience.  That you have failed to effect all you hoped for is not your fault. As a lawyer  you will rate the matter at its worth, and as a man of heart excuse the  exaggerated effect it has to all appearance produced upon those about you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a palpable dismissal, and I took it for such, or would have if Miss  Meredith, whose attention the word lawyer had seemingly caught, had not  honoured me with a look which held me rooted to the spot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;  she cried, &ldquo;I want to speak to that young man. Do not let him go yet.&rdquo; And  advancing, she stood before me in an attitude at once womanly and confiding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  back, Hope!&rdquo; I heard uttered in the peremptory tones of him they called  Leighton.</p>
  <p>But  though the spasm which passed over her face denoted what it cost her to disobey  the voice of so near a relative, she stood her ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  need a friend,&rdquo; she said to me. &ldquo;Someone who will stand by me and support me in  a task I may find myself too weak to accomplish unaided. I cannot have recourse  to my cousins. They are too closely connected with the sorrows brought upon us  all by this event. Besides, I find it easier to depend on a stranger,&mdash;one who  does not care for me, as Dr. Bennett does; a lawyer, too; I may need a lawyer&mdash;sir,  will you aid me with your counsels? I should find it hard to come upon another  man of such evident sincerity as yourself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hope!  Hope!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Entreaty  had now become command; Leighton even took a step towards her. She faltered,  but managed to murmur:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will not go till I have seen you again. You will not!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will not,&rdquo; I rejoined, putting down the hat I had caught up.</p>
  <p>The  next minute she, as well as myself, perceived why she had been thus  peremptorily called back.</p>
  <p>The  group around the newel-post had changed. A large, elderly man, with a world of  experience in his time-worn but kindly visage, was standing in the place  occupied by the coroner a moment before. He was bowing in the direction of Miss  Meredith, and he held some half-dozen letters in his hand.</p>
  <p>As  her eyes fell on these letters he regarded her with an encouraging smile, and  said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am Detective Gryce, miss. I ask pardon for disturbing you, and I don&rsquo;t want you  to lay too much stress upon my presence here or upon the few questions I have  to put on behalf of the coroner who has just been called to the telephone. A  few explanations are all I want, and some of these you are in a position to  give me. You have been in the habit of using the typewriter for your uncle, I  am told.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you use it for the writing of these five letters found upon his desk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  what hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Between  dinner time and half-past eight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was the first time she had acknowledged having seen her uncle after dinner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you were with him until half-past eight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  or thereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  left him in the enjoyment of his usual health?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  all appearance, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before  or after your cousin Leighton came into the study?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you leave? Was Mr. Gillespie through with his work for the night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know; I don&rsquo;t think so, but I was tired, and he begged me to go upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  his usual manner?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  like a man anxious to have you go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  when did the child come down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  immediately?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  a quarter of an hour or so later.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Humph!  The child was with him then a quarter of an hour before his death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose so; I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective waited a moment, then his hand closed over the letters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss,  it is very important to know whether Mr. Gillespie anticipated death. This  correspondence&mdash;you know it&mdash;a letter to Simpson &amp; Beals, Attorneys, Dubuque,  Iowa; another to Howard MacCartney, St. Augustine, Florida; this to the  president of the Santa F&eacute; Railroad; and this to Clarke, Beales &amp; Co.,  Nassau Street, City. All business letters, I presume?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Entirely  so, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  none of them, I judge, such as a man would write who expected to close all  accounts with the world in less than an hour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>How  laconic she was for a girl scarcely out of her teens!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  this correspondence, then, as you know it, he showed no intention of suicide?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the contrary. In one of those letters, the one to Clarke, Beales &amp; Co., I  think, he made an appointment for to-morrow. My uncle was very exact in business  matters. He would never have made this appointment if he had not hoped to keep  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you two in league?&rdquo; the angry voice of George broke in. &ldquo;Are you trying to make  out that father died from violence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  league?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Did  she say it or only look it? I felt my heart swell at her piteous, her agonised  expression. Mr. Gryce, as he called himself, may have seen it, but he appeared  to be looking at the slip of paper he now drew from his pocket, and which we  all recognised as that which she had shortly before let drop.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it looks like a piece of perfectly blank paper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it is,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Why he should send it to me I do not know. It was given  me in an envelope by the gentleman at the door, who says he got it from my  uncle before he died. Everyone here knows that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. Now let me ask from what sheet your uncle tore this scrap of paper? You  recognise it as paper you have seen before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O,  yes, it is part of what is used in the typewriter. At least I suppose it to be.  It looks like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sweetwater,  bring me the typewriter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  was the young man who had before shown himself in attendance on the coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O,  what does this mean?&rdquo; asked Hope, shrinking back.</p>
  <p>An  oath answered her. George had reached the end of his patience.</p>
  <p>The  placidity of the old man remained undisturbed.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  the young detective called Sweetwater had returned with the typewriter in his  arms. Setting it down on the library table, towards which they all immediately  moved, he composedly strolled my way. We were now grouped as follows: the  family and some others in the library, Sweetwater and myself at the front door.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700491h-images/page060.png" width="534" height="750"></p>
  <p>Naturally,  from the point I have just indicated, I could not look into the library; but my  hearing being good and that of the young detective still better, we both  managed to get the drift of what was being said, though we could not note the  speakers.</p>
  <p>I  had seen a slip of paper protruding from the machine when it was carried past  me, and it was to this piece of paper Mr. Gryce first called Miss Meredith&rsquo;s  attention.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  an unfinished letter here, as you see. Did you have a hand in writing it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  did not answer very promptly, but when she did, it was with a &ldquo;No&rdquo; which was  startlingly abrupt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  then there&rsquo;s someone else in the house who uses the typewriter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Gillespie. He often used it when he was in a hurry and I not by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Gillespie? Do you think it was he who wrote these lines?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do. There was no one else to do it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  my imagination too active, or had her voice a choked sound which spoke of some  latent emotion she strove to conceal?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  suavely responded the detective, &ldquo;we need no other proof of Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s  condition up to the time he worked off this last line. I doubt if you ever made  a better copy yourself, Miss Meredith. But why is it torn across in this  manner? Half of the sheet is missing, and some portion at least of the letter  is gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  sudden gasp which could have come from no other lips than hers was followed by  certain short exclamations from the others indicative of interest if not  surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I take it out? Or will one of you read it as it lies here? I prefer one of you  to read it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  heard a few stammering sentences uttered by George or Alfred, then Leighton&rsquo;s  voice broke in with the calm remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is about some shares lately purchased in Denver. If you think it necessary to  hear what my father had to say concerning them, this is a facsimile of what he  wrote a half-hour or so before he died:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700491h-images/page062.png" width="800" height="381"></p>
  <p>The  rest is torn off, as you say. Do you consider this letter important?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all, except as showing the sound condition of your father&rsquo;s mind immediately  prior to his collapse at ten o&rsquo;clock. It is not the letter itself which should  engage your attention, but the fact that this portion of it which has been  wrenched off cannot be found. I know,&rdquo; he went on, before a rejoinder could be  made by anyone in the startled group about him, &ldquo;that a strip seemingly of this  same paper was received by Miss Meredith in an envelope a few minutes ago. Indeed,  I have it here. But though it was evidently stripped from this same sheet&mdash;from  the bottom part of it, as you can see from its one straight edge&mdash;it does not  fit the portion left in the machine. Some two inches or so of the sheet is  lacking. Now where are these two inches? Not in the room from which we brought  the typewriter, nor yet on Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s person, for we have looked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one seems to answer,&rdquo; breathed a voice in my ear.</p>
  <p>Had  this shrewd and seemingly able detective expected a reply? I had not. Silence  had too often followed inquiry in this house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a loss open to explanation,&rdquo; mildly resumed the aged detective. &ldquo;It is also  one which the police deems important. We shall have to search for that  connecting slip of paper unless, as I sincerely hope, someone here present can  produce it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Search!&rdquo;  a commanding voice broke in&mdash;that of Leighton. &ldquo;We know nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a pity,&rdquo; rejoined the old man, with a mildness unusual in one of his class. &ldquo;Such  a measure should not be necessary. Someone here ought to be able to direct us  where to find this missing portion of a letter interrupted by so stern a fact  as the writer&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still  no answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  there been a fire in the room&mdash;but there was no fire. Or had Mr. Gillespie left  the room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Speak  out!&rdquo; the stern tones again enjoined. &ldquo;You think some of us took it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not say so,&rdquo; was the conciliatory reply. &ldquo;But this scrap must be found. Its  remarkable disappearance shows that it has more or less bearing on the mystery  of your father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we must entreat you to use your power and find it if you can.&rdquo; It was still  Leighton who was speaking. &ldquo;George, Alfred, let us accept the situation with  good grace; we will gain nothing by antagonising the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Two  muffled oaths answered him; their natures were more passionate than his, or  possibly less under control. But they offered no objections, and the next  minute the old detective appeared in the hall.</p>
  <p>One  look passed between him and the young man loitering at my side. Then the latter  turned to me:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is to be my task,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the house at all. I hear that  you have been up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From  whom could he have heard this? From Dr. Bennett? It was possible. Such fellows  worm themselves into the confidence of warier persons than this amiable old  physician.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have passed through the halls,&rdquo; I admitted, none too encouragingly. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t  see how that can help you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a four-story building, I suppose. All the houses along here are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it&rsquo;s a four-story house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  rubbed one hand awkwardly against the other; indeed, his whole manner was  awkward; then he walked slowly down the hall. When he reached the library door  he stopped and looked in with a shy and deprecating air. Suddenly he began to  back away. Someone was coming out. It was Miss Meredith. When she was in full  sight and he brought to a stand-still by the wall against which he had  retreated, he spoke, but not to her, though his eyes were fixed upon her in a  sort of blank stare she may have attributed to the power of her beauty, but  which I felt was of a character to make her careful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Four  stories!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Parlour floor, first bedroom floor, second bedroom  floor, and the attic! Where shall I begin? Ha! I think I know,&rdquo; he smiled, and  passed quickly down the hall.</p>
  <p>She  had given an involuntary pressure to her hands when he mentioned the word  attic.</p>
  <p>I  thought of the position in which I had found her there; of the doubts expressed  by the doctor as to how she could have received an intimation of her uncle&rsquo;s  death before an alarm had been raised or her cousins fully aroused, and felt  forced to acknowledge that the police were justified in their action, great as  was the spell cast over me by her loveliness.</p>
  <p>That,  justified or not, they meant to do their work, I soon saw. With a steady eye  the coroner held us all to our places, while the young detective disappeared  above, followed only by Leighton, who had asked the privilege of accompanying  him for fear of some alarm being given to his little child who was upstairs  alone. From the way Miss Meredith&rsquo;s eyes followed them, I knew there was  something to be feared from this quest which she alone had the power of  measuring.</p>
  <p>What  was I to think of this young girl who chose to be reticent on a subject  involving questions of life and death! I would not probe my doubts too closely.  I steeled myself against her look, resolving to be the lawyer&mdash;her lawyer&mdash;if  required, but nothing more, at least till these shadows were cleared up.</p>
  <p>Her  two cousins remained in the library, to which Mr. Gryce had returned after  making the signal to his man Sweetwater. We were all under great restraint with  the exception of the doctor, who was chatting confidentially with the coroner.  What he said I could in a measure gather from the expression of Miss Meredith&rsquo;s  face, who was nearer him than I. That it served to intensify rather than  relieve the situation was apparent from the gravity with which the coroner listened.  Later, some stray words reached me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  the greatest dread of poison&mdash;&rdquo; This I distinctly heard&mdash;&rdquo;Never took any medicine  without asking&mdash;&rdquo; I could not catch the rest. &ldquo;Tell him symptoms&mdash;all the poisons&mdash;like  a child&mdash;he <i>never</i> poisoned himself.&rdquo;  This last rung in my ears with persistent iteration. It rang so loud I thought  everyone on that floor must have heard it. But I saw no change in Alfred&rsquo;s  restless figure hovering on the threshold of the library door a few feet behind  Miss Meredith; while George, conversing feverishly with Mr. Gryce, raised his  voice rather than dropped it as these fatal words fell from the lips of one who  certainly had the best of reasons for believing himself in the confidence of  his patient.</p>
  <p>Miss  Meredith, who was listening to something besides this conversation, fateful as  it was, was meanwhile schooling herself for Sweetwater&rsquo;s return. I could  discern this by the change that passed over her face just when his steps began  to be heard; and was conscious of quite a personal shock when I saw her hand  fall involuntarily on her bosom as if the thing he sought was <i>there</i> and not in the rooms above.</p>
  <p>Cursing  myself for the infatuation which would not let my eyes leave her face, I turned  with sudden impulse into the reception room opening on my right. But I speedily  stepped back again. Miss Meredith, who seemed to have gained some confidence by  my presence, had feebly uttered my name. It seemed that the child had been  heard to cry above, and that the coroner had refused to let her go up.</p>
  <p>I  made my way to her side, and, despite Alfred&rsquo;s scowls, entered into conversation  with her, urging her to be calm and wait patiently for the detective&rsquo;s return.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  child has its father,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
  <p>But  this did not seem to afford her much comfort. She wrung her hands in her  anxiety, and showed no relief till her cousin, followed by the watchful  detective, was again seen on the stairs.</p>
  <p>Then  she took my arm. She needed it, for life and death were in the gaze she fixed  upon the latter. And he&mdash;well, I had never seen the man before that night; yet I  felt as certain from the way his feet fell on the stairs he so slowly descended  that he had been successful in his search, and that the piece of paper which  rustled so gently in his hand was the one Mr. Gryce had declared to be of such  importance, and which she&mdash;but what man can complete a thought suggestive of  distrust, while the hand of its lovely object presses warmly on his arm, and  the eyes whose glance he both fears and loves rest upon his in a confidence  which in itself is a rebuke?</p>
  <p>I  gave up speculation and devoted myself to sustaining Miss Meredith in her  present ordeal. As Sweetwater reached the last step she murmured these words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tried; but fate has rebuked me. Now I see my duty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  eyes had not followed Leighton&rsquo;s figure as he joined his brothers in the  library, but mine did, and it did not make my heart any lighter to see from the  glance he tossed her on entering that he was prepared for some event serious  enough to warrant all this emotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have found what you have sought!&rdquo; she cried, intercepting the young detective  in her anxiety to end the suspense it took all her strength to sustain.</p>
  <p>His  smile was dubious, but it was a smile. Meantime the paper he held had found its  way into the coroner&rsquo;s hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call  Gryce!&rdquo; shouted out that functionary, with a doubtful look at the slip in his  hand; &ldquo;I shall need his experience in deciphering this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective was at his side in an instant, and together they bent over the scrap.  The suspense was great, and the moment well-nigh intolerable. Then we saw the  detective&rsquo;s finger rest on a certain portion of the paper they were mutually  consulting, and remain there. The coroner read the words thus indicated, and  his face showed both strong and sudden feeling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  he ejaculated. &ldquo;What do you make out of that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  detective uttered a few low words, and taking the piece which had been in the  envelope he fitted it to the one held by the coroner. We could all see that  they were part of the same sheet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like to see if it also fits the portion that was left in the typewriter,&rdquo;  suggested the other, ignoring the anxious looks bent upon him from every side.  Passing by us all, he laid the three pieces together on the library table with  a glance at the young Gillespies which was not without its element of  compassion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us see it. What&rsquo;s on it?&rdquo; urged Alfred. &ldquo;Why, this is worse than father&rsquo;s  death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  Miss Meredith will tell me how this central portion came to be on the attic  floor, I will presently oblige you,&rdquo; rejoined the coroner.</p>
  <p>She  who of all present showed no interest in the completed sheet answered  instantly, and without any further attempt at subterfuge or denial:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  carried it there. I had come upon my uncle lying dead in his study, and  thinking, fearing, that he had been struck while at the typewriter, I flew to  the latter, and, lifting up the carriage, consulted the letter attached to it  for some indication of this, and saw&mdash;George, Leighton, Alfred,&rdquo; she vehemently  cried, facing them with a look before which each proud and spirited head sank  in turn, &ldquo;I do not know upon which of your three souls the weight of this crime  rests. But one of you, one, I say, lies under the ban of your father&rsquo;s denunciation.  Read!&rdquo; And her trembling finger crossed that of the detective and fell upon a  line terminating the half-finished letter which they had already partially  read.</p>
  <p>This  was the appearance of that letter as now presented:</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700491h-images/page070.png" width="800" height="508"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those  last words were written after he felt himself sinking under the poison,&rdquo; rang  out in instinctive emphasis from her lips. &ldquo;Contradict me, George! Contradict  me, Leighton! or you, Alfred, if you can! It would give me new life. It would  restore me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was sinking, fainting, almost at the point of death herself, but not a voice  was lifted, not a hand raised. This suggestion of crime had robbed them, one  and all, of breath, almost of life.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
    The Man Behind The Screen</b></h2>
  <p>Suddenly  one voice rang out in passionate protest. &ldquo;Hope! Hope! It was not I! It was not  I!&rdquo; And Alfred, leaving his brothers, stood before his young cousin, with  self-forgetful gestures expressing a denial which was half-prayer.</p>
  <p>George  flushed, and his fist rose; Leighton drooped his head in shame&mdash;or was it  sorrow; but the next minute he had that rebellious fist in his own clutch. Miss  Meredith kept her eyes turned sedulously away from them all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  only want one of you to speak; the man who can exonerate his brothers by  confessing his own guilt. Do not touch me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  to Alfred, whose hand had caught hold of her dress.</p>
  <p>With  an air of pride, the first I had seen in him, the youngest son of Mr. Gillespie  withdrew from her side and took up his stand on the farther side of the hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are quick with your suspicions,&rdquo; he flashed out. &ldquo;What sort of men do you think  us, that you should allow an incoherent phrase like this at the end of a letter  begun in health but finished in agony, prejudice you to the death against  persons of your own blood? It would take more than that to make me think evil  of you, Hope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a natural reproach, and it told not only upon her, but upon us all. The  words which had precipitated this situation might mean much and might mean  little. Had the reputation of these young men been of a more stable character,  or had no attempt been made to suppress this portion of the letter, suspicion  would never have followed the discovery of this incongruous addition to the  half-finished business letter found in the typewriter; &ldquo;one of my sons he&rdquo;&mdash;was  that an accusation of crime? George and Leighton were on the point of asserting  not, and Alfred had just begun to swagger with an air of injured pride, when  Miss Meredith, recovering herself, laid her hand upon her bosom in repetition  of her former action, and slowly drew forth a letter, the appearance of which  evidently produced a new and still greater shock in the breasts of the three  young men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall not try to vindicate myself,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I have lived like a sister in  this house, and you would have a right to reproach me if it were not for what I  hold here. Alfred, you have complained that the few words left in the  typewriter by your dying father were incoherent and unsatisfactory. Will you  regard as equally meaningless this letter written four weeks ago? Sir,&rdquo;&mdash;here  she turned to the coroner,&mdash;&rdquo;my uncle was ill a month ago. It was not a  dangerous illness, but the remedies given&mdash;Oh! Dr. Bennett help me to say it&mdash;were  remedies we all knew to be dangerous if taken in too great quantities. One night&mdash;I  cannot go on&mdash;he had reason to think his glass was tampered with, and after  that, he wrote this letter, and charged me with its delivery in case he&mdash;he&mdash;Ah!  I need not say in case of what. You have seen his dear head lying low in the  room over there. Only,&mdash;as this letter is addressed to my cousins conjointly,  will you allow them to read it without witnesses if they will swear to respect  it and restore it in an un-mutilated condition to your hands? It is the only favour  I ask you to show them, and this I humbly entreat you to grant, if only in  recognition of what I have suffered at having precipitated this horror when I  only meant to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was sinking&mdash;falling&mdash;nay, almost at the point of death herself. But she reached  out the letter, and the coroner, giving it one glance, handed it over to  Leighton as the one least shaken by the calamity which had just overwhelmed the  house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  forbid that I should deny to sons the privilege of being the first to read the  last letter addressed them by their father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  he made no move towards drawing the curtain between himself and the room from  which he was retreating, nor could he be said to have really taken his eye off  any of them during the reading of this long letter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see I had need of a friend,&rdquo; murmured Miss Meredith, swaying towards me.</p>
  <p>I  gave her a commiserating look. Was ever a girl more unfortunately situated? Two  at least of the men against whom she had felt forced to utter this denunciation  of crime, loved her (or so I believed), Alfred passionately, George with less  show of feeling, but possibly with fully as much depth and fervour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  might have held the letter back,&rdquo; I whispered.</p>
  <p>But  she met me with a noble look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean if I have not drawn suspicion upon them by my first subterfuge. But with  so much in their disfavour, how could I calculate upon another opportunity of  seeing them all together. And they must read it together. So my uncle told me.  But he never thought it would be with police-officers in the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  the coroner advanced to question her, and I am happy to say that my presence  gave her courage to bear up under the ordeal. This was what he elicited from  her.</p>
  <p>She  did not know what was in the letter. It had been written by her uncle while  still on his sick bed and after an experience which I will not relate here, as  it will be found more fully stated in the letter itself. This letter I will  reproduce for you at once, though it was weeks before I knew its whole  contents:</p>
  <p>GEORGE,  LEIGHTON, AND ALFRED:</p>
  <p>I  may not have been a good father, but I have at least been a just one. Though  each and all of you since coming to man&rsquo;s estate have given me great cause for  complaint, I have never been harsh towards you, nor have I ever denied you  anything from mere caprice or from an egotistic desire to save myself trouble.  Yet to one of you my life is of so little value that he is willing to resort to  crime to rid himself of me. Does this shock you, Leighton, George, Alfred? We  are a Christian family, members of an honourable community, trained each and  all in religious principles, you, by the best, the sweetest of mothers&mdash;does it  move you to think that one of you could contemplate parricide and even attempt it?  It moves me; and in two of you must awaken a horror, the anticipation of which  affords me the sole comfort now remaining to my doomed and miserable life. For  nothing will ever make me believe that this act was a concerted one or that the  attempt which has just been made upon my life had its birth in more than one  dark breast. One guilty soul there is among you, but only one; and lest to the  remaining two the accusation I have just made may seem fanciful, unreal, the  result of nightmare or the effect of fever, I will relate what happened in this  room last night, just as I related it to Hope when she asked me this morning  why I seemed so loath to see you before you went out to your several lounging  places.</p>
  <p>I  was dozing. The lamp which since my illness has never been turned out in my  room, threw great shadows on wall and ceiling. I seemed conscious of these  shadows, though I was half asleep, but not so conscious that I was not aware of  the light shining through the transom from the gas jet near the top of the  stairs. This light has always been company for me, especially in wakeful nights  or when I found myself troubled by dreams or any physical distress. It seemed  to connect me with the rest of the house, and simple as it may seem to you,  accounts for the cheerfulness with which I have declined the offers of my sons  to sit with me during these last painful nights. I had no need of their company  while this light shone; and as for pain&mdash;why, that is an evil which all men are  called upon sooner or later to endure.</p>
  <p>I  was resting then, in this mild reflected light, when suddenly it went out. This  woke me, for the orders are strict that this jet be left burning till the  servants come downstairs in the morning. But I did not stir in my bed; I simply  listened. Though aroused and somewhat disturbed by this palpable disregard of  my wishes, I exerted all of my faculties to detect the step I now heard  loitering about my door. But it was studiously cautious and made no distinct sound  in my ear. I did not like this, and listened still more intently, whereupon I  heard the door open and someone come in, softly, and with long pauses such as  were not wont to accompany the entrance of any member of my household. I was  deciding whether to raise an alarm or lie still and let myself be robbed of the  money which I had just received from the bank, when I heard the whispered &ldquo;Father&rdquo;  with which one and all of you approach me at night when you wish to ascertain  if I am asleep or awake.</p>
  <p>Why  did I hear myself called and yet make no reply? What was in my heart, or what  have I seen of late in your natures or conduct, that I should remain quiet  under this appeal and lie there shut-eyed and watchful? I had no definite  reason for doubting any of you. I knew you were in debt and that two of you at  least were in crying need of money, but I hardly think I dreaded the rifling of  my desk by the hands of one of my sons. Yet that approach so gentle and so measured!  the drawn-in breath! the shadow that grew and grew upon the wall!&mdash;all these  spoke of something quite different from the anxiety of a son keeping watch over  a sick father&rsquo;s slumbers.</p>
  <p>The  desk was near the window towards which my eyes were turned in open  watchfulness, and I hoped by lying still to catch sight of the intruder&rsquo;s  figure at the moment of his passing between me and the faint illumination made  on the curtains by the street lamp opposite. But the intruder did not advance  in that direction. He passed instead to the little cupboard over the  wash-stand, where, as you all know, my medicines are kept. This I was made  aware of by the faint click made by one bottle striking another. &ldquo;George has  come home ill, or Leighton has one of his terrible headaches,&rdquo; was the soothing  thought which then came to me, and I found it difficult not to speak out and  ask who was sick and what bottle was wanted. But the something which from the  first had acted in the way of restraint upon me, held me still, and I remained  dumb while that sneaking hand continued to fumble among the phials and glasses.  Suddenly a fear struck me, a fear so far removed from any which I had ever  before known, that my whole attitude of thought towards my sons must have  undergone an instantaneous change&mdash;a gulf opening where an instant before was  confidence and love. The medicine was kept there from which my nightly dose was  prepared; a medicine which you have all heard declared by my physician to be a  deadly poison, which must be measured most carefully and given in only such  doses as he had prescribed. Could it be that my son was feeling about for this?  Had George bet once too often on that mare which will be his ruin, or Leighton  found his religion an insufficient cloak for indiscretions which ever shunned  the light of day; or Alfred&mdash;the child of my heart, he whom his dying mother placed  as a last trust in my arms&mdash;confounded the <i>ennui</i> of inaction with that weariness of life which is the bane of rich men&rsquo;s sons? I  know the despairs that come in youth, and I quaked where I lay; but it was not  upon self-destruction that this man at the cupboard was bent. I felt my whole frame  tremble and my heart sink in unutterable despair as he advanced, still quietly  and with great pauses, up to the foot-board of my bed, then around to the side,  protected, as you know, by a screen, till he crouched out of sight, but within  reach of the small table where my glass stands with the spoon beside it, ready  for my use if I grow restless and weary.</p>
  <p>To  have turned, to have intercepted the creeping figure in its work, and thus have  known definitely and forever which one of you had thus furtively visited my  medicine cabinet before proceeding to my bedside, might have been the natural course  with some; but it was not my course. I was not content just to interrupt. I  wanted to know the full extent of what I had to fear. A remark which Dr.  Bennett had once let fall recurred to me, transfixing me to my bed. &ldquo;If you were  not a careful man,&rdquo; he had said in diagnosing my present illness, &ldquo;I should say  that you had taken something foreign into your system; something which has no  business there; something which under other circumstances and in another man&rsquo;s  case I should denominate <i>poison</i>.&rdquo; It  had seemed nonsense to me at the time, and I laughed at what I considered a  fatuous remark, uttered with unnecessary gravity; but now that there was really  poison in the house, and one of my own blood stood hiding behind the screen within  a foot of my medicine glass, I could not but choke down the cry which this  thought caused to rise in my throat and listen for what might come. Alas! I was  destined to behold with my eyes as well as hear with my ears the next move made  by my unknown visitant. By the grace of God or through some coincidence equally  providential, the gas at this momentous instant was relit in the hall, and I perceived,  amid the old shadows thus called out upon the wall, a new one&mdash;that of a hand  holding a bottle, which, projecting itself beyond the straight line cast by the  screen, was now stealing slowly but surely in the direction of the table on  which stood my glass of medicine. I did not gasp or cry. Thought, feeling,  consciousness even of my own unfathomable misery seemed lost in the one  instinct&mdash;to watch that hand. Would it falter? Should I see it tremble or hesitate  in its short passage across the faintly illumined space upon which my eyes were  fixed? Yes, some monition of conscience, some secret fear or filial remembrance  made it pause for an instant; but even as my heart bounded in glad relief and  human feelings began to re-awake in my frozen breast, it steadied and passed  on, and though I could no longer see aught but a shadowy arm, I could hear one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;a  dozen drops falling into my drink&mdash;a sound which, faint as it was, made the  guilty heart behind the screen quake; for the hand shook as it retreated, and I  beheld distinctly outlined on the illumined space before me the end of the  semi-detached label which marked the special bottle on which the word <i>poison</i> is printed in large letters.</p>
  <p>No  further doubt was possible. The medicine in my glass had been strengthened and  by the hand of one of my sons.</p>
  <p>Which  one?</p>
  <p>In  the misery of the moment I felt as if I did not care. That any of you should  seek my death was an overwhelming grief to me. But as thought and reason  returned, the wild desire to know just what and whom I had to fear seized me in  the midst of my horror, mixed with another sentiment harder to explain, and  which I can best characterise as a feeling of dread lest I should betray my  suspicions and so raise between my children and myself an insurmountable  barrier.</p>
  <p>Subduing  my emotion and summoning to my aid all the powers of acting with which I have  been by nature endowed, I moved restlessly under the clothes, calling out in a  sort of sleepy alarm:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s  there? Is it you, George? If so, reach me my medicine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  no George stepped forth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leighton?&rdquo;  I cried petulantly. &ldquo;Surely I hear one of you in the room.&rdquo; But my son Leighton  did not reply.</p>
  <p>I  did not call for Alfred. I could not! He was the last son of his mother.</p>
  <p>Did  I wrong the others in not uttering his name also?</p>
  <p>Meantime  all was quiet behind the screen. Then I heard a quick movement, followed by the  shutting of a door, and I realised that an escape had been effected from the  room in a way I had not calculated on&mdash;that is, by means of the dressing-room  opening out of the alcove in which my bed stands.</p>
  <p>I  had thought myself a weak man up to that hour; but when I heard that door  close, I bounded to my feet and attempted to reach the hall before the man who  had thus escaped me could find refuge in any of the adjoining rooms. But I must  have fallen insensible almost immediately, for when I came to myself I found  the foot-board of the bed within reach of my hand, and the clock on the point  of striking two.</p>
  <p>I  dragged myself up and staggered back to bed. I had neither the courage nor the  strength to push the matter further at that time. Indeed, I felt a sort of  physical fear, probably the result of illness, which made it quite impossible  for me to traverse the halls and creep from room to room seeking for guilt in  eyes whose expression up to this unhallowed hour had betrayed nothing worse  than a reckless disregard of my wishes.</p>
  <p>Yet  it was torment unspeakable to lie there in an uncertainty which threw a cloud  over all my sons. For hours my thoughts ran the one gamut, George, Leighton,  Alfred, clinging agonisedly to each beloved name in turn, only to drop into a  dreadful uncertainty as I remembered the temptations besetting each one of you,  and the readiness with which you all, from the oldest to the youngest, have ever  succumbed to them. There was no determining point in the character of any of  you which made me able to say in this solitary and awful communion with my own  fears, &ldquo;This one at least is innocent!&rdquo; If I dwelt on George&rsquo;s generous good  nature, I also recalled his wild extravagance and the debts he so recklessly  heaps up at every turn he makes in this God-forsaken city; if some recollection  of Leighton&rsquo;s strict ways in open matters of conscience came to soothe me, there  instantly came with it the remembrance of the various tales which had reached  my ears of certain secret attachments which drew him into circles where crime  is more than a suggestion, and murder a possible attendant upon every feast.  Then Alfred&mdash;youngest of all but the least youthful in his attitude towards the  world and his fellow-men&mdash;what honourable ambition had he ever shown calculated  to give me solace at this awful time, and make the association of his name with  a damnable crime an impossibility and an outrage?</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  my whole mental vision was clouded with the pictured remembrances of your faces  as seen in childhood, in early youth, or at any other time, indeed, than the intolerable  present. George&rsquo;s, when he brought home his first school medal; Leighton&rsquo;s,  when he denied himself a new pair of skates that he might give the money to a  crying street urchin; Alfred&rsquo;s, when the fever left him and his cheeks grew  rosy again with renewed health. All these young and innocent faces crowded  about me, awakening poignant suggestions of the change which a few short, short  years had wrought in relations which once seemed warm and alive with promise.  Then, a group of frank-eyed boys; now,&mdash;this awful question: <i>which?</i></p>
  <p>It  was not till an hour had passed that I remembered that the phial had not been  returned to the cabinet. In whose possession would it be found? Should I have a  search made for it? I turned cold in bed at the debasing, the intolerable  prospect of acting as detective in my own house. Then the poisoned glass! it  still stood beside me; if I left it untouched it would show suspicion on my  part, and suspicion might precipitate my doom. How could I avoid taking it  without raising doubts as to my discovery of the trick which had been played so  near me? In the feverish condition of my mind but one plan suggested itself.  Throwing out my arm, I precipitated the glass to the floor, over which I heard  it roll, with extraordinary sensations. Then I waited for daybreak, in much the  same condition of mind in which a man awaits his last hour; for my heart  yearned over my sons even while panting under the consciousness that one of  them was a monster of ingratitude and innate depravity.</p>
  <p>When  Hewson and the girls came down, and I heard the stir of life in the house, I  rang my bell and asked for Hope. She came in with beaming face and a smile full  of happiness. She had risen from a beauty sleep and, possibly because my thoughts  had been so dark, I had never seen her look so bright and lovely. But her  cheeks paled as she approached my bedside and noticed my miserable appearance;  and it was with sudden anxiety she cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a wretched night you must have had, uncle! You look poorly this morning. You  should have sent for me before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  I summoned up all my powers of acting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knocked over my medicine in the night. Perhaps that is why I look so wretched.  I did not sleep after four. You can say so, if any of the boys ask after me at  the breakfast table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a woman&rsquo;s solicitude she moved around to my side, where the screen stood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; she exclaimed, stooping as her foot encountered some small  object.</p>
  <p>I  expected her to lift the glass. Instead of that she lifted the bottle. It had  been left there on the floor and not carried out of the room, as I had  naturally supposed.</p>
  <p>I  endeavoured to look undisturbed and as if this bottle had been thrown over with  the glass, but I failed pitiably. At the sight of her dear, womanly face and  the affection beaming in every look, I broke down and raised my arms imploringly  towards her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  to my arms!&rdquo; I prayed. &ldquo;Let me feel one true head on my breast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  next minute I was conscious of having said a word too much. Her look, which you  all know and love, changed, and, while she submitted to my caresses and even  warmly returned them, it was with an appearance of doubt which I almost cursed  myself for having roused in that innocent breast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  one true heart?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Are there not others in this house? George and  Alfred love you devotedly; and little Claire&mdash;what child could show more  fondness for a grandfather than she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Why  had she not included Leighton?</p>
  <p>I  endeavoured to right myself with some mechanical phrase or other, but the  attempt was not very successful, and she was leaving the room in great  disturbance when I called her hurriedly back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want you to smile as usual,&rdquo; I gravely enjoined. &ldquo;George&rsquo;s extravagances and  Alfred&rsquo;s caprices are no new story to you. I have been thinking about them,  that is all, but I had rather they did not know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  could not mention Leighton&rsquo;s name, either.</p>
  <p>Meantime  she was standing there with the poison bottle in her hand. I could not bear to  look at it, and motioned her to restore it to the cabinet. As she did so, I  perceived her turn with half-open lips, as if about to ask some question. But  she either lacked the courage or the will to do so, for she proceeded to the  cabinet with the bottle, which she placed quietly on the shelf. But almost  instantly she took it up again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  uncle,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;there is not as much here as there ought to be! I am sure  the bottle was half full last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  then I remembered it was she who prepared my medicine for me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I left it on the shelf,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Uncle, how came it to be lying by the side  of your bed? Did you try to strengthen the dose? You know you ought not to; Dr.  Bennett said that three drops in half a glass of water were all you could take  with safety.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had not a word to say. My mind seemed a blank, and no excuse presented itself.  The wish which I had openly cherished of seeing Hope married to one of my sons  clogged my faculties. My protest confined itself to a slow shake of the head  and a dubious smile she was far from understanding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I will stay with you,&rdquo; she gently suggested. &ldquo;Nellie will bring my  breakfast up with yours, and we can have a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te </i>meal at your bedside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  this did not chime in with my plans.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said I. &ldquo;Nellie can stay with me if you wish, but I want you to go down. Your  cousins will miss you if you are not there to pour the coffee for them. Alfred  shows an astonishing punctuality of late, and George quite emulates his younger  brother&rsquo;s precision and haste. Leighton was never late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  cheek grew the colour of a rose. Never before had I so much as suggested to her  the secret wish you have one and all entertained ever since her beauty and  affectionate nature brought sunshine into this cold dwelling.</p>
  <p>I  was glad to see this colour; at the same time I was made poignantly wretched by  what it suggested. If Hope loved one of my sons, and he should be the one who  had&mdash;I felt more than ever called upon to act warily. Here was someone besides  myself to think of. Your mother is dead and in Paradise, but Hope is young and  the crushing weight under which I staggered could not well be borne by her. For  her sake if not for my own, I must locate the plague-spot that to my mind  spread defilement over all my sons. I must know which of you to trust and which  to fear; and that no mistake should follow my attempt at this, I made haste to  insure that no warning should reach you through any change in Hope&rsquo;s manner. So  I reiterated my old command.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me see you smile,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or I shall think you regard me as being in worse  condition than I really am. Indeed, I am almost well, Hope. My disease has  yielded to Dr. Bennett&rsquo;s treatment, and when I can rise above these sickly fancies,  which are the effect, no doubt, of the powerful remedies I have taken, I shall  be quite like my old self. After breakfast let me see you here again. I may  have some letters requiring an immediate answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  natural tones reassured her. The force of my feelings had brought some colour  into my cheeks, and I probably looked less ghastly. She turned away with a  smile. Alas! her face renewed its brightness and shone with sweet expectancy as  she approached the door.</p>
  <p>Nellie  brought me my breakfast and I forced myself to eat it. My mind was regaining  its equilibrium and my will its power. Just as I was folding my napkin, Hewson  came in. He had brought me an especial tid-bit, prepared in the chafing dish by  Hope&rsquo;s own hands. But I could not eat it. The thought would rise that she had  seen far enough into my mind to imagine I would dread eating anything she had  not cooked for me herself. As Hewson was withdrawing, I asked if you were all  well. His answer was an astonished Yes. At which I ventured to remark that I  had heard someone up in the night. &ldquo;That was Miss Meredith,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I  heard her tell Mr. George at the breakfast table that she came down to your door  about one in the morning to listen if you were quiet. She said she found the  gas blown out in the hall, and that she lit it again. I had left the sky-light  open; it don&rsquo;t do these windy nights, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was disturbed by this discovery. That she should have been at the door at a  moment so fraught with danger and misery to myself was a thrilling thought;  besides, might she not have been so happy or so unhappy as to have caught a  glimpse of the man who crept out of my dressing-closet a moment later! Overcome  by a possibility which might settle the whole question for me, I let Hewson go  in silence; and when Hope came back, drew her gently but resolutely down on the  bed at my side and said to her with a smile:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have just learned how my dear girl watches over her uncle&rsquo;s slumbers. You are  too careful of me; I had rather have you sleep. George&rsquo;s room is on this floor;  let him come and see how I am in the night, if you are so uneasy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;George  would never wake up without assistance,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I could not trust you to  his tender care, well meaning as he is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leighton,  then. He&rsquo;s a light sleeper. I have often heard you say that you have heard him  pacing the floor of his room as late as three in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he sleeps better now. Alfred might stop on his way in; but Alfred does not stay  out as late as he used to. He comes in quite regularly since you have been ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Were  her eyes quite true? Yes, they were as true as the sky they mirror. I grasped  her hand and ventured upon a vital question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  was up at the same time you were last night? I am sure I heard a man&rsquo;s step in  the hall, just about the time you relighted the gas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you know about the gas?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I found it smelling dreadfully. But I didn&rsquo;t  encounter anyone in the hall. I guess you imagined that, uncle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo;  was my muttered reply, as I wondered how I was to ask the next question. &ldquo;When  did you go upstairs?&rdquo; I finally inquired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  right away. I didn&rsquo;t wait a minute after I found you quiet. It was cold in the  halls&mdash;Hewson had left the sky-light open, and my trip after a match chilled me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  your cousin Leighton&rsquo;s door open?&rdquo; I instantly inquired. &ldquo;Or did you hear any  door shut after you went up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  leaned over me and looked anxiously into my face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you ask so many questions, uncle, and in so hard a voice? Would there have  been any harm in my cousins being up, or in my running across one of them in  the hall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  ordinarily. But last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="letter">Here  my weakness found vent. I must share my secret, if only as a safeguard; I could  not breathe under the dreadful weight imposed upon me by this uncertainty. And  she knew I had some dreadful tale to tell; this I was assured of by the white  line creeping into view about her lips, and by the convulsive clasp with which  she answered my clutch. Forgetting her youth, ignoring all the resolves I had  made in the secret watches of the night, I drew her ear down to my mouth and  gasped into it the few tell-tale sentences which revealed the dishonour of our  house. I caught the thrill of anguish which went through her as I made plain the  attempt which had been made upon my life, and never shall I forget her eyes as  she slowly drew back at the completion of my tale, and surveyed me in the  silent suspense which seemed to mirror forth my own deep heart-question: <i>Which?</i></p>
  <p class="letter">Sons,  I could not answer the demand made by that look, nor can I answer it now. You  all came in soon after, and each and all of you had something to say about the  mischance of the night which had so visibly affected me. And I did not dare to  read your eyes. Brought face to face with you, I seemed to shrink from, rather  than seek for, the settling of this dreadful question. Perhaps because I regard  you with equal affection. Perhaps because your mother&rsquo;s picture was visible  over your heads, and it seemed like sacrilege to her memory to consider such a  question under her loving and trusting eyes. At all events you left me with my  mind still in doubt, to confront Hope again, and with her the wretched future  which the night&rsquo;s experience had unfolded before us both. I found her filled  with a confidence I could not easily share. She believed in the integrity of  the man she held dearest, but she would not tell me which of you she thus  loved. And I could only guess. But even this belief weakened a little as we  talked together, and I soon saw by the arguments she used that peace and  certainty would never be hers again as long as a doubt remained as to which of  her cousins had conceived and perpetrated this criminal act. As for me, the  future holds no comfort. I shall give each of you a thousand dollars to-night  in celebration of my anniversary of marriage, and perhaps this will awaken the conscience  of the one who loves my money better than my life. Then, though I shall not  change my will, I shall publish abroad that I have had losses which only a  fortunate speculation can make good, and see if by these means the cupidity  which came near costing me my life may not serve to insure me a sufficiently  prolonged existence for me to separate in my own mind the one black sheep from  the white. But if these measures fail, if I am doomed to fall a victim to the  unknown hand which I must henceforth see lifted over my life, if Hope&rsquo;s  watchfulness and my own vigilance cannot prevent the repetition of an act which,  if once determined upon, cannot fail of fulfilment in a house like this, then this  letter read by you all in concert must prove the punishment of the guilty one.  And since none of you will read these lines except under these circumstances of  death and crime, I hereby charge that guilty one to speak, and as he hopes to  escape my curse and the wrath of an outraged Deity, to avow his crime in her  presence and in that of the two brothers he will thus exonerate.</p>
  <p class="letter">Having  done this, he may take or leave his portion of the estate. I shall be  satisfied, and the God whose commandments he has doubly defied may forget to  avenge a crime forgiven by its object.</p>
  <p class="letter">To  my two sons whose filial instincts have never been thus disturbed, I leave my  blessing. May all happiness be theirs, whether this does or does not include  the love of the dear girl whose future I have thus endeavoured to clear.</p>
  <p class="letter">ARCHIBALD  GILLESPIE.</p>
  <p>I  have inserted this letter here that you may understand the situation which  ensued upon its perusal by the three brothers.</p>
  <p>We,  who had not read it, were simply startled to note the way in which these three  young men drew back as from a common centre, as the last words fell from  Leighton&rsquo;s well-nigh paralysed lips.</p>
  <p>Then  Alfred, in a rush of ferocious passion, bounded forward again, and striding up  to George, shouted out in an awful voice, &ldquo;<i>You</i> are the man!&rdquo; and struck him without mercy to the floor.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
    The Clock That Had Run Down</b></h2>
  <p>In  the commotion which followed, I noted two things. First, that at sight of this  violence from one brother to the other, Leighton drew back without offering  assistance to the one or rebuke to the other. Secondly, that Alfred&rsquo;s show of  anger ceased as soon as it had thus expended itself, and that his next thought  was for Hope.</p>
  <p>But  he was not allowed to approach her. The coroner now interfered with his  authority, and all words were forbidden between these members of a disrupted  household, till the police had finished an investigation, which had now become  as serious as the crime which had called it forth.</p>
  <p>The  search was for the little phial which had held the acid, and when it was  generally understood that the investigation would not cease till this was  found, Miss Meredith, who had clung to me as her one stay in this overturning  of every other natural support, asked me in agitated tones if I thought her  cousins would be subjected to personal search. As no other course was open to  the police after the direct accusation which had just been made by the  infuriated Alfred, I answered in the affirmative; whereupon she attempted to  flee the place, saying she could not endure to see them subjected to such humiliation.</p>
  <p>But  here Alfred, as if divining her thoughts, offered his person to Mr. Gryce with  the remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have nothing to conceal. Look through my pockets, if you wish. You will find  nothing to reward your pains. <i>I</i> am  not the villain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  growl of anger, bridled but concentrated, came from the other side of the room,  and I caught a sudden glimpse of George, quivering under the restraining hands  of Dr. Bennett and Sweetwater, in a mad attempt to reach his brother, whom he  seemed to curse between his teeth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you search him, you must do the same to me,&rdquo; were the words with which he  seasoned this struggle. &ldquo;You will find nothing more incriminating on me than on  him; probably less, for my pockets are always open&mdash;while his&mdash;&rdquo; A gnash of his  teeth finished these almost inarticulate phrases. He was not as easily roused  as his brother, but more tenacious in his passions, and less readily appeased.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Peace,  there! You shall both be satisfied,&rdquo; interposed a businesslike voice. In face  of these open accusations, the coroner felt himself relieved from the  embarrassment which had hitherto restrained him, and made no further effort to  hide his suspicions.</p>
  <p>Miss  Meredith, who unconsciously to herself had drawn me as far as the drawing-room  door in her efforts to escape the disquieting scene she had herself  precipitated, paused as these words left the coroner&rsquo;s lips, and, yielding to  the terrible fascination of the moment, caught my arm, and clinging thus with  both hands, turned her eyes again upon the men under whose roof she had eaten,  slept, and loved; ay, loved, as I knew by the tension of her body, communicated  to me by the pressure of her hands.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  that pressure was removed. Her hands had flown to her eyes, shutting out the  spectacle she could no longer confront. Nor was it easy for me to look on  unmoved, or view with even an appearance of equanimity the scene before me.</p>
  <p>I  have not mentioned Leighton. He had not come forward with the other two, but he  allowed his pockets to be searched without a protest when his turn came, though  it was very evident that the proceeding caused him more suffering and a keener  sensation of disgrace than it did the other two. Was this on account of the  superior sensitiveness of his nature, or because he shrunk with a proud man&rsquo;s  shame from the publicity entailed upon the anomalous articles which were drawn  from his inner pockets? When some few minutes later my eyes fell on these objects  lying piled on the library table, I marvelled over the character of a man who  could gather and retain in one place a small prayer-book, a lock of woman&rsquo;s  hair, the programme of some common music hall, and a photograph which after one  glance I instinctively turned face downwards, lest it should fall under the eye  of his cousin, whose delicacy could not fail to be hurt by it.</p>
  <p>The  phial had not been found on any of the young gentlemen.</p>
  <p>When  Miss Meredith became aware that the ordeal was over, she let her hands drop,  and stepped hastily into the drawing-room. I did not follow her, but remained  in the doorway watching the detectives as they moved from room to room in the  search which was now being extended to all parts of the house. As I saw these  men pass so quietly but with such an air of authority into rooms where a few  hours before they would have hesitated to put foot even upon the genial owner&rsquo;s  express invitation, I experienced such a realisation of the abyss into which  this hitherto well-reputed family had fallen that I lost for a little while  that sense of personal bitterness which the predictions evinced by Miss  Meredith had so selfishly awakened.</p>
  <p>But  to continue the summary of events.</p>
  <p>Seeing  Leighton withdraw upstairs, followed by an officer in plain clothes, who had  appeared on the scene as if by magic, I could not refrain from asking why he  was allowed to separate himself from the others, and was much moved at being  informed that he had gone up to sit by his child&rsquo;s bed, that child who of all  in the house had found her wonted rest.</p>
  <p>That  he could calm himself down to such a task under the eye of one who could have  little sympathy with his feelings, whether they were those of outraged  innocence or self-accusing guilt, struck me as the most pathetic exhibition of  self-control I had ever known; and more than once during the busy hour that  followed, I was visited by fleeting visions of this silent man, sitting out the  night under the watchful eye of one who moved if he so much as lowered his head  to kiss the only cheek likely to smile upon him on the morrow as it had smiled  upon him to-day.</p>
  <p>That  the search for the missing phial was likely to be a long-continued one soon  became apparent to everyone. Two men who had carried the investigation into the  room where the servants had been shut up since early evening, came back with  the report that nothing had come to light in that quarter. At the same time two  more returned from above with a similar report in regard to the sleeping-rooms  of the three brothers. Sweetwater and Gryce, who had spent the last half-hour  in the dining-room, appeared to have an equally unsatisfactory tale to tell,  and I was wondering what move would now be made, when I intercepted a glance  from the coroner cast in the direction of the drawing-room, and realised that  the law was no respecter of persons and that she, she too, might be called upon  to give proof of not having this tell-tale article upon her person.</p>
  <p>The  prospect of such an indignity offered to one I regarded with more than passing  admiration unnerved me to such an extent that I was hardly myself when Dr.  Frisbie advanced upon me with this remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  regret the necessity, Mr. Outhwaite; but the emergencies of the case demand the  same compliance on your part as on that of the other gentlemen found upon this  scene of crime. It is needless to say that we have the utmost confidence in  your integrity, but you were here when Mr. Gillespie died, and have been close  to a certain member of this family many times since&mdash;and, in short, it is a form  which you as a lawyer will recognise and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  apologies,&rdquo; I prayed, recalling the one son of Mr. Gillespie who had not been  on the scene of crime at the time of his father&rsquo;s death.</p>
  <p>An  intelligent glance from the coroner convinced me that he was thinking of him  too. Indeed, he seemed to be more than willing to have me understand that he  exacted this thorough search in order to fix the crime on Leighton. For if the  phial was not to be found anywhere in the house, the necessary conclusion must  be that it had been carried out of it by the one person known to have left it  during the critical half-hour preceding Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  understand your thoughts,&rdquo; quoth the coroner, who seemed to read my face like  an open book. &ldquo;The phial may have been smashed on the sidewalk or thrown into  some refuse barrel. But that would be the unwisest thing a guilty man could do.  For its odour is unmistakable, and once it is found by the men I will set  looking for it at daybreak&mdash;Well, what now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  was whispering in his ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  child? Do I remember that the father suggested she should be put to bed  undressed? Oh, I cannot have you disturb the child. Used as I am to the  subterfuges of criminals I find it impossible to believe that a father could  make use of his child as a medium for his own safety.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  Miss Meredith?&rdquo; the insidious whisperer went on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  Miss Meredith. She may have the bottle on her own person, but she would never  pass it over to the child. No, no! curb your extravagances and confine your  attention to Mr. Outhwaite, who is kind enough to allow us to inspect his  pockets&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  the curtain at the drawing-room door was disturbed and a pallid face looked  forth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  pray you,&rdquo; came in entreaty from Hope&rsquo;s set lips, &ldquo;spare this stranger, whose  only crime has been to show kindness to a man he did not know, in an extremity  he did not understand. Search me; search Claire; but do not subject this  gentleman to an act so injurious. I swear that the phial is not on him! I swear&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  hardly knew what she was saying. The heaped-up excitements of the last two  hours were fast unsettling her reason.</p>
  <p>She  held out her hands imploringly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I care so much,&rdquo; she murmured  in fresh expostulation, &ldquo;but I feel as if I could not bear it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>From  that moment I loved her, though I knew this interposition in my behalf sprang  from her womanly instinct rather than from the spontaneous impulse of a freshly  awakened heart. I must have shown how deeply I was moved, for the coroner  looked distressed, though he gave no signs of modifying his intention, and I  was beginning to empty my pockets before his eyes, when Sweetwater&rsquo;s expressive  countenance showed a sudden change, and he rushed again to the rear. Here he  stood a moment before the dining-room door, striking his forehead in wrathful  indecision; then he disappeared within, only to shout aloud in another instant:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fool!  fool! And I noticed when I first came in that the clock had stopped. See! see!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  were at his side in an instant. He was standing by the mantelpiece, with the  heavy French clock tilted up before our eyes. Under it, tucked away in the  space allowed to the pendulum, we saw a small homoeopathic bottle. There was  one drop of liquid at the bottom, which even before Mr. Gryce lifted the bottle  to his nose we recognised by its smell to be prussic acid.</p>
  <p>The  phial which had held the deadly dose was found.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
    The Pencil</b></h2>
  <p>Under  Sweetwater&rsquo;s careful guidance, the clock fell slowly back into place. It was  one of those solid time-pieces which seem to form part of the shelf on which  they stand. When it was again quite level, he pointed to its face. The hands  stood at half-past nine, just ten minutes previous to the time of my entering  the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  what hour did Mr. Leighton Gillespie go out to-night?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>No  one answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before  half-past nine or after it?&rdquo; urged the coroner, consulting the faces about him  for the answer he probably had no expectation of receiving from anyone&rsquo;s lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leighton&rsquo;s  all right,&rdquo; cried out a voice from the library. &ldquo;I hate his puritanical ways,  but there&rsquo;s no harm in him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  sounded like Alfred, but the impression made by this interruption was not good.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  you allow me to state a fact,&rdquo; ventured Miss Meredith, coming impulsively  forward. &ldquo;If you hope to establish the guilt or innocence of anyone by the time  marked by these hands, you will make a mistake. The clock has been out of order  for some days. Yesterday it ran down. I heard my uncle say that it would have  to go back to Tiffany&rsquo;s for repairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fetch  in the butler or whoever has charge of this room,&rdquo; ordered Dr. Frisbie. &ldquo;Let  none of you attempt to speak while he is present. I wish to interrogate him  myself and will have no interruptions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  all drew back, and silence reigned in the spacious apartment which, lit up as  for a dinner party, was yet in such a state of disorder that the orderly old  butler groaned as his eyes fell upon the heaped-up rugs, the overturned chairs,  and the great table stacked with fine china and cut-glass taken from the buffet  and closets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  what shall I do here?&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;What would master&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did not finish; but we all understood him. The coroner pointed to the clock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  was this wound last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old man stared at the time-piece, mumbled, and shook his head. Then his eyes  fell on Miss Meredith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;It has not been running for days; has it, Miss?  I have had to use my watch in order to be on time with the meals. Why do you  ask, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was not answered. This repeated closing up of every avenue of inquiry was  beginning to tell upon the police.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Gillespie looked very sober, very sober indeed, when he found he had to drink  his wine alone,&rdquo; continued the butler, with a melancholy emphasis calculated to  draw our attention back to the scene which had manifestly made such an  impression upon him. &ldquo;He lifted up his glass and held it out a long while  before he drank it. I think he looked at each one of the young gentlemen in  turn, but I didn&rsquo;t care to watch him too closely, for there was something  solemn about him which made me feel queer, living so long as I have in the  family and with every one of these young gentlemen babies in arms when I came  here. He drank it finally, standing. But there was no harm in that glass, sirs,  for I finished the bottle myself afterwards, and I am well, as you see. More&rsquo;s  the pity!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shut  up!&rdquo; shouted an angry voice from across the hall. &ldquo;You are making a &mdash; mess of  the whole affair with your confounded drivel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  coroner motioned the butler away.</p>
  <p>The  atmosphere of the house had now become oppressive even to me, and for the first  time I experienced a desire to be quit of it, and would certainly have made  some movement towards departure had it not been for my dread of leaving Miss  Meredith alone with her own thoughts.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  the coroner was issuing his orders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dakin,  request the gentlemen upstairs to come down again for a few minutes. Dr.  Bennett, the body of your patient can now be moved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  here we are again,&rdquo; he exclaimed, as Leighton was heard descending the stairs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  if the two other sons of the deceased will attend to my words for a moment I  will state that under the existing circumstances I feel it my duty to call a  jury and hold an inquest over Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s remains. The phial smelling of  prussic acid having been found in the dining-room, I shall only require  restraint put upon the movements of the two sons of Mr. Gillespie who are known  to have entered this room during the hour when this fatal dose was  administered. The one called Alfred, having remained above, is for the present  free from suspicion. I would be glad to show the same consideration to the  others; but the facts demand a severity which I hope future developments will  allow us to confine to the guilty party. Mr. Outhwaite, I must request you to hold  yourself subject to my summons. Miss Meredith, I advise you to hold no  communication with your cousins till this matter shows a clearer aspect.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was moving off, when Alfred, who had been shifting uneasily under George&rsquo;s eye,  stepped up to him and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want any discrimination made between my brothers and myself. I may be  quite conscious of my own innocence, but I cannot accept any show of favours  founded on a misconception. If George and Leighton are to be subjected to  surveillance on account of entering the dining-room this evening, then I want  to be put under surveillance too. For I was in that room as well as they,  searching for a small gold pencil which I had dropped from my pocket at  dinner-time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  acknowledgment made under such circumstances and against such odds was  calculated to enlist sympathy, and my heart warmed towards the man who in the  heat of anger could strike a brother to the ground, but scorned at a less angry  moment to take refuge in a misunderstanding which left that brother at a  disadvantage.</p>
  <p>But  the imperturbability of the elderly detective, who at that moment found  something to interest him in the chasing on a Chinese gong hanging from a  bracket in the hall, warned me not to be too quick with my sympathies. Kindly  as he beamed upon this favoured object of his attention, I saw that he took  little stock in the generous attitude assumed by Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s youngest son;  and my attention being attracted to his movements, I was happily glancing his  way when he suddenly approached Alfred with what looked like an empty tumbler  in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this the article you refer to?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>And  then we saw that the tumbler was not empty,&mdash;that it held a small object  standing upright in it, and that this object was a gold pencil.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  that is my pencil,&rdquo; Alfred acknowledged. &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I am accountable for putting it into the tumbler,&rdquo; the old man admitted. &ldquo;The  tumbler was a clean one, Mr. Gillespie. I assure you I examined it closely  before making it a receptacle for this pencil. But the pencil itself&mdash;Let me ask  you to put your nose to it, Mr. Gillespie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a suggestion capable of but one interpretation. Alfred started back, his  eyes staring, his features convulsed. Then he bent impulsively forward and put  his nose to the object Mr. Gryce held out. With what result was evident from  the sudden damp which broke out on his forehead.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  </b>Something To Think About</h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Fatality!&rdquo;  exclaimed Alfred. And, raising his head, he strode impetuously towards Miss  Meredith. &ldquo;You have enjoined a confession of guilt and forbidden us to assert  our innocence,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;But I shall assert mine now and always, whatever  happens and whoever suffers. I should not be worthy of the happiness I aim at,  if I did not declare my guiltlessness in the face of facts which seem to militate  against me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe you&mdash;&rdquo; she began, her hand trembling towards his. But the confiding  impulse was stayed&mdash;by what thought? by what dread? and her hand fell and her  lips closed before she had completed the sentence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am innocent,&rdquo; he repeated, drawing himself up in proud assertion, nobly borne  out by the clear regard of the eye which now turned alternately on George and  Leighton, who were standing upon either side of him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the use of repeating a phrase you cannot back up with proof?&rdquo; called out  George, who was still gnawing his own special grievance. &ldquo;I am as innocent as  you are, but I scorn to take advantage of each and every opportunity to assert  it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Leighton  neither spoke nor moved. The melancholy in which he was now completely lost  repelled all attempt to break it. Nor did this expression of complete  wretchedness alter during the hubbub that followed. When it did&mdash;but I must make  clear the circumstances of this change. I was engaged in making my adieux to  Miss Meredith, when Sweetwater, after a marked effort to meet my eye, motioned  me to join him in the doorway of the den where Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s body still lay. Not  enjoying the summons, yet feeling it impossible to slight them, I ventured, for  the last time, or so I hoped, down the hall.</p>
  <p>The  young detective was looking into the room which had already played so  conspicuous a part in the events of the night, and as I drew up beside him, I  perceived that his eyes were fixed not upon the out-stretched figure of its  late occupant, but on the face and form of Leighton Gillespie, who was bending  above it.</p>
  <p>For  all the humiliation I felt at thus sharing the professional surveillance  entered into by this able young detective, I could not resist following his  glance, which seemed to find something remarkable in the attitude or expression  of the man before me.</p>
  <p>The  result was a similar interest on my part and a score of new surmises. The  melancholy which up till now had been the predominating characteristic of this  inscrutable face had yielded to what could not be called a smile and yet was  strangely like one; and this smile or shadow of a smile, had in it just that  tinge of sarcasm which made it the one look of all others least to be expected  from a son who in common with his brothers laboured under a suspicion of having  been the direct cause of his father&rsquo;s death.</p>
  <p>With  the memory of it fixed indelibly in my mind, I moved away, and in another  moment was quit of the house in which I had spent four hours of extraordinary  suspense and exciting adventure. As I passed down the stoop, I met a young man  coming up. He was the first of the army of reporters destined to besiege that  house before daybreak.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
    Gossip</b></h2>
  <p>Next  morning I routed up Sam Underhill at an early hour. Sam Underhill is my special  friend; he is also my nearest neighbour, his apartment being directly under my  own.</p>
  <p>He  is a lazy chap and I found him abed, and none too well pleased at being  disturbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  the dickens brings you here at this unearthly hour?&rdquo; was the amiable greeting I  received.</p>
  <p>I  waited till he had made himself comfortable again; then I boldly stated:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a club-man, Sam, and consequently well up in the so-called gossip of the  day. What can you tell me about the Gillespies?&mdash;the three young men I mean, sons  of Archibald Gillespie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;George,  Alfred, and Leighton? What possible interest can you have in them? Rich  fellows, spendthrifts, every one of them. What have they been up to that you  should rout me up at this hour&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  reply I opened out the morning paper which I had been careful to bring along.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  here!&rdquo; I cried: &ldquo; &lsquo;Archibald Gillespie, the well-known broker, died suddenly  last night, from the effects of some drug mysteriously administered.&rsquo; &rdquo; I was  reading rapidly, anxious to see what kind of a story the reporters had made of  it. &ldquo; &lsquo;He had been ill for some weeks back, but seemed perfectly restored up to  half-past nine o&rsquo;clock last evening, when he fell and died without warning, in  the small room known as his den. A bottle of chloral was found on the mantel  but there is no proof that he took any of it. Indeed, his symptoms were such  that the action of a much more violent drug is suspected. His little grandchild  was a witness to his last moments.&rsquo; &nbsp;George, Leighton, and Alfred are now more than  rich fellows. They are rich men,&rdquo; I suggested, relieved that my name had not  appeared in the headlines.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  need to be,&rdquo; was the short reply. &ldquo;One of them at least stood in great need of  money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which?&rdquo;  I asked, with an odd sensation of choking in my throat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;George.  He&rsquo;s about played out, as I take it. To my certain knowledge he has lost in  unfortunate bets thirty thousand dollars since summer set in. He has a mania  for betting and card-playing, and as his father had little patience with vices  of this nature, their relations of late have been more than strained. But he&rsquo;s  a mighty big-hearted fellow for all that, and a great favourite with the men  who don&rsquo;t play with him. I heard he was going to be married. That and this  sudden windfall may set him straight again. He&rsquo;s a handsome fellow; did you  ever meet him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo;  I acknowledged. Then with an effort of which I was more or less ashamed, I  asked the name of the girl who was willing to take such a well-known  spendthrift for a husband.</p>
  <p>Sam  did not seem to be as well posted on this point as on some others.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have heard her name,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Some cousin, who lives in the same house  with him. The old gentleman fancied her so much, he promised to give a big  fortune to the son who married her. It seems that George is likely to be the  lucky one. Strange, what odd things come up in families.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is another brother&mdash;Alfred, I think they call him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Alph! He&rsquo;s a deuced handsome chap, too, but not such a universal favourite as  George. More moral though. I think his sole vice is an inordinate love of doing  nothing. I have known him to lie out half the night on a club-divan, saying  nothing, doing nothing, not even smoking. I have sometimes wondered if he ate  opium on the sly. Life would be stupid as he spends it, if dreams did not take  the place of the pleasant realities he scorns.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  must have shown my amazement. This was not the Alfred Gillespie I had met the  night before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have heard that everything was not quite smooth with him. I know I haven&rsquo;t seen  him around lately, crushing pillows and making us all look vulgar in contrast  to his calm and almost insulting impassibility. I wonder what he will do with  the three or four millions which will fall to his share.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Marry,&rdquo;  I suggested, fillipping a fly from my coat-sleeve.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He?  Alph? I don&rsquo;t believe he could hold himself erect long enough to go through the  ceremony. Besides, it would be such a bore. That&rsquo;s my idea of Alph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was not mine. Either he had greatly changed, or Sam Underhill&rsquo;s knowledge of  him was of the most superficial character. As I wavered between these two  conclusions I began to experience a vague sensation of dread. If love could  effect such a transformation in so unlikely a subject as the man we were  discussing, what might it not effect in an ardent nature like my own?</p>
  <p>I  hastened to change the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  third brother is already married, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leighton?  Oh, he&rsquo;s a widower; has been a widower for years. He was unfortunate in the  marriage he made. After the first year no one ever saw young Mrs. Gillespie in  public. I don&rsquo;t think the old gentleman ever forgave him that match.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  was the trouble? He seems to have a dear little girl. I saw her when I saw her  uncle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the child. She&rsquo;s well enough, but the mother was&mdash;well, we will be charitable  and say erratic. Common stock, I&rsquo;ve heard. No mate at all for a man like him.  Not that he&rsquo;s any too good either for all his hypocritical ways. I have no use  for Leighton. I cannot abide so-called philanthropic men whose noses are always  in the gutter. He&rsquo;s a sneak, is Leighton, and so inconsistent. One day you hear  of him presiding at some charity meeting; the next night you find him behind the  scenes at a variety theatre. And as for money&mdash;not one of Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s sons  spends so much. He has just drained the old man&rsquo;s purse, or so I&rsquo;ve heard; and  when asked to give an account of himself mentions his charities and many  schemes of benevolence&mdash;as if the old man himself didn&rsquo;t spend thousands in just  such lines.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  doesn&rsquo;t look like a prig,&rdquo; I ventured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  he looks well enough. But there&rsquo;s something wrong about the man. His own folks  acknowledge it; something shameful, furtive; something which will not bear the  light. None of those boys are chips of the old block. Let&rsquo;s see the paper. What  are you holding it off for? Anything more about Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s death? Do they  call it suicide? That would be a sad ending to such a successful life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  question first. Was Mr. Gillespie a good man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was rich; yet had few if any calumniators.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  handed him the paper. There were some startling lines below those I had read  out so glibly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  do not stop at suicide,&rdquo; I remarked; &ldquo;murder is suggested. The drug was not  administered by himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  protested Sam, running his eye over the lines that were destined to startle all  New York that morning. &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do! None of those boys are bad enough for  that, not even Leighton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  dislike Leighton,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
  <p>He  did not reply; he had just come upon my name in the article he was reading.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look  here!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a close one. How came you to be mixed up with the  affair? I see your name here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  complied with an eagerness which I suppose but faintly mirrored that of half  the <i>Tribune&rsquo;s</i> readers that morning.  What he read, I leave to your imagination, merely premising that no new facts  had come to light since my departure from the house and the printing of the  paper. When he had finished, he bestowed upon me a long and scrutinising look. &ldquo;This  knocks me out,&rdquo; said he, with more force than elegance. &ldquo;I would never have  believed it, never, of any of these men.&rdquo; Then with a sudden change quite  characteristic, he ejaculated, &ldquo;It was a rum chance for you, Arthur. How did  you like it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  refused to discuss this side of the question. I was afraid of disclosing what  had become the inner-most secret of my heart.</p>
  <p>He  did not notice my reticence&mdash;this, too, was like him&mdash;but remarked with visible  reluctance:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  weight of evidence seems to be against Alph. Poor Alph! So this is the result  of those long, unbroken hours of silent dreaming! I shall never trust a lazy  man again. When they do bestir themselves&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has not been arrested yet,&rdquo; I interjected dryly. &ldquo;Till the police show absolute  belief in his guilt, I for one shall hold my tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor  Alph!&rdquo; was all the reply I received.</p>

    Indications</b></h2>
  <p>These  concluding words of Sam Underhill show the trend of public opinion at this  time. But I was not swayed by the general prejudice, nor, to all appearance,  were the police. Though enough poison was found in Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s remains to  have caused the death of any ordinary man in fifteen minutes, no arrests were  made, nor was Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s favourite son subjected to any closer  surveillance than the other members of this once highly respected family.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  the papers were filled with gossip about the case, which was now openly  regarded as one of murder. In one column I read a semi-humorous, semi-serious  account of how George Gillespie actually once won a bet in face of all odds and  to the confounding of those who trusted in his invariable ill-luck; and in  another how Leighton had worn out his father&rsquo;s patience by a most persistent  association with the most degraded classes, an association which led him into  all sorts of extravagances. As a sample of these, and to show how entirely his follies  differed from those of his elder brother, he has been known to order breakfast  at a restaurant and disappear in the wake of a Salvation Army procession before  the meal could be served. They never knew at home when to expect him in, or at  what moment he might leave the family circle. He was so restless, he rarely sat  an evening out in any one place. Without any apparent reason, he would often  leave in the midst of concert, sermon, or lecture, and has been known more than  once to dash away from a theatrical performance as if his life depended upon  his reaching the open air. And he never expected to be criticised or  questioned. If he were, he found some apology to suit the occasion; but the  apology was forced, and the person who called it forth rarely repeated the  offence.</p>
  <p>Only  a small paragraph was devoted to Alfred. In it his temporary engagement to Miss  Saxton of Baltimore was mentioned, and a somewhat cruel account given of the  way he jilted this young lady on his return to the city. As this was coincident  with the arrival of Hope at her uncle&rsquo;s house, I needed no further explanation  of his fickleness.</p>
  <p>All  this gossip about people in whom I had come to take so deep an interest both  worried and unsettled me; and I found myself looking forward with mingled dread  and expectation to the public inquiry, which I had every reason to hope would  separate some of these threads, in the network of which my own heart had become  so unfortunately entangled.</p>
  <p>It  had been called for Thursday, and when that day came I was one of the first to  appear upon the scene. Not a word of what passed escaped me; not a look nor a  sign. Miss Meredith, who entered on the arm of Leighton, wore a veil thick  enough to conceal her features. But I did not need to pierce that veil to  imagine the expression of anxiety and distress she thus concealed from the  crowd. George, who had resumed his usual manner, sat, conspicuous in height and  good looks, among a group of witnesses, some of whom I knew and some not. Dr.  Bennett sat at my side, and had so little to say that I did not attempt to  disturb him, having respect for the grief with which he regarded the untimely end  of his life-long friend and patient.</p>
  <p>The  first witness was myself.</p>
  <p>As  my testimony contained nothing which has not been already very fully related in  these pages, I will pass over this portion of the scene, with the single remark  that in the course of my whole examination, which was a lengthy and exhaustive  one, I allowed no expression to escape me likely to prejudice the minds of  those about me against any one of Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s sons. For it was apparent, before  I had been upon the stand ten minutes, that an effort was being made to fix the  crime on Alfred; and what surety could I have that this result would not plunge  a barbed arrow into the breast of her about whom my fancy had drawn its magic  circle? As I sat down, I glanced her way, and it seemed to me there was meaning  in the slight acknowledgment she made me with her ungloved hand. But what  meaning?</p>
  <p>The  inquiry thus being opened, and curiosity roused as to the motive which led Mr.  Gillespie to summon a stranger to his side at a moment so vital and under  circumstances seemingly calling for the ministrations of those nearest and  dearest to him, various experts and physicians were called to prove that his  death had not been caused by disease, but by the action of prussic acid on a  sufficiently healthy system. With the establishment of this fact the morning&rsquo;s  inquiry closed.</p>
  <p>As  Miss Meredith was likely to be the first witness called at the afternoon  session, I felt it my duty as her lawyer to approach her at this time with the  following question, quite customary under the circumstances:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Meredith,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you will probably soon be subjected to a searching inquiry  by the coroner. May I ask if there is any special point or topic concerning  which you would prefer to keep silence? If so, I can insist upon your  privilege.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  look of mingled surprise and indignation with which she regarded me was a  sufficient answer in itself. Yet she chose to say, and say coldly, after a  moment of reflection:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have nothing to conceal. He can ask no question I shall not be perfectly  willing to answer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Abashed  by the construction she had put upon my words, as well as greatly hurt by her  manner, I bowed and drew off. Evidently she had felt her candour impugned and  her innocence questioned, and, in her ignorance of legal proceedings, thought  she had only to speak the truth to sustain herself in my eyes and in those of  the crowd assembled to hear her.</p>
  <p>This  sort of self-confidence is common in witnesses, especially in such as are more  conscious of their integrity than of the pitfalls underlying the simplest  inquiry; and however much I might deplore her short-sightedness and wish that  she had better understood both myself and her own position, it was plain that,  in the light of what had just passed between us, all interference on my part  would be regarded by her as an insult, and that I would be expected to keep  silence under all circumstances, let the consequences be what they would.</p>
  <p>It  was an outlook far from agreeable either for the lawyer or lover, and the  recess which now ensued was passed by me in a state of dread of which she in  her inexperience had little idea.</p>
  <p>Upon  the reseating of the jury, her name, just as I had anticipated, was the first  one called.</p>
  <p>The  emotions with which I saw her rise and throw aside her veil under the  concentrated gaze of the unsympathetic crowd convened to hear her testimony,  first revealed to me the absoluteness of her hold upon me; and when I heard the  buzz of admiration which followed the disclosure of her features, I was  conscious of colouring so deeply that I feared my secret would become the  common property of the crowd. But the spell created by her beauty still held,  and all regards remained fixed upon her countenance, now eloquent with feelings  which for the moment were shared by all who looked upon her.</p>
  <p>Her  voice when she spoke deepened the effect of her presence. It was of that fine  and resonant quality which awakens an echo in all sensitive hearts and carries  conviction with it even to the most callous and prejudiced. It lost some of its  power perhaps as the ear became accustomed to it; but to the very end of her  testimony, I noted here and there persons who looked up every time she spoke,  as if some inner chord responded to her tones&mdash;tones which, more than her face, conveyed  the impression of a nature exceedingly deep and exquisitely sensitive.</p>
  <p>She,  meantime, failed to realise the effect which her appearance had produced. She  had been questioned, and was striving earnestly and conscientiously to do  justice to her oath, and relate as circumstantially as possible what she knew  of her uncle&rsquo;s sudden death.</p>
  <p>This  is what I heard her say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was my uncle&rsquo;s typewriter. I assisted him often with his correspondence and was  accustomed to go in and out of his study as if it were my own room. On this  night, I had written several letters for him, and being tired had gone upstairs  for a little rest. But I was too anxious to be of assistance to him&mdash;his mail  that evening was unusually large&mdash;to retire without one more effort to relieve  him; so I went down again a little after ten. I had heard steps in the hall a few  minutes before, and little Claire&rsquo;s voice somewhere about the house, but I did  not encounter anyone in going down, perhaps because I went by the way of the  rear stairs, as I often do when I am in a hurry. Little, little did I imagine  what was before me. When I reached my uncle&rsquo;s door,&mdash;but you know what a  terrible sight met me. There lay my kind&mdash;my good&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  all waited, our hearts in our mouths, but in a moment more she choked down her  emotion and was ready to go on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was dead. I knew it at first glance, yet I raised no cry. I could not. I seemed  in an instant to have become marble. I saw him lying at my feet and did not  weep a tear. I did not even touch him. I merely staggered to the table at the  side of which he had fallen, and mechanically, but with a stoppage of my heart&rsquo;s  action which made the instant one of untold horror to me, lifted the carriage  of the typewriter which he had evidently been using when struck with death, and  looked to see what his last words had been. I had reason for believing that  they would convey some warning to me or at least an explanation of his sudden  death. And they did, or so I interpreted the isolated phrase I came upon at the  end of the unfinished letter I found there. God knows I may have been mistaken  as to what those five words meant, but I was so impressed with the belief that  they were added there for my personal enlightenment that I reeled under the responsibility  thus forced upon me, and, hardly conscious of what I was doing, tore off, with  almost criminal haste, the portion containing these words, and fled with them  out of the sight and reach of everyone in the house. It was a mad thing to do,  and I speedily regretted the insane impulse which had actuated me, for I was  very soon discovered in the remote spot to which I had fled, and the piece of  paper was found, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>How  could she be expected to go on?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  we that piece of paper here?&rdquo; asked the coroner.</p>
  <p>It  was produced, identified, and passed down to the jury.</p>
  <p>It  was my opinion at the time, and is still, that she told her story thus fully in  order to elude the questions which any apparent reticence on her part would  assuredly have evoked. But, having reached this point, it seemed impossible for  her to go farther. She drooped, not under the eyes of the crowd, but under the  fixed gaze of her three cousins. Had she hoped for some signs of sympathy from  them which she failed to receive, or, at least a partial recognition, on their  part, of the suffering she was undergoing in the cause of truth and justice? If  so, no such recognition came. George&rsquo;s fine face showed anger and anger only;  Leighton&rsquo;s, a cold impassibility which might have passed for the stolidity of  an utterly unfeeling man if his hands had not betrayed his inner restlessness  and torment; while Alfred&rsquo;s flashing eye and set lips made plain the fact that  his emotions clung to his own position rather than to hers&mdash;as was natural,  perhaps, with that slip of paper going the rounds of the jury, and calling up  from that respectable body startled, uneasy, or menacing looks, according to  the nature of the man examining it.</p>
  <p>You  remember that slip; a business communication broken into by these totally  irrelevant words, &ldquo;one of my sons He&rdquo;. Is it any wonder that these twelve  commonplace men keenly felt their position in face of what looked like a direct  accusation from the father&rsquo;s hand?</p>
  <p>Yet  as these five words, simple in themselves and gaining meaning only from the  effort which this young girl had made to suppress them, were capable of being  construed in a hundred different ways, the faces which at first blush mirrored  but one thought gradually assumed a non-committal aspect, which would have been  more encouraging to the men thus compromised, if the facts still to be brought  out in explanation of Miss Meredith&rsquo;s conduct towards them had not been of so damaging  a character.</p>
  <p>Hope,  who surmised, if she did not know, the contents of the letter she now heard  rustling in the coroner&rsquo;s hand, awaited his next question with evident  perturbation. Alfred, who may have hoped that this letter would not appear so  early in the examination, forgot himself for a moment and cast a look at his  brothers, which they took pains to ignore, perhaps because of the effort it  cost them to preserve their own countenances in face of the impending ordeal.</p>
  <p>I  was witness both to this appeal and its rebuff, but to all appearance Dr.  Frisbie saw neither. He was deciding with what form of words to introduce his  new subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Meredith,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;you will now take this letter in your own hand.  Have you ever seen it before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, it was a letter which was entrusted to me by my uncle, and which I was  told to preserve in secrecy so long as he retained his health and life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is addressed, as all may see: <i>To my three  sons, George, Leighton, and Alfred Gillespie.</i> Miss Meredith, did you understand  by these words that the enclosed was intended equally for your three cousins?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. My uncle Archibald told me so. He expressly said, in giving it into my  charge, that in the event of his sudden or unexplainable death, his three sons  were to read this letter together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has been opened, I see. Is that a sign it has been so delivered and read?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. When on the night I made that inconsiderate attempt to suppress the slip  of paper on which my uncle had transcribed the five words you have just shown  to the jury, one of my cousins reproached me with having drawn erroneous and  unwarrantable conclusions from what was there written. I justified myself by  handing over this letter. Though I was never shown its contents, I was well  aware of the circumstances under which it was written and&mdash;and I was certain it would  prove my best excuse for what would otherwise have seemed monstrous in one&mdash;who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was too disturbed to proceed.</p>
  <p>The  coroner looked at her kindly, but it was no part of his duty to allow any  sympathy he might feel for the witness to interfere with his endeavour to reach  the truth. He therefore urged her to relate the circumstances to which she  alluded; in other words, to explain how this letter addressed collectively to  her three cousins came to be written.</p>
  <p>She  grew still more distressed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  not the letter explain itself?&rdquo; she remonstrated. &ldquo;Spare me, I pray. My uncle&rsquo;s  sons have been brothers to me. Do not make me repeat what passed between my  uncle and myself on that unhappy morning when he first unburdened himself of  his intolerable grief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear that I cannot spare you,&rdquo; replied the coroner; &ldquo;but I will grant you a  short respite while this letter, or such portions of it as bear upon Mr.  Gillespie&rsquo;s death, is being read to the jury. Gentlemen, it is written in Mr.  Gillespie&rsquo;s own hand, and it is dated just a month prior to his unhappy demise.  Miss Meredith, you may sit.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  fell rather than sank into the chair offered her, and for a moment I felt  myself the prey of a boundless indignation as I witnessed the callousness shown  towards her by the three men who up to this time had presumably regarded her  with more or less affection. To me her position called for their especial  sympathy. The heroism she evinced was the heroism of a loving woman who  sacrifices herself, and what is dearest to her, to her idea of justice and law.  And while such action may be easy for a man, it is hard beyond expression for a  woman, who, as we know, is much more apt to listen to the voice of her heart than  to any abstract appeal of right and justice. Yet these same relatives of hers  sat still and scarcely looked her way, though she glanced repeatedly and with  heartrending appeal in their direction.</p>
  <p>I  am quite ready to admit that I was too prejudiced a witness to be just to these  men. Had I not myself been under the influence of a sudden and violent passion,  I would have seen that Alfred needed sympathy as well as she; for Alfred was  the man most menaced by the contents of the letter now on the point of being  read; and he knew this as certainly as she did.</p>
  <p>As  this letter is better known to you than it was to me up to this hour, I leave  you to judge of its effect upon the jury and the excited crowd of spectators  thronging the room at every point. Heads which had wagged in doubt now drooped  in heaviest depression; and while all eyes seemed to shrink from an attempt to  read the three white faces on the witnesses&rsquo; bench, the attention of all was  concentrated there, and it was with quite a sense of shock that Dr. Frisbie&rsquo;s  voice was heard rising again in renewed examination of the young lady whose precipitate  action had brought to public notice this touching letter of a heartbroken  father.</p>
  <p>His  first question was a leading one. Had Mr. Gillespie followed up his former  confidences by any further allusions to the attempt which had been made upon  his life?</p>
  <p>Her  answer was a direct negative. Though she had detected in her uncle signs of  great unhappiness, he had held no further conversation with her on this topic,  and life had gone on as usual in the great house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  he talked of poisons, and refused to take any more of the medicine which came  so near killing him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle  Archibald took no more of this medicine, certainly. That is, I saw no more of  it in the house. But he never talked of poisons, that is, publicly or in my  presence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at the table?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  after that night, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  had before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  incidentally. He had laughed at some of Dr. Bennett&rsquo;s remarks, and once I heard  him mention the danger of taking an overdose of the remedy that was doing him  so much good. It was while jesting with me upon my refusal to allow anyone else  to portion it out for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was your duty, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Assuredly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  you in the habit of preparing his glass when alone or in the presence of his  sons?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  it happened, sir. I had but one dread; that of miscounting the drops.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  he took no more of this medicine after that especial night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir. He asked Dr. Bennett for a narcotic of less dangerous properties, and was  given chloral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you hear any remarks made on this change?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  became of the phial which held the remainder of this medicine marked &lsquo;Poison&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  emptied it out at my uncle&rsquo;s request.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were your uncle&rsquo;s nurse, then, typewriter, and friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  trusted me, sir, in all these capacities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he trust you with his business concerns?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all. I merely wrote letters to his dictation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you know, or have you ever heard, the value of his estate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have never even asked myself whether he counted his fortune by thousands or  millions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  dignity, the simplicity, with which this was said made it an impressive  termination to a very painful examination. As I noted the effect it produced, I  was in hopes that she would be allowed to retire for the day. But the coroner  had other views. With a hesitancy that more or less prepared us for what was to  come, he addressed her again, saying quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have spared you a public reading of certain portions of your uncle&rsquo;s letter,  referring to yourself and the wishes he openly cherished in your behalf. In  return, will you inform me if you are engaged to marry any one of these young  men?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  thrill, the start given to the witnesses&rsquo; bench by this pointed question,  communicated itself to officer and spectator. In George&rsquo;s fiery flush and  Alfred&rsquo;s sudden paleness, emotions could be seen at work of sufficient  significance to draw every eye; though few present, I dare say, ascribed these  emotions to their rightful sources. To myself, divided as I was in feeling between  the anxiety I could not but feel as her lawyer to see her parry a question too  personal not to be humiliating, and the interest with which, as her lover, I  awaited a response which would solve my own doubts and make clear my own position,  there was something in the attitude of both these men strongly suggestive of a  like uncertainty. Were her feelings, then, as much of a mystery to them as they  were to me? Did George fear to hear her say she was engaged to Alfred, and  Alfred dread to hear her admit that she was irrevocably pledged to George? If  so, what a situation had been evolved by this question publicly put by a city  functionary! No wonder the young girl dropped her eyes before venturing a  reply.</p>
  <p>But  the spirit of self-protection, always greater in woman than in man where heart  secrets are involved, gave her strength to meet this crisis with a baffling  serenity. Raising her patient eyes, she replied with a sweet composure which  acted like a tonic upon the agitated hearts about her:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is no such engagement. I have lived in their house like a sister. Their father  was my mother&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another  man than Coroner Frisbie would have let her go, but this honest, if kindly,  official was strangely tenacious when he had a point to gain. Flushing himself,  for her look was directed quite steadily upon him, he gravely repeated:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mean to say that no words of love ever passed between you and any of these  gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was too much. Expecting to see her recoil, possibly break down, I eagerly  looked her way for the permission to interfere, which she might now be ready to  give me. But with a proud lift of her head she showed herself equal to the  emergency, and her answer, given simply and with no attempt at subterfuge,  restored her at once to the dignified position we all dreaded to see her lose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean to say nothing but the truth. Mr. George Gillespie has more than once  honoured me by making me an offer of his hand. But I did not consider myself in  a position to accept it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dr.  Frisbie showed her no quarter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  your cousin Alfred?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alfred?&rdquo;  Her eyes no longer met those of the coroner or anyone else in that cruel crowd.  &ldquo;He,&rdquo; she stammered proudly, &ldquo;has never interfered with whatever claims his  brother may have been supposed to have upon my favour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a statement to awaken turmoil in more than one of the uneasy hearts behind  her. George bounded to his feet, though he quickly subsided again into his  seat, ashamed of this betrayal, or fearful of the effect it might have upon his  brother. Alfred, on the contrary, sat still, but the bitterness visible in his  smile spoke volumes, and, seeing it, the whole crowd recognised what had long  been apparent to myself, that these two brothers were rivals in the love they  bore this woman, and that it was through her desire to shield the one she favoured,  that she made the first false move which had drawn the attention of the police  to the doubtful position held by Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s sons.</p>
  <p>That  her choice had fallen upon the man who had not interfered with his brother&rsquo;s  rights seemed only too probable, and I expected the coroner to force this  acknowledgment from her lips, but he grew considerate all at once and inquired  instead if Mr. Gillespie had been made aware of his elder son&rsquo;s wishes. She  replied to this by saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  were no secret in the house&rdquo;; and, with a look, begged him to spare her.</p>
  <p>But  this man was inexorable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  did he approve of the match?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you failed to engage yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  she deemed already answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  the younger brother had pressed his suit for your hand, do you think that under  the circumstances your uncle would have sanctioned such rivalry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This,  perhaps, she could not answer. At all events she was as silent as before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Meredith,&rdquo; proceeded her tormentor, utterly oblivious or entirely careless of  the suffering he caused her, &ldquo;do you know whether your uncle and his youngest  son ever had any words on this subject?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  hands involuntarily flew out in piteous entreaty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask  this question of the only person who can answer it,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I only know  that I have been treated with great respect in the house of my uncle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  that, the proceedings closed for the day.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
    A Sudden Turn</b></h2>
  <p>Dr.  Frisbie&rsquo;s point had been made. As we separated to our several destinations for  the night, it was with the universally expressed conviction that this young  girl, for all her beauty and attractive qualities, had been an apple of discord  in her uncle&rsquo;s house, and that in this fact, rather than in an impatient desire  to enjoy the wealth of a man who was never close with his sons, the unnatural  crime we were considering had originated.</p>
  <p>The  evidence elicited from the first witness called to the stand on the following  morning tended to substantiate this conclusion.</p>
  <p>Nellie  Stryker, an old inmate of the Gillespie house, answered the coroner&rsquo;s questions  with great reluctance. She had been maid to Mrs. Gillespie, nurse to all the  children, and a trusted servant in the household ever since the latter grew  beyond her care. Of the attempts made upon her master&rsquo;s life, the last of which  had been only too successful, she knew little and that only by hearsay, but she  was not quite so ignorant concerning a certain conversation which had been held  one morning in Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s room between that gentleman and his youngest  son. She was sitting at her needle in the adjoining dressing-closet, and,  whether her presence there was unsuspected by her master or simply ignored,  they both talked quite freely and she heard every word.</p>
  <p>Urged  to repeat this conversation, the good old soul showed a shamefaced reluctance  which bore out her reputation for honesty and discretion. But she was not  allowed to escape the examination set for her. After repeated questions and a  show of extreme patience on the part of the coroner, she admitted that the  topic discussed was the state of Mr. Alfred&rsquo;s affections. This young gentleman,  as was publicly known, had lately engaged himself to a Southern lady of great pride  and high social distinction; and his present disagreement with his father arose  out of his wish to break this engagement. His father had no patience with such  fickleness, and their words ran high. Finally, Alfred threatened to follow his  own wishes in the matter, whether it gave satisfaction all round or no;  declaring that he had been a fool to tie himself to a girl he cared nothing  about, but that he would be a still greater one if he let the mistake of a  moment mar his happiness for life. But the old gentleman&rsquo;s sense of honour was very  keen, and he continued to urge the claims of the Southern lady, till his son  impetuously blurted out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you wanted one of us to marry Hope?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  caused a break in the conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you care for Hope?&rdquo; the old gentleman asked. &ldquo;I thought it was well understood  in this house that George, not you, was to be given the first opportunity of  winning her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  oath with which Alfred answered was shocking to Nellie&rsquo;s ears, and affected her  so deeply that she heard nothing more till these words caught her attention:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;George  has everything he wants; unlimited indulgence in each and every fancy, the  liking of all the men, and the love of all the women. I am not so fortunate; I  am neither a favourite with my mates nor the petted darling of their sisters; I  like my ease, but I could give that up for Hope. She is the only woman I have  ever seen capable of influencing me. I have been quite a different man since  she came into the house. If that is love, it is a very strong love; such love  as makes a man out of a nobody. Father, let me have this darling girl for my  wife. George does not care for her,&mdash;not as I do. He would be a better fellow if  he did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gillespie seemed quite upset. He loved this son as the apple of his eye, and  would very possibly have been glad to see the matter so adjusted, but it did  not tally with his idea of what people had a right to expect from his sons, and  he told Alfred so in rather strong language.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you remember that language?&rdquo; asked the coroner.</p>
  <p>She  tried to make him believe, and herself too, no doubt, that her memory would not  serve her to this extent; but her honesty eventually triumphed over her  devotion to the family interests, and she finally admitted that the old  gentleman had said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;While  I live I will not put up with rivalry of any kind between my sons. George is  fond of Hope, and I long ago gave him my permission to woo and marry her. That  you are the child of my heart shall not make me blind to the rights of one I  loved before you ever saw the light. Were I to permit such shilly-shallying,  George would have a right to reproach me with his wasted life. No; the  influence which you call so great must be exerted in his behalf rather than  yours. He needs it, Alfred, as much, if not more than you do. As to your  present engagement, you may break it or you may keep it, but do not expect me to  uphold you in any love-making with your brother&rsquo;s choice till Hope has openly  signified her absolute refusal of his attentions. This she is not likely to do;  George has too many conspicuous attractions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has refused him once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  because her fancy was caught by his younger brother, but because she wished to  see some reformation in his habits. In this she was perfectly right. George  will have to change his mode of life very materially before he can be regarded  as worthy of such a wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  same might be said of me; but I am no George. I am anxious to make such a  change. Yet you give me no encouragement in my efforts, and even deny me the  opportunity of winning her affections.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were not the first to enter the field. Your older brother has the prior right,  and, as I view the matter, the only right, to approach Hope in the attitude of  a lover.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  oaths which this excited turned the poor old listener cold. Alfred could not  see the justice of his brother&rsquo;s course, and stormed away about fairness being  shown to the young girl herself, who possibly looked upon the matter in another  light than he did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you have been making love to her on the sly!&rdquo; vociferated Mr. Gillespie,  totally forgetting himself.</p>
  <p>But  this the young man denied. If he understood her better than others did, it was  because he loved her better. He was positive that she did not care for his  brother, and all but certain she did care for himself. At all events he  flattered himself to this extent. This called forth a few more bitter words  from his father, and Alfred went out, banging the door behind him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  did you see any change in the manner of Mr. Gillespie towards his sons after  this misunderstanding with Alfred?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  witness appeared to weigh her words; but, when she answered, it was evident her  care arose from a desire to present the subject fairly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought Mr. Gillespie talked less and looked about him more. And the young  gentlemen seemed conscious of this change in him, for they were very careful not  to show their feelings too plainly in his presence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  there was a manifested distrust between them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Amounting  to animosity?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  I cannot say. I never heard them exchange hard words; only neither of them  would leave the field open to the other. If Mr. George stayed home, Mr. Alfred  found some excuse for doing so also; and if Mr. Alfred showed a disposition to  linger in the parlour, Mr. George brought in his friends and made a social  evening of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  is this all you can tell us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  this topic? Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  never saw Miss Meredith speaking apart to either of these two men?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  sir; on the contrary, she appeared to avoid all private conversation with any  of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  ever heard either of these men swear he would have Miss Meredith for his wife,  no matter who stood in the way, or what means were taken to stop him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I once heard Mr. Alfred make use of some violent expressions as I was passing  his door, but I can not be sure he spoke the precise words you mention. He  falls into fits of anger at times and then is liable to forget himself. But his  ill-temper does not last, sir. It is quite unusual for him to show unkindness  for any length of time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After  the close of this examination, so painful to the witnesses and so humiliating to  the three persons whose most cherished feelings were thus exposed to the public  eye, the three sons of Mr. Gillespie were called up, one after the other, and  questioned.</p>
  <p>Leighton  made the best impression. Not being involved in the delicate question which had  just come up, he had no blushes to conceal nor any secret animosities to hold  in check. George, on the contrary, seemed to have reached a state of  exasperation which made it difficult for him to preserve any semblance of  self-possession. He stammered when he talked, and looked much more like having  it out with his brother in a hand-to-hand fight than submitting to an  examination tending to incriminate one or both of them on a charge of murder.  Alfred showed less bitterness, possibly because he felt securer in his position  towards the woman whose beauty had occasioned this rivalry. Of the facts  brought out by their accumulated testimony I need say little. They added  nothing to the general knowledge, and the inquiry adjourned with promise of  still more serious work for the morrow.</p>
  <p>Hitherto  the evidence had been of a nature to show, first, that a crime had been  committed, and, secondly, that the relations between Alfred and his father had  been such as to occasion a desire on the former&rsquo;s part to be free from the  watchful eye of one who stood between him and any attempt he might make to win  the affections of the woman upon whom he had set his heart. On this morning the  testimony took a turn, and an endeavour was made to show a positive connection between  Alfred Gillespie and the drug which had ended his father&rsquo;s life,&mdash;or so it  appeared at the time. The visit he paid to the dining-room during the fatal  hour preceding his father&rsquo;s death was brought out, and the acknowledgment  reached that he went there in search of his missing pencil.</p>
  <p>Then  the detectives were called to the stand and requested to relate the  circumstances connected with the finding of a certain cork and phial, the one  under the edge of the dining-room rug, and the other under the clock on the  mantel-shelf. These aforementioned articles were then produced, and after  positive declaration had been made that they had not been allowed to come in  contact since falling into the hands of the police, they were severally handed  down to the jury, who immediately proceeded to satisfy themselves that the  scent of bitter almonds was nearly as marked in one as the other. This point  having been reached and universal expectation raised, Sweetwater handed up another  article to the coroner, saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  this box, which is as nearly air-tight as I could procure offhand, I caused to  be placed, as soon as possible after finding it, the pencil which we came upon  in our search of the dining-room floor. Like the phial and the cork, it was  kept isolated in a perfectly clean glass till this box could be procured, and,  with this fact in mind, may I ask you to open the box and hand the pencil round  among the jury?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instantly  a great stir took place in the whole body of spectators. Necks were stretched,  heads were craned, and a general sigh swept from end to end of the room as the  coroner wrenched the cover from the box, lifted out the pencil, raised it to  his nose, and then passed it down to the jury. Only one person in sight failed  to follow these significant movements with looks of curious interest; and that  was the unhappy man who thus saw the finger of suspicion, which had been simply  wavering in his direction, settle into immobility and point inexorably towards  him. A white face and a sinking heart were shown by Alfred Gillespie at that  moment; and in the features of Hope, disclosed for one instant under the stress  of her mortal anxiety, I saw his anxiety reflected as in a mirror.</p>
  <p>The  jury whispered together with nods and significant looks as this small pencil  passed from hand to hand&mdash;I had almost said from nose to nose. Then silence was  restored, and the coroner, with a sudden change of manner startling to observe  in one whose bearing and tone reflected his feelings almost too openly, called  an expert in poisons to the stand.</p>
  <p>His  testimony established three facts: that the smell of prussic acid is  unmistakable; that this poison, though volatile in its character, preserves its  own individual odour for a long time if not subjected to too much air; and,  lastly, that if the pencil smelt of the bottle, the pocket in which they both  had lain would also give out the same odour of bitter almonds.</p>
  <p>When  the expert was seated, Detective Sweetwater was called back. And then for the  first time I noticed a large package encumbering the coroner&rsquo;s desk. As this  package was being unrolled, I stole a look at the witness, who, from his  assured air, evidently had the thread of Alfred&rsquo;s future destiny in his hand,  and was astonished to see how attractive a very plain man can sometimes become.</p>
  <p>Perhaps  I have not spoken of this young detective&rsquo;s plainness. It was so marked and of  such an unrelieved type that, after once seeing the man, you could never again  think of him without recalling his lank frame and inharmonious features.</p>
  <p>Yet  as he stood there, calm amidst the tremor of this throng, his eye sparkled with  such intelligence that I trembled for the man whose cause he was expected to  damage with his testimony. Seeing that my feelings were shared by those about  me, I glanced back at the coroner&rsquo;s table to see what the unrolling of that  package had revealed, and saw, hanging from the coroner&rsquo;s hands, three vests, which  he proceeded to display, one by one, before the witness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are these?&rdquo; he asked, with a stern look down the room, calculated to suppress  any too open demonstration of interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vests;  the property of the three gentlemen members of the present Gillespie household;  in other words, those severally worn by Messrs. George, Leighton, and Alfred  Gillespie on the evening of their father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know these particular vests to be the ones then worn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  their material and cut, of which I took especial note at the time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  other way?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. Foreseeing the difficulties which might arise if it ever became necessary  to distinguish the vests then worn from the half dozen others which we should  doubtless find in their well-supplied wardrobes, I took the precaution of  secretly running my finger over a freshly inked pen before taking hold of their  vests in the search I had been commanded to make of their persons. If the marks  of my finger can be seen on the white linings of the vests now in your hand,  you may be sure they are the ones subjected to my search on that night, as I  communicated my intention to no one and have since been exceedingly careful not  to take anyone into my confidence concerning this little trick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  coroner turned the vests. On the back of each a black spot was plainly visible  to the remotest observer in the room. A murmur of mingled admiration and  suspense responded to this discovery, and the coroner turned again to  Sweetwater.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I ask,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you are in a position to tell us to which of these young  gentlemen these several vests belong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  Messrs. Gillespie can be trusted to identify their own property,&rdquo; was the  answer. &ldquo;But I doubt if you will consider this a necessary formality. There is  no scent of bitter almonds lingering about any of these pockets. There was none  on that night. This I made it my especial business to ascertain.&rdquo; And he  glanced at Alfred as much as to say, &ldquo;Thank me for doing you what justice I  can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Such  surprise followed this unexpected acknowledgment from one whose manner had  given promise of a very different result, that it was hard to tell where the  effect was greatest. Hope&rsquo;s veil was shifted again, and the three brothers  looked up simultaneously and with an equal show of relief.</p>
  <p>But  their countenances fell again as they noted the witness still on the stand&mdash;waiting.</p>
  <p>My  countenance fell too, or rather my heart began to throb apprehensively as I now  perceived the face and form of Mr. Gryce slowly appearing round the corner of a  certain jut in the wall where he had held himself partially concealed during  most of the day&rsquo;s proceedings. If this sagacious but sickly old detective thought  it worth his while to come forward, I thought it worth mine to note upon whom  or on what his glance first fell. But I had forgotten his habit, known to most  men who have had anything to do with this celebrated detective. He had looks  for nothing save the umbrella he rolled round and round between his palms;  though his face&mdash;if this indicated anything&mdash;was turned towards the seat where  the three Gillespies sat, rather than towards the witness with whose testimony  past, present, and to come he was probably fully acquainted.</p>
  <p>Meantime  the coroner was speaking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  you failed to find the tell-tale scent of bitter almonds tainting the pockets  of any of the clothes worn by these young gentlemen at the time you searched  them, what did you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  soon as opportunity offered, that is, as soon as I found myself unobserved, I  searched the wardrobes of these young gentlemen for other vests and pockets.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  and did you come upon any article of clothing giving signs of having at any  time come in contact with this pencil or this bottle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  found <i>that</i>,&rdquo; he returned, indicating  a fourth garment, which the coroner now deftly drew forth from the paper where  it had hitherto lain concealed.</p>
  <p>This  garment was a vest like the others, and, like them, of a plain and inconspicuous  pattern. As it was lifted into sight, a groan was heard which seemed to spring  from the united breasts of the three young men behind him. Then one bounded to  his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is my vest,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;What damned villain says there is anything the matter  with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was George. The two other brothers had shrunk back out of sight.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
    The Missing Pocket</b></h2>
  <p>The  excitement was intense. To see suspicion thus suddenly, and, I must say,  deftly, shifted from the man hitherto regarded guilty to one whom nobody had  seemed inclined to doubt, was to experience an emotion of no ordinary nature. I  was so affected by it that I quite forgot myself, and stared first at the vest  thus recognised by its owner, then at the witness, who was calmly awaiting an  opportunity to speak, with deep bewilderment only cut short by the coroner&rsquo;s  abrupt words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  did you find this vest I now hold up before you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the closet of the dressing-room adjoining the apartment where Mr. George  Gillespie is said to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  this dressing-room communicate with the hall or with any other room than the  said Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s sleeping apartment?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it a large room or a small one; a mere closet or a place big enough for a man  to turn about in with ease and do such a thing, say, as change his vest without  being seen too plainly by persons in the adjoining room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a six-by-ten room, sir. If anyone chose to do what you suggest in the  especial corner where the wardrobe stands, he certainly would run little chance  of being seen by anyone sitting near the fireplace of the sleeping apartment.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you speak of the fireplace?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  the evidences are strong that this was where Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s three friends were  sitting when he came up from below, with the half-empty bottle of sherry in his  hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  evidences do you allude to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  fact that we found four chairs standing there about a table strewn with cards.  I did not see the gentlemen in their seats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you did see this vest hanging on one of the nails in the wardrobe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  near nail or a remote one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  remotest in the closet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. <i>Now, what is the matter with this  vest?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  lacks a pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ah!  So that was it!</p>
  <p>The  coroner turned the vest in his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  pocket?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  lower right-hand one, the one where a gentleman usually carries a pen, knife,  or pencil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  has happened to it? How could a pocket be lost from a vest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has been cut out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cut  out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir; we found an open knife lying on the dresser, and if you will look again at  the vest you will see that the missing pocket was slit from it with a very  hasty jerk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  avow&mdash;&rdquo; shouted the voice of the owner from the seats behind.</p>
  <p>But  the infuriated man who thus attempted to speak was quickly silenced.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will be allowed to explain later,&rdquo; remonstrated the coroner. &ldquo;At present we are  listening to Mr. Sweetwater. Witness, what course did you pursue after coming  upon this vest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  endeavoured to ascertain if its owner had gone into his dressing-room after  coming up from the room below.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  we heard sobs; but they were only a child&rsquo;s, and the inquiry went on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you succeed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  request you to call up Mr. James Baxter as a more direct witness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  request being complied with, Mr. James Baxter came forward, and expectancy rose  to fever-point. He was one of the three gentlemen whose voices I had heard over  the cards that were being played in George Gillespie&rsquo;s room during the hour his  father had succumbed to poison. I recognised him at once from his burly figure  and weak voice; having noticed this eccentricity at our first meeting. He was  not sober then, but he was very sober now, and the effect he produced was, on  the whole, favourable.</p>
  <p>Glancing  at George as if in apology, and receiving a tiger&rsquo;s glare in return, he waited  with a certain <i>sang froid</i> for the  inevitable question. It came quickly and with a peremptoriness which showed  that the coroner now felt himself on safe ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  were you sitting when George Gillespie left you to go downstairs for wine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  the card-table near the fire, with my face towards the dressing-room at the  other end of the room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had  wine been passed then, or any spirituous liquors?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were all in a perfectly sober condition therefore?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tolerably  so. Two of us had had dinner at Delmonico&rsquo;s, but I had been dining at home and  was dry. That is why Mr. Gillespie went down for the wine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did you do while he was downstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bet  on the Jack about to be turned up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  much money passed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  ten dollars or so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  when your host returned, what did you do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  guess we drank.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  he drink too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not notice. He put the bottle down and went into his dressing-room. When he  came back he stood a minute by the fire, then he sat down. He may have drank  then. I didn&rsquo;t observe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did he do at the fire? Was he warming himself? It was not a cold night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what he did. I saw a sudden burst of flame, but that was all. I was  busy dealing the cards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  saw a flame shoot up. Was there wood or coal in the grate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Deuce  take me if I remember. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of the fire. I only knew we were  roasting hot and more than once made some movement towards shifting the table  further off, but we got too interested in the cards to bother about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  must have been a lively game. Were you too interested in shuffling and dealing  to notice why Mr. Gillespie went to his dressing-room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I never thought anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  didn&rsquo;t watch him, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cannot  say whether or not he went towards his wardrobe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or,  perhaps, whether the door between you was closed or not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  didn&rsquo;t close the door; I should have noticed that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  long was he in that room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say. Long enough for me to drink my wine and shuffle the cards. Before I  had dealt them he had set down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  question more. Can you truthfully assert he did not cross his dressing-room  before your eyes, change his vest in the corner where the wardrobe stands, and  come back in the same coat, but with a different vest on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I cannot even say what kind of clothes he wore that night. I am no dude, and  all vests, so long as they are not striped or plaid, are alike to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  remark, which was facetious only from the humorous contrast between the small  and highpitched voice and the large and stalwart figure of the speaker, caused  a smile to appear on several faces. But this expression was soon replaced by  one more befitting the occasion, as a change in witnesses once more occurred  and Hewson appeared upon the stand. This old servant of the family was loath to  look at the vest held out before him, and seemed desirous of denying that he  had noticed what his young master had worn at dinner that night. But his precision  and habitual attention to details were too well known for him to succeed in any  evasion, and he was forced to declare that the vest with the thumb mark on the  lining was not the one Mr. George had worn at dinner.</p>
  <p>This  was a fatal admission and George&rsquo;s case was looking very black, when a sudden  cry mingled with a burst of childish sobs was heard in the room, and little  Claire, breaking away from the restraining hands that sought to hold her back,  rushed out in face of coroner and jury, and stretching out her arms to her  father, cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle  George didn&rsquo;t cut the pocket out of his vest. I did. I&mdash;I wanted a little bag  for my beads, and Hetty wouldn&rsquo;t make me one; so I stole into uncle&rsquo;s room and  snipped out the little pocket. It was before grandpa died, and I&rsquo;m so&mdash;so sorry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  fell into her father&rsquo;s arms and was crushed, nay, strained against that father&rsquo;s  breast. Never had a child&rsquo;s naughtiness brought a more perfect joy; while from  floor to ceiling of the great room, cries and shouts of relief went up from the  surcharged hearts of the spectators which for once the coroner failed to  rebuke.</p>
  <p>Possibly  he was as much touched as anyone. There was so much natural impulse, so much  spontaneity in the child&rsquo;s words and actions, that no one could doubt her  candour or the fact that this outburst had been prompted by her own contrition.</p>
  <p>Even  Mr. Gryce accepted the explanation without demur, though he must have realised  that it demolished at a blow the case he had so carefully reared against the  oldest son of Mr. Gillespie. He was even seen to smile benignantly and with a  kind of soothing tenderness on the knob of his umbrella before he rested his  chin upon it in quiet contemplation.</p>
  <p>Hope,  who had made an impetuous movement as the child flew by her, let her eye fall  for a moment on the curly head almost nestled out of sight in the paternal  embrace. Then with a glance at George, scarcely long enough to note the relief  this childish hand had brought him, she let her eye travel slowly on to Alfred,  who, biting his lips to keep down the flush which these rapidly succeeding  events had called up, did not catch her look, precious as it doubtless would  have been to him.</p>
  <p>Then  and not till then did her gaze seek mine.</p>
  <p>Alas!  this recognition of my interest, so eagerly anticipated and so patiently waited  for, was inspired by no deeper sentiment than a desire to gather my present  idea of the situation and what was now to be expected from the baffled  officials.</p>
  <p>If  my answering look conveyed undue confidence in the outcome, I had certainly  sufficient excuse for it in the attitude of those about me. The explanation  which George was able to give of the causes which had led to his changing his  vest on the evening in question were received with respect, if not with favour,  and as it was natural enough to gain credence, enthusiasm in his regard rose to  such a pitch that it presently became evident that it would be next to  impossible to push the case farther before this jury.</p>
  <p>Indeed,  the reaction was so strong that after some futile attempts to reopen the  inquiry on fresh lines, the coroner finally gave in and called for the jury&rsquo;s  verdict.</p>
  <p>It  was, as might be expected:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Death  from the effects of prussic acid, administered by some hand unknown.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
    In The Parlour At Mrs. Penrhyn&rsquo;s</b></h2>
  <p>Meantime,  the will of Mr. Gillespie had been admitted to probate; but as he had never  made any secret of his intentions, and the share and share alike of his sons  had been left without a disturbing codicil, little help was afforded by its  terms in settling the harassing problem which more than ever occupied the minds  of the community and presented itself as an almost unanswerable puzzle to the  police.</p>
  <p>Even  Mr. Gryce, whose sagacity no one could doubt, showed how unpromising the affair  looked to him by the line of care which now made its appearance on his  forehead; a forehead which had remained singularly unclouded till now,  notwithstanding his sixty or more years of experience with such knotty  problems.</p>
  <p>This  I had occasion to note in an interview I held with him some few days after the  rendering of the abovementioned verdict.</p>
  <p>He  had sought me with the intention of satisfying himself that the ground had been  thoroughly gone over, and no possible clue had been ignored. But he gained  nothing new from me, not even my secret, and went away at last, looking older  and more careworn than my first view of his benevolent and naturally composed  countenance had led me to expect.</p>
  <p>But  while moved by this to consider the seriousness with which these men regarded  their duty, I was much more deeply impressed by the corresponding marks of  secret disturbance which I presently discovered in my own countenance. For, in  my case, the trouble indicated did not depend upon the settlement of an  exciting case, but was the result of a lasting impression made upon me by a  woman who gave little sign of sharing a passion likely to prove the one  absorbing experience of my life. Do what I would, I could not forget her or the  position she held among these three men. Was she still the object of George&rsquo;s  attentions or&mdash;worse still&mdash;of Alfred&rsquo;s passionate hopes? Did she respond to the latter&rsquo;s  devotion, or was she still restrained by doubts of an innocence not yet  entirely proved?</p>
  <p>I  longed to know. I longed to see for myself how she bore all these uncertainties.</p>
  <p>But  no excuse offered itself for a second intrusion upon her privacy, even if I had  been sure I should find her still living with her cousins; and in this unrest  and state of anxious waiting, the days went by, till suddenly I heard it  casually mentioned at the Club that Miss Meredith was with a distant connection  of the Gillespies in Fifty-seventh Street.</p>
  <p>This  was like fire to tow. Without waiting to question my own motives or to ask  whether it would be for my happiness or misery to see her again, I called at  the Penrhyn mansion and inquired for Miss Meredith.</p>
  <p>To  my great relief and consequent delight she consented to receive me, and I  presently found myself seated in a choice little reception-room awaiting her  coming. Only then did I begin to realise my own temerity. With what words  should I accost her? How open conversation without suggesting griefs I was burning  to make her forget? I had no time to decide. She was at the door and in the  room before my mind could frame the simplest greeting; and, once brought face  to face with her, I forgot everything but herself and the irresistible charm  which her presence exerted over me.</p>
  <p>She  had been weeping, and I could not but see that the sight of my face recalled  scenes suggestive of the deepest suffering. In my dismay I found my tongue and  attempted some conventional expressions of good-will. These she no sooner heard  than she cut me short by an irrepressible exclamation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pray,&mdash;&rdquo;  she entreated. &ldquo;You have been with me during a time of too much misery for such  formalities as these to pass between us.&rdquo; Then, before I could protest, &ldquo;What  is wanted of me now? I know you desire explanations of some kind; everybody  does who approaches me; even my best friends. Yet I unburdened myself of  everything I knew that first night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  may have looked hurt. I certainly felt so; but she did not notice this result  of her abrupt attack; she was too full of the feverish anxiety roused by the  subject she had herself introduced.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you are a just man and a good one,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I do not need to be told so;  I see it in your face. <i>You</i> will be  honest with me, and will at least acquaint me with the motive underlying any  questions you may put. Others deceive me, and lead me into confidences they afterwards  turn against me or against those I have reason to be true to, though I was the  first to betray them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  cheek, so pale at her entrance, was burning red now, and she spoke quickly,  almost disconnectedly. I saw that she needed rallying, and smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  it is you who are pressing the subject you abhor. I have not asked you  anything; I shall not. I have not come here to satisfy either my curiosity or  the demands of the law. I am here to inquire after your health and to renew my  offer of service. May I be excused for my interest in yourself? It is  involuntary on my part and so sincere that your uncle, were he living, could  not object to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Soothed  by my voice as much as by my words, she sat down and endeavoured to open  conversation. But there was a constraint in her manner which convinced me that  she was labouring under a too vivid remembrance of the scene where we had last  met.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  a position is mine!&rdquo; burst at last from her lips. &ldquo;I have three natural  protectors, yet I do not know of an arm on which I can place my hand with  implicit confidence. This is my reason for being in this house; and why I hail  with eagerness, too great eagerness, perhaps, the prospect of a friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was an appeal for which I found myself poorly prepared, especially as it was  made with such simplicity and in such evident disregard of the feelings which  made my presence there of such import to myself. It recalled to me her  position; and remembering that she was a comparative stranger in town, and that  since her coming she had been all in all to her uncle in capacities which had  kept her much at home and out of the society where she might have made friends  and found support in this dreadful emergency, I composed myself, and, leaning forward,  took her hand in mine with a respect she could not but feel, since it permeated  my whole being.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a stranger to you,&rdquo; was my plea, &ldquo;notwithstanding the vivid experiences  which have brought us together. You know little of me beyond my name and the  fact that my one wish, since first seeing you, has been to serve you and save  you from every possible annoyance. This must be obvious to you, or you would  not have accepted me so unhesitatingly for your lawyer. Will you add to this  title&mdash;a title which you have yourself given me, the more personal one you have  just mentioned? Will you let me be the friend you need? You can find no truer  one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  broke into a confused stammering, amid which I heard: &ldquo;I will. You give me  confidence.&rdquo; Then she sat still, her hand trembling in mine and her eyes  shining with a new light. It was an innocent one, that of a child who has  stumbled on a protector in the dark; but to me it was the very glow of heaven, the  first ray of promise by means of which I could discern, even in fancy, the  fairy-land of my dreams. Was it any wonder it intoxicated me? Forgetting that I  had not been to her all that she had been to me for the last few weeks;  forgetting everything but that she was an unhappy woman whom I passionately  loved, I gazed in her face as a man gazes at a woman but once in a lifetime.</p>
  <p>She  did not lower her eyes; would that she had! but met my looks with a half smile  whose open and indulgent kindness should have warned me to recover my ground  while it was safe. But a sudden madness had seized me, and seeing simply that  it was a smile, I found it impossible to realise in the frenzy of the moment  that the feelings I had hitherto ascribed to her were true. She had liked, not  loved her cousins. They had been good to her, and in return she had given them  a cousinly regard which in one instance, perhaps, approached the warmth of  love. But it was a love far from necessary to her life&mdash;or so I dared dream;  while my passion for her was a part of my being, so close a part that I felt  forced to speak and claim her as my own in this hour of her greatest trouble  and perplexity. Before I knew it; before she had time to restrain me by word or  look, I was pouring out my soul before her. Not in the respectful, measured way  I had foreseen when looking forward to this hour, but wildly, hotly, as a man  speaks when the treasure of his life is to be won by one strong effort.</p>
  <p>It  was sudden; it was perhaps unwarranted; but my sincerity moved her. That was  perhaps why she listened so patiently, and it was to this recognition of my  candid regard I attribute the look of wistfulness which crept over her features  when I ceased.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  she murmured, &ldquo;why cannot I accept the love of this good man?&rdquo; And, rising up,  she walked away from me to the other end of the room.</p>
  <p>Breathlessly  I watched her; breathlessly I noted her walk, the droop of her head, the  agitated working of her hands. Would my good angel stand by me and turn her  trembling heart my way, or must I prepare myself to see her pause, turn, and  come back to me with denial in her looks? The suspense of that moment I shall  never forget. It has never been repeated in my experience. Never since have I  suffered so much in any one moment.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  it was all over. She turned and I read my doom in her sorrowing face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are good,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and it would be an infinite rest to be lifted out of the  agony I am in and be cared for by someone I could perfectly trust. But I cannot  accept a devotion which fails to awaken in me aught but simple gratitude and  friendliness. Unfortunately for me, and perhaps unfortunately for him whom I  cannot trust myself to name, I have given my whole heart&mdash;&rdquo; She choked back the  words with a certain wildness. Then she faced me with mournful dignity and  avowed calmly, and with a certain finality which caused my hopes to sink back into  the depths from which they had so inconsiderately sprung, &ldquo;I have fixed my  heart where perhaps I should not. Pity me, but do not blame.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>I</i> blame, <i>I!</i> who had committed the same  folly, was suffering from the same mistake!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  may be the one true heart amongst them. Sometimes I think he is; sometimes I  think his faults are blemishes upon a nature noble enough for any love and  worship; then doubt comes, horrible, corroding doubt, and I see in him a fiend,  a monster, a being too dreadful to contemplate, much less dream of and adore.  Oh, if I did but know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall know!&rdquo; I burst forth, forgetting my own misery in hers. &ldquo;I have been  selfish in urging my personal wishes upon you when I should have been occupied  with yours. Henceforth I shall think only of you. To see you happy, to see you  at peace, shall be my joy and prove my consolation. I cannot rejoice at the  task, if task it can be called, but from this day on my energies shall be  devoted to the settling of that doubt which, while it exists, robs you of all  peace of mind. If Alfred is the guiltless man we are fain to believe him, you  shall know it. I feel that it is possible to prove him so, and my feelings have  often been very reliable guides in difficult undertakings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  was startled; she was more than startled; she was alarmed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand  you,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What can you do? If the one guilty heart among my cousins  refuses to respond to the appeal made to it by my uncle, how can you hope to  move so callous a soul to a sense of its duty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot. With the hand of the law raised in threat against him, he would be  throwing away his life to proclaim his guilt to anyone now. It would be folly  on our part to expect it. But there are other means by which this question may  be settled. We do not gather figs of thorns or grapes of thistles. Consider,  then, in which of these three breasts the thorns are found thickest; and, if  uncertainty yet remains, to which of your cousins your uncle&rsquo;s death offered  the greatest release.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  I not already asked myself these questions? Have I not repeated them over and  over in my own mind till their ceaseless repetition has well-nigh maddened me?  I think I know George, yet I dare not say he has a heart incapable of crime. I  think I know Alfred and I think I know Leighton; but what certainty can this  imaginary knowledge give me of the integrity of men who hide their best  impulses under wild ways or cloud them with plausible hypocrisies? There is not  an open soul among the three; and unless one of them consents to confess his  crime, we can never feel sure of the two true men who are guiltless. That is, I  never can. I should be haunted by doubts just as I am to-day, and to be  doubt-haunted is misery, the depth of which you cannot judge unless you know my  history.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that I cannot ask for&mdash;&rdquo; I began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  why should I keep it from you? You have earned my confidence. You are, and are  likely to remain, my only friend; then why should I hold back facts well known  to those who come in daily contact with me? I am unfortunate in having a father  who is no father to me. From earliest childhood till I left him to come to New  York, I had never received from either parent a caress which was more than a  formality. My father&rsquo;s lack of sympathy rose from the mortal disappointment he suffered  when, of his two children, it was the girl and not the boy who survived the  illness which prostrated both. My mother&mdash;but I will not talk of her; she has  been dead a dozen years&mdash;only you will believe me when I say that all tokens of  affection were lacking to my childhood and that the first word expressive of  warmth and protection came to me from the cousin who met me at the train the  day I entered upon my new life in my dear uncle&rsquo;s home. Do you wonder this unexpected  tenderness blinded me a little to faults which I had no reason then to think  would ever develop into anything worse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  rose to leave; my self-control was not strong enough for me to bear up against  these repeated attacks. As I did so, I said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Meredith, you have heard my promise. May I be prospered in my undertaking, for  success in it means not only satisfaction to myself but great relief to you.  Why do you tremble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear&mdash;I dread your interference. Sometimes I wish never to know the truth. You  will call me inconsistent, unreasonable. Indeed, I know I am; but what can you  expect from a girl upon whom the blessing of God has never rested?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was a new phase in her nature, the more distressing to me, that, knowing little  of women, I did not understand her. She saw the effect of her outburst, and  melted immediately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  is a bad return for your generosity,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Ascribe it to my weakness and  the dread I feel lest he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  guilty man,&rdquo; I interposed, &ldquo;is not a subject for sympathy. But he whom you love  is not the guilty man,&rdquo; I bravely assured her. &ldquo;Take my word and my hope for  that. A man who could win your regard has no such black spot in his breast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And,  bowing over her hand, I escaped before she could propound any of the many  questions my declared purpose was likely to call up.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
    The Monogram</b></h2>
  <p>I  had made my promise to Miss Meredith with an apparent hopefulness which may  have deceived her, but did not deceive myself. When the glow of my first  enthusiasm passed, I sat down in the solitude of my own room to reconsider the  events of the day, but one thing was clear to me, and that was the unpromising  nature of the task I had set myself to perform. What excuse had I for the  self-confidence I had shown? What means were at my command which were not also  at the command of the police? She herself had asked this same question, and I  had parried it. But I could not parry the demands of my own intelligence. They  must be met and answered. But how? In vain I pondered ways and means; laid  innumerable plans and relentlessly discarded them; projected interviews which I  knew were fruitless, and worked myself through labyrinths of reasoning which  ended in nothing and left me no farther advanced at the end than I was in the  beginning.</p>
  <p>Wearied  at last in mind and body, I retired, and during my sleep had an inspiration  upon which I proceeded to act early the next morning. Revisiting Sam Underhill&rsquo;s  apartment, I told him my difficulty and opened up my scheme. Sam Underhill,  with all his faults and numberless eccentricities, was a good fellow at bottom,  and just the man to respect my confidence. He was, besides, the only person  within the range of my acquaintances who could assist me in the plan I had formed;  a plan which demanded the active cooperation of someone not so well known to  the police as myself. Hampered as I was by my well-known connection with the  Gillespie poisoning case, I could not personally make a move towards the  ravelment of its mystery without subjecting myself to the curiosity of the  people among whom my investigations might carry me, even if I escaped drawing  upon myself the attention of the District Attorney&rsquo;s office and the suspicion  of the men whose business I was in a measure attempting to usurp. But he was a  free agent; he could come and go without arousing distrust or awakening professional  jealousy. At all events he, and he alone, could put me into communication with  the private detective whom I had decided to employ. As I had always been  accustomed to visit Sam&rsquo;s rooms, my presence there at any hour of the day or  night would raise no comment. I had only his laziness to fear, a laziness which  with him was as marked a characteristic as it was with Alfred Gillespie, whom  he so carelessly criticised.</p>
  <p>Seated  with him over an impromptu chafing-dish breakfast, I first tested his good  nature by a sally or two, and finding it well up to the mark, took him, as I  have already said, sufficiently into my confidence to rouse his interest; then  I put the blunt question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  of the three Gillespie boys do you, upon mature reflection, consider the most  capable of the crime attributed to this family?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  manner changed at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  come now!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t calculate upon putting me in that box. Like the  rest of the world I prefer to await developments before committing myself on so  delicate a matter. Why, Outhwaite, prejudice is as bad as the hangman! If I had  settled positively in my own mind which of the three had emptied that phial of  poison into the old gentleman&rsquo;s evening glass, I would not impart my  convictions. These fellows have enough to carry without my throwing the least  weight into so trembling a balance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  girded myself for the struggle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo;  said I; &ldquo;have I fully made clear to you Miss Meredith&rsquo;s position?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I comprehend that well enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  well, then. Which is most important; to assist this unhappy woman to escape  from her anomalous position, or to prevent prejudice from being formed in my  mind, when you know how impossible it would be for me to misuse it to my  advantage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not so sure of that,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know of a fellow more likely to  be carried away by his convictions than yourself. If you were not a lawyer you  would be doing all sorts of quixotic things; but, being hemmed in by  professional conventionalities, you show some restraint, though not enough to  warrant me in trusting you with my opinion on this matter&mdash;since it is only an  opinion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Naturally,  I became eager to know what lay behind this break. Opinions are not formed  without some show of reason, and the lightest reason might suffice to put me on  the track I sought. He saw my resolution in my face, and made an effort to  resist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am as sorry as you are for Miss Meredith,&rdquo; he drawled, helping me to fresh  coffee. &ldquo;If I had seen her the day she gave her testimony I might be sorrier  still; but I did not have that pleasure, and so am willing to leave the matter  with those whose duty it is to see that justice is meted out to the guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think their efforts are likely to be successful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the question will be solved some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  this repetition of the phrase, which I had made forcible by my intonation, he  raised his eyebrows and, emptying his cup before answering, gave me an  opportunity to add:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  nothing to go upon but an accusation which, while involving all three of Mr.  Gillespie&rsquo;s sons, specifies none, how can any official action be taken beyond  that very ordinary one of submitting the whole household to a continual  surveillance? Unless fresh evidence comes in, or conscience drives the guilty  to confession, weeks, months, nay, years will go by, and the hand which  hesitates to move now will hesitate still; justice needing something more  definite to go upon than a suspicion equally divided amongst three men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are right there, but what can you do to better the situation? It appears to me  that you will have to wait too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  contradicts your former assertion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  possibly; man is full of contradictions at so early an hour as this, and with  only one cup of coffee between him and the possible nightmare of the night  before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drink  another cup, then, while I tell you what my hopes are. Guided by impressions  which more than once in my life have proved infallible, I mean to run my man  down till he succumbs to the pressure I will bring upon him, and confesses.  This, I believe, can be done if all my force is concentrated on one man. At all  events it is the only way I see of attaining the desired end. Now, will you  assist me to choose the one out of these three most open to attack?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t like it; it is against all my principles, but if you must know the exact  state of my feelings on this matter, come to these rooms to-night at nine sharp  and I will allow you to hear from the lips of a certain acquaintance of mine a  story which may serve to give you some enlightenment. He&rsquo;s not a man you will  want to meet, so I must ask you to content yourself with an easy chair in my  den. <i>He</i> will be received in this  room, and the door yonder can be left conveniently open. Do you object to this  arrangement? It smacks of conspiracy and other things not altogether agreeable;  but it&rsquo;s the best I can do for you at this time, and poor Yox won&rsquo;t care; it&rsquo;s  your feelings I am mainly considering.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will be here,&rdquo; I doggedly replied. I was resolved to let nothing, not even my  prejudices as a gentleman, interfere with the successful pursuit of this  undertaking. &ldquo;Will his story contain any reference to Miss Meredith?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  the least in the world. Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I always find it difficult to sit still when I hear ladies spoken of in any way  short of the deepest respect; and you say he is not a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t transgress to that degree. If he does, trust to my bringing him to order.  Sorry I must place an embargo on the cigars you will find on the table. Smoking  on your part would give away your presence; for the man whose story you are  coming to hear is one of those fellows who smell a rat round the corner. In  other words, he&rsquo;s a private detective with whom I was once thrown in a peculiar  way. What now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  he&rsquo;s the very fellow I want. I have use for a private detective.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So&mdash;I&mdash;suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  sentence, so long in coming, was uttered in a peculiar way, and at the moment  we were rising from table. Though I said nothing, I experienced an access of  courage. Unpromising as Sam&rsquo;s manner had been, he was really in sympathy with  me, and willing to lend me a helping hand.</p>
  <p>That  day the law suffered, or, rather, I should say, such clients as were misguided  enough to come to my office. The uncertain nature of the disclosure I awaited,  and the doubt as to which of the three brothers it would chiefly affect, kept  me restless up to the hour set apart for my return to Sam Underhill&rsquo;s room. Not  till nine o&rsquo;clock arrived and I found myself in the small apartment called his  den, did I recover my poise and show anything like a steady countenance in the long  mirror stretched above the mantel. This has always been a characteristic of  mine. Great agitation up to the moment of action, and then an unnatural  calmness. In this case it was an event I awaited; but the characteristic  remained unchanged.</p>
  <p>Sam  Underhill, on the contrary, never appeared more at his ease. I could hear him  singing between the whiffs of his cigar, and, as I followed the mellow strains  of one of the finest tenors I have ever known, I recalled the fact that I  myself had not sung a note since the experience which had made such heavy  inroads into my life. Was I growing misanthropic? Sam had not been without his  dark days. I remembered quite well all the talk that went about at the time of  his mad passion for Dorothy Loring,&mdash;that bewitching madcap who afterwards found  her match in Steve Wilson,&mdash;and I could not reconcile that disappointment with  his present gaiety.</p>
  <p>But  these reflections cannot be of any interest to my readers; enough that they  occupied me at the time and killed my impatience, till a sudden stoppage in the  strain I objected to warned me that the expected visitor had arrived. I squared  myself for the ordeal, held my breath, and prepared to listen.</p>
  <p>The  greetings were commonplace. Sam is a proud chap and does not put himself out  much for anybody. To this man he scarcely showed common courtesy. Perhaps he  was afraid of awakening distrust by any betrayal of interest in the coming  interview; perhaps he recognised that a barely civil greeting was all the man  expected or desired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Halloo,  Yox!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  evening, Mr. Underhill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I ask you to call on me to-night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  certainly did, Mr. Underhill, and set the hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  well, I suppose you are correct. Sit down. My memory is not much longer than  this cigar, which you may observe is almost smoked up. Have one, Yox; you won&rsquo;t  get a better in your shop; and now, what have you come to tell me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  much. Dennison bought seven shares last Tuesday and Little invested in as many  more yesterday. Both men show confidence, and to-morrow&rsquo;s report will be all  you can wish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  How much do I owe you? Will that do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  heard a rustle, then a short laugh preceding the remark, &ldquo;You might halve it  and still please me. Oh, I&rsquo;ll take it. Not too much grist comes to my mill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  there was a silence. Underhill was evidently lighting a fresh cigar. When they  spoke again it was to drift into generalities, to which I listened with an  impatience in marked contrast to the complacency of Sam, who seemed just too  tired to live; that is, if I could judge from his tone and the total absence of  interest he expressed in anything said either by himself or his somewhat vulgar  guest. But suddenly there was a change, not in Underhill, whose voice was even  more languishing than before, but in myself; for I heard Sam remark between two  prolonged whiffs:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is that story you were trying to tell me the other night about the row in lower  &mdash; Street? I thought it promised to be interesting at the time, but the other  fellows were in such a hurry I couldn&rsquo;t stay to hear it out. Tell it again,  Yox, just as you did then; perhaps it will wake me up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  answer came more quickly than I expected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that? Well, I don&rsquo;t mind. It was a curious adventure and brought me too near  the police for me to forget it in a hurry. I wish I knew who that fellow was.  Did I show you the match-box I found in one of the pockets of the coat he gave  me? The monogram&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind the monogram. We&rsquo;ll talk about that afterwards,&rdquo; broke in Sam in the  sleepiest tones imaginable. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care so much about the man as the way he  acted. This struck me as being strange for a gentleman. But begin, Yox; you  relate adventures well. I have heard you talk more than once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yox,  who was not above flattery, hemmed, hawed, and launched out in the following  tale. I transcribe his words as nearly as I can remember them. At first he did  not interest me much.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  see, I had business at old Mother Merry&rsquo;s. Do you know the place? It&rsquo;s not  likely, so I will describe it; you need to know something about it in order to  understand my story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  an old fish-market, or, rather, that was its use once; now it&rsquo;s a sort of  lodging-house, standing half on the dock and half on piles, somewhere down near  &mdash; Street. I like the place. That is, it has a mysterious air which we fellows  don&rsquo;t object to. Seen from the docks and in daylight, it has the appearance of  four squat walls without windows. But if you take the trouble to crawl around  on the river side, you will find two glazed loopholes overlooking the water,  one on the lower story and one under the roof. There is also, I am told, a sky-light  or two up above, but I can&rsquo;t swear to that. By night, the one bright glimmer  you see on getting near it shines through the door. This stands open in the  summer, or, rather, the upper half of it does, for it is made in two parts,  like the old Dutch ones you see in the pictures; but in winter time an  agreeable light shines through the four small holes arranged along the top  half. A calico curtain blows in and out of this door on such nights as we have  been having lately; for Mother Merry likes a fire, and the little stove she  sits at, netting, heats the one big room below to smotheration, and the men won&rsquo;t  stand it. If this curtain blows high you can, if you&rsquo;re nervy enough, get a  peep at the inside, stewing with a horrible smell of fish, and bright with  kerosene lamps and the busy little stove. You won&rsquo;t see much furniture, for  Mother Merry don&rsquo;t spend her money on anything she can do without; but there is  a table or two and some chairs, and in one of the corners a door which  sometimes stands half open, but more often is to be seen tight shut. Behind  this door whatever mischief the house hides takes place. You can tell this from  the old woman&rsquo;s eye, which is always on it; and, if you know her well, it is  quite enough to watch her twitching underlip to satisfy yourself as to whether  the mischief is big or little; prosperous in its character, or of a kind likely  to damage her reputation and empty her well-stuffed pockets. She is no fool,  this old Mother Merry; and though she has not much of what we men call nerve,  and trembles like a leaf at the approach of a policeman, she has more control  than you would think over the tough crowd of boatmen who knock their heads together  in that little room. I have even been told that she is feared quite beyond all  reason by the few stray females who find a refuge in the scanty garret rooms,  which have given to this shanty the highfalutin name of lodging-house. What  harm goes on under her twinkling red eye, I do not know. I have been in the  place altogether three times, but have never yet found out what that door  conceals. The men play at some sort of game around a large table, on which  black bottles and thick glasses take up as much room as the cards; but I do not  think it is gambling only which makes it next to impossible for a fellow to get  in there at night. There is something else&mdash;but I won&rsquo;t stop over that. It is a  hell of a place, as you can judge, and unless one&rsquo;s business led him there,  scarcely a spot where a man would brag of being found.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  night&mdash;the night I am telling you about&mdash;I got in, but got in late. There was  some sort of password necessary, and I had a hard time getting hold of it, and  a harder time yet making old Mother Merry hear it when I had got hold of it.  Yet she isn&rsquo;t deaf and doesn&rsquo;t pretend to be. This trouble over, and the door  passed, I encountered another check. A man was there; a slouchy, disreputable  wretch, and it was he, instead of Mother Merry, who was watching that  mysterious door, which for once stood far enough ajar for one room to share the  smells, sights, and uproar of the other. I did not like this man. I did not like  the way he stood, or looked, or held his tongue. There was something peculiar  and unnatural in his whole manner, and I glanced at Mother Merry to see what  she thought of him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Evidently  nothing bad; for she moved about quite comfortable-like, and did not so much as  look at the door I had never before seen her let out of her sight a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Who  can he be?&rsquo; I naturally asked myself, a little put out by my doubts; for my  business would soon take me into the inner room, and I did not like to imagine  myself under his eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Drink!&rsquo;  I suddenly shouted, to see if I could make any impression on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I might as well have shouted at a hitching-post. Mother Merry brought me  whiskey, but the man did not budge. I began to think of putting off my affair  to a more convenient season, when I was taken with a sudden curiosity to see  just what he was staring at.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Approaching  gently, I looked over his shoulder. A portion of the inside room was all I  could see, but in that portion sat a man with a red face and a cruel jaw. It  was this face which held the attention of the boatman before me; and while I  was wondering what he found in it to hold him stock-still for so long, I heard  a sigh escape from under the coarse jacket I dreaded touching with my own, and,  much amazed at this show of feeling in a den of such boiled-down filth and wickedness,  I moved back to where Mother Merry stood, and whispered in her ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s  that man? Do you know him? Has he any business here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  gaunt shoulders lifted in a shrug&mdash;she is far from jolly, cheerful as her name  is&mdash;then she drew near the man and I saw her touch him. At that, or some low  words she uttered, he roused and cast a quick look about him, then he pointed  towards a door on the other side of the room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  answered by a nod, and he moved off with a poor try at a slouchy gait. When I  saw this I knew he was no sailor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  the door closed behind him, a sound of women screaming and scolding came from  the docks, then a child&rsquo;s cry cut into the night, after which there was quiet  in that quarter and in the house, too. For Mother Merry, with a scared look,  jumped towards the room where the men were sitting, and, pushing her way in,  held up her hand so as to draw all eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;The  warning,&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the cops! See if you can get out by the window.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  of the men arose and went to the window, looked out, and came crawling back,  putting out a light as he did so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;They&rsquo;re  on the water,&rsquo; he whispered; and, whether I am a fool or not, that whisper sent  the creeps up my back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Both  front and back?&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;That means business; you&rsquo;ll have to squeeze into  the hole, boys.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Another  light went out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile  I had crept to the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;&lsquo;Ware  there! that fellow&rsquo;s trying to sneak,&rsquo; shouted a voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  drew back. Old Merry came to my aid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t  be a fool,&rsquo; she whispered. &lsquo;Stay here or they&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re in with them!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  growl of some half-dozen of them brought the warning home. I laughed and got in  line with the boys, grumbling aloud as I did so:</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Then  they&rsquo;ll make a mistake. If you are wanted by the cops, I am, too. But how about  that other fellow?&rsquo; I whispered, getting close to Mother Merry in the hubbub.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  didn&rsquo;t hear me; she was telling how something was to be done. Then another  light went out. The place now was in nearly total darkness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo;  came from the doorway where the curtain blew in and out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Hush  and quick,&rsquo; came in hoarse echo from Mother Merry&rsquo;s quivering lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Suddenly  the room was empty. Of the half-dozen drunken figures I had seen moving about  me the minute before, not one was in sight. I heard a creak, then a scuffle,  and then a bang, and the room stood empty. Only a few bottles and a pack or two  of cards were left on the dirty top of the old pine table, as proof that a  tough crowd had been there raising Cain. The old woman cleared the table and  shoved the lot into a cupboard; then she sat down. Never have I seen a woman so  steady and at the same time so frightened.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;There  is room for one more,&rsquo; she quickly said, pointing to where the men had  disappeared. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s over the water, and the floor is full of holes, but the  police haven&rsquo;t got on to it yet. Will you go down?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I  wasn&rsquo;t with the crowd,&rsquo; I told her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;That  won&rsquo;t help you. You&rsquo;re in the house&mdash;Ah!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was almost a cry she gave; the door to the upper rooms had opened and the  sailor who had struck me as such a peculiar chap stood in the room before us. &lsquo;I  forgot,&rsquo; she wailed out. &lsquo;What am I to do with <i>him</i>?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  sailor, who was no sailor, stared straight before him, as well he might, for he  had left a lighted room and found a dark one. Yet in that stare there was a  look of pain easily to be seen by the light thrown out by the red-hot stove. He  didn&rsquo;t mind Mother Merry&rsquo;s cry. He had something else on his mind. He looked  like a man suddenly wakened up, and I had a strange idea that his dreams, if he  had had them, held him just then in a closer grip than the facts he had come  among.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Is  it so late?&rsquo; he sighed; and I started, for the voice was the voice of a  gentleman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  words, and the way he said them, seemed to bring fresh trouble to Mother Merry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Oh,  the ill-luck!&rsquo; she wailed. &lsquo;The cops are at the door. The place has been  threatened for a month, and to-night they are closing round. Will you face them,  or shall I open the trap again&mdash;Oh, don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; she groaned, as he gave a sudden  reel backward; &lsquo;it makes me feel wicked. I ought to have warned you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;It  would have made no difference,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I should still have gone up. Help me,  if you can, and remember what you have sworn. To-morrow I will send money. O  God! O God! to leave <i>now</i>&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;You  cannot leave. Hark, that is the second signal! In another moment they will be  here. Do you want to fall into their hands?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I  had rather die. Quick! Some place! Money is no object. Let that fellow I see  over there help me. He looks as if he wasn&rsquo;t afraid of the police. Let him  change togs with me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I  am a private detective,&rsquo; I whispered, going very close to him in the dark. &lsquo;My  name is Yox, and you will find papers to support the name and business in my  coat pocket. They may hold you for a day, but no longer,&rsquo; and I handed over my  coat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I  am sorry that I cannot confide my name to you with the same ease I do this  coat,&rsquo; he replied, as he threw me the garment which had so disfigured him. &lsquo;But  my name is the secret I would defend with my life. Say that you are Benjamin  Jones.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;First  fork over the cash which you say is no object to you!&rsquo; I cried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;You  must trust me for that,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;If I get off without discovery you will  receive a hundred dollars at your address within the week. I have left all I  had above.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Chaff!&rsquo;  I muttered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;He  will pay,&rsquo; Mother Merry assured me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Then  here&rsquo;s my cap,&rsquo; I grumbled, not any too well pleased.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  took it, and though it was a common one enough, he looked like another man in  it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Support  me in my character!&rsquo; he ordered, just as that blowing curtain was caught and  held back by a hand from without and the face of a policeman looked in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Hey,  there! lamps up!&rsquo; was the order. We got a light flashed over us from the  doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man at my side advanced to meet it, and I saw him talking with the officer who  had pushed his head through the upper half of the door. Then everything about  and before me became mixed in the rush the police made from every side, and I  failed to see anything again for some minutes. When a minute&rsquo;s quiet came about  again, and I had the chance to use my eyes, I did not find the man to whom I  had lent my coat and my name. He had been allowed to slip away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I had no such luck. The place being turned over, and only a few women found,  they turned on me. But I was game, and was soon able to show them I was one of  their own sort. At which there naturally came the question as to who the other  fellow was. But I did not help them out on this, and it ended in my being taken  to Jefferson Market with the rest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  all got off next day and without much trouble. I have always thought that  fellow paid the fines; at all events, one week from that day I found an  envelope addressed to me, lying on my desk at the office. It contained bills to  the amount agreed upon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  Mr. Underhill, who was this man? I have been asking myself that question ever  since I pocketed his money. The fellow who can pay out hundreds like that is a  man to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  waited for the answer, which was slow in coming. But then Underhill was always  slow. When he did speak it was lazily enough.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t  you say you had some clue to his identity; a match-box or something of that  kind, which you found in one of the pockets of the coat he gave you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I have that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that there were initials on it which you had not been able to decipher?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, initials; but what can a fellow make out of initials?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  much, of course. Have you that match-box with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  just have. I sport it everywhere. I think so much of it I have even talked of  having my name changed to fit the letters of this monogram.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me see it, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  fellow drew it out.</p>
  <p>A  minute passed, then Underhill drawled out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not as easy to make out as I expected. Will you let me compare it with a  collection I have in a book here? I may have its mate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sure,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Underhill  came my way. The sudden heat into which I was thrown by this unexpected move  acted as a double warning. I must beware of self-betrayal, and I must take care  not to give away my presence to the sharp-eyed, sharp-eared man whose  perspicacity I had reason to dread. I therefore rose as quietly as possible and  met Underhill&rsquo;s entering figure with a silent inquiry, nicely adjusted to the interest  I was supposed to feel in the matter. He was no less careful, but there was a  sparkle in his eye as he handed over to my inspection the match-box he had just  taken from Yox, which contradicted his air of unconsciousness, and led me to  inspect with great interest the monogram he displayed to my notice. It was by  no means a simple one, as you will see by the sub-joined copy.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700491h-images/page175.png" width="507" height="297"></p>
  <p>As  I studied it, Underhill wrote on a sheet of paper lying open on the table:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have seen that match-box a dozen times.&rdquo; Then, separating the letters of the  monogram, he wrote them out in a string, thus:</p>
  <p align="center"><b>L L  D G</b></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leighton  Gillespie?&rdquo; I inquired in a kind of soundless whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leighton  Le Droit Gillespie,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
  <p>It  was the name with which my own mind was full; the name with which it had been  full ever since the inquest.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
    THE PHIAL</b></h2>
  <p>The  moment was not propitious for a fuller understanding between us. Sam lowered  the light and sauntered back into the outer room, remarking lazily to Yox:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I were you I wouldn&rsquo;t sport this thing around too openly. If judiciously kept  out of sight it may bring you in another hundred some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s  that? You know those initials?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Know  Louis Le Duc Gracieux? Well, rather. But as long as you have not the honour,  keep quiet, lie low, and await events. That is, if you care about the money.  What have you done with the blouse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put  it away in cotton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I see. Well, put the match-box with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  another cigar?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you. I don&rsquo;t often have such a snap. Well, what is it, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you looked as if you wanted something from me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I?  Not the least in the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silence,  then a lazy movement on the part of Sam which disturbed something on the table  at which they were sitting. The small noise had the effect of eliciting another  word from Sam.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought your story had more to it when I heard it last. Didn&rsquo;t you say  something about a small parcel which this mysterious man took out of his pocket  before handing over his blouse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps;  but that wasn&rsquo;t anything. I wonder you remember it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Long  silence on the part of Sam.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never forget anything,&rdquo; he observed at last. &ldquo;Was it a big parcel or a little?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a small one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  small?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  a thing a man could hold in his fist. Why do you ask about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whim.  I am trying to wake myself up. What was the shape of this parcel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bless  me if I&rsquo;ve given two thoughts to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  get that blessing, Yox; for you&rsquo;ve given more than two thoughts to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  or why should you have described it as minutely as you did the other night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly;  I can even recall your words. You said the fellow was pretty well shaken up for  a man of his size and appearance, and after handing you the blouse he caught it  back and took something out of one of the pockets. It looked like one of those  phials the homoeopaths use. You see, you were inclined to be more dramatic on  that occasion than on this. Indeed, I have been a little disappointed in you to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well! a fellow cannot always cut a figure. I&rsquo;ll try to remember the bottle next  time I tell the story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sam  did not answer; I heard him yawn instead. But I did not yawn; that word &ldquo;phial,&rdquo;  had effectually roused me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you say, it is a small matter,&rdquo; Underhill finally drawled. &ldquo;So is the straw  that turns the current. He was a philosopher who said, &lsquo;The little rift within  the lute,&rsquo; etc., etc.&rdquo; Then suddenly, and with a wide-awake air which evidently  startled his companion: &ldquo;Do you suppose, Yox, that Mother Merry runs an  opium-joint in those upper rooms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  answer he received evidently startled him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  may. I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it before, but I remember, now, that when those women  were brought down there was amongst them one who certainly was under the  influence of something worse than liquor. Faugh! I see her yet. But it wasn&rsquo;t  opium he had in that bottle; that is, not the opium which is used for smoking.  The firelight shone full upon it as he passed it from one pocket to another,  and I saw distinctly the sparkle of some dark liquid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sam  Underhill, who seemed to have fallen back into his old condition of sleepy  interest, mumbled something about his having been able to see a good deal,  considering the darkness of the place. To which his now possibly suspicious visitor  replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would have seen more if I had known so much was to be got out of it. Can you  give me a point or two as to how I&rsquo;m to get that extra hundred?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon  Sam retorted, &ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo; in a way to close the conversation.</p>
  <p>As  soon as the man had left I rushed in upon Sam without ceremony. He was still  sitting at the table smoking, and received me with a look of mingled amusement  and anxiety.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did the comedy strike you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>I  attempted a shrug which failed before his imperturbable nonchalance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did it strike you?&rdquo; he persisted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  cleverly carried out, but not so cleverly that the fellow will not suspect it  to be a comedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well! So long as he does not associate the right name with those four initials  we are safe. And he won&rsquo;t; I know Yox well enough for that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you know him for a fool. Louis Gracieux! Who is Louis Gracieux? Besides, the  phial&mdash;why, the whole town is talking about a phial&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know, but not about a match-box that is worth another hundred dollars to the  man holding it. Yox isn&rsquo;t a member of the regular police; he&rsquo;s in business for  himself, which means he&rsquo;s in it for what he can make. Now, he knows&mdash;or, rather,  I flatter myself that I have made him see&mdash;that there is more to be got out of  this matter by circumspection and a close tongue than by bragging of his good  luck and giving every ass about him a chance to chew upon those letters. Oh, he&rsquo;ll  keep quiet now, for a week or two at least. After that I cannot promise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think his version of this affair reliable?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely.  He would have exaggerated more if he had been forcing an invention upon us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  sat down and, regarding Underhill across the table, remarked somewhat  pointedly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  that the name has been mentioned between us, we can talk more openly. What date  have you been able to give to Yox&rsquo;s adventure? You surely have not failed to  get from him the day he went down to Mother Merry&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sam  rose&mdash;he who detested rising&mdash;and, going to a little side table where a pile of  newspapers lay, he pulled off the top one and laid it open before me, taking  care, however, to stretch his arm across the upper margin in a way to cover up  effectually the date.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Read,&rdquo;  said he, pointing to a paragraph.</p>
  <p>I  followed his finger and read out a brief account of the descent which had been  made on Mother Merry&rsquo;s, and a description of the proceedings which had ended in  the release of the women involved.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now  take a look at the date,&rdquo; he went on, lifting his arm.</p>
  <p>I  did so; it was a memorable one,&mdash;the evening of Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s death.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  affair at Mother Merry&rsquo;s took place on the preceding night,&rdquo; commented Sam.  There was no languishing note in his voice now.</p>
  <p>I  sat silent; when I did speak it was plainly and decidedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see what you mean. You think he went to that place to get the acid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sam  puffed away at his cigar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has been a mystery to everyone where that acid came from,&rdquo; I continued; &ldquo;a  mystery which has evidently baffled the police. If a druggist in the whole  range of this great city had lately sold a phial of this poison to anyone  answering the description given of these brothers, we would have heard from him  before now. Equally so if a doctor had prescribed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  second Daniel come to judgment,&rdquo; quoth Sam, sententiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now we, through chance or special providence, perhaps, have stumbled upon a  clue as to how this deadly drug may have entered the Gillespie family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  regret to agree with you, but that is the way it looks. But, Outhwaite, you  must remember&mdash;and as a lawyer you will&mdash;that a long and tangled road lies  between mere supposition and the establishment of a fact like this. This phial,  so carefully transferred from a pocket where a seemingly more valuable article  lay hid, has not been identified as holding poison, only as holding a liquid.  Much less has it been proven to be the bottle found under the clock in the  Gillespie dining-room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  very true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  this fellow&rsquo;s story of&mdash;well, let us say, Louis Gracieux&rsquo; appearance and conduct  in this more than doubtful place, warrants us in thinking the worst of his  errand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  felt the force of this suggestion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  true.&rdquo; I assented. Then, in some agitation, for my thoughts were divided  between the relief which a knowledge of this night&rsquo;s occurrences might bring to  Hope and the terrible results to the man himself, I went on to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  little girl&mdash;you never saw his little girl, Sam. Well, she&rsquo;s a fairy-like  creature, and the last time I saw her she had her arms about his neck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  talk about children,&rdquo; he hastily objected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make a muff of me,&rdquo; and then  I remembered he had a great weakness for children. &ldquo;I had rather you&rsquo;d talk  about Miss Meredith. Nothing but the interest I take in the peculiar position  held by this young lady gives me the requisite courage to stir in this matter.  I have known those boys too long and too well; that is, I have drunk too many  bottles with George and sat out too many nights in full view of Alfred&rsquo;s  handsome figure, stretched out in the mysterious apathy I have alluded to. With  Leighton I have fewer associations; but I have seen enough of him to know  perfectly well the match-box which Yox handed out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you suppose there was anything in those pockets besides the match-box;  anything, I mean, calculated to give away the wearer of that foul blouse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  If there had been; if, in other words, he had found anything there which  suggested a member of the Gillespie family, he would never have aired the  matter in the presence of their friends. He would have gone at once to the  police, or endeavoured to make such capital out of it as such a find would  suggest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you really think he does not know that the tools he is playing with have mighty  sharp edges?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am confident he does not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a relief; yet he cannot remain in such ignorance long if I call him to my  assistance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  depends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How,  depends?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Upon  what you want him to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  this I had no answer. My plans were as vague as the wandering smoke-wreaths  curling upward at that instant from my neglected cigar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have never liked Leighton,&rdquo; I remarked, in the hope of adjusting my thoughts  before entering upon the more serious portion of this conversation. &ldquo;Neither  have I, since surprising a very strange expression on his face the night of his  father&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  three-quarters of the people who knew him would tell you that he is a good man,  a very good man, the best of the three, by far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding  his low associates?&rdquo; I ventured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding  everything. People are so deceived by a few words uttered in prayer-meeting,  that their judgment is apt to be blunted to the real character of a man like  Leighton Gillespie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  must be an odd one,&rdquo; I observed. &ldquo;The lights and shades of such a nature are  past finding out. In appearance and manner he is a gentleman, yet if Yox&rsquo;s  story is true he finds no difficulty in visiting the worst of places under  circumstances and in a garb which bespeaks a personal interest in them. The  nature of that interest we have dared to infer from the part played in his  visit by the mysterious phial. But how account for such instincts, such  murderous impulses in a man brought up as he has been? The motive must have  been a serious one to drive a man of his connections into crime. Can you name  it? Was it the need of money, a craving for perfect liberty to pursue his own  strange courses unchecked, or just the malice of a revengeful spirit cherishing  some rankling grudge, which only the death of its object could satisfy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not ask me. I&rsquo;m not going to supply facts and reasons, too, in this matter.  What! going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I never don my thinking-cap to any purpose save in privacy and under the  influences emanating from my own room and its familiar surroundings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good&mdash;you shall seek such inspiration as is to be found there in just another  moment. But first let me give you a little further insight into the character  of the man we are discussing. This is something I saw myself: One day last fall  I was going down West Broadway when I came upon Leighton Gillespie standing  near an elegant turnout, talking with an ill-shod and bedraggled woman. As philanthropy  is his fad and occurrences of this kind a common affair with him, I was passing  by with no further display of interest than an inward sneer, when I noted his  expression and stopped short, if not from sympathy, at least in some curiosity  as to the woman who could draw it forth. Outhwaite, she was a wild-eyed,  panting creature, with chestnut-coloured hair and nervously working lips; not  beautiful, not even interesting&mdash;to me. But he&mdash;well! I have seen few faces look  as his did then, and when she started to run&mdash;as she presently did, he caught at  the muddy shawl she wore and pulled her back as if his very life depended upon  restraining her at his side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  even saw him take that shawl in his hand&mdash;such a shawl! I would not have touched  it for a champagne supper, and there have been times when he has shown himself  more squeamish on some subjects than I. But he was not squeamish now&mdash;far from  it, for he not only held that shawl, but fumbled with it, almost clung to it,  talking all the while with voluble persistency. At last he asked her some  questions which brought out a passionate refusal. But if discouraged, he did  not show it; on the contrary, he continued his plea with increasing earnestness,  and finally pointed to his carriage. She gave it one look and shrank back with  a gesture of fear; then she grew steadier and her head fell forward on her  breast. He went on pleading with her; and then I saw a strange sight. With an  air such as only a swell like himself is capable of assuming, he signalled to  his driver to draw up at the curbstone before him. Then, as he might hand in  one of the four hundred, he handed her in and took his seat beside her. Not a  look to the right nor left,&mdash;he was simply the perfect gentleman; and, obnoxious  as he had always been to me up to that hour, I could not but respect his manner  if not himself. It was admirable, and so was that of the man who sat upon the  box. Though the latter must have cringed when that disreputable foot struck the  step and what might be called a bundle of rags entered among his pearl satin  cushions, he did not turn a hair or lose a jot of that serene absorption in his  own affairs which characterises all the Gillespie coachmen. I watched him expressly  to see. A valuable fellow that, for a master of the eccentric tastes of  Leighton Gillespie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  interest me,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Did you watch them drive off?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and stood there staring till they were half down the block, for she had not  accepted the situation with the same ease as himself, and I felt that something  would happen. And there did. Before the polished panels were lost to my sight,  the door burst open and I saw her wild figure jump out and plunge away in the  direction of the river. This time he made no attempt to follow her; the  carriage rolled on and he with it. Nor did he do what I would have done,&mdash;let  the door stand open till the air of that carriage had been purged of its late unwholesome  occupant. Altogether, it was an odd experience. What do you make out of it,  Outhwaite?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  a fellow who will bear studying. Is he always so respectful to the paupers he  befriends?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sam  shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have related my sole experience with Leighton Gillespie in his <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of philanthropist. My other  memories of him suggest simply the millionaire&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>

    I Make My First Move</b></h2>
  <p>To  attempt to fathom such a nature as this leads to little but mental confusion.  Before I had spent a half-hour in trying to untangle the knotty problem offered  by Leighton Gillespie&rsquo;s opposing characteristics, I decided to follow the  example of my friend Underhill, and keep to facts.</p>
  <p>These  in themselves were startling enough to occupy my mind and convince me  absolutely of Leighton&rsquo;s guilt. But this was not convincing Miss Meredith.  Probabilities, possibilities even, which might satisfy me, would count for but  little with her. With her nice sense of justice, she would demand a positive  and unbroken chain of evidence before she would allow herself to acknowledge  the guilt of the man whose innocence I presumed to challenge, and this clear  and unbroken chain I did not have. How, then, could I strengthen the evidence  just obtained? Not by showing motive. There seemed to be no motive. To be sure,  Leighton was in debt,&mdash;so were they all,&mdash;and he was known to have quarrelled  bitterly with his father more than once. But these were not new facts, nor were  they sufficiently condemnatory to settle, even in her mind, the torturing  question embodied in that one word already alluded to: which?</p>
  <p>Something  of an absolutely criminating character must be found against this man; some  proof so direct and unanswerable that even her scrupulous conscience would be  satisfied; something like positive evidence, say, that he had visited Mother  Merry for the purpose of obtaining in secret the poison he dared not buy openly,  or that the glass of sherry he poured out for his father had held poison as  well as wine.</p>
  <p>As  all attempts to establish this latter fact had proved abortive; as the police  had not only failed to prove that such a mixture had been made, but to settle the  exact medium by means of which Mr. Gillespie received the poison, I turned my  attention to the easier task and decided to concentrate my energies upon  establishing the fact that the bottle carried from Mother Merry&rsquo;s by the  would-be sailor contained prussic acid, and that this would-be sailor was  positively the man we supposed him to be,&mdash;Leighton Gillespie.</p>
  <p>With  these facts indubitably established, even Miss Meredith must feel that the man  who could be guilty of obtaining a deadly drug through such under-handed  agency, and at such a risk to his reputation, must have had a purpose in so  doing which could only be explained by the tragedy which took place in his home  so soon afterwards.</p>
  <p>This  point reached in my meditations, I next asked myself how the necessary  inquiries could be started without risk to their success. I could not go openly  to Mother Merry, or, rather, it would be undesirable for me to do so. If, as I  sometimes suspected, I was myself under surveillance, I could make no such move  without attracting the attention of the detectives to a matter which I hoped to  keep a sacred secret between Hope and myself. Remember that I was not working  to bring the guilty to justice, but to free a pure heart from a soul-torturing  doubt.</p>
  <p>But  if I could not go there myself, whom was I to send? What man of my acquaintance  was judicious enough to be entrusted with such a message? Yox? I did not like  the man. I looked upon him as a very shady individual and shrank with strong  distaste from further contact with him. Underhill? I laughed at the suggestion.  Who, then? Not a single name rose in my mind till, by an association of ideas  not entirely illogical, I remembered the habits of certain members of the  Salvation Army, and how easy it would be for one of them to enter such a vile haunt  as Mother Merry&rsquo;s and interview the depraved beings to be found there without  attracting the notice of the police or rousing the least suspicion as to their  intentions. But could I reach such a man, and, if I could, would I find him  willing to undertake such an errand without understanding its full purport and  just what use was to be made of the knowledge thus obtained? This seemed very  doubtful, and I was seriously deliberating over my next move, when my mind flew  straight from the topic engaging it to that memorable moment in my experience  when, amid the alarm and hurry following the suspicions expressed by the  physician called in at Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s death, the glass fell from Hewson&rsquo;s hand  and broke into a hundred pieces on the dining-room hearth. The tinkle made by  the shattered glass, the gasp which escaped the old man&rsquo;s lips, all came back  to me, and with it the startling conviction&mdash;strange that it had not struck me before!&mdash;that  this old and tried servant of a disrupted household knew who had tampered with  that glass, and by this sudden breaking of the same had sought to shield him.  Now, if I should find out that this man regarded Leighton with an especial  fondness&mdash;But such thoughts were for further contemplation. With a resolution  born, perhaps, of the lateness of the hour, I forced my mind back into its  former channel and resolutely asked myself how a connection was to be  established between Mother Merry and myself. The small confidence I have always  had in third parties, especially when a matter of delicate inquiry was to be  pushed, made it imperative for me to see her myself. Yet how&mdash;Ah! an idea. What  if I took the bull by the horns and openly requested the assistance of the  police in my adventure? That would disarm suspicion and render me independent  of special surveillance.</p>
  <p>The  idea was a happy one, and, relieved by the prospect it offered, I resigned  myself to sleep.</p>
  <p>Next  day I went boldly to police headquarters and asked for assistance in making  some inquiries in a dangerous quarter of the town. I said that the case then  before me necessitated some evidence which could only be gathered from a  certain old woman whose name and place of living I had yet to learn by  judicious questioning in that quarter of the city where she had been last seen.  Would they give me a man to make my projected tour safe? They would. Could I  have him now? I could.</p>
  <p>Satisfied  with the result of my first move, and more than satisfied with the  unintelligent appearance of the man they picked out to escort me, I made for  Mother Merry&rsquo;s, but not in a direct course or with any appearance of knowing  where I was going. I tried several lodging-houses and chatted across several  bars, and, noting the indifference with which my thick-headed companion  followed me, I really began to cherish hopes of coming through my task without  any unpleasant consequences to myself. Sometimes he tried to help me; but as I  had given no names and confined myself to a somewhat vague description of the  person I wanted, this help was naturally futile, and I found myself approaching  my goal without any seeming advance having been made. Should I proceed at once  to the docks or should I play the fox&rsquo;s game a little longer? As I weighed  these alternatives my eyes fell on a Salvation Army sign, and the idea I had  scouted the day before returned to me with renewed force.</p>
  <p>Pointing  to the windows across which it was displayed, I said that here were people who  might possibly tell me where to find the woman I sought, and, leaving the  officer outside,&mdash;he seemed quite content to stay in the fresh air,&mdash;I went in  and respectfully approached the sweet-faced woman I saw before me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am come for assistance,&rdquo; I began. &ldquo;I am in search of a woman&mdash;&rdquo; Here the words  died in my throat. Opposite me and quite near enough for me to catch what they  were saying, I saw two men. One was a Salvation Army Captain and the other was  Leighton Gillespie.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
  </b>The Little House In New Jersey</h2>
  <p>The  surprise was great, but I doubt if I betrayed the fact to the unsuspicious eye  of the patient lass who attended me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish to see one of your captains,&rdquo; I explained. &ldquo;I will gladly await his  convenience.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain  Smith will be at liberty soon,&rdquo; she answered, going back to her work.</p>
  <p>I  was thus left to study the face of the man whom at that very moment I was bent  upon connecting with a great crime.</p>
  <p>I  had not seen him since that touching scene at the inquest; and I found him  looking both older and sadder. Perhaps his health was broken; perhaps there  were other and deeper reasons for the great change I saw in him.</p>
  <p>I  had instinctively withdrawn a few steps when the lass left me and stood in as  inconspicuous a position as possible, with my face turned from the light. But I  had not retreated far enough to lose a word of the conversation going on so  near me.</p>
  <p>They  were discussing an approaching meeting; Leighton with deep interest, the  Captain with an embarrassment not often seen in one of his calling. Listening,  I heard these words.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be a full one, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  from Leighton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  usually is on a day like this,&rdquo; was the hesitating reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  women come?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;More  women than men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like to speak at the meeting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Captain, with an uncomfortable flush, fumbled with the ribbon on his cap, and  said nothing. Leighton repeated his request.</p>
  <p>The  Captain summoned up courage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry, sir,&rdquo; he remarked, in an apologetic tone. &ldquo;You have given the Army  much help, and we have listened to many good words from you, but I have  received orders not to let you speak again; that is, from the platform.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  painful silence ensued. Then Leighton remarked, with a forced composure and  something more than his usual melancholy:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  of the unhappy prominence given me by the circumstances attending my father&rsquo;s  death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,  and something else. I may as well be frank, sir. We have heard of the little  house, leased under your name, in New Jersey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  chord had been touched which vibrated keenly in this mysterious breast. I saw  his hand go to his throat and fall again quickly. Meantime the Captain went on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  are not frightened by sin and we hold out our hands to sinners; but we have no  use for a man who prays in New York and has his pleasure on the other side of  the North River. It shows hypocrisy, sir, and hypocrisy is the enemy of  religion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  smile, whose dark depths betrayed anything but hypocrisy at that moment,  crossed Leighton&rsquo;s pale lips as he remarked without anger (which I could not  but consider strange in a man so openly attacked):</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  little house is empty now. Has the thought struck you that my heart might be so  too?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Captain, who evidently did not like his task, seemed to experience some  difficulty in answering; but when he had settled upon his reply, spoke both  clearly and with resolution:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  house of which you speak may lack its occupant just now, but everything goes to  show she is always expected. Or why are the lamps invariably lighted there at  nightfall, the rooms kept warm, and the larder replenished? Some birds in  flitting come round again to their forsaken nest. Your bird may; meanwhile the  nest remains ready.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo;  The tone was sharp now, the words cutting. &ldquo;You do not understand me nor my  interest in the poor and forsaken. As for my place among you, let it be filled  by whom you will. I have my own griefs, and they are not light, and I have  anxieties such as visit few men. A ban is upon me and upon all who bear the  name of Gillespie. This is known to you and possibly to every man and woman  soon to assemble here. Perhaps you do well not to submit me to their curiosity.  But there is something you <i>can</i> do for  me&mdash;something which you will do for me, I am sure; something which would place  me under lasting obligation to you without doing you or anyone else the least harm  in the world. A woman may come in here; a woman, wild-eyed, unkempt, but with a  look&mdash;I am sure you will know her. There is an unearthly loveliness in her wan  features. She has&mdash;But what use is there in my attempting to describe her? If  she answers to the name of Mille-fleurs&mdash;some persons call her Millie&mdash;she is the  woman I seek. Will you give her this?&rdquo; (He had torn the edge off a newspaper  lying near and was rapidly writing on it a few words.) &ldquo;It will do no harm to  the cause for which you are working, and it may save a most unhappy woman. Of  myself I make no count, yet it might save me, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  handed over to the Captain the slip carelessly folded. It was received with  reluctance. Mr. Gillespie, noting this, observed with some agitation:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are here to do God&rsquo;s work. Sometimes you are called upon to do it blindly and  without full enlightenment.&rdquo; And having emphasised this with a bow of  remarkable dignity he went out, little realising that the possible clue to his  own future fate lay in the hands of one he at that moment passed without a  look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;These  are the crosses we are called upon to bear,&rdquo; spoke up the Salvation Army  Captain as the door closed upon the man they had once held in deepest  reverence. &ldquo;Now, what am I to do with this?&rdquo; he added, turning over in his  hands the half-rolled-up slip which had just been given into his charge.</p>
  <p>Involuntarily  my hand went out to it. It was a perfectly unconscious action on my part, and I  blushed vividly when I realised what I had done. I had no authority here. I was  not even known to the good man and woman before me.</p>
  <p>The  Captain, who may or may not have noted my anxiety, paid no heed either to my  unfortunate self-committal or to the apologetic question with which I  endeavoured to retrieve myself.</p>
  <p>Turning  to the lass beside him, he handed her the slip, with the look which a man gives  to a woman on whose good sense and judgment he has come to rely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  it, Sally,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You will know the girl if she comes in, and, what&rsquo;s more,  you&rsquo;ll know how to manage the matter so as to give satisfaction to all the  parties concerned. And now, sir?&mdash;&rdquo; he inquired, turning towards me.</p>
  <p>But  at this instant a diversion was created by the arrival of Detective Sweetwater,  a man for whose presence I was certainly little prepared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  gentleman who has just gone out passed you something,&rdquo; he cried, approaching  the lass without ceremony, though not without respect. Me he did not appear to  see.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  gentleman left a note with us for one of the poor women who sometimes straggle  in here,&rdquo; was her quiet response. &ldquo;He is interested in poor girls; tries to reclaim  them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sorry,&rdquo; protested the detective &ldquo;but I must have a glance at what he wrote.  It may be of immediate importance to the police. Here is my authority,&rdquo; he  added in lower tones, opening his coat for a moment. &ldquo;You know under what  suspicion the Gillespie family lies. He is a Gillespie; let me see those lines&mdash;or,  stay, read them out yourself&mdash;that may be better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young woman hesitated, consulted the Captain with a look, then glanced down at  the slip trembling in her hand. It was half unrolled, and some of its words  must have met her eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you think this has anything to do with the serious matter you mention?&rdquo; she  ventured to ask.</p>
  <p>The  detective approached his mouth to her ear, but my hearing did not fail me even  under these unfavourable circumstances.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything  has connection with it,&rdquo; I heard him say. &ldquo;Everything they do and think. I  wouldn&rsquo;t trust one of them round the corner. I should make the greatest mistake  of my life if I allowed any secret communication written by a Gillespie to pass  under my nose without an attempt to see what it was. This one may be of an  innocent nature; probably is. The gentleman who left it with you passes for a philanthropist,  and as such might very readily hold communication with the worst characters in  town without any other motive than the one you yourselves can best appreciate.  But I must be sure of this. I have been detailed to watch his movements, and  his movements have brought him here. You will therefore oblige me, Miss, if you  can make it clear that the cause of justice&mdash;by which I mean the cause which I  here personally represent&mdash;will not suffer injury by the free transmission of  this slip to the person for whom it is meant.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will read you what he has written here,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;He left it open or  almost open to anyone&rsquo;s perusal.&rdquo; And I heard her read out, in low but  penetrating tones, the following words:</p>
  <p>When  I last saw you, you were suffering. This is an unbearable thought to me, yet I  cannot go to you for reasons which you can readily appreciate. Come to me,  then. The house is always open and the servants have received orders to admit  anyone who asks for me.</p>
  <p>This  was certainly warm language from a mere philanthropist to a city waif whose  misery had attracted his notice. But no remarks passed, and Sweetwater did not  seek to hinder even by a look the careful refolding of the slip and the putting  of it away in the young lass&rsquo;s desk. Indeed, he seemed to approve of this, for  the next moment I heard him say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right; take good care of the slip. If the young woman comes in, give it to her.  I suppose you know her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all; he simply described her to us; or attempted to. She may not come in at  all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  keep a grip on those lines. What kind of a person did he say she was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know. He said she was wild-looking, but beautiful, and that she  answered to some such name as Millie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  likely to be a fake, the whole mess. Good-day, Captain; good-day, Miss.&rdquo; And  Detective Sweetwater stepped away.</p>
  <p>I  had thought him keen, yet he had paid no more attention to me than if I had  been a stick. Was the corner in which I sat darker than I thought, or had he  been so full of his own affairs that he failed to recognise me? I had kept my  face turned away, but he assuredly must have known my figure.</p>
  <p>When  he was gone the two laid their heads together for a moment, then began to  bustle towards me. In the meantime I had planned a <i>coup d&rsquo;etat.</i> I had considered if, by a little acting on my part, I  could put them in the wrong, I might succeed in getting from them some positive  facts to work upon. Accordingly, I was in a state of suppressed feeling when  the Captain found himself face to face with me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  heard you,&rdquo; said I, flinging down the book I had taken up. &ldquo;I have ears like a  hare and I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I know Mr. Gillespie, and it made my blood boil to  hear him addressed with suspicion. How anyone who has ever heard him speak to  the poor and unfortunate could associate him with the atrocious death of his  father, I cannot imagine. So good to poor girls! So bountiful in his charities!  I thought you were Christians here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Captain may have been a Christian, but he was also a man, and, being a man,  looked nettled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was a mistake for us to discuss Army affairs within reach of two such sharp  ears,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Mr. Gillespie has done some good work, and far be it from me  to add myself to those who have associated his name with the crime which has  just made the family notorious. I simply fail to stand by him because he uses  us as a cloak for his personal indulgences. He is infatuated with a woman whom  he has never presumed to present to his family. This won&rsquo;t do for us. The other  matter belongs to the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  allowed myself to cool down a trifle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon; you know your own business, of course. But it&rsquo;s a little hard  for me to believe that such a refined man as Mr. Gillespie could find any other  than a charitable interest in any woman likely to come straying in here. Did  you ever see his home, his child, his friends?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  Captain shrugged his shoulders and curtly replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can imagine.&rdquo; Then in a tone calculated to end the interview so far as this  topic was concerned: &ldquo;We count nothing as strange in this place, sir. We come  too near the unregenerate heart. Human nature&rsquo;s the same, sir, in rich and in  poor. And now, sir, your business? It&rsquo;s most time for our noon meeting, so I  must ask you to be concise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had almost forgotten I had any business there, but I pulled myself up under his  eye and told him I was on the search for a woman, too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  she&rsquo;s an old one,&rdquo; I made haste to assure him; &ldquo;a lodging-house keeper who is  in the possession of evidence of great importance to a client of mine. Her  name, as told me, is Mother Merry; do you know any such person?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  did not, but informed me that there were several queer old places down by the  wharves where I might hear of her. This was enough. I had now an excuse for  penetrating the district towards which I had been pointing from the first.</p>
  <p>Thanking  him, and asking his pardon for my few brusque words, I went out, and, giving my  policeman a wink, turned in the direction of the river.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
    Mille-Fleurs</b></h2>
  <p>The  complications which had surrounded Leighton Gillespie were, through his own  imprudence, in the way of being cleared up, though hardly to his advantage.  This was not all. Either from indifference or ignorance&mdash;I hardly thought it was  indifference&mdash;he had not only called attention to his own secret passion, but  laid such a trap for the object of it that she could hardly fail to fall  ultimately into the hands of the police.</p>
  <p>Under  these circumstances was it my duty to proceed with the task I had imposed upon  myself? Was my help needed when Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s right-hand man was at work? It  would not seem so. But&mdash;as I was happy enough to remember before my hesitation  resolved itself into action&mdash;the one clue connecting him to this murder was to  be found in my hands, not theirs. I alone knew where to look for the woman who  had procured him the phial of poison. This in itself created an obligation I  dared not slight. I must continue my quest, if I desired to fulfil my promise  to Hope Meredith.</p>
  <p>The  day was Friday and the fish-stalls were doing a lively business. By the time I  had threaded my way through innumerable sheds, I had got enough of this  commodity into my nostrils to satisfy my appetite for a week. I was glad when I  stepped out upon the wharf.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  it along there you want to go?&rdquo; asked the officer under whose protection I  moved.</p>
  <p>I  looked, and saw fluttering before me the calico curtain which had blown in and  out of Yox&rsquo;s story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  if it&rsquo;s where an old woman named Merry is to be found.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  ask.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  approached a brother officer whose presence I had not noticed, spoke to him,  and came back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the place,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Do you want me to go in with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  if it&rsquo;s safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s safe enough at this hour. You haven&rsquo;t any too much cash on you, I judge?  Besides, I&rsquo;ll hang about the door, and if you don&rsquo;t come out in ten minutes I&rsquo;ll  just inquire the reason why. You see, the place&rsquo;s on our books and we don&rsquo;t want  to keep too open an eye on it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was glad to be allowed to go in alone. I had not dared to hope for this and  felt correspondingly relieved.</p>
  <p>An  unexpectedly quiet interior met my eye. The bare walls, the busy stove, the  woman whose gaunt frame and lowering eye I had heard described by Yox, were  before me, but nothing of a sinister, or even suspicious, appearance. I had  surprised Mother Merry&rsquo;s quarters at a happy hour; that is, happy for her and  possibly so for me.</p>
  <p>But  perhaps I convey a wrong impression in speaking of the walls as bare. They were  not so; for, stretched from side to side of the steam-reeking, stifling room,  were lines on which coarse garments were hanging up to dry; and on the wall  directly before me I saw a pair of rough seaman&rsquo;s breeches, pinned up in a  ghostly and grotesque fashion over the little stove which even on this mild  afternoon was doing its best to keep out undesirable visitors.</p>
  <p>The  old woman, who was bending over a table on which a few broken victuals lay,  was, without doubt, Mother Merry herself; and, recognizing her as such, I  assumed the half-audacious, half-deprecatory manner I thought best calculated  to impress her. With a broad smile, I thrust my hand into my pocket. Then as I  perceived her hard eye melt and the coarse lines about her mouth twist into  something which was as near encouragement as one could expect from a being  always on her guard against strangers, I whispered with a careful look about  me:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyone  here? My errand won&rsquo;t stand peering eyes or listening ears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  gave me a penetrating glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you want?&rdquo; she grumbled.</p>
  <p>I  took out a dollar and laid it on the table. Her hand was over it in an instant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  morsel of drug,&rdquo; I whispered. &ldquo;Three drops of something that&rsquo;ll do up a man in  five minutes. The man is myself,&rdquo; I added, as her eye darkened.</p>
  <p>She  continued to regard me intently for a minute; then cast a quick glance down at  the hand which covered the coin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo;  she muttered, with a reluctant lift of that member; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not in the way of  getting any such stuff. Who sent you to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  hesitated, then made my great venture.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man you helped out of here the night the police came down on you. He had better  luck than I. You didn&rsquo;t refuse it to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  lie!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
  <p>Startled  by these uncompromising words, I fell back. Had I made a great mistake?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  never got any such stuff from me,&rdquo; she went on shrilly. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t what he  came for, or else he made more of a fool of me than I knew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did he come for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  look of inquiry turned into one of suspicion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you come here to ask that? If so, you&rsquo;d better go. I&rsquo;m not one of the blabbing  sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  drew out another dollar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  he got it upstairs,&rdquo; I insinuated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  she cried, spreading out her long fingers so as to cover both pieces. &ldquo;That may  be; those girls have strange ways with them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I have a peep at them? May I have a peep at <i>her</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  emphasis I placed on the last word called out from Mother Merry a long stare,  which I bore as best I could.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  hasn&rsquo;t a drop left of what you were talking about,&rdquo; said Mother Merry at last. &ldquo;If  she gave it to him it&rsquo;s all gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  she can get more where she got that,&rdquo; I made bold to suggest.</p>
  <p>The  old hag gave a grunt and looked gloatingly at the coins sparkling between her  bony fingers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  many of these have you saved up?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  with ten dollars in your pocket you come here for <i>poison</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  amazement was quite real. Ten dollars in my pocket and wanting poison! It took  her some minutes to grasp the fact; then she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how many of these are for <i>me</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  pawed at the coins till they were well under her palm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  call her down; will that do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  may not be just right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  may be all right herself and not think you so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  risk that, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  stand near the stove so she won&rsquo;t see you when she first comes in. She wouldn&rsquo;t  stay a minute if she did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Obeying  the old hag, I watched her sidle to the door already familiar to me in Yox&rsquo;s  narrative; the door upstairs, I mean. As she disappeared behind it I glanced at  the table near which she had been standing. The two silver dollars were gone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  never see them again,&rdquo; was my inward decision.</p>
  <p>And  I never did.</p>
  <p>The  presence of the wet clothing hanging so near me was anything but agreeable.  Moving around to the other side of the stove, I at least avoided some of the  fumes which in that stifling atmosphere were almost insufferable; but I was  more exposed to view, something which the old woman noticed when she re&euml;ntered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have moved,&rdquo; she suspiciously snarled. &ldquo;Come back and let the clothes hide you.  Perhaps I can make the girl sing if she don&rsquo;t see you. She seems to be in one  of her queer moods. Would you like to hear her sing?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  the old woman evidently expected an enthusiastic assent I gave it with as much  force as I could muster up on such short notice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!  she is coming. You mustn&rsquo;t mind her laugh.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was well she gave me this warning, for the sudden wild shout of hilarious mirth  which I now heard from the region of the staircase was so startling, that  without these words of caution I might have betrayed myself. As it was, I kept  my post in silence, watching for the girl who I had every reason to believe had  given the bottle of prussic acid to Leighton Gillespie. Would she prove to be  the wild, unkempt woman whose beautiful look he had endeavoured to describe to the  Salvation Army Captain? I hoped not; why, I hardly knew.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  there broke upon my eyes a sight I have never forgotten. A woman came in&mdash;a  woman, not a girl&mdash;and while her look was not beautiful&mdash;far from it&mdash;she had that  about her which no man could see for the first time without emotion. Her  features were ordinary when taken by themselves, but seen together possessed an  individuality whose subtle attraction had been marred, but not entirely  destroyed, by the countless privations she had evidently undergone. And her  hair, wild and uncared-for though it was, was wonderful; so was the air of vivacity  and rich, exuberant life which characterised her. Though her cheek was pale and  her arms thin, she fairly beamed with that indefinable but spontaneous gladness  which springs from the mere fact of being alive, a gladness which at that  moment did not suggest drugs or any unwholesome source. I was astounded at the  effect she produced upon me, and watched her eagerly. No common unfortunate,  this. Yet it would have been hard to find among the city&rsquo;s worst a woman more bedraggled  or more poorly nourished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sing!&rdquo;  cried old Mother Merry, with an authority against which I instinctively  rebelled, though I had seen the object of it for only a couple of minutes. &ldquo;You  feel like it, and I feel like hearing you. SING!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  woman&rsquo;s throat throbbed. She stopped just where she was and threw out her arms.  Then she smiled and then&mdash;she sang.</p>
  <p>I  have heard Guilbert, I have heard Loftus, but neither of them ever made my  temples throb, my heart swell, or my breath falter as this woman did. That she  chose the saddest of all sad songs&mdash;she who a moment before seemed hardly able  to contain her laughter&mdash;could not quite account for this effect; nor the fact  that these flights of tragic melody rose from out a misery which no laughter  could cover up. It was genius, great and wonderful genius, misdirected and  lost, but still heaven-given and worthy of an artist&rsquo;s recognition. As she sang  on I yielded her mine, for my heart swelled almost to bursting, and when she  had finished and stood poised, rapt, ecstatic, enthralled with her own melody  and beautiful with her own feeling, I found my cheeks wet with tears. I had  never wept at anyone&rsquo;s singing before.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dance!&rdquo;  came in fresh command from the miserable hag behind me.</p>
  <p>I  had forgotten Mother Merry.</p>
  <p>But  the raised face I was contemplating drooped forward at these words, and the  arms, which had moved all through the singing, fell inert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have no strength,&rdquo; she wailed. Yet in another instant she was swaying, turning,  rising, and falling in mazes of movement so full of grace and charm that I  scarcely missed the music which should have accompanied them. It was more than  a dance: it was a drama; instinctively I followed her feelings and knew as by a  species of revelation what each motion was meant to convey. I watched her as I would  some charmed being; for the marks of care had vanished from her features, and  the lips, which had been drawn and white, burned redly, and the hair, which had  hung in dishevelled locks, now blew out in live curls, athrill with passion and  breathing forth rapture and love. Suddenly she paused. Mother Merry had pointed  me out with the words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  gentleman is looking at you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instantly  her beauty shrivelled and vanished. Her hands went up to her face; and she  crouched like a lost thing against the floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no!&rdquo; she wailed, and would have fled, but Mother Merry forced her back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  gentleman wants something. He wants a drop of what you gave the other one that  night. You remember, the night the boys slid away and left us to the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Instinctively  her right hand went to her bosom and her eyes looked wildly into mine. Suddenly  she saw the moisture on my cheeks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  he&rsquo;s been crying, Mother Merry, been crying. Perhaps now I can cry, too. I  should like to; it&rsquo;s better than singing.&rdquo; And she broke into sobs so violent  that I stood aghast in mingled pity and amazement.</p>
  <p>Just  then the policeman looked in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  now?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  impulse was to shield her from this fellow&rsquo;s curiosity. Motioning him away, I  whispered in her ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  haven&rsquo;t said whether you would give me what I have come for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  drop of what kills trouble; kills it at once, instantly, and forever. I am  wretched, heartbroken.&rdquo; (God knows I spoke the truth.)</p>
  <p>She  stared, and what remained of light in her face went out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have none&mdash;now,&rdquo; she hoarsely assured me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  get it where you got that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot. I got that when it was easier to smile, and dancing was not followed by  dreadful pain. Now&mdash;&rdquo; She tried to laugh as she had a few moments before, but  her jocund mood had passed. One would never imagine from her present aspect  that she had just floated through the room an embodiment of joyousness and  grace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  gave it all to him, <i>all</i>?&rdquo; I  questioned.</p>
  <p>The  emphasis did not strike her, or rather it assumed a different place in her mind  than on my lips. &ldquo;To him?&rdquo; she repeated, shrinking back with evident distrust.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I pursued, following her and speaking in her ear; &ldquo;the sailor lad who took it  away from here that night. Poison&mdash;prussic acid&mdash;a phial you could hide in your  hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  broke into laughter, not the expression of joy, but that of defiance if not  derision. She was but a common woman now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sailor  lad!&rdquo; she repeated, and laughed again.</p>
  <p>I  felt that the moment had come for speaking the significant word. Looking around  and seeing that Mother Merry was not too near, I whispered:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  sailor lad with a gentleman&rsquo;s name. You know the name; so do I&mdash;Leighton  Gillespie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  had not expected me to go so far. Smothering a frightened cry, she struck her  hands together over her head and dashed towards the door by which she had come  in. Mother Merry stood before it laughing. Then she turned to escape by the  street; but there she was confronted by the heavy form of the policeman, who  had thrust himself across the threshold. Crouching, she folded her arms over  her breast and made a plunge for the door communicating with the den beyond. It  opened under her pressure and she fell gasping and bruised upon the threshold.  I hastened to her aid, but she was up before I could reach her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know the man you talk of; I don&rsquo;t know you. I am a free woman! a&mdash;free&mdash;woman!&mdash;&rdquo;  she shrieked, bounding to the trap and opening it. As she uttered the last  words she swung herself down. I tried to stop her, but she was as agile as a  cat. As I leaned over the hole I saw her disappearing among a confusion of oozy  piles; and shuddering with the chill of the mephitic air that came pouring up,  I drew back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the end of her for to-day,&rdquo; muttered the harsh voice of Mother Merry behind me.  &ldquo;When she&rsquo;s like that you might as well make for other quarters. But you&rsquo;ve had  your money&rsquo;s worth. You&rsquo;ve heard her sing; you&rsquo;ve seen her dance. It&rsquo;s not  every man can boast of that. She&rsquo;s shy of men; at least she&rsquo;ll never sing for  them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Perhaps  I looked surprised; perhaps I only looked dejected. Misinterpreting the  expression, whichever it was, old Mother Merry sidled up closer, and, as I made  for the door, whispered with a leer:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you really want what you say, come back in a week; and if I can get it you  shall have it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  gave her another coin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you call that girl?&rdquo; I asked, with my hand on the latch.</p>
  <p>The  money made her loquacious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Millie,&rdquo;  she answered. &ldquo;That is not how she speaks it, but it&rsquo;s how we all call her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was, then, as I had thought. I had seen and listened to Mille-fleurs, the woman  to whom Leighton Gillespie had addressed those appealing lines.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_22"></a>Chapter 22<br>
    A Disagreeable Hour With A Disagreeable Man</b></h2>
  <p>This  interview made an astonishing impression upon me. Never had I supposed myself  capable of being stirred to such sympathy by a being so degraded as this  wonderful Mille-fleurs.</p>
  <p>Was  it the contrast between her genius and the conditions under which that genius  had shown itself? Possibly. Or was it that a recognition of the latent  sweetness underlying her wild nature had caused a feeling of rebellion against  the degradation into which a creature of such amazing possibilities had fallen?</p>
  <p>Whatever  it was, I was conscious of a haunting sense of regret such as had followed few  experiences in my life, and began to look upon the man who could make use of  such a ruin of womanhood for the obtaining of a deadly drug, with something  deeper and more active than mere distrust.</p>
  <p>Leighton  Gillespie was a man of the world. He knew this wretched creature&rsquo;s weak points  and what would procure him the poison he dared not buy from any druggist or  chemist. Anyone who saw this woman could read her story. Gay as she was,  buoyant as her spirit rose in certain moments of ecstatic passion, she had  corresponding moods of morbid depression, possibly of actual suffering, which  only morphine could relieve. He knew this and used his knowledge without let or  scruple. Was he a monster of selfishness, or only another instance of a good man  gone to the bad for the love of a worthless woman? The latter theory seemed the  more probable, since all good instincts could not be lacking in a man who had been  confessedly helpful in many ways towards rescuing the needy and aiding the  unhappy.</p>
  <p>Undone  by a woman! Was that the situation? It is a common one, God knows. Yet I found  it hard to allot her the place suggested by this theory. She did not look like  one capable of inclining a man to murder. Yet might I not be playing the fool  in cherishing so generous an estimate of her? Might I not be as yet too much  under the spell of her peculiar grace to rightly judge the nature underlying  it? What did I know of him or of her, that I should burden him with all the  blame; and in what did my own wild, uncalculating passion for a woman who not only  did not love me, but of whose real character I knew little save as it shone for  me through her captivating face, differ from the feeling which might easily be  awakened in a still more ardent breast by a creature of so much grace and fire?</p>
  <p>Certainly  the words I had overheard Leighton Gillespie use in his colloquy with the  Salvation Army Captain showed the existence of feelings far beyond those  usually associated with a commonplace passion; so did the lines he had left  behind him for this waif. But if it was love which moved him, it was a love  which did not shrink from involving its object in crime. This she had herself  recognised, else why had she shown such terror at the mention of his name and  made such a hazardous attempt at escape when threatened by the prospect of further  association with him?</p>
  <p>The  progress which I had made in the case I had undertaken against this man may seem  to have reached a point justifying me in communicating the result to Hope. But  though I had succeeded in supplying one of the missing links heretofore  mentioned as necessary to that end, I nevertheless hesitated to approach her  till the whole chain was complete. Her very desire to believe her youngest  cousin innocent would make her slow in accepting conclusions too much in the line  of her own wishes. She might even now be moved by secret hopes in this  direction, might cherish convictions and calm herself with soothing  anticipations of restored confidence in Alfred, but she would require the most  positive evidence that the potion, however and by whomever obtained, had been  actually and knowingly administered by Leighton. To the establishment of this  last link in the chain, I must therefore address myself; an almost hopeless  task, from which I shrank with very natural misgivings.</p>
  <p>Two  paths of inquiry, and two only, offered any promise of success. One of these  struck me as practicable; the other not. But the practicable one was not within  my reach, while the other was little more than a dream. I allude in the first  instance to the knowledge supposed to lie hidden within the breast of the old  butler; while the dream&mdash;well, the dream was this: For some time I had suspected  the existence of a secret and as yet unknown witness of this crime, a witness  for whose appearance on the scene I had daily looked, and from whom I did not  yet despair of gleaning valuable testimony. What basis had I for this dream? I  will endeavour to explain.</p>
  <p>In  presenting to your notice a diagram of the parlour floor of the Gillespie  house, I was careful to show the window to be found at the left of Mr.  Gillespie&rsquo;s desk. But I drew no attention to this window, nor did I think it  worth my while to say that I found the shade of this window rolled up when I  first followed Claire into the room. Later, I drew this shade down, but not  before noticing that a window stood open in the extension running back of the  Gillespie yard from the adjoining house on Fifty- &mdash; Street, and that in the  room thus disclosed a man was to be seen moving uneasily about.</p>
  <p>Now,  if this man had been in that room for any length of time, the chances were that  his glances had fallen more than once on the brilliantly lighted interior of  Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s den, lying as it did directly under his eye. If so, how much or  how little had he seen of what went on there? That is what I now proposed to  find out.</p>
  <p>That  this person, who was a total stranger to me, had given no sign of being in the  possession of facts withheld from the police, did not deter me from hoping that  I should yet learn something from him. Many men, among them myself, have an  invincible dislike to the publicity inseparable from the position of witness,  and if this unknown man imagined, as he naturally might, that the police were  ignorant of the opportunity which had been given him of looking into Mr.  Gillespie&rsquo;s house at a moment so critical, the chances were that he would keep silent  in regard to it. That his appearance at the window had been simultaneous with  my sight of him, and thus too late for him to have seen more than I did of what  went on in Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s den, was a possibility which would occur to any man.  Also, that he might have been there and in full sight of the window from the  first, yet had distractions of his own which kept him from making use of his opportunities.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless,  the probabilities were favourable to the hope I had conceived; and, deciding  that in my present uncertainty any action was better than none, I made up my  mind to ascertain who this young man was, and whether any means offered for my  making his acquaintance.</p>
  <p>Sam  Underhill was the only man I knew capable of bringing this about. I therefore  went below in search of him, and was fortunate enough to come upon him just as  he was returning to his room for some theatre tickets he had forgotten to put  into his pocket. I attacked him before he could back out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the name of those people who live in the first house west from Fifth Avenue  on Fifty- &mdash;Street?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember the house I mean? That very  narrow brown-stone front, with a vase of artificial flowers in one of the  parlour windows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;  me if I know,&rdquo; he protested, in a high state of impatience, as he snatched up  the tickets he was looking for. Then, seeing that I was in no condition to be  fooled with, he admitted that the name was Rosenthal, and carelessly added, &ldquo;What  do you want to know for? Oh, I see, you are still on the scent; still harping  on that Gillespie poisoning case. Well, the Rosenthals may live near the people  just mentioned, but there&rsquo;s nothing in that for you or anyone else interested  in this crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  they move in a totally different set from the Gillespies. They have absolutely  no connection with them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  there a young man in the family?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I want to know him. Find a way of presenting me to him, will you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sam&rsquo;s  amazement was amusing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  want an introduction to Israel Rosenthal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have said so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  everyone to his taste. I&rsquo;ll procure you one this evening at the theatre. He&rsquo;s a  great patron of the Lyceum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  are you going there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  soon as you release me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good; expect to find me in the lobby after the first act.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  obliged to you.&rdquo; This because I had moved out of his way. I have seen Sam when  he was personally more agreeable to me.</p>
  <p>It  would be impossible for me to say what play I saw that night. It was one of the  well-known successes of the season, but it meant nothing to me. All my mind and  attention were on the young man I had come there to see.</p>
  <p>He  was in one of the boxes; this I found out before the first act was over; and  though I caught flitting glimpses of his face, I did not see him closely enough  to form any judgment of his temper or disposition. When the first act was over  I went into the lobby, but Sam did not join me there till it was nearly time  for the curtain to rise again. Then he came alone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll  be out at the end of the third act,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;The wait is a long one and  he will be sure to improve it in the usual way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  nodded and Sam went back. Strange to say, he was interested in the play, if I  was not.</p>
  <p>I  had no intention of forcing an immediate disclosure from Mr. Rosenthal. Neither  the time nor place was propitious for that. When, therefore, the anticipated  moment arrived and Sam sauntered out from one aisle and Rosenthal from another,  I merely pulled myself together to the point of making myself agreeable to the  rather unpromising subject of my present interest. We were introduced offhand  by Sam, who, if he did not like the job (and it was very evident he did not), at  least went through his part in a way not to disturb the raw pride of my new  acquaintance. Then we began to talk, and I thought I saw more than ordinary  satisfaction in the manner with which young Rosenthal received my advances, a  satisfaction which led me to mentally inquire whether his pleasure rose from  gratification at Underhill&rsquo;s attention or from any erroneous idea he may have  had of my being a stepping-stone to certain desirable acquaintances. Or, more important  still, was he, for reasons I was not as yet ready to dwell upon, glad to know a  man whom all recognised as an important witness in the great affair whose  unsolved mystery was still the theme of half the town? I curbed my impatience  and was eagerly pursuing the conversation towards a point which might settle  this disturbing question, when, presto! the curtain rose on the fourth act and  he flew to regain his box.</p>
  <p>But  not before Sam, with a self-denial I shall not soon forget, had asked him round  to our apartments after the play; which invitation young Rosenthal seemed glad  to accept, for he nodded with great eagerness as he disappeared around the  curtains of the doorway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  much to humour a friend!&rdquo; growled Sam, as he, too, started for his seat.</p>
  <p>I  smiled and went home.</p>
  <p>At  about midnight Sam came in with my expected guest, and we had a rarebit and  ale. In the midst of the good feeling thus established, Rosenthal broke forth  in the very explanation I had been expecting from the first.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  say! you were with old Gillespie when he died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  fact is well known,&rdquo; I returned, refraining from glancing at Sam, though much  inclined to do so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;ve a mighty curiosity about that case; seems somehow as if I had had a hand  in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was champagne on the table; I pushed the bottle towards Sam, who proceeded to  open it. While this was going on I answered Mr. Rosenthal, with all the  appearance of surprise he doubtless expected:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s  that? Oh, I think I understand. You are a neighbour. All who live near them  must feel somewhat as you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; he protested, draining his glass, which Sam immediately refilled. &ldquo;I  have never told anyone,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why I tell you fellows,&mdash;but I was almost  in at that death. You see, the windows of my room look directly down on the  little den in which he died, and I chanced to be looking in its direction just  as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  he stopped to enjoy his second glass. As the rim slowly rose, obscuring his  eyes, I caught an admiring Hm! from Sam, which filled, without relieving, this  moment of suspense. As the glass rang down again on the table, Rosenthal  finished his sentence:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;just  as Mr. Gillespie lifted his window to empty out a glass of something. Now, what  was that something? I have asked myself a dozen times since his death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  this is evidence! This is a fact you ought to have communicated to the police,&rdquo;  broke in Underhill, with momentary fire. Perhaps it was a real one, perhaps it  was the means he used to draw Rosenthal out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  be dragged up before a thousand people, all whispering and joggling to see me?  No, I have too much self-respect. I only speak of it now,&rdquo; said he with great  dignity, &ldquo;because I&rsquo;m so deuced curious to know whether it was poison he threw  out, a dose of chloral, or just plain wine. It might have been any of these  three, but I have always thought it was the first, because he seemed so afraid  of being seen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Afraid  of being seen drinking it or of throwing it out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Throwing  it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sam  and I stopped helping ourselves to wine and left the bottle to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you know what time this was?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  how should I? It was before ten, for at ten he was dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  could not have been poison he threw out or even the remains of it,&rdquo; I remarked,  &ldquo;for that would imply suicide; and the verdict was one of murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Rosenthal was just far enough gone to accept this assertion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  so. I wonder I never thought of that before. Then it must have been wine. Now,  I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought so badly of Mr. Gillespie as that. I always considered  him a sensible man, and no sensible man pours wine out of a window,&rdquo; he  sapiently remarked, raising his glass.</p>
  <p>It  was empty, and he set it down again; then he took up the bottle. That was  empty, too. Grumbling some unintelligible words, he glanced at the cabinet.</p>
  <p>We  failed to understand him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are but two excuses for a man who deliberately wastes wine,&rdquo; he proceeded, in  tipsy argument with himself. &ldquo;Either he has had enough&mdash;hard to think that of  Mr. Gillespie at so early an hour in the evening&mdash;or else the liquor&rsquo;s bad. Now,  only a fool would accuse a man like Mr. Gillespie of having bad liquor in his  house, unless&mdash;unless&mdash;something got into it&mdash;Oh!&rdquo; he suddenly exclaimed, with the  complacency of one who has unexpectedly made a remarkable discovery, &ldquo;there <i>was</i> something in it, something which  gave it a bad taste. Prussic acid has a bad taste, hasn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;and not liking  the taste he flung the wine away. No man would go on drinking wine with prussic  acid in it,&rdquo; he mumbled on. &ldquo;Now, which of those fellows was it who poured him  out that wine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  sat silent; both bound that he should supply his own answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  ought to know; I&rsquo;ve read about it enough. It was the slick one; the fellow who  goes by me as if I were dirt&mdash;Oh, I know; it&rsquo;s Leighton! Leighton!&rdquo; And he  stumbled to his feet with a sickening leer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going down to the police station,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to inform the  authorities&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  to-night,&rdquo; I protested, rising and speaking somewhat forcibly in his ear. &ldquo;If  you go there to-night they will shut you up till morning&mdash;jail you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  laughed boisterously. &ldquo;That would be a joke. None of that for me. I&rsquo;ll see them  dashed first.&rdquo; And he looked at us with a sickly smile, the remembrance of  which will make me hate him forever. Suddenly he began to search for his hat. &ldquo;I  think I&rsquo;ll go home,&rdquo; he observed, with an air of extreme condescension. &ldquo;Leighton  Gillespie, eh? Well, I&rsquo;m glad the question is settled. Here&rsquo;s to his health!  and yours&mdash;and yours&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was gone.</p>
  <p>We  were both on our feet ready to assist him in his departure. But he got away in  good shape, and when the lower door slammed we congratulated each other with a  look. Then Sam seized the bottle and I the glass from which this fellow had  drunk, and both fell crashing into the fireplace. Then Sam spoke:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  fear Leighton Gillespie will sleep his last sound sleep to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must consider the drivel we have just listened to as of some importance, then,&rdquo;  I declared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Taken  with what Yox told us, I certainly do,&rdquo; was Sam&rsquo;s emphatic reply.</p>
  <p>The  sigh which escaped me was involuntary. If this was Sam&rsquo;s opinion, I must  prepare myself for an interview with Hope. Alas! it was likely to bring me  sorrow in proportion to the joy it brought her.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
  </b>In My Office</h2>
  <p>It  was with strange reluctance I opened the paper next morning. Though I had no  reason for apprehending that my adventure of the day before had been shared by  anyone likely to give information in regard to it, the consciousness of holding  an important secret is so akin to the consciousness of guilt, I could not help  dreading some reference to the same in the sheet I now unfolded. I wished to be  the first to tell Miss Meredith of the new direction in which suspicion was  pointing, and experienced great relief when, upon consulting the columns  usually devoted to the all-engrossing topic of the Gillespie poisoning case, I came  upon a direct intimation of the necessity, now universally felt, of holding  Alfred accountable for his father&rsquo;s death, as the only one of the three who had  shown himself unable to explain away the circumstantial evidence raised against  him.</p>
  <p>This  expression of opinion on the part of the press had been anticipated too long by  Miss Meredith for it to prove a shock to her. I therefore did not commit myself  to an early interview, but went at once to my office, where important business  awaited me.</p>
  <p>I  was in the midst of a law paper, when I was warned by a certain nervous  perturbation fast becoming too common with me, that someone had been admitted  to my inner office and now stood before me. Looking up, I saw <i>her</i>.</p>
  <p>She  wore a thick veil, and was clad in a long cloak which completely enveloped her.  But there was no mistaking the outlines of the figure which had dwelt in my  mind and heart ever since the fateful night of our first meeting, or the  half-frightened, half-eager attitude with which she awaited my invitation to  enter. Agitated by her presence, which was totally unexpected in that place, I  rose, and, with all the apparent calmness the situation demanded, I welcomed  her in and shut the door behind her.</p>
  <p>When  I turned back it was to meet her face to face. She had taken off her veil and  loosened her cloak at the neck; and as the latter fell apart I saw that the  left hand clutched a newspaper. I no longer doubted the purpose of her visit.  She had seen the article I have just quoted, and was more moved by it than I  had expected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must pardon this intrusion,&rdquo; she began, ignoring the chair I had set for her. &ldquo;I  have seen&mdash;learned something which grieves&mdash;alarms me. You are my lawyer; more  than that, my friend&mdash;I have no other&mdash;so I have come&mdash;&rdquo; Here she sank into a  chair, first drooping her head, then looking up piteously.</p>
  <p>I  tried to give her the support she asked for. Concealing the effect of her  emotion upon me, I told her that she could find no truer friend or one who  comprehended her more intuitively; then with a gesture towards the paper, I  remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are frightened at the impatience of the public. You need not be, Miss Meredith;  there are always certain hot-headed people who advocate rash methods and demand  any bone to gnaw rather than not gnaw at all. The police are more circumspect;  they are not going to arrest any one of your cousins without evidence strong  enough to warrant such extreme measures. Do not worry about Alfred Gillespie;  to-morrow it will not be his name, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a leap she was on her feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whose?&rdquo;  she cried, meeting my astonished gaze with such an agony of appeal in her great  tear-dry eyes, that I drew back appalled.</p>
  <p>It  was not Alfred, then, she loved. Was it the handsome George, after all, or  could it be&mdash;no, it could not be&mdash;that all this youth, all this beauty, nay, this  embodiment of truest passion and self-forgetting devotion, had fixed itself  upon the unhappy man whom I had just decided to be unworthy of any woman&rsquo;s  regard.</p>
  <p>Aghast  at the prospect, I plunged on wildly, desperately, but with a certain restraint  merciful to her, if no relief to me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;George,  too, seems innocent. Leighton only&mdash;&rdquo; Yes, it was he. I saw it as the name  passed my lips, saw it even before she gave utterance to the low cry with which  she fell at my feet in an attitude of entreaty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  she murmured, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say it! I cannot bear it yet. No schooling has made me  ready. It is unheard of&mdash;impossible! He is so good, so kind, so full of lofty thoughts  and generous impulses. I would sooner suspect myself, and yet&mdash;oh, Mr.  Outhwaite, pity me! Every support is gone; everything in which I trusted or  held to. If he is the base, the despicable wretch they say, where shall I seek  for goodness, trustworthiness, and truth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had no heart to answer. So it was upon the plainest, least accomplished, and,  to all appearance, least responsive as well as least responsible, of Mr.  Gillespie&rsquo;s three sons she had fixed her affections and lavished the warm  emotions of her passionate young life. Why had I not guessed it? Why had I let  George&rsquo;s handsome figure and Alfred&rsquo;s lazy graces blind me to the fact that  woman chooses through her imagination; and that if out of a half-dozen suitors  she encounters one she does not thoroughly understand, he is sure to be the one  to strike her untutored fancy. Alas! for her when, as in this case, this lack  of mutual understanding is founded on the impossibility of a pure mind  comprehending the hidden life of one who puts no restriction upon the worst  side of his nature.</p>
  <p>These  thoughts were instantaneous, but they made a dividing line in my life.  Henceforth this woman, in all her alluring beauty, was in a way sacred to me,  like a child we find astray. Raising her from the appealing posture into which  she had sunk, I assured her with as much gentleness as my own inner rebellion  would allow:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have not trusted him yourself, or you would let no newspaper report drive you  here for solace.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  cringed; the blow had told. But she struggled on, with a feverish desire to  convince herself, if not me, of the worth of him she loved so passionately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know&mdash;it was my weakness&mdash;or his misfortune. He had given me no cause&mdash;no real  cause&mdash;his eccentricities&mdash;my uncle&rsquo;s impatience with them&mdash;my own difficulty in  understanding them&mdash;little things, Mr. Outhwaite, nothing deep, nothing  convincing&mdash;I cannot explain&mdash;shadows&mdash;memories so slight they vanish while I seek  them&mdash;I would have given worlds not to have been shaken in my faith, not to have  included him for a minute in the accusation of that phrase, &lsquo;one of my sons&rsquo;;  but I am over-conscientious, and because the one I trusted&mdash;lived by, had not been  exonerated by his father, I did not dare to separate him from the rest, in the  doubts his father&rsquo;s accusation had raised. It would have been unjust to them,  to the two who cared most for me&mdash;the two&mdash;&rdquo; Here her voice trailed off into  silence, only to rise in the sudden demand: &ldquo;What has occasioned this change in  public opinion? What have the police discovered, what have you discovered, that  he should now be singled out&mdash;he against whom nothing was found at the inquest&mdash;who  has a child&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  who allows himself to lead a double life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  said this with a purpose. I knew what its effect must be upon so pure a soul,  and I was not surprised at the emotion she displayed. Yet there was something  in her manner as she pressed her two hands together which suggested the  presence of a different feeling from the one I had expected to rouse in  launching this poisoned arrow; and, hesitating with new doubt, I went  falteringly on:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  men show a very different face in their homes and before their friends than in  haunts where your pure imagination cannot follow them. The life lived under  your eye is not the one really led by the melancholy being you have watched  with such sympathetic interest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  did not seem to follow me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo; Her indignation was so strong that she leaped to her feet and  eyed me with a manifest sense of outrage. &ldquo;You speak as if you meant something  I should not hear. <i>He!</i> Claire&rsquo;s  father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a difficult task. Surely my lines had fallen in untoward places. But there  was no doubt about my duty. If her fresh, unspoiled heart had made its home in  a nest of serpents, it was well she should know her mistake before the shame of  the discovery should overwhelm her.</p>
  <p>Turning  aside, so that I should not seem to spy upon her agitation, I answered her as  such questions should be answered, with the truth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Meredith,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;when I undertook to sift this matter, and if possible bring  to light some fact capable of settling the doubt that is wearing away your  life, I hoped to relieve your heart and restore your faith in the one cousin  most congenial to you. That I have failed in this and find myself called upon  to inflict suffering rather than to bring peace to your agitated heart is a  source of regret to myself which you can never measure. But it cannot be  helped. I dare not keep back the truth. Leighton Gillespie is unworthy your  regard, Miss Meredith, not only because he lies under suspicion of having  committed the worst sin in the calendar, but because he has deceived you as to the  state of his own affections. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;  Her voice was peremptory; her manner noble. &ldquo;I wish to say right here, Mr.  Outhwaite, that Leighton Gillespie has never deceived me in this regard. I have  cared for him because&mdash;because I could not help it. But he has never led me into  doing so by any show of peculiar interest in myself. George has courted me and  Alfred nearly has, but not Leighton; yet to him my whole heart went out, and if  it is a shame to own it I must endure that shame rather than injure his cause  by leaving you under the influence of a prejudice which has no foundation in  fact.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Before  the generosity of this self-betrayal I bowed my head. Her beauty, warm and  glowing as it was at this moment of self-abandonment, did not impress me so  much as the mingled candour and pride with which she exonerated this man from  the one fault of which she knew him to be innocent. It gave me a new respect  for her and a shade more of forbearance for him, so that my voice softened as I  replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  well, we will not charge him with deliberate falsehood towards you, only with  the madness which leads a man to sacrifice honour and reputation to the fancied  charms of an irresponsible woman. He is under a spell, Miss Meredith, which I  will not attempt to name. The object of it I have myself seen, and it was from  her hand (possibly without her understanding the purpose for which he wanted  it, as she has no appearance of being a really wicked woman) that he obtained  the poison which did such deadly work in your uncle&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  worst was said; and the silence that followed was one never to be forgotten by  her or by me. When it was broken, it was by Hope, and in words which came in  such starts and with such pauses, I could only guess their meaning through my  own identification with her shame and grief.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Calumny!&mdash;it  cannot be!&mdash;so good&mdash;so thoughtful in his bringing up of Claire&mdash;that day he  pulled her aside lest she should stumble against the little boy with the broken  arm. It is a dream! a horrible dream! He depraved? he a buyer of poison?&mdash;no,  no, no, not <i>he</i>, but the evil spirit  that sometimes possesses him. Leighton Gillespie in his true hours is a man to  confide in, to regard with honour, to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  no longer made an effort at listening. She was not addressing me, but her own  soul, with which for the moment she stood apart in the great loneliness which  an overwhelming catastrophe creates. She did not even remember my presence, and  I did not dare recall it to her. I simply let her lose herself in her own  grief, while I fought my own battle, and, as I hope, won my own victory. But  this could not last; she suddenly awoke to the nearness of listening ears, and,  flushing deeply, ceased the broken flow of words which had so worn upon my heart,  and, regaining some of her lost composure, forcibly declared:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are an honest man, Mr. Outhwaite, and, I am told, a reliable lawyer. You have  too much feeling and judgment to malign a man already labouring under the  accusation which unites this whole family in one cloud of suspicion. Tell me,  then, do you positively know Leighton to have done what you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;  was my short but suggestive reply.</p>
  <p>Instantly  she ceased to struggle, and with a calmness hardly to be expected from her  after such a display of feeling, she surveyed me earnestly for a moment, then  said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me the whole story. I have a reason for hearing it, a reason which you would  approve. Let me hear what you learned, what you saw. It is not to be found in  the papers. I have only found there a general allusion to him calculated to  prepare the mind for some great disclosure to-morrow&mdash;&rdquo; And her hand tightened  upon the sheet which I now discovered to be the one morning journal I had  failed to see. &ldquo;You will pay no attention to my feelings&mdash;I have none&mdash;we are  sitting in court&mdash;let me hear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Respecting  her emotion, respecting the attitude in which she had placed me, I did as she  requested. With all the succinctness possible, I told her how I had been led to  go to Mother Merry&rsquo;s and what I had discovered there. Then I related what we  had learned from Rosenthal. The narrative was long, and gave me ample  opportunity for studying its effect upon her.</p>
  <p>But  she made no betrayal of her feelings; perhaps, as she had said, she had none at  this moment. With her hand clenched on her knee, she sat listening so intently  that all her other faculties seemed to have been suspended for this purpose;  only, as I approached the end, I noticed that the grey shadow which had hung  over her from the first had deepened to a pall beneath which the last vestige  of her abounding youth had vanished.</p>
  <p>My  own heart grew heavy as the gladness left hers, and I was nearly as desolate as  she when I made this final remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is all, Miss Meredith. I as truly believe that Leighton Gillespie bought the  bottle of poison from the girl he called Mille-fleurs as if I had seen him  laying the money down before her. But Rosenthal&rsquo;s admissions you must take at your  own valuation. He says he saw your uncle, with backward looks and signs of  secret fear and disturbance, pour out something from a glass on to the  grass-plot underneath his open window. Was it the wine which had been given him  by Leighton, and did he do this because of the drug he had detected in it?&mdash;a  drug, alas! so fatal, it was not necessary for him to drink the full glass in  order to succumb to it? That is a question you must answer in your mind from  the knowledge you have of your uncle and his family.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was a hope held out in this last phrase which I expected to see her embrace.  But she did not; on the contrary, her depression remained unchanged and she  said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew my uncle well. He was a just man, and, in times of great danger, a cool  one. He would never have written for my eyes those four words&mdash;&rsquo;one of my sons&rsquo;&mdash;unless  some new fact had added certainty to his former conviction. The drug was in the  wine handed him by Leighton; we must accept that fact whatever it may cost us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  calmness amazed me. For the last few minutes she seemed upborne by some secret  thought I could neither fathom nor understand.</p>
  <p>But  suddenly her old horror returned with the recurrence of some old memory. &ldquo;Then  it was his hand that stole towards my uncle&rsquo;s glass in the dark!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;that  murderous, creeping hand, the vision of which has haunted me night and day  since I heard of it. Oh, horrible! horrible! What a curse to fall upon a man!  It is the work of the arch-fiend. Poor Leighton! poor Leighton!&rdquo; she cried in  her agony.</p>
  <p>Bowing  her head, she sobbed bitterly, while I surveyed her in amazement. I did not  understand her. She seemed to be weeping for Leighton, not for herself; at all  events she did not show the repulsion I expected from her in face of such  monstrous depravity. Was the fascination he exerted over her so great that she  could not weigh at their proper value characteristics so entirely evil? It did  not seem possible. Yet there she sat mourning for him, instead of crushing the  very thought of him out of her heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I comprehend it all now,&rdquo; she finally whispered, half to herself and half  to me. &ldquo;I have had the thought before; it has come when that bewildering look  of mad uneasiness has crossed his face and he has left us to be gone days,  sometimes weeks, without notice or explanation. It is a strange idea, a secret,  almost an uncanny, one; but it is the only one that can explain a crime for  which one and all of my cousins seem to lack the inherent baseness. Dare I  breathe it to you? It may be the saving of Leighton, if true; God knows it is  my only excuse for clinging to him still.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you do cling to him still?&rdquo; I asked, knowing what her answer would be, but  hoping against hope.</p>
  <p>The  look she gave recalled all her old beauty. Would that I might have been the  cause of it! or that a woman would love where she was loved and not where her  heart must encounter disgrace and bitter suffering.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  cannot help doing so,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;He will soon need my aid, if not my  comfort; for I know what these horrible contradictions mean. I understand them,  understand him, and even the revolting crime of which he may have been guilty.  Hypocrisy does not explain it; depravity does not explain it; his good acts are  too real, the nobility of his nature too unmistakable. Disease alone can  account for it. He is the victim of double consciousness, and he leads two  lives&mdash;your own expression&mdash;because the two hemispheres of his brain do not act  in unison. Wickedness is not his normal condition. His normal condition is a  noble one. By nature he is a God-fearing man, devoted to good works and high  thoughts. When he goes astray it is because the balance of his faculties has  been disturbed. This is no new thing to the psychologist. You yourself have  heard of men so afflicted. Leighton Gillespie is one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Was  her own brain turned by her terror, anxiety, and wonder? Surely she was either  mad or playing with my common sense. But the calm dignity of her manner proved  that she had advanced this astonishing, this fantastic explanation of Leighton  Gillespie&rsquo;s contradictory actions in good faith. Despair seized me at this  proof of his tenacious hold upon her, and I could not quite restrain a touch of  irony.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  would make him out a sort of Jekyll and Hyde,&rdquo; I ventured. &ldquo;Alas! I fear the  courts do not take into account the theories of the romancer in their judgment  of criminals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  sarcasm passed unheeded. Growing more and more beautiful as her earnestness  increased, she said with simple confidence:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Talk  to Dr. Bennett; he has known my cousin almost from his birth. Ask what these  sudden changes mean in a man whose primal instincts have always been good. Ask  why this devoted father, this kind son, suddenly loses himself, it may be at  table, it may be while sitting with his own child by the fire, and, deaf to all  remonstrance, blind to the most touching appeals of those about him, goes  suddenly out and does not come back till he can be himself again in the  presence of his family and under the eye of his friends. Previous to that awful  morning when my uncle unsealed to my eyes the horrible secret that rested like  a cloud over the household, I used to give another explanation to these varying  moods, and see in them a promise of more personal hopes and an augury of my own  future happiness; so easy is it for a woman to deceive herself when she  worships a man without fully comprehending him. I thought&mdash;&rdquo; Here her calm  candour grew almost heroic in the effort she made to impress me with the  reasons she cherished for her belief, &ldquo;I thought he was jealous of George or  angry with Alfred, and was driven away by his fears of self-betrayal or his dread  of being led into making unworthy reprisals. But now I see that it was his  abnormal nature which had come into play, a nature of which he may be ignorant  when in full health, and for the manifestations of which he may be no more  responsible than we are for the vagaries we commit in dreams.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have not read the latest discoveries in hypnotism,&rdquo; I rejoined. &ldquo;A man can be  driven into no act for which he lacks the natural instinct. But I do not want  to be cruel, Miss Meredith. I am too sincere in my desire to save you  unnecessary pain and heartache. Since you wish it, I will see Dr. Bennett, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My  smile seemed to unnerve her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you do not think he will agree with me in my interpretation of this crime and  Leighton&rsquo;s connection with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not, Miss Meredith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo;  she cried, with a high look and a gleam of quiet resolve that made me realise  how small was my influence in face of her overpowering love for this man, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s  will be done! I shall believe in what I have said till he whom I have trusted  is proved the heinous malefactor you consider him. When that hour comes, I  perish, killed by the greatest shame that can overwhelm a woman. To love one  who has never sought your affection may cause the cheek to burn and the heart  to recoil upon itself; but to have given all one&rsquo;s youth and the most cherished  impulses of the heart to a man who is no more than a whited sepulchre of deceit  and revolting crime&mdash;that would be to sap life at its spring and tear up the  heart by its roots. Oh, Mr. Outhwaite, forgetting all womanly delicacy,  forgetting everything but your forbearance and the confidence with which you  inspire me, I have poured out my soul before you. Prove to me that this man is  good&mdash;moral in his instincts, I mean, except when the evil spirit has a grip  upon him&mdash;and I will bless you as the saviour of my self-respect. But if you  cannot,&mdash;&rdquo; here she turned pale and tottered,&mdash;&rdquo;then do not expect me to survive.  I&mdash;I&mdash;could not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  alternative was a bitter one. I did not see at that moment how she could  expect, still less how I could perform, such a miracle. But I could not see her  depart without some gleam of encouragement, and so I told her that if the tide  turned so as to free Alfred from suspicion and land Leighton in the courts, I  would embrace the opportunity thus offered to do all that lay in my power to  prove her theory a true one.</p>
  <p>And  with this understanding between us she went away, leaving me to take up, with what  courage I could, my own broken and disjointed life.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
    An Old Catastrophe Is Recalled</b></h2>
  <p>This  idea as advanced by Hope was fantastical to a degree; yet it made its  impression upon me and was still in my mind when I opened the evening paper for  the latest news concerning the Gillespie murder. The first paragraph I  encountered proved that I had not warned her an hour too soon of Leighton  Gillespie&rsquo;s position.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fresh  disclosures in the Gillespie Poisoning Case. Leighton Gillespie, long regarded  as the most respectable and hitherto best-esteemed son of the murdered man,  discovered to have been for years the owner, and at times the occupant, of a  little house in one of the Oranges, where, unknown to the world at large&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  followed some open allusions to Mille-fleurs.</p>
  <p>Other  statements were added to this, among them a <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the facts advanced to me the evening before by Rosenthal. At the end were these  lines:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  District Attorney has the whole matter in charge, and the public is promised  some decided action to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  folded the paper, put it in my pocket, and went directly to Dr. Bennett&rsquo;s  office.</p>
  <p>I  had not seen the good physician since the inquest, and naturally the sight of  his face recalled the strange and moving incidents which had first brought us  together. But I made no allusion to these past experiences, and his first  remark was wholly professional.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope it is not as a patient I see you, Mr. Outhwaite?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a shake of the head I took out the newspaper I had been careful to bring with me,  and pointed out the paragraph concerning Leighton and Mille-fleurs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  this news to you?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I make the inquiry solely in the interests of Miss  Meredith, who has hitherto had unbounded confidence in this cousin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  glanced at the lines, frowned, and then with a pained look, replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not believe this of Leighton. He of all Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s sons is the furthest  removed from the suspicion connecting them with the crime which has wrecked  their good name. He is incapable of any serious wrong-doing; incapable even of  what these lines suggest. I have known him from his birth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  would gladly have left this kind-hearted physician in undisturbed possession of  this confidence, but the situation was too serious to trifle with.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  enjoys a good name,&rdquo; I allowed, &ldquo;and has even been known to exert himself in  many acts of benevolence towards the unfortunate and the suffering. But some  natures, and they are frequently those from which most is to be expected, have  a reverse side, which will not bear the scrutiny either of their friends or the  world at large. Leighton Gillespie has one of these natures. This story of the  little house is true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  doctor, who was evidently heart and soul with this family, showed a distress at  this avowal which spoke well for the hold which this especial member of it had  upon his affections.</p>
  <p>Seeing  that, while not ready to question my word, he was anxious to know the sources  of my information, I was about to enter upon the necessary explanations, when  he forestalled me by saying:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  have always been unexplained traits in this man. He stands alone among the  other members of the family. He has neither the social qualities of George nor  the luxurious tastes of Alfred. Nor is he like his father. I, who knew his  mother well, have no difficulty in attributing to their correct source the  religious tendencies which form so distinct a part of his character. But the  melancholy which pervades his life is not an inheritance, but the result of  nervous shock incident upon an extreme grief in early life, and while I do not profess  to understand him or the many peculiarities to which his father rightfully  raised objection, I am positive that he will never be found guilty of a  depraved act. I am ready to stake my reputation on it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  should talk with Miss Meredith,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;She believes, or endeavours to  believe, in him also. But even she finds herself forced to accept the truth of  this report. The facts favouring it are too unmistakable. I can myself supply  evidence enough to make his guilt in this regard quite sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And,  without preamble, I entered upon a detailed account of the discoveries made by  me at Mother Merry&rsquo;s. They were, as you well know, convincing in their nature,  and allowed but two conclusions to be drawn. Either Leighton Gillespie was a  monster of hypocrisy or he was the victim of the mental derangement so fondly  suggested by Hope.</p>
  <p>This  last explanation I left to the perspicacity of the trained physician. Would he  seize upon it as she did? Or would he fail to see in these results any symptoms  of the strange mental malady alluded to by Hope? I watched him anxiously.  Evidently no such explanation was likely to suggest itself to him unaided.  Indeed, his next words proved how far any such conclusion was from his mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  overwhelm me,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It was hard enough to look upon George or Alfred as  capable of a crime so despicable, but Leighton!&mdash;I shall have to readjust all my  memories and all my fancied relations with this family if <i>he</i> is to be looked upon with suspicion. Then there is Claire!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me,&rdquo; I ventured, in vague apology for an interruption which seemed out of place  from a stranger. &ldquo;Have you looked upon Leighton as a well man? You speak of a  great grief&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  loss of his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  supposed so. Now, could this grief have disturbed the even balance of his mind  so as to make these abnormal developments possible? Did he show the  inconsistencies you mention prior to the event you speak of? It might be well  to inquire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Insanity?&rdquo;  he intimated. &ldquo;Will that be the plea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think it can be advanced? He has not yet been arrested or even openly  accused, but I am confident he will be, and soon, and it is well for his  friends to be prepared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a question I cannot answer without serious thought,&rdquo; rejoined the doctor,  restlessly pacing the room. &ldquo;Intimately as I have been associated with him I  have never for a moment felt myself called upon to doubt his perfect sanity.  Does Miss Meredith regard his eccentricities in this light?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Meredith&rsquo;s inherent belief in the goodness of this favourite cousin leads her  to give him the benefit of her doubts. She regards him as a man cursed by  recurrent aberrations of mind; in other words, a victim of double  consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hope  does? What does she know about the nice distinctions governing this peculiar  condition? She must have brought all her imagination to bear on the subject, to  find such an excuse for his contradictory actions. This argues a great  partiality for him on her part. She must be in love with Leighton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was silent.</p>
  <p>The  doctor&rsquo;s amazement was very genuine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I never suspected her of any such preference. I have had an idea at times that  she favoured Alfred rather than George, but I never thought of her being caught  by Leighton&rsquo;s melancholy countenance and eccentric ways. Well! women are an  incomprehensible lot! The only widower amongst the three! The only one not  likely to be affected by her partiality. But that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. It&rsquo;s  her theory we are interested in. A strange one! A very strange one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Suddenly  he grew thoughtful. &ldquo;But not an impossible one,&rdquo; was his final comment. &ldquo;The  shock he sustained might account for almost anything. Such restrained natures  have great depths and are subject to great reactions! I must study the case; I  can give no offhand opinion upon it. The contradictions observable in his  conduct are not normal and certainly show disease. What was the question you  asked me?&rdquo; he suddenly inquired. &ldquo;Whether he showed his present peculiarities  prior to the death of his wife? I don&rsquo;t think he did; really, I don&rsquo;t think he  did. He was reserved in his ways, unhappy, out of tune with his father because  that father failed to appreciate the daughter-in-law he had foisted upon him,  but he showed these feelings naturally and not at all as he showed them later.  Have you heard the current gossip concerning his marriage?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at all, save that it was an unfortunate one and created, as you say, a certain  barrier between him and his father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it was an unfortunate one; the whole thing was unfortunate. So much so that his  friends felt a decided relief when young Mrs. Gillespie died. But her husband  regarded this loss as an irreparable one; he was wrapped up in her when she was  alive, and, as you now call to mind, has never been the same man since her  death. Perhaps it was because he had no outlet for his grief. His father would  not hear her name mentioned, and little Claire was too young to even remember  her mother. Fortunately, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  last words were said in his throat, and opened up a wide abyss of possibilities  into which I had not the curiosity to penetrate. I only felt impelled to ask:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  her death attended with any unusual circumstance that you speak of his sorrow  as a shock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  reply he went to his desk, and after some fumbling brought out several slips of  paper, from among which he chose one which he passed over to me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have kept this account of a very tragic occurrence, for reasons you will  appreciate on reading it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  took the slip and perused it. With no apology for its length, I introduce it  here. As you will see, it is an engineer&rsquo;s account of the extraordinary  accident which took place on the B., F. and D. road some half-dozen years ago.  It begins abruptly, the extract having been closely clipped from the columns of  the paper containing it:</p>
  <p class="newspaper">Big  Hill is only twelve miles long and has a grade averaging 140 feet to the mile,  and the principal part of the grade is in spots. Six loaded cars made a train  up this hill, and the train of six cars was hauled and pushed up the grade by  two engines. My engine was stationed permanently on the hill, and its duty was  to couple to the back end of one of these trains and help it up the grade.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">At  the top of the hill was a side-track called Acton, but no telegraph operator  was stationed there. At the foot of the grade was Buckley, a telegraph office  in the centre of a big side-track system used for breaking up trains before  sending them up the grade in sections. Eight miles below Buckley was an  abandoned mining town named Campton. Here was a set of side-tracks and switches  and a dozen unoccupied miners&rsquo; shanties, while the disused telegraph office was  occupied by a one-legged pensioner of the company&mdash;a flagman&mdash;and his nineteen-year-old  daughter. Twelve miles further down the line was Mountain Springs, now one of  the foremost summer resorts in the mountains, and even twenty years ago much frequented  by Eastern health-seekers. I explain this so that you will readily understand  what happened.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">We  had run No. 17 up the hill and were ordered on to the side-track at Acton to  get out of the way of No. 11, the through train from the South that was coming  North as a double-header, and with a third big engine pushing her. No. 11 was a  regular, but was making this trip as an excursion train, and was made up of  eight coaches, crowded with people from Mountain Springs.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">As  the freight we were shoving came to a stand-still, my fireman leaped to the  ground and uncoupled the engine from the last car, and I backed down over the  switch and then ran ahead on the side-track. While this was being done, a brakeman  had cut the train in front of the last two cars, and the regular engine in  front had started ahead with the other cars towards the north switch to back  the four cars in on the spur.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">As  I shut off steam and centred the reverse lever I saw that the two cars were  moving slowly down the hill, and I watched them only long enough to see the  rear brakeman clamber up the side-ladder and seize the brake-wheel. Then I  tried the water in the boiler, started the injector, and again glanced at the  cars. Evidently the brake on the first car was out of order, as the cars were  moving more rapidly, and the brakeman was hastening towards the brake on the  second car. He grasped it and swung around, and nearly fell to the ground. The  brake-chain was broken, and there was nothing to hold the cars.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">In  an instant the picture of an awful horror flashed before my eyes. No. 11,  crowded with passengers, was coming, and those cars, running at terrific speed,  would crash into the train, carrying death and destruction to scores, if not hundreds.  The scene at the moment the realisation of the impending disaster came over me  is before me now as plainly as on that day, nearly five years ago,&mdash;the moving  cars, the brakeman stumbling towards the side-ladder to descend, the fireman,  who was more than a little deaf, walking away without seeing or hearing what  had occurred, and, in his place, a man (I had almost said a gentleman) standing  by the switch-staff and gazing towards the cars with eyes that reflected the  horror in my own; while thirty miles below, on the line of the twisted, winding  track, a faint blur of smoke that told me No. 11 had left Mountain Springs.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">Before  the moving cars crossed the switch we all knew what must be done. The man, who  for all his good clothes, must have been some fireman off duty, had thrown the  switch, and then, seeing that my own man was too far off to meet this emergency,  had swung himself on to the foot-board back of the tank; and old 105 was in pursuit  of the runaways.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">The  brakeman remained to close the switch and the stranger was bracing himself to  couple the engine to the swift-moving cars when we should approach them.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">No  steam is ever used going down that hill; at the top of the incline the throttle-valve  is closed and the speed of the train is controlled by the air-brake. But, as  the stranger who had boarded the engine took his stand on the foot-board, I  opened the throttle wide to give her a start, then put on the air until I had  her under control, and then away we went. The runaway cars were fully one  hundred yards ahead as we crossed the switch, and were moving apparently at the  rate of eight or ten miles an hour with rapidly increasing momentum. In sixty  seconds old 105 was running fifty miles an hour, and in thirty seconds more we  were close to the cars. I heard the voice of the man in front shouting  something, and knowing that it was to slow down in order to approach the cars  without a crash, I applied the air. A slight jolt told me that the engine and  car had come together, and after waiting an instant to give my unknown assistant  time to drop the pin in place, I pulled the air-valve to lessen the speed. As  the engine slowed under the pressure of the brake, I saw the cars glide away  from us. He had missed the coupling. Again engine and cars came together and  again I applied the air, with the same result.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">We  were running now at a speed of sixty or seventy miles an hour, and when you  consider that the track on the hill is the crookedest ever surveyed by an  engineer, cut up by deep ravines and canyons, and leading along high  precipices, you can appreciate the danger of the run. Down the hill we thundered,  swinging through deep cuts and around sharp curves, the engine swaying and  swinging on her springs as if struggling in an effort to dash herself into one  of the gorges lining the track. The engine was surrounded by rolling clouds of  dust, through which at times I caught glimpses of the cars pitching and tossing  like some dismantled vessel in a storm at sea. I knew the cars might jump the  track at any moment and ditch the locomotive, sending the fireman and myself to  quick death; but we must take the chances so long as there was a possibility of  stopping the runaways.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">Again  and again we tried to make the coupling, but failed each time. I did not know,  until all was over, the difficulties which the stranger was experiencing. The drawhead  in the car was the old-fashioned single-link bumper,&mdash;a man-killer we call it  now,&mdash;and was so loose in its socket that it had to be raised six or eight  inches and held in position while the link was being put in place. This required  two hands, and as he could not maintain his position on the swaying foot-board  without using one hand to cling to the handrail, he could not get the link in  place and drop the pin through it.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">By  this time we were within three miles of Buckley. As the locomotive and fleeting  cars dashed across a trestle one hundred feet high, I caught a glimpse of the  little telegraph shanty down in the valley, surrounded by a network of rails. I  opened the whistle and kept it shrieking until we were within two hundred yards  of Buckley, but no one appeared on the station platform; and as we flashed past  the telegraph office the white face of the operator, his eyes wide open with  alarm and horror, appeared at the window for the fraction of an instant.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">As  we dashed past the telegraph office the long arm of the signal-board pointed  down, and I thanked God that the next block was still open, and that we had  another chance for life. We had eight miles of clear track and might yet prevent  a disaster. The only hope, however, was in catching the runaway cars, as there  was no telegraph office at Campton and No. 11 had left Mountain Springs and was  booming towards us as fast as three big engines could send her, and without a  stop ahead.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">We  crossed the half-mile of side-tracks at Buckley so fast that there was an  unbroken rattle of clanking rails, and swung around the point of the mountain  and down the winding track towards Campton. Over swaying bridges, through cuts,  old 105 jolted us along at the rate of seventy or eighty miles an hour. In two  minutes after crossing the yards at Buckley we were within sight of Campton,  nestling below us in the valley. The man on the foot-board had been silent seemingly  for hours, and whether he was still at his post or had fallen on the rails and  been ground to pieces, I did not know. I realised now that there was no longer  a possibility of stopping the cars by coupling to them, and what my hope was,  if I had any at all, I do not know; there was only a mad determination to  follow those runaway cars to the end and die with the rest.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">As  the roofs of Campton came into view the whistle began to sound again. Three  miles below lay the half-deserted mining camp; now I could see the rough board  station, the red and white switch targets, and the dark spots on the mountain-side  that marked the abandoned test-shafts. Then I distinguished a form on the  station platform, a slender form in dark calico and wearing a sun-bonnet. The  woman&rsquo;s back was towards me, but I knew her to be Nettie Bascom, the daughter  of the one-legged flagman. It was ten seconds, perhaps, before the girl heard  the whistle; then she turned slowly, looking an instant towards us, and, with a  quick spring, was at a switch-stand and had thrown the lever, and the white of  the target turned to red and we were safe. But not so the passenger train. The  cars had passed over the switch before it could be turned, and in another  moment the sound of its bounding wheels, our own cries, and all the other  noises of the dreadful moment, were drowned by an explosion that lifted old 105  off the rails and laid everyone within sight insensible on the road. Those cars  which we had chased unavailingly for thirty miles or more were laden with  dynamite, and when they crashed into that train&mdash;</p>
  <p class="newspaper">Do  you ask about the man who shared my peril, and all to so little purpose? I can  tell you nothing about him. Whether my former conclusion was correct and he had  been shaken from his narrow hold into some ditch or gully, or whether he was hurled  to destruction at the time of the explosion, I cannot say. I only know that I  never saw him again alive or dead.</p>
  <p class="newspaper">Below  was added a line by the editor:</p>
  <p class="newspaper">This  is an offhand relation of the catastrophe in which Mrs. Leighton Gillespie lost  her life. She will be remembered by New York aristocracy as the brilliant, if  eccentric, daughter-in-law of Archibald Gillespie, the multi-millionaire.</p>
  <p>I  returned the slip to Dr. Bennett. The excitement of that wild ride was upon me,  and I seemed to have been present at the catastrophe it was intended to avert.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mountain  Springs is in the West, I judge. How came the Gillespies there, and why was she  the sole sufferer? Was he not on the train with her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is one of the peculiar features of the affair. He was not on the train, but he  turned up at the wreck. Those who saw him there say that he worked like a  giant, nay, like a Titan, amongst those ghastly ruins. Finally he found her.  She was quite dead. After that he worked no more. It is a story of unmitigated  horror, and the agonies of that awful finding might well leave an indelible  impression on his brain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am glad you recognise this possibility. The effect of such a scene, even where  no personal interests are involved, often leaves a man&rsquo;s nerves in a shaken  condition for years. Besides&mdash;forgive me if I press my theory beyond all reason&mdash;another  possibility has been suggested to me by this engineer&rsquo;s tale. I will not broach  it just yet, but inquire first how Leighton Gillespie was able to reach the  scene of the wreck so quickly. Did he hasten down from the Springs, which seem  to have been some miles away, or was he in the vicinity of the accident when it  occurred?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is a question I have never heard answered. But I long ago concluded that he was  not far from the place where the collision occurred, for he was seen there as  soon as the smoke lifted. Why, what now? You seem moved&mdash;excited. Has any new  idea been suggested to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  exerted myself to speak calmly, but did not succeed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I cried, &ldquo;a strange, a thrilling idea. What if the man who shared this engineer&rsquo;s  awful ride was Leighton Gillespie, and what if he knew through all that  headlong rush, that the wife he so much loved was in the train he was risking  his life to save from destruction?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
    A Summons</b></h2>
  <p>The  doctor&rsquo;s emotion equalled mine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may have been so,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;There was always some unexplained mystery in  connection with his presence at the wreck and the reticence he maintained in  regard to it. If what you suggest is true and he was the man who shared the  engineer&rsquo;s ride down those precipitous slopes to the rescue of a train on which  he knew his wife to be, it will be easy enough for us to start a plea of mental  derangement. No one could go through such an adventure, with its overpowering  excitement and unspeakable suspense, without some injury to his mental or  physical health. But it is hard to conceive how Leighton Gillespie should have been  wandering on the mountain-side that day instead of taking the excursion with  his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t advance this explanation as a fact, only as a possibility,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;The  shock of his wife&rsquo;s sudden death would be enough in itself to change the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and it did change him; to that I can swear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  long a time elapsed after this catastrophe before you saw him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  two days. He telegraphed for me, and I went West to assist him in bringing home  the remains of his young wife. I remember finding him in a strained, nervous  condition; this was natural enough; but his worst symptoms disappeared after  the funeral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you mind telling me where this funeral took place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a small place up the Hudson River, where the Gillespies have a country home.  Mr. Gillespie carried his feeling against his daughter-in-law so far as not to  wish to have her buried from his New York house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose so; another reason, perhaps, why Leighton has never recovered from this  blow. And little Claire? You have not mentioned her. Was she with her parents  when this disastrous event occurred?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was but an infant, and from her very birth was given into the charge of her  grandfather. She never knew her mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  would have been a satisfaction to me to have learned the cause of the  determined hostility on the part of a man seemingly so just as Mr. Gillespie;  but the doctor gave me no encouragement in this direction, and I merely said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have made a start in case the necessity arises for proving him to be no longer  responsible for his actions. But only a start. The direction taken by his mania  is perilously like the excesses of a discouraged and reckless man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not so sure of that. In his sane mind, Leighton Gillespie is a great  respecter of the rights of other people. I shall look into this subject, Mr.  Outhwaite; I shall look into it at once. A half-hour&rsquo;s talk with him will  satisfy me whether he is a victim of disease or the prey of unbridled passions  and murderous instincts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  good doctor rose with every appearance of starting forth then and there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you have had no dinner,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want none.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  accompanied the doctor out, but parted with him at the corner. I would have  given much for the privilege of going with him to the Gillespie house, but as  this was not to be thought of, I resolutely turned towards my apartments, which  were in quite a different direction.</p>
  <p>How  was it, then, that by the time the lights began to be lit in the streets I  found myself circulating restlessly in the vicinity of the very house I had  determined to avoid? Had the exciting incidents of the day been too much for  me? It certainly looked so. Surely I had not wandered hither through any act of  my own volition or for any definite purpose I could name. Yet now that I had  been so led; now that I was within sight of the house where so important an  interview was going on, I surely might be pardoned for taking advantage of this  proximity to note the doctor when he came out and see, if possible, from his manner  and bearing the result of a visit upon which such serious issues hung.</p>
  <p>It  had threatened storm all day, and during the last few minutes the atmosphere  had become permeated with a drizzle which made further tramping over wet  pavements undesirable. I therefore looked about for refuge, and perceiving a  building in process of construction on the opposite side of the way, I glided  amid its shadows, happy both at the protection it offered and the full view it  gave me of the Gillespie front door.</p>
  <p>That  this was the act of one bent on espionage I am ready to acknowledge, but it was  espionage undertaken in a good cause and for justifiable reasons. At all events  I was engaged in inwardly persuading myself to this effect, when an event  occurred which drew my attention from myself and fixed it with renewed interest  on the door I was watching.</p>
  <p>A  boy of whose proximity I had had some previous intimation suddenly darted out  from the space behind me, and went flying across the street to the Gillespie  house. He had a missive in his hand, and seemed anxious lest he should be  caught and stopped.</p>
  <p>This  roused my curiosity, so that no detail of what followed escaped me. I noted the  furtive way in which he thrust the letter into the unwilling hand of the old  butler, who answered his frightened ring at the bell. Also the misgiving shake  of the head with which the latter received it, and the doubtful looks they both  cast at someone back in the hall. Who was this someone, and what lay behind old  Hewson&rsquo;s agitated demeanour? The door closed on my curiosity, and I was left to  ponder this new event. But not for long; scarcely had my eyes returned from  following the escaping figure of the boy, when the door on the opposite side of  the street unclosed again and Dr. Bennett came out.</p>
  <p>Now,  as I have taken pains to say, I had posted myself there in order to note how  this gentleman looked on leaving Leighton Gillespie. But now that this  opportunity had come, I not only failed to avail myself of it, but found my  whole attention caught and my interest fully absorbed by a glimpse I had  received of the latter gentleman standing back in the hall reading the letter I  had just seen delivered in such a surreptitious manner.</p>
  <p>His  attitude, the gestures he unconsciously made, argued sudden and overwhelming  emotion, an emotion so sudden and overwhelming that he could not conceal it,  though he evidently would have been glad to do so, judging from the haste with  which he thrust the letter in his pocket and turned&mdash;But here the door closed,  as frequently happens at critical moments, and I found my eyes resting upon  nothing more exciting than the figure of the doctor feeling his way with due  care down the damp steps.</p>
  <p>Had  I not been witness both to the peculiar actions of the urchin who brought this  letter, and to the strange manner in which Leighton received it, I might not  have considered it decorous to make my presence known to the doctor at a moment  and in a place so suggestive of a watch upon his movements. But as everything  affecting Leighton was as interesting to this, his best friend, as it was to  me, I crossed the street, and, with scant apology for the seeming intrusion, told  the good doctor what had just come under my observation.</p>
  <p>He  seemed surprised, if not affected, by what I had to say. He had seen no letter  and no evidences of disorder on the part of Leighton. To be sure, he had left  before any letter had been received.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed,  you astonish me,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Seldom have I seen my young friend in a more  equable frame of mind. He talked evenly and with discretion about the most  exciting subjects; and, though I could wish him to have been more open, he  showed a self-control hardly to be expected from a man placed in such a  disturbing situation. The detective, who appeared to have full range of the  house, hardly looked our way once. The letter which you say he received just as  I left him must have contained very agitating news. I wonder if we will ever  know what.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were  you able to settle in your own mind the question just now raised between us at  your office?&rdquo; I asked, after a momentary silence. &ldquo;It may not be in order for  me to ask, and you may not feel at all ready to answer me. If so, do not  hesitate to rebuke my importunity, which springs entirely from my excessive  interest in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will the more readily excuse you,&rdquo; was his reply, &ldquo;because my answer must dash  your client&rsquo;s hopes. Leighton Gillespie is not a victim of double  consciousness. If he were, he would not remember in one state what passes in  the other. Now, he does remember. Though he gives no explanation of what  allures him into haunts so out of keeping with his usual associations, I caught  the glint in his eye when I mentioned certain names. Leighton cannot deceive  me. Moreover, Mr. Outhwaite, I cannot professionally state that in my opinion  he is otherwise than completely sane, notwithstanding the tragic experience he  once went through. I say tragic, because the surmise you indulged in concerning  him was true. He was the man who flung himself upon the foot-rail of that  plunging engine. He acknowledged it to me just now, and acknowledged, also,  that he knew that those cars contained dynamite. A great and wonderful act for  a man who had had no experience outside the club-room and the gymnasium.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  respect heroism wherever I meet it,&rdquo; said I, slightly lifting my hat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I,&rdquo; echoed the doctor; then as we turned down the street; &ldquo;I do not comprehend  Leighton or what has led him into this course of duplicity if not crime. A hero  at one period of his life; a scamp, if not worse, at another! What are we to  think of the man whose nature admits such contradictions! What are we to think  of human nature itself! I declare I am sometimes baffled by its operations, and  heartily wish that in this present instance I could ascribe them to an unsound  mental condition.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  had no answer for this ebullition of feeling, so walked on silently till our  ways divided. As he turned towards home, I took the shortest route to my  apartments. But before entering them I dined in the caf&eacute; below, so that it was  eight o&rsquo;clock at least before I mounted to my rooms.</p>
  <p>A  man was sitting on the stairs waiting for me. As I stooped to unlock my door,  he made known his errand. He was an officer in plain clothes, and he came to  tell me that I was wanted at the earliest possible moment at the District  Attorney&rsquo;s office.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
    Ferry Lights</b></h2>
  <p>There  could be but one reason for this message from the District Attorney. I had  identified myself too closely with the Gillespie case not to have attracted the  notice of the police. I was about to be called upon to explain; and, while I  shrank from the task, I could not but acknowledge to myself that the time for  such explanations had come; that the burden then weighing upon me was too heavy  to be borne any longer unassisted.</p>
  <p>But  the explanations I have thus alluded to would cost me Hope. Never would she  forget through whose instrumentality the man she loved had been betrayed to his  doom.</p>
  <p>It  was now raining hard, and the chill which this gave to the atmosphere was  sensibly felt by us both as we stepped out into the air. At the suggestion of  the officer accompanying me, I had provided myself with a heavy overcoat. It  stood me in good stead that night, much more so than I had any reason for  anticipating when I donned it.</p>
  <p>The  ride down-town was hurried and without incident. I entered the District  Attorney&rsquo;s office about nine o&rsquo;clock, and found him in close conversation with  Mr. Gryce. Both showed relief at seeing me. This did not add to my  satisfaction, and when the detective rose and I noticed his composed aspect and  the somewhat startling fact that the wrinkle which I had so long observed  between his brows had entirely disappeared, I experienced a strange sensation  of dread only to be accounted for by the delicate nature of the sympathy which  bound me to Hope Meredith. For the moment I was Leighton Gillespie, conscious  of guilt and quailing under the quiet eye of this old detective.</p>
  <p>This  sensation, odd and thrilling as it was, did not cease with the first sight of  this man. It followed me with more or less insistence through the whole of this  memorable night, occasioning me, I have no doubt, a more poignant anguish and a  more intolerable share in the grief and suspense of the woman most affected  than Leighton Gillespie himself would have felt or did feel when the whole  power of the law was brought to bear upon him.</p>
  <p>But  these feelings, with all their sub-consciousness of another&rsquo;s suffering, did  not interfere with my outward composure; and I may here remark in passing that  I learned a lesson from this experience which has proved of great use to me in  my profession. However true it may be that sudden shock reveals the hidden  motions of the heart, it is also true that a man, if he is a man, may be the  victim of the keenest internal struggle without abating a jot of his natural  manner, or showing by look or gesture the wild contention raging within him.  This I have learned, and I no longer gauge a man&rsquo;s internal sensations by his  outward appearance.</p>
  <p>The  District Attorney was not slow in making me understand what he wanted of me.</p>
  <p>After  the necessary civilities had passed, he told me bluntly that he had heard of my  visit to Mother Merry&rsquo;s and of the conversation I had held there with a young  woman against whom a warrant of arrest had for some time been made out. As by  this interview I had been rendered competent to identify her, would I be good  enough to accompany the officers who were about to attempt her arrest? A  failure in seizing the right girl would at this stage of the affair be fatal to  the successful progress of the important matter at present engaging them.</p>
  <p>What  could I say? My position at the best required explanation, and any hesitation I  might show towards aiding the police in their legitimate task, might easily be  construed not only to my own disadvantage, but to that of the man in whose  behalf I showed resistance. Indeed, there was nothing left for me but  acquiescence, hard and uncongenial as I found it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am at your service,&rdquo; I returned. &ldquo;But, first, I should like to explain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pardon  me,&rdquo; interposed the District Attorney. &ldquo;Explanations will come later. Mr. Gryce  says he has no time to lose, the woman being a very restless one and liable at  any moment to flit. Her name is Mille-fleurs; or, rather, that is the name by  which she is known on the police books. You have seen her, and have only to  follow Mr. Gryce; he will explain the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  bowed my acquiescence, and joined the old detective at the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will be a rough night,&rdquo; that venerable official remarked, with a keen glance at  my outfit. And with just this hint as to what was before us, he stepped out  into the street, where I hastily followed him.</p>
  <p>We  did not carry umbrellas, Mr. Gryce looking upon them as a useless encumbrance;  and as I waited there in the wet while my companion exchanged some words with a  man who had stepped up to him, I marvelled at the impassibility of this old man  and the astonishing vigour he showed in face of what most young and able-bodied  men would consider the disadvantages of the occasion. Short as was the  whispered conference, it seemed to infuse fresh life into the rheumatic limbs I  had frequently seen limping along in much more favourable weather, and it was  with a gesture of decided satisfaction he now led the way to a cab I had  already seen dimly outlined through the mist which now enveloped everything in  sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  shall have to cross the city,&rdquo; he announced, as he followed me inside. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a  bad night and gives promise of being worse. But you are young, and I&mdash;well, I  have been younger, but, young or old, have always managed so far to be in at  the finish.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the finish, then?&rdquo; I ventured, with that sinking of the heart Leighton might  have felt had he heard his own doom thus foreshadowed.</p>
  <p>The  old detective smoothed out the lap-robe he had drawn over his knees.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is reason to think so, unless some mistake or unforeseen misfortune robs us of  success at the moment of expected triumph. Is your interest a friendly or a  professional one? The affair is one which warrants either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was a question I was surely entitled to evade. But I had already decided to be  frank in my explanations to the District Attorney, and why not with the man  most in his confidence?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a friend of Miss Meredith,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;in other words, her lawyer. She is more  than a friend to the Gillespies, as her relationship demands. To serve her  interests I have meddled more in this matter than was perhaps judicious. I was  anxious to prove to her that her cousins&rsquo; lives would bear scrutiny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see, and discovered that one of them, at least, would not. Poor girl! she has  my sympathy. You are without doubt a man we can rely on, no matter into what  complexities our errand takes us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know; I have never undergone any great test. I am willing to assist you  in the identification of this girl; but I would rather not be present at her  arrest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  were crossing Broadway. He looked out, gave one rapid glance up and down the  busy street,&mdash;busy even at that hour and in the wet,&mdash;and quietly remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  at his, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  jolting of the cab over the car-tracks struck my nerves as his question did my  heart. To this day I never cross a street track in a carriage, but the double  anguish of that moment comes back; also the mist of lights which dazzled down  the long perspective as I cast a glance through the dripping windows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His?&rdquo;  I repeated, as soon as I could trust my voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  Leighton Gillespie&rsquo;s. We expect to take him to-night in her company,&rdquo; he added.</p>
  <p>That  last phrase startled me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are going to take him in the presence of Mille-fleurs!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, I  saw him an hour ago standing in his own hall in Fifth Avenue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  doubt, but if you have made a study of Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s habits, you have learned  that he is given to sudden sallies from his home. He will be found, I assure  you, in the same house as Mille-fleurs. I hope we may make no mistakes in  locating this house correctly. I hardly think we shall. The men I have chosen  for the job are both keen and reliable; besides, for a gentleman of his  antecedents, Mr. Gillespie shows a startling indifference to the result of his  peculiar escapades. A strange man, Mr. Outhwaite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo;  I ejaculated abstractedly enough. My thoughts were with a possibility suggested  by his words. Pursuing it, I said, &ldquo;The letter I saw Mr. Gillespie read was  from her, then? I noticed that it caused him great agitation, even from where I  stood on the other side of the street.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old detective smiled instinctively at my reckless betrayal of the part I had  played in this scene, but made no reference to the fact itself, possibly  because he was as well acquainted with my movements as I was myself. He only  gave utterance to an easy-toned, &ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; which seemed not only to settle  this matter, but some others then inflaming my curiosity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have been waiting a long time for some such communication to pass between them,&rdquo;  he presently resumed, with a benevolent condescension, springing, perhaps, from  our close contact in that jolting cab. &ldquo;Otherwise, we should have taken him  to-day, and in his own house. We have had great difficulty in holding the  reporters back and even in keeping our own men quiet. It was desirable, you  see, to take them together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  couldn&rsquo;t she be found? Wasn&rsquo;t she at Mother Merry&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  lately. No one answering to her description has shown up there for days. She  seems to have fled from that place, alarmed, no doubt, by the interest shown in  her by the young gentleman who got speech with her at the cost of a couple of  silver dollars.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  began to note the corners as we passed them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  we are not going to Mother Merry&rsquo;s?&rdquo; I observed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  we are not going to Mother Merry&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  we are not far from the docks,&rdquo; I remarked, as I caught transitory glimpses of  the unmistakable green and red lights of the ferry-boats shining mistily on the  left.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  our errand takes us in the region of her old haunts. I hope you feel no concern  as to your safety?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Concern?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  there&rsquo;s cause enough, or would be, if we were not in force. But our  preparations have been made very carefully, and you can trust us to bring you  out all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  signified my entire satisfaction. The prospect of physical struggle or some  open adventure was welcome to me. My inner excitement would thus find vent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  not bother about me,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;What I dread most is the possibility of meeting  that unhappy woman&rsquo;s eye. Seeing me with you, she may think I have betrayed  her. And perhaps I have; but it was done without intention. She did not strike  me as a wicked woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  much the less excuse for the man who has made her his accomplice,&rdquo; came in  quiet rejoinder.</p>
  <p>This  ended our conversation for the time.</p>
  <p>We  were now making our way up-town through upper West Street. As I came to what I  knew must be Canal Street from the cars that went jingling across our path, the  difficulties of advance became more marked, and finally the cab stopped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is going on here?&rdquo; I asked, as carriage after carriage rolled into our course,  till the street was blocked and we found it impossible to proceed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a Cunarder going out. The tide sets late to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here  a coach, with a sweet-faced girl, drew up along-side us. I could see her happy  smile, her air of busy interest, as she bent her head to catch a glimpse of the  steamer upon which she was perhaps about to take her first voyage abroad. I  could even hear her laugh. The sensation was poignant. Wrapt up in the thought  of Hope, whom I had not forgotten for one moment during this wild ride, the  sight of joy which might never again be hers came like a glimpse into another sphere,  so far removed did I feel from everything bespeaking the ordinary interests of  life, much less its extraordinary pleasures and anticipations.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce in the meantime was fuming over the delay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  might better have come up &mdash; Street,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s better. We will  arrive at our destination now in less than ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  had passed the Cunarder&rsquo;s wharf, and were now rolling rapidly northward.</p>
  <p>Suddenly  the cab stopped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Again?&rdquo;  I cried.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce replied by stepping out upon the sidewalk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  alight here,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>I  rapidly followed him.</p>
  <p>The  rain dashing in my face blinded me for a moment; then I perceived that we were  standing on a corner in front of a saloon, and that Mr. Gryce was talking very  earnestly to two men who seemed to have sprung up from nowhere. When he had  finished with what he had to say to them, he turned to me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry,  sir, but we shall have to walk the rest of the way. There are alleys to  explore, and a cab attracts attention.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all one to me,&rdquo; I muttered; and it was.</p>
  <p>He  turned east and I followed him. At the first crossing, a man glided into our  wake; at the second, another. Soon there were three men sauntering behind us at  a convenient distance apart. Each held a policeman&rsquo;s club under his coat; and  walked as if the rain had no power to wet him. Suddenly I felt myself wheeled  into an alley-way.</p>
  <p>It  was pouring now, and even the street lamps shone through a veil of mist, which  made them all look like stars. The alley was dark, for there were no lamps  there; only at the remote end a distant glimmer shone. It came from the murky  panes of some shop or saloon.</p>
  <p>Towards  this light we moved.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_27"></a>Chapter 27<br>
    Rain</b></h2>
  <p>Suddenly  the figure of a man stepped out before us. It was too dark to see his face, but  his voice had a familiar sound as he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all right. He&rsquo;s there. I saw him go in a half-hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  good. My man, Sweetwater,&rdquo; explained Mr. Gryce, turning for an instant towards  me; then, in hurried tones to the other, &ldquo;Do you know on which floor he is to  be found; and whether the man at the bar suspects what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he does, he&rsquo;s pretty quiet about it. All looks natural inside. But you can&rsquo;t  tell what whispers have gone about. As for him, he&rsquo;s chosen his place with his  usual indifference to consequences. He&rsquo;s in one of the attic rooms, sir, well  back, and can be reached from the outside by means of a shed that slopes up  almost to the window-ledge. If he wanted to escape, he could easily do so by a  drop of only four feet. But I have left a man on watch there and our young  gentleman would fall into arms that wouldn&rsquo;t let him go in a hurry. Will you  come around that way? There&rsquo;s a light in the window and there&rsquo;s neither curtain  nor shade to hinder a man&rsquo;s looking in. If you wish, I can crawl up on the roof  I spoke of and take a peep at our doves before we venture upon disturbing them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  can do no harm,&rdquo; rejoined the older detective; &ldquo;and if the girl is where she  can be seen, this gentleman can go up afterwards and identify her. It will mean  surer and quieter work than approaching them by the stairway. The house is  full, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Chuck.&rdquo;  And with this characteristic word Sweetwater melted from before us as if he had  been caught up in one of the swirls of wind and rain that ever and anon swept  through the alley, dashing our faces with wet and making our feet unsteady on  the slippery pavement.</p>
  <p>I  began to feel strange and unlike myself. The night, the storm, the uncongenial  place, our more than uncongenial errand, were having their effect, lending to  that dark entrance into one of the worst corners of our great city a sense of  mysterious awe which has caused it to remain in my memory as something quite  out of the ordinary experiences of life. It was not a long alley, and we soon  reached the light I have mentioned. We could hear voices now, loud voices  raised one moment in contention, the next in drunken cheer; and, thrilling  through it all, a woman&rsquo;s tones singing some bewildering melody. It was not the  voice of Mille-fleurs. I could never have mistaken that&mdash;but it was a young voice,  and did not lack sweetness in the low notes. As I was listening to it,  something flew flapping into my face. It was a piece of damp paper peeled from  some billboard by a wandering gust and sent scurrying through the air. I tore  it away from my eyes, drawing a deep breath like a person suddenly released  from suffocation; but I shall not soon forget the effect of that cold slap in  the face at the moment when my every nerve was on tension. Mr. Gryce, who had  seen nothing,&mdash;it was hardly possible to see in the deluge which now swept down  upon us,&mdash;gave me a pull which drew me from before the swinging door I was  unconsciously making for, into a corner where I found myself more or less  shielded from the wind if not from the rain. The alley had an L, and leading  down from this L was a narrow passage, within which we now stood, surrounded by  reeking walls and facing (whenever the fury of the storm abated sufficiently  for us to look up) an opening into what might be called a labyrinth of  back-yards. As I was bracing myself to meet all alarms, real or imaginary,  associated with this noisome place, I beheld a sudden figure emerge from the opening  and hastily approach us. It was Sweetwater again. He had just descended from  his clamber over the roofs, where he seemed to be as much at home as a cat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lucky  that it rains so,&rdquo; he panted; &ldquo;keeps the kids in. Otherwise some of us would  have been spotted long ago. There are about fifty of them in this one house.&rdquo;  Then I heard him whisper in the ear that was necessarily very near mine:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all right up there. I can see his figure plainly. He&rsquo;s sitting with his back to  the window, but there&rsquo;s no mistaking Leighton Gillespie. He&rsquo;s in dinner dress,  just as he came from his own table in Fifth Avenue. The girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  what of the girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  in one of her heavy sleeps. I could not see her face, only her hair, which hung  all about her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would know her hair,&rdquo; I put in.</p>
  <p>The  two men drew a step aside and whispered together. Then Mr. Gryce came back,  and, putting his mouth to my ear, asked if I had enough agility to mount the  shed as Sweetwater had done. &ldquo;He says the wood is slippery, but the climb up  quite practicable for an agile man. He had no difficulty, and if you will catch  hold of the window-casings as you go along&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  me see the place,&rdquo; said I.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  at once drew me down the passage into the open place in the rear. Here wind and  storm had their will again, and for a moment I could neither hear nor see  anything but a vast expanse of hollow darkness, lit here and there with misty  lights, and reverberating with all sorts of sounds, among which the shrieking  wind wailed longest and most furiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Up  there!&rdquo; called a voice in my ear, and then I became aware of an arm pointing  over my shoulder towards a dark incline running up over a flight of stairs,  upon the lower step of which I had almost stumbled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your road. Can you  take it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jamming  my hat over my head, I looked up. A lighted square met my eyes in the blank  side of the wall, against which this none too desirable road, as he called it,  ran up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  window is wide open,&rdquo; said I.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you see,&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall make a noise; he will hear me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  didn&rsquo;t hear <i>me</i>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  no proof he won&rsquo;t hear <i>me</i>. But I  forget the gale, and that sound&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tin  cans rattling; loose in some gutter, I suppose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is infernal.&rdquo; Then with sudden resolution&mdash;a resolution I hardly understand, for  I certainly did not feel called upon to risk either self-respect or safety in  this cause&mdash;I cried out: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try for it; though it&rsquo;s long since I put my  agility to the proof. But how am I to get onto the roof?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For  reply, Sweetwater uttered a low but peculiar call, and a shadow near by became  a man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lend  your back to this gentleman,&rdquo; said he; and as I took advantage of the  assistance thus afforded me and worked my way up onto the ledge over his head,  he softly added:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Catch  hold of everything that offers, and be careful your feet don&rsquo;t slip. When you&rsquo;re  up, give one look and come down. We will be on hand to catch you when you get  to the edge of the roof.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  rain was dripping from my hat to such an extent that it nearly blinded me. I  tore it off and flung it at their feet; then I started on my perilous climb.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700491h-images/page276.png" width="511" height="750"></p>
  <p>It  was a difficult one, but not so difficult as I had expected; and in two minutes  I was under that open window. A tangle of ropes struck my head&mdash;clothes-lines, I  suppose. Laying hold of them, I steadied myself before looking in. As I did so,  a consciousness of my position made the moment a bewildering one. I thought of  Hope and what her surprise would be could she see me in my present situation on  the peak of this sloping roof, thirty feet above the ground. Hope! the word brought  resolution also. I would look in upon this man with eyes schooled to their  duty, but unsharpened by hate. If there was forbearance due him, I would try  and exercise that forbearance, remembering always that he was an object of  affection to the woman I loved.</p>
  <p>Was  this why I, for the first time, saw him as he may have looked to her and  probably did? He was seated in such a way that only his profile was visible  beyond the casing around which I peered. But that profile struck me forcibly,  and, forgetting my errand, I allowed myself a moment&rsquo;s study of the face I had  never rightly seen till then.</p>
  <p>I  was astonished at the result; astonished at the effect it had upon me. Leighton  Gillespie seen with his brothers was not the Leighton Gillespie I looked upon  now. Beheld thus by himself he was an impressive figure. Lacking George&rsquo;s  height and Alfred&rsquo;s regularity of feature he was apt to be regarded by  superficial or prejudiced observers as the one plain man in an exceptionally  handsome family. But I saw now that this was not so. He had attractions of his  own which could bear comparison with those of most other men; and, relieved  from too close comparison with these two conspicuous personalities, the traits  of his dark, melancholy countenance came out, and in the regard of his sad and  preoccupied eye was felt a charm which might have ripened into fascination had  no dark secret beclouded their depths or interfered with the natural expression  of feelings that must once have been both natural and spontaneous. Had he been  more fortunate in his tastes or more able to put restraint upon his passions,  he might, with that eye and smile, have been one of those men whose influence  baffles the insight of the psychologist, and from whose magnetic personality  spring innumerable benefits to those of his day and generation.</p>
  <p>All  this was forcibly impressed upon me as I knelt in the pouring rain, looking in  upon his face at this momentous crisis of his life, and, had I known it, of my  own also.</p>
  <p>I  had feared to advance my head too far lest he should be attracted by the  movement and so detect my presence at the window. Consequently I had seen as  yet nothing of Mille-fleurs, and but little of the room. This would not do, and  I was just preparing to extend my view further when the face I was watching  sank forward out of sight and a groan came to my ears so thrilling and  heartbroken that my own heart stopped beating in my bewilderment and surprise.  From whose lips had this expression of anguish sprung? From hers? It had not  sounded like a woman&rsquo;s voice. Could it be&mdash;</p>
  <p>Again!  What could it&mdash;did it, mean? Had Leighton Gillespie received some warning of the  fate which at this moment hung over him, and was it his voice I heard lifted in  these heartbroken accents? I was willing to risk everything to see. Thrusting  my head forward, I looked boldly into the room, and momentary as the glance  was, or seemed to be, I have never forgotten the dolorous and awe-compelling  picture upon which it fell.</p>
  <p>By  the light of a guttering candle, whose blowing flame threatened every minute to  go out, I saw a wretched pallet drawn up against a dirty and mouldering wall.  On this pallet lay a woman, with just a ragged counterpane covering limbs I had  so lately seen moving in rhythmical measure. Her hair&mdash;those bewildering curls,  the like of which I had never before seen and would never see again, lay about  her wherever those faded rags failed to reach. It hid her arms, it framed her  temples, and, flowing away, coiled in great masses over the side of that pallet  and onto the floor it seemed to richen with its wealth. But it did not hide her  face. Either she had moved or her locks had been drawn aside since Sweetwater  crouched in my place, for now her features were plainly visible and in those  features I had no difficulty in recognising&mdash;Mille-fleurs.</p>
  <p>Beside  her, and drawn up so close that the rich broadcloth of his sleeve brushed the  foul bed and lost itself among those overflowing curls, sat Leighton Gillespie,  with his head in his hands, weeping as a man weeps but once in a lifetime.</p>
  <p>There  was no mistaking that grief. Real heart agony cannot be simulated; and, touched  with awe for what I could not understand, I was about to slip away from my post,  when he gave an impetuous start, roused himself, and glanced in sudden anger  towards a door set in the wall directly opposite me. Another instant he was on  his feet, with his hands held out across the prostrate figure before him, in an  attitude of jealous love such as I have never seen equalled. What had he seen  or heard? The door was closed, yet he seemed to fear intrusion. Whose? Not  mine, for his eyes did not turn towards the window, but remained fixed upon  this door. Had the sound of steps reached him from the hall? Probably, for, as  I watched the door with him, I beheld the knob turn, then the door itself open,  slowly at first, then more quickly, till it suddenly fell back, disclosing the quiet  form and composed countenance of the old detective I had left behind me in the  dark corner of the passage at the side of the house.</p>
  <p>At  the same instant a voice whispered from over my shoulder into my ear:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lie  still; or slip silently down to the officers stationed below. You were so long  that Mr. Gryce became impatient.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Up  till then I had supposed that only a moment had elapsed since I first looked  in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will stay,&rdquo; I whispered back. I saw that Leighton was about to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  are you?&rdquo; I heard him demand of the intruder, in a passion so great he failed  to note the identity of the man he thus accosted. &ldquo;I have a right to this room.  I have paid for it&mdash;Ah!&rdquo; He had just recognised the detective.</p>
  <p>With  a quick turn he drew the coverlet over the face he seemed to guard so  jealously, then with an air of command, which was at once solemn and  peremptory, he pointed to the hat which naturally rested on Mr. Gryce&rsquo;s head,  and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Respect  for the dead! You will uncover, Mr. Gryce.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  dead?&rdquo; repeated the astonished detective, striding hurriedly into the room. &ldquo;The  dead? Is this girl dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But  his doubt, if doubt it were, disappeared before the look with which Leighton  Gillespie regarded him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo;  that gentleman declared. Then as Mr. Gryce instinctively bared his head, this  strange, this incomprehensible man advanced a step, and in tones inconceivably  touching and dignified, added this short sentence:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  respect her is to respect me; this woman is my wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_28"></a>Chapter 28<br>
    By The Light Of A Guttering Candle</b></h2>
  <p>My  amazement was unaffected, and so overwhelming I hardly understood myself. His  wife, Mille-fleurs! Alas, then, for Hope, who, in her unthinking if generous  love for this man, was prepared for any other grief than this! Yet why &ldquo;alas&rdquo;?  Had she not told me that her greatest wish, her supreme desire, was to see his  character restored to its old standing in her eyes, and had he not at this  moment cleared himself of the one sin her womanly heart would find it hardest  to pardon? The cry of &ldquo;poor Hope!&rdquo; with which my heart was charged changed to &ldquo;happy  Hope,&rdquo; and my composure, which had been sadly shaken, was slowly returning,  when the insoluable mystery of the situation absorbed me again, and I glanced  at Mr. Gryce to see how he had been affected by Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s announcement.</p>
  <p>This  aged detective, who, when I last looked his way, was standing alone in the  doorway, now had Sweetwater at his side,&mdash;that agile young man having bounded  into the room before the words which had made so great a change in the  situation had fully left Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s lips; and the contrast of expression  as seen in the two faces was noticeable. Sweetwater, young in experience, young  in feeling, reflected in look and attitude the sensations of awakening sympathy  and interest with which I own my own breast was full, while the older detective,  with characteristic prudence, withheld his judgment, and, consequently, his  sympathy, for the explanations which such an avowal from such a man certainly  demanded.</p>
  <p>Indeed,  the situation might very naturally suggest to one so accustomed to the seamy  side of human nature, that this sudden demise of an inconvenient witness chimed  in too opportunely with the need of the man he had come there to arrest, for it  to be viewed without suspicion.</p>
  <p>There  was, however, only a tinge of this feeling in his voice as he quietly remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you buried your <i>wife</i> five  years ago in Cornwall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I thought so also,&rdquo; was Leighton Gillespie&rsquo;s quiet reply. &ldquo;For many, many  wretched weeks and months I believed this in common with all my friends. Then&mdash;but  it is a long story, Mr. Gryce. Do you require me to relate it now and <i>here</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  reverence with which he allowed his hand to touch rather than fall on the  breast he had so carefully covered from our curious gaze spoke volumes. At the  sight of this simple action, both men bent their heads. I doubt if he noticed  it. A stray lock which had escaped from the coverlet and now hung curling and  glittering over the straw which protruded from the wretched pallet, had  attracted his eye. Lifting it with a lingering touch, he put it softly out of sight;  then he quietly said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would like to have one fact made known to the public. My father was ignorant to  the last that it was a stranger and not my wife we buried in Cornwall. There  were reasons which made it difficult for me to tell him that Mrs. Gillespie  still lived; and while I make no excuses for the silence I maintained towards  him on this subject, I acknowledge that to it are due my present position and  the misery I am now under of seeing the darling of my heart die in an attic  where I would not house a dog.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  accents of heartfelt sorrow are not to be mistaken. The air of severity with  which Mr. Gryce had hitherto surveyed this supposed criminal softened into a  look more in keeping with his native benevolence, but he had no reply ready,  and the silence became painful. Indeed, the situation was not an easy one for  even so experienced a man as Mr. Gryce to handle, and, noting his embarrassment,  I bounded into the room and took my place at his side, much as Sweetwater had  done.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gillespie scarcely remarked this new inroad upon his privacy. He doubtless took  me for another police-officer, and as such not to be noted or counted. But the  detectives showed some surprise at my intrusion, which seeing, I turned to Mr.  Gryce and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you will excuse my presumption I should like to speak to Mr. Gillespie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  latter started, possibly at my tone, and, wheeling about, gazed at my bare head  and drenched figure with sharp curiosity in which a growing recognition soon  became visible.</p>
  <p>I  at once bowed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  remember me,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;I am Mr. Outhwaite. If you will pardon my method of  entrance and the proof which it gives of my connection with these men, I should  like to offer you my assistance at this crisis. Mr. Gryce evidently wishes some  conversation with you, which you rightly hesitate to accord him in a place made  sacred by the presence of your dead wife. If you will have confidence in me, I  will watch this room while you go below. No one shall approach the bed and no  one shall enter the room, if Mr. Gryce will leave a guard at the door. Will you  accept this service? It is sincerely tendered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  stood perplexed, eyeing me with mingled doubt and astonishment; then, turning  with an inexpressible look of longing towards the one object of his care, he cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do not understand or you would not ask me to leave her, not for a moment. I  have not had her so near me, so near my hand, so near my heart, these many  minutes in years. She cannot rise and run away from me now. She does not even  wish to. This is a happiness to me you cannot appreciate, a happiness I cannot  endure seeing cut short. Leave me, then, I pray, and come again when she has  been laid in her grave. You will find me ready to receive you, ready to explain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  ask the impossible,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Gryce. &ldquo;Some explanations will not bide  the convenience of even so recent a mourner as yourself. If you do not wish to  be taken immediately from this place, you will make some few things clear to  us. What has this woman had to do with your father&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  fire with which Leighton Gillespie uttered this word made us both start. Aghast  at what struck me as a direct falsehood, I instinctively opened my lips. But  Mr. Gryce made me an imperceptible gesture, and I refrained from carrying out  my inconsiderate impulse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see,&rdquo; continued the unhappy man, &ldquo;that suspicions which I had supposed confined  to my brothers and myself have involved my innocent wife. This is more than I  can bear. I will at once make known to you my miserable story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce drew up a chair and sat down. As there was no other in the room we knew  what that meant. The damp air was beginning to tell upon the rheumatic old man.  Attention being thus called to the open window, Sweetwater moved over and  closed it. Never shall I forget the look which Leighton Gillespie cast towards  the bed as that broken and ill-fitting sash came rattling down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  if the hall is clear,&rdquo; said Mr. Gryce.</p>
  <p>The  young detective crossed to the door. As he opened it and looked out, a gust of  noisy laughter rose from below, mingled with the shrill sound of a woman&rsquo;s  singing, the same, doubtless, which we had previously heard in front. These  tones, heard amid brawl and shouting, seemed to pierce Mr. Gillespie to the  heart. Mr. Gryce, who saw everything, motioned to Sweetwater to close the door  as he had the window. Sweetwater complied by shutting himself out. This was an  act of self-denial which I felt called upon to emulate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I join Mr. Sweetwater?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>It  was Mr. Gillespie who replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I wish more than one listener; let the lawyer stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  was only too happy to remain. Wet as I was, I felt anxious to hear what this  man so singled out by Hope had to say in explanation of his relations to the  wretched woman he now acknowledged to be his wife.</p>
  <p>He  seemed in haste to make them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seven  years ago this fall,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I met this woman, then a girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;  put in Mr. Gryce; &ldquo;there is a point which must first be settled.&rdquo; And,  advancing to the cot guarded so jealously by the man before him, he laid his  hand upon the coverlet. &ldquo;You will allow me,&rdquo; he said firmly, as with a gentle  enough touch he drew it softly aside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  came this woman&mdash;pardon me, how came Mrs. Gillespie to die thus suddenly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  unhappy husband, after his first recoil of outraged feeling, forced himself  into a recognition of the detective&rsquo;s rights, and, with apparent resignation,  rejoined:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should have come to that in time. She died, as you can readily perceive, from  exposure. Driven from Mother Merry&rsquo;s miserable quarters by some terror for  which, perhaps, she had no name, she wandered in and out among the docks for  two wretched days and nights, often dragging her feet through the ooze of the  river, so that her garments were never dry and are not so yet. At last she came  here, where once before she had found shelter in a biting storm. <i>Here!</i> But it is a better place than the  wharves, and I am glad God guided her to even so poor a refuge. She was raving  with fever when she came straggling into the room below. But after the warmth  struck her and she had tasted something, she came to herself again, and then&mdash;and  then she sent for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  paused. I did not yet understand him or the circumstances which made this  situation possible, but a strange reverence began to mingle with my wonder,&mdash;not  for the man&mdash;I could not feel that yet; but for a love which could infuse such  feeling into the lightest allusion he made to this beloved, if wretched waif.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was a doctor here when I came,&rdquo; he speedily continued. &ldquo;You can find him;&mdash;he  will tell no different tale from mine&mdash;but no doctor could help her after those  nights of bitter cold and exposure, and I paid him to leave me alone with her;  and she died in my arms. May I tell you why this was everything to me? Why, the  happiness of having received her last sigh is so great, that I have no room for  resentment against you for this intrusion, and hardly feel the shame of being found  in this place, with my dead darling lying in her miserable rags on this hideous  pallet!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  may tell us,&rdquo; assented Mr. Gryce, replacing the coverlet over the face upon  which was fast settling that look of peace which is Death&rsquo;s last gift to the  living.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gillespie&rsquo;s tone grew deeper; it could hardly have grown more tender or more  solemn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  loved this woman. She was young when I first saw her. So was I. There were no  haggard lines about her dancing eyes and laughing lips then. She was a vision  of&mdash;well, I will not say beauty; she was never beautiful&mdash;but of&mdash;I cannot tell  you what; I can only say that my life began on that day, not to end till she  died, a half-hour ago.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  married her. She was not a woman to take into my father&rsquo;s house; perhaps not  into any family circle. The stage was her home, the stage from which I took  her; but I did not know this; I simply knew that she was wild in spirit, and  unused to household ways and social restrictions. But had I understood her then  as I do now, I doubt if I would have acted any differently. I was headstrong in  those days and quite reckless enough to grasp at what I felt to be my own, even  if aware it would fall to nothing in my frenzied clutch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  took her into my father&rsquo;s family. I took this wild bird out of its native air,  and shut it up behind the strict bars of a conventional household. One promise  only I exacted from her as the price of this gracious act on my part. She was  never under any pretext, not even in the event of my death, to return to the  stage. Poor child! she has kept that promise. Perhaps it is all she has kept:  kept it, though hungry; kept it when the wild craving for morphine tore at her  breast and brain and she could have got the drug for one strain from her marvellous  voice; kept it, though her veins burned with longing for the movement that was  her life, and the weights on her tongue lay heavy on her heart, which beat  truly only while she was dancing or singing. It was her dancing and singing  which had won my heart; or, rather, the woman when dancing and singing; yet I  cut her off from these natural expressions of the turbulent joy springing from  her exuberant nature, and expected her to be satisfied with my love and the  routine of a well-regulated household. This was my folly; a folly born of the  delight I took in her simple presence. I thought that she loved me as I did  her, and found in love&rsquo;s madness the recompense for what she had laid aside.  But I had not read her nature. No man could fill her heart as she filled mine.  She was a genius,&mdash;an untamable one,&mdash;and the restiveness of her temperament made  demands which could only find relief in spontaneous song or rhythmic movement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father, who loved quiet women&mdash;women like my mother, whose force lay hidden in  such sweetness that she shines with almost a saint&rsquo;s glory in our memory&mdash;could  not understand my wife&rsquo;s temperament; and, consequently, could not show even  common patience towards her. He was not harsh in his treatment of her, but he  failed to give her credit for so much as wishing to conform to his ways and the  habits of the people she must meet in our house. When he came upon her,  stealthily posing before our long mirror in the drawing-room, or caught  floating down the stairs a faint echo of her magical voice in one of the tragic  strains she best loved to sing, he showed such open shrinking and distaste that  she flew for comfort to the one resource capable of undermining for me all hope  of a better future. I allude to her use of morphine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  had taken it before our marriage, but the fact was kept from me. When I awoke  to a realisation of the horror menacing my happiness, I devoted time, strength,  and every means I then knew, to win her from this practice. But I only  partially succeeded. She did not realise the harmfulness of this habit and  could not be made to. Eluding my vigilance, she resorted more and more to the  drug I could never succeed in keeping out of her grasp, and it fell to me to  stand in the breach thus made and keep the knowledge of this crowning  humiliation from my father and brothers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile  my father, who was strictness itself in all matters of propriety, insisted upon  her sitting opposite him at the table and comporting herself in every way as  the lady of the house. Just because he so dreaded comment and had so much pride  in his own social standing and that of his sons, he kept her continually on  view and carried her to parties and balls, thinking that his prestige would  cause recognition to be given her by his friends. And it did&mdash;but grudgingly!  Admired for what she was not, she was scorned for what she was. I have seen her  petted by some would-be society fine lady till my blood boiled, then marked the  smile of supercilious sarcasm which would be thrown back upon her when her  beautiful shoulders were turned. Yet I had hopes, strong hopes of better days  after the first strangeness of the new life should have worn away and her good impulses  had had time to develop into motive powers for kind actions. But it was not to  be; never was to be. The fiend whose power I had set myself to combat was far  stronger than any force I could bring against him. She grew worse&mdash;appeared once  in public as she never before had appeared outside her own room, and my father,  who was with her, never attempted to hold up his head again in his former  unmoved fashion. Claire, who came to us later, had no power to hold her mother  back, and while she was still an infant, the inevitable occurred&mdash;my wife ran  away from us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was the first overwhelming shock my hitherto unfailing faith had had to  sustain. She had slipped away at nightfall without money and almost without  farewell. The merest note left on the piano in our little room on the third  floor told me she had tried to be happy in a domestic life, but had failed; and  begged me not to seek her, for she was stifling for air and freedom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I have no doubt she was. Seeing, since, where she has found pleasure, and under  what conditions the old gay smile has revisited her lips, I have no doubt that  the very luxury we prized was oppressive to her. But then I only thought of the  dangers and privations she must encounter away from my protection; and,  confiding to no one the calamity which had befallen me, I rushed from the house  and sought her in every place which suggested itself to me as a possible  refuge. It was a frenzied search, and ended in my coming upon her, ten days  after her disappearance, in a plain but decent lodging-house. Her money was  gone, and she lay in that heavy sleep which has no such hallowing effect upon  the beauty as this we look upon now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  men&rsquo;s love would have sickened and failed them at this degrading sight. But  though a change took place in the feeling which had held me in an entranced  state ever since my marriage, it was a change which deepened, rather than  deadened, the affection with which I regarded her. From a creature whose untold  charm bewitched and bewildered me, she became to me a sacred charge for which I  was responsible to God and man; and while she still lay there and I stood in a  maze of misery before her, I vowed that, come what would, I would remain true  to her and by means of this faith and through the unfailing patience it would call  forth, make what effort I could to stay her on the brink of that precipice she  seemed doomed to perish by.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I was to be tried in ways I had little foreseen. She was glad to see me when  she woke, and readily consented to return to her home and her child. But in two  months she was off again, and this time I did not find her so easily. When I  did, she was in such a hopeless condition of mental and moral degradation that  I took her to a sanitarium, where I had every reason to expect that a proper  secrecy would be maintained as to her real complaint and unhappy condition. For  my pride was still a torment to me, and an open rupture with my father too  undesirable for me to risk a revelation of the true extent of the vagaries  indulged in by his unwelcome daughter-in-law. Her escapades, serious as they  were, had affected him but little. For I had so closely followed her in her  sudden flittings that we were looked upon as having left home together on some  hurried tour or at the call of some thoughtless impulse. He had believed us out  of town, while I was engaged in hunting the city through for her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  after a week spent in the sanitarium, I perceived by the looks I encountered,  on every side, that my secret was discovered; and was thus in a measure  prepared when the door of my room opened one day upon the stern figure of my  father. He had heard the true cause of my wife&rsquo;s condition, and a stormy scene  was before me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was then that I regretted that my early opportunities had been slighted, and  that, instead of being independent of his bounty, I was not considered capable  of earning my own living. Had my home been one of my own making, I might have  stood up and faced him at that hour with a resolution to hold by my wife, which  in itself might have ensured his respect. But I was tied hand and tongue by the  realisation of all I owed him, was owing him, and was likely to owe him to the  end of my days. I was not master of my own life; how, then, could I propose to  be the master of another&rsquo;s?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father, whose favourite I had never been, could not be expected to know what  was passing in my heart; but he was not without a realisation of what he might  find in the adjoining room, and, casting a glance that way, he asked coldly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Is  she&mdash;Mrs. Gillespie&mdash;(he never called her by her given name) <i>awake</i>?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  question could have pierced my heart more poignantly. It was not the hour for  sleep, and the use of the word had intention in it. But I subdued all signs of  distress, and, calling her by name, bade her come out and greet father; after  which I stood breathless, waiting for her appearance, conscious that it might  be a smiling one, and equally that it might be&mdash;I dared not think what. She was  not always to be depended upon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did not appear at once. &lsquo;Sit down, father,&rsquo; I begged. &lsquo;She may be dressing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she was. In a minute or two, as we stood watching, she threw open the door, and  in an instant I saw that whatever hope I may have cherished of her creating a  good impression in her partially recovered state, was an ill-founded one. She  was not in one of her depressed moods, but, what was worse, perhaps, in one of  her ecstatic ones. All her genius, and she had much, had taken fire under some  impulse of her erratic brain, and she came into the room prepared to conquer in  the only way she knew how. Still young, still beautiful in her own way, which  was that of no other woman, she glided into our presence in one rapturous  whirl, a scarf floating from her neck, and a wreath of wild vine about her  head. I rushed to prevent her, but it was too late. She <i>would</i> dance, and she did, while my father, who had never seen her  in this glowing state, drew me aside and watched with hard eyes, while she  swayed and dipped and palpitated in what would have been a glorious ebullition  of pure delight, had she not been my wife, and the man at my side as cold to  her charm as the dew which stood out on my wretched forehead. When I could bear  no more, I flung my arms about her and she stopped, panting and frightened,  like a bird caught in full flight. &lsquo;Sing,&rsquo; I whispered to her; &lsquo;sing that air  from <i>&AElig;none&rsquo;</i>. I thought the tragic  pathos of her tones might make her dancing forgotten. And they did in a way. My  father had never listened to any such dramatic rendering of a simple song  before, and I saw that he was subdued by the feelings it awakened. But I  gathered no hope from this. He had too little liking for public exhibitions of  this kind on the part of women, for him to be affected long by any singing  which was not that of the boudoir; and when, her first ebullition passed, she began  to droop under the heavy reaction which inevitably followed these impulsive  performances, I drew her into the other room, and shut the door. Then I came  back and faced him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  was standing in the window of the large but unlovely room, drumming restlessly  on the panes before him. As the light struck his head it brought to view the  silver rapidly making its way through the dark locks he had been accustomed to  pride himself upon, and a pang struck me at this sight, which made me quite  dumb for the instant. I felt as if I, and not she, had been dancing over his  heart. Then my ever-present thought of the woman I had sworn to cherish  returned and held me steady while he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;It  is well that I have seen your wife once when the full spell was upon her. Now I  know what has come into the Gillespie family. Leighton, do you love this woman?&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="1700491h-images/page296.png" width="497" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Enough  to bear your condemnation if you choose to condemn us,&rsquo; I assured him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Then  take her away out of my sight and from the possible sight of my growing  grandchild. A dancing menad can be no mother to Claire.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I  will take her away,&rsquo; I promised him. &lsquo;When this place has done all for her it  can, I will carry her where she can offend no one but strangers.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;I  would suggest an asylum,&rsquo; he muttered. It was the only unjust thing I ever knew  him to propose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;She  is not insane,&rsquo; I objected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;She  is not sane,&rsquo; he rejoined. &lsquo;No opium-eater is. But I will not force your  conscience; only&mdash;let me never again see her in our home in Fifth Avenue. <i>You </i>will always be welcome.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could not retort that I would enter no house from which she was thus  peremptorily excluded. The house in Fifth Avenue was my home, the home of my  child; and about it clustered every dear association of my heart save those  connected with my unhappy love.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;A  man who marries for a whim must expect unpleasant results,&rsquo; my father resumed. &lsquo;You  shall have what money you need for her establishment elsewhere; but this  hemisphere is too narrow to harbour both her and myself. Go to Europe,  Leighton; there is more room there for your wife to dance in.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I meant to follow this suggestion, but her health was not good enough for me to  risk a voyage at this juncture, and we drifted West and put up at a place  called Mountain Springs. It was during our stay there, that, so far as the  world is concerned, the story of my married life ended. But for me it had only  begun. The facts regarding my wife and her connection with that great  catastrophe which robbed more than one household of wife and mother differed  much in reality from those reported to the world and accepted by my own family.  She did not perish in that wreck, though I thought she had, and mourned her  loss for many months. She had merely taken advantage of the circumstances to  effect another escape. How, I will endeavour to relate, hard as it is to  disclose the failings of one so dear to me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  wife, whose natural longings had been modified rather than extinguished by her  experiences at the sanitarium, soon awakened to the old sense of restraint and  a desire to enjoy again the irresponsibilities of her early Bohemian life. But  having gained wisdom by her past experiences, she allowed no expression of her feelings  to escape her; and, relying on the effect produced upon me by her apparent  content, merely asked the privilege of enjoying the sports indulged in by the  other boarders. Fearing to cross her too much, I gave her all possible liberty,  but when she begged to go on a certain excursion&mdash;the excursion which ended so  disastrously for all concerned&mdash;I felt forced to refuse her, for I had made an  arrangement that day which would prevent me from accompanying her. However,  after repeated solicitation, I yielded to her importunities and gave her my consent,  at which she showed much joy, and lavished many expressions of fondness upon  me. Had my suspicions not been lulled by the undisturbed peacefulness of the  last few months, these open demonstrations of affection might have occasioned  me some alarm, for they were not without a suggestion of remorse. But I  mistrusted nothing; I was too happy, and when I parted from her it was with the  full intention of sacrificing for her pleasure the first real business engagement  I had ever entered upon. But I did not carry out this impulse; I merely made  arrangements for the train to stop for me at the little station on the  mountains where my affairs led me. But I did not confide this plan to her till  I was upon the point of leaving. Then I told her she might look for me on the  train immediately after passing Buckley, and while I wondered at the way she  received my words, I thought the embarrassment she showed was due to surprise. Alas!  it sprang from much deeper sources. She had planned to leave me again, this  time forever; and, baffled as she thought in the attempt, she succumbed for a  little while to despair. Then her fertile brain suggested an expedient. Two  trains left Mountain Springs that morning, one north and one south. She would  take the southern train, and lest she should be prematurely discovered in her  flight and so be followed before she had found a refuge, she prevailed upon a  girl over whom she had some influence, to exchange garments with her and take  her place among the excursionists. She little dreamed what lay before those excursionists.  As little did I realise that it was in behalf of a stranger I entered upon that  mad chase after the runaway cars I had seen slip from the engine and go  crashing down towards the train on which I believed my wife to be. I knew those  cars to be loaded with dynamite, for it was in connection with this fact I had  come to this place, and the thought that they were destined to prove the destruction  of the life I so much prized maddened me to such an extent that it was a mere  matter of instinct for me to leap upon the engine I saw bounding to her rescue.  Had time been given me to think, I might not have shown such temerity, for I  knew nothing of a fireman&rsquo;s duties or what would be expected of me by the engineer.  But I did not pause to think; I only stood ready to hazard my life for the  woman I loved,&mdash;the woman whom I believed to be on the train I even then could see  advancing up the valley. Of that ride, its swirl and whirlwind rush, I remember  little; every thought, every fear, was engrossed in the one question, How were  we to save that train? But two methods suggested themselves to me in my  ignorance and isolation from the brave engineer. Either we must overtake the  cars and by coupling to them stay their downward rush to the main track below&mdash;a  trick I did not understand&mdash;or we must crush so fiercely into them as to explode  the dynamite with which they were loaded before they had a chance to collide  with the advancing train. That the latter catastrophe did not happen was not  owing to any precaution on my part, for I do not remember that I had the least  dread of personal destruction. As I have just said, my one thought, my only  thought in that dizzy descent, was to save her. And I failed to do it; or so I  had reason to think. As you remember, all our efforts were in vain; the  unspeakable occurred, and wreck, death, and disaster met my eyes when, after a  period of blank darkness, I rose from the ground where I had been hurled by the  force of that dynamite explosion. Amid this wreck, in face of this death, I  plunged in my search for her, and, as I believed, found her. A loving husband  cannot be deceived in his wife&rsquo;s clothes, and the fragments I handled told  their tale, as I thought, only too well. But, as you now know, it was not my  wife who wore these clothes, though we buried her as such, and I mourned my  lost love as no one who has not fixed his whole heart upon one object can  possibly understand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  father, whose relief at this release can be readily imagined, endeavoured to  calm my grief, not by sympathy, for that he could not feel, but by an unvarying  kindness which assured me that, now that this obstacle to a right understanding  between us had been removed, I might hope for the establishment of more cordial  relations between us. I was older now, and he more considerate of my many  uncongenial ways and habits; besides, Claire made a tender bond between us, and  with one of her baby smiles healed many a breach that might otherwise have separated  us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  began to be content, when, having some business in a strange quarter of the  city, I chanced to walk down East Fourteenth Street. It was a holiday of some  kind and there had been a procession. The stir in the streets was just what  usually follows the breaking up of long lines of people. But this did not  disturb me. Claire had been unusually engaging that morning, and I was just  rejoicing in the memory of her innocent prattle, when the band in the far  distance broke out into a merry strain, and I saw on the sidewalk before me a cluster  of people separate into a sort of ring, in the middle of which a woman stood  poised with swaying arms, so like the image that was day by day receding  farther and farther into the deep recesses of my memory, that a species of  faintness came over me and I drew back, sick and half-blinded, directly in the  path of the people pressing in my rear. This caused me to receive a push from  behind which effectually roused me and gave me strength to look again at one  who could recall my lost Mille-fleurs. I expected&mdash;how could I expect anything else?&mdash;to  be met by a strange face and an unknown smile. But it was <i>her</i> face, <i>her</i> smile; and  the figure, clad in such clothes as I had never, even in my worst dreams,  associated with the woman to whom I had given my name, was <i>hers</i>. Had God made two such women? Two with such eyes, such hair,  such instincts, and such genius? Was this a sister of Mille-fleurs; a twin of  my lost darling, of whose existence I had never heard? God grant not! I had  buried Mille-fleurs, and with her, memories which this creature would only  bring back to the destruction of my peace. I dared not give way for one instant  to the thought that this likeness was anything but a passing illusion which the  next moment would dispel. I dared not for my life. And yet I stood staring;  hearing and not hearing the shouts of wild applause rising around me, and was  looking, yes, looking directly into her eyes, when they suddenly turned my way  in startled recognition. It was Mille-fleurs! Mille-fleurs! The woman I had  buried was a stranger, and she who was making pastime for the passing crowd was <i>my wife!</i></p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  made no scene. I accepted the fact as we accept any unforeseen catastrophe that  comes upon us unawares, tearing up our peaceful present and making a chaos of  the future. As she was still dancing, though fitfully and with curious breaks,  I stopped her by my steady look and held her so, till the crowd had melted away  sufficiently for me to take her by the hand and lead her under the cover of the  first small shop we came to. Then I questioned her closely, and, when I understood  all, asked her if she would go with me and be clothed and fed. She answered  with a startled look. &lsquo;I cannot!&rsquo; she cried, and wearily drooped her head. &lsquo;I  am not worthy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God  knows what passed through my mind then. I stood there in the wretchedness of  this low shop, beside a counter from which the smell of stale tobacco rose in  nauseous fumes, together with the sickening smell of partially decayed fruits&mdash;a  flower in my button-hole (put there by little Claire), and before me this  woman, loved as few of earth&rsquo;s best and worthiest have been, telling me with  trembling lips what explained her rags, the degradation which had fallen on her  beauty, and the whole pitiable downfall of a womanhood which once struck my  heart as ideal and worthy of a man&rsquo;s unselfish worship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drawing  the flower from my button-hole, I crushed it in my hand. If I could have donned  the clothes of some of the men lolling about us in greedy curiosity, I would  have done so at that moment, if only the contrast between our outer selves  might have been less apparent. But this was impossible, and I could only stand  in silence in face of this wreck of bygone delights, and in one moment and  under the gaze of a dozen pairs of eyes peering from behind the counter and  gaping in at the doorway, live down my bitter humiliation at this untoward resurrection  of a love I had learned to rejoice in as buried. For this was no wretched waif  of the streets I could pity and leave. This was my wife, the mother of my  child; the woman whom I had once vowed to hold in honour to the end, and to  succour, no matter what her need or to what degradation she might come.  Besides, there was an appeal in her drooping attitude and quivering mouth which  touched my heart in spite of my judgment. I felt her misery as I had never felt  my own; a misery all the more pronounced because of the joy so openly preceding  it; and, feeling a fresh thrill in the old cord of union that had made our  hearts one, I quietly asked her if she had lost all love for me. She gave me  one quick look; and I saw her eye quicken as she softly faltered, &lsquo;No. Only,&rsquo;  she made haste to add, &lsquo;I cannot live in big houses under the eyes of people  who think my ways odd and wrong. If you take me back to him I cannot help going  wrong again. But I would like something pretty to wear and something good to  eat.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  took her to an East Side hotel. I bought her clothes and gave her food, over  which she laughed like a child. Then I told her what I meant to do for her. I  would buy her a home in a pretty country place, where she need not fear  intruding eyes. There she should live with some woman I could trust and who  would be kind to her. A piano, music, flowers, books&mdash;she should have all, and  if, in the course of time, she came to wish it, I would bring our child to see  her. Did she think she could be contented in a home like this? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be  better than the cold and squalor of the streets and these wild dances before unsympathetic  eyes?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  answered with a burst of affection which was real enough at the time; then  asked if I was going to let my father know she was living. This brought to  light the spectre which had stood over against us ever since I first recognised  her as the woman I had sworn to love and cherish. Could I tell my father? Could  I bring down again upon myself the old coldness, the old distrust, the old  sense of a division that was gall to me because of the reverence and love I  naturally felt for him?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could not; I recognised the cowardice of it, but I could not. I was ready to  give her succour; I was ready to devote time, money, and care to her  establishment and well-being; I could deny myself the pleasures and pursuits  natural to men of my age, and even the uninterrupted enjoyment of the home I  had come to prize, but I could not tell my father that the wild-eyed creature  he was forcing himself to forget, still lived, and might any day bring down  fresh humiliation upon him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  saw my doubt and smiled as in the early days of her untrammelled youth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Better  so,&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;then if I fail to be good it will not so much matter. And I  may fail; it is in my blood, Leighton; in my unfortunate Bohemian blood. Oh,  why did you ever care for me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Such  gusts of feeling and regret over the havoc she had caused were common to her.  They made it impossible for me to hope in her ultimate restoration to  respectability and a quiet life. But, alas! they were but gusts, and after a  few months of peaceful harbourage in the rose-covered cottage I found for her,  she fled from me again and was lost for <i>years</i>.  But I never ceased searching for her. The unrest of knowing she was restless  under the roof I had provided for her was nothing to the restlessness of not  knowing where she was and in what misery and under what deprivation she was  pining away in the dark holes where alone she could find refuge. I have sat  hours under my father&rsquo;s eye, talking of stocks and bonds and railway shares,  while my every thought and feeling were with her whom in my fancy I saw wandering  from river to river, in dark nights and in cold;&mdash;rain on the pavements or slush  in the streets,&mdash;drawing up to lighted doors for warmth or hiding her brown head  with its flying curls under sheds a dog might be glad to fly from.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  has happened to me often to be in the presence of women, at church or concert  or festival, and with their eyes on my face and the perfume of their presence  floating about me, to behold in my mind&rsquo;s perspective a solitary figure poised  on the edge of some dock, in whose lifted arms and upstrained countenance I  read despair, the despair that leads to death; and, forgetting where I was and  to whom my words were due, have rushed out to do&mdash;what? Wander those down-town streets  and the bleak places I had seen in my fancy, in the hope of coming once again  upon the being who, unaccountably to myself, still held the cord whose other  end was bound indissolubly to my heart. What wonder that I was looked upon as  eccentric, moody, strange, or that my father, who naturally explained these  freaks according to his own lights, showed displeasure at my unaccountable  whims? Yet I went on with my search, and finally the day arrived when my  perseverance was rewarded and I came upon her once again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was in a low dance-hall, but she was not dancing. She was simply gazing at  another woman attempting those dizzy whirls which, under the sway of her own  genius, had once attracted the applause of a different crowd from this. There  was infinite longing in her eyes, mixed with the sadness which will sometimes creep  over those who are homeless through their own choice. When she saw me, and this  was perhaps sooner than was best for either herself or me, I saw the old look  of terror rise in her eyes, but mingled with it was a certain recognition of my  faithfulness and self-forgetful care for her which melted the ice about my  heart and reawakened the old hope for her. But she did not follow me when I  beckoned her out; nor could I induce her to do so without risking a scene which  would necessarily attract all eyes to us. But she promised, if I gave her  money, to return the next day to the little house in New Jersey.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  she did; but her stay was short, and it became a common thing for her to drift  back there for a day or so, and then to flee away again, to return when the  fancy seized her or the devils of discomfort drove her to seek a respite from  the horrors which had now become for her synonymous with freedom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  always found something to reward her for these visits; some surprise in the  shape of a new article or some fresh source of amusement. Money to me was only  valuable as it gave me power to rivet another link to the chain with which I  endeavoured to hold her to a better life; and though I knew the false  construction which might be put upon these expenditures, not only by my father  but others, I spared no means, stopped at no extravagance which might add one  more allurement to the nest I had made for my weary and bedraggled one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  woman who had orders to keep this house in a continual state of readiness for  its fitful visitant was as discreet as she was sympathetic. She may have  surmised my secret, or she may have supposed all these efforts the result of an  ill-conceived philanthropy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  could never tell by her manner. But I knew she treated my poor one well. Time  after time has she opened the door to a disordered and dishevelled creature,  whom next morning I found sitting in a bower of roses, fitted out in dainty  cashmeres, and with her long locks combed till they shone and shone again. Nay,  I have come upon her on her knees before the bruised and frozen feet upon which  she was thrusting slippers of downy softness, which made my darling laugh until  their very softness became a burden, and she threw them off to dance. I have never  lingered over these sights, but I have imagined them over and over with  tear-filled eyes, for, explain it as you will, every backward slip made by my  darling toward the precipice I ever saw yawning for her strengthened the hold  she had upon my heart, till the pity with which I regarded her filled my whole  bosom to bursting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  the wild hawk cannot be tamed. She would vanish from our care just when we  thought it was becoming dear to her, and my wild pursuit would begin again, to  be followed by chance findings and renewed disappointments. She was not to be  held, though in the hope of doing so I have spent many stolen hours in the  little house, reading to her, talking to her, playing with her, sacrificing my  good name and the regard of my relatives just to win back one innocent look to  her face and keep her amused and contented without the help of the accursed drug.  She slipped away from us in spite of all our efforts, and during this last year  returned only once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  I think she has felt more drawn to me this year than in all the time of our  marriage. But she felt her unworthiness more. She had listened to the hymns  sung by the Salvation Army on some of the down-town corners, and, being  susceptible to impressions of this nature, had followed the singers into their  halls and heard some of the good words that are uttered there. Sometimes, I am  told, she laughed at what she heard, but oftener was seen to cry, and once she herself  sang till, as they said, the very heavens seemed to open. When I heard this, I  could not keep away from these meetings, though I never came upon her at any  one of them either on the East or West side. She seemed to anticipate my  approach there as elsewhere, for often have I been assured that she had just  that minute gone out, and must be somewhere near, though I never succeeded in  finding her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  looked to me then like hate, but now I think it was simply shame; for when she  knew that death was upon her she sent for me; and, seeing the old look of  forbearance on my face, she threw up her wasted arms, and, panting like a child  who has reached its mother&rsquo;s arms at last, turned her tired, tired face towards  my breast with a feeble &lsquo;Forgive!&rsquo; and died.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  cannot know the heart of a man who has followed his lost lamb for years through  tangled thickets and by headlong precipices, and it may seem strange for me to  pour into ears so hardened and necessarily so unsympathetic the sacred secrets  of my soul. But my position is a strange one and my story one that must be told  in its entirety for you to understand why that smile upon her face is so much  to me that my sole prayer at this time is to be allowed to remain in sight of  it for one hour. She has loved me always; not as I loved her, not to the point  of saving me one heartache or sparing me one erratic impulse of her ungoverned  nature, but still better than I feared; better than her conduct would show. For  when I came to lay her head down again upon its pillow, I found tied about her  neck and fast clutched in her chilling palm, <i>this</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Our  wedding ring,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;She might have pawned it for a dollar during any  of the many crises of her miserable life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  paused, put the token back in his breast, and added but one more word. &ldquo;When  she was alive and well, with vigour in her dancing foot, and a deathless unrest  in her gypsy heart, she chafed at my presence and fled from my protection. But  when the final shadow settled and she felt all other props give way, then her  poor arms rose in recognition of the love which had never failed her.&rdquo; There  was an indescribable tone of triumph in his tones. &ldquo;She had need of me in her  dying hours; she smiled&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  paused, and his eyes, which had been fixed on her form, rose instinctively, not  to the dingy rafters overhead, but to the heaven he saw above those rafters.  For him her spirit had fled upward. Whatever we might think of her, to him she  was henceforth a being blessed and gathered into a refuge from which she would  nevermore seek or wish to escape.</p>
  <p>* *  * * *</p>
  <p>It  was hard to break into this calm hopefulness with words of stern or sinister  meaning. But Mr. Gryce had no choice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What,  then, is your special desire?&rdquo; asked that officer.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gillespie&rsquo;s eyes fell, and for a moment he stood thinking, then he said;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have retribution to make to her memory. I wish to take her to my own house and bury  her from there as my wife. The humiliation from which my pride recoiled in the  old days has been meted out to me ten-fold. I no longer wish to evade my  responsibilities.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His  expression as he said this was very different from the smile I had surprised on  his face the night he stooped over his dead father. Yet the one brought up the  other, and, in a measure, acted as a mutual interpretation. By means of it and  the determination he had just expressed, I could comprehend the feeling of that  moment, when with police in the house and the whole family subjected to a  suspicion which involved it in the utmost disgrace, he contemplated the  features of the man whose pride found the hemisphere in which he lived too small  to hold both himself and the daughter whose worst fault was a proclivity to  dance and sing.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce, who had no such memories to reconcile, was meanwhile surveying the young  man with a curious hesitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  regret,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the presence of an obstacle to your very natural wish to  bury your wife from your own house. Mr. Gillespie, it is my duty to inform you  that we are not here on a simple errand of surveillance: my orders were to  arrest you on the charge of murdering your father.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_29"></a>Chapter 29<br>
    The Quiet Hour</b></h2>
  <p>I  would rather have been spared the pain of that moment. Mr. Gryce had virtually  promised that I should not be present at Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s arrest, but I presume  he forgot not only his promise but my very existence in the unexpected interest  of this extraordinary situation. Mr. Gillespie, who at another time might have  succumbed to the emotion of seeing himself singled out from his brothers on the  charge which had hitherto involved them all, was already in a state of too much  agitation to make much demonstration over this fresh humiliation. Nevertheless  it became evident, from the droop of his arms and the general air of  discouragement which crept into his whole bearing, that the iron had entered  his soul and the climax of his many woes had been reached.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hoped for other results when I entered upon my long and painful story,&rdquo; he  remarked. &ldquo;Certainly you have found me able to account for much that has seemed  anomalous in my relations to my father and the attitude I have been compelled  to preserve towards society. I am surprised that anyone should continue to  regard me as having had anything to do with my father&rsquo;s unhappy death. May I  ask what special evidence you imagine yourselves to have against me? I may be  able to refute it with a word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  was more than Mr. Gryce could grant, and he said so, though with less  imperturbability of manner than usual. &ldquo;I am under orders to bring you into the  presence of the District Attorney,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;who will use his own  discretion in the matter of having you detained. Will you accompany me quietly,  leaving the care of your wife to Mr. Outhwaite, who, I am sure, will follow  your wishes in the choice of such assistants as he may think necessary to  employ?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  look he received in return was eloquent in its appeal, but Mr. Gryce knew no  relenting where his duty was concerned, and, recognising this, Mr. Gillespie  took a fresh resolve and boldly said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have discovered that I carried a bottle of prussic acid into my father&rsquo;s house  the day before he died. Shall I tell you where I procured it? From the hand of  her who lies here. I found it tied about her neck, when, after months of  fruitless search, I was led to investigate Mother Merry&rsquo;s lodging-house. She  was asleep when I discovered it; asleep in a way I always found it impossible  to break, and the shock of finding her in quiet possession of what I instinctively  knew to be poison maddened me to such an extent that I tore the phial away from  her and put in its place a roll of bank-notes. These were probably stolen from  her, as no proof remains of her having used them; but the bottle I carried  away, having impulsively thrust it into my trousers&rsquo; pocket at the first  intimation I received of a raid being made upon the place by the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  explanation was so natural, and the manner in which it was made so convincing,  that the detective&rsquo;s look and mine crossed, and I became assured that he as  well as myself was beginning to give credence to this man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can give no information of the use which was made of this drug after its  introduction into my father&rsquo;s home, nor can I designate the hand which took it  from my bureau where I placed it on emptying my pockets. My connection with it  ended at the moment I speak of. I did not even think of it again till I came in  from the meeting where I had vainly sought distraction, and found my father  lying low and heard the cry of poison raised in the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This  would have been a welcome explanation at the time,&rdquo; commented Mr. Gryce. &ldquo;Your  delay has compromised you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  be it,&rdquo; was the short but proud reply which came from this singular man. &ldquo;When  you reflect that by the time I was able to satisfy myself that this bottle was  missing from the place where I had left it, any attempt to exonerate myself  would have been a virtual accusation of one of my two brothers, you will  realise why I hesitated to speak then, and only bring myself to speak now under  the compelling force of an interest greater than family pride or affection. In  my desire to share the last offices which can be paid to my wife, I possibly  show myself for the second time a coward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Did  he? Mr. Gryce did not seem to think so. The forehead of this aged detective was  clearing fast, and he actually looked younger by ten years than when he entered  this house. Yet his exactions remained the same, and Mr. Gillespie prepared to  accommodate himself to them.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile  the incessant hammering of the rain on the roof had become less noticeable, and  the drip, drip, on the sill without, less wearily persistent. There seemed,  too, a diminution in the turbulence of the wind; the doors and windows did not  rattle so loudly, and the worst noises in the yards below had ceased. Anxious  to see if the storm was abating, I raised the window and looked out. Rushing  clouds with great torn edges met my eye, and, below, a chaos of towering walls surrounding  an abyss in which the imagination could picture nothing save a collection of  foul yards and reeking alleys. Recoiling from a prospect which the condition of  my mind and heart made more than usually gloomy, I turned back from the  possible tragedies hidden behind those great walls to the actual one in which I  had myself been forced to take so ungracious a part. Mr. Gillespie was waiting  to speak to me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am allowed to give you the names of such people as can best assist you in the  removal of my wife,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Here they are, together with the address in  New Jersey where I wish her ultimately carried. Mr. Gryce will give you what  further information you need&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  placed a paper in my hand with a word of quiet thanks, to which I responded in  the manner I felt would be most pleasing to Hope. Then he cast a glance at the  detective.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have promised Mr. Gillespie the privilege of passing a moment in this room  unseen and alone,&rdquo; observed that official, stepping towards the door.</p>
  <p>I  bowed and withdrew, shutting Mr. Gillespie in and ourselves out. Instantly all  the noises in the house crowded clamorously to our ears. Laughter, singing,  brawling, the screaming of children and the scolding of their distracted  mothers, made a sort of pandemonium, which little harmonised with the mood  induced by the pathetic story we had just heard. But it was not for us to be  particular at such a moment, and I was glad that I had given no sign of my  inward disturbance, when Mr. Gryce suddenly remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am getting old.&rdquo; (His alert eye and attentive ear turned towards the room we  had just left did not seem to indicate it.) &ldquo;I find that such scenes make a  deeper impression upon me than formerly. I no longer dwell on the skill it  takes to bring them about, but rather muse upon the mistakes and woes of poor  humanity which make them possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  wished to ask him what he thought of Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s prospects, but he gave me  no encouragement to do so, and we remained silent till the door reopened and  Mr. Gillespie came out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am ready now,&rdquo; he quietly informed us. &ldquo;Mr. Outhwaite, I can trust you; and if  Hope&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped and looked the entreaty he dared not utter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  will tell her the whole story just as it has fallen from your lips. You wish me  to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  signified his assent, but still looked wistful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  she has heard the true cause of the division which has taken place between you  and other members of your family, she will act as her own kind heart will  prompt her,&rdquo; I added.</p>
  <p>He  would have pressed my hand, but remembering his position as a prisoner,  refrained.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let  us go,&rdquo; he now said, in natural recoil from the noises which just then burst in  renewed outcry from every quarter of the house.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gryce gave a faint whistle. It was answered in the same guarded manner from  below. At which the old detective turned to me with a few final directions,  after which, with a promise to leave me well guarded, he made a gesture which  Mr. Gillespie could not fail to understand. They began to descend. When Mr.  Gillespie was half-way down, he gave one backward look at the door swaying  between him and what he had loved best on earth; then he passed on, and I was  left standing on that dingy landing, alone.</p>
  <p>There  was some clamour and no little jeering in the rooms below as the detectives  passed through them with their well-dressed prisoner; but these tokens of class  animosity speedily weakened to a sullen growl, amidst which I thought I heard  the rattling of departing wheels.</p>
  <p>With  a heart as heavy as the silence which now filled the house, I turned and went  back into that room.</p>
  <p>It  was filled with moonlight. The candle from which the winding-sheet had long ago  melted and run upon the table, had flickered out, but its fitful flame was not  missed. The clouds which had seemed so impenetrable a short time before, had  thinned out and parted till they flecked, rather than covered, the white disk  of the moon, now revealed for the first time in days.</p>
  <p>That  storm and that clearing have never left my memory. As the last lingering shred  of cloud drifted away, leaving the face of the moon quite clear, I found  courage to look once more towards the bed.</p>
  <p>There  was a change there. She lay, not as before, with her features quite concealed,  but with her face exposed save where the loose curls had forced their way  across her cheeks and forehead. The coverlet, drawn close under her chin, hung  smooth and decent to the floor, and across it lay stretched one white arm, upon  the hand of which shone the wedding-ring which Leighton Gillespie had taken  from her neck and placed there.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_30"></a>Chapter 30<br>
    An Unexpected Ally</b></h2>
  <p>That  night was a busy one for me; nevertheless I found time to send a message to  Hope, in which I begged her to read no papers till she saw me, and, if  possible, to keep herself in her own room. To these hurried words I added the  comforting assurance that the news I had to bring her would repay her for this  display of self-control, and that I would not keep her waiting any longer than  was necessary. But it was fully ten o&rsquo;clock before I was able to keep this  promise, and I found her looking pale and worn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have obeyed you,&rdquo; she said, with an attempt at smiling as pitiful as it was  ineffectual. &ldquo;What has happened? Why did you not want me to see the papers or  talk with Mrs. Penrhyn?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I wished to be the first to tell you the secret of Leighton Gillespie&rsquo;s life.  It was not what was suggested to you by the discrepancies you observed between  his character and life. He is sane as any man, but&mdash;&rdquo; it was hard to proceed,  with those eyes of unspeakable longing looking straight into mine&mdash;&rdquo;but he has  had great sorrows to bear, great suspenses to endure, a deception to keep up, not  altogether justifiable, perhaps, but yet one that was not without some excuse.  His wife&mdash;Did you ever see his wife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she faltered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&mdash;Did  not perish in that disaster of five years ago, as everyone supposed; and it was  she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  came in a burst of sudden comprehension from Hope, as she sank down out of  sight among the curtains by the window. But the next moment she was standing  again, crying in low tones in which I caught a note of immeasurable relief, &ldquo;I  thank God! I thank God!&rdquo; Then the sobs came.</p>
  <p>I  noticed that, once she had taken in this fact of his personal rectitude, all  fear left her as to the truth of the more serious charge against him. Even after  I had explained to her how he came by the phial of poison, and how it was  through his agency it came to be in his father&rsquo;s house, no doubt came to mar  her restored confidence in this her most cherished relative. She even admitted  that, now this one unexplainable point in his character had been made clear to  her, she felt ready to meet any accusations which might be raised against him.  &ldquo;Let them publish their suspicions!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;He can bear them and so can I;  for now that he has been proven a true man, nothing else much matters. I may  blush at hearing his name,&mdash;it will be years, I think, before I shall overcome  that,&mdash;but it will be because I failed to see in his kindness to me the  sympathetic interest of one whose heart has been made tender towards women by  his wild longing after the wandering spirit whom he called his wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then  she asked where I had placed Mille-fleurs (a name so natural to Millicent  Gillespie that no other was ever suggested by her friends); and, having been  told where, said she would like to sit beside her until the time came to lay  her in the garden of that little home from which all shadow was now cleared  away save that of chastened sorrow.</p>
  <p>As  this was what Leighton Gillespie secretly wished, I promised to accompany her  to New Jersey, and then, taking this pure-hearted girl by the hand, I asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  I performed my task well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her  answer was&mdash;but that is my secret. Small reason as it gave me for personal hope,  I yet went from that house with my heart lightened of its heaviest load.</p>
  <p>I  did not read the papers myself that morning. I had little heart for a reporter&rsquo;s  version of what had so thrilled me coming from Leighton&rsquo;s own lips. Merely  satisfying myself that the latter was still in custody, I busied myself with  what came up in my office, till the stroke of five released me to a free  exercise of my own thoughts.</p>
  <p>How  much nearer were we to the solution of this mystery than we had been the  morning following Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s death? Not much; and while Hope and possibly  myself felt that the band of suspicion had narrowed in its circle, and by the  exclusion of Leighton, whom we could no longer look upon as guilty, left the  question of culpability to be settled between the two remaining sons of the  deceased stockbroker, to the world in general and to the readers of sensational  journals which now flooded the city with accounts of the most sacred incidents  of Leighton Gillespie&rsquo;s past life he was still the man through whose agency the  poison had entered the Gillespie house. Nor could we fail to see that the  feeling called out by these tales of his domestic infelicities and the wild  search in which most of his life had been passed had its reverse side for those  people who read all stories of disinterested affection with doubt, and place no  more faith in true religion than if the few bright spots made in the universal  history of mankind by acts of unselfish devotion had no basis in fact, and were  as imaginary as the dreams of poet or romancer.</p>
  <p>That  Leighton Gillespie had not been released after his conference with the District  Attorney was proof that his way was not as clear before him as I had hoped. Yet  I was positive that Mr. Gryce as well as Sweetwater shared my belief in his  innocence; and while this was a comfort to me, I found my mind much exercised  by the doubt as to what the next turn of the kaleidoscope would call up in this  ever-changing case.</p>
  <p>I  had not seen Underhill in days, and I rather dreaded a chance meeting. He did  not like Leighton, and would be the first to throw contempt upon any mercy  being shown him on account of his faithful attachment to his disreputable wife.  I seemed to hear the drawling query with which this favourite of the clubs  would end any attempt I might make in this direction: &ldquo;And so you think it  probable that a man&mdash;a man, remember, with a child liable to flutter in and out  of his room at all hours&mdash;would leave a phial of deadly poison on his dresser and  never think of it again? Not much, old man. If he laid it down there, which I  doubt, he took it up again. Don&rsquo;t waste your sympathy on a cad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Yet  I did; and to such an extent that I took a walk instead of going home and  hearing these imaginary sentences uttered in articulated words. I walked up  Madison Avenue, and, coming upon a store which had a reputation for an extra  fine brand of cigars, I went in to buy one.</p>
  <p>Have  you ever greatly desired an event which your common sense told you was most  unlikely to happen, and then suddenly seen it wrought out before you in the  most unforeseen manner and by the most ordinary of means? From the first night  of the tragedy with which these pages have been full, I had wished for an  interview with the old butler, without witnesses, and as the result of a  seeming chance. But I had never seen my way clear to this; and now, in this  place and in this unexpected manner, I came upon him buying fruit at a grocer&rsquo;s  counter.</p>
  <p>I  did not hesitate to approach him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you do, Hewson?&rdquo; said I, with a kindly tap on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>He  turned slowly, gave me a look that was half an apology and half an appeal, then  dropped his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you do, sir?&rdquo; said he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Been  buying oranges for the family?&rdquo; I went on. &ldquo;Startling news, this! I mean the  arrest of Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s second son. I never thought of him as the guilty one,  did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  old butler did not break all up as I expected. He only shook his head, and,  taking up the bundle which had just been handed him, remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  little know what&rsquo;s in the mind of the babies we dandle in our arms,&rdquo; and went  feebly out.</p>
  <p>I  laid down a quarter, took a cigar from the case, forgot to light it, and  sauntered into the street with it still in my hand. I felt thoroughly  discouraged, and walked down the avenue in a sort of black mist formed of my  own doubts and Hewson&rsquo;s calm acceptance of the guilt attributed to Leighton.  But suddenly I stopped, put the cigar in my pocket, and exclaimed in vehement  contradiction of my own uneasy thoughts: &ldquo;Leighton Gillespie is as guiltless of  his father&rsquo;s death as of other charges which have been made against him. I am  ready to stake my own honour upon it,&rdquo; and went immediately to my apartments,  without stopping, as I usually did, at Underhill&rsquo;s door.</p>
  <p>I  found a young man waiting for me in the vestibule. He had evidently been  standing there for some time, for he no sooner heard my step than he gave a  bound forward with the eager cry:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is I, sir,&mdash;Sweetwater.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  was a welcome visitor at that moment, and I was willing he should realise it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  in; come in,&rdquo; I urged. &ldquo;New developments, eh? Mr. Gillespie released, perhaps,  or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  was his disappointing response as the door closed behind us and he sank into  the chair I pushed forward. &ldquo;Mr. Gillespie is still in detention and there are  no new developments. But another day must not pass without them. I was witness  to the sympathy you felt last night for the man who claimed the wretched being  we saw before us for his wife; and, feeling a little soft-hearted towards him  myself, I have come to ask you to lay your head with mine over this case in the  hope that we two together may light upon some clue which will lead to his immediate  enlargement. For I cannot believe him guilty; I just cannot. It was one of the  others. But which one? I don&rsquo;t mean to eat or sleep till I find out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Mr. Gryce?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t bother. Last night was too much for him, and he has gone home. The field  is clear, sir, quite clear; and I mean to profit by it. Leighton Gillespie  shall be freed in time to attend his wife&rsquo;s funeral or I will give up the  detective business and go back to the carpenter&rsquo;s bench and my dear old mother  in Sutherlandtown.&rdquo;</p>

    Sweetwater Has An Idea</b></h2>
  <p>I  was greatly interested. Taking out a box of cigars, I laid it before him on the  table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  free with them,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;If there is any help to be got out of smoke let us  make use of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  eyed the cigars ruefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  bad,&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;unfortunately, it does not work that way with me. Some  people think better between whiffs, but smoking clouds my faculties, and I  would be no friend to Mr. Gillespie if I took your cigars now. Free air and an  undisturbed mind for Caleb Sweetwater when he settles down to work. Smoke  yourself, sir; that won&rsquo;t affect me; but draw the box to your side of the table  and give me a rebuking look if my hand goes out to it before this subject is  settled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  did as he requested, but not to the point of taking a cigar. I could think  without its aid as well as he.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  sir,&rdquo; he immediately began, &ldquo;you were the first man to enter upon the scene of  crime. May I ask if you will be so good as to relate afresh and  circumstantially your whole experience with Mr. Gillespie? You cannot be too  minute in your details. Somehow or somewhere we have missed the clue necessary  to the clearing up of this case. You may be able to supply it. Will it bore you  too much to try?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  in the least. I am as anxious as yourself to get at the bottom of this  business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Begin,  then, sir. You won&rsquo;t mind my closing my eyes? I find it so much easier to  identify myself with the situation when I see nothing about to distract me.  And, sir, since I dread speaking when actively absorbed in this kind of work,  will you pardon me if I simply raise my finger when I want a minute for  reflection? I know I am a crank, and not much used to gentlemen&rsquo;s ways, but I  appreciate kindness more than most folks, especially when it takes the form of  respect paid to my whims.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  assured him I was only too ready to do anything which would serve to further  the end we had in view; and all preliminaries being thus amicably settled he  dropped his head into his hands and I began my tale in much the same language I  have used in these pages. He listened without a movement while I spoke of  Claire and of my entrance into the house, but his finger went up when I  mentioned the appearance presented by Mr. Gillespie as he stood propping  himself against the table in a condition of impending collapse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  the house quiet?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Did you hear no sneaking step in the halls or  adjacent dining-room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  a step. I remember receiving the impression that this old gentleman and his  grandchild were all alone in the house. One of the greatest surprises of my  life was the discovery that there were servants in the basement and more than  one member of the family on the floors above.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  discovery which leads to our first argument, sir. We have taken it for granted  (and certainly we were justified in doing so) that Mr. Gillespie knew whose  hand poured out the poison he felt burning into his vitals. We have argued that  it was this knowledge which led him to spend the final moments of his life in  an extraordinary effort to settle the doubts of his favourite niece. But, sir,  if he had had this knowledge, would he not have mentioned outright and without  any circumlocution the name of the son he had finally settled upon as the guilty  one, rather than have made use of the same vague phrase which had been his  torment and hers, ever since the hour he told her of the shadowy hand he had  detected hovering over his glass of medicine? With the remembrance in your mind  of the few words he left behind him, are you ready to declare that you find in  them any proof of his knowing then, any better than before, which of his three  sons had mingled poison with his drink? And, sir,&mdash;you are a lawyer,&mdash;does it  follow from any evidence we have since received that he even positively knew it  was one of these three men? Might not his fears and the haunting memory of that  former attempt have so worked upon his failing faculties that he took for  granted it was one of his sons who had made this last effort at poisoning him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is possible,&rdquo; I admitted, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t place much stress on the suggestion.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said I, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. Anxious as I am that each and all of these young men should  be relieved from the appalling charge of parricide, I saw too great a display  of anxiety on his part for the right delivery of what he believed to hold the  last communication he had to make to his favourite niece, for me to think these  final words of his contained nothing more definite than a repetition of his  former vague surmise. He was facing immediate death, yet all his thought, all  his fast-ebbing strength, were devoted to the effort of making her know that he  had not been mistaken in his former conclusion: that it <i>was</i> one of his sons who sought his life, and that this son had now actually  succeeded in poisoning him. That he did not proceed further and name which one,  was due probably to a sudden loss of strength. That he meant to say more than  he did is evident from the <i>he</i> which follows  the four words we have been considering.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  true, but my argument holds; an argument which the difficulties of the case  surely justify me in advancing. You say he would never have made such an effort  to insure the safe delivery of words that were a mere repetition of a former  statement. Yet what more were they in the unfinished condition in which we find  them? Do you think he could have been blind to the fact that he had not  succeeded in mentioning the name which alone could give value to his  accusation, and make its safe delivery a matter of real moment to Miss Meredith?  Surely, sir, you do not believe his wits were so far gone that he regarded  himself as having made his suspicions clear in those five words: <i>one of my sons he</i>?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I do not. Yet who can tell. Bright as his eye was, his faculty of memory as  well as of observation may have left him. Witness how he tore off the blank  edge of the paper, instead of the words he wished to send.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater&rsquo;s  tone was gloomy; a cloud seemed to have settled upon his newly risen hopes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo;  I now felt bound to admit, &ldquo;I cannot quite bring myself to believe that he was  so bewildered. On the contrary, I feel confident that he was in full possession  of his faculties when he cast that dramatic glance upward, which, by a happy  inspiration, I was led to interpret as meaning Hope. If we could penetrate this  matter to its very core, I believe we should find the truth we seek either in  those five words themselves or in the means he took of getting them to Miss Meredith.  Have you ever thought, Sweetwater, that we have not given all the attention we  should to the latter fact?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo; His hands had fallen from his face, and he spoke with volubility. &ldquo;It has  struck you, I see, as oddly as it has us, that it was a very strange thing for  him to send into the street for a messenger when he had one right at his hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Claire,  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  Claire is a child; the slip of paper to which he attached such importance was  unsealed and he dreaded its falling into wrong hands. Miss Meredith already  knew his secret, but for him to proclaim openly that his death was due to the  hatred or cupidity of one of his children would not be the act of a father who  already, at the cost of so much misery to himself,&mdash;nay, as it proved, at the  cost of his life,&mdash;had kept back from every ear save that of the one confidant  of his misery, a knowledge of the fact that a previous attempt had been made  upon his life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  to send into the street for a messenger! Why not send for one of the servants?  Or why, if he knew which son he had cause to fear, did he not bid the child  bring down one of the others?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leighton  was out, George was half drunk, and Alfred was two flights up. Besides, he  might have thought that an alarm of this kind would prevent the delivery of the  letter on which he laid such stress. Who knows what goes on in the mind of a  man conscious of having but one minute in which to perform the most important  act of his life?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True,  true, sir; and yet there is something unnatural in his conduct, something I  fail to understand. But I don&rsquo;t despair. I won&rsquo;t despair; we have only begun  the recapitulation of details from which I hope so much; supposing we go on.&rdquo;  And he sunk his head again in his hands.</p>
  <p>I  at once took up the thread of my relation at the point where I had dropped it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  I approached Mr. Gillespie I noted three things besides his tortured face and  sinking figure. First, that the shade was pulled up over his desk; second, that  a typewriter stood close to his hand; and third, that a pot of paste, knocked  over by some previous movement on his part, lay near the typewriter, with its  contents oozing over a sheet of unused paper. You ask me to mention all details  and I have done so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dreamily  he moved his finger, but whether in thanks or in an injunction for me to  continue, I could not determine. I therefore remained still.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw the paste,&rdquo; he murmured. And taking this as an intimation to proceed, I  went on till I came to the moment when I pulled down the shade.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  glanced out as you did that?&rdquo; said he, lifting his finger as a signal for me to  pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  saw Mr. Rosenthal in his room in the neighbouring extension?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Standing  how? With his back or his face to the window?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His  back. He was sauntering about his room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  that settles one fact. He had not been looking into Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s room at a  critical moment. Had he seen that gentleman in a suffering condition or noted  the curious incidents following your entrance, he would have been held to the  spot by his curiosity, and you would have encountered his eager face staring  down upon a scene of such uncommon interest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  true. All he saw was the seemingly insignificant incident of Mr. Gillespie  emptying the contents of a wine-glass out of his window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As  Sweetwater had no remark to make to this, I proceeded with my narrative,  relating, with a careful attention to details, my journey upstairs, the words I  had overheard at the door of Alfred&rsquo;s room, my first sight of Hope, and&mdash;I was  proceeding to describe the results of my intrusion into the Gillespie attic, when  I perceived that Sweetwater was no longer listening. His head, which he had  raised from between his hands, was turned my way, but his eyes were looking  into space and his whole body was quivering in intense excitement, such as I  have seldom seen. As I paused, he came back to earth and jumped to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo;  he cried. &ldquo;Come with me to the Gillespie house. I have an idea. It may not  stand the test, it may prove a fatuous one, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  very hair on his forehead was bristling; the eagerness he tried to keep out of  his voice showed itself in his eyes and in every jerking movement which he  made.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo;  he cried again; &ldquo;it is not late. We will find the young gentlemen at home and  perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  added nothing to that significant &ldquo;perhaps,&rdquo; but his repressed excitement had  awakened mine, and my hat was on and I was following him down stairs before I  realised that I had failed to turn out my gas.</p>
  <p>As  I wheeled about with the intention of rectifying this oversight, I encountered  Underhill&rsquo;s languid figure loitering in his doorway. He accosted me with an  easy:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Halloo,  Outhwaite!&rdquo; Then, as he leaned close enough to whisper in my ear, he added, in  an indescribable drawl, these unexpected words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  recognise your friend there. If you are piling up the evidence against poor  Leighton Gillespie, you are doing wrong. No fellow with a heart like his ever  put poison into his father&rsquo;s wine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Which  shows the folly of thinking you know a man&rsquo;s mind before he speaks it.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_32"></a>Chapter 32<br>
    With The Shade Down</b></h2>
  <p>Not  many words passed between Sweetwater and myself on our way up the Avenue. He  had his &ldquo;idea&rdquo; to brood upon, while I was engaged in turning over in my mind  various vague conjectures rising out of the argument we had just indulged in.  But before reaching the point of our destination, I ventured upon one question.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you, during any of your investigations, public or private, learned which of the  three sons of Mr. Gillespie is the greatest favourite with the old family  servant, Hewson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  that is, yes. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  if it is not Leighton&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  it certainly is not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I advise you to direct your energies towards the one he is known to like best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  stopped short and surveyed me in very evident surprise before venturing upon  the following remark:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like to know just why you say that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  replied by relating my interview with the butler in the drug-store, and his  easy acceptance of Leighton&rsquo;s guilt as implied in the arrest which had just  taken place.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  listened and moved on; but so quickly now I could hardly keep pace with him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  my idea has no will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp uncertainty in it, and I have lighted upon a  way out of this mystery, I will be made for life,&rdquo; he declared, as we reached  the Gillespie house and he paused for a moment at the foot of the steps. &ldquo;But  there! I&rsquo;m counting chickens&mdash;something which Mr. Gryce never approves of at any  stage of the game.&rdquo; And rushing up the stoop, he rang the bell, while I waited  below with my heart in my mouth, as they say.</p>
  <p>Who  would respond to the summons; and if we effected an entrance&mdash;which I felt to be  a matter of some doubt&mdash;whom would we be likely to come upon in a visit of this  nature? George? Alfred? I did not like to ask, and Sweetwater did not volunteer  to inform me.</p>
  <p>The  opening of the door cut short my reflections as well as gave answer to my  last-mentioned doubt. Old Hewson, and Hewson only, opened the door of this  house; and whether this renewed encounter with his patient figure had something  disappointing in it, or whether the solemn grandeur of the interior thus  quietly disclosed to view produced an impression of family life that was more  than painful under the circumstances, I experienced a recoil from the errand  which had brought me there, and would have retreated if I had not recalled Hope&rsquo;s  interest in this matter, and the joy it would give her to see Leighton  Gillespie proved innocent of the crime for which he was at present held in  custody.</p>
  <p>Meantime,  Sweetwater, with an air of perfect nonchalance admirably assumed, had stepped  past Hewson into the house. Evidently he was accustomed to go in and out of the  place at will, and though the old servant did not fail to show his indignation  at this palpable infringement upon the family dignity, he did not abate a jot  of his usual politeness or even watch the unwelcome intruder too closely in his  passage down the hall.</p>
  <p>But  his complaisance did not extend to me. He gave me a look which demanded a  response.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some  formality of the law!&rdquo; I whispered, hoping that the unaccustomed words would  befog the old man sufficiently to cover my own embarrassment, and answer any  doubts he might have as to the purpose of our errand there. And perhaps they  did, for, with some muttered words, among which I heard this pathetic phrase, &ldquo;There  are so many of them!&rdquo; he crept away and disappeared through the door leading  into the dining-room. As he did so, I noted a man sitting on a settee pushed well  into the corner near the study door. I did not know this man; I only noted that  he sat there very quietly, and that the only movement he made at our approach  was a slight raising and falling of his fingers on his crossed arms.</p>
  <p>We  were making for the study behind the stairs, and into this room Sweetwater,  after unlocking it with a key he had taken from his pocket, now walked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you object to visiting this place again?&rdquo; he asked, striking a match and  reaching up to light the gas.</p>
  <p>Of  course I answered no, yet it was not quite a pleasant experience to stand there  and watch the light flickering on his face, in a spot where I had last seen the  one horrid spectacle of my life.</p>
  <p>But  when the cheerful flame had sprung up, and walls made familiar not by long  seeing but close seeing had come into view, I was conscious simply of a strong  desire to know why I had been brought to this room in such haste and secrecy,  and what the &ldquo;idea&rdquo; was which had produced so marked an effect upon my singular  companion.</p>
  <p>He  showed no immediate intention of enlightening me. He was engaged in casting a  keen glance about him, a glance which seemingly took in every detail of the  well-remembered room; then, as if satisfied that nothing had been disturbed  since his last visit, he advanced to the window and pulled down the shade.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will not have the curious Mr. Rosenthal giving away <i>our</i> secrets,&rdquo; he dryly commented. &ldquo;And this is our secret, is it  not? You won&rsquo;t feel called upon to repeat outside what goes on between us in this  room?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  assurance seemed unnecessary, but I did not regret giving it when I saw how it  relieved him of all doubt, and caused his eye to lighten and his manner to grow  easy as he went on to say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far as mortal calculation can go, this room has not been entered by anyone but  the police or persons acting under the instructions of the police, since the  hour when Mr. Gillespie was carried out of it. Consequently we have a right to  expect all articles remaining here to be in the same condition as on that  night. This, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  had taken out the typewriter from a closet built in one of the corners, and set  it as he spoke down in its old place on the edge of the desk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  I burst forth. &ldquo;Your idea is in connection with this typewriter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  frowned, or almost frowned, for he was an amiable fellow; then, giving me a  pleading look, observed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am young yet, Mr. Outhwaite, and it is very easy for me to deceive myself with  imaginary results. You will therefore allow me a minute to myself, and if I  find out that I have struck a false trail, or if my idea proves to be one I  cannot sustain by facts, I&rsquo;ll sing out and we will consult as to our next move.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I step outside?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>But  this he would not listen to.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  I want,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is for you to look the other way while I stoop over this  typewriter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  naturally felt disposed to humour him, and meanwhile he remained so still that  I was confident he did not touch the instrument. But the cry which impetuously  burst from him after a moment of intense stillness startled me so I can never  forget it. It was something between a sob and a shout, and it was so suggestive  of triumph that I could not forbear turning about and rushing up to the  instrument over which he still stooped.</p>
  <p>He  greeted me with a look of delight and a rush of confused gestures.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See,  sir; oh, see! How I wish Mr. Gryce were here! Look at the top of that key, sir&mdash;the  one with the words, &lsquo;Shift key&rsquo; on it. Yes, that one; that! What is the matter  with it? Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  face of it is obscured. I can scarcely read the words. There is something on  it. Something like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Paste!&rdquo;  he cried. &ldquo;The paste that ran out of the bottle and spread over the desk. You  can still see unmistakable signs of it here and here&rdquo; (pointing rapidly as he  spoke), &ldquo;for Mr. Gryce would not allow a woman in the room, and nothing has  been cleaned since that night. The paste is but a dry crust now, but you must  remember that it was moist when Mr. Gillespie stooped over the table, so that  when his fingers got into it in his struggle to reach the typewriter, he  readily transferred it to the keys. This will be apparent to you if you will scrutinise  the exact keys he made use of in writing those last five words. Observe the one  marked<i> e</i>; now this <i>n</i>, and now the <i>o</i>. There is but a trace of paste on some of them; but it is thick  on the <i>e</i>, and thicker still on&mdash;what  key, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  one you first drew my attention to; the one marked &lsquo;Shift key.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just  so. Now, do you know the use of the &lsquo;Shift key?&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  press it down when you wish the letter you are writing to be a capital. For  instance, I wish to write the capital I. I hold down this &lsquo;Shift key&rsquo; with one  finger and strike the key marked <i>i</i> with another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know what you are going to say: &lsquo;No capital appears in the five words we are  now considering.&rsquo; True, sir, but does not this paste on the &lsquo;Shift key&rsquo; show  that he made an effort to write one; that a capital was in his mind even if it  did not get on paper? In beginning any communication, one naturally starts with  a capital, and you see, sir, that the space between this last hurriedly added  phrase and the words of his unfinished letter is long enough to hold one. But  the haste and agitation of this dying man were such that he did not put enough  force into his stroke to bring an impression of this opening capital. If,  therefore, we would read this communication intelligently, it is imperative  upon us to supply this missing capital. Now, what letter do you think he meant  to write there and did not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  blankly shook my head. My thoughts were in a great whirl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is but one,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;which would make any sense; the letter N, sir, the  famous letter N. Supply that letter, sir; then tell me how those words would  read. You know them well, or, stay, I have them here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  Sweetwater spread before me a copy of the letter as it appeared after Mr.  Gillespie had added the five words which had moulded the whole course of the  investigation up to this point.</p>
  <p>But  this was an unnecessary precaution on his part. I knew the words by heart, and  already had prefixed to them the capital N which he had just convinced me  belonged there, as witness:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;one  of my sons he&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  of my sons he&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  I cried, &ldquo;what a difference!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Young  Sweetwater&rsquo;s face absolutely shone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  there?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I got that idea while you were talking about Miss Meredith.  But that is not all. We are not through with our experiments yet. A letter  prefixed is not enough. We need to affix a few. Can you supply them?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  stared at him in amazement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;<i>None of my sons he</i>&rsquo; fails to make good  sense, Mr. Outhwaite. But look!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Replacing  the paper in the typewriter, he pressed a few keys, lifted the carriage, and  drew me down to see. Imagine my amazement and the shock given to all my  previous convictions when I saw written before me these words:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None  of my sons hewson.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_33"></a>Chapter 33<br>
    In Which We Can Pardon Mr. Gryce His Unfortunate Illness</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;You  didn&rsquo;t expect that? I thought I would surprise you, sir. Oh, I know what you  want to say!&rdquo; Sweetwater eagerly continued. &ldquo;You miss the period and capital H  which would show &lsquo;he&rsquo; to be the beginning of a proper name. But, sir, Mr.  Gillespie would not have been the failing man he was, if by this time he could  think of capitals, much less periods. He was not even able to complete the  word, though he evidently failed to realise this. &lsquo;None of my sons. Hewson&rsquo; is  what was in his mind; you may take my word for that. And now,&rdquo; he triumphantly  concluded, after a short but satisfied contemplation of my face, &ldquo;you can see  why this dying man should expend his last energies in insuring the safe  delivery of these words to the one person who knew his former dreadful suspicions.  Shrinking as any father might from letting his sons know to what a fearful  extent he had misjudged them, and dreading, as he doubtless had good reason to,  some interference on the part of Hewson if he attempted to call any one in the  house to his aid, he sent his little grandchild into the street&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know we are dealing with mere possibilities as yet, sir. But these possibilities  are much more credible than the surmises in which we have hitherto indulged. I  feel as if free air had entered my lungs for the first time since the inquest;  and if I can refrain from yielding too much to the intoxication of it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;  I again repeated, determined to have my say out before he had gone too far, &ldquo;what  motive can you ascribe to this poor old servant for a death which robbed him of  a master he had served devotedly for years?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Motive  be &mdash;!&rdquo; cried Sweetwater, in some heat. But, with his usual good nature, he  instantly begged my pardon, and his next words were uttered with more  restraint. &ldquo;Facts first, motives afterwards. What motive have we been able to  find for the committal of this deed by any one of his sons? Yet each and all of  them have been suspected and almost arraigned. Still,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;if you  want a motive, search for it here,&rdquo; and he drew from his pocket a second folded  paper, which he opened out before my eyes.</p>
  <p>It  was a copy of Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  I cried, in dim perception of what he meant.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  thousand dollars,&rdquo; explained Sweetwater. &ldquo;Not much in your eyes, but quite a  fortune in his.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  for so paltry a legacy you think that this man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater&rsquo;s  finger went to his lips. &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but had we not better put back  this typewriter on the shelf from which we took it? If I do not mistake, it  will figure largely in the trial which I plainly see approaching.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  nodded, recognising the wisdom of the admonition thus given, and together we  placed the typewriter back in the closet. Then he turned towards me with a new  light in his small grey eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now, sir,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;let me request you to stand back a trifle. I am going to  finish this business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Opening  the door with a sudden jerk, he plunged into the hall. A shadow was just  disappearing from the opposite doorway. With a shout to me to light up, he  leaped across the hall into the dining-room. The next minute I heard a cry,  then a low gurgle; then the match I had hastily struck flared up, and I beheld  the detective holding down the butler and looking eagerly towards me for the  expected light.</p>
  <p>The  man in the hall was by this time at my side, and between us we soon had three  jets lit, illuminating two white faces: Sweetwater&rsquo;s pale with triumph, Hewson&rsquo;s  blue-white from fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murderer!  Poisoner of your benefactor and friend, I have you at last!&rdquo; cried the  struggling detective, watching how each terrible word he hurled blanched to a  greater and greater degree the face he held pressed back for our inspection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  could see without faltering your master&rsquo;s sons, the boys you have dandled on  your knee, fall one after the other under the shadow of public suspicion. Now  we will see if you can show as much heroism on your own account. You are the  man who drugged Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s wine; and if the officer here will take you in  charge for an hour or so, I will go down and procure a warrant for your arrest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  attack was so sudden, and Sweetwater&rsquo;s manner one of such complete conviction,  that the old man succumbed to it without a struggle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo;  he moaned. &ldquo;I was old&mdash;tired of work&mdash;a little home&mdash;a little freedom in my old  age&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I  fled from the room. It seemed as if the walls must cave in upon us. For this,  for this!</p>
  <p>The  sight of a half-dozen frightened faces in the hall restored my self-possession.  The servants had come up from below and stood crowding and jostling each other  just as they had done three weeks before. At the sight of Hewson&rsquo;s cowering  figure they began to moan and cry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  quiet there!&rdquo; exhorted Sweetwater, advancing upon them with the courage born of  his triumphant success. &ldquo;The old man whom you have doubtless thought the  best-hearted and most reliable of you all has just confessed to the crime which  has desolated this house and all but ruined the three young gentlemen, your  masters. Cry away if you want to, but cry quietly and without giving the least  alarm, for the good news has not gone upstairs yet, and this gentleman, who was  the first to announce Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s death to his sons, naturally would like the  satisfaction of telling them that his murderer has been found. I have no doubt  that Mr. George and his brother are to be found above.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  be, sir, they be,&rdquo; spoke up a voice.</p>
  <p>Sweetwater,  whose divination of my wishes struck me as remarkable, stepped aside at this,  and, waiting for me to pass him, followed me to the floor above with a step so  light he seemed to be buoyed up by wings.</p>
  <p>As  on a former memorable occasion, I stopped at George&rsquo;s door first. The knock I  gave was followed by a rather surly invitation to enter. Excusing his  un-graciousness in consideration of the fact that his visitors of late had not  been entirely those of his own choice and consequently far from welcome, I  pushed open the door without any other exhibition of feeling than an apologetic  smile.</p>
  <p>A  scene of disorder confronted me; the disorder of an idle man who feels that  with the withdrawal of all women from the house he had lost all incentive to  neatness, perhaps to decency. In its midst, and lolling on a table over which  lay spread some cards he was pushing about with idle fingers, sat George, much  the worse for liquor, and by just that much short of being the handsome man he  was intended to be by nature.</p>
  <p>At  sight of me he rose, and, propping himself forward on the table, looked the  inquiry he was probably unable to formulate in words. I answered as if he had  spoken:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must pardon my intrusion, Mr. Gillespie. I have come to bring you very good  news.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  news?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;News  of your brother&rsquo;s speedy release. News of your father&rsquo;s murderer, who, though  an inmate of his house, does not bear the name of Gillespie. It is your butler,  Hewson&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a shout he threw out his hands, and then sank panting and with drooped head  into the chair mercifully at hand to receive him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have always sworn that Leighton was innocent,&rdquo; he cried out with unexpected  vehemence. &ldquo;In public and private, declared that&mdash;he could&mdash;no more&mdash;have done&mdash;that  thing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sweetwater  slipped from the room and I quietly followed, shutting the door softly behind  me.</p>
  <p>We  went directly above; and this time found the room we wished to visit, open. As  the face of its natural occupant could be plainly seen from where we stood, we  gratified our curiosity by a momentary contemplation of it. Like his brother,  Alfred Gillespie was sitting at a table, but he was neither flushed with wine  nor engaged in idle revery. On the contrary, he was very busy writing letters.  But he was not satisfied with his work. He looked restless and disturbed, and,  in the minute or two we stood there watching him, tore up the wretched scrawls  he had just indited, with a groan indicative not only of impatience, but deep,  almost heartrending anguish. On his pale brow and in his attenuated frame few  signs remained of the once luxurious Alfred, and when, after a second attempt  at expressing himself, he made a dash at the unfinished letter and, crumpling  it to nothing in his hand, threw it into the fire, I turned to Sweetwater and whispered:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cut  this misery short.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  young detective nodded, and with a clearing of his throat, meant, I am sure, as  a warning, he advanced and entered the room, into which I rapidly followed him.  Without pausing for any greeting from the astonished Alfred, he at once  presented me in the following manner:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Gillespie, will you allow me the honour of presenting Mr. Outhwaite, who has  come to offer you his hearty congratulations?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Congratulations!&rdquo;  I don&rsquo;t know whether I was more moved by the sarcasm or the despair expressed  in this repetition of the word, which must have fallen with strange effect on  Alfred Gillespie&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;For what, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  the speedy lifting of the cloud which has darkened this house; for the free and  honourable return of your brother from his present place of detention, and the  incarceration in his stead of the old man, Hewson, who has just confessed to  the crime of having poisoned your father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hewson!  Old Hewson!&rdquo; Alfred rose with a wild laugh that was not unlike a curse. &ldquo;You  are playing with me! You are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I interposed, with a decision he could not but recognise. &ldquo;Far from it, Mr.  Gillespie. What the detective says is true. Hewson acknowledges the whole  thing. He wanted a little home, knew that a legacy awaited him at your father&rsquo;s  death, and wished to hasten his enjoyment of it. Your father recognised him as  his poisoner when too late. He tried to communicate the fact to Miss Meredith  in the five words: &lsquo;None of my sons. Hewson,&rsquo; but his strength failed him, and  he only succeeded in impressing on the paper the unfinished words: &lsquo;<i>one of my sons he</i>.&rsquo; The detective will  explain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  was his troubled response, as he sank back into the seat from which he had  risen. Then as he met our eyes fixed sympathetically upon him, he dropped his  head upon his arms, crying brokenly: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me! Don&rsquo;t look at me! All  this misery and shame! And it was Hewson! Oh, Hope! Hope!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We  left him. It was all we could do. As we stepped down together into the lower  hall, Sweetwater remarked to me, with one of his rare smiles:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you know of anyone to whom this unexpected clearing of the Gillespie name will  be especially gratifying, you are at liberty now to make the good news known. I&rsquo;m  off for police headquarters, there to begin those proceedings which will  release Leighton Gillespie in time to meet the body of his wife at Communipaw.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_34"></a>Chapter 34<br>
  &ldquo;It Was The Shock!&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Later,  Hewson made a fuller confession. In it, he explained how he first came to  meditate the crime which he afterwards carried out with such diabolic  persistence.</p>
  <p>He  had never indulged himself in dishonest longings, never allowed himself to  dream of any other life than that of daily work in the household of which he  had for so many years been a member, until the day he was called into his  master&rsquo;s study on some errand or other which led him to the desk. A memorandum  was lying there, and as he had his glasses on, he could not help seeing his own  name among a list of others, with the figures $1000 against it. Now, it was no  secret in the house that his master was at this very time engaged in drawing up  his will. Indeed, the lawyer had been there that very morning. Consequently,  Hewson immediately drew the inference that these figures represented the amount  he was to receive upon his master&rsquo;s death, and though at the moment he  experienced nothing but gratitude for the good-will thus shown, the knowledge  of what he might expect under certain circumstances slowly roused in him strange  ambitions and new desires, which afterwards resolved themselves into longings  which gave him no rest day or night.</p>
  <p>The  relief from daily routine,&mdash;a little home in a country place where he could  raise vegetables and flowers,&mdash;a quiet smoke in the twilight on a porch all his  own,&mdash;all this would be paradise to the tired old man, and as he dwelt upon its  charms he became impatient at his master&rsquo;s robust health, and began to note the  difference in their years&mdash;which, alas! were entirely in his master&rsquo;s favour;  and to think&mdash;yes, to think&mdash;that though it would cause him regret&mdash;naturally so&mdash;to  see that master&rsquo;s health give way, it would not be so hard as this endless  counting of years nothing but disease could annul; that, in short, a lifetime  of service devoted to Mr. Gillespie and his sons had become as nothing in the  light of his new desires, and when the usually healthy broker was finally  seized with some complaint which laid him on his back, these desires grew into  hopes which it was useless for him to smother, for he was now determined to  have his little fortune whether or no, and have it before he was himself too old  to miss its full enjoyment.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  he was much in the confidence of the family. He heard his master&rsquo;s symptoms  discussed, and learned while waiting on table that Mr. Gillespie was being  given small doses of a certain poison as medicine; doses which it would be  dangerous to increase. He could go through all his duties with the utmost  precision without ceasing to take in such a conversation; and when in the  course of time he heard that Mr. Gillespie was improving and would soon be  quite well, he allowed himself to dwell upon the tempter&rsquo;s whispered suggestion  that three more little drops from a bottle constantly in use by his master&rsquo;s  bedside would remedy all this, and in a safe and seemingly natural way end the  one existence which stood between him and the money he now regarded as his own.</p>
  <p>The  carrying out of this thought was easy. He knew that his master was now well  enough to be left alone at night, likewise to help himself to his own medicine  after it was once prepared for him. One had only to steal into the room in the  early hours of the night, and, with careful manipulation of bottle and glass,  increase that dose before the time came for the sick man to want it. Hewson was  accustomed to noiseless actions; he could even handle glass without a sound,  having been trained in quiet ways by the very man who, in such an unexpected manner,  was now destined to fall a victim to these very precautions. He therefore did  not fear waking Mr. Gillespie; he only feared finding him already awake.</p>
  <p>But  even this possibility lost its terrors when he considered that to make himself  quite safe he had but to utter the low-whispered <i>Father!</i> with which the young gentlemen were accustomed to approach the  sick-bed at night. If Mr. Gillespie heard and answered, he would know the  moment badly chosen and steal away. While, if no answer came, he had but to  proceed as the devil and his own dark instincts prompted.</p>
  <p>Night  came, and he went through his part, as he supposed, successfully; but in the  morning he missed the alarm he had a right to expect, and soon learned that Mr.  Gillespie had accidentally overthrown the glass of medicine which had been so  carefully prepared for him. Worse than this, he saw the bottle of poison  emptied clean out, and heard that Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s medicine was to be changed to  one quite harmless.</p>
  <p>What  did this mean, and how could he now hope to carry out the scheme he was more  than ever resolved upon? For a while he felt quite discouraged, and drooped a  little over his work, which was becoming hourly more irksome. He began to hate  the man who had upset the glass which, if drank, would have insured him an  immediate enjoyment of his little fortune; and even to cherish the same feeling  towards Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s three sons, to whose wants he catered and who were all young  enough to wait for their fortunes, while he, now nearly four-score, could not.  That is, he hated the two eldest; but Alfred&mdash;well, he didn&rsquo;t quite hate Alfred;  indeed, he almost loved him, loved him well enough to be glad that he, as well  as himself, would profit by the old man&rsquo;s death, if only some new way could be found  of bringing it safely about.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  he found as many errands to his master&rsquo;s rooms as possible, especially when the  doctor was there; and, being regarded as a piece of household furniture rather  than a living, breathing, and determined man, these two rarely made an end to  their talk or changed their topic on account of his presence. And so it was he  heard them often discuss poisons, and was able to gather up one or two items in  regard to these dangerous drugs which otherwise he might have missed. Among  other things he learned that an acid smelling like bitter almonds killed quickly  and without much pain; but he failed to take in that this very smell was  calculated to give away its presence. Brooding over this happy discovery, he  cast about in his mind how he could prepare a drink likely to please his master  without awakening his distrust. For weeks he thought it over, testing and  trying various concoctions. Finally he hit on one which he prepared under Mr.  Gillespie&rsquo;s eye and partially under his directions, and which was so strongly  spiced that his master did not detect, or at least made no objection, to the flavouring  of bitter almonds which he was careful to put into it. Indeed, Mr. Gillespie  grew to like it, and, for a reason now readily to be understood, seemed to  prefer anything brought him by his old servant to the finest of wines poured  out for him by his sons.</p>
  <p>Having  thus provided a means for disguising the poison when the opportunity came for  administering it, he cast about how he could procure the necessary drug without  risk to himself. Ignorant as he was in most matters, he knew that he could not  walk into a drug-store and buy so deadly a poison without rousing suspicion.  So, as I have said before, he waited. But not long. Will begets way, or, truer  yet, the devil prepares the way for him who is willing to walk in it.</p>
  <p>One  morning he came upon a phial in Mr. Leighton&rsquo;s room whose very appearance  strangely affected him. It was small; it held a dark liquid; and it had a  wicked look strangely attractive to him. He took the phial up; he smelt it.  Bitter almonds! Greatly excited and somewhat shaken, he set it down again. How  had Mr. Leighton come by this? What did he want of it, and why was it left  standing in this open way on his bureau? Was it for medicinal purposes like the  other? Probably; but it seemed stronger, very strong indeed; it seemed strong enough  to kill a man. Catching it up, he carried it away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  any inquiries are made, I&rsquo;ll say I knocked it over and broke it.&rdquo; But Hewson  didn&rsquo;t think any inquiries would be made. Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s sudden death would  make all such little matters forgotten.</p>
  <p>Having  in this unexpected way secured the very poison he most desired, Hewson poured  into the sink all but the few drops he had heard constituted a fatal dose. Then  he put the phial away in a tea-cup and waited his opportunity. It was not long  in coming. That evening he prepared the drink as usual for Mr. Gillespie, and,  while waiting for that gentleman to call for it, saw Mr. George come into the dining-room  and take away the bottle of sherry, and afterwards Mr. Alfred, who hunted about  for his pencil. Later, he heard Mr. Leighton come downstairs, but he did not  wait to see what that gentleman wanted, for his own work in the butler&rsquo;s pantry  was now done, and he thought it better to show himself in the kitchen. But he  was suddenly called up by the dining-room bell. Mr. Leighton wished a glass of sherry  for his father. This was an unexpected order, and for the moment set him quite  aback. For if Mr. Gillespie drank sherry now, he would not want his spiced  drink later. However, he put a good face on the matter and got out the wine,  which he handed to Mr. Leighton, who poured out a glassful and carried it in to  his father. A moment later he heard the front door close. Leighton had gone out  to one of his numerous meetings, and Mr. Gillespie was left alone.</p>
  <p>Somehow  the old servant had an irresistible desire to see how his master looked at this  moment. There had been loud words between that master and Mr. Leighton before  the latter had left, and he wanted to see how his master had borne it&mdash;wanted to  see&mdash;well, he hardly knew what; but he went to the dining-room door and, finding  the opposite one open, peered in.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Gillespie was standing just where his son had doubtless left him, gazing  intently into the wine-glass which he held, untasted, in his hand. His face was  wan and troubled. Suddenly he moved and, glancing behind him, like a man bound  on some guilty errand, but not looking far enough into the distance to see  Hewson watching him from the depths of the dimly lighted room on the other side  of the hall, he hurried to the window, and, raising, first the shade and then  the sash, flung out the contents of the glass into the back-yard. This done, he  uttered a sigh, which spoke of some great inward trouble, and, reclosing the  window, carried back the empty glass to the dining-room, from which Hewson had,  by this time, slipped in guilty confusion.</p>
  <p>Not  understanding Mr. Gillespie&rsquo;s sudden distaste for the wine he had ordered, but  determined to profit by what struck him as a very happy chance, Hewson put his  own concoction on a tray, and, creeping to the buffet, took the phial out of  the tea-cup in which he had concealed it, and emptied its contents into the  glass he carried. Then not liking to put the phial back, he thrust it into his  vest-pocket, mouth up (the cork having slipped from his hand and rolled away in  the darkness). He was willing to be heard now, and was stepping briskly around  the room, when Mr. Gillespie called out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s  that? Is it Hewson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is, sir,&rdquo; was the demure reply. &ldquo;I came up to make you that drink you like so  well; but Mr. Leighton said you preferred sherry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; but I like your drink, too. Brew it and bring it in to me. I seem to be  unusually thirsty to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without  a quiver, without a conscious sense of doing anything greatly out of the  common, this tried old servant brought him the glass which he knew would end  all earthly relations between them. He even waited until he saw it emptied,  then he took it out again and immediately washed it.</p>
  <p>Why  he felt this precaution necessary he hardly knew, unless it was to pass away  the moment of suspense. He never dreamed for a minute that there was anything  special for him to fear. Were not men dropping dead every day in  counting-houses or in the streets? And why not this man? That the police would  be called in or that so quiet a death would be treated as a crime, had never  occurred to him. He had never read murder cases much; indeed, had never read  anything much; he only knew he wanted his master to die, and that the quickest  way to bring this about was to give him a dose of very strong poison. Yet after  he had done this, he felt some nervousness, not over what he had done, but its  seemingly slow results. He had expected Mr. Gillespie to fall at once, perhaps  before he was, himself, well out of the room, and Mr. Gillespie did not fall.  Hewson had had time to wash the glass, put it away, go down into the kitchen  again, and come back, without hearing the heavy thud for which his ears were  strained. Was his affair to fail again? Had the dark and pungent liquor been  harmless, and was it decreed that he was to go back to the old life with no  hopes of a change or relief? He was so worked up by this thought that he crept into  the dining-room again and was making for the hall door to take another peep  into the study, when his foot encountered a small object on the floor. Yielding  to his usual methodical habits, he stooped and picked up what proved to be  Alfred&rsquo;s pencil. This he mechanically dropped into his pocket, then he went on.</p>
  <p>He  found his master reeling over the study floor in the first consciousness,  perhaps, of his alarming condition. He seemed to be trying to find the door,  but as Hewson drew nearer (fascinated, perhaps, by the sight of suffering of  which he himself had been the cause), Mr. Gillespie suddenly paused in this  effort, and, meeting Hewson&rsquo;s eyes, threw up his arms and made for his desk,  upon which he fell in a way which assured his anxious watcher that the last  minutes of his quondam master were at hand.[A]</p>
  <p>[Footnote  A: It was at this moment probably, and not till this moment, that Mr. Gillespie  recognized his real murderer. Of the tumult thus awakened in heart and brain,  who can judge!]</p>
  <p>As  he had no wish to watch his sufferings, he made another journey downstairs and  showed himself in the servants&rsquo; hall just as little Claire broke away from her  nurse and rushed, laughing loudly, up to her grandfather.</p>
  <p>This  convinced him that his own comings and goings had been so natural that they had  not even been noticed by his fellow-servants. He saw that they had been playing  a merry game with the child, and that not one of them had had an eye for him or  his unaccustomed nervousness. This gave him courage, and soon, very soon now,  they all had reason for nervousness. The long-delayed alarm was heard at last;  strangers came into the house; the police followed, and this old reprobate, who  had remained serene amidst all the turmoil, realised that there was more to  fear in the matter than had ever struck his mind. With this fear came not only  a desire to hide his own guilt, but the requisite cunning for doing so. He  realised that he must get rid of the phial before he was searched, and, being  left a minute to himself in the dining-room, he took it out of his side  vest-pocket, and, shaking out the pencil which had slipped into it, he thrust  it under the clock as being the one article not likely to be moved. It was a  heavy lift for his old arms, and his elbows shook as he guided it back into  place. The consequence was that he knocked over the glass which Mr. Gillespie had  set down on the mantel-shelf a few minutes before; but though the clatter which  it made attracted attention and the broken pieces of this glass were carefully  examined, nothing was discovered from them, the glass having held nothing but  sherry. Not so with poor Alfred&rsquo;s pencil, the end of which had rested in the  last drop of poison remaining in the phial. The odour of prussic acid thus  communicated to it came near bringing his favourite young master into jeopardy.  But something, Hewson hardly knew what, intervened to save him, and all was  going on well, or as well as could be expected after the suspicions expressed  by Mr. Gillespie against his sons, when this young demon in the shape of a  detective flung himself at the old butler&rsquo;s throat and, without telling him why  or by what means he had learned it, accused him of being his master&rsquo;s poisoner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was the shock! the shock!&rdquo; the miserable wretch wailed out. &ldquo;Had I had more  time to think, I would have known that he had no proof against me; that it was  all guess-work, and that I would be a fool to fear that. But it is too late  now. I have said it, and I stand by it. Only I wish I could have seen the  thousand dollars for which I killed my master lying for one instant in my hand.  I would willingly go without the cottage, go without the evening pipe in the  sight of hills and meadows, just to realise the sensation of holding all that  money and knowing that it was <i>mine</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter_35"></a>Chapter 35<br>
    Roses</b></h2>
  <p>One  more scene, and this narration of my life&rsquo;s most stirring episode will have  reached its conclusion.</p>
  <p>It  was a memorable scene to me. It took place in the parlours of the little  cottage in New Jersey on the day we laid Mille-fleurs away to rest.</p>
  <p>The  burial had taken place, the guests had departed, and only the members of the  family remained to close up the cottage, now more than ever precious in  Leighton&rsquo;s eyes. George and Alfred, with an assumption of brotherly feeling  they probably thought due the occasion, had stepped out together to see that  everything was ready for Hope&rsquo;s departure, and, from the window where I stood,  I could see&mdash;arrant spy that I was&mdash;the nonchalant air with which either turned a  wary eye upon the other as Hope&rsquo;s voice was heard above, speaking to little  Claire. They evidently still looked upon each other as the possible object of  her preference, no suspicion having reached them of the tragic secret which had  made this young girl&rsquo;s heart inaccessible to them both. I, who knew it, and had  my own place in the tragedy to which they had been blind, did not watch them  long, Leighton being the more interesting figure at that moment, as, standing  on his desolate hearthstone, he allowed his eyes to wander for the last time,  perhaps, over the beauties of the bijou dwelling which, exquisite as it was,  had been as powerless as his love to hold his roving wife in check.</p>
  <p>He  was waiting for Hope, and as this thought, with its suggestion of another and  longer waiting struck my mind, a pang seized me which it took all my  self-possession to hide. Waiting for&mdash;Hope! Hope, who had sat that day with his  child crushed close against her breast, and a look on her face which angels  might view with pity, but which I&mdash;</p>
  <p>Ah!  she was coming! I turned my face away, not that I had anything to dread from  this meeting, but that I felt as if I could not bear at this moment to see the  shadow veiling his melancholy countenance lift, were it ever so lightly, at the  sound of the step that was shaking my own heart. But I immediately glanced  back; uncertainty was worse than knowledge; and, glancing back, saw Hope, and  Hope only.</p>
  <p>She  was standing in the open doorway with her arms full of roses&mdash;roses which she  had brought from New York, and which she now held out towards Leighton, with a  smile I hardly think he saw, so much was his attention fixed upon the flowers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  are these for?&rdquo; he asked, advancing towards her and touching the great roses  with a trembling hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are for her,&rdquo; said Hope, in a low tone; &ldquo;for my cousin Millicent. I could not  bear to have her lie with only her husband&rsquo;s tokens on her breast, as if she  had no&mdash;no&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He  caught her to his heart. Moved to the very soul, he kissed her on the lips;  then he took the flowers.</p>
  <p>As  he passed out, she tottered pale and almost swooning to where I stood trembling  with my own emotions. Lifting her face, with its candid eyes and quivering  lips, she faltered between her sobs:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  patience with me! I see now that he has never loved me and never will. Had so  much as the possibility been in his breast, he could not have kissed me like  that to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was not on George&rsquo;s arm, or Alfred&rsquo;s, or even Leighton&rsquo;s that she passed out of  that little house into the new life she was to share some day with me.</p>
  <p>* *  * * *</p>
  <p>A  long time after those flowers had withered on Mille-fleurs&rsquo; peaceful breast,  Leighton said to me, with his hand on the head of his child:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall never marry again, Outhwaite. To train this child up to be my pride as  she is now my joy, will fill my life as full of happiness as is necessary to me  now. And, Outhwaite, she is a quiet child,&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped&mdash;I knew what thought had  stayed him,&mdash;&rdquo;a quiet and a loving child. Yesterday she sat for a full hour with  her arms about my neck and her cheek pressed to mine, listening while I talked  to her of things a child usually cares but little about. This is balm for many  a hurt, Outhwaite, and if it is given to her mother to look down upon us two&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  smile, the rarest I had ever seen, finished the sentence. Seeing it, and noting  how it irradiated features which once bore the stamp of deepest melancholy, I  could never again look upon Leighton Gillespie as an unhappy man.</p>
