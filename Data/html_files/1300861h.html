<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> following account of Australian economic
development attempts, to keep in the forefront the private
activities by which British settlers in Australia have
transformed a prison-yard and hunting-ground of savages into a
productive annexe to Europe and Asia, proud of using its
labour-saving methods as means to general well-being. Little,
therefore, is said of public finance. Studies of government
expenditure on development are being made, notably in the work of
the Hon. F. W. Eggleston, but it is fitting that they should be
preceded by an outline of the private activity which they have
been ostensibly designed to foster.</p>
<p>The scene of the new beginning here studied was a distant and
at first despised part of the dowry of that fairest mistress
"Trade", for whom Britain, Holland and France long fought. It was
peopled first by outcasts, rebels and adventurers, stiffly
governed for two generations by British officials, and to this
day is largely financed by the British middle class. For a full
century the little communities were outworks of the industrial
revolution in Britain. In clearing the crowded gaols, in
producing raw materials and food for the city-dwellers of the old
land, they played a role of increasing importance in the grand
speculation of industrialism&mdash;that experiment on which the
British people have staked their capital, their mighty energy,
their very life-blood. Australia emerged from the degradation of
convictism by taking the place for which Spain had proved
inadequate in the divided tasks of growing and manufacturing
wool, both formerly discharged by Britain herself.</p>
<p>To-day the democracy that rules Australia is disposed to treat
history as a record, as well forgotten, of the crimes, follies
and misfortunes of others. And Britain's industrial
responsibilities as centre of the world economy have again been
divided amongst pupils and partners. Three times in the last
fifty years, however, Australians of the rank and file have had
the chance to verify what "the papers" told them of the changing
world. On active service along Australia's lines of communication
with Britain, they have felt the heave of big events. When W. B.
Dalley sent the New South Wales contingent to Suakim, colonials
on active service were scarcely taken seriously: John Bull could
thrash the dervishes easily enough. But fighting the Boers on the
veldt was another business; and Australians came home from it to
their federated Commonwealth aware that strong nations were
coveting the resources of lands under the British flag. The
sense of a permanent and secure world was shaken.</p>
<p>During the campaigns of 1915 to 1918, in numbers as great as
the Commonwealth could muster and partly equip&mdash;numbers
whose going heavily checked the work of farms, wharves and
mines&mdash;Australians helped other Britons and their Allies to
meet the armed challenge. With thinned ranks they came back,
aware that the danger had been repulsed at heavy cost. An era had
ended. To them too, as to Mr J. M. Keynes, "the most interesting
question in the world (of those, at least, to which time will
bring us an answer)" was "whether, after a short interval of
recovery, material progress would be resumed, or whether, on the
other hand, the magnificent episode of the nineteenth century
was over."</p>
<p>At first it seemed that a prosperity greater than that of
pre-war times had come. Home and external markets moved from
strength to strength, with little faltering even in 1920-21 when
Britain plunged into the long depression that grips her still. In
this access of wealth, Australians one and all talked of making
their country more self-reliant. Clever men stampeded the
democracy into measures seemingly designed to make our economy a
hermit one. The coalition of parties in political power during
the post-war decade piled tariff upon tariff in favour of local
secondary industries, and sponsored crude plans to exploit the
Australian market in favour of struggling export industries.
Their talk ran high of making Australia another United States,
drawing increased wealth from the interchange of products within
the national boundaries. The realists in opposition applauded
each tariff and marketing scheme, but, mistrusting American
methods with labour, made haste, by control of
state-administrations and by pleas before wage-fixing tribunals,
to distribute income more favourably for their supporters.</p>
<p>Australia certainly has need of greater self-reliance, but she
is not and cannot be another United States of America, In place
of the Mississippi Valley and Middle West she has Lake Eyre and
an arid, almost uninhabited, central region. On her fertile but
limited coastal fringes live six or seven million
people&mdash;about as many as inhabit Thibet. Their resources are
too scanty to be the basis, as those of the United States are, of
a Continental civilization, rivalling in economic power, by
virtue of internal freedom of enterprise, all the rest of the
world. The more the policy of a hermit Australia succeeded, the
more surely would it bring slothful intellectual standards, and,
as a consequence, material decay, until, with scorn, some sea
power from the world where necessity had maintained knowledge and
energy knocked in the closed door.</p>
<p>If she will but rouse her vigorous people to face facts,
Australia's geographic position and relative immaturity offer her
a role in the world economy of greater importance than that which
she has already effectively filled. Incidentally her White
Australia policy would then become internationally helpful.
Seeking high efficiency and low costs by reverting to the tariff
policy of the young Commonwealth (1902-1908), she can, for many
generations to come, stimulate the production of a greater
surplus of raw materials and foodstuffs. India, China and Japan
are well started on the road to industrialism. In a review of
"The Food Supply and Resources of China", read during a recent
Pacific Science Congress in Java, a Chinese economist, Shih Tsin
Tung, concluded that industrialization and rising standards of
living in China would force an increasing percentage of her 492
millions to rely on imported cereals. Rice-growing countries
could not supply them. His countrymen, already consumers of 235
million "tan", or about 920 million bushels, of wheat, would
therefore find it imperative to change their food habits. "The
world's uncultivated areas are mainly wheat-producing land."
Geographically, with her wheat lands near the coast, Australia is
better situated to supply an industrialized Asia with foodstuffs
than are the inland prairies of America or the steppes of Russia.
Her industrial resources, well placed on the Eastern coast, would
be developed in due course as the internal economies of an
exchange kept technically alert by international competition.</p>
<p>Progress on these lines is the logical result of the broader
market for Australia's staple exports. She is now the leading
wool-grower for Continental Europe, Japan and America, as well as
for Britain. She is already finding lucrative and growing markets
for her wheat in Mediterranean, Indian and Asiatic ports.</p>
<p>Self-sufficiency in finance would be the reward of
self-respect. Without restraint upon external borrowing, no
economy can continue sound. But there is no inconsistency between
continued activity in international trade and financial
self-reliance. Britain's example demonstrates that. Nor is there
reason to doubt that all-round progress in the arts would come
unforced from a policy of fruitful trade and international good
feeling, and would make Australia greater in the councils of the
nations and a stronger member of the British Commonwealth than
she is to-day.</p>
<p>This book would not have been written but for the
encouragement given to the author by Professor Ernest Scott, as
Australian Adviser for the seventh volume of the <i>Cambridge
History of the British Empire</i>. The author's thanks are also
due to the Syndics of the Cambridge University Press for their
permission to incorporate in this work the substance of his
contributions to that volume.</p>
<p>The footnotes to the text make abundantly clear his
obligations to others, and above all to Sir Timothy Coghlan, the
first to labour in these fields. In the footnotes the writer has
tried also to draw attention to the great need for further and
more-detailed studies. An attempt such as this at a wide
synthesis is inevitably marked and marred by mistakes of emphasis
and lack of knowledge. The author will be very grateful for help
in correcting these, both from the new Australian schools of
economics and from all students of this neglected subject. He
already owes a deep personal obligation to the officials of the
Mitchell Library, Sydney, and of the Melbourne and Perth Public
Libraries, for their unfailing zeal in assisting him in his
research among the books and papers in their custody. Professor
W. K. Hancock of Adelaide University and Mr G. V. Portus,
Director of Tutorial Classes in Sydney, helped him greatly with
the earlier chapters, but must be held blameless for the
substance and point of view. The conclusion emerges from the
later chapters that since the war Australia has allowed her
"national policies" to eat up the easy gains of a period of
unusual plenty and to exceed the effort towards self-sufficiency
which she can afford without over-capitalization. The writer
hopes, however, that these pages may help to guide some of those
engaged in the task of reconstruction.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br>
<br>
Governor Phillip and the Establishment</h3>
<p><small>THE</small> first British settlement in New Holland was
planted on 26 January 1788 beside a little rivulet, known later
as the Tank Stream, on Sydney Cove, Port Jackson. It was not
scenic beauty that attracted the sailors, but the prime
necessities of a seafaring people&mdash;sheltered anchorage and
fresh water. Ages earlier, larger streams had carved out the deep
valleys drowned under Port Jackson. The headwaters of those
streams had been captured in some great earth change by the
Nepean-Hawkesbury river-system. Thus the harbour formed by their
submergence had escaped silt. Deep water slept in all its hundred
bays and arms.</p>
<p>But the plain behind lacked a fit scene for immediate
agriculture, the hard labour to which the convicts brought by the
First Fleet had been condemned; and it was walled off from the
rest of the Continent by the Blue Mountain cliffs. Till the
mountains were crossed it was a port without a hinterland.* The
great sandstone gorges thirty miles westward of the harbour beat
back inland exploration for a quarter of a century. Possibly the
officials of a colony that was primarily a prison cared no more
than the aborigines to know what lay beyond the ranges. Like the
aborigines, who obtained a sparse living from fish, game and
roots, they clung to the harbour shores.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See T. G. Taylor's article on "Economic
Geography" in the <i>Australian Encyclopaedia</i>, vol.
<small>I</small> (third edition), pp. 504 <i>et seq</i>. and the
larger works it epitomizes, e.g. <i>Australia, Physiographic and
Economic</i>.]</p>
<p>The only denizens of the virgin land were primitive hunting
tribes who, by restriction of their numbers and by elaborate
taboos, had adjusted their hunting to the supply of game. No
competition with other races or cultures had narrowed their
fields and enforced pasture or agriculture, the domestication of
animals and plants in chosen spots. The intruders found a
forest-clad country&mdash;unkempt, uncanny and unknown.</p>
<p>Prisoners, emancipists and officer-settlers tilled a few areas
of alluvial soil which they found chiefly along the Hawkesbury
valley. The best of these, however, were liable to sudden
devastation by the flood-waters which the Nepean-Hawkesbury
system hurled seaward along one narrow valley. As their harvests
were swept away almost as often as not, the exiles found their
main support in the stores and clothing brought from overseas and
served out by the naval captains still in command. Unlucky delays
in re-victualling the little white population made equal rations
an established rule of early Sydney.</p>
<p>This was unfortunate. It confirmed in economic childishness
that first company of marines and convicts. Neither criminals nor
warders make a positive contribution to the social economy of
production and exchange. In early Sydney this special department
of British life was separated, isolated and given the appearance
of a new community. But it proved difficult to introduce into it
the main activities of a self-providing society. The First Fleet
had been sent primarily to rid Britain of a troublesome
accumulation of criminals. That good riddance was the dominant
motive is plain enough. Several of the early batches of prisoners
were sent without any record of individuals' terms of
imprisonment. If any thought was given to their employment at the
Antipodes, it was of the vaguest character. Perhaps the reports
about Botany Bay made by Captain Cook and Sir Joseph Banks led
the officials to expect an immediate and abundant return from
cultivation of the soil.</p>
<p>Governor Phillip's instructions bade him treat "the
productions of all descriptions acquired by the labour of the
convicts as a public stock".* Part of this he might use for the
subsistence of the convicts and of his civil and military
establishment "The remainder of such productions you will reserve
as a provision for a further number of convicts who will shortly
follow you." But Cook's fertile meadows at Botany Bay proved to
be sodden rush flats, and around Port Jackson Phillip found
neither the land nor the men needed for instant and energetic
tillage.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Historical Records of Australia</i>, series
<small>I</small>, vol. <small>I</small>, pp. 11-12, Governor
Phillip's Instructions.]</p>
<p>As far as eye could reach the country appeared "one continued
wood". Trees "so large that the removing them off the ground
after they are cut is the greater part of the labour" cumbered
the whole country. Difficulties with his human material proved
greater still. The convicts, numbering 717 at the landing, 529
being males, were the sweepings of the prison hulks. Artificers
and useful hands had been retained in Britain. "The sending of
the disordered and helpless", wrote Phillip, "clears the gaols
and may ease the parishes from which they are sent, but if the
practice is continued, this settlement will remain for years a
burthen to the mother country." ** His sinister charges were
woefully unlike "farmers and emigrants who have been used to
labour and who reap the fruits of their own industry. . . .
Amongst the convicts we have . . . many who are helpless and a
deadweight on the settlement. . . . Those who have not been
brought up to hard work, which are by far the greatest part, bear
it badly. They shrink from it the moment the eye of the overseer
is turned from them".</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>H. R. of A</i>. series <small>I</small>,
vol. <small>I</small>, p. 197, Phillip to Grenville, 17 July
1790.]</p>
<p>The eye of the overseer was universally needed. The convicts
were not led by the ordinary motives to honest
industry&mdash;they had therefore to be driven. Phillip had
counted on the loyal aid of the officers of the Royal Marines who
had come as guard over the convicts. To his chagrin the officers,
led by the lieutenant-governor Major Robert Ross, "declined any
interference with the convicts, except when they are employed for
their own particular service". The marines, they argued, had been
sent as a garrison; their duty as guard over the convicts ceased
at the landing. It was the first Australian strike, and one on
the part of the directing class. They even objected to forming a
court of criminal jurisdiction, an essential service in such a
community. "Here", Phillip reported, "are only convicts to attend
to convicts and who in general fear to exert any authority."
Productive labour around Sydney broke down at once. In six months
only eight or ten acres could be sown with wheat and barley. Even
on these tiny patches the harvest failed: the seed had been
over-heated on the voyage out. The sharing of the ship's stores
continued, providing an effortless subsistence all too easily
accepted by thieves and warders. The cult of energetic production
had to make headway against this institution of paternalism.</p>
<p>In 1789 Phillip transferred the essay in public agriculture to
Rose Hill or Parramatta, where, at the head of one branch of the
harbour, he had found an open fertile area. But the change of
soil did not mend matters. Under the only reliable supervisor,
Henry Edward Dodd, a free man who had come as Phillip's personal
servant, a hundred convicts raised 200 bushels of wheat, 60 of
barley and small quantities of oats, flax and Indian corn. All of
this was preserved for seed, and as Dodd would not contemplate
remaining as a settler, the problems of food-supply and of
supervising convict labour were not solved. In every despatch
Phillip wrote of his need of continued supplies and of competent
superintendents. "Men have been found"&mdash;this was in July
1790&mdash;"who answer the purpose of preventing their straggling
from their work, but none of them are equal to the charge of
directing the labour of a number of convicts with whom most of
them are linked by crimes they would not wish to have brought
forward." A time-expired convict, James Ruse, had been given in
1789 an acre of ground and a hut at Rose Hill "in order to know
in what time a man might be able to cultivate a sufficient
quantity of ground to support himself". His thorough tillage
convinced Phillip that the colony would support itself on its own
produce as soon as free settlers with convict servants worked for
their own hand on their own land.</p>
<p>The attempt to grow food supplies by public agriculture
brought the colony to the very brink of collapse by starvation.
Phillip's careful plans for the expedition had made the voyage
out a remarkably healthy one, but his foresight as a ship's
captain could hardly be expected to extend to the needs and
functions of a farming community at the Antipodes. No ploughs had
been brought. Ground cleared by cutting down the big trees and
"grubbing out" the smaller ones was hand-tilled between the
stumps, with spade and hoe, a method the honesty of which could
be ensured only by watching every stroke. Ruse said of his farm,
"I dug in the ashes, and then hoed it, never doing more than
eight or perhaps nine rods in a day, by which means it was not
like the government farm, just scratched over, but properly
done". Phillip's workmen were all too likely to quarrel with
their tools, and those sent with the transports seem to have been
of the poorest sort. "Bad tools", wrote Phillip in November 1791,
"are of no kind of use. Two or three hundred iron frying pans
will be a saving of spades. For cross-cut saws, axes, iron-pots
and combs we are much distressed."</p>
<p>As herdsmen the convicts were of even less use. Phillip's
instructions warned him to take the utmost care of the livestock,
for breeding purposes. "The settlement will be amply supplied
with vegetable productions and most likely with fish." But the
convict herdsmen allowed the cattle to wander off into the bush
and get lost. The forty-four sheep brought by the First Fleet
also disappeared one by one, the losses being ascribed to dingoes
and native spears.</p>
<p>With crops insufficient for seed at the next planting, with
livestock disappearing into the bush, Governor Phillip, though he
did not doubt "but that this country will prove the most valuable
acquisition Great Britain ever made", had good cause to reflect
that "no country offers less assistance to the first settlers,
nor could be more disadvantageously placed with respect to
support from the mother country, on which for a few years we must
entirely depend".*</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>H.R. of A</i>. series <small>I</small>,
vol. <small>I</small>, p. 51. The poor equipment may have been in
part deliberate. W. Eden in a <i>History of New Holland</i>,
1787, wrote of the convict as "a forlorn hope", "a fair subject
of hazardous experiments". "Offended justice in consigning him to
the inhospitable shore of New Holland does not mean thereby to
seat him for his life on a bed of roses."]</p>
<p>Phillip's early warnings prompted British officials to send
him relief, but unluckily their first attempt to do so
miscarried. The 'Guardian', a new fast-sailing 44-gun ship,
sailed in June 1789 with two years' provisions for the
settlement, clothing, sails and cordage, medicines, blankets,
tools and agricultural implements. Having added plants and stock
to her priceless cargo at the Cape, she should have arrived about
the end of January or early in February 1790. "At that period the
large quantity of livestock in the colony",** as it seemed to the
Judge Advocate, "was daily increasing; the people required for
labour were, comparatively with their present state,*** strong
and healthy, . . . the ration of provisions would have been
increased to the full allowance; and the tillage of the ground
consequently proceeded with in that spirit which must be exerted
to the utmost before the settlement could render itself
independent of the mother country for subsistence." Alas! On 23
December, after leaving Cape Town, the Guardian' collided with an
iceberg. With great difficulty the gallant Riou worked her back
to that port.</p>
<p class="foot">[** D. Collins' <i>Account of the English, Colony
in New South Wales</i>, p. 84.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** These reflections seem to have been written
in June 1790.]</p>
<p>At Sydney her non-arrival and the rapidly approaching
exhaustion of the 1787 salt pork and flour prompted Phillip to
put his people on half rations.* He had somewhat earlier sent off
the 'Sirius' to Cape Town for flour. Field labour had to be
suspended through sheer weakness. The surviving sheep and cattle
were eaten. It became a struggle to survive, hardly different,
save in the hope of succour from overseas, from that of the
aborigines around them.** Little flour was to be had at Cape
Town. The 'Sirius' was sent on a second voyage to China, but
<i>en route</i> she was wrecked off Norfolk Island whither she
had taken a detachment of 300 convicts and 70 marines. The
smaller store-ship 'Supply' was then despatched to Batavia. Some
convicts sent into the bush to shoot kangaroos reported, after
three weeks, that they had shot only three. In each fishing boat
armed guards were set to prevent the complete plundering of the
catch.</p>

<p>At last, on 3 June 1790, two months after the 'Supply's'
departure, the long delay was explained by the arrival of a
transport, the 'Lady Juliana'. She brought an "unnecessary and
unprofitable cargo" of 222 female convicts mostly "loaded with
the infirmities incident to old age" and "never likely to be
other than a burthen to the settlement". But, as full
counterpoise, came word of the 'Guardian's' stores salvaged at
Cape Town and of other store-ships well on the way. A fortnight
later, 20 June, the welcome signal of a ship in sight flew again
at South Head, and in came the 'Justinian' heavily laden with
stores. At the very end of the voyage each of these ships had
passed through a critical moment. "The 'Lady Juliana', in
standing into the harbour with a strong southerly wind, got so
close to the North Head that nothing saved that ship but the set
of the tide." *** The 'Justinian', on 2 June, in the same heavy
rain and wind, "unexpectedly saw the land under her lee and was
obliged to anchor on the coast, very fortunately so near the
rocks that the return of the sea prevented her riding any great
strain on her cable. Had those two ships been lost", wrote the
stoical Governor, "the colony must have suffered very severely
indeed". The relief was of brief duration. Hard on the heels of
the 'Justinian' came the Second Fleet of convict
transports&mdash;the 'Surprize', 'Scarborough' and
'Neptune'&mdash;and out of them landed a ghastly company of sick
and dying. "Great numbers were slung over the ship's side in the
same manner, as they would sling a cask. Some died upon deck, and
others in the boat before they reached the shore. There were
landed not less than 486 sick." * The voyage, especially aboard
the 'Neptune', had been badly found and abominably managed. By
scurvy and "low fever" there died on board that ship 158 out of
her 502 convicts. On the 'Surprize' 36 died out of 256, and on
the 'Scarborough' 73 out of 259. Fifty more died within a month
of landing. "It would be a want of duty", reported Phillip, "not
to say that it was occasioned by the contractors having crowded
too many on board those ships, and from their being too much
confined during the passage." On 17 July 1790, three weeks later,
he wrote of 450 sick "and many not reckoned as sick have barely
strength to attend to themselves. When the last ships arrived we
had not sixty sick in the colony".**</p>

<p class="foot">[** The Rev. Johnson adds some reflections on the
"astonishing villany of these wretched people. . . . When any of
them were near dying and had something given them as bread or
'lillipie' (flour and water boiled together), or any other
necessaries, the person next to him or others would catch the
bread out of his hand, and with an oath say that he was going to
die and that therefore it would be of no service to him. No
sooner would the breath be out of any of their bodies than others
would watch them and strip them entirely naked. Instead of
alleviating the distresses of each other, the weakest were sure
to go to the wall. In the night, which at this time is very cold,
and especially this would be felt in the tents, where they had
nothing but grass to lay on (<i>sic</i>) and a blanket amongst
four of them, he that was the strongest of the four would take
the whole blanket to himself and leave the rest quite naked".
<i>Loc. cit</i>. p. 36.]</p>
<p>Finally, to dash all plans of making the colony
self-supporting by agriculture, came drought of a duration and
intensity unknown in English experience. The seed sown in 1790
was barely recovered at harvest. In November 1791 Phillip had to
feed and clothe 2570 male and 608 female convicts and 161
children. What wonder that his main thought was for a reserve
stock of provisions to meet any future emergency due to a wrecked
store-ship? "When the stores may permit the issuing of the
established ration, the weekly expence according to our present
numbers will be: Of flour 30,560 lb., of beef and pork 21,010 lb.,
of peas 179 bushels, of butter 1,432 lb., and our numbers will be
increasing."</p>
<p>Was ever a member of the versatile race of ships' captains
called upon to bear such a responsibility as his? In husbanding
these stores he pitted his almost solitary will against thefts by
convicts and marines alike. The former "were ever on the watch to
commit depredations on the unwary, during the hours when they
were at large, and never suffered an opportunity to escape
them".*** "Of the provisions issued on the Saturday the major
part of the convicts had none left on the Tuesday night." **** By
issuing them on Wednesday and Saturday, and later daily, "the
days which would otherwise pass in hunger, or in thieving from
the few who were more provident", were "divided" and finally
eliminated. Then the broken wards of a key found in the
store-house padlock led to the detection of a conspiracy among
the guard there. Seven of them had systematically looted it of
liquor and provisions. The one on "sentry go" would admit two or
more of the gang who could procure what they wanted even though
the patrols visited the store while they were there. For the door
was kept locked and the sentinel stood alert and vigilant at his
post. But one night, after eight months of immunity, the key
broke. All the culprits were executed, yet some of them had been
held in high esteem by their officers. Such were Phillip's
underlings. Against the depredations of rats he strove
incessantly, but they defeated every attempt to clear the stores.
The warping of timber, cut green and of necessity used before it
was seasoned, made every building insecure.</p>

<p class="foot">[**** D. Collins, <i>op. cit</i>. p. 65 and p.

<p>Each of the benevolent despots, from Phillip to Macquarie,
groaned under the load of responsibilities which the prison
communism heaped upon his shoulders, but none with more reason
than the first.* His command was a mere dump for human rubbish.
Such was the misery of existence there that, out of sheer pity
for the proposed victims, Phillip refused to correct the
disproportion of the sexes by sending ships to take women from
the Pacific Islands, as bidden by his instructions. Efforts to
escape made by convicts were so determined that two men and a
woman reached Timor in an open boat. Several parties set out to
walk through the bush to China. Bass, when exploring, came upon a
starving band of Irish escapees. He shared his dwindling rations
with them and they parted, not without tears. But from the face
of death they would not go back with him to Sydney.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Cf. Philip Gidley King to Under-Secretary J.
King, 3 May 1800, <i>H.R. of A</i>. series <small>I</small>, vol.
<small>II</small>, p. 505.]</p>
<p>Yet Governor Phillip, as even Macquarie was later to
recognize, "with slender resources accomplished much". Not only
did he house his charges and establish the beginnings of
government with civil and criminal courts. His ration system,
based on a central commissariat-store, was the economic last
ditch, communism,** but it sufficed to hold off wholesale death
by famine. Before the 'Justinian' brought relief the ration
consisted of 2½ lb. of flour, 2 lb. of rice and 2 lb. of
salt pork per week, without trimmings.*** The Governor refused to
draw more for his own table, "wishing that if a convict
complained, he might see that want was not unfelt, even at
Government House".**** By 1792, however, he had spent his
strength, and in December, broken in health, he set out for
England.</p>

<p class="foot">[**** D. Collins, <i>op. cit</i>. p. 80.]</p>
<p>It was not a simple problem to convert this forlorn crew of
exiles into a free community providing for itself. As instructed,
Phillip made land grants to time-expired convicts, free even of
quit-rent for the first ten years. Thirty acres were offered to
each single man, 50 to the married men and to additional acres
for each child. Fresh regulations, dated August 1789, allowed him
to grant discharged soldiers 80 acres each, and free settlers 130
acres. But he soon found that to give a man land did not ensure
his productive use of it "Many inconveniences" attended the
business. "With some the sole object in becoming settlers is that
of being their own masters, and with others the object is to
raise as much money as will pay their passage to England." At his
instance, later governors were directed to make all grants
non-transferable for five years.***** Another "inconvenience" of
small farming near Sydney was revealed in his request (17 July
1790) for permission to establish settlers in detached areas
"where the stock will be less liable to suffer from the
depredations which may be expected from the soldier and the
convict and against which there is no security".</p>

1793. Governor King improved on this by making grants to infant
children which could not be transferred until they came of
age.]</p>
<p>Governor Phillip granted only 3389 acres in all. Neither legal
restrictions nor isolation made the "settlers from convicts"
better able to read the riddle of agriculture in a climate
fruitful at times but fatally capricious. General Orders did not
govern the weather nor direct the colonists' labours with
foresight and imagination. These qualities came to the colony,
however, in the person of an "ensign in the New South Wales
Corps".</p>
<p>Among those who bore the torments of the Second Fleet's voyage
were detachments of this force, which had been raised for the
special purpose of relieving Major Ross and his Royal Marines
from the task of superintendence to which they had objected. The
New South Wales Corps were not a picked force, save perhaps in an
evil sense. Governor Hunter described them as "soldiers from the
Savoy (the military prison) and other characters who have been
considered disgraceful in every other regiment in His Majesty's
service".* In the Colony they stultified the efforts of every
naval governor and kept the whole community in turmoil as long as
they remained there.</p>

<p>The prime mover in these doings was invariably John McArthur.
Though born in Devon, he was the son of a Jacobite of the '45.
His father's brothers, it was said, had all been slain at
Culloden, and the sole survivor had fled for a time to the West
Indies. At John's birth, his father was an army agent at
Plymouth, and in his service, no doubt, John learned about trade.
Entering the army in 1782, he retired on half-pay at the peace of
1783, practised farming and read for the law. Then marriage and
"every reasonable expectation of reaping the most material
advantages" ** led him to join the New South Wales Corps.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Early Records of Macarthurs of Camden</i>,
p. 2, Mrs John Macarthur to her mother, Mrs Veale.]</p>
<p>Even before Governor Philip's departure, McArthur was eager to
play the "spirited proprietor" and to develop, as was then the
vogue in Britain, a capitalistic agriculture. He proposed to
Phillip that he should retire from the Corps on half-pay and on
the condition that he should be granted land and the labour of
convicts to till it. Phillip had in 1790 recommended the
assignment of convicts to free settlers, but now he hesitated. "I
am very far from wishing to throw the smallest obstacles in the
way of officers obtaining grants of land" he told Dundas in
October 1792,*** "but in the present state of this colony the
numbers employed on the public buildings, in procuring the
materials and in other occupations equally necessary, does not
leave more than four hundred and fifty for agriculture. From that
number those convicts must be taken who are to be given to
officers or settlers, which will increase the number of those who
do not labour for the public, and lessen those who are to furnish
the colony with the necessaries of life." The assumption that
private settlers could contribute nothing to the Colony's
supplies was born in Phillip's mind, perhaps, out of the feeble
efforts of the expirees. But the alternative of relying on
prisoners' tillage of Crown land continued to prove a delusive
one. Dundas, in despatches dated to January and 14 July 1792,****
gave Phillip a free hand to grant land, assign convicts and issue
provisions to officers and others who became settlers "provided
the allotments are made not with a view to a temporary but an
established settlement thereon".</p>

<p>These instructions, and the relaxation of control which occurs
in every despotism at a change of rulers, opened the way in
December 1792 to a new economic policy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br>
<br>
The New South Wales Corps</h3>
<br>
<p><small>IN</small> the eighteenth century the power of the
British ruling class was as yet untempered by constant
responsibility to the opinion of the nation. In the army and
navy, prize-money and the spoils of war had whetted the appetites
of an island people never slow to seize their chances of
enrichment by plunder or trade.</p>
<p>But a communistic system, such as they had to administer in
early Sydney, demands, at least of its responsible chiefs,
self-sacrifice and devotion to the common welfare. Its success
depends upon the discovery of a successor to the patriarchs of
old. He must apportion the pooled resources of the community in
such fashion that each member of it may be moved, not by
calculation, but by the primitive impulses of loyalty or fear, to
do what in the sum of their efforts will suffice for the needs of
all. Aboard ship, especially when tiny sailing ships ventured
over wide oceans, a sense of common danger from tempest or lee
shore might maintain this solidarity. Ashore, in a far land with
a seemingly genial climate, the discipline of a little commune
made up of the worst possible human materials went all to pieces.
Such men as Grose and Paterson, and even Hunter and King, though
they applied with a zeal that grew more ferocious with failure
"the peculiar caste rules of the services", proved as unequal as
Bligh at Tahiti to the changed demands on the sea-captain turned
patriarch.</p>
<p>They and their fellow-officers were "for the most part simple,
commonplace men, physically courageous and intellectually vapid,
men guided by a strange jumble of uncomprehended
motives&mdash;blind loyalty to the King, their regiment or
ship&mdash;blind acceptance of the Church of
England&mdash;mingled with love of liquor, greed of gain and
indifference to the usual tenets of morality. Few were men of
striking ability or forceful character, for the colonial
garrisons, a backwater of the Services and the retired list, had
little to show in those times of war in the way of brains or
energy".* Probably not one of those called to fill Governor
Phillip's place saw that the conversion of a prison camp into a
free community was a sociological riddle of some complexity. Each
was beset by his social equals for relaxations and concessions.
Each was tormented by Whitehall's intermittent tugging on the
financial reins. Each reached the breaking strain and returned
home broken by failure. Yet for the most part their superiors
remained as blind as they to the changed and changing realities
in New South Wales.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Dr Marion Phillips, <i>A Colonial
Autocracy</i>, p. 10.]</p>
<p>To Phillip's civil officials, Surgeon Arndell and the Reverend
R. Johnson, the changes which Lieutenant-Governor Grose made as
soon as "the Governor's" back was turned seemed a deliberate
plunge into anarchy. The civil court ceased to sit. Public
agriculture was dropped. Phillip's admirable plans for the town
of Sydney were ignored. The officers were granted land wherever
they chose&mdash;land which soon included the former scenes of
public agriculture. Public order collapsed and a general
licentiousness raged unrebuked.</p>
<p>Grose and McArthur, on the other hand, reported a new energy
and prosperity. In February 1793 the former, as
Lieutenant-Governor, wrote of "the great spirit" with which the
officers to whom he had granted land were clearing it "at their
own expense. Whether their efforts result from the novelty of the
business or the advantages they promise themselves I cannot say,
but their exertions are really astonishing . . . I shall be
prepared and thankful to receive as many convicts as can
conveniently be sent." He thought the "settlers from convicts" an
improvident crew, but he encouraged them to bring maize to the
commissariat store by offering for it a fixed price of five
shillings a bushel, "it being at the same time a cheap purchase
for government and an accommodating market for the settler".*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Grose to Dundas, 3 September 1793, <i>H.R. of
A</i>. series <small>I</small>, vol. <small>X</small>, p.
448.]</p>
<p>McArthur thought the changes since the departure of Governor
Phillip "so great and extraordinary that to recite them all might
create some suspicion of their truth". They had in a short time
lifted the settlement from "a state of desponding poverty and
threatened famine . . . As for myself I have a farm containing
250 acres, of which upwards of a hundred are under cultivation. I
have at this moment 20 acres of fine wheat growing, and 80 acres
prepared for Indian corn and potatoes. My stock consists of a
horse, two mares, two cows, 130 goats, upwards of a hundred hogs.
Poultry of all kinds I have in the greatest abundance. I have
received no stock from government but one cow". That to the
father of Australian pasture this petty goat and poultry run
should seem almost incredible progress makes the "desponding
poverty", against which it looked well, dark indeed.</p>
<p>The surgeon and the parson in Sydney reported to Governor
Hunter other aspects of the military rule. "Crimes of every sort
increased to an alarming degree; thefts and robberies became so
numerous that they were spoken of as mere matters of course." **
"Assaults the most outrageous were frequently committed. . . . As
no pains were taken to inspire a reverence for religion, the
Sabbath, instead of being passed by the people in attendance at
divine service, was profaned as a day particularly appropriated
to gaming, intoxication, and uncontrolled indulgence of every
vicious excess." A drunken convict whom he met on the Parramatta
Road offered to break the good Surgeon Arndell's head with a
bottle of rum which he had refused to share. When the clergyman
failed to finish service in the short half-hour allotted him by
military orders, the drum beat and, to his chagrin, out marched
both guard and congregation.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Arndell to Hunter, <i>H.R. of A</i>. series
<small>I</small>, vol. <small>II</small>, p. 183. Cf. Rev. R.
Johnson to Hunter, p. 178.]</p>
<p>Agricultural activity and contempt for order, morals and
religion flowed, it would seem, from the same tap, that is, from
the rum used as a makeshift currency&mdash;a strange instrument
of progress but one congenial to that strange company. Among the
"articles to be sent to New South Wales in consequence of
Governor Phillip's representations" the store-ship 'Britannia'
had carried in January 1792 "9,278 gallons of rum, being the
allowance of half a gallon per annum". Phillip was especially
pleased at the inclusion of the convicts "for it is a bounty
which many of those people well deserve and to the undeserving it
will never be given". He reckoned without his host. Not much
longer was his will alone to decide to whom it should be
given.</p>
<p>By the same ship came word that recruits for the New South
Wales Corps in England had been promised, as a condition of
enlisting, "the usual ration except spirits, without deduction
from their pay". Dundas thought the same offer made in New South
Wales would be "a strong inducement to some of the marines to
enlist in the additional company".*** He overlooked the fact that
in the communism of semi-starvation guard and convict alike had
been given, and had come to regard as their right, a share of
whatever was to be had and that the consignment of rum was
intended for both. Phillip saw that the soldiers would think
little of free rations.**** Everyone drew them. But the
deprivation of spirits would put them on a lower plane than the
convicts. While he hesitated, and despite his forebodings, Major
Grose and his brother-officers chartered the same store-ship, the
'Britannia', to bring a cargo from the Cape which might "relieve
the soldiers' necessities" and afford them "Comforts other than
the reduced and unwholesome rations served out from the stores".
Within a few days of Phillip's departure, moreover, an American
ship, curiously named the 'Hope', arrived at Sydney, offering
spirits and provisions, which the new Lieutenant-Governor bought,
seemingly in fear of drought. He told Dundas that he had the less
reluctantly bought spirits as well as provisions, "as it appeared
from your letter of the 15th May ***** that it was intended to
issue spirits to the non-commissioned officers and private
soldiers". Dundas had foreseen that the coming of whalers would
necessitate supervision over their usual rum-trading. In a later
despatch, oddly dated the 31 June 1793, he warned Grose against
allowing spirits to be secretly sold to convicts, and bade him
subject the trade to "the view and inspection of proper persons
directed by you to attend the same". But private exchange,
however well watched, relaxes the commissary's grip upon a
communistic economy. The 7597 gallons of rum obtained from the
'Hope' had long since been sold mainly to the only persons Grose
was likely to direct as "proper to attend the same", that is to
the officers of the Corps. They had quickly organised the
bringing of more from Bengal, Batavia, and Rio de Janeiro as well
as from Massachusetts, for they were finding it a most acceptable
means of hiring labour and buying produce.</p>

The letter mentioned had arrived only a few days after Phillip
wrote his comments on the exclusion of rum from the soldiers'
ration.]</p>
<p>The home authorities, thinking an isolated prison would have
no use for money, at first provided none. Convicts worked as
punishment, and Whitehall paid in England for the freight of the
store-ships. What use was there for money? If goods had to be
bought from visiting ships or elsewhere, the Governor might draw
bills on the Treasury. Things worked out much less simply at Port
Jackson. Officers whose pay was due in London could draw bills as
well as the Governor. Thus they too could buy goods from whalers
and others. What they bought they bartered for labour with which
to till or improve the 15,639 acres granted during the three
short years of military ascendancy. Much of the labour they
obtained at first for nothing from assigned servants victualled
at the stores. Later it cost the price of its "keep" when under
Hunter and King they were required to pay for such servants'
rations. But thereafter they found it expedient to pay wages in
"truck", either rum or provisions, to three grades of labour, (a)
"government men" working in their own time, (b) assigned
servants, and (c) expirees.</p>
<p>Phillip had at first set the convicts to work from sunrise to
sunset, as part of their punishment. All did as little as the lax
supervision of their fellows would exact. To encourage effort he
therefore defined certain tasks as a day's work, and set the
convict who had completed his task free to cultivate his garden
or to do as he chose. In Phillip's time he seldom chose to work
for others. The officers were forced to follow suit and define
daily tasks for their assigned servants. Then, to keep control of
their servants after the not exacting task was done, they too
found it worth while to offer some reward as an inducement to
extra work. Expirees were in a position to demand wages for the
whole time worked. They had the alternative of applying to
government for a settler's grant and for cattle from the public
herd with which to make an independent home and start life
afresh.</p>
<p>Rum, as Phillip foresaw, proved a much appreciated relief from
the store rations. But it was more. So universally acceptable was
it that it became a medium of exchange, a commodity for which
convicts, whether in the government gangs or assigned, were ready
to do extra work. Expirees would take payment in rum; and for
rum, too often, settlers bartered their produce. Most who took it
were content to consume it themselves. Provident habits were
rare. The convicts drew rations from the stores, and expiree
settlers did the same until their farms were producing. "Much
work", wrote Hunter to Portland, in excusing his tolerance of
rum, "will be done by labourers, artificers and others for a
small reward in this article . . . which money could not purchase
. . . . It is not by an extra allowance of the common slop
clothing or the provision issued from the public store that this
labour is to be obtained, for those men as well as women who have
been some time here, and particularly those whose term is expired
and who are disposed to work, aspire to a better kind of dress
and are desirous of indulging with their tea and sugar, as well
as the gratification of a little tobacco and spirits at times,
which whilst thus applied with moderation is certainly not ill
employed".*</p>

1796.]</p>
<p>Beyond a doubtful half-gallon per annum, however, the
generality could get rum only by working for those who had it to
give. So for the twenty years or more that it remained the
customary means of paying wages, rum placed the key to wealth in
the hands of those who could answer the convicts' insatiable call
for it. Grose and his associates, with McArthur playing as ever a
leading part, had supplemented Phillip's ship-board communism in
necessaries by an exchange economy based on truck wages, with rum
as the main item of consumption and motive for exertion. These
officers may have known little and cared less about the
implications and possible results of what they were doing.
Perhaps such a change was inevitable to colonists of a trading
race, and trade was in sight as soon as Ruse, the first expiree
settler, grew more grain on his little farm than his family could
consume. Its evil form, with rum as currency, expressed the
neglect of Whitehall to provide a local money and the character
of the ruling class who repaired the omission.</p>
<p>In their days of power they laid themselves out to make the
best of both worlds&mdash;the wages system of England and the
rations of her New Holland prison. Explaining to Whitehall that
it took time to make land fruitful, Grose allowed the officers,
including himself; to draw rations and slops from the public
stores for their assigned servants.** The expense soon roused the
ire of the Treasury, which was paying for produce twice
over&mdash;first in the rations used in growing it, and then in
the fixed prices for the wheat, maize and meat delivered at the
stores. Under pressure from home, and in spite of outcry from the
subsidized infant industry, Governors Hunter and King charged the
landowners for the rations drawn. Subsidized industries never
willingly grow up. Whitehall then tried to set the clock back and
to replace all purchase of settlers' produce by direct filling of
the stores with grain and meat grown by the convicts on
government farms.</p>

<p>The exchange economy, however, inevitably triumphed over
communism. It called into play motives of self-interest and hope
more continuous and powerful than fear of the government
overseer. Using a common third as reward, it gave to all who
would make the effort freedom to decide by what service they
could gain more of that reward. Expirees and officers might grow
grain and produce for the stores or for private sale. Even the
convict, apart from the penal chain-gangs, might work for wages.
These were paid in "truck" at computed prices,*** and the
officers, it is true, made their official privileges a screen for
much that was villainy by our standards. Yet, even an exchange
economy based upon tyranny and rum offered a freedom to
experiment, a career open to talent, unknown in the lethargy of
institutional communism.</p>

<p>Even the most selfish feature of the military regime, the
assignment of convict servants to cultivators, was a step in
advance of their serried degradation in the government gangs.
When assigned to cultivators the convicts' services were in legal
form lent, not sold. They remained "government men". Beyond
question these assigned servants were harshly used.* In 1800
Governor Hunter made the presentation of delinquents before a
magistrate the preliminary&mdash;for it very rarely proved an
obstacle&mdash;to their punishment Until then masters had assumed
a right to horsewhip them. The effect of the system on the
attitude of employers to labour must not be minimized, but there
was a germ of economic freedom in the mere facts of trade and of
payment of wages by "truck". All the degradation and extortion
which accompanied the use of rum could not blot out the dawn,
through that sinister method, of the freedom to produce and
consume as he chooses which the use of money brings to the
individual. A bad money may lead the individual to use that
freedom ill, but it may later be replaced by a good money which
does not.</p>

the adventures makes the element of fiction evident enough, has a
value akin to that of the Homeric poems in its vivid portrayal of
the customs and setting of old colonial days.]</p>
<p>From the first the new economy put power into the hands of
those who rose superior to the evil of the money they used.
Elizabeth McArthur's pen-picture of Elizabeth Farm at Parramatta,
written shortly after Governor Hunter's arrival, is one of
freedom confined to a dominant few.** "For such as have many in
their employment it becomes necessary to keep on hand large
supplies of such articles as are most needed, for shops there are
none. . . . The officers in the colony, with a few others
possessed of money or credit in England, unite together and
purchase the cargoes of such vessels as repair to this country
from various quarters. Two or more are chosen from the number to
bargain for the cargo offered for sale, which is then divided
amongst them in proportion to the amount of their subscriptions.
This arrangement prevents monopoly, and the impositions that
would be otherwise practised by the masters of ships."</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Macarthur Records</i>, p. 51. It is there
dated 1 September 1795, but this is a slip. References in it to
Macarthur's resignation of his superintendence of government
agriculture and to the season of the year make it plain that it
was written in 1796.]</p>
<p>As to the market from which they obtained a return for this
expenditure on truck, she says, "some thousands of persons are
fed from the public stores, all of whom were formerly supplied
with flour from England to meet the demand for bread. But since
so many individuals have cleared farms they have thereby been
enabled to raise a great quantity of grain in the country, which
is purchased by the Commissary at 10<i>s</i>. a bushel, and
issued for what are termed rations. In payment for which the
Commissary issues a receipt, approved of by the Government. These
receipts pass current here as coin. When any number have been
accumulated in the hands of individuals they are returned to the
Commissary, who gives a bill on the Treasury in England for them.
These bills amount to thirty or forty thousand pounds annually.
How long the Government may continue so expensive a plan it would
be difficult to foresee. Pigs are bought upon the same system as
would also be sheep and cattle if their numbers would admit of
their being killed. Beef might be sold at 4<i>s</i>. if not
5<i>s</i>. the lb. A good horse is worth £140 to
£150. Be it ever so bad it never sells for less than
£100. From this statement you will perceive that those
persons who took early precautions to raise live stock have at
present singular advantages."</p>
<p>In Mrs McArthur's description one may detect a sense that the
control of the market by the early birds was too good to last.
Chafing at the officers' "singular advantages", such as their
monopoly of imported goods, the settlers from convicts sought the
intervention of Whitehall and of the Governor. A petition
addressed in February 1800 by the settlers around Parramatta to
the Secretary of State tells how that monopoly weighed upon them.
It is the other side of the shield Elizabeth McArthur held
up&mdash;a picture of "intolerable burdens which have not only
cut off all hope of their independence, but reduced them and
their families to a state of beggary and want, and incapacitated
them from prosecuting the culture of their lands with vigour. . .
. The tillage of land in this country", they explain, "is
conducted in a different manner from what it is in Europe, the
latter with the assistance of horses and oxen, the former wholly
by men, who to keep pace with the growing extortion of
monopolists and dealers, rise (<i>sic</i>) the price of their
labour in proportion to the price of imported commodities. The
price of grain being fixt, the poor settlers have no means of
avoiding the impositions of the dealer and labourer, but are
crushed under the heavy weight of expences attending agriculture,
which frequently exceed the amount of their crops. In fact the
whole of the very exorbitant profits of trade are extorted from
them rather than the consumers of any other description, who in
general are indifferent what prices they give for any article as
the burden of expences falls on the land holders".***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>H.R. of A</i>. series <small>I</small>,
vol. <small>II</small>, p. 442. Cf. vol. <small>II</small>, p.
607, Governor King to Portland 28 September 1800.]</p>
<p>The boon which the petitioners sought, as a remedy for all
their ills, was a return towards government tutelage, the
establishment by the government of "a public warehouse, from
which the settlers might be supplied with every necessary article
at such a rate as would not only enable them to meet the wishes
of His Excellency Governor Hunter in his intended reduction of
the price of grain, but also considerably diminish the expences
of government by enabling the landholder to support his family,
who from mere indigence are now dependent on the public
store".</p>
<p>The settlers on the Hawkesbury, from whom were demanded prices
even higher than those instanced by the Parramatta petitioners,
solved the problem by direct action. They set up stills in the
rough country behind Green Hills, and distilled "rum" from their
own grain. So busy was the traffic in this "moonshine", sold at
first at six shillings a gallon, that a grain shortage
threatened.</p>
<p>More than the crooked ways of Sydney streets may thus be
traced to the period of military rule. Wage earners under the
wing of a benevolent government, traders meeting every increase
of wages by exacting higher prices for their wares, a country
population between the upper and nether millstones of regulated
wages and prices seeking state assistance, but ready to pursue
its own interests by the most direct means&mdash;all may be
descried in the first dawn of exchange in New South Wales.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br>
<br>
A Conflict of Evils</h3>
<br>
<p><small>GOVERNORS</small> Hunter, King and Bligh, who followed
Phillip in the dynasty of ships' captains, were successively the
focus of conflict between their masters at the Home and Colonial
offices * and their servants in the New South Wales Corps. The
period 1789-1810 also saw the stubborn maturing of the McArthurs'
plans to grow fine wool for export, but the events in which the
colonists were interested revolved in squalid turmoil about two
bad businesses&mdash;public agriculture and the trade in rum.</p>
<p class="foot">[* As to the various offices and secretaries at
Whitehall responsible at different dates for the Australian
colonies see the article "Colonial Office" in the <i>Australian
Encyclopaedia</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 282.]</p>
<p>General John Hunter's first impression of the colony he had
last seen in the gloomy days of 1792 was one of admiration for a
"state of agriculture and the breeding of livestock" far above
his expectation. Under the spell of the "extremely well-qualified
Inspector of Public works", Captain John McArthur, he concluded
that this was the result of "the raising of grain and the
breeding of live stock in the hands of private individuals. They
are self-interested in what is their own property and it
certainly succeeds better with them than in the hands of
government". He assumed that the repetition in his instructions
of the old direction to raise a "public fund" by the labour of
convicts had been antiquated by colonial experience since its
first issue. "If Government were to continue to cultivate land
sufficient for the maintenance of whatever number of convicts may
be hereafter sent out, there would be an effectual stop to the
exertions of industrious farmers, for want of a market for their
crops. That we shall soon have abundance there is scarcely any
reason to doubt." Rations, too, would provide an inelastic basis
for a community bound to grow in numbers and wants and to escape
out of the Governor's hand. Children of convicts were not born
prisoners nor did expirees always sink again into bondage. The
success of independent producers would incite and educate
enterprise in others, and exchange would enable such folk to
share their successes.</p>
<p>Hunter's superiors at home, however, refused to see that any
conflict need arise between communism and freedom to produce and
exchange. "Nothing", according to the Duke of Portland, "ought,
to be more reconcileable than the public interest of every State
and that of the individuals who compose it, and as that union
must be the consequence of proper management, I am persuaded it
cannot be more likely to be effected than in a country the
government of which is placed in your hands." This, from a Duke
and a Cavendish-Bentinck to an old sailor.** whose public duty
had always been his conscience, was irresistible. Yet Whitehall's
injunctions to keep down expenses and maintain prison agriculture
made an uneasy and divided duty. Refusing McArthur a salary as
inspector of public works, Hunter lost his services. To withdraw
assigned servants and resume public agriculture on exhausted
fields would, he clearly saw, jeopardize existing production and
force him to draw more bills on the Treasury in payment for
imported flour.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Hunter was 58 when he returned to New South
Wales as Governor.]</p>
<p>Even the herding of public stock by convicts was wasteful in
the extreme. "The hog not being a grazing animal and there being
nothing in the country yet discovered for their sustenance but
grass, they cannot be allowed to run at large; they must be
confined and fed upon corn; and very considerable is the quantity
they require. Every little farmer can afford to feed a few upon
the refuse or damaged corn, and sell to the government at less
than half of what it would cost the public if rearing large
numbers. Numerous herds of such animals allowed to run loose
would also be dangerous to the farmer whose grounds are yet all
open." The only effective convict herdsman had been the one who
in 1788 lost in the bush a Cape bull and some cows belonging to
Governor Phillip and "Government". Just after Hunter's arrival
they and their progeny, numbering over forty, were found on the
far side of the Nepean, south-west of Sydney, in a fertile valley
thenceforth known as the Cowpastures. It was decided to leave the
herd unmolested, as a valuable reserve of beasts for future
emergencies.</p>
<p>The officers' estates continued to prosper despite Portland's
insistence and Hunter's orders that the rations and clothing
issued to any assigned servants, other than two batmen per
officer, should be paid for in produce or cash.*** McArthur
introduced a labour-saving device in 1796&mdash;the first plough
seen in New South Wales&mdash;and so kept up the profits of
agriculture even under the new rule.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** General Order, May 1798, <i>H.R. of A</i>.
series <small>I</small>, vol. <small>II</small>, p. 215. Cf. vol.
<small>I</small>, p. 647.]</p>
<p>For the convicts remaining in or returned to government employ
Hunter found work on public buildings rather than in public
agriculture. His efforts to enforce attendance at divine service
had been ill-received in that cantankerous colony. Someone burnt
down the church. "Double-logged "gaols at Sydney and Parramatta
were equally or more unpopular and were "burnt by design". Stone
windmill towers, barns and storehouses and a few roads and
bridges lasted better. But McArthur undermined Hunter's credit
with the Duke of Portland, already endangered by his preference
for private to public farming. He reported the Governor's
partiality in allowing some cultivators the use of more than two
assigned servants victualled "on the stores".****</p>
<p class="foot">[**** <i>H.R. of A</i>. series <small>I</small>,
vol. <small>II</small>, pp. 89 to 93]</p>
<p>Philip Gidley King, a man of smaller mind but greater energy
than Hunter, bought the favour of Whitehall by undertaking to
renew prison agriculture, and despite such crudities as hand
tillage, harvesting with sickles and transport to the barns on
convicts' backs, he did draw better returns from land at
Toongabbie and a farm he rented on the Hawkesbury. But he, too,
was soon lamenting the inferiority of public to private farming.
In 1801, his first season of office, the "full rations
victualled" numbered 2365 and required 29,640 bushels of wheat.
The produce of government lands made up 8000 bushels, leaving a
"deficiency to be supplied by individuals" of 21,640 bushels.
"Individuals" that year won 60,000 bushels from some 4000 acres.
"As the labour of prisoners working on public ground is exacted
from them by the hand of authority, they are not actuated by the
same motives as those who labour for their own profit. This, with
their very bad characters and former pursuits, . . . requires a
constant and unremitted attention to make their labour the least
beneficial. . . . The overseers are not much better. . . .
Notwithstanding the assistance given by the superintendents,
every exertion necessarily falls on the Governor who alone is
responsible and consequently interested in the advancement and
prosperity of the colony." This is not a flattering picture. It
exposes all too plainly the Achilles' heel of communism&mdash;its
incapacity to organize production adequate to support its liberal
consumption. Denying scope to ambition, it relies on the
intermittent motive of fear.</p>
<p>The continued progress on officers' farms made it easy for
King to enforce strictly the home authorities' ruling as to
assigned servants. General Orders defined clearly the conditions
on which such labour was lent, and required all who received
assigned servants to sign these terms and to make regular returns
of those they employed.* The Order of 31 October 1800 enacted
quite a code of wages and conditions of employment. From this it
appears that assigned servants and convicts working in their own
time expected, over and above their rations, about ten shillings
a week. By the end of King's term of office the assignment of
convicts' labour had become, in Coghlan's phrase, "a legal
covenant between the Government and the employer, that the latter
should maintain a convict for a certain period, receiving his
labour in return". The Government retained, as it had not done in
the American colonies, responsibility for the reasonable
treatment of convicts. Their labour was leased on terms which
defined the convict's living and relieved government of expense
but not of a certain care for the "servants of the crown". In
health their misdeeds could legally be punished by the Governor
alone. In sickness they were returned to official keeping. By
good conduct they might earn a conditional, even an absolute,
pardon. In any event the assigned servant who satisfied his
master escaped the degradation of the government gangs.** He
remained a protected subject and escaped on sufferance from the
heavy hand of justice.</p>

"We frequently substitute for corporal punishment a certain time
to labour for the public . . . and this is more felt by the
criminal than any other punishment."]</p>
<p>Prior to Governor Macquarie's time, little was done to better
the lot of the women convicts. The method of selecting for
transportation to New South Wales, as described by the Committee
on Transportation in 1812, had in view rather the riddance of
Britain and Ireland of their worst scum than the reform of those
transported. "With respect to female convicts it has been
customary to send without any exception all whose state of health
will admit of it, and whose age does not exceed 45 years. . . .
Your committee are aware that the women sent out are of the most
abandoned description, but yet with all their vices such women as
these were the mothers of a great part of the inhabitants now
existing in the Colony, and from this stock only can a reasonable
hope be held out of rapid increase to the population".*** Their
early treatment had been a mixture of negligence and brutality.
Some were taken as wives or servants by settlers, soldiers or
convicts. Those left on the Government's hands were set to work
at making up slop clothing, and, when a factory had been built
for them at Parramatta, were employed in the weaving of a coarse
cloth out of which blankets and rough jackets were made. Prior to
the reforms instituted at Castlereagh's bidding after 1812, when
the wretchedness of their lot had become known, the one gleam of
humanity in this chapter of evil was Governor King's strong
support of orphanages, primarily for girls, at both Sydney and
Parramatta. "To save the youth of the colony from the destructive
examples of their abandoned parents" he showed a continued zeal
in appropriating minor sources of colonial revenue to the
maintenance of the orphanages.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>Report of Committee on
Transportation</i>, 1812, pp. 9-12. The Committee was opposing
Macquarie's representations against the sending of women
convicts, e.g. 30 April 1810: "Female convicts are as great a
drawback as the others are beneficial."]</p>
<p>Governors Hunter, King and Bligh, each in his own manner,
opposed the rum-traders' readiness to give such a public what it
wanted, "a fiery poison" fatal to the consumer's sense of his own
welfare. Here was free enterprize at its worst. The presumption
on which the general case for free enterprize rests, of a harmony
between individual wealth and general welfare, was in this
instance obviously at fault. In three ways the naval governors
restricted the supply of spirits; by licensing houses for its
retail sale, by limiting imports and by suppressing illicit
distillation from grain. More effective in the end were an
alternative system of exchanging grain for stores, and the
provision of a sound money with which anyone might safely trade
for cash.</p>
<p>Hunter's attack on the officers' trading monopoly was easily
bluffed off. As with the rationing of assigned servants, he
hesitated and was lost. Though explicitly instructed to allow no
spirits to be landed without his consent, he wondered whether
such orders would be obeyed, and put it to Portland that there
was much to be said for rum as a reward. By November 1796,
however, he was alive to "the astonishing state of indolence and
indifference about the affairs of the public which the private
traffic of individuals have (<i>sic</i>) brought about". The general
licentiousness arose, he thought, from the unseemly activity of
the officers "in a most pernicious traffic with spirituous
liquors". Considering the advantages given them, he felt the
strongest astonishment "that they should have ever thought of
condescending to enter into trade of any kind, except that of
disposing to Government the produce of their agricultural
labours".</p>
<p>Hunter's opposition proved, however, a mere wringing of hands.
He forbade licensed dealers to pay for settlers' grain with
spirits, but he could not bring himself to employ, against his
social equals, a police recruited entirely from the convict
class. Almost every official was in the ring, and the Governor
was isolated and powerless. Field of Mars settlers asked him to
give them an official credit on their grain, so that they might
themselves buy part of a ship's cargo and escape the snares of
"dealers, pedlars and extortioners". Hunter's only response was a
fatuous General Order, 25 June 1799, desiring all settlers "to
keep possession of their own money until they are apprised by
public notice that a cargo has been brought, the officers having
undertaken the trouble of officiating as agents for the general
benefit of the whole colony".</p>
<p>This order led to his recall. It confirmed the impression of
incompetence he had given by fumbling the project of selling
imports at retail from the government store.* This he twice
recommended, the second recommendation drawing the curt answer
that he had already been told to do it. His General Order of June
1798 about the self-sacrificing officers meant, he was informed,
"a sanction to the officers to engage in traffic" and therefore
an apology for the disgraceful doings he had so hotly denounced.
In. January 1800, still unmindful of his fall, he frankly
confessed his impotence to control McArthur's importation of
spirits. "I am sufficiently experienced here to know that whilst
the article sought after is in this harbour, or indeed any other
on this coast, it is impossible to counteract the designs of
those who wish to have it. . . . To oppose its being landed, my
lord, will be vain for want of proper officers to execute such
orders as I might see occasion to give."</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>H.R. of A</i>. series <small>I</small>,

<p>Philip Gidley King meant to be a Governor of tougher will.
General Orders flowed from his pen like thunderbolts from high
Olympus. Spirits might not be sold "from the beating of the
taptoo ** until the following noon, nor during Divine Service".
Persistent unlicensed sellers should serve three months on the
hulk 'Supply'. The clash was not long in coming. A creature of
McArthur's was convicted of trading spirits with convicts for
their rations of salt meat&mdash;a powerful incentive to theft by
the hungry. He lost his licence and had his liquor staved.***
Shortly after this declaration of war, McArthur found himself in
temporary command of the New South Wales Corps, and, a
disagreement having arisen over the court-martial of an officer
accused of petty thieving, he contrived to isolate Governor King
by a social boycott. He so far succeeded with the Junior
Officers, that Colonel Paterson on his return could find no other
means of answering the extension of the boycott to himself, for
refusing to participate in it, than a challenge to McArthur. They
met. Paterson was seriously wounded. King put McArthur under
arrest. Then he ordered him to proceed to Norfolk Island in
charge of a detachment. McArthur refused to go until his arrest
was cleared by a court-martial. King, holding the only officers
who could compose such a court to be "no impartial judges", sent
him off to England.****</p>

dismasted by a "willy-willy" off the N.W. of Australia, took
refuge at Amboyna. For an incident which happened there,
delightfully characteristic of the pugnacious McArthur, see
<i>Macarthur Records</i>, p. 62.]</p>
<p>By a ship other than that bearing the official account of this
turmoil, the Governor pictured to his namesake, the
Under-Secretary, McArthur's ascendancy in the colony and his own
predicament in "belling the cat". "He came here in 1790 more than
£500 in debt, and is now worth at least £20,000 . . .
His employment during the eleven years he has been here has been
that of making a large fortune, helping his brother-officers to
make small ones, and sowing discord and strife." King counted on
McArthur's resignation from the New South Wales Corps. "But come
out here again he certainly must, as a very large part of his
immense fortune is vested here in numerous herds, flocks and vast
domains." Greater than these resources, however, King rated the
"art, cunning, impudence and basilisk eyes" by which McArthur was
able to achieve any object he pursued. "It is to these odds and
the independence of his fortune I have to oppose my exertion for
the tranquillity of this colony, the welfare of the public
service, and my own reputation."</p>
<p>But Governor King's exertions against the rum traffic grew
very spasmodic while McArthur was away. The Governor-General of
India, at his request, checked the sending of Bengal rum.
Warnings sent by the American minister in London to British
consuls in the United States had less effect. The Yankees were
old hands at smuggling, especially with rum. Much still came
from Britain. King sent away several cargoes, mostly of American
or Indian origin, but his enforcement of the limit of 300 gallons
which might be landed from any one vessel was never strict. "So
great was the fame of the propensity of the inhabitants of this
colony to the immoderate use of spirits and the certainty of
getting any amount of payment in government bills", he complained
to Portland, "that I believe all the nations of the earth agreed
to inundate the colony with spirits."</p>
<p>Between September 1800 and October 1802, 37,891 gallons of
spirits and 22,932 gallons of wine were sent away, but by his own
account 69,980 gallons of spirits and 33,246 gallons of wine were
landed, an annual consumption of five gallons three quarts of
"rum" and two gallons three quarts of wine to every man, woman
and child in the colony's average population of 5807 during that
period. Though not an abstemious person, the average Australian
of 1925-6 consumed less than two quarts of spirits (.44 of a
gallon) and just two quarts of wine, including both imported and
local liquors. He drank, it is true, 11.34 gallons of
beer&mdash;quite another matter. By that alternative King was
anxious to slake his subjects' thirst. Hop-plants were sent out
in 1802 at Sir Joseph Banks' instance and brewing utensils
followed. A brewery was duly started at Parramatta in May 1804.
Simultaneously King laid a duty of £5 a hundred gallons on
imported rum. Neither beer nor duty made any difference. The
Governor himself still used rum as an official reward for the
apprehension of criminals who had "gone bush".</p>
<p>Some odds and ends of metallic money scraped together during
the period of the Napoleonic Wars were quite inadequate to
displace rum from its general acceptance as a medium of trade. A
thousand pounds of English silver had been sent to Philip to pay
marine artificers at work on ship-repairing. In 1801 this silver
was supplemented by £2500 in "cart-wheel" pennies, clumsy
ounce-weight things that went for twopence in the colony. They
were good payment for debts up to £5, but the weight of
them in such mass, and the Governor's refusal to take them at
colonial value in payment for bills on London, marred their
favour. Ships refitting in the harbour brought in all manner of
strange coins&mdash;Johannas, ducats, gold mohurs, pagodas,
Spanish dollars, rupees and guelders&mdash;but often both these
and the British shillings were absorbed in paying vessels for
imported stores when bills on London happened to be short. Rum,
however, was always to be had. A little cozening would induce a
settler to take it for his produce or as change when he "cashed"
the commissary's receipt. Such receipts were then convertible
into bills on London, the external currency that paid for
imports, and more rum.</p>
<p>King continued Hunter's plan of retailing stores to the
settlers, over and above the issue of free rations to convicts.
This kept some out of the clutches of the rum-dealers and
restrained the rate of profit at which private traders could sell
imported goods. But the dishonesty of his underlings and the
propensity of settlers to set up shop with the cheap government
wares forced him to hedge with precautions the right to buy.
First both Governor and Commissary scrutinized the list of the
settler's wants. Then each customer was admitted singly to the
warehouse in a loft, up a ladder at which a sentry mounted guard.
For all that, the trade involved in retailing King's Sydney
purchases of ships' cargoes and the consignments made by the
Victualling Board encouraged independent merchants to take a hand
in breaking the ring. First of these was one Robert Campbell.
After acting as Sydney agent to a Calcutta firm that sold cattle,
sugar and spirits, he started business on his own account in
King's term of office.</p>
<p>The increase of goods due to the reduction of settlers' costs
meant the production of more grain, and this augmented the
settler's power to buy. Grain was thus occasionally in excess
supply, but more often floods created dearth and the Governor
found a great vacillation in the readiness of settlers to deliver
their grain at the fixed price.* At first he ascribed this new
trouble to McArthur's usual "art, cunning and impudence", and
argued stiffly "that neither scarcity or plenty should influence
the price" (8 November 1801).</p>
<p class="foot">[* For an account of the floods prior to 1806,

<small>V</small>, p. 697, King to Camden, 7 April 1806.]</p>
<p>Towards the end of his term King grew weary of the isolation
in which every attempt at active rule involved him. Every move to
regulate trade offended some interest and drew the fire of
anonymous critics. Their "pipes" founded a species of lampooning
journalism that still grows rank in Australia.** One represented
King as anxious, on hearing that "Pitt and Portland were out", to
feather his nest by every means while still in power.</p>

Of whalers' investments I own I've a share.</p>
<p>He met such attacks sensibly by starting in 1803 the <i>Sydney
Gazette</i>, but he was by then heartily sick of the too vast orb
of his fate. In May he applied for leave to vacate the office he
had once eagerly sought. Three years, he waited impatiently for
relief. The successor who arrived in August 1806 was a
protégé of Banks, Captain William Bligh, who had
seen service under both Cook and Nelson, and had won fame as
"Breadfruit Bligh" of the 'Bounty'. To Banks he seemed a man of
"integrity unimpeached, a mind capable of providing its own
resources in difficulties, civil in deportment, and not subject
to whimper and whine when severity of discipline is wanted to
meet emergencies".</p>
<p>Bligh found at his coming a community sunk deep in depravity,
whose most hopeful element, the farmers along the Hawkesbury, had
just been impoverished by a recurrence of the floods. His task,
as he saw it, was to revive agriculture, to build churches and
schools and to amend by instruction the moral and spiritual
shortcomings of his people. Most of the rising generation were
entirely neglected, having no parents, "the mothers being dead,
and their fathers having left the country as either sailors,
soldiers or prisoners who became free".*** Neither by word nor
deed, however, did he exhibit a leader's power to transform his
charges into a self-reliant society of families shaping their
lives by a free exchange of services. His main instructions,
repeating once more those given twenty years earlier to Phillip,
still ordered him to create by prisoners' labour a public fund of
foodstuffs, to be issued by authority. As a means of recovering
from the recent disaster such communal subsistence-farming was
hopeless. As a check on the speculative and fluctuating prices
asked outside the stores by private cultivators it was no better.
Since the institution of assigned service, public farming was
perforce conducted at a high cost with convicts whom no private
employer would take.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Bligh to Windham, 7 February 1807, <i>H.R.
of A</i>. ser. <small>I</small>, vol. <small>VI</small>; p. 123.
The weakness in early New South Wales family life may be judged
from this short paragraph in the same despatch. "The inhabitants
are healthy and Marriages increase; in my late Surveys I
ascertained the Married Women were 395; Legitimate children 807;
Natural children 1025."]</p>
<p>In his additional instructions to Bligh, however, Castlereagh
had recommended the activity of free producers selling for an
open market as the most hopeful chance of reducing dependence on
England. Wheat and maize, except when floods swept away the
harvest, were coming forward in ample supply. Castlereagh looked
for live stock from the same source. In good set terms he
propounded the new doctrine of freedom of enterprize. "Nothing, I
conceive, will more essentially contribute to bring forward the
supplies which the country is becoming able to furnish in most of
the Articles of first necessity such as Corn, Poultry, Vegetables
etc., than the abolition of all restrictions in the disposal of
those supplies. In like manner it is not judged necessary for you
to interfere in future in respect to the demands of Adventurers
bringing articles for trade to the Colony, further than to
prevent improper communications between the ships and the
convicts, excepting with regard to the Article of Spirits."</p>
<p>Bligh awaited the opportunity of an abundant harvest before
abolishing the fixed official price of wheat.* He had hopes that
the scarcity he found at his arrival would more effectively than
any admonition "teach the settlers to be more provident and
industrious". "Considerable importation", he reasoned, "would
lead to great indifference, as it would reduce the price of grain
and make it not worth their while to grow it." In this he was
more considerate than his successor, whose importations were to
produce precisely that depressing effect.** "When they begin to
find a regular market for their grain", concluded Bligh,
"agriculture will be the chief pursuit both here and at the
out-settlements." But in taking the role of patron of
agriculture, Bligh was moved by other motives than those of
economic reason.</p>

<p>The exception to the rule of <i>laissez faire</i> which Castlereagh
had noted Bligh's duty to interfere "with regard to the Article
of Spirits"&mdash;loomed larger to the new Governor than the rule
itself. Here was a trade in which his charges wretchedly
sacrificed their produce to the enrichment of an already wealthy
few. He had been sent to repress it. His arch-antagonist in this
duty had earned the displeasure of Sir Joseph Banks. Bligh's view
of all John McArthur's energies in the colony was distorted by
his determination to overthrow one who had baulked both Hunter
and King. McArthur, we can now see, stood head and shoulders
above his fellow-colonists in economic foresight as well as in
money-making. When Governor Phillip was hoping to find out how
soon an expiree could be induced by the hope of independence to
grow enough food for himself and his family, McArthur had
proposed to use those "basilisk" eyes of his to keep a whole gang
of convicts "hard at it", producing by their combined labour a
surplus that would feed the colony and make him rich. When under
Grose this plan was being tried, he foresaw that the home
authorities would soon complain of the expense of feeding the
assigned servants. He was therefore the first to offer to feed a
hundred himself, and to press on Hunter a plan to render the
colony self-supporting in animal food by distributing pigs among
the better convicts. As soon as success in raising grain and
animal food by private activity came in sight, his mind ranged in
search of a way by which the colonists might pay for their needs
from abroad. What could they export which, unlike the whale-oil
and seal-skins already being won on the coast, would be permanent
and expansive in supply, and secure against unthrifty
exploitation by intruders? This forward-moving quality of his
mind was of invaluable service to Australia in the end, but in
his haste to reach each fresh objective, McArthur was ready to
clutch every resource of his fellow-colonists which was legally
within his reach, and with such weapons to fight relentlessly for
more.</p>
<p>Neither opponent, indeed, was restrained by a conscience
sensitive, to the social consequences of his actions. Whatever
Bligh's character may have been when in command of the ill-fated
'Bounty', his use of authority in New South Wales was often
capricious and at times precipitate.*** His main duty, as he saw
it, was to restrain McArthur's traffic in spirits. Yet his first
acts in the colony were hopelessly at variance with the role of
stern rebuker of greed in high places. Before assuming office, he
accepted from Governor King three grants of valuable land at
Sydney, at Parramatta and at Rouse Hill, amounting in all to 1345
acres; and the first grant he made was to his predecessor's wife,
a grant of 790 acres in the district of Evan, to be known by the
curious name of "Thanks". Local manners and customs, he wrote in
November 1806, called for much correction. "The settlers in
general, and particularly those from prisoners, are not honest,
have no prudence and little industry; great chicanery is used in
all their dealings, and much litigation. All this will require a
great deal of attention on my part to remove."</p>
<p class="foot">[*** See Macquarie to Castlereagh, 10 May 1810,
<i>H.R. of A</i>. series <small>I</small>, vol.
<small>VII</small>, p. 331.]</p>
<p>He proceeded to question the validity of certain leases for
fourteen years within the boundaries of Sydney. Phillip had set a
limit of five years to such leases and King had confirmed this.
At the end of his term, however, King had granted fourteen-year
leases to McArthur, Johnston, Blaxcell and others. Farther
afield, Bligh boggled at McArthur's grant in the Cowpastures
beyond the Nepean, made by Lord Camden despite opposition from
Sir Joseph Banks. Though McArthur's cult of fine wool had won
many friends at home, Bligh threw cold water on it at every
opportunity. On the farm he bought at Pitt Town on the
Hawkesbury, he set an example of dairying and agriculture. His
despatches made light of an export of wool. "In general, animal
food is a greater object to the proprietors of sheep than the
fleece, as there is an immediate demand for it." And again "Some
wrong impressions were made in England by reports of the
exportation (of wool) expected from this country. Some of the
ships which arrived about the time I did had orders to purchase
what was ready, but they found none for sale." When McArthur
urged the superiority of his "peaceful productive sheep" over the
herds of wild cattle&mdash;"fine animals" Bligh had called
them&mdash;with whose title and possession of the Cowpastures the
Governor was most sympathetic, Bligh, burst into rage. "What have
I to do with your sheep, Sir? Are you to have such flocks of
sheep as no man ever heard of before? No, Sir!"</p>
<p>Yet the agriculture which Bligh favoured could at best only
relieve the British Treasury of the cost of transporting
provisions to New South Wales. The foodstuffs grown there must
still be purchased before their issue as government rations. That
demand, moreover, was limited and inelastic. In days of war, corn
laws and slow transport, a big export trade in wheat, livestock
or maize was inconceivable. The limit of Bligh's view in public
economy was thus to save the cost and necessity of transporting
salt-meat and flour from overseas. His express instructions and
his naval training alike led him to rate higher than economic
aims the disciplinary task&mdash;restraint on the use of spirits
as barter. Was it not as a fearless disciplinarian that Banks had
recommended him, at a doubled salary?</p>
<p>No evil, he thought, had resulted from the consumption of
spirits. The trouble arose from the pull in hiring labour which
their monopoly in importation had given to officers and big
settlers, to the disadvantage of the small farmers. "To prohibit
the barter being carried on in any way is absolutely necessary to
bring labour to a due value and to support the farming interest."
As examples of the effects of payment in rum, he cited: "A sawyer
will cut one hundred feet of timber for a Bottle of
Spirits&mdash;value two shillings and sixpence&mdash;which he
drinks in a few hours. For the same labour he would charge two
Bushels of Wheat, which would furnish Bread for him for two
months. Hence those who have got no liquor to pay their Labourers
with are ruined by paying more than they can possibly afford for
any kind of labour which they are compelled to hire men to
execute, while those who have liquor gain an immense
advantage."</p>
<p>Bligh's conception of reform was a direct prohibition of the
use of spirits as a means of purchase, coupled with police
measures against private distillation.* Such measures, he knew,
would provoke opposition from those who had "so materially
enriched themselves by" the trade. In social and official
influence they were strongly entrenched, and he had the poorest
opinion of the judge-advocate on whose legal decisions he must
rely. "Mr Atkins the Judge-Advocate", he reported in October
1807, "has been accustomed to inebriety; has been the ridicule of
the community; sentences of death have been pronounced in moments
of intoxication; his determination is weak; his opinion floating
and infirm; his knowledge of the Law insignificant and
subservient to private inclination. Confidential cases of the
Crown where due secrecy is required he is not to be trusted
with." He advocated his removal in the strongest terms.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Regarding the character and remuneration of
these convict and ex-convict police, see M. Phillips, <i>op.

<p>The stage was thus set and the chief characters cast for what
the Sydney populace dubbed "The Rum Puncheon
Rebellion"&mdash;Bligh's deposition by the New South Wales Corps
on the twentieth anniversary of the colony's foundation, 26
January 1808. On one side a Governor blinded by prejudice to the
ability of the little community's only first-class brain; on the
other a group of officer-traders whom McArthur himself despised.
"A more improper set of men", he told his wife, "could not be
collected together".** As traders they drew their wealth mainly
from a traffic which sapped the efforts of convict-settlers to
make a new start by honest toil. Over their doings watched a
court of law in which justice spoke by the whims of one despised
as a drunkard even in that company.</p>
<p class="foot">[** 3 May 1810, <i>H.R. of N.S. Wales</i>, vol.
<small>VII</small>, p.370.]</p>
<p>On New Years' Day 1808 the small settlers and "emancipists",
to the number of 833, petitioned Governor Bligh in the name of
"the extensive rising greatness and enterprising spirit of the
colonists" for "such privilege of trade to their Country vessels
and themselves as other colonists have, and that the Law might be
administered by Trial by Jury of the People as in England".
Castlereagh's additional instructions clearly empowered Bligh to
lend a favourable hearing to the former request. But the older
instructions which had been repeated to Bligh bade him prevent by
all possible means every sort of intercourse between New South
Wales and European settlements in India, China and the Pacific.
Only by licence from the East India Company could English vessels
trade in longitudes east of the Cape of Good Hope. The
officer-capitalists of Sydney, long accustomed to pull the
strings and to exploit these special licences to their private
advantage, sniffed the tainted breeze when emancipist petitioners
asked for a general freedom of trade. Bligh, they knew full well,
meant to upset their system. It was high time they captured, in
defence of their privileges, the whole machinery of government.
The episodes of McArthur's stills and of the seizure of the
"Parramatta" were therefore welcome opportunities to men already
strongly tempted to grasp for their own ends the Governor's
powers to bind and loose.***</p>

<p>The liberty for which they struck consisted in the privileges
of a dominant few, but when they had grasped power and imprisoned
"the Tyrant" the usurpers fell out among themselves.****
McArthur, taking the official style of Secretary to the Colony,
was soon involved in a furious contest with the Blaxlands and
Simeon Lord, a wealthy emancipist, about the control of a sealing
vessel, 'The Brothers'. This culminated in further interference
by the military in the course of justice in the courts. So
formidable was the danger of chaos through these feuds, that in
April, Major Johnston, the rebel Lieutenant-Governor, addressed
to his fellow-conspirators a stern letter of rebuke, reminding
them of their pledged words to support him in assuming the
Government. He challenged any to aver that McArthur had not
fulfilled his share of that solemn engagement. Such an appeal,
backed by a challenge from two men who meant what they said, went
home. A revived sense of common responsibility curbed the
feuds.</p>
<p class="foot">[**** For, an account of the mutiny, see Ernest
Scott's Short History of Australia, pp. 69-74.]</p>
<p>As time brought reflection on their position, however,
financial apprehension made the rebel leaders cautious. How were
the expenses of government to be met? If they drew bills on the
Treasury and these were rejected, their signatures would put
their private fortunes in jeopardy; and they had private
fortunes. So they proceeded to meet current expenditure by
selling the government herds and stores.* They did more. As under
Grose and Paterson in 1793-5, so again under Johnston, Foveaux
and Paterson the main activity of the military government was the
granting of land and stock, the customary first capital for
development.** Their proceedings, reported by Bligh's adherents,
with no loss of unfavourable colour, did more to enlighten His
Majesty's Ministers as to the folly of maintaining a standing
garrison in such an environment than all the despatches of
Governors fearful to confess their own impotence.</p>

<p>The "Rebellion", if the metaphor may be allowed, was a boil in
an unhealthy body in which certain useless elements came into a
conflict of mutual destruction which could be ended only by the
surgeon's knife. It rid the colony of the New South Wales Corps
and, for a time, of its ex-member but continued leader, John
McArthur. It rid it, too, of naval governors and their habit of
trying to order social and economic relations by the methods of
the quarter-deck.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br>
<br>
"Governor Macquarie's Bank"</h3>
<br>
<p><small>COLONEL</small> Lachlan Macquarie, Governor-in-Chief of
New South Wales and its Dependencies from 1 January 1810 to 1
December 1821, has been highly praised.* At a time when many were
turning against him, his zeal and belief in the colony won this
comment from his shrewdest contemporary: "Governor Macquarie is a
man of unblemished honour and character, although it may not have
been his lot to do that which I think no man ever will
do&mdash;to give satisfaction to all".** His modern biographer,
however, sums him up as "a man of very ordinary ability" *** and
an official historian half complains that he "left the
development of the colony's primary industries and the pioneer
experimental work to individuals undirected by the fostering care
of government".**** This he had been instructed to do. Yet,
judging by his ideal of an emancipists' Utopia and his vendetta
against free settlers, his forbearance sprang less from a
thorough appreciation of his instructions than from "total
incapacity" ***** to assess what the pastoral leaders could
achieve. A splendid second-rater, he perceived things and hated
opponents but could not judge the creative value of ideas.</p>

<p class="foot">[***** The phrase is J. T. Bigge's. <i>Macarthur
Records</i>, p. 324.]</p>
<p>Castlereagh's instructions plainly envisaged a colony developing its own
economy.* There was to be an end of naval paternalism over all residents
in the prison marooned on a distant shore. Fixed prices, government
trading and public agriculture were to go. Macquarie furthered the new
policy by providing a bank to keep the currency sound and by building
roads to the wider hinterland which the pastoralists had spied out
beyond, the mountains. But much remained, notably in transportation and
the Navigation Acts, of an older system which had treated all colonies
as distant depots tied to British trade, and the strong wine of despotic
power let loose the Highland chieftain latent in Macquarie.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>H.R. of A</i>. series <small>I</small>,
vol. <small>VII</small>, pp. 80 and 83.]</p>
<p>His first task was the unsolved riddle of rum. As his public
works pay-sheets bear witness, it was still in use to pay wages.
George Street between Brickfield Hill and Bridge Street cost four
hundred gallons. Prompted by Castlereagh, Macquarie recommended
the admission of all rum sent to New South Wales on payment of
"high" duties, say three or four shillings a gallon. The home
government, then contemplating a British duty of £1.
12<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. a gallon, at once chose the higher figure.
It also informed the East India Company, still in charge of
licensing traders and whalers in the South Seas, that any who
traded to "the colony of Botany Bay" might be allowed to carry
spirits thither "for the consumption of the inhabitants of the
said colony". Macquarie thought to take strict control over this
consumption by cutting down licensed houses in Sydney from 85 to
20, and at the out-settlements in due proportion.</p>
<p>Like King he was caught by a return wave which engulfed every
impediment. Official cancellation of licences made little
difference to the sale of rum in "The Rocks" area, near the
wharves. Macquarie granted fifty beer-licences and took the
administration of all licensing orders out of the magistrates'
hands, but the standards he required of their holders proved to
be such that one trader was granted a licence who had been
convicted of unlicensed vending four times in the two preceding
years.</p>
<p>Nor were the wholesalers less adroit in finding the Governor's
blind spot. Early in 1811 ministers at home were astonished to
learn that Macquarie had granted a legal monopoly in the
importation of spirits, other than on government account, to
three men&mdash;Blaxcell, Riley and D'Arcy Wentworth! Blaxcell
and Riley were typical speculative traders, but Wentworth, though
by voluntary exile he had narrowly escaped transportation on a
charge of highway robbery, was now Principal Surgeon and
Superintendent of Police. He was taken into partnership by the
other two during the negotiation of the contract. The three
undertook to erect a large general hospital, including excellent
surgeons' quarters, at no cost to the government other than (i)
the grant to them of the sole right to import spirits for three
years up to 45,000 gallons and (ii) the services of 20 assigned
servants and 80 oxen. The Governor's enthusiasm for fine
buildings (of which more anon) must have blinded him temporarily
to the inconsistency of this monopoly with the policy of open
imports subject to duty, and to the impropriety of making the
Principal Surgeon and Superintendent of Police, with his repute
as a retired highwayman, a partner in profits from the lavish
sale of rum and the cheap erection of the hospital. Temporary
blindness or no, when the Governor permitted breaches of this
contract the partners exacted from him two extensions of the term
of their monopoly. The "Rum Hospital" was duly built. Part of it
still stands in the facade of Parliament House, hallowed to the
legislators of to-day by the traditions of Wentworth junior,
Robertson, Parkes, Dalley and Reid.</p>
<p>The four years of its building were an Indian summer to the
rum-monopolists. Ruefully Hannibal McArthur reported to his Uncle
John in England how they were making hay. Whereas he (Hannibal)
had been forced under the terms of the monopoly to sell a
consignment of spirits to government at 9<i>s</i>. a gallon, duty
free, these contractors, after paying a duty of 3<i>s</i>. a
gallon, were getting 36<i>s</i>. for theirs. Licensed houses
increased more than threefold, and all complaints of disorder in
them met with the cynical contention from Wentworth senior that
the thriving trade meant good revenue for the police fund,
Judging from the total of 144,000 gallons imported during the
four years, a third of which may have been on government account,
the monopoly imported more than was allowed in the original
bond.</p>
<p>Earl Bathurst peremptorily ordered Macquarie to set
importation free at the expiry of the contract, to raise the
duty, and to put an end to the issue of rum at a fixed price to
officials and military, "a practice which even under your Prudent
Administration of it has the Appearance if not the actual Effect
of encouraging the Barter of that Article". The contrite Governor
raised the duty to seven shillings a gallon, and in 1818 to ten
shillings.</p>
<p>Reduced consumption did not speedily follow the substitution
of duties by no means severe for legal prohibition of import.
Consumption during the Hospital Contract seems to have been
about three gallons two quarts per head of population. From 1815
to 1820 it actually rose to over four gallons a head, apart from
smuggling, illicit stills and beer. In England, though the
consumption of spirits rose during the wars, the quantity drunk
per head was in 1830 less than a gallon.</p>
<p>The provision of sound money and a central control of credit
proved, a more effective antidote. Governor King had dreamed of
coin as an antidote to rum as early as November 1800. He,
proclaimed the approaching end of barter "when a sufficient
quantity of copper coin is received in the colony". But the
cart-wheel pennies were local tokens only In December 1804 a
British whaler, the 'Policy', captured near Amboyna a Dutch
supply ship with fifteen chests of dollars aboard, worth
£20,000. This was good silver money acceptable
anywhere&mdash;a fact which disquieted the master of the 'Policy'
who brought his prize into Port Jackson. He asked King to buy the
silver and pay him in bills on London, a safer booty to carry on
the open sea in time of war. King declined "so mighty a
responsibility". He had apparent reason for his caution.
Sealskins were, as he said, "the only staple yet discovered
here", and, in the absence of exports, the more good money put
into circulation the sooner was it drained out to pay for
visiting traders' goods. So disappeared those of the 'Policy's'
dollars that its master and crew spent in Sydney.. Not even the
cutting of the Spanish dollars into eight or ten parts kept them
in circulation.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Spanish dollars were minted freely at Mexico
City from 1535 and had become an excellent international cash in
use from Maine to India. Little sterling silver was minted in
Britain during the first half of George III's reign.]</p>
<p>Ministers at home were too much absorbed in war-finance,
currency depreciation and "scarcity of specie" to pay heed to the
monetary troubles of an obscure colony on the Pacific. Yet the
principle of laissez faire, which Castlereagh enunciated for
Macquarie's guidance, presupposed an honest and stable medium of
exchange. In their search for a money less difficult to carry
than rum or copper pence the colonists had already taken to
issuing private "notes" or "cards", which circulated as "colonial
currency".** A settler wishing to buy goods from a private trader
tendered the receipt the Commissary had given him for his pigs
and grain, and instead of taking out the change in rum, carried
away an I.O.U. from the trader. Possibly the first issuers were
the more reputable traders. To most ex-convict shopkeepers every
settler was "fair game" and his store-receipt showed what he was
worth to rob. Such a trader would count himself a failure if the
whole amount were not promptly "melted down", i.e. taken in rum,
Thus private notes may once have been <i>prima facie</i> evidence
of a self-restraint akin to honesty.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Hence the mildly contemptuous terms "currency
lad" and "currency lass" for children born in the colony.]</p>
<p>Soon they varied as much in value as in style, or more. Some
were in writing; others promised in impressive copper-plate
future payment in sterling for value received. One group of
leading firms tried printing in hot type as a precaution against
old Sydney's expert penmen. With every precaution taken, however,
such "petty banking", as Macquarie dubbed it, left open by its
very, nature "a door to grievous frauds and impositions". Traders
who were still convicts on ticket-of-leave managed by free issue
of currency notes to get hold of many commissariat receipts and
to change these into substantial property, in goods or land.
Then, declaring themselves insolvent, they would employ
confederates to buy up their notes from their defrauded
creditors, at a heavy discount. Apart altogether from such
deliberate fraud, the general issue of colonial currency caused
all its units to depreciate.*** Governors strove in vain to limit
to approved persons the right to issue "notes". Who was to draw
the line and&mdash;a task still more difficult&mdash;to maintain
it when it had been drawn? "Strong personal laws" ordering
redemption in specie did no more under Bligh and Macquarie to
stop fraudulent "currency" than they had done under King and
Bligh to check the excess of rum. A spate of imports in 1812 made
silver so scarce that in January 1813 it was at a premium of 75
per cent.****</p>

<p>At his first coming, Governor Macquarie advocated the
institution of a bank for the provision of notes secured against
land.* His advocacy of a plan avowedly derived "from the famous
Bank of Pennsylvania" and promising a result "Eleven per cent.
above what the Exchequer Bills yield in England" must have read
like a lesson to the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street in sucking
eggs. The Board of Trade, to which Lord Liverpool referred the
proposal, would have none of it. New South Wales was a very
different place from the Cape of Good Hope. The Board suggested
that its Governor be sent £10,000 in dollars, through the
East India Company. They arrived by the sloop 'Samarang' in
November 1812, and Macquarie solved the problem of keeping them
in circulation by punching a large hole in each, giving the ring
or "holey dollar" an official value of five shillings, and the
dump one of fifteen pence. As bullion the dollar was then worth
five shillings for oversea trading. The government undertook to
redeem "holey dollars" and dumps at the end of every two years by
giving for them good bills on London. Thus they formed a local
token currency, being in effect metallic promises to pay. But the
supply was inelastic, and the way still remained open for
creations of private "currency". Those who had no occasion to
make payments to oversea traders passed on the depreciated
notes.</p>

service of the Bank of Ireland and had "had a principal part in
the establishment and conduct of the Bank at the Cape of Good
Hope".]</p>
<p>By the <i>Sydney Gazette</i> the Governor warned issuers of
currency that their safety and advantage lay in giving out no
more. The main burden of a local money issued in excess fell upon
dealers who had to pay importing merchants in sterling yet must
sell their wares at retail for the depreciating currency. But,
plain as the collective interest of the traders might be in
calling a halt, the temptation upon each individual remained. So
many tried to outrun the general disaster that the depreciation
of "currency" was accelerated.</p>
<p>Only a Bank with exclusive right to issue could maintain the
value of paper money at a par with specie and keep trade on
credit sound. Unlimited credit means unlimited belief, an
imprudent attitude in any community. In 1816 Macquarie succeeded
in calling a halt to the unscrupulous. A fresh consignment of
40,000 silver dollars from India enabled him as a first step to
re-enact Bligh's order that notes were to be redeemable at demand
in sterling, then understood as including all specie. Prices and
wages, too, were to be stated in sterling. But how was redemption
to be made customary and easy? A general meeting of traders
agreed early in 1817 that all contracts in existence were to be
re-adjusted, two-thirds prices in sterling being substituted for
those quoted in "currency". So much for past contracts. But who
was to sustain for the future the collective interest in the
equivalence of paper money and specie, of credit and
international cash? Public meetings agree, resolve, dissolve and
disagree. The responsibility for restraint in the issue of paper
currency was placed and shouldered only when it was announced
that a group of leading traders and officials had been granted a
charter to form a bank.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>H.R. of A</i>. series <small>I</small>,
vol. <small>IX</small>, pp. 217 <i>et seq</i>.]</p>
<p>The capital of the contemplated Bank of New South Wales,
gathered in the form of 200 shares of £100 each, was to be
charged with the redemption on demand of all notes which the bank
deemed it prudent to issue. Overissue would thus endanger the
bank's foundation, its stock of international cash. In issuing
notes or otherwise granting the right to draw cash from its
strong-box, the directors of the Bank were in this way made the
colony's financial watchmen. They would hurt themselves first if
they granted credit, <i>i.e.</i> the use of productive resources
on condition of future repayment, to men unable or unready to put
those resources to effective use. The bankers became in a sense
the trustees of their clients' wealth and the guarantors of their
honesty. They encouraged trade between the most dependable, and
were bound by the special circumstances of the colony to pay good
heed to its external trade.</p>
<p>In March 1817 the need for such a regulator of note issues had
grown so clear that Macquarie, with the cautiously worded support
of Judge-Advocate Wylde, granted a Colonial Subscription Bank a
seven-years' charter on his own initiative. He advised the
Colonial Office not merely to confirm the charter but to become
party to the subscription of capital, only £12,600 of which
had been found in the colony. Government, he urged, "should at
least make the Bank the Depository and Medium of all Government
Monies and payments".</p>
<p>Though the Governor's secretary became its first President and
deposits flowed in steadily,** the paid-up capital at opening day
was but £3625, and troubles soon came upon "my favourite
Measure", as Macquarie termed it. The Colonial Office reported
the opinion of the Crown's legal advisers "that you were not
legally empowered either by your Commission or Instructions to
grant such a Charter, and that it is consequently null and
void".*** Holding that no good purpose could be served by any
"interference" in banking on the part of government, the
Secretary of State ordered Macquarie to "intimate to the
gentlemen composing that establishment that they can only
consider themselves in the situation of persons associated for
the purposes of trade, and as such not entitled to any of those
special privileges which it was the object of the Charter to
confer".</p>

<p>Foremost of these was the privilege of indemnity "against all
risk or liability beyond the amount of the Shares respectively
taken by each in the Capital Stock of the said Bank". Among banks
of issue such limited liability was then the exclusive privilege
of the Bank of England. In its absence the subscribers would
become ordinary partners liable to an unlimited extent for the
debts of the bank. Macquarie had hoped that the privilege of
limited liability would induce the sound and cautious to
subscribe adequate capital. A new currency chaos, he foresaw,
would follow the denial of the charter's validity, and he fought
with success, though in a somewhat disingenuous fashion, against
the dissolution of his Bank. Possibly his reply to Bathurst was
written promptly, but it was not sent until 1 September 1820. The
Bank, it then announced, had succeeded beyond his most sanguine
hopes. Its dissolution "would be attended with the most
embarrassing circumstances to every member of the community". "So
great a number of proprietors", he believed, "could not be
legally united together otherwise than by a Charter of
Incorporation".* In the dilemma of "venturing on the suspension
of your Lordship's instructions" or producing "little short of a
General Bankruptcy" by giving effect and publicity to them, he
"ventured to take the weighty responsibility of embracing the
former Alternative". Wherefore he asked for "direct sanction to
his measures for the unexpired portion of the Original Charter of
Seven Years". He did not get it; the question was referred to
Commissioner J. T. Bigge, then conducting a general inquiry into
the colony's affairs. In Bigge's report of 1823 ** a conflict is
evident between accomplished facts in Sydney and Whitehall's new
dogma of <i>laissez faire</i>, forbidding all legal privilege
save to the Bank of England. Bigge bore testimony to the utility
of the Bank in evolving order out of the commercial chaos of
paper based on the honesty of individuals, and to the high credit
it enjoyed. This had survived the loss of half the subscribed
capital (£12,600) through defalcations by its chief
cashier, discovered in January 1821. That credit, he thought, had
grown in part from the belief in its possession of a royal
charter, but as he could not be "insensible to the consequences
of insufficient control that a chartered immunity from the
ordinary risks of commercial partnership has a tendency to
produce", he did not recommend the charter's renewal.*** Yet in
Brisbane's statement of action taken on Bigge's reports appears
the bald entry: "Relative to renewing the Charter of
Incorporation to the Sydney Bank after its expiring in the Year
1824: Charter renewed in 1824".</p>
<p class="foot">[* The right of "exclusive banking" granted to
the Bank of England by the Act of 1697 and further defined by
that of 1742 was interpreted as banking through the issue of
notes "payable on demand or at any less time than six months from
the borrowing thereof". No partnership of more than six persons
could lawfully carry on such business "in that part of Great
Britain called England'. Macquarie seems to have been advised
that he could do nothing repugnant to the laws of England, and
was therefore bound by this second rule. See <i>H.R. of A</i>.

<p>Whatever its standing in the eyes of the law, the Bank proved
a vigorous custodian of the community's financial interests. It
was an early example of the young society's power to create,
independently of the state, organs for collective action. The
coins that passed over its counter would have seemed to a modern
teller fit only for a museum. In 1821 the Bank's clients were
warned against such illegal and counterfeit money as "Dollars and
Dumps which are not silver; Dollars having the usual holes in the
centre but without the Colonial Stamp on them; Colonial Dollars
from which a portion of Silver has been taken round the Centre;
and Dollars that bear a counterfeit Stamp, intending to imitate
the Colonial one surrounding the Hole in the centre, many of
which may be detected by the figures for the date of the year
being transposed from 1813 to 3181".****</p>
<p class="foot">[**** These descriptions will be made more
intelligible by reference to an engraving of the original issue
of Holey Dollars and Dumps, e.g. in the <i>Australian
Encyclopaedia</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 345, or in the
<i>View of Premises of the Bank of New South Wales</i>,
1907.]</p>
<p>It was not merely the opening given by imports of Spanish
dollars for such private issues of mutilated coin which caused
the Bank to take a strong line in advocating a purely British
currency. Governor Brisbane displayed high enthusiasm for the
Spanish dollar. To his scholarly mind it was "an invaluable coin
which has for centuries been disseminating its benefits over
every other portion of the earth&mdash;a coin which from the
extension of its circulation over every part of the commercial
globe may justly be defined the money of the world". As Governor,
he answered the Bank's dislike of the holey dollars by their
recall and re-issue at 3<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. But he admitted
fresh dollars in great quantities, about 400,000 in number,
making them legal tender at five shillings apiece. This official
rate of exchange was more than the bullion value of the silver in
them, and, as the colony's trading prospects improved, Spanish
dollars were poured in to take advantage of the local
over-valuation. In May 1825 the rate at the colonial treasury was
lowered to 4<i>s</i>. 4<i>d</i>., and after Brisbane's departure
in that year British silver was sent out in adequate quantity.
Holey dollars were finally redeemed at 3<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>., and
the unmutilated dollar was accepted only, as so much bullion then
worth 4<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>.</p>
<p>In these adjustments the Bank of New South
Wales&mdash;"Macquarie's Bank", as it was called in lively
reminder of his services, in founding it&mdash;took a strong line
in support of its first aim and reason, stable money. It
denounced Brisbane's use of Spanish coins in government payments
as a rejection of sterling cash payments in favour of a currency
of fluctuating value. Now that the British had resumed specie
payment on a gold monometallic basis, and war-expedients and
depreciation (1798-1821) were no more, the Bank was right.* The
colony's main trade being with Britain, a stable relation, even
identity, in the standard money of the two countries was the
first desideratum, whatever benefits may have been conferred "on
the British and North American Colonies, on the French and Papal
Canadas, on Mahomedan India and on the whole world" as scanned by
the benevolent Brisbane.**</p>

<p class="foot">[** For two years, 1824 to 1826, the Bank issued
notes in dollar denominations 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100. They
were withdrawn in 1826 in favour of sterling notes for £1,
£2, £5, £10 and £20.]</p>
<p>The same primary aim of sound currency was urged by W. C.
Wentworth in support of a reduction of the discount rate in 1825
from 10 to 8 per cent., against a minority of bank shareholders
greedy for maximum gain. Out of this conflict arose the rival
Bank of Australia to which many leading officials and squatters
adhered, such as ex-President J. T. Campbell, John Oxley and John
McArthur. Their knowledge of the inner counsels of the older bank
and perhaps its record of independence explain but hardly excuse
the partisan line taken by Governor Darling against the Bank of
New South Wales. The success of the old Bank and the growth of
the wool trade were attracting intending competitors from far and
near. The promoters of a third bank in Sydney announced that
their shareholding lists, in pointed reflection on the "pure
merinos" who founded the Bank of Australia, were to be open to
every free colonist. They were persuaded, however, to coalesce
with the Bank of New South Wales by the offer of additional
shares in it. While the terms were under discussion, Darling
"discovered" a despatch (July 1823) forbidding his predecessor to
renew the old Bank's charter. A run set in. Darling would agree
to advance money from the Treasury to ward off panic only on
conditions amounting to the compulsory liquidation of the Bank of
New South Wales. Opinion rallied to its support. D'Arcy Wentworth
and W. Redfern successively presided, and though the charter was
declared invalid on the ground that Brisbane had had no right to
grant it, the first president J. T. Campbell returned to pilot
the Bank into re-organization as a joint-stock co-partnership, as
from 1 January 1828. Even so the damage to its credit seemed
likely to be mortal, and a government loan was accepted in the
following year on the drastic condition that the Bank be wound up
within twelve months.*** But a new cashier and secretary, John
Black, succeeded before the year was out in repaying both the
Government loan and declaring a dividend. It is said that in
doing so he depleted the cash in the Bank's chest to twenty-nine
pounds! Under Black's management, however, Macquarie's Bank was
to outlive the Bank of Australia and to outgrow in resources its
competitors of British origin. The temporary superiority of the
Bank of Australia by virtue of the favour and deposits of the
Government did not save it from collapse in 1843.**** The
co-partnery form of the senior bank was strengthened in 1830. At
the dawn of the gold boom it was incorporated afresh under a
local act, with an augmented capital.</p>

<p>Macquarie's way of providing and regulating the colonial
currency, as its determined survival shows, had taken early and
deep root. The chief danger of Australian banks thenceforward may
be traced to the multiplication of such regulators. The phase of
competition was perhaps inevitable, but the rule of sound money
like the rule of law calls for a single sovereignty.*****</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V<br>
<br>
An Autocrat in a Hurry</h3>
<br>
<p><small>BEING</small> of a generation whose fathers had seen
General Wade transform the Highlands after Mar's Rebellion and
which was still learning from Thomas Telford the arts of civil
engineering, Macquarie naturally set high store by the civilizing
power of externals. And posterity has agreed in honouring him
most for public buildings of a dignity which still charms the
eye, and roads which first made land travel practicable. We are
mainly perceptual beings. It is easy also to ascribe to these
changes the growth of a pride in the colony as a permanent home.
A generation was growing up in New South Wales which had known no
other.</p>
<p>His General Order issued after a first tour of the settlements
upbraided his subjects for their unsuitable houses, the absence
of barns and their miserable clothing&mdash;a lack of standards
bespeaking the despair of exiles. An early despatch asked for a
well-qualified architect and warned the Secretary of State of
heavy expenditure on the renovation of roads and bridges. But his
free drawing upon the Treasury soon roused concern at home. In
July 1811, Liverpool, in charge of the War and Colonial Office,
trusted "that no public buildings whatsoever have been commenced,
the construction of which was not indispensably required for the
Public Service". Yet a Secretary of State at Westminster, beset
by Treasury officials, and a Governor disposing in a virgin land
of the labour of many bondmen could scarcely agree as to what was
indispensable. "It is impossible", complained Liverpool, "to
point out what expenses have been unnecessarily incurred or in
the execution of what services retrenchments might have been
made." The bills drawn mounted up. In 1808 they totalled
£25,000, in 1809 £16,738&mdash;these were the years
of interregnum&mdash;£59,378 in 1810, £71,085 in
1811, and £30,869 in less than four months of 1812. All
this in time of war!</p>
<p>Long range fire from Downing Street was of course trained on
the outstanding public buildings. No public architect was sent;
that would have aided and abetted extravagance. By every mail
there came instead prohibitions of unnecessary spending,
comparisons, "not in your favour", with past governors.</p>
<p>Lachlan Macquarie was not the man to sing small. No governor
"here or in any other of His Majesty's Colonies", he claimed, had
been "more rigidly vigilant and watchful in the public
expenditure of money, provisions and stores belonging to, the
Crown". "Conscious, therefore, of my own Integrity and Rectitude
and of the Honourable Purity of my Motives" * he bade his
superiors remember the pass Sydney was in when he assumed office.
Less than a hundred bushels of grain were in store; two regiments
were on his hands for four months; the settlers' crops were swept
away by another Hawkesbury flood; new settlers on safer forest
land had to be victualled while clearing their farms; Phillip's
original barracks and quarters were collapsing because of green
and unsuitable timber. "Without vanity and with great truth", he
had already done in less than three years "more for the general
amelioration of the colony, the improvement of the manners,
morals, industry and religion of its inhabitants" than Hunter,
King and Bligh all together. By October 1814 he thought his
annual expenditure, then £75,000, likely to fall by a third
within two years, "if my plans of Reform and Economy shall be
Approved and Meet my own expectations". Surely this man was the
father of all Australian Treasurers!</p>
<p class="foot">[* Macquarie to Liverpool, 9 November 1812,
<i>H.R. of A</i>. series <small>I</small>, vol.
<small>VII</small>, p. 526.]</p>
<p>Many forces beyond his control combined to defeat his
expectations. At his side was Mrs Macquarie, a lady of refined
taste in buildings. As Whitehall sent no official architect, the
Governor found one amongst those sent as prisoners. Francis
Howard Greenway of London training had practised as an architect
in Bristol and Bath. But times of war are hard for architects,
and in 1812 he was "sent out" for fourteen years for concealing
effects in bankruptcy. Reaching Sydney in February 1814, he
submitted ambitious plans for a town hall and market house before
the year was out. Though not accepted, they evidently won
admiration, for in 1815 a more grandiose scheme included a bridge
over the harbour at Dawes Point. His services in detecting faulty
work in the foundations of the Rum Hospital led Macquarie to
accept Greenway's offer to "erect more and better buildings in
four years" than had been built since the colony's foundation. He
was made civil architect in 1816 and assistant to the Inspector
of Public Works, Captain John Gill, 46th Regiment. This
partnership, employing convicts on day labour, set a new standard
in colonial architecture which influenced private as well as
public building throughout Van Diemen's Land and New South
Wales.</p>
<p>Greenway's late Georgian work may still be admired in Hyde
Park Barracks and St James's Church, Sydney, in St Matthew's at
Windsor, perhaps in Burdekin House in Macquarie Street, in
"Subiaco" at Rydalmere and "Newington" on the Parramatta.** He
worked in a style "simple and stately, although of humble
execution". The secrets of his strength are scale and proportion.
He brought into the convict colonies a quality which dignified
the pleasant homesteads of the "Old Colonial" days, in their
shady gardens of great trees, both native and exotic, and
preserved for a time the tradition of an earlier elegance.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See Hardy Wilson's incomparable treasury of
drawings, <i>Old Colonial Architecture in New South Wales and
Tasmania</i>.]</p>
<p>But the flame of his genius flickered and was gone, his days
of public employment were sadly few. Macquarie emancipated him in
December 1817, and induced the Secretary of State to confirm,
temporarily at least, his appointment as civil architect. But
expenditure was rising again, to the scandal of Whitehall.
Scapegoats were being sought, especially among the emancipists
Macquarie had befriended. Plans and work for a new church of
cathedral proportions, where Sydney Town Hall now stands, were
vetoed in 1819 by Commissioner Bigge. He thought Greenway slack
and "indulgent", given to a love of ornamentation. So his plans
for a water supply to town and port, and for the City which was
to be, passed into limbo. In 1821 the most talented and
far-sighted of Macquarie's servants went back to private practice
and obscurity.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** See article on F. H. Greenway in
<i>Australian Encyclopaedia</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p.
581.]</p>
<p>The renewed activity in public works rose, however, out of
more than personal influences. A way had been found over the Blue
Mountains. Great fertile plains and teeming rivers were there.
And a big influx of convicts came out after the peace with France
and the onset of postwar depression at home.</p>
<p>Before 1813 explorers looked for a way inland up the
river-valleys such as the Grose and the Warragamba. With possibly
one exception they had been baffled by gorges "of the most barren
and forbidding aspect", where even the crows seemed to have lost
their way. Perhaps the taciturn George Caley had caught a glimpse
"of better country farther out"&mdash;the lure ever since to
squatters gambling with drought. But Caley was stopped in 1804 by
mutiny when within "cooee" of success.* It was left to Gregory
Blaxland to hit upon the plan of working along the crests of the
confused ridges. He was a substantial grazier whose pastures
drought had scorched. In May 1813, with Lawson, a surveyor, and
D'Arcy Wentworth's son, William Charles, aged 22,** he hacked and
tore a way through undergrowth and over rises to Mount Blaxland,
531 miles west of the Nepean. They turned there, battered and
sick, but triumphant. They had looked West over open grass lands
boundless in extent. Winter broke; when it was over, Macquarie
sent G. W. Evans, his assistant-surveyor, with four convict
servants and a guide from Blaxland's party, to test the hopes
aroused. Early in the new year (1814) they returned, having
traversed a hundred miles of rolling grassy plains, abounding in
game, with rivers full of strange but excellent fish, "vast areas
of grazing country not divided by barren spaces as on the east
side of the mountains", "soil exceeding rich" growing the finest
grass and herbs, "hills green to the tops and country like a park
and grounds laid out".*** A cart-road thither, said Evans, could
be made in three months by fifty labourers.</p>

<p>Could a Governor hesitate at such a prospect? In July Captain
Cox began making the road. "The Expence of constructing it",
Macquarie explained to Bathurst, "will be very trifling to
Government, the Men Employed in it being Convicts who Volunteered
their Services on Condition of receiving Emancipation for their
Extra labour. This is the only Remuneration they receive except
their Rations".* In sanctioning a road even to these attractive
Bathurst Plains there was need of explanatory caution. He had
already found the Colonial Office very stiff in its criticisms of
roads and bridges. "Making Permanent Roads and Bridges is one of
the first steps towards Improving a New Country", wrote the
sententious Governor in justifying a turnpike road to the
Hawkesbury. Liverpool agreed, but questioned whether the British
taxpayer should be the paymaster. "Permanent roads and bridges",
it seemed to him, "will be the off-spring rather than the cause
of internal prosperity"&mdash;a doctrine logical enough in an old
country. But Macquarie was facing the needs of a country still to
be occupied and notably lacking natural means of access such as
navigable rivers. "Permanent roads through this Wide Extended
Colony", he persisted even in 1812, "cannot be Constructed at the
entire Expence of the Inhabitants for many Years to Come, and
they imagine they have a right to expect that at least a part of
the Colonial Revenue, particularly that part of it Collected on
the Very Spirits of which they drink such Quantities, ought to be
laid out and Appropriated to the Construction of Permanent Roads
and Bridges, Streets and Wharves, Wherever these are essentially
necessary." **</p>

<p>He had already constructed turnpike roads over the coastal
plain to the Nepean River and to Liverpool. The tactful name of
the latter destination did not, indeed, persuade its eponym that
there was a difference between colonial and other revenues of the
Crown. If the spirit-duties were spent on roads, they could not
be used to lessen the burden of sending and, maintaining the
convicts. He begged the question by arguing that if the free
settlers could not pay for the roads, this proved that the colony
was not advanced enough to need them.***</p>

<p>When, however, news of Bathurst Plains confirmed Macquarie's
every hope for the colony's future, he put aside the plea that
Britain could not afford roads into this wonderland. A new
Secretary of State had sanctioned the other turnpike roads on the
ground that tolls would recoup the expense, but had boggled at
transmontane roads "while His Majesty's Treasury at home is
subjected to an Expence of from Seventy Thousand to One Hundred
Thousand Pounds per Annum for the Support of the Colony".* The
demurrer came too late; it crossed a despatch in which Macquarie
announced his new programme of buildings and roads, asked leave
to build a new church, large-scale convict barracks and a better
court-house. After that he would reduce the gangs of artificers
and labourers.</p>

<p>The works already begun Bathurst allowed, "as they are to be
defrayed from the Colonial Funds". The court-house he vetoed; the
church and barracks were to be built if the colonial revenue
would stand the charge. But this, with a general promise to
second improvements that took the form of schools and
glebe-houses, threw the leash from the straining ambitions of
Greenway and his vice-regal patrons. "Availing myself of the
discretionary power Your Lordship has been kindly pleased to
grant Me of erecting such Public Buildings as Can Conveniently be
paid for from the Colonial Revenue",** Macquarie let contracts
for churches at Sydney, Windsor and Liverpool, set about building
by convict gangs a new Factory for female convicts at Parramatta,
glebe houses at Liverpool, Parramatta and Castlereagh, and
planned a new Civil Court House.</p>

<p>How could ministers at Whitehall control such a man? Could
such ambitious plans possibly be sound? The colony was certainly
growing: 16,493 male convicts were sent out between 1810 and
1820, 11,250 of whom embarked in the last four years. Colonial
revenues from import and port duties had increased from
£10,000 in 1811 to £25,884 in 1820. But this
obstinate builder's calls on them, amounting to £3,005 in
1811, £6,920 in 1815, £16,486 in 1819, had increased
also. More floods along the Hawkesbury in 1816, 1817 and 1819 had
thrown back many assigned servants upon government rations.
Macquarie's bills drawn on the Treasury for rations and stores
and its own expenses in fitting out convict transports had
mounted to a total of £227,000 in 1814, and almost
£240,000 in 1817. Rebukes had been met by protestations of
future amendment, regularly falsified by the event. A grudging
approval had been twisted into a programme of extravagance.</p>
<p>Most disquieting was another aspect of Macquarie's rule, his
preference for emancipists, and the bad relations with the
respectable settlers and officials to which that preference had
given rise. Was the man a despot basing his power on mob-favour?
His lineage and career bespoke an aristocrat of high and
dependable character. Yet every vessel out of Port Jackson
brought rumours and, after 1815, official word of discord in high
places. Could public order in New South Wales survive
recrimination between the Governor and the judges? By what idea
of the colony's future could Colonel Macquarie be inspired or
possessed?</p>
<p>In January 1819, to set such doubts at rest, the Secretary of
State commissioned John Thomas Bigge, chief justice of Trinidad,
to ascertain "how far in its present improved and increasing
State" the colony was "susceptible of being made adequate to the
Objects of its original institution". In Whitehall's view New
South Wales was still a prison, and transportation thither a
punishment to deter men and women in Britain from crime. "The
Settlements in New Holland must clearly be considered as
Receptacles for Offenders. . . . So long as they continue
destined to these purposes by the Legislature of the Country"
(i.e. of Great Britain and Ireland), "their growth as Colonies
must be a Secondary Consideration, and the leading Duty of those
to whom their Administration is entrusted will be to keep up in
them such a system of just discipline as may render
transportation an Object of serious Apprehension".* It seems to
have been all this in the days of the naval governors. As
evidence that transportation to New South Wales under that iron
discipline had answered "every end of punishment", Bathurst
quoted "instances on record in which convicts have expressed
their desire that the sentence of transportation might be
commuted even for the utmost Rigour of the Law". Such action was
intelligible in any who had heard of the horrors of the Second
and Third Fleets, the voyage out being thought the worse half of
the punishment. But speculation by contractors in the lives of
the convicts in transit had been checked by the appointment to
each transport of at least one naval surgeon, with powers which
even the captain overrode at his peril.** In New Holland also the
scene was changed, and transportation had lost its terrors.
"Numerous applications are made by those who are sentenced to
imprisonment for minor transgressions that they may be allowed to
participate in the Punishment to which the greatest offenders are
condemned." This was outrageous, thought Whitehall.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Bathurst to J. T. Bigge, 6 January 1819,
<i>H.R. of A</i>. series <small>I</small>, vol. <small>X</small>,
p. 4.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** An account of the conditions aboard convict
transports under these more humane conditions may be read in
<i>The Frew Papers</i> (Mitchell Library), the vessel on which
the Frews reached South Australia having encountered an
outward-bound transport near the Cape.]</p>
<p>"The great End of Punishment is the Prevention of Crime",
wrote Bathurst. "If, by ill-considered Compassion for Convicts,
or from what might under other circumstances be considered a
laudable desire to lessen their sufferings, their Situation in
New South Wales be divested of all Salutary Terror,
Transportation cannot operate as an effectual example on the
Community at large, as a proper punishment for those Crimes
against the commission of which His Majesty's Subjects have a
right to claim protection". Thus Bigge's commission virtually
dictated the condemnation of Macquarie's active employment of
convicts on public works for an emancipists' Utopia where, when
they had expiated their crimes, they should enjoy a new Britain
under blue skies.</p>
<p>Macquarie's emancipist leanings, it may be argued, were a
result of the party leadership which came to him from Bligh. When
on his twelfth day of office he raised to the magistracy one
Andrew Thompson, leading settler on the Hawkesbury, he was
rewarding the man and the district for loyalty to Bligh and
rebuking the usurpers the more pointedly by disregarding
Thompson's ex-convict status. Colonel Foveaux had warned
Macquarie against the Revd. Samuel Marsden, and when the chaplain
attacked Thompson's appointment his criticisms served only to
arouse the despot in Macquarie. He adopted as a deliberate policy
the very elevation of emancipists at which Marsden cavilled.
Possibly the Scots laird enjoyed out-Christianing the Anglican
parson.* In August 1810, Simeon Lord, a wealthy Sydney trader,
but an ignorant and low-lived ex-convict, was also raised to the
bench, and Macquarie tried to associate both Thompson and Lord
with Marsden, the senior colonial chaplain, as trustees of the
public roads. Marsden would not act with them, giving as his
reason their notoriously bad characters.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Cf. <i>H.R. of A</i>. series <small>I</small>,
vol. <small>IX</small>, p. 499, where Macquarie in submitting a
list of secret opponents places Marsden at the head of "this List
of Malcontents".]</p>
<p>Fate was not kind to Macquarie, and his friends. Thompson died
within nine months of his elevation, leaving to his patron a
large share of a fortune based on trade in spirits. The legacy
was accepted by Macquarie as proof of the giver's good will, but
it became a target for gibes. Lord, subjected to insults in open
court,** was persuaded by Bigge and Macquarie, at Governor
Brisbane's coming, to retire from a position he had neither
strengthened nor adorned. Redfern, a naval surgeon transported
for being an accessory to the mutiny at the Nore, was promoted by
Macquarie in the teeth of Bigge's advice and Bathurst's
disapproval. At the accession of George IV Macquarie was flatly
ordered to omit his name from the new commission of the
peace.</p>
<p class="foot">[** "You are a great man now, Mr Lord", cried a
woman expiree, "but you came into the colony in the same
situation as myself."]</p>
<p>Frowns from high places and social boycotts of his "pets" in
Sydney * merely provoked in the Governor a fierce antagonism to
colonists who had not been prisoners. From thinking ex-convicts
the most useful members of the community, he passed in November
1812 to asking that "the Free Settlers sent out from England may
be limited to as small a number as possible. . . . These Free
Settlers are the most discontented Persons in the Colony".** This
may have been true, and may also have been to the discredit of a
majority of them, sent out as ne'er-do-wells on family sentences
of "conditional remittance" and always clamouring for government
grants and donations. But discontent may have been justified in
those who were pioneer stock-raisers despite Macquarie's
disfavour.*** They acquired no merit in his eyes by success.
Blind like his predecessor to the importance of any rural pursuit
but tilling the soil, he sneered at graziers who gained "a very
large Fortune without any trouble to themselves, the laborious
parts of Husbandry being entirely left to the poor Emancipated
Convicts or free persons of Inferior Origin". He repeatedly
accused of laziness John and Gregory Blaxland, pioneers of the
cattle industry.**** In the colony the Governor acknowledged
Gregory Blaxland's merit as the conqueror of the mountain
barrier. In his reports to England he suppressed that merit.</p>

Macquarie's full knowledge, planned and carried to the point of
success the crossing of the mountains, Macquarie wrote of them as
"having never benefitted the Colony since their arrival in it now
nearly nine years ago".]</p>
<p>In advocating the concession of trial by jury of the people,
another plank from the pro-Bligh party's platform, Macquarie gave
his emancipist principles free rein. Bathurst had doubts whether
the rule of trying men by their peers could be applied to a
society of such "peculiar constitution". "Would that principle be
fairly acted upon, if free settlers were to sit in judgment on
convicts?. . . Would it be prudent to allow convicts to act as
jurymen? . . . Would not their exclusion be considered an
invidious mark . . . at variance with the Great Principle upon
which the institution is founded?" The Governor. agreed that only
the free should be eligible but laboured to put aside all
distinction between free and freed. "Once a Convict had become a
Free Man, either by Servitude, Free Pardon or Emancipation, he
should in All Respects be Considered on a footing with every
other Man in the Colony, according to his Rank in Life and
Character." The rub was in this last clause. The emancipists by
whose advancement Macquarie chose to prove the vigour of his
faith only demonstrated that punishment as then practised had
certainly not exalted the characters of the most eminent
ex-convicts. This was fatal to the success of his generous
policy. As Bigge complained, Macquarie was trying not to restore
to such emancipists their rank in life but greatly to raise it.
Like many despots he thought to press folk into the designs he
premeditated. Public buildings are things on which, as on the
Perth Town Hall (W.A.), the broad arrow may be a pleasant
historical decoration. But human beings are otherwise
constituted.</p>
<p>Macquarie, his biographer thinks, "had neither the education
nor the natural good taste to distinguish one man from another in
the ranks below him". Too impatient to await the slow process by
which each free generation appraises its leaders and culls its
recruits for this and that calling, he thought he could build a
community, like a barracks or a church with convicts and
emancipists only. But it was a destructive party spleen which
inspired such notions and they took a fatal hold on the inferior
mentality of many around him. Should his policy be dictated,
Macquarie asked ministers at home, by the wishes of those who
came free to the colony, or should he "so construct it as to hold
out the greatest possible rewards to the Convicts for Reformation
of Manners by Considering Them, when this is the Case, in every
way entitled to the Rights and Privileges of a Citizen who has
never come under the Sentence of Transportation"? * He did not
stay for an answer, but took it as a foregone conclusion and,
though the fame of the wool pastures was already growing, his
measures reduced free immigration to a mere trickle during the
later years of his term of office. "In Coming to New South Wales
(Free Settlers) should consider that they are coming to a Convict
Country, and if they are too proud or too delicate in their
feelings to associate with the Population of the Country, they
should consider it in time and bend their Course to some other
Country in which their Prejudices in this Respect would meet with
no Opposition".** Seven-eighths of the men-convicts available
were employed on public works, leaving few to be assigned to the
settlers. When in 1817 "a low Rabble", in the vice-regal phrase,
signed a memorial to the Commons against his arbitrary acts, they
found themselves shut out from land grants and the customary
indulgences of stock and labour, for daring "to asperse my
personal honour and Government".***</p>

<p>Ministers sought by light hints to turn this hard-mouthed steed, but
their touches were taken by him for a shaking of the reins in
encouragement. Macquarie read Bathurst's warnings against the effects of
a forcing policy in favour of emancipists as a full endorsement of his
doings. "Some illiberal Men in this Country Would destine a fellow
Creature who has once deflected from the Path of Virtue, to an Eternal
Badge of Infamy. . . . I am happy in feeling a Spirit of Charity in Me
which shall ever Me despise Such Unjust and illiberal Sentiments".*</p>

<p>Doubts grew. What would be the effect of such Charity on the
convicts? It indited bitter despatches against judges, clergy and
free-settlers. It built "good and comfortable accommodation" to
house 1200 male prisoners. It made the saying proverbial that the
surest way to vice-regal favour was having worn the badge of
conviction for felony. Was it practicable to "hold out the
greatest possible rewards for Reformation of Manners" without
inviting clever rogues to seek them?</p>
<p>Jeffery Hart Bent, when Judge-Advocate, had cut Macquarie to
the quick by contending that the Governor's doings were against
the wishes of His Majesty's Government; but Downing Street
managed its puppet despot on very slack strings. A mild reproof
of extravagance drew from him in December 1817 a letter of
resignation. Bathurst's reassurances, inviting its withdrawal,
although the despatch containing them reached Sydney, were
somehow kept from the Governor. He fretted under what he thought
the unacknowledged suspension of his resignation.** Bigge's
arrival in September 1819 limited his policies by a sort of
consular veto. Chafing under the Commissioner's constant
criticisms, he asked again to be relieved. Yet at the end he
quitted his realm with reluctance. After his successor, Sir
Thomas Brisbane, had come in November 1821, Macquarie went on
progress through the scattered settlements.</p>

<p>Like James I he had "felt himself as an immense brood-fowl set
over this land, and would so fain gather it all under his wings".
"Under the Divine protection", he told the Hawkesbury farmers,
"we have been advancing towards a degree of civilization and
comfort which can only render life one of enjoyment to those who
have been accustomed from early habits to the manifold blessings
extending to the whole population in the Mother Country". The
oft-quoted passage in the apologia for his work which he wrote
after his return to Britain still stirs Australians to sympathy
with a great-hearted lover of the infant colony.*** "I found the
Colony barely emerging from infantile imbecility, and suffering
from various privations and disabilities; the Country
impenetrable beyond 40 miles from Sydney; Agriculture in a yet
languishing state; commerce in its early dawn; Revenue
unknown;**** threatened by famine; distracted by faction; the
public buildings in a state of dilapidation and mouldering to
decay; the few Roads and Bridges, formerly constructed, rendered
almost impassable; the population in general depressed by
poverty; no public credit nor private confidence; the morals of
the great mass of the population in the lowest state of
debasement, and religious worship almost totally neglected. . . .
I left it, in February last, reaping incalculable advantages from
my extensive and important discoveries in all directions,
including the supposed insurmountable barrier called the Blue
Mountains, to the westward of which are situated the fertile
plains of Bathurst, and in all respects enjoying a state of
private comfort and public prosperity, which I trust will at
least equal the expectation of His Majesty's Government. This
change may indeed be ascribed in part to the natural operation of
time and events on individual enterprize. How far it may be
attributed to measures originating with myself and my zeal and
judgment in giving effect to my instructions, I humbly submit to
His Majesty and his Ministers."</p>

<p>These claims reveal more than the egotism of the despot,
swallowing up all credit for the activities of his subjects. By
their emphasis on the comforts of civilization and by the
slightness of the references to colonial flocks and herds, they
suggest that Macquarie's mind stuck in the bark of externals, and
missed the inner meaning of efforts to make New South Wales a
colony of self-providing and permanent homes.</p>
<p>The social and economic weaknesses of the convicts were not to
be exorcised by a spirit of charity which gave them comfortable
employment on public works. These measures concentrated more than
half the population of the colony in Sydney and subsidised
unemployment there as early as 1817.* Convicts and emancipists
were necessarily a wasting as well as a weak foundation. In
October 1821 they numbered 19,126 adults out of a total of 29,783
inhabitants, but the disproportion of the sexes meant that most
could know no family life. There were 15,939 convict men and only
3187 women. Of their children, who numbered 7224, many turned
away from Macquarie's design of copying the comforts of
Britain.** They with the free settlers&mdash;1489 adults and 1884
children&mdash;were the active elements in the advance over the
inland plains which followed the collapse of his building boom.
When Brisbane discontinued public works, the "old hands" passed
into the service of the squatters, as hut-keepers and
shepherds.*** The white-trash of Virginia and the Carolinas
perished as Lee's incomparable infantry. In a nobler cause the
ex-convicts died as sentries beside the peaceful productive sheep
who won Australia for the white men.</p>

<p>Macquarie had shown good sense and resolution in his reform of
the currency, but his vacillation about public agriculture
suggests that a laird's paternalism prevented his seeing the
economic futility of convict labour in public employ.**** His
public buildings, for all their innocent charm to-day, were laxly
supervised and so continued the enervating precedent of reliance
on government. He was, maybe, the second founder of Sydney, but
not of Australia. By his vendetta against free settlers he roused
the first whisperings of a hostility towards immigrants which
still comes ill in a spacious land from the beneficiaries of John
McArthur, Caroline Chisholm and William Farrer. And how could his
or any other Bank discharge to the best advantage its function of
entrusting the material resources of the community to those most
capable of directing their increase if the Governor set his face
against the free activity of the free? The days of paternalism
were over.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br>
<br>
John Bull's Greater Woolsack</h3>
<br>
<p><small>IN</small> the eighteen-twenties, the figures in the
foreground of the Australian scene suddenly shrink into
insignificance. Governors still rule with little ease the
turbulent Sydney populace. Officials still push their friends'
interests, or plan, the better training of the unspoilt
generation. Traders still serve their own turn. But a curtain has
been raised. These petty folk and their coastal land grants,
totalling, since the colony's foundation, less than 325,000
acres, are dwarfed by the mighty drama of free settlement inland.
More than Blaxland's cattle have escaped from vice-regal
restriction. John McArthur, who had traded, ruled, intrigued and
made money for a quarter of a century at Parramatta, at Sydney
and at Westminster, had all along insisted on wasting his
substance in pursuit of a dream that the colony would some day
export fine wool. Suddenly men realize that he is
right&mdash;that fine wool is no dream but the masterstroke of a
pragmatical genius.</p>
<p>His wool-gathering originated in a deduction he made in 1794
from the results of putting a young Irish ram with some Bengal
ewes. "By crossing the two breeds I had the satisfaction", he
told Bigge in 1820, "to see the lambs of the Indian ewes bear a
mingled fleece of hair and wool. This circumstance originated the
idea of producing fine wool in New South Wales".* The Bengal
sheep produced a covering which when shorn in early summer for
the animal's comfort went as a matter of course to the rubbish
tip. The Irish sheep's wool was little better. At a time of high
values it was worth only 9<i>d</i>. a pound at home. But the
mingled hair and wool on the lambs of this cross suggested to
McArthur that if he used the right sheep he might breed wool
worth shillings a pound. This, if grown on free or cheap land,
would bear the light expense of convict labour, and would cost
little freight as back-loading on returning transports, which, at
that time, went empty to China to load cargoes of tea.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See generally S. Macarthur-Onslow, <i>Early
Records of the Macarthurs of Camden</i>, chapters <small>III, IV,
IX</small>, and T. A. Coghlan, <i>Labour and Industry in
Australia</i>, part <small>I</small>, chapter
<small>VII</small>.]</p>
<p>The fate of 44 sheep brought by the First Fleet was not
encouraging. They had been worried by dingoes and stolen by
convicts till but one remained. But "Elizabeth Farm" at
Parramatta was twelve miles from Sydney and partly guarded by
water. Through Captain Waterhouse of the 'Reliance', McArthur
obtained in 1797 the sheep he wanted&mdash;four or five Merino
ewes and three Merino rams from the flock of one Colonel Gordon,
a Scot in the Dutch service at the Cape. This nucleus of the
first Australian Merino stud was supplemented in 1805 by five
rams and one ewe from the Royal Stud at Kew.</p>
<p>In buying these, McArthur, sent home under arrest by Governor
King, had become involved in a feud with Sir Joseph Banks which
almost wrecked his plans. The two men were seeking independently
some export which would give the colony a means of self-support.
Banks, when urging in 1798 that Mungo Park, the African explorer,
should be sent to solve the riddle of the interior, held it to be
inconceivable "that such a country, situate in a most fruitful
climate, should not produce some native raw material of
importance to a manufacturing country as England is". If found,
such a material might repay the cost of establishing and
maintaining the colony.** McArthur, in search of influential
patrons for his project, took much trouble with a collection of
African natural history specimens for Sir Joseph which was
carried on from St Helena by the East Indiaman on which he
reached England. His pains over the safe delivery of the cases
earned only a dry acknowledgement from Banks, the colony's chief
advocate and friend at court.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Sir Joseph Banks to Under-Secretary King, 15
May 1798.]</p>
<p>McArthur found other aid. In July 1803 the clothing interest
was promoting a bill in Parliament to relieve their industry from
the restrictions imposed by the Elizabethan Statute of
Artificers. In the name of the fashionable doctrine of <i>laissez
faire</i>, they sought the same freedom as obtained in the cotton
manufacture. They had been met, however, by the formidable
argument that expansion of employment in their craft was
impossible because of a notorious dearth of the raw material.*
Out of the blue came Captain McArthur with his samples of wool
grown on Spanish sheep at the Antipodes, telling of wide empty
pastures from which they might expect the coming of quantities
beside which Spain's nine million pounds would seem a mere
bagful. He wrote, in October 1805, of "tracts of land adapted for
pastures so boundless that no assignable limits can be set to the
number of fine-woolled sheep which can be raised . . . with
little other expense than the wages and food of the
shepherds".</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Memorial to Treasury from Woollen
Manufacturers, quoted in <i>Macarthur Records</i>, p. 67. Also
Coghlan, <i>op. cit</i>. p. 101.]</p>
<p>Sir Joseph Banks, whom the Office of Trade consulted as
President of the Royal Society and an explorer of the scene,
disparaged McArthur's project. "I have seen fleeces imported from
New South Wales the quality of which was equal to Spanish wools
of the second or third rate piles, but I have not seen any equal
to the best piles of old Spain. . . . I have never heard of any
luxuriant pastures of sheep till I read of them in Captain
Macarthur's statement, nor did I ever see such when in that
country." What could be more authoritative? "I have my fears", he
continued, "that it will be found on enquiry that sheep do not
prosper well there, unless in lands that have been cleared and
manured with some labour and expense. . . . The freight of wool
from Spain to England costs from 1<i>d</i>. to 1½<i>d</i>.
a pound. . . . What the freight of a ton of wool from New South
Wales will be I am not able to ascertain, but it will certainly
add very materially to its actual price when brought to market."
Sir Joseph advised against encouraging McArthur in "a mere
theoretical speculation".</p>
<p>Such advice from one whose first-hand knowledge of the land in
question had been gained nearly thirty years before in the swamps
around Botany Bay would have aroused a less pugnacious man than
John McArthur. He met it first by a letter from Captain
Waterhouse who had also run sheep in the colony. "The Universal
mode of feeding Sheep in that Country", Waterhouse reported,**
"has been by driving them into the Woods, on the Natural
Pasturage. When I left the Colony there was not artificial grass
sufficient to feed a Lamb a week. . . . My Flock were driven into
the Woods after the Dew was off the Grass, driven back for the
Man to get his dinner, and then taken out again until the close
of the Evening, when they remained in the Yard for the Night. . .
. When brought home earlier than usual, and finding fault with
the Shepherd for it, he said that they were so soon full that
they had lain down for hours." As to freight, McArthur called
before the Committee one John Princep, a London merchant, who
quoted a freight of £16 per ton on wool as back-loading in
time of war, and £8 per ton in time of peace. So fortified
against Banks, the Committee recommended a grant of lands to
McArthur, subject to resumption with compensation if the land
were wanted for cultivation. It supported, too, McArthur's idea
that the Governor should be instructed to feed the convicts on
mutton rather than salt meat, and to pay a premium on mutton from
fine-woolled sheep.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The letter and McArthur's covering memorial
to the Committee of Trade and Plantations are reprinted in the
<i>Macarthur Records</i>, pp. 78 <i>seq</i>.]</p>
<p>McArthur sought a grant of ten thousand acres around Mount
Taurus in the Cowpastures, well beyond the lands under tillage.
Lord Camden, then in charge of colonial affairs, was ready to
make it, and McArthur sold his commission in the New South Wales
Corps in order to devote fuller attention to his Merino flocks.
For a time. Banks himself joined in talk of a company which
should be granted a million acres and be managed by McArthur.***
In August, however, there was a sale of Spanish Merinos from the
Royal Stud at Kew, where the antagonism between McArthur and
Banks flared afresh. The sheep were the progeny of Merinos
presented to the King in 1791 by a Spanish Marchioness. They
afforded McArthur the chance of adding to his Cape Merinos
another strain. Gordon's Merinos were of the Escurial type,****
while those of the Royal flock were Negretti. Which was superior
is largely a question of fashion. The prestige of the Royal flock
no doubt favoured the Negretti, but in 1830 James McArthur,
John's son, reported after a visit to Saxony that "with their
ample folds of skin and large dewlaps" they were completely out
of favour there.*****</p>
<p class="foot">[*** It was to have a capital of £10,000
and to pay for the manager's services by allowing him all the
mutton. The plan might well have tempted the manager to be
unfaithful to the plan of breeding first of all for wool. It
remained a mere theoretical speculation.]</p>

the Royal Society of New South Wales, August 1928.]</p>
<p class="foot">[***** See <i>Macarthur Records</i>, p. 439.]</p>
<p>The sheep offered at Kew were culls and in poor condition, but
McArthur bid with determination and secured more than his share.
The highest price he paid was twenty-seven guineas for a
four-tooth ram, with fleece of 7 lb. 2 oz. At the sale he met
Banks who "at last when his aid was needless evinced a strong
desire to promote and patronize the introduction of the merino
sheep into Australia".* McArthur, resenting a patronage
ill-distinguished from tuft-hunting, forgot the rule "Agree with
thine enemy quickly" and offered the coldest front to the older
man's advances. The sheep and their proud owner were ready for
embarkation on the 'Argo' ** when a paragraph in the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i> reminded the purchaser of an old statute forbidding
the export of English sheep on pain of forfeiture, fine and
branding. Repairing hot-foot to Downing Street, McArthur met
Banks leaving Lord Camden's office. The legal obstacle was evaded
by a special Treasury permit, but McArthur had to content himself
with a grant of five thousand acres at the chosen spot, to be
supplemented by a similar area when his hopes of increase should
have been realized.</p>
<p class="foot">[* From James Macarthur's notes written in 1859
for Sir Roger Therry's use in writing his <i>Reminiscences of
N.S.W. and Victoria</i>, and quoted in <i>Macarthur Records</i>,
p. 99.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** The ship which McArthur had purchased and
adorned with the figurehead of a golden fleece.]</p>
<p>He returned triumphant on the main issue, bringing back five
rams and a ewe from the Kew purchase, expert wool-sorters, two
new settlers, vines and olive trees. After a little demur at
disturbing the sacred grove of the wild cattle, Governor King did
Lord Camden's bidding, and for three troubled years McArthur
watched his flocks increase at Parramatta and at Camden Park, his
new estate in the Cowpastures.</p>
<p>That increase failed, however, to fulfil the hopes he had held
out to the clothing interest. Among other sheep-breeders in the
colony it excited scorn for the puny Merinos. Bengal sheep always
bred twice a year. Cape ordinaries often did so. McArthur had
based his reckoning of increase on the growth of the colony's
total flock from 1531 in 1796 to 6737 in 1801. Assuming that on
protected pasture his flock would double in two and a half years,
he had predicted a production comparable within twenty-five years
with that of Spain. But he had reckoned without his sheep. At his
return he found that the crossing of Merino rams with crossbred
and comeback ewes gave sheep of weaker constitution.*** The
coastal lands, we know now, are not favourable to Merinos. They
are more at home on the drier Western slopes.**** But the fading
out of the hybrid vigour set colonial opinion against the whole
project of breeding for wool alone. McArthur did not budge from
his conviction that the colony must find a staple: the British
taxpayer would not always foot the bills for rations, roads and
public buildings. The Revd. Samuel Marsden and others bred sheep
for immediate returns of mutton as well as wool. They found the
type hard to fix. But as McArthur's sheep became more deeply
imbued with Merino blood they regained constitution. With Cox of
Windsor and a chosen few he made the future of fine wool safe by
sticking to pure Merino, and by standing ready to supply Merino
rams for all who would breed first for wool, and for fine
wool.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** See Memo. by John McArthur, in <i>Macarthur
Records</i>, p. 72. "As the cross with the Merino blood advanced
the young sheep became delicate and sickly and the Ewes seldom
lived to rear more than three Lambs&mdash;often not more than
one, and the Lambs were as tender as their Mothers."]</p>

<p>Nothing daunted him. He remained in exile from 1809 to 1817
rather than purchase immunity from arrest by an apology for the
part he had taken in deposing Bligh. His wife Elizabeth trained
his sons and watched the flocks during his absence. When he
returned in 1817 to the colony he had roughly served, even the
judges protested against a move by Macquarie to raise him to the
magistracy. He retorted with energy upon their petty souls but
his later letters grew low-spirited under the torments of gout.
They still witness, none the less, to his old tenacity on the
main issue. "My feeble attempt to introduce Merino sheep", he
told an absentee neighbour in 1818, "still creeps on almost
unheeded and altogether unassisted. Few settlers can be induced
to take the trouble requisite to improve their flocks, or to
subtract a few guineas from their usual expenditure&mdash;tea and
rum&mdash;to purchase Spanish rams." * "By storing the Country
with Fine-Woolled Sheep"&mdash;he is here coaching in colonial
economy his son John, then at the Inns of Court&mdash;"a most
valuable export would be obtained, the returns of which would
increase the demand for labour and gradually prepare the
colonists to depend on their own exertions and in time enable
them altogether to provide for their own expenditure." **</p>

<p>The routine work was within the competence even of convicts.
The main thing was that stockowners should grasp the need of
purity in the breed. It was a sure sign that the old man's fad
was at last being understood when about 1820 Sydney speculators
began to sell as "Pure Merinos" coarse-woolled sheep showing a
trace of that blood. Finding Bigge receptive to his ideas,
McArthur offered to make the true breed accessible to all by
selling to government all the rams they would take for a price in
land valued at 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. an acre. He wanted elbow
room, some 50,000 acres. Only strict supervision in enclosed
ground, had kept his stud pure. When he shifted it out to Camden
Park he would need a bigger scene for his main flock. He offered
to pay in fine-woolled rams for "a certain proportion of such
lands a Government now bestows gratis and with no other object
than the production of corn and cattle, for which they are
obliged, to pay by Bills on the English Treasury".</p>
<p>While only the coastal plain was known, horned cattle had
multiplied almost as fast as McArthur had expected of his sheep,
12,442 head of cattle in 1810 becoming 102,939 in 1820. After
1813, however, the sheep began to countenance the First
Flockmaster's hopes. From 50,000 in that year they multiplied to
290,000 in 1825. Between 1814 and 1820, from 60,000 to 90,000
pounds of wool were exported annually, forming as yet but a tiny
fraction of the imports from all sources into Britain. In 1821
New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land exported between them
175,433 pounds of fine wool. In 1822 a gold medal was awarded to
John McArthur "for importing into Great Britain wool the produce
of his flocks equal to the finest Saxony". This meant that
Australian wool could reach a standard well above that of the
best piles of Old Spain". In 1827 he obtained 196<i>d</i>. a
pound for a bale bearing the famous "I.McA." brand, a record
price that, is still unbeaten.* In 1831 New South Wales sent
1,134,134 pounds and Van Diemen's Land 1,359,203 pounds. The
1,100,000 sheep in New South Wales in 1832 had by 1838 become
2,750,000. By 1849 there were 13,159,000 sheep in the mother
colony, 6,000,000 of them being in the Port Phillip District.
Within less than three decades a mighty expansion in the despised
convict settlements of New Holland "had changed the balance of
forces in the wool-world and had made Australia's greatest
contribution to the strength of the Empire".**</p>

<p>John McArthur, well-loved and devotedly followed by his own
family until his death in 1834, was indeed the happy warrior who
had "wrought upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought". But
age, gout and the fierce scorn of a superior mind for
time-servers made him a poor apostle of an idea which had by this
time won some trial in many another temperate country.*** His
contemporaries obstinately refused to retract their mockery of
his "pure Merinos". "Many do not like to apply to me because they
have always scoffed at the project from its commencement. . . .
Many will not move unless in a string. . . . At present (1820)
there are not ten sheep-breeders pursuing any measure for the
improvement of Wool and not more than six of them that pursue
judicious ones." **** He even sought to push upon government,
through its grants of stock to new settlers, the work for which
his powers of persuasion fell short. "I wish to God", he communed
with young John, "Government could be induced to adopt some plan
of supplying settlers with Merino Rams of undoubted purity of
blood at a moderate price. . . . I care not what price Government
take them at: let them fix it themselves and let me have the
honour and satisfaction of seeing the universal spread of what I
have so long and so anxiously laboured to establish, and I shall
be satisfied." Suddenly, in the early 'twenties the tide of
opinion turned in Britain. There was a rush for. Australian land
and Saxon Merinos with which to furnish unlimited and superior
raw materials for the woollen and worsted industries. Army
officers, tenant-farmers, younger sons of the middle class came
out to compete in taking up "runs" with "currency lads",
surveyors and shepherds-turned-graziers.</p>

<p class="foot">[**** <i>Macarthur Records</i>, p. 332.]</p>
<p>The way to the unlimited expansion of colonial wool supplies
had been opened at home only after a sharp clash of protectionist
and free-trade opinion. British flock-masters had long been
dismayed by "the awful fact that this country which once boasted
of its native wool as the staple commodity . . . has now become
wholly dependent on a supply of foreign wool for its clothing
manufacture".* This had come about as an indirect result of the
rising demand for mutton and the success of Bakewell and his
pupils in breeding sheep to supply it. From home flocks whose
masters were indifferent to their needs the woollen manufacturers
had turned for fine wool to Spain and the Continent. Under Pitt's
liberal policy, wool had come in free of duty from 1784 to 1802.
Thereafter a revenue duty had been slowly raised from 5<i>s</i>.
3<i>d</i>. a hundredweight to 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. in 1818.
Post-war protectionism, listening to the cry of the woolgrower
for higher prices, imposed in 1819 a heavy duty of 6<i>d</i>. a
pound on foreign wool. Colonial wool was admitted at a duty of
1<i>d</i>. a pound. The duty on foreign wool caused a contraction
in imports of raw material and in exports of woollens. In 1825,
when Huskisson codified the Customs, high protection gave way to
a revenue duty of 1<i>d</i>., subsequently ½<i>d</i>., a
pound, and the banked out supplies of foreign wool came in with a
rush. No doubt, as Earl Stanhope complained,** the price of
English wools fell in sympathy with those of the fine wools
imported. But a wider public than the beneficiaries of an
artificial dearth of wool, to whose interests the noble lord
appealed, stood to gain by the freeing of trade. The high cost of
raw materials during the five years of restriction had cramped
the woollen industry and raised cloth-prices to the loss of both
consumers and exporters.*** British flock-masters had long known
the manufacturers' needs of "quality wool" but had followed other
ambitions. In the eighteen-twenties they well knew of the waning
of Peninsular supplies and of the attempts to acclimatize Spanish
wool abroad.</p>

Wool</i> (1828) (Mitchell Library). Cf. p. 78.]</p>

<p class="foot">[*** See James Bischoff, <i>The Wool Question
Considered</i> (1828), p. 84.]</p>
<p>One of them had watched Saxon and French attempts to divert
from Spain the fine wool industry, without being much impressed
thereby. He urged that Southdowns improved by Merino rams would
make a safer, and a British, base for its continuance. The
chance, if it ever existed, of acclimatizing fine wool in Britain
was not taken. A joint production of mutton and coarser wool paid
better. But Australian pastoralists, though without experience of
their own, were quick to seize the lessons of failures and
changes, and to exploit a more favourable climate elsewhere.</p>
<p>Spanish wool had been grown by unchanging and traditional
methods. Flocks ten thousand strong had been guarded by head
shepherds, each aided by fifty assistants and as many dogs.
According to the season, they were conducted north or south, from
mountain to plain, travelling about 2 leagues a day. The dogs of
mastiff type more than matched in size and strength the wolves
against which they defended the flocks; the sheep were trained to
gather to them at any alarm. As a rule the sheep were folded till
the dews were gone. Lambs' tails were cut and their noses
branded. The sheep-owners shore their flocks unwashed and sold
the wool in the grease. Dealers washed and sorted it at
river-side establishments, and packed it for export in bags
holding about two hundredweight. After shearing, the ewes were
housed from the night cold in narrow "sudatories", and crowded so
closely that they perspired freely, the aim being, it was said,
to make the new wool softer.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* See J. K. Trimmer, <i>Improvement of British
Fine Wool</i> (1828) and Thomas Southey, <i>Observations
addressed to the Wool-growers of Australia and Tasmania</i>, 2nd
edition (1831) (Mitchell Library).]</p>
<p>In Germany and France several flocks of Merinos had been
established during the age of the Enlightened Despots, notably in
Saxony and Bohemia, and also at Rambouillet in France, by Louis
XVI. The Saxons had coddled and housed their flocks to safeguard
them from lung troubles in a rigorous winter climate. The
delicacy of unacclimatized constitutions may have increased with
the in-breeding of small and isolated studs.** The wool produced,
however, had scored heavily with British manufacturers owing to
its fine texture and "kindness" to the touch. This "kindness",
which gave a "small face" on the finished cloth, was produced by
washing the wool on the sheeps' backs and allowing the "yolk" to
rise again. Fine as was the Saxon wool, Trimmer thought the Saxon
Merinos a puny race, growing but half the weight of wool yielded
by the stock from which they sprang. Yet at the close of the wars
(1814), Britain imported 3,595,146 pounds from Germany, while the
Spanish supply was stagnant at 9¼ million pounds. By 1827
the German supply had grown six-fold to over 22,000,000 pounds,
while the Spanish quota was down to 4,349,643 pounds.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Thomas Southey, <i>op.cit</i>., quotes an
account of the introduction of Spanish sheep from Moravia to Graf
Hunyadi's Hungarian estates, which emphasizes the minute care
taken of them. "Out of 17,000 sheep there is not one whose whole
family he cannot trace by reference to his books. The sheep are
driven under sheds when it rains or the heat is oppressive. They
always lamb in the house, the ewe being, placed in a little pen
by herself. One shepherd looks after every hundred sheep."</p>
<p>"A little barley-meal should be placed in the water-trough to
increase the ewe's milk. Ewes failing in milk should be given
meal and salt in water."]</p>
<p>According to Trimmer, French armies had seized 200,000 Merinos
during the wars, and had spread the blood far and wide through
France. But on inspection, the Rambouillet stud-flock pleased the
English flock-master no more than the Saxons did. The French
Merinos, albeit large in frame for that breed, seemed "the most
unsightly flock of the kind he had ever met with", their fleeces
deformed with the most exaggerated wrinkles. "If such be the
victory" over his smaller but neat Southdown-Merino flock, close
in body as in fleece, "I am well satisfied with my share in the
defeat."</p>
<p>His plea for breeding fine wool in Britain came too late. The
war-time demand had been for mutton and coarse clothing wools.
War had been more usual than peace in the previous half-century,
and Bakewell, with his improved Leicesters, had shown British
graziers how to meet its calls. The great breeder had even talked
of preferring a breed without wool, his great aim being mutton
and fat, which in his day was produced six inches thick on the
sheep's ribs.</p>
<p>Woollen manufacturers, watching the decline and progress of
Spanish and Saxon supplies, noted with joy the improving colonial
wools. Here was a supply where mutton could not long be a
distracting factor. The colonial market for it must soon be
glutted. The loss of the preference of 5<i>d</i>. a pound in
1825-6 coincided with a drought in Australia and accentuated the
financial troubles consequent on a stock boom in the year
following. But by this date admiration for colonial wools had
become vocal before Parliamentary committees. A Blackwell Hall
factor reported them "more sought after than any other
description",*** and a London merchant spoke of the cloth they
made as beyond equal "for fineness of texture and softness of
quality. Equal to the wool of any country and of any time, it has
the strength of wool with the softness of silk". Two million
pounds of it were said to have arrived that year, and sea
transport was no longer held a handicap. Some claimed they could
bring wool home from Sydney or Hobart Town at less cost for
carriage than from Vienna or Leipzig.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** H. Hughes in evidence before a House of
Lords Committee, 1826.]</p>
<p>Van Diemen's Land graziers made most rapid progress at first.
The lands in the eastern half of the island were open and
accessible through the Derwent and Tamar estuaries. The climate
was that of South Devon and Cornwall in the river valleys, of a
sunnier Scotland on the mountains, snow-clad during the
boisterous Southern winter. While Governor Macquarie was
shortsightedly spoiling his emancipists, Lieutenant-Governor
Sorell grasped the magnitude of McArthur's idea. Early in 1820 he
bought 300 of the Camden Ram Lambs at five guineas a head and
induced the island settlers to use them by an offer of prizes for
the finest wool.* In the late 'twenties, the Van Diemen's Land
Company obtained 350,000 acres in the north-west of the island,
and spent £40,000 on introducing the finest Saxon Merinos
and over £100,000 on the development, of its properties. A
smaller company, the Van Diemen's Land Establishment, spent
£40,000 on its lands around Cressy near Launceston. Its
stock maintained a high repute for many years, although the
Establishment collapsed. The Van Diemen's Land flocks increased
from a doubtful 182,000 very ordinary Teeswaters in 1820 to
663,000, virtually all Merinos, in 1830. Backed by Sorell's
guarantee to buy all wool at 4<i>d</i>. a pound, the export from
Van Diemen's Land exceeded in the late 'twenties that of all the
mainland runs.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Sorell to McArthur, 4 February 1820,

successfully landed in Hobart Town.]</p>
<p>"Vandemonian" stations, however, were all too accessible.
"Bolters", as escaped convicts or bushrangers were first called
in the island, became an intolerable plague.** Sheep-stealing was
all too easy where flocks numbering hundreds might be driven off
in daylight into secluded glens of the Eastern or Western Tiers,
the brands blotted at leisure, and the sheep sold at the other
end of the island with small chance of detection and less of
punishment. The nearest criminal court was in Sydney.</p>

<p>When in 1824 the colony was separated from New South Wales, it
received a court of its own. Its first Governor, Colonel George
Arthur, ruled in despotic style for twelve years. By sheer
assiduity he hunted down the bushrangers and maintained a
semblance of discipline. The capture of Matthew Brady in 1826
ended the days when a "Governor of the Ranges" affected to
correspond on equal terms with the "Governor of the Town". Arthur
prohibited the payment of wages to assigned servants and relied
on watchfulness to maintain control of the prisoners. Though
these measures might prevent the worst excesses, they had in them
no germ of improvement; the mountain glens were still fatally
accessible. Such advantages as the river valleys had possessed
for English agriculture *** were discounted by the lack of
appropriate town markets for its mixed products, as well as by
the presence of such evils as thieving natives and bushrangers.
When the Hunter Valley in New South Wales was settled, and good
seasons came to that colony again, Van Diemen's Land slumped.
Similar episodes of quick prosperity were to recur in the
'fifties and 'eighties, in reflection of mainland booms. But her
neighbours so surpass Tasmania in climate and fertility of soil
that the island has never been able to hold back its energetic
sons from crossing the straits. Hobart newspapers were
complaining in 1826 of artisans and mechanics who went off to Rio
or Valparaiso. Since Port Phillip and New Zealand were settled,
these nearer centres have attracted Tasmanians still more
strongly.</p>

ready. Of 50 acres cleared for cultivation, 30 are ploughed and
part sown. He is preparing to plant sweet-briar hedges under the
"dead fences" and has "three bushels of haws of colonial

<p>The concentration of convict-transports into Tasmanian ports
after the cessation of "the system" in New South Wales (1840)
only made matters worse. Four thousand convicts a year poured
into the colony between that year and 1853, when the system was
finally abandoned in Eastern Australia. Over 67,000 in all had
been sent thither. An official who had entered the service in
1829 shuddered after half a century at his first memories of
Hobart Town&mdash;rough streets of squalid houses, drunkenness,
robbery and frequent murder. "But the immense chain-gangs or
files, two or three hundred yards long, of men undergoing
secondary punishment, all in heavy irons, dressed in yellow
clothing and closely guarded by armed soldiers and police,
passing along the streets with chains rattling most dismally all
the way, were the most striking sight that caught my eye after
landing. My first impression of the place was that there was
nothing beautiful about it except Mount Wellington and the clear
blue sky overhead." * The "better class" convicts manned the
Customs Department as "writers", receiving sixpence a day and
"board wages". "Men of this stamp were, of course, not much to be
relied on. They required a very Argus to keep watch over them in
a revenue office." **</p>

<p>A few entries in a settler's diary of October and November
1829 indicate how the better convicts fared when assigned to
private employment. When a convict servant's zeal at "burning
off" displeases the master, he is taken to the Police Officer and
ordered 50 lashes forthwith. Within a fortnight comes this
eloquent entry: "3 November: I have now fifteen prisoners who do
the whole of the work of the farm without my paying a shilling in
wages, but how much looking after they require!
C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l, the fellow who was flogged well for his
idleness, is now learning to thrash and after this week he shall
thrash or be thrashed, without putting me to the trouble of
looking after him".*** Within ten days he was again flogged 50
lashes "and the chief constable directed to make a new cat for
him". Within a month the same servant was in trouble for letting
the oxen feed on the wheat-field and was sentenced to six months
in the government gang. Then "18 December: Surprised by a letter
from C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;l, from the chain gang, promising
better behaviour if I would intercede for him and take him back.
That I certainly shall not do". Criminals driven by such means to
uncongenial tasks not unnaturally chose, whenever the faintest
chance offered, to "go bush" in the hope of at least a spell of
liberty, though in so doing they "put their necks into a
halter".****</p>

<p>As the great age of squatting dawned in New South Wales, and
as free farmers spread over the Adelaide Plains, all that could
do so fled the ill-omened island whose very name had become a
byword for discord and criminality. There fell upon it the palsy
of inferiority.</p>
<p>On the mainland, where the climate offered a more difficult
problem to those sons of foggy Britain, the pastoralists' craft
was slowly articulated under the stress of necessity with many
blunders and small successes. "Considering", wrote one of the
pioneers at the end of a long life of learning, "that they had
nobody else's experience to work on, and that hardly any of them
had had anything to do with sheep or cattle or horses in their
lives before, they managed to flounder along and do wonderfully
well." ***** John McArthur's account of how they, kept the native
pastures sweet in his day suggests blackfellows driving game.
"The natural grasses are in all seasons rich and abundant," he
said. (He was always heroic and at the moment he was persuading
the Privy Council who knew nothing of Australian droughts.) "When
they become too rank they are burnt off, and are almost
immediately succeeded by a younger and sweeter herbage which the
sheep eat greedily and keep bare." On alluvial flats, where
periodic floods top-dressed the soil and the constant small
tillage of a myriad hoofs compacted the turf, the spread of
European plants "electrified the country". On the drier uplands
with a lighter covering, deterioration followed the loss of humus
by such burning. Flocks increased in the favourable seasons up to
the limit of carrying capacity. Then came the sudden droughts of
a warm temperate zone as the whip and spur of expansion in search
of grass.</p>
<p class="foot">[***** R. D. Barton, <i>Reminiscences of an
Australian Squatter</i> (1883), p. 35.]</p>
<p>In the 'twenties and 'thirties, however, all seemed easy to
the young pioneers. With an established repute for the quality of
their product, and, an unlimited market as a result of the
release of English manufacturers from fiscal burdens, the boom in
Colonial "wool establishments" was no mystery. Flock-masters and
wool-brokers proffered advice to the new graziers how to tend
their sheep and to prepare their clips for market. Companies were
formed in London to seize on a large scale the great chance that
had so long gone begging at the Antipodes. Sailing ships, and
even an occasional steamer, went rolling down wind in the roaring
forties, their gunwales no longer lined by the tristful, hopeless
faces of convicts, but by free settlers fired with ambition to
make their fortunes by filling John Bull's greater woolsack.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br>
<br>
Pioneering in the Pastoral Industry</h3>
<br>
<p><small>IN</small> 1815 a party of convicts escaped from the
settlement at Bathurst established by Governor Macquarie for
small expiree farmers, and sought a way to New Guinea down the
Macquarie River. They soon came back, nearly starved, but telling
of endless grassy plains. In 1817 and 1818, Surveyor-General
Oxley traced both Lachlan and Macquarie Rivers into flooded
marshes. Was there an inland sea beyond? Working back to the
coast northward of Sydney, he crossed rich grasslands on the New
England plateau and Liverpool Plains. In 1820, Wild reached Lake
George, and in the next year Throsby found the Murrumbidgee not
far from the site of Canberra. Bigge, noting the attractive
climate and foreseeing the accessibility of a colony on Bass's
Straits, urged a careful survey of the inland pastures by an
expedition from the head of Port Phillip to Lake George, to be
followed by the introduction of free settlers. Brisbane thought
of landing a party of convicts at Wilson's Promontory and
rewarding with free pardons 411 who reached Sydney.</p>
<p>On the saner advice of Alexander Berry, a Sydney merchant, he
finally selected Hamilton Hume, a colonial-born bushman who had
shown exploring talent beyond Bathurst, to lead an expedition
south-west from Lake George. With six assigned servants and
Hovell, a ship's captain who had opened up the Illawarra country,
Hume crossed the Murrumbidgee in October 1824, half-climbed the
snow-clad Monaro tableland, worked round it inland, rafted the
party over a deep westward-flowing river on a dray covered with
tarpaulin, forded more rivers flowing north-west, worked west
again round rough snow-clad country, found Kilmore Gap and
emerged on an inlet which both he and Hovell took to be Western
Port, but which was actually Corio Bay where now stands Geelong.
When Western Port was occupied in 1826 by a party of soldiers and
convicts, they found sealers there and some acres of land under
wheat and vegetables.</p>
<p>In 1827 and 1828, Allan Cunningham, botanizing north of
Oxley's New England, reached another attractive tableland, the
Darling Downs, and saw a gap through which, on a second coastwise
expedition, he climbed to the Downs from Moreton Bay.</p>
<p>These successive thrusts over the range had shown that
well-watered grasslands extended north and south for at least a
thousand miles and were approachable through three or four gaps
in addition to the difficult Blue Mountains road to Bathurst. But
how far west did they stretch? Did their slope in that direction
reach the shores of an inland sea? In winter, rain-clouds banked
up from the west and north-west, yet in September and October,
the southern spring, parching winds regularly blew over the
mountains from the west.</p>
<p>A severe drought between Cunningham's two journeys dried up
the marshes that had baulked Oxley's way westward, and Captain
Charles Sturt pushed out with Hume to find the sea to which the
westward rivers flowed. Leaving the reed-beds, they rode over dry
plains till they came upon a stream between high banks trending
southwest, with water too brackish to drink. They named it the
Darling. Sturt saw it again in 1829 when he tracked the
Murrumbidgee by dray, and when more marshes stopped him, by a
whaleboat, brought overland in sections and put together by his
convict servants on the river bank. Making their way into the
Murray and naming it, the party rowed with the current for 26
days, passed what they guessed to be the Darling Junction, saw
Mount Lofty Ranges in the dim west, and turning south, emerged in
Lake Alexandrina. Finding no relief ship in Encounter Bay beyond
the mighty surf of the Murray Mouth, they rowed upstream for 56
days on a ration of less than half-a-pound of flour a day,
against a river swollen by flood-waters. Uncomplaining, the men
fell asleep over their oars. Then they camped and sent on the two
strongest to Wantabadgery depot for relief which came just as the
last ounce of flour had been eaten. Sturt, a "verray perfigt
gentil knight" among the explorers, went blind for many
months.</p>
<p>Oxley's successor, Major Thomas Mitchell, was one of
Wellington's Torres Vedras men, and had envied Sturt the honour
of being chosen to explore the inland rivers. In 1831 he struck
north-west to find a great "Kindur" river of which a runaway
convict told native tales. He crossed the Peel and the Namoi and
found the Macintyre. The blacks called it the Karaula, but there
was no sea, nor light-coloured men seeking scented wood. And the
aborigines stole his stores. In 1835, working west-northwest, he
reached the Darling and built a stockade at Fort Bourke. Thence
he followed the flowing river through well-grassed land, but not
to the Murray. When he knew that Sturt had guessed right, he
turned back. In 1836, however, he went from Orange down the
Lachlan and Murrumbidgee to the Murray-Darling junction,
reascended the Murray to the Loddon, traced it south, crossed to
the Grampians and the Pyrenees and followed the Glenelg to the
Southern Ocean. Peninsular names&mdash;Nivelle, Arapiles,
Trafalgar&mdash;still mark his route across "Australia Felix" as
he named the fertile Wimmera and western districts. He marched
back from the Glenelg in military order, and his cart-tracks,
"the Major's line", became the route by which Sydney-side
stockmen made their way overland to Port Phillip district. But
"in this Eden" he was not, as he supposed, "the only Adam". His
little column was drawn to the coast again by a glimpse of Edward
Henty's farm and whaling station on Portland Bay. And on 30
September 1836 from the summit of Mount Macedon he made out, at
the northern corner of Port Phillip, "a mass of white objects
which might have been either tents or vessels". It was the
beginning of Melbourne. Batman and Fawkner, both young colonials,
the one a blacksmith-settler and the other a journalist of
rebellious habit, had been there for six weeks, founding from
Launceston an unauthorized base for the settlement of Port
Phillip district. They had discovered the scene to which David
Collins had shut his eyes when in 1803 he lost heart at Sorrento
and fled to Van Diemen's Land.</p>
<p>Sturt's heroic boat journey and Major Mitchell's
reconnaissances proved that wide inland horizons lay before the
quiet battalions already being deployed through the gaps in the
ranges. Their occupation of "runs" and "stations", spreading out
fanwise to north, west and south-west, was the first detailed
exploration of the land.</p>
<p>No General Orders directed their advance. On the contrary, in
October 1829, Governor Darling had marked out nineteen counties
in a rough semicircle around Sydney and had forbidden settlement
beyond their boundaries. His gesture only demonstrated the waning
power of the Sydney government in economic matters. Ten years
later, there were 694 holdings between the Gwydir and the South
Australian border, and the rush to take up runs in Port Phillip
and its wonderful Western District was fast gaining
momentum.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* See S. Roberts, <i>History of Australian Land
Settlement</i>, ch. <small>XIII</small>, on "The Tracks of the
Squatters".]</p>
<p>The adventure of taking up a run has been incomparably
described by Professor Stephen Roberts.** "A man of small capital
acquired a flock and simply set out. . . . Each was a
land-freebooter scanning the horizon for unoccupied or unclaimed
land. He was an overlander, nursing his sore-footed flock,
watching every pinch of flour in his bullock-dray of rations, and
looking for his plains of promise or his long-dreamt of
mountain-pastures. Over the desert and the mountains, over the
sun-baked plains and the flooded marsh-lands he went, either
seeking some vague landmark dimly hinted at by a previous
explorer or one of his rivals or, more often, trusting to his
destiny, and his bushman's sense to find virgin country in the
general direction in which he was moving. . . . He kept on
despite distance and drought, starvation and disease, attacks by
the blacks and desertions by his men. He was staking everything,
often his life, on finding a suitable 'run' for his sheep, and
until he reached this haven, nothing else counted."</p>
<p class="foot">[** Appearing in <i>Cambridge History of the
British Empire</i>, vol. <small>VII</small>, ch.
<small>VII</small>.]</p>
<p>When Darling set his limits on the official maps he meant to
take control of this pastoral expansion. An unlicensed occupation
of Crown land within and beyond "the limits of location" was
stultifying the issue of his new annual grazing licences over
defined runs. Yet within a few years, a greatly swollen majority
of the graziers in the colony were "squatters" who had placed
their "stations" wherever they could find room, regardless of a
government which hardly existed beyond Bathurst.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** When first used in Van Diemen's Land the
term "squatter" had the same contemptuous ring in Australia as in
America and it long retained a suggestion of criminal origins, at
least in the ears of the "pure merinos" or free settlers.
"Station" originally meant a folding place where the sheep were
shut up at night as a defence against dingoes or "warrigals". The
transition to the later use may be seen in a letter dated 12 May
1830 in the Hogan MS. (Mitchell Library). The owner of Cuttawally
writes of "going up the country in about three weeks and then we
will settle where the different stations are to be". But the
whole run is already known as "Cuttawally Station" as well as
"Cuttawally Establishment". This older name "Establishment" and
the ranks of superintendent and overseer which still survive on
the stations may be traced at Emu Plains Agricultural
Establishment in <i>The Adventures, of Ralph Rashleigh</i>, pp.
88, 93, 94.]</p>
<p>The new economy did not establish itself without two bad
stumbles on the part of the new directing class, the booms of
1826 and 1838-9 and the financial crises which followed them. Yet
each of these episodes served to emphasize the importance of the
pastoral industry, for each arose through the failure of the
leaders of the free community to justify their leadership by a
single-minded activity in developing that industry. In each
instance the crash of speculation drove men back to hard work on
the main task which they had thought to leave to others.</p>
<p>The first boom may best be described as it appeared to the
critical eyes of John Dunmore Lang, the fiery Scots parson whose
zeal for Australia, though marred by a bitter sectarianism,
burned with a flame that consumed many a sham during his long
life in New South Wales (1823-1878).* "The Australian
Agricultural Company commenced operations in 1826.** As cattle
and horses had to be purchased for the company wherever they
could be got the price of agricultural stock rose rapidly
throughout the colony, insomuch that cattle of colonial breed
were actually sold to the company's agent for twelve guineas and
sheep for four or five guineas a head. . . . No sooner had the
existence of the A. A. Company been announced and its operations
commenced in right earnest than the sheep and cattle mania
instantly seized on all ranks and classes of the inhabitants. The
mania impelled whomsoever it seized to the cattle market. . . .
Barristers, attorneys, military officers of every rank, civilians
of every department, clergymen, medical men, merchants, dealers,
settlers were there seen promiscuously mingled together every
Thursday outbidding each other in the most determined manner for
the purchase of every scabbed sheep, scarecrow horse or buffalo
cow in the colony that was offered for sale. It was universally
allowed that the calculations of the projectors of the A. A.
Company could not be inaccurate. It was made as clear as daylight
to the comprehension of stupidity itself that the owner of a
certain number of sheep and cattle in New South Wales must in a
certain number of years infallibly make a fortune. It was
determined on all hands that the A. A. Company should not be the
only reaper of this golden harvest. . . .</p>
<p class="foot">[* A short biography in the <i>Australian
Encyclopaedia</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p. 719, gives a fair
outline of his career.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** See S. Roberts, <i>History of Australian Land
Settlement</i>, ch. <small>VI</small>, and Appendix
<small>I</small>.]</p>
<p>"In all cases where the purchaser had money to pay for his
sheep and cattle money was paid. Where money was not forthcoming,
as was generally the case, credit was allowed. . . . It was not
at all to be wondered at that persons who were to be so speedily
enriched beyond their highest previous expectations should begin
to speculate prematurely. Articles were accordingly ordered and
bills given for their payment and so favourable was the prospect
of demand for the future that colonial merchants or importers
were induced to order large quantities of British and other
foreign goods till their warehouses were filled and almost every
article of British manufacture could be obtained in Sydney at a
cheaper rate than in London.</p>
<p>"It pleased Divine Providence to visit the colony in the midst
of these speculations with an afflictive drought of nearly three
years continuance, the effect of which, combined with the natural
result of the sheep and cattle mania, was to open the eyes of the
colonists to their own folly and madness, to blast the golden
hopes of thousands and to bring many families to poverty and
ruin. . . . Month after month herds of cattle and flocks of sheep
were seized and sold for the payment of debts incurred by their
original purchase. . . . The ruin thus experienced in all
directions was just a little less extensive than the mania which
had originally caused it. Those who had commenced with capital
found that they had lost it in great measure. Those who had
salaries found that these must in future be appropriated for the
payment of debts which their own cupidity and infatuation had led
them to contract. Those who had neither capital nor salaries at
the first had their property brought to the hammer and themselves
to poverty or prison:"</p>
<p>During 1830, although the rate of interest allowed by law was
only eight per cent., twelve, fifteen, twenty and even
twenty-five and thirty per cent. interest was obtained to meet
the urgent necessities of individual settlers.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Dr Lang's description is quoted by Edward
Pulsford in his <i>Rise, Progress and Present Position of Trade
and Commerce in New South Wales</i>, written in 1893 for the
N.S.W. Commission to the World's Fair at Chicago.]</p>
<p>In 1838 there was, for a second time speculation, such as
marks the adoption of any new and promising expedient of economic
advance, on the increase in stock and land values. The population
of the colony had grown from 30,267 in 1827 to 68,795 in 1838.
Old and new colonies were expanding rapidly in Van Diemen's Land
and South Australia. "New chums" were again buying up flocks and
herds without the experience necessary to calculate the income
they could be made to yield. The proceeds of government
land-sales at Port Phillip and at Sydney were being used to bring
out numbers of assisted immigrants. Graziers were tempted to
believe that high prices and abundant labour made big profits
certain. Again there was a fevered zeal to buy stock and equip
stations. Speculators "put it about" that land values must rise
still more. On the wings of hope the reckless soared into the
inane.</p>
<p>In 1839 the Government announced that the price of land would
be raised to 12<i>s</i>. an acre as soon as the 300,000 acres of
land already offered at 5<i>s</i>. had been sold. The authorities
thought to check the speculative buying of what was deemed cheap
land. Their action had just the opposite effect; men rushed to
buy at five shillings what would soon be worth twelve. Auction
sales of Melbourne town allotments realized £131,000 in
1838, £152,000 in 1839 and £313,000 in the first ten
months of 1840. Some allotments that had been sold in 1837
brought within three years eighty times what had been paid for
them. Even in the proposed suburbs of Melbourne, a
twenty-five-fold increase was not unknown. Private re-sales were
made on credit, the amounts outstanding to bear interest at ten
per cent. To finance this gambling in title-deeds there was
general borrowing on the collateral security of land at the
inflated prices. Payments of town wages and for government land
were the only occasions for the use of cash.</p>
<p>New banks were competing for a footing in this land of the
golden fleece. At the beginning of 1834 there were only two
colonial banks&mdash;the Banks of New South Wales and of
Australia, the latter having been founded in 1826 on an unlimited
liability basis with a capital of £400,000. In 1834 the
Commercial Banking Company of Sydney opened its doors and the
Bathurst Bank was founded in 1835. These were followed by the
Bank of Australasia and the Chartered Bank of Australasia in
1836, the former of which boasted a capital of £400,000,
and by the Union Bank of Australia and the Sydney Bank in 1839.
By that year the total capital of the banks serving the colony's
trade in Sydney or in London was over £2,300,955. In 1841
out of their total assets of £3,050,000 the banks held
£2,610,000 in discounted bills. London merchants in haste
to make money out of such a well-provided community poured in on
consignment masses of goods, largely luxuries. Governor Gipps
marked the profusion in which all classes were living by
declaring that around Melbourne the country was "strewn for
miles, almost for hundreds of miles, with champagne
bottles".*</p>
<p class="foot">[* T. A. Coghlan, <i>Labour and Industry in
Australia</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, pp. 473 <i>et seq</i>.]</p>
<p>As the pressure increased, rates of interest as high as 15 per
cent. were promised, but, unless the prices at which title-deeds
changed hands continued to soar steeply, such rates would soon
ruin speculators using borrowed funds. In 1839 financial
stringency in London checked the flow of capital to Australia. In
the new province of South Australia land sales and credit
collapsed, and "scourging drought" in New South Wales from 1838
to 1840 accentuated the mistrust felt in England about the future
of all the colonies. Within the colonies, the drought undermined
credit by forcing heavy exports of coin to India, Java and Chili
to pay for rice, maize and wheat. Governor Gipps relieved the
banks' need for a time by placing on deposit with them the cash
it had been customary to hold in the Treasury, but the cessation
of land sales soon forced him to call up his deposits. A quarter
of a million was withdrawn between July 1840 and November 1841 to
pay the public service. Heavy payments by government of bonuses
to assisted immigrants came due as the delayed result of activity
in sending them out during the boom period. The banks called in
advances and stopped all "cash credits"; spending ceased, save,
on bare necessaries. The regular merchants found their business
paralysed by the sale of speculators' consignments at auction
without reserve. Banks which nursed trader-clients whose stocks
were unsaleable only added to their losses. Farmers and
pastoralists who offered bullocks or wool in payment for stores
had to sacrifice them on a glutted market into which all were
forced by drought. Sheep had brought 35<i>s</i>. a head in 1839:
in 1843 they were sold at "sixpence a head and the station given
in". Horses worth "£50 to £70 for the commonest hack"
in 1839 went for £7 in 1843. Fat cattle went at 50<i>s</i>.
as compared with £10 to £12.</p>
<p>Settlers, merchants, storekeepers and working house holders
were alike glad of the shelter of a new Bankruptcy Act passed by
Council in 1842 at the instance of Judge Burton. It left debtors
their freedom on condition that they surrendered their estates to
their creditors. The estates as a rule fetched little. When in
1843 the Banks of Australia, Port Phillip and Sydney failed, the
assets of the first, in which many leading colonists had already
lost their share-capital, were liquidated by a lottery&mdash;the
only way that would attract a little cash.</p>
<p>Financial oracles, including the majority, in the Legislative
Council, were insistent that the Governor should "stem the tide
of disaster" by issuing new cash, notes backed by mortgages on
land. The distant Colonial Office, however, put a veto on such
heterodox money. But out of "the Bad Times", as these years of
despair were long called, came two expedients that helped the
insolvents set free by Burton's <i>Seisachtheia</i> to find their
feet again.</p>
<p>To start wool-growing the first requisite was a waggon-load of
stores and some sheep with which to make the westward march. How
could pastoralists give security for payment? They had no land,
and in any event it was almost unsaleable. In September 1843 an
Act of Council was passed permitting banks to lend against liens
on live-stock and wool. Again the Colonial Office demurred. It
relied on London ideas of sound banking, the first rule of which
was that the banker must draw a firm line between commercial
bills and mortgages on property. Bills, to London financiers, had
behind them goods on their way to consumers. Before the bill was
due, the sale of the goods would put the drawee in funds to meet
his obligation. Land might be drought-stricken: movable property
might prove sterile or perishable. In a crude new country,
however, such bills were not to be found. Behind the best of the
bills which the banks had discounted during the boom the assets
were often land, stock and wool; and if banks could not or would
not lend on such security they would not lend at all&mdash;their
capital would lie idle. The Council stood its ground and the Act
was maintained against every threat of disallowance. As it had
already given the relief intended, the Colonial Office let well
alone. In finance accomplished facts must be respected.</p>
<p>The other saving expedient was boiling down sheep for their
tallow. This was first tried by Henry O'Brien of Yass as an
escape from scab * and from the ruinous prices which sheep were
fetching. When the tallow from a sheep was worth four or five
shillings and the English market for it was firm, the boiling
down vat, however wasteful of good mutton, was an effective
retort to bids of 6<i>d</i>. a head. In 1844, forty-four
boiling-down plants rendered 350,000 sheep into 48,758 cwt. of
tallow. The maximum output was 233,757 cwt. from 1,700,000 sheep
in 1850. As the demand for stock revived, the need of this
gruesome last resort quickly passed. "The value of the
discovery", thought Sir Timothy Coghlan, "lay more in its effects
upon men's minds than in the actual use to which it was put."</p>
<p class="foot">[* On this highly contagious disease and the
obstacles which long hindered its suppression, see E. M. Curr,
<i>Scab in Sheep</i>, Melbourne 1865. The annual loss caused in
Victoria alone for many years was £500,000.]</p>
<p>The ruin brought on many by their boom-time projects forced
them to work again as active producers. The result was a spurt in
exports almost as prompt as the decline of imports. The latter
fell away from £3,014,189 in 1840 to £931,260 in
1844, in which year exports surpassed imports for the first time
in the colony's history, being worth £1,128,115. New
production was attempted along many lines. George Hobler
contrived to make champagne on his Hunter River property, but
rain spoiled his vintage, and the boom thirst did not revive.
Then he tried fresh fruit, but the Sydney market was too soon
glutted, and the vigneron "determined to make raisins for our own
use". It is a most uncertain country for agricultural pursuits"
he reflected. "The day before the rain commenced the corn seemed
to be scorched up past all help. Now there is every appearance of
a good crop which may have the effect of making it all but
unsaleable. Prices now are about 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. for wheat,
2<i>s</i>. to 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. barley, 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>.
maize, 45<i>s</i>. hay, butter 9<i>d</i>. and meat
1½<i>d</i>." ** The only way, he found, was to persist with
wool and tallow. Stores were cheap and there was still plenty of
labour competent to run sheep after the fashion which suited a
semi-nomadic economy.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Hobler MS. 1844 (Mitchell Library).]</p>
<p>Many descendants of the pioneers hold firmly to "Banjo"
Paterson's faith</p>
<p class="poem">That nothing in the ages old<br>
In song or story written yet,<br>
On Grecian urn or Roman arch,<br>
Though it should ring with clash of steel,<br>

The story of their westward march.</p>
<p>Others in Australia would reduce the merit of the pioneers to
the sheer luck of having been the first favoured few with flocks
and herds to drive into rich empty pastures. There they had but
to watch wool grow and numbers multiply while the excluded many,
equally capable, did all the hard work. Either view is
imaginative and false. The true "story of their westward march",
as revealed in the diaries and memoirs of its participants, is no
epic of disinterested bravery. They waged no public war, but each
devoted his slender resources to a more thorough and truceless
conquest&mdash;the occupation of land by a new economy. What drew
them to Australia was not quest of glory, but the main chance of
making good a family's foothold in a new and, as they held,
unused land. It was neither child's play nor high romance. And
the measure of their deserts and their success in comparison with
those of the workers they employed was the measure of their
courage and endurance.</p>
<p>Anthropologists still protest at their and our "neglect" of
the aborigines&mdash;and even active extermination of them.* They
ask for the native a few crumbs from the proceeds of a more
provident use of his country, and for authentic reserves in which
the "outback" survivors of its primitive huntsmen may maintain
themselves as of old. This is both just and, for the high purpose
of knowing the taciturn mind of an archaic race, also wise. But
there was and there can be no consistency between a hunting and a
pastoral use of land and beasts. The blacks' morale and their
elaborate code of honour crumbled as the squatters and their
servants drove multitudes of strange beasts across the tribal
boundaries, shot down warriors and the native game, even those
tabooed to the tribe, ensnared the gins and children into
dishonour and drudgery by gifts of rum, tobacco and flour. In
numbers the older race was too weak, in organization too divided,
to resist a folk who, despite their still feebler numbers, had
food in plenty, weapons of incomparable power, and a ruthless
mutual loyalty.</p>

<p>A tribe could for a time be formidable to a solitary pastoral
household or an isolated hut, with stores half-watched and flock
unyarded and astray. But their half-instinctive "duffing" from
the newcomers' abundance would soon or late be answered by a
"rounding up" and "dispersal" of the blacks in the vicinity of
the "theft". Of the survivors, a few, proud old men might stand
aloof still living on game and grubs, their only belongings a few
skins, spears and firestick. Outwardly scornful, their hearts
were benumbed with broken memories and despair. The youngsters,
laughing at the defeated spirit and traditions of their elders,
accepted the white man's food and excitements, rode his horses,
even wore his uniform and as native police tracked down their
fellows. The old hunting skill of the blacks was thus fatally
domesticated and turned against the "myalls" or untamed blacks on
the edge of pastoral occupation. But disease thinned off with
hideous rapidity the domesticated blacks, and no disagreement
between the whites regarding their mutual rights to the land
prevented their joining to treat the myalls as vermin whose
destruction was to be achieved by any means, from shot-guns to
poisoned damper.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** For an account of the massacre by blacks of a
benevolent squatter, named. Wills, and his household, at
Cullin-la-ringo in the Comet country, Queensland, 1861, see
Nisbet MS. Mitchell Library. Another pathetic murder was that of
a small squatter, Maclaren, stalked all day and slain close to
his hut near Gurumbah, after he had put down his gun and gone
back for some sick sheep, while his family sat waiting for "tea".
In <i>Christison of Lammermoor</i>, chs. VIII, IX, X, and on pp.
226-8, may be read the methods and difficulties of an exceptional
squatter who "worked in with" the blacks. "Kurry used to be as
shy as a frightened fawn with white people. . . . A few years
later in Hughenden town nobody would have recognized the shy
pretty girl in the drunken woman screaming larrikin filth at a
half-caste urchin."]</p>
<p>The squatters and their servants came by degrees. They used
the land in a pastoral economy, demanding, above all, security
from the hunters' spears for their beasts and from his firestick
for the grass. They obtained it, occasionally by bribing and
befriending the blacks, usually by brutal intimidation. Then
disease and the depression of manifest impotence wasted the
survivors all too rapidly for the squatters' liking&mdash;for
they had found in the young blacks, who were handy with stock, a
supply of docile and cheap labour. In undisputed possession, as
far as the spearmen were concerned, the squatters pursued their
plans, watching over, cajoling and shepherding the white
shepherds whom they set to watch their "faint flocks and
herds".</p>
<p>Their care was made fruitful, their isolation tolerable, by a
regular exchange of goods at the coastal ports between "bullock
waggons toiling down to fetch the wool away" and sailing-ships
bringing cargoes of clothing and hardware over the tumbled
Southern Ocean. Individuals, "undirected by the fostering care of
government", developed the pastoral industry which still remains
the principal activity and support of the white man's Australian
economy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br>
<br>
Shepherding and Marketing</h3>
<br>
<p><small>"WOOL-FARMING"</small>&mdash;the term is John
McArthur's&mdash;called neither for skill nor assiduous labour.
It adjusted itself to the quality and quantity of the human
material available.* Shepherds and hut-keepers were placed at the
various "stations" on a run, in deliberate isolation from the
temptations to which they had formerly succumbed. In the days of
open boundaries, a run was simply a string of such stations
stretched out over perhaps forty miles of country. The overseer
was expected to visit each in its turn, taking the men their
rations, tobacco, newspapers and any other odds and ends they had
bespoken from the "headquarters" store. He would count each flock
and, of course, discuss the state of feed and water. This
incessant round with rations was "a dingo's life" for the
overseer, but the existence of the shepherds and hut-keepers at
the stations was a soul-destroying monotony. Seldom or never had
they the resources of mind from which to build an inner life to
compensate for the loss of Sydney's gregarious pleasures.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The convict, according to Dr Lang, "is better
clothed, better fed, and better lodged than three-fourths of the
labouring agricultural population of Great Britain and Ireland.
While at the same time his labour is beyond all comparison much
less oppressive".]</p>
<p>A slab-hut with a stringy-bark roof, rough-hinged flaps in
lieu of windows, a mud floor, a packing-case table, seats made
from split logs, and beds, if any, of bush saplings and hessian,
was their home. Often a blanket on the floor and a saddle for
pillow served as "shake-down". Pasted on the walls might be a few
fly-specked cartoons from the satirical press, or coloured prints
from the Christmas numbers of the "weeklies", usually
representing famous race-horses. No enclosure surrounded the hut,
save when an exceptional hut-keeper had put in a few pumpkins or
cabbages. "In dry weather dust, in wet weather mud up to the
uncertain line at which bush ended and house began" made "a home
little better than an animal's lair" and equally attractive to
flies and vermin. For heaps of sheep's dung stood feet high at
older "stations", and the dam or river near-by made admirable
breeding-places. To light a candle indoors in summer was to fill
the place with mosquitos. The only way to escape them was to sit
or sleep in a smoke from smouldering cow-dung so dense that it
weakened the eyes' resistance to "sandy blight". Just before
daybreak the mosquitos would stop, but at dawn the flies were up
for the day. "You can seldom lift a piece of food to your mouth
without one hand driving away flies to make room for it. Anything
like gravy in your plate is a sort of fly-trap and most
successful in its operations. Fleas are as abundant as may be
expected from floors of dust and so many dogs about, cats and
parrots, and the thermometer indoors usually from 90° to
100°".** Any abrasion of the skin tended to fester. The flies
helped to spread an infectious condition known as "Barcoo
rot".</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Hobler</i> Papers (Mitchell Library), vol.
v, p. 4, 21 January 1847, on the Lower Murrumbidgee.]</p>
<p>At "headquarters" the squatter or his superintendent might
enjoy the co-operation of wife and family in fighting such
discomforts and maintaining some amenities of life. But in the
first pioneering the menfolk were often, from choice, "roughing
it" alone.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** See M. M. Bennett's <i>Christison of
Lammermoor</i>, p. 116: "They ate portulacca to keep off scurvy
and made tea with wild marjoram. 'It's a hungry place
Lammermoor', a traveller told a neighbour. 'Nothing to eat but
pigweed and mutton. No flour. No stores of any
description'".]</p>
<p>Station labour came from four sources&mdash;"old hands", "wild
colonials", "new chums", and, a little later, ex-diggers. They
had small chance of family life. A disparity in numbers between
the sexes persisted in extreme degree until the 'fifties,
especially up country where the squatters for pastoral reasons
looked askance upon "encumbrances".</p>
<p>"Old hands" formed the vast majority of the shepherds and
hut-keepers. Such callings suited the mentality of many sent out
for trying to live without working. They were "found" with
rations adequate for fairly valiant trenchermen, the customary
scale being 8 or 10 lb. of flour, 10 to 12 lb. of meat, 2 lb. of
sugar and a quarter of a pound of tea per man per week. In
addition, wages were "allowed" at rates varying from year to
year, but seldom in pre-gold days above £25 per annum for
shepherds and £20 for hut-keepers. Against these amounts
were all clothing and extras drawn from the headquarters-store.
When, at long intervals, the victims of monotony announced
themselves "dead sick of it" and "wanting a spell", the balance
to their credit would be paid in the form of a cheque on some
distant bank, probably in Sydney. Most of them were expirees too
weak in initiative to take up land grants or, when grants ceased,
to work at city or farm wages till they could buy "blocks". The
rations-and-cheque system offered such men no escape from
degradation, no real chance of self-respect.</p>
<p>Rations had been issued continuously from the days of assigned
service. The issue of them set up in the minds of the old hands
an implicit belief that so long as they "kept out of trouble"
their animal wants would be supplied without forethought or
exertion on their part. Rations to the "sundowner" seeking a
place seemed to them one of the rights of man. To the squatter
they were a kind of insurance-premium; for a disgruntled swag-man
could so easily be careless with matches when the grass was
dry.</p>
<p>An indirect result of this "right to tucker" was that the
paid-off station-hand fell a willing prey to another class whose
prototypes had inhabited "The Rocks", and who waited for custom
in the bush "public houses". For the Nirvana of intoxication, and
to escape for a few weeks from consciousness of a life thrown
away, the old hand would surrender a cheque representing the
reward of a year or two's work with no more compunction than "a
child surrendering a sovereign for a coveted handful of sweets".*
What escape was there when they were paid by cheque? Seamen at
the end of a voyage are at least paid off in coin, and may stand
by one another. The pastoral hand, coming in alone, was unable to
pay for anything until he had cashed his cheque at the "pub" or
store. The moment he showed it, he ticketed himself as worth so
much if he could be induced to "melt it down".</p>
<p class="foot">[* See generally "Bushmen, Publicans and
Politics", in <i>The Pastoral Times</i>, Deniliquin, 1869
(Mitchell Library).]</p>
<p>Long accustomed to rations, the old hands had no knack of cash
payment, no sense of relative values. The warm welcome at the
"house of accommodation", however pleasant to their lonely souls,
often covered the treachery of "doped" liquor. At a certain
shanty in. Central Queensland, known as "Billy &mdash;&mdash;'s
Private Cemetery", the publican was asked if there were any
chance of getting a couple of "handy men" to take out to a
station. "Looking round to the 'bar' end of the 'pub', he pointed
to one fellow lying in a drunken sleep. 'You might get that cove
in another three days. His cheque is nearly done. He only brought
£40 with him. Those other two are good rough carpenters,
but they won't be ready for a fortnight yet. They had over two
hundred pounds between them when they came in'." ** The last
scene in such a bout would be the publican's refusal to supply
more liquor. The cheque, by his reckoning, was duly "melted". And
then the victim would depart, thanking "mine host" with tears of
maudlin gratitude for his final "gift" of a bottle of rum to see
him on the way.</p>

seq</i>. Cf. <i>Hobler Papers</i>, vol. V, pp. 29, 34 <i>et
passim</i>.]</p>
<p>Licenses were granted by the Colonial Treasury at £30
per annum, often over the heads of the local bench of
magistrates, who were nominally in charge thereof. The
calculation whether it would pay to buy one turned, as of course,
on the number of work-people in the vicinity. Any station hand
who left the neighbourhood without "melting down" his cheque was
spoken of by the publican as having done him an unwarranted
injury.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** "They notice nowadays", wrote C. E. W. Bean,
<i>On the Wool Track</i> (1910), pp. 205-16, "even in the Far
West (of New South Wales) that the new generation of Australians
manages to keep its cheque in the country towns, reach Sydney or
Melbourne and lose it there." More centralization!]</p>
<p>To the squatters, the lapses of their men were at the least a
constant vexation and impediment; at the worst a source of
tragedy. An overseer on Ghinghinda (Queensland), by name Salter,
was murdered by a shepherd recovering from a spree for no cause
but a few words of rebuke. At Christmas 1848 the manager of Nap
Nap (Lower Murrumbidgee) was "shot dead on the shearing floor by
one of the shepherds who, upon some slight quarrel in which
McKinlay had been only too forbearing, had gone to his hut,
loaded a double-barrelled gun, returned and discharged both balls
through his heart, at a few feet distance". Nobody interfered
with the murderer's escape. All too commonly, attacks by blacks
on isolated homesteads were provoked by ill-usage from the
station hands. Bosses and men were alike at fault in this, but
the criminal element among the "hands" made them a source of
added risk.</p>
<p>Station employment was thus in early days primarily a
backwater of the tragic stream of transportation. The squatters
preferred men "without encumbrances" for the semi-nomadic life
when wool-growing was half exploration and all experiment. They
cost less in rations. They did not hanker after allotments which
might prove the land fit for agriculture and which always led to
disputes about "clearskins". They bred no "wild colonials" to be
"bush telegraphs" or worse.</p>
<p>From small settlers' farms along the Hawkesbury or the Hunter,
and from the few married couples that found employment on
stations came the "currency lads", "natives" or "wild
colonials"&mdash;"the results of the results of the system". Or
were they a new type fashioned by life in a wild, wide land? As
early as Macquarie's reign they were spoken of as a new type,
tall, loose-limbed, fair, small-featured and, though strong, less
athletic-looking than Englishmen of the upper classes. None
denied their versatility with horses or on ship-board. In truth
these children of the First-Fleeters were reverting in a
healthier environment to "the type of which their parents were
debased examples". John McArthur's shrewd eye sized up their
active, intelligent ways. "They will be enterprising whenever a
proper field is opened to their industry. At present many of them
have but little instruction and their future prospects are very
confined."</p>
<p>For twenty years after his death (1834) their prospects
remained confined. Born in the worst period of New South Wales or
in Van Diemen's Land, they laboured, a contemporary noted, "under
the disadvantage of having seen a larger proportion of
questionable morality than do the children of our peasantry at
home". Yet many a record stands of touching devotion to their
education by expiree parents. There was need of it. In the late
'sixties, the Riverina, one of the first occupied squatting
areas, had 20,000 people scattered over 150,000 square miles with
"scarce a dozen schools and certainly not a dozen clergymen".</p>
<p>The lithe horsemanship of the young "natives", thoroughly at
home in the bush, fitted them for more active tasks than
shepherding. They were the drovers, bullock-drivers and
horse-breakers. As shearers they were hard, fast workers when
they liked, but quarrelsome. Not specially addicted to liquor,
they were fond of horse-racing, card-games and dancing. After
roving awhile, they would marry and settle in their native
districts, but their "innate Bedouinism" came out in a sympathy
for bushrangers and skill in "sweating" a horse. They resented
the police as enforcers of a code never their own. The more
worthy their parents, the less likely were they to remain in
districts where their children's chances were so small. But
though settled on a coastal farm, the married "native" would
still turn up on the runs at shearing time, and shearers were
early noted as a class intent on a good cheque which they knew
how to carry past the publican. Having homes, they knew the value
of money.</p>
<p>The puzzles among station hands were the "new chums",
"limejuicers" or "Johnny Newcomes"&mdash;awkward immigrants from
specialized England, serving a hard apprenticeship to the rough
parts of the work as contractors' mates or as sheep-washers. They
liked jobs at weekly wages, and though as a class they were
neither loafers nor dissipated, every lapse at a bush shanty made
self-respect harder to retain. Many sought the towns in disgust;
others "escaped to New Zealand and a kindlier folk".</p>
<p>When transportation had ceased, but before Caroline Chisholm
had humanized country life by promoting the immigration of
families and by mothering the single girls, pastoralists were
growing restive at the "dangerous demoralization" of station
labour. A magistrate in the Bacchus Marsh area notes in his
diary, 17 September 1849, "Mr Labilliere called to ask for
warrants for the apprehension of two of his servants who have
absconded without cause or notice. The rascals only hired just to
get through their time until shearing came on. I issued warrants,
and if I have the handling of the scamps they shall spend the
shearing season in the body of Her Majesty's Gaol. . . . It will
take a great many more immigrants to force upon these scoundrels
the practice of propriety or common honesty . . . To pay such
fellows high wages the whole of the proprietary of the country
has been sorely pinched for years past".*</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Hobler Papers</i> (Mitchell Library), vol.
<small>V</small>, p. 125. Cf. L. Thomas, <i>Development of the
Labour Movement</i>, 1788-1848, ch. <small>V</small>.]</p>
<p>Far more hands were employed on a run in shepherding days than
now. A shepherd was expected to look after flocks gradually
increased from 300 at Camden Park to 1500 or more on Queensland
stations; his annual, wage was £25 or less in bad times.
Rations in pre-gold days cost a squatter at most another
£12. 10<i>s</i>. A hut-keeper's wage was from £18 to
£20; sometimes, where flocks were small on hilly country,
one hut-keeper served for two shepherds. Thus the prime cost of
running sheep might be as low as 1<i>s</i>. per annum.** Then
there were sheep-washing and shearing costs. Men were paid a
pound a week and a full ration for washing 700 sheep a day.***
The work was thought to be done at reasonable cost when over 3000
sheep and 300 lambs were washed in October 1849 at a total
expenditure on wages and rations of £14. 10<i>s</i>.; that
is about two-thirds of a penny per sheep. The customary wage for
shearing was 3<i>s</i>. a score, but a total shearing cost of
4<i>d</i>. a sheep wrung from its recorder a wail that "we are
working and scheming, employing capital and time just to fill the
pockets of insolent scoundrels who thereby enrich blackguard
publicans, often of their own class. The state of the country is
hopeless, unless wages are much reduced".</p>
<p class="foot">[** This allows no profit on the extras issued
from the store to the men.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** For a description of the method of
"creek-washing" see <i>Macarthur Records</i>, pp. 442-7. On most
stations extra labour was needed at lambing, concerning which see
Nisbet MS. (Mitchell Library), p. 18, and E. Shann, <i>Cattle
Chosen</i> p. 179.]</p>
<p>Any money wages, whether well or ill spent, seemed high to
pastoralists who had run their stations with assigned servants
paid by "truck" through the station store.**** In 1835, when such
labour was still plentiful, Captain Sturt estimated that a sum of
£2814 invested in wool-growing would amount after five
years to £9845, after paying 7½ per cent. all
through. The price of wool was high at the time. New South Wales
wool brought from 2<i>s</i>. to 3<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per pound
in London in the early 'twenties, and the island fleeces, which
were better sorted, somewhat more. The abolition of the
preferential duty caused a temporary decline after 1825, but best
fleeces were bringing between 2<i>s</i>. and 3<i>s</i>. a pound
in 1829, and inferior greasy fleeces as low as 6<i>d</i>. Prices
rose in the 'thirties, but fell heavily in the bad times after
1840, recovering to an all-round average of 11½<i>d</i>.
in 1844, 14<i>d</i>. in 1845 and 15<i>d</i>. in 1846, and
weakening to 13<i>d</i>. in 1848 and 10½<i>d</i>. in 1849.
To meet the fall in values, wages were cut and flocks increased
in size, but what helped most was a rising yield per sheep.
Averages are not full evidence of this, for they include the
flocks of the unsuccessful with those of the profit-makers.
Though John McArthur cut 2 lb. 7 oz. per sheep in 1820, the
average then was only 1¼ lb. By 1828 it was 1½ lb.,
in 1835 it was 1¾ lb., and in 1839 2¼ lb. and
almost 3½ lb. in Van Diemen's Land.***** In the 'twenties,
high freights and port charges made the export of any but best
fleece wool unprofitable, but by 1836 freight to London or
Liverpool might be had for 1½d. or even a penny a
pound.****** At such charges it paid to send the skirtings as
well as the fleece.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the labour problem of the late 'forties
perturbed squatters who had been used to the old system. By 1848
there were no convicts in private employ on the mainland, and,
although immigrants filled the places deserted by expirees, they
all asked for and obtained wages, though few could long endure
the isolation of the bush. The squatters of Port Phillip, the
most prosperous employers at this time, formed associations to
bring over time-expired convicts from Van Diemen's Land; even
these stood out for £20 a year. In 1845 and the following
three years, several shiploads of "exiles" who had been taught
trades in English prisons were sent out and set free on condition
that they did not return to England during their sentences. They
were employed, usually as shepherds, until it was found that the
squatters had no means of preventing their drifting into the
towns. Thereafter, all classes united to stop the transportation
of such "Pentonvillains". Chinese were tried, but those brought
were from Southern China and could not stand the shepherd's lot
in the Victorian winter.</p>
<p>It was the gold discoveries, however, which caused such a
labour shortage that entirely new methods of running sheep became
imperative. When towns swelled into cities calling urgently for
wages-men at high rates of pay under sociable conditions of work,
the abundance of cheap station labour was gone for ever. At the
first news of gold, before the occurrence and size of the
deposits could be gauged, Governor Fitzroy expected a glutting of
the labour market by the rush of voluntary immigrants, most of
whom he thought doomed to disappointment. The assistance of
migration by grants from the land revenue was dropped. But as
finds of fabulous riches succeeded one another in Victoria, the
difficulty of manning the stations and shearing the sheep grew
acute. The cessation of assistance to immigrants was
countermanded. New South Wales, shorn of its rich Port Phillip
District and bereft of its most vigorous sons by the rush to its
own and the Victorian diggings, was hard put to it to maintain
the staple industry. Wages rose to unheard-of levels, especially
in districts near the Victorian border. In 1854 shepherds were
asking £40 a year with rations, and farm labourers
£50; while in Sydney carpenters were getting as much as a
pound a day, and masons and plasterers 30<i>s</i>., when employed
on the urgent tasks of building houses and business premises for
the swelling population.</p>
<p>These, and the even higher rates paid in Melbourne, were not
to last; only skilled tradesmen could command the high
day-wages. And the advance in station wages was largely covered
by the increased value of wool, which rose to 13.3<i>d</i>. in
1853 and 17.7<i>d</i>. in 1854, and by the keen demand for
butcher's meat at high prices. Yet the sheep-men felt the threat
of a new restlessness; their men had become unwilling to engage
for long terms. Why, indeed, should a shepherd tie himself to the
dullest servitude with El Dorado a few score miles away, and
nuggets as big as eggs or footballs awaiting a lucky blow by the
first-comer's pick? The contrast between the monotony of station
employment and the roaring life of the diggers' camps makes
intelligible the renewal of restlessness among the "hands" at
every word of a new find. One need hardly go beyond that contrast
to see how gold accentuated the harsh relations between squatters
and labour, and the Australian antipathy to regular pastoral
employment. A general exodus from the stations released from its
baleful associations all who by hook or crook could gain a living
in the mining camps and port towns. The number of "shepherds and
persons engaged in the management of sheep" fell, it is
estimated,* from 27,000 in 1851 to about 20,000 in 1856, in spite
of considerable recruiting of assisted immigrants.</p>
<p class="foot">[* By T. A. Coghlan, in <i>Labour and Industry in
Australia</i>, p. 680.]</p>
<p>For several years the pastoral industry barely held to its
pre-gold size. With the aid of immigrants, of aborigines, and of
the dulled and unenterprising remnant who would not or could not
break away from old ways, sheep were somehow shorn; they could
not be washed, so the wool was sent home in the grease. Great
numbers of stock were sold as butcher's meat to the new
populations on the "fields"; this occasioned a steady shifting of
sheep and cattle into Victoria. Yet the total of flocks there
declined during the period 1851 to 1861. There was no great
increase in the total number of sheep in Australia, though
seasons were not unfavourable. In 1851 there had been 17,450,000
in all the colonies. By 1861, when the stations were again
employing as many men as "before the gold", and flocks were again
increasing fast, the total was less than 21,000,000.</p>
<p>The limiting factor throughout the decade had been labour. In
1856 one person was employed per 950 sheep: the quota in 1851 had
been one per 650. In South Australia, from which the exodus had
been almost general, each shepherd was tending in 1856 an average
of 2500 sheep. Such tending was so near to a formality that the
question pressed whether the shepherd might not be eliminated
altogether. John McArthur, in his experimental way, had tried
leaving sheep out in the open, but the wet climate of the coast
gave them foot-rot, catarrh and other ills. The dingo, too, was
very prevalent there in his day, and given to worrying and
killing sheep for sheer love of hunting or mischief. In the drier
interior, now the main and almost the only scene of Australian
sheep runs, many an anxious squatter had noted that little harm
befell sheep left out at night by careless shepherds, so long as
the wild dogs were absent. In the late 'fifties, Victorian
squatters, especially those who had attained the security of
freehold, began under the pressure of the labour shortage to
fence their holdings. Increasing population made the
extermination of the dingoes practicable, and there were manifold
gains to be made and only one danger to be feared in fencing the
runs into paddocks. They had found out Australia's greatest
advantage in the raising of sheep and wool. It is the one wide
area where sheep can safely be left to run wild for months on
end.</p>
<p>The gains by fencing were such that it quickly repaid those
who could face the heavy initial cost. Primarily it did away with
the crabbed old shepherds. Fewer men ** of a more dependable
type, the mounted boundary-riders, took their place. Often they
found their own horses and saddlery. Married men, in Victoria and
the central division of New South Wales at least, would keep a
cow and cultivate a garden. The effects of the change upon the
sheep were even more important and, proved to be cumulative. Not
being daily driven back and forth over the dusty and bare area
extending hundreds of yards around each folding-place, they were
less parched and worried. Hence they produced better grown
fleeces, and there was no imperative need to wash them before
shearing. Merinos are by no means as gregarious as most breeds,
and when left to camp or roam, they did not destroy the herbage
nor waste their energies needlessly.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Earl of Belmore to Duke of Buckingham, 12
August 1868. "The reduction caused by fencing in the number of
persons employed permanently upon a run may be estimated at 80
per cent." In an Appendix to the Nisbet MSS. Gregson estimates
the reduction at 10 per cent. only.]</p>
<p>The one danger was that of increased losses by fire. "When the
flocks were shepherded the area grazed was kept tolerably short
and within considerable radius of the stations there was but
little grass to burn. In any case the stock were under safe and
handy control. In the wide and spacious paddocks, however, the
sheep were anywhere and everywhere. In good seasons there was an
abundant coat of grass over all the run, not fed bare in any
place particularly, so that there was little protection against
fire for either run or sheep." *** The danger was greatest in the
grassy plains of the Victorian River valleys, in the Riverina
District between the Murray and Murrumbidgee, on the Western
Slopes and the Queensland Downs. The mountain pastures were
moister and in the mulga country out west the bushes and dwarf
trees which provide the "top feed" are usually too wide apart to
let a fire travel. The menace of fire in the best sheep country,
however, taught every good bushman to smother the embers of his
camp-fire before breaking camp, and made safety matches which
"strike only on the box" preferable to the older wax vestas. That
one danger among the many economies due to fencing led the
squatters to view without regrets the thinner spreading of the
country population when shepherding declined.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Nisbet MSS. (Mitchell Library), "Notes on
Fencing" by J. Gregson.]</p>
<p>Different kinds of fence were used according to the materials
to hand. Log fences helped to pack away much dead timber in the
ring-barked country. In open forest many a hundred miles of
post-and-rail fences were put up by the ex-diggers who, when
alluvial gold became scarce, took fencing contracts rather than
don the blue overalls of miners on wages. All through the plains
wire fencing was the rule. The ex-diggers won the admiration of
the squatters by their energy, the pride that would not accept
sundowners' meals without payment, and their relative success in
refusing to be "lambed down" at bush shanties. They fenced
paddocks which grew larger and larger as the carrying capacity
grew lighter "out-back"&mdash;where paddocks of 20 or 40 thousand
acres are not rare. Then they went on their way. While they
fenced, little out-back towns were busy handling fencing
materials and stores. Sleep deeper than ever came upon Dandaloo
and Nevertire when the fencers went farther north.</p>
<p>Developed in Victoria during the late 'fifties, the new method
became at once the vogue where wages were highest, spread through
New South Wales in the 'sixties and to Queensland in the
'seventies. The isolated and poverty-bound Western Australians
began log-fencing in their timber-covered land during the late
'eighties, and are still busy wire-netting against dogs in the
mulga country where miners' curs have mated with and strengthened
the native dingoes.</p>
<p>The pastoral industry owes much, however, to that same
Australian dingo. It is proverbial among the boundary riders that
a good dog is equal to three men; and you may see under the
verandah of the "store" in any outback Australian town a type of
dog, lean, smooth-haired, prick-eared, ill at ease because of the
folk about, watching eagerly for its master. That is the kelpie,
a breed which dates back at most to the eighteen-sixties, but one
so fashioned to the conditions of "the wool track" that it saves
the squatter as much labour as his most expensive fences, and
provides the boundary-rider with his favourite subject of
conversation, when he has any. With small flocks constantly
"worked" the collie served, but out on the great plains he has
neither the stamina nor the habits required. "No day is too hot,
or cold, or long for the kelpie. Endowed with muscles of steel
and a coat that defies all weathers, he finds it all the same
whether the heat be 110° in the shade or the biting winds and
sleeting rains are sweeping across the plains and chilling the
larger stock to the bone. Away on either wing, far enough out for
the wild merino sheep not to take fright and so split in all
directions, he gallops with his long tireless stride; or when his
wisdom tells him that they need it, stops and stands like a
statue facing them, then drops to the ground for a space and
creeps towards them like a dingo stalking game till they turn and
go the way he wishes. . . . The one thing that can upset the
kelpie's working is the bindi-eye, a wretched little
three-cornered thorn which grows on the plains and sticks in his
feet; but when this happens the owner shoes him with little boots
of basil, and he goes on working as usual." * Of the four types
of kelpie&mdash;black-and-tan, blue, red, and "barb" or
black&mdash;all owe much to a Victorian black-and-tan sheep bitch
named "Kelpie", whose appearance and quiet working plainly told
of dingo blood. Among true kelpies, only barbs bark when working
sheep, and they are fitted for cross-breds rather than for the
wilder Merinos. The original barb was so called after the black
horse called "The Barb" that won the Melbourne Cup the year he
was born (1866) near Forbes, out of Sally, one of Kelpie II's
pups. But the sheep men are not as proud nowadays of their dogs'
pedigrees as they might be with advantage.</p>

<p>Prices of New South Wales wool ruled high in the 'sixties,
twice averaging over 19<i>d</i>. a pound in the grease, and only
twice below 16<i>d</i>. prior to 1869 when they fell to
12.9<i>d</i>. and to 9.9<i>d</i>. during the Franco-Prussian War.
After a sharp recovery in 1872-3 they steadied at about
12<i>d</i>. a pound during the decade from 1876 to 1885.
Victorian greasy wool brought a few pence more in most seasons.
The lower level after 1873 may be attributed in part to a higher
demand for gold by Europe which was turning monometallic. Men
gave more goods for a unit of gold and thus all prices stated in
gold trended downwards, especially as gold production decreased.
A special cause of lower wool values was the continued increase
in the production of wool on fenced stations and on the backs of
better-bred sheep.</p>
<p>An indirect benefit of "paddocking" was that run-owners had
more time and money to apply to the improvement of their flocks.
The average weight of the fleeces cut in New South Wales rose to
5 lb. 7 oz. in the grease or 2 lb. 9½ oz. scoured in 1880,
and to 5 lb. 11¾ oz. in grease or 3 lb. 4½ oz.
scoured in 1890. As the number of sheep in the colony also rose
from 6,119,163 in 1860 to over 35,000,000 in 1880 and nearly
56,000,000 in 1890, the amount of wool coming on the market was
large enough to test its powers of absorption even though new
countries were sending their buyers to London and, as
communications improved, to the showrooms of Melbourne and Sydney
too. So squatters turned on their "account sales" the same
critical scepticism which had served them well when they reshaped
Spanish and German methods of running sheep, and cut their own
costs to the minimum by fencing. They began to scrutinise the
charges made for brokerage, tare and draft, entry and warrants,
commission et cetera.</p>
<p>At first the "pure merinos" had followed John McArthur's
example in sending their wool to be auctioned by London selling
brokers. At Garroway's in Change Alley, Cornhill&mdash;the very
coffee-house from which Mr Pickwick sent Mrs Bardell that
compromising letter about chops and tomato
sauce&mdash;Australian, Saxon and Spanish wools were sold a lot
at a time, "at per lb., bids to advance one penny". The daily
session lasted while an inch of candle burned.* After 1835,
however, the increased scale of the consignments from New South
Wales and Van Diemen's Land led to regular auctions at the Royal
Exchange to which Germans came to buy rather than to sell. The
London selling brokers, by pamphlet, by word of mouth to
home-visiting squatters, and by letter, did much to teach their
clients nicety in the arts of washing, pressing and sorting the
clip.** Washing, if overdone, gave the wool a harsh and staring
appearance&mdash;it was better to have too much yolk than too
little. Too tight a pressing with the screw matted together all
parts of the fleece so that it required a man's force to separate
one from another in the bale and produced a noise like the
tearing of coarse linen. "With the chance of having, this market
to yourselves you Australians should be doubly careful in getting
up wool. . . . Some of the fine marks have acquired a preference
with buyers principally from the various qualities and
descriptions being kept by themselves." ***</p>

<p>The brokers were certainly capable schoolmasters on the
"get-up" of the clip, but were they as effective in securing for
the grower its full market value? When the novelty of Australian
wool had worn off and the quantity had increased, there were
signs that it was not bringing the best price by public auction.
Bales bought in at Garroway's and sold privately made an advance
on several occasions, once of no less than 20 per cent. Squatters
asked indignantly, whether the opinion prevailed among buyers
that Botany Bay wool-growers wanted money and must sell at once?
Those in that unhappy position might be bound to sell their wool
through local merchants as a condition of obtaining stores on
credit.**** As early as 1823, Sydney commercial houses were
purchasing and consigning wool to London. But the "pure merinos"
knew too much of the tradition of the New South Wales Corps to
sell through such intermediaries. For a generation they bore with
the London brokers, despite their qualms. In the 'fifties the
time involved in a journey to London grew less. The clippers
attracted by the gold rushes took only half the hundred and forty
days reckoned usual with the old frigate-built Indiamen.*****
Squatters, visiting "home" more easily, began to look more
closely into the customs of the London brokers.</p>
<p class="foot">[**** <i>Hobler Papers</i>, vol.
<small>VI</small>, pp. 147-9, 27 April 1843. "Watson and Wight to
my great relief were disposed to give me the assistance I
required upon the pledge of my shipping my wool through their
house and melting my stock at their establishment; I to pay
2½ per cent. for their endorsement to bills and 5 per
cent. (per four months) for cash they might be called upon to
advance." Cf. Nisbet MS. (Mitchell Library): "The biggest
handicap to the pioneer settlers was the rate of interest that
they had to pay on the money they had to borrow in order to carry
on. . . . I found a friend of mine, who was a capital manager and
judge of stock but no book-keeper, was paying 17½ per
cent. in addition to the obligation of getting all his stores
from the same firm at their own prices".]</p>

Aberdeen White Star Line, ran from Start Point to Melbourne in 63
days 17 hours. In 1852 came the P. &amp; O. steamer
'Chusan'.]</p>
<p>The more prominent of the brokers were joined in an
association styled "The New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land
Commercial Association". Its members, so a band of inquiring
pastoralists reported, had made it their study, by deliberations
and conferences, to acquire an intimate knowledge of every matter
of importance affecting wool, and to continue to act in
protection of the permanent interests of the entire trade. The
inquiring squatters were evidently dubious of the brokers'
qualifications for their high calling. "It may not be out of
place", they commented drily, "to observe that the association's
unremitting and valuable services to the flockowner might acquire
a readier recognition if its proceedings were better known, and a
larger body of importers enrolled among its members".* Shortly
afterwards the association changed its name to "The Colonial Wool
Merchants' Association", but it remained an alliance of selling
brokers. Manufacturers and growers were excluded. Its customs
forbade bids of less than a half-penny, and the disclosure of the
successful bidder's name. Much wool, it was suspected, was
knocked down to the selling broker's own employees, and
manufacturers might obtain wool only through buying brokers or
wool-staplers.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Report of Committee on Sales of Australian
Wools in London</i>, February 1870.]</p>
<p>Warehousing methods, too, came in for criticism. A Riverina
pastoralist who insisted on seeing his Booligal clip weighed into
the warehouse in London found an increase on its colonial weight
of no less than 5298 lb. for the 938 bales, worth 2<i>s</i>.
4<i>d</i>. a pound in London. Hitherto this increase in weight
had been masked by wasteful sampling and unchecked weighing, so
that London firms, it was said, picked up their office expenses
off the warehouse floors. When the associated brokers stiffly
refused, however, to modify their customs at the instance of the
colonial pastoralists, many of these turned to the local wool
sales in Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
<p>Local sales had sprung from small beginnings. Yorkshire buyers
had early scented the big profits that were being made by buying
small lots of wool direct from the growers. P. B. Whitfield, an
expert wool-buyer, was sent out to Sydney to sell a station and
remit the proceeds in the form of wool; finding the operation
lucrative, he remained in the land. Another, James Johnson,
landed in Sydney in 1838 and at his death in 1906 was worth
£216,000.</p>
<p>Wool might reach the coastal ports at any time throughout the
year. A bullock team seldom averaged more than twelve miles a
day, and rains might make the black-soil plains impassable for
weeks at a time. There were no telegraphs till the 'sixties nor
railways beyond the coastal areas until later. As soon as word
came of bullock-waggons toiling in with wool, the cash-buyers
rode out to "Jack Ireland's Corner", at the junction of the
Parramatta and Liverpool roads, or to "Bark Huts" on the way to
Liverpool. Having satisfied the owner-driver that his accoster
was not a bushranger&mdash;though the distinction seems to have
been a conventional one&mdash;the buyer would clamber on the
waggon' and slash the bales to inspect them, the owner pretending
utter indifference and refusing the first offer as of course. An
atmosphere more favourable to business might be reached in the
bar-parlour of the "Farmer's Home", "The Woolpack", "The Emu
Inn", or the "Square and Compass", while the working bullocks
were being watered at the Haymarket waterhole. What margins the
buyers could allow themselves in this unequal contest may be
gathered from Johnson's avowal that in one fortunate run of
prices he obtained at least double in London what he had paid in
Sydney for each and all of 8000 bales, with the solitary
exception of one lot for which he paid 6<i>d</i>. and received
only 10<i>d</i>. in return.</p>
<p>After 1843, however, this wayside selling was superseded by
local auction of small graziers' clips. An auctioneer named
Thomas Sutcliffe Mort began to include bales of wool in his
weekly general sales. His first wool-store, erected by the Tank
Stream in 1844, was a primitive affair without walls or
gates&mdash;just an iron roof, a single-bale weighing scales, and
a dump. But small growers found they secured better prices there
than at the Belmore inn-tables. Yet Sydney remained "a delightful
antediluvian hollow" during the decades when the colony's best
men were going north to the Darling Downs and beyond, or south to
the Riverina and Port Phillip. Richard Goldsbrough, a
wool-classer from Shipley in the West Riding, bettered Mort's
example by erecting at Melbourne stores on a scale undreamt of
before in Australia. His were the first properly lighted floors,
and in the thirty years after 1848 he spent over £100,000
on show-rooms and warehouses. In this, as in much else, Sydney
was for a time eclipsed by her wealthy southern rival.</p>
<p>When in the 'seventies the big squatters began to favour local
sales, Mort was still holding his weekly auctions in a low
two-storied building by Circular Quay. At the door a small boy
would jangle a bell for half an hour before the sale began. The
bidding went on in relative silence, save for the auctioneer's
eloquent exposition on the virtues of each lot. By nods, winks
and raisings of their pencils, the buyers sought to bid without
disclosing any keenness. An old-timer from their ranks, returning
after many years of retirement to witness a modern sale, shook
his head at the babel of tongues. "They make more noise, but we
made more money!" As wool came to market at all seasons, buyers
lived on the spot, and their ways were leisurely. Perhaps a buyer
would ask the auctioneer to stop a moment, while he went down to
have another look at the bales, set out on the ground-floor. The
request would always be granted; it put spirit into the
subsequent bidding. Or the auctioneer would appeal to the owner
as to the acceptability of the price offered, a practice which
once drew from a purple-faced grazier the stammering outburst,
"Don't you dare sell my wool for sevenpence. Don't you dare!"</p>
<p>Another oft-quoted <i>contretemps</i> was the occasion when
the wool-buyers' chairman demanded in market overt the withdrawal
of a lot of wool which had been found to contain rubbish in the
middle of the bales, and called for the name of its owner. The
auctioneer's finger pointing out a prominent Legislative
Councillor "did much to forward the cause of honest
packing.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** Many of these details are from a series of
articles on "The Romance of Wool-Selling" by R. J. W. in the
Sydney <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, Sept.&mdash;Nov. 1914.]</p>
<p>Thus by an incessant elimination of waste and wasters the
Australian pastoral industry kept up its competitive efficiency.
The full adjustment of the scene and method of marketing to the
world-wide demand for Australian wool came later. As Britain's
manufacturing leadership passed, wool-buyers from all nations
sought the local wool-sales.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX<br>
<br>
Free Colonies and Assisted Migration</h3>
<br>
<p><small>UNTIL</small> the eighteen-twenties the Governors had
been the "prime-movers" as the political affairs of New South
Wales and Van Diemen's Land. The price which Britain paid for the
clearing of her gaols was largely left to their discretion.
Macquarie, for instance, pursued for a decade policies of which
his superiors increasingly disapproved. Yet even Macquarie could
only postpone, he could not set aside the veto of a distant
oligarchy upon extensions of vice-regal expenditure. If it were
burked for a time, the call from Whitehall for greater economy
became all the more emphatic when unmuffled. Under Governor
Brisbane there was such retrenchment in the public employment of
convicts that soon not a road in New South Wales remained in
repair, even by the rough standards then prevailing.</p>
<p>Britain no longer needed to pay for convicts' keep while
constructing public works. The squatters had become eager for
their assigned service on the inland "runs", and until assignment
ceased in 1839 the supply of convicts seldom exceeded even
momentarily the call for station hands. Wool had made the
squatters freer paymasters, in the sense that their doings were
subject to no ministerial veto. In the mass they were also
paymasters of more labour than Governor Macquarie had ever
employed.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* See generally on the convict population at
this time Samuel Butler's <i>Handbook for Australian
Emigrants</i> (1839), ch. <small>III</small>.]</p>
<p>Though the assigned servants were bondsmen, the way was
plainly opening by which the prison settlements would become
colonies of free men. The changed status of the leading free
colonists was politically recognized by the institution in 1823
of a Legislative Council to which seven and, after 1825, fifteen
of them were summoned to advise the Governor. The first step in
the political education of substantial householders followed in
1824, when trial by jury was at last substituted for the
semi-military procedure of earlier days.</p>
<p>Restriction and free enterprize are always hard to mix. The
essentials of prison life as then understood were confinement and
close supervision; these were maintained with difficulty when New
South Wales and Van Diemen's Land were no more than open,
isolated prisons. But the comings and goings of busy wool-ports
were quite incompatible with such discipline. Brisbane sent
Surveyor-General John Oxley to spy out new sites for the main
prison. In 1823 Oxley picked upon Moreton Bay, named the fine
river there after the Governor and supervised the founding of a
new penal settlement under Captain Logan, the perfect martinet.**
In England, however, other counsels prevailed. After a period of
limited continuance in Van Diemen's Land and Norfolk Island to
1853, and then in Western Australia from 1851 to 1867,
transportation was abandoned as inconsistent with the healthy
growth of free communities. Between Bigge's Reports of 1823 and
that of the Commons Committee in 1839 Australia passed from the
eighteenth century into the nineteenth.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Concerning his labours and tragic death
compare the accounts given by T. A. Coghlan, <i>op. cit</i>. p.
156 and the <i>Australian Encyclopaedia</i>, vol.
<small>I</small>, p. 762.]</p>
<p>Many currents mingled and eddied at the turn of the tide. At
Westminster the ruling aristocracy's ambition to hold imperial
sway, though chastened by the loss of the American colonies, was
swelled afresh by the aggressive philanthropy of the middle
class. Industrial triumphs were giving a new dimension to British
trade and the middle class felt itself called to spread
civilization&mdash;some according to the evangelical gospel, some
according to the principles of political economy&mdash;through
all lands and climates. This new social and political partnership
at Westminster made practicable experiments in free colonization
with land grants at the Swan River and in systematic free
colonization around Adelaide. It also made possible the rapid
success of the anti-transportation movement, the clumsy essays in
state-aided migration, the maternal crusading of Caroline
Chisholm and, finally, whether as a gesture of despair or as a
daring venture of faith, the grant of colonial
self-government.</p>
<p>The new prosperity based on wool put a speedy stop to free
land grants. Both bases of that system&mdash;the grant of areas
proportioned to social standing and the payment of quit-rents to
the Crown after a few years of development&mdash;had long been
crumbling. The plan had fitted the phase of experiment, when the
climate was a riddle and the land had no ascertained value, no
proved utility in production. But once free settlers came out in
force, eager to take up sheep runs, the grant and withdrawal of
land at the will of the Governor had become an anachronism. In a
colony sure of its future, investors of capital asked for
security of possession as the <i>sine qua non</i>. The change was
registered by the waiving in 1825 of the Governor's "permission
to settle", previously essential to free settlers as well as
expirees. With it went the Governor's power to "huff" a man's
land, which Macquarie had freely used against grantees guilty of
insobriety and even at the expense of some who petitioned the
House of Commons against him.* Oxley suggested the sale of any
area in excess of 2000 acres which a settler might require.
Combinations of free grant and sale were tried, but naturally led
to very few sales. Land grants were finally abolished in
1831.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Macquarie MSS. (Mitchell Library), "List
of Grants cancelled through Seditious Conduct".]</p>
<p>The years of transition witnessed the coming not only of
scores of individual capitalists but of more than one great
joint-stock company, These ventures, recalling seventeenth and
eighteenth century methods of colonization, aimed at exploiting
John McArthur's discoveries on bold lines. They did notable work
in exploring difficult country, both in New South Wales and in
N.W. Tasmania. They opened up a coal trade; they introduced Saxon
and Spanish sheep of the highest quality. According to a French
contemporary, Pilorgerie, the "gigantic enterprise of the
Australian Agricultural Company", which expended £300,000
in the northern area of New South Wales, "awakened public
attention and directed it towards Australia". But privileged
companies, exonerated from quit-rents on their huge estates
because they relieved the public of the expense of maintaining
thousands of convicts, sorted ill with the doctrines of natural
liberty and equal opportunity&mdash;at least for those with
property&mdash;which Adam Smith had popularized. Nor did their
resemblance to the East India Company help them with British
middle-class or Australian opinion.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** For accounts of the two principal companies,

Settlement".]</p>
<p>Philanthropists were critical, of the assignment of convicts
and of transportation generally. Wilberforce's long crusade
against negro slavery was soon to be followed by a sharp and
decisive attack on the export of criminals. Thus it fell out that
the last company projects, those of the Swan River Colony and
South Australia, ended in an odd mixture of private adventure and
public responsibility. As fields for investment they suffered by
this confusion of ideals, yet the delayed success of the latter
province showed the way to free colonization and sowed the seed
of self-government, though not in the drilled and systematic
lines its projectors first planned.</p>
<p>In April 1827 Governor Darling appealed for a permanent
settlement on the Swan River. Glowing accounts of the fertile
soil there had come from Captain Stirling, R.N., who visited it
after revictualling a military post under Major Lockyer sent in
1826 to guard King George's Sound against French occupation. The
Colonial Office, at first favourable, drew back in fear of the
expense of founding a free colony. In November 1828 a syndicate,
including Thomas Peel, Sir Francis Vincent, Colonel Potter
McQueen and E. W. H. Schenley, offered to settle 10,000 persons
there and to provision them for four years if granted land at
1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. an acre in return for their expenditure.
This they estimated at £300,000 and they asked for four
million acres. They had in mind a proprietary colony like
Pennsylvania. To set the ball of production rolling they planned
to give each male settler 200 acres out of their grant. The
balance they would sell as production gathered momentum and the
demand for more land grew.</p>
<p>The Colonial Office virtually destroyed their project, first
by limiting the grant to a maximum of one million acres, and then
by issuing regulations (December 1828) which threw open to
everyone the whole area of the colony. Not only the projectors,
but any who brought out property for the occupation and
development of the land, were to receive 40 acres for every
£3 thus invested. Grants proportioned to property had long
been the rule at Sydney, but the application of such a rule where
there was as yet no centre was fatal to the syndicate's plan. It
had thought to create such a centre and to draw profit from a
monopoly of the land around it. How else could it recoup initial
expense? All but Peel saw that this scheme would fail, and
withdrew.</p>
<p>The colonists who went out in 1829 included, according to
Governor Stirling, "more than the usual number of men of property
and family". Both rich and poor expected, from Stirling's account
of the soil and vegetation, to find rich loams and succulent
native grasses. They looked about for open plains and park-like
downs on which to repeat the rapid progress as pastoralists which
had so lately fallen to the lot of many in New South Wales. If
some "expected the moment their feet touched the shore to find
inns, turnpike roads, smiling orchards and cornfields in a
country untrod by civilized man", this only showed how few can
picture the complex, unending drudgery involved in beginning at
the beginning&mdash;in clearing the virgin forest and building up
by faith and toil and sheer fatigue the setting of a good life
for others. The officials of Whitehall had not made much progress
between 1786 and 1828 in imagining the task.</p>
<p>The first-comers took up the best land they could find along
the coastal rivers&mdash;the Swan and the Canning, the
Serpentine, the Murray and the Harvey. Little of it was good
land, and they went far afield in search of better. Their
homesteads were scattered over a coastal plain with few areas of
loam, where through the long hot summer land-transport over deep
sand tracks is exceptionally arduous. Two defects beat down their
high hopes: lack of grassy plains on which to depasture flocks
and herds, and lack of labourers. Grasses are markedly absent
from the forest floor of the great belt of "mahogany" or jarrah
along the escarpment behind the sandy coastal plain. Even where
they found grass under the open tuart trees on the limestone
hills nearer the Western Coast, the amazing contrast between the
dry desolation of summer and the verdure of the wet, mild winter
caught them unprepared. The lack of labour was paralysing to
middle-class folk accustomed to over-populated England.</p>
<p>Edward Gibbon Wakefield&mdash;fixing his attention on the
failure of Thomas Peel, who landed 900 settlers, spent
£50,000 and quickly reduced himself to beggary and
isolation&mdash;attributed all these evils to the 1828
regulations, as he, from Newgate Prison, imagined their working.
But the picture he painted to a Commons Committee on Waste Lands,
though admirable as propaganda for his own system of
colonization, slurred over other reasons for Peel's misfortunes.
Peel, though a cousin of the great Sir Robert, was no leader. The
land was unsuited to sheep and hardly less so to cattle. Poison
plants killed scores of stock. Both stock and settlers were
speared by blacks. The more experienced farmers, such as the
Hentys, after a hurried search for better land, re-emigrated to
Van Diemen's Land. The die-hards, facing terrible natural
obstacles to pioneering, put up a grim and for long a doubtful
struggle. Pastoral production grew very slowly out of
explorations that revealed an almost waterless interior.</p>
<p>Wakefield told how the 1828 regulations gave priority to the
grantees of immense estates, separated the settlers by "great
deserts", condemned some to die of hunger because they did not
know where to find the governor's house and food, and the
governor to impotence because he did lot know where to find his
poor subjects. Too long his fancies passed current as an
historical account of this "scarecrow of colonization".*
Wakefield was bred to the trade of a land-agent. In writing about
the Swan River Colony he was concerned far less with truth than
with a background against which he might depict the harmonies of
"systematic colonization", his own panacea.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See R. C. Mills's admirable book, <i>The
Colonization of Australia</i>, 1829-42, pp. 64-72.]</p>
<p>Success in starting a free colony, he held, depended on
selling land at a "sufficient price". Out of the land-sales fund
the immigration of labourers should be subsidized. These, unlike
Peel's men, would be impelled to remain in service by their
inability to pay for land a price deliberately raised high enough
to baulk their land-hunger. Till they had served an
apprenticeship in colonial conditions and saved the "sufficient
price" of a little farm, these free labourers were to be the
"combinable labour" for lack of which the respectable Swan
settlers had endured such woes. A colony adopting Wakefield's
plan would escape all tribulation. The "sufficient price" would
adapt the supply of labour to the supply of land, Land
sales&mdash;assisted immigration&mdash;more sales&mdash;more
labour, and the thing was done. In truth, it was to Utopia.</p>
<p>The experiment of a Wakefield colony at Australind, on Koombana
Bay, a hundred miles south of the River, should have been decisive
in showing the virtues of the "sufficient price". Land there was
sold at a pound an acre, surely a "sufficient price". Otherwise
the conditions were remarkably similar to those on the Swan.
There were labourers in plenty at Australind in 1842, effectually
prevented by the "sufficient price" from buying the
land&mdash;combinable labour or landless proletariat after the
best English model.** Yet the cycle of land sales and subsidized
migration would not revolve. Once the character of the soil and
the problem of marketing its produce had been tested, the
Australind Company could not dispose of its blocks at 2<i>s</i>.
an acre. The land market was glutted in Western Australia;
earlier buyers were willing to cut their losses and sell at a
farthing an acre.</p>
<p class="foot">[** For the story of the Australind Settlement,
see Miss E. L. Burgess's paper in the <i>Report of the 1926
Meeting (Perth) of the A.A.A.S</i>. pp. 478-96.]</p>
<p>Such stumbling was perhaps inevitable in a territory of
"mottled" soils, like Western Australia. After all the puffing
and booming, land values must be based on the net production, a
singularly individual fact which varies widely from block to
block. The control or fixing of a uniform and sufficient price
for all the land in a colony, by a group of gentlemen around a
table on the other side of the globe, necessarily imported into
its sale the atmosphere of a lottery. And when all the previous
numbers had proved to be blanks, the interest of the public in
the lottery naturally grew cold. But Australind was an
afterthought, a trial of the Wakefield plan in a scene damned in
advance by his own propaganda of earlier years.</p>
<p>Wakefield's system for the planting of free colonies dated
back to a dismal picture he had sketched in Newgate during 1829
of the plight of well-to-do settlers in New South Wales. On his
release in 1830, he set himself to use the growing interest in
Australia and the longstanding concern over British unemployment
as the bases of an experiment in systematic colonization in an
unspoilt field. Free grants of land were not only wasteful now
that wool was booming; they were also offensive to the political
opponents of privilege. In January 1831 the new Whig Government
went half-way towards adopting Wakefield's plan when they
abolished grants and substituted sale as the sole means of
disposing of colonial land. But by that time 3,344,030 acres had
been granted in New South Wales, and 1,200,000 acres at the Swan
River. Ricardian principles were in the air and it was presumed
that the first-comers had picked the best land there. Wakefield,
therefore, behind the screen of propagandists, sought a virgin
field where his system of selection, concentration and sale of
land for the support of emigration might work unthwarted. The
area around St Vincent's Gulf and Encounter Bay&mdash;praised by
both Flinders and Baudin, remote alike from the iniquities of
Sydney and Hobart Town and from the miseries of Swan
River&mdash;had already attracted him when at the end of 1830
word came that Captain Sturt had traced the great inland rivers
to an outlet in that very region. To the enthusiasm Sturt
aroused, there ensued, as in the Swan River project, a conflict
between plans for a proprietary colony and precautions for public
control. Again the Colonial Office stumbled into an incoherent
compromise.</p>
<p>In June 1831 Anthony Bacon, a Peninsular and Waterloo veteran,
proposed a colony in South Australia that would cost Government
nothing. He was to be its Governor. Under-Secretary Hay, with the
Swan River on his mind, replied that such schemes were "always
liable to end in becoming in some way or other a source of
expense to the revenue of this country". Then the Wakefield group
put forward proposals for a proprietary company which should
quickly transform itself into a self-supporting free colony. The
Company was to raise half a million of capital, to spend a
quarter of this on buying land in the colony, and another
£125,000 on advances to settlers. The other half of its
capital it was to employ directly on its own land. A Governor
recommended by the Company, but appointed by the Crown, was to
have despotic authority until the population reached 5000. When
they numbered 5000 and could meet the expenses of their
government, they should be allowed annually elected Assemblies,
liberty of the press, freedom of trade, no interference with
religion, and a militia of all adult males for purposes of
defence.</p>
<p>Such ideas seemed to the Colonial Office "wild and
impracticable". Prompted by its Counsel, Mr James Stephen, it
objected to "transfer to this Company and ultimately to a popular
assembly the sovereignty of a vast unexplored territory, and
erect within the British Monarchy a government purely
republican". Wakefield, blaming the Whig chiefs for the
opposition, commented drily: "If the Company should revive their
project they would do well to put a House of Lords into it, with
a Baron Blackswan, a Viscount Kangaroo, a Marquis of
Morrumbidgee, and a Bishop of Ornithorhyncus".</p>
<p>At the end of 1833 Captain. Sturt came in person to the aid of
the projectors, impressing the value of South Australia and
urging that the Murray River navigation must be "the grand
attraction of the Scheme", Suspicions of the promoters'
money-making designs were smothered by the adoption of a form of
government by officials. Thereafter events moved quickly. In 1834
a South Australian Association successfully lobbied through
Parliament an Act (4 &amp; 5 W. IV, c. 95) to establish the
British Province of South Australia. The crux of the compromise
was to be a Board of Commissioners appointed by the Crown to
manage land sales and migration on Wakefield's lines.* Initial
expenses of foundation were to be met out of a loan of
£200,000 to be raised on the future revenues of the
Province, with the land fund as collateral security. Colonization
was to begin after £35,000 worth of land had been sold and
£20,000 lodged with the British Government as a guarantee
fund. The scheme was weak in that it divided responsibility.
Though the Commissioners raised the money for government as well
as for migration, the governing officials were not directly
responsible to them. It is true that the Commissioners could
enforce their views by their control of the purse, but only with
a maximum of friction and mutual antagonism.</p>
<p class="foot">[* For a summary of the provisions of the Act see
R. C. Mills, <i>op. cit</i>. p. 233.]</p>
<p>The ablest of the Commissioners, George Fife Angas, resigned
in 1833 to form a South Australian Company. This was a purely
private venture, not to be confused with the 1831 project of a
proprietary company to found and rule the colony. Angas's
Company, with a capital of £320,000, made extensive
purchases of land which gave the movement a decisive fillip. He
was a man of capacity and imagination, witnessed by his share in
founding more than one Australian Bank.** At the very start his
care included the education of settlers' children, and in 1838 he
succeeded in attracting to the new colony over 600 Lutheran
zealots. By the end of 1830, 6000 more had followed them. Their
descendants have played a very honourable part, especially in the
active agriculture of the Province. Few of the colonial leaders,
however, equalled Angas in foresight. The officials and resident
Commissioner, by wrangling over every step preliminary to the
settlers' private exertions, almost brought the settlement to a
standstill.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The Union Bank of Australia and the Bank of
South Australia, as well as the National Provincial of

<p>Some officials were energetic and competent, notably Colonel
William Light, the Surveyor-General. Others were not, and were
distracted from their duties by the leave to trade, which in a
spirit of false economy had been granted to eke out small
salaries. Arriving in August 1836, only a few weeks in advance of
the first fleet of colonists, Light had to choose the site of the
first town, to survey it and also the country blocks so that the
first subscribers might exercise their right of "first choice of land
throughout the Colony". Foremost in importance was the decision to
be made between (i) the coast of Gulf St Vincent, praised by Flinders,
(ii) Port Lincoln, considered by one of Baudin's officers a
harbour worthy to rival Port Jackson, and (iii) the Murray Mouth,
<i>prima facie</i> the key to a great riverine hinterland. To
Governor Hindmarsh's surprise he found when he arrived (28
December 1836) that Light had chosen the present site of
Adelaide, attracted by a fair harbour and an abundance of fertile
open land. Contention raged, but Light's choice was upheld
against the Governor and the Company's local representative by a
big majority of the settlers, now numbering 600 (Feb. 1837). But
his progress in surveying was beset by demands from investors
that he should mark out the lots in the first town, Adelaide,
before measuring land for farms, and hindered by the preference
of the unacclimatized farmers for pockets of good land in the
cool Mount Lofty ranges, rather than on the Adelaide plains.</p>
<p>Rapid arrivals of colonists caused the demands for land to
accumulate. Light's request for more surveyors, voiced by his
deputy G. S. Kingston, drew from the Commissioners nothing but
criticisms and absurd instructions to expedite the work.* Light
resigned, and few of his staff would take service under Kingston.
The survey broke down. The would-be-farmers missed the favourable
seasons of 1838-9 and 1839-40, when they might well have been
able to export wheat to drought-stricken New South Wales. Much
capital, badly needed for development, was spent on the import of
foodstuffs at high prices. Denied practical use of an evidently
fertile territory, the colonists turned to wild speculation in
town lots. Governor and Commissioner, still quarrelling, were
recalled, and in October 1838 Colonel George Gawler took charge
as both Governor and Resident Commissioner. The population of
3680 had been concentrated all too successfully; they were almost
all in Adelaide.</p>
<p class="foot">[* For some detail of the part played by the
incompetent Kingston see A. Grenfell Price, <i>Foundation and
Settlement of South Australia</i>, pp. 75-8, 85-8. This work
supersedes all earlier accounts.]</p>
<p>Gawler saved the situation. In place of Kingston, who "left
the service to perform duties of equally dubious value as City
Engineer",** Captain Sturt, who had sold his station at Mittagong
in New South Wales and brought cattle overland from the Murray,
was set to survey the country lands. A staff was gathered from
Light's men, from the eastern colonies, and a belated detachment
of sappers. Then the work was retarded and disorganized by some
thirty special surveys, giving big purchasers their pick of
450,000 acres from the unappropriated land. But even this meant
progress in the pastoral use of the Province. Overlanders,
beginning with Joseph Hawdon (3 April 1838), were rapidly
stocking the excellent open pasture lands. By December 1840 there
were 4400 people in the country districts, 8000 acres under
cultivation, 67,000 cattle and a quarter of a million sheep. More
came overland than sheep and cattle. Runaway convicts were of
good service as sawyers at a time when building and fencing
materials were very scarce, but their turbulent doings in the
Mount Lofty Ranges made an inopportune call on the colony's
slender funds for extra police.***</p>
<p class="foot">[** A. G. Price, <i>op. cit</i>. p. 133. Cf. p.
178, for his supervision of the construction of a Government
Wharf at Port Adelaide.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** See A. G. Price, <i>op. cit</i>. p.
130.]</p>
<p>Perhaps because he knew that Stephen of the Colonial Office
expected the collapse of the Commissioners, Gawler went on with
free energy to repair the colony's lack of police, roads, harbour
and public buildings&mdash;"the necessary permanent outfit". In
2½ years he drew on the Commissioners for £270,000
not covered by the colony's revenue. Torrens, their leader, had
been inspired by Wakefield to object to the use of the land fund
for governmental expenses. It was reserved, somewhat
pedantically, for the sending of immigrants. The coming of these
in spate constantly forced Gawler into more urgent building. Yet
the Commissioners failed to borrow the balance (£120,000)
of the loan that had been authorized for first expenses of
government such as this. The antinomy between private adventure
and public authority inherent in the Foundation Act of 1834 was
still unresolved. In December 1839 Lord John Russell replaced the
South Australian Commissioners, who had asked him for salaries,
by a Colonial Land and Emigration Board which was to manage
migration to all British colonies. The change might promise an
extension of systematic colonization to all, but what was to be
done to relieve the congestion in Adelaide and to meet Governor
Gawler's bills?</p>
<p>While this problem was being fumbled at home, there came
adverse reports of the South Australian hinterland. It was but a
fertile island ringed by salt lakes. The colony's credit slumped.
When the new Board tried to raise the balance of the authorized
loan not a single subscriber offered. They refused (Sept. 1840)
to accept any more of Gawler's bills, ordered him to dismiss the
police, and asked the Colonial Office to take up the financial
burden. It refused. The colony was bankrupt and remained so until
after months of deliberation a Commons Committee recommended
government assistance. Gawler was recalled and superseded in May
1841 by Captain George Grey. With much gusto Grey exposed the
laxity of Gawler's control of expenditure. He put an end to its
demoralizing effects on the labourers who preferred Adelaide to
the bush and on the contractors who gaily swindled the distant
taxpayers of Britain. Yet Grey insisted on the payment of the
bills that had given the colony an effective start, and if his
policy of keeping public expense within the colonial revenue was
due and salutary, it must be recognised that Gawler had retrieved
the land situation, pushed on the surveys and settlement, and
left the Province "with all its problems solved save those of
unemployment and finance".*</p>
<p class="foot">[* A. G. Price, <i>op. cit</i>. p. 209. See, too,
his rehabilitation of Gawler's land policy, pp. 145-6, and works
expenditure, pp. 188, 194. Grey's success was built upon what
Professor Scott (<i>Short History of Australia</i>, p. 151) too
strongly terms "Gawler's failure".]</p>
<p>In the last resort the Province was saved by the quality of
its land and climate, which now enabled the settlers to produce
their earliest abundant harvests. Wakefield's system was well
adapted to finding funds and launching a colony by well-planned
puffing. Such puffing, however, provoked speculation. Raising the
sufficient price of land after a specified time only aggravated
that phase. Whether the colonists could make good their
investment or even survive it depended, of course, upon the
quality of the soil chosen. "The calibre of the early settlers",
wrote George Grey long after, "gave me trust in the new
Anglo-Saxondom of the Southern Hemisphere. There was a worth, a
sincerity, a true ring about them which could not fail of great
things." Anglo-Saxons in either hemisphere, and possibly others
too, are given to emphasizing the human merit behind success. But
the same human factor was present at the Swan River and its
outposts where success was slower to come.** South Australia had
the other essential, an endowment of agricultural land needing
small initial expense for clearing. Adelaide is within what
remains to this day the most uniform and continuous stretch of
first-class wheat land in Australia. At the end of 1842 a harvest
worth £98,000 was gathered, more than half of which was
exported. Such progress made the colonists sure of triumph over
temporary straits.</p>
<p class="foot">[** For an instance consider the persistence of
the Bussells, Turners and others in the face of defeat by the
big timber at the Leeuwin, <i>Cattle Chosen, passim</i>.]</p>
<p>Wheat exports oversea were not very profitable, however, and
New South Wales had now escaped from drought. Duties continued to
be levied in Britain on Australian wheat, while that of Canada
was being admitted free. The price in Adelaide during 1844 fell
as low as half-a-crown a bushel. Yet wages were maintained and
increased by the proving in that year of big deposits of copper
ore a little north of the capital town. Copper-mining at once set
up a new era of speculation and prosperity. No system of
migration nor minimum price for land could keep agricultural
labourers from turning miners at high wages on the Burra and
Kapunda lodes. But an ingenious young Northumbrian saved the
farmers. He greatly reduced the cost of producing grain by
inventing, out of a hint from Livy and ancient Gaul, a
horse-driven machine that stripped the ears only. Ridley's
"stripper" made feasible a profitable export trade in wheat and
was a masterstroke in reconciling high wages with low costs. In
this it antedated fencing in the pastoral industry by several
years.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** A. S, Ridley, <i>A Backward Glance</i>
(1904), collects the evidence as to the origin of Ridley's
stripper and its claim to priority over other South Australian
attempts at a solution. According to David Gordon, <i>The Central
State</i>, Ridley's stripper reduced the cost of harvesting from
2<i>s</i>. per bushel to 3½<i>d</i>. or from £2 an
acre to 5<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. for a 20 bushel crop.]</p>
<p>In South Australia, as subsequently in every colony, mining
played a most useful part in attracting colonists. Looking back
into the past, a South Australian attempted in 1892 to state a
norm of Australian settlement, departure from which had always
brought difficulty. "The proper order of events is first pastoral
occupation of large areas&mdash;practically detailed exploration
of new territory: then mining in the all too few localities where
minerals exist: then the gradual subdivision and development of
the land for higher utilization".**** Every historical formula
carries an insidious suggestion that its phases occur inevitably
and automatically. This is not so. Western Australia, for
instance, with its minerals in arid country, had to wait long for
the miners and for adequate people and wealth to develop her
refractory though rich resources. To South Australia the miners
early brought their unsystematic but strengthening impetus. As
soon as the copper and silver ores found in 1843 had been proved,
capital and labour flowed again into the Province. Where minerals
were known to exist, Governor Grey delayed for the maximum of
three months the sale of the "waste lands" containing them in
order to ensure active bidding. "A few weeks ago", reported an
astonished merchant in May 1845, "a hundred acres of land
adjoining a copper mine at work, distant fifty miles from this,
was sold at the Government sale for £2201 . . . Adelaide is
now obtaining a good name amongst our hitherto jealous
neighbours." But private knowledge often ran ahead of government
precautions, and two areas of 20,000 acres of metalliferous land
were bought at the minimum price of £1 an acre.</p>
<p class="foot">[**** Quoted by Stephen Roberts, <i>Land
Settlement</i>, p. 289, from Holder, a South Australian
squatter.]</p>
<p>Governor Robe, Grey's successor, was baulked in an attempt to
secure by royalties a public share in the profits of mining. A
legal decision ruled that his insertion of a clause in
land-titles, reserving to the Crown a fifteenth of the value of
metals won, was inconsistent with the statute governing such
titles. And the Legislative Council would not amend the Act. A
Land League was formed among leading buyers which kept down
competitive bidding and divided by lot what was bought.</p>
<p>The Province steadily gained in population and prosperity. By
August 1848 it had 38,666 inhabitants, and an ordinary revenue of
£82,411. Land sales since its foundation had totalled
£530,877. Western Australia at the same date had about 4600
colonists. The stagnation of trade and production there led this
handful of people to petition the Home authorities for convicts,
whose employment on roads and public buildings might galvanize
trade and improve the means of transport. The grant of their
petition and the arrival of the first prisoners at Fremantle in
June 1850, though worth a hundred thousand pounds a year of
Imperial expenditure, accentuated the contrast between Eastern
and Western Australia. For by that date the movement against
transportation had in the eastern colonies reached the eve of
complete success.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X<br>
<br>
From Transportation to Family Life</h3>
<br>
<p><small>DURING</small> the eighteen-thirties, Archbishop
Whately of Dublin led an effective attack on "the system of
transportation".* The sending of convicted men and women oversea,
he reasoned, neither deterred others from crime nor reformed the
criminals, and it hideously contaminated the new communities in
Australia. The British public and Parliament, roused by his
logic, were left unsatisfied by the apologies of Governor Arthur
(V.D.L.) and of Archdeacon Broughton (N.S.W.). A Select Committee
of the Commons reported in 1839 "that transportation to New South
Wales and to the settled districts of Van Diemen's Land should be
discontinued as soon as practicable". They found "inefficacy in
deterring from crime and remarkable efficiency in still further
corrupting those who undergo the punishment" to be inherent in
the system, and inveighed against the "monstrous evil of calling
into existence and continually extending societies or the germs
of nations most thoroughly depraved".</p>
<p class="foot">[* The subject-matter of this part of the chapter
is more adequately treated in Ernest Scott's <i>Short History of
Australia</i>, ch. <small>XVII</small>.]</p>
<p>In Sydney the prospect of abolition at first provoked
opposition rather than support. The Legislative Council,
representing the squatters and large employers, urged "that the
sudden discontinuance of transportation and assignment must
necessarily curtail the means of purchasing Crown Lands and
consequently the supply of funds for the purposes of
immigration". The Secretary of State paid small regard to this
special pleading, though he approved Governor Gipps' suggestion
to restrict assignment to the country districts, "as a step
towards the entire discontinuance of assignment throughout the
colony, at as early a period as practicable". More complex must
have been the motives of a Sydney public meeting (9 February
1839) which promoted a petition for continuance signed by 4000
people. Sir Timothy Coghlan attributes the petition to an
idiosyncrasy of the emancipists which led them to identify, their
self-respect with the retention of convictism. Vulgarity in a
king is said to flatter the majority of his subjects, and a
steady supply of criminals may have assured to the emancipists in
Sydney a social status often based on ill-gotten wealth. Colonial
opinion, however, whether bond or free, played at first a minor
part. The initiative came from British humanitarians.</p>
<p>The Order in Council which on 22 May 1840 abolished
transportation to New South Wales left Norfolk Island and Van
Diemen's Land as "penitentiaries" to which for the future only
long-sentence criminals were to be sent. At Norfolk Island,
Alexander Maconochie ** made trial of reformatory methods as
opposed to those of exemplary punishment. At Port Arthur and
Macquarie Harbour in Van Diemen's Land severity passed the limits
of human endurance, often driving warders and victims alike into
stark insanity.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See <i>Australian Encyclopaedia</i>, articles
on "Convicts", vol. <small>I</small>, pp. 301-2, and on
"Maconochie", vol. <small>II</small>, p. 14.]</p>
<p>Before Peel's reform of the criminal code had had little to
bear fruit, 4000 felons were still transported annually from
British prisons. "Mr Mother Country" still held it "indispensable
that within the Australian colonies receptacles should be found
for all the convicts and exiles who may be sent from this country
in execution of judicial sentences." This he considered "so
momentous an object of national policy that we can acknowledge no
conflicting motive as of sufficient importance to supersede it
The fate which the momentous object of national policy implied
for the "receptacles" had by 1846 become all too plain in Van
Diemen's Land. Apart from emancipists and expirees freed by
servitude, there were in the island 29,949 prisoners out of a
total population of 66,105. The plan by which, according to their
conduct, prisoners were drafted through probation gangs into
private employment had broken down. Squatters and farmers, in
spite of the working of a sort of Gresham's law that bond labour
drives out free, could not find places for the "good-conduct
men". Of 10,480 in the probation gangs, 3852 were due for
good-conduct passes into private service during the year, but
3509 of the 12,240 already holding such passes were still waiting
for masters.</p>
<p>On the mainland the threatened cessation of bond labour led
landowners to give ear to the suggestions of the Colonial Office
that some of the surplus convicts should be smuggled into New
South Wales under a modified "system". W. E. Gladstone, observing
the glut of labourers in the island and knowing that the
squatters north of Bass Straits were in need of labour, made
certain qualified and involved proposals to Governor Gipps.* "It
will be acceptable to Her Majesty's Government if the members of
the Legislative Council of the colony will show a disposition to
concur in the opinion that a modified and carefully regulated
introduction of convict labourers into New South Wales, or into
some part of it, may under the present circumstances be
advisable. It seems probable that we may again be approaching a
period&mdash;if indeed such period has not already
arrived&mdash;when the supply of free labour in the Australian
colonies is on the whole below the demand." A Committee of the
Legislative Council, under the chairmanship of William Charles
Wentworth, duly reported in favour of the revival of
transportation under Gladstonian safeguards (Oct. 1846). There
were to be no government gangs and no assignment in the towns.
This would placate immigrant labourers and artisans. Both
convicts and ticket-of-leave men were to be confined to the
country districts. For each male convict a female, free or
convict, was to be sent, and as many free migrants as prisoners.
Though quietly forwarded to England, the committee's report, when
published in Sydney, provoked a strong public outcry against any
form of transportation. Colonial opinion had by this time
hardened into virtually unanimous opposition to any renewal of
the system, and in September 1847 the Council repudiated the work
of its committee.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The text of the despatch may be read in the

<i>op. cit</i>. pp. 336-40. According to Ernest Scott, <i>Short
History of Australia</i>, p. 193, Mr Gladstone was a partner in a
Port Philip sheep station.]</p>
<p>While this was yet unknown in England, Earl Grey, Gladstone's
successor, had prescribed a way of diluting the bitter draught. He
suggested sending "ticket-of-leave men as exiles to New South
Wales, after they had serve the main part of their "times" in
British penitentiaries and on public works. Their wives and
families would be helped to join them, and free migrants sent in
equal numbers. But Earl Grey's plan involved the re-proclamation
of New South Wales as a "receptacle" for convicts. The step gave
rise to such an explosion of wrath in Sydney and Melbourne that
Governor Fitzroy sent the next transports laden with
"Pentonvillains" to Moreton Bay (August 1849). Their landing at
either of the southern towns would have provoked riots. In all,
less than 2000 of these "exiles" had been sent, but in 1850 and
1851 men of all shades of opinion joined the branches of an
intercolonial Anti-Transportation League. In the newly
constituted colony of Victoria, where free migrants were
dominant, their zeal against convictism was intensified by an
ugly inrush of "Vandemonian" expirees and probationers to the
gold-diggings. The Victorian Legislative Council passed a bill
restricting immigration from Van Diemen's Land to those who could
prove their freedom from the taint of penal servitude. It was
vetoed by the Crown, but the Colonial Office had already yielded
on the main issue. After 1852 no more convict transports were
despatched to Tasmania. The squatters of Moreton Bay petitioned
more than once for assigned convict servants, but in vain. When
in 1859 the new colony of Queensland was created, only a few
survivors remained of the penal settlement there.</p>
<p>Within a decade of 1853, when transportation to Eastern
Australia ceased, Britain was unable to deliver from her gaols
the thousand convicts a year that Western Australia was anxious
to see employed on her roads and public works. In part the change
was the outcome of Peel's mitigation of the criminal code. With
the aid of his new Police he made certainty of detection a better
deterrent from crime than savage sentences against the small
proportion of criminals who were caught. The wholesale
depopulation of Ireland after the potato famine and the new
prosperity in Britain that had come with rising gold prices alike
relieved the pressure of poverty in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Since transportation ceased, Australian governments have often
busied themselves with the problems of attracting free migration,
but the "ill odour in which government emigration was and is held
among the superior class of hard-working men" ** has been
intensified by every successive attempt. Reacting strongly
against the "evident selfishness" of the systems propounded by
Wakefield and Ben Boyd, the writer just quoted&mdash;though
conceding that poverty, real or comparative, was, and ought to
be, the great recruiter for emigrant ships&mdash;stickled at the
favourite deception of the emigrant with the notion "that some
other country is more pleasant to live in than his own". "All
schemes based on a mere desire to get rid of troublesome paupers
or to supply rich colonists with cheap servants will fail and
always have failed. To be continuous and not spasmodic emigration
must be for the benefit of the emigrant." When Sidney wrote, the
easy gains to be made on the alluvial diggings offered to many,
for a time at least, abundant benefit. Before and since that
decade, however, the man who sought to persuade migrants to
venture from Britain to a far land, whence return was difficult,
laboured against real difficulties. The dull servitude of
agricultural and pastoral labour before gold was discovered was
not unknown in Britain. The hardship, the distance and cost of
the voyage were great. In the days of transportation the voyage
out was counted the worse half of the sentence. During the decade
when transportation had ceased and the gold was yet unknown, low
passage-money was a necessity for those making the journey in
pursuit of the wage-earner's humble standard of life. As soon as
the policy of land sales came into vogue, some of the revenue
thus derived had been set aside to pay the passages of free
labourers; and so great was the disparity of numbers between the
sexes that this category was interpreted as including unmarried
women. The excess of men in the colonies certainly suggested that
at the Antipodes emigrant women might pursue with some confidence
the ambition of matrimony. In 1832 a ship went out with women and
children from the charitable institutions of Dublin and Cork.
Plans for repayment of passage money worked badly, and after 1835
unmarried women were granted official as well as virtually free
passages. Labouring families were assisted by liberal grants. In
1836, however, the poor quality of the migrants gathered by
shipping agents anxious only for full government cargoes led New
South Wales to send three naval surgeons to select the best
applicants. "No females were to be accepted unless they belonged
to or accompanied a family group. The men, preferably under
thirty years of age and married, were to be one-third
agricultural labourers and overseers, two-thirds mechanics."
Thus, even before self-government, colonial authorities sought to
improve by selection the evil quality of the human material which
Britain had first thrust on them.</p>
<p class="foot">[** S. Sidney, <i>The Three Colonies of
Australia</i>, 1852, p. ix.]</p>
<p>To some colonists, it is true, selection did not seem
necessary. On grounds of expense New South Wales dropped her
appointment of special selectors in 1840, and made the new Land
and Emigration Commissioners her agents in the matter. "The real
objection", thinks Sir Timothy Coghlan, "was that the immigrants,
being of a superior type, were disposed to look for, higher wages
than the settlers were willing to pay, and the married man with a
family was apt to seek to 'better himself', whereas the settlers
sought to have men who would remain with them permanently." Now
that transportation was coming to an end, they wanted shepherds
and hut-keepers in addition to the agricultural labourers,
overseers and mechanics sought by government. A bounty system was
started by which, apart altogether from government selection,
private persons might bring out approved numbers of migrants so
long as these complied with certain age limits and occupational
rules. The first intention (1839) was that by this means colonial
employers might bespeak in the United Kingdom the labour which
they needed. Such a close correspondence between demand and
supply soon vanished, if in fact it ever obtained. The increase
of the bounties to cover the full cost of the passage made the
recruiting of bounty immigrants an easy speculation for
ship-owners. In 1839, 2814 were brought out, in 1840, 6675 and in
841, 20,103. Having no claim on the government that had selected
him, the bounty migrant was forced by his necessity to accept the
first job that offered. In 1840 the local government found that
it had given permits for the bringing of 71,315 migrants of this
kind and had pledged itself to find £979,600. Luckily,
when "the Bad Times" came, the Land and Emigration Commissioners
took alarm at the number of bounty emigrants setting forth,
suspended their own well-managed selection of emigrants for whom
the land fund provided, and did their best to supervise the
vessels and emigrants sent out under the bounty scheme.</p>
<p>But the damage had been done. Bounty migrants, largely from
Ireland, where they were more easily recruited, crowded on Sydney
wharves and foreshores, homeless and unprovided for after the ten
days grace allowed on board the immigrant ship. The second
colonial boom had burst, and employment was paralysed by waning
credit and low prices. Sixty-four girls who had just landed
possessed between them 14<i>s</i>. 1½<i>d</i>., twenty-two
being literally penniless.</p>
<p>Into this hopeless scene came Caroline Chisholm, "a second.
Moses in bonnet and in shawl".* She was a yeoman's daughter, from
Northamptonshire. At 22 she had changed the name of Jones for
that of Chisholm, marrying a Captain in the East India Company's
Army. They and their family came in 1838 to spend a period of
sick leave in New South Wales. One of their first experience in
Sydney was an encounter with some Highlanders, wandering
disconsolate and workless through inability to speak English.
Chisholm, having Highland blood in him, turned interpreter and
set them on the way to success as wood-cutters.</p>

Chisholm</i>.]</p>
<p>His wife's interest in emigrants needed little kindling. In
early childhood an old soldier visiting her father had excited
her curiosity by his tales of other lands, and his talk of them
as colonies where emigrants might reap fortunes. The idea at once
spurred her to childish action, and her first attempts at
colonization were carried on in a wash-hand basin, before she was
seven years old, with boats of broad beans, and touchwood dolls.
With these she contrived a busy family migration and sent the
boats, filled with wheat, back to their homeland on the other
side of the basin.</p>
<p>In Sydney she found herself face to face with
the realities of emigration&mdash;hundreds of homeless girls with
neither friends nor protection. For three years, there and at
Windsor, she did what she could to find places for them,
sheltering many in her own home. It was in 1841, however, when
her husband was recalled for service in China, and the financial
collapse increased unemployment, that her efforts became public
in scale. At Easter of that year she decided to devote herself
wholly to this urgent task, and in it "to know neither country
nor creed".** Newspapers and public men admired her projects but
privately assured her that she was attempting the impossible. Sir
George Gipps told her she much overrated her powers of mind and
declined to help, but finally gave her the use of an old building
for her Immigrants' Home.*** For four nights she fought for
possession against rats, and finally won with the aid of
arsenic.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See Margaret Swann, <i>op. cit</i>. p. 10. In
her wash-basin experiment she "had a Wesleyan minister and a
Catholic priest in the same boat".]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Sir George's account of her first interview
with him gives a glimpse of Mrs Chisholm in the flesh and the
spirit: "I expected to have seen an old lady in white cap and
spectacles, who would, have talked to me about my soul. I was
amazed when my aide introduced a handsome stately young woman,
who proceeded to reason the question, as if she thought her
reason, and experience too, worth as much as mine". See, for
other contemporary descriptions of her, Margaret Swann, <i>op.
cit</i>. p. 5.]</p>
<p>There she began a systematic campaign. Her free registry
office substituted proper agreements in triplicate (one being
filed at her office) for the verbal "contracts of service" which
had till then left servants helpless before the masters and
magistrates. A day school kept children from the streets. Her
first report of the work of the Home showed that within a year
735 young women had been provided with situations; 291 going to
the country districts. The Governor, as soon as he realized her
genius for detail, franked her letters so that she might place
country labour more easily. This was a valuable help when to send
a half-ounce letter to Parramatta cost 4<i>d</i>., to Windsor or
Campbelltown 7<i>d</i>., to Bathurst 10<i>d</i>., and the postage
for 300 miles was a shilling. Her inquiries about the places
offering were thorough. Sir George Gipps was at first a little
perturbed at their range. "When I gave you the privilege of
franking", he told her, "I presumed you would address yourself to
the magistrates, the clergy and the principal settlers, but who,
pray, are these John Varleys and Dick Hogans of whom 'I have
never heard since I have been in the colony?" She replied that if
she had inquired of prominent settlers they must have gone to
their overseers and would have then answered her vaguely. "I want
to know what number of labourers each district can absorb and of
what class and what wages. I have applied to men humble but
intelligent, able to afford exactly the information I
require."</p>
<p>Success in finding country places for the girls was baulk by
their fear, probably justified, of making bush journeys by dray.
They hesitated to set out alone. Mrs Chisholm went with them.
Quickly the journeys grew into expeditions under her command, not
of girls only, but of immigrant families. These became the
invaluable nuclei of social development in fostering which she
was doubly faithful to her girlish vision of family
migration.</p>
<p>Beginning with journeys to Parramatta, Liverpool, Campbelltown
and Maitland, she was soon venturing as far as Goulburn,
Bathurst, Yass, Gundagai and the Murrumbidgee. At times she was
on the road for as long as five weeks. One party numbered 147
men, women and children on setting out, and grew en route to a
maximum of 240. She would ride ahead on her favourite horse
"Captain" while the migrants followed by dray. From farm to farm,
from homestead to homestead, she sought places for them, judged
the mutual fitness of place and servant, drew up agreements and
meantime supplied her charges with their daily needs.</p>
<p>Her general plan was first to place a female servant, relying
on the rivalry of housewives to make the coming of one the
stimulus to a demand for many. The girls married best among the
farms, but even the stations, with their prejudice against
"encumbrances", did not baffle her strategic cult of the family.
She would never set about match-making direct. There was little
difference to a squatter or farmer, she reasoned, between a
single man's wage and rations and those of a married couple.* She
would persuade an employer to engage a married couple and, if
need offered, use them as employers of the eligible girls.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* The rate of wages for a single man then
averaged £20 per annum with weekly rations of flour 9 lb.,
meat 10 lb., tea 2 oz., sugar 1½ lb. A man and his wife
with one child £25 per annum and a double ration.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** E. Mackenzie, <i>op. cit</i>. p. 67, reports
"On one of her first journeys she was met by a discontented party
of emancipists, shepherds and shearers of the district who said:
We believe you are a very good sort of a person, Mrs Chisholm,
and have great respect for you, but we cannot allow emigrants
here to lower our wages'. Her answer was, 'I hear you want wives.
Is that true?' The reply was a universal 'Yes'. Then, don't you
see, I can't send single girls to a district where there are only
bachelors. Let me fix a few married families down on the
different stations, and I will send, to them decent single lasses
that you can marry'."]</p>
<p>She was not, however, a mere match-maker by instinct, led on
by a sympathy with the joys of matrimony. When an admirer praised
her masculine mind, he meant to note her finest
quality&mdash;insight into the main defect of transportation and
subsidized migration. Great alike in brain and heart, she knew
that the unit cell of society is a family. She settled 11,000
souls in new homes during the decade before the gold discoveries,
and deliberately evolved a new art of family colonization. To her
mind it was not good husbandry to uproot individuals from a
crowded land, to cull the worst and cast them out on a rubbish
heap, and then, when some throve in the rotting mass, to call it
a new garden. She saw that, as certain plants can only thrive
together, the sexes must be balanced to make a sane community.
Between 1840 and 1850, the period of her greatest prestige and
activity, the ratio of males to females in the Australian
colonies dropped from 2:1 to 1.43:1. The number of females in all
colonies was 63,102 in 1840 and 166,673 in 1850: of males 127,306
in 1840 and 238,683 in 1850. Confining attention to New South
Wales, and taking the dates 1836 to 1851 in order to exclude the
free settlement at Port Phillip, one obtains more striking
figures:</p>

<p>The credit due to Mrs Chisholm is not that she achieved these
results but that she altered the attitude of the community
towards female immigration and by spreading family life raised
the self-respect of all grades and set new standard in the
development of social life.</p>
<p>The worst feature of transportation, she held, had been that
it denied its victims the normal motives of human ambition,
ability to hand on to one's children the lore of family life, a
very present immortality and a renewal of youth. To her the
convicts were victims of a "close and galling bondage",
"incarcerated together by hundreds like a menagerie of wild
beasts"&mdash;"victims of a principle promulgated but too
successfully by a modern popular author".* At its worst the
system produced the horrors of Port Arthur, and filled the gaols
and asylums for long after 1840 with the demented wrecks of
prison discipline. But none escaped unbranded, and the solitary
hopeless life in the bush into which the old hands drifted only
confirmed "the frightful and deteriorating effects of this more
than savage life".</p>
<p class="foot">[* The phrases are quoted from a letter on
"Emigration and Transportation Relatively Considered" which she
addressed to Earl Grey in 1847. The "modern author" would seem to
be Jeremy Bentham, and his <i>Panopticon v. New South Wales,
Constant Inspection the only security against Escape</i>
(1812).]</p>
<p>Her deliberate aim was to bring to all in Australia the
opportunity of family life. Accustomed in her journeys to find
shelter at the nearest hut, and to share the hospitality of all
classes, she had learned to know the kinder side of the
emancipist settlers, "their extreme, nay, nervous anxiety
regarding the welfare of their children&mdash;the efforts they
make to educate them&mdash;the miles theft travel to attend a
place of worship&mdash;their deep sympathy for the
unfortunate&mdash;their Christian liberality and
charity&mdash;their open-hearted hospitality". She denounced and
sought to remedy the effects of a system "that has doomed tens of
thousands to the demoralising state of bachelorism". She appealed
to the "paternal government" to entitle itself to that honoured
name by promoting family and female migration. "For all the
clergy you can dispatch, all the schoolmasters you can appoint,
all the churches you can build, and all the books you can export
will never do much good without 'God's police'&mdash;wives and
little children."</p>
<p>In such a cause she obtained unstinted support from almost all
in the colony. A prominent member of the Legislative Council
asked her to draw on him for any money she required on her
journeys. But in the country districts none would accept payment
for the needs of her charges; she at no time found need of his
help. By 1843 her plans were taking wider scope. She did not
relax her efforts to find places for migrants. A contemporary
describes her ** "making forced marches at the head of armies of
emigrants, as far as 300 miles into the far interior, sometimes
sleeping at the stations of wealthy settlers, sometimes in the
huts of poor immigrants or prisoners; sometimes camping out in
the bush, teaching the timid, awkward peasantry of England,
Ireland and Scotland how, to 'bush' it; comforting the women,
nursing the children, and putting down any discontented or
froward spirits among the men; now taking a few weary children
into her covered tandem-cart, now mounting upon horseback and
galloping over a short cut through the hills to meet her weary
caravan, with supper foraged from the hospitable settlers."</p>
<p class="foot">[** Samuel Sidney, <i>The Three Colonies of
Australia</i> (1852), pp. 133-6.]</p>
<p>She realized very soon that in ninety-nine cases out of a
hundred the emigrants had come in hopes of obtaining land and
independence. The best way of national colonization would be to
settle families on small farms. The Governor and his Council,
however, were left under the new constitution of 1842 without
power to "interfere in any manner with the sale or the
appropriation of the lands belonging to the Crown in the colony
or with the revenue thence arising". And the minimum price,
raised from 12<i>s</i>. to a pound an acre, at which the Land and
Emigration Commissioners sold land, on strict Wakefield lines,
debarred small settlers, both because of their poverty and the
less lucrative use they could make of the land, from competing at
land sales against the shepherd-kings.</p>
<p>Baulked of the aid in family land-settlement which Governor
Gipps would gladly have given, Mrs Chisholm found wealthy
landowner, Captain R. Towns of Shell-harbour, willing to give her
4000 acres on which to make an experiment, together with five
months' rations for her party. There in December 1843 she settled
a group of 30 families, including over 240 persons. She watched
over their early troubles and nursed to humble success a little
colony of 30-acre farms.* In 1846, having built up a stable
organization for placing migrants in New South Wales, she
returned to England to found a national scheme of
colonization.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See S. Sidney, <i>op. cit</i>. pp. 153-4.]</p>
<p>In London she quickly created "The Family Colonization Loan
Society" which encouraged the migration of undivided families by
supplementing their savings with loans. After a winter of
pleading backed by full proofs of actual instances, she extorted
from the Land and Emigration Commissioners a remedy for the evil
of families divided by partial emigration. Two shiploads of
children were sent from British workhouses to rejoin their
parents oversea. Free passages for convicts' wives and families
were more sparingly given. With the active aid of leaders of
opinion like Lord Shaftesbury and Sidney Herbert, the Family
Colonization Loan Society conducted a vigorous educational
campaign in favour of New South Wales. "Tell the truth. The
country can stand it" was Mrs Chisholm's watchword, and she was
able not only to arouse great interest and energy in emigration,
but also to charter ships and institute sweeping changes in the
accommodation and food on board. For this she was attacked by
shipowners, who did not scruple to suggest that all her
philanthropy cloaked plans to enrich herself. The 'Slains
Castle', the first ship to fly her blue flag with the monograms
F.C.L.S. and C.C., sailed with 250 passengers in September of
1850, and was followed at six-monthly intervals by others. Where
the Emigration Commissioners had allowed from 600 to 800 to be
carried, these vessels chartered by the Loan Society carried less
than 300. By 1852, however, news of the gold discoveries had
reached Britain and the need of Mrs Chisholm's labours to find
colonists was over. After her return to Australia in 1854, she
remained there for twelve years. One of her first activities was
to persuade the new Victorian Government to erect rough shelters
along the tracks to the diggings. But her health was broken, and
her constant insistence on the need of unlocking the land dimmed
her popularity with some. Between 1862 and 1866 she kept a girls'
school in Newtown, Sydney. She was given a pension of £100
a year by the Crown and died in 1877.</p>
<p>Work such as hers could not be undone. The Land and Emigration
Commissioners renewed in 1844 their sending of selected
migrants&mdash;agricultural labourers, shepherds and domestic
servants&mdash;4500 of whom went out under their auspices in
1844-5. Thereupon a committee of the Legislative Council asked in
1845 for £12,500 per annum for three years, with which to
renew "bounty immigration". They adduced in support elaborate
calculations of the new land and increased flocks that would
absorb the newcomers' services. The assumption of unchecked and
abundant prosperity was perhaps not as naïve as it sounded.
Governor Gipps put aside their pleading, thinking the effect of
such a renewal would be to flood the labour market again and to
force down wages. The land revenue was not as buoyant as these
pastoral hopes, and he put the annual need of fresh labour at
4000 only. No funds, however, were available in 1846 and 1847.
There was talk of Indian coolies, and of a limited trial of
Chinese and South Sea Islanders. In 1848 loans on the security of
future land sales were raised to promote selected immigration
again, £50,000 being allotted to Sydney district and a like
sum to Port Phillip. The more humane and business-like handling
of migration was shown in the reservation of half the passage
money until the selected migrants had been landed in Australia
and their treatment en route had become known to the authorities
there. The new spirit prompted, too, the provision of depots for
the reception of new arrivals at country centres such as
Goulburn, Bathurst, Maitland and Moreton Bay, here they were
lodged at government expense until offered work at rates deemed
fair by the superintendent.</p>
<p>Other societies formed to promote emigration, such as Sidney
Herbert's Female Emigration Society and the Highland and Island
Emigration Society, were not as successful in their choice of
migrants as Mrs Chisholm's Family Loan Colonization Society. Like
her organization they failed to collect the sums advanced to eke
out small savings and pay passage money, but the migrants they
selected being less worthy of support, they received no such
grants from the legislature as maintained her Society's work.</p>
<p>Mrs Chisholm's crusade for family life was a personal task,
the realization of an enthusiast's dream. In the decade of
confused trekking to and fro by excited diggers from the first
gold discoveries to the final rush to Otago in 1861, family
desertion was painfully frequent all through Australia. Mrs
Chisholm's effort may then have seemed vain and soon forgotten.
Her plea for access to the land, even when freely granted in
form, for long seemed equally barren of the consequences hoped
for. Yet both are very real achievements in Australia to-day.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI<br>
<br>
The Gold Rushes of 1851-1860</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> grant by Britain of colonial
self-government, to the Eastern Colonies in 1851, to Western
Australia in 1890, was immediately followed in each instance by
energetic discoveries of gold. The causal relation is not plain
but the economic and political results were revolutionary. Gold
drew in new populations which swamped the old colonists, and
which, as their easy gains from gold declined, used the new
political freedom for ends of their own, not approved by the
pastoral communities they had disturbed and reinforced in
numbers.</p>
<p>The Crown Colonial officials in New South Wales did not
welcome the finding of gold. They may fairly be said to have
delayed it in the interests of prison discipline and a quiet
life. In 1823 a convict produced a small nugget which the officer
in charge promptly took to be stolen gold melted down; the
discoverer was duly flogged. Rumours of other finds floated
around shepherds' huts and Sydney bars. Officialdom frowned, A
Polish explorer, Count Strzelecki, told Governor Gipps in 1839 of
gold-bearing pyrites near Lithgow. Gipps bade him be silent and
similarly advised the Revd. W. B. Clarke, a schoolmaster and
amateur geologist, when he too found gold in 1841. A British
geologist, Sir Roderick Murchison, came to the conclusion, from a
study of published papers on Australia, that gold would be found
there. He based his argument on the similarity of the mountains
with the Urals, and urged that unemployed tin-miners from
Cornwall should be sent to look for it. Earl Grey at the Colonial
Office snubbed him for his enthusiasm, and such "cousin Jacks" as
were assisted to migrate turned their steps to the South
Australian copper-mines. Even a mild rush to California only half
thawed the chill with which officials thought of similar doings
in New South Wales. A certain W. J. Smith, who in 1849 showed the
Colonial Secretary a nugget embedded in quartz, was offered a
reward in proportion to the value of the find. He declined terms
that would have thrown him upon the generosity of an evidently
hostile and sceptical Government.</p>
<p>In 1851 the atmosphere suddenly changed. In February, E. H.
Hargraves, a squatter who had returned from California, tested
his theory that the rocks and flats near Bathurst closely
resembled the gold-bearing country over the Pacific, and found it
true. Taking the gold to Sydney, he persuaded the Colonial
Secretary that an announcement would stop emigration to
California and end all possibility of renewed transportation. He
accepted the offer which Smith had declined, and within a few
weeks his "Ophir" field had infected the whole colony with the
gold-fever. By mid-May, 400 miners were "puddling" for nuggets
and gold dust. From stations, farms and city streets came
"new-made miners, some armed with picks, others shouldering
crowbars and shovels, and not a few strung round with wash-hand
basins, tin-pots and cullenders".*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Quoted from the <i>Bathurst Free Press</i>, 17
May 1851, by G. V. Portus, "The Gold Discoveries and their First
Effects", appearing in vol. <small>VII</small>, ch.
<small>IX</small>, of the <i>Cambridge History of the British
Empire</i>, the most spirited and thoughtful account of the
period.]</p>
<p>It was now the pastoralists' turn to take fright at the
consequences. Some asked for martial law and a downright
prohibition of gold-digging. The latter was actually proclaimed
by Governor Denison in Van Diemen's Land in 1852, avowedly in the
interests of "the ordinary pursuits" of the colony. Governor
Fitzroy proclaimed the gold to be legally the property of the
Crown, and required all miners to take out monthly licences to
dig for it. These were to be issued at 30<i>s</i>. a month by
resident Commissioners. The <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> doubted
the efficacy of such restraints. It clung to the hope "that the
treasure does not exist in large quantities". Should it do so,
"let the inhabitants of New South Wales and the neighbouring
colonies stand prepared for calamities far more terrible than
earthquakes or pestilence!" (19 May). Standing, however, was the
last thing the inhabitants were prepared to do when in July a
certain, Dr Kerr produced a mass of gold and quartz containing
1272 ounces of gold which an aboriginal shepherd had knocked off
the outcrop of a reef. A new field called the Turon became the
scene of a rush of men more excited than ever.</p>
<p>The colony of Victoria, separated from New South Wales on July
1 of that year, made a prompt bid for a share in the
"calamities". It was intolerable that separation should be, even
in appearance, the occasion for the loss of the most active
spirits in its population of 77,000. In Port Phillip District,
too, there had been tales current of shepherds' finds, and the
inevitable "man named Smyth" had been told by Superintendent
Latrobe in 1844 to hush up a discovery of gold on the Ovens
River. A Gold Discovery Committee (9 June 1851) now offered a
reward for the finding of gold within 200 miles of Melbourne. It
was immediately claimed by W. Campbell of Strath Lodden near
Clunes. Louis John Michel brought in samples of gold-bearing
quartz from Anderson's Creek. Thomas Hiscock of Buninyong found
gold a few weeks later on the south side of the Dividing Range,
and the Ballarat diggings nearby soon eclipsed all previous finds
by their amazing richness. Early in September, Melbourne papers
received word of very rich diggings that had been quietly
developed since mid July at Mount Alexander. In December, Henry
Frenchman found at Golden Gully the first of Bendigo's big
deposits. During 1851, gold worth over a million pounds was won
in Victoria, which became the centre of attraction before the
gold discoveries were known overseas. The Victorian fields were
from 70 to 100 miles out of Melbourne. The Dividing Range was an
easily crossed watershed quite unlike the formidable Blue
Mountains behind Sydney. In the size and abundance of their
nuggets and surface enrichment the diggings were unique.**
Governor Latrobe reported having seen, eight pounds weight of
gold washed from two tin dishes of dirt. Three years later a
nugget weighing 98½ pounds, found on Dalton's Flat during
a visit by Governor and Lady Hotham, was called the "Lady Hotham"
in her honour.</p>
<p class="foot">[** For a list of famous nuggets see the
<i>Australian Encyclopaedia</i>, vol. <small>I</small>, p.
561.]</p>
<p>Ordinary mortals could not be expected to regard such wonders
as calamities. The diggings seemed rather the first real chance
of independence that Australia had offered the poor man.
Childhood's dreams were coming true. Wealth in big lumps might be
picked up from the ground. All that was necessary was hard work
with pick and shovel, turning over the soil in gullies where long
ages had washed down and lightly covered the unheeded metal. Food
was rough, and water often scarce. Colonial fever, as typhoid was
then called, was soon prevalent about the makeshift camps. But to
men inured to a bush life these were trifles when weighed against
the virtual certainty of high holiday from sheep and loneliness,
and perhaps the means of returning to the old land rich and
respectable ever after. Until September 1852 most of the diggers
were pre-gold colonists concentrated into Victoria from station,
farm and township. Nearly a quarter of the population of pastoral
days, it is said, tried their luck along the gullies in the Great
Divide. Expirees, emancipists, free-immigrants, escaped convicts
from Van Diemen's Land, policemen and civil servants, sailors and
clerks, shepherds and shopkeepers went digging and puddling
where, with persistence and energy, fortunes were to be won by
the simplest method.</p>
<p>But not all were diggers. The idea of selling goods to the
fortunate at fancy prices occurred to so many that at Bathurst,
the first diggings, prices in June 1851 were below those ruling
in Sydney. In Victoria, however, the proffer of new gold was so
sudden and so strong that the level of all Australian prices
(taking those of 1896-1900 as base, 1000) rose from 1036 in
1846-50 to 1607 for 1851-5. The main source of quick trading
profits from the diggers was the sale of spirits. Up to the end
of 1853 the Victorian Government refused to issue publicans'
licences on the diggings. Opinion on the goldfields attributed
this to the influence of the Melbourne public-house keepers. The
lucky digger with his bag of gold-dust was expected to come to
town and there replace the station-hand or shearer with his
cheque. Whether that charge was well or ill-founded, the sly-grog
shanty became a regular feature of the mining camp. As beer was
too bulky to be easily smuggled, the grog sold was usually
spirits. Teamsters could always be found who would risk the loss
of horses, dray, harness and cargo plus a fine of fifty pounds.
Brewers' casks were much in demand on the fields for "puddling"
the gold-bearing dirt, and very handy to stow goods in during wet
journeys by bullock team. Detection was not easy, and if the
worst happened bribery was not unknown. What charges the traffic
would bear may be deduced from the average of £1500 a week
for cartage which a Ballarat publican is said to have paid during
part of 1853. The sly-grog shop bore no sign and carried small
stock. Its front curtain was always down, but the way in was well
known, the storekeeper being usually a "tout" and sleeping
partner. When the evening gun, fired near the Commissioner's
tent, put an end to the day's strenuous digging, the lull of the
meal-time was soon followed by a roaring business to which the
police were ordinarily deaf and blind.</p>
<p>In general, however, the mining camps surprised observers by
the order they maintained. Their capacity for spontaneous
organization in religious congregations and in the usual
Anglo-Saxon multiplicity of sporting, social and friendly
societies enabled Governor Latrobe to reconstitute his police and
civil service, and to convert, with no more disorder than his own
and his advisers' blunders provoked, a fortuitous collection of
newcomers into a self-governing community.</p>
<p>The Victorian Government in 1851 was a mere scaffolding. The
Imperial "Act for the better government of Her Majesty's
Australian Colonies", 1850 (13 &amp; 14 Victoria, cap. 59) set up
a Legislative Council, two-thirds of whose members were elected
on a ten-pound rental franchise. This meant a present supremacy
of the old squatter leaders. But the Act endowed the new Council
with a power to draw up a new bi-cameral constitution. Thus its
moral authority was overshadowed; its status being that of a
house of caretakers under notice to quit. It represented a landed
interest at loggerheads with the Governor as to its legal title
to the land and by no means willing to welcome an upstart
industry spreading everywhere and threatening to paralyse
pastoral pursuits. In November 1851 the Council declined to find
from general revenue the cost of governing the mining camps.
Latrobe, in the habit of following Governor Fitzroy as his
official superior, continued to levy the licence fee imposed in
accordance with Californian precedents before Victoria's
separation from New South Wales. He considered the licence plan
unsound. It penalized heavily the unsuccessful diggers. He would
have preferred an export duty by which diggers would have
contributed to the cost of government in proportion to their
success. But that would have placed the revenue, as part of
Customs and Excise, within the power of his factious and
inexperienced Council. He certainly needed more revenue. Diggers
could average, men said, an ounce of dust a day. It was little
enough, in the circumstances, to offer a constable 6<i>s</i>. a
day. To pay this he sought in December 1851 to impose a doubled
licence fee of £3 a month. The gold-miners, knowing that
the Council was pressing the Governor to grant pastoral leases
for long terms, raised a great clamour against this doubling of
the "poll-tax" on their own energies. With few police and only 80
soldiers to enforce his commands, Latrobe withdrew. The
Legislative Council, whose hostility had tied his hands, then
passed a resolution favouring the levy of an export duty on gold
in place of the unpopular licence fee.</p>
<p>The knot should have been cut when in June 1852 word came from
Britain giving the local legislatures control of the licence fees
from gold-digging, and suggesting that whatever additional
revenue was needed might be raised "either by an export duty on
gold or by a royalty". But an Export Duty Bill, proposed as an
added impost, not as a substitute for licence fees, was howled
down on the diggings. The outcry against it, very probably, was
inspired by the gold-buyers, who represented that it would
necessarily reduce the price they could pay for gold dust.
Doubtless this was so, but they had been giving as little as
55<i>s</i>. an ounce, at least a pound less than the mint value
of gold, and were discussing the relative qualities of the
"colonial gold" won on the different fields.</p>
<p>Thus antagonism between the diggers and the Government was
already marked when in September 1852 the first wave of a new
type of free immigration broke on the shore of Hobson's Bay. The
newcomers came mainly from Britain. Nineteen thousand landed in
Melbourne in September, and 94,664 during 1852, seven times as
many as the arrivals during 1851. Only 1648 of these were
foreigners. Possibly the exceptional qualities of the foreigners,
many of them exiles of the 1848 disturbances, impressed their
contemporaries. More probably the insular prejudices of a
population that had hitherto been selected from those under
British jurisdiction made it gape at every foreign type. There
were sources enough, without looking beyond the United Kingdom,
for the indignant radicalism which soon leavened the mining
camps. The hungry 'forties and the Chartist movement, the Irish
potato famine and Smith O'Brien's "rising" had repressed in the
old country popular ambitions to make a new social order by
political or revolutionary action. In Victoria the emigrants,
whose very coming showed them to be men of confident initiative,
faced no such repressive powers. At first they were too intent
upon trying their luck inland to care for politics. Dumped
pell-mell with a medley of goods on Liardet's Beach (later
Sandridge and Port Melbourne), they sorted themselves out in
Canvas Town, trudged or rode through the scorching dust-laden
north wind, or, in the bitter winter of 1853, picked a way over
the muddy tracks to Ballarat or Bendigo. They felt no respect for
a ruling oligarchy without traditional dignity and but lately
seized of power. Whatever the Legislative Councillors and
Governor Latrobe might seem to the old hands, to these newcomers,
soon a growing and self-conscious majority, they were men using
temporary political power to fasten on a new country a land
monopoly like that whose claws the Anti-Corn Law League had
lately clipped by popular agitation. Throughout the colony the
diggers won wealth where these men had missed it. Yet when the
easy gold gave out they found themselves debarred by new land
laws from acquiring the stake in the country which, they were
told, was the proper condition of a share in its government.</p>
<p>The diggers proved ready critics. Now it was Tasmanian
ex-convicts who excited their scorn, now Chinese intruders. Those
who returned to Britain shocked their home-keeping friends with
tales of the rough life and rougher people on the stations and
the diggings, of the snares that lurked in Canvas Town south of
the Yarra and beyond the ken of the police, of the quagmire
three-parts of a mile wide across the Keilor Plains which served
as the road to Bendigo and Mount Alexander.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* See <i>The Diggings, the Bush and
Melbourne</i>, by James Armour, Glasgow, 5864; "The Gold
Diggers", by C. B. Newling, <i>Journal of the Royal Australian
Historical Society</i>, vol. <small>XI</small>, pp. 262-80; and
"Gold Seekers of the Fifties" in <i>The Argus</i>, May 1899.]</p>
<p>They had reason for much of their criticism. Neither officials
nor legislators showed imagination or foresight in shaping
channels for the broadening current of Victorian life. The
population reached 236,798 in 1854, of whom 68,790 were
able-bodied miners on the gold-fields. In the following year it
passed that of the mother colony: in 1857 the population of
Victoria was 410,766 and that of New South Wales 305,487. But
though rich alluvial finds continued and the total yield remained
amazing, that total fell from £16,776,250 in 1852, the
<i>annus mirabilis</i>, to £8,661,161 in 1854. By then,
three times as many were digging as in 1852.** To men led into an
uncouth life by the motive of monetary gain through free and
intense effort, this waning of their chances made the monthly
licence fee an offence and an irritation. It was clumsily
collected by a police force recruited from old Tasmanian military
warders, London Metropolitan Police&mdash;culls, no
doubt&mdash;and inexperienced youngsters locally pitchforked into
a rank of "cadets", between commissioned and non-commissioned
officers. Periodic "digger-hunts" were made by parties of police
armed with fixed bayonets. Diggers caught working without the
licence were marched to the "lock up" or even chained to a log
outside the Commissioner's tent, to be heavily fined when they
came under his summary jurisdiction. These digger-hunts were
insultingly reminiscent of searches for bushrangers or runaway
"government men".</p>
<p class="foot">[** T. A. Coghlan, <i>Labour and Industry in
Australia</i>, p. 587, bases these figures on the estimates made
by dealers in bullion.]</p>
<p>Only a lead was needed to stir mass resentment into action. It
was given unwittingly in June 1853 by a proposal in the New South
Wales Legislative Council for the abolition of licences. The
revenue from the fees was not important there. In August, after a
short and orderly campaign known from the badge they used as the
Red Ribbon Agitation, the Bendigo (V.) diggers sent a deputation
to ask Governor Latrobe to reduce the licensing fee to
10<i>s</i>. a month, and to explain to him their subjection to
armed force, their lack of access to the land, and their desire
for a voice in making the laws. Latrobe answered that at
30<i>s</i>. a month the revenue from licences did not meet the
cost of governing the fields. The miners' delegates talked to
popular audiences in the capital of 100,000 diggers ringing
Melbourne with fire, and were applauded. Reinforcements from "The
Fighting Fortieth" were sent to Bendigo Camp and their coming was
met by a general refusal to take out licences. A hasty measure
was passed by the Council reducing the fee to £2 for three
months. The formal refusal to reduce it to 10<i>s</i>. a month
was intended to save the face of a legislature nervous of being
"dictated to" by the mining population, but the concession
emboldened the element that talked of using force. Stump-orators
grew fonder of comparing the military resources and prowess of
the diggers with those of the Government.</p>
<p>When Latrobe left the colony early in 1854, order had been
maintained at the diggings, but only by a big sacrifice of
revenue and authority. The new Governor was Sir Charles Hotham, a
naval officer as sure of the value of discipline as Latrobe had
been conscious of the injustice of the licence system. A severe
commercial crisis had followed speculative over-trading, and the
diminution of revenue from imports and licences had left a public
deficit of a million sterling. Hotham called on the Commissioners
to mend matters by a stricter collection of the fees due. In 1854
a new rush had gathered the worst elements from the various
diggings to Eureka Valley in the usually orderly Ballarat field.
In October a digger was stabbed at the door of a rough "hotel" in
an altercation "after hours". A venal magistrate acquitted the
owner, an ex-convict from Tasmania, and a mob of some thousands
thereupon swept the police aside and burnt the hotel. Hotham,
after inquiry, dismissed the magistrate and ordered a new trial.
The hotel-keeper was convicted of manslaughter, but three of the
incendiaries were also sentenced to prison. A force of 450
soldiers and police was sent to keep order. Thereupon the
"Ballarat Reform League" demanded of the Governor the release of
their comrades and talked of revolt against "tyranny" and of a
Victorian Republic. Hotham firmly refused the "demand" for
release, inviting the spokesmen to temper it to a petition. He
explained, in answer to talk of political rights, that a
constitutional amendment giving votes to all licence-holders had
been sent for the Queen's approval, as such amendments had always
to be sent, but that if they would elect a representative he
would at once nominate him to the Council. With clumsy obstinacy
they repelled his conciliation and reiterated their
"demands".</p>
<p>At Ballarat, on their return, a tall German called Vern began
a provocative public burning of licences. At the next
"digger-hunt" the Commissioner and his men were pelted with
stones. The diggers bought up and seized arms; drilling began. On
a rise in Eureka Camp they built a crude stockade of stakes,
ropes and broken carts. The miners obtained some ammunition by
rushing a military convoy; shots were fired into the government
camp. Captain Thomas decided not to wait for General Nickle,
known to be on the road with reinforcements. By a surprise attack
early on Sunday morning, 3 December 1854, the stockade was
carried, the rebel flag, a white Southern Cross on a blue ground,
was hauled down and 120 insurgents were marched off to prison. An
officer and four soldiers lost their lives, and so did 30 of the
garrison. Thomas had admirably timed his rush when the family-men
among the rebels were spending the week-end at home.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* For more detail see H. Gyles Turner, <i>Our
Own Little Rebellion</i>, pp. 64-75, and W. B. Withers,
<i>History of Ballarat</i>.]</p>
<p>Governor Hotham insisted upon the trial of the leaders for
high treason, but juries refused to convict. One at least, Peter
Lalor, made lifelong political capital out of his escapade. He
became a Minister of the Crown and Speaker of the Legislative
Assembly. But neither "the last picturesque pose of an order that
was passing", as Mr Portus aptly sums up the Eureka episode, nor
the measures passed at the instance of the Royal Commission which
was sitting when it occurred, could save alluvial digging. The
Commission recommended an annual licence or "Miner's Right"
(qualifying for the suffrage as well), at a fee of one pound. It
favoured also an export duty of half-a-crown per ounce of gold, a
poll-tax on Chinese immigrants, and the sale of land in small
blocks near the gold-fields. These changes were made mostly in
1855, but the land reform came much later. No laws, however,
could prevent the exhaustion, by the diggers' own restless
energy, of the gold available at shallow depths.</p>
<p>The Victorian gold yield rose again in 1855 to a value of
£11,708,088, and in the following year to almost
£14,000,000; but gold mining, as Governor Fitzroy had
predicted in August 1851, had become an industry of companies and
capitalists. The number of alluvial miners continued to increase.
It rose from 68,790 in 1854 to 82,428 in 1857 and 83,116 in 1861,
but the Victorian yield fell off again to less than
£11,000,000 in 1857 and less than £8,000,000 in 1861.
An ever-increasing proportion of the gold became the property of
the companies' shareholders, who installed machinery to work the
ground systematically and at depths the diggers could not reach.
Steam was first used in crushing quartz during 1855. By November
1861, 711 steam engines were generating 10,782 horse power on the
fields.</p>
<p>Two influences buoyed up the diggers' hopes of keeping open
the free man's chance. On some fields the partly elective local
courts, which the 1855 Act substituted for rule by Commissioners,
set their faces against amalgamation of claims. On the Mount
Alexander and McIvor diggings their preference for individual
mining prevented the more economical but socially less attractive
company system from gaining ground. At the Ovens, at Bendigo and
at Ballarat, consolidation proceeded steadily. In place of
individuals with their methods of shallow sinking and
tub-and-cradle work came larger parties who, with a little
capital, made good profits by turning over systematically the
partly exhausted shallow ground. This was known as "paddocking".
Claims were combined or an area taken conjointly and the whole
body of ground cut away systematically on a face. "Headings"
which would not pay the handwashing digger were put through a
circular trough, or horse puddling-machine. Harrows attached to
cross-bars were dragged by horses travelling round the
circumference of the trough while a stream of water flowed
through it. Even so the "paddocks" were but alluvial deposits,
and this systematic work completed the exhaustion begun by the
individual diggers. When deeper ground had to be worked, and
reefs or lodes followed down, well-timbered shafts called for
more capital. Steam-batteries became a pre-requisite to puddling
or more complex processes of treatment. Whatever the courts might
wish to see, such methods meant wages-men and "bosses" rather
than prospectors "on their own" or even as working partners.</p>
<p>More substantial was the aid given the diggers by the
establishment in 1855 of the Sydney Mint. As a result the miners
did not feel the new export duty, for they then obtained for the
first time approximately the mint value of their gold. Hitherto
gold-buyers on the fields, partly by taking advantage of their
clients' ignorance and partly to offset the banks' charges or the
risks of transport to the coast and to Britain, had given less
than 70<i>s</i>. an ounce. The presence of the Sydney Mint,
freely coining gold into sovereigns at the rate of £3.
17<i>s</i>. 10¼<i>d</i>. per standard ounce, forced the
dealers to give the local equivalent of that rate.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The pastoralists benefited substantially also
by the presence of the Mint, for the greater ease in making
specie remittances put an end to the wide fluctuations in
exchange rates which, in the early days of the gold rush, had
operated as a burden on all trade.]</p>
<p>Nevertheless, such a price-change, being necessarily limited
and possible only once, could not long stay the inevitable
catastrophe. By the end of the 'fifties, the Victorian diggings
were too thickly peopled to keep up the standards of extravagant
living to which miners had grown accustomed. The scenes of the
later rushes proved all too limited in resources to reward the
numbers that swarmed off from old hives. In 1858 there was a rush
to far-away Canoona near Rockhampton, in what became Queensland
during the year following, but this venture ended in such misery
that the governments of Victoria and New South Wales were
constrained to bring back many of the 10,000 who had gone in
order to save them from starvation. Many of them) past the scene
of the great Mount Morgan mine of later years. Men of New South
Wales, returning from Victorian diggings, increased the yield of
the older colony's gold-fields from £674,477 in 1857 to
£1,806,171 in 1861.</p>
<p>In Victoria the struggle for a living was embittered by die
presence at the diggings of large numbers of Chinese. A few had
appeared in 1853; by March 1854 they numbered 2000. There were
25,370 Chinese in Victoria by the end of 1857 and 20,000 of them
were digging for gold. They would not work for wages under white
"bosses", many of them being bound financially to their own
countrymen.** If better chances did not offer, they could make a
living by re-washing "tailings". Wherever they appeared there was
bad blood between them and the white diggers, charges of the most
varied character being made against the Celestials. They were
"picking the eyes of the fields". But had not all come to do
that? They were insanitary in their habits, and immoral. They
took money out of the country. Popular outcry dictated a Chinese
Restriction Act in June 1855 by which every Chinese coming into
Victoria was subjected to an entry tax of £10. Ships were
forbidden to carry more than one Chinese to every ten tons
registered measurement. All Chinese resident in the colony were
subjected to an annual poll-tax of £1, which, was raised in
1858 to £6. "Protectors of Chinese" were appointed to
enforce these taxes and to control Chinese camps.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See P. C. Campbell, <i>Chinese Coolie
Migration in the Empire, passim</i>.</p>
<p>The raising of the poll-tax in 1858 marked a realization that
other obstacles did not prevent the Chinese from coming. In
formidable numbers they made their way to the diggings across
country from Guichen Bay in South Australia and from the south
coast of New South Wales. After 1858, the heavy poll-tax and the
waning alluvial yields sent many across the Murray from Victoria
to the New South Wales diggings; yet there were still 25,000 in
Victoria at the 1861 census. New South Wales had then 12,988,
mostly engaged in gold-mining. Popular dislike was shown there in
a Restriction Bill passed in 1858 by the Legislative Assembly but
rejected by the Council. The Council's hands were forced,
however, by outbreaks of violence in December 1860 and January
1861 at a new field called Lambing Flat or Burrangong.*** A
Miners' League virtually superseded the Commissioner and police
as local authority, and twice drove the Chinese off the field.
Foot, horse and artillery were sent from Sydney to restore order.
The Premier, Charles Cowper, followed with counsels of moderation
and promises of legislation. His first proposal was to segregate
the alien miners on certain fields to be proclaimed as open.
Fresh riots at Lambing Flat and the acquittal of those accused of
participation punctuated the passage of this Act and of another
drafted on the lines of the Victorian measure (passed November
1861).</p>
<p class="foot">[*** There had been a similar <i>imeute</i> at
Buckland River diggings in Victoria on 4th July 1857. For details
of the Lambing Flat riots see. T. A. Coghlan, <i>Labour and
Industry in Australia</i>, p. 777.]</p>
<p>The Colonial Office was embarrassed by the inconsistency of
the New South Wales Act with the Convention of Peking, signed
with China in 1860 by Great Britain and France. In this
Convention, Chinese emigrants had been conceded, at the instance
of the European powers, "perfect liberty" to take service in
British colonies and to ship themselves and their families on
British vessels. The new Act was allowed because of the
"exceptional character of Chinese immigration" to Australia. In
form it was certainly unlike the indentured labour which the
framers of the Convention had intended to promote, in opposition
to the traditional Chinese prohibition of emigration. When,
however, the Chinese diggers had been deterred from coming or had
been driven home again by poll-taxes, by popular violence and by
waning alluvial yields&mdash;they seldom ventured below as
wage-earners in deep mining&mdash;the Chinese Restriction Acts
were repealed in all the colonies&mdash;by South Australia in
1862, by Victoria in 1865 and by New South Wales in 1867. But the
deep-seated animosity of the Australian working class against
Chinese competitors was not extinguished. It blazed again in 1875
on the Palmer diggings in far northern Queensland, and was so
notorious in the 'nineties that no Chinese ever ventured to dig
for gold on the Western Australian fields. It was not their vices
that provoked animosity; they were orderly and content to be left
alone. The prejudice against them was fundamentally economic, the
resentment of a free-spending folk against men whose racial
standards of effort and endurance bore the marks of stern
competition to survive. Every habit of theirs was a threat to
impose such standards on Australia. As events shaped themselves,
the gold rushes did not materially alter the preponderance of
British blood in the colonies. The census returns of 1861 showed
the following percentages of population classified according to
birth-place: *</p>

<p>The best informed of Australian historians holds that "the
strong current, of vigorous manhood attracted to the country on
the discovery of gold" overwhelmed the ex-convicts and
"recipients of assisted passages obtained by charitable agencies"
who had formed the ordinary population of pre-gold days.** But he
is not blind to "the indifferent material of a large minority of
the people who came to Australia during the gold rushes. . . .
During the quarter century following the gold-rush, thousands of
persons whom no inducement to better their condition could incite
to steady work lived almost from hand to mouth, without care or
thought for the future".</p>

traces of convict blood in Australia, pp. 561-2.]</p>
<p>In their days of good fortune, the newcomers clamoured for
democracy, and it was given them. The constitutions shaped by
Legislative Councils during that decade of excited progress were
quickly revised in response to the cry of the easily enriched for
a right to mend all ills by new laws. Chartism was orthodoxy
among them. Its dominance is plain both in the methods and in the
programme of the Bendigo Red Ribbon Association (1853). Manhood
suffrage became law in South Australia in 1855, in Victoria in
1857 and in New South Wales in 1858. Vote by ballot came at about
the same time, and triennial parliaments have made the laws of
South Australia since 1856 and of Victoria since 1859.</p>
<p>If democratic laws could reshape for the better the means by
which folk get their living, the way was open and the will was
there. At the end of the decade the pressure on legislators
became urgent. The Australian population had risen from. 405,000
in 1851 to 1,168,000 in 1861. Under the stress of diminishing
returns in mining, the diggers clamoured for economic reform. The
independent took up Mrs Chisholm's cry for homes on the land.
Others joined the unemployed of Sydney and Melbourne and demanded
government works.* The latter palliative, however well it agreed
with older colonial practice in road-making and public building
and with the poor-law relief of which many had been recipients in
Britain, in no way solved the problem. It did not necessarily
broaden the basis of colonial production or make room for the
permanent settlement of the restless prospectors. Whether it
could do so depended on the expansion of economically sound
industries. Both land settlement and public works programmes were
enacted in every state, as will be shown later.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Three planks in the economic programme of the
Labour Movement of later generations may be traced in the demands
of the Sydney unemployed in 1858-60, viz.: (i) opposition to
piecework, (ii) preference for government employment, and (iii)
belief in reduced hours of work rather than maximum earnings. See
T. A. Coghlan, <i>Labour and Industry in Australia</i>, pp. 700,
715, 726.]</p>
<p>Yet the gold which so greatly reinforced Australian life went
mainly to confirm the strength of the pastoral industry. Of the
wonderful legacy unearthed by alluvial digging £125,000,000
in gold&mdash;the Victorian population had the first use of some
£110,000,000. It was spent mainly on meat, drink and
clothing in the first instance, and thus more than made amends
for the dislocation which the first rushes had brought to the
farms and stations.</p>
<p>The demand for more meat at higher prices quickly caused the
closing of the few boiling-down establishments which remained.
Meat prices in Melbourne rose from 1½<i>d</i>. in 1851 to
4<i>d</i>. and 6<i>d</i>. in December 1852 and 1<i>s</i>. in May
1854. Later in that year they fell forty per cent., but in 1857
good joints of beef cost 9<i>d</i>. a pound and mutton
7<i>d</i>., and these prices rose to 11<i>d</i>. and 9<i>d</i>.
respectively in 1858.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** As to prices at this period see generally T.
A. Coghlan, <i>Labour and Industry in Australia</i>, part
<small>IV</small>, chapter <small>VIII</small>, pp. 783-829.]</p>
<p>In comparison with other commodities, meat seemed cheap to the
newcomers, and their consequent adoption of Australian
meat-eating habits made them very profitable customers to
butchers and stock-raisers. The good market for meat and the less
demand for labour on cattle runs caused an increase in the
proportion of cattle, and this helped to promote the occupation
of new country, mainly in northern South Australia and
Queensland.</p>
<p>Everywhere fencing, as already described, enabled the squatter
to lessen his total labour-costs. Ex-digger contractors also
brought a new energy and economy into the transport of wool and
stores, previously carried out by unreliable station hands. Most
striking of the transport changes due to the new volume of
Australian trade was the fall in freights on wool. Faster and
bigger ships came out in greater numbers, bringing full cargoes
of eager immigrants and eagerly bought goods. Wool went as
back-loading for freights as low as a half-penny a pound, and the
abundance of shipboard space removed the necessity for "dumping"
or compressing the bales, a practice which had always troubled
the London brokers because of its effect on the appearance and
"handling" of the wool. To the squatter the best consequence of
the gold discoveries was the rise in prices in which his wool
shared to the full. Both Victorian and New South Wales wool
doubled in market value during the 1851-61 decade.</p>
<p>The pastoral industry, having successfully solved its labour
problem by fencing the runs, and having added to its oversea
market a growing local demand for meat, came out of the period of
stress stronger both in possessions and in prospects. Agriculture
was at first harder hit, but benefited equally by the bigger
demand for its wheat and dairy produce, and recovered by paying
similar attention to labour-saving. Less than half a million
acres were under crop in 1850 and over a million in 1858. But the
farmers were not yet able to feed the colonial populations and
could win no such profits as those which enabled the pastoralists
to buy out the free selectors of the next period. History and
geography still joined in raising high the squatter's throne.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII<br>
<br>
"Unlocking the Land" in New South Wales</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> names of Cumberland, Argyll, Cornwall,
Buckingham, Gloucester and Glamorgan&mdash;which were given to
the counties into which the coastal area near Sydney was divided
in 1829, and to those of Van Diemen's Land&mdash;spoke of a
purpose to make a southern Britain there. And, doubtless, the
Colonial Office felt in 1831 that at five shillings an acre
purchasers of colonial land were being endowed with the means to
found new county families, gentle and simple, squires and
yeomanry. The systematic colonizers thought of smiling farms,
with ploughland, hedgerow and meadow pushing back the primaeval
forest. By 1839, however, the Secretary of State, Lord Glenelg,
realized that in some untidy way flocks and herds were occupying
the back country before the named counties had been properly
cleaned up by "combinable labour". The Wakefieldians explained
that the price set in 1831 had been too low. "The check which it
was intended to impose upon the undue dispersion of the
inhabitants of the Colony had not been sufficient." Governments
have been fighting that "undue dispersion" ever since, sometimes
by free selection for agriculture, sometimes by subsidies and
protection to "industries".</p>
<p>By new regulations Glenelg raised the price of land to twelve
shillings an acre, and brought on a land boom. Here was an asset
whose value had been raised 140 per cent. in a day. Collapse
followed in 1841, as it must follow every mania for buying land
regardless of the net income it can yield. The good Wakefieldians
sitting as Land Commissioners in Westminster diagnosed the malady
as the outcome of Glenelg's timidity in working the magic wheel
of land-sales, emigration and settlement. They persuaded Lord
John Russell to raise the upset price to a pound an acre, and
hoped to stimulate sales and revenue, while curbing speculation,
by selling the land at a flat rate rather than by auction. All
thrifty folk might then share in the unlimited bargain, and with
the proceeds ample labour could be sent out to construct roads
and buildings worthy of a new and freer community.</p>
<p>This dream, of neat farms and combinable labour ignored the
pastoralists with their flocks and herds, making their slow way
over the dusty inland plains, now passing the precious flour, tea
and sugar over a flooded stream on a tarpaulin raft, now checking
the bullock-waggon down a "breakaway" by hitching on a fallen
gum-tree&mdash;those skirmishing explorers whose wild doings
seemed flatly contrary to the dogma of concentrated
settlement.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The ideal of concentrated settlements was not
the Wakefieldians' invention. Cf. <i>Report of Committee on
Transportation</i>, 1812, p. 4.]</p>
<p>Governor Bourke, in October 1835, confessed that he could not
"avoid perceiving the peculiarities which in this Colony render
it impolitic and even impossible to restrain dispersion within
limits that would be expedient elsewhere". The Colonial Office,
not living in a warm temperate land and fearing that he was
unsound on the fundamentals, lectured him for his lack of faith.
There was unlawful squatting in old Wales, he was told, and of
course in every new country. But "under a good and responsibly
administered law of colonization colonial squatting would be as
rare as the invasion of private estates in this country". Bourke
was not abashed. These squatters, he replied in effect, are not
gipsies but the very leaders of colonial prosperity. "Not all the
armies of England, not a hundred thousand soldiers scattered
throughout the bush, could drive back our herds within the limits
of our Nineteen Counties." He wholeheartedly supported his
advisory Council in an Act at granted annual licences to the
occupiers of "runs" of indefinite extent "outside the bounds of
settlement", charging them ten pounds apiece for licence and run.
To settle boundary disputes by local ideas of equity and good
conscience, he named district Commissioners of Crown Lands. These
steps gave official recognition to the occupation of the
"unsettled areas".</p>
<p>This was worth much. The squatter was becoming a Crown tenant;
he had a right to his run, which, once it was noted by a friendly
Commissioner of Lands, was good against everyone but the Crown.
Fights over boundaries and water-rights, formerly settled arms in
hand, gave place to legal enforcement of possession. The tract of
country occupied by the squatter and his establishment was
legally in his possession. He could bring an action against any
intruder; so ruled Chief Justice Stephen.** He was not bound to
show his title. He simply said `the Crown does not interfere with
me and I had possession before you came in'." To provide a border
police, an assessment on each squatter according to the number of
his stock was imposed by the Legislative Council in 1839. The
power of government was to be made effective in the back
country.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Quoted by Stephen Roberts, <i>Camb. Hist. of
Brit. Empire</i>, vol. <small>VII</small>, ch.
<small>VII</small>.]</p>
<p>Neither Bourke nor his successor Sir George Gipps had the
least inclination to treat the squatters as "systematic violators
of the law". "As well might it be attempted to confine the Arabs
of the desert within a circle drawn on the sands", Gipps informed
Lord John Russell (19 December 1840), "as to confine the graziers
or woolgrowers of New South Wales within any bounds that can
possibly be assigned to them: and as certainly as the Arabs would
be starved so also would the flocks and herds of New South Wales,
if they were so confined, and the prosperity of the colony would
be at an end."</p>
<p>But while impressing the graziers' importance on the
authorities in England, Gipps opposed the programme of further
privileges for which they contended in his Council. Under William
Charles Wentworth they sought security of tenure, compensation
for improvements and first right to buy their runs. Without the
first and second they could hardly be expected to build
substantial homesteads, and to make expensive improvements.
Purchase, however, if left to the squatters' option, might mean
such a picking out of the oases that control settlement as had
marked the sale of "special surveys" in South Australia. The net
of a land monopoly would early enclose the land to the prejudice
of future corners.</p>
<p>Australian land was then regarded, both in Britain and the
colonies, as a trust, vested in the Colonial Office for the
benefit of generations to come.* Gipps' superiors at home held
that the free access of graziers to the land conflicted with that
trust. The Australian pastoralist, they reasoned, had no more
right to occupy the waste lands of New South Wales, without Her
Majesty's express sanction, than a Berkshire farmer had to feed
his oxen on the Queen's demesne of Richmond or Hampton Court.</p>
<p class="foot">[* As late as 1882, a Newcastle surveyor, W.
Christie, in <i>Our Land Laws</i>, wrote: "The land belongs to
the people. We have no more right to the appropriation of the
whole of it or any part to the prejudice of posterity than the
First Fleet of colonists had to our prejudice, or than Captain
Cook had to claim the ownership to the prejudice of them".]</p>
<p>Gipps, under such pressure, resisted the squatters' demands
for security, and they, caught in "the Bad Times", made him the
scapegoat of their sudden penury. Yet in reality he was
contending for the admission of their freedom to use the land,
while maintaining his trust by refusing them virtual ownership
and monopoly. When in 1844 he judged the worst of the financial
collapse and drought to be past, he, tried to expedite recovery
by increasing the number of pastoral runs&mdash;a first essay in
"bursting up the big estates". He persuaded the Council to
constitute each twenty square miles one run, subject to the
annual charge of ten pounds per run. While he hoped thus to find
room for many ore runs with a carrying capacity of about 4000
sheep, he did not debar any squatter from holding as many runs as
he could use and rent at a profit. Twelve out of the fifteen
district land commissioners had recommended this step.</p>
<p>In new Land Purchase Regulations (3 April 1844) Gipps sought,
further, to define each squatter's "right to purchase part of his
run", granting security while avoiding exclusion. Each
run-holder, he proposed, should be required to purchase his
homestead block of 320 acres at the end of five years'
occupation, and a similar area in addition after every eight
years. If the run-holder would not buy, any other purchaser might
obtain the run by paying the retiring holder the value of his
improvements. The plan offered the pastoralist a regulated
pre-emptive right which meant either security or compensation.
Its aim was to use the Crown's ownership of the land to enforce
the admission of the most vigorous users of it. Yet it provoked
such an outcry that within three years a Pastoral Association,
formed to resist it, bore down almost every safeguard against
monopoly.</p>
<p>Emotion rather than logic inspired the Association's cry of
"Ruin or Rebellion". Any suggestion of a new obligation was
torment to nerves overstrung by speculation, by drought and the
despair of "boiling down". The pastoral leaders, with relatives
in every British shire and clients in every port or manufacturing
town, brought heavy pressure to bear on the Colonial Office. At
first Lord Stanley stood by Gipps and his regulations.
Deputations, pamphlets and petitions poured in on his successors,
W. E. Gladstone and Earl Grey; and in 1847 Orders in Council
under a new Imperial Waste Lands Occupation Act (1846) conceded
in effect all that the squatters had asked&mdash;security of
tenure, "independent" valuation of holdings and pre-emptive
rights. The obsolete limits of location between the coastal
counties and the more productive area "beyond the bounds of
settlement" were dropped, and the land was classified into
"settled", "intermediate" and "unsettled" districts. In the
settled districts pastoral tenants might have annual leases only;
in intermediate districts they might have leases up to eight
years' duration, subject to resumption with compensation at the
end of any one year; in the unsettled districts they could obtain
leases of not more than fourteen years. The pre-emptive right
given during these leases, though it did not prevent the Governor
from reserving land for public uses, excluded all other
purchasers during the term of the lease.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** See <i>V. and P. of N.S.W. Leg. Council</i>,
1847, vol. <small>I</small>, no. 120, cap. <small>I</small>,
sect. 6-9.]</p>
<p>Too late, the popular party, which had rallied under Robert
Lowe to vilify Gipps and support Wentworth, saw that they had
helped the squatters to gain a firm grip of the land. Whether the
pre-emptive right applied to any part of the run and shut out all
other buyers, as the squatters argued, or covered only the
homestead and the sites of improvements, as the Duke of Newcastle
read it in 1854, it certainly gave effective power to buy the
"eyes of the land"&mdash;to "peacock" the country as this was
called. "Sir George Gipps needs no defender now", wrote a Sydney
weekly as soon as the purport of the 1847 Orders in Council was
understood.</p>
<p>When Port Phillip District became Victoria, the pastoralists
dominant there managed by hard-driving in the Legislative Council
and in the law courts to obtain an interpretation of the Order
that obstructed all sales of Crown lands under lease, save to the
lessees. Latrobe thereupon refused to issue leases, and the
pastoralists had to be content with yearly licences carrying the
other privileges intended by the Orders in Council but not this
exclusive possession. Under such licences or leases, however,
nearly the whole of Victoria outside the mountain mass in North
Gippsland was in the possession of less than a thousand
pastoralists. As it was held that cultivation would create a
presumption of permanence in their tenure, the Orders in Council
prohibited the pastoralists from cultivating more land than was
needed to grow grain, hay, vegetables or fruit for their
establishments. This prohibition was relaxed somewhat during the
years of dislocation, but in 1854 the squatters were officially
reminded that they held their land on pastoral licences, not as
cultivators.* Before the gold rush, one of them had noted in his
diary a private opinion that the lands between Geelong and
Bacchus Marsh were the finest wheat fields in New South Wales.
Hobler wrote this when New South Wales was undivided. In the new
circumstances, pastoralist spokesmen were ready to contend that
Nature had "passed an eternal sentence of sterility" upon
Victorian land.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Victorian Government Gazette</i>, 24 April
1854. "His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor directs it to be
notified that as it cannot be considered necessary for the
welfare of the residents at the various gold-fields or other
populous districts that the cultivation of Crown Lands should
still be permitted in order to facilitate the better supply of
the necessaries of life to them, the provisions of Her Majesty's
Order in Council of 9 March 1847 (ch. 2, p. 1) subject to which
the occupants of Crown Lands are licensed must be respected and
will be enforced."]</p>
<p>The implication that the pastoral runs were to be locked up on
this indeterminate sentence was anathema to men who knew what had
been done in similar climates elsewhere.** Before the diggings
began, Victoria had been producing nine-tenths of the wheat she
consumed. The area under cultivation fell while country labour
could find far higher rewards at the diggings and on the roads
thither. In 1855 only a tenth of Victoria's breadstuffs was
locally grown. The contention that this was due to sterility was
specially galling because California, by dint of granting
"homesteads" on easy terms to her surplus diggers, was already
exporting potatoes and flour to Australian colonies of similar
climate.***</p>
<p class="foot">[** Cf. W. Howitt, <i>Land, Labour and Gold</i>
(1855), <i>passim</i>.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Addressing a committee of the Melbourne
Chamber of Commerce (1855) on the Waste Lands of Victoria, a
merchant named Train cited "the all-sufficient fact of their
paying £21 per ton for Californian potatoes and £40
to £50 per ton for American flour". California, he said,
"had been four years in becoming an exporting country".]</p>
<p>By 1860 the progress of cultivation was again very marked in
all the colonies. Victoria had 387,000 acres under crop, South
Australia 359,000 acres, Tasmania 152,000 and New South Wales
246,000. Yet the last-named colony was importing in that year
grain to the value of £580,176, as compared with
£16,939 a decade earlier, and two-fifths of Victoria's
bread still came from imports of flour and wheat.</p>
<p>The transitional governments did find ways to retain or regain
land from the pastoral net. In New South Wales a
million-and-a-half acres were reserved for public purposes, which
prevented the complete tying up of the land under pastoral
licence which troubled Latrobe in Victoria.* In both colonies a
power was re-asserted in 1854 which had been overlooked in the
heat of controversy&mdash;power to resume lands in the
intermediate districts at the end of any year. But more radical
solutions were in the air. The imperial Act granting
self-government vested in the new colonial legislatures "the
entire management and control of the waste lands belonging to the
Crown" in each colony, and also "the appropriation of the gross
proceeds of the sales of any such lands". In the new legislatures
the pastoralists soon surrendered control to the democracy of
gold-diggers and other immigrants. But they handed on with it no
torch of enthusiasm for the interests of posterity.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See. S. H. Roberts, <i>History of Australian
Land Settlement</i>, ch. <small>XVII</small>.]</p>
<p>When manhood suffrage was granted in 1858, alluvial
gold-mining was palpably profitless. Thousands of diggers had
rushed to Burrangong (N.S.W.) in 1859, but by the year's end most
of them were stranded in Sydney. Many tried and missed again at
Kiandra in the Australian Alps. But why should this unprofitable
scouting for gold continue over land of evident fertility and
abundant rainfall? Why did not the mother colony follow South
Australia's lead and unlock the land for wheat and dairy farming?
A reform recently passed in Adelaide had greatly simplified the
sale and transfer of land.** "Forty-niners" from California told
of free selection on the prairies and the Pacific coast. Recent
British history showed that even a landed aristocracy strongly
entrenched could not stand against a determined popular movement.
So it became the law in Sydney that every man, woman and child
should have the same chance to select a farm as John McArthur had
enjoyed at Camden in the Cowpastures. Surely there was still
enough for all in the 196 million acres that remained of New
South Wales after Victoria and Queensland had been carved out of
it.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See S. H. Roberts, <i>History of Australian
Land Settlement</i>, pp. 218 <i>et seq</i>. for the origins of
the Torrens system of registering titles and transfers of land,
and its rapid extension.]</p>
<p>The leader of this popular movement for "free selection before
survey" came from the ranks of the squatters themselves. John
Robertson had been a youthful pioneer "beyond the bounds of
settlement", but had no liking for Wentworth's campaign for
security of tenure.*** He was a Londoner by birth and, though
afflicted with a cleft palate, his good looks and rough candour
endeared him to a devoted political following for a full
generation.**** In 1861, after a sharp constitutional conflict in
the Legislative Council, he pushed through both houses measures
which were designed to begin an agricultural revolution and to
give every family that desired it a stake in the country. The
first, a Crown Lands Alienation Act, permitted anyone to select
40 to 320 acres anywhere from the Crown lands, the limit, being
raised to 640 acres in 1875. Each selector was to pay five
shillings an acre, a fourth of the price, when his "selection"
was duly surveyed, and was to reside on it for three years. The
only evidence needed to prove that he had done this was to be a
statutory declaration by the selector himself. The terms of
payment of the remaining three-quarters of the price were
gradually made easier.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** For another contemporary squatter's critical
analysis of the claims of pasture and agriculture, see Colin
Campbell's <i>The Land Question: A Lecture at Ararat</i>, 1861
(Mitchell Library).]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** B. R. Wise, <i>The Making of the Australian
Commonwealth</i>, speaks of his "natural gift of profanity" and
tells how in his old age, when still the admired oracle of the
anti-Federal or Geebung Party, a spirited young lady told Sir
John of a portrait of his which had appeared in the papers. If
was so like him that she had kissed it. "And did it kiss you
back?" "Oh! No, Sir John!" "Then it can't have been much like
me."]</p>
<p>This new "free selection" did not, however, supersede the sale
of Crown lands by auction; the two systems of alienation were to
be used simultaneously. Moreover, any purchaser whatever, either
by auction or on condition of residence, might take up as a
"pre-lease" three times the area he had purchased. This
"pre-lease" gave him a lease of the land for grazing which ranked
ahead of any other lease. Yet it was only a lease, and as such
was subject to the new right of or liability to selection by any
"conditional purchaser" as well as to the older form of
alienation, sale by auction.</p>
<p>The second Robertson Act of 1861, the Crown Lands Occupation
Act, substituted for the pastoral leases under the 1847 Orders in
Council shorter leases for five years only, and limited the
lessee's pre-emptive right to one twenty-fifth of the run and to
land on which he had effected improvements.</p>
<p>These Acts, though their provisions considered separately
might each seem just and indeed generous, were, as a code,
without consistency, principle or sense. Ostensibly the Acts
opened the public estate to all in the colony who wished to take
it&mdash;residence and a deposit of ten pounds being the only
qualifications for entry into the scramble. An attempt by James
Martin in 1867 to be mindful of the colony's imperial trust and
to reserve half a million acres for immigrants was denounced by
Robertson as "setting apart land for the use of Turks and others"
and failed amid "shrieks, yells and view-halloos". Already the
pastoralists and "free selectors" had forgotten every other claim
and all sense of decency in a bitter contest to assert their
jarring legal rights.</p>
<p>Wherever the land was most suitable for sheep the squatters'
wealth weighed down the scales.* Half-a-century later a friendly
American critic of Australian policies thought "the land laws of
the colonies had consistently disregarded the interests of the
labourer and the man without capital".** The results may suggest
this, but the censure on the intentions of the colonial lawgivers
is undeserved. But for that regrettable prejudice against "Turks
and others" John Robertson might have been counted an Australian
King Goodheart who</p>
<p class="poem">In his heart had found a place<br>
For all the erring human race<br>
And every wretched fellow.</p>
<p>But economic fact warped his well-meant effort to follow the
precedents of the American prairies.</p>

district, well furnished with general and detailed maps, see

Australasia</i> (1906), p. 27.]</p>
<p>The Crown lands of New South Wales were no longer the empty
range of hunting tribes. For a generation or more the
pastoralists, whatever their legal status, had made use of the
grass those lands grew, and to such good effect that their wool
was world-famous and in annually greater demand. Had Robertson
and his followers been less obsessed with the idea of spreading
agricultural homes as they had been spread in the American West,
or, nearer home, in South Australia, they might have realized
that grass was the mainstay of the whole rural population in New
South Wales, and that tillage was a risky and subordinate matter.
"In seventy out of seventy-four of the counties in the
intermediate division a patch of arable soil is useless without
pasture attached." Perhaps it was a repressed sense of this fact
that moved the author of the Act to attach to the right of free
selection "the delusion of the pre-lease"&mdash;the right to
lease for grazing three times the area purchased. But the weapon
of free selection on all Crown land turned in his hand and
annulled even this touch of realism.</p>
<p>As the leases under the Order in Council expired, the Crown
lands were thrown open to the free selectors. But the
pastoralists were still in effective possession, still entitled
to lease their runs afresh and to use their pre-emptive right to
secure picked spots. No attempt was made to partition the colony
according to its local suitability to agriculture or pasture.
"Two separate forms of tenure were instituted by law, both
authorizing the occupation of the same ground." * Such a course
might have been intelligible had it been a question of
supplanting a nomadic barbarism by civilized industry and social
security; but the pastoralists were no barbarians, their runs no
primitive wastes. Their tenure, though legally inferior, was
economically stronger. The spread of their stock had changed the
very character of the pastures. As the sheep ate out the
saltbush, which in early days stretched from the Lachlan to the
Murrumbidgee, grasses both native and new took its place in a
soil lightly tilled and compacted by their busy feet. Dams, which
when first put down emptied in a few weeks, gained carrying
capacity through the puddling of thousands of cattle and sheep.**
The Riverina of the 'forties was more of a desert than were the
lands beyond the Darling a generation later. The men who had
initiated these changes and watched their favourable and
unfavourable reactions on carrying capacity were led by a
law-made war to regard the free-selector who was invited to "jump
their claim" much as they had regarded the blacks or as the
diggers had viewed the Chinamen. But they were well able to
resist the intruders.***</p>

<p>Long afterwards, under wiser auspices, it came to be seen that
the agriculturalist could render great service to pastoral
neighbours, for in dry seasons his haystacks replaced the
vanished "top feed," and the grasses and annuals grown on his
stubbles raised the whole district's carrying capacity. But these
conditions were long delayed. During the 'sixties the seasons
conspired with the squatters to defeat agriculture in New South
Wales and illustrated the liability of the inland steppes, within
the reach but on the margin of both summer and winter rainfalls,
to wide fluctuations between drought and flood. 1862 was a year
of drought and bushfires. In February 1863 there were floods on
the coast, but drought recurred inland until early in 1865. On
the coast flood followed flood until July 1864. A favourable
season in 1866 was followed by floods with loss of life and much
property in 1867, then came drought, followed by more floods in
January 1868. In 1869 the Government proclaimed a day of
humiliation and prayer for rain. In November 1870 several hundred
settlers were homeless after a fresh deluge. "The farmers came to
consider it a mere chance whether they would be able to gather in
a crop or would lose the fruit of their labours by flood or
drought." The area under crop in New South Wales grew only from
254,283 acres in 1861-2 to 378,592 acres a decade later (1871-2),
that under wheat from 123,468 acres to 154,030 acres. Meanwhile
the sheep depastured increased from 5,615,054 in 1861 to
16,278,697 in 1871. The agricultural revolution had failed to
materialise.</p>
<p>The free selectors turned to grazing and the combat deepened.
It was bad enough when "cockatoo farmers" tried to "jump" picked
spots on the squatters' runs; it grew worse when every
"sundowner" might set up as a rival pastoralist. The Act of 1861
made no requirement that a selection should be fenced, and
sometimes the selector was a mere blackmailer. "One George
C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; selected 320 acres of land on a run in the
G&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; district. Shortly afterwards he impounded
over 700 head of the station cattle, amongst them four bulls upon
which he put £5 each, the cost to the station-owners being
£78. 1<i>s</i>. 5<i>d</i>." George had evidently chosen a
"cattle camp". "After this, one man was constantly kept on watch
for a period of five months, at the expiration of which time
C&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; deserted the selection and it became
forfeited. He had neither stock nor improvements on his selection
but lived in a calico tent only." * It was futile for Sir John
Robertson to retort that his Acts had been "framed for honest men
and not for rogues". It is the purport of an Act that the courts
enforce, and the provisions of Robertson's Act armed even honest
men for conflict.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Morris and Ranken, <i>loc. cit</i>. p.
155.]</p>
<p>As the law stood until 1875, anyone, adult or infant, might
select his or her 320 acres.** Many a family settler, by clubbing
his own and his children's selections, made up a run of perhaps
3000 acres or even more. If, as often in the Riverina, the whole
family came from south of the Murray, the result was the more
galling. Inevitably such a grazing selector overstocked his
narrow run, perhaps relying on his wheaten hay. In the first dry
season encroachments on the station pasture or dams would result.
To stop them the Act gave the squatter a complete arsenal of
weapons, offensive and defensive. The pre-emptive right had
enabled him long since to buy up water frontages and such points
of vantage. By taking a leaf from the family-selector's book, he
could defeat the pre-lease provision, setting employees or
"dummies" to purchase, as selections, the selectors' grazing
lease. Thus the squatter would "hem in" the would-be grazing
selector, making his holding too small to be profitable. But
pastoralists disliked "dummying"; "dummies" had a way of turning
nasty.*** Auction-sales of Crown lands were preferable; they were
not difficult to arrange, for it was through them the main
revenue of the colony was obtained and unpopular taxation
avoided. If land were offered on a sufficient scale, none but the
station-owner would be likely to bid. At the worst, rivals could
be bought off **** or left with areas unsaleable save to the
station. The banks and financial houses advanced the wool-men the
money needed to buy enough of their runs to secure the
continuance of the main export industry.</p>

<p>To complete the serried array of the selector's difficulties,
the Act empowered the Minister not only to allow land to go to
auction at the lessee's request, but also to sanction at
discretion purchases by the lessee of land on which he had
effected improvements. Otherwise the roving eye of the next
selector might light upon the site of a new dam. This was a
frequent source of trouble out West. No lessee was safe in
improving Crown land. By abstaining from taking possession until
the last moment allowed by law, a selector could permit the
unsuspecting pastoralist to finish a new dam at great cost: the
pastoralist might then find himself a trespasser on a selection
it had cost the blackmailer ten pounds to secure after the dam
had been begun. As much as £700 was demanded for the fee
simple in one such affair. Similar trouble arose later over
artesian bores. The parties in this civil war became skilled in
using every weapon the law provided. Purchases by virtue of bogus
improvements might at times be a necessary preliminary to real
ones, but as a rule the improvements were as fictitious as the
selectors' statutory declarations of residence. Perjury and
corruption vied with cunning and fraud.*****</p>
<p class="foot">[***** See for some curious examples W. Christie,
<i>Our Land Laws</i> (1882). The author was a licensed
surveyor.]</p>
<p>Over the broad inland plains the pastoralists held and
consolidated their runs by means of the very charter of free
selection. Wool and stock-raising, as they practised it, gave a
greater net income than the selector's wheat or mixed grazing.
But their ultimate economic strength and success obscure the fact
that the pastoralists were on the defensive. Paying more than
could then be obtained by cultivation, they bought out many a
genuine agriculturalist as well as buying the selections by river
or woolshed which had only negative economic value. All such
purchases were made to evade an insecurity created by law. All
needlessly burdened the industry and lessened its capital
resources.</p>
<p>In some areas, notably, but not solely, those unsuited to
sheep, much genuine settlement resulted from free selection. Thus
in the Bega district, on the extreme south of the coastal strip,
a compact settlement of dairy farmers took up holdings and grew
maize and root-crops on the river-flats. Easy communication with
Sydney by water made the sale of their produce very profitable.
Yet even here a preliminary survey would have, saved much
annoyance through over-lapping selections. At the other extreme
of the coastline, the Northern Rivers district, free selectors
cultivated maize and sugar by the Richmond and the Clarence.
Clashes occurred when they encroached on the cattle stations in
the hills, but the station owners learnt to defend their runs by
buying 40-acre lots at auction. "No general", it was said, "ever
posted his troops in more impregnable positions."</p>
<p>Throughout the old-settled coastal districts from the Macleay
River to Moruya Bay, little direct harm resulted from free
selection. Selectors took up land alongside the old grants, but
brought neither class-warfare nor debt nor monopoly. The old
estates were freehold and secure. Patches of good
land&mdash;isolated in the mountain valleys or hidden amid scrub,
where, under, another system, no surveyor would have
looked&mdash;were settled by free selectors, sometimes with
legitimate success.</p>
<p>On the New England and Monaro Tablelands, too, positive
results were won by selectors combining sheep-farming with
tillage. The squatters, unable to buy at auction the freehold of
their well-watered runs, most of which were worth bidding for
above the upset price of a pound an acre, had perforce to admit
the grazing farmer. Selectors quarrelled more among themselves
than with the squatters. Dummying was freely employed to fill out
selectors' holdings and to cancel pre-leases. In New England 4405
selections had been consolidated into 1560 by 1883. On Monaro,
under the snow-clad Australian Alps, the natural combinations of
summer and winter grazing with tillage were established on
holdings of from two to twenty thousand acres.</p>
<p>It was on the Western Slopes, by the Darling tributaries and
in the Riverina, that feuds between squatter and free selector
wrought most havoc. However genuine the selector's first desire
to make a home by wheat-farming, in these areas of long drought
his day was not yet. The squatter could afford to wait
patiently&mdash;</p>
<p class="poem">It is the land of lots of time<br>
Along the Castlereagh,</p>
<p>&mdash;and he seldom waited in vain. Round Deniliquin in the
Riverina the selectors who remained in 1882, out of 1426 who had
applied for land since 1865, numbered 244; of these only 48 made
any show of living by cultivation. "Most of them make little by
it", wrote the Commissioners, "but their earnings are not
disproportionate to their exertions." When at long last genuine
and dummies' selections and squatters' purchases had alike become
station property, in outward appearance there was little to show
for John Robertson's great idea but a few broken fences and some
skeletons of huts.</p>
<p>Across the Darling on the far western plains</p>
<p class="poem">Where fierce hot winds have set the pine and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myall boughs asweep</p>
<p>the free selector, making a genuine bid to cultivate, was
unknown. Yet even here the Robertson Acts wrought mischief To
prevent selection and, incidentally, to check higher Crown
rentals on the back country, the lessees bought the
water-frontages at auction, paying a pound an acre. Where nothing
less than nine square miles would make a homestead even at
favoured spots, family selection was not to be expected. Yet by
1882 some 1229 selectors had taken up 407,000 acres. Two-thirds
were "dummies", and not one in five pretended to make a home.
"Shanties" were commoner than farms. Debiting free selection
together with the loss of revenue from the leaseholds for which
this improperly condoned "peacocking" was responsible, it may be
reckoned that the three hundred shanty-keepers,* dummies and
selectors in the Western Division had by 1882 cost the colony
£10,000 each. In so level a country that lost revenue might
have built a thousand miles of railway.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The menace of the shanty may be gauged from
two references in Morris and Ranken's <i>Report N.S.W., V. and
P</i>. 1883, vol. <small>II</small>, pp. 122, 143: "The erection
of a shanty, and consequent demoralization of the shearers and
station-employees soon bring the lessee to almost any terms, and
the troublesome selector merely abandons the land to seek some
other place where he can carry out the same scheme".]</p>
<p>The concessions in Robertson's Acts to the claims of both
land-seekers and land-holders not only armed them for a social
strife inimical to orderly settlement but created confusion and
complexity in a department of law which above all should be
simple and intelligible. For the land laws "affect the interests
of a class who, though enterprising, are generally unlearned, and
affect them to a degree beyond all comparison in the ordinary
affairs of life".** Answering complaints of delay in the issue of
selectors' titles, the Surveyor-General (1880) reviewed the
administrative outcome. "There are nine stages in each
conditional purchase, ten in each improvement purchase, at which
all plans and papers touching the case must be brought together,
whereas in simple auction measurements, or measurements in
advance of demand, where no conflicting interests are to be
considered, the few plans and papers required need only be
together twice&mdash;on receipt of the measurement and at
presentation of the deed."</p>
<p class="foot">[** G.H. Reid, <i>N.S.W. Parl. Deb</i>. 1881,
vol. <small>II</small>, pp. 1495 <i>et seq</i>.]</p>
<p>Even if a conditional purchase went through without a hitch,
the 27 stages of its course at "the Lands" took a minimum of
eleven and a half months. "Draftsmen employed in charting have to
observe 74 rules, 65 of which may apply to a conditional
purchase, and 36 of them are fundamental, the infringement or
neglect of any of which might compromise the office."</p>
<p>Sir John Robertson had rejected the tidier plan of settlement
after survey in order that independent freeholders might not be
baulked of the little properties on which their hearts were set.
This was the ideal&mdash;a race of yeomen&mdash;which had made
him the popular hero and evoked enthusiasm throughout Australia.
Had the turmoil and waste been offset by this great social gain?
Had family settlement been won, even at an economic loss? In 1883
the official returns showed that since 1862 some 129,571
conditional purchases had involved the alienation of 15,421,877
acres of Crown lands, being more than twice the area (6,365,000
acres) alienated in all ways before 1862. But agricultural
activity had not kept pace with this free selection. The area
under crop had increased by only 329,545 acres in twenty
years.</p>
<p>Were there any social gains? What had become of the 129,571
selectors and their chosen spots? Under scrutiny by the 1882
Commissioners it appeared that only 62,000 purported to be
"residential selections", the rest being "additional" purchases.
Selectors who were actually resident numbered less than 20,000,
perhaps not 18,000. They fell into seven types. (1) Dummies who
selected in the pastoral lessees' interests, to prevent others
and secure the runs, numbered, at an estimate, six-twentieths.
(2) Those selecting with the aid of dummies and, before 1875, of
children, to obtain areas large enough for grazing, numbered
four-twentieths. (3) The few selectors with capital enough to
practise agriculture on sound lines, a type more valuable than
all the rest together, numbered only a twentieth. (4) Those who
by dogged energy succeeded fairly as farmers and paid their
instalments, were about three-twentieths. (5) Those "poor in
money, education and intelligence unable to compete in the
ordinary occupations of life" who took up small selections, eked
out miserable lives for a time, and finally sank into dummying,
formed five-twentieths. People of this type, having votes, would
not fail to agitate for fresh advantages, remission of interest
and so on.* (6) Blackmailers, selecting merely to be bought off,
totalled perhaps a fortieth; and (7) Those who would take up
selections, at 5<i>s</i>. an acre deposit, rather than pay timber
licences, and would cut out the timber and forfeit the selection,
numbered another fortieth.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Over ten millions of selectors' purchase-money
were outstanding in 1882.]</p>
<p>One acre in every fourteen of freehold had been cultivated
when the Robertson Act was passed, one in thirty-nine in 1880,
one in fifty-four in 1891.** The bulk of the land alienated by
conditional purchase as well as by auction had gone to the
pastoralists and had given them "the perfect security of
freehold". By 1881 ninety-six land-holders had freehold estates
covering eight million acres, averaging 84,000 acres each. Such
was the agricultural revolution effected by unlocking the land to
free selection before survey.</p>
<p class="foot">[** By 1891 New South Wales had alienated or
agreed to alienate 45,732,000 acres, including 21,325,476 under
the conditional purchase (Robertson) system. See <i>Report of
Lands Department</i>, 1892, <i>N.S.W., V. and P</i>. 1892-3, vol.
<small>IV</small>, p. 321.]</p>
<p>Indirectly, the Robertson Acts wrought havoc in the moral
standards of all classes. "The social effect of the system",
thought the Commissioners of 1883, "has been to bring into the
country too many of the poor and unthrifty who have been
bolstered up temporarily by the laws, but must eventually be a
burden to the community." The whole atmosphere of life in the
country was tainted by the many temptations to evil-doing which
the Robertson Acts left open. Perjury became a commonplace in the
lives of all settlers, young and old. The countryside was studded
with dens in which horse-thieves found harbour and sympathy.
Every effort to educate a population of rough origins was
hampered by bitter family feuds. Measures for the repression of a
fresh outbreak of bushranging during the 'sixties were impeded by
the ease with which a "gang" might use some secluded free
selection, chosen perhaps to fit their purposes. Country juries,
mindful of the adage about glass houses, were almost as willing
to condone robbery under arms as stock-thieving. The trial of the
former offence was entrusted in New South Wales to a special
commission, juries being dispensed with. When three notorious
culprits, caught red-handed after robbing a gold-escort at
Eugowra of £28,000, were condemned at a second trial, a
petition for reprieve, bearing 15,000 signatures, was presented
to the Governor. Bushranging by large gangs was prevalent
throughout the decade. Perhaps highway robbery was inevitable in
those days before railways, when even telegraph lines were scarce
and portable wealth might be had by resolute ruffians for the
taking. But free selection before survey made the tasks of the
police and the schoolmasters uphill and dangerous work.</p>
<p>How came it that, in the face of its legal and social
perversion, Robertson's Act remained virtually unamended until
1884? Chiefly because it won the support of two classes that were
beneficiaries by the Act's provisions, and ignored the scattering
of the colony's great endowment. To the genuine land-seeker,
coveting with narrow intensity a concrete spot that was all
Australia to him, what was it that posterity would suffer? He
would provide for his own by free selection. A more subtle but
equally unworthy resistance to an economical reform of the law
came from the pastoralists and the financiers. "The squatters
were content to let matters remain as they were, relying upon
their superior command of money, and ability to meet fraud by
fraud, to defeat the free selector, who menaced their runs." More
cynical still was the acquiescence of political leaders in a
scheme that had admittedly failed and was manifestly sowing seeds
of social and financial trouble. In the administration of the Act
the decision of many a critical question&mdash;whether land
should be put up for auction, and in what parcels, whether a
selector should have his chosen spot&mdash;put great power into
the hands of Ministers of the Crown and their associates. The
legislators had good reason to cling to this patronage. "It is
notorious that the most effective mode of getting business done
at 'the Lands' whether in terms of the law or with the view of
thwarting its operation, is to select a land agent who is a
member of the popular branch of the Legislature." * Finally, the
ease with which the proceeds of land sales financed the public
expenditure had its effect. It bought the acquiescence of the
general taxpayer.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>N.S.W., V. and P</i>. 1883, vol.
<small>II</small>, p. 109. Cf. p. 124 for an instance in which
the official machinery virtually invited perjury on the part of
applicants and stultified integrity on the part of the official
surveyors.]</p>
<p>The system, as worked out under ministerial interpretation,
gave the pastoralists the freehold of their runs, but at a heavy
cost. They were not philanthropists in paying enormous sums into
the Treasury. They would much have preferred definite leases at
reasonably appraised rentals, for who would pay a pound an acre
for land and load himself with an annual interest charge of
1<i>s</i>. to 1<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>., if he might have the use of
the grass for ½<i>d</i>. an acre? The pastoralists
borrowed heavily from the banks in buying the freehold, and thus
fell into debt to escape a law-made insecurity. As a result they
were tempted to overstock in order to lift the mortgages on their
land, and in the 'nineties, when the wool-market was glutted and
there were droughts of unheard-of duration, many a big,
sheep-owner was ruined.</p>
<p>Possibly of deeper significance in the end will be the damage
done to the Australian communities by the injury the long feud
inflicted on the political standing of the pastoralists. Till
well into the 'sixties they dominated most of the legislative
chambers in Australia and continued to dominate those of the
outer colonies until the 'nineties. In 1883 the Commission on the
Land Laws in New South Wales gravely noted: "It is argued that
practices cannot be condemned as illegal and immoral in which
persons of fortune, position and influence in the community have
been largely concerned".** It is not so argued now. The position
and influence of the pastoralists have suffered owing to the
shifts by which, albeit in self-defence, their foremost men in
the mother colony used the law to defeat the cause of
agricultural and family settlement. As persons of fortune they
have succeeded. But parliamentary candidates from their ranks,
however high their personal qualifications, have been handicapped
ever since by the general knowledge that, in the leading pastoral
colony, their class used the forms of law to overreach public
policy. There are few representatives in Australian politics
to-day of the most characteristic and economically important
Australians, the big sheep men; and their absence goes far to
explain the persistence with which the politics of "development"
ignore the economic facts of environment and overseas marketing.
Perhaps this is Australia's "tragic flaw".</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br>
<br>
Agricultural Settlement in the Southern Colonies</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> attractions of gold-digging and gold-mining
had raised the population of Victoria from 75,000 in 1850 to
538,000 in 1860, and a provincial journal in the latter year
rejoiced that the dwellers in the interior far outnumbered "the
once predominant citizens of the metropolis". As gold-digging
failed them, it was natural that the new-comers, despising the
pre-gold "colony of slaves and task-masters", should seek to
supply the lack of "a prosperous and well-principled middle
class" by unlocking the land. Virgin and fertile plains stretched
north and south on either side of the auriferous highlands they
had peopled. City merchants, the press, and the more
public-spirited of the squatters alike advocated this obvious
policy of settling the diggers in an industry which would win
annual and increasing wealth. Yet, being in possession of such
pastures as the new volcanic soils of the western districts and
the alluvial valleys of the Wimmera, the Lodden, the Goulburn and
the Campaspe, the squatters were but human in striving to
postpone the change.</p>
<p>Forty million acres of the best sheep-walks in Australia were
a rich endowment for defensive action, and the law's tradition of
maintaining subjects' rights even against the Crown led the
courts to construe the Orders in Council of 1847 in a sense
favourable to those in possession. There was no back country in
Victoria, like the mulga lands beyond the Darling or in Central
Queensland, to which the pastoralist alone might retreat. The
eleven million acres of mallee lands in the north-west were to
them what they had seemed to Major Mitchell&mdash;"one of the
most barren regions in the world". The squatters held their
ground and the symptoms of a violent explosion appeared.</p>
<p>In 1857 a self-constituted Land Convention assembled almost
opposite Melbourne Parliament House. The leader was an
Irish-American lawyer, Wilson Gray; and the Convention made no
secret of its intention to force free-selection upon the
legislature. Their slogan was "a vote, a rifle and a farm", and
when the first of these had been conceded they broke into the
popularly elected Assembly when it was debating a new Land Bill.
<i>The Age</i> assured the public that broken windows, bloodshed
and charges by mounted police were more than the Eastern Markets
demagogues had intended. The "popular oracles", it explained,
had, in their desire to show the earnestness of the people,
"overdone the demonstration".* But the revulsion of feeling
occasioned by this violence favoured a compromise, and after a
conference between the Houses Nicholson's Land Act of 1860
conceded selection after survey and credit payments.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>The Age</i>, 29 August 1860.]</p>
<p>The terms of the concession to land-seekers, being under equal
democratic laws necessarily open to all, proved most favourable
to those in command of money and local knowledge. When the Act
was passed nearly four million acres of the best Victorian land
had already been sold by auction. Well posted in these
strongholds, the pastoralists were able to pay for the areas now
offered, up to 640 acres in a block, prices which they were not
worth as separate holdings. And if more than one selector applied
for the same allotment it was put up for a sale by auction at
which only the applicants could bid. The scales were weighted
still further against the "small man" by the rule that half the
minimum purchase price of a pound an acre must be paid at once.
Most of the 800,000 acres alienated in the space of eighteen
months under Nicholson's Act were in the western district and
around the central goldfields. Cultivation increased, but, not by
equal steps. Selling out to a wealthy neighbour offered the
selector a better profit.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** Brooke, the Commissioner of Lands, attempted
the issue of occupation licences to small agriculturalists, on
the analogy of pastoral licences, but these were declared illegal
by the Supreme Court.]</p>
<p>In 1862, Charles Gavan-Duffy tried to prevent competition
between squatters and farmers by setting aside "agricultural
areas" for selection. When there were several applicants for any
of the 640-acre holdings into which these were divided, priority
was to be determined by lot. But Duffy's safeguards to secure the
agricultural use of the land proved ineffective. The Act gave the
selector his title, subject to the condition that he erected a
boundary fence or a habitable dwelling or cultivated one acre out
of every ten. The price, still a pound an acre, might be paid by
instalments of half-a-crown. But it was found that, in the event
of the selector selling his holding, the Crown had no power to
punish his assigns for failure to fulfil the condition. Anyone
might take up a fresh selection each year. By deputy and dummy
the squatters bought up the lands resumed. Within one week
800,000 more of the richest acres in the colony had been sold.
Before the operation of the Act was suspended by a new Ministry
it was computed that a hundred men had obtained 930,000 acres out
of 1,423,000 acres that had been alienated in accordance with its
provisions. "The very class for whom he legislated", its author
complained, "sold its inheritance for some paltry bribe".***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Cf. John Quick, LL.D., <i>History of Land
Tenure in the Colony of Victoria</i>, 1883: "The prodigality of
the State in parting, so extravagantly and incautiously with the
common inheritance has been only surpassed by the profligacy and
the ingratitude of those who were the objects of the paternal
care and anxiety of Parliament".]</p>
<p>Duffy's Act, in effect, completed the transfer of Australia
Felix in fee simple to the pastoralists. Save for a compact
settlement raising pigs and potatoes around Tower Hill (Port
Fairy) and Warrnambool, on basalt soils deriving from the last
but long extinct Australian volcano, the Western District
remained for another generation a famous sheep country and no
more. The farmers, like the railways, went beyond its fertile
stretches to the seemingly less favoured grey and red Wimmera
soils, or crossed the Divide into the oft-flooded Goulburn
Valley, or carved out clearings from the giant forests of
Gippsland.</p>
<p>The resistance of the pastoralists did not dispel the land
hunger. Where Duffy failed a versatile Scot succeeded. James
Macpherson Grant, a Sydney barrister who had turned digger and
had successfully defended the Eureka stockade leaders without
fee, was Commissioner of Crown lands in the first McCulloch
Ministry. He continued the policy of selection after survey, but
added by an Act of 1865 the simple rule that <i>bona fide</i>
settlement must precede alienation. His Act gave the selector
only a lease at first, though this was convertible into freehold
on easy terms of payment after three years of residence and the
making of substantial improvements. Three million acres had been
taken up under the new Act, and the area under cultivation had
increased from 416,000 acres to 680,000 when parliament felt
encouraged to enact free selection before survey under a similar
safeguard. Under Casey's Act, as the 1869 measure was called,
another 11,000,000 acres were selected in the Wimmera, the
Goulburn Valley and Gippsland. In the Echuca district dummying
came to light, but it was checked by a special land board. The
Commissioner for Crown elands held in reserve a discretionary
power to disallow applications, but this was seldom needed. The
three years' probationary lease was effective.</p>
<p>Genuine agricultural settlement of the Crown lands was thus
made easy; yet it was impracticable to change by such legislation
the relative attractions of stock-raising and arable farming. The
area under crop in Victoria grew from 410,406 acres in 1861 to
1,548,809 acres in 1880, but the expansion was considerably
greater on new selections than in the colony as a whole. The ease
with which virgin land might be obtained tempted men to crop
their land until it was exhausted, and then to sell out and take
up another selection. This was not mere greed. Those who
attempted to husband their land's fertility by a rotation of
crops and fallow could not escape a soil-exhaustion which made
wheat-growing on old land unprofitable. Either the farmer turned
pastoralist after buying out his neighbours to provide room for
stock, or sold out himself to an older pastoralist, and moved on
in semi-nomadic fashion to fresh wheat fields. By the middle
'eighties Victoria's agricultural progress had lost momentum. The
area under crop grew slowly from 1,500,000 acres in 1880 to just
over 2,000,000 in 1890, while that under wheat was stagnant at
1,100,000 from 1883 to 1890.</p>
<p>Nor did Victoria escape the bushranging revival. The wild
tumble of mountains and river-valleys in the northeast of
Victoria, opened to selection under the later Acts, had retained
since the digging days a name for lawlessness. In 1878 a gang of
bushrangers, famous in Australia as the last of the outlaws, and
the heroes of a dramatic "last stand", issued from this region.
Sons of John Kelly, a convict who was sent out to Van Diemen's
Land in 1841 for attempting to shoot his landlord in County
Tipperary, Ned, Jim and Dan Kelly had gone with their mother in
1865 from Wallan to Eleven Mile Creek, near Glenrowan. There they
were soon plying the family trade as stock-thieves. Ned was
arrested as an accomplice of Power, a New South Wales bushranger,
but identification failed. Some say he betrayed Power, but a
Victorian police Superintendent, named Hare, stoutly denies this
charge.* Jim, his younger brother, was "doing time" in New South
Wales&mdash;a ten years' sentence, and his second&mdash;when both
Dan and Ned got into trouble again with the Victorian police.
There had been "bad blood" between them and the troopers, one of
whom had made love to their sister Kate, and in April 1878, Dan,
a boy of only seventeen, was "wanted" on several charges of
horse-stealing. Ned aided his brother's escape by shooting
Constable Fitzpatrick in the arm when he came to the Kelly home
to arrest him. Then with two young companions, Steve Hart (18)
and Joe Byrne (21), natives of the district, the Kellys took to
the ranges that lie between Wangaratta, Euroa, Mansfield and
Beechworth&mdash;a region well-watered all the year round,
snow-clad on the heights in winter, seamed by rough ridges and
pitted with wooded gullies where the gang might rely on their own
or their friends' bushcraft to evade all search. In such country
stock-thieves had long been expert at "planting" their captures,
blotting brands and assembling mobs for sale on whichever side of
the border suited their purpose. Drovers gave the ranges a wide
berth, for any youngster they met might be a scout or
"bush-telegraph" to the Kellys, Quirts or other marauders.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In his <i>Last of the Bushrangers</i>
(1892).]</p>
<p>In October 1878 a party of four police sent from Mansfield to
the Wombat Hills was surprised by the four bushrangers. Its
leader Sergeant Kennedy and another trooper were shot dead and a
third was wounded. The Victorian ministry declared the gang
outlaws and put a reward of a thousand pounds on the head of
each. But the countryside stood neutral. The Kellys never wronged
a woman or a poor man. The feud was between them and the
police.</p>
<p>In December they sprang on Euroa, within a hundred miles of
Melbourne, "stuck up" Younghusband's station three miles out,
then the National Bank in the township. There they took
£2200 in cash, locked the banker and the station folk in
the station store and made off successfully to the bush. In
February they appeared at Jerilderie in the central Riverina, by
way of answer to New South Wales' derision of the Victorian
police. Ned roused the Jerilderie police at midnight with an
alarm of murder. They came out unarmed and were put in their own
lock-up, after doffing their uniforms. Dressed in these the
Kellys had their horses shod by the police farrier, giving
themselves, out to be "relieving the constables". They then
"relieved" the Bank of New South Wales of £2140, and used
the Royal Hotel as a temporary prison where Ned Kelly locked up
the townsfolk and in a curt speech bade them stay where they were
until the gang got well away. The New South Wales Government put
another thousand pounds reward on each outlaw's head.</p>
<p>For more than a year after the gang remained in hiding. Every
effort of the police, even with black trackers from Queensland,
proved futile. On 27 June 1880, however, near Glenrowan, they
called Aaron Sherrit to his own door. He was an ally who had
agreed with the police to betray them, and they shot him as he
came out. The outlaws then galloped to Glenrowan. There they
placed sixty people in the hotel, many of whom were sympathizers,
tore up the rails of the main North-Eastern line on a dangerous
embankment nearby, and proceeded to loot the town. But, unknown
to them, a lame schoolmaster called Curnow had got away, stopped
the train and notified the police down the line. At dusk on the
28th the police closed round the township. At dawn Ned Kelly was
still firing into the police from outside the ring, but he was
wounded in the foot and unable, perhaps unwilling, to escape.
Several shots palpably hit him but failed to do him hurt. At last
another in the legs brought him down. He was heavily encased in
helmet and breastplate hammered out from the mould-boards of
ploughs. Later in the day the hotel was burned to the ground over
the dead bodies of Dan Kelly, Byrne and Hart.</p>
<p>They were mere boys, "wild colonials" who had had little chance
of knowing better, and the setting of their death, trapped as
they were by their life-long enemies, the police, in the presence
of their neighbours and kin, scalds the heart. At Melbourne a
meeting of five thousand, passionately harangued by an
ex-Minister of the Crown, urged the Government by unanimous
resolution to spare Ned Kelly from the extreme penalty of the
law. Nevertheless it was fit and historically apt that a
schoolmaster, though he limped to do it, rid the colony of a pest
which was a reminder of a dark age. No amount of sentiment can
disguise its sordid and criminal features.</p>
<p>South Australia started with better human material and her
economic development was least warped by transportation and
gold-rushes. After half-heartedly attempting to open the
puzzling. Murray mouth and to play a commercial role in serving
the Murray-Darling basin by river transport,* the province found
prosperity by means of the agricultural resources of her central
rift-valley and of the folded hills of rich alluvium beside
it.</p>
<p class="foot">[* These attempts are admirably reviewed in A.
Grenfell Price's "South Australian Efforts to Control the
Murray", <i>A.A.A.S., Perth Transactions</i>, 1926, pp. 444 <i>et
seq</i>.]</p>
<p>Isolation and the different quality, of her colonists might
have made her an Australian and nonconformist South Island. Yet
even in South Australia, a land without precious metals of her
own, the backwash of the mining rushes forced on the conflict
between pastoral and agricultural use of the soil and brought
industrial ambitions and standards out of intercolonial rivalry.
In the 'fifties the exodus of her adventurous sons to "the
fields" caused the thorough use of Ridley's "stripper" in
harvesting the wheat crop. The 'sixties saw a rapid extension of
stock-raising and agriculture to meet the goldfields' demands,
and an exodus of disappointed or would-be farmers to select land
under the radical laws of New South Wales and Victoria. Thereupon
the province overhauled her land system and for a time her
legislators copied, with a certain caution, experiments in the
art of colonization which once they had been proud to teach.</p>
<p>Even after the discovery in 1860-61 of the rich Wallaroo and
Moonta copper deposits, agriculture produced crops that in normal
years rivalled in value the products of the mining and pastoral
industries combined. Little farms continued to multiply and
spread. From 1862 to 1880 the area under wheat in South Australia
and the wheat-harvest were about equal to those of all the other
colonies put together. After 1866 wheat was exported in
fluctuating but considerable quantities to Britain. By 1881 the
cultivation per head in South Australia was 7.5 acres as compared
with 1.7 per head in Victoria and four-fifths of an acre per head
in New South Wales. The Mediterranean climate of South Australia
is far better suited for wheat-growing than the coastal lands
then favoured by farmers in Victoria and New South Wales.** But
in turning that advantage to good use the intelligence of South
Australian farmers evolved a labour-saving technique. Until the
late 'sixties the ripe crops were gathered with reaping hooks in
the slow-ripening fields of the S.E. coasts, and the hay was mown
with scythes. The sheaves carted in at "harvest home" were
stacked and laboriously threshed with the flail and the grain was
winnowed with sieves on windy days. Ridley's "stripper", a header
pushed at first by two horses, did its work best in a dry crisp
air, such as lasted in South Australia's harvest-time from
dewless dawn to dark. This was but the first, though it was the
most decisive, of the inventions by which the farmers of that
province left vacant the places deserted by those who rushed to
the gold-diggings, yet increased production and lowered their
costs. Victorians adopted the stripper after a bumper harvest in
1866-7. An average wheat yield of 22.25 bushels tempted the
reapers to demand forty shillings an acre to cut the crop. After
that the strippers were in great demand. Not only did they cut
the crops on the old wheat-growing areas more cheaply than such
hard-bargaining fellows, but, what was more important for
Victoria's future, they encouraged selectors under Grant's Act to
venture inland to districts like the Wimmera where the summers
were like those of South Australia. With the strippers the grain
could be taken off quickly before the north wind's mighty flail
had threshed it for the birds.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See map facing p. 252 in S. H. Roberts'
<i>History of Australian Land Settlement</i>.]</p>
<p>One invention suggested another in a community whose best
minds were as yet undistracted from the main issue of producing
more wheat and wool. After strippers came into use in South
Australia, a new method was devised of clearing the scrublands
thrown open to selectors in 1869. Prior to this only those who
had other land for cropping could afford the five years needed to
break in scrub or mallee land. The method adopted had been to cut
the scrub at about a foot above ground, to pile the debris around
the stumps and burn soon after the new shoots appeared.
"Sucker-bashing"&mdash;a very arduous business with the
mattock&mdash;was still needed after this and raised the cost of
killing the scrub to fifteen shillings an acre. But the cleared
land grew good grass. Those who had sheep could get some return
for their expenditure even during the five years before the roots
were ready to be drawn from the ground. These, if a market
offered, were sold as firewood for the towns.</p>
<p>A settler named Mullens at Wasleys (S.A.) made farms of
nothing but scrubland both practicable and profitable. He cut the
scrub level with the ground, burnt it off and then scratched the
soil with a heavy triangular log through which he had driven
strong spikes. From soil enriched by the ashes of a "good burn"
this "scratching in" * would produce a few crops that showed a
good margin of profit above the light costs involved. But such
farms in the South Australian mallee needed constant attention
with the "fire-rake" to keep down the regrowth of suckers. Other
scrubland selectors, of whom R. B. Smith of Ardrossan (Yorke's
Peninsula) was probably first, went one better and contrived a
plough that thoroughly turned up this "Mullenized" land and
incidentally loosened many of the roots. Its two, three or more
shares worked independently, and each, as it struck an ungrubbed
stump, tripped, passed above it "at the trail", and was sent back
into the soil by a strong spring so soon as the stump was jumped.
After such multiple-furrow "stump-jump" ploughs came lighter
cultivators, seed-drills and complete harvesters, the most
successful form of which was the work of a young Victorian
farmer, H. V. McKay in 1884. More than one South Australian
claimed to have anticipated McKay in making a complete harvester,
capable of stripping and winnowing in one operation. Whoever was
the inventor, there is no question of the important part in
maintaining net profits that "harvesters" have played. With such
a machine the farmer may, single-handed, drive his team into the
ripe crop and, while daylight and endurance last, pour the wheat
into the jute corn-sacks ready for sewing up and delivery at the
mill or the railway siding.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* It is customary to explain the term "cockey
farmer" by the analogy between this scratching in and the
cockatoo's habits. More probably the phrase is a corruption of
"cockney farmer". See reference to <i>Hobler Papers</i>, p. 93,
note 2, <i>supra</i>.]</p>

McKay's Sunshine Harvester, see the <i>Australian
Encyclopaedia</i>, vol. <small>II</small>, p. 664.]</p>
<p>After 1876 such aids were badly needed by South Australian
farmers. From that year to 1904 not one crop reached a ten-bushel
average, eighteen fell below a six-bushel average, and prices
ruled low. Nine of the poor harvests were reaped in succession,
from 1894 to 1902 inclusive. That was a spell of prolonged
drought, but not all the years from 1876 to 1904 were drought
years. Soil-exhaustion far and wide was mocking the farmers long
before the Big Drought set in.</p>
<p>From the first, South Australia had conceded them effective
rights to displace squatters from their leases of Crown land. As
a consequence the farmers enjoyed a reasonable freedom to test
their relative ability in turning the province's sun-baked soil
to good use. No suggestion of security of tenure was granted to
Crown lessees until after 1847. Then under the Orders in Council
they obtained "permissive leases" up to 14 years in duration,
outside the "hundreds" surveyed for agriculture and sale. These
did not prevent resumptions. A favourite means of raising revenue
continued to be "killing a squatter", i.e. giving a Crown lessee
six months' notice and then surveying his run into hundreds.
Despite this slight security, the goldfields market and the
northern explorations of Stuart and McKinlay had led during the
'fifties to a fourfold increase of stations shipping from Port
Augusta at the head of Spencer Gulf. Goyder, the
Surveyor-General, reappraised these northern runs after a series
of good seasons, but immediately after his doing so most of them
were abandoned. A pitiless drought left them bare from 1864 to
1869. After the drought, Crown rentals, based on stock actually
carried, replaced the double impost of fixed charge plus
assessment on official estimates of "capacity". But what made
restocking practicable after the drought was not the easier,
rentals so much as the fences, wells and dams which took the
place of the sod-huts and movable hurdles of shepherding
days.</p>
<p>By 1872 the expensive yet economical ways of capitalism had
universally replaced the nomadic patriarchal style. Capitalism,
being expensive, called for some security of tenure. This came
through the operation of radical land-laws.</p>
<p>In the south of the province sale by auction of Crown lands
withdrawn from pastoral occupation did not satisfy the farmers'
land-hunger after the 'sixties. Land-agents&mdash;some called
them "land-sharks"&mdash;divided the spoil at or near the upset
figure of a pound an acre. They deterred genuine land-seekers by
threatening to bid against them for the particular block they
sought. For this reason, to quote Stephen Roberts, "the trek of
the covered waggons of the German settlers was a common sight in
the late 'sixties, and a continual stream slowly wound across the
plains towards Albury and the easily acquired land". Such sights
were a scandal in the chosen home of systematic colonization and
many were the proposals and investigations for a remedy. In
November 1865 the Surveyor-General went north to mark where the
rainfall had extended, even during drought. He found the "line of
demarcation extending considerably further south" than he had
anticipated and traced it from Swan Reach through Burra Hill,
Oak Rises, Mount Sly, Mount Remarkable and Broughton across the
gulf to Franklin Harbour and N.W. to the west end of Gawler
Ranges. As a result of Goyder's investigations the stock runs
were re-graded into four classes,* and his work was naturally
given prominence as an historical generalization upon the
incidence of drought. Botanists think Goyder based his judgment
on the prevalence of perennial and other salt-bush and of mallee.
But such was his prestige at the time, as a permanent official
well endowed with both knowledge and pluck, that "Goyder's Line"
was almost immediately accepted as marking the "safe country" for
wheat farming.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>S.A., V. and P</i>. nos. 62 and 78 of
1865-6, no. 133 of 1865-6, 16 February 1866.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** T. G. Taylor, <i>Australian Environment</i>,
1918, p. 98, praises Goyder's work as a model in estimating the
possibilities of new country. It was essentially a brilliant
surmise but its definite nature has been overstated. His maps and
journeys show evidence of indecision and he made minor
alterations subsequently. It does not coincide with the 14 inch,
the 12 inch or any line of rainfall, and follows the salt-bush
closely only near the Burra. Wheat-farming with modern methods
has gone far beyond it and the modern geographer hesitates to
mark "The Line" on his maps for fear of reviving the deterrent
power it once had.]</p>
<p>In 1869, Goyder reported on the working of Grant's Act in
Victoria, and in that year Henry Strangways, an English barrister
who had quickly taken the lead in South Australian politics,
carried a measure similarly designed. It maintained auction sales
of land for the sake of "revenue", but permitted deferred
payments while restricting the transfer of blocks sold on credit.
Selection was allowed only after survey and within defined
agricultural areas. As usual, selection tempted men into
dummying, especially in the competition for rich pockets of land
round Mount Gambier in the south-east. Conditional purchase after
survey was extended by a Waste Lands Act of 1872 to the whole
area inside "Goyder's Line". Some farms beyond this line had been
under cultivation, however, as early as 1867, and after 1874
there was increased activity in taking up areas offered for
selection in the far north, i.e. north of Port Augusta. Good
seasons flattered the venturesome and many were ready to argue
that rain followed the plough.</p>
<p>The outward surge of agriculture was met by a shift of
wool-growers to the south. When the policy of resumption was
active, banks were chary of advancing money to Crown lessees for
expensive improvements; and all the pastoral leases were to be
put up for auction in 1888, not a distant date in risky country
where repayments are often delayed by "act of God".</p>
<p>To make insecurity worse, rabbits came in waves down the
Murray valley and over the interior, and in the 'eighties drought
returned. Soon it was seen that "good stations had been ruined to
make bad farms". The plough had out-paced the rain-clouds and
there was nothing for the northern farmers but to abandon their
bare, windswept fields and "toe the Line" once more. For some of
them benevolent governments found southern holdings in exchange.
Payment of interest on purchase money was remitted and payment of
principal postponed. In areas thought doubtful for farming some
were induced to stay by renewable leases in lieu of purchase.
Representative boards were created to adjust rentals and renew
the pastoral leases, to keep watch against dummying and to
classify land so that selectors' obligations might vary with the
productive power of their land.</p>
<p>Under flexible administration by these standing boards, the
Acts of 1869 and 1872 grafted conditional purchase after survey
on to the Wakefield system, as a corrective to the vice of
speculation that had beset it. The primary aim was still
agriculture, in a moving equilibrium with pasture. Kindly,
intelligent amendment maintained the province's name for
progressive idealism in her land laws. Yet neither parliament nor
representative boards had it within their power to amend the
soil. Its exhaustion continued to make the cultivators restless.
From 1880 until well into the new century, about 1907, the total
area under the plough was stagnant at 2,200,000 acres, while that
under wheat fell back from the 1,942,453 acres recorded in
1884-5. The cause was evident. From an average of 11.2 bushels an
acre from 1861 to 1865 the yield had fallen to 5.43 bushels an
acre for the years 1881 to 1885. Worse was to come during the
great drought. For the years 1896 to 1900 inclusive, South
Australian farmers harvested an average of 4.1 bushels to the
acre. Well might Sir William Crookes, in surveying the world's
wheat resources, wonder why they persisted. By that time,
however, hope had dawned. At Roseworthy Agricultural College,
founded in 1879, Professor Custance, the first principal, put his
finger on the weakness that was depressing the yield&mdash;an
exhaustion of the phosphates always in short supply in.
Australian soils. He advocated as remedy the dressing of the land
with soluble superphosphate. For more than a decade the practical
men smiled at Custance and his successor, Professor Lowrie. Then
they gave "the handful of magic dust" a trial, and a new era in
the Australian economy began.</p>
<p>To face the double insecurity of drought and legislative
changes the pastoralists of South Australia relied on another but
equally rare type of insight, and succeeded so well that they
bought up many a baffled farmer's freehold in the central area of
the province. The sheep brought by the first colonists were
largely of Leicester and South-down breed. Angas's South
Australian Company added Merinos from Saxony, Mecklenberg,
Tasmania and New South Wales. These and the overlanders' flocks
of the same breed throve at once, and South Australian
sheep-breeders evolved a special type of Merino which won the
province high fame for her weighty fleeces. Darwin held that not
one man in a thousand had the accuracy of eye and judgment
adequate to the breeder's task. The flock-masters of South
Australia numbered several such breeders amongst them, notably
John Murray of Mount Crawford, and early learned to follow their
lead. Without bringing in fresh blood, but simply by inbreeding
and culling the unwanted variants, generation after generation,
they, fixed a robust and vigorous type with a heavy fleece of
long-stapled fine wool, an animal, because of its lack of
wrinkling, least likely to suffer from the dreaded blow-fly. As a
rule, South Australian flockmasters eschewed "artificial
feeding", looking to the survival of the fittest chosen to
maintain the vigour of their stock and to adapt it even to the
chronic drought of the northern salt-bush country.</p>
<p>Tasmanian and Western Australian colonists strove during the
second half of the nineteenth century to rid their communities of
the economic stigmata of transportation. The Tasmanians had the
more obvious need to do so. In 1840 there were 27,246 convicts in
the island as against 40,432 free, of whom only 13,000 were
adults. Between 1841 and 1852 some 35,378 more convicts were sent
thither. Making all allowance for the eagerness of expirees to
quit the scene, the population of 68,870 in 1850 was saturated
with "lag" blood.* The road construction and other pioneering
tasks done by the prisoners were stultified for decades by the
handicap, largely but not wholly psychological, with which "the
system" and its products weighed down a little country by no
means poor in natural resources.</p>
<p class="foot">[* According to J. B. Brigden, <i>Tasmania, an
Economic Sketch</i> (1927), p. 14, in the ten years 1851-1860
some 88,660 emigrants were replaced by 77,080 immigrants, yet the
population "had fallen in productive quality".]</p>
<p>In 1858 the new legislature thought to try the fashionable
policy of unlocking the land as a corrective of the inertia that
had resulted from the exodus to Victoria. But there was little
good land left to be unlocked. East of a line from South Cape to
Surrey Hills three million acres had already been sold, two
million were under grazing licences, and a million in guaranteed
"quiet enjoyment" for ten years. These were the "settled' lands".
The wet Western third of the island remained smothered under
almost impenetrable scrub. The new law retained auction sales of
Crown land and, as in New South Wales, there was more alienation
than agricultural settlement. In 1863 "agricultural areas" in the
north-east were offered for selection but succeeded little
better. The offer bore witness to a consciousness of one of
Tasmania's natural handicaps, the scattered deposition of her
assets. But the root cause of the colony's trouble was that, in
wheat growing as in wool, her resources were inferior to those of
the mainland, though her climate was attractive to colonists
fresh from England. Van Diemen's Land had been exporting wheat to
the Sydney market before her settlers took up wool under Governor
Sorell's guidance, and in 1850 she had produced more than the
mainland. But the transition from gold-mining to agriculture in
Victoria and the superior advantages and energy of the South
Australians brought the price of wheat below the marginal costs
of production in Tasmania. The area under wheat began to shrink
in the 'sixties. Farmers in the island were victims of
soil-exhaustion even earlier than those in South Australia, and
their government provided no such technical instruction as the
Roseworthy College men gave their competitors. So Tasmanian wheat
was driven out of its natural market in Victoria by South
Australian and Californian competition. Emigration continued. A
quarter of the land revenue was ear-marked after 1864 for roads
and wharves, but as land sold very slowly both revenue and public
works fell away. Even sheep-pasturing barely held its own. An
attempt was made to extend it into the rainy "unsettled lands"
towards the West Coast. Areas of from 60 to 640 acres were
offered as free rewards to any settlers who might possess capital
equal to a pound per acre acquired and would use it to effect
improvements.</p>
<p>To bait the hook, grazing leases of as much as 10,000 acres in
adjacent mountainous country were added. On these the grantees
might expect at least to reimburse clearing costs by felling
timber and exporting it to the builders of Victoria. But
Tasmania's luck held. In the 'sixties even that market slumped,
for, once more, superior resources were found north of the
Straits.</p>
<p>When Victoria set up her tariff wall, Tasmanian depression
grew even deeper. Projects of reciprocity were "gravelled for
lack of matter". What had the island to offer that David Syme
should relent from his ideal of self-sufficiency? A retaliatory
tariff failed to put any pressure on the wealthier and younger
community. It extended "the dull indigence of Hobart" to the
northern half of the island, which had hitherto extracted some
prosperity from trade with Melbourne. The expenses of government,
when severely pruned, were almost met in good years by the sale
of as much Crown land as buyers could be induced to take, but the
banks had little liking for advances to enable their clients to
buy land on which fluke and scab were prevalent.</p>
<p>In 1871 came the first signs of change. As usual a man named
Smith turned the colonists' attention to mining, though in this
instance he was reversing the process of economic change on the
mainland. The Tasmanian Smith&mdash;James by name&mdash;returned
from the diggings but refused to settle down at farming. He
earned the nickname of "the Philosopher", apparently by his
eccentric persistence in searching for gold-bearing quartz. He
found tin in 1871 at Mount Bischoff in the north-west.
Tin-mining, though it seemed a tame thing after Victoria's gold,
did something to revive enterprize, and in 1875 further deposits
were found in the north-east. In the year following, Hobart and
Launceston were joined by rail, and in 1877 gold was found at
Beaconsfield near the Tamar mouth. Finds of silver-lead and
copper followed in 1885-6 at Mount Zeehan and Mount Lyell on the
west coast where Tasman had first seen the land, long before. For
the first time for many decades immigrants came to swell the
island population. Tillage increased in the scattered valleys.
Potatoes from the north-west and apples in the Derwent and Huon
Valleys were added to the island's tally of exports. Governments
took courage and launched into active loan expenditure on
transport facilities, railways, roads and bridges. The spell over
the island seemed to be broken at last.</p>
<p>In Western Australia, transportation, deliberately accepted,
and triply safeguarded by the reform of the penal code in
Britain, by the exclusion of female prisoners and by the
employment of the men solely on public works, did less harm, on
balance, than anywhere else. The "chronic despondency" of the
stagnant decades passed after 1870 when a representative council
was called to a wider vision and solid achievements by Governor
F. A. Weld * and the native-born explorer-statesman John Forrest.
The pastoral horizon widened when in that year grass-land was
found on the Hampton Tableland, and when in 1874 splendid
salt-bush and mulga were found on the Murchison and Sandford
water-courses inland from Champion Bay. Governor Weld had had
experience in New Zealand both as settler and administrator, and
dealt with the patchy character of the land available for
tillage, as South Australia was doing, by classifying each area
and varying the terms of selection with the quality of the land.
To squatters he offered the security of fourteen-year leases with
rights of pre-emption. In 1880 pastoral occupation followed
Alexander Forrest's exploration of Fitzroy Plains in the far
north. In 1885 a railway reached York in the sweeter lands of the
Avon Valley beyond the Darling escarpment, and wheat farming
prospered there in a quiet way. It may have been only by
comparison with days of narrower things that the colonists felt
satisfied. To John Forrest, acting "comptroller of expenditure"
after 1880 and surveyor-general after 1883, free selection of
small blocks for agriculture meant nothing very grand. He bowed
to the strong desire for its retention, but thought "free
selection had in many places resulted in spoiling the country,
having dotted over it quite unimproved small locations securing
water-holes, springs and small pieces of good land which it would
have been better for the colony never to have sold".**</p>
<p class="foot">[* For an able review of the state of the colony

<p class="foot">[** Surveyor-General's <i>Report for 1883, W.A.

<p>To check such peacocking and to protect the pastoral tenants
from blackmail, Forrest adopted the usual devices of liberal
land-laws such as "agricultural areas", long terms of sale on
credit, the issue of titles only after a probationary lease and
due improvement. Pasture alone made headway as yet, but he had
laid on sound lines his long campaign in favour of agriculture.
The sheep in the colony passed the first million in 1879 and two
millions in 1888.</p>
<p>By then the whole atmosphere had changed. Gold was found in
1883 in the torrid East Kimberley, and, though most who rushed
thither in 1884-5 rushed back to Cambridge Gulf in a
thirst-stricken retreat, gold was won in fair quantities. The
sententious report in which E. Hargraves, the New South Wales
gold discoverer, had discoursed on "the non-auriferous character
of the rocks of Western Australia" lost its authority and men
found traces of gold at widely scattered points from Albany to

<p>The general result of the period of land reform surveyed in
the preceding two chapters was disillusionment. Unlocking the
land had opened no door to unlimited gains by farming. Neither
the go-as-you-please policy of New South Wales, nor the survey of
agricultural areas in advance of settlement favoured in the other
colonies, had enabled the farmers to make much headway in
displacing the squatters. Save in South Australia, wool remained
the staple by virtue of the greater net returns it brought. Even
in South Australia, the norm of an unforced colonial economy,
neither liberal land-laws, nor rich soil, nor both together had
been enough to assure settled prosperity to the farmers. Only
rare qualities of invention, tenacity and insight had kept them
from faltering and were to restore their strength at the end of
the century. In the 'seventies and 'eighties, throughout the
south-eastern colonies the banks spread their branches into the
squatting districts, the station men bought their runs, fenced
them, watered them and bred up their flocks. Certainly wheat was
not yet the master word. The Australian farmer had much beyond
politics to learn before his strength came upon him.</p>

<br>
<p>The ineffectiveness of radical laws to promote the farming
interest at the expense of pasture might well have impressed on
thoughtful observers the social meaning of the price of land.
Wakefield had had a glimmering of that meaning when he advocated
a "sufficient" price, one that would impede all and sundry from
becoming "land poor" by taking up land they could not profitably
work. But he did not appreciate that in land values, which are to
keep the varying parcels of town and country land in hands
capable of putting them to the best use, variation with changing
circumstances is essential. It may even be doubted if he saw
that, apart from changes in the market value of land-products,
the sufficiency of a price varied with the fertility and
situation of the land. A price sufficient to put an end to
settlement at Australind and in Western Australia generally was
so low in South Australia as to invite the speculative purchase
and re-sale of metalliferous land at the Burra and even of good
wheat land on the Plains and broad highland valleys. For
political reasons the price at which the government sold public
land had to be given a false uniformity. The government could
not, without an appearance of hard-bargaining, charge what the
traffic would bear. Yet democracy's benevolent intention to
temper the wind to the farmer's shorn lamb could not endow the
tender creature with the vigour that enabled the pastoral ram to
survive and fatten. And it came to pass that demagogues dispersed
the public estate and pastoralists gathered up the freehold
thereof.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV<br>
<br>
Plantation Slavery and Secession for North Queensland</h3>
<br>
<p><small>IN</small> spite of some variation in their minor
economic activities, the Australian communities, festooned along
a coast-line of ten thousand miles, are nowadays strangely
uniform in social structure. In each port&mdash;there are less
than a score that count for much&mdash;you will find a group of
importers' warehouses, some big wool-stores, a railway terminus,
a wharf-lumpers union and a number of public houses tied to
breweries. If there is a capital city in the near background, it
is inhabited largely by a civil service concerned with. Crown
lands, public works and education. Its environs will boast some
industries engaged on the simpler manufactures or on the repair
and maintenance of the mechanism of land transport. Ships, if
they can, seek cheaper repairs elsewhere. Dairying, grape-growing
and its derivatives, sugar and other tropical plantations may
seem to flourish on the coastal areas, but do so largely through
Government aid. Over the range is the scene of the peculiarly
Australian work, done by a scattered population of miners,
farmers and station-hands, who turn out staple raw-products on a
rough, grand scale with labour-saving machinery that is the
worthiest output of the town factories.</p>
<p>Brooding over the coastal capital, and browbeating with their
vociferous claims the mercantile and professional classes who,
but for fear of the "wowser" vote, would mould the economic
policies of the country on more orthodox lines, stand the
federated trade unions. Their Trades Hall is the scene of a
fluctuating contest between the capable leaders of three groups:
(i) the shearers, miners and timber workers of the bush, (ii) the
town artisans, and (iii) the transport workers and public works
employees. These contend for mastery, somewhat noisily at times,
through the primaries or "selection-ballots" that name the labour
candidates for the local or national parliament. More
continuously they learn the arts of parliamentary debate and
constitution-making in holding or capturing the state party
machine. The farmers, with some aid from pastoralists and the
middle class, are learning political organization from the
workers, but are still clumsy and inarticulate. This social
structure varies little with the minor staples that differences
in local climate may add to the dominant wool and wheat. The
Australian communities have set in these forms with a surprising
uniformity. In the politics of each, the drive comes mainly from
a hard-eyed, hard-headed, hard-mouthed working democracy.</p>
<p>Queensland once promised to evolve quite a different social
tissue comparable to the planter-aristocracy of the Old Dominion
and the Carolinas in the days of Calhoun and Henry Clay. Miss
Flora Shaw (the late Lady Lugard), stressing the contrast between
temperate and tropical Australia, at the Colonial Institute in
1894, predicted that "if North Queensland obtains the political
separation for which it is agitating the nucleus of the
development of tropical Australia will have been formed. The
creation of other tropical colonies, in which the habits of
thought, the aims and traditions will differ widely from those of
the existing Australian communities, will be only a question of
time". But Southern Queensland, with effective aid from Whitehall
at more than one juncture, offered so determined a resistance to
secession and social differentiation that economic forces had
time to assimilate the north and to cut away the bases of the
planters' will to rule:</p>
<p>After the wild scramble for alluvial gold, the wool-growing
industry resumed its sway as premier industry throughout
Australia and tightened its grip on the southeastern colonies
under cover of the radical land laws. In so doing it pressed into
its service the bigger and better resources of money and men that
the golden age had furnished. But its geographical centre had
moved definitely northward. Before the gold discoveries, the
flocks of Port Phillip District vied on almost even terms with
those of a New South Wales that still included Queensland. Twenty
years later the wheat-growers were restlessly disputing for the
land south of a line from Port Augusta in South Australia to
Mount Kosciusko. North of that line the superior power of the
pastoralist to make profitable use of the land grew more marked
as the winter rains gave place to the summer rains. Queensland
seemed to the pastoralists "their promised land". Leslies,
Campbells and Archers showed the way, and in the 'sixties scores
of southern squatters sought safety there from the free selector.
Black spearsmen ambushed their stock in the brigalow scrub. They
besieged even numerous station households in a strength and
determination forgotten farther south, and murdered isolated
shepherds and carters with tragic cunning. In Queensland men went
about their daily task with shot gun in hand, and nightly folded
their sheep because pastoral occupation was still an invasion of
territory held in force by resolute enemies. But native
resistance could not stop the invaders. "The natural progress of
the aboriginal race towards extinction" * soon made fences,
boundary riders and the "kelpie" feasible there too.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Sir W. Denison to Sir E. B. Lytton, 6 April
1859.]</p>
<p>But climatically the north was less suitable for sheep than
were the western plains of New South Wales. The excessive
evaporation in summer more quickly turned a season of light
rainfall into complete drought. Good "top-feed" might remain on
saltbush, gidgea, leopard-wood and mulga and in the dried
Mitchell grass, but the drying of the rivers and water-holes
meant sweeping losses of sheep. Cattle could travel farther to
water, and therefore, as the 'eighties opened, the northern
colony became the chief cattle area of. Australia. Deep bores
tapped artesian supplies in that decade and made sheep safe long
after the evaporation of surface-water. The increased carrying
capacity of paddocks thus watered, was marked by the growing
numbers of both sheep and cattle.**</p>

<p>Even with assured supplies of drinking water for man and
beast, Western Queensland remained a pastoral domain, but on the
Darling Downs round Toowoomba there was one debatable land over
the range where tillage and cereal crops were also practicable.
Just before and after the grant of self-government in 1859,
pastoralists and speculators had rushed to lease the favoured
areas, and had taken up twenty-five million acres. To sort out
operative from speculative squatters, the new legislature allowed
a fourteen years' lease only to those who proved their runs
stocked during the first year of occupation. But the same herd of
cattle might "prove" many runs to the satisfaction of the
Government inspector. Though he might know the herd by heart, how
could he "give away" such charming hosts? In any event,
cancellations of lease brought no new population, while squatting
remained "the only productive interest in the colony". Governor
Bowen and Premier R. G. W. Herbert, the two ex-secretaries to
William Ewart Gladstone who launched Queensland into responsible
government, set out to promote agriculture wherever it should
prove possible.</p>
<p>In addition to selection on easy terms after the survey of
chosen areas they made lavish use of land orders to immigrants.
These would buy eighteen pounds' worth of country Crown land on
the immigrant's arrival, and another £12 worth two years
later. The legislators still planned farms on an English scale.
These orders might be issued to anyone who paid an immigrant's
passage. H. Jordan, an active agent sent to England in 1861,
found a firm of shipowners who were willing to bring out
immigrants by the thousand and to take payment in land orders.
Darling Downs pastoralists saw their chance and stood ready to
buy such orders in any quantity. The plan suited everybody. It
relieved the Government of direct cost in financing immigration.
It gave the new colonist, if he had paid his fare, most of his
money back on arrival. But few tried cultivating their blocks
immediately they landed. Even earlier than in New South Wales the
financial strength of the wool-growers exploited the legislators'
wish to see little farms on the inland downs. Land orders helped
them to build up freehold stations with surveyors' agricultural
blocks.</p>
<p>For a few years this went unnoticed. Parliament and ministers
were engaged in buying and "trying on" the outfit of separate
existence&mdash;the task Governor Macquarie and Governor Gawler
had found so absorbing&mdash;a task, indeed, which, since the
Tower of Babel, has again and again drawn rulers, on into
exhilaration and folly and their subjects into discord and
remorse. They were building, in haste and on credit, the
nineteenth century equivalent of city walls. Self-government
brought freedom to start a "national debt", and the energetic
Herbert set himself to replace the primitive bullock tracks of
the squatters by the macadamized roads, railways and public
buildings of a civilized community. He easily obtained from
London investors loans of £123,000 in 1862, of
£707,000 in 1863, and of £1,019,000 in 1864. He spent
them almost as rapidly. Immigrants came in shoals, adding 52,855
newcomers to the population between 1861 and the end of 1865.
High wages were waiting for all able-bodied men as navvies on the
railways, roads and bridges.</p>
<p>About the middle of 1865, however, the Union Bank, as the
Government's financial agents, received word that the colony's
debentures had become a drug on the London market. It was only a
temporary phase, men said. The bank continued to advance money on
the security of the unsold debentures, at the usual ten per cent.
discount. But the cold fit in London persisted. For some decades
British investors had been losing capital in States of the
American Union now prostrate in defeat, in South American
republics and in Spain, Egypt and Turkey. They recognized the
fever of over-borrowing.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Leland Jenks, <i>The Migration of British
Capital to</i> 1875 (1927), <i>passim</i>.]</p>
<p>The inexperienced ministers at Brisbane plunged on. Herbert,
intending to return to Oxford, had handed the reins to Arthur
Macalister, his Minister for Lands and Works, but in May 1866 he
drew his successor's attention to the need of a new loan to
replenish the Treasury. Within a week an Act authorizing an issue
of £1,170,000 debentures had passed both houses and
received the vice-regal assent. The Union Bank demurred at
further advances, but the Sydney agents for the Agra and
Masterman's Bank accepted the business of discounting and placing
the new debentures. Early in July, however, word came that the
Agra and Masterman's Bank had failed, and that Peto, Brassey and
Betts, who were engaged on large railway contracts in the colony,
were in difficulties. It was the Overend Gurney smash in London.
Chaos and unemployment fell upon the colony in a day. Without a
word of warning the Union Bank refused to cash the Government
cheques. Macalister proposed an issue of inconvertible
legal-tender notes and short-dated Treasury bills. Sir George
Bowen made public announcement that he must refuse his vice-regal
assent to any such expedient. Macalister resigned. Herbert,
resuming charge as minister without portfolio, rushed a bill
through Parliament for an issue of £300,000 in ten per
cent. Treasury bonds for two years. He was assaulted in the
streets by a mob resentful of the Governor's high hand, and
resigned after eighteen days, undefeated himself but discredited
by the defeat at a ministerial by-election of his intended
successor, Attorney-General Pring. The Bank of Queensland failed.
Bankruptcy spread wide among companies and pastoralists. A
coalition under Macalister, despite Governor Bowen's resistance,
introduced an issue of Treasury notes, though on a small scale.
August brought an ugly situation when hundreds of immigrants
swelled the workless mobs. Railway navvies thrown out of work at
Helidon and Ipswich marched on Brisbane to exact relief. Their
first attempt was stopped, but another in September threw
Brisbane into panic. Police and unemployed clashed in the
streets. Relief works absorbed some, but hundreds left the colony
and depression was universal.</p>
<p>Then in September 1867 James Nash found gold at Gympie in Wide
Bay District. Diggers threw up selections and wages jobs in the
south and poured thither. A liberal Land Act was framed (1868) to
meet the difficulties shown up by Herbert's Acts and to retain
the diggers as settlers. It offered large areas, up to 7680 acres
of second class land, to grazing farmers who were to cultivate as
well as to stock their holdings. This <i>via media</i>, though
long quoted in the southern colonies as a statesmanlike
reconciliation of interests, brought the usual dummying. The land
was found by giving pastoralists ten years' extension of lease
and substantial pre-emptive rights in return for the surrender of
half their holdings. By 1874 some 9000 selections had been made
and 3,000,000 acres alienated, but half of these had been
obtained by 267 persons of whom all but 90 were squatters'
agents. They had surrendered leaseholds to buy them back as
freehold. There was considerable selection of grazing farms,
especially in the Lower Burnett and Wide Bay Districts. Up on the
Darling Downs, a liberal Douglas Ministry tried free selection
when the pastoral leases expired in 1878. The new Act (1876)
distinguished between (i) conditional purchasers or grazing
farmers who could buy from 640 to 2560 acres at auction at an
upset price of 10<i>s</i>. an acre, and (ii) agricultural
homesteaders who could get their 80 to 160 acres at half-a-crown
an acre. But bad seasons intervened. Stations were resumed for
selection but while the drought lasted no one would buy. Railways
and better seasons brought some settlers along the lines.
Brisbane and Toowoomba were joined by rail in 1875, and this made
the sale of farm produce more profitable. By 1884, however, it
was clear that on the inland downs alienation had far outrun the
spread of cultivation.</p>
<p>The coastal strip, a thousand miles long, is another country.
The S.E. trade winds bring rain to it off the Pacific in any
month of the year, usually in abundance. At its extreme southern
end is the seat of government, and on the frequent patches of
rich alluvial soil thereabouts men soon found that sugar-cane
grew well. Thomas Scott had "tried it out" on a commercial scale
at Port Macquarie in New South Wales as long ago as 1823, but
damage by frost sent its later advocates to the Northern Rivers
and Moreton Bay. In 1843, James Backhouse, a missionary, found it
growing as hedges between the beds in the "Commandant's Garden"
near Government House, Brisbane. In 1856, John Dunmore Lang,
always an eager advocate of the production of cotton and sugar by
European labour, rode out from Grafton to a creek on the Clarence
River he saw 350 acres under cane, grown by a settler from
Mauritius, M. Adam. He thought it very superior, yielding four
tons of sugar to the acre. In July 1862 a correspondent of Lang's
at Moreton Bay waxed enthusiastic over plots in the Botanic
Gardens and told of "sets" of cane distributed to cultivators in
all parts of the colony John Buhot had already made sugar on a
commercial scale at Brisbane. Among the pioneer planters was the
Hon. Louis Hope, a cadet of the Hopetoun family. In 1862 he left
a sheep station at Kilcoy on the Upper Brisbane to grow sugar
near Cleveland. With infinite labour he cleared, enclosed, broke
up and cultivated twenty acres of forest and scrub. Having
planted, trimmed, cut and carried the cane, he watched its
crushing in a mill of his own erection. Next he set up boiling
vats, and finally he had to turn merchant and sell his own wares.
To keep down labour costs when wages were at boom levels owing to
railway construction, he employed in 1864 some Kanakas brought by
Captain Towns to cultivate and pick cotton in the same district.
The Queensland Parliament marked the significance of his success
by voting him its thanks in 1867, and making him a grant of land.
Within two years over 5000 acres were under cane. In 1872-3 some
65 mills turned out 6266 tons of sugar and 161,473 gallons of
rum. The colony's own needs were already met and an export trade
to the value of £36,803 provided the moist brown sugar that
remained familiar in station rations until the 'nineties. Here
was the main chance for settlers on the steamy coastal
rivers&mdash;an export industry with an almost unlimited
market.</p>
<p>Clearing was expensive, but soil and climate were so
favourable that crops could be won from only half-cleared land.
The heavy work was done in May, June and July&mdash;the winter,
months&mdash;"when we usually have very fair working weather as
regards heat". After the biggest trees were felled and burnt up
at a cost of £10 an acre, forest land was ready for a heavy
plough and a bullock-team. To clear scrub land and remove the
stumps would have cost £40 an acre. So a variant of
"Mullenizing" * was practised. The scrub was cut and burned at a
cost of about £4 an acre, and cane sets were planted among
the charred stumps in holes made by hand with a hoe. After five
ratoon crops from this planting and after the stumps had rotted,
the land was ploughed for the first time. Putting white labour to
work the mills and vats, and Polynesians to do the hoeing,
cutting and other drudgery, the sugar-planters counted on
averaging out wages at four shillings a day. They planned to
compete with other sugar colonies owing to "our having millions
of acres of background whereon can be raised horses, cattle,
corn, beef, mutton and all plantation necessaries at the cheapest
rate, without importing, as is generally necessary in other
places at a very exorbitant price".</p>
<p class="foot">[* See chapter <small>XIII</small>,
<i>supra</i>.]</p>
<p>Had it been left to the pastoralists and planters, the two
Queenslands would have made black labour the instrument in this
mutual service. As sugar boomed, more and more Kanakas were drawn
in for the plantation gangs. Moreover, the fount and origin of
the squatters' demand for separation from New South Wales had
been their intention to obtain convict labour again; and, when
Southern opposition barred the way, the leaders in the new
colony had looked about as a matter of course for other supplies
of cheap service on the stations. Quests for Chinese and Indian
coolies broke down under the pressure of Imperial and Indian
officials for proper regulation. In the 'forties, Benjamin Boyd,
a cool scamp, who sought to found a rival to Sydney on Twofold
Bay in Southern New South Wales, had brought in Polynesians to
act as shepherds on the Riverina stations. But the British
authorities had objected to forced recruiting, and Boyd's
shepherds died of the climate and homesickness. In 1863 Captain
Robert Towns brought over 67 more of these islanders in the 'Don.
Juan' to work his Moreton Bay cotton fields. When cotton-planting
came to nothing as the American War of Secession died down, Hope
used them in his sugar-plantations and thereby added an expansive
demand for rough cultivators and cane-cutters to the standing
pastoral demand for station hands. The colonies were now
self-governing and British opinion was wary of fresh
responsibilities in the Pacific. "Black-birding" rapidly rose to
considerable proportions. 1237 islanders were brought over in
1867, and 900 more during the first four months of 1868. By this
time there were 700 Kanakas in station employment.</p>
<p>A cry for regulation of what looked very like a revival of
both slave-trading and slavery arose both within and without the
colony's boundaries. The self-respect that the young nation had
been taught by British humanitarians in the movement to abolish
transportation of criminals revolted afresh against forced
recruiting of men of other and alien stocks. Democrats feared the
presence of a race which they held incapable of an equal
franchise. The wage-earners to a man drew together to resist the
menace of cheap and unfree labour.* As early as 1868 the
Queensland Parliament made a law to regulate recruiting in the
islands and the treatment of Kanakas on board ship, but its
ability to enforce the law was negligible. The Admiralty had
predicted as much. "Whatever regulations may be made for the
liberty and well-being of these people, or their being brought
nominally within the laws and tribunals of Queensland, no proper
and efficient control can ever be exercised over the manner in
which these people are obtained and placed on board ship."
Recruiting was going on for island plantations and South America
as well as for Queensland. It was likely "from the nature of the
work to fall into the hands of an unscrupulous and mercenary set
who, under pretence of persuading natives to make engagements as
labourers for a term of years, would not hesitate to commit acts
of piracy, kidnapping and murder" ** A Polynesian Protection Act
was passed by the British Parliament in 1872 and a High
Commissioner of the Western Pacific was appointed in 1875. These
measures strengthened the Navy's hands, but, so long as Britain
refused to annex the islands, foreigners defied both Navy and
High Commissioner. Kidnapping, massacre and reprisals continued.
When various powers had annexed the Pacific Islands east of
Australia, the labour vessels, hailing not from Queensland ports
only, betook them to New Britain and New Ireland in 1882, and in
1884 to New Guinea. The German Foreign Office bluntly called
British attention to their misdeeds and asked British aid "to
prevent any transgression at the limit which divides the lawful
traffic of Polynesians from slave-trading". A Liberal government
in Queensland, under Samuel Griffith, thereupon amended the
Polynesian Labour Act with the aim of ending the traffic
altogether in 1890.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Myra Willard, <i>History of the White
Australia Policy</i>, p. 161: "The labouring classes hated the
Kanaka brother whom they saw with as much zeal and heartiness as
the philanthropists in England loved the dusky Islander whom they
had not seen".]</p>
<p class="foot">[** M. Willard, <i>op. cit</i>. p. 144: "Whoever
else has reason to be ashamed of the part they played in the
Pacific Island traffic at least the naval authorities have
nothing to regret".]</p>
<p>In the conflict of opinion within the colony, liberal and
selfish motives, political and economic ambitions, crossed and
criss-crossed. Between 46,000 and 47,000 Kanakas were brought
into the country. So long as they were employed on stations,
about the towns and on casual work&mdash;mostly contrary to their
"agreements"&mdash;they died like flies, at nearly five times the
rate for Europeans of similar ages. Under the liberal laws and
regulations in force after 1888 they were legally employable only
on tropical agriculture and there was an appreciable decline in
the mortality. It was not that the sugar-planters were more
humane than squatters and others, but that the Kanakas on the
plantations could be more readily-watched, and their masters more
easily charged with hospital expenses. At best, however, the
mortality among Kanakas remained four times as heavy as that
among the white colonists. In 1893 it was 52.57 per thousand when
that of European men, women and children was only 13.3. Forced to
rough pioneering work to which they were unused and in which they
felt no joy or personal interest, despised and cursed by the
average colonist, they were in fact, if not at law,
chattel-slaves.</p>
<p>With such "hands" the sugar-planters worked northward from one
fertile pocket of land to another. In the early 'seventies they
were booming the Mary River. Farther north at Mackay, John
Spiller, after studying the industry in Java, tested twenty acres
in 1865. He succeeded so well that many others followed him
thither. Planting sugar-cane was to all appearance a form of
agriculture exempt from such irksome tasks as the annual
ploughing and sowing. Shoved into holes in the untilled surface
of half-cleared land, the favourite "Bourbon" variety grew large
and succulent canes that seemed immune from disease. Small owners
planted it up to their cottage walls, and neglected weeding and
"trashing" when new areas could be turned to profit so easily.
Large mill-owning planters plunged into debt to extend their
machinery. Any one who had ever lived on a sugar plantation
elsewhere was <i>ipso facto</i> an expert, to be put in charge of such
construction.</p>
<p>The dream was too rosy to last. On the Brisbane and the Mary
in 1873 and around Mackay with greater virulence in 1874, there
appeared, in a night, a "fire-blight" or rust at first attributed
to frost. The Bourbon cane looked as if it had been burnt. All
were heavy losers save a few who had tried "Black Java", a
quick-maturing smaller cane, which proved immune. This grew in
one season, as against two for Bourbon, and the warmer north
matured it better than the southern river-valleys. So the
disaster pushed the industry farther north, and, as it was then
believed that whites could not work in the tropical sun,* its
dependence on the Kanakas was increased.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Miss Flora Shaw wrote in 1893 of the
difference between a Javanese or black man and a European working
in the tropical sun as "the difference between a humming bird and
a sick sparrow".]</p>
<p>Mackay boomed once more Those who had won through the crisis
had learned their business under Queensland conditions. By 1877-8
there were 15,220 acres under sugar-cane, the yield had recovered
to more than its pre-blight level (12,000 tons of sugar), and
196,662 gallons of rum were made from the residues. The sugar
exported reached a value of £286,222 in 1880, partly
through a temporary rise in price. So eager became the rush of
selectors for "homesteads" in the sugar areas, under the Douglas
Land Act of 1876, that the McIlwraith government suspended
homestead selection at half-a-crown an acre, and re-classified
the land. Even at trebled prices and more, 240,000 acres of sugar
land were sold between October 1881 and March 1882, and sales
continued. Many bought to sell at future prices rather than to
grow sugar, for the area under cane only rose from 20,000 acres
in 1880-1 to 48,000 in 1883-4. Once more, established wealth
seized upon openings meant by the lawgivers for new men. As the
lands filled from which cane might be carried by water to the
crushing mill, tramways came into vogue and empty land held by
speculators meant longer tramways and dearer hauls.</p>
<p>The high price of sugar in 1880 did not hold. The period from
1860 to 1900 was marked, as a whole, by a persistent fall that
was due to the competition of beet-sugar, stimulated by bounties
in Continental Europe.** Yet, through three phases in which
differing expedients were found to answer, the Queensland
industry steadily grew, with but little tariff advantage in its
southern market. In bringing under cultivation extremely fertile
though limited areas the planters used&mdash;and used up&mdash;a
supply of cheap and servile labour. In meeting European
competition the industry, with government aid, learned economy in
crushing its cane by central mills. In replacing brown and
"mill-white" sugar by the best refined grade it was most
competently served by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.</p>

<p>So long as Queensland was a separate colony the planters
fought with success to retain their coloured labour. Their fight
compels the admiration few can withhold from a minority resolute
to the end, but Australian opinion was heavily and increasingly
adverse. They forged, in the North Queensland Separation
Movement, a weapon which (like the Confederate States of
Jefferson Davis) gave their purpose the guise of a crusade for
self-determination. When the popular hatred of Kanaka labour sent
to Brisbane parliamentary majorities pledged to put down slavery
and slave-trading, the North cried aloud for local autonomy,
exposed every electoral and public works scandal, and reasoned at
Westminster that the Crown should set up a new colony or colonies
north of Dawes Range or the tropic. But when friends trod the
stage at Brisbane and islanders might be had more easily, the hot
fit passed and constitution-making was forgotten like a tropical
fever.</p>
<p>On geographical and financial grounds they had as good a case
for local autonomy as ever colonists had; indeed, after the
'seventies they had a better case than the Darling Downs and
Moreton Bay had made good in the 'fifties.* When separated from
New South Wales the infant Queensland had boasted only 28,000
white colonists. By 1871 those north of Dawes Range already
numbered 27,000, and the gold and silver found inland as well as
the sugar-planting that spread steadily up the coast gave every
promise of further rapid growth. The very prosperity of the North
debarred its active participants from making their voices
effective in Brisbane. How could the planter busy with his crop
and with the development of his estate, the miner battling for
gold over the rough coastal range and the inland pastoralist on
guard against natives and drought neglect their work to attend
long sessions in a capital far away in the south-east? **
Brisbane is nearer to Sydney than to Bowen, nearer to Melbourne
than to Cooktown. Kennedy, a northern constituency, elected John
Bright in a conventional gesture of despair. But whether they
attended or no, the Northern representatives were powerless to
prevent a Southern majority from pledging the revenues to pay for
loans and public works that developed the South alone.</p>

<p class="foot">[** A brilliant Australian journalist, A. G.
Stephens, who had lived in the North, asked in 1833: "What would
you think of a man who told you the circulation of the blood
would be more perfect if the heart were placed in the big toe?. .
. The result would probably be to make us crippled, blind, deaf,
dumb and idiotic. Long before that, however, we would be
exterminated by some race of men whose hearts were normally
situated". <i>Why North Queensland Wants Separation</i>
(Melbourne Public Library, <i>Pol. Econ. Pamphlets</i>).]</p>
<p>The Colonial Office had beyond doubt contemplated further
divisions of the Northern mass when Queensland was severed from
her mother colony. Dr J. D. Lang, its protagonist in Sydney, had
more than once mapped out and named the future northern colonies.
The Imperial Parliament had by statute made explicit the Crown's
power to proclaim them. In the name of self-government, justice
and clean administration, the planters, when the occasion called
for their eloquence, claimed for their chosen domain the logical,
legal and honourable gift of freedom.</p>
<p>Both at Brisbane and Westminster ministers found that all they
could attempt against such tempestuous bowling was to play out
time. In 1872 the Earl of Kimberley asked for a full discussion
in the colonial parliament and an expression of policy from
ministers possessing its confidence. Without these Her Majesty's
Government could not "entertain a question of such paramount
importance". This was a rebuff. A worse setback was the
acceptance in that year of a policy of Imperial supervision of
the recruiting of islanders. For a decade Separation had to wait.
The planters were on the defensive In 1883 Samuel Griffith,
having fought and won an election on the issue of Indian and
Kanaka labour, enacted stricter regulations limiting the
employment of Kanakas to tropical and semitropical agriculture.
The aliens should at least be confined to the tasks for which
they were ostensibly indentured and, as was alleged, were
uniquely suited. What was more, Griffith enforced his regulations
and made the importation of more Kanakas illegal after 1890.
Immediately the separation movement revived both in the North and
in Britain.</p>
<p>The petitioners contended that the Earl of Kimberley's
stipulations had been fulfilled. Expressions of policy had
certainly been forthcoming from the Premier of the colony, though
they were emphatically against separation, and a discussion in
the Brisbane Parliament had ended in the defeat of a motion
favouring separation by 36 votes to 9, the Southern members
voting with one voice against it. But such opposition, contended
the Northern leaders, made good their case for liberation from
such rulers. A new Secretary of State (H. T. Holland) sought
fresh ground on which to set aside the new petitions. With much,
effect the Northern colonists quoted an Imperial statute passed
two years after the separation of Queensland from New South
Wales, giving the Crown authority to change the boundaries of
colonies "established or to be established". They cited, too, an
explanation of that Act by the Duke of Newcastle to the first
Governor of Queensland. "I am not prepared to abandon definitely,
on the part of Her Majesty's Government, the power to deal with
districts not yet settled as the wishes and convenience of future
settlers may require." But the Colonial Office unearthed another
condition precedent. The Secretary of State announced to the
House of Commons (1887) that the Law officers advised that no
step could be taken by the Crown without fresh legislation. Such
legislation would be proposed only after some resolution in
favour of the change had been carried in the colonial
legislature.</p>
<p>This was a hard ruling. If the concurrence of a majority in
the New South Wales legislature had been required in 1859, it
would certainly have meant the strangling of Queensland at birth.
Such a rule meant the cessation in Australia of that internal
colonization, under the name of territorial organization, which
had created self-governing frontier-communities across the North
American continent. There were, no doubt, powerful forces in
alliance in 1887 to frame and applaud such a ruling. The
petitioners had been tactful enough to scout the bare idea that
their Separation League was a Home Rule movement. Nobody could be
more fervently loyal than they. Yet if local autonomy had been
granted in Queensland, what torrents of awkward questions about
Ireland would have poured upon the Unionist ministers of 1887!
Moreover, separation would cut in two not only the map of
Queensland but also the taxing-power on the future growth of
which London investors had counted when they had taken up
Queensland bonds to the amount of sixteen millions between 1859
and 1885.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The analogy between the North Queensland
movement and the formation of new states in the American Union
would not reassure the City. Cf. W. E. Adcock on "The Separation
Movement in the North", <i>Victorian Review</i>, February
1885.]</p>
<p>Thought for bondholders' interest in the undiminished
taxing-power of the government responsible for the service of the
debt may already be traced in 1887. In the replies made to the
separationists thereafter it was put more and more plainly. Yet
the planters would not admit defeat, though they knew that their
arch-enemy ** had stated the case against them in terms that
carried full weight with the Colonial Office. Westminster might
be unfriendly for the nonce. They were not dismayed. The party
that normally countenanced coloured labour as a means of
extending the industry might acquiesce in Griffith's amending act
giving notice of the cessation of all "black-birding" and
importation of Kanakas after 1890. Such turns and twists of the
political weathercocks did not shake the planters' faith in a
course they thought to be dictated by the facts of soil and
climate. The flag of secession still flew high in the North.
Griffith's dream of "preserving Queensland as a future field for
European settlement" would fade as light dawned even on that
restless mind. Governor Musgrave, though he commended to his
official superiors at Westminster Griffith's "clear, temperate
and able exposition of the views of the ministry", could not
share his opinion that sugar-cane would eventually be cultivated
successfully in the tropics by white labour.***</p>
<p class="foot">[** At their social gatherings in North
Queensland it was customary to drink to the toast of D.S.G.,
i.e. "D&mdash;&mdash;n Sam Griffith". "Sugar", as <i>The
Times</i> remarked 12 October 1885, "does not sweeten the temper
of its growers."]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Sir A. Musgrave to the Secretary of State
for the Colonies, 23 April 1885, covering a statement by the
Premier to the Governor, 1 April 1885&mdash;an admirable state
paper.]</p>
<p>Griffith waved aside all doubts. "The same thing used to be
said of Moreton Bay. . . . It was not to be thought that
Europeans would work on the plantations on the same conditions as
coloured races." They would, he contended, cultivate it under
different conditions, as a large population of resident owners
working their own properties, unless that result were prevented
by the introduction of inferior races in large numbers. Rather
than the colony of the planters' dreams, with a government,
representing employers for the most part absentees, exploiting an
inferior race or races, he would prefer "a separate territory
governed as a Crown Colony" by an impartial civil service. But
the coastal strips where tropical agriculture was possible were
few and not continuous. The mineral lands in the ranges and the
pastoral lands on the plateaux by reason of their high elevation
differed in no important particular from the rest of the pastoral
lands of Australia. The present ascendancy of the planters at
Mackay was not valid ground for entrusting them with the future
of such wide territories.</p>
<p>Popular opinion in Queensland and in the Southern colonies
applauded, even though they did not fully comprehend, the vision
of this lean, impatient idealist.* He saw in the North the field
for an experiment in European settlement unimpeded by any attempt
to unite races of wholly different culture in a constitutional
colony. Like every great-hearted Australian, he rated high the
opportunity of constructive progress unembittered by racial
feuds. And from an unexpected quarter there came means to further
the experiment he desired that carried it to within sight of full
success.</p>
<p class="foot">[* C. A. Bernays, <i>Queensland Politics during
Sixty Years</i>, p. 73, draws a pen portrait of Griffith, justly
emphasizing "a strange trait in his character that he never
entirely pleased himself".]</p>
<p>Planters like Hope of Cleveland who crushed and made sugar
from their own cane were puzzled, impoverished and held back by
agricultural, chemical and engineering difficulties beyond their
training. To accept the advice of <i>soi-disant</i> experts was
to incur capital costs which the output did not justify on the
falling market in which their sugar had to be sold. Only the
finest calculation, the best engineering and chemical skill,
extracting the last pound of sugar and turning out the most
attractive quality, could make headway against the technical
energy and state aid behind the best sugar of Continental Europe.
The necessary capacities could be trained, however, by separating
the tasks of growing, crushing and refining.</p>
<p>Angus Mackay, a Sydney engineer sent by Queensland in the
early 'eighties to investigate cane-sugar production in the
French, British and Spanish West Indies, reported immense
advances in the French islands and decline elsewhere. This he
ascribed to the Central Factory system, which had separated
cane-farming from sugar-manufacture, making them even more
distinct than wheat-growing and flour-milling. Powerful machinery
and boiling <i>in vacuo</i>, economically feasible only on a
large scale, enabled the genuine central mill to give the grower
more for his cane than he could win from it himself with obsolete
plant.** The system had already been put into operation by the
Colonial Sugar Refining Company on the Clarence and Richmond
Rivers of Northern New South Wales. There the company bought from
the growers the standing cane at from ten to fourteen shillings a
ton, cut it by gangs of its own employing, brought it in large
shallow-draught droghers to its mills and there crushed and
boiled it. Final manufacture took place at the company's refinery
at Pyrmont, Sydney.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Angus Mackay, <i>Sugar Cane in Australia</i>,
1883, pp. 136 <i>et passim</i>.]</p>
<p>Mackay predicted the rapid extension in Australia of this
plan&mdash;"one of the most certain solutions of the labour
difficulties which beset sugar production all over the world".
The main desideratum would be skill capable of supervising in the
mills and the refinery powerful machinery and subtle processes.
Good machines and good management in the field and the boiling
houses would extract sugar at falling cost as experience
increased. The colour of the labour tending the cane would become
a matter of taste.</p>
<p>So, in the ripeness of time, it may happen. But Griffith, true
to the idealists' trade of being disappointed, wished to speed up
the slow crawl of events. He clutched at the central mill as an
expedient to force the transition to white labour in sugar
production. In 1885 unemployment in Queensland had been
aggravated by assisted immigration. He induced Parliament to vote
£50,000 to build or subsidize cane-growers' companies in
building central mills. The cane brought to them, he stipulated,
must be grown by white labour alone. Plantations were already
being cut up into small farms and Griffith meant the new mills to
make sugar for these small-holders. But they proved unready as
yet to grow cane by white labour only as some of the farmers on
the northern rivers of New South Wales were doing. At the mills
erected in the Mackay and Port Douglas districts the rule against
"black" cane could not be maintained. While Kanakas remained, the
whites would not work with them in the cane brakes, though they
willingly took work in the mills from which Kanakas were
habitually shut out.</p>
<p>Yet the change-over made progress. Though they had shown the
way on the northern rivers, the directors of the "C.S.R." were
still arguing as late as 1890 that sugar planting in the tropics
could not do without coloured labour; but in the very next year
the company was selling its North Queensland plantations on easy
terms to farmers, as "a partial solution of the labour
difficulty". The gentleman-planter who had owned broad estates
and worked them through an overseer by Kanaka gangs, who had
crushed and, as far as he knew how, had refined his own sugar in
a plantation mill, was losing his economic ascendancy. The small
farmers into whose hands such estates were divided employed
perhaps a Kanaka or two each, but no Kanaka might own land. Now
that the rough pioneering of the industry&mdash;the clearing and
planting&mdash;had been done, coloured labour had become an
anachronism and a clog. The hardest-headed Australian trust had
reorganized the work among small farmers growing the cane,
seasonal white labour cutting it and machine-fitters, tenders and
chemists manufacturing the sugar.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The Colonial Sugar Refining Company took over
in 1855 the refining business of a predecessor, the Australasian
Sugar Company, which was established in Sydney in 1842 with an
initial capacity of a thousand tons a year. The original
shareholders of the C.S.R. Co. were J. H. Challis, James Robey,
Edward Knox, Walter Lamb, Alfred Spry, Daniel Cooper, William
Fanning, T. J. Nankivell, William Walker, Archibald Walker and
Edwin Tooth, and its capital was £75,000. From 1855 to 1887
the liability of the shareholders was unlimited&mdash;at
law&mdash;and accounts were, not published. The ordinary shares
of the limited liability company registered in 1887 were "paid
up" to the value of £600,000. Amalgamation with the New
Zealand Sugar Company was sanctioned at the first ordinary
meeting of the new company. The volume of Reports and Speeches,
C.S.R. Co. 1855-1912 in the Mitchell Library is a most impressive
record of the company's success and power to mould political
action. See especially the Chairman's speeches for the half years
ending 30 September 1889, 31st March 1890, 31st March 1892, 30th
September 1894 (the acquisition of the Australasian Sugar
Refining Co. of Melbourne&mdash;Poolmans'), 31 March 1895
(reflections on the effects of the company's production
out-growing the needs of the Australasian markets), 31 March 1899
(Parliament has agreed to continuance of duty of £3 per ton
on sugar imported into New South Wales).]</p>
<p>Political separation for North Queensland in the 'seventies or
'eighties would have set up the type of colony which had an
unhappy record in the West Indies&mdash;an aristocracy of white
planters deriving wealth and ascendancy from the exploitation of
semi-servile labour. Though the planters refused to admit
political defeat in 1887, the small farmers and the skilled
employees in the mills and refineries were cutting away the
economic basis of their leadership, and in the 'nineties the
Northern Separation Movement collapsed in its hour of seeming
triumph.</p>
<p>About 1890 it had been reinforced and supplemented by a demand
from the Rockhampton district for a third colony of Central
Queensland, and in this demand the pastoralists of the West,
notably those about Winton and Boulia, played a part. They
petitioned in 1887 and again three years later, when the hour for
the exclusion of black labour was striking, that in the event of
separation they should be placed in the severed area. Sir Samuel
Griffith, now in coalition with hit old antagonist Sir Thomas
McIlwraith,** sought to turn the flank of this massed attack by a
plan for a federal Queensland. United Provinces, either two or
three in number, should enjoy local autonomy under a central
legislature. On the formation of an Australian Commonwealth this
central legislature would merge into that of the nation. First
framed in 1890 as a means of side-tracking separatist motions in
the Brisbane Parliament, Griffith's new plan was dropped because
no one but its author was interested enough to comprehend such
complexities. In 1891 it came up again as a counter to the draft
bill in which at Lord Knutsford's invitation the Central
Separation Committee set out to demonstrate the consistency of
its ambitions with the security of the public creditors of
Queensland.*** The Griffith plan was defeated, however, in
committee of the Brisbane Assembly.</p>
<p class="foot">[** "A big portly frame with a bulldog head and
neck, McIlwraith in his day filled a niche in Queensland politics
which no one else could fill, but perhaps it was as well that a
brake was put upon him just as he was getting into his stride. He
should have lived in the United States of America." C. A.
Bernays, <i>op. cit</i>. p. 56.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Griffith's Constitution of the United
Provinces of Queensland would have done this by leaving a reserve
taxing power, untrammelled by any limitation in the General
Assembly. Here again its influence on Australian political
development has been great.]</p>
<p>Still the Colonial Office held the ardent separationists at
arm's length. Sugar was tumbling in value, and cheap labour, the
separationists urged, was their one way to prosperity in their
competition with the bounty-fed product of Europe. Sir Samuel
Griffith's proposals for local autonomy while preserving the
union, said Westminster, had not yet been fully considered. If
the bill were defeated a second time, the occasion would then
have arrived for Her Majesty's Government to consider whether
Imperial legislation was necessary to cut the knot. Griffith
fought on, fertile of expedient after expedient to avoid complete
separation and the irretrievable breach between tropical and
temperate colonies which he knew it would involve. He was not
helped by the strikes and guerilla warfare on the stations in
which his former working-class allies were engaged. He admitted
that good government of the North was not practicable from
Brisbane and conceded the case for local control of expenditure.
Three united provinces would be best, he advised, but he drafted
alternative bills for three or two.</p>
<p>The Assembly preferred two, and in that form sent up the bill
to the Legislative Council. There it was rejected on the ground
that it had not been passed by the two-thirds majority in the
Assembly which constitutional amendments required. Griffith's
last guard seemed beaten down when, on the top of that defeat, he
had to admit in March 1892 that Kanakas were still needed to
bridge the gap of time until estates had been sub-divided and the
North peopled with white farmers. The coalition government, to
relieve the paralysis of the sugar industry by falling prices and
the refusal of white labour to cut cane at low wages, conceded a
temporary renewal (no set term being stated) of the Polynesian
Labour Regulation Act. Griffith's warmest admirers shook their
heads. What malign influence, they asked, had made so great a man
recant his ideal after spending the best years of his life in
cleansing an Augean stable?</p>
<p>The planters made haste. The rough force of facts and prices
had tripped up their enemy. In February 1893, full of high hope,
they put their overwhelming case to a new Liberal Secretary of
State, the Marquis of Ripon. Griffith's last expedient, the
Decentralization Bill, had been rejected after full discussion.
As they had predicted, the South still refused to listen to
reason. They had fulfilled every condition precedent. But still
Westminster would not move. A general election was impending in
Queensland. It would be improper not to await the result.</p>
<p>That election brought forth a puzzling situation. The new
political labour party, representing the miners, station hands
and wages men of the coastal towns hitherto opposed to northern
separation, polled so strongly in the North that they grew
confident of winning power in a separated parliament. Such
sinister support of the old cause, financial chaos, coastal
floods, and inland drought confused and divided the planters'
counsels. Desperately anxious to avoid any obligation to these
new allies, they approached still another Secretary of State for
the Colonies late in 1893. The reply they received from Joseph
Chamberlain proved cold comfort to men all too well aware how
southern Australians viewed their peculiar institution. "The
people of Central Queensland will no doubt find the Federal
Government, when constituted, ready to listen to any reasonable
scheme which may be submitted to it with the object of giving
them that independent control of their own affairs which they now
seek." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* J. Chamberlain to the Governor of Queensland,
15 January 1896.]</p>
<p>Abandoning hope of aid or action from Whitehall, the planters
gathered all possible allies for a last sally in the Brisbane
parliament; and by the casting vote of one of their leaders in
the Speaker's Chair they carried the day. The Assembly resolved
that the time had arrived when the Central and Northern divisions
of the colony should be constituted separate colonies in
compliance with the petitions of the inhabitants thereof (4
November 1897). Yet the separation was not made. The time had not
arrived. Sir Samuel Griffith, though now as Chief Justice "above
the thunder", was still too much for them. He pointed out to
Dickson, the Queensland Premier of 1898, that federation offered
a way of escape. With federation the White Australia policy was
sure of overwhelming and nation-wide support. That November
resolution made certain not Separation, but Queensland's tardy
entry into the work of founding the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Such was the last contest in Australia between a landed
aristocracy and the industrial democracy, the leaders of the past
and the clamour of the future. It compares strangely with the war
of secession in the American Union. The warning roar of that
conflagration awakened Australians in good time to the menace of
a servile under-race. By legislation they barred its growth. But
unluckily, their timely determination to check the establishment
of planter communities in the Australian tropics became entangled
in a resistance to any devolution of effective governing powers
by the colonies of 1863. The North Queensland planters and their
allies associated the cause of internal colonization with
coloured labour for long enough to damn both together. The
Colonial Office refused to use the Crown's power to proclaim
fresh colonies save at the request of the colony to be
sub-divided. This was an insuperable veto. Embodied in the
Commonwealth Constitution it still prevents in the self-governing
states of Australia any alteration of the haphazard boundaries
drawn before 1863. In one instance the discrepancy between the
political and the economic boundaries of the regions served by
the existing ports is so great that the railways of one state
penetrate deeply into the hinterland of another. The makeshift is
better than the customs barriers of pre-federal days, but it is
eloquent of an inability in Australian leaders, despite the
vaunted homogeneity and the remarkable social similarity of the
communities they govern, to adapt the map of the Continent to the
needs of the nation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV<br>
<br>
An Apostle of Restriction</h3>
<br>
<p><small>AT</small> the opening of the period of colonial
particularism (1860-1900), Victoria, thanks to her endowment of
alluvial gold, stood far above her neighbours in population and
prestige. For a generation she retained her lead and set the tone
of intercolonial relations. But her ways were ungenerous, like
those of an inept man defending a fortune won by luck.</p>
<p>In 1860 the Australian population had grown to 1,145,585, of
whom 538,234 were in Victoria, 348,546 in New South Wales,
125,582 in South Australia, 89,821 in Tasmania, 28,056 in
Queensland and a handful of 15,346 marooned at the far-off Swan
River. With 6.1 persons to the square mile as against Tasmania's
3.4 and New South Wales' 1.1, the Victorian hive was still
attracting most of the newcomers, and its governors, uplifted
with pride, were loth to abandon the faith that this would
continue and that callings would be found for the ex-diggers, for
the rising generation and all new arrivals.* What did it matter
that the squatters bought out the selectors and elbowed
wheat-growing into the plains beyond the Divide? Unprecedented
progress had given the people an exhilarating sense of power.
They had done great things together and had the will to do them
again. Here, ready to a leader's hand, were the core and fibre of
nationalism, "that simplest of all ideals which has in its nature
no political affinities either with liberty on the one hand or
with tyranny on the other; it can be turned by some chance
current of events or by the cunning or clumsiness of statesmen to
run in any channel and to work any wheel".**</p>
<p class="foot">[* By 1870 the estimated population of Australia
was 1,647,756 of whom 723,925 were in Victoria, 497,992 in

Stuarts</i>, p. 117.]</p>
<p>The leader, or rather the driver, came in the shape of a
newspaper dictator. David Syme, a tall, square-shouldered,
thin-lipped, grey-eyed Scot of Scots had been brought up by an
austere father, a North Berwick dominie and a solitary Tory among
Whigs. Seemingly the old man had no "melting" left in him towards
the youngest, of a family of seven, five of whom were boys. "I
have no recollection", said David. Syme long afterwards, "of ever
having addressed him directly in my life, even to, the extent of
asking him a question. If the idea of doing so ever entered my
brain I never had the courage to carry it out. It had been firmly
impressed upon me that I had to do as I was told and ask no
questions." *** He impressed the same lesson on the public and
the Premiers of Victoria for over forty years. "Time after time",
records his pupil and biographer, "the people saw <i>The Age</i>
use political leaders and parties with the indifference of a
carpenter who flings his hammer carelessly aside after it has
driven in the nail. Syme only supported men as long as they were
whole-souled ministers of the principles he advocated." **** He
practised persuasion by a simple, effective method. "His first
step was to announce clearly and lucidly his ideas, and to couch
his announcement in a form that assumed, however startlingly
original his views, that he was merely expressing a settled
public opinion. There was no hurry, no flurry, no forcing, no
impatience. He was often greeted with an outburst of popular
derision. He ignored it, and when it was over he returned
placidly to the charge. The process often extended over years.
But gradually his ideas fertilized. Each reiteration made them a
little more definite, a little more familiar, a little more
acceptable. . . until at last his ideas with all their
consequences were publicly embraced." *****</p>

<p>Those ideas reflected the history and character of the man who
propagated them. Life had reiterated his father's lesson of
self-reliance. He had studied theology of an unorthodox hue under
Morison of Kilmarnock, had tasted at Heidelberg the Hegelian
dialectic of progress through contradiction, had learned
proof-reading and privation in Glasgow, gold-mining in California
and hostility to the squatter-rulers of Victoria when they evaded
his appeal to be reinstated on a "jumped" claim (which proved a
most successful one) at Mount Egerton. Socially he was a "thrawn
body", retiring to the point of being a recluse, but in thought
he was as adventurous and as contemptuous of convention as the
diggers were in action. With the zeal of an anchorite he summoned
them to make Victoria a "self-contained, self-supporting,
independent nation&mdash;a nice-balanced industrial community,
composite, stable and progressive".</p>
<p>In 1860, on the death of his brother Ebenezer, who had left
the staff of the Westminster Gazette to seek relief from phthisis
by emigration to Victoria, David Syme became both proprietor and
editor of the Melbourne Age, a struggling newspaper which he had
purchased for a small sum four years earlier to ensure its
continuance. He made it the mouthpiece of views of which he
thought himself the sole prophet * and in his advocacy of which
he no doubt pictured himself as a young David going forth to do
battle with a sling against the heavy-armed squatting and
mercantile interests.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Cf. Pratt, <i>op. cit</i>. p. 59: "I know of
no one in Australia who believed in Protection except myself".
But in this he was mistaken. T. A. Coghlan, Labour and Industry
in Australia, p. 1140, draws attention to the American and
artisan influences "latent in the minds of a large section of the
population" and to the formation of a Tariff League in 1859. A
pamphlet by G. W. Cole, M.L.C., <i>Protection as a National
System suited to Victoria</i>, published in Melbourne in 1860 and
consisting mainly of extracts from List, shows that German
thought was not without influence.]</p>
<p>From the first Australian tariff imposed by Governor King to
the days of colonial self-government British goods had enjoyed
preferential treatment in the Australian market. That was
fundamental in the old view and treatment of colonies as means to
the mother country's enrichment. From 1808 it took the form of a
general levy of 5 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on all goods not of
British manufacture. With small changes according to the needs of
revenue this tariff remained until the finding of gold and the
era of self-government. When New South Wales and Victoria were
separated there were specific duties on spirits and tobacco and
<i>ad valorem</i> duties on imports generally, 2 per cent. being levied
on goods from the United Kingdom and 10 per cent. on those of all
other countries. In the tariffs of pre-gold days, despite some
traces of protection to local industries such as distillation and
sugar refining, and an element of preference to British traders,
the dominant idea was undoubtedly to raise revenue by an
all-round impost easily collected at the ports.</p>
<p>The preference to goods from the United Kingdom was swept away
by the colonial legislatures in 1851. They needed revenue badly
and felt themselves to be no longer means to the ends of British
trade. Apart from this, the tariffs in New South Wales and
Victoria remained much as they had been before the gold
discoveries and the grant of self-government, though New South
Wales kept a higher duty on sugar in defence of the refinery on
Parramatta Road. The Deas-Thompson Tariff of 1852, the new
starting-point of New South Wales fiscal history, imposed duties
on spirits, wine, beer, tobacco, tea, coffee and sugar. That of
1855 in Victoria also set import duties on seven classes of goods
and an export duty of 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. an ounce on gold.</p>
<p>By 1860 the eager and somewhat raffish men who were finding
less and less gold each year were clamouring for other openings,
and Victorian legislators, even those who had at first regretted
the diggers' coming, could hardly acquiesce with folded hands in
the passing of the young colony's attractiveness. Manhood
suffrage left them no choice. Carried in 1857 by Haines, a
squatter Premier, it gave power to make the laws, or at least to
choose the law-makers, to strata of the population that were
impatient for their turn of the good things government could give
and in their inexperience disinclined to count the cost.</p>
<p>A purely revenue tariff is a late product of fiscal
experience, born of disillusionment with the complex results of
government manipulation of trade. It implies an abandonment in
the general interest of log-rolling by sections. Among the
newly-enfranchised strata, however, were British artisans
accustomed to action through trade societies in defence of
particular markets for their skill, and Americans and Europeans
to whom protective duties against British manufactures were
familiar boons. The golden age was fading to the light of common
day. Late in 1861 nine thousand able-bodied diggers went off to
track the rainbows in New South Wales and Otago. To fill their
places the colonial parliament continued to subsidize
immigration, voting in that year £79,000 to pay passages.
During 1862 five thousand immigrants arrived, and a land act,
setting aside a quarter of the land revenue, provided an
additional £120,000 for the purpose of immigration in
1863.</p>
<p>At this juncture the man in the street worked out an easy
corollary from Wakefield's theorem. As the government had used
public revenues to bring labouring folk to the colony, it was
under an obligation to find work for them. The Protection and
Anti-Immigration League was a natural working-class retort to
middle-class prejudices against Gawlerism. Let the government
stop glutting the labour market with "new chums" and, if it will
not itself employ men on public works, let it impose a tariff
that will enable local manufacturers to do so and compete with
imported goods. Such reasonings found an incisive champion in
David Syme in his new role of leader-writer. "By the system of
naked competition our manufacturers or mechanics are prevented
from even making a beginning in the work of opening up new
sources of industry among us", he wrote in what his biographer
claims to have been the first unequivocal Protectionist article
in any Australian newspaper. To found new industries seemed
simple enough, but "a ban is put upon the attempt at the very
outset; and in a few short years hence, if this prearranged
practice of national industrial abortion is continued amongst us,
the people of Australia will be as utter strangers to all
scientific skill and practical dexterity in the arts and
manufactures of highly civilized nations as are the Bedouins of
Barbary, or the Tartars of Central Asia. Is this a desirable
result? Is it desirable that, instead of carrying with us the
arts of advanced civilization from the parent State in Europe to
this remote land, we should purposely, and as it were with
'malice afore-thought', upon quitting the shores of that parent
State, cast behind us and abandon the knowledge and the practice
of those great industrial arts, which have constituted and still
constitute the sole groundwork of her characteristic pre-eminence
in trade, commerce and wealth? Is it not on the contrary rather
desirable that we should endeavour to perpetuate amongst us, in
our new home, that civilizing and enriching skill and trained
industry which is a part of our national inheritance?"</p>
<p>The importing interests attempted to silence Syme by
withdrawing their advertisements from his paper. He reduced its
price from 6<i>d</i>. to 3<i>d</i>., to 2<i>d</i>., and finally
in 1868 to 1<i>d</i>. The Government of the day, under John
O'Shanassy, joined his enemies in 1863 and withdrew the
Government announcements. But Syme's unflinching stand and
powerful attacks on the self-interested motives of his opponents
caught the popular imagination. His paper's circulation doubled
and trebled. Advertisers could not afford to ignore such a medium
of publicity. By the general election of 1864 he had won his
fight and was in command of the enthusiastic popular following
which remained faithful to him till his death in 1908, "marching
to the ballot box and voting in a placid phalanx for
reform".*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Ambrose Pratt, <i>op. cit</i>. p. 251.]</p>
<p>James McCulloch, who had displaced O'Shanassy before the
election, though continuing to declare himself a free-trader,
carried, after a severe constitutional struggle with the
Legislative Council, a tariff of moderate duties on apparel,
textiles, boots, saddlery and earthenware, while reducing the
duties on tea and sugar. He argued that local industries must be
helped through their days of infancy and high costs.** Logically
such a justification should have suggested subsidies rather than
import duties. For a subsidy to the infant industry would have
enabled it to sell its wares at the same price as the imported
goods, thereby sparing the consumer the rise in price consequent
on import duties and confining the cost of protection to the
taxes required to provide the subsidy. Even the choice of import
duties should logically have been tempered by a plan for their
steady reduction as the industries became "naturalized" and
efficient.</p>
<p class="foot">[** John Stuart Mill (<i>Principles of Political
Economy</i>, Book <small>V</small>, ch. <small>I</small>, sec.
<small>I</small>) regarded temporary duties on imports as
defensible on economic grounds where industries perfectly
suitable to a young country had still to be "naturalized" there.
But C. H. Chomley (Protection in Canada and Australasia, pp.
81-2) quotes a letter by Mill to a Victorian student of his work
emphasizing the limitations which he placed on their safe
use.]</p>
<p>Syme, driving his fellow-colonists on the way of "reform" that
he had chosen, sought no temporary protection. Any suggestion of
infantile inefficiency in colonial manufactures he met by a
characteristic counter-offensive. "The articles with which the
Victorian market has been deluged would have been dear at any
price. They were, and they continue to be of a kind almost
worthless, becoming unfit for use with a month's wear-and-tear;
and however low in original price, they are a source of constant
and excessive expenditure and their purchase-money in the end
turns out to have been but a profitless and wasteful outlay. This
is no exaggeration; it is the simple fact which is obvious and
patent to all." It certainly became the credo of every Age
reader. He denied, too, that import duties raised local prices.
They were meant to shut out the "foreign-trader" with his trashy
wares, but internal competition would infallibly keep local
manufacturers and dealers from raising the prices of their honest
products.</p>
<p>Why, in such a small and sheltered market, they should compete
to spoil the proffered chance of charging prices near the foreign
trader's landed cost plus duty was not made plain. Presumably the
local manufacturers would always and in all instances be patriots
as disinterested as David Syme undoubtedly was.</p>
<p>For him the tariff of 1866 was no temporary expedient but
merely a beginning. He overthrew its author McCulloch in 1871 and
Charles Gavan-Duffy, another free-trader, in 1872. They had dared
to reason with him and had refused to impose higher duties. Syme
was by this time impatient to make high import duties the
stimulus to an all-round progress in the industrial arts.*** One
might have expected such a student, and a Scot too, to have known
that necessity, not affluence, is the mother of invention and
that the industrial arts have grown with painful slowness here
and there, seldom transplanting easily or in assorted
collections. But the need for protection was self-evident to
expectant employers and artisans. Nor did the danger of
interruption of the colony's supplies from overseas fail to
receive emphasis, every war-cloud being greeted in Syme's columns
by thunder-claps of headlines.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** G. W. Cole, <i>Protection as a National
System suited to Victoria</i> (1860), had urged "a comprehensive
scheme that would foster every branch of manufacturing industry
and give security to those who would embark their capital in
manufacturing enterprise".]</p>
<p>It was "good journalism", and the phalanx of his followers
swelled to numbers as formidable as they were faithful. All the
old allies who had fought to unlock the land were enlisted in its
ranks. Duties on imported flour and grain, won the allegiance of
farmers with whom South Australian foreigners were still
competing for the Victorian market. Miners dreamed of industrial
jobs at regular wages when the anxiety and exposure of rush and
gully-camps would be no more. Prosperous manufactures would make
Victoria a great nation. "A country given up purely to pastoral
and agricultural pursuits would afford no scope for men of
artistic and constructive talents." The scepticism of the
squatters&mdash;the old "stinking fish" party&mdash;only roused
the fighting ardour of the protectionist forces. Was it not to,
the interest of such men that the colony should depend for
revenue on selling its Crown lands to the longest purses?</p>
<p>After a series of unstable ministries, Syme triumphed in 1877.
McCulloch, still recalcitrant, was overwhelmed at the polling
booths, and Graham Berry, Syme's ex-Chartist
protégé, pushed through Parliament after a
momentary reluctance "a Protective tariff in every sense of the
expression", dictated by the great silent chief himself.* The
<i>ad valorem</i> duties it imposed ranged to 30, 40 and in a few
instances 45 per cent., and were backed, where these were thought
more effective, by high specific duties. "King David" ruled
supreme. By 1883, James Service, the stiffest free-trader left in
public life, bowed to his majesty and was installed as colleague
with Graham Berry in a coalition required, and forced by Syme to
straighten out the finances of the colony. Service accepted
Syme's condition that he should not interfere with "the declared
economic policy of the country", that is, a tariff of duties on
imports averaging 25 per cent.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Ambrose Pratt, <i>op. cit</i>. pp.
170-2.]</p>
<p>In its ostensible and immediate purpose of increasing
employment in Victorian manufactures, protection was successful.
Between 1864 and 1874 the number of factory hands in Victoria
increased fourfold. Twenty-eight thousand were "in work" where
there had been only seven thousand. Yet this was hardly a
decisive advance in artistic and constructive talent. At an
intercolonial conference on, tariffs in 1870 the protectionist
Treasurer admitted that Victorian manufactures "consisted mainly
of goods which are made up wholly or in part from imported
materials".** The sewing machine was largely responsible for a
big increase in the industrial employment of women during the
'seventies and 'eighties. As the policy. of borrowing tens of
millions in London to build railways and ports accentuated the
need for exports to pay interest on this capital equipment,
industrial employment was not found capable of swelling the list
of staple products exported. Industry came to the aid of
agriculture in that the best agricultural implements were of
local invention and make. But the necessity that produced them
had arisen before the days of Syme, and the most rapid
agricultural development of this generation took place in the
'nineties under free trade in New South Wales. Prior to
federation, Victorian factories sold the bulk of their output in
the Victorian market and, if a contemporary pamphleteer is to be
trusted, "dumped" at cut prices such of their goods as they sent
to other colonies to compete with the foreigner.*** That would
assist New South Wales farmers rather than their
fellow-Victorians.</p>
<p class="foot">[** J. G. Francis, <i>Report of Intercolonial
Conference on Tariffs</i>, Melbourne, June&mdash;July 1870.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Max Hirsch, <i>Protection in Australia</i>
(1900), Table XXIV, p. 31, showing the prices charged in Sydney
and Melbourne for certain Victorian manufactures.]</p>
<p>Yet in young communities like Victoria, so long as growth is
rapid and virgin resources remain to be developed, hope takes
every plan conceived for an accomplished fact. In 1887 <i>The
Age</i>, attributing to protection the turn of immigration back
into Victoria that accompanied the railway mania and land boom of
the mid-'eighties, announced "the startling fact that
protectionist Victoria . . . in a few years will have left New
South Wales far, behind in the race for commercial
supremacy".*</p>

South Wales", a series of articles published by <i>The Age</i> in
March and April of 1887. As, evidence that "our exports are

writer relied on (i) the trade in agricultural implements to the
Riverina, a part of N.S.W. nearer Melbourne than Sydney to which
the Victorian Railways quoted special railway freights, and (ii)
exports of flour.]</p>
<p>But while the scribe was yet writing, the hours of Victoria's
greatness were fast running out. Ten years later, New South Wales,
in spite of her adherence to "Cobdenism", had drawn ahead of
Victoria in population, had gained upon her even in manufactures
and exceeded, her in the industrial arts that call for brain and
sinew. If, indeed, Victoria's policy of protection had been
judged by its efficacy towards the grand object for which it was
shaped&mdash;the absorption of the population left without
callings by the exhaustion of the alluvial diggings&mdash;by 1881
it had already been found wanting. Sixty thousand men had
departed during the intercensal period 1871-81 and had left the
colony with fewer adult males than it had possessed when that
decade opened.** Protection had not, in popular estimation, made
it easier to find employment in Victoria. The demand that state
aid to immigration should cease was enforced by the prevalence of
unemployment as early as 1873.***</p>
<p class="foot">[** T. A. Coghlan, <i>Labour and Industry in
Australia</i>, p. 1481.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** State-aided immigration continued in South
Australia until 1886, in N.S.W. until 1888, in Queensland until
1891. It had been intermittent only in Tasmania between 1835 and
1887. See <i>Commonwealth Demography, Bulletin</i> no. 44, p.
276. For phases of public opinion regarding it the following

D. Bennet, 2nd InterColonial T.U.C. (1884).]</p>
<p>The colonies other than Victoria rested content, for the most
part, with tariffs designed primarily to raise revenue.
Queensland duties on refined sugar and "golden syrup" impelled
the Colonial Sugar Refining Company of Sydney to establish a
branch refinery there in 1892.* In South Australia "fiscal
indecision" was the normal state both of leaders and tariff. The
main interest of a community very active in primary production
was free intercolonial trade, but protective duties aided the
establishment of clothing factories and a woollen mill.** In New
South Wales Sir Henry Parkes was as earnest an advocate of free
trade as David Syme was of protection in Victoria. In his
political youth he dallied with the idea of protecting local
industries *** but on his return from a lecturing tour in search
of British immigrants he proclaimed himself an ardent free-trader
(1862). Pastoral and financial opinion inclined to a policy which
kept down the cost of living and of production for export, while
the abundant revenue from the sale of Crown lands left its rulers
relatively untempted by the ease with which big sums might be
raised at the Customs House. Under Parkes's dominance of her
politics during the 'seventies and 'eighties the mother colony
adhered to his fiscal faith. Nor did that policy indefinitely
retard, as David Syme thought it must, the establishment of
manufactures. Not in population only but in the opportunities of
employment New South Wales steadily overhauled Victoria.**** The
industries of the former colony, moreover, not only afforded more
employment to men, but exploited the natural advantages of coal
and raw materials and were therefore better able to weather the
crises of the 'nineties.</p>

<p>Victoria's "national policy" did not maintain her primacy in
population and wealth. Perhaps that ambition was too high. But
the attempt set up stresses in intercolonial relations which made
the period one of disintegration and drove the leaders in all the
colonies into a jealous provincialism. Six intercolonial
conferences, in the years 1863, 1865, 1867, 1870, 1871 and 1873,
sought relief from the irksome restraints of customs barriers at
the borders. At each the disagreement grew more bitter. The first
conference drafted a light revenue tariff of duties on wines,
spirits, beer, tobacco, sugar, coffee, cocoa, opium, dried
fruits, candles, oils and salt&mdash;with one exception
"conventional necessities" in ordinary consumption and therefore
admirable objects for indirect taxation. The delegates, being the
Premiers of their respective colonies, agreed to urge their
parliaments to accept this common tariff as the means of
intercolonial free trade and joint prosperity. It was to be
maintained unaltered until changes proposed by any one colony had
been considered by all in conference. Out of such an agreement
would quickly have grown a Customs Union collecting revenue at
coastal ports only and distributing it among the colonial
treasurers according to population. The Premiers went home proud
of having found a happy solution of border problems, only to find
themselves a generation ahead of their followers.</p>
<p>At the moment New South Wales needed additional revenue. The
sale of Crown lands under the Robertson Act had hardly begun to
bear fruit. Nor was there wanting a feeling that Victorian
protectionism would add to the attractiveness of Sydney's harbour
and make Sydney's warehouses the distributing centres for the
Eastern colonies and the islands.* Victoria, in the first fever
of Syme's inoculation with the protectionist serum, felt strong
distaste for even intercolonial freedom of trade. Both the major
colonies rejected the simple unalterable tariff and without them
the others were scattered members.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Throughout the 'sixties and early 'seventies
Victoria tried hard to induce the P. &amp; O. Company to make
Melbourne the final port of call for its mail steamers. See
<i>The Argus</i>, 25 July and 25 August 1860, and <i>The Postal
Question</i>, 1873 (Mitchell Library Pamphlets).]</p>
<p>As the Premiers had foreseen, awkward problems arose on the
inland borders as a result of the enactment of different tariffs
at the far-distant capitals. The boundaries of New South Wales,
Victoria and South Australia cut up the Murray-Darling
river-basin, scene of the main pastoral activity, without the
least regard for the unity which the area should have derived
from the navigation of the rivers. In September 1853 Francis
Cadell had proved that navigation was feasible by piloting a
little river steamer built in Sydney, the "Lady Augusta", from
the Murray Mouth to Swan Hill and bringing back 441 bales of
Riverina wool. Before 1860 he had traded with Albury, Gundagai
and Menindee on the three main streams.** The value of stations
on the Darling doubled, it was said, on the day he reached them.
To be rid of such irrational things as customs houses in the back
blocks, Victoria and South Australia arranged that duties on
goods passing up the Murray into Victoria should be collected at
Adelaide, while New South Wales and Victoria assimilated their
tariffs. That was in 1854. Two years later the discovery of a
goldfield in New South Wales but near enough to the Victorian
border to be better served from Melbourne than from Sydney
tempted the elder colony, at the instance of its merchants, to
handicap the Melbourne trade thither by charging duty a second
time at Albury and other Murray River crossings. Smuggling proved
easy and the manoeuvre was futile. In 1864, however, as
settlement became active in the Riverina, New South Wales talked
of strict administration all along the Murray, especially at
Moama opposite Echuca, the Victorian river port, unless Victoria
would pay over as subsidy a fair share of the duties collected at
Melbourne on goods that passed through Victoria into, the
Riverina.***</p>

Australia</i> (1929), pp. 221-53.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Sir. John Young to the Earl of Carnarvon, 24
January 1867. The agreement, as the Colonial Office preferred to
call it, was duly ratified by the N.S.W. Parliament in August
1867.]</p>
<p>Melbourne had but lately made herself a more effective centre
for the Riverina trade by the construction at very great expense
of a railway to Echuca. This would afford a regular and rapid
service far superior to the tedious and seasonal navigation of
the Murray. Unwilling to lose the traffic, Victoria managed to
exact a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the subsidy asked by New South
Wales. She expressed a willingness to pay the subsidy if, while
refraining from setting customs officers on the Victorian border,
the mother colony would post them where the Murray entered South
Australia to tax goods coming up the river. Melbourne merchants
would then have free access by rail to the Riverina, but South
Australia's ambition to increase the river-borne trade would be
effectively scotched. Along, the Murray the country settlers
talked of shooting any customs officers that appeared and their
threats did not go unreported even by. <i>The Age</i>, usually
given to admiring such officials. After an acrimonious
negotiation New South Wales and Victoria entered into a "treaty"
in 1867 at South Australia's expense.***</p>
<p class="foot">[See footnote ***, previous paragraph.]</p>
<p>Such a bargain suggested to Victoria's smaller neighbours,
Tasmania and South Australia, that they should bargain too in
defence of their export to Victoria of agricultural products.
Mutual concessions, they were astonished to find, were barred by
the terms of their constitutions which forbade the grant to
anyone of tariff advantages, which might be inconsistent with
British policy, including British treaties of trade and commerce
with European countries.**** The Colonial Office, regarding this
provision as a spur to complete freedom of trade, made the most
of the diplomatic difficulties which intercolonial reciprocity
would involve. Tasmania, impatient of adversity, sought to
retaliate against Victoria with a raised tariff if she might not
negotiate with a lowered one. She proposed to levy on imported
goods duties varying with the treatment accorded to those of
Tasmania in the country of the imports' origin. This, too, was
"reserved" for the Colonial Office's consideration. Another
intercolonial conference was called at the suggestion of
Tasmania. It met at Melbourne in June 1870 to consider again the
project of a Customs Union. This the Colonial Office would allow,
for it would constitute a new diplomatic unit. Freedom of trade
between its constituent parts would not be open to "the objection
of principle which attaches to differential duties".*****</p>

Wales, 7 January 1868.]</p>
<p class="foot">[***** Circular Despatch from the Earl of
Kimberley to the Australian Governors, 15 July 1870.]</p>
<p>Again a common tariff and a unified customs administration
dividing the revenue from indirect taxes according to population
slipped through the colonial leaders' grasp. New South Wales
stood firm for a revenue tariff only, and withdrew as soon as
Victoria, intent upon playing the part of Prussia in this
Southern Zollverein, demanded that all should adopt her national
policy of protection. Nay more. She refused to contemplate a
tariff alterable by general consent alone. For a specific term
she demanded full and sole power to make changes in the
tariff.</p>
<p>The only point upon which the conference could reach unanimity
was in proclaiming to the Colonial Office the right of free
colonies to make their own terms for reciprocity in trade. Bills
designed to raise this constitutional issue passed the Tasmanian
and South Australian houses and were duly reserved for the Royal
assent. In reply, the Secretary of State for the Colonies (13
July 1871) thought it would be inexpedient to invite the Imperial
Parliament "to legislate in a direction contrary to the
established commercial policy of this country" and to admit
intercolonial reciprocity. Charles Gavan-Duffy as Premier of
Victoria certainly spoke for all when he expressed the colonists'
impatience at "being treated as persons who cannot be trusted to
regulate their own affairs at their own discretion". Julius
Vogel, the able Attorney-General of New Zealand, sought to
persuade the Colonial Office that its refusal to countenance
reciprocity was actually fostering retaliation and aggravating
the tendency towards protection.* More conferences, one in
September 1871 and another in February 1873, at long last
persuaded Downing. Street. The Australian Colonies Duties Act of
April 1873 allowed them to make whatever trade agreements and
laws between themselves they might desire.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The most incisive comments on the effects in
Australia of the Colonial Office's attitude towards tariff-making
may be found in the Tasmanian Governor du Cane's despatch to the
Earl of Kimberley, 29 September 1871.]</p>
<p>The light had dawned too late. Divided sovereignty had done
its work, and faith in common action had wilted while the power
to move towards it was withheld. Growing discrepancy between the
tariffs of the two main colonies inevitably broke down even their
sinister agreement about trade across the Murray. When Victoria
adopted a heavier tariff and New South Wales in 1873 cut hers
down to 45 specific duties, it became worth while to send goods
in bond from Melbourne to the Riverina, to release them free of
duty on New South Wales territory and send them back at low
freights into Victoria. Victorian Ministers promptly denounced
the "treaty" of 1867 and established customs houses on their side
of the border. But South Australia did not gain by this dispute
between her rivals for the Murray trade. The Victorian railways
still quoted special freight rates on goods and produce to and
from the Riverina. To obtain what she held to be her share of the
trade within her own territory, New South Wales extended her
railways and cut the rates again. At Albury in 1876 Sir Hercules
Robinson, her Governor and a staunch advocate of railways to
serve primary production in the interior, deplored the
disintegrating effect of intercolonial tariffs, railway feuds and
breaks of gauge. "The policy of railway extensions has been
almost solely one of isolation, directed mainly to the object of
securing by one device or another, for the rival capitals, as
much of the traffic of the country as possible. . . . It is the
interest of the country at large that the traffic should flow
through its natural and most economical channels, and any attempt
to divert its course by restrictions or artificial regulations is
simply a waste of wealth and power and a common loss."</p>
<p>In that generation, however, the interest of the country at
large had no means of expression. Continued bickering between New
South Wales and Victoria over the inland customs barrier came to
a climax in 1877 when Victoria imposed heavy duties on the
transfer of live stock over the Murray. It was the night of
provincialism. Difficulties and habits of mind that have since
proved fruitful of ill-feeling and absurdities were being
aggravated by local leaders, each intent on serving the part he
loved and unconscious of a common weal.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** John. Robertson, the "King Goodheart" of Free
Selection before Survey, rose at a banquet held in Sydney during
November 1872 to celebrate the establishment of telegraphic
communication with England, to congratulate South Australia on
filling the last gap. "Mr Robertson", reports the Sydney Mail, 23
November 1872, "put in a claim on behalf of New South Wales for
its mead of praise on the ground that it had the largest extent
of telegraph lines, and to himself for having been, the Minister
under whom the first construction contract in N.S.W. was carried
out, . . . South Australia, with more eagerness than wisdom or
courtesy, has seized a coveted opportunity of forestalling its
neighbours and had completed a bargain which, having been made in
haste, would have to be repented of, at leisure. The line through
Central Australia would some day prove a failure." Possibly a
reference at the end of the report to failure on the part of the
caterer for the banquet may explain, though it may not excuse, Mr
Robertson's "courtesy". The party was "shrewdly out of beef!"
Yet, tragically enough, there was much truth in his libel on
South Australia and her line. See chapter <small>XX</small>,
<i>infra</i>.]</p>
<p>On one issue&mdash;perhaps the most fundamental of
all&mdash;the colonial leaders in Eastern Australia reached
unanimity of thought and action, that is, on the exclusion of
Chinese labour. The restrictive laws by which the coming of
Chinese miners had been impeded in the 'fifties were quietly
repealed in the 'sixties, having served their purpose. In the
early 'seventies a Queensland Government even opened negotiations
for the introduction of Chinese coolies to work under indenture
in the sugar industry. Then alluvial gold and silver were found
on the Palmer River (1873) and on the Hodgkinson (1875). Both are
in torrid country, and when a fresh influx of Chinese came to dig
for gold the feeling once generated at Buckland River and Lambing
Flat was accentuated by the virtual monopoly the Chinese
obtained. In 1877 on the Palmer field behind Cooktown there were
17,000 licensed Chinese miners and only 1400 whites.*</p>

Emigration</i> (1922), pp. 61 <i>et seq</i>. and Myra Willard,
<i>White Australia Policy</i> (1923), chapter
<small>III</small>.]</p>
<p>The Thorn ministry passed through the Brisbane Parliament a
measure imposing heavy licence fees, which Governor Cairns
reserved for the Royal assent on the old ground that such laws
were inconsistent with British treaties with China. The Earl of
Carnarvon confirmed his action but let it be known that the Royal
assent would not be refused to a Bill which refrained from
singling out the subjects of China for onerous treatment.</p>
<p>Governor Cairns' reservation of the measure called forth a
loud outcry from the Queensland liberals, which was echoed
farther south by ministries to which Thorn appealed for common
action on this constitutional issue. But the Earl of Carnarvon's
hint was taken and in 1877 and 1878 restrictions on the coming of
Chinese were framed in forms consonant with the British treaties.
Those who returned to China within a limited period, moreover,
were offered the refund of their entrance fees. As in the earlier
episode, the decline of alluvial digging ere long made any such
taxes prohibitive. By 1881 the Chinese in Queensland were only
11,200 in number and newcomers were barely a hundred a year.</p>
<p>Before that natural solution was reached on the tropical
diggings, however, Chinese labour had become a formidable problem
on Australian coastal ships. On this issue it fell to New South
Wales to lead in proposing exclusion. In 1877 the Australasian
Steam Navigation Company, under pressure of competition, replaced
British seamen by Chinese on three of its vessels. The arrival of
a hundred more Chinese seafarers at Sydney in November 1878 gave
token of an intention to extend their employment. Almost
throughout the Company's fleet the white seamen struck, and the
wage-earners of the ports and capitals supported them with,
enthusiasm by public demonstration and union levies. The
Queensland Government, closely sympathetic with the popular
feeling, notified the Company that it would withdraw the mail
subsidy from vessels so manned. Thereupon, early in 1879, the
Company agreed to reduce gradually the Chinese element in the
crews. Sir Henry Parkes having fought and won an election on the
issue of Chinese exclusion, the New South Wales Assembly at his
instance adopted a Bill to revive the old restrictions and to add
a prohibition of the employment of Chinese on vessels registered
in the colony. As the excitement died away after the success of
the strike, the Legislative Council postponed the Bill. But the
working men in all the eastern colonies were in grim earnest.
They had learned the extent of their influence on political
leaders and they kept up their pressure until, about 1881,
practically uniform laws against Chinese immigration had been
enacted in all those colonies. Public opinion on the question was
kept alive by California's troubles with a much bigger inroad of
Celestials, by fears not altogether groundless that the Chinese
would bring to Australia diseases like smallpox and leprosy that
were endemic in Asia, and by an untimely project for indentured
Chinese labour on the north-west coast of Australia.</p>
<p>This proposal, though of small moment, precipitated united
action at an intercolonial conference called, by Sir Henry Parkes
in 1880. It involved, the importation of some fifty Chinese only
and was termed a "temporary expedient". It served, however, to
evoke from the Conference a warm protest which was sent in its
name to the Earl of Kimberley.** The Governor of the Crown Colony
of Western Australia sought through the Colonial Office to
reassure the governments concerned. It was a matter of sentiment
without practical moment. In that sentiment, however, the
self-governing colonists were more nearly unanimous than in any
other. Only Tasmania neglected to levy a heavy capitation tax on
immigrant Chinese and to define strictly the number which any
vessel might introduce. At the instance of the Adelaide
Legislative Council the South Australian measure was not to apply
to the Northern Territory then under that colony's jurisdiction.
But in 1886 even Western Australia, now that gold-digging had
spread to her tropics, fell into line.</p>

<p>Recklessly lighting the fires of class conflict, the colonists
were all too ready to bicker among themselves on internal
problems such as free or safeguarded selection. They might build
railways to divert and divide, and tariffs to impede, their
central trade. Their notion of progress in industry was to
"protect" faint copies of industrial triumphs in their old home.
But the general will was agreed that the wage-earner's standard
of living must not be spoiled by alien intruders whose docile
assiduity, however charming to employers, was unwelcome in
British Australia.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI<br>
<br>
Inland Transport</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> early pastoralists had to live the whole
year round on the wide tablelands and plains that the explorers
had glimpsed and scrambled through. Once he was sure of water,
the squatter's main problem was transport. In days when the
industry had to find its own convoys, stores and wool carried by
packhorse and bullock-waggon moved painfully, straining endurance
near to breaking point. Tropical rains would make the black soil
plains of Queensland virtually impassable for weeks on end, and
it was no unusual thing in the 'sixties for a bullock-dray to
take three months on the way from Mitchell's "Fort Bourke" to
Bathurst.</p>
<p>In 1847-8 Alan Macpherson formed a new station at Mount
Abundance, west of the Darling Downs near the junction of the
Cogoon River and Bunjeywargorai Creek. In January 1848 he found
himself, after a flood, under the necessity of pushing out to it
with rations from Keera on the Gwydir in northern New South
Wales. He started on February 1st with a dray lightly loaded, ten
bullocks, two drivers and a Keera black to track any bullocks
that strayed. In three weeks they covered a hundred miles, about
a third of the way. Then they entered boggy country. They spent
February 28th getting stores over the Boomai River in a tub.
Finally they wrapped the flour in a tarpaulin and set the
bullocks to drag the dray through "the shoalest part of the
river". On the far bank the team were bogged up to their middles,
so the men carried the flour from the dray, still in mid-stream.
It was well they did. After further attempts to scramble up the
west bank, the bullocks turned in mid-stream and, despite a
well-plied whip and much bush rhetoric, pulled out again on to
the east bank. Twenty-two times that day Macpherson had swum what
in writing he termed "this unpleasant river". Towards dark,
another tremendous thunder-shower caught them with the sugar
uncovered. They spent ten days more in crossing a dozen miles of
bad country. Then conditions mended. The "boss" was able to push
forward to Mount Abundance with word of the relief, and to reach
it on March 25th.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Mount Abundance: Experiences of a Pioneer
Squatter</i>, by Alan Macpherson, Blairgowrie (1875), Mitchell
Library.]</p>
<p>George Hobler met similar trials as he journeyed slowly down
the Murrumbidgee after March 1845 in search of relief from the
catarrh which had decimated his Merinos on Mummele, south of
Goulburn. In August he was forced to put his stores across the
flooded river on a raft made from six casks. Then they swam the
bullocks over. Hauling the waggon through, under water, was a
heavy business. "It soon sank so deep as not to leave a ripple on
the surface, and it was rather an anxious time as we gained
steadily on the rope. At last the point of the pole"&mdash;which
had been lashed upright to prevent its getting foul of any
timber&mdash;"broke the water again and the whole machine
gradually emerged. As we could not pull it up the bank, we put a
team of oxen to it, when lo! the rope broke and the waggon began
to walk back again into deep water. But it stopped before it got
too deep for us. We made fast with chains and dragged it out
safely. The same by the drays."</p>
<p>Such strainings alternated with endless slow trudging over
flats,</p>
<p class="poem">When the wool teams in season came down from
Coonamble<br>
And journeyed for weeks on their way to the sea.</p>
<p>Until the digging days, "made roads" were unknown beyond the
coastal settlements. Major. Mitchell surveyed the main northern
road as far as the Hunter River in 1829. Newcastle had till then
been accessible only by sea. A year later, Mitchell was at work
on the southern road and on a new road to Bathurst to replace
what remained of "Captain Cox's wonderful but somewhat primitive
highway". Over the gullies and water-courses wooden bridges, too
often destroyed by bush-fires, were one by one replaced by stone
after 1832. In this Mitchell was aided by David Lennox from
Ayrshire, a pupil of Thomas Telford. Lennox, a working mason, had
been foreman on a bridge that Telford built near Gloucester. He
brought to the colony clear memories of its 150 foot span, a
thing of beauty borrowed by Telford from a bridge over the Seine
at Neuilly. "Thus originated", wrote Mitchell in 1855, "all the
bridges this colony possesses worthy of the name." Lansdowne
Bridge over Prospect Creek on the Southern Road, though not
Lennox's first stone bridge in New South Wales, was the first in
which he re-copied the Neuilly arch.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** In 1844 Governor Gipps sent Lennox to bridge
the Yarra at Melbourne, which he did by Old Prince's Bridge, a
single span of 150 feet opened on 25 November 1850. It was
demolished in 1884 when the river was widened. Under the new
Victorian Government Lennox built over 50 bridges, and had
charge, at a salary of £300 a year, of all construction of
roads, wharves and jetties. See his biography by Henry Selkirk,
<i>Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society</i>, vol.
<small>VI</small>, part <small>V</small>.]</p>
<p>But Mitchell was not happy in his control of the "government
men" on the roads. In 1836 actual construction was handed over to
the Royal Engineers. They could certainly discipline the
convicts, but unluckily they could not work the survey
instruments. When the supply of convicts petered out in the
'forties, the roads, according to the Constitution Act of 1842,
became the care of district councils empowered to levy local
rates for their upkeep. But the districts into which, in 1843, "a
few scratches of the Governor's pen" had divided the settled
areas around Port Jackson and Port Philip failed to excite the
local patriotism of either councillors or ratepayers.*** The
colonists thought the building of roads a proper charge on the
"land fund". This flowed into the central treasury and seemed a
desirable alternative to the imposition of local rates and
taxes.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Cf. Sir G. Gipps' homily on finance to the
N.S.W. Legislative Council, 23 July 1839, quoted in "Notes on
History of Local Government in Victoria", by A. W. Greig,
<i>Proceedings of Victorian Historical Society</i>, 1925.]</p>
<p>After an interval in which the excellent "convict roads" fell
into disrepair, Mitchell resumed charge of the turnpike roads.
But the tolls did not go far. Labour was scarce, and, as the
settlers jolted over roads that had once been the colony's pride,
they no doubt sighed heavily for the days of the government
gangs.* For use on the unmade inland tracks to and about the
diggings, newcomers from America brought with them the idea of
vehicles that dispensed with the need of roads. These were the
bush-coach, always associated in Australia with the name of Cobb
&amp; Co., and the American buggy. The main feature of their
construction was a light body suspended by straps above four
wheels of large diameter. This simplicity made repair possible
anywhere. A wheel or swingle-tree might come to grief in
collision with a stump that a sleepy driver had failed to notice
in the dark or the dust; but he was a poor hand indeed if he
could not cut a sapling to replace the broken spoke or fix up the
broken traces with the aid of the local fencing wire. As a means
of rapid conveyance the bush-coach was hardly comfortable. "When
drawn at a smart trot&mdash;its usual pace&mdash;on a jolting
road, sometimes running in a rut from which it jumps now and then
with a shudder, or upsetting in a hole hidden by a puddle of
water", a French observer was ready to term it "an instrument of
torture." ** Nor was its rough charm enhanced by the usual
concomitants of dust, heat, and incessant attacks on ears, eyes
and nostrils by a cloud of flies which rode on each traveller's
back, and reserved their best efforts for the sandy uphill
pinches where to ease the horses everyone got out and walked. Yet
for all their discomforts and inelegance the American coach and
buggy admirably suited the countryside. Light and supple, they
rattled over the inequalities of thousands of miles where the
formation and upkeep of roads were beyond the means of a thin
skirmishing line of settlers. You might drive them up a hillside
or through a forest, or over a "road" which had set into a
thousand deep ruts of baked mud. To arrive anywhere, if you did
not ride a horse, there was no other choice.</p>

<p>The leathern "springs" of Cobb &amp; Co.'s coaches date back
to 1853 and the Bendigo diggings.*** Four Americans founded the
firm&mdash;Freeman Cobb, John Murray Peck, James Swanton and John
Lamber&mdash;but its best brain was another American, James
Rutherford, who with five partners bought out Cobb &amp; Co. and
reorganized the lines about the Victorian diggings. Having gained
a monopoly of the Victorian mail-contracts, Cobb &amp; Co. drove
a cavalcade of 103 horses, 10 coaches and 2 feed waggons over the
border to Bathurst in 1861. There Rutherford and Walter Russell
Hall fixed their headquarters. Thence they spread their services
throughout the back country. After 1865 they conquered
Queensland. "By 1870 Cobb &amp; Co. in the three eastern colonies
were harnessing 6000 horses per day, their coaches were
travelling 28,000 miles per week, their annual pay-sheet exceeded
£100,000 and they received £95,000 per annum in mail
subsidies.</p>

Co</i>.]</p>
<p>Their routes showed the way to the railways, the motor-lorries
and airways of to-day. As the locomotive appeared on the main
lines, Cobb &amp; Co. went farther out. In the 'eighties they
plied on 4000 miles of Queensland "roads", and the last coach was
taken off the Yeulba-Surat run only in 1924, passing thence to
the Queensland Museum.</p>
<p>Bullock-waggons and the red coaches of Cobb &amp; Co. were
crude makeshifts at best, very wasteful of the time and endurance
of their users. Yet with them men proved the land and showed what
it could produce. In the 'seventies and 'eighties, British
capital, seeing the big markets for Australian wool, metals and
meat, helped to fence and water the station properties and to
link them with the ports by railways and telegraphs. Served by
these, the flocks increased from 20,980,123 in 1861 to
106,419,751 in 1891, cattle multiplied from 3,846,554 to
11,112,112 in 1891, and the better care and breeding of the sheep
showed in a seven-fold increase of the wool-clip from 78,485,900
pounds to 543,495,800.</p>
<p>Such progress within a single generation could never have been
made with road-transport alone. Neither the art nor the
administrative machinery of road-building made effective advance.
Attempts at construction on tender virgin soil by half-trained
engineers, though they cost from five to six thousand pounds a
mile, ended in deep mud or flying dust clouds. "It is absurd",
wrote Governor Hotham, "to go on spending £500,000 a year
in making roads which disappear after a winter's wear. This
colony, for political as well as for financial reasons, should
borrow money for railways on the security of the land fund." *
After Melbourne folk had been tormented for decades by the dust
which the north wind drove in thick clouds along their broad
straight streets, a civil engineer told them how unsuitable to a
dry climate with boisterous land winds were the water-bound
macadamized roads of Britain. Concrete roads, he explained,
though expensive at first would call for little upkeep and would
minimize the dust nuisance.** But local governing bodies equal to
the technical and financial tasks of building such roads were but
slowly created. In Victoria, where local government was most
active, the "shires" received wide rating powers in 1863, but
borrowing powers for boroughs and shires were not added until
1874. In New South Wales municipal institutions did not become
general until after 1905. It was the railway age, and the need of
good roads or local road authorities was not felt.</p>

Age</i>, 18 October 1862.]</p>

should be filled with a material not liable to softening in wet
nor to blowing out in dry weather. The only known available
material supplying these conditions is Cement Mortar which, after
the interstices have been closed to the utmost by rolling; should
be grouted to a depth of three or four inches."]</p>
<p>When in the 'fifties the carriage of goods to the gold-fields
normally cost more than the goods themselves when landed on
Sandridge or Williamstown wharves; when consumers were paying
between two and three million pounds per annum to carriers, as
well as heavy charges for police protection, Victoria had looked
a fresh and promising scene for "associated enterprise" in
railway construction. But it was not enough to prove macadamized
roads expensive, and wages and fodder-prices exorbitant: it did
not follow that, because railway companies had won through their
infant ailments to success in Britain, they would do so in a new
colony. There were far better openings in Australia for
speculators than railways could hope to offer.*** "The colonists
have so little disposition to embark their capital in such
undertakings that, even with a dividend secured by a Government
guarantee, it has been found wholly impossible to finance any
extensive scheme of railways by means of local shareholders."
"Railways enterprize does not offer sufficient temptation for
investment to those who desire to become rapidly rich." The
Melbourne, Mount Alexander and Murray River Railway Company,
projected in 1852, had received "an extent of encouragement to
which", thought Captain Andrew Clarke, "the history of associated
enterprize in railways affords no parallel". Five thousand pounds
was advanced for preliminary expenses. Government guaranteed a
dividend of five per cent. for twenty years on all paid up
capital, and granted free land for the line and stations,
including fifty acres for a Melbourne terminus. But by April 1855
only 5127 shares of twenty-five pounds had been sold out of
40,000, and, instead of a line to the goldfields and the Murray,
the great Company had decided to confine its attention to the
line to Williamstown, ten miles long. Commissioners on Internal
Communication reported in 1854 that "the opening up of great
lines of railway will be a work of time, it will cost millions of
money and will require a combination of talent and perseverance,
a command of large resources and an amount of confidence on the
part of the public which are not likely for some time to come to
be the attendants on private colonial undertakings of this
magnitude".**** In May 1856, the Melbourne, Mount Alexander and
Murray River Railway Company sold out to the Government for a
nominal sum. The Hobson's Bay Railway Company and two smaller
concerns prospered on suburban passenger traffic, but only by
charging high fares.</p>

<p>The record of private or associated enterprise around Sydney
was even more discreditable. The Sydney Railway Company, after
struggling for eight years to, raise enough capital to build a
line from Sydney to Parramatta, collapsed and left the
uncompleted task to the State. Its engineers earned eternal
infamy for it by involving the two leading colonies in their
disastrous choice of different gauges.* Though, in the generation
after the convict system had ceased, political opinion was very
hostile to government action, it was plainly beyond local
resources to link the capitals with the goldfields, or to build
lines that would handle the all-important wool traffic at lower
freight-charges. "The intervention of the authorities of the
country is no longer a matter of expediency but of
necessity."</p>

the Government than it raised for itself. In a pamphlet published
in 1854, T. S. Mort advocated the issue for its benefit of
Government-guaranteed bearer shares. Circulating like bank-notes,
these, he argued, would be a sure means of attracting small
savings and thus of avoiding the need of borrowing abroad and
"the danger of government taking part in industrial
operations".]</p>
<p>Men were not wanting to plan a transport system for the
distant future, with a spacious disregard of cost. One
pamphleteer urged the necessity of a North-South line from the
Gulf country to Melbourne, with an extension through Queensland
to the Northern Territory.** Another urged the substitution for
rails of great trunk roads on which rubber-tyred locomotives
should run.*** The Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia, Sir
Henry Young, sought to harmonize the use of river and railway
transport. The enlightened nature of his proposals for connecting
Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide was recognized. But each of the
new colonial governments was intent on the transport needs of its
own constituents and inclined to see these as opposed to those of
others rather than as reconcilable in a common system.**** A
French visitor in 1885, thinking of the carefully planned railway
web of France or Belgium, was shocked to find no general plan for
the railways of any one colony, still less for those of
Australia.*****</p>

<p>A central authority, had it existed, might have planned a
railway system for the pastoral and agricultural areas with due
regard to easy gradients to coastal ports and to the spacing of
the lines in proportion to traffic. The latter was perhaps the
more fundamental task. Though a valuable commodity per bale, and
thus able to bear the cost of long land transport, wool is a
sparse crop. An acre will produce at best only some ten pounds in
a year. Therefore the railways that collect it into big
trainloads for haulage to the sea may be spaced a hundred miles
apart. The wool could well bear the cost of haulage to the
railway, even by the bullock dray, from stations fifty miles from
the line. The economical network of railways for wool traffic was
a wide-meshed one. The savings possible by rail transport as
compared with road transport were still adequate, after being
shared between the pastoralists and the railways, to extend
greatly the two margins of profitable sheep-running, its limit in
the interior and its degree of capital equipment and care
everywhere. When the fancy prices of the gold-digging days had
gone, two shillings per ton-mile had remained the ruling charge
on the waggons. The freight for miscellaneous goods over the
private railways of the 'fifties was a quarter of this, viz.
6<i>d</i>. per ton-mile.</p>
<p>Ideal plans for the railways of Eastern Australia as a whole
were beyond the ken of colonial engineers fighting to build a
railway of any sort into the productive interior. In New South
Wales, after Penrith and Picton had been reached on the Western
and Southern railways, there was so little traffic that the
politicians of the hour thought of extending them by
horse-tramways. It was all that the engineer-in-chief could do;
with the vigorous seconding of Governor Sir John Young, to obtain
authority to build for the locomotive, albeit with sharp curves
and gradients. But Sydney, for all her deep, safe harbour and
abundant natural wharfage, is separated from the wool lands by a
rough and sterile area where railway construction was costly,
haulage heavy, and traffic light. Zig-zags and gradients of one
in thirty were needed to climb the ranges. The cost of such
stupendous work&mdash;for such it was in proportion to a traffic
of forty tons a day on the main Western line&mdash;forced the
Government to meet interest payments out of fresh loans. This
lapse into bad finance, however inevitable, was difficult to
recover from when once made.</p>
<p>Benevolent governments were urged to ignore cost of service,
and to set rates of freight that would develop the traffic. And
freights that were reasonable, even cheap, to the wool men in
comparison with the costs of transport by bullock teams, were
still high to farmers. Free selectors grumbled that the railway
was too dear for them when in the 'seventies it cost
8½<i>d</i>. per bushel to send wheat from Echuca to
Melbourne, a haul of only 156 miles. When agricultural implements
were charged £4. 11<i>s</i>. per ton for the same journey,
the farmer jibbed and sent his team to Melbourne to bring plough
or stripper up by road.* Agricultural settlements made a demand
not only for light freights but also for closer lines. Wheat is
by no means comparable with wool in value, weight for weight. An
acre under cultivation, however, will produce from ten to twenty
bushels, weighing over five to ten hundredweight, and as much as
three tons of hay. Such a bulk of produce will load many more
trains but, as the cost of hauling it to the siding by horse or
bullock team mounted rapidly with the distance from the line,
fifteen miles out became the limit of profitable settlement This
meant that, if settlement by farmers was to fill in the blank
spaces on the railway map, the mesh of the network had to be
reduced to thirty miles.**</p>

for Carriage of Wood and Wheat".]</p>
<p>No doubt it would have been wise, had it been feasible, to
wait for the agricultural settlement of the land within access of
the main wool lines before making ready for the wheat-farmers
elsewhere. But in this matter railway construction, even within
each colony, was embarrassed by the guerilla warfare on the
Western front between squatter and free selector. The
wool-growers outbid the selectors for the freehold of land well
served by the railways, and soil-exhaustion made farmers restless
even where they did get land. Colonial treasurers, too, were only
too glad to see them given access to virgin land by the building
of more railways. These opened up the prospect of more land
"revenue". New South Wales could rely on a light revenue tariff
and do without an income tax until the middle 'nineties because
of the abundant money received from sales of Crown land. Twelve
millions, mainly from sales, figured as land revenue between 1876
and 1880.</p>
<p>Yet financial considerations cramped any grand style in
railway-building because low freights in proportion to cost of
service made the railways unproductive of net revenue.
Construction work had to wait upon supplies of capital borrowed
abroad. While the line over the Blue Mountains was being built,
the contractors were warned not to go too fast, lest the Treasury
should run out of funds with which to meet their claims. The
credit of the colonies in the London market was a plant of uneven
growth. It flourished well in the 'sixties, and Queensland and
Victoria built railways fast. Then came a check, not unconnected
with continued repudiation of debts in the states of the American
Union and with foolhardy railway contracts in the Near East.***
"It was a favourite maxim of the sixties", notes Coghlan, "that
what America had done Australia would do." The parallel did not
hold good, however, as regards the forms of security pledged.
Taught by bitter experience, the British investor who lent his
capital in America learned to prefer railway bonds charged on the
assets of a railway company rather than the bonds or debentures
of a state government. In his dealings with Australia he relied
upon government securities. The earliest loans to the colonial
governments had been raised by the sale of debentures redeemable
out of the land fund. Though in process of dissipation, the
public estates of the various colonies were very large and
tangible assets. Other specific revenues came under pledge for a
time, but an episode in Tasmania in the 'seventies suggested to
colonial railway-users that all loans for railway construction
should be made a charge on the whole of the borrowing colony's
assets. The lenders in London were nothing loth to accept the
wider security.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Leland Jenks, <i>Migration of British
Capital to</i> 1875 (1927), <i>passim</i>.]</p>
<p>A private company had undertaken in 1868 to construct and
operate a western railway from Launceston to Deloraine, the
Government guaranteeing interest on the cost. This was done at
the petition of the landowners along the line who agreed that, in
the event of the receipts failing to cover interest as well as
running expenses, the Government should find the guaranteed
interest by levying a special local rate upon them. The railway
receipts proved too small even to meet running expenses, but when
the Government took over the line and sought to collect from the
landowners a part of the sum they had contracted to pay, these
beneficiaries repudiated their contract. Circumstances alter
cases, they said The main railway from Hobart to Launceston had
in the meantime been made a charge on the general revenue. Why,
then, should the western line be an additional local burden?
Attempts to enforce payment of the rate by distraint of their
goods called out a violent resistance. "Griffin's horse", an
animal seized for non-payment of the rate, became a symbol of
defiance until in 1872 the Government abandoned the plan of local
assessment to meet local railway deficits.</p>
<p>Though Griffin's horse is now dead and forgotten, its
influence is still potent. For good or ill every project in
Australia involving substantial expense became thereafter "a
public work of national importance". The high horse which the
otherwise silent member rides when he demands of ministers a
proper recognition of his constituents' importance is really
Griffin's.</p>
<p>In the same decade, all the colonies followed New Zealand's
lead in the issue of inscribed stock, instead of debentures
chargeable on this or that source of revenue, and the British
Parliament in 1877 provided by a Colonial Stock Act for
inscription and transfer in the United Kingdom. Though not yet
listed as trustee securities*&mdash;a boon Colonial government
agents were already seeking&mdash;colonial stocks were thus made
familiar and easily handled "lines" on the London stock market,
the central source of loanable capital.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* They were not trustee securities until 1900,
when Joseph Chamberlain passed another Colonial Stock Act in
their favour. Thereafter, trustees might legally buy them as, in
effect, gilt-edged investments, and the savings of the British
middle-classes were at the disposal of Australian
treasurers.]</p>

<p>The honest broker who brought together the willing buyer and
the willing seller of colonial securities appeared in 1872 in the
person of Sir Hercules Robinson. As governor of New South Wales
from 1872 to 1879, he advocated at every opportunity a spirited,
public works policy. When he arrived, Australia had less than
1200 miles of railway, and nowhere did a line penetrate more than
180 miles from the coast. But the engineers had scaled the
mountain barrier behind Sydney. The true home of the pastoral
industry lay before the railheads; and, both in Victoria and New
South Wales, railway men and private brokers concerted plans for
the capture of the main wool traffic. Sir Hercules was ready to
urge a larger courage on lenders and borrowers alike.
Full-bearded audiences at the opening of railway extensions
roared applause when he told them "this country possesses almost
boundless natural resources which only require population to
develop them", and went into ecstasies over the moral he drew,
that ministers ought not to be satisfied with the construction of
less than fifty miles of railway in each year.*** Each colony in
turn enthusiastically drew up ambitious plans of railway and
other development works, to be financed by loan monies. From 1871
to 1875, eleven borrowed millions and a half were found for
public works.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** T. A. Coghlan, <i>Labour and industry in
Australia</i>, devotes an admirable chapter to the origins of
"vigorous public works policies". See pp. 1405 <i>et
seq</i>.]</p>
<p>Those who decided what railways were to be built and what
rivers to be bridged tried hard to limit the schedules to works
urgently needed. But what should be taken as the criterion of
urgency? Should it be the ability to meet the interest on costs
of construction? If this criterion had been abandoned on the
roads when the toll-bars were removed, why should it be applied
to the railways? As money grew cheaper, importunate members
mounted Griffin's horse in turn. Opening up the land ahead of
settlement was held to be the saving grace of Government
ownership of the railways. By the end of fifteen years of easy
money and political pressure, treasurers' ideas of urgent
necessity had been pushed so far ahead of population and
production that the recurring deficits on the railways troubled
even the optimists.* Always, however, came the reply that
increasing traffic was in sight, and that settlers were about to
fill the vast empty spaces.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Correspondence between the Minister of
Railways and the Railways Commissioners, <i>Victorian P.P</i>.
1891, ch. <small>XVI</small>.]</p>
<p>Public expenditure of loan funds far exceeded in the
'seventies direct private investment into Australia. Between 1871
and 1875 only a million and a half of private capital came to
augment the 33 millions already so invested. Between 1876 and
1880, however, depression ruled in Europe, and with it low rates
of interest. Investors at home were increasingly ready to put
their money, into land companies and other private Australian
ventures. During that quinquennium £11,600,000 came
privately to Australia in addition to the £22,000,000
borrowed by governments. New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland
and South Australia each took five millions on government
account. So far, so good. In the decade 1871 to 1880 inclusive,
2681 miles of railway were built, and the length of line open to
traffic was almost quadrupled. By 1881, telegraph lines, erected
mainly during the 'seventies, crossed 25,604 miles of country.
The stimulus to wool production was proved by the expansion of
the wool-clip from 211,413,000 pounds in the grease (1871) to
324,286,000 pounds (1881). The totals of shipping entered and
cleared at Australian ports, 3,690,000 tons in 1871 and 8,110,000
tons ten years later, were equally significant of expanding
trade.</p>
<p>Sir Hercules Robinson had urged that the "true policy" of a
young country was "to loosen every band that hampers industry, so
as to lessen the cost of production, to extend your markets, and
by making the country year by year a cheaper and cheaper place
for working men to live in, to attract them in numbers to your
shore". The leaders in each colony heard with prophetic ear the
tramp of millions who would soon people Australia. Population was
growing at a phenomenal speed. From 1,647,756 in 1870 it had
risen to nearly two and a quarter millions in 1880, an increase
of 35.4 per cent. in a decade, and even this was exceeded in the
'eighties.** If any among the leaders had paused in providing
railways, wharves, and water supplies for the oncoming hosts, the
days of his leadership would at once have ended.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The increase from 1880 to 1890 was 41.2 per
cent.]</p>
<p>As is usual when a new expedient of economic progress is first
tested commercially, practical men saw only its merits, and
speculative financiers egged them on. Pastoralists, putting back
into the purchase of freehold land almost the whole of their
profits and a big share of the new capital that banks and land
companies were bringing in, over-capitalized their runs, and then
over-stocked them in the effort to reduce their indebtedness. A
lucky run of seasons lured them out of their depth. Colonial
governments built railways for wheat-farmers who had not yet
solved the problem of permanent agriculture. The investing
public, both in Britain and Australia, little suspecting these
defects and growing foolhardy in land and mining speculation,
lost all regard for the practicable. Then an economic winter came
to check the general exuberance and to initiate a more varied and
more competent use of the land and its railways.</p>

<br>
The Land Boom</h3>
<br>
<p><small>NO</small> community lacks would-be leaders who confuse
city-streets, railway mileage and tall chimneys with
civilization, who mistake speculation for prosperity and
money-grabbing for the good life. Perhaps it was inevitable that
such men should dominate Victoria a generation after the
gold-rushes. They had dreamed of and achieved the transformation
of so many "canvas towns" into cities that it had become a part
of their character to look at finance and government with
contractors' eyes. "The whole real business of Australia is to
construct and strengthen the material frame upon which its future
greatness will depend." So Melbourne was telling the world * on
the very eve of its fall from the financial leadership of
Australia. But a material frame, however strongly constructed,
does not ensure the progress of an economic system. Government is
finance, and the major part of sound finance consists, not in
amassing money, so much as in directing a country's commerce so
that its industries incessantly reshape themselves to consumers'
needs, as consumers express them in market prices at home and
abroad.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Through Miss Flora Shaw, <i>The Times</i>
special correspondent, March 1893.]</p>
<p>The banks which had discounted the bills of merchants and
squatters at the capital-ports in pastoral days had a sharp
lesson in the danger of short cuts to fortune by
land-speculation, when the Bank of Australia and the Port Phillip
Bank failed during the "Bad Times". During the 'fifties, however,
ten millions' worth of gold flowed each year out of the
up-country gullies. Banks old and new pushed branches into the
mining areas to buy gold outright or to act as agents in
transferring it overseas. The new banks had not bought the
experience of the "Bad Times". The London Chartered Bank of
Australia, the Bank of Victoria, the English, Scottish and
Australian Chartered Bank, the Colonial Bank of Australasia and
the National Bank of Australasia were all founded in the
'fifties, and the Commercial Bank of Australia in 1866. Large
profits, easily made in the digging days, multiplied branches in
pursuit of a fluctuating business. Easy money bred an incautious
zeal to lend.</p>
<p>In pre-gold days, the Colonial Office had coached colonial
legislators in banking principles as understood in London. A
despatch by W. E. Gladstone to Sir Charles Fitzroy had stated the
limits which should be set on the dealings of banks by any laws
submitted for the royal assent.** These would have precluded
banks from advancing money on lands or houses or ships, or on
pledge of merchandise, from holding lands or houses save for the
transaction of their own business, and from engaging in trade,
save as dealers in bullion and in bills of exchange. Banking, as
London understood it, was an advance of rights to draw ready
money from the "bank" or consolidated purse of the shareholders
and depositors, given on the security of a right to a little more
money at a future date. The commercial bill of exchange, signed
by at least two solvent traders, was the ideal form of security
because it represented staple raw materials on their way to
market. In the worst times, such bills turn themselves into cash
by the sale of the goods. For men must eat and be clothed even
when merchant-bankers fail, stock-exchanges close their doors
and land is "cheap as stinking mackerel". The rule favouring
such bills is ideal, too, in keeping to the fore the banks' best
service to society. To the extent that they enforce repayment of
such advances, banks remind traders of their duty to meet the
market's "bread-and-butter" demands.</p>
<p class="foot">[** W.E. Gladstone to Sir Charles Fitzroy, 30 May
1846, <i>H.R. of A</i>. series <small>I</small>, vol.
<small>XXV</small>, pp. 74-5.]</p>
<p>When, however, the volume of Australian production changed
back from the bullion in which, as raw cash, they might deal, to
the "sheep and wool, cattle, hides and horns" in which they might
not deal, colonial bankers felt this orthodoxy of
bill-discounting to be a field too narrow for the employment of
their abundant gold-reserves. Colonial legislators, mainly
consisting of merchants and squatters, had already exacted from
their Mentors at home permission for banks to make advances on
wool and stock while still in the pastoralists' hands. Towards
the end of the 'sixties, the banks took a further step. They
dispensed with the bill of exchange drawn on a London
merchant-broker when financing pastoralists whose wool was on the
way to the sales. "The legislature", argued a prominent banker,
"has encouraged bankers by special enactment to advance money to
squatters on their current clips of wool. Surely the advance is
as safe when represented by a bill of lading and policy of
insurance as when on the backs of the sheep?" ***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Adam Burnes, General Manager of the Colonial
Bank, in a controversy with James McBain, a director who had
resigned rather than countenance the innovation. See
<i>Innovations in Colonial Banking Practice</i>, by C. M. S.
(Sydney 1869) (Mitchell Library Pamphlets).]</p>
<p>If, however, advances on wool and sheep were sound, why not
advances on land? Every squatter was eager to borrow enough
capital to buy his freehold and thus save his run from free
selectors. The way was made easy for the banks when in 1870 the
courts and the Privy Council decided that a bank might acquire,
hold and pass a good title to land or other property which fell
into its possession as the collateral security of an advance,
even though that acquisition were in violation of the bank
charter.* Bankers might persuade themselves that they had little
choice but to make such advances against land. How else could
they prevent the ruin of the industry that grew the golden
fleece? Yet such advances were bound to be based on speculative
values. Repayment depended on expectations of production coming
true, and values holding in years to come, not on goods already
produced and made the basis of short-term commercial bills.
Inevitably, advances on land were long-term credits that locked
up the banks' resources and thus lessened the power of the
community to adjust itself to changed circumstances. Nor did the
banks long confine the practice to pastoral lands. As the greater
pastoralists paid off mortgages, or transferred them to the
finance and mortgage companies which were ready to share in this
business, competition for openings in which to lay out loanable
funds led banks to make advances against the title-deeds of
farmers, small graziers and others. "This class of advances",
wrote an active Victorian banker in 1880, "has acquired an
importance to which what the conservative banker still calls
legitimate banking business bears a very diminutive relation."

<p class="foot">[** H. Gyles Turner, of the Commercial Bank of
Australia, "Victorian Banking considered in relation to National
Development", <i>Australian Insurance and Banking Record</i>, 8
December 1880.</p>
<p class="foot">According to its prospectus, <i>The Commercial
Bank of Australia Limited</i>, Melbourne 1866, was "projected
especially for the purpose of affording banking accommodation to
large and important classes whose claims for assistance entitle
them to a much larger share of credit than has hitherto been
afforded by the existing banking institutions, viz. the
manufacturers, small traders, farmers, vignerons and other
producers". This drew from Syme a typical diatribe in <i>The
Age</i> against the "foreign banks". "We send away to be expended
amongst strangers an annual aggregate amount of profit which
would suffice for the capital of one new bank per annum. . . .
The Commercial Bank of Australia aims at being the first of the
series. . . . It will possess all the privileges of the
incorporated Banks without the restrictions which harass them."
<i>The Argus</i> also welcomed, in its more urbane style,
advances to small producers on the security of title-deeds.]</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the total advances were "outside the current
discounts", he estimated; yet the results to bank-shareholders
fully condoned, in his opinion, this departure from English
practice&mdash;"unless it could be shown to be fraught with some
latent danger requiring only a hitherto undiscovered combination
of circumstances to develop". Nemesis had whispered as he
wrote.</p>
<p>Bankers and colonial publicists generally were agreed in
scouting any real possibility of danger. Banking, like
wool-growing and everything else, had to be adapted to Australian
circumstances. Land values in a young country rose so inevitably,
it was said, that a wide margin was assured and the banks' money
was abundantly safe. Transfer under the Torrens system was so
easy that a clean certificate of title was as negotiable a
security as government stock or a first-class trade bill. "At the
worst the land remained." Gyles Turner smugly ascribed
Australia's freedom from the bank disasters so frequent in
Britain to "the soundness of judgment and moderation of aim" of
the colonial bankers.</p>
<p>Cautious men wondered. London bankers knew well that the yield
of gold from California and Australia was falling, and that
monetary demands for the metal, especially for the new German
Empire, were looming large.* The value of gold was sure to rise
and therefore the general level of prices would fall, more goods
being needed to obtain a unit of gold. Australian exports, they
noted, had escaped the first impact of this fall in prices, being
necessaries of life. Perhaps more thorough occupation of the back
country would enable the pastoralists to maintain their incomes
on a falling wool market, but such increase of supplies "might
become a prospective danger if too largely relied on by the
producers". Even the most optimistic saw a risk of
over-capitalization through the pushing in of more British
capital by finance companies, and conceded that competing bank
branches in the country towns made for excessive lending.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* W. Purdy, <i>The City Life</i> (1876), p. 11.
This little book is the more significant because its author had
an intimate experience of Australian banking and finance.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** In 1880, England and Wales, according to
Gyles Turner, <i>loc. cit</i>., had a banking office for every
11,810 persons, Scotland had one for every 4031, and Victoria had
one for every 2760.]</p>
<p>For a time all continued well with Australian finance.
Artesian water assured the occupation of wide areas of mulga
country inland, and a long run of favourable seasons flattered
the hopes of continuous progress that are in the hearts of every
generation, but never come true. Men smiled at the thought of
financial crisis in a land which exported gold in bulk, and where
bank-reserves were normally equal to half the total of notes
circulating and deposits at call. In 1866, it was said, a New
South Wales Treasurer, Geoffrey Eager, had proposed a national
bank of issue, but had planned no more than a branch of the
Treasury printing paper money for government. In the remote
contingency of a panic such an issue might have afforded the aid
of legal tender notes wherewith to satisfy the scared, but it
carried the danger of political money, local depreciation and
dislocated exchanges. Such risks, and the threatened loss of
their own convenient note-issues, led the banks to oppose Eager's
plan and all later plans for an emergency issue. Colonial banks
went on competing for public favour, and David Syme approved.</p>
<p>Australia in the early 'eighties certainly presented a strong
contrast with Britain, in prospects as well, as in banking
methods. The price of wool was steady. The area under crop had
increased in the previous decade from 2,143,709 acres to
4,560,991. The problem of sending surplus meat to Europe had been
solved by the refrigerating engine. Good seasons had followed one
another as though droughts were no more. It seemed, too, a world
where the speculator might still "strike it rich". At Mount
Morgan in Queensland a veritable hill of gold was found in 1882.
It was known to contain millions of ounces of the metal.* A year
later, another of silver, lead and zinc was found near the South
Australian border of New South Wales.** Australia was still the
speculator's El Dorado. The gold yield, it was true, had fallen
to half what it had been in 1861, but the world wanted gold so
much that each ounce bought more imports, and, as costs fell,
mining prospects bettered.***</p>
<p class="foot">[* Up to its closing in September 1925, the Mount
Morgan Mine treated 9,196,605 tons of ore, containing 5,303,979
oz. of gold and 139,427 tons of copper. It had paid
£9,379,166 in dividends. See its Annual Reports, 1886-1923,
and Rees Jones' Gold-Mining in Central Queensland (1913).]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Up to 1924 the value of. Broken Hill's

1885 (Adelaide Public Library).]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** See T. A. Coghlan, <i>Seven Colonies of
Australasia</i> (1902), p. 944 for the gold yields per annum from
1851 to 1901.]</p>
<p>So, too, with the other staple industries. Manufactures
overseas fell more rapidly in value after 1873 than did raw
materials. Competing industrialists in Britain and Germany cut
their prices, and for a time sold at finer margins rather than
lose their footing in the world's market. For the time being,
colonial populations bartered their goods for those of Europe at
an increasing advantage.</p>
<p>British investors seeking this attractive distant field paid
attention first to New South Wales and the main pastoral
industry. Private investment in Australia between 1876 and 1880
amounted to £11,600,000, and of these some eight millions
went into the mother colony as deposits or share-capital for
banks or land and finance companies. There all financial channels
led to the stations. With the new money, squatters bought,
fenced, watered and improved their runs. Their purchases swelled
the government revenues from land. Improvements and added
production kept the railways busy. New South Wales treated
£12,000,000 from land sales and rentals as revenue during
that quinquennium. Victoria drew an abundant customs revenue from
an equally temporary source. To transfer to its Melbourne
Treasury the money it borrowed in London over and above interest
due there, the Victorian Government or its bankers sold drafts on
London to Melbourne merchants wishing to pay in Britain for
imports thence. Such liberal offers of money-in-London, and the
certainty that the local money they gave for it would quickly be
set spinning again in Victoria as loan expenditure, greatly
heartened importers. On their big imports the Government
collected the usual duties. Active borrowing thus lent an
appearance of abundant strength to the colony's public budget.
This in turn was the justification of more borrowing to meet
growing public needs. "Development" was the blessed word, and
between 1881 and 1885 British investors lent at low rates of
interest thirty-seven and a half millions to the four larger
colonies. Privately, it is estimated, they put thirty millions
more into Australia.</p>
<p>Colonial Premiers and Treasurers felt much concern over the
responsibility of spending wisely their share of this money. In a
young country with centralized habits of development, log-rolling
for the favour of a line in the loan estimates was inevitable.
The first Victorian Parliament brought it on itself when it
approved of railway construction by Government on the ground that
Government was best qualified to decide in what directions
settlement should be promoted. But after thirty years Parliament
was not so sure of that. To a legislature sick of the scandals
associated with railways and public works during the
O'Loghlen-Bent regime, the Service-Berry ministry proposed that
decisions about new construction should be delegated to experts.
Parliament heartily agreed. Richard Speight, from the staff of
the English Midland Railway Company, was given a high salary to
preside over a Railway Commission of three. They were appointed
for seven years and were instructed to work the Victorian
railways at a profit, but at the lowest fares and freights
consistent with a profit, and with development.</p>
<p>The measure establishing the Railway Commission did not give
the new experts a free hand in making the rates at which goods
and passengers would be carried. The Commissioners could only
alter the by-laws and regulations fixing fares and general rates
of traffic if the Ministry of the day concurred. Public opinion
in a democratic colony would not tolerate on publicly owned
railways the apparent favouritism of "charging what the traffic
will bear" when this took the form of specially low freights to
particular stations. On the other hand, in the name of
Development, public opinion did demand low freights that would
build up the traffic on all lines. In the long run little is
gained by the benevolence which government railways have been
required to show in charging freights and fares lower than those
needed to balance the railway budget. Duncan Gillies claimed that
the state had always in view a higher object than profit, viz.,
to enable country settlers to market their produce at reasonable
cost. "Reasonable" rates, however, mean that in years of lean
traffic the Treasurer must meet the railway deficit out of
consolidated revenue or fund it, and years of deficit proved far
more frequent in Victoria than years of prosperous development.
By the end of the century, the Victorian railways had accumulated
losses of nine millions. And as a government cannot write off its
losses of capital which it owes mainly to external investors,
benevolence to country settlers resulted in dead-weight burdens
on the general budget. The full cost of railway transport must be
paid, either by the class served, by the taxpayers at the time,
or at compound interest by posterity. To spread the cost over a
long period in the name of constructive benevolence is to dull
the instrument of financial criticism by which a well-ordered
community locates and analyses its weak services. Worse still, it
may tempt posterity to the all-shattering risk of
repudiation.</p>
<p>Speight and his colleagues, though they were prevented from
rate-making along constructive lines, and were not altogether
free in matters of personnel, did manage to break the long series
of railway deficits, mainly by limiting political interference in
the engagement of employees. Yet their success was not a clear
gain. Log-rolling about new construction only shifted from the
lobbies of Parliament House to the corridors of the
Commissioners' Office at the opposite end of the city. And the
railway surplus was too well boomed as evidence of the colony's
ability to absorb more British loans for railway-building.</p>
<p>Sir Henry Parkes in 1887 adopted a better plan to place the
New South Wales railways above the pettifogging "local members".
Not content with the form of independent management by a
Commission, he made it a reality by becoming the parliamentary
spokesman of the Commissioners and defending their independence
even against his colleagues in the ministry. This won for them
power to shape the book of rates on lines nearer to sound railway
practice. Contrary to the Victorian plan, he refused to load his
Commissioners with decisions about new lines. He foresaw the
disrepute into which their helplessness to withstand the
politicians was to lead Speight and his colleagues, and set up a
standing committee of both Houses to deliberate on all works
involving a cost of more than £20,000. By this means,
reminiscent of private bill procedure at Westminster, he used
publicity and delay to check the insidious log-roller, but left
on cabinet and Parliament the ultimate responsibility for the
spending of public money.*</p>

<i>N.S.W. Parl. Deb</i>. 1887-8, p. 805, an account by William
Lyne, a recognized authority on the matter.]</p>
<p>Possibly such well-meant policies encouraged home investors in
their taste for Australian securities. In the period 1886-1890
their lending certainly placed another hundred millions at the
colonists' disposal, through public and private channels.**</p>

<p>But by this time drought had returned. Only Victoria escaped
its ravages, and the population there, which numbered a million
souls for the first time in 1887, was given the disposal of half
the plethora of loaned money. In South Australia, where the
drought was most prolonged, it brought to light dishonest
speculation in pastoral land by managing officials of the
Commercial Bank of South Australia. The Bank suspended payment in
February 1886. Almost simultaneously wool dropped in price to
9¼<i>d</i>. a pound from the 12¼<i>d</i>. which had
ruled for a full decade. Apprehension damped down incipient
land-booms in the cities and suburbs of Sydney and Adelaide, but
not in Melbourne, then the financial centre of Australia. The
countryside was flourishing; the city was agog with excitement
over Mount Morgan and Broken Hill mining shares. What was this
talk of a scarcity of the precious metals and falling prices? Who
could doubt the ability of debtors to meet their future
obligations in a country of unlimited potentialities?</p>
<p>Bank advances of all kinds had reached a total of 58½
millions in 1880. By 1891 the banks had on balance lent another
73½ millions and the total of advances was 132 millions.
Australian deposits, however, had only grown from 62½
millions to 93 millions. The extra loanable funds had been
obtained by accepting, or rather, canvassing for British money on
fixed deposit for one, two or three years. Before 1880 such
deposits had been rare. By 1891 Australian banks held just under
40 millions of them. Insidiously, too, the drought had stopped
the repayment of pastoralists' overdrafts, and low wool-values
threatened to cause their growth. Banks and finance companies
looked to quick profits in the city of Melbourne to provide them
with dividends. Gyles Turner's criterion of sound banking would
perhaps justify this business too. For a time advances on city
land and on stocks and shares showed amazing profits. Wool
prices, too, rallied in 1887, and Melbourne financiers ignored
the changing equation of trade and the mortgage over their gold
reserves which their acceptance of overseas deposits had given to
British investors. Millions of borrowed money were profit-hunting
in their city, and an inexperienced generation of land-banks
played without scruple the exciting game of unlimited gambling on
land-values.</p>
<p>Several factors helped on the land boom. During the
'seventies, a rise of wages had started in the pastoral industry
of New South Wales under the stimuli of lessened transport costs,
heavy expenditure on fencing and dam sinking, and good prices for
wool and stock. Then in the 'eighties, Melbourne had to be
rebuilt on lines in keeping with her wealth. As the phase of
prosperity and capital improvement passed in New South Wales,
workers poured into Melbourne. The net immigration to Victoria
for 1886 was 18,007, for 1887 some 14,721 and for 1888 no less
than 35,385. The spending of loan money on railways and other
public works maintained and increased the level of wages. A
strong demand arose for suburban houses on time-payment. Building
societies purchased and subdivided suburban estates. The building
trades could not get enough labour, and wages went on rising. To
the end of 1887 banks financed building by advances against title
deeds. At last they saw that speculation had pushed land values
too high. "What goes up must come down." They refused further
advances on real estate. Thereupon, building societies bid
against them for local deposits and followed them to England in
canvassing for more. Nor did the societies care about such
elementary precautions as dovetailing their obligations to repay
depositors into their clients' contracts and probable abilities
to repay them.* "At the worst the land remained."</p>
<p class="foot">[* Cf. T. A. Coghlan, <i>Labour and Industry in
Australia</i>, pp. 1680 <i>et seq</i>.]</p>
<p>The bubble reached its iridescence in 1888, the centenary of
Australia's colonization. Its most sensational phases were the
speculative dealings of the big men in city land and in mining
and "investment" shares. During a phase of depression in 1879,
patriotic citizens of "marvellous Melbourne" had been encouraged
to plot the curve of its future progress by an article in the
<i>Melbourne Review</i> from the pen of David Syme himself.** His
authentic figures of the increase in city land-values, though
intended as arguments for more taxation, were interpreted as a
prophecy of continued expansion. Syme predicted explicitly that
"country land, which is at a low price now (1879) owing to the
extraordinary facilities which exist for acquiring it, will go up
with a bound as soon as there is the slightest check to the
supply, which will be long before the last acre has passed into
private hands". As the country prospered, men argued, the city to
and from which all its business radiated must grow in equal
measure. The City of Melbourne had an area of 410 acres, and
when, during the 'eighties, millions of money were seeking
investment in. Victoria, and millions more were being spent close
to Melbourne on railway construction, new wharves and a
cable-tramway system, David Syme's prophetic vision was held to
have been abundantly justified. After 1884 prices paid for city
land became prophetic too. They had lost any link with the
rentals that could be paid for the present use of the land. Early
in the boom, James Mirams caused general astonishment by giving
£700 a foot for a block at the corner of Elizabeth and
Collins Streets. During its height the same land was sold to the
Equitable Insurance Company for £2300 a foot. "In 1887 you
could not have bought a property in Collins Street at any price
without being hunted next day by someone offering you a profit on
your bargain." ***</p>

<p>The activity on the Stock Exchange, started by the scramble
for Broken Hill and Mount Morgan shares and by more dubious
operations in land companies' scrip, may be gauged by the volume
of cheques and bills passing through the clearing house. This
rose from £3,600,000 a week in 1887 to almost
£6,000,000 a week in 1888. In the early months of the year,
brokers' offices were working all night to cope with the business
in silver-mining shares. Broken Hill Proprietary shares, which
were at £176 when the year opened, reached £397 in
March. They fell back to £240 after Easter, but the mine
was a wonderful producer, and though the "bears" might check
excessive optimism, its output justified high prices. It is
impossible, however, to "bear" a land boom by selling f.a.q. land
for future delivery. Land is too individual a commodity for sale
by grade or description. Buyers would contract to pay any price
for city land because nobody intended to pay for his purchase in
full until he had re-sold at a higher figure.</p>
<p>As the town population grew dubious of the prices they were
asked to pay and wary of risking their past gains, "boomsters"
sought in the provincial cities and country towns for fresh
counters in the game.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The writer was interrupted at this point (in
August 1929) by an emissary of a Melbourne land firm, seeking to
sell him a block of land in a riverside suburb of Perth, Western
Australia, within sight of his study windows.]</p>
<p>The banks had started this wonderful game when, about 1881,
they allowed city land as security for considerable advances.
Their old business of lending on pastoral land had become cramped
by new land and mortgage companies. But before a decade was out,
they were puzzled by the problem of stopping the inflation of
city values. When at the close of 1887 they refused further
advances on land, the ball was in play and they merely left the
field. Others played on and the crowd still cheered. British
money was eagerly seeking investment in Australia, and the
decline in pastoral prospects piled up deposits unused. A
disagreement among the Associated Banks ** postponed a raising of
the rates of interest for fixed deposits which was intended to
retain the surplus in their keeping and to prevent its misuse by
others. An amendment of the Victorian Banking Act (1864), passed
in 1887 and assented to a year later, removed any legal doubts
that "any incorporated banking company" might "advance money on
land, houses, ships and merchandise".*** The land companies
thereupon stepped into the place vacated by the Associated Banks,
assumed the style and title of banks, and by a competitive
canvass for deposits prolonged the land boom for two years after
its insanity had become common knowledge in Australia.**** While
the London rate of interest was low&mdash;this was the period of
Goschen's conversion of Consols to 2¾ per cent.&mdash;the
land-banks decked themselves with London Boards, on which
ex-Governors, ex-Premiers and Agents-General contrived to look
reassuring to British depositors, while substantial commissions
for their collections enlisted the good offices of English and
Scots lawyers.</p>

<p class="foot">[*** T. A. Coghlan, <i>Labour and Industry in

was enacted as section 6 in Vic. Statute No 1002.]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** Cf. <i>The Age</i> and <i>The Insurance and
Banking Record</i> on the failure of the Premier Building
Association in December 1889.]</p>
<p>The money market hardened in 1889. The land-banks went gaily
on, giving five per cent. for money at call in Australia. No
scruples troubled or cramped their use of money. They lent to
speculative builders up to the full "estimated value" of their
buildings and land. They advanced money to purchasers on the
security of land they had themselves "sold". They declared
dividends out of profits calculated by assuming all the land
subdivided to have become worth the prices paid or promised for a
few blocks. "Free conveyances carried people to the sales,
champagne lunches gave them courage to bid, and extraordinary
terms of credit reconciled them to their purchases." * For any
whose eyes still saw, the bubbles had all burst when on December
20, 1889 the Premier Permanent Building Association of Melbourne
suspended payment. Liquidation showed up the most irresponsible
management. Yet for nearly three years more the borrowing from
Britain continued, on both private and public account. The
Associated Banks trembled to assist the land-banks and building
societies. Land was fast becoming unsaleable. Thousands of houses
built at boom costs were being left without tenants. Emigration
from Victoria started in 1891-2. "These cancerous growths", as
the London <i>Economist</i> ** called the land-banks, had no
realizable assets whatever to set against huge liabilities.
Barings failed in London. Wool prices slumped lower and lower, to
9<i>d</i>. a pound in 1890, 8<i>d</i>. in 1891 and
7¾<i>d</i>. in 1892. Strikes stopped trade and industry on
an unprecedented scale. The game was up; the whole fabric of
Australian credit shook.</p>
<p class="foot">[* T. A. Coghlan, <i>Labour and Industry in
Australia</i>, p. 1693.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>The Economist</i>, 12 September 1891.]</p>
<p>The optimists still ruled, however. Parliament was their last
refuge. The outstanding fact that Australia had received between
1880 and 1890 more British capital than she could use in
producing wealth did not deter the colonial governments. They
tried busily to paper over the cracks by raising more loans. The
Gillies-Deakin Government in Victoria spent £4,400,000 in
1889 on public works and another £5,000,000 in 1890. In
1891 the Munro Government was only stopped by London's reluctance
to find more money, even at higher rates of interest. In April,
Munro wanted another £3,000,000, but the public only
subscribed £1,800,000. When Barings trembled in November
1890, William Westgarth &amp; Company, a small house which held
large amounts of recent Victorian issues, fell headlong, and the
sale of its holdings lowered the price of all Australian stocks.
Queensland, whose public debt had been swollen by
£16,212,000 during the decade 1881 to 1890, mainly by
London flotations, sought in May of 1891 a further
£2,500,000 at £94. The public offered only
£300,000, and the remainder could only be sold to banks and
financial houses at £88. New South Wales, though provided
with abundant money by the sale of public lands, had added
£36,000,000 to her debt by borrowing in Sydney and London
between 1881 and 1890. The vicious circle of government deposits
of land revenues, and bank advances out of these to private
clients for the purchase of more land had, as in 1841-3, produced
a furious boom, but drought in 1884-5 and again in 1888 saved
Sydney from the worst excesses of Melbourne. She had not become a
magnet for her neighbours' workpeople. Failure of land companies
and building societies did, however, spread unemployment there,
and in September of 1891 her Treasurer sought a fresh loan of
£4,500,000 in London. He could obtain only
£2,500,000, and at the close of the year his successor was
seeking with poor success to sell there Treasury bills which he
was unable to place in Sydney. South Australia, whence population
and capital had for a time flowed to Melbourne, decided in
February of 1891 to meet increasing unemployment by public works,
and sought a loan of a million and a quarter in London. Only a
third was subscribed, and though the balance was obtained, the
loan was the last of South Australia's external borrowings for
the century.</p>
<p>The revelations of fraud which came with the crash of each
land-bank, and London's discovery of similar doings in the
similar country of Argentina, created a critical atmosphere. More
decisive in sapping Australian credit was the falling value of
staple colonial products. The increase of their flocks and herds
in the early 'nineties brought little power to station-owners to
pay their interest and repay bank advances. Wool fell in 1893 to
7<i>d</i>. a pound and bullocks which had been worth £5 a
head in 1884 to £2. 10<i>s</i>. Land, after all, was not
such a good basis to bank upon. Mining shares were not much
better. Copper from Yorke's Peninsula (S.A.), worth £94 a
ton in 1873 and £59 in 1884, was down to £44 in 1886.
A ring of European speculators had lifted it to £99 in
September 1888, but they burned their fingers and the price was
down to £35 a ton in March 1889, from which it recovered
with painful slowness. Silver had been at 4<i>s</i>.
3½<i>d</i>. an ounce when Charles Rasp, a station-hand,
found Broken Hill in 1883. In 1889 it was down to 3<i>s</i>.
5½<i>d</i>. Then the American and Indian mints closed to
its free coinage and its value fell to 2<i>s</i>.
11¼<i>d</i>. in 1893. The new prices afforded scanty
prospects of meeting old commitments. When the net profit to be
made in the primary industries threatened to disappear, losses
had to be cut, costs reduced and capital values calculated
afresh. In his struggle to pay interest and reduce his overdraft,
many a pastoralist, with the rabbits' aid, ruined his tender
out-back country by overstocking, and further depressed an
already weak market by bringing to it a bigger clip. After 1889,
stations came in large numbers into the possession of the banks.
New men had to be found, or old owners employed in new
capacities, to manage re-valued properties on costs consistent
with lower prices.</p>
<p>The bankers and public financiers of Australia had failed in
their main duty. They had forgotten, if indeed they had ever
realized, that an economy, to be sound, must maintain in
equipoise its material equipment and the production this exists
to aid, that capital values have no meaning apart from actual net
income. Income is by no means a hardy annual "aye growing" while
financiers sit tight. The borrowed funds for which too many
banks strove to find room had inflated the capital values against
which, very dangerously, Australian bankers thought it good
business to lend. Much had been consumed in extravagant living.
Receipts from sales of land, easy customs revenue on luxury
imports, still easier borrowings abroad had made governments as
reckless employers as the land-booming builders. Then prices and
employment on high wages sagged together. Public employment
vanished. On the rank and file of private employers in the export
industries fell the thankless task of reshaping their expenses in
harmony with the world's markets. Their calling was to maintain
production. They could not do so at wages which gave labour a
share calculated on the vanished values of the joint product. But
at this point, a new intercolonial federation of trade unions
sharply challenged the right of employers, even of federated
employers, to dictate labour's share.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<br>
Labour Shows Fight</h3>
<br>
<p><small>AS</small> there were wicket-keepers before Blackham,
so there were labour unions before the gold discoveries. Convict
artisans and labourers had, without unions and through sheer
scarcity of man-power, even enjoyed an active government's pay
and conditions when Macquarie was building to Greenway's plans,*
though not for long. "The loose and easy times of Macquarie gave
way to theories of adamant." The convicts, scattered and weak in
bargaining against the squatters, were downtrodden as shepherds
and hut-keepers. Expiree mechanics about Sydney, though burning
with resentment for past wrongs in Britain and Ireland and in the
colony itself, had not the quality of mutual loyalty. The system
had broken them. Its centralization and brutality had killed
initiative in its human tools. Hence the first essays in labour
organization "centre round the more arresting figures of the
newly arrived immigrant. What the emancipist lacked in direction
and management the emigrant who had braved so great dangers was
able to supply. Movement, direction and decision were his
contributions, but the peculiar form and colour had long ago been
set in convict moulds".**</p>
<p class="foot">[* See L. M. Thomas "The Development of the
Labour Movement 1788-1848", an unpublished work in the Fisher
Library, Sydney University, p. 10: "The convict labourer combined
the functions of serf and freeman within a curious economic frame
. . . Government regulation (of wages etc.) proved ineffective
because of the scarcity of labour. A natural monopoly exacted its
own price of regular hours, government tasks and a wage
system".]</p>
<p class="foot">[** L. M. Thomas, <i>op. cit</i>. p. 15. Cf. p.
13: "For the germ of the labour movement we do not look to the
freeman but to the government convict, particularly to the
mechanic with his regular hours, his definite wages and his
economic worth".]</p>
<p>Of the unions and benefit-societies formed in the 'thirties
and 'forties, whose records Miss Thomas has faithfully conned,
some may have had a continuous life into the golden age. They,
and the post-gold societies of typographers, cabinet-makers,
shipwrights and engineers, were all copies, and some were
offshoots, of British craft-unions.* The first Australian branch
of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers was formed in 1852 on the
good ship 'Frances Walker', outward bound. But as long as dreams
came true and men escaped to independence through luck at the
diggings or success with a free selection, wages necessarily
ruled high. Unions might swell into prominence in resisting the
importation of Chinese labour, in concerting a demand for an
eight hours day or in resisting some daring oppression by
employers.** When the aim of the moment was achieved they would
dwindle again into "aristocracies of labour" concerned mainly
with sickness and accident benefits to their members in the
capital towns. In relatively few trades was there a sufficiently
stable body of fellow-crafts to maintain continuity.</p>

<p>When capital reorganized mining on a wage-earning basis, a
unionism native to the country began to stir. The transition form
appeared successively on the Newcastle coalfield in New South
Wales and in the consolidated gold mines around Bendigo and
Ballarat. The Hunter River District *** Miners Mutual Protective
Association was formed in 1861. A sliding scale of wages varying
with the price of coal was exacted by a stoppage of work in
August 1872 and occasioned an early "vend" among the Newcastle
colliery proprietors. In 1874 the Amalgamated Miners' Association
was formed at an intercolonial conference of gold, silver, copper
and coal miners held at Bendigo. Its founder, W. G. Spence,
sought to bring all miners into a federal union which could
arrange financial aid to any in need, but would leave each
colonial district self-governing in its own area. For a time he
succeeded, and the A.M.A. numbered 23,500 members, but its
intercolonial council broke to pieces when in the late 'eighties
Spence turned his remarkable talent for organization to a greater
task. Till the century's close the loosely associated
craft-unions among the miners paid most attention to
accident-benefits, essential to maintain their membership before
the days of workers' compensation. Latterly they have joined with
the other unions in common political action, though still proudly
given to direct industrial action.****</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Concerning this richly endowed district
which has contributed greatly to the economic achievement of
Australia, yet far beneath its power, which produces wealth by
pasture, agriculture, dairying, fruit-growing, wine, coal, iron
and steel, see F. R. E. Mauldon, <i>The Hunter River Valley</i>
(1927).]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** In the mid-colonial period they exerted
strong pressure on the legislatures for effective laws governing
the inspection of mines and machinery, beginning from a Victorian
Act in 1877.]</p>
<p>Many of the younger miners and miners' sons went shearing in
New South Wales and Queensland from August to December. Some
followed the shearing almost all the year round from the Gulf to
Warrnambool. One of these poured out their grievances to Spence
and besought him to form a shearers' union to fight the unfair
tactics of the squatters and win decent conditions for these
migratory piece-workers. Spence accepted the call. When he opened
the books of the Amalgamated Shearers Union at 30 Armstrong
Street, North Ballarat, on 3 June 1886, the foundation was laid
of what was to become the central pillar of the Australian Labour
temple.</p>
<p>The pastoralists had announced a cut of half-a-crown a hundred
in the rate for shearing sheep. The union answered by enrolling
9000 members in six months throughout Victoria, New South Wales,
South Australia and New Zealand. Until 1904 Queensland had its
own Shearers' Union. Then its shearers joined the A.W.U. or
Australian Workers' Union, the name which the original body,
adopted in 1894 with a proper discernment of its native quality
and a fine disregard of demarcations between crafts and colonies.
Under Spence's leading, the union, while providing "benefits",
relied rather on the power of ideas than of money, and spent
freely on the education of its members in "union principles". Its
main aim was to shape an agreement or contract excluding unfair
practices, and to make this contract the universal rule between
squatter and shearers. It objected to (i) "the second price", a
right which squatters had hitherto reserved of paying at a
reduced rate for all the sheep a shearer had shorn if any were
badly shorn, cut or otherwise injured; (ii) the rule that
shearers must buy food and other requirements at the
station-store where often the tradition of the officer-traders of
early Sydney still lingered; (iii) the common "men's hut" in
which bunks, cook's oven and meal-table made an unsavoury
jumble.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* The men's but was usually a long, draughty,
slab building without windows. Two and sometimes three tiers of
bunks would occupy the sides, and from them came a nauseating
stench of clothing saturated with "yolk" from the wool and
perspiration. The table for meals ran down the centre. Cooking
was conducted partly in the open, partly at an oven in the
fireplace across one end of the hut. The men were often expected
to make their own sanitary arrangements. Typhoid was an
ever-present risk in the shearer's life.]</p>
<p>In the campaign for better days the union enlisted men in
press-gang style. On the eve of the date set for shearing to
begin, a union "organizer" would gather the shearers, most of
whom had come to fill a "stand" bespoken a year before, would fan
their indignation over the rumoured cut in the rate and propose a
resolution that they should stand together for "union terms". If
the pastoralist, forced by the falling price of wool to cut his
costs, insisted on the wages-cut, and ordered the organizer off
the run, the unionists went with him, but not far. Probably the
organizer had picked out a waterhole nearby which had been
proclaimed a reserve for travelling stock by a friendly
government, in the days, when the squatter's father was fighting
free selectors. There the unionists' camp was the scene of
frequent "revival-meetings" in which a new religion of mateship
was feelingly unfolded to the bushmen. The prelude to conversion
was often conviction of sin&mdash;the deadliest sin of
"scabbing". "The man who fell once may be forgiven", Spence
ruled, "but he is not fully trusted. The lowest term of reproach
is to call a man a 'scab'." To avoid that black pit the only way
was to join the union at once and to stand firm always. Force was
unhesitatingly used, however, to persuade the mulish. The men's
hut would be rushed under cover of darkness, and if the squatter
sought the release of "his men" from the union camp he learnt
from their own lips that they had gone there voluntarily. Many
thus enlisted remained true to union principles. According to the
founder, the union practised a form of "dipping", being "great
believers in immersion as a cure for 'scab'.</p>
<p>Such guerilla warfare brought the agreement for union rules
into operation far and wide during 1887 and 1888. The Masters and
Servants Acts ** were often invoked, and prosecutions for assault
were not infrequent. But the speed of Spence's success had caught
the squatters in disarray. Often the drying of the grass enforced
acceptance of the new contract or the old rate. For grass seeds
in the wool may mean "carbonizing" wool only and low
prices. They may work into and kill the sheep. In a time
of booming employment in the towns, imprisonment of the most
skilled shearers was an economic blunder. The "ringer" was often
as good a unionist as he was shearer.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See L. M. Thomas, "The Development of the
Labour Movement, 1788-1848", ch. <small>V</small>.]</p>
<p>Over the Queensland border the fires of union enthusiasm were
blown to greater heat by an immigrant journalist breathing
"socialism in our time". William Lane called for new and
revolutionary unions which should federate to win this goal. He
was a Bristol man who, after a grammar school education, had
found his vocation in Canada and the United States. At twenty-two
he reached Brisbane (1883) and had soon attracted a following by
articles on labour problems in The Brisbane Courier and in a
paper of his own, The Boomerang. In March 1890, he established
The Queensland Worker to propound the doctrines of Karl Marx,
Bellamy and Henry George, and to be the mouthpiece of the
Australian Labour Federation. This was his masterpiece. The
ferments of socialist criticism of private enterprise and of
union action to mend wages and working conditions were just as
active and sporadic in Australia during the 'eighties as in
England. Lane added to youthful visions the task of linking the
two movements so that they should pursue a socialist objective
with union discipline and power. He had formed out of the
Queensland unions in 1885 a Trades and Labour Council of the type
that arose easily out of craft-unionism in each capital city; but
it lacked power to control piecemeal striking. These spurts only
alarmed employers and spent union resources on bread and
butter.</p>
<p>Lane wanted a more compact federation which would gather into
a disciplined movement the semi-skilled and labourers as well as
craftsmen. During 1889 a busy consolidation movement knit
together the shearers, the maritime workers and the building
trades of Queensland into minor federations, and on II June of
that year the Australian Labour Federation, which Lane had
advocated, began its existence at the Maritime Labour Hall,
Brisbane. Its first adherents were the city craft and waterside
unions, but the shearers soon joined. Their aid was vital, for
the migratory station labour made contacts with other
wage-earners throughout Eastern Australia and spread Lane's
enthusiasm for united action wherever they went.</p>
<p>Queensland shearers were even more drastic in their
proselytizing methods than their comrades in the South, and after
two seasons of divided counsels and detailed coercion the
pastoralists of all the colonies realized that only common action
could meet the religion of which Lane had become the prophet. The
heaven it offered to the faithful at no distant date, control of
the means of production and exchange by the organized
proletariat, had in it no place for them. In August 1889 the
London "dockers" won their "tanner" after a world famous fight in
which the Australian unions' contribution of £30,000 played
a material part. That gift accentuated the tension which Lane's
hot-gospelling had caused in relations between employers and
workers throughout Australia. Henry George himself came to Sydney
late in 1889 preaching the Single Tax against all land
monopolists. An ardent worshipper * introduced him to the
Australian people with the cry "Ecce Homo!" His presence
aggravated the itch of rival devotees to tear apart and re-shape
according to their creeds an economy plainly working amiss.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Charles Garland, M.L.A., President of the New
South Wales Single Tax League.]</p>
<p>Eighteen-ninety opened with the economic barometer low and
falling fast. Wool was down. Money was dear in London. The
Australian banks were pressing for repayment of over-drafts.
Unemployment was increasing and there was talk of public works
shutting down for lack of loan money. Lane, through the Worker,
to which Queensland wages-men became conscript subscribers on
paying their union dues, was advocating a "slate", or labour
charter of concessions, in return for which employers would be
promised industrial peace for two years. But was it likely that
his followers, once they had tasted such success, would rest
content? Could the prophet of "socialism in our time" hold them
back? Employers, and especially the pastoralists, on whom falling
wool prices weighed heavily, did not care to wait on united
Labour's pleasure. The Queensland shearers decided to shut every
"scab" out of the wool-sheds. At Jondaryan Station the sheep were
shorn by non-unionists, as all the countryside knew, and the
wool, declared "black" by the unions, was forwarded to Brisbane.
The waterside workers or "wharf-lumpers" refused to load it into
the ship. W. G. Spence went north and stopped an upheaval for
which the employers were evidently ready. An indemnity for the
delay of their vessel was paid to the British India Company. In
the southern colonies the diplomatic Spence and his Amalgamated
Shearers were content to do their own recruiting and sought from
the pastoralists a collective bargain of "no shearing save under
union conditions". Negotiations were proceeding on a basis
promising continuous and peaceful adjustment of the price and
conditions of shearing when suddenly a fresh storm broke into
fury at the southern ports.</p>
<p>On the intercolonial steamers a Marine Officers Association
had applied for higher pay and better conditions aboard ship.
Receiving scant attention, their Melbourne branch announced that
it had joined the other maritime unions in affiliating with the
Trades Hall. The shipowners raised objection to such a bond
between officers and seamen. It was likely to undermine
discipline, to the peril of ships at sea. At Port Adelaide on 15
August 1890 the ships' officers gave the shipowners the choice
between recognizing the affiliation with the Maritime Labour
Council or their own abandonment of the ships after a day's
notice. It was a challenge. The employers took it up. Both sides
made public preparation for a general battle between their
organized forces. A union conference in session at Sydney adopted
the name of "Labour Defence Committee". Early in September a
"Pan-Australian Conference of Employers" also met in Sydney. It
announced a "right to freedom of contract between employers and
men", a "determination to oppose the use of force and boycotting"
and the employers' "intention to retain labour engaged during the
strike".</p>
<p>The dispute raised the very first issue of unionism, the right
of men to form a union and to join one union with another in
mutual support. It had at once involved every maritime calling
but one, and paralysed every port. The exception was an important
body&mdash;the marine engineers. Picketing and riots in both
Sydney and Melbourne could not prevent the manning, loading and
discharging of ships so long as the engineers stuck to their
posts. And there was an abundance of non-union labour to be had
among the hosts of unemployed. The colonial governments provided
fully adequate police protection. When the Newcastle coal-miners
tried to stop the ships by refusing to coal those manned by
non-unionists, they were themselves locked out. On 19 September,
a clash on Circular Quay, Sydney, between strike-pickets and
wool-carters recruited from station-owners and others of the
directing class, ended in the reading of the Riot Act and a
charge by mounted troopers. Desperate at the increasing activity
along the wharves, the Labour Defence Committee tried to bring
trade to a stop by calling out the shearers. The telegrams went
out to every wool-shed at work on 24 September, and sixteen
thousand shearers, ignoring the squatters' threats to forfeit
their wages and sue them for breach of contract, answered the
union call to down tools.</p>
<p>At once it was seen by both sides that by that call the union
leaders had over-taxed their resources. The main source of funds
that had maintained the waterside and maritime strikers vanished.
The shearers were involved in fines for offences against the
Masters and Servants Act. They had lost the wages due to them.
When the Mayor of Sydney made a fresh offer of mediation, the
employers stipulated that the shearers must be sent back to the
sheds. The Labour leaders, in complying on 2 October, were
palpably weakening. On the following day the employers again
refused the proposed conference unless the "freedom of contract"
for which they were fighting were first accepted. The union
leaders were scattering. Funds were almost exhausted. Return had
not saved the shearers from the legal consequences of the "call
out". Non-unionists were working even in the coal mines. At Bulli
they were under artillery protection. The stalwarts stood their
ground, but on 17 October the marine officers, in whose very
cause the unions had taken action, agreed to abandon affiliation
with the other unions and to return to their ships. That was the
end of the Maritime Strike. In one calling after another, the
men, bitterly disillusioned, returned on whatever terms and to
whatever jobs they could get. Instead of looking forward to
"socialism in our time", as pictured in the glowing phrases of
Lane, the unions found their strength gone, their very existence
threatened, and themselves put on the defensive for a full
decade. "The unions", Lane confessed after that rude awakening,
"are threatened with possible destruction by very reason of their
instinctive but at present unregulated desire to stand by each
other."</p>
<p>Before the year was out, the Queensland pastoralists were
dictating terms of shearing which made no mention either of union
or eight-hours day, which gave the station-owner a right to limit
the number of sheep to be shorn and to say when the wool was
wet,* and required shearers to tar all cuts and to find their own
combs and cutters. Public opinion whispered approval when Chief
Justice Darley in New South Wales spoke of the union shearers as
"a closely knit band of criminals with commissariat arrangements,
firearms and ammunition, devastating sparsely inhabited country,
holding the few inhabitants in terror and compelling honest
labourers to desist from work". Disheartened, the men at many
inside stations accepted the terms offered. Out back in the
Central Division the fight began again and the strikers organized
a camp at Clermont. "Make your choice within a fortnight", said
the squatters, "or others will fill your places." Though this was
represented then and since as a threat to bring in Chinese
labour, the squatters undoubtedly had in mind the "free labour"
they had recruited and could bring north by shiploads from
Melbourne and Sydney. A thousand shearers at Barcaldine talked
openly of their resolve to exclude the southern strike-breakers
by force. The Queensland Government proclaimed such doings an
insurrection (23 February 1891) and despatched mounted police
under a resolute officer to maintain the peace. After a month of
tension and incendiarism at isolated points, the Government
ordered the arrest of the strike leaders. They were charged under
an unrepealed but almost forgotten statute of 6 George IV, c. 129
with conspiring "to induce others to depart from their hiring".
Most were convicted and some sentenced to gaol with hard labour
for three years. Fines and imprisonment for rioting were meted
out to many, and the strikers scattered, powerless to prevent the
drafting-in of as many non-unionists as the pastoralists needed.
At a high cost in money and embittered feelings, the Queensland
pastoralists had brought it home to labour that times had
changed.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The shearers object to wet wool as it causes
rheumatism and sores on the hands which are hard to heal in the
fly-infested back country.]</p>
<p>When in August 1891 the shearing was due to commence in the
southern colonies, squatters' and shearers' leaders alike showed
cooler judgment. The former agreed to maintain the union
conditions, while the latter raised no demur at the employment of
non-union men. Unemployment was still rife and prices were still
falling. The mines felt the pressure no less than the wool trade.
The contract system, a form of piece-work, was enforced in the
Moonta copper mines (S.A.) in October 1891, after a futile
resistance by strikers. In June 1892 it came back to Broken Hill,
from whose stopes the unionists had banished it by a dramatic
strike when the boom was at its height.</p>
<p>The effect of these turmoils on the financial situation,
though by no means helpful, operated through vague opinion and
fears rather than by changing economic realities. In the darker
days that so soon followed many saw in the strikes the cause of
every misfortune. They would have made the labour unions the
scapegoats of unhappy communities. Such views ignored, however,
the unsound practices in private and public finance which had
destroyed the equilibrium of town and country and
over-capitalized almost every industry. The maritime and pastoral
strikes perhaps drew the attention of overseas investors to the
rotten superstructure and thoughtless direction of Australian
finance.</p>
<p>As the strikes involved the pastoralists in heavy additional
expense during two exceptionally good seasons and made them hasty
sellers of their wool, they may have hampered the repayment of
pastoral advances and so the mitigation of the financial crisis.
But that crisis arose out of financial malpractice. Wage-cutting
and conscription for the class-war, the aims of the contending
leaders, were short-sighted measures when the cool diplomacy and
resource of constructive minds could alone have reorganized
business and production and redeemed the colonies' credit after
the monstrous abuse of it by "boomsters". Possibly the labour
troubles aroused in the British investing classes a fear of
labour-socialism. They were in a position to call the Australian
directing class to an account of its stewardship, and did so in
1893 by seeking to withdraw investments. Yet the labour unions
had been crushingly defeated in 1890-91. Was it that British
investors knew with John Bright that coercion cures no evil and
suspected that much remained to be mended in Australia?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX<br>
<br>
The Bank Smash and Economic Reconstruction</h3>
<br>
<p><small>NEMESIS</small> tarried even after the labour turmoils,
choosing her time. The strikes delayed but did not prevent the
shipment of a non-perishable staple&mdash;wool; and the seasons,
especially in New South Wales, continued very favourable. But
prices were still falling, and the searching criticism of all
expenses that is natural on falling markets put a stop to
land-booming. Speculative and all other building ceased suddenly
and absolutely. Forty-one land and finance companies failed in
Melbourne and Sydney between July 1891 and August 1892. There
were four millions of British deposits among the eighteen
millions of their liabilities, and as some called themselves
"banks", British investors began to wonder about Australian
banking in general. The Mercantile Bank had suspended payment in
March 1892. The Bank of South Australia was absorbed by the Union
Bank. All was not well, but the Associated Banks of issue stood
in firm array until January 1893. Then the Federal Bank appealed
to its associates for aid, and on being refused it, went into
liquidation.</p>
<p>The older banks, it was known, must be finding many worthless
finance bills in their portfolios. Advances on city land at
inflated values could not all be repaid. Overdrafts to the
depressed primary industries were "frozen hard". To obtain liquid
resources some banks continued to solicit deposits in Britain
even during 1892. Though bought by high and rising rates of
interest, such deposits with Australian banks increased in that
year by £1,180,000, and the bank that sought them most
urgently was Henry Gyles Turner's Commercial Bank of Australia.
Its Australian deposits were falling after 1890 at the rate of
£400,000 a year, but its British deposits climbed to
£5,638,000 early in 1893. Wool and wheat still slumped in
value, and land banks and finance companies which were known to
have banked with the Commercial stumbled and fell.</p>
<p>All classes in Australia, particularly in Melbourne, were
spending on necessaries alone. Trade was so dull that balances in
London could not be used to advantage. The rates paid on the
later deposits could not be earned in Australia by advances on
sound security. Above all, this British money exerted a
disintegrating force among the banks themselves when solidarity
alone could have saved the weaker ones. If withdrawn, a British
deposit would deplete London balances renewable only by shipments
of gold or additional exports, a different matter from the
withdrawal of an Australian deposit which was almost sure to be
paid into another local bank. The older and more wary banks which
had kept down the mortgage on their gold and London
funds&mdash;most important funds in financing a community whose
foreign trade bulks so largely&mdash;could hardly be blamed if
they fought shy of others' burdens. But their caution became
known and spread fear among a sorely tried public. The
resolutions by which the Associated Banks thought to reassure the
world at large after the collapse of the Federal Bank were so
guarded that they were read as "Sauve qui peut!"</p>
<p>A run on the Commercial Bank was soon draining away its
reserves. In three months, deposits totalling a million were
withdrawn, £115,000 being paid over the counter in one day.
The Board knew that most of the British deposits which fell due
on May the first would be withdrawn. Gyles. Turner appealed to
the Victorian Treasury and the other associated banks. The
Government had no funds to spare in London and would not risk a
Government note issue in Victoria. The banks would find
£1,750,000, but this was not enough. The great "Commercial"
suspended payment on 5 April.</p>
<p>Before the month ended it had "reconstructed". The process
meant that nine millions of deposits were impounded as ordinary
or cumulative preference capital. Five and a half millions of
these were British, but the depositors, after their long-drawn
suspense, accepted the compromise with eagerness. It saved
something from the wreck. Warnings of withdrawals at due date led
to a general epidemic of reconstruction among the other Melbourne
banks early in May. When word reached J. B. Patterson on Sunday,
30 April, that the National Bank of Australasia would close next
day, he gathered his fellow-ministers, hastened by special train
to the Administrator's country house where, as Executive Council,
they drew up a proclamation of five days' bank holiday. Next
morning, the news precipitated all Melbourne white with panic,
into Collins Street. Had all the banks failed? Those whose
headquarters were in Sydney or London opened, ignoring the
moratorium. All the Victorian banks but a small one went into
reconstruction. "We are all floundering", confessed the
Premier.</p>
<p>In Sydney, Sir George Dibbs played the man. By the third of
May he knew that the banks could not act in unison and at once
pushed two emergency measures through parliament.* One of them
made bank notes a first charge on their issuers' assets, the
other gave the Governor-in-Council power, at any bank's request,
to declare its notes legal tender. A little later a third
emergency law empowered the Treasury to issue its own notes and
to lend these to the banks up to half the total of the current
accounts locked up by any bank suspension. This was the
traditional policy of choking a panic with cash. For some reason,
perhaps an old antagonism to government intervention, perhaps the
palsy of despair, the big Sydney banks hesitated to ask in set
form for the aid offered. The Commercial Banking Company of
Sydney, of which Dibbs' own brother was the brain, suspended
payment on 15 May, though it possessed a million in hard cash and
owed only £600,000 to British depositors. Thereupon the
Premier wrung applications from the other leading banks and,
willy-nilly, made their notes lawful cash. This cleared the air.
Sydney's gold reserves, no longer needed there, could be used to
meet demands elsewhere. Little need for them arose, for
confidence, or rather courage, had by this time returned
everywhere. Cecil Rhodes as Premier of Cape Colony cabled on 25
May that he would invest his Government's balances in Victorian
or New South Wales securities or in a new loan to either
government, if desired. His offer was declined, but "as an
indication of the pathway of future events" a British Treasury
official, writing later in the year, thought it "more to be
studied than all the schemes of all the imperialists".**</p>

<p>The very ease with which wealth had come to the directing
class in Melbourne had been its undoing. The bank smash cancelled
out the gold rushes and the land boom. The whole cycle of events
made up an economic episode that left the population in Victoria
with little constructive experience. Some 232 millions in gold,
out of about 320 millions found in Australia prior to 1893, had
passed through Victoria's hands. Her fortunate sons had
investments in every colony, more especially in Queensland. They
had had first use of £54,690,000 out of the hundred
millions lent and invested in Australia by British capitalists
between 1886 and 1890. The habit of assuming that wealth would
always fall into the lap of "marvellous Melbourne" had been too
easily acquired. But 1893 broke the spell.</p>
<p>The prestige and momentum of financial power were gone. One
source of expenditure which in the past had increasingly
stimulated trade in Australia went with them. During the boom
years the export of securities had raised funds equalling a
quarter, of the colonies' recorded production. During the five
years from 1891 to 1895, although investment in Western Australia
was fast growing, withdrawals from Australia as a whole almost
equalled receipts. On balance, only £821,000 of outside
money came into the country. Victorians were forced to call up
the funds they had invested in other colonies, ten millions being
withdrawn from Queensland alone, Coghlan estimates, during a run
of exceptional seasons there.</p>
<p>In these straitened circumstances some of the banks found need
of legal permission to pay on the locked-up deposits lower rates
of interest than they had contracted to pay in their plans of
reconstruction. Colonial courts and legislatures gave them the
easier terms they asked, but such action at the expense of
British shareholders did not mend the repute of Australian
investments. Of the British deposits in the keeping of Australian
banks in March 1893 there were only thirteen and a half millions
left in 1900. Much had become preference capital; but three
millions had been lost outright, and much had been repaid and
withdrawn. Local deposits in Victorian banks stood at
£39,279,000 in March 1893; at £29,698,000 when the
century ended. Advances went down from £50,000,000 to
£29,400,000. Melbourne had shrunk as marvellously as it had
grown.</p>
<p>Victoria was not helped out of her debility by wise political
leading. The policies of her governments during the 'nineties
were starveling and uninspired. Through the long crisis from 1889
to 1893 she looked in vain for a statesman. Her most brilliant
politician, Alfred Deakin, had withdrawn in disgust after holding
office in the Gillies administration throughout the boom, and had
vowed not to serve again save in a federated Australia. David
Syme, with a mind set by age and by the atrophy of unresisted
power, could find only a scapegoat and a row of puppets. Speight,
the Chief Commissioner of Railways, had succumbed to the boom and
joined hands with the politicians in building a spider's web of
parliamentary railways. Inevitably, construction costs at boom
wages rose higher, and the marginal railways, serving undeveloped
and less important areas, earned less. The interest bill swelled
more rapidly than the railway revenue and the old dreary
succession of deficits ominously recommenced. After March 1891,
<i>The Age</i> attacked him as chiefly responsible, owing to his
extravagant over-building and lax administration, for the
alarming state of the colony's finances. Political patronage,
Syme proclaimed, had not even been scotched, but was still
rampant. One man, sheltered by the privileges of a permanent
public servant, was being used by ministers and members for their
own political ends.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>The Age</i>, leading article, 22 June
1891.]</p>
<p>By December 1891 Syme had convicted Speight before the supreme
tribunal of Victoria&mdash;his own editorial desk&mdash;of
incompetence, extravagance and dereliction of duty, of contempt
of Parliament and public. He and his fellow-Commissioners must
go. James Munro, whom Syme had put up in place of the
Gillies-Deakin coalition in November 1890, hesitated to do his
master's bidding and was allowed to retire to London as
Agent-General. William Shiels, installed in his place in February
1892, obeyed orders and suspended Speight, Ford and Greene, the
three Railway Commissioners. Being given compensation in lieu of
salary, Speight spent it in litigation against Syme on the score
of libel. After two trials, which dragged an expensive course
through three years, he was awarded a farthing damages.** Having
thus vindicated and confirmed his power, Syme magnanimously
contributed a cheque for a hundred pounds to help the scapegoat
to start life again in Western Australia.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The charges made by <i>The Age</i> and the
addresses of counsel are reprinted in full in <i>The Great Libel
Case: Speight v. "The Age"</i>, a report of the proceedings in
the second trial, 18 April to 26 September 1894 (Melbourne
1894).]</p>
<p>Graham Berry, the veteran protectionist leader, was called to
office again as Treasurer in the Shiels Ministry and proceeded to
set the finances right by increasing the customs duties. This was
not quite the old protectionist policy, for it depended for
success on a continuance of imports, but it seemed to conform
with recent experience. Berry made the duties 35 to 50 per cent.
<i>ad valorem</i> where in Syme's earlier tariff they had been 20
to 35 per cent. But for some reason the remedy failed. Instead of
the increase of £625,000 the duties had been, expected to
yield, the customs revenue went down by £600,000. The
cessation of loans had dried up the London money and the local
spending upon imports which it financed. Higher customs duties
only cramped still more a shrunken trade. J. B. Patterson,
succeeding Shiels and Berry in January 1893, had to face an
accumulated deficit of £2,650,000. He suggested lower
duties and an income tax of sixpence in the pound. These might
have been accepted, but when he proposed a retrenchment of all
civil servants' salaries as well he provoked too many opponents
at once. A general election swept away the rash fellow. In his
stead came, as the best substitute Syme could put up, George
Turner&mdash;a suburban solicitor, myopic, cautious and tactful.*
From September 1894 he continued as Premier and Treasurer of
Victoria&mdash;save for a temporary displacement in 1900 until in
February 1901 he became first Treasurer of the Commonwealth.
During those years of gloom he served his country faithfully. The
newspaper dictator behind him and his own native caution alike
forbade any bold experiment in re-casting indirect taxation, but
he carried an income tax in 1894 and did not shirk the task and
duty of retrenchment. In addition, he set every government
servant a personal example and, in his shirt sleeves, worked for
unheard-of hours at his desk, watching over pennies and points of
which no predecessor had known. He cut expenditure to the bone,
and scouted every suggestion of more borrowing abroad. By a
system of rigid economy he made certain that Victoria reduced her
public spending and lived within her income. After 1897 he was
proud to show an annual surplus in her greatly shrunken budget.
Yet it was a family solicitor's success, not a statesman's.
Between 1895 and 1900 Victoria lost 75,000 of her folk by
emigration, chiefly to people the goldfields of Western
Australia. The increase in the Victorian population numbered
during those years less than one-fourth of the excess of births
over deaths. Economic relief came from private energy little
helped by the state's policy, and from the success in primary
production elsewhere of the colony's emigrant sons.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Walter Murdoch, <i>Alfred Deakin</i>, p. 185,
describes Turner's appearance at the Adelaide session of the
Federal Convention in 1897: "Early in the proceedings he stood up
and recited a catalogue of radical proposals"&mdash;possibly from
a newspaper cutting&mdash;"he looked and spoke like a busy little
shopkeeper rattling off a list of cheap lines". But his
appearance did scant justice to a spirit of rare tenacity.]</p>
<p>New South Wales followed other leaders and other policies.
E.M.G. Eddy, Sir Henry Parkes' Chief Commissioner of Railways,
had a reasonable chance as well as the courage to control the
railway service he reorganized. Parkes' Public Works Committee
checked for a time the baleful art of log-rolling in which the
local members of that over-centralized colony had been too
skilled. There was still waste to stop, however, and reform was
hampered by the colony's lack of a clean-cut annual budget.
Ministers might initiate without the consent of the Treasurer
expenditure up to £20,000 on any item&mdash;an opening for
commitments which made a firm control of the finances hopeless.
Under a system which also carried over, from one year into
another, votes which had not been spent in full, it was hardly
possible to know how the public finances stood. Deficits could
not but appeal, and there was no definite reckoning-time to spur
public and Parliament into the task of meeting them. Public
revenue per head had remained stationary at £8. 15<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>. between 1881 and 1891, but ordinary expenditure had
grown during that decade from £7. 11<i>s</i>. 2<i>d</i>.
per head to £9. 3<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>. In addition, forty
millions of loan money had been spent, not all of it on
"reproductive" works.</p>
<p>Sir George Dibbs had shown the quality of decision during the
bank crisis, but he incurred the discredit of a state of chaos in
the public accounts for which he was not responsible. His
advocacy of protective duties as a cure for the colony's ills
made no appeal to a community that saw what Victoria had
achieved, that had an old distrust of monopoly and that had been
aroused to enthusiasm for free trade and direct taxation by Henry
George. At the general election of 1894, Dibbs' followers were
routed by a double attack from radical freetraders under George
Houston Reid and from the Labour Party.</p>
<p>In five busy years in office, Reid enacted a series of
financial, agrarian and fiscal reforms which set free to
considerable purpose the resources of the land and the energies
of its people. First, he made provision for an annual budget in
which, as in the other colonies, the public accounts would be
balanced on a cash basis on 30 June of each year. Appropriations
from the consolidated revenue which had not been spent during the
year when they were voted would lapse at its close. He sought to
clarify the main budget of the colony by relieving it of local
expenditure and setting up local governments and municipalities
throughout the colony. Incidentally this measure would have
lessened the intrigues and bargains for local favours that
poisoned the atmosphere of Parliament and corrupted both electors
and elected. It provoked, however, a combination of the regular
Opposition, Labour and "local members" from Reid's own party who
felt they could acquire merit in their clients' eyes by no other
means than petty services. The allies inserted an abolition of
plural voting by property owners which Reid would not accept. His
zeal for simplification was tempered by Scottish caution.</p>
<p>Joseph Carruthers, his Minister for Lands, carried, however, a
revision of the laws governing the selection of Crown lands which
time was to prove a little too bold for democratic sentiment. In
conjunction with the land taxation on a basis of unimproved
values which Reid started then and which Carruthers later
developed, the new land laws reasserted the public interest in
sound settlement. They separated the combatants in the old
agrarian feud; they afforded farmers fair access to land which
they could put to uses more profitable than pasture, and they
relieved out-back pastoral lessees from the worse forms of bogus
selection.</p>
<p>Earlier amendments of the Robertson system ** had in large
measure eliminated the conflict between leasehold and free
selection by dividing the pastoral leases into "resumed" and
leasehold areas. The former, though legally resumed, remained in
occupation by the pastoralist until someone saw fit to select.
The incentive to dummying on such areas therefore remained. On
the leasehold areas, however, selection was barred and the
pastoral lessee was secure for five, ten, or fifteen years in the
Eastern, Central and Western Divisions respectively. But all such
expedients short of the full security of freehold call for
watchful administration if the interest of posterity in a plastic
land system is to be upheld. The amending acts limited the
patronage of Ministers of Lands and wire-pulling members by
setting up sixteen local land boards. These would judge the good
faith of applicants for land and scrutinize their fulfilment of
the conditions of purchase. The most important condition, that of
residence, had in 1884 been raised from three to five years. This
was intended to make more expensive the practice of storekeepers
in country towns of subsidizing dummies with rations and taking
payment at the end of three years in the land they had selected
from the pastoralists' runs. The Act of 1889 set above the local
boards a Land Appeal Board. This took the place the Minister had
held. The Lands Department, it was argued, was an interested
party in many cases that were made the subject of appeals. The
new court of three members exercised its judicial functions
wherever the business before it required its presence. Land
causes led to itinerant justice as when the first and second
Henries built up the royal courts of England.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Notably the Crown Lands Acts of 1884 and
1889.]</p>
<p>Such steps did something to separate the combatants who had
warred for the public estate. But more was needed to encourage a
financially crippled population to lay out slender resources in
the risky business of growing a crop under the sun and the rain.
The town population, as Carruthers reminded Parliament, had
increased between 1861 and 1891 from 159,834 to 730,000; the
country folk only from 189,116 to 338,321. The failure of free
selection, with its record of blackmail, dummying, litigation and
financial disaster was, he claimed, as plain as Holy Writ. But
there have been disputes on the interpretation even of Holy Writ.
Carruthers carried the men of New South Wales with him in his
reading of remedies for the failure when, for the mad scramble of
free selection before survey, he substituted two principles well
tested in the southern colonies&mdash;selection after survey and
the classification of Crown lands. The former substituted orderly
surveying for desperate unreason. The latter proceeded along
tentative but sound economic lines, (a) setting apart areas
suited to specific forms of selection and (b) putting varying
values per acre on the blocks surveyed for settlers. He was on
well-tried ground, too, when he made extensive use of a five
years probationary lease as a test of the good faith of
applicants for agricultural land.</p>
<p>Reid and Carruthers broke new ground in an ambitious plan to
stay the alienation of the public estate by substituting
agricultural leaseholds for freeholds. Robertson's conditional
purchase had scattered freeholds throughout the countryside. The
1895 amending act offered long leases and security of tenure on
an improvement basis. For gracing farms "settlement leases" of 28
to 40 years were given at rentals of 1¼ to 2½ per
cent. on the capital value of the blocks, subject to
re-appraisement at the end of each fifteen years of the lease.
Within the first eighteen years after 1895 some 8,793,000 acres
were taken up on this tenure. But the country residents of New
South Wales had seen and done many things in defeat of leasehold.
They had small reason to expect security at the hands of
government. Early in the next century, before many settlement
leases had come up for their first re-appraisement, this tenure
was made convertible into freehold for certain areas per
lessee.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>New South Wales Official Year Book</i>,
1927-8, p. 724, shows that of the 8,793,663 acres granted as
settlement leases up to 1913 over 5,000,000 acres were converted
to freehold between 1909 and 1927.]</p>
<p>In increasing from five to ten years the term of residence
required on ordinary conditional purchase (Robertson) selections,
the Carruthers Act stiffened the tests of agricultural intentions
applied to those seeking freehold farms. But it offered leasehold
farms as well. These were called homestead selections, and were
surveyed before settlement on areas set apart for agricultural
occupation "on a face", i.e. unmingled with pastoral runs. The
object was to divide resumed areas into blocks which in the
ordinary run of seasons would maintain an active farmer's home.
Each settler might obtain one block only. After residing on it
for five years and effecting specified improvements, he would be
given a homestead grant. Both forms of leasehold selection were
originally made subject to the condition of perpetual residence
by the lessee or his transferees. The lessees of homesteads paid
1¼ per cent. on the appraised value for five years and
thereafter 2½ per cent. Nowadays the rate is 3½ per
cent. "if residence is performed by deputy".** At first,
extensive areas were occupied on such leasehold terms, but with
agricultural success the hankering for freehold and security from
re-appraisement proved too strong. In 1908 facilities were
conceded for the conversion of homestead selections into
conditional purchases, i.e. freehold.***</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>N.S.W. Official Year Book</i>, 1927-8, p.
726. In 1912 a new form of leasehold, the "homestead farm", was
evolved.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** See V. S. Childe, <i>How Labour Governs</i>,
pp. 54, 33, as to the political reactions of the "Conversion
Act".]</p>
<p>Though backsliding was to follow later, the method of lending
public land at a nominal rental to genuine settlers opened the
way in the poverty-stricken 'nineties to a big agricultural
advance. Money for the purchase of the freehold was sadly to
seek. The little capital that could be found was used as working
capital at a time when advances against land were regarded
askance. Carruthers' Act opened a way to much active farming in
the great central scrub from Booligal to the Bogan, and elsewhere
on the Western Slopes and in the Riverina.</p>
<p>Farther west the confusion was not easily mended. On the
resumed halves of pastoral leases, free selection of grazing
farms under the Act of 1884 had unhappily coincided with the era
of falling prices, with drought and with the spread of rabbits
through the Darling basin.**** Even when he meant well, the
grazing selector could make no headway, and many a "resumed half"
became a mere breeding ground for the rabbit pest. Carruthers
granted revision of rents to the pastoral lessees whose land had
been devastated, and, whenever any area was withdrawn for
settlement, an extension of lease over the remainder of the run
proportioned arithmetically to the fractional area taken. But in
the west, the great King Drought remained master all through
Reid's rule.</p>
<p class="foot">[**** See D. G. Stead's article "The Rabbit", in
the <i>Australian Encyclopaedia</i>, vol. <small>II</small>, pp.
355-8.]</p>
<p>Reid's fiscal reforms were, like his financial practice and
his colleague's land law, a return to simplicity. He encouraged
his fellow-colonists to persist with the colony's natural
industries by taking every removable burden off their costs,
enabling the miner, the dairyman and the cultivator to aid the
pastoralist in finding from the land the exports needed to
restore confidence and prosperity. Though it cost him half his
majority and a sharp parliamentary struggle, Reid removed Dibbs'
light protective duties, reduced some of the older duties on
conventional necessaries such as sugar, and derived new revenue
from added duties on narcotics and stimulants and from light
direct taxes on incomes and the unimproved value of land. He was
forced to retain certain specific duties on necessaries as
concessions to conservatism when pushing the direct taxes through
the Legislative Council, but his revenue tariff was simpler than
that of Great Britain herself.</p>
<p>Under it, New South Wales made a recovery in bold contrast
with the long stagnation that followed 1893 in Victoria and South
Australia. Only in Western Australia, indeed, was the mother
colony's expansion under free trade surpassed. It embraced both
primary and secondary production, commerce as well as industry.
The area under wheat expanded from 647,483 acres when Reid took
office to 1,426,166 acres when he left it. Sydney recovered her
chief place as the distributing centre for Australia, New Zealand
and the South Pacific. Her re-exports rose from £4,700,000
in 1894 to £10,000,000 in 1898. After the crisis, 17,000
houses stood empty in Melbourne. Sydney's population hardly
ceased growing, and by 1899 the building trades there were as
active as in 1891. In every colony men set about increasing
production from the soil. The decade 1891-1901 saw an increase in
the number of Australian breadwinners engaged in primary
production from 419,499 to 535,766, from 30.7 of the total
breadwinners to 32.5.* Nowhere, however, was such all-round
success achieved as in New South Wales. In effect, Reid's tariff
stipulated that no manufacturer should make his
fellow-Australians' tasks more expensive, that no industry was
wanted which did not maintain its footing by fair service at a
fair price in the main task of lifting the net income and real
standard of living in the colony of New South Wales.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See Tables on p. 891 in <i>Commonwealth Year
Book</i>, no. 20. The return to gold-mining in W.A. accounts for
much of the increase, but this is the only decade since 1871 in
which Primary Production has gained upon Transport and Industry
in numbers occupied.]</p>
<p>This was uphill work. An unprecedented drought reduced the
flocks of New South Wales from nearly 57 millions in 1894 to
36,213,000 in 1899 and 26,650,000 in 1902. Save for a temporary
spurt in 1899, wool remained low in value too; yet the wool-clip
was maintained at almost its old total by the increased weight of
the average fleece. The production of wool in New South Wales
fell off by less than twenty million pounds in the decade, from
321,416,000 pounds in 1891 to 301,942,000 pounds in 1901.
Moreover the installation of refrigerating engines on steamers
plying to Europe added a new source of income from Australian
pastures. New South Wales did well with frozen mutton. Even if
the lighter carcase of the Merino compared unfavourably with New
Zealand's crossbreds, it was worth more in that form than as
tallow from boiling down or as meat on the local market.
Queensland pastoralists led the way in exports of frozen and
chilled beef.** But refrigeration helped the small farmers even
more than the pastoralists. Their crossbreds produced better
lambs for freezing and their butter became for the first time a
profitable export.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Three men deserve honourable mention for
their efforts along different lines to solve the riddle of
sending refrigerated cargoes of Australian perishable commodities
to Britain. They, were (i) James Harrison, a Victorian inventor
and journalist (Australian Encyclopaedia, vol. <small>I</small>,
p. 601), (ii) Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, a Sydney wool-broker and man
of enterprize (<i>id</i>. vol. <small>II</small>; p. 144), and (iii)
Robert Christison, a Queensland pastoralist (M. M. Bennett,
<i>op. cit</i>. chapters <small>XV</small> and
<small>XVI</small>).]</p>
<p>The Victorian market had been glutted with "dairy butter" in
the 'seventies when it was retailed at sevenpence a pound or sold
at 1¾<i>d</i>. a pound in casks to the soap-makers. An
unrefrigerated shipment of 2½ tons was sent to Leith as an
experiment. Why Leith was chosen as its destination is hardly
apparent. It sold as grease at a penny a pound. There was no
future for Gippsland dairy farms in those prices. Then came the
refrigerator (1882) and the Danish cream separator (about 1885).
The first consignment of refrigerated butter sent to London
brought sixteen pence a pound. In this new export Victoria led
the way. Her shipments to England rose from 1,286,583 pounds in
1890 to 13,141,423 in 1893 and 22,139,521 pounds in 1894.
Co-operative central butter factories turned out a more uniform
and dependable product, and raised the value of a dairy cow from
£3. 10<i>s</i>. on an independent farm making its own
butter by hand-churn to £8. 10<i>s</i>. when the farm
supplied cream to the factory or milk to the creamery. Tasmania
was pioneer in the export of fruit in cold storage, mainly
apples.</p>
<p>At the end of the nineteenth century it was easier to put
Australian food on English tables in perfect preservation than it
had been to put French or Irish produce there when Queen Victoria
came to the throne. Commodities once of little value became the
basis of intensive settlement. In this the years following the
bank crisis were those of most activity. The new economic
strength of dairy farming was shown in the voluntary sub-division
of pastoral freeholds, which were sold or leased as small farms
to dairymen and fruit-growers. These men could now pay for their
land at enhanced prices, and make good incomes too, where the
free selectors had failed. Yet since they faced the competition
of Denmark and Ireland in butter, and of New Zealand and the
Argentine in mutton and beef, their success was conditional on
high efficiency and low costs of production. The big share which
New South Wales took in each of the new export trades. showed an
adaptability in agriculture that she had once notably lacked, and
in this turning of the tables on her southern neighbours the
advantage of her revenue tariff was not slight.</p>
<p>In the 'nineties, also, the riddle of permanent wheat-farming
in Australia was solved. Necessity proved again the mother of
invention. Edward Lascelles, applying South Australian methods on
a large scale, developed a new wheat area which soon spread over
a million acres of the Victorian. Mallee lands. These had been
thought hopeless for agriculture because the eucalyptus scrub
stooled out with fresh vigour when the main stems were cut. After
1876 the spread of rabbits led to the abandonment even of
pastoral leases there. South Australians first hit upon the idea
of "mallee-rolling", i.e. of "Mullenizing" the land by dragging
over it with a team of oxen a heavy roller made from an old
engine-boiler or a tree-trunk. The snapped stems and foliage were
then burned off and the stump jump plough set to work among the
mallee-roots that had not burned in the dry soil. Lascelles
planned the conquest on a large scale of a new virgin area for
agriculture. He provided water by irrigation and transport by a
light railway. Having demonstrated that cultivation on extensive
lines would cover the light costs, he sub-let to share-farmers
his "pastoral lease" at Lake Corrong (now re-named Hopetoun), and
his example set flowing a vigorous current of settlement.</p>
<p>Irrigation works initiated by the Gillies-Deakin government in
the Goulburn and Wimmera valleys under an Act of 1886 had been
stultified by the doubt whether the market could absorb much
fruit and small produce. Nor had governments after the boom the
resources of money or courage needed to educate the settlers on
the irrigated lands into paying the cost of their reticulation.
Lascelles, however, had found another use for the irrigation
channels northward from the Wimmera, as means of supplying stock
and domestic water over wheat-growing areas. The winter rains
watered the crop, but there were as yet few sound catchments, and
summer rains were too capricious to refill the dams. Government
railways were, constructed with light or second-hand rails, and
gravitation channels were extended from the Grampians watershed
to enable new farmers to test Lascelles' ideas. Their conquest of
the Mallee for agriculture enlarged the Victorian area under
wheat from 1,145,163 acres in 1890 to 2,017,321 acres in
1900.</p>
<p>In South Australia the wheat area fluctuated from 1,673,573
acres in 1890 to 1,913,247 acres in 1900, though still remaining
smaller than it had been in the 'eighties. But South Australian
farmers were at last listening to the professors of Roseworthy
College and dressing their wheat fields with superphosphate. In
1896 they used 600 tons of "artificial manures", mainly
superphosphate of lime. By 1900 they used 24,000 tons, and the
average yield in a season of by no means favourable rainfall rose
to 5.88 bushels. Since then, South Australian yields have
abundantly borne out Professor Lowrie's prediction that they
might well be doubled when normal seasons returned. The Victorian
Wimmera and Mallee districts, largely settled by South
Australians, were quick to follow this lead. Superphosphate was
first used around Nhill in 1897&mdash;"the year of the cyclone".*
In spreading it, a selector named Salter took a hint from an old
practice of steeping seed-wheat in liquid manure and nitre. After
he had pickled his seed with bluestone, he mixed superphosphate
or Thomas phosphate with it so that each grain received a coating
of manure, rushed the seed to the field and sowed it broadcast by
hand before it had time to dry. This obviated the difficulty of
sowing with the old seeding-machine that had a centrifugal
action; it had sent seed and "super" flying in different
directions. But Salter's method was little better. Though 9.75
inches of rain fell during the growing period that year, only
three bushels an acre were harvested. During the next two years,
the Department of Agriculture showed the farmers how to "drill
in" both seed and manure. The imported superphosphate "ran"
badly, being lumpy with moisture absorbed when crossing the
tropics, but the value of the new method was at once apparent.
Supplementing the stump jump plough and harvester, the drill and
its later derivative the combine (cultivator and drill) have made
the Australian farmer master of his little world and almost
independent of hired labour.</p>
<p class="foot">[* W. E. Dahlenberg, "Thirty Years of
Wheat-growing at Nhill", in the <i>Ganmain Express</i>, 7 May
1926&mdash;an excellent summary of the methods which have made
the Wimmera pre-eminent as a wheat district.]</p>
<p>More than the general use of superphosphate, however,
contributed to the rapid advance of wheat-growing that marked the
decade after the drought. Fallow, repeatedly worked to give a
firm level seed-bed covered with a mulch of dry tilth, conserves
for the crop plenty of nitrates and much of the previous year's
rainfall. That is the essence of "dry-farming", taught by stern
necessity in South Australia and Victoria during the persistent
drought of the 'nineties. But the greatest lesson then learned
came from an amateur botanist in New South Wales&mdash;the lesson
of pedigree and graded seed.</p>
<p>The western slopes of New South Wales are within the zones of
both the summer and winter rains. Sometimes they receive both,
sometimes neither. The wheat crop is thus exposed to dangers of
drought and rust. An English surveyor with a love of botany
decided that the heavy-flagged, soft-grained wheats, favoured for
their big yields in lucky seasons by his neighbours near the
present site of Canberra, were ill-adapted to face such climatic
vicissitudes. In 1889 heavy losses through rust had spoilt a
favourable prospect even in South Australia. William Farrer knew
that the nature of the rusts precluded any curative treatment of
the growing crop, and set himself to breed varieties of wheat
that could resist or escape their onslaught.</p>
<p>He chose to breed, by careful cross-fertilization, varieties
that would have the characters he wanted, rather than await and
select nature's chance crosses. With a constructive method such
as this, he thought he might achieve as well two further
objects&mdash;to produce types suited by their economy of flag
and early maturity to the short growing-season of western New
South Wales, and to improve the gluten-content and milling
strength of Australian wheats. He wanted, in other words, a
rust-and-drought-resistant wheat-plant, the flour from which
would absorb much water and produce more well-risen loaves. He
began his researches in 1886 at Tharwa near Queanbeyan, and in
1890 attracted the attention of the more intelligent officers of
the Department of Agriculture. They invited him to Sydney in 1891
and sent him to Adelaide in 1892 to conferences on the rust
problem. Even with the old wheats, New South Wales was advancing
fast as an agricultural colony. In 1897 she exported bread-stuffs
for the first time; her subsequent success, however, was largely
Farrer's achievement. By 1898 he had bred wheats resistant to the
rusts of his own district, and his new wheats, "Bobs" and "John
Brown", were being eagerly sought for their ability to stand up
to drought and their yield of stronger milling grain. In 1902-3
he was able to distribute in bulk a seed-wheat called "Federation"
which has literally changed the whole aspect of the Australian
wheat fields. It makes a short-strawed crop, unattractive in the
paddocks because of a bronze appearance quite unlike the golden
harvest of tradition; but it won favour by sheer yield. Produced
to be cut by the stripper-harvester, the plant wastes little of
its time and strength on straw, but throws a moisture-content
that the sun drinks greedily from soil or leaf into heads
well-packed with translucent grain. Farrer's work and that of his
pupils neither started nor stopped with "Federation", but it was
that variety which, as dramatically as McArthur's Merinos, laid
the firm basis of a great exporting industry, in this case the
high quality of the dry white wheats of Australia. His "abstruse
experiments in cross-fertilization" put the staple crop of
Australian farmers into something like competitive equality with
wool inside the ten-inch winter rainfall line.** They did more.
At last settlers had the means&mdash;in labour-saving implements,
dry-farming, superphosphate and pedigree wheats&mdash;of
accepting the land so long offered them and of making permanent
homes in it.</p>
<p class="foot">[** In a paper on "The Making and Improvement of
Wheats for Australian Conditions", read before the Australasian
Association for the Advancement of Science at Sydney in 1898,
Farrer explained in detail his aims and technique and the
economic possibilities, as he saw them, of Australian
wheat-growing. The paper was printed in full in the
<i>Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales</i>, vol.
<small>IX</small>, parts II and III.]</p>

havoc with the settlers' standards of domestic comfort which it

<h3>CHAPTER XX<br>
<br>
Back to Colonizing</h3>
<br>
<p><small>WHEN</small> in the 'nineties British investors looked
askance at Australian public and private securities, other
exports were needed to meet Australian commitments abroad.
Mining, and especially the old simple gold-digging, played a big
part in producing the goods. Some of the city unemployed in
Victoria and New South Wales went fossicking on old alluvial
fields, with considerable success. Companies treated the tailings
of old crushings by the new cyanide process. As a result, the New
South Wales gold output rose from £460,285 in 1890 to
£1,315,929 in 1895, that of Victoria from £2,354,244
to £2,960,344 in the same period, and the Australian output
from £5,231,466 to £7,708,029. The last figure
included a new contribution&mdash;£879,748 from Western
Australia.</p>
<p>Here alone the days of the diggings had come again, with their
sudden rushes, their flamboyant style, with fabulous gains for a
few, excitement and toil for all But there was a big difference
in the West. To make life bearable or even possible on the
diggings there, the aid of the state was from the first essential
to a degree that had never been known at Bathurst or Ballarat.
The widely scattered discoveries of alluvial gold made in 1887 at
Golden Valley and Southern Cross in the Yilgarn Hills, in 1888 on
the de Grey and Oakover Rivers in the Pilbarra district, and in
1889 at Lake Austin in the Murchison, were all in regions of
intense heat and prolonged drought. Supplies of water for
considerable populations in such places would cost time and
money. In spite of official warnings, however, inexperienced
miners and camp-followers crowded thither and by their very
sufferings, forced the officials of the Crown Colony to take
urgent measures to avoid wholesale disaster.</p>
<p>Luckily the grant of responsible government freed the courage
of John Forrest from the curb of Westminster. This was no race to
be won with tight reins. As an explorer he had known what thirst
meant in that inland country, and though attacked and reviled by
the noisier element on the "fields" whose growth and needs outran
even the boldest measures, he laboured faithfully with the aid of
subordinates as great-hearted as himself to make habitable the
harsh, ill-watered areas where the "t'othersiders" swarmed.
Self-government had brought release from the veto of the Colonial
Office on colonial borrowing. A few years earlier, when the
public debt of the colony was a million and a quarter, Governor
Broome had been refused leave to borrow £500,000 for public
works. The first Parliament elected under responsible government
(1891) authorized the flotation in London of a loan of
£1,336,000 to build an Eastern Goldfields Railway from
Northam to Southern Cross, to make a harbour at Fremantle and to
provide water out back. The contractors pushed the line out
quickly and made good profit by private operation of it for some
months before it was handed over to the government.</p>
<p>Before the railhead had reached Southern Cross, John Ford and
Arthur Bayley, a lucky prospector from the Murchison field, had
pushed eastward from "the Cross" with two months' provisions on
their pack-horses. In July 1892, finding good grass on a flat
which the natives called Coolgardie, they rested their horses. In
an hour or two they had picked up twenty ounces of gold in small
nuggets. Supplies ran short and they were compelled to return to
Southern Cross. The raw gold in which they paid for more
provisions brought others on their tracks, but not until they had
taken from the cap of a reef five hundred ounces of free
gold.</p>
<p>On 17 September 1892, Warden Finnerty at Southern Cross
granted Bayley's reward claim. On camels, horses, bicycles or
afoot, almost every man there rushed helter-skelter to
Coolgardie. "In Perth and Fremantle everyone seems to be either
carrying tents, picks, shovels and dishes or otherwise preparing
for the road." * Four hundred men had won three thousand ounces
at Coolgardie before the end of October. Then the lack of water
drove almost all of them back until the long hot summer was over.
From Melbourne, Adelaide and overseas, unheard-of numbers came to
Albany and Fremantle to be ready for the rush when the winter
rains returned. Officials made ready to dig big dams and to bore
for artesian supplies. In 1893 the colony spent £15,000 on
water supplies at Coolgardie and along the Goldfields road, a big
sum for a community inured to economy. It proved, however,
ludicrously low for the needs of those now arriving. Four
thousand five hundred had come in 1892, five thousand came in
1893. By ships that risked foundering in the great winter rollers
of the Bight, heedless of any discomfort, they made the passage
from the depressed towns of Victoria and South Australia to share
in the glittering prizes of Fly Flat. A few hardbitten
"overlanders" made their way with camels or horses across the
Nullarbor Plain that till then had separated East and West as
completely as a sea. From Britain too came adventurers of all
classes and qualities; they made a new and vigorous community
with all the variety and fecklessness of the old Victorian
days.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>West Australian</i>, 21 September
1892.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Pierre Leroy-Beaulieu gives an excellent
picture of the Western Australian "Gold Fever" in <i>Les
Nouvelles Sociétés Anglo-Saxonnes</i>, chapter
<small>VII</small> (1896).]</p>
<p>Sensational finds by prospectors continued and the new
government's difficulties in providing water and transport were
extreme. The gold occurred here and there in rich pockets. The
richness of the finds brought great numbers to the scene, but the
limited extent of the rich patches in every early discovery made
Perth officials reluctant to incur heavy expense on permanent
water-works. Yet, without water in plenty, permanent mines were
impossible. High working costs would prohibit any attempt to
extract gold from the lower grade ores.</p>
<p>Boring for artesian supplies had revealed only salt water.
Public and private "condensers", stoked up with the salmon gum
timber that grew as a sparse but almost universal forest on the
Coolgardie goldfields, distilled fresh water from this, but only
in expensive driblets. By the end of 1895 the government had
built at a cost of £37,700 tanks and dams to hold
13,500,000 gallons, but by then the population was increasing by
tens of thousands each year Moreover, surface water was not safe.
Typhoid fever, already endemic on the fields, showed a
significant spurt of virulence after each rain. Sanitation was of
the crudest. Soil and dust around the camps were charged with
germs that too easily infected dams and the tanks supplied from
roofs.***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** See J. H. L. Cumpston and F. Macallum,
<i>History of Intestinal Infections</i> (Comm. Dept. of Health,
1927), p. 402, for a letter from C. H. Hill, Health Officer at
Coolgardie, May 1895.]</p>
<p>Another reason for caution was the atmosphere of bluff and
knavery that gathered around "new finds". Authentic and really
wonderful samples of ore from these might even be sent to London,
but they seldom continued at depth. Before operations could
continue, local managers had sometimes, so the story goes, to
request London to "send back the mine". Such fields had already
attracted company promoters whose market rigging threatened to
accentuate their speculative repute. Clear vision and bold action
were needed if a stable community were to establish itself in the
wilderness. Yet courage and chance did achieve that end.</p>
<p>In June of 1893 a rush of about 150 men had set off from
Coolgardie towards a locality termed "Mount Youle", said to be
fifty miles out, to the north-east. Perhaps a trader started the
rumour as a ruse to sell stores. Most of the party camped for two
days in some rocky country by Mount Charlotte, held up by lack of
water. Rain fell, and all but two pushed on. Hannan and Flannigan
stayed, the latter having "spotted" some surface gold; in a day
or two they had found a hundred ounces. Hannan pegged out a
reward claim; it was granted, and in two days more half
Coolgardie was encamped at "Hannan's", now Kalgoorlie. Almost as
a matter of course London companies were formed to exploit the
gold-bearing lodes at depth. To the general surprise it was found
that here the rich patches did have considerable depth, and
length too, over a full Golden Mile. When Sir John Forrest
visited the fields in November 1895 he found several mines
assured of ranking for years to come among the world's biggest
producers.</p>
<p>The evidence of their permanence, backed by vehement clamour
from the diggers, convinced the Premier that ample water must
somehow be supplied both to the mines and the city growing up
around them. Early in 1896, C. Y. O'Connor, the colony's
Engineer-in-Chief, decided that the best plan was to build a weir
on the Helena River, in the Darling Ranges near Perth, at a spot
called Mundaring. The rainfall there averaged well over forty
inches a year, and from the Mundaring Reservoir five million
gallons daily could be pumped, along a pipe line thirty inches in
diameter, 330 miles to the eastern goldfields. Men gasped, but
Forrest stood by his adviser, and at his wish Parliament
authorized the borrowing of a million and a half to build the
weir, install the pumps and lay the pipe-line.</p>
<p>While the work was in hand, the gold yield rose from
£1,068,807 in 1896 to £3,990,699 in 1898 and passed
six millions in 1900. London investors readily found money for
public works in the colony, even though they were fighting shy of
other colonial securities. In 1896 and 1897 Western Australia was
the only Australian colony to raise new loans in London. Masses
of rich ore had been discovered in the Murchison and other
northerly fields and railways were pushed out from Cue to
Meekatharra, from Kalgoorlie to Laverton and Leonora. The
boom-time congestion of goods on Fremantle Wharf&mdash;"the farm"
was at last cleared, and in appearance, though by no means in
truth, the newcomers had taken charge of the busy community of
175,113 in 1900 which contrasted strongly with the sleepy 47,081
to whom, ten years earlier, responsible government had been
granted. All but a few were waiting eagerly for the impetus to
mining which should come with the operation of C. Y. O'Connor's
great water scheme.* Early in March 1902 the "Scheme water"
reached Kalgoorlie, but when it did so the great engineer who had
planned and achieved this triumph had resigned his cares. Worn
out by his labours in substituting for the open roadstead of
Fremantle a safe harbour at the Swan River's mouth, and in
pumping a river up to the arid interior, he died by his own hand
on the eve of the popular celebrations. It was enough for him
that the pessimists were confounded.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Among the sceptics one of the most persistent
was J. H. Curie, in his <i>Gold Mines of the World</i>. See first
edition (1899). p. 154, and second edition (1902).]</p>
<p>Never has an Australian colony employed a better public
servant. It was his brain that enabled Forrest, by public works
built with British capital, to remove the great natural
impediments to colonization in the south-west corner of the
continent. Yet his death is additional evidence of the breaking
strain that a centralized economy must impose on its most capable
men. He had been in the colony's service less than eleven years
when at the age of 58 his spirit of tempered steel was
broken.</p>
<p>The Coolgardie, or, as it is now called, Goldfields Water
Supply, though for a time a financial burden on the revenue, has
been more than an engineering success. Both the critics who
loudly proclaimed it needless and extravagant, and the optimists
who expected it to make possible the real greatness of the mines,
missed its true value. Here, as in the eastern colonies, gold
brought people but could not hold them. Indeed, world-wide
monetary changes drove them out of gold-mining much more quickly
in Western than in Eastern Australia. The trading world was being
supplied with so much gold by South Africa, Western Australia and
the Klondike after 1896 that its value, as measured in
commodities, went steadily down, i.e. prices of goods as stated
in gold-units went up. As soon as this rise in gold prices offset
such particular economies as the cyanide process of producing it,
the Western Australian mines were limited to richer ore by the
rise in general costs. Those of Victoria had been helped to
survive by falling costs in the 'seventies and 'eighties. Thus
the changeover to agriculture had to be made quickly in the West
if the state was not to lose its ex-miners more rapidly than
Victoria had done.</p>
<p>It was well that Sir John Forrest had made a lifelong study of
the land problem. In 1892, before Coolgardie arose, he had
introduced a Homesteads Bill to enable the government to assist
settlers by loans up to half the value of the improvements needed
to turn virgin land into farms. At first, prejudice against state
interference was too strong for him, but in November 1894 an Act
was passed establishing the Agricultural Bank. Using
£100,000 of trust money as its capital, the Manager of the
Bank was to make advances of not more than £400 each to
enable new settlers to ringbark and clear their homesteads.
Within areas of safe rainfall they might well grow some of the
farm produce which the colony was then importing to the value of
half-a-million a year from the eastern colonies. Under careful
and conservative management the Bank felt its way for eight
years.** Early in the new century, however, maim gold-mining
showed signs of waning, two or three vigorous spirits among the
colony's public men realized that superphosphate and the other
new wheat-growing methods of Eastern Australia could be applied
with unusual chances of steady success over a broad belt of
lightly-timbered country, of mottled quality but safe rainfall,
stretching from Geraldton towards Albany and eastward as far as
Southern Cross and perhaps Esperance. They seized upon the
Agricultural Bank as a means of providing government money by
which anyone, ex-miner, civil servant or immigrant, might clear
and equip a wheat farm. The category of improvements for which
advances were to be made was widened, and such advances were
allowed up to the full value of such improvements.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>The Agricultural Bank and Industries
Assistance Board</i>, by Gordon Taylor (1921), though marred by
some immature judgments, gives a valuable résumé of
the development of government credit to farmers in W.
Australia.]</p>
<p>Almost equal in importance to the Agricultural Bank's
advances, in this transition to agriculture, was the aid given in
the new wheat areas by the Goldfields Water Supply. At first it
had relied for financial support on its services to the mines and
goldfields towns, but nowadays farms and wheat-handling towns
draw water from it along two-thirds of the pipe-line.* Rapid
settlement, as in the Victorian Malice, was made easily
practicable in country where, during summer, water for stock and
domestic use had been hard to find. O'Connor had builded better
than he knew. Over a far wider range of country, north and south
of the belt which the pipe-line crosses, one of C. Y. O'Connor's
lieutenants, P.V. O'Brien, has provided water supplies piecemeal
by a more economical method, conserving the water around the
granite bosses that occur like natural roofs throughout the
south-west of Western Australia. By low retaining channels around
the base, the rain-water, is led into covered dams of
considerable size. In other instances wells at favourable spots
have revealed unsuspected sub-artesian supplies. By such ways
much of the land that seemed utterly inhospitable in the
'nineties has been made the scene of agricultural settlement or,
farther out, of light pastoral occupation.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "In 1925-6 the Railways consumed 8 per cent.,
the mines 22 per cent. and 'other' 70 per cent. of the water
supply." <i>C.Y.B.</i> no. 20, pp. 136-7.]</p>
<p>Under the brave rule of Forrest, Western Australia thus began
a recapitulation in an artificial setting of the main themes of
Australian colonization. Superphosphate and the acclimatized
wheat-farming of the Eastern States enabled the immigrant
"t'othersiders" and a new generation of "gropers" to break the
spell of her long pastoral slumber. But that dramatic awakening
of the Swan River colony seems to have exhausted the capacity of
Australians to colonize in the old makeshift, venturesome
fashion.</p>
<p>The planters' dreams of a separate North Queensland had come
to nought, and South Australian ambitions to plant a tropical
sub-colony in the Northern Territory ended in costly failure.
Forts Dundas and Wellington were abandoned in 1824 and 1827.
Another defensive post under naval auspices lasted at Port
Essington from 1838 to 1849.** Crawfurd, the Administrator of
Singapore, wrote of the North Australian coast that, owing to the
uncertain character of the monsoon, he could not conceive a
tropical locality more unfavourable to cultivation. Yet in 1864
the South Australians projected its official development from a
"first town" on the coast, around which small farming areas and
pastoral estates would be sold and leased on the good old
Wakefield plan.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The following paragraphs owe much to the
<i>Cambridge History of the British Empire</i>, vol.
<small>VII</small>, ch. <small>VI</small>, "Experiments in
Colonization", by A. Grenfell Price.]</p>
<p>Pastoralists had indeed trekked from the south and east into
the high inland country. Some had followed the South Australian
explorers, Stuart and McKinlay; and in spite of the resistance of
Newcastle, the Secretary of State, the whole territory, save a
strip known as the Albert district southward from the Gulf of
Carpentaria, was assigned to South Australian government.
Quarrels between the officials sent to determine the site of the
"first town", delays in the survey of land and the defection of a
North Australian Company, made up a record of blundering that was
not expunged by Surveyor-General Goyder's choice of the fine
harbour at Port Darwin and rapid survey of 600,000 acres on the
tableland behind. But it was not only initial errors that "damned
the Northern Territory"; as subsequent events showed, the
permanent disabilities of soil and climate counted for more. It
was absurd, in any circumstances, to attempt its government from
the colony farthest from it by sea, the only means of
communication then available. Newcastle, who saw this, acted
unwisely in sanctioning an absurdity.</p>
<p>The leaders in South Australia sought in 1870 to correct this
weakness by a telegraph line joining their northern and southern
territories. The projectors of a submarine cable proposed that
the colonies should co-operate in the construction of a land-line
from Wentworth near the Darling-Murray junction to Burketown on
the Gulf of Carpentaria; there it would meet the terminal station
of the cable they were to lay from Singapore. On his way to
Melbourne, an emissary from the company asked at Adelaide whether
South Australia would facilitate its operations if Port Darwin
were made an intermediate station.</p>
<p>Premier Strangways was eagerly favourable. His government
would either guarantee the cost of constructing or would itself
construct an overland telegraph line along McDouall Stuart's
track from Adelaide to the north coast. According to Charles
Todd, the Superintendent of Telegraphs, such a line would cost
£120,000. While the negotiation was proceeding, John Hart
displaced Strangways as Premier, and, being a more cautious
financier, reverted to the plan of co-operating with the other
colonies on the Wentworth-Burketown route. The House of Assembly,
however, was not to be baulked of the prize and insisted that
South Australia should at least offer to shoulder the full
responsibility. As a result the province undertook to finish the
line from Port Augusta to Port Darwin before the end of 1871. It
was expected to "promote the success of the new settlement at
Port Darwin as well as the occupation of those large tracts in
the interior which are suitable for pastoral occupation".*</p>

House of Assembly. See also no 38, 1870-1, both Houses.
Correspondence finally fixing Port Darwin as terminus of cable
from Europe.]</p>
<p>Four days after the reception of the company's acceptance of
this offer, the government rushed a Construction Act through both
houses, the "house of review" doing its part at a single sitting.
Within the next month contracts were duly let for the three
sections into which the line was divided. A year later, news
reached Adelaide that the contractors for the northern section
had failed. The energetic Todd was sent to fill the gap; he did
it, but the total cost mounted up to £420,720, more than
£300,000 above the first estimate. The line was completed
by 22 August 1872. The cable company, as Adelaide no doubt
expected, saved itself the expense of a cable between Port Darwin
and Burketown, so that the province secured "the monopoly which",
so she said, "South Australia had scarcely coveted and certainly
has not striven for".</p>
<p>Power to send messages at a shilling a word from Adelaide to
Port Darwin did not, however, solve the Territory's problem. More
formidable obstacles to tropical agriculture remained in the
climate, soil and lack of labour in North Australia. Post holes
for the telegraph line revealed gold at Pine Creek in 1871, and
in the following year there was an attempt to mine by companies
there. But costs were phenomenal, and men would not stay save at
such high wages that "ounce stone" showed no margin of profit. The
heat was terrific. Chinese coolies were brought from Singapore to
work for the companies, but these collapsed and the coolies tried
their luck at mining for themselves in a primitive fashion along
the Margaret. They were "a poor diseased lot of creatures",
pirates and port riff-raff. Gold had brought no permanent white
settlement.</p>
<p>Perhaps a transcontinental railway would bring the settlers.
As far back as 1862 a Port Augusta Overland Railway Act had
authorized the government to negotiate for an overland railway to
be built on the land-grant principle.** No effective offer to do
so was made during the five years of the Act's currency. Talk of
state construction arose in 1877, but parliamentary opinion was
almost unanimous that the Territory must first be developed and
made prosperous by coloured labour before anything so ambitious
as a railway were undertaken. A Northern Territory Immigration
Act passed in 1879 failed to obtain the Queen's assent. The
Indian Government had made representations that the provision it
contained for the welfare of coolies was inadequate. That
government stipulated that such a measure should protect Indian
coolies through an officer responsible to itself. In 1882 a
further Act embodied this principle, and in the year following
the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway Act authorizing state
construction passed both Adelaide houses amid enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="foot">[** H. A. Parsons, <i>The Truth about the
Northern Territory, Adelaide</i>, 1907, <i>passim</i>.]</p>
<p>Little came of all this. Drought and financial stringency tied
the Adelaide Government's hands. Opinion in other colonies was
very adverse to the introduction of coloured labour. The Indian
Government waited for the appointment of the protector
responsible to itself before it would permit the recruiting of
coolies. In 1887 the Pine Creek Railway was begun with Chinese
coolies. It made no difference. The country along the line was as
empty when it was finished as before it was begun. The Chinese
had been brought under indentures for railway building and
"evaporated" when it was built. A southern section from Marree
above Port Augusta was built as far north as Oodnadatta, 688
miles from Adelaide, between 1878 and 1891, when once more lack
of loan funds called a halt. A gap of 1063 miles remained.</p>
<p>The advocates of tropical agriculture as the key to the
development of the North were not silenced, though plantations
failed through neglect at Delissaville in 1882, at Manton Hill on
the Adelaide River in 1884 and at Shoal Bay from 1885 to 1890.
Sugar-cane, coffee plants and rubber trees throve despite long
periods of neglect. This was true, but men will not tend tropical
plantations which cost more than they produce. Some still argued
that cheap indentured labour would show a margin of profit, but
others pointed to the poor soils of the Territory, mainly
weathered from sterile sandstones and watered by summer rains
alone. Why should men cultivate these in preference to the
Queensland coastal strip, whose richer patches enjoyed rains at
all seasons?</p>
<p>The dream of tropical agriculture by means of coloured labour
faded as federation dawned. Queensland planters, on the defensive
against the new political labour movement in North Queensland,
offered to transfer their mills to the Territory if guaranteed
coloured labour for twenty-one years. The Chief Secretary shook
his head. In the coming Federal Parliament both houses were to be
elected by the widest suffrage.</p>
<p>Federation meant stagnation to the Northern Territory so long
as the state of South Australia continued to administer its
scanty affairs. It was an empty land. There was a port in outline
at Darwin. A few Chinese fossicked for gold. The population had
been 5366 in 1890: in 1909 it was 3538. Cattle exports had
expanded from 20,495 to over 100,000 a year during that period.
But what was such a trade as a basis of taxation to provide
interest on a debt of £2,748,063? In 1909 South Australia
washed her hands of the business with relief. "It is obvious",
wrote H. A. Parsons, "that it will not pay to grow any tropical
products in the Northern Territory with white labour for export
in competition with the productions by coloured labour of other
countries". But though leaders might be concerned about the empty
North, the man in the street was little interested in a place
"not on his map". Throughout federated Australia men acquiesced
in the restriction of settlement and industry to areas and
enterprises which would provide white Australians with a defined
and state-guaranteed standard of living. To the realists this was
the substance of the White Australia decreed by the
Commonwealth.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI<br>
<br>
The Origins and Extension of Wage-Fixing</h3>
<br>
<p>"<small>SYDNEY</small> or the bush!" cries the Australian when
he gambles against odds, and the slogan betrays a heart turning
ever towards the pleasant coastal capitals. But the percentage
who found industrial employment&mdash;predominantly a city
category&mdash;diminished after the bank smash from 30.7 in 1891
to 26.1 in 1901. Building and construction work in and around the
cities were dead. Factories cut down their staffs. Bush-venturing
on farms and alluvial diggings had a fresh innings; but there
were still too many in the towns. Trade unions fell to pieces or
stood shrunken and powerless. Their defeats in the early
'nineties, attributed by their leaders to class-antagonism in
high places, had borne witness to Lane's foresight in trying to
unite town and country labour and to bring unskilled as well as
skilled men within his Australian Labour Federation. For their
deadliest foes during the struggle had been the as yet
unorganized labourers. Yet unionists knew full well it was the
scabs' poverty, not their will, which had made them consent to
fight capital's battle.</p>
<p>The solution, said Spence, was to spread trade unionism
throughout the length and breadth of Australia. On the old lines
of craft benefit societies this would take time and long
endeavour. The "new" way of propaganda by strikes had not
prospered. Political action would cost less. The traditions of
British unionism were against it, but Graham Berry in 1884 had
advised the second Intercolonial Trade Union Conference to "make
labour's voice heard in the councils of the nation". The
Conference had contented itself with a parliamentary committee,
to watch over the passage of measures beneficial to labour.
During and after the great maritime and pastoral strikes,
however, friend and foe alike bade them regard the ballot as the
proper means of righting wrongs, and in the bitter hours of
weakness and isolation Labour took up this challenge and
resolved to send artisans to speak for artisans, miners to
represent miners. These might some day seize the machinery of
government which had beaten them down.</p>
<p>In New South Wales, members of the Legislative Assembly were
to be paid for the first time after the election of 1891. With
energy unimpaired by poverty, the unionists formed Labour
Electoral Leagues and enlisted such general support that
thirty-six of the forty-five candidates endorsed by the Trade
Union Council won seats in Parliament. To the gifted
correspondent of <i>The Times</i>* the new party might seem
cursed with "inept chatterers at the head and larrikins at the
tail", but her appraising eye valued highly its main ranks of
determined men who resented unearned vicissitudes of pay and
living. As yet they had no leader, no policy that they could call
their own, and their ways in Parliament were clumsy.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Miss Flora Shaw, afterwards Lady Lugard, in
her <i>Letters from Queensland</i> (1894)]</p>
<p>Sir Henry Parkes, a man of the people leading his fifth
government, accepted their support but found it
irksome&mdash;"given after a manner of their own, as an
ungracious man gives charity". In October 1891 he refused to
proceed with a Coal Mines Regulation Bill because his allies had
thrust into it a clause making eight hours the legal day's work
underground. One of his lieutenants harped upon supply and
demand. "That", retorted a mining member, Fegan of Newcastle, "is
a principle we do not recognize and in the opinion of all readers
and thinkers it will not survive very long." Parkes gave up
office for the last time rather than enact restriction. With
leonine mien and, his surprising high voice, the old statesman
bade the defiance of his generation to the new power.
"Civilization would lose its charm and value if it did not
lighten the burden of the masses of humanity. But I distinguish
very broadly between eight hours being sufficient for a man to
labour and Parliament presuming to say how many hours he shall
labour. The working classes of this country are sufficiently
strong to make good&mdash;indeed they have made good&mdash;their
right to work eight hours without asking Parliament to exercise a
power which in all moral justice it does not possess . . .
Tyranny is an arbitrary interference with your fellow-men and
whether it is in the guise of a trade-union or the edict of an
autocrat it is tyranny just the same."</p>
<p>His successor, Sir George Dibbs, broke up the inexperienced
Labour group by raising the fiscal issue. Their ranks were
further torn by recriminations over the very pledge of solidarity
in the division lobby by which they sought to close them. The
party's candidates fared badly at the elections of 1894 and 1895.
A leading member, Joseph Cook, joined Reid's free-trade ministry
as Postmaster-General. Yet the main body regained the balance of
power in 1895, and when, after five years fruitful of liberal
reforms, Reid demurred at further concessions in return for
support, it nipped in the bud his ambition to be first Federal
Prime Minister. Then it proceeded to squeeze a protectionist
ministry under William Lyne.</p>
<p>The Labour Party had in these years learned much. From being
"an impotent group of hysterical, blocking, unpopular
intransigents", it had become "a compact body of artful
parliamentarians who knew how to drain the last drop of reluctant
honey from the Reidite hive".** But it was still fumbling in
search of a distinctive programme. In January 1895 the
"Solidarities", as the core of the party called themselves,
adopted six new planks at the Political Labour League Conference.
The first urged extension of government ownership and operation
of "such works as railways, tramways, water-supply, public
lighting or other works for the good of the community". After
such extension their parliamentary power might dictate the
improvement of wages and working conditions for all state
employees. The sixth new plank was "Compulsory Arbitration ".</p>
<p class="foot">[** T. A. Coghlan, <i>Labour and Industry in
Australia</i>, p. 218.]</p>
<p>This plank told of a changing balance of power both in the
political and in the economic spheres. Unionists foresaw the
coming of governments unlike those which had outlawed them in
1890 and 1891, and the prospect has softened the antagonism of
miners and shearers to government intervention in industrial
disputes. But it was with reluctance that they admitted the claim
of the community to be the dominant party in such disputes.
Lane's and Spence's federated unions had practised negotiation
with the employers, though rather as an art of bluffing enemies
than as an adjustment of sound relations between partners in a
joint service of the public. They had relied, on the strike as
the final arbiter in the war of the classes.*** But the
association in point of time of the great strikes with the
looming of financial chaos had made the strike weapon profoundly
unpopular throughout the land. Everywhere men discussed plans of
public action to prevent the appeal to force. Should public
intervention take the form of conciliation&mdash;the good offices
of disinterested men, nominated and paid by the state&mdash;or of
compulsory arbitration after the fashion of the criminal courts
enforcing the king's peace? Till 1894 all such proposals were
coolly received by miners and shearers as well as by employers.
The latter thought any state action likely to tie their hands
lately freed, as they imagined, by the victory of "freedom of
contract". The unions still thought themselves equal to renewing
the battle.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** In W. G. Spence's <i>Australia's
Awakening</i>, ch. <small>XXXII</small>, "Trade Unionism", may be
read the old leader's naïve advice to union negotiators. It
would be amusing if it were not so sinister in ignoring the need
of sound principles.]</p>
<p>The trend of prices, however, was strongly against the men.
Without consulting the A.W.U., the Pastoralists' Federal Council
imposed in 1894 a new agreement, reducing the piece-rate to
17<i>s</i>. per hundred for machine-shorn sheep, and making each
pastoralist sole interpreter of his agreement with shearers. The
union leaders, powerless to say them nay, tried to save their own
faces by a conference. The pastoralists refused it. Into strike
camp went the shearers, as in the brave days of Lane. The
station-owners promptly fetched non-unionists by the hundred from
Victoria, Tasmania and New Zealand and filled the stands. Riots
flared here and there. A river-steamer, the 'Rodney', carrying
non-unionists up the Darling, was burned to the water's edge at
Pooncarie. Wool-sheds, too, were burned at Ayrshire Downs,
Cambridge Downs, Cassilis, Manuka and Dagworth in Queensland.*
The Nelson government therefore proclaimed a state of
insurrection and the camps scattered.</p>
<p class="foot">[* M. M. Bennett, <i>Christison of
Lammermoor</i>, pp. 193-200, 215. The note on p. 197 refers to
the strike of 1891.]</p>
<p>In New South Wales, while the commotion still boiled,
Williams, the A.W.U. President, appealed to the new Premier, G.
H. Reid, to compel the disputants to confer. Reid asked first for
a guarantee that disorder would cease. It was not given. An
elaborate offer by the A.W.U. to settle on the wages of 1891, and
individual bargains at the sheds on other matters, drew the
scornful rejoinder from the pastoralists that "as it has already
appeared in the newspapers it calls for no further reply". The
union's funds ran low, and supplies of non-unionists were
inexhaustible. Its own men left the strike camps to find work on
the pastoralists' terms at other sheds. The strike died out.</p>
<p>It was after this experience of supply and demand that the
A.W.U. joined in adopting "Compulsory Arbitration" as a Labour
plank. Its own rough power to impose "restrictive conditions on
the trade, business or industry of the members" having waned, it
sought the aid of the state's power of legal compulsion. Ever
since 1891 Charles Cameron Kingston, a South Australian radical
intimate with Labour, had pleaded for a compulsory registration
of unions of employers and employed and for the enforced
reference of their differences to a "Court". In 1894, after three
abortive attempts, he succeeded in carrying through the South
Australian Houses a Conciliation and Arbitration Act embodying,
though ineffectively, this principle of compulsion. The awards of
the State Board were only to bind the parties to the dispute
submitted to it.</p>
<p>Kingston's compulsory arbitration in the name of industrial
peace, adopted in 1895 by the New South Wales Labour Party as a
new plank, became at once an important issue in Australian
politics, second only to that of the federation which was to
prepare a wider scope for its triumphs. Reid fell from the height
of his power because he would not grant the new province to law
and order.** He was willing to compel the parties to a dispute to
confer, but would not enact the legal enforcement of an
arbitrator's award.</p>
<p class="foot">[** T. A. Coghlan, <i>Labour and Industry in

<p>For five years after Labour's conversion opinion among
employers remained adverse. Reid's mild Bill in 1895 for
compulsory conferences seemed to the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>
"extreme and one-sided legislation calling new and highly unfair
powers into existence". The Legislative Council gave its second
reading short shrift by thirty votes to one. But in 1896 a
renewal of turmoil at the Newcastle coal mines preyed upon the
public's nerves. Victoria had set up minimum wages boards in that
year. New Zealand also had set up a compulsory arbitration court
as the coping stone of a system of state conciliation. That was
the year, too, in which the sinking prices which had troubled the
economic world since 1873 touched bottom. Unconscious that a
heavier gold production was at last causing buoyant markets, men
readily attributed success, to the experiments in. New Zealand
and Victoria. A commendation of the New Zealand Court by the
Chairman of the Union Steamship Company,*** the leading employer
of that colony, did much to persuade Sydney to acquiesce in an
extension of the experiment to New South Wales. When Bernard
Ringrose Wise, Lyne's Attorney-General, introduced his
Arbitration and Conciliation Bill in 1900, he put it forward as
"an experiment designed to overcome evils the gravity of which we
are fully acquainted with, and which cannot possibly bring in its
train other evils at all equal to those it is intended to do away
with". Labour and middle-class opinion applauded his optimism
when he asserted: "There cannot be a strike under this bill.
There may be disputes but, there cannot be any interruption of
industry". The Legislative Councillors were not so sure, but in
the calm after the campaigns for federation they let it pass.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Mr (afterwards Sir James) Mills was reported
by the <i>Sydney Daily Telegraph</i>, 3 July 1899, to have said:
"I think this method of settling disputes is, on the whole,
satisfactory. Under the operation of the Act the parties can meet
together and after a little discussion the strength of each case
can be pretty well judged".]</p>
<p>To attain industrial peace, that heaven of all men's wish,
Wise's Act of 1901 went further than Pember Reeves' New Zealand
variant on Kingston. The New Zealand measure prohibited strikes
and lock-outs only when one party to a dispute had appealed to
the Arbitration Court and while the appeal was pending. The
element of legal compulsion came in ostensibly as a last resort,
a weapon in reserve when the parties would not agree upon a
settlement. The whole purport of the New Zealand Act was to lay
emphasis on conciliation&mdash;the original aim of all this
legislation. Collective bargaining, through innumerable brains,
would continue to adjust the flux of prices and terms in which
the values of men's services to one another were registered from
day to day. But events did not work out thus, even in New
Zealand. Disputants often brushed aside the boards of
conciliation and sought to present an unprejudiced case before
the bench armed with compelling power. Let the Court make their
collective bargains for them.</p>
<p>This subtle but all-important change in the atmosphere of
business was not lost on the sensitive brain of Wise. In a colony
where, as he thought, it seemed "a permanent condition of
industrial enterprises that there shall be a perpetual liability
to industrial strikes", his Act unconditionally prohibited
strikes and lock-outs pending consideration of every dispute by
the Court. By it a strike or lock-out became a misdemeanour
against society. It was immaterial whether the parties applied
for an award or no. Existing terms and conditions of employment
could not be disturbed at the will of one party alone. With one
sweep the New South Wales Arbitration Court threw its sanction
over the terms upon which, when the Act came into force, men were
employing and serving one another. The assumption, implicit in
the New Zealand Act, that a legal tribunal was competent to
direct every needed adjustment in the conduct of business and
that at its bidding peace would bless the Court's decision,
became more positive in New South Wales. The Supreme Court,
possibly with raised eyebrows, ruled that the Arbitration Act
"deprives the employer of the conduct of his own business and
vests the management in the tribunal formed under the Act".</p>
<p>Victoria was not so bold. There "union rates and conditions",
though still proclaimed, were hopeless of achievement by
industrial action and the Labour group in Parliament was weaker.
Its sway of the balance in the Assembly was enough, however, to
exact from Turner the establishment of minimum wages boards.
Their machinery was simple, their aim immediate. The helpless
poor congregated in Melbourne after the collapse of the boom were
being exploited as out-workers by clothing and other
manufacturers. Factory laws were no new thing in Victoria, though
they had not yet regulated wages. As early as 1882, <i>The
Age</i> had been shocked to find low wages and evil conditions in
the protected industries it had fought so hard to rear. An
Amending Factory Act of 1885 had prescribed better conditions of
space, sanitation and safety, and had set public inspectors to
enforce them. Probably a House of Lords investigation into the
sub-letting of piecework at "sweated" rates to East London
home-workers gave the Victorian Labour leaders their fresh cue in
1895. A sharp agitation by <i>The Age</i> against sweating,
understood more widely as home-working, was answered by evidence
that such work was all too general in the overpopulated capital
and too essential in eking out family subsistence to be declared
illegal. The Legislative Council and Assembly conferred and
agreed upon (i) the establishment of minimum wages boards
representing both sides under official chairmen, to fix legal
piece and time-wages in the clothing, furniture, baking and
butchering trades, (ii) the making of a register of home-workers,
and (iii) "policing of wages board determinations by the official
factory inspectors. Though modelled on conciliation boards, the
new machinery was not explicitly directed against strikes; the
Act did not declare them illegal. The home-workers were too
helpless to fight. No dispute or threat of a dispute was needed
to call a board into existence. Nor did the Act require the
incorporation of industrial unions of employers and employees as
juristic units for a formal litigation, as the Acts inspired by
Kingston did. The boards brought representative employers and
employed face to face in order to set up limits below which the
state might forbid the purchase of service at prices which
offended public opinion.</p>
<p>The new method did, however, promote labour organisation in
providing for regular negotiation. The election of
representatives to sit on the boards brought scattered workers
together, and thus eliminated any weakness due only to their
dwelling apart. Its piecemeal extension waited upon the ripening
of opportunities. A resolution of either House of the Legislature
might create a fresh board. For a time the enforcement of
determinations was dubious. The task was hardest in the furniture
trade where Chinese masters and men were too inscrutable for the
inspectors. But the danger that the determinations might restrict
employment was offset by rising prices, and by the exodus, mostly
to the goldfields, of 63,582 Victorians, of whom 39,805 were
males, during the quinquennium 1896-1900. The first fear of
wage-fixing quickly faded. Of thirty-eight boards established
prior to 1906 eleven had been applied for by employers, the best
of whom welcomed restraint upon hard taskmasters. An attempt in
1904 to limit the boards' option in defining minimum wages to the
average paid by "reputable employers" proved short-lived; it was
abandoned two years later. The average is not always divine.
Boards numbered 186 at the end of 1927. The only check upon their
determinations was a Court of Industrial Appeals which might
review and upset determinations not legally arrived at, and
exercise for the nonce all or any of a board's powers.</p>
<p>William Lane had endowed the Queensland Labour Party with an
early strength which was to carry it to the ministerial benches
even before federation. Before he set out for his New Australia
in Paraguay, Labour was represented by fifteen members in the
Assembly (1893). Yet the very success of Labour in elbowing aside
the radical party and taking from the first the direct opposition
benches put out of possibility the fruitful method of "support in
return for concessions" pursued in the southern colonies. As a
result, legislation to set up industrial courts made a slow start
in Queensland. Elsewhere such laws were the work of individual
Liberal leaders, such as C. C. Kingston, Pember Reeves, B. R.
Wise and Alexander Peacock, rather than of Labour conventions or
caucus. For six years the Queensland Labour Party gained nothing
but parliamentary experience in a hard school. Then, on 1
December 1899, they had the honour to form the first Labour
Government, under Anderson Dawson. It held office for only six
days. In 1908 a coalition ministry, led by William Kidston, who
had been Dawson's Treasurer, but was no longer a Labour leader,
adopted the Victorian Wages Boards (8 Ed. <small>VII</small>, No.
8) and to these in 1912 a Liberal Government added a Court of
Industrial Appeals by an Industrial Peace Act (3 <small>G.
V</small>, No. 12). On its accession to power in 1915, the Labour
Party lost little time in exchanging the wages board method for a
Court of Industrial Arbitration (1916). Of the less populous
states, Tasmania and Western Australia, the former has followed
the Victorian Wages Board methods, while Western Australia has
made consistent use of a Court of Arbitration, first successfully
established in 1902. Its supervision of apprenticeship has been
notably thorough and sound under the care of W. Somerville, the
workers' representative since 1903.</p>
<p>After 1907, in a Commonwealth tribunal, a greater man than
Kingston had elaborated a principle of wage-fixation which led
boards and courts alike to interpret the wage-earners' share in
production as a sacrosanct family maintenance. An American
observer who reviewed the Australian Labour movement in 1906
found in it "something of the Chinese jealousy of the outside
world, of the parochial spirit extended to a continent",* and
held that this weakened its moral appeal. In 1907, however, a
Judge of the High Court of Australia, presiding over a Federal
Arbitration Court, took high moral ground in claiming for the
workers a wage independent of supply and demand. A glow of
idealism warmed what had seemed a class egoism. Aided by many
outside the union ranks, Labour rose to power in both states and
Commonwealth, expecting and expected to reconstruct the
Australian economy on the firm basis of a legal living wage.</p>
<p class="foot">[* V. S. Clark, <i>op. cit</i>. p. 291.]</p>
<p>The Convention which drafted the Commonwealth Constitution had
inserted among the subjects with respect to which the new
legislature might make laws for the peace, order and government
of Australia "Conciliation and arbitration for the prevention and
settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of
any one State".** The regulation of industry remained a state
responsibility, but memories of the great strikes and of the dark
days that had followed had bitten deep. Men reasoned that the new
Government alone could wield effective powers to stop the
paralysis of callings such as the pastoral, which knew no state
boundaries, and the maritime, the ships of which plied beyond
them. Out of a stormy passage through the Federal Legislature
there emerged in 1904 a Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration
Act. Three Federal ministries had died during the drafting of its
provisions, and the decisions and personnel of the Court it
called into being soon became the main matter of political
argument throughout the Commonwealth. Here Labour found its
programme.</p>
<p class="foot">[** Constitution. Act, section 51, subsection
<small>XXXV</small>. As to the hesitation over the insertion of
this subsection, see G. Anderson, <i>Fixation of Wages in
Australia</i>, pp. 128-9, a very valuable work of reference.]</p>
<p>Henry Bournes Higgins, as Convention delegate and as
legislator, had been chiefly responsible for the creation of the
Court, and, by renovating as a novel extension of democratic
jurisprudence the mediaeval ideal of the just price, he was now
to show the Labour Party the path it had sought by which those on
whom had fallen the sharpest pains of adversity might reach a
just and reasonable security. The ideal, transmuting the old
rations habit and the instinctive solidarity of men facing a
trying climate, soon caught the national imagination.</p>
<p>Immediately on his appointment in 1907 as second President of
the Court, Mr Justice Higgins had to decide whether the wages and
conditions of work in H. V. McKay's harvester factory could be
held "fair and reasonable" and could thereby entitle its products
to exemption from the excise duties imposed by a new Excise
Tariff Act (No. 16 of 1906).*** The learned judge reasoned that,
as the Act offered exemption from excise duties to those
employers who paid "fair and reasonable" wages, it must mean by
these words something more than the level set by the "barbarous"
higgling of the market. He decided that "the primary test in
ascertaining the minimum wage that would be treated as 'fair and
reasonable' in the case of unskilled labourers" must be "the
normal needs of the average employee, regarded as a human being
living in a civilised community". After some inquiries into the
costs of a workman's household of about five persons, he named
7<i>s</i>. a day, 42<i>s</i>. a week, as the lowest wages that he
could certify to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** See H. B. Higgins, <i>A New Province for Law
and Order, passim</i>; 2 <i>Commonwealth Arbitration Reports</i>,
p. 1; G. Anderson, <i>op. cit</i>. pp. 188 <i>et seq</i>.]</p>
<p>The Excise Act was soon afterwards held to be invalid on
constitutional grounds; it was beyond the powers entrusted to the
Federal Legislature. But the "Harvester judgment" could not be
expunged from men's minds. It was acclaimed at once as the much
sought <i>eirenicon</i>, the way of industrial peace for which
arbitrators and boards had so long been groping. The tide of
opinion, which had been running in favour of wages boards as
being less provocative of "disputes", turned again towards Courts
of Arbitration. New South Wales, after changing in 1908 to a
wages boards plan, returned to a mixed one of courts and boards
in 1912. Several state legislatures embodied in their industrial
codes the inspiring words "the normal needs of a human being
living in a civilised community"&mdash;with local variants. Yet
the nation-wide realization of this standard by state tribunals
was hampered by fear of inter-state competition, a fear which
could not be laid as long as any important state, such as
Victoria, failed to impose the new doctrine on its wage-fixing
tribunals.</p>
<p>The power of the Federal Court to enforce as well as proclaim
the <i>eirenicon</i> was limited. It could hear only the parties
to disputes extending beyond any one state. Unions with
inter-state affiliations could overcome that limit by extending
their disputes. But the capacity of the federal tribunal to hear
parties was also finite, and the High Court, as interpreters of
the Constitution, restrained its action. An award bound only the
parties to the specific dispute, and could not be made a common
rule. Sometimes it was practicable with the aid of the six
Australian directories to cite every employer in every state as a
respondent; but this was at all times costly. For fourteen years
(1906 to 1920) it was held by the High Court that the
Commonwealth Arbitration power did not extend to fixing the wages
and conditions of employees on the railways and other industrial
activities owned by the state (i.e. provincial) governments.
These, thought the majority of the High Court Justices, were
state instrumentalities. To control them, it was then held, would
be inconsistent with the freedom and financial responsibility of
the states.* Awkward situations arose, too, from the overlapping
of state and federal jurisdictions and the zeal of employees to
make the rival courts compete to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p class="foot">[* An article in the <i>Round Table</i>, vol.
<small>II</small>, pp. 358 <i>et seq</i>., written in 1911,
indicates that the reversal of decisions restraining the federal
control of industry was expected almost as soon as those
decisions were given.]</p>
<p>Four times federal ministries have appealed to the nation to
confirm by popular vote constitutional amendments designed to
give the Commonwealth more control over industry. The reasons for
the repeated rejection of such proposals, though made by
governments of all the political colours, are matters for
political rather than economic history. The fact of rejection has
made the process of re-shaping wage-standards to the ideal of
fairness and reason a complex and litigious business. Yet both
the process and the ideal have grown in strength.</p>
<p>At the time of its promulgation the Harvester wage of
42<i>s</i>. was a bold step forward. Its general adoption
promised relative plenty to those who had come through great
tribulation. In 1907 unskilled men in regular employment were
getting, on an average, 33<i>s</i>. a week. Some wages boards had
fixed 30<i>s</i>. a week as the minimum. Carters and drivers were
getting 25<i>s</i>. for a week of 56 hours. The advance was
consolidated between 1907 and 1914 by two out-works of federal
and state regulation. One was the inclusion in the awards of
grades higher than the unskilled day labourer. The other was the
adjustment of the wages legally awarded so that they should be
fixed real wages, not mere nominal wages stated in a money whose
value was falling.</p>
<p>The Victorian boards, set up as a means to prevent sweating,
were originally confined to the tasks of defining the minimum
wage and conditions of apprenticeship. But the power to fix wages
implied power to fix overtime rates and so by further implication
the length of the working day. Their determinations,
nevertheless, were of the baldest simplicity. The Arbitration
Courts, interpreting more boldly their mission to settle
disputes, felt impelled to lay down not only the "basic wage", as
"a wage below which employers ought to be forbidden by the State
to employ its citizens who are labourers",** but also to
safeguard the advantages of the skilled men by awarding
"secondary wages" or margins for skill. The fear of discontent
was held to justify awards of the same basic wage in different
industries, on the ground that unequal wages were "anomalies over
which men brood". That extended it laterally to labourers in all
industries. In other awards that fear did not prevent the grant
of generous margins to machinists of high specialization "however
much specialization tends to monotony, to industrial discontent".
This set up a competition for margins. The conception of the
margin for skill was joined with that of "just minimum time
wages" in finding a fair and reasonable piece-rate for shearers.
"Having found that the shearer should, as a 'skilled worker', get
a net wage of £3 per week for the time of his expedition to
the sheep stations to shear, and that a rate of 24<i>s</i>. per
hundred sheep would give this net result, the Court fixed
24<i>s</i>. per hundred as the minimum piece-rate. Allowances had
to be made for days of travelling and waiting, expenses en route,
cost of mess, and combs and cutters".***</p>

Case</i>, 1916, 10 <i>C.A.R</i>. pp. 482-4.]</p>

Order, p. 54, and 5 <i>C.A.R.</i> p. 48. The Shearers' awards
have greatly raised the standards of accommodation at the
wool-sheds and "men's huts" on the stations.]</p>
<p>The threat of industrial discontent was a trump card in this
process of extending the sway of judicial arbitration over all
wages, conditions and hours of labour. At times the second
President resisted the finer drawn distinctions by which union
advocates claimed secondary wages for "skilled labourers" or for
the handling of special cargoes by wharf-lumpers.**** But the
dripping of water wears away the hardest stone and, whatever
propagandists may cry from the house tops, they know full well
that arbitration judges' hearts are not of stone. Concessions
once made are with difficulty reviewed, even when anomalies
arise. Unpopular awards have been withdrawn more than once "for
the sake of industrial peace", under threat or actual pressure of
strikes.*****</p>
<p class="foot">[**** See G. Anderson, <i>Fixation of Wages</i>,
pp. 322-7, 359. In 1914 Mr Justice Higgins was led to remark in a
Waterside Workers' Case: "The grounds on which special rates are
claimed seem to be as numerous and varied as the well-known
excuses for drinking beer. . . . The union now claims a list of
some 30 special cargoes and in this are included case-oil,
log-timber, pig-iron and even ballast".]</p>

The position in regard to the adoption of an extended system of
payment by results in Australia is worse today than it was before
Judge Beeby's award, for there has been a trial of strength
between the unions and the Court, and the unions have won". Cf.
Higgins, J., on p. 472.]</p>
<p>The Arbitration Courts have been led on, pushed on, and drawn
into an increasingly elaborate rule over industry very widely
defined. Men may be expected to discover and brood over anomalies
when benevolent justice may thus be moved to essay their
correction. But industry and commerce are very complicated, and
one may in recent years mark a weariness in the economic Titans
of the Court. Surely, they plead, margins for skill are fit
matters for settlement by masters and men according to changing
needs, and might not some mechanics be paid for what they do? The
unions frown on all this.</p>
<p>Awards not only became more inclusive, but as Mr Justice
Higgins warmed to his life-work they took on a scientific method
of remaining the same. A wage which was intended to cover a
labourer's household needs could not do so if it remained
unchanged while prices rose. Until 1912 no exact measurement of
the rise in prices was ready to the Court's hand, but in that
year the Commonwealth Statistician, Mr (afterwards Sir) G. H.
Knibbs, put forth "certain curious and interesting figures, the
result of much valuable research and compilation".* These were
index-numbers designed to measure the purchasing power of money
over a composite unit of commodities, derived from the aggregate
expenditure of Australians on certain household necessaries. From
1913 the Federal Court has made use of the index-numbers in
finding, by rule of three, the "Harvester wage equivalent", i.e.
the sum of money capable of purchasing at current prices what
42<i>s</i>. purchased in 1907.**</p>
<p class="foot">[* The description is Mr Justice Higgins' first
reference to them. See <i>Labour Report of the Bureau of
Statistics</i>, no. <small>I</small> (1912), "Prices Price
Indexes and Cost of Living in Australia as to the "weighting" of
the standard articles of consumption included. In G. Anderson
<i>op. cit</i>. p. 229, may be found an account of the
precautions to ensure their accuracy, by C. H. Wickens.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** After April 1923 the Court made a regular
practice of inserting in awards a clause providing for quarterly
adjustments in accordance with the "cost-of-living
index-numbers".]</p>
<p>Thus through all the vicissitudes of war and post-war prices,
those who drew the basic wage were secure of their real wages, of
the normal needs of the average employee regarded as a human
being, so far as the Harvester judgment covered those needs. It
may be hard to regard that average as divine, but it has
certainly been placed, so far as laws can do it, upon a pedestal
of privilege. When prices were rising rapidly after the war, the
third President added 3<i>s</i>. a week to the "Harvester
equivalent" in order, as he said, "to secure at least to the
workers the living wage adopted by the Court, whatever increase
in the cost of living there may be in any quarter". This
shock-absorber, known as "Powers' Three Shillings", has been
retained in almost all subsequent awards, both when prices were
falling and when they were rising.</p>
<p>Yet the wage-earners have been beset by doubts whether the
"Harvester equivalent" really did provide for the normal needs of
the average employee. When during the war clothing prices were
rising more rapidly than those of foodstuffs and rents, the
complaint arose that the aggregate expenditure on which the
Commonwealth Statistician based his index-numbers did not include
clothing. Under war conditions the effect was that Knibbs'
index-numbers understated the change in the purchasing power of
money. Their use assumed that the prices of items omitted were
varying <i>pari passu</i> with those of the items included. By
the time the ingenious officials in the Bureau of Statistics had
provided index-numbers based on total household expenditure,
including clothing and miscellaneous items, the relative levels
had altered. The inclusion of clothing was then found to result
in index-numbers substantially lower than those calculated on the
original basis.*** Prices of clothing in Sydney, according to the
Bureau, increased only 24 per cent. between 1914 and 1927. Those
of food, groceries and housing had gone up by 53 per cent. Under
these circumstances the doubts of union advocates as to the
adequacy of Sir George Knibbs' original indices were waived.
Their clients had been at some disadvantage while clothing prices
ruled higher, but since 1921 they had made greater gains by the
Court's continued use of the index-numbers based on food,
groceries and housing only. And these, after all, are the
<i>normal</i> needs of the average employee.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>Commonwealth Year Book</i>, no. 20
(1927), ch. <small>XIII</small>, especially pp. 520-1. But cf. J.
L. K. Gifford, <i>Economic Statistics for Arbitration Courts</i>,
pp. 24 <i>et seq</i>.]</p>
<p>Critics delving for a richer content in the doctrine of the
sacrosanct wage next turned their attention to Mr Justice
Higgins' original finding. Did it in very truth cover the needs
of a family of five persons? "Treating marriage as the usual fate
of adult men", wrote the learned President in 1915, "a wage which
does not allow of the matrimonial condition and the maintenance
of about five persons in a home would not be treated as a living
wage". It was not hard to show, however, that the Harvester
judgment of 1907 had been based on very meagre evidence furnished
by nine housewives and a few tradesmen. It had embodied as much
the wages policy of the best employers as "the normal needs" of
the average working-class family. To allay these new doubts, Mr.
W. M. Hughes, protesting that it had been settled "long ago" that
such a basic wage should be paid as would enable a man to marry
and rear a family under decent, wholesome conditions, appointed
in December 1919 a Royal Commission on the Basic Wage. It
consisted of representatives of employers and employees and was
asked to determine the "ordinary expenditure of a household of
five", its cost, and how the basic wage should be automatically
adjusted to changes in that cost.</p>
<p>The Commission took much evidence. It made out "indicator
lists" of food adequate to the most scientific dietetic scale, of
clothing good in wearing quality and of sound workmanship. It
decided that a five-roomed house, in sound tenantable condition,
not cramped as to allotment, in decent surroundings and provided
with bath, copper and tubs, set in, was the "fair thing" for a
man on the basic wage. Then it totted up the prices and found
that for such requirements the basic wage in Sydney, November
1920, ought to be £5. 17<i>s</i>., and in other capitals
similar amounts ranging down to £5. 6<i>s</i>. 3<i>d</i>.
in Brisbane. The "Harvester equivalent" on which Federal and
State minima were directly and indirectly based was then
£4. 13<i>s</i>. in Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart, £4.
9<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. in Adelaide and £4. 0<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>. in Brisbane and Perth. The Chairman of the Commission
himself urged that the adoption of its findings would ruin any
industries manufacturing for export, and by raising the costs of
Australia's primary industries would set up a formidable drawback
to their development, perhaps to their continuance. He regarded
the findings as a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the family wage,
based on the needs of a man, wife and three dependent children.
The payment of such wages to all adult male workers would provide
for 2,100,000 non-existent children and nearly half a million
non-existent wives. He made the announcement of the Commission's
findings an opening for propaganda in favour of wages based on
the needs of man and wife only, and of a plan of family
endowment, financed by a levy on industry.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* For Australian developments along these lines
see <i>Report of Royal Commission on Child Endowment or Family
Allowances</i>, 1929, especially pp. 35 <i>et seq</i>. No
industrial court prescribed the basic wage as defined by the
Piddington Commission, but cf. J. L. K. Gifford, <i>op. cit</i>.
p. 44.]</p>
<p>Out of a <i>furore</i> of discussion there became perceptible
the doubts of consumers about the whole dogma of sacrosanct
minima; and all who buy Australian products at home or abroad are
consumers. Was there not need of evidence as to the effects of
such fixed wage-standards on demands for goods and therefore on
demands for labour? Could increased wages be passed on
indefinitely? What of the industries which sold their goods at
the prices ruling in competitive markets? Should not evidence be
gathered of the ability of industries to pay wages? From
Queensland, the hotbed of Australian political ideas, came a
suggestion in 1925 that wages should vary with the productivity
of industry, and that an index of the general capacity of
industry to pay might be compounded in each September from
changes in income per head, past production per head and
estimated future production per head.** Unluckily the President
responsible for the suggestion died suddenly before the
Commission's report had been considered by the Queensland Court.
Changes calculated by rule of thumb have been made in the wages
awarded to workers in industries below and above average
prosperity; but no statistical index of capacity to pay has yet
been adopted.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Report of Economic Commission on the
Queensland Basic Wage</i>, 1925, pp. 66-70. A criticism of the
proposed index as a guide to capacity to pay wages is ably set
forth by J. L. K. Gifford, <i>op. cit</i>. pp. 46 <i>et
seq</i>.]</p>
<p>Even this rule of thumb recognition, however, was a breach in
the rampart of sacrosanctity. In 1909, Mr Justice Higgins ruled
that the Federal Court could not prescribe a lower rate in order
to keep an unprofitable mine going. "If shareholder's are willing
to stake their own, money on a speculation, they should not stake
part of the employee's proper wage also." The propriety of a wage
the legal award of which would abolish their jobs was not plain
to the copper-miners at Wallaroo and Moonta in South Australia in
1921. They entered into an industrial agreement to work, while
the market for copper was low, for less than the basic wage and
the usual margins. This agreement the Federal Court somewhat
reluctantly recognized. <i>Fiat justitia</i> is a high doctrine.
The danger involved is that wage-fixing tribunals may raise their
conception of justice more rapidly than the price which can be
allotted from the joint product of the industry to the
contributors of routine service. Prices, even of routine and
skilled manual service, are ultimately encouragements or
discouragements to persistence in that service. If sacrosanctity
and increase of wages go hand in hand, more may be attracted into
the callings so blessed than can be found regular employment in
them. Fluctuating wages have a social function to perform in
minimizing unemployment and sending labour to Sydney or the
bush.***</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII<br>
<br>
Strength and Protection</h3>
<br>
<p><small>THE</small> three decades of the Commonwealth have
witnessed a remarkable advance by the Australian pastoral and
farming industries in the teeth of natural and imposed handicaps.
In 1901 primary products from the mines, stations, farms and
forests made up 93.8 per cent. of exports worth
£49,696,000. In the decade ending June 1927, though the
mines quota had fallen away, pasture and, agriculture had grown
so strongly that the percentage of primary products among
Australian visible exports had risen to 95.51, in a total value
averaging £125,622,000 per annum. Manufactures, which in
1901 contributed 6 per cent. of the exports, provided barely
4½ per cent in the decade 1917-1927. A full third of
Australia's recorded production is exported&mdash;a proportion
exceeded by few countries *&mdash;and the part of the primary
industries in buying Australia's share in the products of the
world has continued to increase.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Great Britain exports less than 30 per cent of
her production, the United States of America less than 10 per
cent.]</p>
<p>The century dawned on a land seared by the worst and widest
drought the white man has seen. In New South Wales, after six
years of abundant rainfall from 1889 to 1894, eight successive
years of subnormal rainfall culminated in 1902 with a Sahara year
The mean rainfall for the whole state fell below 11.91 inches.
That at Balranald for the first eleven months was 3.65 inches, at
Booligal 2.73, and at Bourke, from January 1 to October 31, 2.44
inches. The colony's flocks, usually about half the Australian
total, shrank from 57,000,000 in 1894 to 26,560,000 in 1902. That
was "The Great Drought".</p>
<p>Queensland, the region of summer rains, fared little better.
The onset was milder, 1895 and 1896 being years of average rains
in most districts though ending badly in the West. Ninety-seven
was a bad year and though 1898 was better, there followed four
years of despair. When the grasses were eaten and the saltbush
was leafless, the best of the sheep and cattle could only be kept
alive by cutting "the mulga". At the sound of an axe the poor
skeletons would come running from every direction. "By the middle
of 1899 trains were running day and night, transferring nearly a
million sheep from the great stations beyond Winton to the
Eastern Tablelands and the coast, on whose coarse unsatisfying
grasses no sheep had been kept since the early sixties".** The
men out West hung on, watching clouds gather, drop a thin shower
and vanish in the night. Months passed; overdrafts mounted.
Though the experienced sold early or knocked on the head all but
their breeding ewes and stud stock, in such a drought heavy
purchases of fodder and costly bores to deep artesian water were
imperative to keep even the remnant alive. "What a lot of money
these pastoralists must make to be able to afford such things!"
said the bush publican to the teamsters. Months dragged out into
years. In 1902 the mean rainfall for the state&mdash;coast and
tablelands thrown in&mdash;was 12.63 inches. Hard frosts cut down
the sugar cane even in the far north. Out West, sheep and cattle,
to save which mortgages had been piled up for years, perished by
the hundred thousand. The live stock in Queensland had numbered
over twenty-seven million in 1894. In 1902 there were barely ten
million.***</p>

Lammermoor</i>, pp. 222-3.]</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>Production Statistics, Bulletin</i>, no.
20, pp. 209-11. In 1894 Queensland depastured 19,587,000 sheep,
7,000,000 cattle and 444,000 horses. In 1902 there were 7,213,000
sheep, 2,540,000 cattle and 399,000 horses. For a graph of the
annual rainfalls see <i>Rainfall Observations in Queensland</i>,
by H. A. Hunt (1914), p. 12.]</p>
<p>Not even Victoria, slowly convalescent from her financial
fever, was spared. Of the eight years 1895 to 1902 only one,
1900, touched the colony's average rainfall and 1902 was the
driest year on record. In "the cabbage garden", as envious old
John Robertson called it, the tally of sheep fell from 13,180,000
in 1894 to 10,841,000 in 1900 and 10,167,000 in 1904&mdash;the
only years in which Victoria felt that she could afford to
collect stock statistics. In South Australia, nine years, 1894 to
1902 inclusive, each saw less than ten inches for the province as
a whole, though the first was a good year in the agricultural
belt east of Spencer's Gulf.* Flocks on South Australian farms
and stations decreased from 7,152,000 in 1892 to 4,880,000 in
1902, cattle from 411,000 to 213,000 and horses from 186,000 to
164,000.</p>

<p>In Western Australia, old prospectors, who in those "dry
'nineties" made forced marches across what is now the Wheat Belt,
find it hard to believe that the changed scene will last. Where
many that they knew died of thirst and all walked in fear of it,
there are now permanent water supplies, and every winter fields
of waving wheat. Long rakes of trucks laden with grain pass, all
summer through and most of winter, along railways to the coast.
Even settlers who, have lived through both the drought and the
wheat-boom shake their heads. They saw the native fauna driven
away by the drought between 1894 and 1902.** Were those dry years
a startling abnormality? The native game have mostly returned to
their old haunts, but will the dry cycle come again too?</p>
<p class="foot">[** See an article "Seasons since 1860", by Bruce
Leake, <i>Western Mail</i>, Perth, W.A. 5 July 1928, p. 42. See
also the comments thereon by G. L. Sutton and E. B.
Curlewis.]</p>
<p>The Great Drought taught the women of "the back blocks" to
listen for that sweetest harmony "the orchestra of rain, the
crashing roar on the iron roof, the deeper roar from the creek,
the music of bull-frogs". The hatchet-faced menfolk who saw it
through are not poetic folk, but they respond surprisingly to
Dorothea Mackellar's</p>
<p class="poem">Core of my heart, my country!<br>
Her pitiless blue sky<br>
When, sick at heart, around us<br>
We see the cattle die&mdash;<br>
But then the grey clouds gather<br>
And we can bless again<br>
The drumming of an army,<br>
The steady soaking rain.</p>
<p>The decades that followed seemed by comparison a run of
exceptionally good seasons broken only by one bad relapse, 1914.
That impression is not, however, supported by the official
rainfall records. A comparison of the "sheep map" of Australia
*** with the rain maps from 1908 to 1928 reveals a four years'
drought from 1912 to 1915 against which large areas of dense
sheep-holding had to provide, and seven years of widespread
deficiency of rainfall between 1918 and 1929. Drought after all
is only a question of degree in the back country. It is the harsh
master who has taught the pastoralists to keep Australia's fame
for fine wool by a ceaseless culling of their flocks. "If you
want to grow the best merino wool in the world", wrote an old
squatter in 1883, "you must stop in this dry land which is
carefully cultivated by Nature with rotation of crops and allowed
to lie fallow periodically&mdash;that means a drought. If you had
no droughts you would not have the best wool in the world and our
sheep would be continually in the hospital as they are in New
Zealand, where the merino sheep does no good. All life is a
gamble and I like to gamble with Nature, though I know that she
always has an ace up her sleeve and can ruin me when she
likes".****</p>

Pioneer</i>, p. 269.]</p>
<p>Sheep and wool statistics have been eloquent of the better
selection and management of flocks. In this mature industry there
has been little extension to new areas, save in Western
Australia. Nor did the number of sheep in Australia again reach
the 1891 total of 106 millions until 1928. But sub-division and
better watering of paddocks from artesian and sub-artesian
wells,* top-dressing of pastures with superphosphates, the
increase of "crossbreds" in mixed farming areas and, above all,
the culling of the merino flocks have built up the yield of wool
to figures far above those of 1891. Then 106,421,000 sheep gave a
clip of 640,752,656 pounds, or about six pounds per sheep. In
1902-3 the wool from 53,675,000 sheep weighed 408,302,146 pounds
or seven pounds nine ounces per sheep, a result of selection for
survival during the drought. In 1913-14 the clip from 88,947,000
sheep was 771,308,222 pounds and the yield per sheep eight pounds
ten ounces, showing that the lessons of the drought had not been
forgotten. The improvement has been maintained. In 1921 a total
of 723,058,219 pounds was obtained from 86,119,000 sheep, again
eight pounds ten ounces from each, and for 1928-9 it is estimated
that 950,000,000 pounds came from 106,100,000, a yield of almost
nine pounds per sheep.** Drought, too, was the headmaster who
disciplined the farmers to listen to that quiet scientist,
Lowrie, and his advocacy of superphosphate. The farmers on
Yorke's Peninsula (S.A.) were first to give heed, as they had
been first with mechanical improvements. Their example gave
permanence to wheat farming in its old homes and extended its
range inland. Two decades later the improvement of the
pasture-value of farmers' stubbles taught the pastoralists also
the lesson of top-dressing. The new methods have built up a wheat
export industry which under other auspices may well outgrow the
pastoral industry in financial weight and international
repute.</p>

<p class="foot">[** The above figures are based on the numbers of
sheep recorded in the <i>Commonwealth Bureau's Production
Bulletin</i>, no. 20, p. 211, and the estimates of the quantity
and value of the Australian production of wool set out in the
accompanying table, for which the author is indebted to the
Commonwealth Statistician, Mr C. H. Wickens. In fairness to him
it must be used as a compilation of doubtful accuracy. The
deductions made from the two tables in the text are still more
doubtful. All comparisons of wool yield are vitiated by the
changes in the practice of creek-washing, exporting in the
grease, scouring, etc. and by the varying periods between
shearing, but the general fact of increasing yield per sheep is
plain in the period under review.]</p>

<small><b>Average Wheat Yield vs. Seasonal Rainfall, Wimmera
1892-1928</b></small></p>
<br>
<p>The Northern Mallee in Victoria, the Pinnaroo country
corresponding to it over the South Australian border, a long
strip in New South Wales to the west of "Coghlan's Line" *** and
the whole Western Australian Wheat Belt outside the Avon and
Victoria Districts have been occupied for wheat-growing since
Farrer bred Federation and Lowrie won credence about
superphosphate. But the increase of yield won by improved methods
in the older farming districts is at least as significant as
these extensions inland. A graph prepared by Dr A. E. V.
Richardson shows the relation between the district average yield
of wheat and the rain that fell on the growing crops in the
Victorian Wimmera from 1892 to 1928.**** The drought years 1902
and 1914 significantly divide the period into three phases. In
the seasons before 1902 each inch of rain which fell in the
growing season, April to October, gave the farmer 0.59 of a
bushel, on the district average. Between 1902 and 1911 an inch on
the seed-bed meant nearly a bushel&mdash;0.95 to be
precise&mdash;and in the decade 1912 to 1921 it brought forth,
almost a bushel and a half of better grain (1.43 bushels).
Omitting the drought year 1914, when the rain on the crop was
less than four inches, the return per inch of rain in the Wimmera
district was 1.66 bushels for the other nine years in the
1912-1921 decade. The best farmers and the students at
Longerenong College win yields far above the district average.
The students obtained 3.5 bushels of wheat per inch of seasonal
rain during the dry years 1917 to 1921. Private farms have
maintained an average of 3.6 bushels per inch. Thus the farmers,
like the pastoralists, have accepted the hard facts of drought as
a stimulus to skill and courage. Water conservation in the
seed-bed supplies the wheat-plant, in the critical months of
maximum transpiration, September and October, with abundant sap
to turn into grain. Fallowing for fifteen months, late seeding
and liberal dressings of water-soluble phosphates give the
short-strawed wheats of Farrer and his school their chance to
fill heavy ears with plump white wheat, though the north wind
rage off the hot interior.</p>

<br>
<p>As a direct result the totals of wheat harvested in the
Commonwealth and the average yield per acre have strongly
advanced. The last year before Federation (1900) saw a record
harvest of 48,353,000 bushels from 5,666,000 acres, an average of
8.53 bushels. Before the first decade of the century was over,
average yields of more than eleven bushels were usual, and two
harvests (1903 and 1909) had yielded over thirteen bushels per
acre, a figure unknown since the narrow fields of the
mid-'seventies. As prices were on the up-grade, such yields led
to bigger acreages under wheat. In 1913 the first nine million
acre crop of wheat gave the first hundred million bushel harvest
(103,344,000 bushels). After the year of war and drought, 1914, a
crop of 179 million bushels was grown (1915) on 12,484,000
acres&mdash;an area broadened by the re-seeded failures of 1914.
Neither figure was excelled for more than a decade thereafter,
but the average yield of 1915 (14.34 bushels) was surpassed in
1920 (16.08 bushels).</p>
<p>The rise of country land values and the eagerness of
successful business men to acquire country property may suggest
that the net incomes on stations and farms have advanced at least
<i>pari passu</i> with the expansion of wool and wheat
production. This is doubtful. In the land hunger of successful
Australians social ambition plays a part, as well as economic
calculation; for socially the "hewers of wood and drawers of
water" (<i>vide</i> any protectionist newspaper) are respected as the
most typical Australians and respect themselves in proportion as
they remain independent of state subsidies. And by reason of
repeated increases in the customs tariff on imports and of other
government regulation of trade and prices, costs have risen in
the exporting industries to the detriment of net incomes.* A
recent stocktaking of the effects of protection estimated the
burden on Australian prices attributable to such policies at 9
per cent. of the general price level.** But there is no stability
or permanently calculable nature in this burden. Its inherent
tendency is to grow even when the external price-levels at which
exported goods sell are steadily falling. A statistical inquiry
at a specific date misses the <i>vis a tergo</i> of wage fixation
and similar benevolent policies. The continual raising of the
tariff and the spread of restrictive schemes designed to secure
"sheltered" prices in the Australian market even for exportable
goods (see Chapter <small>XXIV</small>) imply a general belief that
it does not matter whether the price-level of a country is 9, 10 or
20 per cent. out of line with those of its customers.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In <i>Production Statistics Bulletin</i>, no.
20, p. 183, may be found an interesting comparison of the
increases in prices of primary and manufactured products. Without
commenting on the statistical bases of the index-numbers (p.
173), it may be noted that the greater relative rise for
manufactured goods, almost entirely consumed locally, suggests
rising levels of cost in exporting industries.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>The Australian Tariff: An Economic
Enquiry</i> (1929), p. 68.]</p>
<p>Ever since the first federal customs tariff was imposed there
has been an unceasing propaganda from the secondary industries
for more protection. Latterly the primary industries, one by one,
have joined in the chorus. The cause is not mere greed; it is
raised costs&mdash;raised by policies intended to benefit
specific groups through their charges to others. Coal is the most
edifying example of a primary industry turned beggar. "Once an
export industry, the costs of production rose till it ceased to
export and became a sheltered industry&mdash;sheltered by the
high cost of transport. Finally costs have risen until this
shelter became insufficient and it is now (1929) beginning to be
exposed to the competition of imports." *** The increased costs
laid on Australian industries by such policies are more deadly
than those of drought. These have their compensations when the
drought ends, but since federation there has been no breaking of
the tariff.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>Loc. Cit</i>. p. 26.]</p>
<p>A customs and excise tariff capable of raising considerable
revenue was made necessary to the young Commonwealth by the
Braddon Clause in the Constitution (No. 87), requiring the return
to the state governments of three-fourths of the net revenue from
the duties. To give the federal authorities the two millions they
required, a tariff producing eight millions was indicated. Should
it incidentally give Australian manufacturers such advantages as
they had enjoyed under the Victorian, Queensland and other
tariffs? At the first federal elections a small majority in the
House of Representatives, the chamber to which the Cabinet was
responsible, was zealous to pursue this aim of protection, but in
the Senate the advocates of a purely revenue tariff were about as
numerous as the protectionists. The Prime Minister, Edmund
Barton, though inclined to restrain the ardour of C. C. Kingston,
Minister for Customs, had long been allied with the
protectionists in New South Wales. A tariff was proposed which,
in defence of established industries, "must necessarily operate
protectively as well as for the production of revenue". The
tariff which emerged in 1902 was a compromise in whose schedules
protection reached a degree most disappointing to the insatiable
Syme and his henchmen.</p>
<p>The Labour Party, though holding the balance between Barton's
and Reid's followers in the Representatives, came mainly from New
South Wales constituencies and had "sunk the fiscal issue", i.e.
left its members free to vote on tariff items untrammelled by
decisions in caucus. Not unmindful of the sting in George Reid's
election cry, "Revenue without concession to private and class
interests", many Labour men had helped to limit the duties to a
range of from 5 to 25 per cent., and to preserve a long free
list.* But Victorian protectionists were not slow to size up this
political situation. They evolved a "New Protection" policy
calculated to make the workers partners on the ground floor in
the benefits of protection. They promised to "protect" the
consumer too.</p>
<p class="foot">[* For the tariff schedule see <i>Commonwealth
Statutes</i>, no. 54 of 1902, vol. I, p. 300.]</p>
<p>A parliamentary Royal Commission, appointed in 1904 to examine
the workings of the new tariff, recommended in 1907 substantial
increases in many duties, but added "that where protective duties
are substantially increased, provision should be made to secure
payment of reasonable wages to persons engaged in the industries
benefited ". Moreover, should the Minister certify that the
retail selling prices of protected goods had been unfairly
increased, the Governor-General on an address from both Houses
might by proclamation suspend the increased duties on imports.**
These novel proposals were accompanied by a review of the
piecemeal and varying care for labour afforded by state wages
boards and industrial courts in Victoria, New South Wales,
Western and South Australia and a note of the entire absence of
such bodies in Queensland and Tasmania. The Commissioners were
anxious to apply to all Australia, irrespective of state and
constitutional limitations, an idea which Deakin, as Barton's
successor in the Prime Ministership, had embodied in the Excise
(Harvesters) Act during the preceding year.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Progress Report</i>, no. 30, pp. 4-5, 2nd
session, 1907.]</p>
<p>This Act imposed on various Australian agricultural implements
excise duties amounting to half the customs duties, but the
duties were made variable with the behaviour of the Australian
manufacturer, which was evidently regarded as a matter of
free-will on his part. If he were found to be "taking advantage"
of the tariff and charging prices above those declared by the Act
to be "the fair thing", the Government took power to reduce the
customs duties by executive action. So the farmer would be
"protected". The excise duties in turn might be remitted if
Parliament or an approved industrial tribunal certified that a
given manufacturer was paying fair and reasonable wages to his
employees. The leading manufacturer of these implements was Hugh
Victor McKay. A farmer's son, he had as a stripling put together,
from old stripper and winnower parts eked out by cut-up "tins",
the first "stripper-harvester", and through many a struggle had
built up, first at Ballarat and afterwards at Braybrook Junction
near Melbourne, a thriving industry making his "Sunshine"
harvesters and other labour-saving machines. Mr Justice Higgins,
in the famous Harvester judgment, refused him a certificate that
the wages and conditions obtaining in the Sunshine works were
"fair and reasonable". McKay thereupon refused to pay the excise
duty. Had not those wages maintained in employment throughout the
long Victorian depression a growing body of workers at standards
regarded by their fellows with envy? He was sued by the
Commonwealth before the High Court. That Court, however, by a
majority judgment of three justices to two, held the Excise Act
to be invalid. The Constitution had granted power to the Federal
Parliament to levy excises in order to obtain revenue. This was
an Act seeking to regulate labour conditions and incidentally
discriminating between states and parts of states. The New
Protection, with its complicated rewards and penalties by which
protected employers were to be led and pushed into treating well
both wage-earners and farmers, seemed to have burst like a
bubble. Yet the idea had turned the political mill for the nonce
and had enlisted the Labour Party to work for high and higher
tariffs.</p>
<p>As shown in the preceding chapter, the Harvester judgment at
once became the basis of an active regulation of wages and
conditions by both state and federal tribunals. Labour, having
found where its interests lay, acquiesced in extensions of
protection by tariff revisions in 1908-11, 1914, 1921 and 1926.
The tariff of 1908-11 imposed rates nearly double those of 1902
and cut down the free list. At Deakin's insistence a 5 per cent.
preference to British goods was allowed in items affecting a
large proportion of Australian imports from Britain. This gesture
of restraint in raising the impediments to British trade with
Australian customers was made 10 per cent. when in 1914, 1920,
and 1925 the tariff was put higher still.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* For the later schedules see <i>Commonwealth
Statutes</i>, no 25 of 1921, vol. <small>XIX</small>, p. 76, and
no. 26 of 1926, vol. <small>XXIV</small>, p. 78.]</p>
<p>The New Protection was but the first of a series of outworks
of "economic statesmanship". Its importance, at first, lay mainly
in the eager drive of self-interest with which it inspired the
Labour Party's adherents, a drive which in 1910 placed the party
in power over the Commonwealth. The leading brain of the second
Fisher Government&mdash;first Labour Cabinet to enjoy the support
of a safe majority&mdash;was William Morris Hughes, formerly a
free-trade Labourite. As the new protection policy worked itself
out in the wages tribunals, his eager brain saw in the
exceptional prosperity of the decade 1910 to 1921 opportunities
to put in practice several ambitious policies matured by Labour
in the days and school of Deakin. In addition to an important
share in passing the tariff schedules of 1914 and 1920, Mr Hughes
brought into operation an exclusion from the Australian coastal
trade of all vessels, whether British or foreign, not observing
Australian conditions and wages-awards for seamen. Simultaneously
he purchased and expanded a government line of ocean-going
steamers. In these further steps towards a closed economic system
the aspect of imperialism, though still proclaimed, was difficult
to maintain.</p>
<p>Mr Hughes had first made his political mark as organiser of
the waterside workers and seamen in the old Lang division, of
Sydney. It was but to be expected that he should press on the
federal legislature a plan for securing by law "fair and
reasonable" wages and conditions for workers on the Australian
coastal steamers. It was not his own plan. A Navigation Bill had
been drafted in 1902 by a Customs official, Dr H. N. P.
Wollaston, following the lines of a measure designed to control
Sir James Mills and his Union Steamship Company of New Zealand.
It had a stormy legislative history. Kingston having resigned
over the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, the Navigation Bill
was referred to a Royal Commission and the mantle fell on W. M.
Hughes as its chairman.</p>
<p>The Commission presented a majority report in 1906 adorned
with much rhetoric about "a numerous and well-manned mercantile
marine&mdash;the only safeguard for our Empire&mdash;sufficient
to transport our products in time of peace and to assist in
guarding our shores in time of war . . . We shall best serve
imperial interests", wrote the majority, waving the flag of
Empire against the critics of restriction, "by setting an example
which the other members of the Empire may be inspired to follow,
in providing for the defence of the Commonwealth by employing our
own citizens on our own ships". But that policy, tried and let
slip again and again by Britain between 1381 and 1849,** signally
failed to inspire "the other members of the Empire" when
presented at an Imperial Conference on Merchant Shipping Laws in
1907. It continued as a piece on the Australian legislative
chess-board during five sessions 1907, 1908, 1910, 1911 and 1912
and was at last enacted at the bidding of the Second Fisher
Ministry in 1912.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See G. F. Bastable, <i>Commerce of
Nations</i> (ninth edition), pp. 34, 53, 165.]</p>
<p>The debates had discovered no way round the contention of the
Minority Commissioners of 1904, that the proposed coastal
clauses, excluding from the Australian coastal trade overseas
vessels which did not observe Australian wages, hours, rules of
manning and accommodation, would restrict transport facilities
and enhance the monopoly powers of the associated inter-state
shipping companies.*** It was an evasion to say that Australian
trade was growing so fast that whatever was done would still
leave a trade profitable enough to attract "a sufficient fleet of
ships to meet all the reasonable requirements of Australian
producers". Tramp steamers, the adjusting factor in the supply of
ocean transport, go where they are most likely to fill empty
space on every "leg" of their voyage.**** Any limitation of that
likelihood forces the charging, on balance, of a higher average
level of freights.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** When a witness who knew the ways of the
Associated Steamship Companies from within (H. McLennan,
Melbourne Manager for J. and A. Brown, Newcastle Colliery
Proprietors, and formerly a director in the shipping firm of
Howard Smith, Ltd.) explained to the Navigation Bill Commission
the workings of the deferred rebate system and the monopoly it
had created in the coastal cargo trade (<i>Comm. P.P.</i> session
1906, vol. <small>III</small>, p. 951, and cf. p. 949, questions 24300
and 24322), the Majority Commissioners thought the rebate system
"open to grave abuse" and recommended the "introduction of
legislation making it illegal". But a system that built up a
"fighting fund" of accrued bonuses amounting to £60,000 in
the shipowners' custody, automatically available for use against
competitors as their intrusion became serious, was not to be
abolished by a wave of the law-givers' wand, nor indeed
otherwise, until its work was done.]</p>

<p>The Bill, even when passed, was reserved for the Royal assent
as one affecting Imperial interests. War had broken out before
that assent had been received. The proclamation of the "coastal
clauses", a step inevitably delayed by the necessity of giving
ship-owners notice of the need of structural alterations in their
vessels, was postponed until after the war at the request of the
British Government.</p>
<p>War-time brought, after a pause in 1914, an increased sense of
secure prosperity. Isolation looked like security, and a moderate
inflation like sound, though easy, monetary conditions. A
prospering countryside after the bumper seasons of 1915 and 1916,
and customers for manufactures in New Zealand, Java, South Africa
and the Islands who were very ready to pay prices which had risen
less than those of Europe and America, led men to forget the cost
of raising "fair and reasonable" conditions to whatever level the
heart of man desired. Increased customs duties went almost
unnoticed. Under ever-widening "awards" manufacturers were led to
share the good times with the workers in shorter hours and better
wages. The times emboldened Mr Hughes, Prime Minister after
October 1915, to extend the Australian system to the high seas by
means more direct than even the New Protection and the
much-postponed Navigation Act. Again he worked upon a plan long
conned and argued. As early as 1906 a Federal Royal Commission on
Ocean Shipping had reported that "as a matter of principle the
sea carriage of goods should be as much in the hands of the state
as land carriage now is".*</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Comm. P.P.</i> session 1905, vol.
<small>III</small>, p. 1050. <i>Report of Royal Commission on
Ocean Shipping Service</i>.]</p>
<p>In those days of Socialist enthusiasm, little restrained by
the responsibilities of office, it was almost inevitable that a
Commission drawn largely from the Labour Party should turn from
arguments about the mail subsidy and poundage rates to "the
larger question of establishing a line of mail steamers under the
direct control of the Commonwealth Government".** On such a
government line both freights and wages would register the
Socialist government's bidding. On four grounds the Commissioners
had advocated the building and operation of a National Fleet of
mail-steamers. It could be cheaply financed by an internal loan
of about three millions on which the Government need pay no more
than 3 per cent. An up-to-date fleet of eight vessels would show
the way to private enterprize just as the government railways did
in Australia. Though it could be just as economically operated,
except as regards wages, as any private company's ships, the
Government line would not require to show any profit. And as to
wages, "the payment of deep sea wages on the Australian scale
would undoubtedly enable the national ships to obtain the pick of
all ranks of seamen engaged in the oversea trade".</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Loc. cit</i>. pp. 1041-2.]</p>
<p>Early in 1916, though Australian manufacturers were enjoying
more spacious markets by reason of Britain's preoccupation with
war, it became evident that for want of shipping the bumper wheat
harvest of 1915 would rot on Australian wharves and sidings. In
that event the farming population, customers essential to the
Australian home-market, would be ruined. Mr Hughes, urging in
England the pooling for the common cause of all resources of
shipping foodstuffs and men, and fearful that the far-distant
Australian contribution to the pool would be neglected, suddenly
felt impelled to buy a fleet of fifteen tramp steamers. They were
not new, nor were they the right size for the long voyage. It
would have taken them seven or eight years to shift the
accumulated wheat. But they proved useful pawns in the
negotiations with Britain for its sale and transport. They could
be used where they were suitable, and so set other tonnage free
to shift the wheat. This gesture of impatience or independence
did its work. The British Government bought and transported the
wheat, and Mr Hughes' Strath line, re-christened "Australs",
earned big freights carrying petrol from American ports to
Australia and on other relatively safe routes. Before the war was
over they had more than paid for themselves. They cost originally
£2,052,000 and by 1921, on Mr Hughes' computation, they had
made a profit of £2,993,245. Perhaps, as a capable critic
suggested,*** the Prime Minister had not allowed for depreciation
during those years of hard driving, but in company with nearly a
score of interned German vessels the Commonwealth Line had made
paper profits of over seven millions.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** S. M. Bruce, <i>Comm. P. Debates</i>, 29
November 1921, vol. <small>XCVIII</small>, pp. 13, 339. But the
critic added, "it is impossible either for an accountant or an
ordinary intelligent layman to get at the position from the
statements as they have appeared in the Budget papers from year
to year".]</p>
<p>When the war ended, Mr Hughes was no longer at the head of the
Australian Labour Party, but he had not forgotten his Kaiser-like
enthusiasm for a fleet on the ocean flying the Australian flag
and observing the Australian seamen's log of wages and
conditions. He was not allowed to forget it. As hostilities
ceased the Seamen's Union had become restive. Surely the coastal
clauses of the Navigation Act might now at last be proclaimed. In
May of 1919 the seamen struck, putting this forward as one of
their demands.* Though unsuccessful, their action brought the
Navigation Act once more to the forefront. Mr Hughes was then
absent at the Peace Conference, but before he returned to
Australia he had effected a second shipping coup by ordering,
without the consent of Parliament, a fleet of five large
passenger and cargo vessels. Contracts for the construction of
these were placed in Britain while the Australian seamen were
still defying Arbitration Court, fellow Trade Unions and public
opinion alike. These five steamers were to become famous as the
"Bay liners". Before their arrival in 1922, the way for their
entry into the trade from Brisbane to England via all Australian
capitals and the Suez Canal had been duly smoothed by the
proclamation, in July 1921, of the coastal clauses of the
Navigation Act, excluding their competitors from participation in
the coastal trade.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In <i>The Round Table</i>, December 1919, p.
166, may be found a useful summary of their other demands.]</p>
<p>Alas! The full tide of war and post-war activity on the seas
was now ebbing fast. When in November of that year the House of
Representatives debated the position of the Commonwealth
steamers, it was plain that the "Austral" and ex-enemy vessels
were with difficulty showing any profits. Old age, rough usage
and a declining freight-market were telling heavily. Mr S. M.
Bruce, from the detachment of the back benches, pointed to a net
capital cost of the steel vessels bought, seized, built and
building, amounting to £3,648,000. He arrived at it by
subtracting from cost and interest the net profits made. He
concluded that "the Commonwealth can either get out of the
venture at this moment and look back on a record which shows no
loss and probably a slight gain, or hand the vessels over to the
Commonwealth Line (under non-political management) on a
capitalised basis which would give them a chance to compete with
any likely competitor". He advised sale, but the majority of the
House still feared the power of the Shipping Conference. The
revival of Scandinavian, German and Italian shipping, the
expansion of the American and Japanese mercantile marines did not
in their opinion offer adequate guarantees against the power of
the ring to raise freights.</p>
<p>Selling off the older vessels, cancelling orders for new ones,
the Commonwealth Line continued under nonpolitical management for
another seven years. But losses mounted up. These did not arise
from cutting freights against the Conference vessels to the
advantage of Australian shippers. From the first the Commonwealth
vessels had charged Conference rates, and the freight index
numbers of <i>The Economist</i> show no sign of a more rapid fall
of Australian freight rates during the period of their ownership
by the Commonwealth Government. In mid-1928 the remnant&mdash;the
five Bay liners and a handful of cargo-carriers&mdash;were sold
to Lord Kylsant for £1,900,000 and the Commonwealth
retained only an accumulated net loss of some six millions.</p>
<p>The unions who had been partners in the splendid adventure did
not altogether lose the Australian rates of pay and conditions
aboard ship. These had been hammered out in the first instance by
negotiation with the Commonwealth Steamship Owners' Association,
and thereafter registered with and revised by the Commonwealth
Arbitration Court.** The generosity of the wages and conditions
secured on Australian coastal shipping had not brought about that
expansion of the Australian mercantile marine which the authors
of the "White Ocean Policy" seemed to expect. In addition to the
cramp of legal regulation, economic forces of impersonal origin
were checking the call for inter-state vessels around the coast.
The Western Australian trade in the 'nineties and the early years
of this century had been a busy colonization of an undeveloped
area. Men and families had to be carried over the Bight by tens of
thousands, with clothing, foodstuff; machinery&mdash;all the
impedimenta of a big campaign into the interior. The movement and
subsequent trade were in many ways reminiscent of the
longer-range gold-seekers' migration from Britain in the
'fifties. In the second decade after federation, however, the
Western state began a big export of foodstuffs to Europe, and its
requirements from the Eastern states ceased to grow. Passenger
traffic has expanded very slowly since the East-West
Transcontinental Railway between Kalgoorlie and Port Augusta was
opened in October 1917. Similarly, passenger traffic on the
eastern coast has felt the competition of the new coastal
railways in New South Wales and Queensland. Airways already offer
a still speedier service between the state capitals. Timber from
the West to the East, butter from East to West, iron ore from
South Australia in exchange for coal from Newcastle, raw sugar
from Queensland mills to the refineries at the capitals' ports,
the varied manufactures out of Sydney and Melbourne
factories&mdash;these things freight inter-state vessels, but
they are a fleet of smaller tonnage than before the war. The
vessels on the Australian register had in 1928 a tonnage of
284,622, a figure almost coinciding with that of 1908, viz.
284,641 tons. Yet the companies have cargo space in excess of the
coastal demand for it at the high Australian freights.*** "In the
inter-state trade", wrote a recent observer, "Australia is
provided with as fine a service of steamers as can be found in
the world and one capable of great development in the
future".**** As elsewhere in the Australian economy, the question
presses whether the stable has not been improved at the expense
of the horses' feed. While war and post-war prosperity lasted,
such out-buildings of protectionism as government steamers and a
lavish coastal service afforded unique conditions and wages and
passed for expressions of our national pride. When drought and
falling, prices came again, their cost became an appreciable
mortgage among many that endangered the national estate's
recovery.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII<br>
<br>
How Tariff Protection Grows</h3>
<br>
<p><small>IN</small> the politics of a protectionist country
there is no ease. Having given certain industries an advantage in
the home market, your protectionist is torn with anxiety that
they will take advantage of the consumer. Hence his addiction to
boards. Subconsciously aware that he has run a risk of high
prices and slack service, he calls on a board of experts to guard
against it. But his board, soon or late, advises him that the
task is too complex. He gets rid of it, or reconstructs it, and
the farce begins again. But the manufacturer or other candidate
for advantage ignores these boards and makes straight for
Parliament House. From the story of one such board may be learnt
the fate of all.</p>
<p>Section 101 of the Commonwealth Constitution reveals the fear
of the authors of federation that, in the exercise of its powers
over trade and commerce, the Commonwealth would need an organ of
adaptation to unforeseen changes, a board whose rulings might be
more flexible than the decisions and precedents of the
law-courts. "There shall be an Inter-State Commission", they
enacted, "with such powers of adjudication and administration as
the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance
within the Commonwealth of the provisions of this constitution
relating to trade and commerce and of all laws made thereunder".
This came true. There was such a commission for seven years, but
it was born late and died young. Parliament, like the Federal
Conventions, intended it to be both a court of record and a board
with wide powers of inquiry and action in defence of inter-state
freedom of trade.* The High Court ruled, however, that the
statutory limitation of the Commissioners' tenure of office to
seven years incapacitated them from the exercise of judicial
powers under the Constitution. The Commission became an impotent
thing, analogous to a Royal Commission or a Parliamentary
Committee. It continued in existence until 1920, but the
government of the day ignored every suggestion it made for the
amendment of its defective legal basis. At the expiry of the
first Commissioners' term no fresh appointments were made and the
Commission lapsed.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See <i>Comm. P.P</i>. sessions 1914-17, vol.
<small>II</small>, pp. 1195 <i>et seq</i>., <i>Second Annual
Report of the Inter-State Commission</i>, reviewing the effect of
the High Court's judgment, in the Wheat Case, upon the functions
of the Commission.]</p>
<p>The Federal Conventions may have been wise or unwise in
seeking to entrust to a standing tribunal of wide powers the
defence of the general interest in free enterprize. But in its
absence that general interest has gone unregarded. The voice of
the special pleader is never stilled. New Protection, developing
through wages fixation, tariff schedules, Navigation Act
restrictions and subsidies on export, has wrapped Australian
industry in a net of legal rules. The Australian business man is
tempted to become a suave concessionaire, exploiting his small
corner while yet the system admits it, but explaining that he
would gladly treat his clients better if the newest board would
but give him a little larger scope and check the unpatriotic
greed of others.</p>
<p>During its brief term of existence the Inter-State Commission
presented a series of reports on the Tariff, tracing some of the
more obvious repercussions of "scientific protection". The
natural protection of local manufactures by distance from Europe
had been diminished, even offset, by high inter-state shipping
freights.** While these remained the Commission hesitated to
recommend protective duties high enough to "compensate" them in
Western Australia and other outlying parts. But were not the
tolls of the inter-state shipping combine, that impeded local
manufacturers in the outlying parts of Australia, paralleled
elsewhere and everywhere by the restriction of industry through
high costs? A tree whose outer twigs wither has weakened also in
trunk and roots. Charges passed on are borne by someone.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See, for instances, their reports on Boots
and Shoes, Enamelled Baths, and Iron and Steel, <i>Comm. P.P</i>.
sessions 1914-17, vol. <small>VI</small>, <i>passim</i>.
"Freights from Sydney and Newcastle are higher and were so even
before the war, than from Middlesbrough, the principal exporting
port, to Australian ports direct."]</p>
<p>The Commission's terms of reference in these tariff inquiries
drew attention to the need of "lessening the cost of the ordinary
necessaries of life". But the Commissioners found that none of
the 666 applicants for tariff assistance, whose wares ranged from
motor cars to insecticides, from corsets to canary seed, had, any
concern with this. "The cost of living", they reflected,*** "is
everybody's business, but not the special affair of each citizen
in such a sense that he could give authoritative information on
the state of prices and of manufacturing trades in relation
thereto. . . . Any increase in the cost of living resulting from
Tariff taxation produces its effect only by a total of separate
imposts on many separate items." Yet all the applicants stood in
separate and urgent need of protection. Some found it irksome to
be precise as to evidence of that need. The Commission had issued
a printed form on which applicants for assistance were asked the
present state of their business and the progress made during the
three years **** previous to the date of application. The result
was disappointing, not to say disturbing. They all with one
accord began to make excuse. "The filling in of the forms
involved too much trouble. Details were not available of the
matters specified in the forms. Manufacturers were averse to
disclosing the financial results of their operations." When the
Commissioners, armed with formidable powers and knowledge,*
persisted by oral examination, "applications in many instances
were considerably modified as the result of the private
investigations, and so, too, was the evidence given in public".
One applicant named Bernstein, who had applied for an increase of
20 per cent. on duties already at 40 and 30 per cent., was
"unable to give any information as to manufacturing costs. He
said 'I am not aware of our profits for the past three years. I
do not know anything about finance'".** The Commission thought it
unreasonable "that taxes on the community should be increased on
the plea of unprofitableness of manufacture unless this plea can
be made good by something more than assertion".</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>Comm. P.P</i>. session 1914-17, vol. P-3,

<p class="foot">[* The Chief Commissioner, Mr A. B. Piddington,
K.C., had been offered a place on the High Court Bench. Mr
Nicholas Lockyer had been Controller-General of Customs and Mr

experience in political and industrial administration.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>Comm. P.P</i>. sessions 1914-17, vol.
<small>VI</small>, p. 134.]</p>
<p>Other witnesses, disliking this nice calculation of less and
more, refrained from suggesting the levy of taxes on the
community. They would be content with a simple prohibition of
entry to the Commonwealth of goods likely to compete with their
own. If this boon were granted, they would enter into bonds not
to increase prices save when wages or raw materials rose in cost;
and even then the increase should be under the Inter-State
Commission's control. With the local market thus secured there
would be, they contended, a <i>pro rata</i> reduction of overhead
charges which would "tend to reduce prices!" The Commission
politely demurred. "The total exclusion of new ideas and
improvements to which the whole industrial world is contributing
could not possibly act otherwise than to our substantial
detriment".***</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The authors of the <i>Australian Tariff: an
Economic Inquiry</i> (1929), p. 116, have in effect thrown the
mantle of their authority over such pleas for monopoly. Having in
mind (see p. 515) the iron and steel and the metallurgical
industries, they hold that "the problem of safeguarding
efficiency now requires a different solution in industries
capable of great economies through concentration". Industrial
monopoly they regard as "a relatively new phenomenon virtually
unknown to the classical economists". They think that, with "the
automatic and simple safeguard of public knowledge and public
criticism . . . the protection given should be sufficient, not
merely to place local production on an equality with imports, but
to exclude those which could equally well be made in Australia.
The best economic conditions for a protected industry are
established when it obtains the maximum market for an organized
output, and protection is likely to be most economically applied
when it is limited to such industries." One is reminded of
Governor Hunter and the trading officers.]</p>
<p>Even under the Tariff of 1908-11 the Commission found among
manufacturers a widespread neglect of accurate costing, and a
lack of attention to what their rivals in other countries were
doing. Inspection of factories revealed an "urgent necessity for
a greater appreciation of the value of industrial efficiency".
Waste of power, unsuitable buildings, double handling of goods,
waste of by-products, want of appreciation of applied science had
enhanced the cost of manufacture and rendered necessary "higher"
duties than would be the case if the operations were accomplished
by the most efficient modern methods".</p>
<p>The costs of production of Australian manufactures, so far as
revealed in official statistics, had increased by
£50,235,000 between 1908 and 1913, a time of rising tariffs
but also of "exceptional abundance in primary production". The
general affluence had permitted the value of manufactured output
to rise by £62,031,000. "It thus appears", commented the
Commission, "that the great increases in the burden of production
have been successfully passed on to the consumer, together with
an additional sum of £11,795,000". But some allowance from
this total had to be made for increased overhead charges and
costs of distribution. Others beside the manufacturers had had
their "cut".</p>
<p>The Australian boot and shoe industry, pre-eminent among the
secondary industries, afforded a clear view of the process of
passing on. The Victorian boot manufacturers, with a perfunctory
acquiescence from those in New South Wales, asked the Inter-State
Commission for composite duties of 2<i>s</i>., 1<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>. and 1<i>s</i>. per pair of men's, women's and
children's footwear, plus an <i>ad valorem</i> duty of 25 and 30
per cent. These duties, they hoped, would enable an "arrested
industry" to win the 13.8 per cent. of the market still served by
importers. They hastened to assure the Commissioners that there
was no danger to the consumer in increasing the duties. In the
main lines of boots already made in Australia "internal
competition is sufficiently keen in this trade to keep
manufacturers' prices at the lowest rates consistent with
safety".* The Commission, avid for the facts, confronted the
President of the Victorian Boot Manufacturers' Association with a
statistical study of increases in costs and values of output.
Only one inference, that dignitary admitted, could be drawn from
it. Manufacturers were able to pass on to the public their
increased expenses, plus an advantage. Nor was indication absent
that the wage-earners wittingly shared in gains so accruing. An
"Inter-State Conference"&mdash;not to be confused with the
shipping combine&mdash;represented the Boot Manufacturers'
Associations of New South Wales and Victoria and the Australian
Boot Trade Employees' Federation in all states save Western
Australia. It was active in urging the need of more
protection.</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Comm. P.P.</i> sessions 1914-17, vol.
<small>VI</small>, pp. 264 <i>et seq</i>.]</p>
<p>The Inter-State Commission ventured to remind Parliament that
every burden on trade is paid for by someone. "When the finished
article of one industry is the necessary raw material of another
the Tariff encouragement to both industries may fail to stimulate
development in either case." Growing bolder in thought, they
predicted that "it may at times be found a distinct economic
advantage to withdraw Tariff encouragement from certain
subordinate industries when the effect of such encouragement is
proved to be a hindrance rather than an aid to the total of
industrial development".</p>
<p>What, then, is a subordinate industry? Before industrial
tribunals the term "industry" has been given a wide
connotation.** It cannot now be narrowed to exclude the callings
whose success or failure drives fast or slow the wheels of the
Australian economy. So long as pasture, mining and agriculture
provide almost the whole (95.5 per cent.) of Australian visible
exports, there can be no question that the manufacturing
industries are subordinate, in the sense that their prices must
consort with such costs in the primary industries as enable the
latter to make headway against their rivals. The sales of the
manufacturers are the costs of the primary producers.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See G. Anderson, <i>Fixation of Wages in
Australia</i>, pp. 171 <i>et passim</i>.]</p>
<p>Too long have Australian leaders talked as though no burdens
could offset our natural advantages for growing wool and wheat.
"Fortunately", sighed the Inter-State Commission, "Australia
offers the possibility of unlimited expansion in agricultural,
mining and pastoral industries for the products of which the
world's demand is practically unlimited." *** Thirteen years
later the Development and Migration Commission, in another First
Report, clung with less confidence but more circumlocution to the
same hope. If the industries affected in a complex and disturbing
manner are special in their nature and can command a place in the
markets of the world, and can retain that place in spite of the
adverse conditions&mdash;in short, if the world must have their
products&mdash;they will survive." **** A nation hoping to
progress in numbers and well-being requires a vigorous
advance&mdash;not the mere survival of its chief industries. The
Inter-State Commission foresaw that the market for numerous
Australian manufactures would be confined to the Commonwealth and
could therefore offer only a limited expansion of employment. Its
warning was underlined by the collapse after the war of the
sortie which Australian boot manufacturers made between 1916 and
1921 into the markets of New Zealand, South Africa and the
islands, and by the decline in the export of harvesters to the
Argentine, a trade built up by H. V. McKay in days of less
protection.*****</p>

<p>The Commission reasoned, in effect, that when in doubt
Australia should lead from her longest and strongest suit, the
industry that promised the wider success. Her search for the long
suit could hardly pass by wool or wheat. Yet, hard on the heels
of reports expressing this general advice the Inter-State
Commission put forward a series of recommendations in favour of
increased tariff protection on all manner of goods. It commended
to Parliament most of the pleas of manufacturers for duties
"commensurate with their costs of manufacture and distribution".
The implied theory is that the citizens of a "protected" country
must be denied the fruits of business capacity in all lands but
their own.</p>
<p>Where will the historian find a bridge over the gulf between
the Commission's critique of pure protection and its practical
advice to Parliament? Not in its recommendation of duties on
corsets and stockings. These seemed just and right because it was
anomalous that such articles should receive "different treatment
from that extended to ordinary apparel". But if no item in a
tariff be "anomalous", no protected industry reaps a net
advantage from the tariff.</p>
<p class="poem">When everyone is subsidized<br>
Then no-one's any booty.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* E. C. Dyason, after W. S. Gilbert.]</p>
<p>A scientific tariff should be like the French criminal who,
after being "psycho-analysed", found that his character consisted
entirely of defects.</p>
<p>The Commission may have known that Parliament during the war
was in a mood to welcome any plea for home industries. But, to
the extent that such knowledge influenced it, the High Court's
doubts of its independence were upheld. Parliament showed its
mind plainly enough in an ingenious alteration of the duties on
agricultural implements. The manufacturers of these refused to
deploy for the Commissioners, on the first parade ground of the
New Protection, either claim or argument. On behalf of the
agricultural implement workers an Adelaide commercial traveller
told of their readiness to support any application for
prohibitive duties. He confessed that he did not know the
manufacturers' costs,** but felt sure that duties of £12
per stripper-harvester fixed when such machines were six feet
wide ought to be raised now that they were made nine feet wide.
In the absence of both application and evidence from the
manufacturers, the Commission made no recommendation. Such a
resolute stand did not, however, deter the legislature. It
enacted alternative duties of £13 or 35 per cent., general
tariff, and £10 or 22½ per cent., preferential
tariff, that rate to operate which returned the higher duty.***
These straws showed the way the wind blew in Parliament.</p>

<p>Perhaps the bridge over the gulf of paradox may be found amid
the rival and elaborate recommendations of the Chief Commissioner
and his two colleagues concerning iron and steel&mdash;"compared
with which even gold may be looked upon as of secondary
importance". The wartime cult of self-sufficiency gripped
them.</p>
<p>An economic history of Australian iron and steel has yet to be
written. An indication of the stages in the growth of the
industry must here suffice. Before the era of gold diggings, men
were testing the abundant supplies of iron ore, limestone and
coal scattered about New South Wales.**** A small blast furnace
and two beam engines were working at Nattai (now Mittagong) in
1848. Their Fitzroy Iron Mining Company ran, however, a chequered
and unprofitable course. Like all other colonial callings except
wool-growing and sugar-refining, it was laid low by the superior
attractions of alluvial gold. "Australia could produce gold with
comparatively less labour than any manufactured commodity, and
with the gold it could import its manufactures from countries
where they were produced with comparatively less labour than was
gold." ***** As the exhaustion of the diggings modified this
"cardinal economic fact of the fifties", a larger blast furnace
was set going again at Mittagong and made iron for the girders
used in 1864 for Vickery's Buildings, in Pitt Street. The Fitzroy
works even exported pig-iron to California in 1868, the first 230
tons realizing £6 and £5 per ton. But, in spite of
the coming of the railway to Mittagong 1867, the company
collapsed in 1870. Its plant and land at "New Sheffield" were
sold by auction for £10,000. In the blast-furnace's last
and most productive run, February 1876 to March 1877, it produced
3273 tons of pig-iron, 52 tons of which were made into
"merchant-bars", the wrought iron that was the raw material of
the ubiquitous village blacksmith. But by that time another scene
had been chosen for Australia's "black country", namely Lithgow,
on the way from Sydney to Bathurst, and James Rutherford, of Cobb
&amp; Co., had turned his organizing brain to the making of
iron.</p>

<small>IX</small>.]</p>
<p>The Eskbank Iron Works, managed by Enoch Hughes who had led
the venturers to this more favourable scene, set out like its
predecessor to smelt pig-iron from the native ore. But as in so
many other European callings, including wool-growing and
wheat-culture, a simple transfer to Australia of the ways that
had served in the old lands did not bring success.</p>
<p>Gradually the emphasis in the works at Lithgow turned to the
puddling and rolling of imported pig and scrap iron into
"merchant-bars". Production of local pig-iron ceased in 1882, and
a little later Rutherford "blew down" the blast furnace and
melted up the ironwork in order to put away further temptation to
lose money. Government orders for the rolling of rails from scrap
offered the best business. Such "parasitic capitalism" did not
satisfy Rutherford. His plans for rolling and galvanizing sheet
iron having miscarried through the removal of an import duty, he
sold out to William Sandford, a Bristol man whom Lysaghts had
sent out to run a wire-factory at Parramatta. Paying his men by
piece-work and on a sliding scale, Sandford stuck to re-rolling
old rails and imported steel blooms. He extended his mills for
rolling merchant-bars and boasted, at a political banquet in
honour of some new plant, that the Eskbank works could produce
245 sections and sizes from iron or imported steel.</p>
<p>But the days of the general utility smith and his bar-iron
were passing. That iron had been malleable, hot or cold, and easy
to weld, a commodity of high quality and dear in production but
not of exactly defined composition. The day of specialized
steels, each with specific characters adapted to a certain use,
was coming, and with it the need of the highly trained
iron-master.* Cheap steel rails from abroad put a stop, by their
superior strength and durability, to the re-rolling of old iron
rails at Eskbank. Not lacking courage, Sandford set up a Siemens
four-ton open hearth furnace and in April 1900 turned out the
first Australian steel. Again a political banquet was held, and,
a little later, there was much talk of a London company with
£730,006 capital which would greatly extend the industry.
But an Iron Bonus Bill proposed by the first Federal Government
came to nothing. With it ended the company talk. There were other
ways, however, of obtaining a sheltered market, and in September
1905 Sandfords Limited obtained a seven years' contract to supply
the New South Wales government's requirements of iron and steel.
Two days after the signing of the contract the works manager went
to Britain to purchase plant and expert assistance. With their
aid a great new blast-furnace at Lithgow began again the smelting
of "native" ore from Carcoar in April 1907. Before the year was
out, however, the firm was in difficulties. Costs had mounted,
and a second Iron Bonus Bill had been vetoed by Mr Deakin's
socialist allies; they favoured direct nationalization. Sandford
appealed to the public to subscribe funds to carry on his great
work; the public fought shy of it, and his bank foreclosed. G.
and C. Hoskins, a Sydney firm of boiler-makers who had made the
locking-bar pipes for the Coolgardie Water Scheme, bought the
Eskbank property in January 1907. After an experiment with bigger
plant, the new firm turned away from the puddling and rolling of
wrought iron, to concentrate on steel.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "To produce wrought iron of general merit was
comparatively easy but expensive", writes an American historian
of a similar time of transition at Pittsburg, Louis Hunter,
<i>Journal of Economic and Business History</i>, February 1929,
p. 279. "To produce iron of specialized quality was very
difficult, but, if successfully accomplished, resulted in a
material reduction of cost. A first requirement for the control
of the quality of the product was an exact knowledge of raw
materials."]</p>
<p>The enterprise of the Hoskins in replacing small furnaces and
mills by large ones was stimulated in December 1908 by the
passage of a Manufactures Encouragement Act, offering bounties on
the production of pig-iron from Australian ore, on bar-iron from
such pig-iron, and on steel and galvanized sheet. Their business
grew apace. Payments to the New South Wales Railways for freight
rose from £28,700 in 1908 to £98,000 in 1914. Veins
of mullock in the Carcoar deposit of ore led them to try a fresh
supply at Tallawang near Mudgee, and later the big ore beds at
Cadia, out towards Orange.** A second blast-furnace swelled the
out-turn of pig-iron from 30,393 tons in 1908 to 75,150 tons in
1914. The various State governments developed a habit of
granting, over and above the prices, duty paid, quoted by British
firms, a preference of 10 or 15 per cent. to Australian tenders;
this helped. The Lithgow mills rolled the first steel rails made
in Australia for the East-West Transcontinental Railway. The
number of men an Hoskins' pay-roll trebled between 1908 and 1925,
and their plant began to take the shape of a modern integrated
iron and steel works.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The Carcoar ores were limonite and hematite,
with occasional patches of magnetite. The manganese content
varied from 0.5 to 1.5 per cent. The Tallawang ore is magnetite.
Those from Cadia are mostly hematite carrying from 50 to 62 per
cent. of iron with a very low manganese content. The missing
manganese was supplied from Grenfell.]</p>
<p>By 1925, however, another Richmond was in the field. A steel
enterprise, planned before its inception on up-to-date lines, was
assembling its materials from the most accessible sources in
Australia and serving the Australian markets by sea.*** When, in
1928, Hoskins erected at Port Kembla on the south coast a blast
furnace of American design and planned a complete iron and steel
plant at tide-water,**** they were following the earlier lead at
Newcastle, north of Sydney, of the Broken Hill Proprietary
Company.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** Be it noted that the new works thus combined
American ideas of mass-production with the advantage of
sea-carriage that has enabled British steel-masters to hold so
long their position in export markets. With a German degree of
technical and "rationalizing" skill the B.H.P. works should be
formidable competitors in free markets.]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** This enterprise, under the name of the
Australian Iron and Steel Company Limited, involved a combination
of Hoskins Ltd. with Dorman Long &amp; Co., Baldwin (England) and
Howard Smith Limited, with a nominal capital of five
millions.]</p>
<p>Between 1900 and 1911 the "B.H.P." had used in its
lead-smelting at Port Pirie (S.A.) iron ore from two large
deposits called Iron Knob and Iron Monarch, close to the coast on
the other side of Spencer Gulf. A trial made at Port Pirie in
1907 showed the ore capable of producing excellent pig-iron, and
in 1911 John Darling, the Chairman of the Company, knowing the
life of even such a wonderful producer as its Broken Hill mine to
be limited, announced that its manager, G. D. Delprat, was to
visit Europe and America in search of information and experts
"for the development of industries kindred to our resources, as
yet barely touched upon".* In this search Mr Delprat was
embarrassed at times by a readiness in those of whom he asked
advice to offer their own services to the great company he
represented, but finally he found in Philadelphia the man he was
seeking, David Baker, an engineer of New England origin and
training, and of wide American and Canadian experience.</p>
<p class="foot">[* See <i>The Iron and Steel Industry in
Australia</i>, by Essington Lewis, Managing Director of the
B.H.P. Co., <i>loc. cit</i>. pp. 15 <i>et seq</i>.]</p>
<p>Land had long before been acquired (1896) at Newcastle
(N.S.W.), close to the main coalfields of Australia. There, on a
site enlarged to 1100 acres by purchase and by reclamation from
mangrove swamp, the first units of the steel works arose in the
year 1914. They comprised a 350-ton blast furnace, 66 by-product
coke ovens; three 65-ton basic open hearth steel furnaces, a
35-inch blooming mill and a 28-inch rail and structural mill.
Nearly a million sterling had been laid out at Newcastle and Iron
Knob when in January 1915 the first shipment of iron ore was
unloaded from the Company's steamer, 'Emerald Wings', at its
Newcastle wharves. The blast furnace was "blown in" on 9 March
1915, a month later steel ingots and six weeks later steel rails
were produced. War-time demands caused a rapid expansion of the
plant In the year ending 1 December 1927 it consumed 692,208 tons
of ore, from the quarries and crushers on Spencer Gulf, in
turning out 416,532 tons of pig-iron, from which 387,929 tons of
steel were made and re-made into a great variety of shapes and
sections at subsidiary works that have built themselves around
the Newcastle site.</p>
<p>But a change has come in the circumstances of the Proprietary.
It began operations at Newcastle on estimates which were expected
to make it independent of tariff assistance. In quantity, quality
and accessibility the iron ore deposits in South Australia, the
limestone from the hills by the Don River near Devonport,
Tasmania, and the low-sulphur coking coal at Newcastle, when
assembled by sea-carriage made cheaper by the back-loading of
coal, promised success on economically sound lines in free
competition with the world. The first contract for coking coal
used in the blast furnace plant was seven shillings per ton
delivered at the works. Then over the pall that drifts high above
its forest of stacks there descended the deeper fog of war; and
its great wheels, for all their might, were caught in the
labouring machine of the New Protection.</p>
<p>The tall chimneys did not cease to smoke. Orders came thick
and fast to Newcastle as to all the world's steel plants.
Australia did not go short; the Transcontinental Railway was
built mainly with B.H.P. rails. Rails and munition bars were sent
even to France and Britain. But costs mounted. Fresh plant had to
be installed at war-time prices and wages rose steadily. The
Company purchased coal property and began to sink its own shafts;
but this could save it only coal-mining profits. Legal regulation
and union enforcement of shorter hours and higher hewing rates
were making Newcastle coal dear to win.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** See F. R. E. Mauldon, <i>Economics of
Australian Coal, passim</i>.]</p>
<p>In such circumstances it is intelligible enough that the
Inter-State Commission recommended in a majority report a step
which the authors of colonial tariffs before federation and of
the federal tariffs of 1904 and 1908-11 had hesitated to take,
viz, the imposition of import duties on pig-iron and on iron and
steel products.*** Only the Hoskins of Lithgow had applied for
such duties, but the majority Commissioners satisfied themselves
by an examination of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company's costs
up to 30 April 1916 "that without tariff assistance this company
cannot compete in other markets than New South Wales, the state
in which its works are situated, beyond the stage of pig-iron and
even in that particular item it may with free imports be limited
in its area of distribution in normal times ". The Chief
Commissioner was for helping the industry through infantile
weakness by continuing the system of bounties and looking into
the problem of interstate shipping. His colleagues conceded that
where an article is, the raw material for secondary industries,
and its manufacture in adequate supply is likely to take time,
"encouragement by bounty means the least burden on secondary
industries and the community". But the bounty method indicated,
they thought, an expectation that the industry would ultimately
be able to do without assistance. This, they held, was not the
case with iron and steel. "Under the conditions which at present
exist in Australia (that industry) cannot continue without help.
. . . Any scheme of assistance by bounties would be, in our
opinion, an altogether insufficient assurance to capital and
enterprize that a determined and permanent settled policy had
been instituted by Parliament. Import Tariff duties, on account
of their more permanent nature, are considered the only
appropriate means of assistance for an industry which has
advanced to a stage when successful development is assured under
reasonable protection." ****</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>Comm. P.P</i>. sessions 1914-17, vol.
<small>V</small>, pp. 1602 <i>et seq</i>. Pre-war duties are
tabulated on p. 1678.]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** <i>Comm. P.P</i>. sessions 1914-17, vol.
<small>VI</small>, pp. 1626 <i>et seq</i>.]</p>
<p>Reasonable protection as a determined and permanent policy,
however, has a knack of leading its devotees on and on. The
Commissioners regretted that for lack of time their investigation
had not "comprehended" "the effect that any alteration in the
Tariff would have upon the many branches of engineering and
allied trades as well as upon other industries". Yet they did not
hesitate to recommend the imposition of duties on pig-iron, of
17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per ton in the general, 12<i>s</i>.
6<i>d</i>. per ton in the preferential tariff. This led to a
recommendation of duties on scrap iron because it competed with
pig-iron; also to iron and steel ingots, blooms and billets. "If
steel billets and blooms are left free of duty it may better pay
the manufacturers of plates, etc. in some of the principal
centres to import billets and blooms rather than use those made
from Australian ore. Imports can come direct to any port." Thence
to iron and steel bars, rods and angles. "If a duty were put on
steel-blooms and scrap without putting a duty on manufactures it
would seriously affect the present rolling mills." Such duties,
they knew full well, would "have to be taken advantage of to some
extent". The duties they suggested on steel rails would be a
burden on the public railways. The representatives of the New
South Wales Public Works Department were not slow to impress this
on the Commission.</p>
<p class="poem">"I weep for you", the Walrus said:<br>
"I deeply sympathize!"</p>
<p>Perhaps prices would rise only "until increased output, better
organization and other factors reduce costs". The Federal
Parliament, not unmindful that "other factors" included the legal
definition of wages and conditions, went beyond the Commission's
lead. Scope was left for future industrial awards by the
imposition of much heavier duties than those recommended, on
almost every item of the tariff affecting iron and steel.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Customs Tariff Acts, especially no. 25 of
1921.]</p>
<p>"The mighty current of a popular movement", Ranke noted,
"carries along with it even those who seem to direct it." The
surging nationalism of war-time, maintained at high tide by the
discussions after the war of international relations in the
Pacific, made Australians ready to pay any price their trusted
leaders asked "to make this great Continent independent of
outside supplies of iron and steel". Moreover, the tactical skill
of the Prime Minister (Mr W. M. Hughes) in imposing the new
tariff of 1921 at a time when wholesale prices in Britain,
Europe, and America were tumbling down, masked from the
Australian public the burden of the new duties. For Australian
prices actually fell between August 1920 and December
1921&mdash;though maintained at a level higher than those in
other lands.** Facts, for all his skill, have proved persistent
critics of popular feelings. In a hundred-and-one ways Australian
primary producers have felt the strain of this discrepancy
between price-levels in their home and their oversea markets.
Like their ancestors in the old land, they are great users of
iron and, whereas the price of pig-iron at Lithgow rose by 62.6
per cent. between 1914 and 1927,*** the average of British iron
and steel prices was in 1928 less than 13 per cent. above the
pre-war average. In Australia, it seemed, the advantages of
improved technique which elsewhere percolated to the consumer,
were mortgaged for the employees of town factories and public
utilities. Here was fit matter for consideration by a new
Board.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV<br>
<br>
"Protection All Round"</h3>
<br>
<p><small>SINCE</small> 1913 the place held by the primary
producers' leaders in the State and Commonwealth legislatures has
reflected the growing importance as exports of wheat and dairy
products. Unlike the pasturing of stock for their wool, hides and
meat, these industries keep the countryside moderately well
peopled. The Country Party came determined to play a lone hand
and to sway the parliamentary balance in the interests of the
"man on the land", much as the Labour men had done twenty years
earlier. Farmers sold their produce, other than sugarcane, at
values that fluctuated in unsheltered markets. They objected to
both tariff-raising and wage-fixing. Whether such policies raised
town standards of living or not, they certainly piled up
transport and farming costs. The Country Party sought to free the
farmer's costs of uneconomic burdens. The man on the land
resented being neatly robbed of the reward of his increased
efficiency, and meant to "warn off" both protected manufacturer
and privileged labour.</p>
<p>But the statesman who can compel or induce a democracy to face
unpleasant facts is a rare product. Farmers in annual conference
sought to evolve a policy and a leader from a political machine
modelled largely on that of Labour, but most of the leaders *
they tried in Parliament became, like Labour after 1907, pupils
in the Victorian school of political conjuring. The first step in
their education as new-protectionists was the appointment, in
lieu of the defunct Inter-State Commission, of a Tariff
Board.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The co-operative activities of Australian
farmers which should have educated such leaders have been
curiously patchy. Study of the "Eudunda Farmers" in South
Australia and of the "Westralian Farmers" in Western Australia
are needed. Rather unfortunately the ablest of the co-operative
leaders, having dealings with successive governments of different
colour, think it imperative that they should "keep out of
politics".]</p>
<p>At the election of 1919, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes)
promised a protective tariff so hedged about that the consumer
should be secure against "profiteering" prices. The Tariff Board
was to do the hedging.** This expert body would study the effects
of the tariff on Australian industries. Was a manufacturer acting
in a manner which resulted in unnecessarily high prices being
charged to the consumer? The Board would "deal with" him. The
Minister must refer to the Board "the necessity for new,
increased or reduced duties, and the deferment of existing or
proposed duties." So formidable did the new Board look that an
ardent Nationalist who, in subsequent years, earned as Minister
for Customs the title of "high priest of protection" voted
against the Bill on its second and third readings. But personnel
and tenure are important matters; the first Board, appointed for
two years only, consisted of a customs official as chairman, a
Victorian manufacturer and, an importers' representative.</p>
<p class="foot">[** See The Tariff Board of Australia", by R. C.
Mills, in <i>The Economic Record</i>, May 1927, pp. 52-81.
Proposals for a further re-shaping of the Tariff Board are
outlined in <i>The Australian Tariff: an Economic Inquiry</i>
(1929), parts X and XI.]</p>
<p>In its youth, reviewed in its annual report of June 1923,***
the Tariff Board showed a tender solicitude for soldier-settlers'
needs. Wire-netting, fencing-wire and galvanized iron it held to
be "goods absolutely essential to the primary producer starting
out to bring under control and cultivation large tracts of
country, much of which was in a virgin state". On its initiative
the Government placed these commodities on the free list and
talked of a bounty to manufacturers "providing for them a
protection equal to the then duty". Before a year had passed, but
after a political crisis, the Board, finding that the principal
Australian manufacturers had accumulated a stock of several
thousand miles of wire-netting, reported that British
wire-netting was being "dumped" into the Commonwealth to the
detriment of an Australian industry. Hastening to the aid of the
new suppliant, it recommended the imposition of a dumping duty on
cheap wire-netting under Section 4 of the Customs Tariff
(Industries Preservation) Act 1921.**** Free imports of the
pioneer settlers' necessities were promptly and effectively
stopped.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>Comm. P.P</i>. session 1923-24, vol.
<small>II</small>, p. 1687.]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** No 28 of 1921. Section 4 provided that if
goods exported to Australia of a kind manufactured in Australia
were being sold to an importer at an export price less than the
fair market value of the goods and to the detriment of an
Australian industry, the Minister, after report by the Tariff
Board, might after gazettal impose a special dumping duty
representing the difference between the fair market value of the
goods at the time of shipment and the export price.]</p>
<p>In its second term, with its personnel reinforced by a
representative of the primary producers, the Tariff Board made an
elaborate inquiry into the agricultural implements industry.* The
information as to their costs supplied by the Australian
manufacturers, "confidentially but in full detail", satisfied the
Board that these gentlemen were not charging excessive prices. On
the contrary, not only had they provided implements adapted at
all points to local requirements, but their activity and
enterprise had also been a valuable check upon the monopoly which
American exporters might otherwise have built up, in the supply
of mass-produced implements from Canada and the United States.
Treatment so good when applied to one secondary industry, they
argued, should be extended to all. The Board found it "impossible
to imagine that any secondary industry can carry on without
protection in a country where it is the policy to protect
secondary industries, where the standard of living is high as the
result of that protection, and where the volume of output is
restricted through the absence of a large home market".</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Comm. P.P</i>. session 1925, vol.
<small>II</small>, p. 1891, <i>Report of the Tariff Board on
Agricultural Implements</i>.]</p>
<p>The Country Party leaders lacked either the skill or the
courage to reason with such logical fellows. They faced a nation
hypnotized by a myriad press articles into submitting to the
protection of all secondary industries as the settled national
policy. They did not distinguish between a cost of living made
high for all by this policy and standards of living raised for
some but depressed for others. They proceeded rather to claim the
extension of the national policy to the primary industries as
well. The home market might not be large enough for the
manufacturers' ambitions of output, but protection had made it a
lucrative field for them; and it consumed more than half of the
total value of Australian primary products. Why should not the
primary producers enjoy a sheltered market there too? The
national policy of protection, having taken Labour under one
wing, could surely find room under the other for its older allies
the farmers. It had already befriended the sugar growers, and
war-time expedients had shown how "orderly marketing" might
proceed. Out of such beginnings rose the ideal of protection all
round.</p>
<p>During the war, truly, wool had been appraised and wheat
pooled under the compulsory powers of government. This war-time
marketing and distribution of essential commodities was held
necessary to prevent their diversion from the resources of the
allied powers. It was facilitated by the concentration of
shipping under a single Allied Shipping Control. Beyond doubt it
had saved the premier industries of Australia from ruin.** Five
hundred million bushels of wheat were handled by the Australian
Wheat Board's agents, including Farmers' Co-operative Companies,
during the five seasons of the Board's control. Nearly two-thirds
of this were sold to the British Government at an average price
of 4<i>s</i>. 8.8<i>d</i>. a bushel delivered in Australia, a
figure well above those ruling before 1914. Though there were
indignant snorts from some when British ministers referred to the
price paid for this wheat as evidence of Australian farmers'
patriotism, those farmers were mightily impressed by the
machinery of mass-marketing made practicable by the simplified
commerce of governments at war. After the war, both by the
compulsion of friendly state governments in Western Australia and
Queensland and on a voluntary basis in all the states growing
wheat for export, wheat pooling continued.*** Despite fluctuating
support, the farmers' leaders built up machinery both for sale
through a seasonal pool in each state, and for cash sales through
co-operative companies as wheat merchants. In doing so they
entered, in Western and South Australia, into financial
co-operation with the British Co-operative Wholesale Society. But
some, notably, in New South Wales, hankered for a sheltered price
in the home market.</p>

<p>Four Australian wool-clips were purchased by the British
Government at an average price of 15½<i>d</i>. per pound,
<i>plus</i> half of any profits it might make from re-sales for
civilian use. The total quantity was over seven million bales.*
At the end of 1920, however, after the British Government had
paid the agreed price to the credit of the Australian Central
Wool Committee, it found itself with a considerable sum in hand
as profits of civilian sales and with a surplus of nearly two
million bales of Australian wool, half merino and half
cross-bred. As it had also 770,000 bales of New Zealand
cross-bred wool, this was indeed an embarrassment of riches.
Wool-growers, wool-brokers and wool-buyers had all worked
harmoniously and with brilliant technical and administrative
success in substituting mass-purchase and appraisement for the
older auction-sales in Australia and London. The British
Government had no longer need or wish to control the purchase of
the Australian, New Zealand and British wool-clips. Over the
market, however, there hung at the resumption of free
auction-sales this mighty stock of old wool as well as the
1920-21 clip. In all, the visible supply was over three million
bales.**</p>

post-war marketing problem see the <i>Economic Record</i>,
February 1928 Supplement, article "Bawra", by E. C. Dyason.
Though further research among the papers of the Central Wool
Committee and Bawra, in the Library of the School of Commerce at
the University of Melbourne, may possibly modify some of the
conclusions therein contained, the author of the article was
exceptionally well placed and qualified to analyse the events and
forces which he appraises.]</p>
<p>A marketing plan for the transition period was hammered out
by Sir Arthur Goldfinch, the Director of Raw Materials for the
British Government, in conference with representatives of both
wool-growers and brokers. It took shape as a great joint stock
company whose name stated its function, the British Australian
Wool Realization Association Limited. Nick-named "Bawra", with
perhaps the suggestion that it was first cousin to "Dora", the
Association was registered on 27 January 1921 as a Victorian
company. To it the British Government, through that of the
Commonwealth; transferred the cash and the unsold wool remaining
from its war-time monopoly. Valuing this wool at 40 per cent.
less than its appraised value&mdash;for prices had slumped
heavily under the pressure of deflation at home and the shadow of
such stocks&mdash;Bawra distributed wool-certificates and shares
in its assets to all growers who had contributed wool to the
total appraised in proportion to their contributions.*** The
slump in the wool auction-rooms, bordering on panic, was stayed
by a Commonwealth "war-time regulation", 9 May 1921, setting
8<i>d</i>. a pound as the minimum price at which wool might be
exported. Bawra then proceeded, not always with the concurrence
of wool-selling brokers, to put up its stocks at monthly auction
sales mainly in Britain, carefully rationing the market and
setting, reserves on its offerings according to its estimate of
growers' costs in producing the concurrent new clips.**** After
August 1922 the wool-selling brokers refused to be bound by the
Association's allocation of quantities of wool, old and new, to
be submitted at the Australian auctions. The plan's success,
however, in removing the fear of unlimited offerings, had by then
made possible a sharp recovery in prices, especially for merino
wool.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** The British Government also appointed Bawra
its agent in the sale of its stock of New Zealand wool.]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** Dyason, <i>loc. cit</i>. p. 59: "On many
occasions the Directors of B.A.W.R.A. refrained from putting
their full quota on the market and in some cases suspended sales
altogether for a period".]</p>
<p>At the end of that year, when Bawra's distributions had
reached sixteen millions sterling, Sir John Higgins, its
Chairman, proposed that the shareholders should use its remaining
assets, estimated to be worth to them six millions more,* as an
insurance fund for the protection of Australia's pastoral and
agricultural industries. Sir John, a "self-made" business leader
of Cornish origin and Phoenician ability in finance, talked to a
meeting of over 500 shareholders, of setting up central
re-conditioning works, of grading every lot by type and yield,
of, abolishing draftage&mdash;that old mystery that makes the
wool-growers' hundredweight only 111 pounds when he sells his
wool&mdash;of allocating quantities for auction and of
mass-bargaining about freights. By such means he held that a
central organization with a capital of six millions might
"increase the returns from a normal Australian wool-clip by
£2,500,000 to £3,500,000 or eight to ten per cent. of
its present value. . . . The important factor&mdash;the material
gain&mdash;would be in the enhancement of the value of the wool
production of the Commonwealth". His proposals were summarily
rejected by an adverse vote, without discussion. The powerful
wool-selling brokers were active in hostility to them, for they
were not ready lightly to submit their excellently run and
lucrative businesses to a central control. But in opposing Sir
John Higgins' great "rationalization" they played upon a
responsive instrument. The vast majority of pastoralists
mistrusted anything that would put their wool nearer to the grasp
of governments in whose policies they have seldom had part or
trust. Sir John Higgins disclaimed any association between the
co-operative company of his dreams and government control. Yet
save by fiat of the Commonwealth Government, how could his
central organization obtain or retain such control of Australian
wool as would be needed for its purpose of mass-marketing? Mr
Dyason, as "the student", "is left with the conviction that the
Australian wool industry as a whole lost an opportunity, which is
unlikely to recur, of creating a powerful instrument for its own
advancement".</p>
<p class="foot">[* It must be noted that as under the original
agreement for the acquisition of the Australian wool, a half
share in the assets realized by Bawra belonged to the British
Government.]</p>
<p>Bawra certainly served the wool industry well. It distributed
over thirty millions as the Australian woolgrowers' quota of the
wool salvaged from the war. But the results of other ambitious
plans outside Australia for the advancement of values in the
world's markets tempt one to regard the veto on its continuance
as an equal service. Merino wool is grown in South Africa. How
long would Sir John Higgins' disclaimer of any attempt to "uphold
unduly the price of wool" have held good in a sense acceptable to
the users of wool? Who would have decided what was due?</p>
<p>Other groups of the primary producers showed no liking for
free or open marketing. They had before them an impressive
example in sugar of the power of an organized industry, based
upon an Australian primary product, to secure special prices
through a sheltered local market.</p>
<p>Even before federation, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company
had shown its political influence in a successful resistance to
G. H. Reid's proposal (1896) to remove the long-established duty
on sugar. The Company had in the early 'nineties stood up with
resource and courage to the attacks of bounty-fed German sugar in
its Australasian markets. Fighting funds had been set aside
without detriment to the annual rate of dividend, and prices had
been cut by £2 to £3 per ton in the colonial
markets.** But when Reid proposed the abolition of the duty on
sugar imported into New South Wales, a duty dating back to 1855,
the impending destruction of the industry was loudly
proclaimed&mdash;"a result which those who wish to place in the
hands of German importers a large share in the sugar trade of New
South Wales will naturally view with satisfaction". Contracts
with farmers on the Northern Rivers for sugar-cane were
cancelled. Inquiries were set on foot with a view to "utilizing
our N.S.W. plant elsewhere". Reid bowed to this storm of
opposition; at his advice Knox was knighted in 1897 and the
reduction of the duty below £3 a ton was stayed.*** The
Company's inspecting chemist, Dr Kottmann, went to inquire about
new processes in France and in Germany. Knox, a native of
Denmark, had himself been educated at Lübeck, though too soon to
have imbibed from List his skill in nationalist economics.****
The usual dividend was declared, free of the new income tax.
Sixteen thousand tons of Australasian sugar were exported to
British Columbia, Hong-Kong, London and Japan, and shareholders
were offered the right to provide £170,000 fresh capital to
replace the debentures redeemable in 1899 and 1900. They were not
slow to respond.</p>

<p class="foot">[*** "The area under sugar-cane in New South
Wales reached its maximum in 1895-6 with a total of 32,927
acres." It then fell gradually to 10,490 acres in 1918-9.

<p>The old chief died on 7 January 1901 at the sunrise of the
Commonwealth, but his creation, the great C.S.R. Company, entered
the new arena armed <i>cap-à-pie</i>. Since 1889,
£1,100,000 had been added to its paid-up capital and
applied mainly to the reduction of interest-bearing liabilities.
It had virtually withdrawn from direct cultivation of sugar-cane
in Australia, leaving this to white farmers. In times of drought
it could draw upon supplies of raw sugar grown on its own
plantations in Fiji or upon outside supplies from Java. With
inter-state free trade it expected to concentrate the work of
refining "to a larger extent than heretofore, at any port where
the existing conditions allow of the refining work being
conducted at the lowest cost".* But federated Australia regarded
other aims as superior to the economies of concentration. One of
the earliest acts of the national Parliament put a stop to the
importation of Kanakas and made provision for the deportation of
any in Australia after 31 December 1906.** To encourage sugar
production by white labour an Excise (Sugar) Act 1902 offered as
a bounty on sugarcane so grown a rebate of two out of the three
pounds a ton excise levied on manufactured sugar.*** The
proportion of Queensland sugar grown by coloured labour fell from
85.5 per cent. in 1902 to 12.11 per cent, in 1909. The tariff
protected the sugar industry by an import duty of £6 per
ton on raw or refined cane-sugar, and £10 per ton on
beet-sugar. Thus the white sugar men in New South Wales and
Queensland enjoyed a net protection of £5 per ton, paying
in effect only £1 a ton as excise. Yet they were far from
being happy. The Commonwealth Statistician recorded decorously in
1912 that the system of rebates was producing "effects not
anticipated at the time the legislation was passed, and that the
greater part of the cost of substituting white for coloured
labour was thereby being imposed on the States engaged in the
industry, instead of being a charge upon the whole Commonwealth".
Bluntly the sugar-growers complained that with unions forcing up
the men's wages and the refining companies determining the price
they would pay for cane&mdash;according to sugar-content but by
monopoly power&mdash;no good came to them from either protection
or bounty. In 1912 both excise and bounty were repealed on
condition that Queensland prohibited by state legislation the
employment of coloured labour in the industry. Simultaneously the
state set up machinery to fix the wages of sugar employees. The
position of the cane-growers between the upper and the nether
millstones of refineries and organized labour remained
unattractive. The area under sugar-cane fluctuated but increased
little between 1905 and 1914.****</p>

<p>At this stage the industry aimed only at the service of the
Australian demand at Australian prices.* Its uneasy poise was
rudely upset in 1915 by the effects of drought and war, but was
propped up again on more attractive supports by the state and
federal governments. Early in the war, state price-fixing boards
fixed the price of sugar, among other commodities. The figure
named was considerably less than the market price outside the
Commonwealth which had been affected by the blockade of Central
European supplies of beet-sugar. But Australia had sugar troubles
of her own. Dry seasons in Queensland and New South Wales had
sharply threatened supplies. The fixed price at this juncture
made it impracticable for the C.S.R. Company to adopt the plan
used in former years of shortage, viz, of importing raw sugar
from Java or Fiji, refining it and putting it on the Australian
market at a price reflecting the outside value of sugar. To do so
in 1915 would have meant a loss of £7 a ton. The Federal
(Labour) Government, obsessed by the dogma that value should bear
an invariable relation to cost of production,** was anxious to
prevent the C.S.R. Company from increasing the value of the
Australian sugar in its possession above what ministers held that
it had cost. Early in May, however, it became known that the
stocks of Australian sugar, freely consumed at the fixed price,
would be exhausted in July. The Federal Government then
purchased, through the C.S.R. Company, the Java sugar needed to
tide the domestic demand over the period of shortage, until the
1916 sugar crop.</p>

production, <i>C.S.R. Reports</i>, 31 March 1895 (Mitchell

<p class="foot">[** See <i>Comm. P.D</i>. vol.
<small>LXXVI</small>, 6 May 1915, p. 2914, statement by Senator
Pearce.]</p>
<p>Once having entered the sugar business, federal governments
found it hard to draw back. In July 1915 Mr Hughes (then
Attorney-General) purchased the raw sugar from Australian growers
and central mills at £18 per ton, and employed the C.S.R.
and Millaquin Sugar Companies to refine and distribute it. A
charge of £3. 13<i>s</i>. per ton was allowed for the
companies' services in refining and handling the sugar, plus an
addition representing the cost of tinning, canning, handling and
distributing the syrup. But a provision in the
agreement&mdash;9<small>A</small>, a mere
afterthought&mdash;read: "Should legislation affecting the
conditions of the manufacture or refining of the 1915 crop of
sugar be passed by any State this agreement shall be subject to
such re-adjustment as shall be agreed upon". One Dugald Thomson
was named as arbitrator. As war-time wages and costs rose, prices
to growers had to be revised. Scanty yields led to imports of
oversea sugar, on government account. In 1919-20 and 1920-21
these were both extensive and expensive. The retail price was
raised to 6<i>d</i>. a pound.*** To keep it at that level until
the government's costs had been recouped, a complete embargo on
imports of black-grown sugar was imposed. Behind this screen of
regulation the price of raw sugar to the growers could be and was
further increased. Generous prices for cane set up a considerable
expansion of the area under cultivation. The long stagnation at
between 140 and 170 thousand acres was broken up in 1921 when
197,293 acres grew cane. In 1926-7, 280,000 acres were growing
it.</p>
<p class="foot">[*** For a table of Australian sugar prices, 1915
to 1925, see <i>Commonwealth Year Book</i>, no. 20, p. 678.]</p>
<p>On more than one occasion the Commonwealth Government has
announced its intention to terminate the embargo on foreign sugar
and to confine the protection of so prosperous an industry to the
import duty of £9. 6<i>s</i>. 8<i>d</i>. per ton. But
Queensland occupied a pivotal position in federal politics. The
swing of its ten electorates in the House of Representatives
usually determined the fate of the federal cabinets. Queensland
state governments have been nothing loth to support the cause of
the sugar-growers. The industry has become an exporting one on a
considerable scale. Imports averaging in value £2,693,000 a
year in the five years ending June 1921 have given place to
exports averaging £1,551,800 per annum in the succeeding
five years. The exports were mainly sold in the British market
where for several years they enjoyed a preference.* The spread of
such labour-saving devices as the tractor-drawn cultivator has
enabled the cane-grower to draw profit despite a falling average
of home and export prices. Further economies are in sight. A
motor cane-cutter, invented by one of the Riverina Falkiners,
seems to need only the spur of necessity to bring about
"alterations and adjustments to enable it to operate successfully
in heavy crops of green cane". The anomaly of two prices,
however, one for the patient Australian housewife and the other
for freer folk oversea, whether they buy sugar neat or in
Australian jam and condensed milk,** excites the cupidity of
other primary producers.</p>
<p class="foot">[* In 1928 the embargo was renewed until 1931. N.
Skene Smith, <i>Economic Control</i>, part <small>III</small>
chapter <small>II</small>, traces, in detail the scheme by which
prices, wages and the right to share in this industry are
"controlled". The price of sugar is ostensibly "fixed" by a Sugar
Board consisting of "a Government chairman, two growers'
delegates and, one millers' delegate". But the Board's decision,
so far from being a "control", must leave room for the prices
allowed to growers and millers by District Boards. These prices
in turn are resultants of the wages granted by state wage-fixing
tribunals to cane-cutters, cultivators and millhands. The prices
allowed for cane have been attractive. Since the present system
was elaborated the number of growers has increased from 3930 in
1920 to 6730 in 1923. Since 1925 indeed, the Sugar Board and the
Central Cane Prices Board have intervened to stop expansion (i)
by refusing applications from present growers to plant new land,
and (ii) by putting an embargo on further assignments of land to
new growers. There still remains the danger that present growers
will raise more cane per acre. The Queensland yield of cane is
low per acre in comparison with Java. Similarly with labour. The
aim of the wage tribunals has been "to base the wage in the
industry upon a minimum as fair to the sugar worker, with his
irregular employment, as is the basic wage to an average employee
in fairly regular employment". High piece-rates and minima for
the 44-hour week have set up a mild rush to work in the industry,
even from far-away Italy. Preference to members of the A.W.U.,
legally established, has seemingly been a brake upon this
movement. The Court has had occasion to warn the said Union "to
be careful not to refuse tickets to men who are qualified to
become members of the Union".]</p>
<p class="foot">[** Manufacturers for export obtain a rebate on
the sugar-content of their goods equal to the difference between
the Australian and foreign wholesale prices, on application to an
export sugar committee. In 1925-6, 56 per cent. of the total
production of sugar was consumed in Australia, at a whole sale
price of £26. 10<i>s</i>. a ton, while the net value of the
exported sugar was £11. 5<i>s</i>. 9<i>d</i>. The average
price for the whole crop was £19. 10<i>s</i>. 7<i>d</i>.
per ton.]</p>
<p>Another industry expanded fast during the war as a result of
charging a high price in the home market and dumping its surplus
abroad. This was the dried fruits industry, the main homes of
which are the irrigation colonies in the Murray and Murrumbidgee
valleys.*** The earliest of these, Mildura (Vic.), established by
the Chaffey Brothers from California in the early 'nineties, the
almost contemporary Renmark in South Australia and Curlwaa
(N.S.W.) obtained water by pumping from the River Murray. Oases
of vines and citrus fruits in the dried plains of the interior
have always appealed strongly to the Australian imagination. They
excited the admiration and hope of The Times special
correspondent when, after the Bank Smash, she watched the efforts
of colonial legislatures to mend matters by promoting any, and
every form of land settlement. They seemed to offer so much
better opportunities of maintaining the amenities of life to
which settlers from Britain had been accustomed. "On highly
productive land, a much smaller portion suffices for the
maintenance of a given number of persons: consequently men live
nearer together, and are able to employ their leisure in social
intercourse, at once natural and mutually stimulating." ****</p>
<p class="foot">[*** <i>Comm. P.P</i>. sessions 1914-17, vol. vi,

Fruits</i>, 16 August 1916.]</p>
<p class="foot">[**** Flora Shaw (Lady Lugard), "The Australian
Outlook", a paper read before the Colonial Institute 1894.]</p>
<p>Government aid had not been stinted at any stage of their
history. Irrigation works on a large scale, spreading water
through gravitation channels over the Goulburn and Wimmera
valleys, had been undertaken before federation. Alfred Deakin,
having visited California and India, was their inspired patron.
In New South Wales the Murrumbidgee valley became a scene of busy
preparation after 1906. Headworks and irrigation channels were
constructed at vast expense. Money was advanced to settlers, on
the security of the land taken up by them.* Water was supplied at
rates far below the maintenance costs and interest on the works
which stored and carried it.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "As a general rule, the rate of interest
charged on advances to the settlers by the irrigation authorities
is lower than the rate payable by the Government and also less
than the rate charged on mortgage transactions with the banks."
<i>Report on Canned Fruit Industry, Development and Migration
Commission</i>, 1929, pp. 12-13.]</p>
<p>Yet it was early apparent that Californian irrigation could no
more be transplanted unmodified to Australia than could English
farms and factories. The settlers on irrigation "colonies", as
Miss Shaw noted, met more easily to "employ their leisure in
social intercourse", but their meetings, did not discover a
McArthur or a Farrer. "Their talk runs always to prices", said
Adam Smith of all venturers' meetings for recreation. There was
much cause on the irrigation blocks for such talk. Australian
markets for fruit and other small produce were soon glutted. High
wages and long voyages made those of Europe unremunerative.
Bounties of 10 per cent. on the market value of the dried fruits
they exported were paid by the Federal Government after 1907. In
1916 the Inter-State Commission reported that an Australian Dried
Fruits Association, behind the shelter of an import duty of
3<i>d</i>. a pound&mdash;equal to practically 100 per
cent.&mdash;was maintaining a high local price which, despite the
usually lower prices received for exports, gave the grower a
profitable average. It doubted, however, whether the Association
could have maintained its high local prices save by refusing to
supply its local goods to any dealer importing dried fruits
without its sanction.** The normal economic result of "profitable
prices" followed. Considerable additional areas were planted with
vines and fruit trees and Australians felt pleased at the
conquest of new oases.</p>
<p class="foot">[** The Commission had doubts as to the
consistency of this with the Australian Industries Preservation
Act, part ii, section 4 (i), but the Chairman of the A.D.F.A.
reassured it. "Our rules were submitted to the present
Attorney-General (the Hon. W. M. Hughes) who said that they were
all right."]</p>
<p>During the war the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area reached the
stage of settlement. A huge storage dam at Burrinjuck had
impounded 771,640 acre-feet of flood waters, to be spread by
gravitation over 200,000 acres in the Riverina some 250 miles
below the dam. In large part this land was reserved for returning
soldiers. Still more ambitious was a great irrigation scheme with
head works on the Upper Murray, the construction of which was put
in hand after the war. When these were well begun, however, men
began to wonder what crops would be profitable on the area of
700,000 acres which they would irrigate lower down the Murray.
The outlook for dried fruits, in spite of the Australian Dried
Fruits Association and its skilful propaganda, was not clear.
Both production and exports of dried fruits were favoured by the
beneficence of the Baldwin Government in Britain, which by a
preferential duty gave the Australian growers a sheltered market
oversea, where Australian costs might be covered, or, at least,
an average, maintained between home and export prices that would
achieve the end.* But could this be counted on permanently?</p>
<p class="foot">[* As to the similar subsidization of the later
developed Canned Fruit Industry see the <i>Report by the
Development and Migration Commission</i>, 1929, pp. 11-13.]</p>
<p>Governments have certainly occupied an unenviable position as
sponsors and guarantors of irrigation colonies. Having bought
land for closer settlement and added to its cost heavy capital
outlays on headworks and water channels, their action would have
been stultified outright had they not tried to induce settlers to
cultivate the land they subdivided and watered. Successive
governments have hesitated to call a halt in a losing business so
long as the block-holders were ready to contribute some part of
the interest on the outlay. Assistance in marketing their produce
inevitably followed. But inevitably settlers and governments
realized the rickety financial position of an industry dependent
for much of its market on the goodwill of governments half a
world away which were responsible to constituents of their own.
The number of farms occupied on the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area,
below the great Burrinjuck Reservoir, declined after 1924, owing
to forfeitures and surrenders.** Work on the mightier Hume
Reservoir, on the Upper Murray, which when completed was to
impound 2,000,000 acre-feet of water, had to be curtailed.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>New South Wales Year Book</i>, 1927-8, p.
743.]</p>
<p>Country Party leaders had not hesitated, before such portents
appeared, to press for the general extension of such plans for
the "orderly marketing" of primary products. The Federal
Government after heavy losses became unwilling to shoulder by
simple guarantees, or by "pools" which were in effect guarantees,
the financial burden of marketing surplus produce. It favoured
the constitution, at the wish of a specified proportion of those
engaged in each industry, of a Board of Control endowed with
legal power to make a levy on all such producers for common
expenses of advertising and marketing.* These legalized cartels,
soviets, boards&mdash;call them what you will&mdash;were to
control the supply put on the Australian market and to send the
balance of the production to be sold abroad at what it would
fetch. Several acts were passed during the 1924 session to
implement this. With them passed an Export Guarantee Act,
authorizing the Treasury to guarantee advances by the
Commonwealth Bank to marketing boards up to 80 per cent. of the
market value of the produce controlled.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Cf. <i>The Economic Record</i>, February 1928:
L. R. MacGregor, "The Queensland Marketing Plan", p. 133; and T.
Paterson, "The Marketing of Primary Products", p 129.]</p>
<p>Most ambitious was the Paterson Butter Scheme devised,
according to its author, "to put the producer in exactly the same
position with regard to the Australian-consumed part of his
production as would automatically obtain if there were no
exportable surplus produced".** Butter producers, especially on
the Northern Rivers of New South Wales and in Queensland, had
long been satisfied that they were as deserving of protection as
their neighbours who grew sugar-cane. Why should cane fed into
the rollers and vacuum pans of a sugar mill acquire more merit in
the eyes, more silver from the pockets, of Australian consumers
than the same sugar-cane, or its cousin maize, grown alongside it
at the same cost and fed to those paragons of the breeder's art,
Strawberry and Melba XV, the milking shorthorns? "The butter
workers are entitled to equal advantages in this supposed free
country, where justice and equity are said to dominate." *** In
1925 a Gippsland politician hit upon the means of obtaining for
the cow-men this fair deal. A voluntary combination of
butter-producers, known at first as the Australian Stabilization
Committee, imposed a levy of 1½<i>d</i>. per pound on all
factory butter, and out of this fund proceeded to distribute a
bounty of 3<i>d</i>. a pound on all butter exported.</p>

conceived, and in the February 1928 Supplement, Professor L. F.

sugar-growers was then about one million sterling. According to
Professor Giblin it, was £4,000,000 in 1928, Economic
Record, February 1928, p. 152.]</p>
<p>Exporters were naturally willing to send more butter abroad,
mainly to London. The Australian consumer, to get his share, had
to pay 3<i>d</i>. more than export parity, a little bounty on his
private account supplementing that on exports financed by the
butter-producers "among themselves". Lest greedy New Zealanders
should seek to make profit out of the improved Australian market
which the associated producers had made for themselves, a duty of
sixpence a pound was raised against imports of butter to
Australia.</p>
<p>A profitable price, as ever, stimulated the growth of the
industry. More butter was exported, for sales abroad, which now
bore a subsidy, could be pushed so long as the price paid by the
outside buyer was within 3<i>d</i>. per pound of the acceptable
export price in pre-subsidy days. But every increase in the
proportion exported made a bigger call on the levy fund. The
local price, paid on a smaller share of the total production, had
to be put higher if the profitable average price of the
dairyman's calculation was to be achieved. As Professor Giblin
drily remarked: "It is not altogether healthy for any industry to
be able to raise the price of its product as it desires without
any corresponding effort".</p>
<p>Once the "costs plus" system has been accepted, the producer
is lifted into a paradise where economy seems no longer
imperative. "Justice" names the price and the other fellow pays
it. Yet these "stabilized" costs have a curious quality of
restlessness. "There will always be a considerable number of
marginal producers who cannot make the industry pay, and will be
clamant for a higher bounty".*</p>
<p class="foot">[* L. F. Giblin, "Some Costs of Marketing
Control", <i>Economic Record</i>, February 1928, p. 150.]</p>
<p>Such local prices for butter, sugar and dried fruits raised
the cost of living in Australia and, through this, the level of
wages to a degree by no means negligible. For sugar (460 million
pounds), butter (95 million pounds) and dried fruits (28 million
pounds) are quite important items in the massed household
consumption which guides the Commonwealth Statistician when he
"weights" prices and calculates the index numbers industrial
tribunals use The rising costs are passed back to the exporting
industries by all and sundry in the sheltered industries. They
have no other resort. If wheat-growers, too, should be smitten
with the brave notion of evolving a marketing plan by which they
too may receive a profitable price&mdash;an Australian parity,
whatever that may mean&mdash;the whole burden would fall back on
wool. So would come to pass the strange vision that fell upon the
Tasmanian seer, "of Australia as one enormous sheep bestriding a
bottomless pit with statesman, lawyer, miner, landlord, farmer
and factory hand all hanging on desperately to the locks of its
abundant fleece".**</p>
<p class="foot">[** L. F. Giblin, <i>loc. cit</i>. p. 154.]</p>
<p>These schemes of price manipulation one and all bespeak a hazy
appreciation of the function of prices in guiding the economic
use of man's resources. Australians have too often legislated as
though a price might be made at whatever figure the producer in
search of an easier life chose to call "the fair thing". But the
prices that direct the goings and comings of sound prosperity are
the signs by which men learn from willing buyers their changing
needs. High prices encourage production where it affords a margin
of profit. Falling prices discourage it by wiping out the margin
or hope of profit. A government or board of control that seeks to
fake the world's prices does so at the peril of the citizens and
producers whom the faked prices mislead. It deranges and weakens
its whole economy if it forces them to work with costs that the
outer world is under no obligation to meet. And if, in doing so,
it sees fit to feed other nations with an abundance which its
price-faking begrudges to its own citizens, it adds to the
strength of others and accentuates the contrast in competitive
vigour between bond and free.</p>
