<h3>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h3>
<p><span class="aa">There</span> is happily no longer quite the
same feeling of hopelessness that there used to be in attempting
to place on record the impression made by a singer's voice, for
the gramophone and phonograph, with all their inherent defects,
can still reproduce so much of the main characteristics of a
great performance that some idea can be conveyed of what was the
effect produced by the original. There is no need, either, to
anticipate, for many a long day yet, the time when Melba's voice
shall be no longer heard in its full perfection; but still, it is
not without interest for those who may never be able to hear
Melba to know in what consisted her wonderful power over her
hearers. The parts she has favoured have been mostly the typical
examples of conventionalized opera, and it is in respect of her
voice, without any external help, that she has attained her great
position. To describe the quality of that voice has been
attempted in many passages quoted in this book; and it is
interesting to compare the various ideas it has called up in
various musical minds. Massenet's nickname, "Madame
Stradivarius," is perhaps the most apt of all, for it is the
violin that most nearly resembles the impression produced by
Melba's voice, and the very soul of music lives in her phrasing.
The tone is of a kind that defies analysis in words, for if we
call it "sweet," the epithet conveys an idea of lusciousness that
is far from true; if the words "clear," "light," or "brilliant"
are used, a hint of a sharp, shrill quality is given, which is
equally false; and it might probably be best described in a
series of negatives. There is never a trace of a tremolo; she is
constitutionally quite unable to sing out of tune; and the
faultless evenness of her notes never suggests anything in the
least mechanical. The absence of any little vocal habit which
might be called a trick is yet another of her qualities, and,
lest it should be thought that all these propositions might
convey an idea of some want of interest, it must be recorded that
in the voice itself, quite apart from the question of expressing
dramatic feeling by facial expression or gesticulation, there
exists an extraordinary power of what is called "colour." Put
Melba behind a screen, and the most rapturous exultation of
youth, or the most poignant expression of sorrow, will be
conveyed to all intelligent hearers, yet without transgressing
for an instant the canons of pure vocal art. Of how many
opera-singers could the same be said? When her manipulation of
this voice is considered, we approach the main secret of her
magical charm. Not only is her shake a thing of matchless beauty,
with the two notes as clearly audible and as changeless in pitch
as if they were played on the piano, but her singing of a scale
is a thing quite unique in its perfection. The chromatic scale of
an octave up and down which comes into the valse in "Romeo and
Juliet" is among the things that are truly unforgettable. From
the middle, as it were, of the one note she alights exactly in
the middle of the next, and the pearls to which they are often
compared are not only perfectly matched in quality, but are
threaded on their silken string with marvellous skill. Some
singers have attained such dexterity in disguising the technical
difficulty of their feats so completely that their hearer
imagines that when he goes home he will be able to perform
similar marvels for himself. In spite of Melba's wonderful ease
and spontaneity, her performance is felt throughout to be
absolutely beyond the attainment of ordinary persons, and in her
case astonishment and delight always go hand in hand.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p><span class="aa">Melba's</span> father and mother were both of
Scottish birth and descent, and came from Forfarshire: David
Mitchell, simple and strong, upright and resolute; and his wife,
Isabella Ann Dow, gentle and sensitive, but full of courage and
cheerful philosophy. Given favourable conditions, they would both
have been persons of account in any community. Mr. Mitchell has
in turn directed his energies to building, contracting,
squatting, and wine-growing, and in all he has reaped a liberal
harvest of success.</p>
<p>On two of his properties he recently discovered a soil
suitable for the manufacture of a particular kind of cement, with
which he claims that entirely fireproof buildings, including
staircases and ceilings, can be constructed speedily and cheaply
without the temporary iron mould by which Edison aims at
popularizing cement-made houses. It is significant that his
eighty years present no barrier to his cheery embarkation on this
new enterprise.</p>
<p>Both parents were sincerely fond of music; the mother, a woman
of artistic temperament and more than average culture, being an
amateur of considerable accomplishment. She also used her brush
effectively in the creation of pictures both on canvas and china,
and played the piano, harp, and organ uncommonly well. Mr.
Mitchell, too, had musical talent, but not in so full a degree as
his wife, although he made good use of a bass voice of beautiful
timbre, and played the violin with some skill. Two of Mrs.
Mitchell's sisters possessed voices of rare beauty and a measure
of musical knowledge wholly exceptional in amateurs. They were
regular visitors at Doonside, Richmond, Melbourne, where Helen
Porter Mitchell&mdash;the Melba of to-day&mdash;was born, the
third child of her parents. From her infancy she was thus
constantly accustomed to hear music, and her earliest
recollection is of crawling under the grand-piano when about four
years of age to listen in wonder and delight to her mother's
playing. In this retirement she would rest perfectly content, so
long as her mother remained at the pianoforte.</p>
<p>The father took the greatest pleasure in encouraging his
little daughter's love of music, and she has often since told
how, "when I was quite a baby, it was my great joy to sit on my
father's knee on Sunday afternoons when he used to amuse himself
at the harmonium. He would blow the bellows and sing a bass
accompaniment to the hymn which I picked out on the keyboard with
one finger."</p>
<p>When six years of age, she appeared at a school concert
organized by her aunts in Richmond, Melbourne. At this
entertainment she sang "Shells of Ocean" with such effect that
the audience asked for an encore, and the child, on her
reappearance, created a still better impression by her singing of
"Comin' thro' the Rye," in which her grandmother had taught her
the Scottish accent. The appplause of that delighted company was
her first taste of pubhc enthusiasm, and her joy was without
bounds. On returning home it was with difficulty she could be
induced to sleep, and next morning she was up with the lark in
order to talk over the wonderful concert.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image02" id="Image02"></a><img alt=""
src="1401681h-images/Image02.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>MELBA AS A LITTLE GIRL</small></p>
<br>
<p>At the earliest opportunity she hurried to her favourite
playmate, who lived in the same street, and breathlessly waited
for some reference to the entertainment of the evening before;
but the little comrade was adamant and ignored the whole subject.
After many indirect attempts to introduce it, Nellie at length
found herself unable to wait longer, and exclaimed excitedly:
"But the concert, the concert! I sang last night, and was
encored"; and she looked with eagerness in the face of her
friend, who answered witheringly: "Yes; and, Nellie Mitchell, I
saw your garter." Miss Mitchell had been particularly pleased
with her neat attire, and this unexpected shaft, coming in place
of the looked-for compliment, in an instant blotted out the
memory of the intoxicating encore, and drew the little singer
from the seventh heaven of her brief delight to the limbo of
unkind disillusion.</p>
<p>Another story tells how, at the age of eight or nine, she
crept downstairs one night long after all the family had retired
to rest, and, taking her place at the piano, began Beethoven's
"Moonlight Sonata." Before she had proceeded very far, the whole
house was aroused by the unusual disturbance; but when her father
came to the door and gazed on the little white-robed figure,
looking for once the very picture of docility, he had not the
heart to chide her, but smiled indulgently as he carried her back
to bed. At this time she remembers that her favourite songs were
"Comin' thro' the Rye" and "Nellie Bly," the latter winning her
favour because the heroine was a namesake.</p>
<p>The playthings of the average little girl had no attraction
for Nellie. Dolls were entirely outside her interest; but for a
wooden rocking-horse equipped with tail and mane of orthodox hair
she developed quite an inordinate affection, and for several
years regarded the donor, Mr. Newbiggin, who had long been
confidential manager to her father, as a being more wonderful
than any Santa Claus.</p>
<p>The little girl's early education was directed by two aunts,
sisters of Mrs. Mitchell, and their old pupil is never tired of
recalling instances of their competence and their patient
kindness to her. "My Aunt Lizzie," she writes, "possessed a
soprano voice of extraordinary beauty. I can clearly remember the
perfect control with which she used it, and the facility of her
execution, even in the highest pianissimo passages. I feel sure
she would have made a brilliant success had she become a public
singer."</p>
<p>Love of mischief led Nellie Mitchell into all sorts of
misdemeanours, and as a measure of repression she was sent as a
boarder to Leigh House&mdash;a school in Bridge Road, Richmond,
standing on high ground&mdash;from the upstairs windows of which
she could see the tower of Doonside. This possibility intensified
her grief over the new order of things, and for hours at a time
she would stand at the window screaming piteously to be taken
home. When Mr. Mitchell heard of this, he made a point of passing
Leigh House whenever he went in or out of the city, so that she
might be consoled by seeing him. But the sight of her father only
made matters worse, and when she espied him in a buggy or on top
of a bus she cried so much more that the boarding-school was set
down as a failure, and she was taken home.</p>

<small>DOONSIDE, RICHMOND, MELBOURNE</small></p>
<br>
<p>When old enough, Nellie was sent to the Presbyterian Ladies'
College in East Melbourne, a scholastic establishment of the very
highest standing, where she took fair advantage of the admirable
opportunities offered, without ever becoming in any sense a
brilliant pupil, except in the department of music, where she was
consistently and conspicuously successful. Wilful, daring,
uncomprisingly frank, and possessed of inexhaustible energy and
irrepressible spirits, she was constantly in trouble&mdash;the
ringleader in every turmoil, and the unabashed confessor of her
foibles. Together with the ordinary subjects of a girl's
education she took up singing, and received a certain number of
lessons from Madame Christian, a well-known professional singer,
who has since become a nun, and now successfully directs the
music-school at St. Vincent's Convent, Sydney; but these were not
a matter of serious attention then, and her best and fullest
thought was given to the pianoforte and organ, which at a very
early age she could play extremely well.</p>
<p>In early girlhood she became an expert in the art of
whistling, an accomplishment which in later years she often put
to practical use when studying operatic rules; and as this
attainment was supposed to be peculiarly shocking to the
sentiments of the Presbyterian college teachers, it was in a
corresponding degree particularly admired by the pupils, who were
never tired of hearing her whistle the popular airs of the day.
By way of variety, her young comrades would often cluster round
her, and say: "And now, Nellie, make that funny noise in your
throat"&mdash;this being the earliest appreciation of the natural
trill which was subsequently to serve her so admirably in her
professional career. The opinion has been hazarded that her
juvenile feats as a whistler may have helped in the development
of the unrivalled breath-control for which she is now famous.</p>
<p>The whole of her school-days were spent in the city of
Melbourne, but her holidays were divided between the different
country places belonging to her father. She was particularly well
known at Lilydale, a pretty township which, owing to its close
proximity to Melbourne&mdash;from which it is only distant about
twenty-four miles&mdash;was a regular visiting-place of the
family. Here Nellie Mitchell rode, drove, fished, and romped
generally, with an amount of hilarious zest that bewildered the
staid and delighted the joyous of the neighbourhood. No pranlv
was too wild, no mischief too disconcerting, for her. Returning
from an extended holiday in South Gippsland on one occasion, she
was so delighted at getting back to the city, that on the final
stage of the journey&mdash;a coach-drive from Hastings to
Melbourne&mdash;she allowed neither man, woman, nor child to pass
without calling out some joyous and mirth-provoking greeting.</p>
<p>"An incident of my childhood that has often been told against
me," said Melba not long ago, "relates to one of my visits to a
country place of my father's when I was about twelve years of
age. I was furious when I found there was no piano in the house,
and refused to be comforted when my mother drew my attention to a
dislocated harmonium and a concertina, which it was hoped might
satisfy me. In teaching myself the concertina I eventually wiled
away many an hour, but when that was finished I was again most
dissatisfied because there wasn't a piano. In these outlying Bush
districts it was then the custom&mdash;and, indeed, is
to-day&mdash;for a clergyman or lay-preacher to come along on
Sundays, and at the principal homesteads hold service for the
family, the servants, and the station hands, who at shearing-time
often make quite a large congregation.</p>
<p>"On one of these occasions we were visited by a worthy man who
preached a very long and, as we children thought, a very dull
sermon. When he finished he suggested that we should sing a hymn,
and my mother asked me to play it on the harmonium; but I was so
wearied by the discourse, and so full of my grievance in regard
to the piano, that my feelings got the better of me, and instead
of the hymn I played with great vigour 'You should see me dance
the Polka,' to the consternation, even horror, of my father and
mother, who sent me to bed for the remainder of the day."</p>
<p>Bubbling over with health and spirits, Nellie Mitchell's
childhood was one continuous term of joyous revolt against any
kind of restraint, and in consigning her to a day's confinement
within the narrow walls of her bedroom her parents had selected
the most telling of all reasonable punishments. She hated to be
still herself, and she hated to see other people still,
particularly if they, as a consequence, exacted quietude from
her. Her father and his brothers were fond of playing whist, and
often sat for hours at the game, their keenness in the contest
making them anxious for the utmost quiet in the room where they
played. During one of these long-drawn-out seances Nellie's
patience became quite exhausted. Procuring a pair of bellows, she
silently stole under the table, and, placing her weapon of attack
in position, blew a mighty blast up the leg of her uncle's
trousers&mdash;a proceeding which speedily demoralized the
whist-party.</p>
<p>"When I was about twelve or thirteen years of age," says
Melba, "I had what then seemed to me a real adventure. I was
making good progress with my music, and received permission to
practise occasionally on the grand organ of the Scots Church,
where my people worshipped, and where my father now and then sang
in the choir. Late one afternoon I stopped playing, and sat at
the keyboard thinking. I remained there for some considerable
time, and when at last I made my way to the door, I found I was
locked in. The verger, believing that I had gone, had bolted and
barred the doors. In a moment I worked myself into a perfect
agony of mind. The church was already dark, and the pulpit and
organ, in their grey dust-sheets, looked like some dreadful
spectres. A night alone in such a place, I thought, would drive
me mad. The frenzy was already asserting itself, when I heard a
key in the door. The verger had returned for something he had
forgotten, and I was released from my terrifying solitude."</p>
<p>On another occasion&mdash;a blazing midsummer day it was, when
the pleasures of sea-bathing seemed particularly
alluring&mdash;Nellie and a little girl friend set out for the
old Stubbs Baths, which at that time were approached on one side
across a miry swamp bridged by a long narrow plank. The great
probability of mishap for anyone who did not step with care had
no deterrent effect on Nellie, who at once began to run up and
down the narrow swaying board at an alarming speed. The
inevitable happened, and she overbalanced herself into the
quagmire beneath, from which she afterwards emerged entirely
covered with mud. In all her frolics she kept a close eye on the
neatness of her person, and the unwelcome coat of mire filled her
with impatience for its removal. Hurrying to the baths, she
secured her ticket, and instantly plunged into the sea, without
removing her clothes. Paddling about until the mud was washed
from her garments, she then changed into the regulation
bathing-dress, and played in the water until the sun had dried
her ordinary attire, in which, through her resourcefulness, she
was finally able to make a fairly presentable appearance on the
return trip home.</p>
<p>It is only to be expected that old Melbourne playmates and
friends should delight to recall memories of the many wild
frolics into which Nellie Mitchell so gaily entered in these
early days, and it is told of her that on one occasion, during
the temporary absence of the driver, she nimbly mounted the front
seat of an omnibus, and drove the public conveyance down one of
the principal streets of the city at a pace that sent the
frightened pedestrians scurrying in all directions.</p>
<p>Early evidence of a leaning towards dramatic personation is
given in a practical joke planned at the expense of her father.
The nuns belonging to one of the Melbourne convents were engaged
in a work of charity which necessitated a house-to-house canvass
for subscriptions. Nellie knew of this, and at a suitable
opportunity improvised the dress of a <i>religieuse</i>, and,
with the assistance of the servants, got to the front door
without being seen by any members of the family. She then rang,
stated her mission, and begged an audience of Mr. Mitchell, who
presented himself with some reluctance. With downcast eyes and
gentle voice she pleaded the cause of the convent charity with
such success that her father, who did not see quite clearly why
he, a Presbyterian, should support a Catholic institution, at
length gave her a sovereign. When he found out the trick played
on him by his daughter, he was easily persuaded to let her retain
the donation for herself.</p>
<p>Her early years were passed under the happiest conditions.
Given good health, an attractive home, numerous holidays, full
means for their complete enjoyment, and the tenderest parental
care, she flourished in body and mind, and, despite&mdash;or
perhaps because of&mdash;her hilarious escapades, became the
darling of the family, whose devotion she amply returned in her
own frank, unpretentious manner. For the adequate encouragement
of her musical progress an organ was built into the drawing-room
at Doonside, and she was given frequent opportunity to hear
whatever notable musicians visited Australia. Her criticism of
the artists was often of so severe a character that her mother,
as a wise measure of repression, occasionally left Nellie at home
when taking the other children to these concerts. All the other
members of the family invariably expressed the keenest delight
over the performances, but her approval was not so easily won,
and where she thought there was reason for adverse criticism she
gave it unreservedly, to the especial discomfort of her mother,
who feared that the precocious judgment of the child indicated a
want of musical sympathy and appreciation. Madame Arabella
Goddard was the first artist to leave an impression of unusual
gifts on the mind of the young critic.</p>
<p>It was at this period that she conceived the idea of herself
performing at a real concert in the drawing-room at Doonside, and
she carried through all the preliminaries with perfect
completeness. Her father, seeing in this entertainment a possible
step towards the professional life which had already been
suggested for his daughter, and which he both feared and opposed,
sent round to all the family friends and begged them not to
attend. His canvass among her prospective audience was very
successful, for only two people presented themselves on the day
fixed for the concert. She, however, neither stormed, nor wept,
nor made a fuss of any kind. She just took her music and went
through the arranged programme as formally, as cheerfully, and as
carefully, as though her audience of two had been an overflowing
house at London or Paris on a gala night.</p>
<p>On another occasion, while still in the amateur status, she
organized a concert at Sorrento, Victoria, where she was
holiday-making with her family; the object being to provide a new
fence for the local cemetery, the dilapidated appearance of which
had appealed to her kind heart through her order-loving eye. She
had used up all available funds on the expenses of preparation,
and, when the bill-posting came to be done, had no money in hand
to pay for that item. Unwilling to sacrifice valuable time and
burden the concert with any unavoidable expenses, she at once
resolved on a novel means of escape from the dilemma, and, armed
with a brush and a pot of paste, she went out after sunset and
did the bill-posting herself, making a particularly good show on
the cemetery fence that was to be repaired by her efforts. At the
concert she sang "The Angel at the Window" (Tours) and "Sing,
Sweet Bird" (Ganz), receiving much applause from the audience,
which completely filled the Mechanics' Institute. The newspaper
accounts described the concert as quite above the ordinary
amateur standard, and upwards of £20 was realized for the
cemetery funds as the outcome of her good management.</p>
<p>It was in 1881, before Nellie's voice had ever been formally
heard in public, that the death of her mother brought her the
first experience of a real sorrow. So very deep was the
impression created by this bereavement that she can even now
recall with poignant realism every detail of that scene of
sadness. The affection existing between mother and daughter was
one of unusual tenderness, and on the first copy of a photograph
of herself, taken in Paris at the time of her début, she wrote an
inscription to the unforgotten dead: "To my dear mother and best
friend."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p><span class="aa">On</span> December 22, 1882, at Brisbane,
Queensland, took place the marriage of Charles Nesbitt Frederick
Armstrong, youngest son of the late Sir Andrew Armstrong, Bart.,
of Gallen Priory, King's County, Ireland, to Helen Porter
Mitchell, eldest daughter of David Mitchell, of Doonside,
Richmond, Melbourne. Mr. Mitchell had welcomed the marriage of
his daughter as the sure termination of her aspirations after a
professional life, and in paying Signor Cecchi and her other
teachers for the tuition received up to that date he felt a
certain parental satisfaction that there would be no more
disturbing music-lessons. She spent the whole of 1883 in
Queensland, where her husband was interested in sugar-growing.
During this term the future prima donna had a narrow escape from
drowning. Mr. Armstrong took his wife and a guest out in a small
sailing-boat at Port Mackay, and on crossing the bar they were
soon in difficulties. A squall struck the little craft, which was
overturned, and the three occupants were immersed in the deep
waters of the Pacific. They succeeded in holding on to the
upturned boat until assistance arrived from the pilot-station,
where the look-out man had fortunately witnessed the accident.
The heat and the monotony of life in North Queensland were not at
all to the liking of Mrs. Armstrong, who almost regarded the
yacht capsize as a welcome break in the dull routine of life.</p>
<p>Miss Mitchell's marriage made a very considerable break in her
musical studies, but at every possible opportunity she
endeavoured to improve herself as a performer on the organ and
piano. Her principal teachers on these instruments were Mr.
Julius Buddee, Mr. Guenett, and Madame Charbonnet
Kellermann&mdash;the last a clever Frenchwoman, whose daughter,
Miss Annette Kellermann, has been much in the public eye of late
years as the champion woman swimmer of the world. From early
girlhood Mrs. Armstrong played the organ on many occasions at the
Scots Church, Collins Street, and as a contributor of piano and
organ solos she soon came to be in wide request for amateur
musical functions. Her success as a musical amateur, and other
circumstances, led to a wide popularity, which eventually came to
be a considerable tax on her available financial resources, and
this condition provided an extra and welcome excuse for her
adoption of the professional life, to which she had always felt
herself drawn. She had taken singing-lessons at intermittent
periods from Signor Pietro Cecchi, a retired Italian singer, and
as a result she now and again sang at some small private parties,
where, however, her piano solos were always the main attraction.
Over and over again it was freely stated that if she became a
professional pianist she would be sure to make a pronounced
success. At one of these private musical soirees given at
Government House, Melbourne, Mrs. Armstrong supplemented her
pianoforte solos by a vocal selection. At the conclusion of the
latter, the late Marchioness of Normanby, wife of the then
Governor of Victoria, said: "Child, you play brilliantly, but you
sing better. Some day you will give up the piano for singing, and
then you will become famous." This was at a time when everyone
had been thinking of Mrs. Armstrong as a possible pianist, and so
it was that Lady Normanby was the first person to suggest the
career of a singer for the young amateur. This lady's prediction
shifted the whole channel of Mrs. Armstrong's thoughts, and on
Saturday, May 17, 1884, as a pupil of Signor Cecchi, she made her
first public appearance as a singer at a complimentary concert
for the benefit of Herr Elsassar, a local musician who had been
overtaken by misfortune. Thenceforward her reputation in
Australia as a vocalist began to grow, and during the latter part
of that year and throughout 1885 she regularly sang at concerts.
The first regular engagement she received was from Mr. George
Musgrove, of Williamson, Garner, and Musgrove, the well-known
Anglo-Australian impresarios, who gave her £20 a week during a
concert season. Allowing for four concerts a week, this sum would
work out at about £5 for each concert&mdash;terms which Mrs.
Armstrong considered quite satisfactory. Seventeen years later,
when she had become the most famous prima donna of the day, Mr.
Musgrove was once more the impresario of her Australian concert
tour, during which the receipts on one occasion at Sydney reached
such a figure that her net share of the proceeds was
£2,350&mdash;the largest sum ever paid to any singer in any part
of the world for a single evening's vocalization.</p>
<p>The most important engagement she fulfilled in 1885 was for
the initial tour just mentioned, with the Kruse concert party,
which was headed by a very clever compatriot, Mr. Johann Kruse,
who had already won liberal fame in Europe as a violinist, and at
whose home in Richmond, Melbourne, Miss Mitchell had already
found many opportunities of revelling in that musical atmosphere
which she so sincerely loved. The Australian public, as a whole,
did not regard Mrs. Armstrong as a vocal marvel, but the
newspaper critics, in the most whole-hearted manner, proclaimed
her remarkable gifts, and she worked on with untiring energy
towards the perfection of her musical heritage. But because of
the easy circumstances of her family, her early marriage to a man
of good prospects, or some non-evident cause, the Australian
public never allowed her to separate herself entirely from the
ranks of the amateur; and when, after eighteen months'
experience, she decided to try her fortune in Europe, it could
not be reasonably claimed that the people of her own country
recognized in her the possibilities of future greatness. In
December 1885, she sang in Sydney, New South Wales, with the
Sydney Liedertafel and the Sydney Philharmonic Society, and on
each occasion, especially for her share in the latter's
production of the "Messiah" under the conductorship of Monsieur
Henri Kowalski, she received the warm commendation of the
critics. A month later Mrs. Armstrong gave a farewell concert on
January 22 at the Masonic Hall, Sydney, when the Hon. Daniel
O'Connor, on behalf of her friends, presented her with a handsome
gold badge, which Lady Carrington affixed on her breast. Lord
Carrington was at that time Governor of New South Wales, and he
and Lady Carrington on that evening began the friendship which
has been kept up ever since.</p>
<p>Towards the close of 1885 Mrs. Armstrong was engaged as
principal soprano in the choir of St. Francis's Roman Catholic
Church in Melbourne, then and now noted for its splendid musical
service. She regarded this recognition of her musical progress as
very encouraging. Perhaps it is because of it that, although she
still belongs to the denomination of her forefathers, she
cherishes a lingering interest in all things appertaining to the
Roman Catholic Church, the picturesque ritual and romantic
traditions of which would in any case appeal to her artistic
sense. On severing her connection with this choir as a
preliminary to her departure for England in March 1886, the
members presented her with an illuminated valedictory address,
couched in terms of extreme eulogy and good-will. She had only
been with them for four months, and the kindly feeling which they
showed, in spite of the brevity of the association and the
difference of faith, may be cited as an early instance of that
power of winning strong regard which has since become one of the
happiest features of her personality. During Mrs. Armstrong's
brief Australian career as a singer, she appeared in different
cities of the Eastern States with varying financial success.
Severed engagements of considerable local importance fell to her
lot, but in a bid for the sustained support of the public,
through the medium of a concert tour given during January 1886,
she was rewarded by such scanty patronage that in some cases the
receipts did not cover the rent of the hall.</p>
<p>Now, as has already been mentioned, when back again in
Melbourne, more than a year after her marriage, Mrs. Armstrong
had, on the pressing invitation of Signor Cecchi, resumed her
singing-lessons with him at such irregular intervals as her
circumstances would allow. These lessons had been continued
during 1885, but with greater irregularity, owing to her frequent
absences from Melbourne at the concert engagements she fulfilled
in that year at Sydney, Ballarat, Bendigo, Hamilton, and other
places. In Melbourne, too, her concert appearances were many, if
not very lucrative. Under these circumstances Signor Cecchi had
said that he would make no charge for these intermittent lessons,
but that, if she ever made the success which he believed she
would make, she could then pay him&mdash;an arrangement not
unusual in the musical profession. How liberal that payment would
have been those who know the singer can easily understand.</p>
<p>All this time her heart was set on seeking fame in
Europe&mdash;an ambition which Signor Cecchi consistently
encouraged. Towards securing funds for the purpose of travel and
study, she gave concerts in New South Wales and Victoria, which,
as already stated, ended in financial failure. Thus, at the
beginning of 1886 she was still, apparently, far from the
realization of her dream. Her father had by this time become
convinced that her craving for an active life in music must be
seriously reckoned with, and when he was appointed Victorian
Commissioner to the Indian and Colonial Exhibition held in London
that year, he invited Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong to accompany him,
and agreed to pay for a year's lessons under whatever teacher she
selected. The farewell concert in Sydney had left a small
financial balance to her credit, and that held in Melbourne
realized the modest sum of £65. Supplementary to her father's
assistance, this money would help to pay for clothes and the
other expenses necessarily incidental to her ambitious
undertaking.</p>
<p>When everything was settled, and when the prospect of a fair
start seemed favourable, Signor Cecchi, acting on foolish advice,
or for some other reason, applied for immediate payment at full
rates for the lessons he had given her during the preceding
twenty months. At first the young singer was so astounded that
she regarded the demand as a joke; but her momentary doubt was
soon and sadly dispelled. Once again it seemed that the great
desire of her life was to be thwarted, and this time by the
teacher she had always gratefully esteemed as a friend. Fearful
lest the knowledge of Signor Cecchi's action should reach her
family, and revive their scarcely dormant opposition to her
professional aspirations, she was reduced to a state of great
mental embarrassment, and designed one expedient after another,
until she finally found a friend willing to lend her the money
for the satisfaction of her teacher's account. When she got the
loan, she paid to the last penny the full amount of Signor
Cecchi's claim, which may have been made in a moment of chagrin
or misunderstanding, but which, nevertheless, filled her with
sorrow and disappointment. Then she drove the circumstance from
her memory&mdash;or at least appeared to do so; for the name of
Signor Cecchi never again escaped her lips, and if she has been
resolutely silent as to his share in her early vocal training,
her lips have also been as resolute in the still more
characteristic silence that refused to link his name with one
word of blame.</p>
<p>The Governor of Victoria and Lady Loch were the principals in
the audience at the Melbourne Town Hall on Saturday, March
6&mdash;the occasion of Mrs. Armstrong's farewell concert in her
native colony (now State). Here again the critics were unanimous
in their praise, and if during the two preceding years the public
had not given the young singer the support she deserved, it was
not through want of intelligent direction on the part of the
authorities to whom musical amateurs usually look for guidance.
In the years that followed, the Australian people were so fearful
lest they should allow another "Melba" to go forth to the great
world of Europe without proper recognition, that every local
vocal aspirant who announced her intention of seeking European
fame was rewarded with exceptional evidence of public interest
and generosity. On March 11, 1886, Mrs. Armstrong, accompanied by
her husband and baby and her father, sailed for England
preparatory to entering on her task as a student of grand opera,
in which domain of music she had now definitely decided to
endeavour to make a name. This decision on the part of one who
had never heard grand opera, in whose environment there was not a
single fostering element towards that goal, and whose young life
was already largely filled by her husband and little son, was in
itself striking evidence of the independence of her character,
and of that mysterious call which guides the destinies of the
singer who is born, not made.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p><span class="aa">On</span> May 4, 1886, a few days after her
first arrival in England, at the opening of the Indian and
Colonial Exhibition in London, Madame Albani sang "Home, Sweet
Home," and at its conclusion Mrs. Armstrong, who had listened
throughout with rapt attention, remarked, with a gratified sigh:
"That's worth coming from Melbourne to hear." This initial
element of greatness&mdash;the ability to appreciate greatness in
others&mdash;was early manifest in Melba, who in the succeeding
years has given constant evidence of the most whole-hearted
<i>camaraderie</i>.</p>
<p>The indefinable inner persuasion as to future success in a
musical career which Mrs. Armstrong had felt in a vague way since
her earliest childhood, and the confidence in this future which
later years definitely developed, were not destined to receive
any impetus during the period immediately following her first
arrival in England. She sought a hearing wherever possible, from
persons of established positions in the world of music, and the
opinion they expressed was not calculated to cheer the young
Australian in her self-imposed task of winning operatic fame. As
ill-luck would have it. Sir Hubert Parry had been forced to make
a rule against hearing in private the applicants for musical
distinction who were just then arriving in shoals, and so could
not even grant her a hearing for which she had asked.</p>
<p>The late Sir Arthur Sullivan did not consider her vocal
attainments sufficiently good to justify his suggesting her
inclusion in the Savoy Opera Company, although he did add that,
if she worked hard, he might be able to get her an engagement in
"The Mikado" after a year's further study. The prospect of
entering the musical profession through the medium of light
opera, however, had no real attraction for her. After an
interview with Signor Alberto Randegger, Mrs. Armstrong received
the disheartening intimation that he did not feel warranted in
accepting her as a pupil. In after years Sir Arthur and Signor
Randegger were numbered among her warmest friends and admirers,
and on many an occasion of triumph for her she used to tease them
both for their early want of confidence in her powers&mdash;a
want of confidence probably justified by some temporary
circumstance. The result of these setbacks on the young and
ambitious Australian, just arrived in a country of the conditions
of which she knew little or nothing, reduced her to considerable
depression, yet in no way interfered with her determination to
fight for success. The first glimpse of encouragement she
received in London was from Mr. Wilhelm Ganz, who pronounced a
favourable opinion on her voice, and gave her an opportunity to
sing at Emil Bach's concert in Prince's Hall on June 1, 1886, and
also at the dinner of the Royal General Theatrical Fund in the
Freemasons' Hall. She had brought a letter of introduction from
Mr. A. Cellier to Mr. Ganz, who further made an appointment for
her with Mr. Carl Rosa; but the note of appointment which the
manager had pencilled on his cuff as a reminder escaped his
attention, and when she called at Mr. Ganz's house in Harley
Street, where the meeting was to take place, he was not there.
She waited long and patiently, but he never came, and, although
most anxious for an opening, it is characteristic of her that she
could not be induced to make a second appointment with the
momentarily careless manager.</p>
<p>Mrs. Armstrong soon realized the advisability of entering on a
term of study abroad, and she went to Paris and presented herself
to Madame Mathilde Marchesi, to whom she bore a letter of
introduction from Madame Elise Wiedermann Pinschoff, wife of the
Austro-Hungarian Consul at Melbourne, herself a singer and
teacher of considerable reputation. Madame Marchesi's reception
of her visitor was very cordial, and after the young aspirant had
sung her first song, the veteran teacher turned away, and,
without speaking, hurried to the door of the apartment. Mrs.
Armstrong, already severely disappointed by expert opinion in
London, was in a state of acute eagerness for Madame Marchesi's
pronouncement, and when the old lady moved as if to leave the
room, the few intervening moments seemed like so many hours. On
reaching the door, Madame Marchesi, without any preliminary,
called to her husband: "Salvatore, Salvatore! at last I have
found a star." The relief which this announcement gave to the
waiting student was unbounded, and, as she has often since
remarked, she then considered herself already well advanced
towards her ideal. Marchesi's fear seemed to be that the
new-comer would not take her art very seriously, and on this
score she questioned her closely. Taking both the Australian's
hands in hers, she said: "Mrs. Armstrong, are you serious?"
"Yes," answered the other simply. "Then," added Madame Marchesi
with great emphasis and decision, "if you are serious, and can
study with me for one year, I will make something extraordinary
of you." The old lady pronounced the word "extraordinary" in two
quite distinct words, as though by this means she could more
forcibly impress on Mrs. Armstrong the possibilities of her
future. The new student quickly gave ample evidence of absolute
earnestness, untiring industry, and exceptional
intelligence&mdash;qualities which were of incalculable value in
the development of her natural musical equipment. She was
consumed with ambition, and no self-sacrifice was too great if it
brought her nearer the realization of her lifelong dream. At
first Madame Marchesi was puzzled as to where she should place
her latest pupil, who regarded it as a very happy chance that all
the preparatory sections of the Marchesi school were full, thus
giving an opportunity for her immediate entrance into the opera
class without any of the usual preliminaries. To one so young and
high-spirited as Mrs. Armstrong, to whom the adoption of a
profession was, after all, more a matter of pleasure than of
necessity, Paris&mdash;then little less than fairyland to her
untravelled eye&mdash;must have made a strong demand for the
dissipation of her time. But no plans for sight-seeing or
amusement interfered with her exemplary industry. Every day she
devoted eight hours at least to the study of music, as a matter
of course using her voice very little, but using her brain in the
mastery of technique, theory, and traditions.</p>

<br>
<small>MADAME MATHILDE MARCHESI AND MELBA</small></p>
<br>
<p>During the early days of her studies in Paris, when going
through the Mad Scene from "Lucia," Madame Marchesi was so severe
with Melba that the pupil burst into tears, and, hurrying from
the room, resolved to discontinue her lessons. Melba is not prone
to hasty resolutions, and when she determines to do a thing, she
generally does it. While waiting to banish the evidence of her
recent tears, Marchesi came into the room, and, throwing her arms
round the dissatisfied student, said: "Nellie, Nellie! you know I
love you. If I bother you, it is because I know you will be
great. Come back and sing as I wish." This affectionate and
tactful appeal was sufficient for Melba, who has often said that,
if she had gone away that day without a reconciliation, the whole
trend of her career would probably have been altered.</p>
<p>Unlike the great majority of students, Mrs. Armstrong's time
was necessarily divided by the irresistible claims of a husband
and infant son.</p>
<p>Madame Marchesi's attention and interest were lavishly given
to her pupil, for whom she evinced as much affection and
consideration as though she were her own daughter. At a
<i>matinée musicale</i> given by the distinguished teacher at her
residence in the Rue Jouffroy, Paris, during December of 1886,
the Australian soprano was included in the programme, and for the
first time sang under the name of Madame Melba&mdash;an
appellation happily derived from Melbourne,* her native city, and
since made famous in all parts of the civilized world. The idea
of the change of name originated with the teacher, but the name
itself was the suggestion of the pupil&mdash;both having every
reason to be satisfied with a selection which had the merit of
brevity and euphony, linked to that of ease of spelling and
pronunciation for every nation in Europe. At this <i>matinée</i>
Ambroise Thomas was present, and heard Melba sing the Mad Scene
from his opera of "Hamlet," in the study of which he subsequently
gave her great assistance. Even at this stage her efforts won
warm approval from the general audience, and the newspaper
critics who were present voiced their praise in the
<em>Figaro</em>, <i>La Liberté</i>, <i>Le Sport</i>, and other
publications. Ambroise Thomas, who took a deep interest in her
later progress, encouraged her by warm compliments, and on that
day began for her an invaluable friendship with the great
composer, who in the succeeding years always addressed her as "ma
belle belle." Another incident of that <em>musicale</em> was the
engagement of Madame Melba by Mr. Maurice Strakosch for a term of
years&mdash;a contract from which she was freed by his lamented
death at a time when he and the management of the Brussels
Opera-House were both presenting a claim for her services.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Melba was born on the anniversary of the
proclamation of Melbourne as a town by Governor Bourke, so that
her own birthday and that of her native city occur on the same
date.]</p>
<p>Strakosch, who was practically the first to recognize the
remarkable gifts of Adelina Patti, was a man of unusual
discrimination, and his first hearing of Melba made an
instantaneous impression. He was enjoying a cigar in the
smoking-room of Madame Marchesi's house, when the strains of
"Caro Nome," as sung by the Australian student, rang out from the
music studio. He put aside his cigar, listened in silence to the
end, and then said to Marchesi's husband, the Marquis Castrone de
la Rajata: "I want that voice. I do not know whether she is short
or tall, pretty or plain: I want her." During these student days
in Paris, Melba was fortunate enough to meet both Gounod and Leo
Delibes, as well as Ambroise Thomas, and their interest and
friendship had an enormous influence in the quickening of her
artistic instinct.<br></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p class="quote">"Nellie Melba, mon amie chérie et l'élève de mes
rêves avant qu'elle fût mon idéal de
l'artiste."&mdash;<span class="aa">Mathilde Marchesi</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">After</span> nine months' preparation in the
Marchesi school, Madame Melba made her first appearance on the
operatic stage at the Théâtre de la Monnaie, Brussels, on
Thursday, October 13, 1887, as Gilda in Verdi's "Rigoletto." From
the first she was announced as a "star," and the result of that
evening more than justified the unusual course which the
management had adopted with regard to the young singer. The
supporting cast included Monsieur Engel as the Duke, and Monsieur
Seguin as the jester; while the conductor's chair was occupied by
Monsieur Dupont, who had already made a high reputation in
London. The whole performance was admirable, but the success of
Madame Melba, who had only had three stage rehearsals, stood out
definite and emphatic, and the morrow found her already famous.
News of her triumph was telegraphed all over Europe, and managers
and other connoisseurs hurried to Brussels to hear her. Every
paper in the Belgian capital accepted her as a singer born to
greatness, and for whatever dramatic shortcomings she showed on
this her first stage appearance the Brussels critics were ready
with reasonably sympathetic explanations.</p>
<p>This attitude was all the more commendable since the
traditions of the local opera had to a necessary extent been set
at defiance, by the fact that Madame Melba sang in Italian
instead of French&mdash;the official tongue of the Monnaie stage.
Although she had a good knowledge of the French language, Melba
at that time had not freed herself from an objectionable English
accent. In order to introduce the Australian singer under the
best possible conditions, the directors ran the risk of offending
many of their patrons by making the above-mentioned concession.
But even this circumstance, and the known fact of her
inexperience, seemed to help, rather than hinder, the readiness
of her acceptance by a generous public. The <i>Indépendance
Belge</i> next day wrote of her as a "revelation," and described
her voice as unique in quality, with a remarkable trill and
perfect technique; while her person was described as elegant and
distinguished, and her face mobile and sympathetic. Melba was
also complimented on her intelligence in acting. The <i>Étoile
Belge</i> was equally favourable, and, accepting her also as a
revelation and a star, boldly placed the young Antipodean with
"the profile of an Empress" in the same category with Patti and
Nilsson. Veteran connoisseurs said they could not believe their
ears when they heard her incomparable crystal voice. <i>La
Chronique</i>, in dwelling on "the sensation of the day," alluded
to the warm, velvety quality of her superb voice, her trill of
mathematical exactitude, her distinguished and gracious presence
and sympathetic face. <i>Le Menestrel</i> noted that she sang;
with remarkable sentiment, style, and expression. <i>La
Réforme</i> was enthusiastic over the exceptional purity of her
voice and the charm of her singing; and <i>La Patriote</i>, in a
summary of her success, said: "Before two years Madame Melba will
be known as La Melba." All the papers were in the same vein, and,
as it happened, within a single month the Brussels critics
designated the young novice La Melba. Madame Marchesi, who had
come to Brussels for her pupil's début, was delighted. The Queen
of the Belgians attended the opera for Melba's second
performance, and before the evening was over said: "It is the
most beautiful voice I have ever heard." Her Majesty summoned
Melba to her box to congratulate her, and thenceforward became
her most enthusiastic patron.</p>
<p>The second opera in which Melba appeared at Brussels was
"Traviata." Referring to this time, she has said: "How little I
then realized the pitfalls and difficulties of the career I had
chosen! The opinion of the management and the criticisms of
'Rigoletto' had been highly gratifying, so I was next given the
leading rôle in 'Traviata.' The vocal demands of this part,
although so heavy, I could reasonably fill; but the stage
requirements were exceptionally exacting for a novice, and one of
the newspapers in the next day's notice dwelt on my evident
inexperience. This was the first paper I saw, and, although all
the others were full of generous encouragement, I could not
forget the one snub. I cried almost incessantly for a whole week
at the recollection of this particular criticism. Then I took
heart again, and threw myself into my studies with fresh vigour,
resolved to work until I got to the top." The date of the
"Traviata" production was November 9, 1887, only three weeks
after her début, and in its criticism of this rôle the <i>Étoile
Belge</i> said: "Those who were at the last representation of
'Rigoletto' were able to note the great progress made by Madame
Melba in the scenic interpretation of the part of Gilda, and how
this exquisite singer was asserting herself as a comedian. Even
they will have been surprised at the really remarkable manner in
which she has composed the part of the 'Traviata.' We felt sure
that she would invest the character with rare distinction, a
charming physiognomy, and all the seductions of a marvellous
voice, but we could scarcely expect that she would have so
completely understood and rendered its touching features, the
phases of passion and tenderness, and the heart-rending
conclusion. Not only is it Violetta the perfect Italian singer,
but it is also Dumas' Marguerite Gautier. Her person and
deportment are perfectly adapted to the portrait as depicted by
Dumas." The third character in which she was presented to the
Belgian public was Lucia in Donizetti's opera of "Lucia di
Lammermoor." The greatest interest was aroused by this
announcement, and the house was crowded for the occasion. Her
previous success was further emphasized, and her singing in the
Mad Scene created an extraordinary impression.</p>
<p>While resident in Brussels, Monsieur Gevaërt became greatly
attached to her little boy, and often invited the child to lunch
with him on Sundays. One of these occasions provided an awkward
moment for Melba. Close to the distinguished director's house a
funeral procession passed, and, replying to a question from
Master George, Monsieur Gevaërt, a fine, vigorous man, apparently
in the prime of life, but with a manner grave even for his years,
explained that the procession meant death, which came to all when
very old. The child looked at his host, and, with embarrassing
candour, said: "Tu dois mourir bientôt, parceque tu es bien
vieux, tu sais."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p class="quote">"Votre voix idéale avec une pureté
surhumaine."&mdash;<span class="aa">L. Delibes</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">For</span> some months Melba had been
preparing Leo Delibes' opera "Lakmé," and had experienced the
inestimable advantage of studying it with the composer himself.
All the time possible she had devoted to perfecting herself in
the French language, yet immediately before the
production&mdash;which took place on March 8, 1888&mdash;the
directors held a meeting, which Monsieur Delibes attended, at
which it was discussed whether, in view of Melba's still
unsatisfactory accent, it would be advisable to permit her to
sing in that tongue. It was then that Delibes, who was enraptured
with the young singer's interpretation of his work, broke in:
"Qu'elle chante 'Lakmé' en français, en italien, en allemand, en
anglais, ou en chinois, cela m'est égal, mais qu'elle la
chante."</p>
<p>In spite of the slight difficulty with the language in which
she then sang publicly for the first time, Melba made another
striking success, and the verdict of the composer was repeated by
the critics and the whole opera-going public. Madame Melba then
rigorously continued her French studies under Mademoiselle
Tordeus, a most accomplished professor, and, by giving six hours
a day to this section of her work, soon became a complete master
of the language.</p>
<p>The last opera in which Melba was presented during her initial
season at Brussels was "Hamlet," given at the Théâtre de la
Monnaie in April 1888, before a brilliant audience. Here again
the Australian singer was peculiarly favoured in having her study
of the part personally guided by the composer, who had heard her
as a student at the Marchesi school, and whose gratification over
her impersonation led to his description, "The Ophélie of my
dreams."</p>
<p>The Queen of the Belgians sent for Ambroise Thomas, and, in
offering her congratulations, reminded him that she was then but
renewing the greeting she had extended to him seventeen years
earlier, when "Hamlet" had its initial representation in
Brussels. Her Majesty also sent for Melba, to whom she repeated
her assurances of unbounded admiration.</p>
<p>This opera led but to the repetition of all the eulogy that
had been bestowed on her earlier rôles, and by this time Melba
had become the spoiled child of the public, the darling of
Brussels. Never had success been more immediate and emphatic;
never had any prima donna so surely secured a place in the hearts
of the people. It was, therefore, with very fair hopes that
Madame Melba looked forward to an appearance in London; a young
British singer coming before a British audience would, she
argued, be sure of a sympathetic, if not a generous, verdict.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<p class="quote">"Melba's art is as spontaneous as the murmur of
the brook. She sings because she must sing."&mdash;<span class=
"aa">François Auguste Gevaërt</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Madame Melba</span> made her operatic début
at Covent Garden, London, on Thursday, May 24, 1888.
Notwithstanding the immediate and sustained success which she had
made at Brussels during the preceding season&mdash;a success to
which Sir (then Mr.) Augustus Harris attached unflinching
faith&mdash;her acceptance by the London critics was a matter of
tardy growth. In operatic circles a good deal had been said
beforehand about the remarkable beauty of Melba's voice, and the
audience assembled for her first appearance expressed their
appreciation in hearty and oft-repeated applause. The opera
chosen for Melba's introduction to the London public was "Lucia
di Lammermoor," which many of the critics considered too
conventional a vehicle on which to base their definite judgment.
Her second appearance was in "Rigoletto," with Scalchi and
d'Andrade. It is curious to recall that the quality of the voice
and the perfection of vocal method, on which they have since
lavished every possible measure of praise, did not, for some
reason or other, strongly appeal to the critical faculty as a
body on the occasion of the young Australian singer's entrance
into the ranks of Covent Garden artists. In view of some
subsequent expressions of opinion by the same critics as to
Melba's dramatic qualities&mdash;opinions which in later years
were once more reversed, and generously reversed&mdash;it is
curious to recall that during her first London season, when she
was practically without any stage experience, she was generally
accepted as a promising actress. Brief extracts from the
criticisms of the day on the first two rôles she
essayed&mdash;Lucia and Gilda&mdash;are appended. The
<i>Times</i>: "Madame Melba availed herself of the dramatic
opportunities to considerable advantage, and especially the
painful scene with her father in the Duke's palace was realized
with truth as well as delicacy." The <i>Daily Telegraph</i>; "In
moments of intense feeling she is capable of striking effects
that seem spontaneous." The <i>Daily Chronicle</i>: "She appears
to have mastered the dramatic features of the character she
represents." The <i>Morning Post</i>: "Her admirable
interpretation of the dramatic situation in the Marriage Scene
inspired all those who were concerned with her." The
<i>Standard</i>: "Her capacity as an actress is quite sufficient
to render all possible justice to the character." The <i>Pall
Mall Gazette</i>: "Accomplished in acting." The <i>Observer</i>:
"Genuine dramatic instinct." <i>Vanity Fair</i>: "Displays much
emotional power as an actress." The <i>Globe</i>: "Her acting was
graceful, expressive, and dramatic." The <i>Weekly
Advertiser</i>: "Acted with much dramatic force and true
expression." The <i>Queen</i>: "The part really affords no scope
for originality of treatment, but she at times gave evidence of
ability to portray genume dramatic passion." The <i>Morning
Advertiser</i>: "Intelligent dramatically." The <i>Echo</i>:
"Fine artistic qualities, both from a vocal and dramatic point."
The <i>Era</i>: "Charming simplicity and expression of style in
keeping with the spirit of the character." The <i>Lady's
Pictorial</i>: "Betrayed in certain scenes a strong dramatic
instinct, while her impersonation generally was marked by
admirable intelligence and feeling." The <i>Stage</i>: "As an
actress she has much in her favour." The <i>Musical Standard</i>:
"Shows dramatic power." The <i>St. James's Gazette</i>: "Her
dramatic singing in the scenes with the Hunchback is very
impressive." Still, as a young prima donna it was of the voice
and her use of it that she most wished to hear. These expressions
of opinion as to her acting capabilities, from those considered
best qualified to judge, would have been accepted by any young
actress and the public to whom she was appealing as a general
acknowledgment of her dramatic gifts. The acceptance should have
been all the more ready in view of the fact that, apart from
about thirty performances (four weeks of the actress's ordinary
routine) at Brussels, Melba had never been on a stage in her
life. Further, she had never even seen grand opera until during
her visit to Paris the year before, and, of the rôles she
sustained at the Monnaie, the only one she had seen played was
Gilda in "Rigoletto," at the close of which she naïvely confessed
that she thought she could sing it better herself. She has never
yet witnessed a performance of "Lucia," in which she was
introduced to the London public, and with which her name, owing
to her incomparable rendering of the Mad Scene, has ever since
been intimately and peculiarly associated. Melba was naturally
very much gratified by the unexpected appreciation of the
dramatic side of her work, which was then at a very undeveloped
point; but the criticisms of her voice were entirely different
from what she had anticipated, and she made no secret of her
disappointment. Although to-day in a position of such splendid
independence, Melba is nevertheless, and despite her natural
perseverance and intrepidity, still easily discouraged, and must
have been doubly so at the opening of her career. No one nowadays
despises more than she the ridiculous adulation which is supposed
to be the only coin of address acceptable to a famous prima
donna; yet at that time there can be no doubt but that the
criticism of praise would have accelerated her artistic
expansion. On returning to Paris, Melba, even in the noon of her
undiminished student activity, gave much thought to the attitude
of the English critics, and, as a consequence, decided that she
would relinquish her engagement at Covent Garden for the ensuing
season. Mr. Augustus Harris openly stated that if any foreign
artist had come to London with the same qualifications as Madame
Melba, that foreigner would have been received by the English
connoisseurs with unreserved enthusiasm. He was considerably
disappointed over the lukewarm praise given to the young
colonial, and with prophetic emphasis said: "In a little time
they will clamour for Melba above all others, and, by gad!
they'll have to pay for her, too."</p>
<p>"I wonder," said he, "do the English public ever realize the
hardship of their apathy, more especially towards one of their
own?" The difficulties of an operatic career for any girl are
great, but in the case of an Anglo-Saxon they are enormously
greater. Take the case of Melba. No matter where she sings in
opera for the rest of her life, she will have to use a foreign
tongue, and will always be in a position of peculiar and trying
isolation, for Britain's contributions to the operatic world are
so few that they count for nothing. In an Italian company she
will always be surrounded by Italians, in a French company by
French, and in a German company by Germans&mdash;all zealous for
their country's honour. When she sings in New York or London, the
same conditions will obtain; even at Covent Garden the very
chorus is made up of foreigners, whose sympathies, like those of
the conductor and the principal singers, naturally lean towards
the performers of their native land. Even a sprinkling of her own
people in any company where she was singing would be sure to give
great courage to an English prima donna. Without that sprinkling
she must often feel alone and disheartened. Why, even a man
would. It's like Daniel in the lions' den. I know Melba is made
of the stuff that will override these circumstances; but I know,
too, that the place she will take will be taken in the face of
double difficulties&mdash;difficulties which foreign artists, who
almost invariably sing in their native language, never encounter
to anything like the same extent. Was not Miss Edwards [Signora
Favanti], an English opera singer whose début at Her Majesty's in
1844 Lumley described as one long scene of triumph, eventually
driven from the stage of her own country and broken in health by
the jealousies, misrepresentations, and intrigues of her foreign
colleagues and their partisans?"</p>
<p>It is, however, worth recording that Mr. Harris was then a
good deal nettled by the slowness of the London public to
recognize the gifts of any artists he presented. This
conservatism he accounted inconceivable, especially in the case
of the de Reszke brothers. "Their success was quicker than
usual," he said, "but not complete as it should be. With Melba
the same sort of thing has happened, and in the middle of the
season she came to me with tears in her eyes, and, asking release
from her engagement, returned to Brussels." It was subsequently
claimed that this very precipitancy deprived the critics of
adequate opportunity to appreciate her art, which is so
peculiarly unobtrusive that it may be said to require a more
intimate knowledge than the showy methods of more sensational
singers.</p>
<p>In Australia, during the early days of her striving after
artistic recognition, the public&mdash;apart from the
critics&mdash;did not evince even ordinary appreciation of her
gifts. In America it was only after she had made several
appearances that her unusual qualities were fully recognized, and
in England there was a still longer period of probation before
the establishment of her great artistic position. This hesitancy
on the part of English-speaking communities is all the more
significant since in Paris, Brussels, Milan, St. Petersburg,
Vienna, Berlin, Stockholm, and other centres where music is held
to enjoy a wider and fuller understanding than among the
Anglo-Saxon race, her success has in each case been instantaneous
and emphatic.</p>
<p>In October 1888, Melba was back at the Théâtre de la Monnaie
for her second season in Brussels, and the flattering reception
she received on her reappearance in "Lakmé" was but a pledge of
the ever-growing favour with which the Belgian public regarded
her. During the third week of November she again essayed the part
of Ophélie in "Hamlet," and the critical faculty of Brussels
joined in the most cordial commendation of the advance she had
made as an interpretative artist since her début. Every point of
progress in voice, acting, bearing, or reading, was seized on,
and held up for approval, and, spurred on by this encouragement,
Melba made really admirable progress. Late in February of 1889
(probably February 25) Gounod's "Romeo and Juliet" was staged, in
order to present the Australian singer as the daughter of the
Capulets. Monsieur Engel was the Romeo of this production, in
which Monsieur Maurice Renaud played the rôle of Capulet. Melba's
success in the new rôle was nothing short of a triumph, and the
Belgians lost no opportunity of showing their esteem of the
singer, whom they had come to regard as one of themselves; while
the Belgian Royal Family evinced a most unusual interest in the
prima donna, who was regularly summoned to the Queen's box to
receive Her Majesty's congratulations and encouragement. Up to
the time of the tragic death of the Crown Prince Rudolph of
Austria, the Queen, who had an admirable knowledge of music, had
been a regular attendant at the opera on Melba nights. During the
Brussels season of 1889 the directors of the Paris Opera had
endeavoured to secure Melba for their revival of "Romeo and
Juliet," but the Brussels management very naturally refused to
part with their strongest attraction, and eventually Madame
Adelina Patti once again graced the stage of the French house in
the Gounod revival. Although Melba was pressed with many demands
on the little leisure she could snatch from the routine of a busy
student's life, she found time to give her valuable help at
charity performances organized in Liége and elsewhere, and she
also made successful appearances in oratorio. At the close of the
opera term in April, the subscribers presented the departing
prima donna with a beautiful diamond as a souvenir of their
affection and admiration. To this gift she attaches particular
significance, and has ever since treasured it as something
specially valued and loved.</p>
<p>On the evening of her farewell at the Monnaie, Melba was so
affected by the people's enthusiasm that she was obliged to bury
her face in her hands to hide her emotion. She received more than
sixty bouquets from her friends and admirers in Brussels, and the
occasion naturally left an impression which fondly lingers in the
great singer's memory. The English colony in the Belgian capital
took a leading part in the demonstration to the young British
singer who had won so unique a place in the favour of the city.
On April 14, 1889, His Majesty the King of the Belgians presented
her with the gold medal of the Brussels Conservatoire, and with
this official token of the people's esteem she left the city of
her operatic birth.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<p class="quote">"A la chère Juliette que j'espère, à Nellie
Melba."&mdash;<span class="aa">Charles Gounod</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> termination of Melba's contract at
Brussels found her free to accept an engagement at Paris, where
she made her début at the Opera on Wednesday, May 8, 1889, as
Ophélie in "Hamlet." The occasion was one fraught with much
anxiety to the new-comer, who rightly estimated the value of a
favourable verdict from the French public, and who under the
circumstances of her comparative inexperience hardly dared to
expect it. Added to her natural nervousness, there were many
ulterior circumstances calculated to unnerve the most
experienced. The production had been postponed more than once to
admit of the appearance of the accepted exponent of the Queen,
Madame Richard, who had been incapacitated by a long illness.
Late on the afternoon of the day finally decided on for her
début, Monsieur Lassalle, with whom Melba had rehearsed, was
stricken with sudden hoarseness, and so she had to appear with a
Hamlet whom she had never even seen; a difficulty accentuated
further by the fact that she had not been able to have a single
rehearsal with the orchestra. In the following day's review of
the occasion. Monsieur August Vitu, the eminent music critic of
the <i>Figaro</i>, after alluding to these truly exceptional
conditions, credited Melba with a success in the earlier portions
of the performance, and "a triumph after the Mad Scene which
literally moved the audience to frenzy." Continuing, he
wrote:</p>
<p>"Madame Melba possesses a marvellous soprano voice, equal,
pure, brilliant, and mellow, remarkably resonant in the middle
register, and rising with a perfect <i>pastosita</i> [rich
softness] up to the acute regions of that fairy-like major third
which is called <i>ut, re, ni</i> above the lines. Her personal
appearance was an advantage to her: tall, slender, gifted with an
expressive physiognomy. She was applauded in her first duet with
Hamlet, 'Doute de la lumière,' then in the air 'Mieux vaut
mourir' and in the second duet, 'Ah! les serments ont des ailes,'
to which she gave a dramatic expression rare among our Ophélies;
but the occupants of the orchestra stalls, faithful to their
temperate habitudes, were disposed to regard it as somewhat
exaggerated. Madame Melba was, however, recalled after the fine
trio in the third act which drives Ophélie to desperation.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image09" id="Image09"></a><img alt=""
src="1401681h-images/Image09.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>MELBA AS "OPHÉLIE"</small></p>
<br>
<p>"Up to this point all had gone smoothly, without rising above
an excellent medium. But in the fourth act the veil was thrown
aside. When Ophélie was seen to enter in her white garments,
garlanded with flowers, and her fair hair floating down over her
shoulders, Madame Melba was transfigured. It was Ophélie herself
who charmed all eyes and touched all hearts while interpreting
with supreme virtuosity that admirable scene&mdash;the most
beautiful of all in the masterly work of Ambroise
Thomas&mdash;which seems to have been dictated to him by the
spirit of Shakespeare himself. That which ravished us was not
alone the virtuosity, the exceptional quality of that sweetly
timbred voice, the facility of executing at random diatonic and
chromatic scales and the trills of the nightingale; it was also
that profound and touching simplicity and the justness of accent
which caused a thrill to pass through the audience with those
simple notes of the middle voice, 'Je suis Ophélie.' And when at
length the echoes of the lake wafted to us the last high note of
the poor young creature, an immense acclamation saluted in Madame
Melba the most delicious Ophélie that has been heard since the
days of Christine Nilsson and of Fides Devries. She was recalled
three times after the fall of the curtain, and, as statisticians,
we have calculated that three recalls like those in the Opera at
Paris are quite equivalent to seventy-five recalls in Italy at
the very least.</p>
<p>"We might explain this evening, parodying two lines of
Voltaire:</p>
<p class="poem">"Each people in its turn has reigned upon the
scene:<br>
Australia's hour has come, as ours has been."</p>
<p>Part of the usual contribution from "A Gentleman of the
Orchestra," which always follows the formal critique in the
<i>Figaro</i>, was as appended:</p>
<p>"I would rather tell you at once that this début was a
triumph.</p>
<p>"No subscriber to the Opera since the days of Nilsson
remembers to have seen the curtain raised three times after the
Mad Scene; not by the <i>mot d'ordre</i> of a splendidly trained
claque, but in response to the unanimous demand of the entire
audience moved to its inmost fibres and quivering with
emotion.</p>
<p>"Before conquering her public as an artist, Madame Melba had,
from her first appearance, vanquished them as a woman. In fact,
an admirable harmony subsists between the two. In that tall and
handsome person, the look of profound trouble, the physiognomy so
remarkably mobile, seem made to express dramatic passion. There
breathes from her that perfume of romance without which there can
be no true Ophelia, and that aristocratic grace which befits the
fiancée of a King's son."</p>
<p>"Tall, distinguished, beautiful. The purity, the flexibility,
the precision, and caressing sweetness of her voice are
marvellous," was the verdict of Monsieur Johannes Weber in <i>Le
Temps</i>.</p>
<p>Here and there, trivial critical reservations were made as to
her foreign accent and other points in the interpretation; but
the general verdict, as voiced by Messieurs Vitu, Johannes Weber,
Victor Roger, Pierre Véron, Henri de Lapommeraye, Charles Le Roy,
Victor Wilder, Louis Besson, George Launay, Léon Kerst, H.
Izouard, and the other critics, and emphatically endorsed by an
applauding public, was one of eulogy. The idol of Brussels by a
single performance was already well advanced towards a similar
popularity in Paris, where she was acclaimed as "uniting a voice
of celestial purity to the grace of Ophélie and the art of
Malibran."</p>
<p>In the audience on the night of her Paris début were a few
Australians, including her two sisters, who in response to a
cable had come from Melbourne for the occasion, and who were
deeply moved by the success which IMelba achieved. Speaking of it
next day, she said: "I am intensely happy. It was delightful.
After the fourth act I was recalled three times, a compliment
which they say has not been paid to any singer at the Grand Opera
for over thirty years. My very first début in Paris was at a
charity concert in the Salle Erard two years ago, given under the
patronage of Gounod, by the pupils of Madame Mathilde Marchesi,
who, by the way, taught me ten rôles in less than a year. She it
was who got me my first operatic engagement, and in every way she
has been more than kind. I think that charity appearance was a
real luck-bringer for me. It was there that Monsieur Lapissida
and Monsieur Dupont, the directors of the Brussels Opera, heard
me, and decided on my engagement. They offered me 3,000 francs a
month, which I considered almost extravagant, and I do not think
any money will ever give me such pleasure. Here in Paris the
directors hesitated to fix on 4,000 francs (£160) a month for my
contract until after my début. So much the better for me, as now
they are giving me 6,000 francs. Madrid and Berlin have offered
me higher terms, much higher terms, and to-day the manager of the
Gaîté, inspired by the success of my appearance last night, has
also volunteered a better contract; but money is not everything,
so I shall stay on at the Opera.</p>
<p>"When I sang here two years ago as a Marchesi pupil at the
charity concert, two or three of the critics who heard me then
were very kind. An unkind criticism makes me unhappy, but to-day
I have no reason to be depressed. All the critics are good to me,
some very good. One or two are a little disappointed that I am a
foreigner, and an Australian at that. However, I am proud of it,
and I know the Parisians will excuse my having been born away
from their beloved France. This beautiful bouquet was sent to me
by the Australians in Paris, and gave me more pleasure than all
the rest put together. I want always to associate any success I
may have with the place where I was born, Melbourne, and that is
why I have called myself 'Melba.'"</p>
<p>The general cordiality of the French critics, which increased
with each successive appearance, made Melba ponder further on the
apathy of the connoisseurs of her own race; but individual
assurances of appreciation continued to come from London, and,
while wavering as to the future, she was fortunate enough to
receive a most kind and gracious expression of opinion from some
distinguished music-lovers, which resulted in a speedy decision
to try another season in London.</p>
<p>On taking up her residence in Paris prior to her appearance at
the Opera, it was represented to Melba that her artistic advance
would be blocked unless she took dramatic lessons from a certain
teacher whose influence was considered paramount. No one had ever
been able to make headway independent of this professor, she was
told. "That may be," said Melba, "but I will not be coerced. I
shall take my lessons from whom I like, when I like, and how I
like, and I will also take the consequences;" which she did, and
these consequences proved that young students are too often
tyrannized over by interested hirelings who flourish on
misrepresentations of this kind, and whose very existence depends
on the vicious conditions which the timidity of their too easy
dupes maintain. Happily, from the very outset Melba showed clear
confidence in her ability to succeed, and a complete independence
of those considerations of money and influence to which so many
students needlessly make sacrifice.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<p class="quote">"Combien je garderai bon souvenir, chère Madame,
de ce joli matin de mai, oil je vous attendais dans votre petit
salon, la fenêtre ouverte, en écoutant les oiseaux chanter dans
les grands arbres du
jardin.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. Vous
êtes arrivée . . . et vous avez chanté . . . et les petits
oiseaux se sont tus, furieux de la concurrence et charmés par
votre voix."&mdash;<span class="aa">Comte de
Fontenailles</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">For</span> her reappearance at Covent Garden
on June 6, 1889, Melba selected the opera 'Rigoletto,' in which
Monsieur Lassalle impersonated the jester for the first time in
England. The audience for the occasion was of very limited
proportions, for which a violent thunderstorm may have been to
some extent responsible. Her next performance was as Juliet in
Gounod's opera "Romeo and Juliet," given on June 15 for the first
time in the French language, an innovation which was largely
helped by Melba's readiness and enthusiasm, of which Augustus
Harris made grateful acknowledgment. Monsieur Jean de Reszke was
the Romeo of the occasion, and Monsieur Édouard de Reszke the
friar, with Signor Mancinelli as conductor, and the London
revival under the new linguistic conditions was an instantaneous
success. In casting Melba for Juliet, Augustus Harris was largely
influenced by the success with which she had performed the rôle
in Brussels during the preceding season, and his emphatic
expression of confidence in her ability to charm London in this
character was abundantly justified by results. Throughout the
evening her singing, acting, and appearance elicited the warmest
admiration; at every opportunity she was rewarded with vehement
enthusiasm, especially after the waltz air "Je veux vivre," which
she gave with an exquisite lightness and vocal purity that could
hardly have been equalled. The audience were entirely captivated
by the new Juliet, and the unrivalled beauty of her voice and the
perfection of her vocalization were next day acknowledged in all
the newspapers. With regard to her preceding performance as
Gilda, the <i>Standard</i> wrote: "Madame Melba seems absolutely
incapable of a false intonation, and is almost unsurpassed in the
purity and sweetness of her tones. Her shake is close and even,
the few embellishments she introduces are almost invariably in
good taste, and in all she does sincerity and dramatic force are
conspicuous. That 'Caro Nome' could ever have been better sung
than last night is difficult to believe; none but the warmest
terms of admiration can do justice to the performance." The
criticisms of "Romeo and Juliet" were in the same vein, and their
eulogy had a special significance in view of the fact that she
was closely following Madame Adelina Patti, whose great name
threw a certain glamour around every musical undertaking with
which she was identified.</p>

<br>
<small>MELBA AS "JULIET"</small></p>
<br>
<p>Melba's position was enormously advanced by the "Romeo and
Juliet" performance, and the recognition which she at one time
had despaired of winning from the critics of London was now
undoubtedly hers. By command of Queen Victoria, a state concert
was arranged at Buckingham Palace on June 28, and Melba was
summoned to take part, but at the last moment was unable to sing
owing to a bad cold. A gala performance was announced for July 2
at Covent Garden, in honour of the Shah of Persia, and His
Majesty King Edward (then Prince of Wales) made known his wish
that Melba should sing the "Je veux vivre" before the royal
party. She was also on the programme for the Mad Scene from
"Lucia di Lammermoor," which was conducted by Signor Randegger.
The charm of her appearance and the elegance of her manner,
enhanced by her operatic success, made a strong demand for social
favour, and in the salons of the most exclusive hostesses she
quickly became a <i>persona grata</i>.</p>
<p>During a performance of "Faust" this season (1889), Melba's
pluck averted a serious accident at Covent Garden. It was in the
first act, before Marguerite's real entry, so that she had no
special call to be present at all. One of the wings in the Study
Scene caught fire, and a sheet of flame was clearly visible to
the whole audience. Before the threatened panic had time to
develop, Melba stepped out and said a few words, which completely
reassured those who were beginning to get frightened. The fire
was put out, and the opera went on all right, but it was Melba's
cool resourcefulness that had saved the situation.</p>
<p>The opera season closed with "Romeo and Juliet" on July 27,
specially interesting as the wedding-day of the Duke and Duchess
of Fife. A large number of royalties, including the Prince and
Princess of Wales, the King of the Hellenes, the Grand Duke of
Hesse, and the Crown Prince of Denmark, attended the performance,
all wearing the festal favours of that afternoon's ceremony. At
the close of the opera, in addition to the National Anthem, the
orchestra played Mendelssohn's "Wedding March."</p>
<br>

<br>
<small>MELBA'S BEDROOM, SHOWING MARIE ANTOINETTE BED</small></p>
<br>
<p>The same year Melba returned to Paris under the new contract
with the Opera directors, which allowed her certain privileges as
to foreign appearances during the course of the Parisian season.
She established her headquarters in a beautiful apartment at 9,
Rue de Prony, near the Pare Monceau, where her little son, who
was at school in England, came to spend the holidays with his
mother, and where she received many of the great people who
illumined the art life of the city. The street on which her
apartment looked out led directly to the Boulevard Malesherbes,
wherein was the residence of Gounod, whose friendship largely
influenced the trend of her career. Sarah Bernhardt and Mathilde
Marchesi were comparatively near neighbours, and Artot Padilla
lived but a few doors away. In the appointments of her new home
Melba followed the styles peculiar to the period of Marie
Antoinette and Josephine. Accustomed to refined surroundings from
her birth, and with excellent taste in household decoration,
nothing was chosen because of its cost, and the whole atmosphere
of the place was one of good taste and desirable solidity. During
her residence at Brussels, Melba had made frequent trips to Paris
to avail herself of the guidance of Gounod in the study of his
operas "Faust" and "Romeo and Juliet," and now that she had
become a neighbour she was a frequent visitor at his home. He
minutely explained to her the difference between the characters
of Marguerite and Juliet, dwelling especially on the simplicity
of the poor peasant girl, who at first was too unsophisticated to
understand, and later too timid to admit, her ready adoration of
Faust. Juliet, he pointed out, was entirely different, and to the
daughter of the Capulets he attributed unblushing forwardness.
"Juliet était une affrontée," he often repeated, and, according
to his reading, Mademoiselle Capulet deliberately set herself the
task of storming the citadel of young Montague's heart. During
these invaluable lessons Gounod always wore the little velvet cap
with which his photographs have made the public familiar, and, in
order to give Melba a clearer idea of his meaning, he would in
turn sing all the parts. Thus, in his explanation of "Romeo and
Juliet" to his favourite, he would in succession be Romeo,
Juliet, Capulet, the friar, and the nurse. On one of these
occasions, in humming over the passage,</p>
<div class="negindent5">"Qui reste à sa place<br>
Et ne danse pas,</div>
<div class="negindent5">De quelque disgrace<br>
Fait l'aveu tout bas,"</div>
<p>the composer, who, despite his advanced years, was always
ready to make a joke, whispered at rehearsal in Melba's ear, with
a smile: "Ce voulait dire qu'ils avaient des cors au pied." He
took the keenest interest in everything she did at the
rehearsals, and on the evenings of the performances he would sit
in the directors' box and watch and listen intently. When she
particularly pleased him by any phrase or scene, he would
subsequently reward her with a smile and embrace. Speaking of
this time, Melba says: "I thank God for having met and known
Gounod. He awakened in me my artistic sense. He was so broad, so
human, and had so much to give."</p>
<p>As for Gounod, he was unreserved in his praise of Melba's
interpretation; he assured her and his friends that she brought
to the work all the qualities he had imagined for his heroine,
and on a photograph which he gave her at the time he wrote: "To
the dear Juliet for whom I hoped&mdash;to Nellie
Melba.&mdash;<span class="aa">Ch. Gounod</span>."</p>
<p>In the study of "Faust" Melba further had the inestimable
advantage of being assisted by Sarah Bernhardt, who took infinite
trouble in preparing the young singer for the adequate
realization of the dramatic side of the character, and who has
since had the gratification of seeing Melba's interpretation of
Marguerite accepted as a performance of striking beauty and
sincerity. The great French tragedienne, after explaining and
suggesting the possibilities of the part, was always careful to
add: "You must not imitate me. Do it your own way. You must be
natural. Be yourself." Those who are familiar with Melba's
acting, especially in "Faust," "Romeo and Juliet," "Aïda,"
"Traviata," and "La Bohème," can realize to what excellent use
she put the coaching so kindly given her by her distinguished
mentor.</p>
<p>One of her great gratifications of this period was the receipt
of the silver medal of the Paris Conservatoire. During the season
she availed herself of the privilege extended to her by the
directors of the Opera, and early in 1890 accepted an engagement
for four performances at Monte Carlo, the terms being much in
advance of any remuneration hitherto given her.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>
<p class="quote">"À la plus charmante femme; à la plus délicieuse
artiste; à la voix de pur cristal, la plus vive
sympathie."&mdash;<span class="aa">Sarah Bernhardt</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">It</span> will be seen that even before she
was entirely accepted as a popular prima donna, Melba had become
a welcome figure in society, and the manner in which she has
always kept up her social duties is one of the most surprising
points in her career. She haa never allowed herself to be
exploited socially because of her professional celebrity. In the
fashionable world she fills her place independent of her art, and
the hospitality she receives she returns on a scale of
corresponding elegance. As it is in London now, so it was in
Paris during the number of years she made her home there.</p>
<p>In the happy enjoyment of the honours which the French people
continued to heap upon her, Melba, by courtesy of the Opera
management, resumed her place at Covent Garden for the season of
1890, the opera of "Romeo and Juliet" being listed for her
<i>rentrée</i> on June 3, owing to the extraordinary success she
had made in it the year before. From every point of view the
conception of Juliet was accepted as complete and satisfying, and
the <i>Times</i>, writing of this particular performance, said:
"Nothing finer is to be seen on the operatic stage than the
impersonation of the lovers by Monsieur Jean de Reszke and Madame
Melba. So complete a union of vocal with dramatic power as exists
in both artists is granted to few singers, and it may be imagined
that the three beautiful duets which form the chief point of
interest in the two parts were perfectly sung." A week later
Madame Melba made an important step in her career by her first
appearance as Elsa in "Lohengrin," of which the <i>Pall Mall
Gazette</i> tersely said: "She plays the part, sings the music,
and looks the character, to perfection." It is worth recording
that for this performance she had only one piano rehearsal, and
none at all with the orchestra.</p>
<p>Although in the previous year, and again on June 26 of this
year, she had the compliment of being summoned to take part in
state concerts at Buckingham Palace, and in the gala performance
to the Shah of Persia, it was for the afternoon of July 4, 1890,
that Melba first received the honour of a command from Queen
Victoria to sing privately to Her Majesty, who was then in
residence at Windsor Castle. Melba and her comrades, Messieurs
Jean and Édouard de Reszke and Lassalle, were received with the
utmost graciousness by the aged Sovereign, to whom she sang,
among other things, "Caro Nome" and the waltz song from "Romeo
and Juliet." She and Monsieur Jean de Reszke took part in the
duet from "Traviata," and when the Empress Frederick, who came in
late, asked for extra numbers, it goes without saying that they
were given <i>con amore</i>. When interviewed concerning the
Windsor visit, Melba devoted most of her attention to the doings
of the de Reszkes and Lassalle, and of Mancinelli, who had played
their accompaniments.</p>
<p>Replying to a question put to her at the Hôtel Métropole,
where she then had her headquarters, she said: "Well, of course,
we were all rather nervous, but the Queen has such a gentle,
pleasant manner; she puts one at ease without any ado, and was
full of kindly compliment to us all. Mendelssohn was right in
describing her as a connoisseur of good music, but, as you may
naturally suppose, her sympathies lean rather more to the old
Italian than the new school. We sang the whole of the last act of
'Faust,' although, according to the programmes published in the
papers, only the trio was performed. Jean de Reszke, whom the
Queen described as the finest tenor since Mario, sang the
'Preislied,' and the Empress Frederick, who was most kind and
charming, said that one number made her long to hear the entire
opera ["Die Meistersinger"], which was then being beautifully
given at Covent Garden." From the Queen Melba received a pretty
jewelled souvenir of the visit.</p>
<p>"I do not have to trouble much about my voice," continued
Melba on the same occasion. "On the contrary, I enjoy my life,
and do not make myself a slave to my profession. Only the other
day I was at an important luncheon where the host had the honour
of entertaining the Prince of Wales [King Edward VII.]. All the
afternoon I was talking and laughing, yet when a telegram came
from Mr. Harris asking me to sing that night in 'Faust,' as Jean
de Reszke was not well enough to appear in 'Le Prophete,' I was
quite ready. When I had seemed to hesitate for a moment. His
Royal Highness said: 'Do sing; I shall be there.' I did, and, in
spite of my earlier exertions, the performance went off well.</p>
<p>"The Prince has been extremely kind to me ever since I came to
England. He is, indeed, the most tactful, clever, and courteous
of men, always ready to grant a favour even to those who have no
special claim on his consideration, and scrupulously exact in
carrying out anything to which his word may even only appear to
bind him. As for the Princess, she is simply delightful, so
gracious and appreciative. How is it, I wonder, that, wherever
one may see her, she is always the prettiest woman in sight?"</p>
<p>Goring Thomas's "Esmeralda," which was staged on July 12, was
another Melba novelty for that season, and was given with a
French text for the first time.</p>
<p>For this occasion the composer made sundry alterations in his
score, adding a whole scene, which, when all is said and done,
did not add much to the dramatic force of the work; for it is a
prison scene which cannot fail to remind all who hear it of the
similar scene in "Faust," and the more so since there is an
invisible chorus of female voices behind the scenes. The soprano
air at the beginning of the scene is of exquisite quality, and
brought out the tender pathos of Melba's voice to perfection. The
succeeding duet with Frollo, which she sang with Lassalle, is of
less musical value, and has not the dramatic vigour that the
situation requires. An "Air des Cloches" replaced Quasimodo's
charming "What shall I do for my Queen?" and the denouement,
originally a conventional "happy ending," was given some
plausibility by being made tragic.</p>

<br>
<small>FACSIMILE GREETINGS FROM GOUNOD AND GORING
THOMAS</small></p>
<br>
<p>Melba bestowed infinite pains on the words and music, which
latter she considered charming, although catchy and hard to
learn. Her reading of the part was clever, and her singing was,
of course, one of the great charms of the performance, which was
witnessed by the Prince and Princess of Wales, and which resulted
in ardent calls for the composer.</p>
<p>The musical world was given another chance to test her quality
on July 21, when she made her first London appearance in the
French version of "Hamlet." The <i>Daily Telegraph</i> held that
the result both in virtue of musical and dramatic talent ranked
Madame Melba's Ophélie amongst the best; while the <i>Times</i>,
though considering her dramatic impersonation inferior to
Nilsson's, held it vocally to be one of Melba's best parts, the
Mad Scene being a marvellous and brilliant display of delicate
and perfect vocalization.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* "There she incontestably proved her right to
be regarded as one of the finest artists who have ever appeared
at Covent Garden. Perfect vocal art and high dramatic
intelligence were equally and happily blended in a climax which
fairly took a somewhat cold house by storm. We have heard nothing
like it since Nilsson sang the part. It saved the
opera."&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>.]</p>
<p>Further éclat was given to Melba's rapidly growing favour by
her singing at Marlborough House on July 25 before the Prince and
Princess of Wales.</p>
<p>The season closed on July 28 with a performance of "Carmen,"
in which Jean de Reszke sang the rôle of Don José for the first
time in England.</p>
<p>It may be recorded here that Melba's advent at Covent Garden
was most welcome to the staff of the theatre, who often chafed
under the conditions of superficiality and affectation which
leading singers, as a rule, had hitherto thought it desirable to
uphold. Miss Alice Joseph, the concert agent, who during Melba's
early years at Covent Garden was private secretary to Augustus
Harris, said one day to a caller at his office: "Melba is a
revelation to most of us; she is so reliable and so reasonable.
The stage hands love her. She is simple and natural, neither shy
nor bouncing. During her first season many of the musical people
said she was the coming 'star,' but while she had sufficient
confidence in herself, she never said so. I recall her exclaiming
one day during that season that her great ambition was to sing
with the de Reszkes. When the following years brought her the
fame she desired, she never altered, but retained a fine
combination of dignity and simplicity. Unlike the average artist,
she had no superstitions when she came to us, and had even
selected the thirteenth of the month for her operatic début; but
I think she cultivated a few in deference to the 'Governor,' for
later on she refused to be photographed in any costume until
after the public production. I remember on her birthday one
season he handed her a packet of letters which had been addressed
to the theatre. Many of them were messages of kind
wishes&mdash;among them a card on which was a peacock's feather
in bold design. As she was drawing it from the envelope, he
caught sight of it, and, with an expression of exaggerated
horror, snatched it from her hand, and tore it into little bits
before she could even see from whom it came. 'We can't have
anything unlucky like that in the house,' he explained to Melba,
who was greatly surprised and amused."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>
<p class="quote">"La prima donna incontestée de notre Académie
nationale de musique [Paris]."&mdash;<span class="aa">Emmanuel
Bourguet</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Melba's</span> only appearance at the Opera
Comique, Paris (Théâtre des Nations), was on the occasion of the
matinée performance of "Carmen" given on December 11, 1890, to
raise funds for a statue to perpetuate the memory of the composer
Bizet, whereat she established a precedent for great prima donnas
by electing to sing the brief part of Micaela, which had hitherto
been interpreted by artists of secondary importance. The
title-rôle on that day was sung by Madame Galli-Marié, the
original French exponent. The receipts of the matinée reached the
exceptional sum of 42,000 francs. At Covent Garden Melba
subsequently volunteered to enact Micaela to the Carmen of Madame
Emma Calvé, the brilliant successor to Madame Galli-Marié; and
later on in America, when at the head of her own company, she yet
again followed this commendable example by singing the minor
character to the lead of Mademoiselle Zélie de Lussan. Modesty,
reasonable self-effacement in the interests of art, and a
willingness to share the glamour of her position with great or
obscure colleagues, are qualities which Melba has always shown in
such a degree as to excite the incredulity of those who are more
familiar with the real or imaginary stories of violent
professional jealousy.</p>
<p>The death of Leo Delibes in Paris on January 16, 1891, was a
sincere sorrow to Melba, who owed much to his kind interest. By
the death of the Earl of Lytton that year another tie that had
closely bound her to Paris since she first went there to study
was broken. During Lord Lytton's term at the Embassy he and his
brilliant wife, whose interest permeated the whole British
colony, had been warm friends to the young British singer, who on
more than one trying occasion was supported by the sympathy and
encouragement of Lady Lytton.</p>
<p>In 1890 Melba received the unique honour of an imperial
summons from the Czar Alexander, desiring her to appear at the
Imperial Opera, St. Petersburg, where, during February 1891, with
Jean and Édouard de Reszke, she took part in a series of
brilliant productions, which included "Lohengrin," "Faust," and
"Romeo and Juliet." In accordance with the command of the
Emperor, these operas were newly mounted with the greatest regard
for the completeness of every detail, and extraordinary interest
was manifested by the public. Melba's personal and artistic
success was entirely beyond all ordinary measure, and the critics
and the public generally exceeded the bounds of the most sanguine
anticipations in the eulogy and attentions which they lavished
upon her.</p>
<br>

<br>
<small>FACSIMILE PAGE BY RUBINSTEIN</small></p>
<br>
<p>Rubinstein, who was at that time engaged at the Conservatoire,
and in failing health, heard many stories of Melba's operatic
triumphs, and he wrote to her saying that, as he was too ill to
come and hear her, he hoped she would be kind to a feeble old
musician, and come to him. Her immediate reply was that she would
be honoured to act on his suggestion, and at the earliest
possible moment she made him a visit, and sang to him everything
he wished to hear. Despite failing eyesight, he was able to play
to most of her numbers, and this circumstance made the occasion
one of particular interest for Melba, who found in the great
pianist a really superb accompanist.</p>
<p>The Imperial Family honoured her with numerous evidences of
their favour, and the souvenirs which she carried away from
Russia included a turquoise and diamond bracelet from the Grand
Duchess Paul, a diamond and sapphire bracelet from the Grand Duke
Alexis, and an exquisite bracelet of uncommon design from His
Majesty the Emperor Alexander. This latter ornament, which she
always wears and regards as a mascot, is composed of engraved
diamond cubes and large pearls strung together on a slender chain
of platinum and gold.</p>
<p>Although Melba possesses a famous collection of jewels, she
does not value them much as a means of personal adornment, but
from an artistic standpoint could be easily moved to enthusiasm
by the beauty of their colouring, shape, or setting. Pearls are
her favourite, and one of the finest in her possession is a
wonderful solitaire ring presented to her by Herr von
Mendelssohn, a kinsman of the great composer, at whose house she
sang during a visit to Berlin.</p>
<p>The Grand Duke Alexis gave in her honour a dinner at which the
flowers and gold plate were magnificent. His Imperial Highness
subsequently personally conducted Melba through the show
apartments of the palace, and during the evening she sang for her
imperial hosts.</p>
<p>According to local authorities, no singer had ever so quickly
captured the favour of the St. Petersburg public, and when she
left on her return to Paris, she was made the recipient of an
extravagant farewell ovation, one which the prima donna recalls
to this day as among the most remarkable of her career. A chair
had to be placed in the wings to enable her to rest between the
recalls. On the night of her farewell performance a large crowd
assembled outside the stage-door, and when she entered the
carriage they heaped it so high with flowers that she was almost
invisible amid the banks of blossoms. A band of music-loving
youths belonging to the Russian aristocracy spread their coats on
the snow-covered footpath for her to walk on, and indulged in all
sorts of other complimentary excesses. She was surrounded by
scores of admirers who had brought photographs, programmes, and
cards on which to beg her autograph. The borrowed pencil with
which she made the signatures was eventually returned to the
owner, who was compelled to break it and divide the pieces among
importunate friends. The crowd still pressed close around her,
and struggled to shake hands, and eventually, in response to the
calls of some enthusiasts, she took off her gloves, and threw
them to the claimants, who portioned the scraps among the youths
who, like so many Raleighs, had spread their coats beneath her
feet. Such was the manner of her departure from St.
Petersburg!</p>

<small>FOUR MEDALS</small></p>
<br>
<p>Melba's season in Russia added largely to her reputation, and
when she returned to Paris to resume her place at the Opera, her
position was still more secure. If Brussels had a claim on her
because it was in that city she made her first appearance in
opera, Paris had come to explain that it had the prior claim,
since it was the training and atmosphere of Paris that had given
to the Brussels début the possibilities of success. The critics
had now no terms of reservation in their review of Melba's art.
The establishment of her home in their midst gave unqualified
satisfaction; she was cited as a typical Parisian, and amid the
acclamation of the art world she again received the silver medal
of the Paris Conservatoire.</p>
<p>During a performance of "Lucia" one evening, the tenor, who
had been ill, endeavoured to go on with his part rather than
disappoint the management, who had no deputy, but found himself
voiceless during the great duet in the first act. In order to
hide her colleague's unfortunate lapse and give the manager a
little time to help the situation, Melba with great
resourcefulness held the opera together by singing Edgardo's
music as well as her own, and thus kept the scene going until the
fall of the curtain. It happened, oddly enough, that Monsieur
Engel, who had sung the part with Melba in Brussels, was among
the audience, and his kindly volunteered services were gladly
accepted for the completion of the opera. Madame Carnot, who was
also of the audience that evening, was one of the first to notice
Melba's efforts to help her comrade, and she was most
enthusiastic in her appreciation of the prima donna's kindly
presence of mind.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>
<p class="quote" align="center">"The incomparable
Melba."&mdash;<span class="aa">Henry Irving</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Before</span> Melba had advanced far on her
professional career, the illusions natural to a girlhood free
from care had vanished one by one, and in repose her features
already bore indefinable evidence that the thorns of poor human
experience had pressed their sharpness through her rose-strewn
path. The expression of sadness still lingers on her face, but
through her cheerfulness and good-fellowship she is mainly known
to the world in general, and even to the majority of her friends,
as a woman whose habitual vivacity provokes infectious gaiety.
Reticent as to the sorrow which has been her portion, she is
inversely demonstrative as to the joy which is her share, and
loves to surround herself with those who despise the mean streets
of existence and gambol in the sunny avenues of life.</p>
<p>If Melba has always shown delightful readiness to appreciate
the art of her operatic companions, it is also pleasant to note
that the greatest among her fellows have been no less generous in
their estimation of her personal and musical gifts. What more
charming testimony than this?&mdash;</p>
<p>"La nature vous a doué d'une voix d'or, positivement la plus
belle de notre temps; vous êtes musicienne, vous êtes femme
charmante. Toutes ces qualités peuvent être appreciées par le
public, mais ce que je sais, moi, c'est que vous êtes la
meilleure des camarades, et que je garderai un éternal souvenir
de nos rélations artistiques et amicales. Comptez toujours sur
votre devoué</p>
<p align="right" style="margin-right:5%;">"<span class="aa">Jean
de Reszke</span>."<br></p>
<p>An operatic event of singular brilliance was the gala
performance held at Covent Garden on July 8, 1891, by command of
Queen Victoria, to celebrate the state visit of the German
Emperor and Empress. The naval, military, and political clubs in
Pall Mall, and other buildings along the route, were
magnificently illuminated, and a guard of honour of the 1st
Battalion of the Coldstreams was drawn up in front of the
Opera-House on the arrival of the Imperial and Royal party. Every
corner of the building was turned into a bower of flowers, and it
was conceded that no performance had ever been surrounded with
such circumstances of splendour. It was a matter of gratification
to Madame Melba to receive Her Majesty's command for such an
occasion, and it was in the rôle of Juliet that she appeared
before the illustrious visitors. The Royal circle included the
Prince and Princess of Wales, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh,
the Duke of Clarence, the Duke of Cambridge, the Duke and Duchess
of Fife, Princesses Victoria and Maud of Wales, the Duchess of
Albany, Princess Henry of Battenberg, and the Duchess of
Teck.</p>
<p>One night, during the last act of "Romeo and Juliet," the
extra curls which Melba had pinned on to supplement her own hair
became unfastened, and fell on the stage. Jean de Reszke lessened
the embarrassment of the occasion by hiding the errant tresses
under his feet and kicking them aside at an opportune moment. A
few days later, when the incident was the subject of a bantering
conversation at Lady de Grey's, the Princess of Wales (Queen
Alexandra) said, with an amused smile, to Melba: "And they were
such nice curls, too." On another occasion, when the curtain was
still down on the Tomb Scene, Jean de Reszke went on the stage to
speak to Melba. While so engaged, the curtain was rung up, and
awkwardly disclosed his premature presence in the tomb. Not for
an instant did he betray the confusion of the situation. With
perfect resourcefulness he altered the text so easily and so
effectively that few among the audience could realize that there
had been any untoward development in the action of the opera.</p>
<p>From the opening to the close of the Covent Garden season she
sang with all her wonted brilliancy, and when she left for her
home in Paris was seen off by a largely augmented gathering of
friends.</p>
<p>The routine of Melba's professional life was pleasantly varied
in the spring of 1892, when she won first prize for the most
beautifully decorated car in the Battle of Flowers at Nice. Her
artistic taste and original ideas were well illustrated in the
colouring and design of the ornamental scheme, and along the
carnival course the gay equipage was greeted with acclamation.
The Prince and Princess of Monaco, who had honoured her with many
attentions, were among the first to offer their congratulations
on her carnival victory, which was especially popular among the
English and French visitors then on the Riviera. The same evening
she sang Lucia at the opera, and there was an added warmth in the
welcome tendered her.</p>
<p>Like the majority of Australians, Melba loves horses, and
expresses the opinion that if she were a man she would endeavour
to excel at polo. Although a great believer in open-air life, she
has, nevertheless, never taken any considerable part in outdoor
games.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>
<p class="quote">"Imaginez une voix délicieuse, d'un timbre pur
comme le cristal, venant se poser sur les lèvres de la
cantatrice, avec la délicatesse aérienne d'un oiseau, et la
s'égrenant en trilles et en vocalises, sans que la fée qui laisse
tomber les perles de sa bouche trahisse le moindre effort ou la
gêne la plus légère."&mdash;<span class="aa">Victor
Wilder</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Melba</span> appeared in Sicily, in
"Traviata," at Palermo, during the spring of 1892, of which she
retains an uncommon souvenir in the shape of a solid gold
visiting-card, bearing her name and an inscribed message from her
impresario, who chose this way of keeping in her mind her initial
professional experience in the historic island.</p>
<p>Incidental to the engagement there was nothing of a peculiarly
noteworthy character, but Melba had some interesting personal
experiences. Always a bad sailor, she was unlucky enough to have
a very disagreeable water journey from Naples to Palermo, and
arriving at her hotel about five o'clock in the morning, feeling
very tired, she at once went to bed, but was soon aroused from
her sleep by the occupant of the next room, who played through
several times the 'cello part of "Braga's Serenata." Always alert
for music, she speedily aroused herself, and almost involuntarily
sang the vocal part to the 'cellist's further repetition of the
well-known air. At the close her neighbour in the next room
called out: "You sang that very well. Who are you?" The singer
answered: "I am Nellie Melba. Who are you?" "Braga," was the
response, and in this curious fashion came about her meeting with
the Italian musician. During this season she also sang at the
Argentine Theatre, Rome, in the opera of "Lucia di
Lammermoor."</p>

<br>
<p>Owing to her many engagements in other countries, Melba's
house in Paris was at this time little more than a
<i>pied-a-terre</i> for her; but she always made a point of being
there during the holidays of her little son, who was at school in
England, and whose home-comings were the brightest light in these
days of ever-growing brilliancy. Every detail that could add to
his wellbeing and increase his none too abundant physical vigour
was the mother's constant care. No matter what the storm or
stress of her professional life, no want of the little lad was
too trifling for her attention. Pictures of the boy in every pose
accompanied her on all her expeditions, and the fortune that had
come so readily to her was doubly prized because of all it would
mean in the future to her idolized only child.</p>
<p>Among the then circle of Melba's friends in Paris was Madame
Bemberg, who had been a brilliant singer contemporary with
Alboni, and for whose son, Herman, Gounod stood sponsor. Monsieur
Bemberg early gave promise of unusual musical understanding, and
the development of his artistic gifts was greatly encouraged by
the Australian singer. Before the completion of his opera
"Elaine" she sang over some of the music to him on different
occasions&mdash;an experience which aroused him to the following
expression of appreciation:</p>
<p>"Que je plains ceux qui n'ont pas eu la joie délicieuse d'être
chante par 'Elle.' Je ne me souviens pas d'une émotion plus
intense que cela que j'ai éprouvé en entendant soupirer de cette
adorable voix ces premier mesures de l'aire 'd'Elaine.' J'ai cru
rêver, et j'étais éveillé. Puisse la réalité ne pas s'envoler
comme un rove et me donner l'incomparable bonheur de voir créer
'Elaine' par l'artiste que je mets au-dessus de
toutes&mdash;Nellie Melba.</p>
<p align="right" style="margin-right:5%;">"<span class="aa">J.
Bemberg</span>."<br></p>
<p>The opera was dedicated to Melba and Jean de Reszke, who
created the two leading rôles on its production at Covent Garden
on July 5. Melba entered into all the preliminaries with unusual
zest. Jean de Reszke was equally enthusiastic, and the young
composer was naturally envied and complimented on the good
fortune that gave his work such distinguished exponents as these
two singers and Marie Brema, Mathilde Bauermeister, Édouard de
Reszke, and Pol Plançon. Melba and Jean de Reszke were repeatedly
recalled after each act, and at the close of the Death Scene in
the last act Melba had to come five times before the curtain,
while the composer himself received two calls.</p>
<p>Monsieur Bemberg enjoys life more than most people, and is
generally bubbling over with gaiety, which finds constant vent in
his capacity for outlandish practical jokes. On the day of his
first visit to Melba he took with him so magnificent an offering
of flowers, and looked so very joyous, that her butler declined
to admit the unfamiliar visitor. Bemberg, however, was
determined, and eventually the butler announced him. Before
entering the salon he held the elaborate bouquet well forward,
and asked: "May I come?" In a few minutes Melba and he were
talking and laughing like old friends. His merriment was
irresistible, and he was invited to stay to lunch. With the
afternoon came other visitors, but Monsieur Bemberg's power to
amuse his hostess and her friends never flagged, and it was only
after dinner that he took his leave, the duration of his first
call being a point which Melba is fond of telling against
him.</p>

<br>
<small>MELBA AS "ELAINE"</small></p>
<br>
<p>Bemberg's opera was the only novelty with which she was
associated that season, but her success in everything she sang
was undeniable, and before the close of the summer term she was
obliged to appear in two special extra performances of "Faust"
and "Lohengrin." "Romeo and Juliet" was also given with great
success, Melba's rôle, always vocally perfect, being now
"histrionically exquisitely poetical."</p>
<p>After a rest at Aix during the month of August, followed by
Continental engagements, Melba had her initial experience of an
autumn season at Covent Garden, in which one of her important
undertakings was her first appearance as Aïda, of which the
<i>Daily Telegraph</i> said: "It is needless to say she sang
well, for that she always does, but the feeling she threw into
her work&mdash;feeling which sometimes reached abandonment to the
passion of the minute&mdash;was a revelation of power not
generally suspected. Both her singing and acting in the scene
which ends with the arrest of Radames were fully equal to the
demands of the music and the situation." By this time her
improved work in "Lohengrin" had come to be the special delight
of her admirers, and when she appeared in that opera during this
supplementary season, the <i>Times</i> was able to say: "Madame
Melba's reading of the part of Elsa is, of course, well known,
and nothing that is not praise can be said of it; but a special
word of praise must be given for her superb singing in the second
act."</p>
<p>On November 23, 1892, she appeared as Desdemona in Verdi's
"Otello," and while the earlier numbers won a new beauty from the
girlish freshness of the voice, which makes her an ideal Juliet,
the songs in the last act were made infinitely pathetic, even
though the impersonation was not then among her dramatic
successes. As she had had only four days' study of the part, it
is not surprising that certain points were missed, or that her
usually trustworthy memory should have failed her for a few bars
in the ensemble of the third act.</p>
<p>She took a conspicuous share in the celebration of the
professional jubilee of the famous Alboni. Numbers of
distinguished men and women joined in felicitations to this great
singer, who during so many seasons had enjoyed immense popularity
in England; and the young Australian travelled from London to
Paris specially in order to pay tribute to the veteran, who
subsequently wrote:</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>
<p class="quote" align="center">"Il vostro canto e una ineffabile
carezza."&mdash;<span class="aa">Guetano Braga</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">In</span> 1893 Melba made a serious bid for
the favour of the Italian public, and on March 16 of that year
she sang at La Scala, Milan, for the first time, under conditions
and results which hare led to her often describing that
performance as the most vividly remembered of her life. The
traditions of the famous Opera-House have been exquisitely upheld
for many years by the people of Milan, who, while proverbially
generous to inexperienced musicians, have at times shown a
certain reluctance to accept as pre-eminent any singer whose
pre-eminence has not developed within Italy itself. Melba was in
this unfortunate position: Brussels, London, Paris, St.
Petersburg, Nice, Monte Carlo, had all accepted her as an
incomparable singer before she came to Milan, so there were those
in the music world of the city who determined to make light of
the fame she had won in other lands. It happened that this,
perhaps excusable, little semblance of resentment was encouraged
into an unusual measure of antipathy by one or two jealous
individuals, such as acquire a certain amount of influence in the
art circles of every large city, who had singled out Melba for a
merciless attack. A cabal was raised against her, and everything
was done to place her in the worst possible light before the
public of Milan, where she then knew nobody on whom she could
rely for encouragement and advice.</p>
<p>At all artistic haunts, where people usually well informed on
musical matters were regularly to be met, it was freely stated
that those who had heard Melba at rehearsal predicted that her
début would be a sensational fiasco, so irretrievably bad, they
said, were her voice and method. There were others who relied on
the verdict of Paris, London, and St. Petersburg as a reasonable
guide, and expressed their belief that these sinister rumours had
their origin in a ridiculous intrigue; but on the whole the
anticipations with regard to the new singer were the reverse of
sympathetic. Patti had been there in January, the <i>première</i>
of "Falstaff" had taken place in February, so that even under the
most favourable circumstances the people were in a mood to
disclaim the possibility of any further unusual enthusiasm that
season.</p>
<p>Many of the musicians, who in the ordinary way might have been
expected to pay their respects to a visiting singer of
distinction, openly expressed their intention to wait until after
Melba had been heard at the Opera, a conspicuous exception being
chivalrous Arrigo Boito, composer and poet, who at the earliest
possible moment called on Melba, and offered her the tribute of
his admiration and esteem.</p>
<p>Men of high artistic position spoke assuredly of the failure
awaiting Melba, and to such an extent was this almost farcical
opposition exploited that the leading Venetian impresario urged
her representative to abandon the La Scala season and repair to
Venice, where everything was ready for the production of "I
Rantzau." Much of the unpleasant gossip current was for a time
kept from the knowledge of the prima donna, but as a safeguard
against any such happy ignorance of the animosity cleverly worked
up by an interested clique, she was later bombarded with
anonymous letters, in which all sorts of threats were made
against her. In these missives Melba was notified that her food
would be poisoned, that the lift would be tampered with; while
the terrors of fire and water were also expatiated on as an extra
reason for her seeking safety in flight from the city. Had it not
been for the strong advice of her secretary, Melba would probably
not have sung that season.</p>
<p>But she did sing&mdash;"Lucia di Lammermoor" was the
opera&mdash;and made an easy conquest of the audience, which from
boxes to gallery, as is customary at La Scala, was made up of
those who in a special degree possess an intimate knowledge of
the best musical traditions. When Melba, however, made her
entrance in the first act, there were some people who in their
affectation of just indifference continued their friendly
conversation, and sat with their backs partly turned from the
stage, so as to give to their neighbours the attention which the
prima donna, according to rumour, did not merit. This attitude
was of the briefest duration, and by the close of the first
recitative the house was all attention. Always sensitive to the
pulse of her audience, Melba soon felt that the hostility which
had been conjured up against her had rapidly melted away, and as
the evening progressed she knew that she was in complete rapport
with the house. She had made her entry in an oppressive silence.
At the close of the Mad Scene she was greeted by a wholly
remarkable ovation. Cheers resounded from floor to ceiling, hats
and handkerchiefs were waved, almost every person in the building
stood in the effort to make more emphatic the tribute of their
appreciation, and the calls and recalls for the prima donna were
kept up for half an hour. Melba was completely unnerved by the
unexpected warmth of the demonstration. She had come upon the
stage in an agony of doubt and suspense; she left it that evening
a proud and happy victor. Never before had any audience been so
generous to a stranger, and the chroniclers of the day pointed
out that only once in living memory had a similar scene of
enthusiasm been witnessed in an Italian theatre, and that was
when Verdi himself appeared at the <i>première</i> of his opera
"Falstaff," which Mascheroni conducted at La Scala on February 9
of that year.</p>
<p>The story of the wonderful success made by Melba at her Milan
début quickly spread throughout Italy, and flattering engagements
were pressed on her from every city in the country. The critics
of the newspaper press wrote of her triumphs in terms of fervent
appreciation, and on each successive appearance she was made to
feel the growing ardour of the music-loving, warm-hearted
Italians. Owing to the impression she had made, it was found
impossible for her to leave Italy without visiting some of the
other cities, and when the Milan season terminated she was
starred at Florence, Turin, Genoa, where she sang under the most
brilliant auspices, supported by some of the soloists, the
chorus, and the orchestra of the historic La Scala
Opera-House.</p>
<p>Monsieur Victor Maurel, who was among the audience on her
first night at Milan, sent Melba the following interesting
message:</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image18" id="Image18"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>A SOUVENIR OF FLORENCE</small></p>
<br>
<p>"<span class="aa">A Madame Nellie Melba</span>.<br>
<br>
"La conquête d'un grand public par un artiste ressemble beaucoup
à la prise de possession d'un pays les armes à la main. C'est
presque toujours avec son sang et ses nerfs que l'on remporte de
pareilles victoires. Plus heureuses que les simples mortels, les
sirènes font exception à cette loi commune, et on peut leur
attribuer la fameux 'Veni, vidi, vici.' C'est votre cas, chère
amie, avec le public milanese. Votre triomphe bien merité m'a
procuré le grand plaisir de joindre mes applaudissements à ceux
de tout le théâtre. Recevez en mes sincères félicitations, et
croyez en votre admirateur,</p>
<p align="right" style="margin-right:5%;">"<span class=
"aa">Victor Maurel</span>."</p>
<br>
<p>Aldo Noseda, the critic of Italy's foremost journal, the
<i>Corriere della Sera</i>, dealt with the occasion in the
following manner: "It was a true and genuine success. Who
expected it? No one, or almost no one. The public this year is
not in an optimistic mood. To nibble now and then at a bit of
soprano, to take a mouthful of tenor, is its regular
function&mdash;in Lent almost a first necessity. The betting
might have been ten to one that almost all the spectators went to
La Scala last evening with a certain fear, mingled with
ill-concealed flattery that they were about to offer on the
holocaust of the diva Melba the complete annihilation of 'Lucia,'
the said annihilation to terminate with the sanguinary sacrifice
of the diva herself. When, at the end of the first act, the
public realized that its gloomy expectations had melted away in
the warm light of reality, it seemed as stupid as an elephant
before a corkscrew. I must confess that with great equanimity it
allowed its ears to be well pulled before it changed this
anything but benevolent mood with which it had entered the
theatre, into vociferous and continuous applause.</p>
<p>"Madame Melba won a great battle yesterday. Many are the stars
who have fallen on the stage of La Scala, and how much greater
was the fame which preceded them, how much more were we led to
expect from them! Yesterday evening's success counted as one of
the most gratifying to the <i>amour propre</i> of an artist, and,
let us frankly say, was flattering to the reputation of our
public, who discerned, with the fine taste of a connoisseur, the
exceptional qualities of the singer, who left little to be
desired even as an actress.</p>
<p>"Amongst the useless things with which the so-called wisdom of
a nation burdens itself by transmitting from one generation to
another is the foolish aphorism, 'Comparisons are odious.' The
devil they are; but how if the values should be relative, and
everything not come up to the same standard? Well, then, the
typical singer on whom we who write are forced to base our
criterion of judgment, and therefore our comparisons, is Adelina
Patti. She remains for us the most perfect exponent of the great
art of singing. How many times last evening we told ourselves
that for marvellous facility of production, for seduction of
'timbre,' for spontaneity of vocalization, for the finished art
of modulation, for pureness of intonation, Madame Melba again
renewed in us the intense enjoyment experienced so many years ago
when listening to the diva Patti! Who else now, may we ask, can
sing like Melba? It is true we have not, so far, seen her in
strongly dramatic parts&mdash;not in the great rôles of the
répertoire of new operas&mdash;neither as Elsa nor Isolde; but,
then, who suggested that as yet she has her harp completely
strung? Ah, but to bring close to our hearts' ears the magic of
the inspired melodies of the old Italian masters&mdash;no one now
interprets them as she can.<br></p>
<p align="center"><a name="Image19" id="Image19"></a><img alt=""
src="1401681h-images/Image19.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>A SOUVENIR OF MILAN</small></p>
<br>
<p>"We may add, that the facility and good taste with which she
showed she could play with what to others would be stupendous
difficulties&mdash;technique, perilous leaps, scales of the most
perfect limpidity, the purest trills&mdash;gave to this somewhat
out-of-date music a witchery and fascination entirely novel."</p>
<p>During this season Melba first made the acquaintance of the
veteran Italian master Verdi, and was deeply impressed by his
great personality. She found the wonderful old man simple and
reserved to the verge of shyness, yet the briefest of interviews
was sufficient to fix on the memory a lasting impression of his
greatness. She was later honoured with his friendship, and with
the utmost generosity he devoted a good deal of time to helping
her in the study of "Rigoletto" and "Aïda," which latter has
always been her favourite of his operas, in spite of her great
admiration for "Otello," which she was once called on to sing in
London after only four days' study.</p>
<p>It was in Milan also, during this year, that Melba came to
know some of the subsequent leaders of the modern Italian school.
A friend called on her one day when she was very tired from
travel and her professional duties, and strongly urged her
acceptance of an invitation to dinner. Owing to fatigue and the
many calls on the little leisure she had, Melba demurred. Then
her visitor broke into a long eulogy concerning a young composer,
an absolute genius, he said, whom he was anxious to present to
her, and who was to be at the dinner where her presence was so
anxiously looked for. Melba's unfailing interest in the affairs
of her art made her speedily succumb to the latest phase of
persuasion. She accepted the invitation. Always fond of studying
faces, she paid particular attention to the features of the
unknown composer, and before the dinner was over expressed
herself as ready to find her friend justified in his estimate of
the Italian's talents. Later on the composer played over his
opera to Melba, and, writing on March 8, he said:</p>
<br>
<p>"<span class="aa">A Madame Melba</span>.<br>
<br>
"Est-ce-que je pourrais avoir le bonheur inestimable d'entendre
jamais par vous 'Stridono lassù liberamente'? Ce jour-là, s'il
arrive, sera la réalisation d'un rêve, et j'entendrais dans ma
musique ce que je n'y ai pas encore entendu. Votre admirateur
dévoué,</p>
<p align="right" style="margin-right:5%;">"R. <span class=
"aa">LEONCAVALLO</span>."</p>
<br>
<p>Subsequently he asked if she would create the rôle of Nedda in
London. Her reply was an emphatic affirmative, and
Leoncavallo&mdash;for it was he&mdash;has often told of the
incentive he received from the whole-hearted admiration which she
then expressed for "Pagliacci," which was produced with brilliant
success at Covent Garden the following year.</p>
<p>Her first meeting with Puccini, who was then becoming known
through "Manon Lescaut," and whose wider fame was later on so
largely helped by her zeal, also took place this season.</p>
<p>In April she made an operatic tour of Lyons, Marseilles, and
the other large cities of France, wherein she repeated her
splendid impersonation of Ophélie before immense audiences that
increased their enthusiasm at each successive appearance, until
even the ardour of her Italian public seemed likely to be
eclipsed. The acclaim of the people was reflected in the
criticisms of the press, and every eulogistic phrase that poetic
imagination could devise was employed in these public
testimonials to her voice and art.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>
<p class="quote" align="center">"Melba the sweet, the beautiful,
the great."&mdash;<span class="aa">Marie Brema</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> opening of the London season of
1893 following so quickly on her triumphs in Italy and the French
provinces insured an ardent welcome for Melba, who reappeared at
Covent Garden on May 15 in "Lohengrin." Tremendously encouraged
by the enthusiastic verdict of the Italian public, who had even
exceeded the terms of laudation unreservedly lavished on her by
the people of Brussels, Paris, St. Petersburg, Nice, and Monte
Carlo, Melba began this season among her own race in a spirit of
true emulation. One effect of the praise so liberally meted out
to her abroad was a greater abandon in her acting, which some of
the critics, however, now thought too dramatic.* More than one
writer admonished her against any histrionic intensity that could
lead to the ruffling of her glorious voice.</p>
<p class="foot">[* "There were moments this evening when her
embodiment of the least dramatic of Wagner's heroines seemed a
trifle too pronounced."&mdash;<i>Daily Telegraph</i>.]</p>
<p>Four days after the performance of "Lohengrin," on her own
birthday, Melba redeemed the promise she had given Leoncavallo in
Italy, and created the rôle of Nedda in "Pagliacci" before a
crowded audience, which greeted the first production with
unbounded favour. Her singing and acting gave full effect to the
composer's ideas as explained and demonstrated by him during her
stay in Milan, and her success in the new rôle was one of the
brightest features of the whole season. Every performance drew
large and delighted audiences, and Leoncavallo by a single work
reached a point of unique popularity.</p>
<p>"Faust" was another strong attraction throughout the opera
term, particular significance being given to some of the
performances by the appearance of Madame Marie Brema in the rôle
of Siebel.</p>
<p>In response to the demand of the subscribers, "Romeo and
Juliet" was staged on June 2 with the invariable result, and at
the gala performance given at Covent Garden on July 4 by command
of Queen Victoria, in honour of the marriage of the Prince and
Princess of Wales, Melba once again repeated her impersonation of
Juliet with Messieurs Jean and Édouard de Reszke and Pol Plançon
in the other leading parts. For this occasion the house was
decorated in a most gorgeous manner, and an old-world note was
struck by the contingent of Beefeaters who were stationed in the
crimson-lined corridors.</p>
<p>When "I Rantzau" was listed for production on July 7, Melba
was once more a ready volunteer in the cause of modern Italian
music, and sang the rôle of Luisa in Mascagni's work, which,
however, did not entirely fulfil the promise of the young
composer.</p>
<p>Late October and November of 1893 were set aside for a first
tour in Sweden and Denmark, and in all the cities visited Melba
met with instantaneous appreciation. She sang in "Romeo and
Juliet" at the Opera-House, Stockholm, on October 31, and her
other impersonations were Elsa in "Lohengrin," Marguerite in
"Faust," whilst on different occasions she gave the Mad Scene
from "Hamlet" and the Mad Scene from "Lucia," both displays of
vocalization arousing enormous enthusiasm among a people
naturally prone to believe that no other singers could compare
with their native nightingales, Jenny Lind and Christine
Nilsson.</p>
<p>The distinguished critic of the <i>Dagens Nyheter</i>, in
dealing with her first Swedish appearance in a Wagnerian rôle,
said: "'Elsa, c'est mon idéal,' was Melba's answer when recently
asked in Copenhagen which was her favourite rôle. Melba is Elsa;
Melba, who by competent judges is said to have her greatest
strength in pure <i>coloratura</i> parts, and whose voice might
really be classed as soprano <i>légère</i>; Melba, whose dramatic
talent does not yet exist, if we may take the word of the English
critics. Well, as dramatic understanding does not reach very high
in England, one can scarcely wonder, perhaps, if she did not
trouble in that country. That, when she wishes, she can even in
dramatic work satisfactorily render the most difficult parts, it
has pleased her to show to our public. Everyone who sees her in
Elsa is soon convinced that the famous singer is also a great
actress. We scarcely believe that the representation outside the
church, where Elsa with proud dignity reproaches the artful
Ortrud, has ever before been so well acted in Stockholm.
Throughout this great scene Madame Melba acted with such alert
and subtle understanding, such admirably considered detail, that
her impersonation would have honoured even an actress of rank who
relied solely on her dramatic portrayal for her place in public
esteem."</p>
<p>Near the close of the season the King of Sweden sent a message
to Melba telling her that he had heard of her wonderful voice and
art, and asking if she could await his return to the capital so
that he might hear her. The date of her first appearance in
America had already been announced, and everything was ready for
her departure. On receipt of the King's request she cabled to
America, and under the circumstances Mr. Grau agreed to give her
an extra week's grace.</p>
<p>For the entertainment of His Majesty she sang the second act
from "Lohengrin," the Balcony Scene from "Romeo and Juliet," the
Mad Scene from "Lucia," and the last act of "Faust." He was
delighted, and rose twice in his box and bowed to the prima
donna. At the close of the performance he sent one of the
officers of his suite to thank her and request her attendance at
the palace the following morning. On arrival the King received
her with many compliments, and then formally conferred on her the
Order of Literature and Art. An amusing story, which has often
been told, relates how King Oscar found himself without a pin to
fasten the decoration on her breast, and in this emergency was
obliged to borrow one from her. Then, remembering the ancient
superstition, the gallant old ruler said, with a smile: "But this
pin may cut our friendship unless I give you something in
exchange." Leaning forward, he kissed Melba on both cheeks,
adding: "Now we shall always be friends."</p>
<p>The King's acclaim but added further fire to the people's
enthusiasm, and when Melba left Stockholm she was given such a
send-off that ordinary traffic was stopped in the streets between
her hotel and the railway-station. Her carriage was piled high
with flowers of every description, including a bouquet from the
Crown Prince, now King, and as she approached the train she was
serenaded by a chorus of 5,000 voices.</p>
<p>As foreigners are not allowed to appear on the stage of
Denmark's only opera-house, Melba's performances in Copenhagen
were confined to the concert-room. Gounod's "we Maria," "Caro
Nome," and the Mad Scene from "Lucia," were among the numbers at
her first concert on November 12. "The magnificence of the voice,
the dazzling virtuosity and personal sonorousness of the organ,
aroused the audience to a state of enthusiasm that increased
quite alarmingly during the evening." At her second concert the
hall was again crowded, and the prima donna, being then free from
the nervousness natural to a first appearance, was able to do
herself still greater justice. "There was the greatest possible
fortissimo in the applause. Again and again she was called for,
and in the Handelian air her magnificent voice and perfect art of
singing were unfolded in the most admirable way." Extra concerts
at Copenhagen were impossible, and from there she travelled to
Havre <i>en route</i> for America.</p>
<p>Melba's tour in Scandinavia was saddened by the death of
Gounod, which occurred at Paris on October 17, 1893, as she was
leaving for the North. The composer of "Faust" had always
regarded her as tenderly and as solicitously as though she had
been his own daughter, and the breaking up of his home, where she
had been wont to meet the great artists and savants of the day,
lent an added keenness to her deep sense of personal loss.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>
<p class="quote">"Les plus mortelles blessures sont faites par
les plus jolies mains."&mdash;<span class="aa">Carolus
Duran</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Melba's</span> first visit to America in 1893
was the climax to an eventful year, during which she had already
added greatly to her rapidly rising fame by her success in
France, Italy, England, Denmark, and Sweden. It tvas the year of
the World's Fair at Chicago, during which efforts were made to
secure the greatest attractions of the universe for exploitation
in America, and the Australian singer was regarded as the vocal
<i>pièce de résistance</i> of the day. Young, handsome, rich,
famous, she had the world at her feet, and it was small wonder
that she had the spirit to enter cheerily on undertakings which
made exceptional demands on her mental and physical vigour.
"Lucia di Lammermoor," "Semiramide," "Romeo and Juliet," were the
first three operas in which she sang to the Western public,
followed by "Tannhäuser," "Faust," "Hamlet," and "Pagliacci,"
which was staged for the first time in America on December 11,
and which made no appeal to the public that season when any other
singer impersonated Nedda. Owing to building operations, there
had been no grand opera in New York the season before, and this,
together with an enormous influx of visitors, had provided a
pubic eager and fresh for the Metropolitan enterprise.</p>
<p>The conditions attending her first appearance on December 4
were not wholly in her favour. The year had been one of most
arduous artistic labours for her, involving wide and constant
travel; the passage from Havre to New York had been exceptionally
boisterous, and, just as on the evening of her initial opera in
Paris, one of the principals, Dufriche, was taken suddenly ill,
and she had to act with an Enrico who had not rehearsed the part,
and who had had no time for its reasonable preparation. Besides,
she had selected "Lucia" for her début, and there were many who
frankly proclaimed this choice injudicious. It was a Patti opera,
they said. Madame Patti was at that very time making a tour of
the United States, and for any new-comer to seek the favour of
the American people in the rôle with which their idol of years
past had been so intimately identified was accepted by many as
testimony that the new singer would not be a success. There was
nothing unusually encouraging in the manner of her reception.
Several of the leading box occupants, who had already heard and
met her in London and Paris, applauded her cordially; but this
evidence of favour from people who spent much of their time
abroad, and who were suspected of foreign sympathies, did not
favourably influence the general audience. The house as a whole
did not show exceptional interest until the close of the Mad
Scene, when there was much enthusiasm, and after which Plançon,
Ancona, and other art comrades, cheered her with many
compliments. Several criticisms of the following day were mildly
favourable; others, and among them the most conservative, wholly
enthusiastic.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* "The temptation is strong to say that in vocal
equipment pure and simple she surpasses all her rivals. In finish
of vocalization she is the finest example heard on the local
stage since Sembrich made her début here ten years ago. Her voice
is charmingly fresh and exquisitely beautiful, and the tone
production is more natural and more spontaneous than that of the
marvellous woman [Patti] who so long upheld the standard of the
<i>bel canto</i> throughout the world."&mdash;<i>New York
Tribune</i>, December 5, 1893.]</p>
<p>Some interested friends tried to explain the situation by
showing that she had come a little too late, that Madame A. and
Madame B., who had been there for the opening weeks, were the
already established favourites. The Australian was not at all
disconcerted because her first night had not been a sensational
success, and she laughingly told her friends that "if it has been
Madame A. and Madame B. at the beginning, it will certainly be
Madame Melba at the end."</p>
<p>During the earlier weeks of the season efforts had been made
to establish Sunday evening concerts, contributed to by the
artists of the opera, but only the most meagre response had been
accorded to the venture. Melba was persuaded to give her support
to the failing scheme, and one month after her début her voice,
her art, and her personality were able to turn these concerts
into a remarkable success, whereat began the unusual
demonstrations of popular approval which it has ever since been
her good fortune to receive in increasing measure from the
American public. In any comparisons that were made, she was never
likened to any lesser artists than Patti and Nilsson, and
tributes were paid to the warm and beautiful quality of her voice
and the perfection of her vocalization which have never been
excelled in the criticisms of any singer. The people evinced the
keenest interest in her personality, and were puzzled yet charmed
by the reserve which never wholly deserts her even in moments of
gay and familiar intercourse. In the sad expression of her face,
doubly marked in time of repose, they read the evidence of
sorrow's discipline, and sympathetic wonder was added to their
attitude of admiration and regard.</p>
<p>She was undoubtedly greatly helped in her American conquest by
her personal appearance, so admirably summarized by Jacques
Isnardon in his "History of the Théâtre de la Monnaie": "An
English beauty. The nose is straight, long, and delicate; the
neck is exquisite, superbly set; the eye disdains
largeness&mdash;it wonders, it searches; the mouth is frank and
loving. The build of head, neck, and shoulders reveals clearly
the thoroughbred. On the stage this ensemble is poetized. Her
ideal profile harmonizes with the charm of her carriage." The
smallness and beautiful shape of her ears, hands, and feet are
additional points that appealed to her new world of admirers, who
also went into raptures over her soft-speaking voice and musical
laugh.</p>
<p>A peculiar attraction of Melba's face lies in the unusually
delicate eyelids and long curling lashes which shade her
strangely coloured red-brown eyes. Although of little more than
the average woman's height, she carries herself with such grace
of bearing that even among tall people she appears to be of
rather exceptional stature.</p>

<br>
<small>MELBA AS "ELIZABETH" IN "TANNHÄUSER"</small></p>
<br>
<p>The production of "Tannhäuser" in French on January 29, 1894,
with Melba in the rôle of Elizabeth, was her first introduction
to the American public in the music of Wagner, and the
Metropolitan Opera-House was filled with an eager and sympathetic
audience. Mancinelli conducted the performance, in which Signor
Vignas was Tannhäuser, and Signor Ancona, Wolfram. In discussing
the production, the <i>New York Tribune</i> alluded to "the
marvellous talents of Melba, who can uninterruptedly display the
most perfect of musical instincts," and paid a warm tribute to
the art of Plançon, who was also in the cast. After taking some
exception to different points, and to the appearance of lyric
artists in Wagnerian rôles, the same journal continued: "Melba
made superb use of the wealth of voice with which Nature has
endowed her. Its power and ringing timbre, together with the
perfect utterance which is hers, made her Elizabeth singularly
effective." The general verdict was one of warm favour, and the
audience encouraged Melba with unstinted applause.</p>
<p>In the conservative columns of the <i>New York Sun</i>, Mr. W.
J. Henderson, the eminent critic, wrote that "Melba's treatment
of the scene with Tannhäuser in the second act was so beautiful
in the finish of its declamation, and so just in its intent, that
it amazed the soprano's friends, and put her enemies, if she ever
had any, to confusion."</p>
<p>A week later, when "Lohengrin" was staged at the Metropolitan
(February 6, 1894), the Italian text was again adhered to, and in
support of Melba as Elsa there were Signor Vignas as Lohengrin,
Signor Ancona as Telramund, and Monsieur Édouard de Reszke as the
King. As was to be expected in the initial performance, there
were different points of dramatic immaturity in her
representation, which was "musically rich in the same excellences
as her Elizabeth. The astonishing sustaining power of her voice
and the reposefulness of her singing rested like a benediction on
every moment of her performance." * In summarizing the details,
the same critic said that the magnificence of her wardrobe was
without a parallel as far as the local stage is concerned. The
<i>New York Herald</i> critic wrote: "Incomparably the most
attractive thing she has done since her advent. Such passages as
'Einsam in trueben Tagen' and 'Euch Lueften' were never more
beautifully phrased. In the third act she surprised me by such
depth of feeling and faculty of surrendering herself to the
dramatic situation with so much abandon and such nicely concealed
art. The manner in which she sank to the ground, as well as her
attitude of utter despair, after Lohengrin had slain the
murderous intruder, were most beautifully conceived and carried
out."</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>New York Tribune</i>.]</p>
<p>The official New York season closed with a performance of
"Faust" on February 23, 1894, when the Metropolitan was packed to
the doors, and so many people were unable to obtain admission
that the management felt justified in arranging a supplementary
term to be resumed after the company had returned from the other
cities for which they had been booked. On this production of
Gounod's work Melba sang Marguerite for the first time in New
York, and made an instantaneous success in the part. The Faust
and Mephistopheles of the evening were the superb artists Jean
and Édouard de Reszke. In every respect it was an occasion of
triumph for Melba, who by her singing, acting, and bearing
literally took the audience off their feet, and received again
and again the tribute of frenzied applause. "Since Nilsson there
has been no Marguerite the equal of Melba's. It was incomparably
the most remarkable performance given here this season. Such
purity of tone, amplitude of volume, such breadth of style, came
as a genuine revelation." ** At the close of the opera she was
greeted with a tempest of enthusiasm, renewed until finally the
two de Reszkes pushed a piano on the stage, and she sang "Home,
Sweet Home," to the accompaniment of the great Polish tenor.</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>New York Herald</i>.]</p>
<p>In Chicago, for the moment the world's capital, Melba won an
unparalleled success. Here again she chose "Lucia" for her first
appearance. The <i>Herald</i>, after commenting on her voice and
method, said: "Madame Melba, who has achieved a triumph which may
well be regarded as an historic episode, with which comparisons
will inevitably be made for many years to come, is a
prepossessing and queenly woman, whose unaffected manner and
simplicity of style commend her at once to the good graces of an
audience. A handsome and expressive face, graceful carriage, and
an apt, though by no means pretentious, dramatic instinct, still
further commend her to attention and admiration. It is the voice,
however, that fully completes these engaging endowments, a voice
which places her above any other soprano known to the operatic
stage at the present time. It is idle even, through fear of
appearing over-enthusiastic, to deny the self-evident fact of her
commanding superiority. There is but one voice belonging to the
generation with which Melba's may properly be compared, and that
is the voice of Patti as it was known to us and admired a dozen
years ago, when in the full glory of its prime. It exhibits the
same faultless timbre, the same purity and smoothness throughout
a wide range, the same electric quality, the same elasticity and
flexibility, the same richness and colour. And yet there is a
tinge of added warmth to give it individuality. Her faculty of
execution is a marvel. The stage has seldom known a finer example
of tone production, or a voice more persuasive and enchanting.
Such a triumph so magnificently rounded out and complete is
almost without a parallel in the history of our stage." Other
journals wrote in even more glowing terms, and so exceptional was
the impression she created that even the most conservative of
critics seemed to abandon the usual reserve of their craft, and
heaped upon her encomiums couched in terms of unprecedented
appreciation.</p>
<p>In "Semiramide," wherein Melba had the support of Madame
Scalchi and Monsieur Édouard de Reszke, and in which she had
already captivated New York, she but confirmed the opinion
expressed on the opening night, and the <i>Record</i> described
her as "the greatest artist of the time." By the day of her third
appearance, which was in "Romeo and Juliet," the whole city was
ringing with praises of the new "star"; and although this
production took place on Holy Thursday, a day on which numbers of
Americans absent themselves from public amusements, the
auditorium was thronged by a vast assemblage. The cast for
Gounod's opera included Jean and Édouard de Reszke. The applause
on her exit from the balcony was so demonstrative that Monsieur
Jean de Reszke's succeeding number was twice interrupted ere the
uproar could be quelled.</p>
<p>The enthusiastic attitude of the critics and general public in
Chicago had a most stimulating effect on Melba's work, and,
sensitively responding to every fresh phase of encouragement, she
regularly enhanced her place in popular esteem. Every succeeding
performance saw a broadening of her dramatic reading, an
additional subtle touch in her vocal expression. Of her
warm-hearted interest in the work of her colleagues, major and
minor, she had already given many illuminating instances. During
a performance of "Tannhäuser," Signor Vignas, finding himself
suddenly out of voice, was obliged to omit some of the music, a
course which greatly disappointed the audience, and audiences
under these circumstances are nearly always prone to think the
singer might have tried, any way. To allay any possible
irritation against the indisposed tenor, Melba volunteered to
sing an extra number at the close of the Wagnerian work. This
gave the manager an opportunity to fully explain Signor Vignas's
regrets and disappointment, and put the audience in thoroughly
good humour. At the close of the extra number Melba received an
ovation, the equal of which, in genuine spontaneity, has rarely
been accorded to a singer.</p>
<p>This particular performance of "Tannhäuser" was said to be the
"banner night" of the season, and, following as it did so much
florid work on her part, Melba's performance came as a complete
surprise. As evidence of the attention she devoted to the details
of this performance, it may be mentioned that she expended a sum
of £500 on the dress worn in the second act, where the text
demands an appearance of regal magnificence.</p>
<p>During this season Melba had a narrow escape from serious
accident while on a visit to Philadelphia, an escape which is
well described in her own words: "I was singing Gilda in
'Rigoletto,' at the point where she passes up the high stairway,
along a balcony, and enters a door, singing as she goes, and
finishing the scene with a long trill after having passed out of
sight of the audience. As I walked into the dark through the
door, which was high above the stage, I started forward, as I was
always accustomed to do. One step more, and I should have fallen
from the height to the stage below, for only a narrow platform
without a railing had been put there; but I stopped myself in
time, and fell backward against the scene. That trill was never
finished."</p>
<p>For her introduction to Boston, Melba's selection fell on the
opera of "Romeo and Juliet," in which Monsieur Jean de Reszke,
who had already made a great success there two years before as
young Montague, and Monsieur Pol Plançon as the friar, added
greatly to the interest of the revival. In the centre of American
culture the Australian singer's success was instantaneous and
unusual. "It was generally conceded that no such singing had ever
been heard in Boston." To quote the leading criticisms would be
to give a succession of extraordinary appreciations, in which the
<i>Herald</i> struck the keynote in saying: "Such scenes of
enthusiasm as those which were called out by her efforts have
seldom been witnessed in this city, and the sights and sounds
throughout the hall after her numbers gave the artist ample cause
for pride in her triumph over the conservative public of
Boston."</p>
<p>While staying in Boston there happened a little incident which
has been told many times. Staying in the same hotel was a lady
with a sick child, and one day, when Melba was running through
some exercises, the invalid stopped to listen, and called in
delight: "Hist, mother, birdie!" The lady told the prima donna of
the child's comment, and Melba returned the compliment by
visiting the sick-room, and singing several numbers to the little
sufferer, whose "bird" his tender imagination soon transformed
into an angel.</p>
<p>An unusual finale to the regular opera term was the trial of
the supplementary season in New York, on the return of the
company from their visits to the cities named. "Lohengrin" was
again billed at the Metropolitan Opera-House, with Melba and Jean
de Reszke in the cast, but owing to the extraordinary incident of
the three singers suited for the rôle of Ortrud&mdash;Mesdames
Fursch-Madi, Domenech, and Guercia&mdash;all being stricken with
colds, the opera had to be altered to "Semiramide," in which
Melba, Scalchi, and Édouard de Reszke enhanced the music by their
splendid interpretation. The final Sunday night concert, which
series Melba had vitalized into success, was turned into a
testimony of public favour for her. On April 26, for the last
time that season, she appeared in the opera of "Lucia," in which
she had made her début in America five months earlier under
conditions not altogether inspiring. What a change in that brief
period!</p>
<p>"When the finale of the opera was reached the house burst into
a tumult of cries of 'Melba!' who, as was evident when she
finally appeared, had been changing out of her stage dress. The
audience became so impatient that she was forced to come forward
in a wrapper that she had evidently seized hurriedly. She was
received with shouts of 'Bravo!' and 'Speech!' There was no
speech, but the standing, cheering audience kept up the demand
until, to silence them, she consented to sing once more. The
curtain was raised, a piano wheeled upon the stage, and she sang
'Home, Sweet Home.' There was wonderful feeling in it. The house
was completely hushed, and as she left the stage those in the
audience said to each other: 'Melba is crying.' And they were
right." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>New York Herald</i>.]</p>
<p>On the following evening, when the season concluded with a
polyglot programme, in which the whole splendid array of artists,
including Mesdames Nordica, Calvé, Scalchi, Eames, Arnoldson,
Bauermeister, and Messieurs Jean and Édouard de Reszke, Lassalle,
de Lucia, Vignas, and Carbone, took part, Melba had an experience
of public favour that thrilled her heart. The Mad Scene from
"Hamlet" was her selection, and when she appeared for it a "great
irrepressible cheer rang through the house, and it seemed several
minutes before she could begin singing." After accepting many
single recalls, Mr. Maurice Grau led her in front of the curtain,
then Mr. Henry Abbey drew her before the audience, and finally
both managers appeared with the new favourite. The applause for
the trio was remarkable. Even then the audience could not be
induced to leave, and the scene of the previous evening had to be
repeated, Melba again singing "Home, Sweet Home."</p>
<p>Even then the measure of her personal and artistic success was
not complete, for she was followed to the Savoy Hotel by the
Metropolitan Opera-House orchestra and large numbers of the
box-holders and other subscribers, and was the recipient of the
further compliment of a serenade. The orchestra found
accommodation in the main lobby of the hotel, and gathered round
them were representatives of many of the musical institutions and
leading private families. When Melba appeared on the balcony
overlooking the lobby, the gathering cheered to the echo. She
invited the whole company to sup with her in the dining-room of
the hotel, and the toasting of the prima donna was the closing
compliment of her first American season. Her success was complete
in every way; she was the prime favourite of the public, the
strongest financial card of the management, and never had any
prophecy been so thoroughly established as her own half-humorous,
quietly confident assertion, made as an indifferently received
stranger, that, no matter who was favourite at the beginning of
the season, she would be favourite at the end. Lahee, in his book
"Grand Opera in America," when dealing with this season, pays a
notable tribute to Melba, who during one visit "acquired
popularity almost equal to that of Patti in her best days."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>
<p class="quote" align="center">"Vous n'êtes qu'une
merveille."&mdash;C. COQUELIN.</p>
<p><span class="aa">It</span> would be idle to deny that Melba's
conquest of America during the early half of 1894 was not without
effect in the corresponding sphere of England, where her hold on
the public made steady advance. For the first time in the history
of music an artist of British birth and parentage was the
reigning operatic queen, and accepted unhesitatingly as such in
centres where she had to contend with the bogie of local
prejudice. The fact of her being British was in a certain measure
a barrier to her acceptance as a singer of first rank, even among
her own people, but in the largesse of her own cosmopolitanism
she never gave a thought to the provincialism of others.</p>
<p>During May she began her second season at La Scala, and
received a flattering welcome. Signor Omero Guaita, one of the
most severe of the musical connoisseurs of Milan, never missed a
single Melba performance during these two seasons, and
subsequently said: "She reminds me more than any other artist who
has sung at the Scala, of Malibran and Pasta, and I think these
are the only two singers with whom she should be compared. Like
them, she can bring the whole audience to their feet in a storm
of applause." Even the little boys in the street used to shout
"Eccola, la Melba!" when she passed, and to know her, or have
some kind of association with her, came to be accepted as a
social passport of interest. It is not unusual to-day, when
visitors are taken over La Scala, for them to be shown "the room
where the celebrated Melba used to dress."</p>
<p>"Faust" was the opera in which she made her bow at Covent
Garden in 1894, and the few who had been at Antwerp half a dozen
years before, when she essayed the character for the first time
in her life, and who saw and heard her go through the rôle of
Marguerite that season in London, were impressed by her marked
progress. Her greater intensity of expression and larger dramatic
feeling were as patent as the enhanced power of the lower
register of her voice. She had seen, thought, and felt for
herself. The <i>Saturday Review</i> marked her coming thus: "To
say that Madame Melba's is the most beautiful voice of the day,
and at the service of an unsurpassed technique, is to say little;
and what makes Madame Melba the queen of the lyric stage now is
her irreproachable style of singing, the <i>accento</i> in her
delivery, her fine dramatic instinct, and the talent for taking
infinite pains over the interpretation of a part. What fills even
experts with wonder is the prodigious spontaneity of her
vocalization, a preciously unique quality. Her Marguerite is
perfection." Connoisseurs of all shades of opinion were unanimous
as to the beauty of her voice.</p>
<p>During the season she repeated with conspicuous success her
interpretation of Elsa to the Lohengrin of Jean de Reszke, and
"Romeo and Juliet" with these two singers in the title-rôles
proved another irresistible attraction. They were also heard in a
revised version of Herman Bemberg's "Elaine," but even in the new
edition the weakness of the libretto seriously handicapped the
value of the music, although given by two such ideal exponents.
In the new production there was still less scope for the beauties
of Melba's voice than in the original score, but the prima donna
who had volunteered to sing such parts as Micaela, the Queen in
"The Huguenots," and other modest rôles, was not the one to let
such a circumstance prevent her giving enthusiastic co-operation
in a production which she conceived to be of general worth.
Bemberg, she has often since said, would have become a great
composer, one of the greatest, had his ambition not been clogged
by a large private fortune.</p>
<p>In the middle of the season Melba sang for the first time at
the Handel Festival in the Crystal Palace, the carrying power of
her voice being demonstrated in an exceptional way by the manner
in which it rang through the vast building during her delivery of
"Let the Bright Seraphim" and the air from "L'Allegro ed il
Pensieroso." Her Festival début was a success, but the Crystal
Palace was not built for singing in, and she quickly recognized
its disadvantages. When her share in the day's programme was
finished, she announced her determination never fco sing there
again, and there is no likelihood of her departing from that
resolve.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>
<p class="quote">"In ricordo della nostra buona conoscenza e
della nostra eccellente Semiramide&mdash;alla brava e cara
Melba."&mdash;<span class="aa">Sophie Scalchi</span>.</p>
<p>"<span class="aa">The</span> future can have no pleasanter
souvenirs for me than those I take away from America, and if I do
not return, believe me it will be no fault of mine," had been the
message of farewell spoken by Melba at the close of her first
visit to America. For the next season (1894-95) she made an early
entry, and was the chief attraction at a number of concerts given
by Mr. Henry Abbey before the opening of the opera session at the
Metropolitan, where on November 19 she and Jean de Reszke, with
Édouard de Reszke and Pol Plançon, were associated in a great
performance of "Romeo and Juliet" under the direction of
Mancinelli. Although in England the greatest artists of the
company rarely appear till the season is well advanced, to be the
prima donna of the initial and final performances of the season
is the privilege of the accepted star in America, and Melba was
at once conceded these rights of operatic sovereignty. In the
revival of "Lucia di Lammermoor," once again staged for her
benefit, she had the invaluable support of Tamagno as
Edgardo.</p>
<p>The American people were quick to notice and appreciate
Melba's avoidance of what are generally described as "prima donna
airs." Even in the concerts, where she was volunteered absolute
supremacy, she never sought for any treatment more favourable
than that accorded her least famous colleagues. She took her
place on the programme wherever the balance of its composition
demanded it; she insisted on her name being printed just the same
size as the others; when she made her entrance, either on the
platform or stage, there was no rustling at the side, no
significant wait, no pause in the orchestra, no trickery of a few
notes by fife or drum to draw special attention to her coming.
She allowed nothing to be done to direct towards herself any of
the attention that should be given to her work. Away from the
concert-room and opera-house there was the same avoidance of
bizarre affectations and eccentric mannerisms; in private life
she was as reasonable and unostentatious as in her professional
affairs. Here was a revelation.</p>
<p>In this woman with the patrician face, the indefinable
reserve, whose mode of life is necessarily cast on lines of
considerable luxury, the democratic American people made a new
discovery&mdash;a prima donna who discarded all affectations of
exoticism, and put herself forward as an ordinary rational
being.</p>
<p>The surprise and pleasure which Melba had already caused in
this way was greatly augmented when it was announced that she
would again undertake the rôle of Micaela in a revival of
"Carmen," with Zélie de Lussan and Jean and Édouard de Reszke in
the leading parts. Between her operatic engagements she made
concert appearances at Washington, Boston, Buffalo, Providence,
and New Haven, and at the latter place she was given the extra
compliment of a serenade by the students of Yale, who at the
close of the performance proceeded to her hotel, and sang beneath
her window until the night was far advanced. In Baltimore, where
she went for the opening of the New Music Hall, and where she
began her long and happy association with the Boston Symphony
Orchestra, she was received with no less fervour.</p>
<p>During this year's visit to Chicago, Melba had a narrow escape
from a sensational experience. When visiting that city, she
always occupied the same suite in the Auditorium Hotel, and these
rooms were known on the register by her name. On this occasion,
owing to some combination of circumstances, the Melba suite was
not available for the singer, as it had been found impossible to
arrange satisfactorily for the transference of the previously
installed occupant. An hour or two after the time at which it was
known the prima donna had arrived in the city, two well-dressed
men of gentlemanly appearance presented themselves at the "Melba
suite," and on their knock being answered by the lady in
occupation, one quickly pushed his way into the room, while the
other covered her with a revolver. Under these circumstances they
made a peremptory demand for the delivery of her jewels. The
astonished lady explained that she had none; they swore that she
had, and finding that she would not hand them over, they gagged
and bound her and made a complete search. Failing to find the
expected booty, they locked the doors and made a careful exit.
Some hours later, when a chambermaid entered, she found the lady
in a state of exhaustion. Although Melba on that particular visit
had taken few jewels with her, the papers had told many stories
about her amazing collection of diamonds, and it was for these
the daring thieves had planned the hold-up in the "Melba suite."
When the diva heard of the terrifying experience which the lady
had been subjected to through being mistaken for her, she paid
her a visit of sympathy.</p>
<p>On December 17, Herman Bemberg's opera "Elaine" was staged for
the first time in America, the cast including Melba, the two de
Reszkes, and Pol Plançon. Mancinelli was in the conductor's
chair, and the mounting of the work was admirable. Opinions were
divided as to the complete merit of the composition, which,
however, the house received warmly, and which the <i>Sun</i> and
other leading papers hailed as an instant "hit" fully worthy of a
place in the regular répertoire. Monsieur Bemberg's personal
success was considerable, and at concerts and private parties he
often played Melba's accompaniments to his own songs, the
combination making a decided attraction.</p>
<p>The splendour of the cast of "The Huguenots," which was given
on December 26, was really remarkable, and specially interesting
through Melba electing to fill the small part of the Queen. The
complete cast was as follows:</p>

</table>
<p>Such a combination of artists afforded a great musical treat,
and in giving all their measure of praise Reginald de Koven said:
"Place aux dames, Madame Melba, who was heard for the first time
as the Queen, was fairly dazzling in appearance, and acted with
much grace and spirit, while her vocalization was like some
fabric of richest lace&mdash;so delicate, so dainty, so
fairy-like and finished was it. Verily, this usually secondary
part was glorified and made much of last night." It is worth
pointing out that, although the night's expenses in connection
with this production cost over £2,000, the management made a
profit of over £800.</p>
<p>"Tannhäuser," with Melba as Elizabeth and Jean de Reszke in
the name-part; "Lakmé," in which she sang the title-rôle;
"Otello," with Tamagno as the Moor, Maurel as Iago, and Melba as
Desdemona; and "Lohengrin," with the Australian soprano and Jean
de Reszke in the chief characters, were among the other great
achievements of this season.</p>
<p>When "Semiramide" was given on January 25, 1895, there were
many who said that the presence of Melba was the only possible
excuse for its revival; but the claims of Scalchi, whose Arsace
was one of her finest impersonations, must be held to have also
influenced the management, for in the duets between these two
singers the opera-going public were provided with an unusual
delight. "In 'Semiramide' she effaced the memory of her great
predecessor (Patti) from the minds of her hearers by a much
broader and more artistic, and decidedly less personal and
conscious, rendering. Her performance was graceful and earnest,
and she displayed intensely musical sensitiveness and that
intelligence of phrasing which makes her the wonderful artist she
is." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>The Sun</i>.]</p>
<p>Philadelphia, which was also visited that season, has long
since become a Melba stronghold&mdash;a city, like Boston,
crowded with friends and admirers, where she may make a
succession of visits during any season, always sure of
overflowing houses. During this second season's visit to the
Quaker city, Melba, on approaching her carriage one bitter winter
night when the snow lay deep on the ground, was accosted by a
poor old woman of refined appearance, who had waited outside the
Academy of Music for some time. "Won't you shake hands with me?"
asked the woman, who was said to be a one-time successful singer;
"won't you give me a rose? I have waited all the evening just to
see your face." In an irresistible impulse Melba pressed all the
lovely flowers she was carrying into the arms of the poor
sentinel, and, bending forward, kissed her thin white face. In a
moment the stranger recovered herself, and, stepping close to the
carriage, whispered through her tears: "God bless your beautiful
heart"&mdash;words which formed the title of some pathetic little
verses embodying the incident, which have become well known in
America.</p>
<p>"It will amuse you to know I have never before sung a song in
German at any of my concerts," said Melba in reply to a warm
compliment on her singing of "Still wie die Nacht" at Baltimore.
"I have lately been studying German, and hope one of these days
to address you in that tongue. My linguistic répertoire now only
includes three 'Sprachen,' as the Germans say&mdash;English,
French, and Italian. But my limited knowledge of German does not
interfere with my study of Wagner, whom I love, and in whose
'Lohengrin' and 'Tannhäuser' I have already appeared in this
country."</p>
<p>From early October 1894, to early May 1895, Melba remained in
America, but even this exceptionally long season of seven months,
which was entirely confined to the Eastern States, was not long
enough to minimize her popularity. The New York opera season
closed on May 4 with a performance made up of selections from the
most successful productions, in which all the great singers took
part. On the stage there was the usual "last night" excitement,
and every artist except Melba had visitors behind the scenes.
Eager to be left unmolested in her own work, she has always been
careful to save the stage hands from the hindrance or
embarrassment which is caused to some extent by strangers passing
to and fro.</p>
<p>She had sung on the first night of the season, and for the
closing night she was set down to give the final number. The
chorus, with whom she always contrives to be a supreme favourite,
watched anxiously for her, and there were many others to gaze at
her as she threaded her way towards the stage. In passing, she
said aloud: "Ma foi! all the world has friends here save me."
Describing this scene, Rudolph E. Block said: "In a few moments
she was singing the Mad Scene from 'Lucia di Lammermoor.' Melba
was singing; so Tamagno, who had been humming the sonorous lines
of 'Aïda,' stopped short in his tragic strides, and, with folded
arms, listened. Jean de Reszke, all prepared to leave the stage,
raised his hand to entreat perfect silence among his companions,
and listened. Nordica, with downcast eyes, stood in the wings
pensive and listening. When it was all over, the audience
thundered with applause and deluged Melba with flowers. There she
stood bowing to left and right, glowing with triumph, radiant in
the glory of the moment, while the crowd yelled itself hoarse.
Yet Melba knows not what her triumph was that night. Proud and
happy and smiling, pale with gratified ambition, Melba knew not
at that moment how high she had risen. Far from that tumultuous
crowd a little chorus girl stood crouched in a distant corner of
the stage, crying as if her heart would break. That was Melba's
triumph."</p>
<p>For any artist, after the brief acquaintance of two seasons,
to have won such generous recognition as that given to Melba by
the American people was unprecedented, and the <i>New York
Globe</i>, in commenting on the matter in a leading article,
said: "The Melba rage which has possessed New York will always be
remembered as one of the most extraordinary manifestations of
enthusiasm for art. It is doubtful whether demonstrations of
equal intensity have ever before been witnessed in the
metropolis. This is, of course, saying a vast deal, when one
remembers the passionate applause accorded to popular favourites
like Patti, Paderewski, and Emma Eames."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>
<p class="quote">"À Nellie Melba. Comme une ange vous chantez
avec votre voix divine."&mdash;<span class="aa">Emme
Calvé</span>.</p>
<p>"<span class="aa">Faust</span>" was staged for Melba's opening
night at Covent Garden in 1895, the house that welcomed her being
one of the now customary brilliancy. So numerous had grown her
circle of enthusiastic supporters that the quantities of flowers
sent to the Opera for her acceptance became somewhat of an
interference with the ordinary routine of the house, and not long
afterwards it was decided to suspend entirely the custom of
passing floral tributes over the footlights. She had already made
it a regular practice, when acknowledging the applause of the
audience, to come before the curtain with the other members of
the company, instead of appearing alone, as had been the closely
reserved privilege of other prima donnas.</p>
<p>For an orchestral concert in the Queen's Hall at the height of
the season, Melba appeared with the distinguished conductor
Arthur Nikisch, whose direction secured beautiful completeness in
her own numbers&mdash;among them "Sweet Bird" and the Mad Scene
from "Hamlet," which aroused a truly remarkable ovation, in which
the Crown Prince and Princess of Roumania and the Grand Duke and
Duchess of Hesse joined with conspicuous enthusiasm. Many lovely
floral offerings were placed at the feet of the diva that day,
the most unique being a tall tripod from the centre of which
depended a pretty brazen cage containing a canary, which broke
into song just as it was being carried from the platform.</p>
<p>"Otello," with Melba as Desdemona, was next announced, but she
was unable to appear On June 22, before the Crown Prince and
Princess of Roumania and the Grand Duchess of Hesse, "Romeo and
Juliet" was repeated with the usual results. When "The Huguenots"
was performed on June 29, the splendid cast included Albani,
Giulia Ravogli, Tamagno, Plançon, Arimondi, Ancona, and Melba,
who undertook the part of Margherita de Valois.</p>
<p>In the scene where the Queen sits on the throne and engages in
conversation with the ladies of the Court, the topic brought up
on one occasion proved so engrossing that Melba forgot her cue,
and even the ever-ready Mademoiselle Bauermeister was unable to
supply it. In this predicament the Australian prima donna
substituted for the Meyerbeer passage some impromptu phrases of
her own, ending with a brilliant cadenza. Monsieur Plançon, as
St. Bris, was due to continue after the original phrases,
"Madame, I will go and bring my daughter," but, noticing Melba's
lapse, he sang instead, "Madame, I will go and tell Meyerbeer,"
whereat Mancinelli, who had, of course, noticed Melba's impromptu
addition to the music, had to bury his face in the score in order
to hide his amusement at Plançon's sally.</p>
<p>When Calvé assumed her famous rôle of "Carmen" in July, before
a delighted audience which included the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha
and the Crown Princess Stéphanie of Austria, Micaela was
undertaken by Melba "out of courtesy to the management," as was
set forth in all the public announcements. Monsieur Alvarez was
the Don José. Of Calvé's Carmen Melba has often said: "It will be
known in the history of music as an incomparable
performance."</p>
<p>During the summer of 1895 she prepared Massenet's "Manon
Lescaut," under the direction of the composer. While visiting a
friend, Melba went into the garden one afternoon, and as she
wandered among the flowers sang over the music of her rôle. Quite
unexpectedly Massenet called, and hearing the singer, who,
unconscious of his presence, still went on, he said to the
hostess, "I hear in it now something I had hitherto not dared to
hope for," and he left for Melba an interesting little note.</p>
<p>As a Christmas greeting (1895) to her secretary. Miss Louie
Bennett, Melba decided to send to England for that young lady's
fiancé, Mr. Kenyon Mason, and under her protection they were
married at the Archbishop's house, adjoining St. Patrick's
Cathedral, New York, by Archbishop Corrigan, on January 14, 1896.
The <i>déjeuner</i> which she subsequently gave at the Savoy
Hotel in honour of the occasion brought together an unusual
combination of artists, including Nordica, Calvé, Jean and
Édouard de Reszke, Plançon, Maurel, Cremonini, Bevignani, Ancona,
and Adamowski. Melba entered the banquet-hall on the arm of the
Archbishop, and a more stately pair it would be difficult to
imagine. It might be suspected that the selection of her gown for
that day had been made with an extra thought as to the colour
possibilities of the occasion, for her delicate mauve toilette
was in happiest harmony with the purple on Dr. Corrigan's
clerical attire. She interested herself in the whole matter as
though it were the supreme event of her own life, and in addition
to the more practical evidence of her friendship for the young
secretary, who was also a native of Melbourne, she personally
superintended all the details, and designed the souvenir
menu-cards, which were described as the prettiest ever seen in
New York. Melba delighted the Archbishop by offering to sing for
him at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and the crowd that gathered in
and around the beautiful building on the day she redeemed her
promise was one of the greatest ever known in that block of Fifth
Avenue. The personality of this notable ecclesiastic appealed
strongly to Melba, and from that time until his death he was her
friend and confidant.</p>
<p>On the evening of the wedding she sang at Brooklyn, and the
drive across provided an exciting little incident. In her
carriage was an old-fashioned iron foot-warmer, which, owing to
some defect, set fire to her fur cloak. Divesting herself of the
burning garment, she stepped out into the snow while matters were
remedied, and when she appeared before the public a little later
there was nothing in voice or manner to indicate the unusual
exertions of the day, nor the fact that her beautiful wrap had
been destroyed.</p>

<br>
<small>FACSIMILE MESSAGE FROM JULES MASSENET</small></p>
<br>
<p>This season was one of great interest for Melba, who was
accompanied by her sister Annie and her brother Ernest, both
accomplished amateurs of music. They were the recipients of many
social attentions, and were specially impressed by the remarkable
enthusiasm aroused by their distinguished sister when she sang in
Massenet's "Manon Lescaut" for the first time in New York, on
January 27, 1896, at the Metropolitan Opera-House. The
performance went admirably in every way, and the singer was as
gratified as the great audience which acclaimed her latest
success. Madame Sarah Bernhardt was in New York at the time, and
the day following Massenet's opera Melba went to see the French
tragedienne in "Adrienne Lecouvreur," and was quite unnerved by
the reality of the French artist's acting in the closing scenes.
Operas that followed in quick succession included "Carmen," with
Calvé, Jean de Reszke, and Melba in the leading parts; this trio
at the performance on February 3, eliciting so many recalls that
they laughingly confessed their inability "to drag their feet on
any more."</p>
<p>The news of Ambroise Thomas's death at Paris on February 12
reached New York the following day, and shed quite a gloom over
the French artists of the opera. Melba, who had enjoyed his close
friendship since her student days, was particularly depressed,
and felt that one of the strongest ties that bound her to Paris
had now been sadly severed.</p>
<p>"The Huguenots," with the great cast to which the New York
people had now become accustomed since Melba's first appearance
there as Margherita de Valois, was given several times to
overflowing houses, and "Lucia," "Faust," and "Romeo and Juliet"
were the other most popular productions. The night before leaving
for a season in Boston, where the same operas were staged with
unqualified success, "Faust" was produced at the Metropolitan,
with Jean de Reszke in the name-part. He and Melba were recalled
about twenty times at the close of the performance, and
eventually he sat down and played the accompaniment to her
singing of "Home, Sweet Home." Throughout the stay the prima
donna visited and received her friends, drove, walked, and
entered into all the enjoyments of society; and in New York she
followed the same course.</p>
<p>Arriving at the stage-door in Boston one day, she found that
the crowd of early comers who were waiting for the doors to be
opened had completely shut her off from the possibility of entry.
She asked permission to pass through, but was firmly refused. "I
merely want to reach the door," she explained. "That's just it,"
they said; "so do we, and we are not going to budge. We were here
first, and we are due the best place to hear." "Well, you must
let me pass, or you will not hear anything, for I am Madame
Melba," she told them; and then the whole queue became
demoralized in the endeavour to get near, and yet not impede her
way.</p>
<p>Among the celebrities in New York that spring was Monsieur
Paderewski, in whose honour Melba gave a Polish luncheon on April
20. She carried the entertainment through with delightful elan,
and her humour and vivacity infected the whole party. She did not
spare herself in any way, yet when she appeared at the opera the
same evening she sang with such freshness and purity of tone that
"all the world wondered."</p>
<p>Mr. Marion Crawford was another of her interesting guests
during that season, and it was at one of these luncheons she
first heard from the famous novelist that he had at one time
contemplated becoming a professional singer himself. When passing
through the hotel vestibule on this occasion, she stopped for a
moment to make inquiries regarding some trifle left in a cab or
carriage the previous day. To a negro, whose face seemed
familiar, she said: "Are you the man who drove me last night?"
"No, ma'am, I am not the <i>gentleman</i>," he answered
suavely&mdash;a response that greatly amused the little
party.</p>
<p>Another instance of "coloured" sang-froid! Returning to New
York one evening after a performance at Philadelphia, the negro
porter in charge of the sleeping-car remarked to Melba, in tones
of easy familiarity: "Say, Mrs. Melba, you don't remember me;
but, you bet, I know you. A while back you travelled with me on
train No. 27,832, and I told you that I thought Mr. Plankon
[Plançon] was fine, but that I did not think there was much to
your Margaret ["Faust"]. Yes, ma'am. But I take it all back now,
for I saw you the other night in 'Manon Lescaut,' and your
singing beat the band. Yes, ma'am, you take it from me."</p>
<p>The New York season terminated amid great enthusiasm on April
24, and Melba had by this time become so identified with American
musical enterprise that she was not surprised to find herself
described as "an American singer going to Europe for vacation."
She sailed next day for England, and after three days' stay in
London went on to her home in Paris, where Monsieur Jules
Massenet was one of the earliest callers to congratulate her on
the fresh successes which she had won for his opera abroad. The
doyen of French composers in friendly intercourse always
addresses her as "Madame Stradivarius."</p>
<p>Joachim often used the same form of address, explaining that
her voice had in a marked degree a unique quality of the
Stradivarius&mdash;that of sounding small in a small room and
large in a large room.</p>
<p>For any feminine resident of Paris, a return after an extended
absence always demands many visits to the dressmakers and
milliners, and in this respect Melba is true to the traditions of
her sex. Invariably avoiding bizarre effects, she has long been
noted for the refined elegance of her toilettes, which her
stately figure shows to complete advantage, and in which her
favourite colour, pale blue, is frequently introduced. Yet she
could not be truly described as possessing a particle of what is
known as woman's "passion for dress." Her position and vocation
require many clothes, and in their pretty lines, graceful
draperies, and effective combinations of colour she takes all the
delight of an artist, with, however, just a suspicion of feminine
vanity. It would be difficult to find anyone to whom personal
untidiness, or anything approaching that condition, is so
repugnant as to Melba, and no one has ever set a better example
in defence of a principle than she does in this particular. Often
in America, Europe, and England, when she has returned to her
hotel or home from an arduous engagement involving a long journey
and other exhausting circumstances conducive to physical
exhaustion, members of her household, knowing she was to retire
immediately afterwards, have endeavoured to dissuade her from the
fatigue of a change of dress, but nothing would induce her to sit
down to lunch or dinner in her travel-stained raiment.</p>
<p>Once when touring in America the members of her orchestra
attended the theatre at St. Louis in their ordinary attire, just
as they had come off the train. Melba, as usual, was an early
arrival on the scene, and, noticing the dress of the musicians,
informed them that their appearance was an insult to the St.
Louis public and to herself, and that it would be impossible for
her to accept their services under such conditions. The
proceedings were a little late in commencing that night, but when
the musicians took their places before the audience they were in
orthodox evening dress. Another instance of her nice attitude
towards her audiences may be cited. On this occasion she found
that the spare leaves of her concert programme had been filled
with a miscellany of distracting business advertisements. On
remonstrating with her manager, he explained that through this
expedient her share of the concert proceeds would be considerably
augmented and a handsome extra sum be placed to her credit.
"Nothing of this kind can be to my credit," she said. "Please
destroy these programmes, and have others printed without any
kind of advertisements."</p>
<p>Meanwhile rehearsals were begun for "Hamlet," in which Melba
was to sing at the Opera, and in which she reappeared on May 21,
1896, before an enormous audience, which received her with a
measure of applause that entirely eclipsed the demonstration made
in her favour exactly seven years before, when in the same opera
and on the same stage she had made her memorable début before the
Parisian public. Between May 21 and June 13 inclusive she
appeared in this rôle no fewer than seven times, and each
appearance was rewarded with undiminished manifestations of
popularity.</p>
<p>Thoroughly enjoying her home life in the French capital,
Melba, without placing an unreasonable tax on her physical and
vocal resources, was always accessible to her friends, and one
afternoon she would be found at Madame Mathilde Marchesi's, the
same evening a dinner guest of the Duchess of Manchester's, and
next day delighting with her song the Prince de Sagan and his
guests. The Countess Jean de Castellane's was one of the few
places where she occasionally dined and sang on the same evening
during this happy season.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>
<p class="quote">"So perfect is Melba's vocal utterance that by
the mere emission of tone, independent of all collateral aid, she
can express the whole gamut of human feeling."&mdash;<span class=
"aa">Sir Arthur Sullivan</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> echoes of Melba's successes in
America, and more recently at the Grand Opera, Paris, were still
ringing in her ears when, on June 19, 1896, she reappeared at
Covent Garden in the now universally acclaimed rôle of Juliet.
Although, on many evenings prior to this, stalls and boxes for
"Melba nights" had been disposed of by the libraries at greatly
augmented rates, this was the first time the Opera management had
officially raised the prices to the public for these specially
attractive programmes. The Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz
and the Duke and Duchess of Fife were of the audience that
evening, which the daily newspapers described as having all the
appearance of a gala occasion. "Lucia," in which her singing was
again described as the acme of vocal art, was the next opera
given.</p>
<p>On June 22 took place the death of the popular manager, Sir
Augustus Harris, whose friendship for Melba, and admiration for
her artistic gifts, had been among the most helpful circumstances
of her early career. Never had artist so fully appreciated the
sympathy of a kindly manager, and on hearing of his death Melba
asked to be relieved of her part in "Rigoletto" which had been
announced for June 23. On being assured of Sir Augustus's
strongly expressed desire that the performances should be
continued exactly as announced, except on the day of his funeral,
she was persuaded not to disturb the cast; but the whole opera,
although admirably sung, was unquestionably clouded by the sorrow
which the performers felt at the passing away of the genial
spirit who had been so closely identified with a brilliant decade
in the history of opera in England.</p>
<p>Great interest was taken in the revival on July 16 of
Massenet's "Manon Lescaut," which it was felt would assume new
life owing to Melba's appearance in the title-rôle; but even her
support was not sufficient to give it more than a temporary hold
on the affection of the English public, although her
interpretation revealed many unexpected charms. She made her
greatest success with the interpolated song written specially for
the English version, in which Marie Roze enacted the name-part.
Quite unusual applause followed this solo, and its repetition was
rapturously insisted on.</p>
<p>Melba, who delights in the selection of souvenirs for her
friends, takes a particular pleasure in lavishing beautiful gifts
on the members of her own family. During this season she
presented a diamond-studded gold bag to one of her sisters, then
on a visit from Australia, and the recipient, being unfortunate
enough to lose it, was greatly troubled, the more so since the
loss might seem to indicate inadequate appreciation of Melba's
generosity. All means were taken to recover the bag, but without
success, and the loser continued to worry. The prima donna went
to Tiffany's, ordered an exact replica, and pretending that it
was the original restored by an anonymous finder, she handed it
to her delighted sister, who only discovered the real facts
several years afterwards.</p>
<p>Preliminary to the American opera of 1896-97, Melba gave a
number of concerts, her first appearance in the United States
that season being with the Boston Symphony Orchestra on November
6, when the audience in the Music Hall of the Massachusetts
capital gave her a "reception that recalled the palmy days of
Patti and Jenny Lind."</p>
<p>When the concert was over, hundreds of people, mostly
<i>matinée</i> girls, waited for her exit from the hall, and
almost overwhelmed her with the ardour of their attentions.</p>
<p>On November 16 the Metropolitan opera season opened with
"Faust," to a great audience which lavishly applauded the work of
the Australian singer, Jean de Reszke, and Lassalle. The "eerie
beauty" of her voice evoked rapturous comment from all quarters,
and a few days later she won, if possible, wider compliment for
her acting and her "personification of melody" in "Romeo and
Juliet."</p>
<p>Melba's first American appearance in "Traviata" was at New
York on December 21, when she made a gratifying success as
Violetta. "As a combination of singing and acting it was more
satisfying than any seen here for many years. She invested the
scene with Alfredo's father with a depth of feeling, an abundance
of dramatic action, a forceful naturalness. In the last act, too,
she rose to positive dramatic excellence." * Of this performance
another critic said: "That she sang it brilliantly those who are
acquainted with her wondrous art and more wondrous voice need not
be told." **</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>New York Herald</i>.]</p>
<p class="foot">[** <i>New York Tribune</i>.]</p>
<p>The earnestness and variety of Melba's ambition was strikingly
manifested when it was announced that on December 30, 1896, at
the Metropolitan Opera-House, New York, she would sing in German
the rôle of Brünnhilde in Wagner's great work "Siegfried." Jean
de Reszke was cast for the title-rôle, Édouard as the Wanderer,
and the conductorship was in the hands of Anton Seidl.
Exceptional interest was aroused in this production, wherein the
accepted ideal exponent of such parts as Juliet, Marguerite,
Lucia, and Gilda was to try her powers in the heroic Wagnerian
rôle. In spite of all the difficulties incidental to the first
staging of so great a work, the performance went with singular
completeness, and the <i>New York Herald</i> wrote: "Madame
Melba's <i>Brünnhilde</i>, all things considered, was
surprisingly good. Considerable hostility had been awakened in
some quarters by her intention to sing the part, and she was
naturally nervous. With perfect ease she surmounted all the vocal
difficulties of the score, and towards the end, as she gained
more confidence, she sang with much greater freedom, and in the
final duet her voice had the ring of true passion."</p>
<p>The <i>New York Tribune</i>, the most conservative of great
American newspapers, in its criticism of this performance, after
an explanation as to the impossibility of extended comment owing
to the late hour at which the opera terminated, said: "It would
have strained the credulity of a stranger to believe that it was
a first performance, so finished was it in all respects, so full
of the spirit of the work, so enthusiastic, so instinct with
life, passion, and emotional
colour.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Madame Melba's share cannot be discussed in general terms." In a
more leisured comment a day or two later the same authority
wrote: "The sincerity of her effort was admirable. A large party
of the public went to hear her in a heroic rôle, and she has won
such encomiums as her laudable and plucky experiment
deserved.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. To
the loveliness of her devotion and the loftiness of her ambition
honest tribute must be paid. But the music of the part does not
lie well in her voice, and if she continues to sing it, it is
much to be feared there will soon be an end to the charm which
her voice discloses when employed in its legitimate sphere. The
world can ill afford to lose a Melba, even if it should gain a
Brünnhilde. But it will not gain a Brünnhilde."</p>
<p>The physical strain which the performance of Brünnhilde
entailed on Melba fully justified the note of warning which the
learned critic of the <i>Tribune</i> had so truly sounded. In
some quarters it is the custom, and not unkindly, to set down
this part as the one failure of her career, just as Carmen is
said to have been the one exception in the long rule of successes
that marked Patti's life of song. But as the latter's
impersonation of Bizet's heroine is sure to have possessed many
unusual charms and excellences, it must also be conceded that
Melba's Brünnhilde was distinguished by the unmatched perfection
of her vocalization, the dignity of her physical grace, the high
intelligence and nobility of endeavour which she brought to bear
on her impersonation, for which she gave nearly two years'
earnest study to the music, the drama, and the language.</p>
<p>Melba, who had had a severe attack of blood-poisoning, was in
poor health at the time of this production, and her undertaking
such a rôle under these conditions was another proof of the
courage in which she has never been found wanting, and which was
demonstrated in a spirited manner next day, when she announced
her unsuitability for the part, and her determination never to
sing it again.</p>
<p>Almost every member of the company was at one time or other
out of the bill during this season, owing to colds brought on by
the severity of the winter. Melba, in spite of indifferent
health, continued at her post throughout January, repeating her
usual successes in "Traviata," "Romeo and Juliet," "Faust,"
"Rigoletto," and other rôles, and adding greatly to her personal
popularity, which has never been equalled by that of any other
visiting singer. Then she left for the Riviera to rest and
recruit after a long term of unbroken professional activity.</p>
<p>After she had had a brief respite, Maurice Grau cabled to
Europe urging her to return to America as the only means of
saving the latter weeks of the season from disaster, but she was
unable to respond to the flattering call of her manager.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX</h3>
<p class="quote">"As an exemplar of unaffected purity in vocal
art, Melba surpasses all other great singers of our
time."&mdash;<span class="aa">Joachim</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Before</span> appearing at Covent Garden in
1897, Melba gave a concert in the Queen's Hall, of which the
<i>Daily Telegraph</i> remarked: "She again exemplified the
qualities which have raised her so high, and given Australia a
name in art of which that young country has a right to be
proud."</p>
<p>Although Melba was not the first Australian singer to seek
European laurels, she is the only one who has won world-wide
fame. The pioneer was Madame Lucy Chambers, daughter of a New
South Wales magistrate, who about the time of Melba's birth was
successfully singing in opera throughout Italy under the name of
Lucia Chamberini. In after-years, when Madame Chambers retired
from the stage and settled in Melbourne as a teacher of singing,
she used to say that her memory should be perpetuated in
Australian musical history as the only Australian teacher who did
not claim to have taught Melba.</p>
<p>The late Luscombe Searelle, author, artist, opera and
theatre-manager, was in Melbourne during the days when Melba, as
a young amateur, was endeavouring to get a professional
engagement. He had advertised for singers to take a few
subordinate parts, and she was among the anxious applicants. He
tried her voice, said it was pretty good, though not good enough
for him, and that she wanted more training. Some years
afterwards, when she had become famous, he was visiting London,
which was then ringing with echoes of her success. She was
passing to her carriage through the hall of the Savoy Hotel one
day, when she saw Mr. Searelle. She beckoned him to her, but
there was no look of recognition on his face as he responded.
Then she said: "I see you have forgotten me, Mr. Searelle. My
name is Melba. I am the girl you would not engage in Melbourne
because my voice was only passable and wanted training.
Good-morning." And as she turned away, without giving him any
chance for response, the disconcerted manager could only join in
her mischievous laughter.</p>
<p>Her first appearance at the opera in 1897 was on June 23, at
the gala performance given by command of Queen Victoria in honour
of Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee; at this performance Melba,
supported by Jean de Reszke, Édouard de Reszke, Pol Plançon, and
Mademoiselle Bauermeister, performed in the third act of "Romeo
and Juliet." The gorgeousness of the spectacle at this
performance was greatly intensified by the magnificent uniforms
and native dresses of the visiting princes and potentates, who
had come from all parts of the world to join in the historic
celebration.</p>
<p>The experiment of augmenting the prices, which the favour of
"Romeo and Juliet" had rendered successfully possible in 1896,
was continued this season, and with gratifying results, even when
Jean de Reszke was not in the cast with the Australian singer.
The increase of admission rates to the stalls on "Melba nights"
thenceforward became a usual detail in the Covent Garden
management, whether her support was supplied by Alvarez, Saleza,
Caruso, or Bonci.</p>
<p>The announcement that Melba would only sing at Covent Garden
on a few occasions that season was sufficient to attract a vast
audience to "Faust" on June 28, when her Marguerite elicited
innumerable recalls from a most demonstrative house. The velvety
tones of her lower notes never sounded so beautiful as in the
earlier scenes that night, while the brilliancy of her upper
register reached a stage of dazzling perfection in the last
act.</p>
<p>During this summer season she spent all her spare time on the
river, and from Fernley visited all places of interest in the
neighbourhood. One of these excursions was to Stoke Poges
Churchyard, where Gray wrote his famous elegy, and where his
remains are buried. The beauty of the scene, the traditions, and
the surroundings appealed to Melba's imagination, and, borrowing
the key from an old woman in charge, she entered the church.
After a little parley it was found that the caretaker was willing
to blow the organ bellows, so Melba seated herself at the organ,
and began playing. Then she sang Gounod's "we Maria," and
followed it with other selections, of which the finale was the
National Anthem. The old woman, who had no idea of the singer's
identity, was delighted, and, in expressing her pleasure and
thanks, said: "'Twas all very wonderful, but I liked 'God save
the Queen' best." When the Vicar made an appearance, and,
attracted by the unusual singing, asked who the vocalist was, one
of the party gave the desired information, on which the clergyman
further asked: "And who is Madame Melba?"</p>
<p>When it was decided to celebrate the centenary of Donizetti at
Bergamo, the authorities sought the services of Melba, so that
all possible éclat should be given to the occasion. Her
assumption of the part of Lucia had given Donizetti's opera a new
lease of popularity, and endowed it with a "drawing" power it had
never known at other hands. In one respect Melba stands supremely
apart from all great singers of to-day, from all great singers of
the last half-century, and that is by reason of her unparalleled
control of breath. When she is singing the most difficult of
sustained passages, her chest is as motionless as a block of
marble. This quality, together with the great flexibility of her
voice, equips her in a unique way for the perfect rendering of
the runs, trills, shakes, and other graces with which "Lucia"
abounds, and which she executes with a precision of attack, an
evenness of tone, and an elegance of phrasing, unapproached by
any living singer. To Melba's unequalled qualifications the
Italian people paid generous testimony, by passing over the many
superbly gifted native singers in favour of a foreign artist,
whose singing would give to the dead master's music a perfection
that could not be counted lor from any other exponent.</p>
<p>Anton Seidl, the distinguished composer and conductor under
whose baton Melba had achieved many successes, and who to some
extent resented the occasional charge of reserve in her acting,
which he described as a "certain noble indifference," wrote about
this time a description of her voice and its use which it would
be difficult to excel:</p>
<p>"Now I come to Madame Melba, in whom we find the prodigal
richness of one of the most beautiful voices that ever rang from
human throat. Melba's voice has a magical, fairy-like tone, and
yet, with all the charm of sound, there is present such a
roundness of technique that one is simply amazed. Generally,
heretofore, <i>coloratura</i> singers have not grown in very
luxurious profusion with sustained cantilena or melody. Patti
alone hitherto had both in the highest completeness; but in
Madame Melba song and technique are present, not only in the
greatest completeness, but brilliant, fairy-like, and as if
shining with supernatural glory. The trill in her case is of
quite fabulous sustention; for instance, she has at her command a
long and powerful crescendo on the highest notes that is without
a parallel, and yet performed with a clearness and certainty
which simply excite astonishment, and at the same time soft,
clinging, and cajoling. Her science of taking breaths is
complete, and infallibly calculated for the length of a musical
phrase, never left to chance or error, but ever firm, even, and
without deception. In 'Lucia' the Madwoman's Scene could not
possibly have been better heard by the composer himself. It is
impossible to think of a higher education in technical power and
performance for a human throat."</p>
<p>Among those at Bergamo for this celebration were Joachim and
one of his nieces, Herr Robert von Mendelssohn, Piatti, and Frau
von Keudel, with whom Melba went on many excursions. The little
party on one outing invaded a peasant's cottage, and were regaled
with macaroni, which was so deliciously cooked that Melba
persuaded her friends to return with her another day, and wait
while the peasant taught her the exact method followed in the
preparation of the Italian dish.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI</h3>
<p class="quote">"Mon admiration pour l'artiste était si profonde
que j'avais comme peine de vous connaître. Laissez-moi vous dire,
chère Madame, que la femme vaut l'artiste, et que la nature a
bien su faire les choses."&mdash;<span class="aa">E. Fernandez
Arbos</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> American season of 1897-8, under
the management of Messrs. Charles Ellis and Walter Damrosch, was
full of incident, embracing as it did the limits of the United
States from the Atlantic to the Pacific, which latter coast she
had not visited on any of her earlier trips. To add to her
comfort on this expedition, a luxurious private car, which
afforded ample accommodation for a party of six and all necessary
attendants, and which could be attached to ordinary or special
train as circumstances demanded, was secured for her use. The
Pullman Company christened it "Melba," and had her name
emblazoned on the panel. The maintenance of this little house on
wheels, in which she was to live throughout her tour,
necessitated the employment of a conductor, porter, chef, and
waiter, in addition to her personal servants. The chef and waiter
were so supreme in their vocations that she dubbed them "Jean"
and "Édouard" out of compliment to her peerless colleagues, the
de Reszkes. The rent of the "Melba" car was £10 ($50) a day, and
the additional cost of moving it in the Eastern States was the
price of eighteen first-class tickets, and in the Western States
the price of fifteen first-class tickets, over the distance
traversed.</p>
<p>For the mapped-out course these particular charges amounted to
£725 ($3,500), and the incidental expenses included payments at
the following rates: Chef, £40 ($200) a month; waiter, £15 ($75);
conductor, £15 ($75); and coloured porter, £10 ($50). The other
principal expenses were the food-supplies and tips.</p>
<p>Before taking up her abode in this movable apartment, Melba
completed her season in New York, where at the Metropolitan
Opera-House, on January 28, 1898, she made her American début in
"The Barber of Seville "; her sparkling treatment of the text and
naturally beautiful rendering of the music delighting everybody.
"Traviata" was received in the same spirit, and the charm of her
dramatic reading was universally commended. To repeat the eulogy
lavished on her in connection with these productions, and her
older successes in New York, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Washington,
St. Louis, Philadelphia, Salt Lake City, Minneapolis, and the
other cities visited, would be to draw on the entire store of the
language's superlatives. At Chicago the "Barber" was described as
the most sensational triumph for many years, and her comedy
scenes were compared to the work of Réjane and Judic. During a
flying visit to Philadelphia on January 13, she introduced
herself to the American people in the more important rôle of
Aïda, and received universal approbation, in the course of which
the <i>Philadelphia Bulletin</i> said: "Not only did this
marvellous artist achieve another success, but she seemed to open
another chapter in the history of her career. Two or three years
since she was universally accepted as the greatest living
soprano, but it was purely as a vocalist that she obtained the
name. This year and in this city she has changed all this. She is
now a very sentient being in every character she portrays; her
action is full of significance, her passion moving, her
tenderness touching, and her strength undeniable. In the third
act nothing more seductively convincing could be imagined, and
the actress for once made her matchless natural gift subservient
to her acquired skill."</p>
<p>In the course of this season's tournée, Melba took every
opportunity that offered of hearing great artists and seeing the
wonderful natural beauties of the country. At Minneapolis she had
a chance to see Modjeska as Marie Stuart, and was deeply
impressed and saddened by the performance. Betweenwhiles she was
full of life and gaiety, always ready with a joke to enliven the
tedium of the journeys, and never niggardly of her laughter when
the joke was turned against herself. A boy selling fruit and
candy one day entered her car from the other section of the
train, and after making some purchases she asked: "Would you like
to go to the opera to-night?" "Why, sure," said he. "Would you
like to hear Melba?" she went on; and the lad answered: "Well, I
should smile." "Then," said she, pointing to the manager, "go
over to that gentleman, and tell him I said he would give you
tickets for yourself and your mother or some friend." The boy, in
amused surprise, asked: "Well, who are you, anyway?" "I'm Madame
Melba," she responded; and the unabashed young candy-vendor
quickly broke in: "Go on! I've seen Madame Melba, and she's real
pretty." Loving honesty herself, she did not resent it in the
young critic, and the tickets were given to him.</p>
<p>Continuing the tour westwards, Melba was most cordially
received in San Francisco, and many social functions were
organized in her honour. At one of these private parties given by
Mrs. de Young, Melba had a narrow escape from death, as a heavy
bronze bust, which was knocked from its stand, struck her on the
side of the head, and she fell to the floor unconscious. On
regaining her senses she quickly recovered her composure, but the
hosts and guests were greatly alarmed, and the incident provided
the excitement of the hour at the Golden Gate.</p>
<p>At the time of this her first visit to San Francisco the
trouble between America and Spain was at its height, and feeling
ran very strong in the Western city, the centre of early Spanish
settlement, and a city where the presence of so many descendants
of the Castilian pioneers was in itself sufficient to intensify
the resentment of the great majority. Melba's appearance in "The
Barber of Seville" on April 21 had been widely advertised and
completely prepared, and the declaration of war between the two
countries was made too late to allow of an easy change. The
production of Spanish opera on such an eventful day, and before a
public not always given to the complete restraint of old and
conservative communities, was felt to be a very risky
undertaking, but under the circumstances there was no alternative
but to go on with the announced bill. Melba faced the situation
with a certain amount of tremor, and went from scene to scene
fearing each succeeding moment might release the hostility which
the audience were keeping in check by the most slender of
conditions.</p>
<p>Throughout the earlier stages of the tour she had followed the
usual tradition of introducing interpolated numbers in the Lesson
Scene, her choice running through "Still wie die Nacht,"
"Sevilliana," "Mattinata," "Home, Sweet Home," the Mad Scene from
"Lucia," and "The Old Folks at Home." On the night in question
Melba took her seat at the piano, and electrified the assemblage
by starting the country's national anthem, "The Star-Spangled
Banner." Rarely, surely, was there such a scene of enthusiasm in
any theatre! Many circumstances have tended to give Key's
stirring song special significance in the Californian capital, as
here his statue inscribed with his verses is one of the sights of
the city. Great Britain had been careful to evidence her sympathy
with America throughout the dissension with Spain, and when the
singer, in a moment of impulse, made herself the mouthpiece of
her country's feelings, it can easily be imagined what impression
was created by her diplomatic action. The declaration of war was
fresh in the ears of her audience when her voice rang out to them
in the rallying cry of their nation.</p>
<p>Before the end of the first verse the whole house was
standing; the close of the second verse found the people in such
a state of fervour that Melba herself was completely carried away
by its intensity, and having started on the third verse, she
found herself unable to continue. Tears were on the cheeks of
hundreds in the theatre, tears were also on the cheeks of Melba
as she stood there, incongruously enough, in her gay Spanish
dress; and as she turned away, for once in her life unable to
control the voice which is little short of magical in its
response to her behest, the people roared again their tribute of
admiration for the woman and the artist.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>
<p class="quote">"To Madame Nellie Melba, the great artist, the
favourite of the gods, my highest and sincerest
admiration."&mdash;<span class="aa">Milka Ternina</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">For</span> the London season of 1898 Melba
could only arrange to accept three engagements, opening in
"Traviata," which she then sang in London for the first time.
Among the audience on that occasion was Madame Adelina Patti, who
from Mr. Alfred de Rothschild's box watched and applauded the
Australian singer's interpretation of a rôle which had been her
own favourite part in earlier days. Melba next essayed Rosina in
"The Barber of Seville," which some connoisseurs pronounced her
best part, and of which the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> wrote: "Her
Rosina last evening was as magnetic as the Ring itself. Covent
Garden could not hold all who came to listen to her." Among them
was the Princess of Wales. A leading writer, in a summary on her
opening performance, expressed the opinion that she might easily
make herself one of the first actresses on the operatic stage
through her splendid presence, magnificent assurance, obvious
intelligence, and other gifts which were possessed by few of her
rivals; and ascribed any possible limitations which might be
evident to her indisposition to take the necessary pains. Never
was r. guess so wide of the mark, for Melba's care and industry
are among her strongest points.</p>
<p>As befits a lady who personally superintends the affairs of
her own household, she is an early riser&mdash;especially so for
a singer&mdash;and no matter how late she may have retired, she
always breakfasts soon after eight o'clock, and two hours later
has finished her private correspondence and conferred with her
secretary as to the mass of general letters which she daily
receives.</p>
<p>There is nothing of the "slippers and tea-gown" prima donna
about Melba. She is always alert and ready, with the disposition
to devote infinite pains and perseverance to any undertaking with
which she may be identified. These qualities are in some measure
responsible for the reputation as a clever business woman which
she enjoys, and which drew from a London literary man the remark:
"It would have been all the same whatever she turned her mind to;
if she had opened a bonnet shop, she would have become the first
milliner in Europe." In view of the public estimation of her
talents as a woman of affairs, it is amusing to know that in a
game of dominoes her powers of calculation are so limited that
she has to count on her fingers.</p>

<br>
<small>MELBA AS "ROSINA" IN "THE BARBER OF SEVILLE"</small></p>
<br>
<p>Although Melba has not largely identified herself with the
great classics of a bygone age&mdash;the operas of Glück, Mozart,
and Beethoven, from which, however, she regularly sings excerpts
at her concerts&mdash;she must be credited with a larger measure
of artistic enterprise than that manifested by her great
predecessors. Jenny Lind's répertoire was so limited as to supply
that rare singer with a strong argument in favour of her
premature retirement from the operatic stage; and it has not been
shown that in her subsequent concert work, even while resident in
Germany, she took any part in the establishment of Wagner's
prestige. Tietjens, it is true, was denied the opportunity of
appearing in any Wagnerian rôle, save that of her incomparable
Ortrud. Nilsson's only portrayal in Wagner's operas was Elsa,
whereas Patti never once identified herself with any of his
music. On the other hand, Melba, after a complete study of his
works, appeared, as already shown, in "Lohengrin," "Tannhäuser,"
and "Siegfried," although Elsa is the only Wagnerian character
with which she has intimately identified herself. Her association
with the unconventional opera of the present day is best
illustrated by her Mimi in "La Bohème."</p>
<p>During the same year she is found captivating audiences in
London and New York in a series of operas running from
"Lohengrin" to "Lucia di Lammermoor," from "Aïda" to "Elaine,"
from "Carmen" to "Pagliacci," from "Tannhäuser" to "The Barber of
Seville." On a private occasion, when portions of "Siegfried"
were given for the entertainment of Her Majesty the Queen, Melba
also sang the music of "The Forest Bird"&mdash;with what results
can be imagined by a public accustomed to hearing those lovely
phrases indifferently rendered.</p>
<p>Despite the brevity of her London sojourn in 1898, Melba
followed her usual custom of singing at least once for some
charitable object, and gave her services at a Stafford House
concert, organized by the Duchess of Sutherland, for a church
fund connected with a poor district of the Staffordshire
Potteries. She chose for her principal number the famous air from
"Il Re Pastore," to which the violin obbligato was played by
Joachim, who even in the last days of his noble life repeated
anew his profound admiration for her exquisite art.</p>
<p>Her personal devotion to this distinguished master formed one
of the great friendships of her career. A fine bust of him
occupies the place of honour in the main corridor of her home,
and his picture always stands among the elect in her salon or
library.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>
<p class="quote">"A Churchman, dear Madame Melba, is often a poor
judge of lay matters; but that you should have attained
pre-eminence, despite your persistent disregard for those nuances
of diplomacy which I have always understood to be essential to
the structure of operatic fame, is perhaps the most singular
feature of your professional life."&mdash;<span class=
"aa">Archbishop Corrigan</span> (New York).</p>
<p><span class="aa">After</span> Melba's conquest of the Western
States, it was universally admitted that she had secured a unique
position with the American people, and she at once agreed to
another tour for 1898-99. By this time innumerable soaps and
sauces, ribbons and ruffles, had been named after her. The
prettiness of her professional name, combined with her fame and
popularity, has since induced many a fond mother to borrow it for
her child, and Melba regularly receives photographs of little
girls who have been christened after her. The passenger list of
an Australian mail-steamer not long ago revealed a still broader
compliment, for two of the travellers from Adelaide bore as their
family designation the pseudonym of the prima donna. Except in
legal documents, Melba is now never described by her own first
name, Helen, which stately appellation is her favourite.</p>
<p>One day this season, when passing a very showy drug-store,
which had its entire front space covered with glaring
advertisements of "Melba" perfume, she went in to test its
quality. This she found of such a character that she felt called
upon to remonstrate with the proprietor: "How dare you attach my
name to such vile stuff! And how dare you use my name at all
without consulting me!" The druggist took her expostulations
quite coolly, and answered: "It's no use you making a fuss. I
have as much right to it as you have, for your real name is Mrs.
Armstrong." Knowing the right of his contention, she retired
gracefully, but immediately patented the name "Melba" in America,
so that she may control its use in all such matters.</p>
<p>From an artistic standpoint, this her fifth visit to America,
once again under the business direction of Mr. Charles Ellis, was
mainly notable for her first appearance in "La Bohème," which
took place at the Academy of Music, Philadelphia, on December 29,
1898. In the earlier part of the year she had found time to visit
Lucca, the birthplace of the composer Puccini, and to study with
him there the opera which had so attracted her, despite the
apathetic attitude adopted towards this work by almost every
foreign connoisseur who had been approached regarding it.
Speaking of this visit, Melba has said: "Puccini came for two
hours daily during the ten days of my study, and I was well
pleased with the work I did. He thoroughly explained his ideas of
the music; we rehearsed it bit by bit; and my score is full of
his pencil markings and annotations. Some of my friends like it
better than anything else I sing. I have great faith in Puccini's
gifts. I delight in singing his music, and I believe him to be
the coming Italian composer." Subsequently, in England, she
advised Puccini to see Belasco's pathetic Japanese play, and
discussed with him its musical possibilities, which he eventually
utilized in his opera "Madame Butterfly," in which it was at
first anticipated she would create the title-rôle.</p>
<p>What was said to be an unauthorized version of "La Bohème" had
already been given in America by the Bagetto and Royal Italian
Opera companies, but it had failed to make any impression on the
public. The influence of Melba speedily changed all that, and her
power gave it a ready cachet, which could not have been secured
by any other means. The crowds, who came at first out of
curiosity to hear the singer in a new rôle, came again and again
to hear her in one which her voice and art raised to unforeseen
eminence. Despite her fine physique, dignified stage presence,
and full round voice, she gave a wholly admirable representation
of the pathetic grisette, true to nature in every essential, from
the careless gaiety of her first meeting with Rodolfo to her
tender death scene in his garret studio.</p>
<p>Although the part is never unduly dominant, and Melba never
for a moment neglects to efface herself in the artistic demands
of its correct portrayal, yet the audience on that first night
felt and understood what the production owed to her. After the
third act there were no fewer than sixteen recalls. Time after
time Melba came out, leading the whole company with her, but the
people refused to be satisfied until she appeared alone to
receive the tribute of regard they were so eager to pay her. Next
day the verdict of the public was given&mdash;"Hail, Melba! Hail,
Puccini!" A little later, when the opera was performed in Boston,
Mr. Philip Hale said: "Melba sang with infinite beauty of tone,
with a musical and dramatic intelligence that made their way
straight to the heart. The actress was not jealous of the singer.
The singer was not forgetful of the librettist. A most excellent
piece of work; one that will live long in the memory."</p>
<p>In addition to the metropolis, where she joined forces with
Maurice Grau, the cities visited by her company included
Philadelphia, as already mentioned, Chicago, Boston, Buffalo,
Rochester, Kansas, Denver, Baltimore, Los Angeles, and San
Francisco, where the season closed. In all these centres, except
Los Angeles, Melba stipulated for a performance of "La Bohème,"
thus giving Puccini's work the impress of an invaluable and
extended introduction.</p>
<p>Some of the members of the company were Gadski, Zélie de
Lussan, Bonnard, Pandolfini, Ellison Van Hoose, and Bensaude, and
there was great good-fellowship between the whole party. Madame
Gadski's little girl, who was a persistent opera-goer, caused
much amusement by insisting that she much preferred the singing
of Melba to that of her adoring mother. The prima donna, who is
very interested in children, was always getting into conversation
with those she encountered on her travels. One day, while
standing outside her private car at Chicago, a tiny newsboy
passed along the platform, and, noticing that his scanty clothes
were quite unsuitable for the bitter weather, she asked: "How
long have you got to stand here?" "Until I sell these fifty
papers." "Well, I'll buy the fifty," said Melba; and the
shivering child, afraid to realize his good fortune, asked in
surprise: "But have you got enough money?"</p>
<p>One of those days in New York a struggling literary friend
disposed of a short story to an agent, who paid a very fair rate
of remuneration&mdash;'£20 ($100)&mdash;but who wished to attach
his own name to it, instead of the writer's <i>nom de plume</i>.
He probably intended resetting the story or making some kind of
alterations, and, as the author was only using a pen-name, the
agent may have felt that the writer would not be suffering any
injury through its publication above the agent's better-known
appellation. The writer readily consented, and some time
afterwards mentioned the matter to Melba, who was indignant. "How
much did he pay you for your story?" she asked; and when told,
she said: "Then, go at once and get it. I will pay him back his
£20; if necessary, I will pay him £40; but I won't allow you to
be denied the credit due to you;" and before the friend left the
house a pledge had been given to Melba either to get back the
manuscript or insist on its publication under the name of its
creator.</p>
<p>Like most observant people who have travelled widely, read
much, and been thrown into close association with great
personalities, Melba is an excellent conversationalist, and
rarely allows her own affairs to be intruded. Few women can tell
a story with better effect, and few can more fully appreciate the
stories of others. A voracious reader, her preference is given to
biography and history, although she finds restful recreation in
the American short story and more pretentious popular fiction, of
which her favourite example is Jack London's "Call of the Wild."
Among the great novels, those that interest her most are the
stories of Balzac, of which she has a complete knowledge, and to
which she returns again and again. In poetry, the appeal of
Shakespeare to a woman like Melba would naturally be paramount,
and her next choice falls, strangely, upon Omar Khayyám.</p>
<p>Having a pronounced objection to slang, and speaking English
with exquisite purity, she at odd and unexpected moments
surprises her friends by one or two outlandish expressions,
uttered in a spirit of mischief; after which, with lightly
concealed amusement, she watches the faces of her hearers, in
much the same fashion as a vivacious schoolgirl who by some
unusual word or phrase has sought to alarm the righteousness of
her adoring elders.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>
<p class="quote">"Melba! She has, perhaps, the most pure and
crystal voice of the present century. It is an intense physical
pleasure to hear such a voice at all, an intense mental pleasure
to hear it used as it was the other night."&mdash;<span class=
"aa">Robert S. Hichens</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Exactly</span> eleven years had passed
between Melba's first introduction to Covent Garden and her
appearance there in "Romeo and Juliet" on May 25, 1899, her
<i>rentrée</i> for that season. What changes had taken place in
that interval! The mere announcement of her name was now
sufficient to draw a crowded and brilliant house, which numbered
the Duke of York, the Duchess of Fife, Princess Charles of
Denmark, and other members of the Royal Family. Her brilliant
colleague of earlier seasons, Jean de Reszke, was not there to
impersonate young Montague. The opera was one in which the
wonderful couples Patti and Mario, and Patti and Nicolini, had
failed to arouse wide public interest, and there was no special
circumstance of staging, dressing, or casting on this occasion to
appeal to the public in any particular, apart from Melba herself,
to whom the glory of her achievement was ungrudgingly given by
the whole London press. Surely, never in the history of opera had
such universal praise been bestowed on any artist as that which
was accorded Melba in the criticisms of this performance. The
<i>Daily Telegraph</i> may be quoted as a sample: "For her
countless admirers the season always seems to lack its crown and
completeness until this superbly gifted artist has
appeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. It
was as Juliet that Madame Melba first woke the senses of
opera-goers to a full appreciation of her splendid powers.
Gounod's exquisite music had never really caught the public ear
until the Australian cantatrice graced it with her matchless
voice. Not even Adelina Patti could win enduring favour for the
work in the days when Juliet was among the characters that
belonged to her at Covent
Garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. If
one thing more than another was remarkable in her performance, it
was the ease of Madame Melba's acting." The <i>Times</i>, no less
generous, dwelt on the unmatched loveliness of her vocal tone,
and, in commenting on the great expansion of her dramatic powers,
declared her rendering to be near perfection.</p>
<p>A German critic, dwelling on the dramatic intensity of her
acting, felt called on to warn her against the repetition of
similar abandonment, as sure to interfere with the perfection of
her vocal utterance. The fact cannot be lost sight of, that when,
instead of the equally effective illusion, the possessor of a
beautiful voice surrenders herself to the actual emotion which a
scene of poignancy demands, she must also surrender much of the
voice's beauty; for emotional intensity so seriously contracts a
singer's throat as to make the emission of perfect tone an
impossibility. Whatever difference of opinion the critics elected
to hold on other occasions with regard to her dramatic powers,
they were on this date unanimous as to the inspiration of musical
feeling "in this amazing singer, who affords a greater sense of
completeness than any other artist." *</p>
<p class="foot">[* <i>Morning Advertiser</i>.]</p>
<p>Even the most doleful of pessimists would have been elated by
such a chorus of approbation, and Melba's responsive heart was
deeply touched by the regard and appreciation of the whole London
public. No trace of empty vanity even then entered what she
herself has described as her "level Scottish head." The
independence and straightforwardness which were discussed by
those who knew her were no matter of recent growth. They were the
same equalities which had asserted themselves even before she had
made many steps towards fame, as on those easily remembered
occasions when she declined to make a second appointment with
Carl Rosa, and when she refused to allow her advance to depend on
the selection of a certain dramatic teacher in Paris.</p>
<p>Melba's enthusiasm for "La Bohème" led to its production at
Covent Garden, the first performance in Italian taking place on
July 1, about two years after the Carl Rosa Opera Company had
introduced the work elsewhere with an English libretto&mdash;but
with no very great success. It is no secret that the management
were not sanguine over the production, and that Melba, in order
to secure them against possible loss, promised to supplement all
her appearances in it with some favourite scena until the new
Italian opera became thoroughly established in public
favour&mdash;a promise which she gladly redeemed by singing one
of her popular arias after the performance, until her judgment
was abundantly justified. Mr. Joseph Bennett was among the London
critics who were charmed with Melba's rôle, and held that "never
before had she seemed so completely in touch with the character
assumed, while the scene of Mimi's death was as touching as art
could make it. The performance was received with a crescendo of
approval which ended in a triumphant climax."</p>
<p>It had now become an established custom with her to take a
house on the River Thames, generally in the vicinity of Marlow,
during the months of June, July, and August, and to this cool
retreat she always hurried at the close of her engagements in
London, even after the opera, from which she was obliged to
return by special train. During these terms of river residence
Melba did her utmost to make the place attractive for her
colleagues in art, and there she loved to entertain them.</p>
<p>At the close of this opera term, during which everybody had
been full of kindness to her, Melba decided to make that season's
verdict a lasting impression for her, and resolved never again to
read her newspaper notices. "It will be much better so," she
said. "Whenever anything very kind is published about me, some
friend is sure to cheer me by telling me of it. Whenever anything
disagreeable is written concerning me, it will be best that I
should miss it, for in spite of everything I am easily&mdash;too
easily&mdash;discouraged." This resolution she has kept, without
any air of superiority, without any claim to self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>During the years when Melba read every available expression of
opinion on her professional work, she never evinced the slightest
curiosity as to what her acquaintances or the world in general
thought of her as a private individual, and winced, as she often
does to-day, at the public discussion of her personal affairs. It
is an odd circumstance that for several seasons after her
operatic début, whenever any announcement of her artistic
successes appeared in the Australian papers, the members of her
family regarded this publicity with more humiliation than pride,
and never discussed such news with their friends. The passing
years have modified this attitude, but, in spite of everything,
Melba still retains a trace of the rigid Presbyterianism in which
she was reared.</p>
<p>Melba once laughingly confided to an inquirer that when she
retires from the stage she will cultivate the personal friendship
of the music critics, and enjoy an exchange of reminiscences.
Meanwhile she adheres to her conviction that unbiassed judgment
is practically impossible where the critic and the person
criticized are warm personal friends, and for this reason she
conscientiously holds herself aloof from the connoisseurs who are
called on to pronounce a public opinion on her efforts&mdash;a
resolve by which she has, doubtless, missed illuminating
association with many delightful men and women, whose
intellectual gifts under other circumstances none could more
fully appreciate than she. In view of this attitude, which has
occasionally been misunderstood, it is the more interesting to
recall one night at the height of the London opera season some
years ago, when Melba, much exhausted after a long performance,
drove to all the leading newspaper offices in the City, and
personally asked the editors to ignore an unfortunate accidental
mishap which had befallen one of the younger Continental singers
during the opera, the public mention of which would probably have
retarded the promising career of a gifted young artist. The
picture of Melba, the darling of the operatic world, whirling
round London at midnight, to excuse&mdash;and rightly
excuse&mdash;the artistic blunder of an obscure colleague, is one
that will not come readily to the public eye; for even among many
of her admiring followers it is an accepted belief that the
Australian soprano never casts aside the mantle of autocratic
arrogance with which popular imagination has long since, though
mistakenly, enveloped her.</p>
<p>About September 1899, was completed a bust of herself, from
the chisel of Mr. Bertram Mackennal, another native of Melbourne
who had made a name in London; and in offering it to the trustees
of the National Gallery, Melbourne, she wrote: "I beg that you
will accept it from a daughter of the city, as a tribute of her
unfailing remembrance and affection. May I express the hope that
I am not wholly forgotten in our beloved country, and that the
very cordial greetings which I venture to send through you to my
brother and sister Australians will not be without a kindly
response?" The gift was received with grateful appreciation, and
unveiled by Lord Brassey, then Governor of Victoria.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV</h3>
<p class="quote">"Der schönste Gesang bliebt immer der, welcher
in irgend einor Form in der Kunst zur völligen Natur wird; sicher
wird dieses Ziel am seltensten im Coloraturgesang erreicht, weil
hier die enormen technisehen Schwierigkeiten nur in seltenen
Fällen eine völlige Belierrschung zulassen Die Gesangskunst der
Frau Melba repräsentirt einen solchen Ausnahmefall
"&mdash;<span class="aa">Professor Martin Krause</span>
(Leipzig).</p>
<p><span class="aa">Melba's</span> Continental <i>tournée</i> for
the winter of 1899 began in Holland dining November, and was but
a repetition of the successes which she had already won in all
the other countries she had visited. At Amsterdam and Rotterdam
the enthusiasm of the people knew no bounds. The young Queen, who
evinces greater interest in other arts than in that of music, was
not in either city during the prima donna's visit, and for the
first time in her career Melba's artistic success was not
endorsed by the Sovereign of the country in which she was
performing. The operas given were "Faust," "Traviata,"
"Rigoletto," "Lucia," and Massenet's "Manon Lescaut," which were
also drawn on for her appearances in Germany and Austria.</p>
<p>For her first concert in Berlin, which took place at the
Philharmonic Hall, many people were unable to obtain admission,
and numbers of ladies in evening dress stood throughout. Her
programme for the occasion included Handel's "Sweet Bird,"
"L'ameró" from Mozart's "Il Re Pastore," Delibes's "Les Filles de
Cadix," and Verdi's "Ah, fors' è lui." For the Mozart air she had
the superlative advantage of a violin obbligato played by her
friend Joachim, and when both artists came on the platform
together the ovation accorded them was exceptional, Melba bowing
to the veteran so that all might understand her acknowledgment of
his greatness and his popularity.</p>
<p>After she had finished her programme numbers, the audience,
including the orchestra, broke into a further prolonged outburst
of applause, and she returned to the platform many times to
acknowledge the verdict of the Berlin public, on whose favour she
set great store, especially on this occasion of her first public
appearance in the city. Seeing that the house would not be
satisfied with her bows and smiles, she sat down at the piano,
and to her own accompaniment sang a German song, Bohm's "Still
wie die Nacht." This but increased the clamour of the audience,
and she was obliged to add another encore, this time an English
song, which she also accompanied. Still the people waited on,
cheering and applauding, and Melba, growing tired from the
repeated recalls, was at her wits' end how to close the
proceedings. She had long since decided never to sing with an
orchestra any item she had not rehearsed with them, so it was
impossible to add an orchestral number; and as she was too
fatigued again to undertake the dual rôle of singer and
accompanist a pianist was found, and it was only after she had
added a third extra song that the audience permitted her to
depart. By that time, owing to her multitudinous bows and
head-shakes, a tress of her hair had become loosened, and as she
brushed it back from her forehead in her final rush from the
platform, the audience joined in her own happy laughter.</p>
<p>One of the personal pleasures of this Berlin visit was the
meeting with Fritz Müller, a little boy protégé from her native
city, in whose home-coming she had taken a practical part, and
who has since made a considerable reputation throughout Germany
as a pianist and composer.</p>
<p>During the first week in December she sang "Lucia di
Lammermoor," which was attended by the Emperor and Empress and a
most brilliant audience. The singer herself has recalled the
visit as follows: "After the Mad Scene I was summoned to the
Imperial box, where I was received by their Majesties. I went
just as I was in my white Lucia dress and streaming, dishevelled
hair. They were both most gracious. I found the Emperor very
musical, and he discussed with me various methods of obtaining
certain vocal effects. He said he had never known such enthusiasm
in the Imperial Opera-House before. 'I hope you will come often
to sing at my Opera,' were his last words to me. I was to have
sung only four times during my visit, but these appearances had
to be extended to nine owing to the demands of the public."</p>
<p>Her paradoxical combination of spontaneity and restraint is an
artistic quality that found great favour with German musicians,
and a connoisseur, in describing her as the gaoler of a seemingly
limitless melody, commented on the reticence of her art as
unknown to the same degree in any other great singer of the
day.</p>
<p>Even in Italy where effective extravagance of vocalization in
any really competent singer always secures noisy acclaim from the
unthinking, her phenomenal facility never tempted her to
exaggeration, and this reticence was made the subject of
unstinted eulogy.</p>
<p>Endowed with qualifications of voice and technique that render
the embellishments of song a matter of unsurpassed ease, she
never allows the attainment of startling vocal effects to
interfere with the artistic design of a phrase. Her unfailing
good taste in this direction is a fine example for all singers.
In the case of most of the beautiful voices of our day the full
attraction of the organ is often disclosed on a single hearing,
but with Melba, owing to her extraordinary vocal
refinement&mdash;which calls for a certain measure of refinement
in those who hear&mdash;the reverse is the case, and each
successive experience reveals hitherto undreamt-of qualities of
tonal beauty, of expression, and of equipment. The voice and art
grow on the listener until the thorough enjoyment of Melba's
singing makes it almost difficult for her admirers to enjoy any
other. Even people who have frequently been ravished by the
loveliness of her public performance can have little idea what
that singing means in the more intimate atmosphere of home, where
the boy-like clarity of the voice, its opulence of "colour," the
insistent youth of every note, and the almost eerie spontaneity
of her production, can so charge with feeling each vocal phrase
that even the eyes of her own family grow dim as they listen to
some simple melody they have heard scores, even hundreds, of
times.</p>
<p>Before quitting Germany, Joachim conveyed a graceful
compliment to Melba by presenting her with a miniature violin,
exquisitely fashioned in ebony, as an illustration of the
people's mourning over her departure.</p>
<p>At the close of the Berlin season Melba made a flying visit to
Paris, where she was sought out by a representative of the
<em>Figaro</em>, who was anxious to get direct impressions of her
Dutch and German visits. The South African War was still raging,
and feeling against England ran high in the French capital during
those unfortunate days that preceded the <i>Entente Cordiale</i>
Melba's horror of war under any circumstances was intensified by
the fact that several of her own dear kinsmen and friends had
already fallen in the struggle. Whenever the war was mentioned,
it was with difficulty that she could restrain her tears. And
when the <em>Figaro</em> writer found her at the Hôtel Ritz, she
waived aside the question of her professional work, and upbraided
him for his country's want of sympathy with hers. Boldly she
asked:</p>
<p>"Pourquoi êtes-vous en France si mechants pour mon pays?
Voyons! nous aimons tant chez nous tout ce qui est français. Ce
n'est pas gentil de vous montrer presque heureux de nos
revers."</p>
<p>It was the New Year, the season in Paris when even professed
enemies try to make expression of mutual good-will, and the
journalist gallantly assured Melba that French animosity towards
England had been greatly exaggerated, and with courteous concern
asked when she would return to the opera.</p>
<p>"Croyez-vous vraiment que cela soit possible en ce moment? Une
Anglaise a l'Opéra de Paris?" Receiving protestations that the
politics of Mr. Chamberlain would not be remembered within the
temple of music, Melba added: "Je chanterai peutêtre pendant la
prochaine grande Exposition. La guerre sera terminée, je
l'éspère, a ce moment, et les Français nous considéront de
nouveau comme des amis."</p>
<p>This incident was but the shadow of an earlier stand. At a
time when France was swayed in the throes of her great latter-day
internal tumult, when even the bravest and most popular of her
sons feared to acknowledge the doubts with which they were torn,
who can recall without admiration the courage of Melba, a
sensitive woman, an alien within the gates, an artist dependent
on the favour of a foreign public, who, unabashed and fearless,
came forward, and with unreserved emphasis publicly proclaimed
her faith in the innocence of the persecuted soldier! All Paris
would resent her rashness, it was said, but she cheerfully faced
the threatened odds, and spoke for justice.</p>
<p>As in the case of Russia, Melba's visit to the
Austro-Hungarian Empire was the result of an Imperial summons
from the country's ruler, the Emperor Francis Joseph; so it
follows that she was sure of a most kindly reception. Her initial
appearance was in a concert on January 8, when an overflowing
throng came to greet her. Her programme was made up of favourite
operatic selections, and next day she was honoured with an
invitation to sing Violetta in "Traviata" at the Imperial
Opera-House on January 19, the prices throughout the house being
largely increased. Although German is the official language of
that establishment, she was notified by the Emperor that whatever
language she chose to sing in would be acceptable&mdash;a
compliment so cordial in itself that Melba was at once en rapport
with, the Viennese musical world.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image26" id="Image26"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>IMPERIAL WARRANT OF APPOINTMENT AS COURT SINGER TO H.I.M.
THE EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA</small></p>
<br>
<p>The presence of the aged Emperor at "Traviata" was a very
special honour, for His Majesty had not attended any public
entertainment of a similar character since the tragic death of
the Empress. To mark his appreciation of Melba's art, he made her
"Chamber Singer to the Imperial Court," and in forwarding the
warrant of appointment to this honour expressed his personal
admiration and goodwill.</p>
<p>In connection with this visit to Vienna, Madame Carreño, the
distinguished pianist, lately told a story when visiting
Melbourne, the city of Melba's birth. "I was engaged to appear in
Vienna, and on my arrival there I found myself down to play in
Binding's quartet, a work which I had not performed for some
years. So I set myself to practise it assiduously. Just when I
was hard at it a knock came at the door. 'The lady in the
adjoining room would feel greatly obliged if you could postpone
your practice for a couple of hours, as she has to appear at the
opera this evening, and requires to sleep, while if you continue
playing she must needs stay awake to listen to you.' 'And, pray,
who is the lady?' 'It is Madame Melba.'" Madame Carreño at once
acceded to the request, and even sacrificed a little more of her
practising time in order to be among the singer's audience that
night.</p>
<p>Under a little picture of himself the distinguished master
Theodore Leschetizky wrote a graceful tribute to the Australian
diva after this performance:</p>
<p align="right">"<span class=

<p>"<span class="aa">À Madame Nellie Melba</span>,</p>
<p>"Sous l'impression profonde de son interprétation magnifique

admiration pour la grande artiste et la charmante femme.</p>
<p align="right">"<span class="aa">Theodore
Leschetizky</span>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>On the return journey Melba sang at a Gewandhaus orchestral
concert at Leipzig, with Arthur Nikisch as conductor, and was
received with great acclaim, the late King of Saxony coining from
Dresden for the occasion, while the musicians and students made
her many compliments, Melba's share in the concert was set down
for the early part, and in the interval the King sent one of his
suite to say that he would be delighted if she would join His
Majesty's party in the royal box for the remainder of the
programme. When the King stood to receive her and offer his
congratulations, he told her that the Emperor of Austria had
written to him concerning her. The eyes of the whole audience
were turned in their direction, and for the rest of the evening
the balance of attention was given to the royal box. The
persistent use of opera-glasses directed towards the King and his
celebrated guest at length aroused some slight impatience in His
Majesty, who said, "They are staring at us as though we were a
couple of lions;" and then he smilingly added: "Well, I suppose
we are the lions of this evening."</p>
<p>On resuming her operatic routine at Monte Carlo, she sang in
"Traviata," with Tamagno as Alfredo, and Soulacroix as the elder
Germont, many people being unable to secure admission. The party
of the Prince of Monaco was so large that several of them had to
find accommodation in the fauteuils. Among the audience were many
well known in London operatic circles, including the Countess de
Grey, the Duchess of Marlborough, Lady Erskine, Countess Miranda,
and Mrs. Hwfa Williams. The French visitors endeavoured to
persuade Melba to fix on a time for once more appearing in their
capital, saying: "It is really time Madame Melba reappeared in
Paris, if only to prove that the art of singing is not yet
entirely lost." Her enforced absence from the opera through a
cold, on two dates subsequently announced, resulted in a silly
rumour that she had had a quarrel with the management, and this
became so persistent, like so many other canards of operatic
affairs, that she was forced to the unusual course of a public
contradiction.</p>
<p>One of the most vexatious circumstances of a great singer's
life is the persistence with which the irresponsible newspapers
of all countries accept misstatements of this kind. No opera
season is ever allowed to pass without the principal singers
being represented as engaged in violent conflict with their
friends, their colleagues, or their managers. The British artist,
in the necessary isolation to which Sir Augustus Harris once drew
attention, being one who by training and tradition is not prone
to the ebullitions said to be second nature to her Continental
colleagues, suffers doubly through these mischievous rumours,
which are peculiarly distasteful to the generally reserved
Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI</h3>
<p class="quote">"In segno di gratitudine ed ammirazione per il
talento, amabilità e simpatia della bella Signora
Melba."&mdash;<span class="aa">Alfredo Platti</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">In</span> 1900, as usual, Melba had a summer
residence on the reaches of the Thames, and one of the most
welcome of her guests was a young Australian student, Miss Regina
Nagel, who possessed a beautiful contralto voice, to the training
of which the prima donna devoted herself with ardour. For a
concert given at the Royal University Hall, Dublin, on August 28,
for the benefit of the Soldiers and Sailors' Help Society, Melba
volunteered her services, and at the same time secured an
important introduction for her young protégée, who had a place on
the programme, to which the Countess of Limerick and Mr. Joseph
O'Mara also contributed; the entertainment netting £1,000.</p>
<p>During this visit Melba was the guest of the then
Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, Earl Cadogan, and the Countess
Cadogan, at the Viceregal Lodge, and she joined her hosts in
their state visit to the horse-show, an event of peculiar
interest to the singer, who is known to ride and drive admirably,
and whose love for horses has not even been eradicated by her
subsequent enthusiasm for motoring, which she laughingly declares
to be her <i>grande passion</i>.</p>
<p>She also attended the Leopardstown Races, and such other
social functions as were compatible with the term of Court
mourning for the Duke of Saxe-Coburg. She thoroughly enjoyed the
week in the Irish capital, of which she took away as a souvenir a
beautiful screen, designed and embroidered by the Royal Irish
School of Art Needlework, and presented to her by the
Lord-Lieutenant.</p>
<p>Bitter east winds played havoc with the voices of several of
the opera singers during the early part of the season, and it was
not until May 21 that Melba was able to make her entrée at Covent
Garden, the opera being "La Bohème," with Signor Bonci as
Rodolfo. The audience included the Prince and Princess of Wales,
the Duke and Duchess of Connaught, and the Duke and Duchess of
Fife, who were conspicuous by their presence on almost every
"Melba night" of that season, during which the cantatrice
confined her activities to "Romeo and Juliet" with Saleza, and
later with Jean de Reszke; "Faust," "The Barber of Seville,"
"Lucia di Lammermoor," and 'La Bohème," as already mentioned. She
also appeared at a number of private concerts, although her
minimum fee for these occasions had now reached what one would
assume to be an almost prohibitive rate.</p>
<p>A leading London actor-manager once remarked to Melba: "I
can't understand why you like singing Mimi; it is certainly not a
star part." "But," said she, with a twinkle in her eye, "you see,
I am not an actor-manager."</p>
<p>In order to tour in Holland, Germany, Austria, and Saxony,
Melba missed her usual American visit in the winter of 1899-1900,
but the following season found her again in the United States,
which she once more explored as far west as the Pacific. "La
Bohème" was given at Denver for the first time. Puccini's work
was now, through Melba's enthusiasm, well established, and on
December 26 there was given at New York what was described by the
<i>Sun</i> as its first adequate performance in that city. The
same authority, after the usual unreserved tribute to her voice,
singled out the excellence of her characterization, having in a
prior summary directed attention to the increased beauty of her
middle register and her added broadness of style. In every centre
visited the connoisseurs noticed these same qualities, a
recognition very encouraging to one whose full honours never
interfere with her endeavour towards more perfect development.
Mr. Henry Krehbiel's description of "her fresh May morning voice,
full of dewy sparkles, and that exquisitely true intonation which
so woos the ear," was now familiar throughout the length and
breadth of the country.</p>
<p>Melba had become a "lion" in the land of the eagle. She was
fêted and flattered by private and public attentions, and
President McKinley in the strenuous activities of his second
election campaign, found time to visit her dressing-room in
Chicago to congratulate her and express his good wishes. Mr.
McKinley was a man for whom the artificiality of the theatre had
no attraction, neither was he given to superficial compliment,
and his action could not fail to make a very considerable
impression on the singer. His appreciation was representative of
the public attitude towards her. One penalty of her popularity
was the unremitting attention of the interviewers, who were
constantly seeking fresh stories. Her dread of facing them was
well known, and added a certain piquancy to their pursuit of her.
The more eagerly she pleaded for privacy, the more surely they
responded with increased publicity, almost always confining their
imaginary interviews to harmless inventions and humorous
absurdities. When her steamer entered Sandy Hook, one
enterprising journalist drew himself up on a rope immediately
after the pilot, and later, when she declined to be interviewed,
he said: "If you won't answer me, I'll fake." "Then fake," said
she; and he did, to the extent of a sensational two-column
article, which no one could read without a smile.</p>
<p>The revival of "The Huguenots" on January 28, 1901, with
Nordica, Jean de Reszke, Plançon, and Melba in the cast, was one
of the most interesting productions of the season, which closed
on April 29 with a remarkable entertainment given for the benefit
of Mr. Maurice Grau, the manager, at which Madame Sarah Bernhardt
and Monsieur Coquelin added their assistance to that of the whole
band of operatic artists. The crowd was so great that over forty
women were removed from the auditorium in a fainting condition
during the performance, and the enthusiasm of the evening was
extraordinary. Bernhardt, Coquelin, Melba, Nordica, Salignac,
Susanne Adams, Édouard de Reszke, Schumann-Heink, Bispham, Susan
Strong, Fritzi Scheff, Rose Olitzka, Bauermeister, and Jean de
Reszke, were all on the programme. It was a memorable evening,
and, as it turned out, Jean de Reszke's farewell to America.</p>
<p>On the opening of the London season Melba adhered to "La
Bohème," followed by the Mad Scene from "Lucia," which double
bill had proved the most potent attraction at the Metropolitan
Opera-House during the preceding New York season. Her other
appearances were made in equally familiar rôles, the selection
for the closing night being "Romeo and Juliet." She gave her
services for a concert held at Stafford House by the Duchess of
Sutherland in aid of the Lifeboat Association, and, at a supper
which followed, Her Grace, in announcing the splendid financial
result, paid a warm tribute to Melba's ever-ready help. The
season was one of unusual social activities, and so many requests
for Melba's professional services were made that her agent was
obliged to make a public announcement of largely increased
fees.</p>
<p>The most brilliant of these musical receptions were those
given by Mr. Astor&mdash;where Melba's colleagues were
Paderewski, Kubelik, and Plançon&mdash;by Mr. Alfred de
Rothschild, and by Mrs. Ogilvy Haig. She fulfilled one or two
provincial engagements in England before proceeding to Scotland,
where she spent part of her holiday at Dunrobin Castle as the
guest of the Duke and Duchess of Sutherland.</p>
<p>A charming impression of another Scottish visit, to the home
of Mr. and Mrs. Murray Guthrie, in the Isle of Mull, was embodied
in Mrs. Crawshay's little poem: *</p>
<p class="foot">[* Published by permission of Mrs. Crawshay.]</p>
<p align="center">TO MADAME MELBA.<br>
<br>
<span class="aa">A Voice in Mull.</span></p>
<div class="negindent6">Grey tarn set where tall crags tower,<br>
Lost in lonely rugged height,</div>
<div class="negindent6">On thy darkness floats a flower,<br>
Chalice-shaped, mysterious, white.</div>
<br>
<div class="negindent6">Low the winds blow, soft and tender,<br>
Round its purity divine,</div>
<div class="negindent6">Worshipping with wistful wonder<br>
Lily in so rough a shrine.</div>
<br>
<div class="negindent6">Voice of clear and silvery sweetness<br>
Breaks the silence of the hills.</div>
<div class="negindent6">Mountain streams all check their

<div class="negindent6">Trees arrest their ceaseless
swinging,<br>
Island creatures hold their breath;</div>
<div class="negindent6">While those notes to heaven are
winging,<br>
The very sea lies still as death.</div>
<p>Retaining very pleasant recollections of her stay in Ireland
the preceding year, she was easily persuaded to make another
visit, and sang with the Belfast Philharmonic Society on October
18, her support on that occasion again including Miss Nagel, her
protégée. The whole of the tickets were sold out several days in
advance, and the greatest interest was shown in her coming. It
was arranged to receive her at the main entrance of the Ulster
Hall, but, owing to her distaste for public demonstrations, this
plan was altered at the last moment, to the disappointment of the
crowd who waited in the vestibule. She was accompanied to the
hall by the Duke and Duchess of Abercorn (with whom she enjoyed a
week's rest at Barons Court), by the Marchioness of Hamilton, the
Ladies Gladys and Alexandra Hamilton, the Marchioness of
Dufferin, Lady Hermione Blackwood, and Lord Frederick Hamilton.
She also made a holiday visit to Lord and Lady Rossmore, in
County Monaghan, before leaving the Emerald Isle.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII</h3>
<p class="quote">"A great singer, a great woman, guided by a
prodigious individuality."&mdash;<span class="aa">The Right Hon.
Cecil Rhodes</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Prince Albert</span> of Monaco was among the
audience at the inauguration of the Monte Carlo opera season
early in February 1902, when Melba and Caruso began their
artistic association&mdash;the opera being "La Bohème." The usual
encomiums were lavished on her interpretation, which was full of
simple art, exquisite, and tender. Prince Charles Ferdinand of
Austria, the Grand Duke Michael of Russia and the Countess Torby,
and the Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg and Monsieur Santos Dumont,
were present at this <i>première</i>, which was in every sense a
great success. A month later the stage adaptation of Berlioz's
cantata, "The Damnation of Faust," was revived there, with Melba,
Jean de Reszke, and Renaud in the principal parts, which were
portrayed with consummate art. This work is one in which Melba
took a profound interest, and there could be no doubt as to her
gratification over the general verdict, which was well expressed
by the <em>Figaro</em> critic, who said: "Madame Melba est une
délicieuse Marguerite. Elle traduit avec une poésie intense
l'heroine touchante de Berlioz. Grande cantatrice, certes, et la
plus grande; grande tragedienne aussi, sachant avec une suprème
simplicité, presque sans gestes (mais que ces gestes, si sobres,
sont expressifs), exterioriser l'âme, faire passer le frisson
d'amour et de douleur. C'est d'un art exquis et puissant." During
the season "Rigoletto" was also given, with Melba, Caruso, and
Renaud, and in their hands the attraction of the performance was
remarkable.</p>
<p>After the Riviera, Melba paid a first professional visit to
Switzerland, and during the second week of March gave an
orchestral concert at Geneva, where, in response to the calls of
her delighted audience, she sang extra German songs to her own
accompaniment.</p>
<p>At the close of these arduous months of professional activity
she returned to Paris, but not for rest, as the attentions of the
countless friends she had made during her long term of residence
in that city soon engulfed her in a whirl of social excitement.
The most brilliant of the functions organized in her honour was
the fête given by Madame Bemberg (mother of the composer of
"Elaine") in the venue du Bois de Boulogne, whereat the guest of
honour sang to the delight of the party, which included the
Duchess of Sutherland, the Duchess of Manchester, the Duchesse de
Monteagudo, and Baronne de Gunzburg.</p>
<p>Her <i>rentrée</i> at Covent Garden on May 14 in "Rigoletto"
was further notable for the first appearance in England of Signor
Caruso as the Duke, which rôle he had sung with her at Monte
Carlo earlier in the 3"ear, and in which he, as also Renaud as
the Jester, created a splendid impression. The Queen, Princess
Victoria, and the Duchess of Fife were the royalties present on
the occasion, which had all the attributes of a "Melba night" in
brilliancy, crowding, and enthusiasm. The morrow brought the
usual chorus of flattering comment. The King and Queen attended
Melba's second appearance, which was in "La Bohème."</p>
<p>Mention of the Sovereign recalls an incident. Madame Susanna
Cole, the aged vocalist who had sung at a festival service in
Hereford Cathedral at the Coronation of Queen Victoria, had
expressed a wish to hear Melba in "Rigoletto," for the
gratification of which wish her shattered fortunes allowed no
promise. Someone brought the matter under the notice of the
Australian prima donna, and she at once placed her box at the
disposal of Madame Cole.</p>
<p>In the Royal Academy of that year a life-size portrait of
Melba occupied a conspicuous place. It was the work of her
countryman Mr. Rupert Bunny, whose career she has followed with
interest from his earliest efforts in Paris. Step by step in her
own progress she has always found time to keep in touch with the
doings of the leading painters, sculptors, and writers,
especially those who hail from her native land. She realizes that
it is not always easily possible to fulfil the sentimental
ambition of becoming a prophet in one's own country, and has been
generosity itself in helping many towards that fulfilment. Her
portrait bust had already inspired a compatriot to admirable
efforts, her purse was enabling another to continue his art
studies in Paris, and in the case of Rupert Bunny her friendship
availed him to furnish the Royal Academy with one of his best
paintings.</p>
<p>At this time there came to London a young Australian art
student who had been working in Paris, but whose health had
failed under the conditions of vitiated atmosphere and improper
food so familiar to residents in the Latin Quarter. His lungs had
become affected, and the doctor he consulted told him that an
immediate return to his native land was the only chance of
restoring his health. Life had become very sweet to the youth,
for the recognition of his extraordinary talent had filled him
with dreams of a famous future. The journey to Australia requires
considerable money, and he had none; neither had he any friends
at hand who could lend it to him; and in this plight he sought
out Melba, of whose kindness to one of his comrades he already
knew. He was entirely unknown to her, but in his desperation he
persuaded himself that would not matter, and he was right. She
gave him £100 for the journey, and in the most delicate way
pretended to regard it as a temporary loan. Then she said: "The
steamer sails on Friday. If it will help you to have a sketch of
me among your pictures, I shall give you two or three sittings
between now and then;" and in that interval she cheered him with
glowing stories of his future, and with many humorous summaries
on the quips and cranks she assured him he would develop in the
time of his promised affluence. In spite of her kindly
intervention, he died three or four years later in Australia.
"They told me to come where the telegraph wires are always
bright, and Melba made it possible for me to come, but they are
not bright enough," was the sad acknowledgment of his closing
days.</p>
<p>Throughout this season she gave Sunday afternoon musical
parties at her town-house, which, apart from the charm of
friendly intercourse, she made serve the extra purpose of
introducing promising young students to artists and social
patrons likely to help them on their way. At these parties young
Australia was not forgotten, and there, long before the London
public had recognized Percy Grainger's gifts, Melba was his
sponsor and his herald. No great artist has ever so helped
beginners as has Melba, but even the very multiplicity of her
favours often adds to her confusion. She makes it a rule to give
steady practical help, in whatever form it is most needed, for at
least one year, generally two, to whatever novice has
successfully appealed for her patronage; but when the time comes
for one protégée to retire in favour of another, the occasion is
almost always fraught with a certain amount of youthful jealousy
and disappointment. Melba contends that after a year or two of
"farming" in her hands a student ought to be able to do something
to help herself, and, while never losing interest in any such
protégée, she endeavours to show the need of self-reliance,
lessons which are invariably accepted with a bewildering want of
philosophy. In these dilemmas Melba is always well served by her
humour and kindly toleration.</p>
<p>As an instance of this one may recall a small but very
important concert organized by Melba to help a young singer.
Several members of the Royal Family were to be present, all the
leading critics were to be there, and the occasion was one that
would have given almost any artist a coveted public appearance,
and practically she could have had her choice among the whole
profession. In consideration of all these circumstances dozens of
well-known performers had offered their services. At the last
moment one of those chosen was unable to appear through illness,
and, as a substitute, Melba mentioned a young musician to whom
she had shown many kindnesses. and "who was just beginning to be
known. She made the suggestion as a direct compliment to him, for
there were many pining to fill the vacant place, and her surprise
can be imagined when he intimated, through her secretary, that he
would expect his fee. Melba was full of resentment?&mdash;no,
quite the contrary; not even a shadow of it. On being assured
that his message was not a joke, she burst out laughing, and when
the opportunity next offered, she had entirely forgotten the
unreasonable demand of her young friend, and through the medium
of her influence she helped him over another obstacle in his
career.</p>
<p>"Not less beneficial than this encouragement of young
students, although indirect, has been Melba's influence on the
professional status of the English musician," writes Mr. J. A.
Fuller-Maitland. "It is not so very long since the reproach of
English birth or origin was enough to prejudice the general
public against the performer, and, as a natural result, the
adoption of foreign names by the average singer has been a
standing joke for many years. Some people in the present day
might be found to wish that the name of 'Mrs. Armstrong' were as
powerful as that of 'Madame Melba' to draw a crowded audience
together; but, in spite of this concession to a national weakness
which prevailed at the time of her début, Melba has done more
than perhaps any other individual to remove the stigma formerly
attaching to British subjects as musical performers. In all
grades of the musical art the status of our compatriots has now
been altered so completely that 'Miss Smith' is just as likely to
get engagements as 'Mademoiselle Maréchal Ferrand' would be.
English singers and players are now accepted on their merits, and
people. do not attach the smallest importance to the name by
which they are known. This fine position has been definitely won,
and in so far as the credit is due to any one person, that one
person is undoubtedly Melba. Since her advent, managers and
others, at home and abroad, are no longer afraid to announce the
real nationality of their young singers, and the rate at which
English performers are rewarded for their exertions is no longer
ludicrously beneath the rate at which third-rate Continental
performers were formerly paid."</p>
<p>In honour of the approaching Coronation of King Edward, a
grand concert&mdash;organized by the <em>Daily
Express</em>&mdash;at which Melba sang, was given at the Albert
Hall, London, on June 11, in aid of the King's Hospital Fund, and
the occasion was made one for a great outburst of patriotism. At
half-past eight the sounding of a fanfare on the silver trumpets
lent by His Majesty heralded the approach of the Prince and
Princess of Wales. On their entering the Royal box the whole
audience stood, and the golden voice of Melba rang through the
vast building in the first verse of the National Anthem. Madame
Clara Butt sang the second verse; then every person in the whole
great concourse unfurled a miniature Union Jack, and as the wave
of colour moved from floor to ceiling the assembled throng sang
the final verse in an ever-increasing tumult of sound that
produced a most profound impression.</p>
<p>Another of the record Coronation events of that gay season in
which Melba took part was the great charity bazaar, by which
about £30,000 ($150,000) was raised in three days. The prima
donna was an assistant at a stall presided over by the Countess
of Huntingdon, a sister Australian, and daughter of one of the
pioneer squatters, Sir Samuel Wilson.</p>
<p>Among the brilliant private parties at which she sang were
those given by Mrs. Bradley Martin in honour of Princess
Christian, by Mr. W. W. Astor, and by Mr. Alfred de Rothschild,
who again had the privilege of entertaining the Prince of Wales
at his beautiful home in Seamore Place. At a dinner which
preceded this latter party, Melba sat between Lord Kitchener and
General Lucas Meyer, then the guests of a mutual friend, but
lately the leaders of opposing armies.</p>
<p>Lord Roberts was also one of the guests on that interesting
occasion. Two weeks later poor Meyer died in Holland, mourned as
sincerely by his late foes as by the friends who had long known
him.</p>
<p>On another evening, when Mr. Alfred de Rothschild was again
host to a number of notable people at Seamore Place, Melba was in
conversation with the late Right Hon. Cecil Rhodes, who said:
"Tell me, madame, is it the art or the applause you like?" "How
dare you ask me such a question?" she said quickly, with a
candour comparable to his own. Then he seemed for a moment
absorbed in a sort of reverie, and said half musingly, without
looking at the singer: "I was wrong." Allowing himself another
brief pause, he looked straight at Melba, and, in tones as if of
a newly-born conviction, added: "Yes, I was wrong. After all, it
is the power we like, isn't it?"</p>
<p>She also sang at Dudley House for Mr. J. B. Robinson, and
secured the introduction of another protégée, Miss Ada Sassoli,
harpist, on a programme which was contributed to by Madame Sarah
Bernhardt, Mr. Kubelik, Monsieur Coquelin, and Monsieur Plançon.
Another unusual private party was that given by Mrs. (now Lady)
Cooper in Grosvenor Square, at which Melba and Bernhardt sang and
recited the vocal parts of Bemberg's "Ballade du Désespéré." As
usual, too, Melba sang frequently at Lady de Grey's charming
Sunday gatherings at Coombe, and at a charity concert given by
the Duchess of Sutherland at Stafford House</p>
<p>Never was the popularity of the singer more strikingly
evidenced than throughout this season, and the concert she
organized for Miss Regina Nagel was but another opportunity for
the public to show their favour by an overflowing audience and
corresponding enthusiasm. At Covent Garden her appearance was a
sure signal for a "capacity" house; indeed, on June 13, when
"Faust" was staged for the first time that year, a violent
rain-storm could not diminish the numbers of her followers, and
hundreds of people were turned away from the cheaper parts of the
house.</p>
<p>During one of the performances of "Traviata," which was
attended by a large number of Australian soldiers who had come to
London to take part in the Coronation celebrations, and who had
planned a demonstration in honour of their countrywoman, they
presented her with a magnificent bouquet to the ribbons of which
were attached badges of their different regiments, which had been
worn in action during the South African campaign. Coming as it
did at a time when she was preparing to pay her first return
visit to her native land, the gift was doubly significant and
acceptable.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image27" id="Image27"></a><img alt=""
src="1401681h-images/Image27.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>MELBA AS "MARGUERITE" IN "FAUST"</small></p>
<br>
<p>Her name was on everybody's lips, her doings were discussed
with assiduity, and "Melba" stories were so popular that no
newspaper could be without one. That told by Mr. G. R. Sims
("Dagonet") as an actual experience will serve as a sample: "I
changed my canary's cage from a small to a large one. Although he
was as lively as ever, he left off singing. One evening it struck
me that Richard Yea and Nay might like to hear a rival artist. So
I carried his cage to the electrophone stand, and placed the
receiver, or whatever it is called, close against the bars. The
famous prima donna was just in the middle of her great scene in
'La Bohème.' The canary stuck up his head, and his little black
eyes almost started out of it with astonishment. Then suddenly he
burst into a glorious melody. Little did Melba dream that night
of triumph that she was singing a duet with my canary."</p>
<p>Than the sway she exercised no better evidence could be
adduced in support of Mr. Marion Crawford's claim that "the
position of a successful lyric prima donna with regard to other
artists and the rest of the world is altogether exceptional, and
is not easy to explain
.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. In the
popular mind those artists represent something which they
themselves do not
understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.
No other artists enjoy such popularity."</p>
<p>Many a strong head would have lost its perfect balance through
similar adulation and attentions, but Melba's common-sense was
never demoralized. Before and behind the scenes she was simple,
straightforward, reliable, with a hitherto unknown consideration
for her stage companions. One of the Covent Garden officials, in
commenting on it, said: "I wish all singers had the intelligence
and practical sense that Melba has. She realizes the difficulties
of the management, and does not selfishly add to them. Last year,
for instance, in the Church Scene in 'Faust,' she had to play the
scene at first in front of gauze columns imperfectly set up, and
frequent draughts blew the painted edifice over the kneeling
Marguerite. Of course she strongly objected, and said it did not
tend to intensify the dramatic moment; but after that she sang
the scene on the steps of the church instead of close to the
columns, whereas any other prima donna would have demanded a new
scene to be built and painted during the acts." Her punctuality,
her preparedness, have become a byword behind the scenes, where
the traditions as to great singers' caprices throw her
common-sense into high relief.</p>
<p>When the musical celebrations for the Coronation were being
arranged, it was regarded as a felicitous circumstance that
Melba, a daughter of the Empire, was available to shed the lustre
of her art on an occasion of such great Imperial significance.
The King had notified her of his pleasure, and Sir Edward Elgar
had also been honoured with His Majesty's command for the
composition of a festal ode, in which she would, naturally, be
the leading vocalist. Melba was to sing other music at the gala
performance which was to celebrate the Coronation, but her part
in the new work was naturally anticipated as an item of paramount
interest. The sudden and deplorable illness of the Sovereign on
the eve of the great ceremony necessitated the abandonment of the
gala performance, for which the most elaborate preparations had
been made, and for which tickets had been sold at fabulous
prices. Had the gala taken place, however, there would certainly
have been considerable disappointment over Melba's share, for it
transpired that the Coronation Ode was practically without a solo
or any other adequate scope for her gifts. She, of course, would
have been delighted to sing any rôle, however insignificant, if
by doing so she could emphasize her readiness to honour the King,
and everybody who knew the circumstances would have realized that
inspiration does not always respond to the personal wishes of
even the creative artist himself.</p>
<p>She made her farewell appearance at the opera on July 28,
before an audience which included numbers of Australian troopers,
who voiced their good wishes in a tumult of applause that made
her realize in advance the welcome that awaited her at home.</p>

<br>
<p><span class="aa">Modesty</span> and simplicity were the
primary characteristics of Madame Melba's first departure from
the land of her birth, but in her return, after fifteen years'
enjoyment of world-wide and undreamt-of fame, there were all the
elements necessary to a popular sensation. Two or three times
every year since 1889, when her début in Paris had aroused such
widespread interest, it was usual to find a rumour in circulation
that Melba was about to pay a visit to Australia. The necessary
subsequent denial, extending over so long a term, ultimately led
to a Melba visit being regarded as the most unlikely of events,
and the improbability of her returning home was embodied with
considerable humour in numerous local verses and jokes. In
November, 1901, she sent the following cable to the Australian
press:</p>
<br>
<p>"It gives me very great pleasure to inform you that I have
definitely arranged with Mr. George Musgrove to pay a
professional visit to Australia next year after the London
season. I shall sail from England in August, and give a series of
concerts in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide, during the
months of September, October, and November. I believe that on
many occasions rumours have been published of my going to sing in
my native country, but they have never been authorized by me, as
until now the difficulties appertaining to such a venture have
proved unsurmountable. Now that these difficulties have been
removed, I cannot tell you how delighted I am in looking forward
to a visit so full of potential pleasure to myself in the renewal
of old friendships with the people among whom I was born and
brought up; and if by the exercise of my art I am able to add
some joy to the lives of my countrywomen and countrymen, my
happiness will be complete.</p>
<p align="right">"<span class="aa">Nellie
Melba</span>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Immediately after this news had been made known, hundreds of
cables, telegrams, and letters expressive of gratification were
sent to Melba; among them a message from the Prince of Wales,
who, after referring to the indelible memory left by His Royal
Highness's own recent welcome to the Commonwealth, assured the
prima donna of an enormously appreciative reception in the
country of her birth. On August 22 she sailed from Vancouver in
the <i>Miowera</i>, and was due to arrive at Brisbane early on
Sunday, September 14. Neither on that day nor on the two
following days was there any news of the vessel, and on the
morning of Wednesday, September 17, natural anxiety was greatly
increased by a rumour that the <i>Miowera</i> was wrecked in
Moreton Bay. At two o'clock on that afternoon a reassuring
telegram was received from Cape Moreton, but the uncertainty had
already been sufficient to intensify the public interest in the
coming of Melba, who was safely landed after nine o'clock that
evening. In order to make that possible, and save herself and the
public any further inconvenience or disappointment, the
Commissioner of Health decided to waive the usual regulations,
and went down the bay at the earliest possible moment to make his
examination and admit the vessel to pratique. With him were a few
privileged persons, including the Mayor and Mayoress of Brisbane
(Mr. and Mrs. George Corrie), to tender a welcome on behalf of
the northern city in which she had been married and spent many
happy days before the dreams of a professional career had taken
any definite shape. Melba's belief in the Australian people's
affection, and her lifelong distaste for public ostentation, made
her ask in advance that there should be nothing formal in her
welcome home; but she was greatly touched by the action of the
Mayor and Mayoress, who had undertaken an uncomfortable and
fatiguing trip in order to give her early assurance of
Australia's good-will, and the gift of a bouquet composed of the
national flower&mdash;wattle blossom&mdash;which Mrs. Corrie made
on boarding the steamer, filled the singer with manifest
delight.</p>
<p>"My native land," she said to a friend who had come from
Melbourne, on getting near the crumbling bluff of Moreton Island.
"Yes, my country. I bowed to it three times for luck when I first
saw it half an hour ago." When she spoke the first words there
was sadness in her eyes; when she imitated the curtsey she had
made to the island she had already changed to mirth. Next moment
her face was grave again, and she continued: "Oh, I do hope the
people will like me in Australia! Everybody said I was never in
such fine Voice as this season in London, and I do hope it will
be the same here. I have experienced many emotions, and I have
enjoyed many successes, but I know that when I stand on the
platform of the Melbourne Town Hall for my first concert I shall
feel the greatest emotion of my whole life. I am not nervous in
the slightest, yet something rises in my heart, and almost chokes
me, when I think of coming back again after all these years to
sing to the Melbourne people, and especially to my dear father."
Asked for a message to the public, she said: "A message? Am I to
send them a message? Well, I am glad to say something to the
people of my dearly-loved native land. Tell them I am happy to be
back, happy to know they take an interest in me. I shall sing to
them from my heart, and it is perhaps well that I should not have
to speak, for I should fail to say even half what I feel. It is a
home-coming to me after many years, a home-coming I have looked
for and can never forget." She had played cricket and other games
on board, and had entered cordially into all the interests of the
passengers, who, with the ship's crew, gave her a hearty cheer as
she stepped ashore.</p>
<p>Next morning she started for the South. At Toowoomba and
Newcastle the Mayors of these towns attended to greet her in
passing, and to present flowers; and at Hornsey and all the
smaller stations there were crowds to cheer, even when the train
did not stop. On arrival at Sydney, where she had to make a
temporary break in the journey, there was another demonstration,
which was renewed on her departure in the evening. As she neared
the city of her birth and her home, the excitement increased; the
railway-stations were decorated, and wherever the train stopped
flowers were rained upon her. To Albury, about 200 miles from
Melbourne, where she was to cross the border into her native
state&mdash;Victoria&mdash;her father, Mr. David Mitchell, had
travelled the day before in the state car which the Railway
Commissioners had sent to convey the great Victorian home. He had
come in pride and affection to welcome his favourite child, who,
in the sixteen years since their parting, had placed a twofold
value on every step of her success because of the pleasure it
would bring to him. They had parted at a moment when London
connoisseurs held out no hope of the realization of her dreams;
they were to meet at a moment when the realization of these
dreams had raised her to a position of unrivalled eminence in
operatic art.</p>
<p>The meeting was to be fraught with unspeakable pleasure to
both, and in the eager reckoning of Melba the express train moved
but at a snail's pace. At length Albury was reached, and in
breathless eagerness she rushed to the window for a sight of her
father. He was nowhere to be seen, and in a few moments she
learned that he had been so affected by his own feelings and the
manifestations of popular enthusiasm over her home-coming that he
had been seized with paralysis and was seriously ill. Melba,
already nerve-strung with fatigue and all the emotional activity
incidental to such an occasion, was almost overwhelmed by the
news, and had to be supported on the platform. In the midst of
her joyous and regal progress, the central figure in a welcome of
which any Sovereign might be proud, she was led to the bedside of
her stricken father. Such were the conditions under which they
met after many and momentous years of separation. Being assured
that there was no immediate danger, she was persuaded by her
father to continue the journey to Melbourne, as he plaintively
pleaded that any disappointment to the public would only retard
his recovery. The doctors in attendance also urged this course,
and Melba nerved herself for the ordeal, which even under the
happiest circumstances would have been trying, but which under
the conditions alluded to was extremely harrowing.</p>
<p>Great numbers of people saw the express depart from Albury,
and immediately it crossed the Victorian border rounds of cheers
intimated to Melba that she had entered her native State.
Excitement was now at a high pitch, and all along the line people
could be seen waving to the speeding train. At Wangaratta, Euroa,
Benalla, Seymour, and all stations where a stop was made, there
were addresses, flowers, cheers, and deputations from public and
private bodies, the railway buildings being decorated with flags
and greenery as a further manifestation of the people's voluntary
tribute to the homecoming celebrity. One of Melba's sisters had
joined the party in New South Wales, and the other sisters and
brothers boarded the express at Seymour. She had thus met all the
immediate members of her own family before reaching Melbourne,
where the scene at the Spencer Street station was one of
remarkable popular ardour. Although the people fulfilled the
letter of Melba's request, that her homecoming should not be made
the occasion of any organized demonstration, yet they excusably
disregarded the spirit of her petition, and in the fervour of
their spontaneous greeting gave her a welcome which could never
have been equalled by any formal tribute. The space where her
train was to enter was closed to the public; the issue of tickets
of admission was strictly limited; yet from early morn until one
o'clock, when she stepped on to the platform, thousands of people
waited in the vicinity of the station.</p>
<p>It was known that she was travelling in the state car, with
which the people had become familiar during the journeyings of
the Prince and Princess of Wales, and immediately a lady alighted
on the platform from this section, some boys on a neighbouring
roof called out: "Three cheers for Nellie!" The response notified
the crowds outside that she had arrived, and roars of welcome
were given long before she came in view of the waiting throng.
"What with policemen vainly endeavouring to keep a clear track to
the gates for a carriage, photographers perched up on portable
and miniature towers, and thousands of persons good-humouredly
hustling one another in a fight to secure the best positions, the
enclosure presented a scene of animation only equalled by the
reception accorded to the first Governor-General. Admission to
the platform was by ticket, but this did not prevent its being
filled almost to the point of discomfort. Here were to be seen
Lord Richard Nevill, representing His Excellency the acting
Governor-General; the Mayor of Melbourne (Sir Samuel Gillott),
the Secretary for Railways (Mr. Robert Kent), the Secretary for
Defence (Captain Collins, R.N.), and many others. Madame Melba
had stepped lightly on to the platform before anyone was aware of
the fact, but in an instant she was surrounded by a surging mass
of people striving to see and welcome her. Lord Richard Nevill
was the first in welcoming the diva on Lord Tennyson's behalf,
and Sir Samuel Gillott immediately followed suit for the city, at
the same time presenting a very handsome bouquet. Then there were
relatives and old friends and new acquaintances pressing forward
for a hand-clasp, and all within reasonable distance were not
disappointed. Looking the picture of happiness, there was a
vivaciousness, a friendliness of expression, in Madame Melba's
radiant smile of acknowledgment which immediately ingratiated her
in the hearts of those who were displaying their pleasure,
perhaps too demonstratively, by impeding her movements. And for
friends divided from her by the crowd there was a merry wave of
the hand. The hands, however, were soon filled with bouquets,
which, seemed to spring out of the ground, until Madame Melba
could carry no more.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image28" id="Image28"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>MELBA'S ARRIVAL IN MELBOURNE, 1902</small></p>
<br>
<p>"After the first few seconds spent in satisfying curiosity,
cheers burst out within the barrier, and acted like a match to
powder in stirring up the crowd outside to loud hurrahs. Nobody
evinced any desire to allow her to escape to her carriage. For a
few minutes she could not move forward, and her retreat was cut
off. Then burly and impassive George Musgrove placed himself on
her left hand, and Mr. T. A. Patterson (brother-in-law) on the
right, while a sturdy young fellow, fired with the strength of a
Sandow for the occasion, led the way, and the little party began
to cleave through the crowd. After a short but fierce struggle
the carriage in waiting was reached, and Madame Melba took her
seat. But where were the rest of the party? Lost in the crowd,
and imprisoned for some time. Strong and willing assistance was
near, however, and they were rescued one by one and piloted to
the gate.</p>
<p>"Meantime the crowd was cheering itself hoarse, and the
central figure in this royal reception&mdash;the Queen of
Song&mdash;was bowing continually. To a friend standing by the
carriage steps she handed a bunch of violets. "Give us all some,"
a voice called out amidst a deafening clamour; and, evidently
delighted by the suggestion, Madame Melba began to tear up the
heaps of flowers that filled the seats of the carriage, and to
throw them to all sides. The melee that ensued was indescribable.
Men almost came to blows in disputing the right to a daffodil,
women looked unutterable things at one another over a few sadly
damaged violets, while boys, with a keen eye to business,
gathered all they could, and had a brisk market in the sale of
'Melba mementoes.'</p>
<p>"Until the family party was complete, Madame Melba continued
despoiling herself of floral offerings, and when doing so she
managed to loosen a gold purse of strange and exquisite design
which she wore attached to her wrist." It was caught and quickly
restored by Mr. Vanderkellen, Vice-Consul for Belgium; the very
man who, fourteen years before, in his official capacity, had
replied through the Foreign Office that the young Australian
singer then opening her career at Brussels was in every way
highly worthy of the favour of the Belgian Court, with which it
was proposed to honour her in a still greater degree than already
shown her by the Royal Family.</p>
<p>"The minute the carriage moved off there was a scramble for
flowers which had fallen to the ground and been trampled
underfoot. It did not matter that they were utterly destroyed;
they would recall the scene, and be envied exhibits in suburban
homes. The journey through the city was a triumphal progress.
Collins Street and Swanston Street were lined with people, who
overflowed the footpaths into the roadway, and the trams were
stopped. All the windows were occupied, and the cheering and
waving of handkerchiefs recalled the Melbourne of some recent
great occasions.* The carriage could only proceed at a snail's
pace."</p>
<p class="foot">[* These great occasions were the celebrations in
honour of the visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales to
proclaim the Commonwealth, and those to celebrate the British
successes at Ladysmith, Mafeking, etc.]</p>
<p>In Collins Street the members of the Stock Exchange came out
on the steps, and, waving their hats in the air, raised a cheer
that easily rang out above the din in the street. A little
farther on, when passing Allan's piano warehouse, where, during
the years of her happy girlhood, Melba had often attended for
music-lessons, a band played "Home, Sweet Home," and "Auld Lang
Syne," the opening bars of which led the people in the streets to
renewed outbursts of wildest cheering. Intensely moved, but
keeping her feelings under wonderful control, Melba rose in the
carriage and bowed over and over again. "Along the St. Kilda Road
groups of enthusiastic people cheered the distinguished
Melbournian, and in the Toorak Road large numbers of ladies, who
had been waiting patiently for hours, gave her most fervid
greeting." **</p>
<p class="foot">[** The foregoing description of Melba's arrival
is taken from the <i>Argus</i>, the great Conservative journal of
Australia.]</p>
<p>Throughout this unequalled welcome, Melba exhibited really
marvellous outward composure, hardly betraying by a tremor of the
lip or the moistening of an eye the intense emotion which was
rending her very soul. She smiled bravely through it all until
she reached Myoora, and there, in the privacy of her own room,
the prolonged tension of her moving home-coming was at length
relieved by the "fast-flowing current of her easy tears."</p>
<p>The late arrival of the steamer from Vancouver, her father's
illness, and the other exhausting conditions of her return,
necessitated a postponement of her first concert, a change for
which she publicly begged the indulgence of the people, so that
she might offer them her artistic best. Through the press she had
also made acknowledgment of her reception, concluding: "I am
indeed happy in finding so many warm-hearted friends on my return
to the country which I have been longing for many years to see
again." Entertainments in her honour by the Acting
Governor-General, Lord Tennyson, and the State Governor, General
Sir George Sydenham Clarke, and the Chief Justice of Victoria,
Sir John Madden, were the earliest organized; and later the Mayor
of Melbourne, Sir Samuel Gillott, gave a brilliant reception for
her, at which 2,000 representative citizens fought for the honour
of a place near her.</p>
<p>Before Melba had been in Australia many hours it became
apparent that the people, in their exuberant generosity, were
determined entirely to ignore her oft-repeated request that the
impression of her home-coming should not be disturbed by the
conventionalities of organized greetings, and receptions,
addresses, and fetes were arranged in bewildering numbers. One of
the most interesting of these gatherings was the demonstration by
her old school companions at the Presbyterian Ladies' College.
The pupils of the day, dressed in pure white, formed themselves
into a guard of honour, between whose lines the diva walked to
the strains of "See the Conquering Hero comes." The Rev. Dr.
Alexander Marshall led the singer to the platform, where she was
greeted by the leading divines of the Presbyterian Church. Two
golden medallions, set as a cloak-clasp, and representing the
badge of the college, were presented to Melba, together with an
address which said: "When you left us to go to Europe our hearts
and hopes went with you. Ever since your brilliant début all
Australians, and particularly your school chums, have read with
pride of your triumphs. We rejoice at the position you have
attained in the world of music, and also for the reputation you
have earned for Australia as a land of song, as instanced by the
numbers who, emulating you, have earned a hearing in the great
centres. From these and others who have met you we have heard of
your kindness and help, which recalled the same generous spirit
that characterized the Nellie Mitchell of the old schooldays."
Selections from different operas in which she had sung were
played throughout the afternoon, and in expressing her thanks,
Melba feelingly alluded to the occasion as the happiest day of
her life. When she left, the chair she had sat on and the pen she
had used were set aside, to be retained as souvenirs by the
college.</p>
<p>Another entertainment designed in her honour was a
<i>matinée</i> of "Sweet Nell of Old Drury," on September 25, by
the favourite Australian actress Miss Nellie Stewart. "Thousands
of people," said the <em>Leader</em>, "gathered in the vicinity
of the Princess's Theatre, in the hope of catching a glimpse of
Melba as she alighted from her carriage, while the building
itself was packed from floor to ceiling. The crowd in the street
cheered when Melba's carriage drew up at the door, and the prima
donna bowed her acknowledgments. When she entered the theatre the
orchestra played 'Auld Lang Syne,' and the vast audience stood up
to greet the world's Queen of Song. Two stage-boxes had been set
apart for the use of the distinguished visitor, and she occupied
them alternately during the performance, so as to be visible to
all sections of the house. The decorations were of wattle and
eucalyptus boughs, in which perched a magpie, the most typical of
Australian song-birds. At the close of the performance Melba went
behind the scenes to express her thanks and her appreciation. A
great crowd was waiting to see her departure, and the
demonstrations of some of her admirers were almost embarrassing
in their warmth."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX</h3>
<p class="quote">"She is one of those perplexing people to whom
the ordinary standards of criticism do not apply. The critic's
'metewand,' as William Morris would say, is either too long or
too short. She is at once the greatest of living artists and no
artist at all. As an exponent of vocal art she stands on a
pinnacle by herself. She is further removed from all possible
rivals than Joachim is among violinists, or Paderewski among
pianists. Her only equal in this one thing is Jean de Reszke, and
even he is not quite so perfect; even his consummate art is not
so entirely free from all trace of effort and premeditation as
hers."&mdash;<span class="aa">Alfred Kalisch</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Two</span> days later took place the most
trying public appearance of Melba's life&mdash;her first concert
before an Australian audience since she had won universal
fame.</p>
<p>Prior to the opening of the box-office for this initial
concert people had stood in the street all night so as to secure
a good place among the applicants, to whom the plan was opened at
nine o'clock in the morning&mdash;the prices being augmented to
four times the usual highest rates; an increase which was later
again advanced, when the front seats for the opera concerts were
priced at 3 guineas each.</p>
<p>Nearly three hours before the concert began crowds assembled
outside the Town Hall, and it required the assistance of a large
body of foot and mounted police to prevent serious interruption
of the traffic. Within the hall the audience, who assembled long
before the necessary time, waited in intense eagerness.</p>
<p>When Melba at length appeared, the effect was extraordinary.
The whole of the people rose in an instant, and broke into a wild
tumult of cheers. Hats, handkerchiefs, and programmes were waved
in delirious ardour; women, no less than the men, joined in the
roar of welcome, which was renewed again and again in what seemed
like a never-ending ovation. Melba stood in the centre of the
platform, looking taller than her wont in that hour of exquisite
triumph. Save for a single rope of pearls, her person was
unadorned by any of her wonderful jewels; none of the orders or
medals bestowed on her by the Sovereigns and Institutions of
England and Europe sparkled on her breast; she had come before
her own people in a gown of classic simplicity, a great yet a
pathetic figure in an unforgettable scene. The moments sped and
the enthusiasm continued. The smile on her face bore a trace of
sadness as she stood there, proud, erect, almost motionless. Then
she bowed her head, as though no longer able to face the strain
of this emotional ordeal; but the applause, instead of ceasing,
rang out with growing vigour. After a few seconds' pause, she
made a step forward, raised her hands to her lips, and in an
uncontrollable gesture spread her arms out to the impassioned
throng. Another and still greater burst of cheering rent the air.
Melba now seemed quite overwhelmed by the greeting, and there
were many who felt that it would surely be impossible for her to
sing. One moment of abandon on her part, and the concert would
have been impossible. Then she summoned up all her resolution,
realized that it was the moment for self-effacement, and
remembering that any weakness on her part meant the prolonging of
her father's illness, she rose with a superb effort to the
demands of the occasion, and sang as she had rarely sung
before.</p>
<p>When she had finished, the platform was littered with flowers,
and the cheers of the audience were long continued. After many
recalls, Melba sat down at the piano and, playing her own
accompaniment, sang "Home, Sweet Home." The new meaning of the
old song was realized in a remarkable manner by the audience, and
the applause that followed had in it something of a great
suppressed sob. Such were the circumstances under which Melba,
the famous artist, sang in the hall where years before, as an
amateur, she had made her first vocal appearance at a charity
entertainment. By the date of the second concert her father had
sufficiently recovered to attend, and when for her first encore
she sang "Comin' thro' the Rye," the old Scottish ballad which it
was known he had taught her in childhood, the effect was
electrical, and all eyes followed hers to the seat where her
happy and honoured parent sat.</p>
<p>For every possible hour of the succeeding days her delighted
compatriots arranged receptions and presentations, between which
she contrived to pay visits to the leading hospitals, to whose
funds she made most generous donations&mdash;a proceeding which
she repeated in all the other cities. During a visit to the
Children's Hospital in Adelaide a little sufferer presented her
with a small bead-basket that hung on his cot, and as she could
see that he valued it highly she was greatly pleased by the gift,
for which she gave him a sovereign in exchange. Two days later
she again drove to the hospital, taking with her some sweets,
toys, and a photograph for the boy. He was particularly
interested in the picture, and she asked him who it was. "You,"
he answered. "But who am I?" she questioned, thinking he might
not know her name. Instead of the name, the child answered: "The
greatest singer in the world"; and as she leant forward to kiss
the little patient's face, it was evident that she was deeply
touched by the child's spontaneous compliment.</p>
<p>A visit to the Melbourne Conservatorium was one of the
functions arranged for early October, and the words spoken by
Professor Marshall Hall, the unconventional principal, that day,
make in themselves an interesting record.</p>
<p>"Madame, we all of us, professor and students alike, feel that
it is very charming of you to pay us a visit in this our little
'Poets' Corner.' You may, perhaps, hardly any longer now
understand the singular sensations that pass through us artists,
dreaming our dreams in this remote, quiet, isolated nook of the
universe, when suddenly, like some northern comet, you flash
through our silent heaven, bespattering it with
brilliancy&mdash;flash, and are gone. You come to us like some
fairy princess of legend from the far romantic land of our secret
dreams and hopes, redolent with the perfumes of mysterious
flowers, shaken from the folds of your gown, yet quivering with
the frenzy of distant multitudes, stirred by your art, fraught
with fascination and strange power. You represent to us all the
possibility, the promise, the glamour of that rich imaginary
world which each one secretly in his heart of hearts dreams
attainable, if not by him- or her-self, at least by others more
gifted and, more lucky. And it is good for us, in this trite,
vulgar, prosaic modern world to now and again surrender ourselves
to such youthful sweet illusions; it is good that in the height
of success, fame, and triumph you should descend on us&mdash;</p>

<small>ADDRESS OF WELCOME FROM THE CONSERVATORIUM OF MUSIC,
MELBOURNE</small></p>
<br>
<p>a living image of that ideal phantasm which lurks deep in our
souls, and which represents our secret aspirations to all that is
free, beautiful, and joyous in life. With romantic delight we
regard your royal procession through the city, your military
guard of honour at our capitolium, the illuminations and
acclamations that greet you everywhere. For to us you represent
more than a particular person, charming though we acknowledge
that person to be: you represent an idea&mdash;nay, the idea to
which we have devoted our lives and energies, the idea of
art&mdash;art, the supreme manifestation of joyous strength. In
your triumph art triumphs; in your honourment art is honoured.
Your living presence has compelled this immature, partially
cultured, somewhat unintellectual city to dimly feel for a moment
the presence of that occult divine power which in higher states
of civilization is openly worshipped. And in these few inspired
moments of joyous enthusiasm which you have awakened their
dulled, unenlightened souls pay homage to, even though they are
unable to understand, those subtler, more lasting, more forceful
elements of life which become preponderant only in the rare
blossoming times of the world's history, which constitute the
'heroic,' and which art&mdash;art, the memory of
humanity&mdash;preserves in everlasting freshness, to remind us
in times of physical and intellectual weariness of the splendid
traditions of our race. Was it not in the days of Lodovico Sforza
that the conqueror, at the head of his army, rode into Milan, a
great general at one bridle rein, a great poet at the
other&mdash;himself the great intellectual force that knew how,
when, and where to utilize both? And you, madame, who come from
these historical seats of the ancient splendour, power, and
culture of the human race, seem to waft with you something of
their aroma, of their beauty, their traditions, in the presence
of which even modern, plebeian, democratic Melbourne becomes
animated, festive, and joyous. You are to us the ambassadress of
that far romantic ideal world of art, of beauty, and of
adventurous hope to which we vaguely aspire; as such we offer you
what humble welcome we can, and pray your acceptance of this
little memorial of our goodwill."</p>

<small>MELBA'S RETURN TO LILYDALE IN 1902</small></p>
<br>
<p>Close to the picturesque township of Lilydale is Cave Hill
Estate, a property belonging to Melba's father, and in this
neighbourhood, as mentioned earlier, the holidays of her
childhood were spent. On arrival at Brisbane she was asked if she
would visit the old place, and the answer she gave well indicated
how it stood in her memory. "Be sure I shall; and I am going to
ride a horse bareback, as I did long ago; and I am going to live
in my old home, no matter who are now there, and whether they ask
me or not." Her visit to this district was one of the most moving
of all the demonstrations planned in her honour. She stayed
overnight at St. Hubert's, a beautiful wine-growing estate then
owned by her father, whose health she called on all the party to
drink as they were being shown through the cellars, at the same
time giving him a jocular warning not to regale them with any of
his unsaleable vintages. Her reckless riding and driving had
often terrified the staidest of the local residents when they
knew her as a child, and old experiences were vividly recalled
when, without any warning, the light-hearted prima donna mounted
a dog-cart belonging to her brother, and drove round the
carriage-way at a dashing pace. From St. Hubert's to Lilydale,
Melba proceeded in a drag. All the houses along the road were
decorated, and the entrance to the town was spanned by a
triumphal arch. Hundreds of people had gone out along the road to
meet her, including the members of the local hunt club and other
horsemen, who acted as an escort for the remainder of the route.
Horses, carriages, bicycles, and people were all adorned with
rosettes and ribbons in blue and gold, the family colours of the
diva, whose path was strewn with flowers by school-children
wearing sashes also of blue and gold, who subsequently hailed her
with a song of welcome as she ascended the steps of the Rotunda,
where an address was presented by the President of the Shire (Mr.
J. Wallace). At Cave Hill Estate, where Mr. Mitchell gave a
monster picnic in honour of his daughter, the employés presented
another address, and in the evening, when she made her way to the
railway-station, she was escorted thither by a brass band and a
torchlight procession, the members of which gave embarrassing
demonstration of their unchanged affection for the
mischief-loving schoolgirl who had become a world-admired artist.
The <em>Lilydale Express</em>, in which the account of her
welcome was published, appeared in a gala dress, the paper being
of delicate blue and the printing in letters of gold.</p>
<p>In New South Wales the people were no less enthusiastic than
in her native Victoria, and the Governor (Admiral Sir Henry
Rawson), the members of the Ministry, the Mayor of Sydney (Mr.
Thomas Hughes), and the principal artists, all acclaimed her with
many compliments, and there was the same routine of fetes and
addresses. In the days of her artistic obscurity perhaps the
people of Sydney had been more ready than those of Melbourne to
appreciate the young student's talents. On her return they showed
their interest by establishing a financial record for the whole
world at her third concert, when she received the net sum of
£2,350 for her services, and this despite the fact that the
entrance barriers at one door had been torn down by a waiting
crowd who feared exclusion, and many of whose members were pushed
into the hall without the formality of payment.</p>
<p>Up to this time the highest remuneration ever paid to any
singer for a single evening's professional contributions was the
£2,000 ($10,000) given to Jenny Lind for her first concert in
America. The tickets for this latter occasion were sold by public
auction, after a term of sensational advertising engineered by
that prince of showmen Barnum, who was at that time Madame Lind's
manager. When Melba appeared in Sydney, the advertising tactics
which Barnum and his early contemporaries had so impudently
favoured, and which it was assumed must have been personally
distasteful to the reserved Swedish Nightingale, had become
hopelessly effete, and the business arrangements for the
Australian singer's concerts were carried out on formal and
conservative lines of unassailable dignity. Yet even under these
conditions, and in a comparatively small community, the
remarkable result just indicated was achieved.</p>
<p>In South Australia and Queensland the now familiar scenes were
repeated, the Governors and principal public men associating
themselves with the people's unrestrained ardour. Here a
characteristic incident may be recalled. The time of Melba's
visit was one when the whole of Australia was suffering from the
effects of a prolonged drought, and when driving near Oxley,
Queensland, one day she saw on a small "selection" (farm) three
cows in very poor condition; and on hearing that the owner was in
straitened circumstances, she had a quantity of bran and chaff
forwarded to him for the half-starved cattle.</p>
<p>Later on, when she more fully realized the hardships which the
shortage of water had entailed on thousands of small settlers,
Melba decided on a scheme for wider assistance, and in starting a
fund with a personal subscription of £200, said: "While
travelling through Australia by rail I have seen heartrending
proofs of the misery caused by the drought. I have seen with my
own eyes the brown, burnt paddocks extending for hundreds of
miles, with no vestige of grass left upon them. I have seen
starving sheep leaning against the fences, too weak to move, and
looking pitifully at the passing train, as if to say: 'Is there
no help for us?' I have seen the skeletons of cattle and sheep
dotting the paddocks, and the signs of desolation and starvation
everywhere. It is simply
appalling.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. I
have read the pathetic accounts of the suffering endured by the
settlers in the drought-stricken areas of Victoria, and I felt
that I must do something to help them. I decided to appeal to a
few of my friends in England and America, who happen to be blest
with wealth and influence, and I have to-day despatched messages
to about thirty people, most of whom live in London or New York,
asking them to send me something for the drought-stricken
Australians, whose terrible sufferings I myself have seen."
Melba's action and the warm-hearted motive that prompted it were
thoroughly appreciated by the public; but at a specially convened
meeting of the Council of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce a
sufficient number of members responded to formally express
disapproval of any appeal being made outside the
Commonwealth&mdash;a course which, they argued, might damage the
credit of Australia. England herself, and other great countries,
had on many occasions proudly accepted relief funds from other
nations in time of stress due to the ravages of fire or flood,
famine or earthquake; but Australia at this moment, as voiced by
the quorum in the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, was to rise
above&mdash;or sink below&mdash;the conditions of international
brotherhood. This disapproval of Melba's generous initiative
forced her to withdraw an appeal which she had believed could not
have met with other than universal endorsement, but her retreat
was covered with a dignity which enhanced still further her
reputation as a great personality. The Premier of the
Commonwealth, Sir Edmund Barton, in accepting the view of the
Chamber of Commerce, referred to the people's applause of Madame
Melba's motive, which was later discussed in the Victorian
Parliament in terms that must have been highly gratifying to the
Victorian singer, whose generosity was described in the House as
a byword among Australians.</p>
<p>From Australia Melba proceeded to New Zealand, and once again
found herself the heroine of a ceaseless round of complimentary
activities. The people marked her visit by an unending chain of
courtesies and kindnesses, and the magnificent scenery and
picturesque native villages made a great impression on the prima
donna, who had never before been in "the land of the long white
cloud." The most novel greeting extended to her was the welcome
at Auckland from the Maori chiefs and people. Clad in elaborate
dress, the representatives of all the surrounding <i>kaingas</i>
assembled before the great singer, and with the intricate
preliminaries of their ancient traditions began their acts of
homage. From among the tribal leaders the spokesman, in gala
costume of flax and feathers, and with many gestures of
deference, advanced towards Melba, and in soft-spoken Polynesian
assured her of their allegiance and love. He told her she was to
them as the sacred <i>korimako</i> (bell-bird), whose melodious
chime enthralled their demigods in the heavens and inspired their
<i>tohungas</i> on earth. At suitable intervals during the
recital of the felicitation the whole assemblage bent low in an
attitude of profound respect, and then, throwing their heads
back, broke into a chanting repetition of "Haere-mai! haere-mai!"
(Welcome! welcome!). On the conclusion of the chief's formal
oration, all the Maoris joined in a wild shout of "Kia-ora-koe!
kia-ora-koe!" (Long life to you! long life to you!), and they
laid at Melba's feet a number of curious and beautifully-wrought
offerings. These included an ancient nose flute, made from the
thigh-bone of a war captive, a small whalebone club, a
feather-adorned garment, some unique tapa mats, and a small
grotesque figure carved out of pounamo (New Zealand jade), and
representing Hei-tiki, the Adam of the Maori people.</p>
<p>As a final honour, the presiding chief hailed Melba as one of
their queens, and with much dignity presented her with the
feathers of the huia and white heron, the visible indications of
the high rank to which the Maoris had been pleased to exalt her.
In acknowledgment of her reception into the hearts of their
people, one of the natives gravely "rubbed noses" with Melba; and
as a finale to the interesting installation, the young men of the
party dashed into a weird, impressive measure known as the
<i>haka</i>, which in former days was a regular part of their war
ceremonials.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX</h3>
<p class="quote">"'Pleurez, pleurez, mes yeux!' Heureux les
publies, bien heureux les yeux qui pleureront, alors que Melba
chantera cette scène; et j'en conserve une impression
inoubliable."&mdash;<span class="aa">Jules Massenet</span>
(Paris, September 3, 1903).</p>
<p><span class="aa">On</span> returning to Europe after her regal
progress through Australia, Melba's first concern was for her
protégée, Miss Ada Sassoli, for whom she arranged a concert at
St. James's Hall, crowning her generous interest by singing
herself. The introduction proved an invaluable one to the young
harpist. The prices had been raised to the extreme concert limit
known in London, but, despite this fact, hundreds were unable to
obtain admission. The World, in commenting on the fact, remarked
that Melba alone had the power of stealing away the audience from
Covent Garden. The Australians in London marked the evening by
attending in a body to welcome her back from their native land,
and they presented her with what was described as the most
beautiful floral offering ever seen in London, to which was
attached a white moire scroll bearing the names of the donors in
letters of gold. It would be superfluous to describe the
enthusiasm of the audience on that 24th of June.</p>
<p>Melba was full of Australian reminiscences this season. On
arriving at the first railway-station in Victoria, on her journey
home, the earliest salutation she heard was from a man in the
crowd, who, recalling her native suburb, called out, "Hello,
Nellie! what price Richmond?" a familiarity which won easy
laughter from the singer, who was being received with many
honours. On another occasion she told how, after a classic number
at one of her Australian concerts, someone in the gallery called
out: "Don't put on any side, Nellie. Sing us 'Home, Sweet Home.'"
"And of course I did as I was told," added Melba, so often
described as the most unbending of imperious singers. In showing
the many beautiful gifts and addresses presented to her, she
dwelt most on a few uncut opals which had been pressed into her
hand by a strange woman, and the address of welcome from her
father's employés at Cave Hill Estate.</p>
<p>It would be a useless search to find new terms in which to
describe Melba's personal and professional successes throughout
the season, but they were certainly enhanced by the continued
favour of the King and Queen, who "commanded" her to Buckingham
Palace for the soiree given on July 6 to the President of the
French. Only about a hundred guests were bidden to this exclusive
gathering, and from the royal hosts and Monsieur Loubet she
received cordial compliments on her singing. King Edward himself
presenting her to the head of the French State.</p>
<p>In further commemoration of this visit of the President of the
French Republic, a gala performance, by command of the King, was
given at Covent Garden on Tuesday, July 7, and Melba once more
was honoured with a summons from His Majesty. She sang in the
second act of "Rigoletto" and in the second act of "Romeo and
Juliet," between which was given the second act of "Carmen," with
Calvé in the title-rôle. The floral decorations were magnificent,
but were mainly carried out with artificial flowers, as at the
gala performance in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee it
had been found that the odour of the natural blossoms rendered
the atmosphere painfully oppressive both for artists and
audience.</p>
<p>Two days later, Melba herself gave a superb party at her home
in Great Cumberland Place, at which she sang the Bach-Gounod "we
Maria" to the violin, harp, and organ accompaniment of Herr
Kubelik, Miss Ada Sassoli, and Mr. Landon Ronald. Signor Bonci,
Monsieur Plançon, and Miss Muriel Foster were among the others
who contributed to the programme. Profusions of pink
malmaisons&mdash;her favourite flowers&mdash;and roses were used
in the decoration of the house, and among the gallant men and
pretty women who revelled in the musical feast provided by the
hostess were Prince Francis of Teck, the Duchess of Devonshire,
the Duchess of Abercorn, the Duchess of Marlborough, Mrs. Arthur
Wilson and her beautiful daughter Muriel, Lord and Lady Savile,
Lady Maud Warrender, the Marquis de Soveral (Portuguese
Minister), Lord and Lady Chelsea, Lord Sandwich, Mr. Alfred de
Rothschild, Lord Hardwicke, Lady Cynthia Graham, Mrs. Arthur
Paget, Lady Lurgan, Sir Richard Bulkeley and Lady Magdalen
Bulkeley, Count Albert Mensdorff (the Austro-Hungarian
Ambassador), and many other personalities of the day.</p>
<p>Of her performances during the season everything that was
possible was said in the way of laudation, beginning with the
performance of "La Bohème," which was honoured by the presence of
the King and Queen, and of which the <i>Times</i> wrote
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>In October 1903, Melba began an extended concert tour of
Canada and the United States, on which she took her young
protégée, Miss Ada Sassoli, for her first Transatlantic
engagements, the other members of the company being Miss Llewela
Davies, Mr. Ellison Van Hoos, and Monsieur Charles Gilibert.
Although the tour was most enjoyable and successful, it was not
marked by anything very eventful. On November 2 she visited St.
Louis, then in the midst of activities preliminary to the great
Exposition. On being taken to view the grounds, Melba's first
comment was: "I like the hills rising above the main buildings on
the plain, and the cascades. And I am so glad to see you have not
filled up the little valleys and chopped down the old trees. They
will add so much to the charm of the Fair." When questioned at
the same time as to the production of "Parsifal" at the
Metropolitan Opera-House in New York, in defiance of Frau
Wagner's wishes, she replied: "I don't care to say much on what
is at the moment a vexed question, but I think opposition might
be appeased to some extent if 'Parsifal' were performed only on
Sunday. It is a truly religious work with a venerable tradition,
and certainly should be dealt with only in a spirit of profound
respect."</p>
<p>When taking a walk from her private car at the Santa Fé depot
in Wichita on the morning following her concert in that city, a
lady journalist endeavoured to interview her, and subsequently
told how easily the singer evaded all her questions. After many
queries had been deftly blocked, the interviewer said: "Where do
you live when not on the road?" "In a house," said Melba gravely;
and then the journalist abandoned the task and allowed herself to
be interviewed by the singer, who insisted on knowing the size,
population, commerce, politics, and surroundings of the city.</p>

<br>
<small>MELBA AS "HÉLÈNE"</small></p>
<br>
<p>Towards the end of the month, her appearance in Philadelphia
was seized on by twenty-six Australian students of the University
of Pennsylvania to give her assurance of their kind wishes and
esteem. She having temporarily deserted her house on wheels for
hotel accommodation, they waited on her at the Walton, and, after
presenting her with a beautiful bouquet, read a brief address in
which reference was made to her recent extraordinary welcome in
the land of their common birth. In December she took part in the
performance of "The Damnation of Faust" given at Boston to
celebrate the centenary of Berlioz, whose conception met with
unusually sympathetic treatment at her hands. Three weeks later
she closed her season in the same city, when she sang with the
incomparable Boston Symphony Orchestra prior to sailing for Monte
Carlo, where she was due to create the title-rôle in Saint-Saëns'
opera "Hélène."</p>
<p>Before leaving for America, Monsieur Saint-Saëns had told
Melba of the opera, that he had written it for her, and hoped she
would be able to sing at the <i>première</i>. In order to do
this, she at once sent to the United States and induced her
manager to cancel the latter half of her concert tour, which was
to run over January, February, and March, and pledged herself to
fill all the engagements during the ensuing season. Her only
chance to learn the rôle was while travelling in the train, yet
she entered into every detail of preparation with untiring
interest, and after the final rehearsal had the gratification of
hearing the distinguished composer say: "Madame Melba ne se
contente pas d'être une merveilleuse cantatrice et une admirable
artiste dramatique: elle ne joue pas, non! elle vit l'Hélène que
j'ai rêvée. Elle est l'héroine elle-même, toute, avec une force
d'expression, avec une charme, que je suis le premier à admirer,
mais pas le dernier: car, à coup sûr, elle y remportera un grand
succès personnel; et tous l'admireront comme je fais." Madame
Héglon and Monsieur Alvarez took the parts of Pallas and Paris
respectively, and after the public production the critics
endorsed Monsieur Saint-Saëns' estimate of Melba's work.</p>
<p>During this season at Monte Carlo, Melba resided at a private
villa lent her by the Countess of Wilton, and here Saint-Saëns
came on numerous occasions to help her with her study of
"Hélène." One day when the butler was absent from his post, the
door was answered by an untrained odd man, who admitted the
composer, but took no steps to announce him. Long after the time
at which she had expected Saint-Saëns, she heard someone playing
most beautifully, and, going to the drawing-room, she was
surprised to find him at the piano. "I'm tired of waiting, so I
decided to amuse myself," said he laughingly, as Melba apologized
for her servant's shortcomings.</p>

<br>
<small>MELBA IN PRIVATE LIFE</small></p>
<br>
<p>"Great composers," said Melba, "differ very much in their
talent for explaining exactly what they had in mind when writing
such and such an aria. One of my best characters, Mimi, was
interpreted to me by Puccini in Southern Italy, and he then
composed 'Madame Butterfly' for me, though events ultimately
shaped in such a way that I have not appeared in it yet. Monsieur
Saint-Saëns is a born teacher, and in going through 'Hélène' he
was most helpful, without checking my own inspiration unduly.
Unlike most Frenchmen, he is particularly sincere in his speech,
and resembles Marc Antony in calling himself 'a plain blunt man.'
I read 'Manon Lescaut' with Monsieur Massenet. You know his
setting is like a piece of Dresden china, whereas the same opera
by Puccini is passionate in its colouring. Monsieur Massenet is a
great teacher and a kind admirer of my work."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXI</h3>
<p class="quote">"One remembers Ben Jonson's phrase concerning
'flight.' Such a flight is Melba's, which seems to embrace the
perfect feeling of attempting to ascend the heights, of
attempting to descend to the depths, and all the way through of
determining that there should be no sort of eccentricity, no
sentiment of anything unconfirmed or not fully realized. She
makes no unessential effects of sound, slie never attempts to
make of a song more than the song contains, but she insistently
and most determinedly sacrifices every point in her absolute art
towards the fulfilment of those great things of which she is so
completely and utterly capable."&mdash;<span class="aa">Vernon
Blackburn</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">From</span> the Opera at Monte Carlo, Melba
made a quick change to the English provinces, where she was
engaged for a concert tour during March. April was spent in
Paris, mostly with modistes and milliners for the replenishing of
her private and professional wardrobe. Many treasured
possessions, including invaluable copies of "Aïda," "Rigoletto,"
"Faust," "Romeo and Juliet," "Hamlet," and "Lakmé," elaborately
marked by the composers Verdi, Gounod, Ambroise Thomas, and
Delibes, had been destroyed on the homeward voyage from Boston,
owing to the flooding of the <i>Saxonia's</i> hold. Later on, an
acquaintance happened to commend this steamer to her as being
very steady. "You touch a sore point," she said. "Don't mention
that steamer to me. My music, marked by the composers, was all
ruined on it through my trunks lying in sea-water in the flooded
hold. I lost my Lancret fan and many others, my furs, my
theatrical wardrobe, the result of years of trouble, and
everything else. The money loss alone was £8,000, for which the
company gave me £1,000 compensation. But the greatest loss was
outside what money could restore. I cried for ten days, and I
remember the big teardrops falling on my chest as I stood to have
the new frocks tried on."</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image34" id="Image34"></a><img alt=""
src="1401681h-images/Image34.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>MELBA AS "AÏDA"</small></p>
<br>
<p>In the midst of the rush and worry incidental to this extra
demand on her time, she found opportunity and energy to organize
personally a Queen's Hall concert, which she carried to a
triumphant issue on May 5, in aid of Queen Charlotte's Hospital.
Her first volunteer was Madame Milka Ternina, the distinguished
Wagnerian singer, whose work exercised great influence over her
Australian friend. Very soon afterwards she gave her services at
a Stafford House concert in aid of St. Mary's Church,
Whitechapel; and only a tew days later, once again appeared in
the cause of charity at the Lifeboat Saturday Fund concert in the
Queen's Hall, which was attended by the Prince and Princess of
Wales and the Duke and Duchess of Connaught. A feature of this
latter programme was a duet from Boito's "Mefistofele," in which
the prima donna was effectively joined by the talented amateur.
Lady Maud Warrender. In estimating the value of Melba's share in
these charities, it should be remembered that, had she given
these three concerts for her own benefit, she would probably have
netted nearly £2,000; while a single appearance at the Albert
Hall would be certain to bring her upwards of £1,000. In order
not to clash with her charitable efforts, she that year, as on
many other occasions, declined to give any public concerts
herself.</p>
<p>Although she has done so much for public charities, Melba's
disposition has always been to help individuals rather than
institutions; but this is not the time or place to discuss her
private benefactions, which are only known to a small group of
trusted friends, who during her lifetime at least are sure to
regard her strongly expressed wishes for privacy.</p>
<p>Her first appearance at Covent Garden for the season of 1904
was made in "Romeo and Juliet" on May 10, in the presence of the
Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales. There was little
fresh to be said about her now familiar vocal efforts, but her
increasing advance in dramatic realization caused the
<i>Times</i> to note "her often remarkable command of tender and
pathetic expression," while the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>
complimented her on the charm and sincerity of her acting.</p>
<p>Her home life was varied during this season by an extended
visit from two New Zealand cousins, the Misses Walker, to whose
entertainment she devoted unremitting thought. Among the most
interesting gatherings at her house were luncheon-parties to her
old colleagues Jean and Édouard de Reszke, to Dr. Saint-Saëns,
and Signor and Madame Puccini, at which numerous musical and
social celebrities were assembled.</p>
<p>The retirement of the de Reszkes from the operatic stage is a
matter on which Melba always speaks with infinite regret. "It is
sad that the work of such artists should ever close," she says.
"I miss them both more than I can say. On and off the stage they
were inspiring. Jean was the best of comrades, as well as the
greatest of artists. There will never be another like him. He
gave me the greatest artistic emotion of my life at our first
performance of "Romeo and Juliet,' and his first appearance in
'Tristan and Isolde' is one of my most glorious memories."</p>
<p>Private concert engagements, social obligations, and her
exacting routine at the Opera, still left her with some spare
time, and she sought rest in change of occupation, devoting her
leisure, as usual, to giving hints and lessons to young singers
just entering on their careers. When Miss Elizabeth Parkina was
studying in Paris, some of her fellow-students, who did not know
of the prima donna's friendship for the young American, said:
"Why, she is a second Melba; but of course she will never get a
chance while Melba has such power, for their voices are almost
alike." Melba heard her at different stages of her studies, was
entranced with her voice, and immediately got her a hearing at
Covent Garden, where she received a three-years' contract; and
when "Hélène" was produced for the first time in England on June
20, Miss Parkina appeared in the rôle of Venus. Monsieur Dalmores
and Madame Kirkby Lunn were the Paris and Pallas of the London
production. Miss Parkina also sang as Musetta in "La Bohème," and
everything that could be done to advance her social and artistic
success was done by Melba.</p>
<p>The visit to London, during June, of the Archduke Franz
Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, afforded another
opportunity to the King and Queen to honour Melba, whom they
commanded to Buckingham Palace to sing for their illustrious
guest. Their Majesties made the occasion further memorable for
her by conferring on her the Order of Science, Art, and Music,
which the Queen pinned on her breast.</p>
<p>They had also paid her the compliment of having brought to the
palace the gramophone records of "Caro Nome," "Sweet Bird," "Ah,
fors' è lui," and the Mad Scene from "Lucia," which she had made
for her father in Australia, and which were not allowed to be
sold, although she was afterwards persuaded to permit the sale of
later records.</p>
<p>Near the close of July, Melba undertook the distribution of
prizes in connection with the annual awards of the Royal Academy
of Music, and marked the occasion by herself giving two new
prizes, the largest at the institution, £25 each, for five years
in succession, to the soprano and contralto students who should
show the greatest proficiency in ballad-singing.</p>
<p>Having completed some further provincial engagements, Melba,
with her New Zealand cousins, left for a holiday trip on the
Continent. None but a constitution of unique vigour could have
gone through such a succession of work as she had compassed in
the preceding twelve months. Her respite from professional
activities was, however, marred by a most unfortunate incident.
While driving in Paris, a feeble old man who unexpectedly stepped
into the roadway was knocked down and killed by her automobile;
the lamentable occurrence reducing Melba to a state of physical
prostration. Her chauffeur was exonerated from blame, and such
amends as money could make were Cjuickly placed at the disposal
of the bereaved family; but Melba's nerves were so shattered by
the fatality that she became ill, and cancelled all her social
and professional engagements for the ensuing weeks.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII</h3>
<p class="quote">"If only the angels in heaven sing as Melba does
on earth!"&mdash;<span class="aa">Ludovic Halévy</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Owing</span> to her enforced departure for
America, Melba was unable to enjoy the honour of singing at the
royal concert given by the King and Queen at Windsor Castle on
November 18, to celebrate the visit to England of the late King
Carlos and Queen Amélie of Portugal.</p>
<p>Even during the busy days of preparation incidental to this
Transatlantic tour, she found it impossible to free herself from
the sad impression left by the lamentable motor accident in
Paris, by which a fellow-creature had lost his life; and her
health and spirits continued to suffer through brooding over the
unhappy event. These conditions were especially apparent to the
members of her party on the westward journey to New York, and
almost immediately on her arrival in the States she fell a victim
to the rigours of an unusually severe winter. By a wonderful
effort, and against the imperative injunction of her physicians,
she contrived to appear in a single performance ("La Bohème") at
the Metropolitan Opera-House, and the next day found her
seriously ill with pneumonia and laryngitis. For days she lay in
a dangerous state at the Waldorf Astoria, her condition being
such that it was at length decided to cancel the remainder of her
engagements, running from December to March. The gravity of this
step, especially for her company, for whom she was doubly anxious
to make good the dates she had forfeited the previous season in
order to repair to Monte Carlo for the production of "Hélène,"
worried her greatly. Seriously ill, unable to see her friends,
obliged to disappoint the public, and compelled, even under the
generous conditions with which she always treats her supporting
artists, to entail certain disabilities on them, the position was
a most trying one for Melba. Christmas was at hand, a season
which she always honours with all the old-fashioned customs, but
which she must now celebrate on a sick-bed in a public hotel.
This circumstance in itself intensified her dejection.</p>
<p>The opportune and cheering presence of her son was probably
the means of saving her life; and once the crisis had been
passed, she was greatly pleased by the messages of inquiry and
good-will that came to her from all parts of the world, and by
the remarkably considerate attentions of the American public.
Apart from the kindnesses of personal friends, there were
countless gifts of exquisite flowers, fruits, and other things
from people whom she had never met, who only knew her through the
medium of her art. Her buoyant constitution quickly responded to
the call for her convalescence, but even before she was in any
condition for such an ordeal she announced her intention to
resume the tour, although warned to desist, owing to the amount
of travelling it would entail. She was not able to fill in her
limited number of engagements at the Metropolitan Opera-House,
New York, where her single appearance in December had attracted
an overflowing audience; but at the time of her departure from
America, at the end of March, she had the satisfaction of
completing one of the most successful concert tours of her whole
experience.</p>
<p>An interesting incident of this tour was the return of
Mademoiselle Elizabeth Parkina to her home, Kansas City, as a
professional singer. It was through Melba she had left there, and
it was through her&mdash;as a member of her company&mdash;that
she returned. During the closing term of Mademoiselle Parkina's
school-days she had sung the duet "Per Valli, per Boschi," with
one of her companions; when she next sang it to a Kansas City
audience on January 5, 1905, it was with the Queen of Song as a
colleague. In addition to this kindness, Melba also played the
accompaniment for her protégée's first number, and did everything
to make the home-coming memorable for the young singer, who said:
"Just think of it! It is only a few years since I first heard
her, and that was the deciding point for me. I was up in the
gallery when she then sang in this city, and I was immediately
overwhelmed with a longing to become a singer myself. I returned
home enchanted and despairing, but on the request of a friend she
agreed to hear me. She was kindness itself, and whatever success
I have made I owe entirely to her. She first made me realize what
singing meant, and then she helped me in every way. She has been
most gracious and lovely to her protégée, and the Kansas City
people, who were ever mad about her singing, now love her for her
goodness to me as well. What a home-coming for me! We sang to a
ten thousand dollar house, and everything was just sweet."</p>
<p>Before leaving New York, Melba received a cable from the
Prince of Wales asking her services for the Union Jack Club
concert which he had undertaken to organize. She was naturally
honoured and delighted to have any opportunity to show in some
degree her appreciation of the endless kindnesses which His Royal
Highness and all the members of his house had showered on her
throughout her career, and her reply was not only an offer to
sing, but her warm assurance of help in every way.</p>
<p>On arrival at Liverpool, newspaper representatives were in
waiting to get a word from her, and she made her usual efforts to
escape from the ordeal of interviewing. "Our steamer has not been
wrecked, as you see; I have not been in any railway accidents; I
have had no hairbreadth escapes from murder; and my jewels have
not been stolen&mdash;no, not even once. At least, they were safe
a few minutes ago," she laughed, and continued: "So you see I am
a most unsatisfactory prima donna. At Salt Lake City my private
car was side-tracked for some time in the yard during shunting
operations, and all the while the huge bell on one of the
locomotives clanged incessantly. Unable to bear it longer, I
looked out of the window, and shook my hand at the driver in
charge. 'Give me passes for to-night, and I'll quit ringing,' he
said. Of course he got the passes, and I got a little peace. That
is the only incident."</p>
<p>Her first appearance for the London season was at the Albert
Hall for the Prince's Union Jack Club concert, which His Royal
Highness steered to most brilliant success. The King was present
with a large party, including His Majesty's brother (the Duke of
Connaught), his three sisters (Princess Christian, the Duchess of
Argyll, and Princess Henry of Battenberg), and several of the
younger royalties. The Prince and Princess occupied their own
box, and the audience included a vast gathering of notable
people, considerable attention being given to the team of
Australian cricketers who were present as the guests of the royal
director. Owing to the illness with which Melba had been stricken
in America, there was a note of unusual fervour in the welcome
extended to her on her appearance at this entertainment, designed
as a tribute to the devotion of the people of His Majesty's
dominions beyond the seas, of whom she is the most famous unit.
In the interval the Prince of Wales sent for her, and in the most
gracious of grateful terms congratulated and thanked the prima
donna for her invaluable co-operation, and at the same time she
was also honoured by the personal thanks of His Majesty the
King.</p>
<p>A few days later she resumed her place at Covent Garden in
"Traviata," the brilliancy and size of the audience and the
display of diamonds being in accordance with the conditions now
accepted as typical of a "Melba night." All the cheaper seats
were sold on the day her return was advertised, and stalls were
disposed of at a high premium by the West End booking-offices.
The Duke and Duchess of Fife and Prince Francis of Teck were
among the well-known people present, but the one individual in
the throng surest to spur Melba on to her best efforts was Madame
Patti, who had herself so often triumphed as Violetta. Mr. E. A.
Baughan, in describing again the unique timbre of Melba's voice,
and in noticing her ever-growing sense of drama, said after this
performance: "Sometimes I wish she would not act at all, but just
sing. In the stress of emotion the shining surface of her voice
is broken up and troubled. She is no longer the Melba of the
silver voice. So many singers can give us emotion, so few the
evenness of Melba's production, an evenness as of perfectly
matched pearls."</p>
<p>For the celebration of her birthday on May 19, Melba attended
a dinner-party planned in her honour by Lady Molesworth, and then
went on to her residence in Great Cumberland Place, where she
gave a musical party followed by a dance. The beautiful women who
were her guests that evening made a remarkable picture in
themselves, for there were present the Duchess of Sutherland,
Mrs. Wilhe James, Mrs. George Cornwallis West, Lady Norris, Mrs.
George Keppel, Lady Kilmorey, the Countess de Grey, Lady
Colebrooke, and Miss Muriel Wilson.</p>
<p>The musical programme was contributed by Monsieur Gilibert,
Mr. Mark Hambourg, and Mischa Elman, a Russian lad then all but
unknown in London, whose juvenile appearance in a sailor suit
seemed distinctly at variance with the maturity of his art. At
the suggestion of Lady de Grey, Melba, who had already sung
twice, closed the programme with "Good-Bye," which she sang to
the accompaniment of the composer, Signor Tosti, with such
feeling and beauty of vocalization that she held the guests
spell-bound.</p>
<p>She gave her voice and art in the services of charity on June
5, when she sang at Stafford House for the Cripples' Guild of the
Potteries, and the following day she was called to Buckingham
Palace to delight by her song the King of Spain, who was then the
guest of the King and Queen. The young Sovereign of the
peninsular kingdom expressed himself as enchanted by her singing,
and seeking an opportunity to personally thank and compliment
her, he asked: "How is it we have not been favoured with a visit?
Why have you never been to Spain?" "Because, sir, nobody has ever
asked me," she smilingly answered. Immediately His Majesty bowed,
and in gallant accents said: "Then, madam, I ask you now," an
invitation which she assured the young monarch she would speedily
accept.</p>
<p>For the gala performance in honour of the King of Spain,
Melba, who by this time had well earned the sobriquet of Court
Singer, was again commanded by King Edward. Her activity spread
itself in many directions, and towards the end of June she
assisted in organizing a concert at Lord Spencer's residence to
provide a young contralto protégée, Miss Bingham Hall, from
Bristol, with funds for a period of Continental tuition.</p>
<p>In her rôle as honorary teacher, Melba had already given
invaluable help with suggestions and lessons, and she
supplemented these kindnesses by playing the accompaniments at
the Spencer House concert, thus helping to insure a handsome
monetary balance for Miss Bingham Hall.</p>
<p>Between-while she sang at the usual number of private
concerts, receiving from Mr. W. Astor 1,000 guineas for four
numbers contributed in the music-room of stately Cliveden. Owing
to requests received from all quarters, and especially from
teachers and students, who heard in her gramophone records an
admirable medium for lessons in phrasing, enunciation, and
breathing, Melba had now agreed that these records should be
placed on sale, and in discussing the possibility of passing on
the voice from one generation to another, she said: "Only think
how extremely interesting it would be for me to be able to go to
the British Museum and hear Jenny Lind sing the air from Mozart's
'Il Re Pastore,' with violin accompaniment by Joachim. I
frequently sing this number myself to the accompaniment of the
famous violinist. He has presented me with the cadenza which he
arranged for Jenny Lind, and I always use it."</p>
<p>By July 12 all arrangements were complete for a <i>matinée</i>
given on that date at Covent Garden as a complimentary farewell
to Mademoiselle Mathilde Bauermeister, who after thirty years'
service had decided to retire from the operatic stage, and who
had been fortunate in winning the friendship of Melba, who
planned the whole entertainment. An immense audience responded to
the call of the prima donna, who was able to hand over upwards of
£1,200 to the retiring singer. The chief item on the programme of
that day was a scene from "Romeo and Juliet," in which the
bénéficiaire was associated with Melba and Dalmores, who sang the
title-rôles. When the curtain fell on this selection, in which
Mademoiselle Bauermeister as the nurse had repeated her familiar
success, there was a display of great enthusiasm, and the stage
was covered with flowers offered to the heroine of the day.
Despite her emotion. Mademoiselle Bauermeister contrived to say:
"My dear friends&mdash;for surely I may call you so after
to-day's kindness&mdash;I feel the time has come for me to make
room for younger artists, and my tears stop me at the thought of
bidding you 'Good-bye.' I have been very happy here for a great
number of years, and in my little way I have always tried to do
my best. This tribute of to-day could not have been mine were it
not for my generous friend Madame Melba, and I wish you would
please call her out." The audience acted on the suggestion, and
when Mademoiselle Bauermeister advanced to meet the Australian
cantatrice, and, smiling through her grateful tears, grasped the
singer's hand, the theatre rang with applause, and many eyes were
dim with the sentiment of the hour, not the least affected being
Melba.</p>
<p>Speaking later on to a <em>Daily News</em> representative,
Mademoiselle Bauermeister said: "I can't realize that I shall
never again go back to Covent Garden, where I know every inch of
the stage, every knot, every nail, in the boards. Then, the
thought of my farewell is so stupefying. The theatre was packed,
and all gave their services, including my sweet Melba, who got it
up. Isn't she wonderful? It isn't only that she has the sweet
voice of an angel&mdash;she has the heart of an angel, too. She
wasn't well, and of course I wrote and told her on no account was
she to sing. But she insisted on appearing, and sang divinely.
Next day she had to cancel her engagement for the Opera; so you
see she sang for me for nothing, and then abstained from singing
at a great loss to herself. But that dear woman always thinks
first of others. She is so thoughtful. My sister, who lives with
me, and watches over my interests like a mother, was in a box at
my farewell, and was so overcome by everybody's kindness that she
burst into tears. Melba saw her from the stage, and sent someone
round with a message telling her not to be such a little fool. My
sister said that kept her up better than anything else could have
clone. Wasn't it sweet of Melba to think of her? She is one of
the best and dearest creatures on earth. And, do you know, I am
tremendously proud of a prophecy I uttered about her. Before her
London début, and after her first rehearsal. Sir Augustus Harris
asked me what I thought of her voice. 'She has gold in her
voice,' I answered, 'and she will put gold in your pockets.' "The
season closed with "La Bohème," in which a great audience,
including Her Majesty the Queen, took leave of the reigning
favourite.</p>
<p>Early in August she sang at Blackpool, an engagement she had
filled for several seasons partly out of compliment to the
conductor, Mr. Landon Ronald, a friend and artistic comrade since
the early days of her career. So great was the crowd to hear her
that the ordinary traffic arrangements were interrupted some
hours before the concert began, and the welcome extended her by
the audience exceeded anything previously known there.</p>
<p>At the Blackpool concert, Melba had come on the platform to
sing an encore number, and Mr. Ronald played over the opening
bars in the original key, which was about four notes too low for
the prima donna. She was, of course, unable to proceed, and the
accompanist in a meditative mood repeated the introduction
without noticing his error. Any average singer would have quietly
approached the piano, and in a whisper reminded him of his
delinquency; but Melba, fully alive to the humour of the
situation&mdash;for the song was one of his own
compositions&mdash;looked at him in amused surprise, and called
out in bell-like tones that could be heard clearly in every part
of the hall: "My dear sir, you are in the wrong key; I am not a
contralto"&mdash;a frank correction which greatly entertained the
audience. Recalling his earliest experiences with the prima
donna, Mr. Lanclon Ronald says:</p>
<p>"The first time that I ever met Madame Melba was during the
performance of 'Faust' at Covent Garden Theatre, when I was
fulfilling the duties of <i>maestro al piano</i> in 1891.</p>
<p>"On the night following I was told that the great singer
required someone to come to her hotel to study Massenet's opera
'Manon' with her, and that I was to be there at ten o'clock in
the morning. I had never heard this work, nor did I know a note
of the music; but, having obtained a copy of the vocal score, I
sat up all night to study it, I arrived at Madame Melba's
apartment at ten next morning, knowing the work practically by
heart. I had scarcely rehearsed a half-hour with her before she
very kindly became enthusiastic, and as I left her she said:
'Remember that from now you are Melba's accompanist everywhere.'
From that day to this, no one else has ever played for her in
public or in private, excepting on the rare occasions when I have
been unable to do so.</p>
<p>"Her splendid friendship for me from the outset of my career
helped me in a manner which it is impossible for me to describe,
and remains to-day one of my most treasured possessions."</p>
<p>On October 5 she was back at Covent Garden for the autumn
season, opening in "La Bohème," which was interesting for the
introduction of a new Musetta, Signorina Emma Trentini, a
'<i>petite</i> Italian who at once became a protégée of Melba's
and a favourite with the public. The conductor of the
evening.</p>
<p>Signor Mugnone, also made a most favourable impression. The
Prince and Princess of Wales, Prince Alexander of Teck, and many
other distinguished people, were among the audience. Considerably
reduced rates of tariff prevailed on all except "Melba nights,"
but for her appearances the prices were the same as during the
summer season; indeed, in the case of the back rows of the
amphitheatre they were still higher. Yet, in spite of this, so
many were unable to gain admission that the same bill had to be
repeated a couple of nights later. It was well known that if
Melba had consulted her personal wishes she would not have sung
during this autumn Opera term, but she felt that her fullest and
friendliest co-operation was due to the public and the management
in their endeavour to make grand opera a permanent institution in
London.</p>
<p>Between her appearances in opera, one of the engagements Melba
fulfilled was at the Bristol Festival in October, during which
she was the guest of the Duke and Duchess of Beaufort at
Badminton. The rates of admission had been raised for the only
evening of her appearance, but hundreds were disappointed, as the
great hall was not large enough to accommodate all who wanted to
hear her, and the whole of the tickets were sold before the
festival opened.</p>
<p>By command of the King, Melba sang at Windsor Castle on
November 17, at the party given by His Majesty and the Queen in
honour of the King and Queen of Greece and Prince and Princess
Nicholas of Greece. A few days later, Queen Alexandra took her
illustrious guests to hear the Australian prima donna in "Faust,"
which she then for the first time in England sang in the Italian
tongue.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding her many engagements, she found time to
organize an entertainment at Covent Garden in aid of the families
rendered destitute by the earthquake in Calabria. Although
circumstances compelled her to give the concert on a Sunday
evening&mdash;November 19&mdash;her influence and popularity were
sufficient to pack the house, the Italian and Russian Ambassadors
being among the notables present, and she was enabled to remit
£1,000 to the stricken families.</p>
<p>Distress, with numerous indications of still harder conditions
pending, was apparent among the poorest of the East End workers
even in the early autumn, and Melba showed her sympathy with the
destitute of her own race by arranging to give a concert on their
behalf. Before the preliminaries were far advanced, the opening
of the Queen's Fund for the same purpose was announced; so Melba
abandoned the concert scheme, and sent instead a
donation&mdash;£600&mdash;to the relief treasury which Her
Majesty had so magnanimously inaugurated.</p>
<p>She also crowded into the autumn another concert tour with Mr.
Percy Harrison, and early in December returned to Bristol, where
she sang at a performance initiated by the Duchess of Beaufort
for the Lifeboat Saturday Fund. Gounod's "Faust" was drawn on for
the programme, and Mr. Charles Manners was the Mephistopheles of
the occasion.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII</h3>
<p class="quote" align="center">"La divine
Melba."&mdash;<span class="aa">Pablo de Sarasate</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">Early</span> in 1906, Melba paid a visit to
Spain, and one of the first compliments she received was an
invitation from His Majesty King Alfonso to attend the wedding of
his sister. Her Royal Highness the Infanta Maria Teresa. Wherever
she went she was greeted with the greatest cordiality by the
people, and at Malaga, where she made a holiday sojourn of some
weeks, every conceivable compliment was devised in her honour. A
bull-fight was improvised for her entertainment, but not before
the prima donna had exacted a promise that there should be no
gore in the exhibition. These conditions were faithfully carried
out, and Melba expressed herself as sure that no ordinary contest
could have been half so interesting as the bloodless fight
planned for her benefit. The air of this picturesque resort had a
most recuperative effect on her health, and she was able to enter
into all the amusements of the place, to the delight of the
residents. Before leaving Malaga she elected to give a charity
concert there, a decision which greatly impressed the people of
the town. For days prior to this event there was much excitement
over Melba's expected appearance, and on the evening of the
concert unusual homage was paid her. A carpet woven out of
trailing foliage, in which gorgeous blooms were effectively
intertwined, was spread for her to walk on from her carriage to
the hall&mdash;a compliment usually reserved for the Royal
Family&mdash;and within the building the decorations were
remarkable. Over two hundred families had assisted in the
organization of the concert, and in the audience they sat with as
many bouquets, which at an appropriate moment they hurled at her
feet, until the stage looked like a great floral embankment.
Garlands of flowers were stretched from the orchestra to the
gallery, where a number of white doves were released from floral
cages, and then in graceful flight circled through the auditorium
before eventually flying on to the stage, where one of them
perched on Melba's shoulder, to the manifest gratification of
those present.</p>
<p>On coming to London in early May, she heard that the
distinguished centenarian Manuel Garcia, to whom the singing
world owes so much, was in weaker health, and, thinking it might
cheer him, she offered to call and sing for him at his home in
Cricklewood. In his own still clear handwriting he replied:</p>
<br>
<p>"<span class="aa">Madame</span>,</p>
<p>"If it will be agreeable to you to come here on Sunday, I
shall be honoured by receiving you. I look upon your offer to
sing for me as a special favour. I should have wished to be at
the piano to accompany you, but that is impossible. Will you
therefore arrange about that? Believe, madame, in the respectful
homage of your servant,</p>
<p align="right">"<span class="aa">M.
Garcia</span>."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>For June, July, and August, Melba made her summer residence at
Coombe Cottage, Kingston Hill, which she rented for this term
from Lord and Lady Charles Beresford. The house itself, which was
built by the Glynn family, had many interesting associations. The
Empress Eugénie once occupied it, and during her tenancy
entertained there the late Queen Victoria; and within its walls
the Glynns and Mills, the Barings and Rothschilds, have often
settled some great financial coup. The interesting history of the
building was not the least of its charms for the prima donna. It
was rather an odd circumstance, too, that her then landlord
should be the gallant Admiral who in 1887 had been the spokesman
for the small coterie of musical enthusiasts who induced Augustus
Harris to enter on the operatic enterprise of which she
ultimately became the leading figure; and also that Lady Charles
had been present at her Covent Garden début.</p>
<p>During her residence at the cottage, one of her favourite
walks was to the point where, according to local tradition. King
Henry VIII. had watched impatiently for the hoisting of the flag
which was to tell him that Anne Boleyn had been beheaded on Tower
Hill. Whenever Melba allows herself to drift into a sceptical
mood, she always bases her doubts on what she considers the
apparent injustice of human affairs&mdash;the weight of the yoke
too often placed round the necks of those whose burden should be
of the lightest, according to poor human estimate.</p>
<p>During one of these discussions a visitor expressed her belief
that heaven meant the conferring on the individual of the right
to spend the hereafter in the period and the character of his or
her choice. The prima donna, who has always taken a great
interest in the tragedy of Anne Boleyn, interjected: "Well, I
shall elect to live in the time of Henry VIII., and I shall
champion the cause of poor Anne, for Henry was a fiend." Then,
pondering for a moment or two, the earnest look on her face gave
way to a smile of humour, and she added: "No, that won't be my
selection, after all. I should prefer to live in the time of
Louis XV., and, let me see, who would I like to be? Yes, I shall
be the King, Louis himself."</p>
<p>Old records show that in London the third week of May is
almost invariably accompanied by blighting east winds, and so it
generally happens that Melba has a distressing cold on the
anniversary of her birthday, May 19. The usual conditions
asserted themselves in 1906, and she was recovering from one of
these attacks when she had another disagreeable experience. She
was announced to sing in "Rigoletto" at Covent Garden, and, in
accordance with her usual custom, left Coombe Cottage in her
automobile for the opera-house. Before she had proceeded far the
vehicle broke down in a quiet country lane that leads to New
Maiden village. Every minute was of value. No conveyance was in
sight, and no residence near enough to be of any use in the
trying situation. Melba, whose punctuality is one of her strong
points, was soon allowing her imagination to portray all the
difficulties which her unaccountable absence would create at
Covent Garden, and would even have welcomed the protection of any
tramp, so that her chauffeur might be free to go in search of
assistance. After what seemed an interminable wait, a local
butcher's cart came in sight, and she hailed it as though it were
a modern Pharaoh's chariot. After brief preliminaries, the driver
agreed to take her to the Maiden Station, whence she could travel
by train to London, and it was only when he received a sovereign
for his trouble that he inquired as to the identity of his fare.
The drive on the exposed seat of the butcher's cart, and in
raiment not selected for outside excursions, renewed Melba's
cold, and as a reward for her plucky effort to keep faith with
the public she was unable to sing at Covent Garden during the
following two weeks. Reference to the diva's punctuality recalls
a little anecdote concerning Madame Bemberg. The prima donna is a
frequent guest at the home of Madame Bemberg in Paris, where the
hostess once deftly turned a joke on a latecomer against the
punctual Melba by explaining that, to avoid a contretemps in her
case, she always named half an hour ahead of time to her, or else
the prima donna would arrive in time to do the lighting up.</p>
<p>A splendid physique, which an eminent New York doctor declared
to be more perfect than that of any other woman patient he had
ever had, gives Melba unusual powers of recuperation, and before
the season was far advanced she was singing with greater beauty
of tone, greater facility, than ever before in her life. On July
7, when "Traviata" was given for the first time that season, even
the critics and other connoisseurs entirely familiar with her
best work described her singing as a revelation. The scene of
enthusiasm after the first act was one almost unprecedented at
Covent Garden, and the criticisms of the opera were an emphatic
endorsement of the people's opinion as voiced in the great
ovation. The <i>Times</i>, in its notice of the "brilliant
performance," said: "In spite of its familiarity, Madame Melba's
Violetta always takes us by surprise every time we hear it. For
it is surprising as well as refreshing to hear
<em>coloratura</em> sung nowadays as she sings it; it all comes
pouring out with amazing spontaneity and that splendid sense of
enjoyment which makes one feel that here, at any rate,
<em>coloratura</em> is not an artificial product forced by the
singing-teacher for the mere caprice of the operatic composer,
but the natural expression of the person who is singing. Madame
Melba is, in fact, the link that connects the twentieth century
with the golden age of singing."</p>
<p>The following week she created equal surprise by the increased
beauty of her always beautiful Marguerite, the force of her
acting in the death-scene of Valentine creating a profound
impression on an audience already enchanted by the dawn-like
freshness of her voice and its <i>émission insolente</i>. Opera
circles were delighted over the ever-growing success of their
favourite, and her new powers were on one occasion being
discussed by a number of well-known amateurs, when Dr. Milsom
Rees, the eminent throat specialist, said: "I at least am not
surprised, and I shall look for greater perfection in her singing
for a long time to come. The formation of the throat is as
magnificent as ever, and the vocal cords are in a better
condition than I have ever seen them. As long as Madame Melba
keeps in good health, so long will her vocal conditions remain as
at present, if not even in an improved state for the next ten
years."</p>
<p>But perhaps no opinion given to the public during the year
could have been more interesting than that contributed to the
children's page of a weekly journal by Hilda May Campbell, the
little daughter of the brilliant pastor of the City Temple, who
said: "When I am grown up, when that far-distant day arrives, I
want above all things to be a singer. Singing to me is just the
loveliest thing in the world. I went some time ago to hear Madame
Melba. I think she is superb. She was singing in 'La Bohème.' My
seat was far away back in the opera-house. The stage was such a
long way off that it looked like an animated picture; but when
the beautiful strains of her exquisite voice floated across the
vast space, one felt very near to everything sweet and good and
beautiful."</p>
<p>At the height of the season one of Melba's old women
pensioners set out from Hammersmith with the intention of walking
to the singer's home near the Marble Arch. At Hyde Park Corner
her energy gave out, and she went inside the park railings, and
remained there for nearly three hours, in the belief, as she
afterwards related, that she would surely see her benefactor
drive by. She was doomed to disappointment, and after her long
vigil was enabled to get home in a 'bus through the kindness of a
stranger. When Melba subsequently heard the old woman describe
her struggle and her disappointment, she said: "You poor old
silly! why didn't you let me know, and I'd have sent my motor for
you?"</p>
<p>Another incident of this season relates to an elderly
Scotchwoman who one day called with her daughter, who was engaged
in some business in the City, but who was believed to have a
voice of uncommon beauty. Melba, whose interest in lovely voices
and their development amounts almost to a passion, received the
callers with her usual kindness. "What is the quality of your
voice?" she asked, and both replied timidly: "Mezzo-soprano, I
think." Melba sat down at the piano and ran through some suitable
scales; then, finding the girl's voice responsive, she played
higher and higher, until she found the novice singing the top D
with a purity and ease comparable with her own. A song or two
were tried, with the same result. Jumping up in assumed gravity,
the diva exclaimed to a friend who was present: "Ah ha! at last I
have found my hated rival." Then, turning to the girl, she said:
"Why, you have a most wonderful voice. You must begin to study at
once. You have music, temperament, intelligence, everything
necessary for a great career. You must go abroad." The mother
interrupted: "We have no means, and I am sure her father would
not like that." "Oh, we'll get the means somehow," Melba replied.
"She must go. Tell her father I said so." And then the woman, to
whom Melba had already explained that they had the common tie of
Scottish nationality, mildly responded: "But I don't think he
would know who you are, ma'am." "More shame to him," laughed
Melba, "and I a Scotchwoman, too!" But the father proved
obdurate, anyhow, and the girl, who might have become a famous
singer, continues at the quieter, perhaps happier, vocation of
"something in the City."</p>
<p>On the last night of the season it is not unusual for the
audience and the artists to manifest an exuberant
unconventionality, such as they would not dream of showing on
ordinary occasions. "La Bohème" was set down for the final
performance of this particular season, and among the occupants of
the front stalls was Paolo Tosti, who had provided himself with
an elaborate false moustache, which he stuck on his lip and
waggled from side to side with grotesque effect whenever the
business of the scene compelled Melba to turn her head in his
direction. This trick of Tosti's made it difficult for the prima
donna to maintain the pathetic note in the portrayal of Mimi,
especially in the Death Scene&mdash;a difficulty greatly
intensified when Enrico Caruso, while looking the picture of
great mental anguish, contrived to pour into her ear exclamations
and jokes of the most mirth-provoking character. Caruso's love of
fun never deserts him, and since the days of their first artistic
association at Monte Carlo, Melba, who has unbounded admiration
for his beautiful voice, has always found him a genial
comrade.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV</h3>
<p class="quote">"Que célébrer en vous? La beauté, la voix,
l'âme? Toutes les trois ensemble en adorant la
femme."&mdash;<span class="aa">Jules Barbier</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">The</span> protégée whom Melba introduced to
the London public during 1906 was Miss Irene Ainsley, a young
contralto from New Zealand, possessed of a remarkably beautiful
voice, for whom her patron gave a successful concert at the
Bechstein Hall on July 10, in the presence of the Prince and
Princess of Wales. The date was altered from July 3 by desire of
their Royal Highnesses, who, owing to their absence in Norway at
the coronation of the newly-proclaimed King, were away from
England during the earlier days of the month. Numbers of notable
people attended the concert, and hundreds of disappointed
applicants were unable to secure admission. The whole of the
assisting artists were musicians who had been greatly encouraged
in their progress by Melba, and the occasion was also interesting
through the public appearance of Melba in the rôle of
accompanist.</p>
<p>It was generally remarked that when she came on with her
protégée, she entered not with the swish and <em>élan</em> that
might be expected from the reigning Queen of Song, but with a
degree of modesty, a measure of self-effacement, that even the
most retiring of professional accompanists could not easily
exceed. All the time she was on the platform she, with admirable
grace, preserved this detached attitude as the assistant, not the
star of the occasion. Among the audience was Madame Mathilde
Marchesi, the distinguished teacher who had so greatly helped
Melba at the beginning of her career; and during the interval the
prima donna presented to the Prince and Princess of Wales the
veteran professor, who a few days later received from the King
and Queen the Order of Science, Art, and Music. The graciousness
of the Royal Family to Melba was still further evidenced later in
July, when the Prince and Princess of Wales, in addition to
summoning her to Marlborough House, also honoured her protégée,
Miss Ainsley, by a request to sing, and at the supper which
followed the concert assigned a place "in the presence" to the
young New Zealander.</p>
<p>The circumstances under which Melba evinced such particular
interest in Miss Ainsley throw an interesting side-light on the
prima donna's character. The young student, whom Melba had heard
in beautiful and distant Auckland, encountered the usual
difficulties in getting a London hearing, and in her extremity
was forced to seek a music-hall appearance, a form of
entertainment which inexperience led her to regard with horror,
but for which she was offered an engagement. On a grey winter day
when life seemed duller than the leaden skies. Miss Ainsley,
discouraged and sad, called at Great Cumberland Place, taking
with her the music-hall contract, which was as yet unsigned. It
was the birthday anniversary of a dead friend to whom Melba had
been devoted, and whose memory was vividly recalled by the
expression on the New Zealand girl's face. No further argument
was necessary to plead Miss Ainsley's cause. Melba threw the
contract into the fire, and within twenty-four hours had
completed all arrangements for a term of foreign study, during
which the student's every want was provided for with the same
completeness as at her subsequent brilliant introduction to the
London public.</p>
<p>It was not only in music that her protégés flourished that
season. Mr. A. MacPatterson, in whose studies she had taken a
deep practical interest during the preceding three years, held an
exhibition of pictures in Brussels with quite unusual success;
while the odd specimens of his work which had found their way to
London had also been highly praised by English
connoisseurs&mdash;circumstances of very natural gratification to
her, since she was the first to detect the young painter's
exceptional gifts. She was also proud to enrol herself among the
admirers of another countryman, Mr. Charles Ritchie, who had
deserted the profession of law in favour of the palette, and
whose coloured drawings were an interesting little feature in the
Royal Academy exhibition. The principal of these pictures she
purchased from Mr. Ritchie, and further commissioned him to make
a portrait drawing of her son. The appeal of pictures is no new
development with Melba, for as a schoolgirl she took a sincere
interest in all such matters, and at the age of fourteen painted
several Bush scenes which show more than average promise of
artistic understanding. Her known ambition is to become the owner
of a fine collection of pictures.</p>
<p>Even such exceptional encouragement to other singers as Melba
has ever gladly given has not entirely sufficed to save her from
the strictures of the unthinking. In every large city there are
always a number of not wholly competent singers who ascribe their
limited success to the machinations of the <i>prima donna
assoluta</i>, whose dominating influence, they allege, has
unfairly prevented their ousting her from a position for which
their greater gifts more fully qualify them. Melba's experience
is not different from that of her great
predecessors&mdash;indeed, misrepresentation has had excessive
licence in her case&mdash;but her retaliation does not run on the
usual lines. One Sunday in the summer of this year (1906), Melba
was to have sung at the private residence of a distinguished
lady, whose guests were to include two very illustrious
personages. On Saturday&mdash;the day before&mdash;the prima
donna found herself so affected by a cold that she had to abandon
the opportunity, which she had been anticipating with loyal
pleasure. When asked to suggest a deputy, she named one of the
very singers who had often attributed the non-realization of her
fullest ambition to Melba's interference. As a matter of fact,
the only notice the prima donna had ever taken of the other
lady's existence was to offer her at the outset the benefit of
her experience and influence. Melba's accompanist saw the
lesser-known singer through the ordeal of the hastily arranged
private seance, and she never allowed herself to be known as the
powerful friend who had secured what would otherwise have been an
impossible honour for the vocalist who, primed by foolish advice,
had always regarded the prima donna as her enemy.</p>
<p>For the second time under the new régime, Melba lent her art
to the support of the autumn season of Covent Garden Opera this
year, and she sang throughout with her accustomed success. The
inability of the management to produce "Otello," owing to the
defection of a too timid tenor who had been brought specially to
England for the title-rôle, was, however, a great disappointment
to the prima donna, who had early prepared herself, and whose
announced appearance as Desdemona, after several years' interval,
had aroused the widest interest. The night originally fixed for
the deferred production was, however, robbed of some of its
disappointing associations through her being commanded to Windsor
Castle for that evening to sing before the newly-arrived King and
Queen of Norway. As Princess Maud of Wales and Prince Charles of
Denmark, their Majesties had long been familiar with Melba, to
whom during this visit they sent autographed pictures of
themselves, set in silver frames.</p>
<p>One of the offices she filled during this season was that of
president of the committee for the complimentary <i>matinée</i>
to Madame Emily Soldene, who on November 13 took a final leave of
her faithful public amid scenes of great enthusiasm, in which the
diva heartily joined.</p>
<p>For the poor of the Rev. Arthur Crawley's parish in Stepney
Green there was an unusually good concert the same day, and if a
stray West End resident had looked in that evening he would have
found Melba directing the proceedings with an energy and
enthusiasm which she had rarely exceeded at any Mayfair function.
Yet this was an entertainment of which the East End knew little,
while the West End knew nothing. Before the concert was over,
many of the poor among the audience and around the building had
heard that the cheerful stage-manager, the accompanist and
general-utility assistant, was the great Melba, so they cheered
her with ardour, and when she left crowded about her motor and
called: "Come back again soon!"</p>
<p>The close of the autumn season found her still in possession
of undiminished energy, and she at once began a series of concert
engagements in the chief provincial cities, among them Plymouth,
where she had never before sung, and where accordingly her coming
was an event of unusual interest. When she left London by the
10.30 express on the morning of the concert, many people had
already assembled round the Guildhall, and early in the afternoon
the double queue of waiting enthusiasts extended from the doors
in Guildhall Square to the boundary wall in Westwell Street.</p>
<p>During the train journey she was so full of fun that one of
her companions, in expressing admiring astonishment, declared
himself a pessimist.</p>

<br>
<small>MELBA AND HER SON, MR. GEORGE ARMSTRONG</small></p>
<br>
<p>"I dislike pessimism in every form. Naturally, there are
serious days in all our lives, and I have had many; but one must
take the good with the bad, and give the good most prominence. A
sense of humour is the greatest help, and the man or woman
without it is to be pitied. I think almost every great artist is
a humorist. Take Jean de Reszke, whose powers of mimicry used to
convulse the lot of us when travelling together; Tosti, the most
skilful of raconteurs; Bemberg, whose surprising antics compelled
incessant laughter; and Caruso, urged on by Scotti to caricatures
and comments that would drag a smile from a stone. These are but
a few of the most intimate instances that come quickest to my
mind."</p>
<p>On arrival at Plymouth she was formally welcomed by the Mayor
and Mayoress and other representative citizens. A special force
of police was told off to regulate the crowds assembled in her
honour, and the <i>Western Morning News</i> significantly
reported next day that nearly all the men on duty had qualified
in the ambulance classes, but that their admirable direction had
saved the possibility of accident. At the concert her reception
was tumultuous, and as a finale to the day's excitement. Admiral
Sir Lewis and the late Lady Beaumont gave a supper-party at
Admiralty House in her honour. In the words of an old resident,
"The only time to compare with it was when Gladstone visited
Plymouth, and even that did not equal the present occasion." In
the other cities the same record of success was established; the
enthusiasm at Birmingham being greater, according to local
wiseacres, than that shown on the occasion of Rubinstein's
memorable visit.</p>
<p>The last days of 1906 supplied an interesting family event in
the marriage of Melba's only child, George Nesbitt Armstrong, to
Miss Ruby Otway daughter of Colonel Jocelyn Otway. The head of
the young bridegroom's family, Sir Andrew Harvey Armstrong,
Bart., was in his place to support Melba, and the numbers of
distinguished people who attended the ceremony, and the unusually
beautiful gifts which they sent to her son, could only be
interpreted as a striking compliment to the singer herself. A New
York musical journal, in writing of the event, said: "She is a
woman who must be credited with more than usual talents entirely
outside of her musical gifts. See what she has accomplished with
the choicest elements of European society, and from this alone it
must be deduced that her personality, her mode of life, and her
own attractions as a woman of the world were the chief media
through which her elevation was attained. How many women are
there to-day who can boast of having a son who, as such, and
merely as such&mdash;for he is too young to have impressed
himself with sufficient force&mdash;can receive the attention of
these notable people? Melba did this herself through the force
and conviction of her own character and
talents.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.
Every musical person should take an interest in this social
triumph of Melba; it is a direct compliment to the whole musical
profession."</p>
<p>For her son's honeymoon the Right Hon. Colonel Stuart-Wortley
lent Highcliffe Castle, the stately Hampshire home where King
Edward was a guest in 1904, and the King of Spain in 1906, and
where, too, the German Emperor spent two weeks' restful holiday
in the late autumn of 1907.</p>
<p>On the morning of her departure for America, there stood among
the well-known people who assembled at Euston to say "Good-bye" a
quiet, modestly dressed woman with tear-stained face, who every
now and then received a kind word or glance from the departing
singer. The weeping stranger was "Caroline," a faithful maid of
many years' service, who had retired on her marriage, but had
come all the way from Paris to take leave of her former mistress.
Many similar instances could be cited of the devotion which
Melba, in spite of a reserve which an inferior might be expected
to regard as impenetrable, wins from her servants even as from
her friends. No birthday ever passes without remembrance by men
and women who serve, or have served, in her <i>ménage</i>; and in
this connection may be recalled the sad death, during the
Australian visit of 1902-3, of a personal maid whom Melba
sincerely mourned. The family of the dead girl well knew Melba's
constant kindness, and a sister has ever since shown touching
recollection of it by being among the first to leave a message of
goodwill and flowers with the singer on the morning of her
birthday.</p>
<p>On the same day that the former servant came to say
"Good-bye," there also stood around Melba's saloon the gentleman
who had acted as her accompanist for over fifteen years, the lady
who had been her private secretary for a similar period, and
nearly a dozen notable people who had attended her début in
London, and who had remained her devoted friends throughout the
intervening years&mdash;simple circumstances in themselves, yet
speaking with eloquence as to the qualities of the woman who
inspired them.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXV</h3>
<p class="quote">"When a thing is supreme, it differs in more
than quality from all lesser things; being perfect, it differs
from the imperfect, not in degree, but in kind. To one who had
not heard Madame Melba for many years, her singing in 'Rigoletto'
last night at the Manhattan Opera-House must have come as a new
kind of sensation. He might have said that it awakened a new
sense. The music of other voices one feels as existing in a
sequence of time. It begins, grows, wanes, and ends. Its beauty
is momentary, subject to the change that moment after moment
brings. The voice of Madame Melba one hears in a different way.
While it is sounding one does not think of a beginning or an end.
The loveliness of it does not seem to be living and dying with
the creative effort of the artist. It is as separate from the
effort as the Venus of Melos is separate from the sculptor who
moulded it and died in ancient Greece. It is a sound that exists
as colour in a painting or an attitude in sculpture exists, out
of time in a world of space. The voice of Madame Melba is
sculptural; it has the qualities of physical form. The voluptuous
large body of her voice takes shape in the air. There is a sort
of atmospheric; softness about the firm but fluent modelling of
the notes, and the phrasing curves into ample and gracious
attitudes. The technical means by which she has so completely
mastered her natural resources are, among all the others, the
unsurpassably easy attack and release of her notes, and a command
of breath which seems to make it inexhaustible, and which renders
possible her perfect legato. But whatever the means, the effect
remains that her singing seems spacious. She can lay a note out
on the air as a painter lays a colour on his canvas, so that it
seems to stay there. It sounds while you hear it as though it
always had existed, and always would exist."&mdash;<span class=
"aa">John Pitts Sanborn, junior</span> (New York).</p>
<p><span class="aa">In</span> 1906 Melba accepted an engagement
to sing at the Manhattan Opera-House, New York; but although the
establishment of the new home of opera necessarily meant certain
competition with the Metropolitan, she was careful to
disassociate herself from any questions of strife that might
develop, and, beyond giving loyal support to her manager, took no
part or interest in the managerial rivalries in which the
opera-going public became engrossed.</p>
<p>It is doubtful if any singer ever entered on a more difficult
task than that which Melba cheerfully set herself when she agreed
to link her reputation with the fortunes of the new Manhattan
Opera-House of New York in its first season. The older house, the
Metropolitan, where in previous years she had sung all her
favourite rôles, and, with the support of irreproachable casts,
had become a strongly established artistic and social
institution, backed by a subscription list of $400,000 (£80,000),
stands in the very heart of the theatre district; its directors
included some of the most influential financial magnates of New
York; it had all the glamour of years of success to enhance its
claim on public support; and, in addition, lavish expenditure had
been made to secure an extra-strong combination of artists, so
that the new venture might be handicapped into speedy failure,
strangled in the early hours of its audacious and&mdash;to
some&mdash;unwelcome existence. On the other hand, the new
opera-house&mdash;the Manhattan&mdash;had practically no
subscription list, and New York's "four hundred" were directly
interested in the financial success of the established home of
Opera&mdash;the Metropolitan&mdash;for whatever support they gave
the Manhattan might be counted as so much less to the funds of
the Metropolitan, for whose financial well-being the majority
were responsible as guarantors or box-holders or both. Besides,
the performances at the houses were fixed for the same
times&mdash;Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday evenings and
Saturday afternoons&mdash;and since it was impossible to be in
two places at once, it might reasonably be assumed that lovers of
music would elect to use the seats for which they had paid
already, rather than enter on an extra expenditure in the way of
Opera patronage. And again, the Manhattan had no supporting
financial syndicate, no board of directors, no division of
responsibility, and it occupied a site far removed from the
accepted amusement locality; its acoustic properties were
unknown, and the completion of the building was carried out under
circumstances of extreme difficulty and anxiety, accentuated by a
serious accident to the guiding spirit, the new impresario, Mr.
Oscar Hammerstein.</p>
<p>On the morning of the day announced for the opening, complete
seating accommodation had not been provided, and it was only
about an hour before the initial performance that the stalls were
fixed in their place. Owing to diffidence on the part of some of
the artists approached, and owing to the keen competition of the
rival management in their bid for the services of others, Mr.
Hammerstein was not able to get together a combination of leading
singers entirely equal to those who usually are associated with
Madame Melba. With the exception of one brief season many years
before, as manager for Madame Lili Lehmann, Mr. Hammerstein had
all his life been interested in providing an entirely different
order of public amusement, and this circumstance was seized on
and exploited as an additional reason for the expected failure of
his grand opera season. If Melba had been there to open it,
perhaps it would have lived a little while, even in the face of
such trying conditions, it was said, but without that initial
fillip it had no chance. Even some of the singers who had
promised to appear, at the last moment refused to leave Europe
rather than risk association with so uncertain an enterprise; and
in the American Courts an adverse verdict had already been given
with regard to the production of "La Bohème," which was to have
been one of the strongest attractions at the Manhattan. On the
opening night, December 3, the building was crowded by an
audience the majority of whom had attended out of curiosity. Many
who had come to scoff remained to praise the conductor, the
orchestra, the chorus, and, above all, the acoustics of the
house, which turned out to be superb&mdash;second only, in the
opinion of connoisseurs, to those of La Scala at Milan. But for
all that, the public did not return on the succeeding nights, and
the performances were given before audiences of the most
depressing limitations. Melba was still in London at this time,
and friends in New York cabled in the most emphatic terms urging
her not to come. The season could not hold out many weeks, they
said, and it would be fatal for her to endeavour to resuscitate a
foredoomed venture.</p>
<p>On December 12 the receipts had fallen to $1,100 (210
guineas). In New York it had all along been rumoured that she had
never seriously contemplated the engagement, and as she had not
signed any contract with Mr. Hammerstein, the way was open for
her to make a graceful withdrawal, She mentioned the matter to
some friends in London, and they, realizing the fate sure to
overtake any inexperienced opera-manager who might elect to run
grand opera in an unfashionable part of London, and in opposition
to Covent Garden, summed up the situation in America accordingly,
and said: "Don't go." Melba, as usual, eventually thought and
decided for herself, and cabled the date of her departure to Mr.
Hammerstein. "I like his pluck," she said; "I will not fail him.
Anyhow, he will have crowded houses when I sing," she added, with
quiet confidence.</p>
<p>Such were the circumstances under which Melba started for New
York on Saturday, December 22, 1906. She had gone through an
exacting summer and autumn opera season in London, with many
concerts on intervening dates, and would have gladly welcomed a
holiday in the ordinary way. Yet, in spite of this somewhat
uncertain if not discouraging prospect in America, she was
buoyant and confident, and for the friends who assembled at the
station and the directors who escorted her to her state-room on
the <i>Caronia</i> she was full of laughing comment and breezy
banter. When the steamer put out from the river-side, Melba still
remained on deck, although the day was cold and wintry, and
presently there came from the pier a loud, shrill "Coo-ee," the
bush-cry of her native land. Although she had no idea of the
source from whence came this greeting, she at once responded with
an answering "Coo-ee," and kept it up at intervals until the call
from the shore could no longer be heard. It was most interesting
to hear how she, by the measure of early familiarity and
exquisite art, could ma-ke this weird cry ring across the water,
and to watch her utter unconsciousness of the surrounding
passengers, who were naturally intent on listening to the
aboriginal salutation uttered by her voice of gold. Most of the
passengers were, as usual, bored by the monotony of the trip; but
Melba, although she kept entirely to her own party, was
constantly in good spirits, and when tired of reading, to which
she gave most of her time, could always amuse herself with
bridge, or even dominoes. As soon as it was possible, she sent a
marconigram to Mr. Hammerstein, telling him she was in excellent
health and spirits, and expressing her desire to open in
"Traviata," and during the day she received a merry answer.</p>
<p>Ever since her first American season in 1893, Melba's arrival
in New York had always aroused great attention, but never had
public interest been so keen as now. Her success in England
during the two preceding seasons had been more emphatic even than
usual, and news of the still growing beauty of her voice,
especially in the middle register, and of her riper dramatic
powers had become a familiar story in New York. Then, it was
known that Mr. Hammerstein, who is immensely popular in the
United States, had entered on a most onerous enterprise against
overwhelming odds, and that Melba, in electing to stand by him
under such conditions, had shown a spirit as independent and
courageous as his own. True, he had contracted to pay her
travelling expenses and $3,000 (600 guineas) for every
performance&mdash;the highest terms ever paid to any artist for a
continuous series of appearances in any one city&mdash;and had
further emphasized his managerial faith by placing a large sum to
her credit before she left London. She was also to have a
perfectly free hand with regard to the concerts already arranged
for her, or any more she might feel inclined to book, between her
operatic engagements. Perhaps Mr. Hammerstein's known liberality
added further to the favour of his venture. Be that as it may,
when Melba stepped ashore, she was undoubtedly the most popular
woman in New York.</p>
<p>In "Traviata" it is the custom for Violetta to wear a generous
array of jewels, and as it was known that Melba for this opera
would take a large portion of her collection with her, Mr.
Hammerstein's arrangements for her reception included the
attendance of two detectives. These, with a waiting army of
press-men, photographers, musical enthusiasts, private friends,
and her own extensive travelling party, made the landing a matter
of considerable excitement, from which Melba, who hates public
parade and show of any kind, gladly hurried to her rooms at the
Hôtel St. Regis. But any hope of quiet in that luxurious hostel
was quickly dispelled, and for the three days following, the
numbers of visitors, letters, telegrams, packets, and
telephone-calls were so great that Melba's entire party were on
the verge of collapse. Fruit and flowers came from friends and
strangers in such abundance as to make suitable acknowledgment
impossible; and another exhausting circumstance for the party was
the steam-heat, which, even when turned completely off in their
rooms, was kept at such a point in the adjoining apartments that
Melba's section was never so cool as the occupants wished.</p>
<p>This excessive heat and unrest proved too trying for the diva,
so she took a furnished apartment in West Fifty-Eighth Street,
cabled for linen, plate, and servants from her London home, and
for the following three months enjoyed being at the head of her
own establishment in New York. The block of buildings in which
was her apartment was one of the first of the kind erected in the
city, and it enjoyed an additional interest for the new tenant,
inasmuch as it had been built by Mr. Navarro, father-in-law of
the beautiful Mary Anderson. A move to the new quarters was
carried out on January 3, Melba having made her memorable
<i>rentrée</i> at the Manhattan Opera-House the evening before.
All the day of her reappearance she had seemed nervous&mdash;at
any rate, much more restless than her wont&mdash;yet at intervals
she was in exceptionally high spirits. After a short walk in
Central Park she had lunch at the Savoy Hotel, and then played
bridge between the times devoted to putting her house in order.
Late in the afternoon she essayed to sleep, as a preliminary to
the evening's exertions, but the attempt was futile, so she got
up and amused herself with dominoes until it was time to start
for the Opera. Mr. Hammerstein, in the hurry of the hour, had
excusably forgotten to reserve any seats for Melba, and for
several days it had been impossible even to buy back a ticket
from the speculators; so she was faced by the unique experience
of not being able to secure for love or money places for the
members of her house-party, who had to stand throughout the
evening.</p>
<p>This little detail gives some idea of the interest rife in the
prima donna's first night, but no wealth of minutiæ could convey
an exaggerated impression of the welcome extended to her. From
the moment of her entrance until long after the close of the
opera every possible opportunity was seized on for an outburst of
enthusiasm. She had admirable support from Signor Bassi as
Alfredo, Monsieur Renaud as Germont père, Monsieur Gilibert as
the doctor, and Signor Cleofonte Campanini as conductor. After
the first act there were ten curtain calls for Melba. There could
be no doubt as to her gratification over the people's verdict
given at a moment of particular significance, and on the way to
her dressing-room she answered an inquiring admirer: "I am
delighted, and as happy as a king." The scenes at the close of
the succeeding acts were still more demonstrative. Several times
after the second act she bowed her thanks in company with the
artists supporting her; then she came alone. At the tenth recall
she drew Signor Campanini on with her, and the next time she
returned with Mr. Hammerstein. As the singer appeared with her
intrepid impresario, the enthusiasm of the audience passed all
bounds, and for some minutes there was a deafening uproar, during
which hundreds of people waved their handkerchiefs, and the
younger members of the audience threw their floral button-holes
at her feet. She had already been surrounded by elaborate
bouquets and wreaths, but there was something very picturesque in
the more informal tribute from the house.</p>
<p>The success of Mr. Hammerstein's great bid for public approval
was emphatic. The routine at the Manhattan was changed in the
most pronounced way, and the influence of Melba's art and fame
not only packed the building on the nights she sang, but from her
first appearance onward the business for all occasions improved
so markedly that during the last weeks of his season Mr.
Hammerstein found himself able to give opera every night of the
week. Even under the most favourable circumstances this would
have been a remarkable achievement. Under the difficulties
already mentioned it may reasonably be described as unparalleled
in operatic history. When Melba was announced, the rival house,
the Metropolitan, naturally put up their strongest attraction,
but nothing could shake her hold on public favour. Whenever she
sang, the house was sold out several days in advance, letters
appeared in the leading-papers protesting against the difficulty
of procuring seats, and the management was blamed for not
inventing conditions to block the activities of the ticket
speculators. Then, again, the sale of standing-room places was so
freely exercised that there were many angry complaints as to the
licence allowed to or taken by Mr. Hammerstein in dangerously
crowding the alley-ways and corridors. All "Melba nights" were
practically the same. The receipts never fell to 2,100 guineas
($10,500), and on January 28 ("Lucia di Lammermoor"), February 14
("Rigoletto"), March 25 ("La Bohème"), her farewell, and other
occasions, they rose above 2,300 guineas ($11,500). As a matter
of loyalty to Mr. Hammerstein, she refused all offers of public
concerts in New York, but she fulfilled numerous concert
engagements in other leading cities of the Eastern States. It was
a great disappointment to the manager of the Manhattan to find
that Melba's concert fixtures would not allow her to appear at
the Opera for the extra performances for which the public now
clamoured, and negotiations were opened at Pittsburg, Cleveland,
and other cities, offering handsome terms of indemnity for her
release, and the substitution of some first-class artist as a
deputy. The answer came that no money would compensate for her
non-appearance, so wherever she had been definitely announced she
went; but where matters had not progressed to the final stage, as
at Ottawa, Toronto, and Winnipeg, she was able to cancel dates in
favour of the Opera.</p>
<p>Her success at these orchestral concerts was a repetition of
that attending her in opera. At Pittsburg she drew the largest
audience known since the establishment of the orchestra; at
Boston her final concert attracted the record attendance since
the building of the Symphony Hall; and at Buffalo the rows of
carriages interfered with the traffic five blocks away from
Convention Hall. When someone showed Mr. Hammerstein a very
clever cartoon of himself by Henry Mayer, the impresario
appropriately said: "Ah, you should see Melba draw."</p>
<p>Owing to her many professional engagements and her enjoyment
of home life, Madame Melba accepted few social invitations, but
whenever possible she had friends in to dinner or lunch. The New
York apartment had been beautified with draperies, ornaments,
cushions, and interesting photographs from her English home, and,
oddly enough, her visitors during the season included Mrs. Hwfa
Williams, the former owner of Melba's town-house, and Lord
Charles Beresford, owner of the beautiful country place which had
been her summer residence during the preceding season.</p>
<p>On January 11 there was a great performance of "Rigoletto,"
with Melba, Renaud, and Bassi in the principal parts. Hundreds
were turned away from the doors, standing-room tickets were sold
at a guinea ($5) each, and the brass barrier of the box-office
was broken away by an excited throng.</p>
<p>At a supper which followed at her home, the prima donna was
full of amusing anecdotes for her guests, who included the Berlin
conductor, Dr. Carl Muck, and his wife. The doctor had made a
great success with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and everywhere
his strong facial resemblance to Wagner had been commented on.
This evening the doctor wore with pride a magnificent pair of
diamond and ruby sleeve-links presented to him by the Kaiser,
whose initial and crown composed the fastenings.</p>
<p>Early in January Madame Melba was joined by her son, Mr.
George Nesbitt Armstrong, and his bride, and they remained as her
guests until the end of March, when they returned to England,
owing to the bridegroom having been appointed Lieutenant in the
Royal Berkshire Militia. Their stay greatly added to the
enjoyment of Melba, with whom they travelled to almost all her
concerts in the Eastern States. They also made a trip to Texas,
and the mother's heart rejoiced on hearing that, at an informal
rough-riding competition, even the wildest of the horses had been
unable to unseat her son. One of her pleasures was to whistle
with him, and note the fluency and accuracy with which he could
give her famous cadenzas. He also contributed much to her
amusement by telling her of the curious business signs and quaint
slang expressions then in vogue, and explained that in the big
department stores the word "customer" was generally abbreviated
to "cus," with disconcerting results to the uninitiated listening
visitor.</p>
<p>Her own eagerness for fun never waned, and from morn till
night she was ever on the <i>qui vive</i> for a joke. She saw the
humorous side of every situation. A few days after her arrival
she received a letter from a foreigner, who said he was the
director of an organized claque, and, as its leader, wished to
place his services at her disposal. The name of this possibly
inventive correspondent was Gilibert, and Melba saw a chance for
a joke at the expense of her friend and colleague, Monsieur
Gilibert. Enclosing the letter in an envelope to the popular
baritone, she wrote a note saying that she had lately been
puzzled as to his occupation, and, now that she had found it out,
was sorry it was one in which she could offer him no
encouragement. On another occasion, after dinner, when the fun
was flagging for a time, she took a pack of cards, and with an
admirable show of gravity pretended to tell the fortunes of her
guests, making such happy guesses and startling prophecies,
interlarded with waggish onslaughts on the subject's weaknesses,
that in a few minutes the whole party was alert with curiosity
and excitement.</p>
<p>In driving along Broadway one day, Melba noticed extensive
advertisements of the "Jenny Lind" cigars, and incidentally
expressed pleasure that the prima donna of a former day was still
remembered. Despite the exacting demands on her time, Melba
throughout the season made frequent opportunities to assist and
encourage her colleagues, Madame Pauline Donalda and Signorina
Emma Trentini, in their studies. Both had been engaged for this
American tour on her recommendation, and she was never too tired
or too busy to spare them explanations and lessons. She
generously coached them in the most important of their rôles, and
had her reward in the general comment on their rapid progress.
When Madame Donalda, who sang nearly all Melba's parts, surprised
her volunteer teacher by singing any phrase or passage with
increased beauty of tone, Melba's eyes would glisten with
gratification, and she would walk up and down the room
exclaiming: "Brava! brava!" Her patience during these
self-imposed lessons was exceptional, although her condemnation
of faults in phrasing, enunciation, or intonation was decisive
and instantaneous.</p>
<p>When it was proposed to add "Lucia" to her Manhattan
répertoire, she found herself at rehearsal without having had
time to look at the score; but although she had not sung the
opera since 1900, she was able to go right through the rôle
without a single lapse of memory. The occasion of her first
appearance in this once-favourite rôle was made the excuse for a
special demonstration from the Australians resident in New York,
who naturally felt very proud of their compatriot. The sale of
standing-room tickets had to be stopped at six o'clock, and the
scene without and within the house was one of unusual animation.
Actors and actresses, writers, painters, merchants, and students,
hailing from the land of the Southern Cross, were among her
audience, and at the close of the Mad Scene they led the house in
an ovation such as seldom falls to the lot of any celebrity. From
the balcony and upper circle there were ear-splitting cries of
"Coo-ee!" which were even repeated by some daring spirits in the
stalls, when the Hon. Daniel O'Connor, ex-Postmaster-General for
New South Wales, who had been the chief speaker at her farewell
concert in Sydney, Australia, in 1886, stood up amid a little
circle of Antipodeans, and in sonorous voice called out: "Bravo,
Australia!" The curious bush call proved a puzzle to the
remainder of the audience, but the general enthusiasm was so
great that hundreds of Americans and Italians tried to repeat it,
and in this effort produced a very chaos of sound. Melba
responded to at least twenty recalls, and at last, in exhaustion,
let her arms drop in a gesture of helplessness. She was then
permitted to retire. An Australian professor of music, Mr. Samuel
Bowden Moyle, a stranger to Melba, had left an order with a New
York florist to send her the first mimosa (wattle-blossom) of the
season, to remind her of Australia, where its profusion makes
spring a dream of fragrance. In an accompanying letter he said:
"Let me tell you how proud we are of you and your superb art. We
lose no opportunity of sharing in your triumphs, and we rejoice
in your glorious success."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVI</h3>
<p class="quote">"There is still no voice like unto that of
Madame Melba, and no one of her sisters on the operatic or
concert stage uses voice with the like spontaneity and ease.
Thirteen years have gone by since she first gave delight to this
city, but charmed and applauding time has constantly enriched
her. When she first visited us, her reputation was that of a
brilliant <i>coloratura</i> singer, with a voice of unsurpassable
beauty. Impersonating Mimi eight years ago, she showed that she
was more than a singer of dazzling bravura. Her tones had a
warmth, a sensuous quality, that some had denied her. Those who
were so fortunate as to hear her memorable performance of
Marguerite's music in 'The Damnation of Faust' at a Cecilia
concert a few years ago were struck by the richness of her middle
and lower tones, which were in themselves expressions of womanly
and tender emotions.<br>
<br>
"To-day this voice is still brilliant in florid passages; it
still has the freshness, the 'girlish quality,' that has always
characterized it, and set it apart from those of other singing
women; but it now has a fulness, a richness, and a sumptuousness
that are incomparably beautiful. The voice of Madame Melba would
work a wondrous spell even if the artistry of the singer were not
uncommon, thrice admirable. And perhaps the most striking
characteristic of this voice as it is to-day is its impersonal
nature. It is not so much the voice of a perfect singer as it is
the ideal voice of song. The hearer revels in the tonal beauty.
The tones themselves are charged with emotions of which, perhaps,
the singer is not always conscious. The voice is like that of the
hermit thrush apostrophized by Whitman:</p>
<p class="poem">"'O liquid and free and tender!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O wild and loose to my soul! O wondrous
singer!'"</p>
<p align="right"><span class="aa">Philip Hale</span> (Boston,
1907).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<span class="aa">Faust</span>," with Melba as Marguerite, was
staged at the Manhattan on February 8, 1907, and, as on all
previous occasions, the house was crowded in every part. The
building, and especially her dressing-room, had been so
overheated that during the second act she almost fainted, and at
one time it seemed as though she would not be able to complete
the opera. By the last act, however, she had entirely recovered,
and sang the closing scene with incomparable brilliancy. In
noticing the opera next day, the <i>New York Sun</i> pointed out
that Melba alone could now draw to this opera an audience which a
few years ago it needed herself, Jean de Reszke, Édouard de
Reszke, and Lassalle to attract.</p>
<p>On Friday, February 22, Melba, who had never heard "Parsifal,"
attended a morning performance at the Metropolitan Opera-House,
where the directors placed a box at her disposal, and some of
them came to pay their personal respects and formally welcome her
to the scene of her early American successes. The music and the
manner of its rendering made a profound, even a remarkable,
impression on her, and at the end of the first act she was unable
to restrain her emotion. She heard the remainder of the work as
though in a trance, and even hours afterwards, in her own
apartment, could not shake off the influence of Wagner's music
drama, which she unhesitatingly described as his masterpiece. The
cast included Olive Fremstad (soprano), Burgstaller (tenor), and
Van Rooy (bass), and Melba's enthusiasm over their interpretation
was unbounded. She referred to Wagner's stipulation that
"Parsifal" was not to be publicly performed outside Bayreuth, and
said she understood and appreciated his wishes; yet she freely
expressed a measure of admiration for the enterprise that defied
the great master's injunction, and gave this sublime performance
to the American people. In spite of many distractions during the
evening, Melba continued absorbed in "Parsifal," and ever and
anon her eyes would become moist with tears as she recalled some
special phrase or scene. Those of the house-party tried to turn
her thoughts to other things, but without avail, and as she
retired late that night she said in a sort of soliloquy: "How
great this work, how great! And yet here am I going to sing in
'Traviata' to-morrow. How can I do it? Heaven, how can I do it?"
Then she added: "I remember, when I went to Bergamo for the
Donizetti Centenary in 1897, I was shown some of the Italian
composer's manuscript which had been copied by Wagner. Carefully
and clearly written out by Wagner, as a means of earning his
bread! The tragedy of it! I should think Wagner's heart must have
almost broken in the task."</p>
<p>The next day she sent for the score of "Tristan und Isolde,"
with which, however, she had long been entirely familiar, and the
interest of that whole day was given to a fresh study of this
opera. Melba is fond of talking of Wagner and everything
connected with his life and his compositions, and if his music
did not so often place an unreasonable tax on the human throat,
she would certainly have derived the keenest pleasure from
constantly identifying herself with Wagnerian rôles. The operas
of his in which she did earlier appear, as already shown, are
"Tannhäuser," "Lohengrin," and "Siegfried," and she also made a
close study of "The Flying Dutchman," in which it is probable she
may soon be heard. In relinquishing the other rôles Melba
recognized that the "Dresden-china-like quality" of her voice
would certainly be marred by their continuance.</p>
<p>Another interesting Manhattan production was that of "La
Bohème," and in the litigation which raged round this opera it
was apparently thought by some that the tactics of the opposition
house, the Metropolitan, had exceeded the usual limit of business
competition. Melba had established Puccini's work both in England
and America, and it was well known on both sides of the Atlantic
that the present popularity of the opera was due to the combined
influence of her art, her judgment, and her courage. Under these
circumstances, it seemed a little ungracious, however
business-like, to place any obstacle in the way of her appearing
in it, and when the question of opposition was first mooted it
was generally discredited. It was also known that Mr. Hammerstein
had specially counted on Melba's appearance in "La Bohème," and
that he had gone to great expense in the engagement of a suitable
supporting cast and in the mounting, which subsequently proved to
be quite superior to that furnished at Covent Garden and the
Metropolitan Opera-House. But in spite of these facts the
Metropolitan management took the matter into court, and in asking
for an injunction against the Manhattan management claimed to
have the sole rights of "La Bohème" in the United States of
America. The legal verdict went against Mr. Hammerstein, but he
appealed, and on the showing that Messrs. Recordi and Co., the
agents for Signor Puccini, had through their representatives
given the Manhattan impresario the right of American
production&mdash;which, moreover, was then being exercised
throughout the United States without let or hindrance by the San
Carlo Opera Company and the Henry Savage Opera Company, among
others&mdash;the appeal decision vrent in favour of Mr.
Hammerstein, who by this time had come to be regarded by some as
the object of a certain amount of persecution. On the verdict in
his support being given, the Metropolitan management lodged a
further appeal, and in operatic circles excitement reached a high
pitch when Mr. Hammerstein, defying consequences, announced his
determination to produce "La Bohème" under any circumstances.
Access to the authorized score was denied him, and the only parts
he could secure were those roughly transcribed some years before
for performance by the Del Conti Opera Company, which was a small
organization.</p>
<p>In order to minimize the chance of threatened interference
with the proposed Manhattan production, the public announcement
of the chosen date was delayed as long as possible; and when at
length it was made, extra steps were taken to handicap the
producer and lessen his claim on the support of the public.
Through the medium of the newspapers, statements were published
claiming that, under the known circumstances, an adequate
performance of "La Bohème" at the Manhattan was an impossibility,
and terse announcements to the same effect were circulated among
the critics, professional musicians, amateurs, and every other
interested section of the New York public. Rumours were current
that, if the performance went on while the appeal to the highest
court was still pending, Madame Melba and Mr. Hammerstein would
be committed for contempt of court, and even as late as half an
hour before the curtain went up representatives of the opposition
coterie assembled in the vestibule of the Manhattan and loudly
voiced their opinions, so that all who passed might hear. In
order to keep clear of the legal warfare, the principal
conductor, Signor Campanini, had from the outset decided not to
associate himself with the public production, and the baton fell
to the hand of his deputy, Mr. Tanara. Such were the
circumstances under which the first performance of "La Bohème"
was given at the Manhattan Opera-House, New York, on March 1,
1907.</p>
<p>The difficulties, it will be seen, were enormous, and could
never have been overcome had it not been for the enthusiasm and
energy of Melba, who spent hours at a stretch in the theatre, and
helped and guided in every possible way. If certain conditions
compelled Campanini to hold aloof from the public performance, he
was free to give his best energies to assisting at the
rehearsals, and in this particular he gave loyal and
indefatigable service to his manager. There was, of course, an
overflowing audience, and long before the performance began there
were signs of wholly unusual interest. Notwithstanding the
handicap placed on the orchestra by the absence of complete
parts, the scenes went with éclat, and the first, second, and
third acts were given with a subtlety and vim never before
equalled by the London or New York casts. Melba was at her best,
and enhanced her familiar success as Mimi. She was naturally the
heroine of the evening, and even if she had been at her worst,
she would still have received an ovation on that particular
occasion. Enthusiasm ran riot, and when, after many recalls on
the close of the third act, she eventually brought Mr.
Hammerstein before the footlights, there was another of those
wild scenes of popular approval to which the New York people had
now accustomed her. The final appeal to the Supreme Court
reversed the decision given in favour of Mr. Hammerstein; still,
the triumph of that 1st of March is one that he may again repeat,
as a friendly settlement has now been arranged.</p>
<p>None but a woman of extraordinary physical vigour could have
gone through the amount of artistic activity and travel which
this American season involved. As an instance of the tax placed
on Melba's powers of endurance, a week's engagements may be
cited. On Monday, March 18, she travelled from Chicago to
Philadelphia, a journey of twenty-two hours; on Tuesday, March
19, she sang at Philadelphia; she then returned to New York and
sang at the Manhattan Opera-House on Wednesday, March 20. The
following day, Thursday, March 21, she had a ten hours' train
trip to Pittsburgh, in which city she sang through heavy
programmes both on Friday, March 22, and Saturday, March 23. The
night of March 23 she spent in the train on the return to New
York, where on Sunday, March 24, she was busy making records for
a gramophone or talking-machine company, who for the selections,
which she easily completed within a week, paid her a cash bonus
of 10,000 guineas ($50,000), with more to follow in the way of
royalties. On the following day, Monday, March 25, she made her
farewell appearance at the Manhattan. Such a programme might well
tax the strength of even the most robust. Melba came through it
in a most astonishing manner, the marvellously fresh quality of
her voice not being impaired in the slightest degree. But even a
Melba could not have encompassed such a week's activity had it
not been that she was stimulated by the people's continued
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The scene on the occasion of her final performance was
described by the newspaper representatives and others present as
quite unique in the modern musical history of New York. The
speculators did a brisk business in the sale of tickets, and
stalls changed hands at as high a price as 6 guineas ($30) each.
Some of the writers quoted much higher figures. "La Bohème" and
the Mad Scene from "Lucia di Lammermoor" were set down as the
evening's bill, in deference to requests forwarded to the
box-office. Long and lavish applause marked the whole
proceedings, and reached a climax after the excerpt from
Donizetti's opera. On her first call after "Lucia," floral
devices of all kinds had been heaped on the stage, until she was
almost lost to view behind the bank they formed. Then the
audience began to leave their places and rush as close as they
could get to the footlights, over which men and women threw
little bunches of roses and violets and lily-of-the-valley. These
they clamoured for her to return to them as souvenirs, and while
she scattered them back among her admirers the enthusiasm
increased, and, as the <i>New York Herald</i> remarked, the
audience also enacted a "mad scene." Showers of small flowers and
rose-leaves were thrown from the proscenium boxes, women were as
bold as the men in their cheery "Bravas!" and the ardour and
unconvention of the leave-taking brought happy but unshed tears
to Melba's eyes. Time and again she expressed her acknowledgment
in eloquent gesture, and the lights were lowered as a reminder of
the necessity to clear the theatre. Melba herself, in a jocular
spirit, assumed a threatening attitude, and said: "Won't you go
home?" "No!" called back scores of voices; and then she signalled
some of the stage attendants to bring a piano on the stage. This
was quickly done, and, sitting down at it, she sang "Mattinata"
to her own accompaniment. Those who were leaving the theatre at
the time rushed back for this unexpected item, and their return
only added to the liveliness of the scene. Applause like
pandemonium was Melba's reward for this last contribution, and a
young fellow in the balcony, in an excess of ardour, having no
other offering, threw a round empty cardboard box (which had
contained flowers or candy) at her feet. Melba by this time was
in full accord with the unconventionality of the moment, and,
catching the box, she put it on her head in an inverted position.
The brightest stage joke ever perpetrated could never have evoked
such appreciation as this. Everybody joined in the roar of
laughter, the "gods" were beside themselves with delight, and
boyish trebles could be heard exclaiming in the slang of the day,
"Ain't she a cracker jack!" "She's all the candy!" and other
vernacular compliments. Twenty-three times she had come before
the curtain after the close of the "Lucia" selection, and it was
only when she seemed utterly exhausted that she was eventually
permitted to retire. But even then she was but in the middle of
the evening's business. Her next duty was to remove her stage
clothes and make-up, and array herself in up-to-date evening
attire for the banquet which a grateful impresario had arranged
in her honour. The tables were laid on the stage, and in addition
to the artists of the company, the business staff of the
opera-house, and the principal critics, there were present a
number of New York's leading citizens. It was again impressed on
Melba that no artist stood so high as she did in the affection
and esteem of the American public. An unknown admirer presented
her with a clay model of herself as Violetta, and with a few
simple words of appreciation she privately expressed her
obligation to all concerned. As souvenirs of the season she asked
Mr. Hammerstein's acceptance of a dress watch, and to Signor
Campanini and the heads of the several departments she gave
scarf-pins and other suitable mementoes. The sale of Melba's
autographs during the eleven weeks' season brought in 30 guineas
($150), to which she added 70 guineas ($350), and gave the whole
towards the building of an addition to the Blind Babies' Home.
They called it the Melba Annex, and addressed the great singer as
"Lady Sunshine." Certain it is that her generosity as well as her
voice brought happiness to many hearts during the Opera campaign
of 1907, which in every respect was one of the most memorable of
her career.</p>
<p>During this season the death occurred, at Paris, of Mr.
Maurice Grau, who first took Melba to America, and who remained
one of her most admiring friends to the end. In voicing her
sympathy and regret, the question of her earlier suggestion, that
the American musical public owed a monument to his old colleague
Henry Abbey, was once more temporarily revived.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVII</h3>
<p class="quote">"Marvellously endowed as she is in both the
gifts of voice and ear, even these, superb as they are, would
have carried her only a short distance to the place she occupies
had they not been associated with, and carried to triumph by
undoubted resolution, unwearied patience, incessant discipline,
and courage that knows no bounds. She wears the crown of song
because she has won it, and won it in the amphitheatre where the
world's choicest and most gifted sons and daughters compete for
recognition."&mdash;<span class="aa">The Right Hon. Alfred
Deakin</span>.</p>
<p><span class="aa">On</span> landing at Cherbourg from America
early in April, Melba caught a severe chill while standing in an
exposed position on the tender during the transshipment of the
mails. A serious illness, of which little was said, was the
result, and for some time afterwards the right lung continued
affected. A grave disappointment which this illness involved to
Melba was the cancelling of her appearances in Brussels, the city
of her operatic début. One of these performances was to have been
for a Belgian charity, and she had looked forward to the occasion
with great interest.</p>
<p>Relying on her usual powers of recuperation, the directors at
Covent Garden felt safe in announcing her reappearances in
London, and the public interest in her coming was shown in the
also usual rush for tickets and their sale at large premiums. The
most determined fight against her physical condition, in a
struggle to enable the directorate to keep faith with the public,
was of no avail, and she had to accept the inevitable and remain
out of the bill. The knowledge that many people had paid
increased prices to hear her sing, and that others had made
certain sacrifices of convenience in order to be present,
intensified her natural disappointment. Some days later, when
going to Covent Garden for a performance of "Traviata," she
noticed that the crowd anxious to hear her was more than double
what the unreserved parts of the house would accommodate, so, in
order to save them from a further tiring and useless wait, she
asked one of her servants to explain to those on the fringe of
the assemblage. A woman who thinks of such small matters is not
the one to break faith needlessly with the public; indeed, all
through her professional career, Melba has been noted for her
desire not to surround her appearances with any of those elements
of uncertainty which in earlier days were regarded as the
necessary atmosphere of every successful singer.</p>
<p>For the royal soiree given at Buckingham Palace on June 8 in
honour of the King and Queen of Denmark, King Edward paid Melba
the compliment of directly expressing his wish that she should
sing on that evening, and His Majesty further enhanced the
occasion by also commanding her to appear at the gala performance
given at Covent Garden on June 11 in celebration of the Danish
Sovereigns' visit&mdash;a performance which was tragically marked
by the painfully sudden death of Sir Arthur Ellis, who was in
attendance on the King. In noticing this performance, the
<i>Times</i> described the ease and finish of Melba's singing as
"miraculous."</p>
<p>Melba's great personal disappointment of this season was her
inability, owing to continued illness, to take her place in the
charity <i>matinée</i> organized by the Duchess of Connaught, and
held at Covent Garden in June. When the scheme had been
originally proposed by the Duchess, Melba was the first volunteer
both for the programme and the committee work, and had suggested
to Her Royal Highness the names of Mile. Destinn, Signor Caruso,
and Dr. Richter as willing co-operators. By the way, it was not
till June of this year that Melba heard Destinn sing, and in the
interval she went behind the scenes to congratulate the Bohemian
soprano.</p>
<p>On June 25, however, she was once more able to resume her
services in the cause of charity, and at the Duchess of
Abercorn's concert given at Bridgewater House for an orphan home
in Ireland she received an ovation such as none could remember
having ever before been extended to an artist singing in a
private house. A few days earlier she was a brilliant figure at
the garden-party given by the King and Queen at Windsor
Castle.</p>
<p>For the closing night of the Opera season, July 30, "La
Bohème" was given, with Melba in her familiar rôle. Queen
Alexandra occupied the royal box, and was evidently delighted
with and amused by the vehement applause of the great audience.
Her Majesty not only remained to the termination of the opera,
but waited for several of the recalls accorded to the artists on
the fall of the curtain. Although the actual date of Melba's
departure for Australia had been carefully concealed, the
audience knew she was leaving London for a year, and this
knowledge led to an extra zest in their leave-taking. When the
theatre had been emptied, hundreds of people, many of them in
evening dress, crowded round the stage-door and watched for her
exit. As the last night of the season is one on which Melba
always waits to make some acknowledgment of her indebtedness to
the heads of the several stage departments, she was unusually
long in making her appearance; but the crowd stayed on in the
utmost good-humour, and cheered her heartily when she passed to
her carriage, lumbers of the young Australian singers and
students, who now make quite a considerable colony in London,
pure always in evidence on the nights when their famous
countrywoman sings, and in addition to the Bush cry of "Coo-ee!"
at the stage-door, there were many cheers for her native land
from the party of colonial youths who ran beside her until the
carriage crossed Long Acre.</p>
<p>Melba's home-coming in 1902 aroused a unique popular
demonstration. Her return in 1907 was almost equally though
inversely dramatic, for when the mail-steamer reached Perth, no
one on shore had any idea she was on board. The visit was to be
strictly private, taken for the purpose of spending some time
with her father and enjoying a restful holiday in her own sunny
country. To secure the desired privacy, it was not disclosed what
steamer she would travel by; instead of her famous pseudonym, she
was booked under her family name; and the embarkation of her son
and his wife, her private secretary and servants, was all carried
out so as not to direct any attention to her identity. The cable
agents in London had been requested not to telegraph any
particulars, and the Australian newspapers were all asked in
advance to co-operate in securing the quietness which she
desired. It was, however, impossible to obtain complete adherence
to her wishes, and directly the steamer reached Fremantle, where
a short stoppage was made, she was recognized by the people who
came on board. Accepting the invitation of the Governor and Lady
Bedford to lunch at Government House, Perth, Melba was unlucky
enough to miss the steamer train, and the necessity of engaging a
special in order to resume the sea-voyage began the fire of
good-humoured raillery which was thenceforward directed towards
every trifling incident. Not anticipating any such emergency,
Melba had not brought on shore sufficient money to pay for the
special train, and, in reply to the humorous request of the
singer, the Governor's representatives offered themselves as
guarantors for the expenditure. The Government subsequently
intimated to His Excellency that they were glad to have had an
opportunity of offering some slight service to the distinguished
Australian, and declined to accept payment for the train.</p>
<p>Continuing the journey from Adelaide, the mail-train was
stopped at Burrumbeet in order to let her repair to her temporary
home, Ercildoune Estate, the beautiful station residence of the
late Sir Samuel Wilson's f amity, without first entering the city
of her birth; and this stratagem insured her a few wholly quiet
days with her father.</p>

<small>MR. DAVID MITCHELL, MELBA'S FATHER</small></p>
<br>
<p>As it has so often been stated in England and America that Mr.
Mitchell's religious scruples have kept him from seeing his
daughter in any of the operatic rôles which she has made famous,
it may be here stated that he has always been a consistent and
liberal patron of music and the drama, and is among the first
subscribers for every musical and dramatic enterprise brought
before the public of Melbourne. True, he has never heard Melba in
any complete performance of an opera, but that is because unkind
circumstances have denied him an opportunity which he, above all
others, would appreciate to the fullest extent. Owing to a
serious illness, brought on by the harshness of the English
climate, Mr. Mitchell was compelled to return to his home in
Melbourne before she had made her début at Brussels. During the
ensuing fifteen years, which saw the building of her universal
fame, considerations of health forbade his leaving Australia, and
when she returned there for her never-to-be-forgotten tour in
1902-03, it was to sing in concert only, although a few
performances made up of scenes from different operas were
eventually given in Melbourne and Sydney. At these operatic
entertainments Mr. Mitchell was an entranced visitor, although
the disconnected scenes could not give a wholly satisfactory idea
as to the value of her work in a complete representation.</p>
<p>On this holiday visit Melba made her first public appearance
in Melbourne, on September 14, at one of Madame Clara Butt's
concerts. On entering with her father, she was instantly
recognized by the people, who, forgetting her plea for an
incognito, cheered her with vigour until she was compelled to
rise and bow in acknowledgment. To the English contralto at her
opening concert she sent an uncommon floral device, which was
draped with a sash bearing the opening bars of Madame Butt's
favourite song, "Abide with me." One of the first occasions on
which the contralto had sung it was at a Melba concert in London
ten years earlier.</p>
<p>Among the local matters with which Melba early identified
herself was a movement to secure the Australian adoption of the
normal musical pitch.</p>
<p>Prior to her arrival in Victoria, the manager of an
enterprising Melbourne firm, who was keenly alive to the
possibilities of a valuable advertisement, took the risk of
sending a piano and pianola to Ercildoune in the hope of their
retention. Having made other provision for her musical
requirements, Melba directed her secretary to request the removal
of the unsolicited instruments. Ostensibly for the purpose of
carrying out her instructions, but in reality with the hope of
inducing Melba to change her mind, an expert operator was sent to
wait upon her. Riding through the Bush towards the homestead, he
encountered two youthful equestrians, of whom he inquired the way
to Ercildoune. They happened to be going there, invited him to
join them, and after a lively ride they parted at the gates.</p>
<p>The expert succeeded in getting a personal interview with the
prima donna, who was obdurate to all his powers of persuasion,
and he was on the point of retreat, when his recent riding
companions appeared on the scene, and were revealed as Mr. and
Mrs. George Armstrong. They ranged themselves on the side of the
salesman, and after explaining that the piano and pianola were a
real necessity to the smoking-room, where they could not possibly
disturb her, Melba yielded to their importunities, and, smiling
over her feeble resistance, went indoors. The unwieldy cases were
still lying on the veranda, and how to get the instruments into
place without proper appliances or assistance before the diva
changed her mind was the next problem. The difficulty was
overcome by harnessing the two gardeners and the expert into a
pulling team, of which young Armstrong and his bride constituted
themselves the leaders. In this fashion the moving began, but to
the accompaniment of so much laughter that Melba came out to
inquire the cause of all the merriment. Without any ado she
joined in the fun, and, with instructions to "pull together,"
declared herself overseer and time-keeper. When the instruments
were in position, the salesman undertook to teach her son how to
get the best effects from the pianola, the diva and her
daughter-in-law being interested listeners. For this anticipated
opportunity the visitor had provided several scrolls of favourite
Melba airs. At first she began to beat time faintly, then she
hummed a few notes, and finally, forgetting all else, burst into
full song. The little audience listened in delight, and at the
finish, when Melba realized the oddity of the situation, she
laughingly expressed her delight with the "musical machinery,"
and the tactful expert retired in triumph. Melba's unwillingness
to deceive, her strict regard for honesty, was demonstrated by a
trifling incident during the early days of her visit. Requiring
some chintz, she went to a leading furnishing shop in Melbourne,
and, on hearing the price of the material shown her, declared
that it was three times more than she had paid for the same thing
in London. The salesman appeared to be greatly surprised at the
alleged striking difference in price, but probably thought the
statement one of those careless exaggerations said to be used by
women when engaged in the subtleties of shopping, more especially
as she bought the chintz at the price asked. Returning home, she
found, on inquiry from her secretary, that she had been
altogether wrong in the London price she had quoted to the
salesman. Most men and women, even those with plenty of spare
time on hand, would have let the matter rest, but Melba insisted
on a message being telephoned to the shop explaining her
mistake.</p>
<p>To a woman of her mental and physical activity, the
allurements of rural seclusion could not make a very extended
appeal, and after a few weeks she also leased a town-house in
Melbourne. A distance of about ninety miles separated her two
residences, but she changed from one to the other with an airy
disregard for mileage that quickly dissipated all idea of the
proposed term of rest. Before a month had passed she was in full
enjoyment of her usual exceptional health, and the indefatigable
manner in which she entered into every kind of amusement
surprised and delighted the people. Dinners and receptions
innumerable were given for her entertainment, and at the first
ball she attended she danced every measure on the programme with
a zest that any débutante might have envied. Races, theatres,
cricket-matches, all strove for the privilege of her attendance,
and her coming on each occasion was watched for and greeted as
the event of the day. From gaieties such as these indicated she
turned easily to give her support to charity bazaars and other
worthy causes, one morning being set apart for a visit to the
Blind Asylum at Melbourne, where she sang song after song to the
poor sightless inmates until their applause almost took away her
voice. Wherever she went she was the darling of the people,
between whom and herself there had grown a more intimate
understanding, a more familiar relationship, than had existed
during the unforgettable visit of 1902-03, when she passed
through the land a regal, dazzling figure, invested by popular
imagination with an armour of imperious reserve.</p>
<p>As during the preceding visit, the Presbyterian Ladies'
College made haste to welcome the singer, who for the year held
office as President of the Old Collegians' Association, and she
was the guest of honour at the annual lawn-party of her alma
mater. In accepting the invitation, she made an amusing
stipulation that in any music performed operatic airs must be
rigidly excluded. The occasion was marked with great éclat, and
as Melba, surrounded by the eminent divines associated with the
college, passed through lines of white-robed pupils, who formed a
guard of honour, the scene was one of considerable pictorial
interest. The Rev. Dr. Alexander Marshall spoke the formal words
of welcome, and Melba being too nervous to read a brief reply
which she had prepared, Senator Ewing performed that office for
the prima donna, who, among other things, had written: "There are
few things in this world which realize what we hope of them, and
our greatest successes and achievements are often far less to
ourselves than they seem to others, because we know how much more
we aim to do, and the labour, often great and bitter, has been
all our own. It has been my fortune to see almost all the world
under advantageous circumstances, and I have been blessed with a
more than common share of success. Yet to-day, when I come here
among this little community of pretty and happy girls, my own
school-days come back to me vividly again. I have known triumphs
since then, and loved them, too, but for all of them I feel sure
that the days of hope and joy at school are among the best we can
any of us look for."</p>
<p>Constant efforts were made to induce Melba to depart from her
early expressed determination not to sing in public during the
visit, and late in November, when what is known as "the season"
had closed, and when numbers of people were leaving the cities
for the coolness of their country retreats, she consented to give
a series of concerts in Melbourne and Sydney. No one but Melba
could have successfully entered on such an experiment under such
conditions, but then, as on many other occasions, she was a law
unto herself. In America the year before, in discussing a most
flattering business proposal with the director of a gramophone
company, she bluntly said: "I don't think you have made proper
acknowledgment of all you owe me. I was the first great singer to
consent to my voice being recorded. All the others refused,
because they were uncertain of results. I saw the possibilities
of development, and I took the risk. The same with the Manhattan
Opera-House. Other famous artists were afraid to associate
themselves with the new and powerfully opposed venture. I have
come against all advice. What other artist in my position would
have done it?" "Madame, no other artist dare," interjected the
director, and his implied compliment was merely the simple
truth.</p>
<p>The night before the opening of the box plan for the first of
these concerts at Melbourne, scores of people stood in the street
from midnight, and in a subsequent fancy illustration in the
<i>Bulletin</i> an interrupted burglar was depicted excusing
himself from arrest on the plea that his nocturnal activity was
merely incidental to the Melba box-plan vigil. It would be
superfluous to describe the crowds and enthusiasm at these
concerts. Both in Melbourne and Sydney, on her first appearance,
she had to make a gesture of appeal for a cessation of the
applause, lest its continuance should unnerve her. In both cities
she stood knee-deep among banks of floral offerings, those of the
Governor-General of the Commonwealth, of the State Governors, and
of the Premier of Victoria, having the added compliment of
personal presentation.</p>
<p>In discussing musical matters at Sydney connected with her own
doings, Melba said: "I have not missed a single season at Covent
Garden since my début there as Lucia in 1888. In this way I shall
complete my twenty years' service next season, and I believe the
directorate will celebrate that event and my birthday anniversary
simultaneously as soon as possible after May 19. The record is
something to be proud of, the rarity arising in part from the
fact that a single miss from illness or absence abroad or the
failure to be engaged would break the sequence of success.</p>
<p>"Yes, I created the rôle of Hélène in Saint-Saëns' opera of
that name at Monte Carlo, and had intended singing in it at New
York this year, as the music is beautiful, and was originally a
great success. In style the piece is more like a cantata allied
with spectacular effect than like grand opera. There are scenes
showing the burning of Troy and the subsequent departure of the
ships. In London the work was not very highly appreciated, but
audiences there are very conservative, and are slow in adding to
their répertoire of 'old friends.' In that respect music-lovers
move along faster in America, and that is how it was I sang 'Le
Cid' some time ago in New York, though the opera has not yet been
put up in England. It is a lovely work, and during my brief
Sydney season I hope to sing 'Pleurez, pleurez, mes yeux,' from
it, and possibly the 'Alleluia.'"</p>
<p>Before leaving Sydney, Melba was waited on by Ratu Kadavu Levu
and Ratu Pope, native princes of Fiji, who wished to pay homage
to her and greet her as the <i>matai</i> (champion) of singers.
They presented her with a <i>tabua</i> (whale's
tooth)&mdash;indicative of the highest honour in the gift of a
Fijian chief. According to ancient custom, this talisman carries
with it the freedom of Fiji. In olden times the possessor of the
<i>tabua</i> could send to the ruler from whom the symbol was
received and secure as many fighting men as the circumstances of
any troublous emergency required. Among the other gifts presented
to Melba by the Fijian chiefs were mats as fine as delicate lace,
which had been beaten from the bark of native trees.</p>
<p>Commenting on Australia's noticeable advance along the paths
of art since her last visit, Melba remarked: "I think that there
is an immense stride toward a finer appreciation of song and
painting and the printed word. Melbourne and Sydney, too, seem to
have made noticeable advances both in appreciation and in
performance in all the arts. It must not be imagined that I take
an interest only in music, although, perhaps, my keenest
interests lie in that direction. One of my first visits this time
was to the Art Gallery. I was delighted to see that they have
bought a Corot. That is the first step in the right direction.
When next I come here I hope to see a Gainsborough and a
Reynolds, perhaps even a Rembrandt.</p>
<p>"One thing one misses out here is Sunday music. You know, I
may describe myself as one of the pioneers of the Sunday-night
concerts at the opera-houses in New York, I cannot see why
Sunday-night concerts at popular prices cannot be held both in
Melbourne and Sydney. I know that some people will not like my
saying this, but I must say it, for I cannot see how anyone can
be harmed by hearing the music of the great masters&mdash;the
symphonies of Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, the fine oratorios of
Handel, all the beauty which one finds in the orchestral and
chamber-music of the world's noblest musicians. And it must be
remembered, too, that thousands of people have only Sunday nights
upon which to hear music. I believe that concerts of this kind
would be tremendously patronized. There must be many who have to
work all the week, yet who have taste enough to appreciate good
music, and who thirst for it as I did when a child. In London and
Paris&mdash;in fact, in all the centres of art&mdash;these
concerts are given, and it is only when one has been there, and
knows what it is ever to have good music at one's command, that
one realizes the deficiency which exists in Australia. Any
objection to the public performance of fine music upon Sunday
seems rather narrow. Yes, I suppose I shall offend some by this
statement, but I am sure there will be many who will
approve."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h3>
<p class="quote">"The greatest singers of the day are among my
patients. I conducted some experiments with Madame Melba
regarding resonance. The most elastic vocal cord to-day is Madame
Melba's. She makes use of the anterior portion of the cord, and
that accounts for the lasting quality of her voice. There is no
person with more resonance and less nasal quality than Madame
Melba."&mdash;<span class="aa">Dr. John Milsom Rees</span>.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Evidence in Horspool versus Gumming musical
libel suit at the Royal Courts of Justice, London, February
1908.]</p>
<p><span class="aa">Melba's</span> final week in her native State
was one of interesting activity. Sunday, February 16, was the
eightieth anniversary of her father's birthday, and from the
early morning, when she accompanied him to Scots Church, where he
had regularly taken her as a child, until the close of the day
she devoted herself to his pleasure. The following day she was
entertained at a farewell gathering by the University
Conservatorium of Music, at which the Principal, Professor
Petersen, the Premier of the State, and the Minister of Education
made feeling references to the guest of honour.</p>

<small>"MY SONG-BIRD HAS FLOWN AGAIN"</small></p>
<br>
<p>Four days later, when she left Melbourne, there was another
flattering testimony of the people's esteem. A large crowd
assembled outside the railway-station, and platform-tickets were
necessarily limited to her personal friends and the members of
the Women's Exhibition Choir, who, to the number of fifteen
hundred, came to serenade her. Clad in pure white dresses, with
corsage badges of Australia's golden wattle, these women singers
supplied an effective pictorial note in a scene which was further
enhanced by the quantities of beautiful flowers sent for Melba's
acceptance. The choir, among other numbers, sang "For She's a
Jolly Good Fellow," "Home, Sweet Home," and "Auld Lang Syne," and
it is not to be wondered at that, when the time came to say
farewell, she was voiceless from emotion. As the train moved
away, the throng outside the station joined those on the platform
in three hearty cheers.</p>
<p>Speaking of that occasion on her return to London, she said:
"I think the greatest event in my life was when I was serenaded
at Melbourne by a choir of fifteen hundred women, many of whom
had travelled from the hills and seaside to bid me 'Good-bye.' It
was an honour the spontaneity of which I fully appreciate, and
can never forget. Imagine fifteen hundred women singing together,
and producing a vocal effect so charming, so harmonious, that it
is impossible to describe. It touched my heart-strings, and I
felt very proud at being one of them&mdash;an Australian woman."
At Adelaide, where she embarked on the <i>Orontes</i>, Melba was
also serenaded and cheered by great gatherings whose enthusiasm
deeply impressed her.</p>
<p>On the voyage to England she was the life and soul of the
steamer, promoting amusement and joining in every game devised
for the enjoyment of the passengers. The night before the
<em>Orontes</em> reached Naples she was the merriest figure at
the fancy-dress dance given on board, and took part in every
measure on the programme with a gaiety that charmed her
fellow-travellers. One of these, being in want of some emerald
silk to complete her improvised Irish costume, was startled to
hear Melba order the spoliation of a beautiful Paris hat, so that
the young lady might be supplied with the necessary colouring. A
proposed motor-trip from Naples through the Italian and French
Riviera to Paris was frustrated by the break-down of the machine
before reaching Rome, so Melba made the journey by rail.
Immediately on arrival in Paris she began the dramatic study of
"La Tosca" for the London season.</p>
<p>While so engaged she received a flattering requisition, signed
by Victorien Sardou, Ludovic Halevy, Camille Saint-Saëns, Jules
Massenet, Jean Richepin, Maurice Donnay, Paul Hervieu, and Alfred
Carus, requesting her services for a gala representation at the
Paris Opera in aid of the benefit fund of the Société des Auteurs
et Compositeurs Dramatiques, and the date of June 11 was selected
to suit her convenience. Always popular in the French capital,
where she lived for the first fourteen years of her professional
life, the announcement of her reappearance after an absence of
six years from the Opera aroused special interest. "Rigoletto"
was the opera selected for the occasion, with Signor Caruso and
Monsieur Renaud as the Duke and the jester. On the first
intimation of this performance, members of the Rothschild family,
with their customary generosity, initiated a scale of exceptional
prices by subscribing £200 each for boxes and £40 each for
stalls. The performance was an extraordinary success, the
receipts reaching £5,400, and Melba was given an ardent
welcome.</p>
<p>While lunching with Madame Marchesi in Paris during Easter
week, Melba first met Madame Ellen Gulbranson, the great
Wagnerian singer, with whom she found herself in strong sympathy,
not the least of their common bonds being an affectionate regard
for the aged teacher, who had lately lost her husband, and whose
loneliness they were endeavouring to cheer. On the day of their
meeting, Melba, to the accompaniment of Herman Bemberg, sang
several arias for the little party. A desire to hear Madame
Gulbranson in some of her great numbers was then expressed, but
it was thought that there was no one present who could play the
accompaniments from memory. Melba volunteered, and the
Scandinavian artist sang "Elizabeth's Greeting" superbly.
Probably no vocal effort of Melba's ever caused Madame Marchesi
greater pride than her pupil's ability to adequately accompany
Madame Gulbranson in the "Tannhäuser" air. The voice and art of
the Wagnerian singer delighted Melba, who, before parting,
pledged herself to visit Bayreuth in order to hear Madame
Gulbranson in "Parsifal," which had so impressed her when she
first heard it in New York.</p>
<p>Before entering on her twenty-first consecutive "grand" season
at Covent Garden, during the course of which she has also
appeared throughout three autumn seasons, Melba received from the
King a command to sing at the gala performance given in honour of
Monsieur Fallières, President of the French Republic, at Covent
Garden on May 27, 1908.</p>
<p>To her credit had now been placed the unique distinction of
having been commanded to every gala performance held at Covent
Garden since her début, and to almost every royal concert given
in honour of visiting heads of State or their heirs apparent
during the same period, commencing with the gala commemorative of
the Shah of Persia's visit in 1889. This list of royal favours is
apart from the different State concerts for which her artistic
services have from time to time been requisitioned, and no singer
of any land or any generation can claim a similar record.</p>
<p>As considerable misconception appears to exist with regard to
the appearances of singers at royal functions, it may
appropriately be pointed out that a "command" can only come from
the actual head of the State. The other members of the English
Royal house are always scrupulously careful not to infringe on
the prerogative of the King or Queen in this respect, although in
the newspapers of the day they are often credited with giving
"commands." As an indication of respect, and in deference to his
personal popularity, the expressed wish of the Prince of Wales,
however, is always accepted as equivalent to a "command."</p>
<p>Whenever any lyric soprano of exceptional talent makes a
successful appearance at Covent Garden, or in New York, or in any
of the great Opera centres of Europe, there are always a few
people who interpret such success as a challenge to the supremacy
of Melba. This usual development reached an unusual stage during
the Australian artist's absence in her native land, and her
reappearance at Covent Garden on May 19, 1908&mdash;which
happened to be the anniversary of her birthday, and the first
night of her twenty-first consecutive "grand" season at London's
Royal Opera&mdash;consequently aroused unwonted interest.
Although Melba knew little of what had been said and done during
her absence, she set her influence against the cultivation of any
form of rivalry between herself and her colleagues (and against
the sensationalism which had been widely promulgated) by making
her <i>rentrée</i> in the too familiar "La Bohème," an opera
which allows her practically no opportunity for brilliant vocal
display, and which has in it no element to make any special
appeal to the enthusiasm of even her wildest partisans.</p>
<p>The result was astonishing. The whole of the reserved seats
were sold out within a couple of hours after the opening of the
box plan, and for the unreserved gallery people waited in the
street from the early morn. The box-and stall-holders, who have
always been her strongest supporters, showed their friendship for
her by a display of diamonds never before equalled on any but a
gala night, and by a remarkable outburst of applause, in which
Her Majesty the Queen took a conspicuous part. The course of the
opera was broken, so that the whole audience might give her
speedy assurance of their loyalty and admiration, and Melba was
palpably touched by the warmth of her welcome. Throughout the
evening, ovation succeeded ovation; at the close of the third act
the applause seemed as though it would never end, and after the
performance, when she passed to her carriage, hundreds of people
waited to give her a final cheer as she drove away laden with
flowers.</p>
<p>Every critic in London testified to her unrivalled voice and
art, and the majority, as on many a preceding occasion,
proclaimed that evening's impersonation of Mimi as finer than any
she had ever given. New terms of praise were found to express
public appreciation of her gifts, and there were many
acknowledgments of the ever-growing variety of her expression,
the added force and conviction of her acting, and increasing
roundness and richness of her voice, especially in the
lowernotes&mdash;tributes peculiarly welcome to Melba, who is
ever striving after artistic progress.</p>
<p>Among the many congratulations she received was a
characteristic message from Mr. Oscar Hammerstein, the New York
impresario, who came over from Paris to hear her, and who wrote:
"Nobody sings like Melba, and nobody ever will." The general
opinion of the London musical world may be said to have been
voiced in Mr. Benjamin William Findon's summary: "Melba reigns.
Her vocal triumph last night leaves her in the position she has
occupied hitherto at Covent Garden. The radiant planet of the
Antipodes is still the clearest crystal star of the aurora
borealis. People have wondered how this new artist and that new
artist would compare with Melba when she was once again heard at
Covent Garden. There is no comparison. Melba reigns! She reigns
by reason of the gorgeous quality of her voice, of tones which
suggest a liquid blend of corn and oil. Faultlessly pure,
exquisitely rich, and one might almost say immaculately true,
describes best her singing last night, when she appeared for the
first time this season to a house crowded in all parts. I put
aside the ovation which greeted her, the prolonged applause that
attended the fall of the curtain. That told me nothing I did not
feel. My dominant idea was&mdash;Melba reigns. And in saying this
I do not depreciate the other brilliant artists who are brought
to our notice by the generous management of Covent Garden. Each
in her way is possessed of qualifications that call forth our
warmest admiration, and to each is due the cordial appreciation
of those they seek to please. But Nature takes precedence of Art,
for Nature in her luxuriant beauty includes all that Art
simulates and imitates. It is too late in the day to criticize
'La Bohème,' or Melba's interpretation of the pathetic rôle of
Mimi. Both are familiar masterpieces at Covent Garden, and both
are familiar to its habitués. Last night, however, Melba
surpassed herself. There may have been a latent feeling that she
was called upon to make a supreme effort to maintain her
sovereignty as the Queen of Opera; the effort was made, and she
enthroned herself anew in the hearts of those who know how to
judge and appreciate the magical charm of a voice unsurpassed
since the days of Patti's prime."</p>
<p>It was a great occasion, a notable celebration of an
unequalled record, and Melba was manifestly pleased. Her triumph
was complete, her supremacy undisturbed. She accepted the
flattering situation as the realization of an expectation on
which she had confidently counted, yet in her gratification there
was no shadow of ostentation.</p>
<p>Like all public characters, Madame Melba receives an
embarrassing number of letters of all kinds from unknown
correspondents, but in America this tribute has become the more
puzzling because the writers often begin their communications in
terms of friendship, even affection, and it is often only
possible to find the letter is from a stranger after reading
almost to the end of a lengthy epistle. Many of these letters are
so full of pathos that it is impossible to peruse them unmoved,
and on that account Melba never examines any of them immediately
before a performance. The following samples may give a fair idea
of the variety in a day's mail:</p>

<br>
"I have a fine canary bird that sings a beautiful song unlike
other birds. I am going to have a fine singer sing like him. I
come to you first because you are the finest. I would not sell
the bird for no money, but I am going to have his song copied. I
am a poor woman, and I ask $5,000 (five thousand dollars) for his
song. I presume you think the price is high, but I expect to get
it. Mrs. Sage is doing so much with her money, perhaps you could
induce her to furnish the money for you. I love my bird; I would
not part with him for ten times the money.</p>
<p>"In my young days I was a fine singer and musician, but
reverses came and I drifted away. If you would get me that much
money I could study and take up my music again. Do not think that
I am out of my mind; I am a sane woman, and know what I am
writing. You may laugh about this letter and throw it away, but
if you do not take the chance, some one else will. You would have
to practise with my bird to learn his songs. I had hoped to see
you, so I could say things plainer.</p>
<p>"Hoping to hear from you, &mdash;&mdash;."</p>
<br>
<p align="right">"<span class="uu">New York</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The exquisite loveliness of your voice last
evening was so far beyond all earthly beauty, I felt as if the

down and worship.</p>
<p>"Your singing is above art&mdash;it is religion.</p>

you.</p>
<p>"I am in despair. For ten long years since my boyhood I have
been hugging this scenario, waiting for a future Wagner. But I
know no composer of even ordinary merit. Will you forgive me for
enclosing the scenario&mdash;just the bare plot? If it appeals to
you, and you could bring it to the notice of some great composer,
I shall be eternally grateful to you. What woman is there in this
generation, save you, who could sing the heroine's death-song as
she stands upon Delhi's burning wall before flinging herself on
the flames beneath? I could write the libretto in my heart's
blood, for I am descended from one of the actors in this historic
tragedy enacted in India seven centuries ago&mdash;<em>i.e</em>.,
a collateral branch of the heroine's dynasty."</p>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Five years ago I came to London, and, as with
all Australians, my fear of the unknown evil of this great city
was my dominant feeling. Then, on my first Saturday night I went
to hear you sing, and you stirred some depth in me that made me
oblivious to all personal danger&mdash;even to the fact that at
the close of the performance I had got separated from my two
companions; for I was alone in the opera-house waiting, hoping
for you to come back once more. One of my friends had the
latchkey, the other had my purse; yet, when I gradually realized
the position, I was utterly indifferent. Nothing mattered since I
had heard you sing. I gave my cabman a ring, and told him to call
in the morning. Then, as I could not make anyone hear, I went
down the area steps. Some thoughts are more refreshing than
sleep, and these were mine till the dawn came.</p>
<p>"Many times since I have heard you, for now with my daughter I
live in London, and to us both the experience of your singing is
always the same&mdash;an exaltation that soars above Life, or
even Death.</p>
<p>"I trust you will soon come back to reign over us as

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIX</h3>
<p class="quote">"The Australian soprano's voice is the most even
and beautiful I have ever heard. When in her best vein, Madame
Melba's voice is matchless. It has a curious impersonal quality,
or rather a fixed personal quality, which varies so little that
it seems absolute and impersonal, like the sound of a fixed-tone
wood-wind instrument. The notes of her voice have often been
compared with the perfectly matched pearls of a rare necklace.
All have the same musical shape and size, and the same beautiful
colour and lustre. As absolute singing, nothing I have ever heard
can be likened to Madame Melba's delivery of 'Caro Nome,' or the
Mad Scene from 'Lucia di Lammermoor.' Her voice appeals to the
type of intellectualized sensuousness which finds delight in
exquisite goldsmith's work. When you hear Melba sing 'Caro Nome'
you do not care whether Gilda is supposed to be in love with the
Duke or not. You just sit back in your stall, and your ears are
entranced with beautiful sound."&mdash;<span class="aa">Edward
Algernon Baughan</span> (May 1908).</p>
<p><span class="aa">After</span> noting down some individual
particular as a "Melba" characteristic, one finds her so often
acting in opposition to it, that there is a strong disposition to
withdraw the descriptive attribute; yet she is so honest and so
straightforward that it seems an absurdity to suggest any
difficulty in summarizing her personality. Still, in her case
extremes do meet, and with this union of apparently
irreconcilable qualities, the looping-up of paradoxes, there
exists that something which is so potent in the fixing and
holding of strong personal regard.</p>
<p>The late Archbishop Corrigan, while explaining the
contradiction in her deductions on one occasion, said: "But, my
dear Madame, you are not logical." "I am at least as logical as
your Grace, for you are seeking logic in an artist," was her
answer.</p>
<p>Intolerant of subterfuge, Melba demands from her friends the
same unfaltering sincerity which she gives them; and at a time
when so much is sacrificed to opportunism, especially by those
who fill a prominent place in the fashionable world, it is
exhilarating to find a woman like this great singer deaf to the
call of expediency. Her artistic eminence, entailing as it does a
continuous demand for expressed opinions, might in itself be
regarded as a barrier to the exercise of that honesty which is so
strong within her; but unusual moral courage, tempered by
kindness of heart, gives her easy egress from what to a weaker
personality would be a prison-house of enshackling circumstance.
Holding strong convictions, and ready to employ an unflinching
candour in their championship, she is naturally not immune from
the liability of occasionally having her motives
misinterpreted.</p>
<p>Where there is no matter of vital interest at issue, Melba can
be silent where speech is sought from her, if she has nothing
encouraging to say. If praise is due, she gives it warmly; but no
one has ever yet heard her descend to flattery or empty
compliment. Such a woman is sure to be misunderstood by some who
batten on the affectations of our superficial modernity. Time and
again throughout her career instances have arisen where she could
have added to her professional progress, her worldly well-being,
or her personal popularity, by silence or equivocation, but she
has refused to profit by any sacrifice of principle.</p>

<br>
<small>A FAVOURITE PROFILE PICTURE OF MELBA</small></p>
<br>
<p>Of her it can be said without reserve that she has never been
known to purchase any benefit at the price of truth. The most
intimate of her friends are occasionally offended by her
sincerity and vehemence of expression, but in the succeeding
moments they are redeemed from rancour by the frank generosity of
her atonement, the knowledge of her enduring kindness.</p>
<p>Many persons have sought advancement in Melba's favour by
reciting to her uncharitable stories concerning artists or others
supposed to be her rivals in musical or social eminence. For such
vulgar tactics she has no toleration, and always interrupts
impatiently with: "I never allow anyone to come to me with
spiteful gossip." It can be readily gathered that a woman like
Melba is not consumed with any vain desire to transform all her
acquaintances into friends; indeed, she is careful to draw a
marked distinction between the two phases of association. Like
all people who reach great heights of fame, she is sure to have
some enemies, but with her genial toleration and broad view of
life, she is too much of the laughing philosopher to pine over
the inevitable. It is equally safe to assume that there are some
people towards whom she entertains fee[l]ings of antipathy, but
concerning those who have injured or maligned her, Melba prefers
to maintain a dignified silence. She never frets herself into
seething virulence, and if she does not wholly forgive, she most
certainly endeavours wholly to forget those whose personality is
distasteful to her&mdash;an endeavour entirely successful, if one
may judge by her habitual insouciance.</p>
<p>Whatever faults Melba possesses&mdash;and being human, she has
her share&mdash;they are the faults that one might expect to find
in a big, generous nature. She could never stoop to the small,
mean things of life, and has never been known to shirk the
consequences of her own acts. So much might be looked for from
one who has ever been more ready to seek the beam in her own eye,
rather than the mote in the eye of a friend; a woman who has
sincerely striven to shape her life in accordance with her
favourite maxim, "Live and let live."</p>
<p>The appreciation and enthusiasm with which she enters into the
work and successes of her artistic colleagues, and the generosity
with which she encourages the aspirations of students on the
threshold of a career, are among her finest qualities, and the
exercise of these attributes constitutes a stimulating pleasure
for those who are privileged to enjoy her friendship.</p>
<p>Her almost incredible indifference to the rivalries of
contemporary singers is not the result of any depreciation of
their artistic qualities, but springs from an unfaltering, yet by
no means arrogant, faith in her own ability to maintain supremacy
in the sphere of musical activity wherein so many hold her
peerless.</p>
<p>In all that pertains to the dignity of the musical art Melba
has ever shown an exemplary zeal. Her admiration for Adelina
Patti, Milka Ternina, Emma Nordica, Schumann Heink, Jean de
Reszke, Emma Calvé, Joseph Joachim, Ignace Paderewski, Arthur
Nikisch, Pol Plançon, Hans Richter, to mention but a few of those
with whom she has been closely associated, is sure to lead her
into a flow of warm-hearted comment. On one occasion in Paris,
after seeing Sarah Bernhardt in "Camille," Melba took a string of
pearls from her neck, and, in token of gratitude for the
performance, clasped them round the throat of the famous
tragedienne.</p>
<p>It has become almost a truism that no great singer ever gives
material help to a lesser-known artist whose voice belongs to the
same class as his or her own, and that no prima donna has ever
been known to spare enthusiasm for the art comrades who sing the
same rôles in which she has become famous. In Melba the operatic
world has found a striking exception, manifest on the one hand by
her more than liberal encouragement to Pauline Donalda, Elizabeth
Parkina, Emma Trentini, and on the other by her generous estimate
of the work of Adelina Patti, Marcella Sembrich, and Lilian
Nordica. During the opera seasons of 1905-06 and 1906-07, both in
London and America, much of Melba's time, which she might
reasonably be expected to have given to recreation or rest, was
cheerfully set aside for lessons to Donalda, Parkina, and
Trentini. In addition to these opera-singers, Melba gave, and
continues to give, invaluable help towards the training of
different young concert artists, especially to those whose
financial means are of the smallest. No singer of the present or
past generation has been identified as Melba is with the
encouragement of aspiring musicians, and the names of her
protégées are legion. Her time, influence, and money have been
freely and continuously given in smoothing the way for talented
students, and in spite of numerous disappointments due to the
want of health or perseverance, or other causes in connection
with these beginners, Melba's interest in the novices of her art
continues unimpaired. It is only those who have been present at
the informal lessons which she takes it on herself to give
ambitious singers who can fully realize how completely she has
mastered all the intricacies of the vocal art. Her insistence on
the necessity of an understanding of the composer's meaning, and,
again, her strong plea for a fair knowledge of the anatomy of the
throat, as necessary preliminaries to the reasonable
interpretation of any vocal music, come as a surprise to many who
think that the subtleties of breathing, phrasing, tone
production, and expression can be secured by entirely superficial
study.</p>
<p>Curious testimony of the reputation Melba enjoys as the patron
of young singers was forthcoming during her last American season,
when a Marchesi pupil who had been engaged by Mr. Hammerstein
sent the prima donna a little piece of embroidery as an
expression of her thanks. Melba, as it happened, had done nothing
to secure the novice's preferment.</p>
<p>The noble singing of Ternina and Schumann Heink have always
appealed to her in a special way, and she has often described
them both as goddesses, transformed, deified, by the transcendent
beauty of their art. Perhaps the fact that she began her
professional career as a "star," and did not work her way up from
a subordinate position, may have robbed her of any reason for the
alleged usual jealousies.</p>
<p>In the privacy of her own home, even the gramophone
reproductions of the voices of Enrico Caruso, Schumann Heink,
Scotti, and Pol Plançon have been known to make such an appeal to
her interest. that she has often left her letters or her books
and gone to the room where some of her guests may have been
amusing themselves with the instrument, to express her admiration
and delight.</p>
<p>Owing to the unique position which Melba has now held for
several years at Covent Garden, it has become the fashion in
certain circles to ascribe to her great power and activity in
matters affecting the management, more especially the engagement
of the artists. The admirers of any singer who has not been able
to win a lengthy engagement at Covent Garden always attribute
their favourite's rejection to Madame Melba's interference; and,
on the other hand, the enemies of any artist who has been
fortunate enough to retain a position there for any extended term
are always ready to assert that this good fortune is the result
of Melba's unreasonable preference.</p>
<p>While always ready to express a favourable opinion on the
merits of any deserving singer, Melba never allows herself to
pronounce adverse judgment on opera candidates, nor to do
anything that would harass or hamper the managerial functions of
the directors, whose confidence and esteem she has held for so
many years, and whose task is already of ample difficulty without
the further handicap of extraneous interposition.</p>
<p>In commemoration of the completion of her twenty years'
association with the Covent Garden Royal Opera, Melba gave a
charity <i>matinée</i> at that house on June 24, which was
honoured by the presence of the King and Queen and a
distinguished audience, and which resulted in her handing over to
the London Hospital a cheque for £2,000 ($10,000). The programme
consisted of the first act of "Madame Butterfly," in which
Mademoiselle Destinn impersonated the title-rôle; and the first
act of "Traviata," with Melba as Violetta. To show appreciation
of the brilliant Bohemian's assistance, Melba, though tired and
anxious from the necessary extra work incidental to the occasion,
went to the opera-house in time to hear the whole of the act from
Puccini's work.</p>
<p>On the evening before the matinée, the Duke and Duchess of
Sutherland entertained a small company at a ball in honour of the
King and Queen. It was the most brilliant private function of the
season, and Melba was among those invited to meet Their
Majesties. Strongly appreciating the enjoyment of elegant social
intercourse, Melba's desire to attend a soiree of such unusual
interest must have been great, yet long-practised discipline made
it possible for her to renounce the pleasure without making
apparent her disappointment. Duty to the public demanded that she
should give them of her best next day, and she helped that
possibility by retiring early.</p>
<p>The matinée was marked by a great manifestation of enthusiasm,
and the final scene, when Melba stood in the centre of the stage
surrounded by flowers and faced by a joyously cheering throng,
was one that must have left a vivid impression on all who
witnessed it.</p>
<p>To the audience the smiling heroine of that great ovation was
an enviable figure, and no one would suspect that under all the
gaiety and enthusiasm there were circumstances of somewhat
pathetic isolation. All those nearest and dearest to her were far
away on that eventful afternoon. Her son was lying ill at
Marienbad, and a whole world's length separated her from the
father and sisters and brothers, whose presence would have been
the crowning glory in the apotheosis of her career.</p>
<p>For those who happily are familiar with her art, as well as
for those who know it not, the foregoing record of her career
will, it is hoped, be not entirely without value.</p>

<h3>MELBA'S ADVICE ON THE SELECTION OF MUSIC AS A PROFESSION</h3>
<p><span class="aa">It</span> having been represented to me that
a public expression of my views on the question of young
aspirants entering on the study of music in foreign lands might
serve in some measure as a corrective to the admitted unwarranted
exodus, I gladly join my voice with those who have already
endeavoured to remedy an evil the extent of which is little known
outside the circle of the victims themselves. Where an English or
American student of music has adequate financial means and a
reasonable quota of common sense, I would strongly recommend a
period of foreign study, for whether the natural musical
endowment of such a student be small or great, nothing but
benefit can result from the experience. The youth or maiden of
circumscribed talents will soon be made to realize the
limitations of his or her qualifications, and while this advent
of truth may be claimed to have a salutary effect on the
mediocrity, it also invariably awakens the greatly gifted to that
broader understanding which is the basis of genuine art.</p>
<p>The message, however, which I am now sending to the British
and American student is particularly addressed to the
inexperienced girls of the Empire and of the great Western
Republic who, without the necessary financial means, and having
no friendly circle in the foreign cities to which they journey,
too often become the victims of their own temerity, and help to
add to the prosperity of the ever-increasing circle of
unprincipled agents and teachers. Just here I should like to say
that few people show greater patience with, and kindness to, the
most obscure of their clients than do the established concert and
opera agents and teachers of Europe and the United Kingdom; but,
unfortunately, it is not by these men and women of repute that
the over-anxious and ill-equipped student of music elects to be
advised. The essential elements of the position make it
otherwise.</p>
<p>To the young American or English girl hungering for musical
study in Europe I can only repeat what I have been already called
upon to say to the young people of Australia, where the abundance
of admirable voices has led to something like a human stampede to
the old country. There, as in America, it has become the custom
to send to Italy, France, Germany, or England any girl or youth
who exhibits some degree of musical precocity. The circumstances
in both countries are analogous. In the majority of cases the
American amateur is sent out on a mission of research and
conquest, through the ignorant enthusiasm and prejudice of
relatives and friends who have no means of knowing the moral and
physical humiliation and suffering to which their incompetent
advice helps to consign those who are its dupes.</p>
<p>Britain and America have contributed a creditable contingent
to the ranks of famous artists, and may be expected to
consistently continue, even improve on, that contribution. Yet it
is incidental to these successes that there exists a multitude of
failures. In the contemplation of those who have reaped a lavish
measure of success, the lamentably and incomparably greater
number who sink to obscurity&mdash;or worse&mdash;are allowed to
pass unnoticed. Only those who have succeeded are considered, and
emulation of the elect supplies a never-ending and
ill-conditioned procession of novices in pursuit of ready
honours. If there exists a royal road to triumph, it is found
almost as rarely as the blossoms of the century plant&mdash;too
seldom to be of any use as a practical help to the vast majority,
most of whom make their search blindfold.</p>
<p>The average English and American student, like those of my own
country, arrives in Europe without the measure of talent and the
supply of money indispensable to a European career (for even
those specially gifted require financial means to tide them
comfortably over the necessary term of study and waiting), and in
numerous cases the unfortunate aspirant sinks to a deplorable
condition of poverty and despair. In the different large foreign
cities, I have known, and still know, numerous instances where
young Britishers and Americans have arrived full of ardent hopes,
fostered by the foolish laudation of careless or ignorant
friends, but who, in a condition of penury, are ready to accept
relief from any kindly disposed source. A very brief interval too
often separates the heyday of their joyous anticipation from the
gloom of their shattered dreams.</p>
<p>The lot of these unsuccessful students is peculiarly hard, as
they have generally cut themselves adrift from home and friends
and old associations, and journeyed great distances, to find the
unavoidable goal of failure, through the routine of misery and
privation. The students who are not fortunate very naturally try
to hide all evidence of their failure, especially in the land of
their birth, and in this way hundreds of other aspirants are led
to stumble on, under the old illusion as to easy laurels.</p>
<p>Little more than a year ago, Mr. James E. Dunning, the United
States Consul at Milan, through the Department of Commerce and
Labour at Washington, brought before the American people the
calamitous condition of numbers of young Americans who had
travelled to Italy in quest of musical fame. In his moderate and
well-considered report, Mr. Dunning dwelt on the hardships to
which these young people are constantly reduced through the
inherent difficulties of their arduous
undertaking&mdash;difficulties intensified a thousandfold by the
snares spread for them by the designing hangers-on of the
profession. What is true of Milan is true in a somewhat similar
degree of Paris, Berlin, London, Vienna, and the other great
cities, where private and official sources are constantly being
appealed to for the assistance of these bankrupt students.</p>
<p>The germ of the trouble is the over-confidence of the aspirant
who refuses to be advised, and declines to profit by the wretched
experience of others who have tried and failed. Each novice, in
the thraldom of inexperience, believes that his or her case will
be the exception to the quoted rule, and to those who point out
that passable proficiency in amateur efforts may not be capable
of the expansion necessary to professional success, an impatient
ear is turned by the ambitious though inept student.</p>
<p>Carried away by the outward glamour of a successful artist's
life, they set at naught the counsel of those who would guide
them, attribute the sober views of their advisers to
over-anxiety, and invariably suggest that it is such interference
that has wrecked the career of many an embryo genius. Of the many
called, they may be of the few chosen, is their argument; and so
they rush on, learning too late the supreme difficulties, if not
the hopelessness, of their quest.</p>
<p>Different other causes contribute to this regrettable state of
affairs, among them the exaggerated importance which many people,
besides the performer, attach to the satisfactory rendering of a
little drawing-room music, the facility with which accounts of
these and other petty little efforts are circulated as successes
in some newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic, and the general
but decreasing unwillingness of the American and English
public&mdash;as represented by their resident managers&mdash;to
accept musicians of purely local renown in the most important
music rôles. These three causes are in the main responsible for
the numbers of disheartened dependents who, year after year, make
a most undesirable addition to the American and British colonies
in the chief centres of Europe.</p>
<p>The girl or youth&mdash;but more especially the
girl&mdash;whose accomplishments expand to their utmost
attractiveness under the genial influence of the home circle, is
too often the one who is least fitted for the struggles, the
labours, the sacrifices of a professional career, especially when
entered on in a foreign land. The very qualities which are her
strength in the world of her sympathetic friends become her
weakness in the too often blighting sphere of cold, or designing,
or indifferent strangers. It is not easy to imagine a sadder lot
than that of the young musical aspirants whose once ardent hopes
are wrecked in an alien land. All their efforts have been
directed towards an illusion, and the training on which they have
spent their available time and money, instead of being a help, is
an actual hindrance to their advance in any of the rougher walks
of life. In this way valuable human energy is wasted, and
individuals and families who might have been made happy through
its proper direction are reduced to humiliating, even degrading,
conditions of dependence. The parents and friends of any average
amateur of music should well weigh their words before encouraging
any such performer to enter into a professional life, either at
home or abroad. The satisfactory rendering of a solo at a family
soiree or local concert is not sufficient indication of
qualifications for a career where brains, courage, tact,
industry, resolution, and physical vigour are at least as
essential to success as a beautiful voice or exceptional
technique.</p>
<p>I would, therefore, advise greater wisdom in the selection of
candidates. More care should be taken not to send abroad students
whose talents are never likely to justify the enterprise, and in
no case should the novices be allowed to depart without
sufficient money to carry them in comfort through an extended
term of study and probation.</p>
<p>Then, again. Press opinions on students' efforts at concerts
got up for experimental purposes are almost always, and of
necessity, misleading. The young singers or players naturally
select the two or three numbers in which they are calculated to
appear to most advantage; no performer likely to clash with them
in any way is given a place on the programme; the hall is packed
with interested friends whose enthusiasm creates a false
atmosphere, which not unreasonably leads the less experienced
critic&mdash;who is generally selected for minor
events&mdash;into writing a notice somewhat more encouraging than
his calmer judgment would endorse.</p>
<p>The arranged absence of any superior talent, the ardent
applause of prejudiced friends, and the kindly opinion of a
critic ready to make the best of what to him is an unimportant
occasion, are the points incidental to these entertainments that
count towards the summary of their success.</p>
<p>One of these concerts is often allowed to dictate the decision
as to a career, yet they are almost always but well-meant efforts
at forcing a selection which should never be made.</p>
<p>When the selection has been made, however, and the young
aspirant goes abroad, and becomes the centre of one or two
similar musical exploits in Paris, London, or Berlin, it is then
that special evil is wrought by the misleading reports sent to
the homeland by careless but kindly correspondents. The young
amateurs who remained at home, and who had no very flattering
opinion of those who had been sent abroad, on reading of the
latter's success, form a hasty opinion as to the ease with which
the great musical world is conquered, and straightway enter on
the task themselves. The ubiquitous duties of foreign
correspondents too often make it incumbent on them to accept
second-hand information, and in this manner even the most
conscientious among them are sometimes misled. I would urge on
all contributors to the Press the wisdom of carefully editing
every story of musical success which happens to be outside their
own personal knowledge. In this way I believe much could be done
to alleviate the conditions to which Mr. Consul Dunning and
others have called attention.</p>
<p>As for the American apathy towards the native-born musician
whose gifts have not been sponsored by the European public, it
reveals a condition which has a parallel at least in all
English-speaking communities. I suppose few would dispute that
the greatest of American artists are those who have won
recognition in foreign lands, and in that way the preference for
such, however much to be regretted, may be said to be based on
the selection epitomized in "the survival of the fittest." In the
days to come, when music as an inspiration and recreation of the
people will have an older pedigree in Great Britain and America,
the public of these countries will probably be more ready to
abide by their own verdict in the creation of their favourites,
and perhaps show some of that ardent preference for the artists
of their own race which is manifested by the peoples of Italy,
France, and Germany.</p>
<p>The higher the standard of the British and American music
institutions, and the greater the efficiency of the professors
engaged therein, the sooner will the element of unreason be
minimized in the British and American preference for music
artists of foreign reputation. England and America are already
fortunate in the possession of great facilities for the
cultivation of music, but there are numerous opportunities for
the extension and higher development of these facilities, many of
them provided for in the newly formed British Musical League and
in Madame Nordica's admirable American proposition. In her
proposal there is the elemental basis of a great national
conservatoire, which would supply local students with additional
stimulus, and save many of them from the disappointments and
hardships which so often fall to their lot in foreign cities.</p>
<p>I imagine that some of Madame Nordica's critics have taken the
reference to Bayreuth too literally. Personally, I see no reason
why an American national home for opera, embodying some of the
best features of Bayreuth, should not be a matter of
accomplishment, and as such become a splendid help to great
numbers of students. But my interest lies specially in the phase
of her scheme which deals directly with tuition. It is impossible
to outline exactly every detail in the preliminary summary of
such an undertaking, but the setting up of any centre of musical
education formulated on lines that aim at the highest
results&mdash;always remembering my strong plea for individual,
in preference to class, tuition&mdash;and where the greatest
teachers of Europe might be induced to preside for certain terms,
is a step that should appeal largely to the American people. It
would give the student, the manager, and the public greater
confidence in the home-developed singer or instrumentalist, and
in this way alone would do something to correct the unreasonable
exodus of music aspirants with which I am specially dealing.</p>
<p>I am also glad to have this opportunity of expressing my
interest in Mr. Henry Savage's plan, which has resulted in the
establishment of a Paris bureau where American musicians in
Europe are able to secure desired information and advice, and I
hope some English enthusiast may be induced to follow his
example. At this centre Mr. Savage's staff keep a record of all
young students arriving from America, and provide lists of
teachers, schools, agents, managers, coaches, accompanists,
translators, diction masters, and places of abode to which they
may go assured of fair dealing and friendly reception. As matters
have existed up to now, even the students of exceptional talents,
on the completion of their musical education, have too often
drifted into sad obscurity for want of competent guidance.</p>
<p>Still harder has been the fate of the student whose gifts are
but of the average order. Should the bureau be continued on the
lines which Mr. Savage's own high personal reputation warrants
one in assuming, there can be no doubt but that it will confer
incalculable benefit on numbers of worthy young Americans, whose
ambition leads them to respond to the uncertain call of European
competition.</p>
<br>
<p>For all young British and American amateurs having sufficient
means to see them in comfort through a term of foreign study, but
more especially those possessing exceptional natural gifts, I, of
course, strongly urge the advantage of a term of residence and
research in the great music centres of the old world. The study
of the French, German, and Italian languages, so necessary to the
operatic artist, is always more thoroughly carried out in the
countries where they are the native tongue. The chances to study
under the most famous masters, and the opportunities to hear the
greatest works interpreted by the greatest artists, are also
comparatively easy and numerous in Europe, while in the
atmosphere of the famous seats of music there is an incentive
which no other condition can so surely supply.</p>
<p>For the student of mediocre talent and little money these
advantages, however, are entirely overshadowed by the privations
and disappointments which, in their case, are but the preliminary
to failure. I repeat, then, that the greatest discretion should
be exercised in the nomination of students for European study,
and I insist that even an unusual voice or admirable technique is
not in itself sufficient to warrant an undertaking, the success
of which, apart from liberal expenditure, also demands several
exceptional qualities of body and mind.</p>

<h3>MELBA ON THE SCIENCE OF SINGING</h3>
<p><span class="aa">Musical</span> knowledge continues to spread
with rapidity and effect, but I think the greater chances of
success thus opened to numbers of followers is very
largely&mdash;too largely&mdash;discounted by the scores of inept
executants and professors who, without even the most ordinary
qualifications, proclaim themselves teachers and interpreters of
an art which demands in its apostles the fitness of very liberal
attainments. What should be a learned profession is recklessly
overcrowded by ignorant exponents, who are inconceivably accepted
even by those who would vehemently resent any semblance of
charlatanism in any other serious calling. The unqualified
performer is the natural result of the unqualified teacher, and
while no test of ability is exacted from the vast body of
professors, so long will music suffer through the ignorance of
its adherents.</p>
<p>Many amateurs, and especially women, are no doubt attracted to
the profession of music by the high, perhaps extravagant, rates
of remuneration paid to successful performers and teachers. It is
something of an anomaly that a field where the monetary
appreciation is so high should be the one where proven fitness is
not essential to entry. If we had more competent teachers, we
should have more great singers; and I shall never cease to urge
the necessity of placing the tuition of singing on a more
exclusive basis than that on which it now exists. The
acknowledged professors in all the great cities should resort to
some means to shut out from their ranks the tyros whose research
too often does not extend beyond the superficial smattering
gleaned in a year or two from questionable authorities.</p>
<p>In all other learned professions&mdash;and even in mechanical
callings&mdash;different technical tests are imposed before a
person is accepted as an authority in that profession or calling.
In music the insistence on any test is, unhappily, not the rule,
but the exception; especially is this the case in
English-speaking colonies and communities. Casual observation,
backed up by unlimited confidence, too often suffices to win a
large measure of public support, the charlatan, by the very
essence of his method, having a much more easy course than the
cultured specialist, who has made a heavy outlay of time, talent,
and money in obtaining qualifying knowledge.</p>
<p>It is my practice to hear as many young singers as possible in
the different cities I visit, also in London, the city of my
home, and everywhere I am grieved by the injury I see done
through ignorant tuition, for in the vast majority of cases I
find methods in vogue which are entirely at variance with the
health of the delicate vocal cords. We do not accept tuition in
architecture, chemistry, or law from any casual dabbler in these
professions, but we welcome the gospel of vocalization from those
who have not even a perfunctory acquaintance with the science of
singing. Students should remember that a good general knowledge
of music does not imply a knowledge of voice-production based on
scientific principles, and until they come to look for that
scientific basis in their teachers, nondescript singers will
continue to be crowded on a patient, perhaps culpable, public.
Physiological principles are the necessary groundwork of correct
vocalization. Through them defects are more surely detected and
remedied, and the restoration or development of a maimed or
immature organ definitely achieved. Physiology is absolutely
essential to preserve the health of the vocal organs and protect
the voice from injurious influences; but in saying this it must
be understood that I am dealing with the science, not the soul,
of song.</p>
<p>Having said so much about incompetent teachers, I return to
the question of inept pupils. Too many girls and youths are
encouraged to adopt music as a profession merely because of its
gentility as a means of livelihood, or because their voices have
contributed to the pleasure of the family circle, where the
compliments of a few relations or friends are taken as sufficient
warranty of fitness for a professional career. Before young vocal
aspirants decide on this difficult undertaking, I strongly
recommend the seeking of high and unprejudiced counsel,
preferably from a singer who is familiar with the requirements
and difficulties of the calling, and who is intimate with the
conditions which obtain in the great centres of music. In
endeavouring to arrive at a decision, it is well to remember that
there are more failures through lack of common sense than through
lack of talent. The person who aims at a public career,
especially in opera, must have character supported by reason and
control, otherwise the progress which a good voice and certain
technical knowledge temporarily insure always stops short of
great results. I freely acknowledge the value of opportunity, and
if opportunity knocks but once at most men's doors, it is
ostensibly of primary importance to be prepared for that call.
Even that <i>rara avis</i>, the born singer, might dissipate
Heaven-sent gifts for want of opportunity, while the vocalist of
highly cultivated talent might never emerge from obscurity
without it. Conditions of musical knowledge and physical health
being equal, the student of alert mind, who is prepared for her
chance, and goes some way to meet it, is the one who is surest of
success.</p>
<p>Mental lethargy is fatal to advancement, and no young musician
has a right to rely for preferment on the exertions of others.
Those who have attained the qualifications of technical equipment
essential to success, and who do not achieve it, are generally
those who fail to strike out for themselves. Industry as well as
knowledge is necessary to the successful novice, and no one is
justified in the belief that she or he will sing by inspiration,
no matter how prodigal Nature may have been in the bestowal of
her gifts. And if diligence is essential for the highest
development of the born singer, it must be regarded as of a
thousandfold greater importance to the vocalist whose endowments
fall short of that inspired creature.</p>
<p>One of the first fields for the employment of the beginner's
energy is physiology. No student should be content to proceed
without gaining a reasonable knowledge of the anatomy of the
throat and the sensitive and complicated physical mechanism that
produce the singing voice. For myself, I at one time became so
completely absorbed in this study that I could practically
neither think nor speak of anything else. An understanding of the
delicate functions of voice mechanism is a rational and logical
plea for perfection in singing, and was always embodied in the
methods of the old Italian masters, whose general accuracy has
been reduced to a much surer science by some of their present-day
followers. Those who know the structure of the larynx and the
muscular mechanism of the parts called into action by the
production of the voice, will find themselves in possession of
knowledge essential to correct attack. The application of the
air-blast to the vocal cords should be a detail of exact science,
not a haphazard circumstance. In a warm general recommendation of
the old Italian method, I do not hesitate to condemn the white
voice and tremolo so favoured by some Italian singers.</p>
<p>Great success in singing is impossible to the vocalist who
does not thoroughly understand breathing, attack, the use of the
registers, the structure and functions of the parts above the
voice-box, and the relation of chest expansion to the production
of tone. As I have so often said, a beautiful voice is only the
basis of vocal progress, in the perfection of which correct
breathing is the greatest technical essential. Faulty breathing
can even negative the expression of noble thought which a
soulful, but incompetent, performer may be struggling to put into
his work. It is utterly impossible to demonstrate in song the
beauty of either a singer's voice or mind without proper breath
control. Tone, expression, resonance, phrasing, are all dependent
on respiration, and girls and boys of musical tastes, even when
too young to be permitted the free use of their voices, should be
fully taught the principles of taking breath.</p>
<p>During the years of childhood and adolescence the science of
breathing is a peculiarly appropriate study, for, other
conditions apart, correct breathing is highly conducive to good
health, and owing to the greater elasticity of the body during
the growing years, the chest is then much more readily developed
and expanded. As the diaphragm is the chief muscle of
inspiration, special care should be devoted to any exercises that
promote its strength. Expiration is considerably more difficult
of control than inspiration, and consequently calls for the most
careful practice.</p>
<p>Exact vibration of the vocal cords can never be secured where
the breathing is hurried or faulty, and any conditions likely to
produce either should be rigidly avoided, particularly at the
time of a singer's first entrance on the stage or concert
platform, which even under the happiest circumstances is always a
moment of nervousness and doubt. The timid singer will always
find her forces strengthened on such occasions by taking a few
very deep breaths on stepping before the public, and by choosing
for the opening number&mdash;where a choice is
possible&mdash;music that is free from exacting initial bars.</p>
<p>To my mind, a girl should never enter on the serious routine
of voice culture until she is seventeen years of age. Before that
time even a moderate share of work is likely to interfere with
the proper development of the vocal organs, and perhaps cause
certain injury. Only the other day Madame Mathilde Marchesi
recalled the fact that the too frequent use of her marvellous
voice in youth had prematurely impaired the middle register of
Jenny Lind. If one so divinely gifted as she suffered through
prodigal use of the voice during her early years, how imperative
must be the necessity for care in the case of those whose
endowments fall immeasurably below her unique standard!</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have to-day several artists of
world-wide fame who, because of a reasonable economy of their
vocal means in their young days, and their consistent adherence
to a correct method, are singing as freshly now as they did
twenty years ago, while others, who started with equal or greater
natural endowments, have become painfully defective in their
artistic work through ignorant use of the vocal organs.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* During the trial of the Horspool versus
Gumming musical libel suit heard at the Royal Courts of Justice,
London, in February, 1908, Dr. Milsom Rees, the famous throat
specialist, whose patients include all the greatest contemporary
singers of Europe and America, was called as a witness. In reply
to a question from the examining counsel as to the unusual
retention of an unimpaired singing voice by some of these
artists, Dr. Rees said: "It is the result of elasticity in the
ligamentous portion of their vocal cords. The most elastic vocal
cord to-day is Madame Melba's. She makes use of the anterior
portion of the cord, and that accounts for the lasting quality of
her voice. She knowingly uses head notes instead of chest notes.
It is an automatic process. A scale can be sung by putting the
full tension on the reeds, or varying from the long reed to the
short.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;. In the
case of Madame Melba, there is no singer with more resonance and
less nasal quality."]</p>
<p>A most helpful factor in the study of music, especially for an
operatic career, is a knowledge of foreign languages, and as they
can always be most successfully acquired in the countries where
they are the native tongue, I consider that a sufficient reason
for the advocacy of foreign study. Terms of residence in the
music centres of Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Russia, and the
consequent familiarity with the work and traditions of the great
masters of these countries, give the student a certainty, an
authority, in her work which cannot be obtained in any other way.
The subtleties and complexities of the art more easily possess
the mind where music has long been fostered, and where it has
become part of the national life, rather than the luxury, or
perhaps affectation, of a class.</p>
<p>All these countries possess great teachers of singing, but I
personally consider Madame Mathilde Marchesi, of Paris, the
greatest of them all. I repeat my oft-expressed opinion that she
is a marvel of scientific method, a most remarkable personality
for whose place no city of the world has yet revealed a probable
successor. Through the elder Garcia, who developed his method
from the tenets of the earlier great Italian masters, Mathilde
Marchesi conceived the spirit of her own principle of tuition,
which may be roughly indicated in a few words: "Change to the
middle notes on F. Begin the head notes on F sharp. Once on the
head notes, always practise pianissimo."</p>
<p>Madame Lilli Lehmann I hold to be the greatest teacher of
German vocal art. Every Italian city boasts of highly qualified
masters, and if I were dealing with the possibilities of vocal
tuition in London, I could name several most admirable teachers.
In my own studies I have been most fortunate, for in the operatic
rôles with which I am most closely identified I have had the
invaluable assistance of the composers themselves&mdash;Gounod,
Verdi, Delibes, Ambroise Thomas, Leoncavallo, Puccini, Massenet,
Saint-Saëns. Holding, as I do, that the singer's mission is to
interpret the message of the composer, and not to mutilate or
embellish it with extraneous ideas, I naturally consider the
opportunity of securing the composer's assistance as a fortunate
chance which cannot be too highly appreciated.</p>
<p>From the outset I advise young singers to look after the
posing of the voice. They will know better than anybody where the
break occurs, and they must see that the teacher does not adopt
an extreme course in the endeavour to bridge it over prematurely.
Any attempt at unduly precipitating the blending of the registers
must result in injury to the voice&mdash;indeed, permanent injury
is in this way often done during the initial stages of vocal
study. Some enthusiasts have described my own voice as of one
register.* I mention this to draw attention to the result that
may be achieved by careful thought and industry, and as an
incentive to the many students who discredit the possibility of
hiding the natural break.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The late Sir Morell Mackenzie, the eminent
throat specialist, thought that Melba used the same register
throughout the voice.]</p>
<p>I am a great believer in the wisdom of fully recognizing every
novice's individuality, but the general rule as to the register
changes is a safe one for almost every student. There are
exceptions, of course, and, as for myself, I carry my chest
register up to F and change on F sharp, which is half a tone
beyond the usual limit. When I went to Madame Marchesi, she at
once recognized this natural peculiarity, and allowed for it in
the scheme of my tuition, her discernment giving me a speedy
chance to demonstrate that exceptional register changes do not
constitute a bar to success. One point of guidance easy of
remembrance is that any method that tires a student, that entails
a sense of strain, is sure to be wrong.</p>
<p>The most valuable voices often present the most striking
superficial difficulties, and only the most accomplished teachers
should be entrusted with the task of their removal. It often
happens that even where the voice is properly posed, there still
remains a weakness where the registers change, and bad teachers
frequently endeavour to produce an enlargement of tone by
constant practice of this feeble section of the voice. I am
strongly opposed to this policy, and I urge equal exercise of the
whole organ as the best method of securing uniformity of tone.
But if there should persistently remain a natural blemish, far
better to retain the voice with its trifling inherent weakness,
than chance its entire destruction through the enforcement of a
tax which Nature indicates as oppressive. During the development
of the average voice, scales, solfeggios, and vocalization over
its entire range are absolutely essential to its proper growth;
but once the period of vocal maturity is reached, I am sure all
students who sing in public will be wise to reserve their voices
as much as possible in private.</p>
<p>Young aspirants often write to me, and in commenting on the
freshness of my voice and the spontaneity of my singing, assume
that these conditions are the result of some occult knowledge
entirely outside the possibility of their achievement. The secret
lies in the fact that I never taxed my voice in the way peculiar
to the great majority of inexperienced vocalists. My gospel has
been to give the body ample exercise, and the voice ample rest.
This, as I have indicated, is particularly necessary for the
students who have already begun to sing in public.</p>
<p>Before even attempting to hum over any music, I am always
careful to phrase it on the keyboard and commit it to memory.
Young singers too often take a new song or rôle to the piano,
and, without any knowledge of it, begin to use and waste the
voice in a preliminary that could be equally well accomplished on
a mechanical instrument. They chop and hack at their voices, not
in any effort at vocal accomplishment, but merely for the purpose
of memorizing. It is only when the words and music are firmly
engraved on my mind that I use my voice on them, and even then I
spare it as much as possible by practising the top notes quite
pianissimo, except on the rare occasions at rehearsal where the
full voice is needed. Practising high notes forte is one of the
most pernicious customs of vocal study, and as a general rule it
may be safely laid down that it invariably minimizes the
possibility of those refined, soft effects which are not only a
charm, but a necessity, to artistic singing. During practice
students should always hold their forces well in reserve, and if
they sing the upper register pianissimo in private, they will
find that the forte effects will readily respond when public
performances demand it. On the days when I sing in opera or
concert I run through a few scales in full voice during the
morning, and if I cannot sing top D perfectly I consider myself
out of form.* Just before going on I try my voice again for a few
seconds, to warm it.</p>
<p class="foot">[* The range of Melba's voice is three octaves,
terminating on the high F sharp.]</p>
<p>Apart from the scientific necessity for proper economy of
vocal means, I wish to point out that the general muscles of the
body become slack in the case of students who spend half the day
or more sitting or standing by a piano, wearing out their vocal
and physical resources in a mistaken endeavour at advancement. A
beautiful voice, beautifully used, can only continue to come from
a healthy body, and their cause would be far better served if
they gave much of their wasted time to indulgence in open-air
exercise.</p>
<p>An excess of diligence might easily become a hindrance rather
than a help, and as robust health is an essential to any large
measure of success, anything that impairs the physical vigour
should be rigidly avoided. Happily, there is a great deal in a
singer's life conducive to bodily strength, the most important
being the strong and consistent use of the breathing apparatus,
which in itself is almost sufficient to counteract such
degenerating influences as late hours, night travelling,
concentrated efforts, and the disappointments which, owing to the
caprice of the public, the singer, the weather, or from other
causes, must be reckoned with in every career. Many students, in
their eagerness for musical headway, entirely neglect their
physical welfare, and forget that plenty of fresh air, simple,
nourishing food, and eight or nine hours' sleep are all necessary
to the young singer, whose larynx invariably reflects her bodily
condition. Common-sense regard for the individual requirements is
almost the only dictum needed in this particular, and the student
who has based her studies on physiological principles will have
early learned the delicacy of her vocal organs and the course
necessary for their protection. I personally greatly favour fruit
and vegetables as an important item in the regular régime. For
breakfast I take only toast and tea; at luncheon a cutlet, or a
little chicken, with a light salad and fruit, but no rich dishes.
My chief meal is dinner, which I have rather late&mdash;7.45 or 8
o'clock&mdash;and there is nothing to distinguish it from the
same meal in the average household. When I am singing in the
evening, I do not dine, but have a very light repast consisting
of either fish or chicken, or sweetbread, with a baked apple and
a glass of water at 5 o'clock, and I always find myself very
hungry for supper when I get home from the opera or concert. On
the evenings when I am not singing or entertaining, I am always
in bed by half-past 10 o'clock, sometimes earlier.</p>
<p>My views on the value of individual training are well known,
and carry with them a consequent opposition to class tuition. It
is impossible for a singing student to give out her best as one
of a group directed by a supervision which must in its very
essence partake of the perfunctory The singers who have succeeded
after class training have been those whose personality and
endowments have made them independent of circumstances, reliance
on choir or chorus singing as a helpful factor in the early
period of vocal study I hold to be a most unwise course, as an
unplaced voice may easily be permanently injured by its free
employment in any such body. The following of any trade or
profession during the early years of study is a very questionable
economy', giving, as it does, to some extraneous interest the
vitality which should be the treasure-house of the vocal
organs.</p>
<p>Every grade of student may safely follow all phases of tuition
where the voice is not called into use in the classes of the
admirable colleges and conservatoires now existent in every large
community. I think all singers should make a thorough study of
the piano, harmony, and counterpoint, which are as important in
the expression of music as is grammar to the spoken or written
language. The most serious study begins when the student comes
before the public, a study which must be endless; but if a young
singer is not able to make a promising public début after
eighteen months' legitimate work, then, in my opinion, she will
never make any great success in her profession. Many British and
American students are inclined to regard a fairly successful
public appearance as an indication that future research is
unnecessary, and so find themselves unable to escape from the
chains of mediocrity.</p>
<p>The drama should be carefully cultivated by the vocal novice,
and as a collateral aid, both to the science and art of singing,
nothing counts for more than intimacy with the work of the great
artists of the day. No opportunity should be missed of hearing
and seeing famous singers and actors in their most important
rôles. What an inspiration, too, comes to all who have a soul for
music when they hear some famous conductor lead a fine body of
musicians through a great masterpiece by Beethoven, Bach, Mozart,
Brahms, or Wagner! No matter what branch of music a student may
aim at mastering, every chance of hearing the best in opera,
orchestra, recital, or oratorio should be eagerly seized on and
seriously considered. Speaking for myself, I am always inspired
and helped by every noble interpretation I hear, and into my own
succeeding work I seem able to put something I had not so
perfectly understood before.</p>
<p>The technique of singing is incalculably helped by everything
that improves the intellectual calibre, so the ambitious student
should read not only all that is authoritative and informative on
music, but become familiar with the beauties of general
literature and art, and the wonders of natural science. The power
of interpretation is immensely helped by a fine imagination,
which comes easiest from a mind illuminated and beautified by
wide culture. The singer who can appreciate great pictures,
poetry, and statuary, who can reasonably apprehend the glories of
the mountains, the forest, and the ocean, can more surely fathom
the joys and sorrows of the human heart than the one who is
merely well informed on affairs of music.</p>
<p>And now I feel myself drifting from the surer ground of
science towards the indefinable sphere of art, the elusive
qualities of which are beyond the pale of this article. I am
convinced that the art of song lies outside the possibility of
human generation, and that only those who are born to this subtle
heritage can ever reach the topmost heights. It is impossible for
any teacher to impart temperament or an unerring musical ear, but
even these God-given gifts, and the minor endowments of mind and
body, can be developed and enhanced to a remarkable degree by the
intelligent and consistent application of those who seek to make
themselves and others happier and better through the profession
of music.</p>
<p>Neither do the entire powers of the artist come to anyone as a
completed gift; the ideal balance of the mental and physical
faculties must be a matter of slow development fostered by
manifold influences. This attainment should, therefore, be the
aim of everyone who seriously enters on the study of singing, for
in its pursuit may be revealed, even where not suspected, that
soulful spark which illumines with a mystic torch the work of the
truly great. Perfection of technique is but the stepping-stone to
the high plane of repose, where, after many vicissitudes, the
student is transformed into the artist; but then, in that day of
self-determining realities, the artist must still remain the
servant, as well as the master, of technique.</p>
