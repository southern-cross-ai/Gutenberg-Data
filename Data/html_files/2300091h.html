<h2>Ebook editor's note</h2>

<p>In a review, by W. E. Fitz Henry, of "The Books of the Bulletin"
by Mackaness and Stone, which appeared in <i>The Bulletin</i>, Vol.
76 No. 3940 (17 Aug 1955, page 27), it is stated:</p>

<p>"The first Bulletin book listed by Mackaness and Stone in their
'The Books of the Bulletin', published in 1955, is 'The History of
Botany Bay' (1888), a reprint of a series of articles written for
<i>The Bulletin</i> by F J Donohoe under the pen-name of 'Arthur
Gayll.' It was illustrated by Livingston Hopkins and Phil May, and
was intended as a satirical counterblast to the smug histories
published to commemorate the centenary of New South Wales. Over
20,000 copies were published, but a single copy is hard to obtain
these days."</p>

<p>There is no list of references provided by Gayll, though
occasionally he quotes from works of others, such as Joseph Holt,
and occasionally refers to his sources for statements made. Still,
there is ample evidence provided for his descriptions of the
"punishments" inflicted on the convicts and the actions of the so
called "Vested Interests" which operated to ensure the continuation
of the penal system in the early days of the English Colony at
Botany Bay. It is a harrowing story!</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/03-introduction.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p>Every year in Australia sees another stage in the formation of a
population as different from that of thirty or forty years ago as
that of the United States of to-day is from the early Spanish
settlers, or the Pilgrim fathers of New England. A history of
Australia has not been written for the new people yet. These new
people are the nucleus of the coming Australian nation&mdash;not
the descendants of old Imperial officialdom, or of the people whom
that officialdom ruled. Unfortunately, however, the traditions of
the past survive in Australia, while the events that fathered those
traditions are forgotten. The result is that Young Australia finds
itself dominated by the surviving remnant of a class whoso history
will make the Australian people of the near future burn their
records and pray for a tidal wave.</p>

<p>A look-out on Australia to-day will disclose a strange state of
things. Upwards of three millions of people, in one of the finest
countries in the world, have a chance in the struggle for existence
the peer of which no other spot on the globe save Eden has ever
seen. But these three millions of people, with their popular
democratic institutions, are governed in the interests of a small
class by a little knot of men who rule in the name of the people
but on the lines of the strictest and narrowest conservatism. We
have in Australia our manhood suffrage, vote by ballot, the jury
system, popular legislatures, and all the marks of an advanced
political spirit. Yet side by side with these we have, rankly
flourishing and openly encouraged, all the inequality of social
conditions, the invidious class distinctions, the great monopolist
property in land, the old feudal spirit in our property laws, and
the mark of the same old familiar bloody hand in our penal
legislation, that the free institutions we have just named were
deliberately invented by English Liberals as political weapons to
destroy.</p>

<p>The crude anomalousness of all this is patent. But it only
requires to be looked at through the history of the past to be at
once whistled down the wind. We have clothed the ass's body of
social conditions and feudal-law traditions in the lion's hide of
pseudo-democratic institutions. When the lion is expected to roar,
we only hear the other animal bray. We are still ridden by the
influence and ruled by the lineal descendants of the squalid
officialdom of the grisly past. The whistle of the lash and the
clank of the convict's chain are still distinctly heard, though
fifty years have passed away since transportation ceased, and a
democracy of freemen has been settled by immigration in Australia.
The reason is, in a word, that the men of the class that came into
existence under the Imperial regime made the most of their time.
They founded family fortunes, and became territorial magnates and
lords of the soil. They seized on the ownership of land, and
established the principle of such ownership, and so consolidated a
power and an influence that have enabled them to hold their
position up to the present, and to buy up the dangerous leaders of
democracy, body and soul.</p>

<p>Australian public spirit touched its highest level in Victoria
under Graham Berry when he swept the country from end to end on an
election cry for the bursting-up of big estates. That is the pivot
on which the Australian politics of the future will turn. But the
question will never stand out in a white light until Young
Australia learns who the founders of big estates and vested
interests were, and how these estates and interests grew. Young
Australia will never learn <i>that</i> until the history of the
past is candidly and fearlessly told. But when it is told, and the
lesson learnt, then Young Australia will have also learnt the
profound truth that these colonies will never get rid of the taint
of a squalid officialdom, built up by the exercise of gaolers'
authority over a herd of cruelly-abused wretches whose crimes were
outweighed by their expiation, until the Imperial connection which
rivets the past on the present for us becomes an exploded myth, and
these colonies of ours form federated states under an independent
Australian flag. The Imperial connection keeps the Past in its
place. While it continues the public life of Australia will
continue to be ridden by the horror of the past&mdash;the nightmare
of our history as Sinbad the Sailor was by the Old Man of the Sea.
Australia's own history, fairly told, alone can strip the bandage
from her eyes. When that is once done the Imperial connection must
go.</p>

<p>This is why <i>The Bulletin</i> is going to tell the history of
Australia from its own point of view. The past has been veneered
over by wealth from the gold discovery, and by free institutions
that came full fifty years before their time. The Bulletin is going
to scrape off that veneer. It is time that the theories of the
people who want to engraft British feudalism on Australia were
tested by a cataclysmic visitation of fact. Flying literary
visitors like J. A. Froude mercilessly instruct us in our domestic
concerns in the light of a ten days' experience of one side of one
narrow colonial class alone. Two or three Australian politicians
meet in the cabin of an English admiral and concoct a conspiracy by
which British militarism shall be engrafted upon our system for
ever and a day. Shotted rifles menace a public meeting because
those who object to an address to the Queen on her Jubilee
outnumber those who don't. Politicians who claim to hold democratic
faiths threaten drastic legislation to crush the advocates of
unpopular views which are unpleasant to the ear of official
authority. And a surviving representative of Vandemonia proposes in
his old age "a whiff of grape" as his prescription for Young
Australia when she writhes under the intolerable burden of her Old
Man of the Sea. All this would be a screaming farce if it were not
so gruesomely serious. Our people's ignorance of our own people is
abysmal. We have had poets and politicians, preachers and
pseudo-patriots, penal laws and public institutions of a class the
like of winch&mdash;thank the gods!&mdash;have never been seen
before since the crust hardened on the earth. These phenomena
spring from certain pre-existing causes. If the hair of the reader
should happen to stand on end when we tell him what these grisly
causes were, we are not to blame. We did not make our history. We
only tell it. We merely flay the carcase of the hybrid and moribund
monstrosity now on our demonstrating table, and dissect the
congested organism underneath.</p>

<p class="cpb">THE HISTORY OF BOTANY BAY</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter I. What Providence
Intended.</h2>

<p>When Henry Kingsley wrote his book about Australia for British
readers, he told them of a great, lone, melancholy island in the
pleasant southern seas&mdash;the largest and possibly the grandest
island in the world. The land of lonely rivers and level gray
plains, he called it the land of wool and corn, incalculable to the
human mind; the land of gold and jewels. "Who were to have this
wondrous land?" he asks, "which lay for thousands of years asleep
in a summer sea, waiting for its owners." With all the purblind
saponaceousness that even good men exhibit when writing about
Australia, he gives the answer: "Providence designed that country
for us!"</p>

<p>If the Australian people of the near future know anything about
that matter, Providence designed nothing of the kind. It is only
the smug Englishman of the type that sung "Britons never shall be
slaves," while not one man in one thousand had a vote or a voice in
public affairs&mdash;who fought the battles of England abroad to
take his attention off his own domestic miseries at home, that
could answer for the designs of Providence in this flippant and
familiar manner. The John Bull of the past, who looked on the great
world-system of waters as a British lake, and on Divine Providence
itself as a vulgar British institution, alone could fall into such
an egregious error as that. If Providence had any design in the
matter at all it was that the great Australian continent should
belong to a great Australian people, ruling itself under its own
laws, and free as Providence possibly intended every man and every
nation to be. We can imagine Providence designing that a great
people should grow up here, with all the mistakes of old-world
legislation and class-traditions for its warning, and with all the
preventable old-world miseries, poverty, and ignorance that those
traditions and that legislation have developed into rank growth,
for its beacons of quicksands to be avoided. So much for Mr. Henry
Kingsley and his rapidly-expiring class.</p>

<p>Away back at the beginning of the tertiary period, Australia was
joined to China by a broad land-belt. Presently a convulsion of
nature occurred. The land-belt disappeared and water flowed in its
place.</p>

<p>Australia "cut the painter" and floated away, as it were, on its
own career of independence. Wallace's line on the map marks where
the rupture took place. Had it not occurred, we might have been all
Chinese to-day, with Australia twirling its pig-tail for the
Brother of the Sun instead of throwing up its hat for the lady who
is pre-eminent in grief and in wealth; and sitting at the feet of
the wise Confucius instead of burning incense to our Old Man of the
Sea.</p>

<p>But our Chinese cousins had another chance, and missed it. Long
after palaeolithic man had passed away, a Chinese junk burst into
these silent seas, with youth at the prow and pleasure at the helm,
to the sound of the inspiring tom-tom. Old legends tell how the
grisly apparition of these adventurous children of the Sun
affrighted our "peaceful southern ocean" like a nightmare, as it
passed on its mysterious way. We said just now that the Chinese had
their chance, and missed it. That was a rash assertion. The
enterprising navigator of that prehistoric junk, scanning the
future with dim prophetic eye, saw that Australia had better be
left for some other active persons to do the rough work of
colonisation, and after that his bland and patient Celestial
descendants might come along without ruffling an eye-lash, and
scoop the whole institution like the merest fan-tan pool. <i>He</i>
knew who it was Providence designed the "pot" for.</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">An early English discoverer.</p>

<p>The Chinese sharp-shooter sailed away. He was our prehistoric
ancestor, and doubtless his statue will occupy a vacant pedestal
by-and-bye, when those of Victoria Wettin and Albert the Good are
melted down into copper coin, to compensate the holders of great
freehold estates which will have been confiscated for the benefit
of the Australian people. When our ancestor faded away over the
horizon, the "great, lone, melancholy island" had a rest for a
time; and, by the way, when the reader digests this history he
won't wonder any more why it was "melancholy." Two hundred and
eighty-two years ago a picturesque Spanish freebooter, named De
Quiros, paid it a visit. He also went away. The Dutch looked in
about the same time. They also left&mdash;but in a hurry this time.
The unanimity our early visitors showed in going away is striking.
But to do these Dutchmen bare justice, they had good reason for
their action. Their reception, it appears, was not altogether
hospitable. The aboriginal inhabitants began to hatch a quaint
suspicion that Providence designed the great lone, melancholy
island for them. So they fell upon the crew of the Dutch yacht
<i>Duyfhen</i>, killed a few of the number, and picnicked airily on
the remains. The unpronounceable name of the vessel is their best
apology. It must be confessed that their notion about the design of
Providence was a crudely practical one.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/08-page-02-1.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">An early discoverer penetrating into the
interior.</p>

<p>But if the pure Chinese strain wasn't crossed with Dutch
blood&mdash;if we don't all wear wide knickerbockers and pig-tails
to-day and smoke big pipes and play the tom-tom&mdash;it is largely
owing to the patriotic action of those impulsive aboriginals, and
the hazy nature of their theological views. For the Dutch certainly
left Australian soil in some precipitation before De Quiros'
lieutenant struck Cape York and named Torres' Straits. In all
probability both expeditions imagined that Providence designed this
country for them. Dirk Hartog, another Dutchman, touched at
Endraght's Land ten years later. Quite a locust-flight of flying
Dutchmen found Australia in the next decade, from Zeachen down to
Peter Nuyts. Tasman's visit was in 1642. He wrote his sweetheart's
name all over the Australian map, and made it historical. This was
the only touch of tender human sentiment the Island now called
after him was destined to see for many a long day. In later times,
after the horror of our history had held its Saturnalian
orgy&mdash;when each blade of grass had its horrible story, and
every woodland nook reeked with the strong flavour of bloody
reminiscences&mdash;it was found advisable to destroy a good deal
of poor Tasman's lover's romance, and change the name of Maria Van
Diemen's father for one with somewhat less pungent associations. So
we called the island Tasmania&mdash;and complacently allowed the
rank growth of old institutions to flourish, while the name of
Vandemonia that recalled them too keenly became a thing of the
past. But though Tasman made several voyages there, Providence does
not appear to have designed any part of the country for him.</p>

<p>The buccaneer Dampier, of Virginia, was engaged in a piratical
expedition against some Spanish traders when he struck the
North-West coast of Australia. Eleven years after, the English
Admiralty authorities sent him out on a voyage of discovery. He had
several theological controversies with the aboriginal inhabitants
about the designs of Providence, and after his expedition nothing
more is recorded on that subject until 1770. In the meantime the
Spanish De Quiros had called the continent "Australia," while the
Dutch named it "New Holland." Fortunately the Spanish name was the
one eventually retained. Dampier came in 1688. It is well to remark
that persons engaged in piratical expeditions have been striking
the Australian coast very violently ever since.</p>

<p>It is a distressing but characteristic fact that the discovery
of the eastern coast of Australia was reserved for a person with
the unromantic name of Cook. We have always been unhappy in our
nomenclature. No one with an inspiriting name of his own would have
thought of calling his discovery by such an uncouth designation as
"New South Wales." And no people that did not glory in its disgrace
would have retained the name and its dismal associations so long.
But the trail of the serpent, as it were, is over all we do. Do we
soar into sentiment? Our airy flight is impeded by the dead-weight
of the past that hangs like plummets on our nobler parts&mdash;so
that we have to sacrifice the delicate flower of romance in the
story of Maria Van Diemen to the necessity of getting rid of the
association the name calls up. Do we, like Mr. Silas Wegg, drop
into poetry?</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/08-page-02-2.jpg" alt=

</p>

<p class="caption">Later Chinese discoveries.</p>

<p>Every bushman in this afflicted land scourges our ears with
damnable iteration of platitudinous phrases about the balmy
fragrance of the yellow wattle-bloom, until that Australian
vegetable has come to have no more romantic sentiment in
association with its name than the fatuous cabbage or the
hypocritical onion.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/08-page-02-3.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">A Dutch discoverer.</p>

<p>Cook decided the question that had perplexed so many explorers
without a moment's hesitation, and handed the country over to "my
Sovereign, George the Third," whose royal progeny&mdash;the Prince
of Wales and the Duke of York, uncles to Her Gracious&mdash;used to
tie their royal parent to the post of the royal bedstead and play
"bait the bear" with him in his dotage, and then go down to their
club and tell what fun they had with the old king. Greville tells
the story in his memoirs; and also how the Commons voted the Duke
of York a pension for his filial piety in visiting his demented
progenitor on these occasions. But what has this to do with Botany
Bay? you ask. Well, nearly everything. We are coming to it now.</p>

<p>It is time to revert to Henry Kingsley:&mdash;"At about this
time (1787) the British Government were beginning to find out that
hanging men for petty theft was a large mistake. Anyhow, hanging
did no good. Transportation was tried, and the great dominion of
Australia founded." This is crisply put, but its accord with the
"designs of Providence" theory is not apparent at a glance. The
simple fact of the matter is that the penal laws of England at the
time, and for fifty years after, were a black disgrace to
civilisation. Women and children were hanged for shop-lifting to
the value of a pocket-handkerchief. Black Monday opposite the
Debtor's Door at Newgate will not bear description. One writer has
this on a quite recent aspect of the subject:&mdash;"A public
execution in London was a scene to fill an observer with something
like loathing for the whole human race. Through all the long night
before the execution the precincts of the prison became a bivouac
ground for the ruffianism of the metropolis. The roughs, the
harlots, the professional robbers, and the prospective murderers
held high festival there. The air reeked with the smell of strong
drink, with filthy jokes and oaths and blasphemy. The moral effect
of the scene was about as great as the moral effect of a
cock-fight. The soul took its flight as if it were a trapeze
performer in a circus." The Government began to think it just as
well if some of them took their flight to New South Wales. The
American colonies, having just got their independence, refused any
more white labour. A philanthropic proposal to hand criminals over
to the slave-dealers of Morocco was made in a Christian country,
and rejected. Consignments were sent to the fever-coast of Africa,
where they died off like sheep, under the lash. So New South Wales
was founded.</p>

<p class="b">Page 3</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter II. What England
Decided.</h2>

<p>It was England that first seamed the white shoulder of Australia
with the livid mark of the lash. It is the people who wielded that
instrument of degradation, and their descendants, who wish to "draw
the bonds of Empire closer" to-day. The Imperial connection is,
therefore, a shameful one.</p>

<p>It was not a pleasant problem that confronted the British
Cabinet just three years before the French Revolution. A large
proportion of the population, cradled into crime by poverty and
ignorance, had been convicted of more or less serious offences. It
was clearly impossible to hang them all. Earnest efforts had been
made to meet the difficulty in this decisive manner, but even the
best intentions sometimes fall short of adequate performance. The
question was even assuming a more irksome phase. An official
communication, dated from Whitehall, August 18, 1786, informed the
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury that the gaols were crowded,
and that it would be necessary to ship the prisoners off somewhere.
The revolt of the American colonies was a serious bore to my Lords
of the Treasury, for they had for some time past been adding a
yearly sum of £40,000 to the revenue by selling offenders as white
labour to the planters. Now that market was closed, and the article
became a drug on the purveyors' hands. The experiment was tried of
sending a portion to the fever-coast of Africa. So many died there
that sentence of transportation became synonymous with sentence of
death. But this was cheating the hangman, and allowing a fine old
British institution to fall into contempt. This was un-English.
Something else would have to be done. Clearly, the Lords
Commissioner were deserving of every sympathy. They received it in
the shape of suggestions.</p>

<p>Humane men looked into the question in the light of their
environment, and in the spirit of the country and of the age. They
embodied their results in a series of proposals that might curdle
the blood with horror. But as it is inadvisable that the reader
should exhaust his capacity for disgust before he comes to our own
immediate record, perhaps these are as well left alone. The most
merciful proposition was one suggesting transportation to Botany
Bay. In 1787 a book was published called "A History of New South
Wales," the preface to which, written by a well-known
Cabinet-creature of the period&mdash;the Hon. William
Eden&mdash;strongly recommended the Botany Bay scheme. What he
there wrote throws light on the whole aspect of the
question:&mdash;"Criminals, when their lives or liberty are
forfeited to justice, become a forlorn hope, and have always been
judged a fair subject of hazardous experiments. If there be any
terrors in the prospect before the wretch who is banished to New
South Wales, they are no more than he expects; if the dangers of a
foreign climate are nearly equivalent to death, the devoted convict
naturally reflects that...offended justice, in consigning him to
the inhospitable shores of New Holland, does not mean thereby to
seat him for life on a bed of roses." If the devoted convict in his
natural reflections ever did lapse into that idyllic train of
thought, he was most woefully mistaken.</p>

<p class="caption">Forty convicts died on the voyage.</p>

<p>Mr. Eden was a philanthropist&mdash;save the mark!&mdash;and a
colleague of Howard in a portion of his work of prison-reform. One
of his recommendations reads thus:&mdash;"The more enormous
offenders might be sent to Tunis, Algiers, and other Mahometan
ports; others might be compelled to dangerous expeditions." All
this time the gaol-fever was carrying off its victims by hundreds.
Yet the process was not quick enough. Mr. Eden was the first to
announce the approval of the Botany Bay scheme.</p>

<p>There was one other suggestion made which deserves mention.
Australia, which escaped from China by a tidal wave, and from the
legendary Chinese explorer by the foresight of that astute
navigator, was again placed under offer to the Brother of the Sun.
A pamphlet, published in 1785, recommended that the American
loyalists who still cherished the Imperial connection might be
transferred there. Prison labour was to be placed at their
disposal; but&mdash;"the settlers of New South Wales are
principally to be collected from the Friendly Isles and China; and
the natives, no doubt, may in time be brought to unite in this
society." History repeats itself. There is a class in Australia
to-day which still cherishes the Imperial connection like the
American loyalists, and which would gladly stamp out the democratic
element by drastic legislation, or clear the way by a "whiff of
grape" for the docile Chinese cheap labour which might in time "be
brought to unite in this society." But this scheme would not
include the natives&mdash;aboriginal, or otherwise.</p>

<p>Once this question of locality was decided, the preparations
were soon made. Viscount Sydney, who was Secretary of State for the
Colonies, ordered a convoy and transports to be got ready. On April
27,1787, Captain Phillip received his commission. In March the
ships began to rendezvous at Spithead. On May 13 they hoisted sail.
The fleet consisted of a frigate and an armed tender, six
transports, and three store-ships. It carried 1015
persons&mdash;197 marines, 28 women, 17 children; 558 male
convicts, 192 women, 18 children; and five controlling officers.
The voyage occupied eight months. Some estimate of the forethought
lavished on the enterprise may be gathered from the fact that forty
convicts died on the voyage, and within the first five months of
settlement twenty-eight more followed them; while sixty-six were
under medical treatment, and two hundred were unable to work. But,
as Mr. Eden would have said, these unhappy wretches were fair
subjects for hazardous experiment, and the overcharged British
gaols had to be relieved.</p>

<p class="b">Page 4</p>

<p>Arthur Phillip was the son of Jacob Phillip, of Frankfort, who
had emigrated to London, and there earned a precarious subsistence
as a teacher of languages. His son entered the navy at sixteen, and
five years after was at the taking of Havannah in 1761. Here he was
made lieutenant, and post-captain twenty years later. He saw
service in the French war, in the East Indies, and in the employ of
Portugal. A somewhat left-handed testimonial to his fitness for his
new duties was borne by Lord Howe when his appointment was under
discussion. "I cannot say the little knowledge I have of Captain
Phillip would have led me to select him for a service of this
complicated nature." This eulogium appears to have completely
established his fitness as a subject for hazardous experiments. His
commission was at once made out. He laid in a private provision of
two puncheons of rum and twenty cwt. of loaf-sugar, with much port
and porter, and many decanters and glasses&mdash;the official
record amply bears out his care in this particular&mdash;and was
soon as ready to colonise a continent as he had been to take troops
to India to fight the French, or to offer his sword to Portugal.
There was no weak prejudice or delicate coyness about Captain
Phillip.</p>

<p>Captain Phillip was a man with views. In his blander
moments&mdash;before he started, be it observed&mdash;he appears to
have formed an idea that the expedition he was about to lead was a
species of prolonged camp-meeting, flavoured with an airy
<i>soupçon</i> of the Sunday-school picnic. "During the passage,"
he says in one letter, "I shall visit the transports when light
airs or calms permit, to see that they are kept clean and receive
the allowance ordered by Government, and at these times shall
endeavour to make them sensible of their situation." His plans for
the future were quaint to the verge of the grotesque. "The women in
general," he went on, "I shall suppose possess neither virtue nor
beauty." This is most ingenuously frank. But such a state of things
presented no difficulty to Phillip. "It may be best if the most
abandoned are permitted to receive the visits of the convicts in
the limits assigned them at certain hours; the rest I should keep
apart by permitting the men to be in their company when not at
work. They will, I suppose, marry." Such was the pastoral Arcadia
that the first Governor had in his mind's eye&mdash;an island
valley of Avillon, as it were, full of bowery hollows crowned with
lawny leas, where never wind blew loudly&mdash;and gentle shepherds
ever piped as though they never would grow old. The vision of the
impossible creatures who dreamt of being seated for their lives on
a bed of roses was about to be realised. "There shall be no slavery
in a free land," wrote the future Governor, "and, consequently, no
slaves." But Captain Phillip naturally did not know as much of the
history of Botany Bay as he afterwards learnt and helped to make.
In the meantime, our extracts will serve to show what the original
intentions really were.</p>

<p>The Governor reached Botany Bay first, on January 18, 1788. The
rest of the fleet came up by the 20th. Phillip showed his good
sense by preferring Port Jackson to Botany Bay as the cradle of the
settlement. On the 26th all the ships came round and disembarked
their cargoes at the mouth of the Tank-stream. Like Phillip's
plans, this has since degenerated, and become the city sewer. Three
royal salutes were fired, the echoes of which will not cease to be
heard until the war-ships, for which the Parliaments of all the
Australian colonies but one have unpatriotically pledged the people
to pay a subsidy, salute the Australian flag before they finally
set forth from Australian waters. Every man then received a pint of
rum, and every woman half-a-pint. A whirl of festivity ensued, and
the first Australian sun went down in peaceful summer splendour on
a human hell. The Saturnalian orgy had commenced, and one of the
blackest chapters in the world's history was fairly opened. The
curtain rose on a new continent, under circumstances of squalor and
degradation which never in all history had inaugurated the career
of a nation before. As we hastily cover up and huddle away the
historical picture that shows us the close of the first Australian
day, and the pioneers that Britain sent us, sunk in their loathsome
revelry, we find it almost impossible to realise, as Mr. Kingsley
would have us believe, that Providence designed the country for
these.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter III. The Saturnalia
Begins&mdash;The Beast and the Beauty.</h2>

<p>The mysterious island that had lain for a thousand years asleep
in a summer sea, like the Sleeping Beauty in the children's pretty
story, was thus rudely awakened&mdash;100 years ago&mdash;by the
Beast! The advanced civilisation of England had confessed itself a
failure. It had been in labour, and it brought forth a Calibanesque
abortion. The silver trumpet of the Prince in the story was
exchanged for the howl of a satyr. It was well that the centenary
of Australia, which reminds of this, should be fittingly
celebrated. It is easy of comprehension that those interested
should have differed as they did about the method. But the occasion
was too pregnant with lessons and morals for the opening mind of
young Australia to be allowed to pass by. It has set Australian men
thinking about the past history that others made for them, and it
is only in this way that the problems of the present and the near
future can be grasped.</p>

<p>A few days after the landing at the mouth of the Tank-stream,
the Governor called his people together under some gum-trees where
is now Macquarie-Place, and had the King's commission read.
Letters-patent for the establishment of a civil and criminal
judicature followed, and something like a first Charter of Justice
was published. There was a beautiful simplicity about the
Phillipian cede; but yet, following the conventional usage of
codes, it called for some marginal references. After the manner of
Blackstone and Stephen and other reputable jurists, therefore, the
Governor issued a popular commentary on his work. It took the form
of the execution of a boy. The lad was 17 years of age, and he was
hanged for petty theft just six weeks after the fleet sailed
through the Heads. Fate lost no time in reproducing that bloody
character of the spirit of British penal legislation, which, with
other British products, Australia has since made so fondly its
own.</p>

<p>But Phillip, as we have seen, was not entirely a brute. The
honest savage merely did what he conceived to be his duty. He was a
captain in the navy of the time that Marryat has described. On his
own quarter-deck the captain could do as he liked; and there is a
droll story of such an officer who, with fine humour, tarred and
feathered one of his midshipmen, and confined him in a hen-coop for
several weeks. The Service afforded no redress, and the midshipman
had to resign and sacrifice his career before he recovered damages
in a civil court. The "cat" and the yard-arm were active
disciplinary agents, and the seaman was as much a subject for
hazardous experiments as the Australian colony was now to become.
Phillip, his apologists say, only did his duty in hanging the boy.
Leading colonists said the same thing one Christmas-tide not long
ago when Governor Carrington refused to stay the execution of four
lads of about the same age as their pioneer. The horrible blunder
that resulted will blister the national sentiment until Australia
forgets its past, and vomits its squalid traditions out of its
mouth. But that late episode was consonant with the whole tenor of
the history of Botany Bay. The old leaven lies deep.</p>

<p>The first law examination of which we have record occurred soon
after. A woman passed in the practice and theory of the code. She
filched a flat-iron&mdash;and went forthwith and hanged herself in
her tent. It would be idle to enquire what she could possibly want
with a flat-iron at that early stage of colonisation. The
philosophical observer is thus forced back on the abstract
significance of the fact. Viewed in this way, it bears the most
complete testimony to the popular character of Phillip's
commentary. Not every embryotic jurist has such a rapid success as
this. But then, not every jurist has such an opportunity.</p>

<p>A fair understanding being thus established, the work of
colonisation began. Two French ships under La Pérouse had arrived
just after the fleet, and remained two months. Had they arrived a
week earlier complications might have ensued. But Providence, which
designed the country for Caliban, had arranged that the future of
Australia should not fall into the hands of a people fresh from the
partial awakening of the French Revolution. So the Frenchmen left,
leaving no trace behind but a monument at Botany Bay which rose
forty years later, and this entry in a diary now before the
writer:&mdash;"The French officers listened to the proposals of two
fair shop-lifters, who were missed two days after the Frenchmen had
sailed." Then those who were not sick, or otherwise disabled, set
to work. The houses for the officers, a soldiers' barracks,
hospital, convicts' huts, and a storehouse for provisions rose
slowly, for of those fit to work few or none had any mechanical
qualifications. So little care had been given to the expedition
that the first colonists consisted simply of a heterogeneous
agglomeration of marines, magsmen, London sharpers, and cracksmen,
and a sprinkling of pick-pockets. Of farming they knew nothing. The
results came in their natural order. Dearth of provisions,
sickness, famine; and by that time all that was left of Phillip's
island valley of Avillon had vanished as completely as the boy that
was hanged, or the Frenchmen's two fair shop-lifters.</p>

<p class="b">Page 5</p>

<p>The famine came like an angel of mercy to withdraw the stricken
ones from the horrors that were to come. Those who escaped with
life only preserved it to become the victims of a rapacity and a
cruelty quite as blind and greedy as the grave. But this came
after. The seed sown by the criminal neglect of the Home Government
which adventured on this hazardous experiment, began to bear early
fruit, and seven marines were hanged together in 1789 for stealing
bread from the public store. A small party was sent to Norfolk
Island to try to raise provisions there. Farms were laid out at
Parramatta, and the site of the present Botanical Gardens became a
farm for the support of the settlement. But in February, 1790, only
four months' provisions at half-rations were left, and presently
the <i>Juliana</i> with two hundred female immigrants arrived with
the announcement that the <i>Guardian</i> store-ship, bearing food
supplies for the settlement, had been wrecked at the Cape. Then the
<i>Sirius</i>, also bearing stores, was wrecked off Norfolk Island.
Phillip gave up his own private supplies to the common stock, and
confined everyone to the same ration. He gave a State banquet at
Government House&mdash;a rather better hut than the
others&mdash;and each officer brought his own bread to the
sumptuous board, impaled on the point of his sword!</p>

<p>From a journal, now extremely rare, published by Captain Tench
in 1793, we take an extract here. It will show that the opinion
held by the aboriginals of British institutions was almost as
strong as the British objection to American political institutions
to-day: "A convict was taken in the act of stealing fishing-tackle
from Daringa, the wife of Colbee. The Governor ordered that he
should be severely flogged in the presence of as many natives as
could be assembled, to whom the cause of punishment should be
explained. Many of them of both sexes accordingly attended...There
was not one of them that did not testify strong abhorrence of the
punishment, and equal sympathy with the sufferer. The women were
particularly affected. Daringa shed tears, and Barangaroo, kindling
into anger, snatched a stick and menaced the executioners." Here
was a failure of justice in its deterrent effect at the very
outset. The sight of a white man under the lash, instead of having
a bluff, British, self-righteous influence on the savage breasts of
these wild creatures, simply moved one of the women to tears, and
another to menace the executioners with a stick. The degradation
that a British seaman of the period could endure with slavish
fatalism, or an Australian judge of to-day order with the most
placid equanimity, caused a natural feeling of disgust and
abhorrence in savage man in his lowest stage of development. It
would be absurd to say that they failed to recognise the "natural
justice" of the punishment. The woman from whom the stricken wretch
stole the fishing-tackle shed tears at the brutal spectacle she had
been brought to witness. If anything could have succeeded in making
Phillip and his officers ashamed of themselves and their
institutions, this incident, told by one of themselves, might
surely have done so. But not so, the black man was to be educated
up&mdash;or down&mdash;to the white man's standard in this
particular. His crudest natural instincts had to be brutalised
before he could appreciate the beauties of the lash. The savage,
whose courtship consisted of a blow from a heelaman on the head of
his affianced, was moved to abhorrence on seeing a white man
flogged!</p>

<p>Major Ross was sent to govern Norfolk Island. Upwards of seven
hundred persons were there marooned, amidst all the horrors of
famine. It is impossible to repress the suspicion that every
execution was looked upon as a public benefit, as lessening the
number of mouths to be fed. "All persons, as well soldiers as
others, the inhabitants of the Isle of Norfolk, are hereby
prohibited from killing stock of any kind whatever, without consent
of the Government, under penalty of immediate death by hanging."
When the <i>Sirius</i> was lost martial law was proclaimed. "All
plundering of public or private property will be deemed a capital
crime." In August a proclamation was issued which makes the
suspicion just indicated a certainty:&mdash;"Any person whatever,
either male or female, who does not to the utmost of their (sic)
power and strength continue their share of labour...shall be
adjudged to suffer death." Words would fail to paint the misery of
that accursed island, of which the hideous history was just
commencing. The devoted convict might indeed reflect that his
liberty was forfeit to "justice," and that he had become a fit
object of hazardous experiments. Of the marines, Major
Ross&mdash;whose measures were stronger than his
grammar&mdash;wrote "Not one of them has a shoe to their (sic) feet
or a shirt to their backs&mdash;not a pot to every twelve
men&mdash;not a bed or a blanket amongst them." But the other
helpless wretches could not call their souls or their bodies their
own. If England is a great colonising nation to-day, the fact is
due rather to the colonists themselves than to those who sent them
forth.</p>

<p>It is a pitiful story, this recital of the first years of our
history, and distressing to the writer as to the reader. But what
we have seen of the steps which led to Australian colonisation
scarcely promised any hope of better things. While the settlement
was starving, the gaols "at home" were still belching forth their
fetid contents, and the quicker the convicts were swallowed up by
disease or death, the dangers of the voyage, or the fate that
awaited them in Australia&mdash;the more the expedient proposed to
cope with the difficulties of the dilemma in which the Lords
Commissioners found themselves was hailed as a proven success. It
served its purpose, and emptied the gaols for a moment. But it did
more. For it colonised a continent where the English spirit of the
time was to be perpetuated by the transmitted influence of the
gaolers of these convicts, long after a new liberalism had entered
into British politics, and long after the narrow spirit of a
hundred years ago with convictism itself had passed away.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter IV. The King's Colours.</h2>

<p>It cannot be too strongly insisted upon that the enduring effect
of the convict system on the public spirit of the older Australian
colonies is traceable not so much to the convicts themselves as to
their gaolers. This is a significant fact which writers on
Australian subjects have venally ignored. It is now time that these
mercenary wretches were gibbeted for the scorn of honest men.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/11-page-05.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p>The early stage of settlement was bad enough, but it was
reserved for the New South Wales Corps to discover a yet deeper
depth. Two years after Phillip landed, Major Grose made a proposal
to the Secretary of State to enlist a force for service at Botany
Bay. He offered to raise two companies without expense to the
Government on condition of his receiving a Lieutenant colonelcy,
failing which he proposed to enlist recruits at bare cost to
Government, in return for his having the right to nominate the
captain and subordinate officers, and receive the levy-money. His
letter has this passage:&mdash;"I will exert myself to the utmost
to recruit them with as little expense as possible, and with as
much expedition as it is in my power." Major Grose kept his
promise. His recruiting sergeants scoured the hulks and the prisons
for likely men. The <i>Savoy</i>, soldiers' hulk, furnished a large
contingent of men under punishment. Bad subjects who had been
condemned to service in India were reprieved on enlisting in the
new company. "Characters who have been disgraceful to every other
regiment in his Majesty's service," wrote Governor Hunter a little
later, "have been thought fit and proper recruits for the New South
Wales Corps." And, in another place:&mdash;"We find among these,
men capable of corrupting the hearts of the best-disposed, and
often superior in every species of infamy to the most expert in
wickedness among the convicts." Thirty convicts, who had been
soldiers, were added to the force. Such were the chosen watch-dogs
of Phillip's peaceful Arcadian flock.</p>

<p class="b">Page 6</p>

<p>The officers were fit associates of the men they commanded. They
were common gaolers, hired to do gaolers' duty. They had every
qualification for the work. The British officer of the period was
not likely to engage in the scramble for a commission in this
glittering corps. These commissions, therefore, became the spoils
of a set of wolfish jackals, who with few exceptions were no better
than the men themselves. The Irish political prisoner, Holt, speaks
of them in his memoirs as "those old tailors and shoemakers,
staymakers, man-milliners, tobacconists, and pedlars, that were
called captains and lieutenants." No jackdaw staff of a militia
corps in a burlesque ever approached this. Yet these men were the
founders of the "first families" of at least New South Wales and
Tasmania. A cowardly slur on the national sentiment of Young
Australia is often based on the fact that the colonies were
originally convict settlements. The best apology that has been made
is that it is not the fault of Young Australia if its ancestors
were sent out by the best judges. But even this is hardly true.
Major Grose kept his engagement only too well. It lies open to
serious question if he did not recruit the founders of our first
families with too little regard to expense, and with rather more
expedition than was either necessary or desirable.</p>

<p>Wolves eat wolves' flesh! It is a carrion that no other beast of
prey will flesh its fangs upon. But the wolf has no sentimental
feeling in the matter, and neither had the officers of the New
South Wales Corps for the caged human wolves they so eagerly
offered to guard. Their record opens at a chapter of our history
where no combination of invective or epithet can reach low enough
to do justice to the foetid squalor it describes. But it has been
too often glossed over to be let alone now.</p>

<p>In January, 1791, the first contingent of the corps, consisting
of 171 men, with a captain and two ensigns, brought 1900 male and
150 female convicts to Botany Bay. They lost no time in getting to
work on arrival. It is easy to understand that men reprieved from
the hulks would enter on a season of enjoyment under the
circumstances. So we presently find Captain Phillip complaining of
his little beagles. "They were observed to be very intimate with
the convicts, living in their huts, eating, drinking, and gambling
with them, and perpetually enticing the women to leave the men."
They fraternised with the populace, as it were. Strangely enough,
the populace objected to the intimacy. It would be invidious to ask
why; but doubtless a natural jealousy of experts who were "often
superior to themselves in every species of infamy," had something
to do with this ebullition of honest pride. But the King's uniform
was not to be insulted in this manner. The soldiers took what
Hunter violently described as the "very unwarrantable liberty" of
destroying the dwelling-house of one John Bawgham. On a previous
occasion "the greatest part of the detachment left their barracks
with their bayonets to attack an unarmed people," and continued in
a state of "open and avowed mutiny" for four days. The whole
detachment, with the exception of the non-commissioned officers and
five or six of the privates, took an oath to stand by each other
and not to suffer a soldier to be punished for whatever crime he
might commit against an inhabitant. One of the Governor's orders
puts the matter in this feebly-deprecatory form:&mdash;"It is
natural enough in every inhabitant of this colony to entertain
apprehensions for the safety of their persons...whenever any
private soldier shall think proper to consider them as persons
deserving chastisement." It was simply a reign of terror, dominated
by an armed ruffian horde. But where were the officers who were
responsible for the behaviour of their men all this time?</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/12-page-06.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">"Wolves eat wolves' flesh."</p>

<p>These astute "old tailors and shoemakers, staymakers,
man-milliners, tobacconists, and pedlars," who called themselves
captains and lieutenants, were engaged in another direction. The
officers of this glittering corps had other cats to whip, and other
fish to fry. We shall see what they were at presently. Meantime,
when the Governor called on them to protect him and the inhabitants
from these ruffians&mdash;complaining bitterly of "the insults
which have been offered to me"&mdash;the officers resented his
interference. He belonged to another arm of the service. He
retorted that if the soldiers expected him to "consider them by the
very honourable appellation of British troops, it must be by their
bringing forward the ringleaders of their shameful conduct." And
eventually, in a fine burst, he wrote to Lieutenant-colonel
Paterson in these terms: "I must declare to you, sir, that the
conduct of this part of the New South Wales Corps has been, in my
opinion, the most violent and outrageous that was ever heard of by
any British regiment whatever." It is Hunter who writes thus. Here,
again, his feelings were too strong for perspicuity. This coarse
sea-captain should have been flogged like one of his own convicts
for his criminal abuse of the King's English.</p>

<p>The officers were jealous of what they called, imaginatively
enough, the honour of their corps. They resented interference with
their privileges because it checked their action in the furtherance
of private schemes. For we find that, as soon as they reached
Sydney, they at once embarked in trade, almost to a man. They
evidently regarded the money paid to Major Grose for their
commissions as an ordinary trade investment. So they at once put
themselves in the way of securing returns. They robbed their men
and the inhabitants with indifference, and carried on a shameless
and usurious trade, about which we will have something to say in
its proper place. To secure their influence they interfered in all
public concerns, in the administration of such law as existed, and
in any and every measure of a social or commercial character
intended to further the interests of settlement.</p>

<p>Let us gibbet a few names of officers of the New South Wales
Corps. Besides Major Grose, we find Captains Nichols, Nepean,
Hethe, Paterson, and Foveaux. The first and the two last acted as
temporary Governors, and Foveaux achieved an infamous reputation
later on as Governor of Norfolk Island. Then came Lieutenant
McArthur&mdash;a colonial Machiavelli who will take up much of our
attention as we go on&mdash;Lieutenants Thompson, Abbot, Beckworth,
Prentice, Rowley; afterwards came Captain Kemp, a later Van
Diemen's Land worthy, who survived to above the age of 90; Piper,
Laycock, and others came after. Not all of these were equally
infamous; but, like the husbandman in Aesop's fable, we will hang
up these foxes with the others for the company we find them in. Of
all the characters that Dickens has painted, next to Uriah Heep,
that of Claypole was perhaps the most contemptible. The rank youth
yearned to give some one a flogging, and arrived at his ambition at
last in becoming a turnkey in a gaol. These early officers were the
Noah Claypoles of Australian story, with all that worthy's
<i>penchant</i> for safe petty larceny superadded. The observer of
the pioneers of the first fleet might well have thought that the
world at large could not produce a set of wretches more lost and
degraded than those. The arrival of the gaolers of the New South
Wales Corps discovered a yet lower level. But to degrade the
degradation and cap the wickedness of the rank-and-file we must
look to the officers themselves. To paint their character from
their own records will be a task as easy as it is repulsive. Yet it
is necessary to revive the history of the past to get a clear view
of the anomalous position of the Australian social and political
systems of to-day.</p>

<p class="b">Page 7</p>

<p>Changes had been going on while these events were taking shape.
Phillip had made repeated applications to be relieved of his
charge, rendered doubly odious by the conduct of the officers. He
succeeded in getting away in December, 1792. He received a pension
of £400 for his services. Australian writers have taken a delight
in printing much tiresome rubbish about his benevolence and his
forbearance&mdash;his temperate, judicious, liberal, patient
labour. Had he been a Washington instead of a common gaoler of
felons, his eulogists could not have apotheosised his memory more.
Himself and his assistant warders had a more just conception of the
position they occupied. A convict, on arrival, presented a letter
purporting to come from Baron Hotham, asking consideration for the
bearer. The clumsy forger had addressed Phillip as "your Honour!"
The fraud was at once detected, says Captain Tench; for no one but
a convict could have used such a mode of address to his gaoler.
When the officers of the corps assumed the Governorship, no title
short of "Excellency" would serve their turn. Let us see how they
used their power when it came.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter V. The Rum-Selling
Coups.</h2>

<p>The New South Wales Corps ruled the colony either directly or
indirectly from the departure of Phillip to the deposition of
Bligh. Major Grose and Captain Patterson were lieutenant-governors
until the arrival of Hunter, in 1795. In those three years the
corps solidified its position, until it became strong enough, in
1808, to put Bligh under arrest. Shortly afterwards the corps was
drummed out of the colony in disgrace, and ordered to England and
thence to India as a "condemned regiment." But the officers did not
go to India. Having led their men into mischief they deserted their
colours, turned their backs on their followers, and resigning the
commissions they had disgraced, remained behind in the colony and
founded our "first families."</p>

<p>We have said that the officers looked upon the purchase of their
commissions as a trade investment. They were nearly all keen men,
but it was with the keenness of the huxter. They saw the misery
about them, the degraded condition of their victims, and their own
great power; and they proceeded to use this last to make money out
of the other two. Not one spark of generous or even common human
sympathy with the state of things they saw around them brightens
their dank and squalid record. With incredible callousness to the
most pitiable forms of misery they fattened and prospered on the
filth of the time as the raven gorges itself on the carrion. It
would be too Arcadian to expect any manly protest from such
creatures as these, against the iniquities of the convict system.
It was distinctly to their interest, as tending to lessen the
chances of commercial competition, that their God-forsaken victims
should be mercilessly ground down. The writer who would attempt to
candidly describe the phenomenally sinister character of the
officers of this picked corps, would lay himself open to the charge
of aiming at the creation of a mere vulgar sensation. It is safer,
therefore, to let their acts speak for themselves.</p>

<p>No one will be surprised to learn that the chief article of
trade with these uniformed huxters was rum. "The rum-selling corps"
is the glorious title they have carried on the flaming scroll of
history. Few historic titles have been earned so well. The
settlement reeked with ruffianism and rum. Rum was a recognised
medium of exchange. Wages for labour, the price of farm produce,
and every other transaction for which money usually serves, were
paid in rum. This was a traffic quite after the officers' own
hearts. They entered on it with enthusiasm, bought up all the rum
they could lay their hands on, and retailed it at ruinous prices to
the settlement. Lawlessness and disorder ensued, and successive
Governors wrote home for advice. Instructions were issued from
Whitehall, forbidding all officers, civil and military, from
selling any spirituous liquors to the convicts or settlers. But the
authorities might have saved their breath. For the officers
procured licenses for their non-commissioned officers, for
ex-convicts, and for those of their own men who could be trusted.
Governor Hunter considered the trade as "highly disgraceful to men
who hold in their hands a commission signed by His Majesty." And
so, no doubt, it was. But everything was disgraceful, and this was
of a piece with the rest.</p>

<p>It would be a difficult thing to say who did not sell rum in the
settlement. The line can only be drawn at those who were
incapacitated by drinking it. Dr. Balmain, whose duty it was as a
magistrate to sentence men to be cut to pieces by the lash for
absorbing too much rum&mdash;and the records show that he did his
duty&mdash;had at one time, when a fitful effort was made to
restrict the officers' traffic, upwards of 1400 gallons of spirits
in his house! There were also a "few chests of tea and some bale
goods"&mdash;truly a plentiful lack of bread to such an intolerable
deal of sack! Mr. D'Arcy Wentworth had 3000 gallons. They offered
to sacrifice it in deference to the new Order, at twenty shillings
a gallon. But the farcical nature of all attempts to stop the
lucrative traffic is shown by such instances as the
following:&mdash;One day a ship arrived from Manilla, being
described as carrying cattle to the settlement. There were two head
of stock onboard. But there were also 7203 gallons of spirits. The
Governor forwarded a copy of his Order to the master, bidding him
land his two cows and take the spirits away. But this was entirely
too infantile a suggestion; the master reported that his vessel was
unfit to put to sea; and, adds the Governor, "under the
circumstances and the unpopularity of preventing the spirits from
being illicitly appropriated and consumed, I allowed of its being
disposed of and distributed in the usual manner." For amazing
artfulness, both in matter and style, this minute excels anything
ever projected by Captain Cuttle.</p>

<p>It is a fact that each officer had his permission to land rum in
quantities proportioned to his rank. This was sold up to £1 per
gallon. A farmer has been known to give an acre of wheat, which
would maintain him a year, for two gallons of spirits. When the
officers sent their agents to purchase wheat from the settlers they
took, not money, but rum. A bottle which cost the officer
half-a-crown, we are told, would buy two or three bushels of wheat.
The officers employed the settlers to illicitly distil the most
infernal intoxicants from wheat, peaches and other things.
Barrington, the famous pickpocket turned thief-catcher, explains
that a bushel of wheat, which might be worth ten shillings, would
produce five gallons of deleterious spirit at six shillings per
gallon. The chief constable of Sydney had a license to sell rum;
and, as Dr. Lang puts it, "the chief gaoler, although not exactly
permitted to convert the gaol into a grog-shop, had a licensed
house in which he sold rum publicly on his own behalf, right
opposite the gaol-door."</p>

<p class="b">Page 8</p>

<p>The officers unblushingly made use of their power for trade
purposes, and to secure the command of the market they entered into
an infamous bond, binding themselves to treat through two of their
number with the captains of vessels, for the purchase of their
merchandise, to the exclusion of any person outside their own ring.
They had the privilege of being the first to board vessels arriving
in the harbour. But they knew each other too well to trust to the
mere word of honour of such British officers as they were. They
instituted a £1000 forfeit for anyone of their number who might
attempt to effect a purchase without the connivance of his fellows.
This flagrant conspiracy gave them the command of the buying
market, and left them at liberty to fix their own retail prices. It
might be thought that the generous, free spirit of the British
soldier would have made a muddle of such closely-calculated
commercial arrangements. But these old tailors and shoemakers,
staymakers and man-milliners, were not this kind of soldier. The
outcry of the inhabitants soon showed this. They were everlastingly
memorialising, petitioning, and remonstrating with the Governor for
allowing the daylight robbery to go on. But as a rule the Governors
knew better than to interfere in any serious mood. When one of
their number did try to make a stand the "gentlemen" of the New
South Wales Corps arose in their indignation, created what they
called a great popular upheaval against the horrid tyranny that
oppressed the groaning masses, and, rushing the Governor's bedroom
with a horde of armed and drunken myrmidons, they fished Bligh out
from under a bed and summarily locked him up!</p>

<p>The thoroughly business-like principles on which these officers
fleeced the settlement may be gathered from a few facts. When
Hunter arrived, after three years' direct rule by the corps, the
Reverend Mr. Johnson, chaplain of the settlement, preached a little
sermon, in which he exposed the government of the officers, "their
extortion, their despotism, their debauchery, and the ruin of the
colony, driving it almost to ruin by the sale of goods at 1200 per
cent, profit." He congratulated the settlement on the "abolition of
the military government." He might well do so, but it was not
abolished yet. An extract from Holt's Memoirs is worth
quoting:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain Anthony Fenn Kemp, when a soldier came to him for his
month's pay, would usually accost him with, 'Well, what do you
want?'</p>

<p>"'I want to be paid, sir,' the soldier would say.</p>

<p>"'What will you have?' was always Captain Kemp's answer. 'I have
very good tobacco, ten shillings the pound, and good tea at twenty
shillings the pound, prints at eight shillings a yard&mdash;' and
so on.</p>

<p>"If the poor soldier answered, 'Sir, I do not want any of your
goods,' the captain's comment was, 'You don't! your are a damned
saucy rascal!'</p>

<p>"Perhaps then the soldier would say, 'Sir, if you please, give
me half money and half goods.'</p>

<p>"But this proposal was equally objectionable to Captain Kemp,
and generally led to his thundering out, 'Begone, you damned
mutinous scoundrel, or I'll send you to the guard-house and have
you flogged for your impertinence to your officer.'"</p>

<p>"This was the manner," summarises Holt, "that these people made
their fortunes, by the oppression and extortion of the soldier, the
settler, and the poor."</p>

<p>"Their debauchery," said the Reverend Mr. Johnson in his little
sermons; but the foul and disgusting story of these men's
debaucheries and immoralities is so sickening a recital as to be
quite unfit for detailed publication. A select committee of the
Commons on transportation in 1812 brought out a mass of information
on oath which abundantly proves the worst that has been said about
the New South Wales Corps. Such a picture of wanton rapacity,
unbridled greed, and bare-faced robbery of prisoners by their
gaolers&mdash;robbery under its most repulsive form&mdash;was never
disclosed on oath before.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter VI. Convicts on the
Voyage.</h2>

<p>There is a strikingly dramatic picture given by Dickens in
"Great Expectations." You remember how he describes the capture of
Magwitch and Compeyson on the marshes; and then how Pip from the
shore watches the marines rowing through the fog to the convict
hulk lying out on the gloomy water. One of the soldiers carries a
torch, which gets dimmer and redder through the mist as they go.
Now the boat reaches the ship. The re-captured convicts are helped
on board. The marine throws the torch hissing and spluttering into
the sea. There is a quick flash&mdash;and all is dark again. It
seems to the boy that the lives of those convicts have gone out
with it. But both Dickens and Pip were wrong. The unhappy convicts'
miserable lives were recommencing. They held wonderful unexhausted
capacity for the endurance of hellish torture yet.</p>

<p>The system under which transportation was first carried on was a
disgrace to the British name, and, so far, it was consistent with
the rest of this grisly story. The work of carrying convicts was
entrusted to contractors, who received sixpence per day for each
convict's food-allowance, beside a tonnage rate. It would be
impossible to believe the stories told of the wolfish greed of
these contractors, if they were not borne out by State papers and
recorded facts. The longer the voyage lasted, the longer the
contractors drew their miserable allowance, and these sixpences
were, of course, saved in cases where the convict died. Thus a
businesslike understanding was established, under which the human
cargoes died off like rotten sheep. The figures tell the story. Dr.
White, the colonial surgeon who came out with Phillip, wrote some
reports on this subject.</p>

<p>"Of the 939 males," he says, in 1790, "sent out by the last
ships&mdash;the <i>Surprise</i>, <i>Scarborough</i>, and
<i>Neptune</i>&mdash;26l died on board, and 50 have died since
landing; the number of sick this day is 450, and many who are
reckoned as not sick have barely strength to attend to themselves;
when the last ships arrived we had not 60 people sick in the
colony."</p>

<p>One hundred and sixty-four convicts died on the <i>Neptune</i>
alone. In 1802, 66 convicts succumbed on one voyage between Cape
Town and Sydney. During the first eight years of settlement upwards
of one-tenth of the convicts died on the voyage. The caravan-tracks
across the desert are marked by the bleaching bones of beasts and
men, but the track of these convict ships across the ocean might
have been as easily distinguishable by its line of floating
corpses.</p>

<p>This was not all. "Floating hells" was the name the
convict-ships soon earned. Crowds of convicts were thrown into the
holds, with little ventilation and without supervision. Brutality
and irons were the only means used to enforce order. The wretched
vessels employed were not large enough to accommodate the number of
convicts whom the greed of the contractors and the carelessness of
the Government forced on board. They might well have felt
themselves handed over to the irresponsible tortures of fiends. If
any were over-tortured and died in consequence, they were easily
thrown overboard. There was no difficulty about that. Herded like
pigs, but not half so well-fed; half-clothed, and robbed on board
of any comforts a kind hand might have provided for the voyage;
chained to a dead body, sometimes, or to a dying man, and flogged
into mutiny and out of it at the caprice of a drunken skipper,
these unhappy convicts, in their despair, often preferred the
gaping maw of a hungry shark to the horrors of the prison-ship. The
shark, at least, would use no more violence than was necessary. But
the records show that these drunken skippers tortured their victims
because they liked it.</p>

<p>If the condition of the men was bad, that of the females and
children was worse. Under the savage laws of the time women and
girls, often of gentle lives and honest parentage, were found on
board the women's ships. "Not a few of the convicts," says Bonwick,
"were mere boys and girls of from 13 to 15 years of age." This is
the one touch of horror wanted to complete the revolting picture.
The rest of the shameless story is best indicated by another
quotation. In 1806 Captain Bertram, writing about these floating
Gomorrahs, has this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The captain and each officer enjoy the right of selection. Thus
they continue the habit of concubinage until the convicts arrive at
Sydney town. Each sailor or soldier is permitted to attach himself
to one of the females."</p>

<p>The reader can fill out the picture for himself.</p>

<p>Surely no den of infamy or lair of vice and crime ever equalled
the scene presented by the hold of one of these prison-ships! The
horrors of the slave-trade have made men's blood boil with
indignation, and the smug virtue of the <i>bourgeois</i> Briton
even induced John Bull to relax his purse-strings&mdash;an
exaggerated excess of emotion!&mdash;to put down the foreign
iniquity. But what story of the slave-trade ever equalled in the
graphic intensity of its horrors the unholy abominations carried on
with white men and white women and girls as the helpless victims
for nearly fifty years under England's own flag? These wretches
were criminals, it is true; but they were men, women, and children
still. Their crimes were often petty offences by contrast with the
outrages of their gaolers, or in the light of the British criminal
code of to-day. But the smug hypocrisy which would have freed and
Christianised the black man had no merciful thought for them. What
Mumbo-Jumbo fetish or Oriental fanaticism has ever evoked greater
horrors than these results of boasted British civilisation under a
Christian Parliament and king? Surely none. By its fruits you may
know it.</p>

<p class="b">Page 9</p>

<p>We read sometimes in the stories of the slave-trade how the
negroes were forced on deck to dance to the music of a pipe. This
was for exercise. It was thought wrong to depreciate the
market-value of the labour on board by sapping its strength in idle
confinement. The convict men and women also danced on board
sometimes. But it was to the music of the boatswain's "cat." It was
considered a treat for the sailors to be allowed to flog the
convicts. But it was a refinement of luxury to flog women. The
noble creatures pleasantly contended for this graceful privilege.
If any woman-convict objected to the arrangement described by
Captain Bertram&mdash;as some rustic Devonshire girl convicted of
stealing apples and transported by some booby squire might have
done&mdash;she was at once flogged into submission. If this was not
done on the direct charge, another was easily invented. But, as a
rule, no misunderstandings arose from idle scruples in this matter.
If a drunken officer wanted a man or woman, girl or boy, flogged at
the gangway for his amusement, there was no trouble about a trifle
like that. But the best results in this direction were obtained
when the ships carried a guard of recruits for the New South Wales
Corps on board. These were artists in vice, in their own squalid
way. Often they were placed in charge of a women's-ship. The
<i>Juliana</i>, for instance, carried 226 women. One is not
surprised to find that the voyage lasted 15 months. The wonder is
that it ever finished in the usual way at all.</p>

<p>One ship carried 36 pairs of handcuffs and 200 basils with
chains for use on the voyage. Many convicts made the voyage in
irons all the way. It saved trouble. Charges of attempted or
intended mutiny were trumped up. Governor Hunter mentions a case
where, "in consequence of some conjecture that they meant to seize
the ship and murder the officers," the whole cargo was ironed for
the whole voyage. "They look most wretched from their long
confinement," he adds, with simple neatness. On the <i>Marquis of
Cornwallis</i>, in 1796, an intended mutiny was disclosed to the
captain by a convict. The captain could only induce the soldiers
and sailors to spare lives by tempting them with the offer of a
wholesale flogging, in which each should take his part. "At 11
o'clock we commenced flogging these villains at the gangway, and
continued engaged on that service till 42 men and 8 women received
their punishment." The <i>Lady Shore</i> left England for Sydney in
1798, with a reinforcement for the New South Wales Corps, and 60
female prisoners. The voyage was an orgy from the start. At length
the soldiers mutinied, seized the ship, which was carrying
provisions for the colony, and murdered the master and first mate.
They carried on a wild career of license and debauchery on the high
seas with their floating bagnio of convict-women for a time, and
then sailed to Rio Janeiro, and handed the ship over to the
Portuguese Governor there. The captain of the <i>Hercules</i> fired
volleys into the hold of his ship in expostulation with the
convicts there confined. He was tried for murder, convicted,
and&mdash;fined! A revolt of convicts in Sydney Harbour was once
quelled in this way. Shotted blunderbusses were often fired into
the holds of vessels. Naked women fought there like fiends, and men
festered in their filth like worms. But, in the end, a fair
proportion of this hazardous colonising material reached
Australia.</p>

<p>It is calculated that fifty thousand convicts left British ports
for Botany Bay during the fifty years that transportation lasted.
They did not all reach their destination. The horrors of the voyage
for some years decimated the <i>dêportês</i>. The Black Hole of
Calcutta was only a trifling incident in comparison with this tale
of torture long drawn out. From the reports of Dr. White we gather
something of the horrors these "floating hells" carried into
harbour. When he went on board, as it was his duty to do, he found
dead bodies still in irons below, amongst the crowds of the living.
Here is what he found in another place:&mdash;"A great number of
them were lying, some half and others quite naked, without either
bed or bedding, unable to turn or help themselves. The smell was so
offensive that I could hardly bear it. Some of these unhappy people
died after the ship came into the harbour, before they could be
taken on shore. Part of these had been thrown into the harbour, and
their dead bodies cast upon the shore, and were seen lying naked on
the rocks. The misery I saw amongst them is inexpressible."</p>

<p>"It is distressing," says Captain Collins&mdash;one of the few
humane men the early settlement knew&mdash;"to see the poor
creatures daily dropping into the grave."</p>

<p>"I shall never recover my accustomed vivacity and spirits," said
Captain Hill, after a voyage in a convict-ship.</p>

<p>But now the end of the long voyage was reached at last, and the
survivors were about to enter into the inheritance Providence had
destined for them. Let us see how they got on there.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter VII. The Convict in
Port.</h2>

<p>The convict who descended into the hold of a prison-ship at an
English port from nine to fifteen months before&mdash;and who
completed the voyage alive!&mdash;in many cases never came on deck
again, or saw the sky and sea, until the ship passed the Heads at
Port Jackson. On some ships they were allowed on deck in relays,
but the merest suspicion of an attempt at mutiny was often alleged
as a pretext to deny this concession. The convict had no protector,
and no person's influence stood between him and his fellow-creature
who saw a chance of saving six-pence a day by his death from
starvation. This may seem an exaggerated way of stating the case;
but the reports of the Committees of the House of Commons, from
which this writer draws his information, are still extant, and open
for reference.</p>

<p>The sight that greeted the felon's eye was not a re-assuring
one. It may be taken for granted that the study and pursuit of an
arduous profession&mdash;the cracking of cribs and the picking of
patent locks is not an intuitive accomplishment&mdash;had left him
little time to cultivate an eye for the merely picturesque. It is,
therefore, probable that the natural beauties of Sydney Harbour
were lost on him. But the landscape held other features. Dr. White,
the Sydney surgeon, has already limned some of its characteristics
for us in a few graphic touches. Floating corpses of the hundreds
who had died on the prison-ships, and were thrown overboard in the
harbour when the holds were cleared, lent a charm of their own to
the bright waters of the bay. Moored close in to the shores of
Neutral Bay, the convict just brought on deck might see the naked
bodies of his comrades, as the surgeon has told us, lying upon the
rocks. The sharks and the gulls held revelry together on these
carcases of outcasts. But there is another feature in the
landscape.</p>

<p>As the convict ship came down the harbour at about the end of
the last and the beginning of the present century, one ghastly
object met the view and stamped its repulsive characteristics on
the new country whose granitic water-gates had just been passed.
Full in the ship's fairway, and just before reaching one point that
intercepted the straggling buildings of the infant settlement from
the view, there rose straight out from the water a certain rocky
crag. This was Pinchgut&mdash;so-called by those who affected plain
Saxon speech, because the convict who broke the regulations was sen
there and exposed to the weather by day and night on bread and
water until the caprice of his irresponsible torturers was
gratified. Five men were thus kept here on one occasion for three
months. Sometimes the convict would attempt to swim across to the
northern shore, and so escape into the bush. Stories are told of
the efficiency of the sentinels&mdash;the sharks, which swarmed
about the little island. The fact that the convict was sometimes
seized and devoured by these vigilant fish as he made his desperate
bid for life and liberty, only lent a piquant zest to the
proceedings. There was a bond of sympathy between the shark and the
gaoler. On the summit of the crag was a gibbet, and here the
skeleton of a murderer swung in the wind, clanking its chains to
every breeze that blew. This dismal sight, as it was probably the
last he saw on English soil&mdash;in one of Hogarth's pictures you
see an example of the custom that obtained of hanging malefactors
in chains by the sea shore&mdash;was likewise the first that
greeted the outcast's eyes as he once more touched land under the
English flag. It was a familiar object, this dismal scarecrow of
civilisation. And the unclean thing doubtless communicated to the
observant convict a home-like and domestic feeling, and showed him
that his comforts had not been unforeseen or unprovided for in the
strange land that Providence had designed for him.</p>

<p class="b">Page 10</p>

<p>The skeleton was that of a cooper named Morgan. He held crude
views as to the rights of property, and he attempted to investigate
that economic problem and a colonist's skull at the same time.
However, this untutored cooper did not investigate by the aid of
legitimately applicable principles. He used an adze. A boat that
went one day to the North Shore for wood, says the thief-catcher
Barrington, brought back a man's hat with blood on it. Further
search discovered a body. This good cooper was one of eight men
sentenced to death for divers offences, and, by way of lending
special <i>éclat</i> to the proceedings in his case, he was hanged
on a high gallows on Pinchgut rock. In those days, and for many a
long year after, it was the custom for the gibbetted criminal to
devise a last dying speech and confession to his testamentary
legatees. As Mr. Morgan was hoisted into the balmy air, and the
virginal loveliness of the surrounding scenery burst upon him in
all the magic of its native charm, that respectable cooper gave
expression to the responsive harmony within his soul in certain
memorable words. "You have here, indeed, a beautiful harbour!" said
this excellent man, as he was upset into eternity. The observation
has become historical, and has been repeated with enthusiasm and
received with exuberant effusion by all who love their country ever
since. It is probably apocryphal; like so many more of the cant
sentiments of history.</p>

<p>"Morgan was ordered to be hung in chains on the Island
Mat-te-wan-ye," runs the story. "This spectacle, shocking to the
refined mind"&mdash;it is Barrington, the pickpocket turned
thief-catcher, who is speaking now&mdash;"served as an object of
ridicule to the convicts and terror to the natives, who, though
hitherto particularly partial to that spot, now totally abandoned
it." This is the second flaring instance of the effect of advanced
British customs on the savage mind. We have seen already how the
flogging of a white man moved them to anger and to tears; now we
find them disgusted at the spectacle of a a malefactor hanging in
chains. There is evidently something repellent to the savage mind
in both the rope and the lash. It is only under a high-pressure
civilisation, where the rights of property are understood and
maintained, that these adjuncts of order and law&mdash;so shocking
to the refined mind, as this mawkish thief-catcher would
say&mdash;become thoroughly appreciated and intelligently used.</p>

<p>Morgan was hanged in 1796; in 1800, Holt, who arrived then,
describes a skeleton in chains as one of the first objects that met
his eye. It would be a nice question to discuss&mdash;Who was
responsible for this desecration of our beautiful harbour? Not the
murdered man; he certainly had no voice in the matter. Clearly not
Mr. Morgan; he, in his modesty, would have been satisfied to hang
anywhere. The blame is at the doors of the authorities of the time,
who, surfeited with executions and floggings, which doubtless
palled on their appetites for these horrors, capriciously directed
the hanging of this wretch on Pinchgut Rock as a pleasant variation
from the beaten track pursued in these cases.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/16-page-10.jpg" alt=

</p>

<p class="caption">Pinchgut</p>

<p>Many years after, Dr. Lang complained bitterly when Governor
Denison hewed this rock away and erected his gingerbread
fortifications there. It was removing an old landmark, wailed the
Doctor, and effacing a picturesque feature of the landscape. He was
right. Yet for these very reasons it would have been better had a
few ounces of melanite done the business, and blasted the crag and
its foul associations for ever out of sight and out of memory. But
if a commencement were once made in this way, where could we
consistently stop before we had blown the whole seaboard of the
colony into the sea? While such associations remain it is not to be
wondered at that the people of Sydney continue to be proud of their
historically beautiful harbour.</p>

<p>When the hold had been cleared, the convicts unchained, and the
corpses thrown overboard, those who survived were ranged up in
three lines on deck. The convict-ship was surrounded by a fleet of
boats, packed with pardoned pick-pockets eager to welcome their
newly-arrived acquaintances. No one was allowed on board. A boat
approached too closely to the ship that carried Holt, and was
challenged by the sentinel. The rowers did not move away as quickly
as the sentinel desired. "He levelled his musket, and fired," says
Holt; "the ball passed through the arm and then the body of a young
man, who instantly expired. When I got on shore I heard that this
man bore a good character; the murderer was brought on shore, tried
for wilful murder, and acquitted. But to save him from the
vengeance of the people he was sent to Norfolk Island, where Divine
vengeance followed him, for I saw him with a deformed frame and
covered with vermin." The ship was now visited by Captain Johnstone
and other officers, with privileged spectators. Captain Johnstone
read from the indent the name of every convict, offence, sentence,
and place of conviction. Those whose trades or professions made
them of public use were claimed by the Government. Then the
officers of the New South Wales Corps had their choice. The rest
were scrambled for by the inhabitants, according to their position
or influence.</p>

<p><i>Place aux dames!</i> We have explained the principle of
natural selection that obtained on the women's ship. It was
repeated when they arrived in port. Lieutenant Bond, of the
Marines, describes what took place in all its naked brutality. And
here it may be observed that whenever, in such portions of our
narrative as this, the facts and details of Australian story become
too gross and revolting for editorial description, this writer has
contented himself with transcribing the simple words of those
eye-witnesses whom no mock-modesty restrained. Adam and Eve before
the fall were shameless from excess of innocence; these felicitous
creatures arrived at the same point in the circle by travelling in
a directly opposite direction.</p>

<p>"The commissioned officers come on board," says Lieutenant Bond,
"and as they stand upon deck select such females as are most
agreeable in their persons; who generally, upon such occasions,
endeavour to set themselves off to the best advantage. In this
state some have been known to live for years, and to have borne
children. The non-commissioned officers, then, are permitted to
select for themselves; the privates next; and lastly, those
convicts who, having been in the country a considerable time, and
having realised some property, are enabled to procure the
Governor's permission to take to themselves a female convict." Thus
was the Scriptural injunction to increase and multiply obeyed. Yet
it is significant that it was those convicts only who had realised
some property who were enabled to "procure" the Governor's
permission to follow the Mosaic counsel, and thus enable their
descendants to boast with realistic truth of their "ancestors by
purchase." But after this process of selection had been gone
through, there was still a rejected residuum left. Lieutenant Bond
has no scruple in telling us how the authorities disposed of
these.</p>

<p>"The remainder, who are not thus chosen, are brought on shore,
and have small huts assigned them; but, through the want of some
regular employment, are generally concerned in every artifice and
villainy which is committed."</p>

<p>Then follows a sentence which, to have its full significance,
must be read beside what has been said of the officers of the
"rum-selling corps."</p>

<p>"Females of this description," it runs, "are usually employed in
selling such cargoes of ships as are purchased by the officers."
This unholy partnership bore its appropriate fruit in the
disorders, the outrages both illegal and legalised, and the
wholesale executions of this squalid time.</p>

<p class="b">Page 11</p>

<p>So the convict population entered upon its inheritance. There is
a weird story told by an old writer, in which he describes how a
dead man regains consciousness beyond the Acheron, and meets again
in the world of shades the forms of those whom he knew in life, and
from whom he thought he had parted for ever. Some of the most
dramatic passages in Dante's "Inferno" are descriptive of his
meeting with the damned souls of his Florentine acquaintances in
the Malebolge pool. The position of the newly-arrived convict was
not dissimilar. It is a dismal parallel. Dead, and judicially
damned by the savage laws at home&mdash;there were over 300 capital
offences at the beginning of the century&mdash;he regained
consciousness after his long Styx-like voyage to be in time for his
re-awakening in hell. The tortures were there, and the damned. One
of the first men Holt saw on his arrival was a man whom he saw
tried, and on whom he had heard passed the awful sentence of death.
Such encounters were frequent. It was an eerie world, peopled with
criminal ghosts. The one thing needful was the attendant demons.
But the New South Wales Corps was there, so that the demons were
never missed.</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter VIII. The Convict on
Shore.</h2>

<p>"The greater number of overseers in the colony," wrote a man who
was himself in charge of a chain-gang, "have been criminals
themselves, and have neither prudence, honesty, nor humanity. They
are ruffians, who are actuated and influenced by the worst
passions, and frequently flog an unfortunate wretch for complaining
of their oppression." These were the gentle creatures to whose
tender mercies the newly-arrived convict was now handed over. When
a convict had passed through the horrors of the voyage, and the
Inferno of convictism in the colony, and had shown to the
satisfaction of his very competent judges that he had been improved
into the lowest grade of brutality, he was made an overseer of a
chain-gang. By this means the standard of brutality and barbarism
was efficiently kept up. By an exact analogy, and with a very
slight modification of the principle governing the same process, we
find the traditions of convict government surviving in the colony
to this day, with a criminal code which, for sanguinary brutality,
will compare favourably with that of any other country in the
world&mdash;with the single exception, perhaps, of
Crim-Tartary.</p>

<p>The labour-gangs were drafted away into the Parramatta or the
Hawkesbury districts, and set to work in the fields like the beasts
of the same. The political prisoner, Holt, has a note of something
he saw on entering one of these cultivation-paddocks for the first
time. The Reverend Mr. Marsden&mdash;we must deal with this worthy
presently&mdash;Mr. Atkins&mdash;the Judge-Advocate, who also
claims a space in the story&mdash;Captain Johnstone and Dr.
Thompson were with him.</p>

<p>"We proceeded to a Government settlement. At a distance I saw
about fifty men at work, as I thought, dressed in nankeen jackets,
but on nearer approach I found them naked, except for a pair of
loose trousers. Their skin was tanned by the sun and climate to
that colour. I felt much pity for the poor wretches."</p>

<p>A little conversation ensued, which is worth
recording:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain Johnstone addressed me, saying, 'Mr. Holt, you are a
good farmer, I suppose?'</p>

<p>"'I do well enough with horses and oxen, but not with men,' said
I.</p>

<p>"Dr. Thompson then said, 'Do you not think these men would
understand you better than horses or oxen?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, sir,' I replied, 'but it appears great brutality to work
men in this manner.'</p>

<p>"'Well,' said he, 'it matters not what you think about it, you
will soon come into it.' The humane doctor, it will be seen, had
the profoundest confidence in the brutalising effects of the system
on all who were brought into contact with its operation. And he was
right."</p>

<p class="caption">A chain-gang overseer.</p>

<p>The soil of Parramatta and its vicinity is scored as deeply by
convict-labour as ever the backs of the convicts were excoriated by
the lash. Every hill, probably, has seen its whipping-post, and
every field has been watered by convict blood. The gallows on
Constitution Hill stretched its black, gaunt arm like a grisly
sceptre over the land, claiming everything in view by the right of
exclusive possession. To this day the ghost of dead and buried
convictism broods over the district, which bears a repute in old
colonial history not second either to that of Port Arthur or
Norfolk Island. Horrible stories of convict murders, of men flogged
to death, of convicts at the triangles and on the gallows, hang
like dead-weights on this chapter of our miserable colonial
story.</p>

<p>The Government regulation set apart a certain quantity of work
to be done in a given time. The persons to whom convicts were
assigned gave this out to their white labour by the day, week, or
month. The convict was to be paid a certain price for all the work
he did beyond the stipulated quantity. Each man cost his employer
12<i>s</i>. per week, for rations, lodging, and such clothing as he
had. If any were idle, and did not do the regulated quantity of
work:</p>

<p>"...It was only necessary to take them before a magistrate,"
says a writer of the time, "and he would order them 25 lashes of
the cat on their backs for the first offence, 50 for the second,
and so on; and if that would not do"&mdash;in some cases it did not
do, because the slave-driver was so anxious to get some return for
his 12<i>s</i>. per week that he compelled his victims to work
while their wounds were still gaping&mdash;"they were at last put
into a gaol-gang, and made to work in irons from morning till
night."</p>

<p>There are some instances given when an occasional holder of
convict labour treated his men with a certain tolerance. These
cases were few, and happy was the convict who could get into such a
service.</p>

<p>"Most of them," we are told, "by finding out that honesty was
the best policy, became sincerely honest and well-conducted, and
lived and died valuable members of society. So much does gentle and
mild treatment win upon the minds of men, while harsh severity and
coercion hardens their hearts, and brutalises their
characters."</p>

<p>But the gaolers of these men and the officials of the settlement
cared very little about these moral observations. It was not to
their interest to see their victims become valuable members of
society. That interfered with the dishonest fortunes these officers
were making. It was to their interest that the unhappy convict
should be remorselessly and hopelessly ground down. It was on this
view that they consistently acted.</p>

<p>The magistrates were in collusion with the officers, and the
judges with the magistrates. Judge Dore was nearly always drunk,
and Judge-Advocate Atkins, who relieved him, was more drunk still.
But this only sharpened their appetite for blood. In Governor
Bligh's report on the colony he expressly mentions that
Judge-Advocate Richard Atkins had repeatedly pronounced sentence of
death in moments of intoxication. Mann, who has written about the
early days, writes this with a running pen, as it were:</p>

<p>"As instances of the irregularities [this word is Machiavellian]
that have been practised by some of those in magisterial
capacities, I need repeat none others than that I have known men
without trial to be sentenced to transportation by a single
magistrate at his own barrack; and free men, after having been
acquitted by a court of criminal judicature, to be banished to one
or other of the dependent settlements; and I have heard a
magistrate tell a prisoner who was then being examined for a
capital offence, and had some things on him supposed to be stolen,
that were he not going to be hanged so soon, he (the magistrate)
would be d&mdash;&mdash;d if he would not make him say from whence
he got them; nor do I believe it less true that records of an
examination, wherein a respectable young man was innocently
engaged, have been destroyed by the same magistrate before whom the
depositions were taken."</p>

<p>It need only be added to this that transportation meant hard
labour, often for life, in the coal-mines of Newcastle, or
banishment to Norfolk Island.</p>

<p class="caption">The majesty of the law--rather the worse for
liquor.</p>

<p>Judge Atkins was not popular, strange to say. He could sentence
men to flogging or transportation with a hiccup, and cock the black
cap over his eye with a leery air as he pronounced the last
sentence of the law in what Bligh euphemistically called his
"moments" of intoxication&mdash;and yet they did not love him!
These accomplishments, and the genially sociable qualities of this
drunken Draco palled on their jaded appetites. So they excogitated
a little plot. Unfortunately, perhaps, it failed in its execution,
and the plotters were arrested. Judge Atkins adjudicated, and this
is what took place:</p>

<p>Question; "Did you hear the prisoner say all this?"</p>

<p>Witness: "No; I only heard him say that he would flog the Judge
to death."</p>

<p>Judge Atkins: "Did he say for what reason he would flog me to
death?"</p>

<p>Witness: "Because, sir, you had ordered men to be flogged, and
they had died from the flogging."</p>

<p>And yet the Judge was not popular&mdash;except, indeed, amongst
the class which admired his firm and uncompromising administration
of the law. Colonial history is always repeating itself, and this
opportunity has not been missed.</p>

<p>"The more convicts that can be made over to individuals, and
taken off the stores, the greater will be the advantage," said a
Whitehall despatch of 1796. The principle thus laid down was
carried out in a very thorough-paced fashion. The labourers worked
from five in the morning till eleven, and from two in the afternoon
to sunset. The Governor in 1800 wrote thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding the number of people brought from Ireland by
the last two ships"&mdash;this was just after the
rebellion&mdash;"we have received no great accumulation of
strength. Many of the prisoners have been either bred up in genteel
life or professions, unaccustomed to hard labour. These are a
dead-weight on the public stores."</p>

<p>Barrington's history, referring to these men, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding the detestation of the crimes many of them are
transported for, yet it was not possible for the Governor to send a
physician, the once sheriff of a county, a Catholic priest, or a
Protestant clergyman and family to the brick-carts, brick-fields,
grubbing-hoe, or the timber-carriage. The lower class of convicts
in these cargoes were mostly old men, fit only for hut-keepers, to
remain at home and prevent robbery while the other inhabitants of
the hut were at labour, thus making good the old proverb, 'Set a
thief to catch a thief.'"</p>

<p>Each officer had 10 assigned servants. A letter to the Duke of
Portland contains a statement that assigned servants "were allotted
to the service of convict prostitute women." In the service of
private masters convicts received such bad treatment that the
Government resented this interference with its privileges, and an
order was issued to the effect that "if any person should beat or
use their (sic) servants ill they will be taken from them to
Government labour, and the offender dealt with according to their
situations in the colony." But if any convict attempted to work for
himself while at assigned service with a view to improving his
condition by-and-bye, he received the reward of his industry in the
shape of 100 lashes and 12 months in gaol. That stopped him for the
time.</p>

<p>"Magistrates," we read, "would oblige one another as employers
in authorising the removal of obnoxious servants, or by inflicting
lashes for supposed disobedience of orders&mdash;an elastic charge
by which the poor fellow lost the benefit of his fixity of
tenure."</p>

<p>Many men were kept in a state of servitude long after the
expiration of their sentences. It was not until 1797 that the
Secretary of State promised that "in future lists shall be sent
from England and Ireland of the terms of sentence." For the first
two years not an item of information on this subject was despatched
with the transports, and only irregularly afterwards. The fact
proves rather conclusively that the Government in England had
little thought of its outcasts as soon as it got them off its
hands.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most painful thing in connection with this part of
our history is the manner in which Australian writers have dealt
with it. The fortunes that were made by the oppression and cruelty
of these early days have been worshipped, and the deeds of the men
who made them glossed over. The unhappy wretches who became their
victims are passed over without a word of pity for their
sufferings, or of reprobation for the conduct of those who caused
them. Yet no class of men ever called more strongly for
reprobation.</p>

<p>"It would have been far more merciful," says an eye-witness of
what he describes, "to have hanged all who violated the laws of
their country, than to have sent them out to New South Wales and
its dependencies, subject to the unmerciful treatment of human
tigers, who tortured or killed those within their power according
to the caprice of the moment. I saw many a fine man die in misery,
inch by inch, from the oppression he experienced&mdash;the most
cruel of all deaths." All this, and more also&mdash;it is almost
impossible to realise it!&mdash;took place during year after year
in sunny New South Wales!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>Chapter IX. Genesis of Our Flogging
Laws.</h2>

<p>When the Australian colonist of to-day wakes up now and then
with a spasm of horrified disgust to find a creature of weak
intellect, or otherwise mentally diseased, deliberately flogged in
the police-stations at the corners of Australian streets, he is
under no misapprehension, as to where our flogging laws and customs
come from. He knows they come down, with the people who make and
administer them, in a kind of un-apostolic but strictly canonical
succession, from the men and the manners of one hundred years ago
at Botany Bay.</p>

<p>It is quite easy to diagnose our progress since that time. We
have only to compare the present with the past. The whistling lash
sings a story in the ears of all who will listen to it, of the
survival in colonial life of the influence of the gaolers of the
convict days. The convicts have gone&mdash;let oblivion go with
them! No offences of theirs could have outweighed their expiation.
But their miserable memories call for the execution of a pitiless
justice on those who once made their chains hang heavier and their
gyves gall deeper, and whose representatives would hang in
convict-irons to-day the free spirit of an Australian people, who
have nothing to do with the past other than to submit to be
governed, as long as it may please them, by the surviving spirit of
the convict-days.</p>

<p>Deserted by God and man, the convicts on their arrival were left
to the mercy of wretches whose characters are best painted by their
own acts. The story becomes too Zola-like in its realistic horror
to be minutely treated by any other than a Zola's pen. Men and
women were flogged alike at the triangle, or at the cart's tail. A
Botany Bay "dozen" was twenty-five lashes, and as many as one
thousand were often ordered and administered. Such a sentence as
this reads now-a-days like a sentence of death by torture, but the
presiding fiends had, to some extent, guarded against that. So we
read in the old stories of men who were cut to pieces from the neck
to the knees, and when all semblance of humanity was thus crushed
out of the quivering jelly that represented the body, as the system
had long since driven the divine image out of the soul, the victim
was saturated in brine to expedite his recovery, so that his
sentence might be completed in a similar way. One such sentence,
signed by Judge-Advocate Atkins, John Harris, and Thomas Jamieson,
is given with others in the report of Colonel Johnstone's
court-martial. It bears date 1807, and sets forth that seven
convicts, having attempted to escape from the settlement, were
recaptured and brought back. They were sentenced: one to receive
1000 lashes; three others, 600 lashes each; one to hard labour in
an iron collar (!) in the coal-mines at Newcastle; and two others
to 200 lashes, with three years' hard labour. It is not difficult
to imagine the genial Judge&mdash;whom, you will remember, certain
convicts unkindly wished to flog to death because men had died
under his floggings&mdash;joining the festive circle after
delivering that appalling sentence, and being carried thereafter
drunk to his quarters by convict servants who were afraid to break
the bloodthirsty ruffian's neck!</p>

<p class="b">Page 13</p>

<p>We get a pleasant little social picture of the Judge-Advocate in
these lines from Holt's recollections. They make that excellent man
live again. He met Atkins arm-in-arm with Barrington, the
pickpocket, in Parramatta one day. "Mr. Atkins asked me into his
house, and Barrington followed. A bottle of rum"&mdash;this
beverage corresponded to Amontillado and the like in those
days&mdash;"was produced, and some pleasant conversation passed. At
length I wished to retire, but Mr. Atkins said he never allowed any
bottle off his table till he saw it emptied. We finished the
half-gallon bottle (!), and were, of course, not a little elevated,
being each of us as full of chatter as a hen magpie in May. Mr.
Atkins was not a Judge then, but acted as a kind of deputy when
Judge Dore was not able; which frequently happened, for when
spirits were plentiful in the colony he was generally indisposed."
This was in 1800.</p>

<p>Another charming vignette is presented in the following terse
bit of description. A number of desperate creatures had been goaded
into an attempt at rebellion. They intended to seize the Governor
and the officials, and rule the colony themselves after disarming
the soldiers. Of course they were detected in their plot and were
duly sentenced to be flogged, under the infliction of which some
died. This is what took place in one instance:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We marched to Toongabbee, where all the Government transports
were kept, who were called out to witness the punishment of the
prisoners. One man was sentenced to receive 300 lashes, and the
method of punishment was such as to make it most effectual. The
unfortunate man had his arms extended round a tree, so that
flinching from the blow was out of the question, for it was
impossible for him to stir. Two men were appointed to
flog&mdash;namely, Richard Rice, a left-handed man, and John
Johnson, the hangman from Sydney"&mdash;one wonders how on earth
they spared him!&mdash;"who was right-handed. They stood on each
side, and I never saw two threshers in a barn move their flails
with more regularity than these two man-killers did, unmoved by
pity, and rather enjoying their horrid employment than otherwise.
The very first blows made the blood spurt out from the man's
shoulders: and I felt so disgusted and horrified that I turned my
face away from the cruel sight...I could only compare these
wretches to a pack of hounds at the death of a hare; or tigers,
that torment their victims before they put them to death."</p>

<p class="caption">Joseph Samuels--the man they couldn't hang.</p>

<p>This is such pleasant reading that we cannot do better than
continue the extract:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have witnessed many horrible scenes," this onlooker goes on
to say, "but this was the most appalling sight I had ever seen. The
day was windy, and I protest that, although I was at least 15 yards
to leeward from the sufferers, the blood, skin, and flesh flew in
my face as the executioners shook it off from their cats. The man
received his whole 300 lashes, during which Doctor Mason used to go
up to him occasionally to feel his pulse, it being contrary to law
to flog a man beyond 50 lashes without having a doctor present. I
shall never forget this humane doctor, as he smiled and said, 'Go
on; this man will tire you both before he fails!' During the time
he was receiving the punishment he never uttered a groan; the only
words he said were, 'Flog me fair; do not strike me on the
neck.'"</p>

<p>The hapless wretch knew that he might sue in vain for further
mercies.</p>

<p>Our apology for continuing these extracts is found in our
existing flogging laws and the whole spirit of our penal
system:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The next prisoner who was tied up was a young lad of about 20
years of age; he also was sentenced to receive 300 lashes. The
first hundred were given on his shoulders, and he was cut to the
bone between the shoulder-blades, which were both bare. The doctor
then directed the next hundred to be inflicted lower down, which
reduced his flesh to such a jelly that the doctor ordered him to
have the remaining hundred on the calves of his legs. During the
whole time he never whimpered or flinched, if, indeed, it had been
possible for him to have done so."</p>

<p>This lad was asked if he would give information about the
alleged plot. He answered that he did not know anything, and if he
did he would not tell.</p>

<p>"You may hang me," said he, "if you like; but you shall have no
music out of my mouth to make others dance upon nothing."</p>

<p>He was put into the cart and sent to the hospital.</p>

<p>"After this terrible execution was over," writes the
eye-witness, with an unconscious touch that will strike the reader
with a strange effect, "the Provost-Marshall and I walked to
Parramatta, and went to a tavern kept by James Larra, an honest
Jew, where we dined upon a nice lamprey and some hung beef."</p>

<p>Just so! The good Provost-Marshall could not live on floggings.
He required more substantial refreshment. But even the beef he
assimilated happened to be hung!</p>

<p>There is a story of how Governor King ordered a woman 100 lashes
for using impertinent language to an overseer. In 1806 the old
Sydney <i>Gazette</i> mentioned in a paragraph that Margaret Camel,
being an accessory to a theft, was sentenced to be publicly whipped
through the streets of Sydney, at the cart's tail. This was a
common street scene; as well as the procession of convicts to the
place of execution, with their officers beside them, in a cart.</p>

<p>It is Byron who says that the first sight that met his eyes in
an English town after returning from abroad was the spectacle of a
woman being whipped through the streets at the cart's tail, and
Botany Bay was not to be left behind in such a matter as
this&mdash;not, it may believed, even if Judge-Advocate Atkins and
his compeers had to build a cart for the purpose themselves. In
1829 Judge Dowling sentenced a man to be flogged in this way from
the George-street Police-court to the Market-street wharf, for
stealing a pair of oars. So the popular mind was familiarised with
horrors, and children gazed on in pleased appreciation as men and
women were hanged and flogged in public for their encouragement.
Thus the natural feeling even of the young was blunted&mdash;and
thus, perhaps, it comes about that we have been unable to see the
barbarism of some of our traditionary laws, and have been content
to retain them so long.</p>

<p>While the flogger was busy, the hangman was not idle. It is
almost a farce to describe the legal proceedings that led up to
these executions, for legal proceedings, properly so-called, there
were none. A criminal court consisted of seven naval or military
officers&mdash;the officers of the New South Wales Corps! To hang a
man a total of five voices was needed. The old records tell how the
proceedings were conducted. Eight men were charged, in 1803, with
stealing nine pecks of wheat. They had been tried for something
else and acquitted, but the Court was clearly determined to have
them, for they were escaped prisoners. So the second charge was
brought. The prosecutor, as in all such matters, conducted his own
case. In this instance, the Judge-Advocate, who always framed the
indictment, prosecuted. The Court deliberated for some minutes, and
then passed sentence&mdash;"All guilty&mdash;death!" That was
all.</p>

<p class="b">Page 14</p>

<p>For a good many years the authorities just ran up a gallows
wherever they happened to require it&mdash;on Pinchgut, for
instance; Lower George-street was a favourite convincing ground,
but afterwards, always with an eye to the picturesque, the gallows
was removed to a place known to fame as Gallows Hill. The officials
liked to see a fellow-creature dangling against the sky-line. It
added to the scenic effect of the landscape. In 1804 the gallows
was removed to the corner of Park and Castlereagh streets, where
the Barley Mow Hotel now stands; this step was probably taken in
sheer disgust at the failure of an execution on the old site.
Joseph Samuels, who was suspended in 1803, for stealing a desk
containing money belonging to one Mary Breeze, broke the rope in
the middle the first time, unrove it at the fastening on a second
attempt, and, on a third trial, snapped the rope once more. A
hangman with any pride in his profession would resign after this
bungle, but the Provost-Marshall merely went to the Governor, and
had the man reprieved for his agility. An execution or a
reprieve&mdash;sentence of life or death&mdash;never cost a second
thought to the officials of those early days. It was not till the
hanging customs were seriously curtailed that the authorities
fought to the last gasp before they yielded up an erring creature's
life to the popular sentiment asking that an execution might be
stayed.</p>

<p>During the first six years 95 persons were hanged. In a small
population decimated by sickness and famine, this was a highly
encouraging average. But no authentic record&mdash;what a horrible
chapter of miseries this blank space must cover!&mdash;was kept of
the executions up to 1825. In August, 1821, 19 men were hanged
together in Lower George-street, to which place the gallows had
been moved back from the sand-hills behind the new Barracks. Just
before that it stood at the corner of the Protestant burial-ground
in Devonshire-street; and still earlier, and after leaving the site
of the present Barley Mow Hotel, it was erected near the site of
the present Barker's Mills, in Sussex-street. The first execution
at the gate of Darlinghurst Gaol took place in 1841.</p>

<p>Why is this record of the hanging and flogging customs of the
early days revived? it may be asked. And why should public
sentiment be outraged by the revival of such memories? Simply
because such record explains the genesis of our own existing
Australian customs; and because the people who can stand those will
stand anything that may be said on this or any other subject.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>Chapter X. The Convicts'
Hy-Brasil.</h2>

<p>In coming to Australia, therefore, it will be seen, as the
philanthropic Mr. Eden prophesied, that "the devoted convict was
not seated for life on a bed of roses." Enough has been said to
show that of all the vile spots on the earth, Botany Bay was the
vilest&mdash;always with a reservation in favour of Norfolk Island
and Van Diemen's Land, which will receive attention in their proper
places. The consequence was that the convict was dissatisfied with
the maternal provision the mother-country had made in his regard,
and was even known, on repeated occasions, to endeavour to make his
escape.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more miserable than the records of these
attempts. They took various forms&mdash;sometimes attempted mutiny,
sometimes flight by sea, and sometimes flight by land. In the very
first year of colonisation an attempt of the last-mentioned kind
was made. The desperate convicts had heard from the blacks a wild
tale to which their own hopes gave the colouring. Some 500 miles to
the south-west, they gathered, there was a city of white men. A
plan was formed to break away from the settlement, and journey on
until this storied city was reached. It was a kind of convicts'
Hy-Brasil&mdash;that fabulous island on the waters that appeared
for a moment to the eyes of old-time visionaries, and "flamed, and
flashed, and passed away." The convicts' hope was just as illusory.
Sixteen of them were captured and brought to Sydney, and under the
influence of a merciless flogging the wild hope seems to have
evaporated for a time. Four convicts were allowed to go with four
soldiers to see if there was any truth in the report of the white
man's city. In ten days three returned, and the fourth 23 days
later. He brought nothing back except a bird of Paradise, and,
strange to say, we have no record of this man being flogged. But it
showed the dreamers that their hope was a vain one, and it left
them to their despair. The settlement was a prison as strongly
secure as though it were girdled by strong stone walls and iron
bars. As he entered the Heads, the convict might read the fatal
sentence that Dante read over the gates of Hell, "All ye who enter
here, abandon hope!"</p>

<p>There is a story of a convict fisherman named Bryant, which is
as romantic as Robinson Crusoe and as dramatic as Monte Cristo. He
was engaged in fishing for the supply of the settlement, and while
so engaged the desperate hope came to him to make his escape in his
fishing-boat, and so return to England with his wife and two
children. It is touching to read these instances of a kindly
domestic feeling amongst the cruelly-outraged victims of those
social laws which lead to ignorance as well as to crime. He spoke
to the master of a Dutch vessel which brought provisions to the
colony from Batavia. The honest Dutchman seems to have sympathised
with the poor fellow's natural desire for liberty. He gave him a
compass, quadrant, and chart, and such information as he could.
Bryant mentioned his project to seven others, and when all was
ready they put some provisions with Bryant's wife and children into
the boat, and so set sail. They suffered horribly on the voyage,
but still they sailed bravely on in their little craft. One man was
drowned in the Straits of Sunda, but the rest actually succeeded in
reaching Timor, and then Batavia. But, alas for the vanity of these
poor wretches' hopes! Bryant and one of his children, with two of
the convicts, died here after all their perils past; but at least
they obtained their liberty. Not so the others. The Dutch
Government at Batavia arrested them, and afterwards handed them
over to H.M.S. <i>Pandora</i>. No touch of nature shows through the
whole of this melancholy business except what we find in the
conduct of these convict waifs. The <i>Pandora</i> took them round
the Cape to England, where they were tried and committed to Newgate
until the term of their original sentences had expired. The convict
period has many weird stories, but no more like this.</p>

<p>Then the convicts became possessed with an idea that they would
reach China by travelling overland. Successive parties made their
escape, and set out with that intention. Four convicts were found
in the bush near Port Stephens in 1795; they made their escape from
Parramatta five years before. In 1791, 20 male and female convicts
started to walk to China. Some of them died in the bush, and others
were brought back in the last stages of starvation. Fiji was first
colonised by escaped prisoners, who copied as far as possible there
the barbarism their gaolers had taught them at Botany Bay. The
first mention of gold in Australia was made by an escaped prisoner.
He asked for the free pardon of himself and a female prisoner as
his reward for the discovery. Two soldiers were sent with him to
see the spot, and he took the opportunity to make his escape. His
gaolers were very much disappointed at his infidelity to his
engagement, and when they caught him they expostulated with him
severely&mdash;with a "cat." This improved his moral perceptions,
and he again volunteered to enrich his torturers. Their greed led
them into the cunning trap again, but they soon caught this
<i>farceur</i>, and he confessed that the gold he showed in the
first instance was made out of two gold rings and a brass button.
This quite disgusted the officials. They flogged him again, and so
we hear no more of him. Yet some day he will get a statue, too.</p>

<p>The daily "muster" was established to keep a check on the
convicts who were so fond of running away. Different districts had
different times for muster, but the persons for whose benefit this
thoughtful institution was devised took such astute advantage of
that circumstance that a uniform hour was appointed, and an order
issued in 1801 which said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Any person not appearing at the General Musters will be taken
up as vagrants (<i>sic</i>) and punished to the utmost rigour of
the law, if free; and if a prisoner, will be sentenced to one
month's confinement in the Battery Gang." In 1806 an escaped
convict, who was hard pressed, reported himself to a constable as
absent without leave. This active and intelligent officer gave him
a good dinner, and then went on to take him before a magistrate.
But the other man held other views. His benefactor's beef had
demoralised him. He therefore lifted that good man up in his arms
and threw him into the river. Then he ran rapidly away.</p>

<p class="b">Page 15</p>

<p>Many an anxious eye turned with sickening hope to that far-away
line of dim blue hills to be seen in the distance from Sydney. In
those early days an idea gained ground that a nation of white men
dwelt beyond, and not all the stories of Prester John together
exercised such a fatal fascination as this alluring fable. The
Governor said this notion was "unfounded, wicked as it is false,
and calculated to bring the believers of it to destruction." So it
did. He is always a good prophet who can secure the fulfilment of
his own prophecy. A good many died in making the attempt to pass
the mountains, and a good many were flogged within an inch of the
same result when they were caught. A convict explorer, named
Wilson, says he saw the skeletons of 50 runaway prisoners on the
road to the Blue Mountains. In 1802 a case is mentioned of some
escapees who had got to the Nepean river, others to the coast,
while the rest of the party "had wandered about near the place they
had left, after being absent about ten days, most of them nearly
starved, and living on grass for five days out of the ten." Another
party was subsequently sent to see if the Chinese really were
located within measurable distance to the northward. A
vaguely-described "copper-coloured people" were also searched for.
A boat's crew accidentally picked up these explorers in a spot
where they had been for nine days, and "where they must soon have
perished but for this miraculous event. They were brought back
almost exhausted for want of food."</p>

<p>Quite frequently attempts were made to seize ships or boats. In
1797 the <i>Cumberland</i> was seized by convicts, and the
<i>Venus</i>, belonging to Robert Campbell, in 1799, and again, or
one of the same name, in 1806. In 1808 the <i>Harrington</i> was
taken out of the harbour by convicts, but H.M.S. <i>Phoenix</i>
captured her in the Indian seas. However, they got another chance,
as she was wrecked soon after on the Laconian coast, and all the
convicts escaped or perished. The <i>Unity</i> was captured in
1813, and the <i>Trial</i> in 1816. The latter was wrecked, and her
escapees drowned or killed by the natives. The <i>William
Caesar</i> was taken in 1817, and the <i>Isabella</i> in 1823. This
last was never heard of afterwards. As late as 1853, 22 convicts on
their way from Van Diemen's Land to Norfolk Island seized the
<i>Lady Franklin</i>, kept the vessel for 11 days, and then loaded
the boats with provisions and left. The murderer Knatchbull was the
hero of such an attempt in 1832, but it did not succeed, and Mr.
Knatchbull lived to serve out his sentence on Norfolk Island and
come back to Sydney to be hanged.</p>

<p>Bass, in his journal&mdash;to return to the period of this part
of our story&mdash;found seven poor wretches marooned on one of
those forbidding rocks in Bass's Strait. They had been away eight
months, and seven others who had escaped with them had
treacherously left them there to perish. They wanted to travel
northward "to throw themselves on his Majesty's mercy." They forgot
that the gentlemen who represented his Majesty had no mercy. Bass
could not take them away, as his boat was too small, but he gave
them a musket and some ammunition, a compass, and some
fishing-lines. Two were ill, and these he took into his boat. The
rest he landed on the mainland, and they started on their long walk
back to Botany Bay. "When they parted with Mr. Bass and his crew,
who gave them what clothes they could spare," says the story, "some
tears were shed on both sides." An honest touch of nature,
this.</p>

<p>Although it does not properly belong to this part of our story,
this is, for many reasons, a fitting place to do justice to the
memory of one of the few men who ever showed a human sympathy with
these forlorn convict wretches. When the reader is sickened by the
rapacity and cruelty of the New South Wales Corps, and the gaolers
of the penal settlement generally, he may turn for refreshment to
the name of Colonel Collins. "His conduct was exemplary, and his
disposition most humane. His treatment of the runaway convicts was
conciliatory, and even kind. He would go into the forests among the
natives to allow those poor creatures, the runaways, an opportunity
of returning to their former condition. And, half dead with cold
and hunger, they would come and drop on their knees before him,
imploring pardon for their behaviour." He would give them food and
clothing, and send them back to their work. At this time Colonel
Collins was Governor of Van Diemen's Land, But he died.</p>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>Chapter XI. The Convict in
Revolt.</h2>

<p>Besides these attempted escapes by land and sea, the convicts
tried to break their fetters by rebellion. Goaded to desperation as
they were by the brutality of their gaolers, and with the utter
hopelessness of their abandonment perpetually staring them in the
face, it was but natural that convict flesh and blood should
mutiny. Isolated cases of assigned servants rising against their
masters are numerous. In a moment of natural self-assertion a
convict might strike his master or overseer. It would not be long
before he found himself triced up to the triangles, and tortured
until the capricious vengeance of his victim was entirely glutted.
He would be cut down with murder in his heart, and it would not be
long before the body of his tyrant would be found lying about,
while a new bushranger would take to the bush. Instances of the
kind might be multiplied endlessly.</p>

<p>The first mention of an organised movement among the convicts
was in 1796. They began to complain with fastidious particularity
that the record of their convictions and sentences had not been
brought out with them. They clamoured for this luxurious attention,
as if it mattered to their gaolers whether they carried their
chains for five or fifty years. However, as we have seen, the
matter received attention at home on the Governor's
representations. In 1800, Governor King began to complain of the
Irish political prisoners. They appear to have objected to the
treatment the thieves and felons were subjected to. King complained
to the home authorities of "the restless disposition of these
people, which has not a little been aggravated by the artifices of
Harold, the priest." There appears to have been absolutely no other
foundation for the reported conspiracy than is found in the
following from Barrington's history:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A convict who had, with great earnestness, propagated a report
that many pikes had been secretly made, and, to prevent detection,
sunk in a well-known part of the harbour, was examined. This
fellow, on being examined by the magistrates, confessed he knew
nothing of what he had stated, and said he was intoxicated at the
time. For this he was severely punished."</p>

<p>Harold, the priest, was examined, but "nothing appeared to
incriminate him." A general search was made among the persons
suspected, in all parts of the colony at the same time; "the
examination took place on the 15th, but nothing was discovered that
could furnish the smallest evidence of the reported crimes." But
this did not prevent wholesale floggings taking place in all
directions to extract information. Under the influence of abject
terror, some scared wretches invented stories, but they
contradicted each other and were flogged for their pains, while
others were sent to Norfolk Island without trial; and, here, again,
it is strange to note how our history repeats itself. Since the
introduction of responsible government we have seen a New South
Wales Premier excite a similar scare, and call the dead from the
grave&mdash;in the shape of the Kiama Ghost&mdash;to prove his
slanders on a large section of the community. Our political leaders
have studied their politics, as they have their laws, in the old
convict records of the semi-savage and benighted past.</p>

<p>Thomas Holt, whom we have so often quoted, was one of the
suspects on this occasion. He was taken out of bed after midnight,
and brought from his place at Brush Farm to the gaol in Sydney. He
gives a picture of the gaoler:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Daniel McKay, a person whose acquaintance I did not covet,
for he had been a transport convicted of picking pockets. We do not
attach much mildness of character to the turnkey of a gaol. It
sometimes happens that a petty larceny rascal, or even a felon, who
has not been steeped in the lowest dregs of villainy, may be so far
reformed as to be thought worthy of being one of the many-headed
dogs of a county gaol; a kind of deputy devil, with eminent
qualities as a tormentor; such a man, in comparison to Daniel
McKay, would have been thought worthy to be made a member of a
colonial parliament, had such a thing existed, or a justice of the
peace, or a judge. The mantle of grim prophecy seems to have fallen
unawares on Mr. Holt.</p>

<p>"On my being handed over to his keeping the following
ensued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Weel, Master General Hoult, and you're welcome; I'll be
teaching you a new exercise, for I hae nae doot but ye'll be
hangit, and I wish ye may, for weel ye deserve it.'</p>

<p>"I asked him if there was any news; he answered, with a sneer,
'Oh, yes; there be some foo of your Irishers to be hangit
presently.'"</p>

<p>This was very consoling, but Holt had enough influence to save
him, by the merest accident, from being hanged.</p>

<p class="b">Page 16</p>

<p>But the "Rebellion of 1804," as it is grandiloquently termed by
the fantastic creatures who call themselves the historians of
Australia, was the chief <i>fiasco</i> of this kind. A great many
convicts were employed in the slave-gangs about Castle Hill, near
Parramatta, and reports used to come in that mischief was intended.
Holt describes what was taking place, and he had every opportunity
of observing as he exercised authority in the immediate
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"The lower people," he says, "convicts and others, both English
and Irish, seeing their torment increasing in this most ill-managed
colony, conceived the idea that they could overpower the army,
possess themselves of the settlement, and eventually make their
escape from it. Where they were to go did not enter into the
contemplation of these poor wretches, who fancied, at all events,
they could not be worse off than they were already. Their numbers
were contemptible, and their means still more so; therefore, they
must assuredly fail and be hanged. I told them"&mdash;[in response
to solicitations to join them]&mdash;"I would have nothing to do
with the business, and if such a scheme should be put into
execution, I would act on the side of the Government. Had I no wife
or children, and been disposed to take the lead on this occasion, I
could have made a short job of it. The military were so careless
and lax in their discipline that anyone of skill could have formed
a plan to surprise them, and might have taken magazine, army, and
all in an hour."</p>

<p>Informers and false-swearers abounded in the settlement, and the
officials soon heard of this wild plot. When the convicts broke out
on March 4, the Governor issued this:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"PROCLAMATION!</p>

<p>"Whereas a number of labouring convicts of Castle Hill and other
parts of this district have assembled, and, in a rebellious and
daring manner, have attacked and robbed several of his Majesty's
peaceable and loyal subjects of their property and arms, and
proceeded therewith to great acts of outrages which the
preservation of the lives and property of his Majesty's liege
subjects demand an immediate stop being put to by the most
efficient means (<i>sic</i>),<br>
<br>
"I do, therefore, proclaim the districts of Parramatta, Castle
Hill, Toongabbee, Prospect, Seven and Baulkham Hills, the
Hawkesbury, and the Nepean to be in a<br>
<br>
"STATE OF REBELLION,<br>
<br>
"and do establish Martial Law throughout those districts."</p>

<p>Then Major Johnstone set out with 40 soldiers and came up with
the rebels at about half-past 10 next morning. It is amusing to
read the various accounts of what took place. Says Major
Johnstone:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I rode up to them, accompanied by <i>one</i> trooper (the
emphasis is his own), and remonstrated with them on the impropriety
of their conduct, and desired them to surrender, which they
peremptorily refused. I went up a second time with a trooper, and
desired to speak with their two leaders, who came up to us, when we
forcibly drove them in to the detachments with pistols at their
heads; the rest, to the number of 250, dispersed in every
direction, and we have been under the necessity of killing nine and
wounding a great many, the number we cannot ascertain."</p>

<p>The Major, it will be seen, was a military strategist of a high
order. He just hoisted out a flag of truce, as it were, deluded two
confiding wretches into trusting him, and then drove them into the
detachment with pistols at their heads! But there are other
stories.</p>

<p>Holt heard from Mr. Cox another account. The Major went up to
Cunninghame, the leader, and told him that if he had any real
grievance he would endeavour to get it redressed.</p>

<p>"Cunninghame advanced, took off his hat, and with it in one hand
and a sword in the other, said, 'Death or liberty!' Johnstone made
no attempt to molest him, but Laycock, who stood 6 feet 6 inches, a
quartermaster in his corps, came up and with one blow killed
Cunninghame on the spot. On this the whole of the mob took to their
heels, and many were shot in the pursuit."</p>

<p>This account justifies the memory of the commanding officer so
far as to show that he took shelter behind his big quarter-master,
and only emerged in time to give the order to fire on a huddled
crowd of panic-stricken men. There are one or two other versions,
but they differ in no important particular.</p>

<p>It was, doubtless, magnificent sport chasing the flying rebels,
of whom so many were wounded that the Major did not take the
trouble to count them up. A good many got away, but the soldiers
succeeded in bagging a fairly good catch. But if the chase was
sport, and the murder of flying men a delight and a joy, the real
pleasure was tasted when the business was over. When the pursuit
was ended those who were caught were brought before a
court-martial. Under ordinary circumstances this term associates
itself in the mind with an assembly of officers and gentlemen; but
it must be borne in mind that the present use of the term refers to
a herd of gaolers and tradesmen wearing the King's uniform by
accident.</p>

<p>"It was arranged that lots should be drawn from a hat," for the
court-martial found them all guilty, and the soldiers could
scarcely hang everybody; "and that every third man whose name was
drawn should be hanged. Many fine young men were strung up like
dogs, but the arrival of the Governor put a stop to this
extraordinary proceeding. Among those hanged, there was a nephew of
the Surgeon-general, Mr. Jamieson, but this was kept, as far as it
could be, a profound secret." This settled the fate of the
Rebellion of 1804.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>Chapter XII. The "Scotch
Martyrs."</h2>

<p>One of the heroic stories of the period is that of "the Scotch
Martyrs," who were transported in 1794. They were Messrs. Muir,
Palmer, Gerald, Margarot, and Skirving, and the story of these men
is a standing comment on the British civilisation and enlightenment
of the day. At about this time England had just goaded the
Americans and Irish into rebellion, and begun her career of arms in
India under Wellesley, the period of fraud being over. She had
founded New South Wales, and frustrated the designs of Providence
by making Australia the abode of all the vile growths that her own
grim social and political codes had called into existence. Having
successfully created such a receptacle for vice and crime, it is
instructive to see the class of people she sent out to fill it.</p>

<p>Muir was a Scotch barrister, and when an association was formed
in London to bring about certain reforms in Parliament by
constitutional means, his sympathies were enlisted, He helped to
form a branch of the "Friends of the People" in Glasgow. All the
members subscribed to a declaration of adherence to the established
government, and claimed to be acting merely within their
constitutional rights. The Glasgow Association reprinted some
tracts issued by the London branch, and Mr. Muir was thereupon
charged with "sedition." The others were indicted with him, and the
trial is one of the scandals of history. The ruffianly Brabourne
helped to try the cases, and all the Court influence was worked on
and off the Bench to secure a conviction. When the accused left
their hotel to attend the Court the horses were taken from the
chaise, and an applauding crowd took their places. Arches and
wreaths were held over Margarot as he passed along the street,
bearing such words as "Reason," "Liberty," and so forth inscribed
thereon. The Lord-Provost, with some constables and a "press-gang,"
met the procession, smashed the emblems, and took many into
custody. There was never any doubt about the verdict. Margarot was
sentenced to 14 years' transportation beyond the seas, Muir to
seven years, and the other's to various terms.</p>

<p>An appeal was made to the Commons on behalf of Muir, and the
Right Hon. William Adam moved and Mr. Fox seconded an address to
the Crown on his behalf. The Government whipped up its party and
defeated the motion, and the Annual Register for 1794 says that on
February 10:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Messrs. Muir, Margarot, Skirving, and Palmer were removed from
Newgate in a post-coach and four, attended by two King's
messengers. We learn that they were taken on board vessels bound to
Botany Bay."</p>

<p>Gerald followed a few months later. The Secretary of State
charged the gaolers of these men to "keep a watchful eye over their
conduct," and to search their effects diligently for seditious
literature before allowing them to land. Brick huts along the side
of Sydney Cove were assigned for their residences. Muir afterwards
lived at Hunter's Hill, which he named after his patrimonial estate
in Scotland, and Gerald bought land where the Botanic Gardens now
are in Sydney. They made repeated applications to be allowed to
return home, but the vindictive spirit that sent them forth dreaded
freedom of opinion too much to accede to these requests.</p>

<p>Gerald, who was a man of amiable and refined character, died in
1796, and was buried in his little plot of ground at his own
request. Skirving only survived him three days.</p>

<p>"A dysentery was the apparent cause of his death," says Collins,
"but his heart was broken. Amongst us he was a pious, honest,
worthy character. In this settlement his political principles never
manifested themselves, but all his solicitude seemed to be to
evince himself the friend of human nature. <i>Requiescat in
pace</i>" adds this good Collins, feelingly. A "friend of human
nature" was more likely to rest peacefully under the ground than on
it in Botany Bay at that time.</p>

<p class="b">Page 17</p>

<p>When the history of these prosecutions became known in France
and America, the newly-awakened popular sentiment of those
countries was deeply stirred. The whole business was one of
barefaced and shameless persecution. The late Chief Justice
Cockburn has stated that the jury in Muir's case was packed by Lord
Jeffrey of <i>Edinburgh Review</i> fame; the former never referred
to this iniquitous case without horror. Muir's treatment in prison,
we are expressly told, was vindictive and cruel. He employed his
time after reaching Sydney in alleviating the miseries of the more
abandoned of the convicts, and in protesting against being treated
himself as a felon. The speeches of Adams and Fox had been read,
and honest men had felt their blood boil at the story they told.
Washington, in America, interested himself on behalf of this
sufferer for liberty, and a vessel called the <i>Otter</i> was
fitted out to enable him to escape from the colony. She arrived in
Port Jackson under pretence of trade, and on February 11 Mr. Muir
was smuggled on board, and made his escape out to sea. The ship got
safely away, but was wrecked off California. All were drowned save
Muir and two sailors. They followed the shore-line for four
thousand miles on foot to reach Panama. At Vera Cruz, Muir shipped
as a sailor on board a Spanish man-of-war going home. But
capricious fate still followed him, for the ship was captured by a
British frigate, and Muir, in the conflict, had the top of his head
shot away. When the boarding-party came on board one of the men
lifted the apparently lifeless body of Muir in his arms to throw it
overboard with the rest, when an officer saw a Bible in his clasped
hand. He opened it, and knew Muir's name as that of a dear old
friend and schoolfellow. He was carefully examined, found still
living, and sent to the hospital at Cadiz. Here he recovered, and
the French Directory, hearing of him again, invited him to
Bordeaux, where he was entertained at a banquet by 500 French
gentlemen. Then he went to Paris, where he was publicly welcomed.
He rose to speak at the banquet given him there, and fainted from
excitement and weakness. He was taken to Chantilly, where he died
in 1798, the French Government decreeing a State funeral to this
early colonist, of whom Australian political leaders have never
mentioned the name. The story adds that a message was sent to the
martyr's parents, "who soon after died of grief at his loss." His
age was 33.</p>

<p>This is a romantic story, which will be printed in school-books
and told to every Australian schoolboy before another generation
passes away; and the lives of these men will be quoted as lessons
from which the Australian public spirit of the future may draw
sustenance and vigorous life. Young Australia will learn from such
stories, as well as from its own history when candidly told, why
this continent cannot consent to remain an appanage of a country
which has progressed much and far since these things were done, but
which is kept back in the race of modern development under a dead
weight of unwieldy interests, vested rights, and inherited customs,
by which Australia need only be trammelled as long as her people
please. It is the names of men like Muir and Margarot that will be
taught to schoolboys by-and-bye, and not the names of squalid
gaolers and convict-officers who masquerade in Australian history
as our early officials and governors. Siberia has no more romantic
story than that of Thomas Muir.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/23-page-17.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">Convict and gaoler.</p>

<p>Margarot had other work to do; and the mention of his name
brings our story back to the trading officers of the New South
Wales Corps, and the events which culminated in what is nobly
called the "Deposition of Governor Bligh." Margarot served out the
whole period of his 14 years' sentence in the colony, and it was
two years later before he was allowed to get away. He was present
all through the latter sixteen years of the Corps' career of
wholesale robbery and spoliation, and from his evidence given
before the Committee of the House of Commons on the state of the
colony we are able to draw unexceptionable information as to the
officers' ways and means. Something has already been said about
their usury, their daylight robbery, and their monopoly of trade
and business of every kind, and this will serve to throw light on
what is to follow, We will look at Mr. Margarot's evidence again
later on.</p>

<p>The case of Governor Bligh has been made one of the difficult
points of Australian history. The reason for this is apparent at a
glance. From what has gone before, the unprejudiced reader will be
able to glean a fair idea of the men who exercised early authority
in the colony, and of the officers of the New South Wales Corps in
particular. What he has read will not have prepared him to find
these persons leading a popular movement, and defying the King's
representatives in the name, and on behalf of, a suffering people.
Yet this is the character these men have unblushingly given
themselves. Facts have been distorted, and feeble perverters of
Australian records have been corrupted, either by a pander's bribe
or by native stupidity, to repeat the story the officers and their
friends have shamelessly put forward. The time has come to change
all that, and to show that the claim of "our first families," in
this instance, is based on hypocritical cowardice and false
pretences alone. In clearing up this moot point in the squalid
history of Botany Bay, as in the others elsewhere given, the
present writer has collected facts from all sources, and has put
them together in their proper order. This simple yet novel
arrangement of Australian records puts the case before the reader
in the plainest and most candid way. He can judge for himself.</p>

<p>The conflict between the Corps and the Governors, as we have
seen, did not begin with Bligh. It began with Phillip, and every
Governor after him felt the consequences of any interference with
the nefarious practices of the officers. Governor Hunter, whose
intentions on the whole were much better than his grammar, incurred
their special enmity. Macarthur went home to work up influence
against him at headquarters, and his machinations led to Hunter's
recall. Captain King was commissioned ostensibly to relieve Hunter,
who merely gave up his appointment temporarily. As soon as that
respectable man was "crimped" on board, as it were, it became known
that King's appointment was a permanent one. Hunter went home and
was made a rear-admiral. King was a typical sea-captain, full of
strange oaths, and irascible to a degree. Of course he quarrelled
with the officers. He filled a despatch-box with elaborate reports
of their misconduct. They bribed a London pickpocket to pick the
lock, filch out the documents, and put in old newspapers in their
stead. When the box was opened in London the Duke of Portland
doubtless thought the uncouth sailor-governor had blundered, as it
were, in a passing moment of intoxication.</p>

<p class="b">Page 18</p>

<p>The real nature of the quarrel between the officers and the
Governors came out when King gave certain emancipated convicts the
right to sell rum. This was wounding the officers in the apple of
the eye, so to speak. They protested against this monstrous
interference with their privileges, and Major Johnston, who was
wise in council as we have seen him brave after battle, objected in
these gallant words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do not look upon convicts conditionally emancipated as
amenable to the articles of war, or on a footing with those who are
considered the <i>respectable</i> inhabitants of this colony, nor
do I imagine that I could justify my conduct were I to sanction
such a measure."</p>

<p>This was in 1803, and it expresses the jealousy felt by the
officers in regard to the emancipated convicts, who were beginning
to compete with them in trade. For 40 years afterwards, attempts
were made to keep the line of demarcation rigidly defined.</p>

<p>The officers persecuted King until they drove him out of the
country. Their attacks took the meanest and most unsoldier-like
form. They wrote rude and indecent verses, and dropped them in a
cowardly way about his premises. They circulated clumsy lampoons
from hand to hand, of which the venom was more apparent than the
wit. One bard was inspired to sing thus:</p>

<p class="poem">"For infamous acts from my birth I'd an itch,<br>
My fate I foretold but too true;<br>
Though a rope I deserved, which is justly my due,<br>
I shall actually die in a ditch.<br>
And be damned."</p>

<p>It will be seen that the officers kept an eye on Jack Ketch even
when they burst into song. The verses of these people were as bad
as their moral characters. They secured their point at last in
making King "humbly implore leave of absence to submit his conduct"
for home consideration. He got it, and Bligh took his place.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>Chapter XIII. At the Triangles of
History.</h2>

<p>There were many privileged ruffians in early New South Wales,
but none so richly deserve to be tied up to the triangles of
history and flogged with the "cat" of honest criticism as Captain
John Macarthur. He was one of our first merchants&mdash;such
merchants as the officers of the New South Wales Corps were. He was
the founder of the squatting order&mdash;but his public thefts were
not confined to the public lands. He was the originator of the
wool-growing industry. But John Macarthur was a great deal besides
all that. "<i>De mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>," says someone; but the
last word is an error. It should read "<i>verum</i>" instead.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as he opened up the wool-growing industry he did good
work. But it paid him. There was no mawkish philanthropy about John
Macarthur. He was as rapacious as a jackal, and as emotionless and
cold as an oyster. Therefore his projects prospered well. He grew
wool just as he sold rum&mdash;to make money. He made it. But the
persons who have written Australian history want to make him a hero
and a patriot as well. He was a patriot. But it was of the
Australian brand. And the Australian brand has certain distinctive
features which make it peculiar to Australia. Those who are
ignorant of what these distinctive features are may glean a fair
idea by noting the characteristics of this worthy Captain John
Macarthur. All our patriots have a family resemblance. We will mark
this one with the lash as he hangs by the wrists at the triangles
of history, so that you may know the type when you meet it in
Australian public life, or in these pages again.</p>

<p>Macarthur was about 20 years of age when he came to Botany Bay
as Paymaster and Lieutenant in the Corps, with the first division
that reached the settlement. If there was any doubt as to the
motive that brought his confederates to Australia, there was never
any about what brought him. He came to make money, and he made it.
When the "rum-selling corps" was in action, he was always in the
van. His hand was in everything that was going. The Corps put him
forward as its representative, and he fought for their privilege to
rob and defraud the soldier and the convict, and called his action
a defence of the popular rights. He harassed the successive
Governors, and boasted of having procured the recall of every one
of them up to Macquarie. He helped to chase Phillip out of the
country, and, when Hunter came, he persecuted that unhappy person
so far that he had to appeal to the Home Government against
him.</p>

<p>"I consider this officer's conduct to be an impertinent,
indiscreet, and highly censurable interference with the duties and
department of the Governor," he wrote, when Macarthur went home to
work up a feeling against him there.</p>

<p>When King came he made himself as obnoxious as before, and
scarcely allowed that good sea-captain time to flog his
woman-convicts. This exasperated King very much, and he stated his
views in certain lurid minutes to his superiors, ending with the
words, "Should any further proof be wanting of the turbulent and
restless character of Captain Macarthur, I must require that the
evidence of the late Governors Phillip and Hunter may be
procured."</p>

<p>Whoever opposed the nefarious proceedings of the Corps came in
for his unscrupulous attacks. He had his faction amongst the
settlers, and to those who did not belong to it his name was a
cause of undisguised terror. When Judge-Advocate Atkins was not
intoxicated, he was quarrelling with Macarthur, too, and some
pretty squabbles were the result. They took action for libel
against each other, but dropped them promptly, doubtless for
excellent reasons on both sides. When the magistrate, Dr. Balmain,
refused to play into the hands of the Corps, they persecuted him,
too, and Macarthur was singular for the cunning yet shameless way
in which he slandered the magistrate; who replied, "that he would
maintain to his last breath the character of a gentleman, in
defiance of every unmanly mode of detraction that Mr. Macarthur is
capable of using." When the jackals of the Corps began to quarrel
among themselves over the bones they stole, Macarthur, of course,
was in the thick of the scramble. Captain Abbott, of the Corps,
said something quaint about Governor King, and Lieutenant Marshall,
of the Navy, whose proud soul revolted at this insult to another
naval officer from a squalid captain of this unsavoury body,
pleasantly signified his sentiments by pulling Captain Abbott's
nose. They fought duels on Garden Island in those days; but Captain
Abbott didn't. He thought it safer to bring a civil action. Colonel
Paterson&mdash;a not unworthy officer, though in very bad
company&mdash;could not help sympathising with Marshall. The
irrepressible Macarthur thereupon picked a quarrel with his
officer, and challenged him to a duel. Then the Governor got
disgusted with the whole miserable business, and sent Macarthur
home under arrest. But he soon came back. There was no scope for
talents like his out of a convict colony.</p>

<p>Why did Macarthur come into such frequent conflict with the
Governor and other officials? Simply because he had the largest
stake in the trading operations of the Corps as already described.
He and his accomplices were making fortunes out of the
cruelly-forced convict labour, the open fraud and extortion
practised on the soldiers and settlers, and the control and
monopoly of that criminal traffic in rum which turned the early
settlement into a Pandemonium. It has been said that Macarthur
treated his assigned convicts well. If he did, it was for the
return their prison-labour might produce him. But, fortunately, we
have an explicit record bearing indirectly on this matter, which
fairly states his good intentions for what they were worth.
Macarthur made a public-spirited proposal to Governor Hunter to
relieve him of the care of a number of convicts by taking them to
work for him. He took great credit for his generosity in offering
bread-rate for their labour. Hunter looked up his pocket-grammar,
and fixed the patriot neatly, thus: "The daily wages of a labouring
man, without furnishing food, was at that time 5<i>s</i>. or
something more, and the price of bread was about 2½<i>d</i>. per
lb. Supposing a man to receive two pounds a day, that would amount
to 5<i>d</i>.; for this mighty saving to Government of 5<i>d</i>.,
he would have gained 5<i>s</i>. in labour." So Mr. Macarthur's
benevolence was blighted; and nothing is here apparent to show why
his turn at the triangles of history should be abridged by so much
as a single lash.</p>

<p>It was part of the plan of these officers, and of Macarthur as
their spokesman, to oppose every measure for the amelioration of
the convicts' lot. To secure their own ascendancy they put forward
every effort to crush the emancipated prisoners. When a proposal
was made to establish them on small farms, so that they might have
an opportunity of living honestly by their own labour, he
vehemently opposed the project of giving land to what he called the
"idle, worthless poor," whom he said should be "obliged to employ
themselves in the service of an industrious and vigilant
master"&mdash;assisted by a flogger, doubtless. For the same
reason, respectable settlers with capital coming to the country
were opposed and persecuted. Two such men, named Ellis and Boston,
firmly but in guarded language ventured to protest against the
exclusive monopoly claimed by the officers of all trade and
business.</p>

<p>"This irritated the whole governing despotic power of the
settlement against them," wrote Palmer, one of the Scotch Martyrs;
"they were refused a grant of land and servants, and never
employed."</p>

<p>But Hunter relieved them from their disabilities when he
arrived, and the two men afterwards prospered in business, and
became wealthy. But it is time to cut John Macarthur down, and let
him go howling away until we want him again.</p>

<p class="b">Page 19</p>

<p>Margarot's evidence was given before the Committee of the
Commons in 1812. It describes the state of things that led up to
the Bligh <i>fiasco</i>. In answer to questions, he said, on oath,
that the morals and conduct of convicts were not improved at Botany
Bay, owing to the officers who were sent out there. To their trade,
in which they had engaged "to a man," and personal ignorance alone
he attributed their behaviour, which he described as barbarous and
cruel in the extreme.</p>

<p>"Their trade," he said, "consists first of monopoly, and then of
extortion; it includes all the necessaries of life which are
brought to the colony." The trade is thus described: "When a ship
has arrived, and the goods have been landed in the King's stores,
after a few days the stores are opened to the officers, who go in,
lay their hands on everything of value, and have their names
affixed to it as purchasers, and they leave nothing but the refuse
for the colony; having done so by themselves or by their agents,
they retail that, as I have said before, at 500 per cent, profit."
Other statements make the profit run up to 1500 per cent.</p>

<p>"If you offended one officer," continued Mr. Margarot, "you
offended the whole; and any poor prisoner that had the misfortune
to offend any one officer, would be sure to get a flogging from
some other."</p>

<p>Such was the state of the colony when Governor Bligh arrived. He
came with instructions to put a stop as far as possible to the
traffic in liquor, and to curtail and check the proceedings of the
officers of the New South Wales Corps. It was a perilous mission,
for the officers had had everything their own way for many years,
and their power and interests were by this time consolidated. In
the light of these facts, what comes after will be more readily
understood.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/25-page-19.jpg" alt=

</p>

<p class="caption">"Lieutenant Marshall signified his sentiments by
pulling Captain Abbott's nose.</p>

<p>No one has ever ventured to deny that Bligh was a brave man,
except the gallant officers of the Corps. They were not the best
judges of courage and gallantry, but they said they captured the
Governor under a bed. Bligh's record seems to give this statement
the lie, but not more emphatically than the character of those who
made it. He was famous before he came to the colony. The story of
the mutiny of the Bounty has been often told, and there is little
need to repeat here how his crew rose in insubordination, captured
the vessel, and set Bligh and his officers afloat in an open boat
on the wide Pacific; how he sailed 3500 miles, and was saved, while
the mutineers colonised Pitcairn's Island in their own way.</p>

<p>Bligh had also been involved in the mutiny at the Nore. He had
been twice court-martialled, and censured once for intemperate
language. He sailed with Captain Cook for four years in the
<i>Resolution</i>. He fought under Admirals Howe and Parker. He
fought at Copenhagen under Nelson, and was publicly thanked on the
quarter-deck by the great commander after the engagement. He gave
up the command of a 72-gun ship to come to New South Wales. From
all this it will be seen that he had a high character for bravery
and good service, but also a reputation for hasty temper and high
spirits. This kind of man was not cunning or mean enough to have
any chance in the conflict with the officers of the Corps. They saw
his weak points, and attacked them. They made his two
court-martials and his censure for intemperate language their
opportunity, and they relied on this part of his record as their
justification for the vile conspiracy into which they entered in
the interests of their own selfish rapacity and dishonest trade.
Here, again, Mr. Macarthur comes to the front. An opportunity now
offered for the play of those sinister talents in which he
peculiarly excelled. We must tie him up to the triangles again.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>Chapter XIV. Governor Bligh.</h2>

<p>The moment Bligh landed, Macarthur made an attempt to secure his
influence. He tells the story himself. He says he wanted to
interest the Governor in the sheep and cattle question, on the
ground of the public good of the colony. But Bligh had heard of Mr.
Macarthur, and he saw through the cunning device at a glance. His
high temper found vent, and this was certainly a fair opportunity
for its exercise. He saw that Macarthur's wily <i>pour-parlers</i>
had as much benevolence behind them as his proposal to relieve the
Government stores of the maintenance of a number of convicts by
paying them bread-rate for their labour, and the bluff seaman
naturally revolted at the knavery.</p>

<p>"What have I to do with your sheep, sir?" he bawled at the
disappointed schemer. "What have I to do with your cattle? Are you
to have such flocks of sheep and herds of cattle as no man ever
heard of before? No, sir!"</p>

<p>"I endeavoured," says Macarthur, with innocuous mildness, "to
appease him, saying that I understood the Government at home had
particularly recommended me to his notice. He replied, 'I have
heard of your concerns, sir; you have got 5000 acres of land in the
finest situation in the country, but, by&mdash;&mdash;, you shan't
keep it!'"</p>

<p>This is Macarthur's own version of what took place, yet it shows
how accurately Bligh's rough honesty had seised itself of the
position. But Macarthur <i>did</i> keep the land&mdash;to have and
to hold by him and his heirs forever.</p>

<p class="b">Page 20</p>

<p>Bligh's instructions were to stop the traffic in rum within the
country by every means in his power. They are dated May 25,1805,
under the sign-manual, from St. James', and they enlarge on the
"great evils that have arisen from the unrestrained importation of
spirits." He was enjoined "on pain of our utmost displeasure" to
allow no spirits to land without his consent, and to stop the
exchange of rum for daily necessaries. He arrived in 1806, and
early next year he issued a General Order, threatening 100 lashes
to any convict and three months' imprisonment and a £20 fine to any
settler who bartered rum for food or clothing. Lord Castlereagh
expressly approved of these measures, and conveyed to Bligh the
expression of the royal approbation. Another matter in which Bligh
earned the Minister's thanks was his action in relieving serious
distresses caused in the Hawkesbury district by the floods of 1806.
Provisions reached exorbitant prices, coarse meal and flour being
half-a-crown per pound and the two-pound loaf selling at 5<i>s</i>.
Bligh personally visited the breadless homes, slaughtered the
Government cattle, and divided them among the starving people, and
encouraged them to set to work again by offering fair prices for
the crops they might grow. He saw that the results of the settlers'
labour were minimised by the fact that the officers who ruled the
market charged ruinous rates of exchange for what they had to sell.
He therefore opened the King's Stores at Sydney to the settlers,
and supplied them with what they required, to be paid for in
produce at the following harvest. The settlers began to hope that a
new state of things was about to rule in the colony; but the New
South Wales Corps had to be reckoned with yet.</p>

<p>It soon became apparent to Bligh that the task of reform in the
settlement would be met at every stage by the interests of the
officers. Their rascally trade would be interfered with by every
measure the Governor might take to make the settlers' lot more
easy. Their influence was great, for they had the power of the
Corps at their back. The rank-and-file shared the insolence of
their officers, and Bligh soon found moral and material progress
entirely blocked by this fine body of men. He wrote home in 1807
with a complaint to this effect, and added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"About 70 of the privates were originally convicts, and the
whole are so very much engrafted with that order of persons, as in
many instances have had a very evil tendency, and, it is to be
feared, may hereafter lead to serious consequences, more
particularly from their improper connection with the women."</p>

<p>This is not as lucid as it is true, but then none of the early
Governors were selected for the purity with which they expressed
themselves in their mother-tongue. Bligh went on to say that there
was no remedy "but a change of military duty, a circumstance which
can only prevent a fixed corps becoming a dangerous militia." If
Bligh had been deposed for his feloniously bad English, there is
ample justification here; but the reason was a more practical one
than that.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/26-page-20.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">"This precious document," he said, "came into my
hand as if by the interposition of divine providence."</p>

<p>To prohibit the importation of rum was easy, but the officers
were not so docile as to allow a step like that to interfere with
their dishonest fortunes. It was one thing to shut rum out of the
colony, and quite another thing to keep people from making it
within. The officers imported stills, and the last state of the rum
traffic became worse than the first. Bligh forbade the distillation
of spirits, and when two stills arrived in 1807 in the <i>Dart</i>,
one being for Captain Abbott and one for John Macarthur, the
Governor impounded them in the King's store. But the boilers had
been artfully packed full of medicine, and they were therefore sent
to Macarthur's place. This occurred in March. In October a ship was
going home, and Bligh directed that the stills be put on board and
taken back whence they came. Robert Campbell, who was the naval
officer, made the demand, and Macarthur replied, saying that he had
nothing to do with Abbott's still, and he was going to sell his own
to some ship going to China. The Governor ordered the stills to be
sent to England at once. Macarthur then cavilled about the receipt,
and told the nephew of the harbour master to take the stills at his
own risk. He took proceedings against the officer who effected the
seizure, and complained that a British subject, in a British
settlement, under British laws, had had his property wrested from
him on the Governor's order. He defended the rights of property,
and its privilege to make and to sell rum&mdash;for the boilers
were certainly never intended to serve as mere
medicine-chests&mdash;with a fine indignation and lofty scorn.</p>

<p>In the course of the following month a convict escaped by one of
Macarthur's ships. The owner forfeited a £900 bond. Macarthur
appealed to the Governor, who declined to set aside the Court's
decision. Payment was refused, whereupon the ship was seized, and
the officers soon found out that they had a firmer man to deal with
than King, or Hunter, or Phillip had been. Macarthur sent the crew
on shore, contrary to colonial regulations. The Judge-Advocate
summoned Macarthur to answer in the case, and he declined to obey
the summons. A warrant was issued for his arrest, and the
Parramatta constable, Oakes, was charged with its execution. This
honest man had been sent out as a missionary to the South Seas, but
his spiritual ministrations were not favourably received by the
natives of Tahiti, so they chased him away, and he became the
police-constable at Parramatta; catching souls or bodies was all
one to Mr. Oakes. He presented Macarthur with the warrant "with
many humble apologies;" Macarthur chased him again, telling him if
he came any more to come armed, and that if the person who issued
the warrant had come&mdash;probably meaning his Honour the
Judge-Advocate&mdash;he would have "spurned him from his presence."
Then he spurned the constable just as the Taihitians had spurned
him before, and gave him a little note to. Mr. Atkins saying that
he regarded his warrant with scorn and contempt, as well as the
persons who directed it to be executed. Oakes saw the Governor and
the Judge-Advocate in the town next morning. They spurned him once
more, and sent him back to arrest Macarthur, and lodge him in gaol.
So the chief constable of Sydney and Mr. Oakes, with three other
constables who had not been missionaries, went after Mr. Macarthur
with cutlasses, arrested him at a friend's house in Sydney, and
spurned him into prison.</p>

<p>He was committed for trial next day, but liberated on bail. This
was December 17. On January 25 following, the Criminal Court met,
consisting of the Judge-Advocate and six officers of the Corps. The
officers had laid their plans in the meantime. The Court was
crowded with their men, wearing side-arms. A convict attorney named
Crossley prepared the indictment, as the Judge-Advocate's legal
knowledge did not extend beyond sentencing prisoners. A series of
horrid crimes and misdemeanours were charged against Macarthur. As
soon as the Court was constituted the defendant objected to the
Judge-Advocate on the ground of personal enmity, but that officer
replied that, in the terms of the King's Patent, there could be no
Court without him. Captain Kemp told the Judge he was merely a
common juryman, and the officers compelled him to leave his seat as
president of the Court, while Macarthur addressed those assembled
in a wild and excited manner. He said that Atkins had "associated
and combined with that well-known dismembered limb of the law,
George Crossley," to accomplish his destruction. He added that he
had proof, in the writing of Crossley, that it was determined to
ruin him. "This precious document," he said, "came into my hands as
if by the interposition of Divine Providence; it dropped from the
pocket of Crossley, and was brought to me." Divine Providence in
this instance was probably the same power that extracted the papers
from Governor King's despatch-box&mdash;a clever pickpocket,
namely, of the class whose services the officers had often occasion
to use. The person who picked Crossley's papers up where he so
opportunely dropped them might just as well have picked his pockets
of them at once, though it might not have been so convenient for
Macarthur to say so.</p>

<p class="b">Page 21</p>

<p>So the drunken Judge and the convict attorney and the
turnkey-officers fought amongst themselves, and the reader to-day
may judge, if he can, what there is to choose among them. When
these squalid rascals fall out among themselves, we see what kind
of creatures they really are. When Macarthur finished his harangue,
the Judge-Advocate threatened to commit him, but Captain Kemp
shouted:</p>

<p>"You commit! No, sir, I will commit you to gaol."</p>

<p>The Judge-Advocate then tried to adjourn the Court, and left,
but Captain Kemp insisted that the officers were a Court. Macarthur
claimed the protection of the officers against his enemies. They
gave him a guard, and the Provost-Marshal, Mr. Gore, very properly
treated their action as a rescue, and obtained a warrant for his
arrest. The officers wrote to the Governor demanding that Atkins
should be replaced by another judge, to which Bligh replied that it
was out of his power to supersede the King's Commission. The
officers repeated their request, and Bligh asked for the papers.
They refused to supply them. Then the Governor wrote to Major
Johnstone, asking his attendance under particular public
circumstances. He replied, and said that he was "too ill to come,"
and was unable to write. The next morning, January 26, the Provost
arrested Macarthur again, and the Judge-Advocate formally accused
the officers to the Governor, of "crimes amounting to usurpation,"
and tending to incite rebellion and treason in the territory. Bligh
summoned the officers to appear before him next day, and again
summoned Major Johnstone, and again received a reply saying that
the Major was still "so ill as to be unable to write." But he was
not too ill to drive the same afternoon into Sydney to his
barracks, where the officers met him, and persuaded him to usurp
the government of the colony. The New South Wales Corps formed,
and, with drums beating and colours flying, marched upon Government
House.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>Chapter XV. The Deposition of
Bligh.</h2>

<p>But the troops did not march until John Macarthur again came on
the scene. Though Major Johnstone was too ill to write to the
Governor, he wrote an order to the gaoler at Sydney, bidding him to
deliver up the body of that troublesome individual, and to "fail
not, as you will answer the same at your peril!" When the gaoler
received that hint he released Mr. Macarthur, who joined the
officers in time to receive the Major when he came to town. Nothing
could be done without John Macarthur. He drew up a requisition to
Johnstone, in which he said that "the present alarming state of
this colony"&mdash;meaning, doubtless, of Mr. John
Macarthur&mdash;"induces us most earnestly to implore you instantly
to place Governor Bligh under arrest, and to assume the control of
the colony." The hollowness of this artifice will be apparent when
it is remembered that Macarthur was released from prison by
Johnstone so that this impudent lie might be concocted in time.
That the officers fully understood the lawlessness of their action
is evident from the words that followed:</p>

<p>"We pledge ourselves, at a moment of less agitation, to come
forward to support the measure with our fortunes and our
lives."</p>

<p>It is quite needless to add, as we shall presently see, that
they never did anything of the kind.</p>

<p>Then the Major wrote to Bligh and lightly told him he was called
upon to execute a most painful duty.</p>

<p>"You are charged," he said, "by the respectable inhabitants with
crimes that render you unfit to exercise the supreme authority
another moment in the colony;" and went on to add, "I therefore
require you, in his Majesty's sacred name, to resign your
authority, and to submit to be arrested, which I hereby place you
under by the advice of all my officers, and by the advice of every
respectable inhabitant of the town of Sydney."</p>

<p>The tone and style of this precious document are so much like
those of the letters of Mr. Macarthur, that the suspicion of his
having drafted it at once suggests itself; few men in the colony at
that time had such a facile gift of lying as he possessed. We have
progressed since, however.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/27-page-21.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">"Rum had evidently been served out to the men,
as many of the soldiers were drunk."</p>

<p>It was about 9 o'clock in the evening when the soldiers marched
up to the cottage in Bligh-street which served as Government House.
Guards had been placed on the road to Parramatta and elsewhere, and
no one was allowed to pass. Rum had evidently been served out to
the men, as many of the soldiers were drunk.</p>

<p>"Three hundred men under martial law, loaded with ball," as
Bligh characteristically expresses it, formed the party; and on
arriving at Government House these braves, flushed with patriotism
and rum, were met at the gate by the Governor's daughter, who tried
to arrest their career of glory with her parasol. The Corps rallied
gallantly to the charge, however, and, after a spirited attack the
storming party succeeded in effecting an entrance. Lieutenant Bell
was on duty as guard, and when he saw his accomplices approaching
he ordered his men to prime and load, and then joined the marauding
gang. He was afterwards a nominee member of the Legislative Council
of the colony.</p>

<p>Bligh had a number of the magistrates of the colony at dinner
when this irruption of rum-flushed ruffianism took place and
interrupted the proceedings. The formal notice, signed by Major
Johnstone, was merely a blind, intended to give his action an
appearance of fair seeming in the event of future enquiries being
made. The only intimation Bligh received was the approach of the
Corps, as he wrote, "with colours spread, and playing the 'British
Grenadiers.'" Bligh thus describes what happened next:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had just time to call to my orderly-sergeant to have my
horses ready, while I went upstairs to put on my uniform, the
family being then in deep mourning; when, on my return, as I was
standing on the staircase waiting for my servant with my sword, I
saw a number of soldiers rushing upstairs with their muskets and
fixed bayonets, as I conceived to seize my person. I retired
instantly into a back room, to defeat their object, and to
deliberate on the means to be adopted for the restoration of my
authority, which, in such a critical situation, could only be
accomplished by my getting into the interior of the country
adjacent to the Hawkesbury, where I knew the whole body of the
people would flock to my standard. To this situation I was pursued
by the soldiers, and, after experiencing much insult, was conducted
below by Lieutenant Minchin, who told me that Major Johnstone was
waiting for me."</p>

<p>Johnstone repeated to Bligh what his letter has already told us,
and placed him under arrest. Then the house was ransacked, and the
Governor's commission, instructions, and other papers and reports
seized, and a guard was set round the house to prevent Bligh's
escape. This is his own account; the officers maintained that he
was found concealed under a bed, from which he was extracted at the
point of a soldier's bayonet. There is nothing inherently
incredible about this version, but, coming from the source it does,
the statement is probably a lie. The civil magistrates were at once
placed under arrest.</p>

<p class="b">Page 22</p>

<p>Then a reign of terror set in. If any doubt existed as to the
character of the officers of the New South Wales Corps and their
leading spirit, Mr. John Macarthur, as well as of the real nature
of the revolution they effected, the events that now followed
rapidly dispelled it. The officers had everything their own way,
with no responsibility for their actions, and under these
favourable circumstances they soon showed the kind of material they
were made of. On the day following Bligh's deposition Major
Johnstone dismissed the magistrates from their offices, and took
proceedings against the other opponents of his rule. The attorney
Crossley, who prepared the indictment against Macarthur, was sent
to the coal-mines at Newcastle for seven years. The officers of the
Corps were appointed to the vacant magistracies, and Judge-Advocate
Atkins was dismissed in favour of Captain Abbott, the same officer
whose nose was pulled for his insolence by Lieutenant Marshall. It
is probable that Atkins would have been sent to the coal-mines with
Crossley, but the officers presently found that he might be useful
to them; so they showed him a document found among Bligh's stolen
papers, which we have already quoted from, charging him with
drunkenness and incapacity. When Mr. Atkins read this little paper
he at once threw in his lot with the officers, and was again
appointed Judge-Advocate by those congenial spirits. As the holder
of the King's Commission the officers knew that his acts would have
a certain legality which theirs wanted, so they were content to
bury the past, and possibly to persuade Mr. Macarthur to refrain
from spurning the Judge-Advocate now that he had the
opportunity.</p>

<p>The Commissary, Palmer, was also dismissed, as also was Robert
Campbell, the naval officer with whom Macarthur had quarrelled.
Macarthur was tried again before the new Judge-Advocate, promptly
acquitted, and chaired through the streets of the town by the
soldiers, who throughout these proceedings enjoyed themselves very
much indeed.</p>

<p>It would be ridiculous to expect that the officers of the New
South Wales Corps progressed so far without invoking Providence.
Their rascality was of too finished a character for that. One of
Johnstone's&mdash;or Macarthur's&mdash;first steps was to suspend
the chaplain, but the interests of religion were not to be allowed
to suffer by such a step as that. A person named Crook, whom Holt
described as a barn-ranter whom nobody would listen to, was
appointed to preach, but the duties of ordinary were discharged by
no less a person than the vivacious Mr. John Macarthur. This man's
sense of humour was of such subtle fineness as almost to elude the
eye. He introduced a prayer into the Liturgy for Major Johnstone,
styling him Lieutenant-Governor, and issued a proclamation calling
on "every well-disposed inhabitant" to join in thanks for the
merciful interposition of Providence in their favour by "relieving
them without bloodshed from the awful situation in which they stood
before the memorable 26th inst." But the finishing touch to this
revolting hypocrisy and squalid caricature of the ordinances of
religion was put by the appointment of Captain Kemp&mdash;whom we
have seen forcing his men to submit to be robbed by him under
threat of the lash&mdash;to celebrate marriages in the town of
Sydney! Then Mr. Macarthur was made a magistrate and Colonial
Secretary, and, to quote Dr. Lang, "the military and grog-sellers
of Sydney were quite vociferous in praise of the new <i>régime</i>;
celebrating the accession of Major Johnstone with bonfires,
laudatory addresses, and the other customary manifestations of
joy." In the eyes of this portion of the community a great moral
revolution had been consummated, and the right of those concerned
to make and sell rum amply vindicated.</p>

<p>Bligh was confined in a subaltern's quarters in the barracks for
twelve months. All his regulations respecting the King's stores and
the settlers' supplies were abrogated, and matters brought back as
far as possible into the condition which existed before the power
of the Corps began to decline. Rum was supplied freely to the
friends of the new Government, with assignments of convict-labour
and grants of land. To secure the goodwill even of the convicts
certain free pardons were made out and given away. All public
meetings were prohibited, except for the purpose of addressing the
new rulers. Dr. Lang gives an instance of the weekly meetings of
Presbyterians being stopped by Lieutenant Ball, in pursuance of
this order. Persons were asked to sign the requisition under which
Johnstone assumed the Government, and although only "six or seven
names had been affixed to the paper when the troops marched from
the Barracks," about 100 were afterwards found on it. Of these,
many signed through timidity or fear. Mr. Arndell, a magistrate,
who signed an address to Major Johnstone, addressed a private
letter to Bligh at once saying that he had done so under the
influence of fear.</p>

<p>But the climax was reached by Major Johnstone's</p>

<p class="newspaper">"PROCLAMATION:<br>
<br>
"The public peace being happily and, I trust in Almighty God,
permanently established, I hereby proclaim the cessation of martial
law. I have this day appointed magistrates and other public
functionaries from amongst the most respectable officers and
inhabitants.<br>
<br>
"In future no man shall have just cause to complain of violence,
injustice, or oppression; no free man shall be taken, imprisoned,
or deprived of his house, land, or liberty but by law. Justice
shall be impartially administered, without regard to or respect of
persons, and every man shall enjoy the fruits of his industry in
security."</p>

<p>The first steps after this noble declaration were to arrest the
settler Suttor and the ex-Provost-Marshal Gore. The former
protested against the illegality of the action of the Corps, and
the other had Macarthur for an enemy. Suttor was imprisoned for six
months in the condemned cell in Sydney, and Gore for eleven weeks
and four days, after which he was sent to hard labour in the
coal-mines of Newcastle for four months. This latter part of the
sentence was added, possibly, to give the hapless Provost some idea
of what a "just cause to complain of violence, injustice, or
oppression" might happen to be. There was an addendum to this
proclamation&mdash;all through which Macarthur's hand is plainly
traceable&mdash;which was addressed to the rank-and-file of the
Corps, in recognition of the bravery and high spirit shown by those
gallant men throughout the trying time. It was couched in the
heroic terms which some of the generals of history have affected in
addressing their victorious troops after a decisive
engagement:&mdash;</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Soldiers!&mdash;Your conduct has endeared you
to every well-disposed inhabitant in this settlement. Persevere in
the same honourable path, and you will establish the credit of the
New South Wales Corps on a basis not to be shaken.<br>
<br>
"GOD SAVE THE KING!"</p>

<p>There is a rough, blistering irony about this, the force of
which further words would only weaken.</p>

<p>One of the first steps taken by Johnstone was to communicate
with his commanding officer, Colonel Paterson, then in Van Diemen's
Land. He informed him of what had been done, and invited him to
come and assume the supreme authority. But that astute officer too
well knew the kind of warriors he commanded, and what they were
capable of, to put his head in a noose like that. He had quite
enough wisdom of the serpent to keep him out of harm's way; so he
sent back a reply, informing Major Johnstone's party that, as they
had begun a revolution, they might finish it amongst themselves. So
Johnstone continued to hold office until the arrival of Colonel
Foveaux, who returned from England, whither he had been to attend
an enquiry into his action as gaoler of Norfolk Island. Still
later, Paterson came over from Van Diemen's Land when he thought
that step could be taken with perfect safety, and superseded
Foveaux. During the term of the officers' rule more land grants
were given away than under any previous ruler, and the officers
were careful to make hay while the sun of their prosperity shone.
The settlers and the general population fell back into the misery
from which Bligh had but temporarily rescued them. And this was the
Revolution of 1808.</p>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>Chapter XVI. An Australian
Patriot.</h2>

<p>Anyone with the slightest experience in the sifting of evidence
or the examination of historical records will see at a glance the
value of the claims put forward by John Macarthur and his party.
The unparalleled impudence of the attempt which has been made to
exalt them to the pedestals of patriots would only be possible in a
country where the term itself is one of ridicule and derision. The
Australian patriot has the great advantage over those of other
lands in that he has known how to make the trade pay. Patriotism
has been defined elsewhere as the last refuge of a scoundrel; in
Australia it has always been the first trick of the
huckster&mdash;political or otherwise. The term has such unsavoury
associations that it stinks in the nostrils of Australians.</p>

<p class="b">Page 23</p>

<p>It requires courage to deal vigorously with these first chapters
of our history, and particularly with the character of such a man
as this John Macarthur. Long before his death his
wealth&mdash;acquired as we know&mdash;gave him a commanding
influence in the growing colony, as we shall see as we go on. His
influence was used, up to the last, against the people of this
country, and some of the worst and most despicable passages in that
part of our story that is to follow will be found connected with
his name, as were those that have been already told. That such a
man and his accomplices should have continued to occupy their false
position so long is a serious charge against writers of Australian
history, as well as the popular spirit of enquiry which has allowed
these drivellers to mislead it. Miserable attempts have been made
in the face of facts to gloss over and conceal Macarthur's
delinquencies because he introduced the practice of wool-growing;
in view of which, says one of his apologists, "the faults of the
man have been almost forgotten in the patriotism of the citizen."
The "patriotism of the citizen" consisted in his laying the
foundations of his own private fortunes. Australia has had many
patriots like that!</p>

<p>"The genius of New South Wales," Bonwick writes, "as if in
imitation of the pitying tear of the recording angel, has blurred
the page that told of John Macarthur's errors, while lighting up by
her smiles the letters which blazoned forth his glorious deeds in
the path of peaceful progress."</p>

<p>This hopeless cant is a fair sample of the saponaceous idiocy on
which the public sentiment of the Australian people has been
hitherto fed. Such is the dismal drivel that marks our record from
the beginning, and stamps it with its own fatuous character, which
it will continue to retain until the Australian voter and taxpayer
is able to think for himself. It is for this reason that the writer
who would set the facts of our history in their proper place and
order must cull them laboriously from manifold sources, taking
facts alone, and leaving behind him the wilderness of dreary
platitude and veneered venality in which they have been hitherto
embedded and concealed.</p>

<p>The facts of the Bligh case, candidly told, are a sufficient
condemnation of the officers. They sold goods, having dishonestly
obtained by fraud and force the command of the market, at a
usurious profit running up to 1500 per cent.; they robbed the poor
settler of the produce of his labour for a tithe of its value, and
they demoralised the settlement with licentiousness and rum. Bligh,
as we have seen, had express instructions to stop some of those
iniquities, and his honest efforts in that direction aroused the
trading officers' enmity. They put in force against him the same
vile tactics&mdash;more appropriate to a gang of thieves and
pickpockets, which they were, than to British officers and
gentlemen, which they certainly were not&mdash;that had driven
Phillip, Hunter, and King out of the colony, and for many years
ruined its chance of progress. When they found that Bligh was a
stronger man than any of his predecessors, and shrewd enough to
recognise the moving spirit of all their rascality and put him in
gaol, then the officers and their worthy followers deposed the
Governor "in the public interest." The facts of the deposition
itself are damnatory. Johnstone was too ill to write to tho
Governor, but not so ill as to be unable to write to the gaoler at
Sydney, ordering him to deliver Macarthur at his peril&mdash;thus
compelling the performance of an illegal action under a direct
threat, which the gaoler knew only too well how to appreciate.
Johnstone was too ill to attend Bligh's summons, but not too ill to
come into town the same afternoon and depose him. He charged Bligh
with crimes that rendered him unfit to exercise the supreme
authority another moment in the colony; but he forebore to say what
these crimes were. From first to last, as was clearly proven at the
court-martial later on, this man was a mere instrument in the hands
of Macarthur, who instigated Johnstone to his squalid rebellion for
his own miserable purposes. He found he had gone too far with
Bligh, and, being afraid to take his trial, he moved his
weak-minded superior officer to rebel against the Governor so that
he himself might get out of trouble and out of gaol.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/29-page-23.jpg" alt=

<p class="caption">A sailor turnkey.</p>

<p>The action of Colonel Paterson, who certainly knew the state of
affairs in the colony well, and understood the character of his
officers and men, has a significance of its own. That officer
refused, point blank, to have any act or part in the "rebellion,"
when he heard of what had been done. Yet it is impossible to
believe that he would have held aloof had the circumstances been,
as Macarthur and Johnstone described them, such as to warrant
recourse to the extreme measures taken by the Corps. The fantastic
tricks played before high heaven by the persons who officiated as
ordinary chaplain, and the solemniser of marriages would, perhaps,
make the angels weep were they not better employed. Most of these
people, we are told, kept regular harems of convict women, and very
few indeed held aloof from these shameless excesses, which like
everything else connected with these men were squalid and
revolting, without one redeeming point or feature of extenuation.
It is but fair to add that Macarthur was one of those of whom least
has been said in this particular connection.</p>

<p>The prosecution of Gore and Crossley was a piece of revengeful
vindictiveness for which there can be no palliation. Because
Crossley assisted to draw up the indictment against Macarthur, and
Gore took him from the hands of the soldiers who had forcibly
rescued him, both were sent to the coal-mines of Newcastle by the
malice of the canting ordinary, who had the audacity to insert
special prayers in the Church Service for the instrument of his
mean revenges. The case of Suttor was still worse. He was an
industrious settler at Baulkham Hills, and no sympathiser with the
aims and schemes of the officers. He and several others addressed a
memorial to the Home Government disclaiming any part in their
actions, and for this he was deprived of his assigned servants and
locked up for six months in a condemned cell. Every extreme of
malice seems to have been put forward by the officers while their
power lasted to intimidate those who were disaffected to their
illegal rule, and to revenge themselves on all who had sought to
strengthen the hands of Bligh in his short-lived but well-meant
efforts to remedy some of the miseries of the unhappy
settlement.</p>

<p class="b">Page 24</p>

<p>Bligh remained under strict surveillance until March, 1809, when
he was allowed to take command of H.M.S. <i>Porpoise</i> on
condition that he returned to England at once. He accepted the
condition, but he appears to have thought little of a promise
obtained under such circumstances, and by such people, for he
sailed to Van Diemen's Land. There is a story that when Bligh felt
the timbers of his ship once more under his feet, he threw off all
disguise and ordered Lieutenant King to open fire and "batter down
the town of Sydney," as well as to turn his guns against the
<i>Admiral Gambler</i>, then lying in the harbour, in which
Macarthur and Johnstone had taken passage for England to forestall
him in the enquiry they anticipated. At Van Diemen's Land Bligh was
well received at first, until letters came from Sydney, when an
attempt was made to arrest him. He escaped, and lay off the coast
till the end of the year until Macquarie arrived to succeed him as
Governor on 28th December. Macquarie had orders to reinstate Bligh
for 24 hours had he been present in Sydney on his arrival; when he
did come soon after he was received with the honours due to a
Commodore. By the new Governor Bligh received despatches from Lord
Castlereagh informing him that "the mutinous outrage committed upon
him had caused the strongest sensation, and that his Majesty had
ordered Major Johnstone to be sent home in strict arrest, to be
brought to trial for his conduct." He was empowered to bring home
with him any witnesses whose services he should require "to
substantiate the charge, of that officer's mutinous proceedings."
Bligh arrived in Sydney in January, 1810, and left on the following
May. By October, when he arrived in England, there had been a
change of Ministry, and in the meantime his enemies had been
beforehand with him in blackening his character and prejudicing his
case in the public estimation. It was not until May, 1811, that the
Court-Martial was held, by which time the matter had become an
old-world story, and the new Ministry had lost any small interest
its members had ever taken in such a far-away matter.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>Chapter XVII. The Corps Drummed
Out.</h2>

<p>"On the 4th of January, 1810," says Holt in his memoirs, "three
ships hove in sight of Sydney&mdash;the <i>Dromedary</i>, the
<i>Indostan</i>, and a storeship&mdash;which came up to the Cove
with every preparation to give a broadside if they saw occasion."
This meant that Governor Macquarie had arrived, with a detachment
of the 73rd Regiment. The new Governor expected that he and his
battalion would have to fight their way, and put down the
insurrection by force; but this was merely an idle fancy of
Major-General Lachlan Macquarie's innocent mind. The men he had to
deal with were not given to fighting. They knew how to skulk out of
their difficulty by a much easier process than that.</p>

<p>On the morning of the sixth, the troops began to disembark, and
the New South Wales Corps was promptly on hand, in a burst of
effusive loyalty, to salute the King's representative. The new
comers marched on to the parade ground, and there the new
Judge-Advocate, Ellis Bent, read the commission of Macquarie and
his lieutenant, Richard Charles O'Connell, in the presence of all
the soldiers and inhabitants. The 73rd then marched out of the
town, and pitched their tents a mile and a-half away from the
barracks, placing pickets, and taking all the precautions usual to
a brigade on active service in the field. All this was viewed with
the greatest perturbation by those who had been active in the
rebellion. Macarthur and Johnstone had taken every care to get away
out of danger long before, and were by this time in England
slandering Bligh.</p>

<p>But the officers and men of the Corps saw at once that their day
was over. They waited anxiously for Macquarie to break his ominous
silence, and put them out of their misery and doubt. When it became
known that the Corps was ordered home, the first sensation was one
of profound relief. This was succeeded by the reflection that all
their merry days at Botany Bay, with its petty tyrannies and its
privileged ruffianism and its rum, were over, and that return to
England meant going back to the old life once more. "The old
soldiers, with their wives and children, were full of lamentations
that evening; for they saw that they must quit New South Wales, and
they knew that it was a very different thing living there and
living in England." However, Macquarie allowed some few of the old
soldiers to enlist in the 73rd. The rest were packed off in the
first ships. It will be remembered that the Corps was originally
recruited from the prisons and the hulks, and, as Hunter wrote, by
enlisting "characters who had been disgraceful to every other
regiment in his Majesty's service." Men who had been condemned to
service in India were reprieved, as we before mentioned, to enlist
in the New South Wales Corps. Their career at Botany Bay did not
improve them, apparently, for very soon after their return to
England they found their native level. They were constituted a
"condemned regiment" themselves, drummed out of the country, and
sent to spend the rest of their existence where the hopeless
outcasts of the military service were sent&mdash;to India. They
were good enough to conduct a philanthropic experiment and found a
new British colony, but they were not good enough to remain a
regiment in the regular service at home.</p>

<p>And so the New South Wales Corps rattles its drums in the town
of Sydney for the last time, and drops finally out of our story. In
the whole range of human history it would be hard to select even
one solitary passage that, for dismal misery, cruelty, and squalor,
could even distantly compare with what has been here touched with a
very hesitating pen. To draw the curtain entirely aside from the
squalid abominations of these first years of our story would be to
disclose a picture of horror that is simply revolting and nothing
more. Enough has been said for the purpose of the present writer,
and more than enough to show what the beginnings of the colony
really were. The subject is not an attractive one. Not one word
would have been said to revive this squalid and debasing memory
were it not that the shameful brand of this "rum-selling Corps"
still reddens and burns in the flesh of Young Australia.</p>

<p>With the exit of the "rum-selling Corps" a new volume in the
history of Botany Bay may be said to open. But it is sad to have to
add that enough of the old leaves remained to make the new book, in
many respects, a copy of the old. Had the Corps continued its rule,
it is quite impossible to imagine what the colony would have
eventually become. But when it was drafted home its officers, the
responsible agents of all the rascality, resigned almost in a body
and remained behind. This was their way out of the difficulties
that surrounded them. They had made large fortunes, and founded
large interests during the hey-day of their power. So they deserted
their followers, whom they had first robbed and then led into
danger; turned their backs on the King's colours, and settled down
in the colony to continue their old practices as far as they might
be allowed, to become nominee legislators eventually, and the
founders of our "first families." The strong rule of the military
Governors who, beginning with Macquarie, superseded the old naval
Governors, did not allow of the same excesses as the first 20 years
of our history presented. But the wealth and influence of these
black leg officers, who deserted their followers after leading them
into danger, made them powerful enough to recover from the shock
and perpetuate the spirit they introduced, even down to our own
days.</p>

<p>"All the oppressors were smashed together," says Holt, "and it
was amusing to hear them abusing each other and cursing the
Governor." And in another place we get this:&mdash;"Anthony Fenn
Kemp lost his commission as Judge-Advocate, and from being a
magistrate and a great officer in the colony, became nothing more
than a captain in the 102nd Regiment," by which name the Corps was
henceforth known. "And worse than this," goes on Holt, "his rotten
tobacco would no longer pay the soldiers, so that misfortunes came
upon him in various shapes." One of the first acts of Macquarie was
to lower the price of provisions from the false standard to which
the officers had raised it, and to have food sold in the open
market instead of in the hole-in-corner manner they had forced on
the settlement.</p>

<p>"This was of great service to the poor," we are told, "and
injured no one but those who could bear it, and had too long
enjoyed an unfair profit. Comfort and happiness now began to appear
in the countenances of all the inhabitants of the colony. John
Macarthur lost his villainous trade, but it had lasted long enough
to enable him to make a large fortune." But, then, as we have
before had occasion to notice, John Macarthur was not a man likely
to waste either his substance or his sympathy on what he called the
"idle, worthless poor."</p>

<p class="b">Page 25</p>

<p>Another of Macquarie's earliest steps was to declare null and
void all the acts of the officers' Government during the time of
their rule. Their grants of land and free pardons were revoked as
illegal, and the documents conveying such grants or pardons were
called in. But Macquarie was a man of marked tact, and it was his
primary object to see justice done, as far as possible, so that
none might suffer through the fault of others. Having vindicated
his authority, therefore, by this act, he afterwards confirmed
most, if not all, of these grants and pardons. He had instructions
to use his discretion, in view of the two years that had elapsed
since the rebellion, so that its traces might be effaced with the
least possible friction. This was fortunate for the individuals,
but for the colony and its future it was simply the worst thing
that could possibly have happened. Had strong and drastic measures
been adopted firmly and at once, and the wretches who had wrought
such misery on the colony been swept away root and branch, and
every trace of their squalid presence scattered to the winds, it
would have been incalculably better for the Australia of to-day.
Macquarie showed to these ruffians a measure of mercy they had
never been known to show to others. We shall see, presently, how
they repaid him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it cannot be overlooked that a very great reform had
been effected in the condition and prospects of the settlement by
the very first steps Macquarie took. The departure of the Corps was
an omen of good. The drunken Judge-Advocate who indirectly caused
the rebellion, and then took service under the officers who opposed
him, was drummed out of Botany Bay with them, and another
Judge-Advocate, who was not drunken, appointed in his place. A
chaplain was also brought out by Macquarie, and the officer who
solemnised marriages for the settlement found his occupation gone.
A good many of the harems were broken up, for Macquarie brought his
wife with him, and her presence kept the moral atmosphere in the
neighbourhood of Government House and the official centres
comparatively clean and pure. But it was many years yet before the
"factory" at Parramatta discontinued to supply wives to the
settlers on approval, to be returned and replaced if found
unsuitable.</p>

<p>It was during the second year of Macquarie's government that the
court-martial on Colonel Johnstone took place. It was held at the
Royal Hospital, Chelsea, and lasted thirteen days, resulting in
Colonel Johnstone being found guilty of the act of mutiny, and
cashiered. It was added, in a general order of the
Commander-in-chief, "that the Court, in passing a sentence so
inadequate to the enormity of the crime of which the prisoner has
been found guilty, have apparently been actuated by a consideration
of the novel and extraordinary circumstances" surrounding the
condition of the colony. The Prince Regent, in admitting the
principle under which the Court had allowed this consideration to
act in mitigation of the punishment which the act of mutiny would
otherwise have suggested," said that "no circumstances could be
received in full extenuation of an assumption of power, so
subversive of every principle of good order and discipline, as that
under which Lieutenant-Colonel Johnstone had been convicted." An
enquiry into Macarthur's share in the proceedings resulted in his
being prohibited for eight years from returning to the colony. He
employed part of the interval in a pleasant tour on the continent.
Many hundreds of poor wretches had been sent to Botany Bay for life
for much less villainies than his.</p>

<p>Bligh was immediately appointed to the rank of Rear-Admiral in
the Navy, and employed on active service. While the case was in
progress Johnstone made capital of the fact that Bligh had been
involved in such enquiries before, while to himself the position of
prosecutor or defendant was new and painful. There was some truth
in this; for Johnstone, as we have already seen, was in the habit
of shooting and hanging prisoners without wasting time in
prosecuting them. But Bligh manfully met the charge with a
sailor-like and simple account of his career, which compelled the
respect of his hearers and put the calumnies of the defence to the
rout. He referred to the charge of cowardice; he said he knew that
Mr. Macarthur wrote the despatch, in which the circumstance of his
having been found by the soldiers in hiding under a bed was
mentioned with vulgar triumph. But he could not anticipate, he
said, that Colonel Johnstone's address to the Court would be
written in the same spirit, and that, after being the victim of Mr.
Macarthur's intrigues, he would allow himself to be made the tool
of his revenge. Then he explained that just before his arrest he
called for his uniform, which was not a dress adapted for
concealment, and then, selecting his papers, he was tearing some to
pieces and concealing the remainder when he was discovered stooping
over some documents on the floor by the soldiers on the other side
of the bed Macarthur's tactics pursued him to the last. Before the
sentence was made known a false account of the trial was published
in the British Express, containing severe reflections on Governor
Bligh. A copy of this, wet from the printing-office, was posted
anonymously to Bligh; and, says Lang, "on the inside of the
envelope there was sketched the figure of a pistol, intimating,
doubtless, that the old admiral had now nothing better to do than
to use that instrument effectually, and be off!" The sender of this
was never known. But if the reader will compare it with the
anonymous attacks on Governor King, and with a certain
surreptitious document issued by Macarthur later on, he will see
unmistakable traces in all three of the one unscrupulous hand.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch18" id="ch18"></a>Chapter XVIII. The Pure
Merinos.</h2>

<p>We said that when the New South Wales Corps was drummed out of
the colony the officers were left there in possession of their
ill-gotten wealth. Though their official positions were taken from
them, by this time the officers had no need of any accidental aids
to make their power felt. They were now the property-owners and
land-holders of the colony, the holders of vested interests, as
they did not hesitate unblushingly to assert, and to all intents
and purposes the local aristocracy. It became their object to
preserve these vested interests, and to draw a wide and deep line
of demarcation not only between themselves and the emancipated
members of the convict class, but the less wealthy section of free
settlers as well. The yeoman Suttor was an example of the latter.
He had come to the colony with the intention of making a home for
himself by his own honest efforts. He was an honest man. The type
was rare in the colony before Macquarie's time, and we have already
seen that the temporary rulers expressed their enthusiastic sense
of the honesty of this man by promptly putting him in prison.</p>

<p>When Macquarie began to govern, therefore, the persons who, as
officers of the military force in the settlement, had opposed all
the best intentions of Phillip, Hunter, King, and Bligh, now in
their capacity as property owners and the representatives of vested
interests, opposed every act of the present Governor that aimed at
the welfare of the population. This fact in our history is an
important one, and is worthy of special notice, for this is the
first of the connecting links between the rule of the Corps, and
the survival of Botany Bay traditions in Australia to-day. Having
shown how these vested interests grew up, and the character of the
people who formed them, it is necessary to show the steps by which,
with a slight change of front, the malign influences that directed
the first stage of colonisation continued to exercise their
miserable sway and produce the same fell results.</p>

<p>The emancipation of convicts had begun with Phillip, and was
continued by his successors. Many of the convicts, as already
shown, were not criminals at all in the real sense of the word. As
they were emancipated, or acquired their freedom by serving out the
terms of their sentences, many of the convicts who escaped the
contamination of the Corps and the rapacity of the officers began
to engage in trade&mdash;some being so employed by the officers
themselves. The result was that many of these made some money of
their own, extended their operations, and began to compete with the
officers in the trade of the settlement. But this would never do.
This was revolutionary, and an interference with the social rights
and vested interests of their quondam gaolers. The crime was made
the more heinous by the fact that the emancipist traders actually
sold goods at a lower price than the officers. Their virtuous
indignation was aroused. These choice spirits said that it was not
fitting that the ex-convict should set up a huxter's shop or a
drinking-den beside that of his ex-gaoler, and even undersell him
in the articles of fustian jackets and rum. So they formed a strong
and closely-knit party among themselves, called themselves the old
colonial aristocracy of New South Wales, and forthwith these
squalid hypocrites proceeded to inveigh against granting to the
emancipist the same civil rights as they enjoyed. From this point
down to the granting of Responsible Government the same spirit
actuated the same class, with certain modifications, and formed for
many weary years an impassable obstacle to the progress of the
people and the introduction of free institutions.</p>

<p class="caption">Macquarie's demoniac architect.</p>

<p>The vested interest class became known as the "Pure Merinos," as
they were understood to bear the same relation to the rest of the
population as the sheep of that breed did to those from the Cape.
The freed convicts were known as "Emancipists." But though, in the
then undeveloped condition of free settlement, the antagonism was
at first between the "Pure Merinos" and the "Emancipists," it soon
became a conflict between the former class and the whole population
of the colony, whether emancipist or originally free. Macquarie's
instructions directed him to carry out that part of the design of
the first experimentalists in transportation, which aimed at making
Botany Bay a place of reformation, as well as of punishment. The
original plan, so far as there was any plan at all, proposed to
give the convict facilities for earning an honest living as soon as
his term of sentence had expired. But, of course, the dilettante
philanthropists who conceived the scheme never foresaw the
complications the New South Wales Corps was destined to introduce.
To attempt to unravel these, after they had been formed, was the
task of the new Governor.</p>

<p>Lachlan Macquarie was an honest British officer of the old
school, to whom it would have been as impossible to engage in a
squalid traffic in rum while bearing the King's commission as it
would have been to mutiny against his superior officer. He saw the
kind of men he had to deal with at a glance, as Bligh had done, but
he had considerably more power than his predecessor. He saw that
between the Emancipist class, on the one side, and its black sheep
with the marks of the leg-irons still on their limbs, and the Pure
Merinos, with their claims to consideration on the score of wealth
and what they called social position, there was really very little
to choose. It did not take him long to say so, either. "There are
only two classes of persons in New South Wales," he told the
Secretary of State, "those who have been convicted, and those who
ought to have been." There was a military directness about this
crisp statement of fact that offended the Pure Merinos very much
indeed. Their susceptibilities were frequently wounded in this way.
It was in a similar cordially appreciative spirit that the naval
lieutenant in King's time pleasantly pulled Captain Abbott's nose.
It must be confessed that, in the face of such discouraging little
passages as these, the struggle of the Pure Merinos to raise
themselves in the social scale was a sufficiently pathetic one.</p>

<p>One of Macquarie's first steps after the general state of the
colony had been dealt with was one that showed how honest his
intentions really were. For the second time the poorer settlers
were to see their Governor really taking an active personal
interest in their welfare. In 1809, just before his arrival, a
heavy flood had again devastated the Hawkesbury district, and the
settlers and small farmers there were reduced to the direst straits
for want of food. Macquarie and his wife&mdash;a womanly,
sympathetic lady, such as the colony had kept no record of up to
that time&mdash;visited the suffering people, brought them food and
clothes, and made them feel that their case was not entirely
hopeless and desperate. The accounts of this visit show that the
Governor was as simple-minded as he was honest. He walked about
with his wife, and paraded the settlers and their wives and
children before him to inspect the condition of their clothing. It
is true, this was not a difficult task, for the poor wretches had
not much to inspect. The descendants of some of these settlers
attend the Governor's levee now in broadcloth and fine linen, as is
proper; but many of these honest fellows made ready for the parade
in a costume of which the most important garment was represented by
a pair of patched pocket-handkerchiefs. Macquarie showed a fine
skill in the detection of rents and patches, and some of his
critical remarks thereon give evidence of much cultivated taste and
discernment. When this public view was over&mdash;the only art
exhibition the colony had to boast of, by the way&mdash;Macquarie
embodied his reflections in some grandmotherly Orders in which he
gravely remonstrated with the settlers on the disrepair of their
variegated garments. He preached at them, too, in his honest and
well-meaning fashion, and concluded thus, more in sorrow than in
anger, as it were:&mdash;</p>

<p>"His Excellency, therefore, earnestly recommends and trusts that
they will pay more attention to these very important objects, and
by a strict regard to temperance and economy that they will, on his
next annual tour, enable him to give a more unqualified approbation
to their exertions." Then he gave them a rest from such preachments
for the next twelve months.</p>

<p>Macquarie next planned a scheme of inland settlement that would
remove the people out of the reach of the destructive floods. Up to
this time the rulers appear to have been too busy hanging and
flogging convicts, and squabbling among themselves about the sale
of rum, to trouble much about schemes of settlement. Had a man of
Macquarie's type been sent out in the first instance, early
Australian history would have read altogether differently. He
established the townships of Windsor, Castlereagh, Pitt Town,
Richmond, Wilberforce, and Liverpool, and, by way of attracting
settlers he offered town-allotments and cultivation-areas free of
charge to those who would take them. He provided the settlers, as
Bligh wished to do, with sheep and cattle on long credit, and for
50 miles around Sydney he built bridges and laid down roads so that
the agricultural population might have no difficulty in getting
their produce to market. Before his term of office was over he had
constructed over 271 miles of road, and it was during his
government, in 1813, that Blaxland, Lawson, and Wentworth
discovered the pass over the Blue Mountains. The town of Bathurst
was founded by Macquarie, and a road 130 miles long constructed
thereto under his direction.</p>

<p class="b">Page 27</p>

<p>He was quite as active in the matter of the erection of public
buildings, as so many of them unhappily remain to witness. Their
number was only equalled by their ugliness of design, but for this,
of course, Macquarie can hardly be held responsible. The memorials
of the Dutch design of Governor Macquarie's demoniac architect cast
squat shadows over all the old settled districts of the colony.
Over 200 churches, schools, hospitals, stores, barracks, and other
structures of the kind were built by him in New South Wales. In
Sydney there were 67; in Parramatta there were 20 more; in Van
Diemen's Land there were 47. The story of the "Rum Hospital"
belongs to this chapter of Macquarie's activity.</p>

<p>Some years ago a building stood in Macquarie-street, Sydney,
known as the Sydney Infirmary. It has since been pulled down, and
its site occupied for some years by a half-finished edifice of
dressed stone, on which the work was suspended because of some
dispute, which arose when it was half finished, as to the purpose
the building should be devoted to when completed. The useless walls
still stand, to mark our purposelessness as a people. But it is to
the old Sydney Infirmary that this story refers. When Macquarie
expressed a wish one day that there might be a large general
hospital in Sydney, three individuals came forward modestly with a
little plan and a meek proposal. These men were D'Arcy Wentworth,
Garret Blaxcell, and Alexander Riley. Their plan was for a building
to cost £50,000, a sum which Macquarie, in his simplicity, thought
out of the question. But here the meek proposal came in
opportunely. These three philanthropists offered to build the
hospital on condition that they received the sole right to buy all
rum and other spirits imported into the colony for three years.
This was granted, and the three philanthropists "rigged" the rum
market. To say that the other rum-purveyors were disgusted with
this astute manoeuvre would very poorly express the extent to which
their honest bosoms were wrung.</p>

<p>The "boodlers" made the most of their monopoly. Whenever a ship
came in one of the trinity would go on board and fix his own price,
as the captain could not sell to anyone else. They usually paid
9<i>s</i>. per gallon, and 1<i>s</i>. to the orphanage fund! Then
the publicans purchased from the store at from £2 per gallon to £2
17<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. The rum was retailed at 5<i>s</i>. per
half-pint. The result of the transactions is thus figured out by
Dr. Lang;&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the year 1824, the Rum Hospital was calculated to be worth
£20,000. The quantity of Bengal rum the contractors received was
60,000 gallons. The monopoly was for three years, it was afterwards
extended to three years and a-half, and was supposed to be worth
£100,000." This was over and above the first 60,000 gallons. "In
short," says Lang, "the monopoly was a sort of <i>regium donum</i>,
or royal gift, over and above the fair market price of the articles
bargained for." Besides all this, the contractors paid half their
men's wages in provisions or rum, and built taverns near the works
to receive the cash payment back again.</p>

<p>"These three gentlemen, who have the monopoly of the spirit
trade," wrote Holt at the time, "say that they built the hospital;
but I assert it is the poor people of the colony who built it."</p>

<p>Hence the appropriate name of the "Rum Hospital." Macquarie was
not, of course, a man of commercial training. But to outwit the
schemes of men trained in the early rum traffic of Botany Bay would
have taxed the faculties and training of Beelzebub himself.</p>

<h2><a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>Chapter XIX. The Emancipists.</h2>

<p>Macquarie saw little difference between the convicts and their
gaolers, except that the one class wore fetters while the other did
not. As soon as the irons were knocked off there was nothing to
choose between them. He therefore saw no reason why the Emancipist
should not have the same chances as the Pure Merino, so he made no
scruple about appointing ex-convicts to the magistracy, and
inviting them to dine at his own table. Evil communication with the
upper classes of the settlement had corrupted his manners to such a
degree that he thought he might as well dine with ex-convicts as
with their gaolers, and with better chance of finding himself in
honest company. Wherever he saw encouragement he emancipated
convicts, therefore, and those who prospered more or less honestly
received the same recognition as those who had prospered
dishonestly and had not been convicts. He reasoned that the
settlement of Botany Bay was a penal settlement, and he failed to
see that its gaolers had any further social claims than other
turnkeys he had heard of. The ex-convict had some claim, for he was
on his own ground, and when his term had expired he was entitled
while within the colony to all the social rights and privileges he
had forfeited on British soil by his offences. All this was very
simple. But it did not please the Pure Merinos or fall in with
their views at all.</p>

<p>Macquarie had not been a month in the colony before he made his
first advance to the Emancipists. There is a story that the
Governor found it necessary to say something caustic to Colonel
Foveaux&mdash;a worthy man who barely escaped being hanged by the
neck for an atrocity committed by him at Norfolk Island. Foveaux in
revenge advised him to encourage the Emancipists, knowing that if
he did so he would at once incur the remorseless enmity of the Pure
Merinos. Macquarie took the advice offered him, which was in
accordance with his own impulse, and made Andrew Thomson a
magistrate. This man's story is a fair sample of that of a large
class in the colony. He was transported while a mere boy, at the
age of 16, for setting fire to a stack of hay. This meant that for
a boy's freak he was taken from his home and his mother's roof and
sent to herd for life with murderers and cut-throats, 16,000 miles
away. The original design of the settlement offered some chance
that when his sentence expired he might at least regain civil
rights, though he could not leave the colony. But the Pure Merinos
denied these poor wretches even that small mercy. For one
thoughtless act done by an idle boy in a Scotch hayfield near his
own home he was doomed to crawl for life on his hands and knees
under the lash of ruffians whose crimes were a thousand times worse
than his. But Macquarie came and rescued him. He had been a
labourer in the stonemasons' gang at Parramatta, and possibly some
of the stones in some of those dismal old buildings that yet reek
with foul memories of the past, still bear the mark of Andrew
Thomson's pick. When his sentence was done he went to Windsor, kept
a shop, and sent boats down to Sydney. By hard work he became rich,
and lent money to the Hawkesbury farmers, besides giving them
credit for their supplies. When the floods came, instead of closing
on the homeless wretches as the Macarthurs of the settlement did,
he gave them assistance and time. He thus acquired great influence
among them, and they learnt to trust him in preference to the
officers who oppressed them. This was the man whom Macquarie made
his first emancipist magistrate. He could not have chosen a man
more distasteful to the Pure Merinos. When Foveaux found his advice
taken, he said, in his elegant way, that "he had now placed a
blister on Governor Macquarie that he would never be able to
remove."</p>

<p>It must have been a touching spectacle to see Andrew Thomson
take his seat at the table of the Governor, among his former
gaolers. Pleasant reminiscences did they doubtless discuss over the
walnuts and the wine&mdash;that is, if there were any walnuts, or
wine, or any other beverage besides rum, in Botany Bay settlement
in those days. The officers of the 73rd Regiment also admitted the
new magistrate to their table, and the Pure Merinos' withers were
wrung once more. But the familiar demon they blasphemously
nicknamed Providence, who seemed to have deserted them lately,
again looked after them as before. Andrew Thomson died. He was only
a magistrate a very brief while. And the Governor set up a
tombstone over the grave of the man who burnt a hay-stack when he
was a boy, and on the stone he had an epitaph inscribed, which set
forth "that it was in consequence of his character and conduct that
he appointed him to be a magistrate in the colony, and that by that
same act he restored him to that rank in society which he had
lost." It was all the good-natured Macquarie could do for this
rustic victim of savage British laws. There were no
<i>post-mortem</i> examinations at Botany Bay in those days.</p>

<p class="b">Page 28</p>

<p>Alarmed at these serious encroachments on their privileges, the
Pure Merinos had recourse to their old tactics. They wrote
anonymous letters, and slandered Macquarie behind his back; and
then they used their influence at home to set the Colonial Office
in motion to have him censured or recalled. The same tortuous ways
they followed to disgrace Hunter and King, and to slander Bligh,
were crawled over once more to ruin Macquarie. The result of their
scheming was that Mr. Commissioner Bigge was appointed to proceed
to Botany Bay and enquire into the condition and prospects of the
convict population, and the working of the transportation system
generally. This man Bigge was signally unfitted for the responsible
duties committed to him. He had as much qualification for his
commissionership as Phillip had to bring out the First
Fleet&mdash;a duty, as we have seen, for which his superior officer
said he was not fit. Perhaps Bigge was appointed for the same
reason; certainly appointments to Botany Bay were not much run
after in those days. He seems to have fallen into the hands of the
Pure Merinos from the start, and they so blew out this pitiful
bladder of a man with stories about their own virtues and the vices
of the ex-convicts that he nearly burst with the information that
he absorbed. Mr. Bigge was morally garotted by the ex-officers the
moment he set foot on shore. He was exactly in the position of a
distinguished visitor to-day who visits the colonies, perhaps, to
write a book. He, too, falls into the hands of a class; and goes
away with an impression that Australia is populated with purblind
lickspittles, who give good dinners and don't know how to serve
them. This was the case with Mr. Bigge. He discovered that Botany
Bay was peopled with angels&mdash;these were the ex-officers of the
New South Wales Corps; and with fiends&mdash;who were the
ex-convicts. He reported accordingly, and those who remember
Macarthur's anonymous letters and the shameless slanders about
Bligh, will not require to be told what that report said in detail.
The burden of it was that vested interests and the rights of
property must be maintained.</p>

<p>All the slanders that could be raked together against
Macquarie's administration were put into that report. His very
activity in building and roadmaking was made a charge against him,
and his efforts to reform the convicts by giving them some
encouragement to live honestly, were turned into an accusation
against him. The grounds on which this was done are too
characteristic to be omitted. It was said that many of these
derelict creatures, when they got grants of land or wages for
labour, at once turned them into rum. This was horrible. But not so
horrible as the fact that the whited sepulchres who sold the rum to
these wretches for their wages or their land, and enriched
themselves further by the fact, were the same people who virtuously
pointed out this state of things to the fatuous Mr. Bigge. Their
moral indignation at the methods they themselves employed to make
their fortunes would put the Scribes and Pharisees to shame. But
the Australian "first families" have never been of the kind of
botanical specimen that delights to blush unseen, and waste its
fragrance on the desert air.</p>

<p>This case of Andrew Thomson is a representative one, and it
demonstrates the tactics of the ex-officers better than anything
else. Mr. Commissioner Bigge, who censured Macquarie in his report
for making Thomson a magistrate, swallowed all the officers told
him with gudgeon-like avidity. His report set forth that Thomson
was said to have been a man of immoral life and an illicit
still-keeper. Macquarie, on his tombstone, eulogised his character
and conduct. There is, therefore, a conflict of evidence between
Macquarie and the ex-officers. When it is remembered what adepts at
slander these men had always proved themselves, and when their
command of every channel of calumny from the anonymous letter down
to Mr. Commissioner Bigge is also considered, the verdict becomes a
very easy one. But the matter is settled when it is further
remembered that these British officers and gentlemen were so
notoriously profligate in their lives as to keep and maintain
harems of convict women, who, when they had served their turn, were
drafted off to retail for their owners that rum which was illicitly
distilled for them by their convict servants when the importation
of spirits was forbidden by King and Bligh. When it was necessary
to hunt up some charges to blast the reputation of an unhappy
wretch like Thomson, these ex-officers had only to look into their
own lives to find abundant colour for their fancy pictures. Very
little indeed was left to the imagination.</p>

<p>One thing all the machinations of the ex-officers failed to
conceal, or to prevent from getting into Bigge's report. This was
the fact of the awful misery and unspeakable dereliction of the
convict classes in the colony. Horrible stories and horrible
incidents of everyday so forced themselves on the Commissioner's
attention that he could not but leave some record of what he heard
and saw. Macquarie had indeed done something to cut out of the
system a little of that barbarism that the New South Wales Corps
had introduced. But it is to be considered that Macquarie was
himself a man bred to a career which at that time was anything but
a philanthropic one. His personal character impelled him in the
direction of humanity in his rule, but his training was against it.
Moreover the long rule of the Corps had so corrupted and
demoralised both the free and the convict population that
humanitarianism in the ruler would almost have been out of place.
So the hanging and flogging went merrily on; but Mr. Bigge's report
went home and began to open Englishmen's eyes to the cess-pool of
legalised ruffianism they had established under their flag.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch20" id="ch20"></a>Chapter XX. Some Poets and
Patriots.</h2>

<p>We have given so much attention to the antagonism between the
Emancipists and the Pure Merinos because, as our story goes on, it
will appear that after the old convict lines had been obliterated,
and the country populated by free immigrants, the old antagonism
between class and class was still maintained under different names.
An instance soon occurred to show how completely the officials had
been influenced by the ex-officers to oppose the amelioration of
the convicts' lot.</p>

<p>When Judge Bent succeeded the Judge-Advocate of the same name,
he established a regular Supreme Court, and one of his first acts
was to deal with an application from certain Emancipists. Crossley,
who was one of Macarthur's victims, and who had been released from
the Newcastle coal-mines when Macquarie came, with two other
ex-convict attorneys named Eagar and Charters, applied for
permission to practise as solicitors and barristers. Judge Bent
refused the petition on the ground that an Act of George I., to
prevent persons convicted of felony from practising in the
law-courts, was in operation in the colony. "I do now solemnly
declare," he said, in giving his decision, "that I will not admit
as attorneys of this Court, nor administer the oaths to persons who
have been transported here as felons; it is contrary to law, and no
circumstance and no necessity can exist so strong in my mind as to
induce me to it."</p>

<p>The Governor supported the emancipist attorneys in their
application, as the principle on which he based his conduct
required. His contention was that the Act did not refer to a penal
colony established to give emancipated offenders a chance of
reformation. He wrote to the Secretary of State on the subject,
explaining his position and the policy of his rule, as well as the
machinations of parties opposed to that policy. Fortunately for
Macquarie, his enemies were not beforehand with him this time. He
had the full approval of the Home authorities for his experiment in
the reformation of emancipists, and, inasmuch as the conduct of
Judge Bent was entirely opposed to the success of that experiment,
that person was at once recalled. Earl Bathurst, writing in the
name of the Prince Regent, considered the removal of Judge Bent "as
necessary to mark the sense and disapprobation which they entertain
of the measures which, so indiscreetly for the colony and himself,
the said Geoffry Hart Bent, Esq., thought it necessary to adopt."
The same letter also conveyed to this luckless wight "the high
displeasure of his Royal Highness, and his positive recall by his
Majesty's Government, on account of conduct which, in their
opinion, could admit of no justification." So Judge Bent sailed out
through the Heads, and was seen of Botany Bay no more.</p>

<p>Judge Barron Field succeeded. He was a friend of Lamb, and knew
Hazlitt and Coleridge, and De Quincey. Dr. Lang, who doesn't seem
to have liked him, said he had the folly to consider himself a sort
of universal genius, and in particular a poet. At all events he
published a volume of so-called poetry which he named "Botany Bay
Flowers." One of the "Flowers" is an address to a kangaroo,
commencing:</p>

<p class="poem">"Kangaroo! Kangaroo!<br>
Spirit of Australia!"</p>

<p>"He makes 'Australia' rhyme with 'failure,'" says Lang;
"shrewdly considering the kangaroo a failure on the part of
Australian Nature in her awkward attempts to make a proper
quadruped for that country. His collection of pieces was altogether
the wretchedest doggerel I have ever seen."</p>

<p>And Lang should have been a judge of doggerel, too; for he
himself published later a most cacophonous collection of rhyming
rubbish. It is strange to find an associate of Lamb and Coleridge
on the Bench at Botany Bay in those days&mdash;snatching a moment,
as it were, from his sentences of hanging and the lash, to pen
little verses respecting the silent tomb, or the kangaroo; and
inditing dreamy elegies on the death of cockchafers while his
fellow-creatures writhed under the lash or dangled from the gallows
to which he had sentenced them. It was only natural that so
cultivated a spirit should seek such congenial literary society as
Botany Bay afforded. We have seen how some of the officers had a
pretty wit, and a deft hand at turning verses&mdash;chiefly
relating to executions and other light subjects of the <i>vers de
société</i> of those days. Among them Judge Field found kindred
spirits, so that he yearned no more for De Quincey and Coleridge,
and the gentle Elia was almost forgotten.</p>

<p class="b">Page 29</p>

<p>So that when the Emancipist question again came up, the new
judge fell an easy victim to the wiles of the literary circle into
which he had fallen. The rum-purveyors probably affected to admire
his verses. Ex-convict Eagar again comes to the front, this time to
press a case against a Mr. Prosper de Mestre. This was an American
merchant settled in Sydney, whose imports of tea from China
interfered with Eagar's business. Finding the law-courts closed
against him, this latter individual had entered on a mercantile
career. He brought an action to recover damages from De Mestre for
the penalties he had incurred as a foreigner, under an old English
Act, for trading in the King's colonies. But De Mestre knew the
official feeling of the settlement. He moved for the official
record of the plaintiff's conviction as his reply to the charge
laid against him. He was successful. For Judge Field, emerging from
his commune with the Muses, quashed the proceedings. This action on
the part of the judge had only one meaning. It meant that no
Emancipist could bring an action-at-law, under any circumstances
whatever, without running the risk of having justice denied him on
the ground that he had been once convicted of felony, and thus
deprived for ever of all rights and privileges as a citizen. This
was exactly the point the Pure Merinos were labouring to
establish.</p>

<p>The delight on the part of the Pure Merinos was only equalled by
the dismay among the Emancipists. They saw themselves again placed
at the mercy of their enemies, and all Macquarie's efforts seemed
vain. An agitation was set on foot amongst them, and on January 23,
1821, a public meeting of Emancipists was held in Sydney to protest
against the decision. It was decided to send a delegation of two of
their number home on a mission to the British authorities, to put
the Emancipists' case before them. Strange to say, it was from this
first public meeting of ex-convicts, nearly 70 years ago, that our
present free institutions and Responsible Government arose.
Stranger still, it is to ex-convict Eagar, the emancipist attorney,
that Australia to-day owes primarily the institutions it possesses.
For with him began the agitation, afterwards taken up by Wardell
and Wentworth, which opened with a demand for a recognition of the
civil rights of Emancipists, and only broke off short at the
granting of Responsible Government in 1856. Eagar went home as one
of the ex-convict delegation, and never returned to the colony to
claim the statue he thus earned.</p>

"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">Judge Barron Field published a volume of verse,
which he called "Botany Bay Flowers."</p>

<p>Macquarie had not much to say while this agitation was going on,
for by this time the long opposition of the Pure Merinos was
beginning to tell on himself. It would be strange if, after
unintermittent attacks, extending over twelve years, with
opposition in the colony and slanders at home, no results were to
be produced. Macquarie was called on to explain the charges made
against him&mdash;why he built hospitals and churches, laid good
roads, and softened the lot of suffering convict wretches. This
fine old soldier made a splendid reply. He described the state of
the colony when he came: there were not 12,000 people, or 8000
acres under crops; the port dues were under £8000. Against this he
described the colony as it was: nearly 40,000 people, 33,000 acres
under tillage, and port dues of £30,000 per annum. The monuments of
his excellent rule were broadcast throughout the land. The convict
population had been relieved. But "even my work of charity," said
Macquarie, referring to the charges of his enemies, "in
endeavouring to restore emancipated and reformed convicts to a
level with their fellow-subjects&mdash;a work which, considered
either from a religious or a political point of view, I shall ever
value as the most meritorious part of my administration&mdash;has
not escaped their animadversion." But the slanders of his enemies
carried weight. Sir Thomas Brisbane came in December, 1821, and
Macquarie went home with the benedictions of the poorer classes in
his ears to die three years later&mdash;another victim to the
powerful remnant of the "Rum-selling Corps."</p>

<p>At this part of our story the name of Dr. Lang suggests itself.
This fine old Scotch parson came to the colony just two years after
Macquarie left, while his brother arrived in the year of that
event. From the moment he felt the ground under his feet, the voice
of the Doctor was heard in the land, and he fought gallantly and
with all the <i>vim</i> of his combative nature whenever his
sympathies were aroused. The son of an Ayrshire peasant, he had
strong prejudices and equally strong sympathies; but, so far as he
knew, and according to his lights, he did good work in his day. The
honest old Doctor's heart was in the right place, and he sounded
the first note of Australian national aspiration: quite a number of
Australian patriots have been Scotchmen! When he was beaten or
temporarily silenced by official influence he thumped the "drum
ecclesiastic" against his foes; and when he drove a hole in the
drum, as he sometimes did, the good man had a little trumpet of his
own which he knew how to sound upon occasion.</p>

<p>Our special concern with Dr. Lang just here is in his capacity
as an alleged historian. He wrote a book which he imaginatively
enough called a "History of New South Wales," but which is nothing
more or less than a very readable autobiography. As a history it is
misleading, chiefly because the indisputable faith of the Doctor
lends it an appearance of trustworthiness which does not altogether
belong to it. Those who read between the lines will see that this
fighting Scotch parson wrote his book with a purpose. But that
purpose was not simply the preparation of a history of the colony.
It was rather to confound the writer's opponents and, as he would
say himself, to make his enemies his footstool.</p>

<p class="b">Page 30</p>

<p>Quite an awful command of Scriptural commination had the
excellent old Doctor, and its choicest flowers were always at the
service of his foes. He seemed to have searched the Scriptures with
a view to preparing damnatory thunderbolts therefrom; and it must
be said in all soberness that his multitudinous references to Holy
Writ are exasperating in the extreme to the reader. Valuable
information about the capacity of the pool of Hebron and other
particulars of the kind are offered as appendices to this history
of New South Wales, and interesting personal details about his
relatives and their affairs relieve the monotony of the work. But
in its philosophical scope Lang's history is very wide of the mark
indeed.</p>

<p>"A new and a great nation, which is destined to extend the
illustrious name, the noble language, the equitable laws, and the
Protestant religion of Britain over the southern hemisphere," was
Dr. Lang's ideal of the Australian national future. It was not a
very broad or a very high one But it was all that could be expected
by the most advanced at the time. Free and independent Australia,
he said, "would be valuable to Great Britain as a mart for her
commerce, a field for the growth of raw produce for her
manufactures, and an eligible outlet for her redundant population
of all classes;" and on the same page his prejudice and training so
far get the better of him that he bursts forth into declamation to
the effect that "it was not to be supposed that zealous Protestants
of any communion could stand tamely by" and see Irish immigration
to Australia! With a view to counterbalance it, he went home
repeatedly and drafted out Scotchmen; and from this began those
interminable race-feuds and miserable class differences on which
scalawag politicians trade to-day. Nothing has done so much to
retard the progress of the Australian people as these acclimatised
racial hatreds and sectarian squabbles. And yet Dr. Lang boasts
that he was the first to decide an election&mdash;at Port
Phillip&mdash;by exciting the Scotch colony he planted there
against the rest of the community.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/36-page-30.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">"He was a Scotchman, and acute...he built an
observatory at Parramatta.</p>

<p>In the struggle between the Emancipists and the Pure Merinos,
too, Lang sided against the former. His relatives had received
grants of land and assigned convict servants. The Doctor's
sympathies were thrown in, therefore, with the propertied classes.
But he was too honest to shut his eyes altogether to their real
characters. So that, though his book is disfigured by rankly
prejudiced attacks against Macquarie and others who strove to
ameliorate the convicts' lot, and give them a chance to reform, it
yet throws a certain amount of light on the proceedings of the
propertied class, as the Pure Merinos began to call themselves, and
on many of their devious methods and tortuous ways.</p>

<p>Had Lang been a man of less prejudice and&mdash;let it be said
with all respect for his honesty&mdash;with less bigotry, it is
hard to judge how far his national aspirations and liberal
sympathies would have carried him. As it was, he opposed Wentworth
and Wardell in the early part of their career, and threw away a
great deal of his influence on petty personal disputes and
miserable sectarian squabbles that were utterly unworthy of

<h2><a name="ch21" id="ch21"></a>Chapter XXI. White Slavery.</h2>

<p>Macquarie went home, as was said, with the benedictions of the
poor in his ears. There is a slanderous and blackguardly book,
published by Major Mudie&mdash;who was very properly horsewhipped
in Sydney for his literary larrikinism&mdash;and known as the
"Felonry of New South Wales," in which the case as between
Macquarie and Commissioner Bigge is squarely put; and it must be
owned that Mudie, whom we will tie up to the triangles when his
turn comes, was not prejudiced in favour of Macquarie's work.</p>

<p>"Mr. Commissioner Bigge," says this red-handed witness, "busied
himself, as is well known, infinitely more in pointing out and
sanctioning trumped-up charges against the Governor, than in
ascertaining the actual condition of the colony, which was his
mission. He took every uncandid and unfair advantage; while the
vipers and unprincipled men...filled the ear of the commissioner
with everything that slander could invent or misrepresentation
fashion into imputation upon the venerable representative of their
sovereign. The commission, therefore, instead of being an enquiry
into the state of the colony, was engaged in getting hold of
everything that could in any way degrade or affect the good name of
the Governor." So much for Mr. Bigge. Macquarie's death was
attributed, by those who knew him best, to the effect of the Botany
Bay calumnies with which he had been pursued. Sir Charles Forbes,
Bart., a man of public virtue and private benevolence, pronounced
his eulogium in the House of Commons, and his intimate knowledge of
Indian and colonial affairs was understood to give the weight of
authoritative decision to his high opinion of Governor Macquarie's
official conduct.</p>

<p class="b">Page 31</p>

<p>"So many disgraceful things have occurred with regard to New
South Wales," says this sensitive candidate for the public
horsewhipping he afterwards received, "that it is absolutely
painful to record them!" And then he goes on to tell the old story
about the appointment of the first Archdeacon of New South Wales.
Mr. Bigge had taken out to Botany Bay as his clerk, a person named
Scott, who had failed in London as a wine-merchant. This Scott was
active in collecting charges against Macquarie from the Pure
Merinos, and "the clerk," we are told, "could condescend to
practices from which the dignity of the commissioners must have
shrunk." There were few rat-holes into which this ferret could not
enter, and his employers were not ungrateful. An appointment was
asked for him. There was none vacant. But that was a small
difficulty while it was possible to make one. So Earl Bathurst was
persuaded to nominate Mr. Scott, the bankrupt wine-merchant, as
Archdeacon of New South Wales at an apostolic salary of £2000 per
annum. Concerning whom there is told a certain frivolous story.</p>

<p>Now, in those days, the editor and proprietor of one of the
Sydney newspapers was, strangely enough, a pew-renter in the
Archdeacon's Church of St. James, in Sydney. He was moved of the
Evil One to offer certain cynical observations in his paper
respecting the new Archdeacon; and the wisdom of the serpent in
that reverend if somewhat vinous person prompted him to retaliate
and scoop the offender's pew. The editor was served with a notice
to take possession of another pew "in a cold and comfortless part
of the church."</p>

<p>He objected, and was told that police constables would be placed
to keep the pew against all comers, and any trespassers would be
forthwith ejected from the house of prayer. Now, the editor was the
proud and happy progenitor of no less than six large daughters; and
every Sunday he made a descent in force on the disputed dew, which
had been locked by the vinous Archdeacon and the name-plate torn
off, only to be repulsed by the constables with their staves. At
first the newspaper-man contented himself with standing in the
aisle, in mute protest, while "the delicate females, his daughters,
sat on the cold stone steps of the altar-piece."</p>

<p>It must be confessed that these proceedings lent an agreeable
attractiveness to the church service; and we learn that every
Sunday the building was crowded by congregations that the
Archdeacon's eloquence failed to attract, who trooped in to see the
pantomime. It is to be remembered that there were fewer theatrical
performances in those days than now. But standing in the aisle soon
proved as tame and spiritless a course of conduct for the father as
sitting on the cold stone steps, even of an altar-piece, was to his
daughters. So he excogitated a new development, and every now and
then, when the proud Archdeacon wasn't looking, the newspaper man
would swoop down on one of his fail progeny, and, amid a whirl of
white drapery and a flutter as of apocalyptic wings, the young lady
would perform a thrilling acrobatic feat with her parent's
assistance, and land with more or less elegance though always with
considerable spirit on the inside of the pew. The congregation
liked that. But the proud Archdeacon in his scarlet pride thought
this was running the authorised performance rather
close&mdash;there were no choirs of surpliced ladies then!&mdash;so
he had the pew decked over with boards, held down with bars and
screws to defeat the newspaper man. That stopped him. Then he took
the case into court, seeing that it was likely to afford no more
wholesome fun, and wrung the Archdeacon's bosom by obtaining
damages for illegal ejection from his pew. Mr. Scott went home
then, and his spirited apostolate came abruptly to a close.</p>

<p>The rule of Sir Thomas Brisbane, K.C.B., began on December 1,
1821. He was a Scotchman, and acute. He saw that Macquarie made
unnecessary trouble for himself by his conscientiousness, so he
determined to let Botany Bay have its own way. He built an
observatory at Parramatta, therefore, and occupied himself in
keeping a strict eye on the movements of Venus and Jupiter. While
he followed the stars in their courses through a narrow tube the
Pure Merinos took everything into their own hands more completely
than ever. The old trading monopolies grew up again, and the old
atrocities, and the old squalor. Convicts shrieked under the cat
again, and dangled on gibbets as of old; the settlers were
exploited and robbed on the old system, and all the miseries of the
"rum era" were renewed once more. And still Governor Brisbane, in
his eyrie at Parramatta, complacently surveyed the stars.</p>

<p>Free immigration began to set in in larger numbers now than ever
before, and as most of those who came brought some little money
with them, they are usually described as being of a better class
than those who reached Botany Bay up to this time. If a new arrival
could prove to the Governor his ability to maintain five convicts
for a fixed number of years, and was prepared to enter into a bond
to that effect, he received a grant of 500 acres of land, with a
breeding cow to each convict. For ten convict servants he received
1000 acres and ten cows; and so on. From this, dates the real
beginning of the convict assignment system, though, of course,
convict servants had been assigned out more or less from the first
days of the settlement. The demand for convict labour became so
great that "though great multitudes were annually transported from
England, numbers of free immigrants had to wait, with great
inconvenience, for convict servants with whose labour to cultivate
their lands."</p>

<p>It is needless to explain at this late hour of the day that
convict service was in reality a kind of white slavery, intensified
by all the most degrading and repulsive features of negro slavery,
but also with some superadded horrors of its own. On their arrival,
the convicts were first drafted off into the convicts' depot at
Hyde Park. There applications were attended to, and white labour
portioned off among the applicants in their due proportions. Major
Goulburn was the Governor's Grand Vizier in those days, and the
centre of the iniquitous system at whose heart he sat like some
ill-omened spider in its web, disposing of the souls and bodies of
convict men and women just as he disposed of the Government cattle
and sheep. The "impenetrable Major," they called him in those days,
and it can easily be imagined what an object of awe this
all-powerful official was to the men and women whose lives lay at
the mercy of his slightest sign.</p>

<p>His was an iron rule. The colony was a prison, he said, and the
prisoners were to be treated accordingly. So they were. The Major
was head turnkey, and all the duties of Custom-house officer,
treasurer, and collector of revenue were discharged by him. He grew
so despotic and so irresponsible at last, that, like all men who
have been entrusted with powers which prove too much for them, he
forgot his duty to his head-gaoler, the Governor, and wanted to
dictate to him, too. The home Government recalled both of them, and
the house of cards the "impenetrable Major" had built fell about
his ears in a moment. It is quite interesting to see these
all-powerful Botany Bay potentates knocked over like nine-pins by
the merest breath of Imperial authority. Judges, governors,
gaolers, even the floggers and hangmen themselves had to grovel
piteously when the Colonial Office spoke. And so Major Goulburn
went home, to spend his old age in bitterly remorseful memories of
Botany Bay; and this story knows him no more.</p>

<p>The assignment system was actually commenced by Hunter, and
lasted up to 1838. It will be remembered that Phillip once wrote of
the Botany Bay settlement, that "there can be no slavery in a free
land, and consequently no slaves." These fine words fell signally
to the ground. From the moment the assignment system was introduced
until the despatch was received for its discontinuance, a form of
slavery more degrading than any Assyria or Louisiana ever
knew&mdash;more disgraceful than negro slavery as the white man is
above the black&mdash;held its unbridled course in New South Wales.
It is startling to think that it is not yet fifty years since these
horrors passed away, and that some of the persons responsible for
their existence still exercise legislative power under the free
institutions of to-day. The convict was in the hands of the
official, body and soul. This state of things generated a condition
of cringing servitude on the one side, and on the other a class
sentiment of authority and assertion of superiority, both of which
still strongly survive, though the conditions that produced them
have long since passed away. So long as a single official, trained
and formed under the old Imperial system, continues in the service
of the country, and so long as the traditions of that system cling,
so long will these squalid traces continue to be apparent.</p>

<p class="b">Page 32</p>

<p>Nearly every large holder of assigned convict servants was a
magistrate. A flogger was part of each magistrate's retinue, and
the triangles were a common feature in every well-regulated
homestead. Neighbouring employers honoured each other's notes of
hand by administering a flogging to the bearer; and often a worthy
magistrate, in the cool shadow of his spacious verandah, dined
pleasantly with his wife and daughters to the music of a yelling
wretch triced up to the torture at an easy distance away.</p>

<p>In the book Lang imaginatively called his history there is a
description of the way the system worked, illustrated by examples.
He takes the common case of an emigrant settler&mdash;it is to be
remembered that Lang was an eye-witness of all these
things&mdash;who returns to his farm after an absence of some weeks
idling about the country, and finds that his servants have been
idle in his absence. He curses and swears at them until a man who
has seen better days forgets himself so far as to reply to his
ruffianly master. The convict is at once haled before the next
magistrate, who orders the delinquent to receive 25 lashes or more.
As soon as the man is fit for labour he is put to the plough, which
he takes the opportunity, perhaps, to break on a stump. He is sent
to the chain-gang for a term, and when that is over he escapes to
the bush, perhaps murdering his tyrant, or setting fire to his
homestead. It was so that bushrangers were manufactured. Lang adds
that the escapees perhaps rob a settler's cart for food a few days
after their escape, are captured, and hanged as a matter of course.
And, speaking of his own solemn experience as a clergyman in these
cases, he further adds that the "wretched men assure the minister
who may visit them in gaol or attend them, on the scaffold, that it
was the arbitrary and unfeeling conduct of their masters alone that
brought them to an untimely end."</p>

<h2><a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>Chapter XXII. The Assignment of
Women.</h2>

<p>The assignment of women-convicts was a delicate task, and one
that taxed all the ingenious evil of the officials of those days.
The women were of many classes&mdash;from the harridan to the
lady-pickpocket. Anyone who has read anything of the hideous state
of things that obtained in Newgate when Mrs. Elizabeth Fry began
her prison-work will not require to be told anything here about
these ladies' apprenticeship for Botany Bay. The voyage out was a
dismal orgie, of which the less said the better. "Every convict
ship," says one writer, "carries out a herd of females of all ages,
and of every gradation in vice, from the veriest troll to the fine
madam who displayed her attractions in the theatres. All who can
carry with them the whole paraphernalia of the toilette, with
trunks and boxes stuffed with every kind of female dress and
decoration they can come at." These women had unlimited freedom of
intercourse among themselves in the prison-room, and on a certain
portion of the deck at a fixed part of the day, and this completed
the corruption of the younger among them. The discipline of the
female convicts was entrusted to the surgeon, and many stories are
told about the lady-favourites of the surgeons, and their conduct
towards the rest of their fellow-convicts.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/38-page-32.jpg" alt=

</p>

<p class="caption">Engaging a servant in the good old days.</p>

<p>"The madams on board," wrote a sarcastic person, "occupy the few
days which elapse before their landing in preparing to produce the
most dazzling effect at their descent upon the Australian shore.
With rich silk dresses&mdash;bonnets <i>à la mode</i>&mdash;ear
pendants three inches long&mdash;gorgeous shawls and splendid
veils&mdash;silk stockings, kid gloves, and parasols in hand,
dispensing sweet odours from their profusely perfumed forms, they
disembark, and," adds this poetically imaginative observer, "are
assigned as servants, and distributed to the expectant settlers."
Then we get descriptions of the triumphant passage of these
syrens&mdash;of the offers of marriage made them loudly from the
waysides, and the besieging of ardent swains at their new homes.
Sometimes the settler wanted only a servant and received a sultana;
and one writer describes how a fair creature so assigned him swept
down on the devoted homestead with a cargo of attar of roses and
botanical cream, Macassar oil and cosmetics and scented soaps, and
a profusion of the delicate trifles that adorn a lady's
toilette-table; and even then the flighty thing wept for an
exclusive dressing-room of her own.</p>

<p>Of the other class of women-convicts it is said that their
language, manners, and conduct were infinitely too dreadful for
published description. "Their language, disgusting even when heard
by profligate men, would pollute the eyes cast upon it in writing.
Their open and shameless vices must not be told. Their fierce and
untameable audacity would not be believed.</p>

<p>"Were the veil raised, and the appalling spectacle exhibited as
it really is, the picture would be too horrid for affrighted
humanity to look upon." A good deal might be said on this subject,
but we prefer to leave these extracts to speak for themselves in
this unsavoury connection. At the same time it may be added that if
the writer on Australian subjects is to be squeamish on those
matters there would be no such thing as Australian history at all.
Most of our early story is made up that way.</p>

<p>When the Australian colonist of to-day, who does not belong to
the past of Australian history and has no sympathy with it, looks
back to see what the coming nation owes to the mother-country, the
disembarking of the cargo of one of these convict-women ships will
afford one crushing answer. The women who were sent out here with
the full and avowed intention of making them the mothers of the
future Australian men and women were such demireps and harridans as
our eye-witnesses' extracts have described. When it shall become
necessary, by-and-bye, to tell Imperial officialdom that its day in
Australia is over, those who are called on to say as much will have
to remember this fact, and nerve themselves to meet the sneer that
will remind them of what the mother country kindly decided in their
regard.</p>

<p class="b">Page 33</p>

<p>The female convicts were assigned within eight or ten days after
their landing, and when the applicants were all supplied the
remainder were sent to the Women's Factory, at Parramatta. That den
of iniquity contained at times many hundreds of women, of all
classes; from the rustic girl to the swell mobsman's "lady." They
were divided into three sections. The first was made up of those
who had never been assigned, or who, having been sent out to
service, had been returned to the Factory without any recorded
complaint against them. The third class contained those who had
been returned from service for insubordination, or otherwise giving
trouble, and female convicts who had been sentenced for offences
committed in the colony to terms not long enough for
transportation. The second class was filled by those who had
completed their term of sentence.</p>

<p>For the demirep class of convict women the factory was rather a
pleasant asylum than otherwise. "The females pass their time in
sufficient merriment," we are told, "relating to each other their
former histories, their amours and debaucheries, the thefts in
which they have been concerned, and the crimes for which they
respectively received sentence of transportation." So much was this
recognised that it was said to be a common thing for female
convicts of this class to demand of their mistresses to send them
there, and "flatly and with fearful oaths to disobey their orders
for the purpose of securing the accomplishment of their wish." But
it was the women of the other class&mdash;the poor creatures who,
for some petty offence had been torn away from their homes as
hundreds were in those days, and sent to herd with felons at Botany
Bay, that felt the full horror of this dreadful abode. The chaplain
Marsden&mdash;he was familiarly known as "Old Flog 'em" by these
Factory women&mdash;prescribed a flogging for all breaches of
discipline, and the lash was always going in some part of the
establishment or other, so that the chaplain's nickname was
suggested by his favourite phrase.</p>

<p>The Factory was also a kind of matrimonial bureau. When the
convict could obtain his master's consent, he repaired to the
Factory to select a wife. Then the unmarried belles wore drawn up
in line before this modern Paris of Botany Bay, whose duty it was
to award the prize for which the goddesses disputed of old. Many
were the languishing graces and captivating arts used to influence
the hesitating swain, and some future poet or painter of Botany Bay
will doubtless arise to do tardy justice to these novel conditions
of love's young dream. When Paris made his selection and his
critical eye was satisfied, he crooked his finger and said "'Ere!"
to the blushing damsel, capriciously coy, on whom he had fixed his
young affections. They talked it over together, and the other
ladies looked on. Sometimes the fair one was difficult, and the
terms could not be arranged. She was sent back to her place in the
ranks of female loveliness, and another selection made without a
moment's hesitation. There is no record of any swain having been
rendered desperate by this outrage to his blighted affections.</p>

<p>In some cases when free settlers made their selection in this
way, it was found after the honeymoon that the dispositions of the
twain were incompatible. Then the discarded wife was promptly
"turned in" to the Factory, and a new selection made. There was an
easy facility about this method of divorce that recommended
itself.</p>

<p>The ill-treatment of the convict women among the settlers was so
general that most of them preferred to be in the Factory to being
sent out to service. Servitude under one master for two years
entitled these women to a ticket-of-leave, but during that time
they were very often the creatures of the irresponsible caprice of
their mistresses&mdash;and only a woman with power over another can
really exhaust the art of cruelty in all its ramifications and
possibilities. Of the five or six hundred women with which the
Factory was always peopled, from one to two hundred were always
mothers of illegitimate children.</p>

<p class="caption">"He crooked his finger and said ''ere!'"</p>

<p>The distance from Sydney to Parramatta by water is about 14
miles. Women were conveyed there in boats under the escort of a
guard of soldiers. Judge Therry, in his <i>Reminiscences</i>, gives
an account of these water-picnics. He describes the soldiers as
taking provisions and rum with them in their
boats&mdash;provisioning them as if for a lengthened cruise. As
soon as they got away from the city a scene of drunken revelry
commenced. It took the soldiers and their convoys sometimes seven
days to perform that journey of 14 miles. The reader may consult
the <i>Reminiscences</i> of the learned Judge fur further
information on this and other kindred subjects.</p>

<p>Another feature about the assignment of convict servants was
that men were often assigned to their wives, and wealthy
transportees to their friends. When a man was convicted in London
or elsewhere, he was sent to Botany Bay as a convict while his wife
or any woman who passed as such&mdash;forged certificates were
always common in Botany By&mdash;followed him in the first ship
with the booty. She got her husband assigned to her. Sometimes the
arrangement worked well, and sometimes not. But this novel
matrimonial device had certain advantages. For it often happened
that when the husband forgot his changed position&mdash;that he was
a convict assigned to his wife, in short&mdash;these matter-of-fact
women were careful to impress the fact on their affectionate
spouses. This produced words and sometimes a quarrel But the women
were quite equal to the conflict. They just handed their quondam
lords and masters over to the nearest constable, who brought them
before a magistrate. That excellent man promptly sentenced them to
be flogged as convicts who had shown themselves insubordinate in
their assigned service, and so the balance of marital power was in
some measure equalised. These playful proceedings put the domestic
question in quite a novel and captivating light.</p>

<p>After what has been said it is almost unnecessary to add that
the morality of the town of Sydney itself was at a hopelessly low
ebb. The practice of concubinage was common up to the time of
Governor Bourke, and a general profligacy had gangrened the whole
of the community. The immoral customs of the town were so flagrant
and so notorious that no one ever thought of censuring another
unless it was for falling behind in these brutalities of wantonness
that had no redeeming feature to soften the repulsiveness of their
vice. People have been brutal and coarse before, but most that have
distinguished themselves in that way knew how to throw a glamour of
some kind or another over their excesses. The villa of Lucullus saw
strange sights and azure Capri has mirrored other scenes besides
those of cloud and sky in its day. The story of such places has
been told in more than one way, but most of those who have told of
them have had something else to relate besides mere records of
salaciousness. But in Sydney everything was bestial. There was no
public redeeming trait. Perhaps the most repulsive picture ever
limned by the historian is that cruelly graphic description of
Sydney of 40 years ago that stands on record in the second volume
of Justin McCarthy's "History of Our Own Time."</p>

<h2><a name="ch23" id="ch23"></a>Chapter XXIII. Vae Victis!</h2>

<p>If the New South Wales Corps left anyone whatever behind to
represent it, this was surely the time to find its representatives
in full activity. Unless the leopard had changed its spots
altogether, this was certainly the set of circumstances calculated
to bring them out in their true colours. The atmosphere of moral
filth which we have rather hinted at than described, was the native
air of what was now the aristocratic element in the colony. It
might indeed be alleged that their fine barbaric spirit had been
veneered over by wealth by this time, and that they had settled
down to honest courses and a bourgeois virtue. But the
characteristics of the Corps were too deeply ingrained for that,
and under favourable circumstances like the present they were
brought out as naturally as heat brings out vermin. Under such
extraordinarily promising conditions the Pure Merinos felt it
incumbent on themselves to show their mettle and do justice to
their training.</p>

<p>While Governor Brisbane was following the stars in their courses
in his eyrie at Parramatta&mdash;the curious reader may yet see the
corner-stone of his observatory beside Old Government House
there&mdash;the Pure Merinos had everything their own way. While
this Governor took charge of the solar system, his subordinates had
full control over that insignificant portion of our own planet
nominally committed to his care. The active concerns of government
passed from his hands to those of his officials, and as Mr.
Commissioner Bigge had censured Macquarie for his efforts to redeem
the convicts from their hopeless condition, Brisbane was determined
not to fall into the same blunder. Consequently the Pure Merinos
arranged these matters after their own plans, and the last state of
the unhappy convict became worse than the first. But what was much
more to the purpose for these people, the Governor no longer
endeavoured to regulate the trading concerns of the settlement as
his predecessor had done, and the old iniquitous system of monopoly
and spoliation began again as actively as ever. The Pure Merinos
obtained command of the market, using the ill-gotten wealth they
had amassed for the purpose, and the condition of things was soon
as bad as it had ever been under the sailor-governors.</p>

<p>Trading operations were carried on under a system of exchange.
The settler who sent a consignment of wheat to the King's Store at
Sydney obtained a receipt from the commissariat officer in charge.
This receipt he passed on to the merchant, in exchange for rum and
other necessaries of life&mdash;such as clothing, provisions, and
the like. The merchants were principally the Pure Merinos; and
they, true to the traditions of their order, charged most
exorbitant rates for the accommodation they thus gave the poorer
settlers. The consequence was that these, as a class, plunged
deeply into debt. It is said that nine-tenths of the population
were hopelessly involved in this way during the rule of Sir Thomas
Brisbane. During Macquarie's time they were, to some extent,
protected against any undue use being made by their creditors of
the great power thus gained. As the goods turned into the store
were sold, these creditors were paid in whole or in part, and so
the process went on. But with the new Governor the harpies saw
their chance, and took it. Brisbane did not interfere in such
matters, and in 1822 an order was issued in his name by the
officials, stating that in future all grain should be supplied to
the store by tender, and that no produce would be received at any
one time beyond the amount required for the next ensuing quarter.
This step was taken concurrently with another that worked exactly
in the same direction. This was to change the circulating medium
suddenly from colonial currency to sterling coin. This notable
project at once raised the pound sterling 25 per cent, above the
pound currency&mdash;for up to that time the medium of exchange in
the colony was made up in motley fashion from English coins,
Spanish dollars, moidores, and pieces of eight.</p>

<p>The devilish ingenuity that devised this double-handled weapon
soon put it to active use. Two results at once accrued&mdash;the
King's Store as a market for the settlers' produce was suddenly
closed, and the money of the settlement was depreciated in value.
The natural effect followed. There was a rush of settlers with
grain to the temporary market opened for the collection of the
quarter's supplies, and at the same moment a demand from the
creditors for the settlement of outstanding accounts. The settler
found himself in this position. Any money he held was reduced in
value 25 per cent, by the change of currency, and the Commissariat
receipts which he usually gave as securities for his debts were
about to be withheld from issue. They were ready to sell at any
price to save themselves from ruin; but the King's Store was only
prepared to buy three months' supply. They, therefore, competed to
undersell each other, to get the benefit of the market while it was
open, and wheat, which had rated at from 7<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. to
10<i>s</i>. per bushel, was eagerly offered at 3<i>s</i>.
9<i>d</i>. currency. The traders profited by this fall in price to
make their claims, and the amount of their debts was paid six-fold
in the value of the produce they received.</p>

<p>This sudden fall in prices gave rise to an impression that grain
was superabundant in the settlement, and that over-cultivation had
produced a supply in excess of the wants of the population.
Unrestrained waste and profusion became the order of the day.
Produce was valued at little or nothing. Provisions were wasted.
And reckless improvidence soon cleared the way for the mistake to
show itself. Before the season was over the supply of grain was
exhausted. Famine began to menace the community, and the prices
rose to 24<i>s</i>. per bushel. Distress and ruin threatened the
agricultural and city population alike. And still the Governor in
his eyrie at Parramatta complacently surveyed the stars.</p>

<p>It would be almost impossible to credit the villainy of persons
who could prompt the framing of these regulations in their own
selfish interest did we not know something of their history.
Studied malignity marked their action in planning this diabolical
plot against a whole community, and the way they set to work to
take unsparing advantage of that plot's success. The long array of
debts contracted by the settlers was suddenly produced. Peremptory
demands for payment were made by these Shylocks in the face of the
prevailing distress. Time was refused, an immediate settlement
insisted upon, and in default the pound of flesh was mercilessly
exacted. Macquarie's little grants of land were swallowed up
wholesale. The poor rewards of industry fell into the insatiable
maws of these ruffianly usurers. Farms were seized for one-fourth
of their value. The cost of goods exchanged in advance against
Commissariat receipts over long periods of years was calculated at,
for the lowest, 100 per cent. above their value; the difference
between sterling and currency was availed of to the utmost; and
with vulpine craft in a dozen tortuous ways with which the usurer
and the money-changer are cunningly familiar, the settlers were
exploited and preyed upon by the merchant class, their little
holdings forfeited, and the enlightened experiment of Macquarie
stultified and blasted before it had time to take definite
shape.</p>

<p>That this plot had been craftily schemed by the Pure Merinos for
some time is proved by the fact that they persuaded Mr.
Commissioner Bigge to recommend the tender system in his report. It
will be remembered that the King's Store was opened to the settlers
by Bligh and Macquarie to snatch them out of the clutches of the
officers of the New South Wales Corps. It was the first object of
these people to get back their power when the tide turned, and what
they were no longer able to do by force or rebellion they now did
by cunning and craft. While Brisbane was star-gazing, they put
Bigge's recommendation into effect. But they added a little feature
of their own. That fatuous person had some faint glimmer of
intelligence or honesty of purpose, or some other valuable abstract
virtue of the kind; and, moreover, he had no interest in being an
absolute miscreant. When he recommended the tender system,
therefore, he added that as much superfluous grain as possible
should be bought at all times, as a provision against droughts and
floods. Had this been done the market would have been kept open to
the settlers. But this was not what the Pure Merinos wanted. So
they suppressed and altered that part of the recommendation, and
shut the market practically altogether. The conduct of the persons
who deliberately reversed the Commissioner's recommendations is
self-condemnatory. It proves what one would willingly be reluctant
in believing&mdash;that creatures could exist of such depravity as
these, to plot against the welfare of a whole community in their
own selfish interests, and prostitute official power to such an
end. But this was in Botany Bay.</p>

<p class="b">Page 35</p>

<p>There was no degradation so deep that these wretches could not
find a deeper depth. One fact will speak more for the real
character of the men than whole pages of description. The
proceedings we have detailed plunged the settlement into famine and
distress. People wanted food. There was grain locked up in the
warehouses of these cold-blooded tyrants, but the victims were too
poor to buy that. When the distress was at its height a vessel was
sent to Batavia for rice, wheat, and other supplies for the relief
of the suffering people. This was done by order of the Governor,
whose eyes had now been opened to his own culpable negligence by
the misery he saw around him. When the ship returned to Sydney with
its precious freight, so anxiously expected, the Pure Merinos saw
that the destitution out of which they were making profit as
carrion-birds fatten on a carcase was about to be relieved. So they
laid another plot, and it would be hard to believe that Mr. John
Macarthur had nothing to do with this, for he was back in the
colony long before this time. It was one of the privileges of the
East India Company that no vessel should carry tea out of Indian
waters without the license of the Directors; and the Company's
charter empowered them to seize any vessel so transgressing as a
lawful prize. Now, the relief ship from Batavia carried a small
packet of 10lbs. of tea, a present to a Government officer in
Sydney. The Pure Merinos informed the captain of a ship-of-war then
in port of this heinous crime. It might be thought that the charter
of the great East India Company was not intended to refer to a
present of 10lbs. of tea. But the result of the criminal and
unpatriotic act of the Pure Merinos was that the relief vessel,
with all its anxiously-expected supplies of food for a starving
people, was forcibly seized and carried off by the man-of-war in
defiance of the Governor, and of the entreaties of the famishing
population who looked hopelessly and helplessly on. The warship
with its prey swept down the harbour and through the Heads out to
sea. The relief-vessel was sold as a prize in an Indian port. And
the Pure Merinos were saved.</p>

<p>These things appear to have galvanized the Governor into
something like activity at last. The misery and privation of the
people around him opened his eyes to the results of his negligence
and infidelity to duty. He made enquiries into matters generally,
and was not slow to find out that the conflict between the Pure
Merinos and the Emancipists lay at the base of all the distress
that had accrued. He found himself unpopular with the masses,
because they looked on him as the passive instrument of the
officials. And he was not long in finding out, also, that these
same men condemned the very measures they had themselves devised
and carried out. They followed their old custom, too, in slandering
him to the authorities at home. Probably this fact had something to
do with his conduct when he began to take an active interest in
affairs. One of his first acts was to take up the cause of the
Emancipists, and during the last year of his government he began to
encourage the more wealthy members of this class. He even went so
far as to agree to accept a banquet at the hands of the leading
Emancipists. This unheard-of atrocity was a challenge to the Pure
Merinos. It brought out one of their best efforts.</p>

<p>Of course, Mr. John Macarthur had a hand in this villainy.
Wherever in the early history of Botany Bay we come across anything
particularly disgusting we may confidently look for this good man's
name. The invitation to the dinner of the Emancipists was given,
and duly accepted, by the Governor. The Pure Merinos had also
prepared their little banquet, and Brisbane, being unwilling to
accept both invitations, suggested that six of the leading
Emancipists might be invited as representatives to the official
demonstration. The committee refused this compromise; their finer
feelings and that nice sense of social distinction which were so
peculiarly their own rebelled against this affront. So the Governor
announced that no further preparations might be made for his
company, and a few evenings later attended the Emancipists' banquet
at Nash's Hotel, Parramatta. Addresses were presented by the
people, who recognised that Brisbane's errors were those of
negligence rather than of ill intent. Then the Pure Merinos
sailed-in. Dr. Lang tells how on returning from one of his many
trips to England, Mr. John Macarthur showed him a copy of a
document which that Botany Bay Machiavelli had forwarded to Earl
Bathurst. It was a list of the names of those who had attended the
Brisbane banquet, with the causes of their transportation set out
at full length, their career in the chain-gang and under the lash,
and the growth of their prosperity subsequently&mdash;all from the
Macarthur point of view. "I could not help regarding with a strong
feeling of reprobation," says Lang, "the superlatively evil spirit
which this precious document evinced, while at the same time I
could not help admiring the consummate artifice with which it was
concocted." But it must be remembered that its author was
Macarthur, and he had given himself plenty of practice. Lang says
in another place that he boasted to him of having procured the
recall of every Governor up to Macquarie. His tactics in this
instance may be compared by the reader with the anonymous newspaper
episode in the case of Governor Bligh.</p>

<h2><a name="ch24" id="ch24"></a>Chapter XXIV. Wentworth and
Wardell.</h2>

<p>The picturesque highwayman of the Claude Duval type had vanished
as completely as G. P. R. James' solitary horseman long before
Botany Bay came into existence, and his place was taken by the
accomplished pickpocket of the Barrington order. The romance of the
road was done with and over. Gallant figures in cocked hats and
cambric frills and laced coats no longer handed highborn ladies
from their carriages to trip a measure under the greenwood tree
before they were eased of their purses. Hounslow Heath was not
haunted any more after dark by the younger sons of the nobility,
who struck gallant attitudes and cried "Stand and deliver!" in the
moonlight; or by the penniless scions of old Jacobite families
eager to despoil the spoilers. The honest fellow who sprang out of
Shepherd's Bush to suggest a startling alternative to the belated
wayfarer was but an ordinary cutpurse or a footpad now, who was
innocent of linen commonly, whose coat was only embroidered with
tatters, and who wore no frills&mdash;cambric or otherwise. Yet all
the same there were occasions every now and then when young fellows
were captivated by stories of those old knights of the
road&mdash;"Diana's horsemen," as they called themselves&mdash;and
longed to emulate the enterprises of these minions of the moon.
They were hanged as soon as they were caught, of course. But
perhaps they thought it as well to fall into the hands of a
Bow-street runner as into those of the press-gang. And perhaps,
after all, they saw very little difference between a leap in the
air and having one's legs shot away in some of the gallant Nelson's
naval wars. So every now and then there was a story of some young
fellow who threw his life away with all the airy abandon of the
most lightsome cavalier who ever blew the foam from a tankard of
nut-brown ale on the way to Tyburn Tree.</p>

<p>One dark night towards the end of last century a Dublin
alderman, who was slumbering in his coach as it rumbled along one
of the roads that led out of his native city, was drowsily aware of
the clatter of horses' hoofs in his neighbourhood, and before he
was well awake the challenge of a highwayman rung out on the crisp
night air. The worthy citizen had only time to see his chaise-lamps
flash on the masked faces of two men whose horses blocked the way.
He was gagged with his own wig, and bound before he knew any more,
and then a blunderbuss-shot from the roadside blew away the top of
one highwayman's head, and nothing more was known of the occurrence
until the coach and its gagged owner were found in the morning.
Only it may be added that a young medical student was arrested as
one of the actors in this little drama, and transported, on very
slender evidence, be it added, to Botany Bay. He might have been
hanged for his alleged share in this freak had it not been for that
fortunate discovery of Captain Cook a very few years before. This
was one way of coming to Australia in those days, but there were a
good many others.</p>

<p>Quite early in the history of the settlement there was a certain
young man employed as an assistant to the Sydney surgeon, and as he
was a useful fellow of a respectable family and connections, he
began to prosper presently. He was sent to Norfolk Island as
medical officer, and, having married in the meantime, a son was
born there in 1791, who afterwards achieved some fame fin this part
of the world under the name of William Charles Wentworth. The elder
Wentworth afterwards became a magistrate of Sydney and Principal
Superintendent of Police, as well as being a merchant, contractor,
and other lucrative things besides. He sent his son away from his
dismal surroundings as soon as he could&mdash;at the age of seven
years, in fact&mdash;to receive his early training as far as
possible away from Botany Bay and its influences.#' The boy
returned to Sydney later on, to be shocked and disgusted,
doubtless, at what he saw around him there, and then went back to
England to finish his scholastic career at Cambridge. He wrote some
verses which have been quoted in colonial books and speeches so
often as to be perfectly nauseous in the ears of Australian
readers.</p>

<p class="b">Page 36</p>

<p>Young Wentworth came back to Sydney in 1824 as a
barrister-at-law. He brought with him his friend, Dr. Wardell, also
a barrister, and both together entered on the practice of their
profession in the colony. They threw in their powerful sympathies
with the Emancipists. It is possible that the generous spirit of
these young men revolted at the squalid meanness and petty tyranny
they saw everywhere around them, and that Wentworth particularly,
as one of the native-born, yearned to do something to sweep away
the organised oppression and injustice that degraded his native
land even in his own eyes, and which must certainly have struck him
with special force, fresh as he was from the atmosphere of an
English University. As we go on we will see that he never entirely
got rid of the results of this academical training, and that the
class traditions he imbibed there threw him out of harmony with the
real Democratic spirit that sprang up in Australia when convictism
had passed away. But this was one of those things that came
later.</p>

<p>About this time&mdash;in March, 1824&mdash;arrived also the
first Chief Justice, Francis Forbes. He brought the first Charter
of Justice with him&mdash;for the Draconic code promulgated by
Phillip under a gum-tree at the head of Sydney Cove can scarcely be
called by that name. It was a fortunate circumstance that this
worthy Judge arrived about the same time as Wentworth and Wardell,
for, as we shall see, they mutually assisted in each other's work,
and in the long run worked together for the eventual emancipation
of the populace. Forbes, before leaving England, had been entrusted
with the duty of drawing up a Charter for New South Wales, and it
is to him that the settlement owes its first steps towards those
representative institutions and the right of trial by jury that
came afterwards. The strongest proof of the extreme bad faith with
which Australian history has been compiled and the fraudulent
spirit in which it has been written, is provided by the fact that
so little mention has been made of the name of our first Chief
Justice. The same reasons that made the names of the Macarthurs and
the gaoler-governors prominent in our historical records have
operated to suppress such names as that of our first Chief
Justice.</p>

<p>Chief Justice Forbes was a Bermudan, and his career in the
colony is a strange instance of a colonial official breaking away
from his early surroundings and training to recognise the justice
of popular claims. He came to Sydney on the departure of Judge
Field,'and the first Attorney-General, Mr. Saxe-Bannister, and the
first Solicitor-General, Mr. John Stephen, followed him the same
year. His first act on arrival was to promulgate the Charter of
Justice at the Supreme Court, at Government House, and in the
public market-place. This Charter, based as we have said on an Act
framed by himself before he left England, was the first public act
that lifted the people of the colony from the servile position they
had hitherto occupied at the mercy of the irresponsible official
and military authorities. The first Legislative Council was
established, consisting of the Lieutenant-Governor, General
Stewart, Judge Forbes, Colonial Secretary Goulburn,
Surveyor-General Oxley, James Bowman, and John Macarthur. Any Act
of this Council, in order to become law, required the certificate
of the Chief Justice, and this prudent proviso worked most
beneficially in the public interest later on.</p>

<p>Up to this time no jury of civilians had ever sat in New South
Wales, and when at the Quarter Sessions Court held at Liverpool, on
October 14, 1824, Judge Forbes directed the empanelling of a civil
jury for the first time, the magistrates, following the traditions
of the class to which they almost exclusively belonged, refused
their consent to this measure of reform. The matter was argued in
the Supreme Court before the Chief Justice, who decided against
these obstructive magistrates.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/42-page-36.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">"Stand and deliver."</p>

<p>It will be seen that this innovation was actually forced on the
colony, in a measure, in opposition to the will of the leading
colonists themselves. At the sitting of the Supreme Court next year
a jury was again empanelled, but this time the Pure Merinos tried
another stratagem. When the lists were made known it was found that
the Emancipists were entirely unrepresented. Wentworth and Wardell
had brought out with them to the colony a small printing-plant,
with which they started the <i>Australian</i> newspaper on October
14, 1824&mdash;about a month after their arrival. The
<i>Australian</i> took up the cause of the Emancipists, and pointed
out the glaring injustice of a jury-list so framed. The Emancipists
placed their case in the hands of Wentworth and Wardell, who made
an application to the Court to call on the Sheriff to show cause
why certain submitted names should not be inserted in the
jury-list. Chief Justice Forbes was compelled to rule against this
application on a technical ground, and for a time the movement for
popular jury rights fell through.</p>

<p>Two years later, at a public meeting held in the Courthouse,
this right of juries was again brought up by Wentworth, and a
petition w r as drawn up and sent home. By this time ex-Governor
Brisbane had returned to England, and he used his interest in
favour of the popular movement. Sir James Macintosh was induced to
present the petition to the Commons, and in his speech he referred
to the evidence of Governors Macquarie and Brisbane and Chief
Justice Forbes to prove that New South Wales was now as ripe for
the enjoyment of popular rights and privileges as any other
dependency of the British Crown. But it was not until the time of
Governor Bourke that the right of trial by jury was fully
recognised in its complete form.</p>

<p class="b">Page 37</p>

<p>In the meantime, circumstances were preparing the colony and its
people for the struggle for popular privileges on which they were
about to enter. Those who formed the rank-and-file of the
population now saw themselves for the first time a power in the
community. They had the most unbounded confidence in the two young
men whom a happy chance had given them for their leaders. Through
them the voice of the population at large was articulately given
forth, and the unfortunates who had hitherto cringed under the lash
of their masters now found their wants and opinions actually
published and put forward in a newspaper of their own. They welded
their forces together, and formed the Patriotic
Association&mdash;not confined to Emancipists alone, but embracing
all those free immigrants and settlers who looked forward to the
time when the new country they were opening up should be freed from
the miseries that cursed it, and made fit for their sons and
daughters to live in.</p>

<p>While the Emancipists had been growing in numbers and influence,
they were also growing in wealth. In many streets of what is now
old Sydney fine blocks of buildings reared their stone fronts in
the air, and it became a not unusual thing to find names that were
first heard in the colony when they were read from the manifest of
a prison ship, now flaunting in carven stone on the coping-stones
of some of these pretentious edifices. The poorer settlers and free
immigrants who had been for some years in the colony had also
acquired wealth by this time, but the exclusive spirit of the old
propertied classes had, so far, effectually shut them out from any
real influence in the community. Both these classes, therefore,
fell into line when the Patriotic Association was formed, and
mutually strengthened each other's hands. Up to this time, the only
newspaper in the colony was the old Sydney <i>Gazette</i>, started
in 1803; and that journal did little else than chronicle the
proceedings of officialdom. The first issue of the
<i>Australian</i>, in the hands of its capable editors, marked a
new departure.</p>

<p>It was quite a new thing to find any person of consequence in
Botany Bay openly advocating justice and denouncing wrong.
"Impenetrable Majors," assisted by the hangman and the flogger, had
so cowed and broken the spirit of the community that men scarcely
ventured to whisper their detestation of what they saw around them.
The younger race, born in the colony, had become so inured to the
daily and hourly sights and sounds of the convict system that it
doubtless, in its limited experience, looked on what it saw around
it as nothing more than the natural and proper condition of things.
Under such circumstances it can easily be conceived that the action
of Wentworth and Wardell brought in a tidal wave of new ideas and
popular aspirations that perhaps gave courage to those who
despaired of the future of Botany Bay, and taught those who knew no
better that the condition of things amongst which they lived was a
false and cruel one, and that something better might be won by
fighting for it.</p>

<p>Wentworth was a young Australian, as we have seen, and Wardell a
young English gentleman. Trained and bred among associations of
culture and fine sympathetic influences, it was but natural that
they should have been both sickened and disgusted at the state of
things, which merely to describe leaves such a nasty taste in the
mouth of the writer of Australian history. The task before them
must have appeared a hopeless one, at the best, and it is something
to say of the bull-dog courage of these young fellows that they did
not shrink back from the very first collision with the constituted
authority. How much their perseverance is due to the action of
Judge Forbes it is, of course, hard to estimate now. But it will be
seen from what is to follow in the new chapter of history we are
about to open that to the first Chief Justice is really due the
credit of the first steps that raised the colony from the slough of
officialism and convictism into which it had fallen. Before we
enter on the story of the long constitutional struggle which was
now about to commence, there is one more episode to be dealt with
which will put the positions of both parties in a clear light.</p>

<p>When Governor Brisbane left the colony in December, 1825, he was
succeeded by Lieutenant-General Ralph Darling. His reputation had
preceded him to Botany Bay. When he landed, the crowd of people who
had assembled to see the new Governor clustered silently about the
wharf, and refrained from cheering. Darling entered on his
vice-royalty at once, and from the very first he seems to have
given the populace no reason to repent of the coldness of the
reception they accorded him. During his term of rule he came into
conflict successively with the Chief Justice, with the Press, with
the Patriotic Association and its leaders, and generally with the
people as a whole. He was a man after the Pure Merinos' own heart,
and no man could have been selected by the Home Office at this
juncture whose personality and opinions were better calculated to
harass and exacerbate the public sentiment of the people of the
young colony, or precipitate the free institutions that his irksome
rule was largely instrumental in calling into existence. The chief
sufferers from the tyrannical rule of this "Bashaw," as he was
called, were the unhappy prisoners who laboured in the chain-gangs
of the colony. The soldiers of the regime on service in New South
Wales were almost as badly treated; and it is in connection with
two of these that the following story is told.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch25" id="ch25"></a>Chapter XXV. The Story of
Sudds.</h2>

<p>Every now and then in those days there would be a sound of
martial music and a gleam of scarlet coats along the green lanes of
rural England, and the word would pass round among the yokels that
a party was out recruiting soldiers for the King. Lusty rustics
listened agape while the glib sergeant told his story, and their
hands closed on the bright shilling, and they found the cockade
stuck on their hats before they realised that they had enlisted.
Then the fife shrieked a farewell and the scarlet coats flashed for
a moment in the sun, and in a few moments the green landscape
closed on the recruit, who left village and friends behind him to
follow the drum. Some of these followed it to Botany Bay, where
they shared the barbarities of the convict system.</p>

<p>The story of Sudds and Thompson is one of those that have passed
into circulation in connection with the barbarities of which the
old town of Sydney was the scene. From what has gone before, the
reader will have gathered that atrocities and cruelties were of
common occurrence; and so much was this really the case that
incidents of the kind were regarded in their day as being of so
commonplace a character as to be unworthy of special notice or
record. It is by an accident that we get accounts from time to
time, principally from the recollections of old residents, of
events and occurrences that might well make the blood of the reader
of our dismal story curdle with horror, but which the good people
of the past regarded as things of every day. If we are told
sometimes that our penal laws, and our eagerness to hang and flog
offenders at the present time, show a state of civilisation behind
the world's average, our only excuse is that we have not yet got
away from the past and its barbarism; and so long as we continue to
be ruled by the men of the past and those who have inherited their
traditions, we never shall.</p>

<p>Yet sometimes we find a thrilling incident of peculiar atrocity
standing out from the sanguinary background of our early history,
like the case of Sudds and Thompson. And such a case serves to fill
out the picture the imagination has already coloured from our early
records, while giving it something definite and concrete to go
upon. There are many stories of unhappy wretches condemned to death
for some petty offences, and dragged in procession through the
streets of Sydney, with their coffins beside them in a cart. By a
refinement of cruelty they were made to taste all the horrors of
death and burial before the last brutal exhibition was given on
Gallows Hill. Horrid tales still stand, too, of men who died under
the lash, cursing their tyrants and their own hopeless lot. But
these, we repeat, were common&mdash;so common as to become mere
generalisations. What we have now to tell is a tale of only sixty
years ago; let it stand as a comment on what has gone before.</p>

<p class="b">Page 38</p>

<p>Sudds and Thompson were two private soldiers in the regiment
then stationed in New South Wales. Sudds was a Gloucestershire
rustic, who had left a wife and child in rural England behind him,
when he enlisted like the other louts of those days. The other had
nothing special about his previous history. They came with their
regiment to New South Wales. In those days the merry rule of the
New South Wales Corps was long since over. Under the long-service
army regulations of the period the soldier's term of service left
little of a life-time to spare between youth and age. The contrast
between the lot of the soldier and that of the Emancipist was a
marked one. The convict who had passed through the
Moloch-sacrifice, and whose term of five, seven, or ten years'
service had been manumitted or served, might afterwards use the
advantages the colony offered and acquire a fortune, as many
actually did. Thompson noted this, and he soon made Sudds aware of
the injustice of serving in the ranks until old age came on, while
they saw the convicts they guarded dropping their chains and
gathering wealth and comfort. Tempted by the prospect of domestic'
enjoyment and by the arguments of his companion, he decided that a
convict's sentence and treatment made a fair price to pay for the
prospect of even an Emancipist's liberty. The two soldiers then
deliberately walked into a shop in Sydney, and stole a piece of
cloth in such an open manner as to invite instant arrest. They
quickly cut the cloth into two parts, so that each might be equally
guilty. They were tried, and, of course, convicted; and sentenced
to seven years' transportation to one of the penal settlements.</p>

<p>Here the representative of Majesty came upon the scene. Governor
Darling had no such mawkish scruples about interfering with the
course of "justice" as seems to accompany even the exercise of the
prerogative of mercy in these days. He set aside the sentence of
the Court, and took the offenders out of the hands of the civil
power. He altered the sentence to one of servitude in irons for the
same period on the public roads of the colony&mdash;then to be
returned to service in their regiment. But he did not stop here.
This gross and most unjustifiable interference with the processes
of law after sentence had been formally passed&mdash;this
recondemnation of culprits for the same offence&mdash;was not
vindictive or cruel enough to gratify Governor Darling's diabolical
ingenuity. This ruffian Governor went a step further, and added a
pendant of such wanton brutality as may well make the reader marvel
at such examples of man's inhumanity to man as those of which the
old town of Sydney has been the scene. He ordered the prisoners to
be brought out upon the barrack-square&mdash;now Wynyard-square,
Sydney&mdash;and there, in the presence of their late companions,
to be stripped of their uniforms and dressed in the yellow convict
garb. They were then to be loaded with irons, joined from the
ankles to a spiked iron collar round their necks by a heavy chain.
These spiked collars were a special device of the Governor. They
were, finally, to be drummed out of the regiment, the "Rogues'
March" being played after them with fife and drum as they left the
scene of their degradation&mdash;a miserable spectacle for the
delight of fiends and men.</p>

<p>This unspeakable sentence was carried out to the letter&mdash;or
rather, it would have been so carried out had Nature been as
pitiless as this criminal Governor. "The irons," said Thompson on
examination by the Colonial Secretary and others, five months
afterwards, "consisted of a collar which went round each of our
necks, and chains were fastened to the collar on each side of the
shoulder, and reached from thence to the basil, which was placed
three inches from each ankle. There was a piece of iron which
projected from the collar before and behind, about eight inches at
each place. The projecting irons would not allow me to stretch
myself at full length on my back. I could sleep on my back by
contracting my legs. I could not lie at full length on either side
without contracting my legs. I could not stand upright with the
irons on. The basil of the irons would not slip up my legs, and the
chains were too short to enable me to stand upright. I was never
measured for the irons, and Sudds' collar was too small for his
neck, and the basils for his legs, which were Swollen." The victims
of the old days were many. Their graves yawn black and silent. This
is a voice out from the depths.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/44-page-38.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">Governor Darling's invention.</p>

<p>Thus cruelly manacled, these unhappy wretches were exposed in
the torrid heat of the barrack-yard while this capricious outrage
was perpetrated; and then marched back to the gaol to the sound of
pipe and tabor like figures in some modern <i>Danse Macabre</i>.
Sudds had been ill, and was actually taken out of the hospital to
participate in this grisly exhibition. Let Thompson go on with his
story. "On our return," he says, simply, "Sudds sat down with his
back to the wall, saying that he was very ill, and wished to go to
the hospital again; but he did not go to the hospital till next
morning. The basils of the irons cut his legs during the time we
were coming from the barracks to the jail; it was owing to the
sharpness of the basil and the weight of it that we were cut."
During the horrible night that followed Sudds became worse; his
fellow-sufferer begged a candle, and gave him some tea that he had
bought. "I then asked Sudds if he had any friends to whom he would
wish to write. Be said he had a wife and child in Gloucestershire,
and begged that, if he did not get better by the next night, I
would read some pious book to him, adding that <i>'they had put him
in them irons until they had killed him.'</i>" He lived long enough
to be sent to the Gaol Hospital next morning, and "in talking to
him of his disgrace," says the gaol surgeon, "he declared he would
never work in irons, and wished himself out of the world." He was
removed to the General Hospital two days later, where he died
within twenty-four hours. Thompson merely became insane.</p>

<p>It is not difficult for the most unsympathetic reader to put
himself in imagination in this poor soldier's place&mdash;to see
his wife and child in Gloucestershire&mdash;to feel all his horror
at the awakening from that affecting little dream of domestic
happiness which was to have been so unselfishly
purchased&mdash;with the public disgrace, the iron fetters, and the
spiked collar which he owed to the ingenuity of the
Governor&mdash;and the pathetic request for "a pious book" that
might remind the wretch of the mercy that men denied this misguided
rustic who was thus taken from the hospital to be disgraced, and
die. God knows how many unfortunates had their lives crushed out in
silence under the galling tyranny of those early days, but this is
at least a solitary instance where the victim finds feeble voice,
though it be but the bleat of the calf under the butcher's knife.
There is no element wanting of studied cruelty and ingenious
deviltry to make this instance of old colonial ways stand
prominently out against the background of unrecorded horror. There
are relics of feudal savagery preserved in the Tower of London,
known as the "Scavenger's Daughter," "Little Ease," and other
ingenious appellations, which might rival these devices of torture
of Governor Darling's invention. But enough of this.</p>

<p class="b">Page 39</p>

<p>What did his Excellency the Governor? "However much the event is
to be regretted," wrote he mincingly to Earl Bathurst, on the
subject of Sudds' death, "it cannot be imputed to severity; none
was practised or intended...With respect to the chains, which are
designated as instruments of torture, it will be sufficient to
state that they weigh only 13<i>lb</i>. 12<i>oz</i>.; and, though
made with a view of producing an effect on those who were to
witness the ceremony" his Excellency speaks here with the conscious
but modest pride of an artist in his work&mdash;"the extreme
lightness of their construction prevented their being injurious in
any respect to the individual." No callosity of heartless words
could better paint the character of the man, and the portrait is
not weakened by the fact that this statement of the criminal
Governor cover's a hopeless lie. The chains of Sudds weighed
14<i>lb</i>. 6<i>oz</i>. The usual road-gang irons weighed from
6<i>1b</i>. to 9<i>1b</i>., and those brought out from England on
prison-ships weighed from 3½<i>lb</i>s. to 4<i>1bs</i>. only.
Nothing is said in the reply about the length of the chains, the
effect of the spiked collars, and the basils that cut the flesh of
the suffering wretches who wore them. The author of the outrage
endeavoured to conceal his crime under a lie. A few years ago these
spiked iron collars were kept in the office of the Colonial
Secretary in Sydney, and possibly these disgraceful historical
relics may be preserved there still.</p>

<p>A whirl of indignation went up when the facts of this outrage
were made public. For the first time the popular sentiment had a
chance to express itself. Wentworth and Wardell took up the matter
in the <i>Australian</i>. Wentworth himself published a scorching
pamphlet on the subject, entitled "The Impeachment," in which he
gallantly declared his intention to follow Governor Darling to the
foot of the gallows for his crime. Another paper had in the
meantime been started in 1826, by Mr. Edward Smith Hall&mdash;the
<i>Monitor</i>. The official paper, the <i>Gazette</i>, defended
the outrage; but the public at large and the two popular journals
pursued its author with execrations. Two results followed. One of
these was an enquiry several years later by the English authorities
into the case of Sudds and Thompson, and the other was the conflict
between the newspapers and Governor Darling, which resulted
eventually in the recognition to a certain extent, however limited,
of the freedom of the Press.</p>

<p>The action taken by the public journals struck the Governor
home. The plain truths, so unsparingly repeated, were not palatable
to his Excellency. A weapon was therefore devised to crush the
opposition, quite worthy of the system and of the time, and one
which we have seen revived in our day. The vigorous and outspoken
comments by Dr. Wardell on the late disgraceful event, were the
first to penetrate the official armour, and that gentleman was
promptly prosecuted for criminal libel by the Governor, for "an
attempt to bring the King's representative into hatred and
contempt." It might have been unsafe to have founded a defence on
the plea that the accused had been anticipated by the Governor
himself in this matter. But, though every effort was strained to
secure a conviction, the jury-reform already obtained began to have
its good effect. The jury&mdash;no longer a merely official
one&mdash;disagreed on December 22, 1827, and Dr. Wardell was
discharged on the understanding that this infamous prosecution
would be abandoned. This action was founded on what were known as
the "Gagging Acts" of Governor Darling, of which we will have more
to say presently.</p>

<p>Although the proceedings against Wardell fell through, other
charges were more successful. Mr. Hayes, who had become the editor
of the <i>Australian</i>, was convicted, in April, 1829, of
libelling the Governor in connection with the Sudds case, and was
fined £100 and imprisoned for six months. Hall, the editor of the
<i>Monitor</i>, who had also written in a public-spirited and
outspoken manner on the same subject, was sentenced to twelve
months' imprisonment in September of the same year. Quite an
avalanche of libel-writs descended on this man's drooping head. In
December following, he was convicted again of an old libel on the
Governor, which was revived to form the ground of this charge; two
days later he was convicted of libels on James Laidley, Deputy
Commissary-General, and on F. A. Healy, Convict Superintendent; and
on the day following, of libel on Alexander Macleay, Colonial
Secretary. This rapid record shows the rate at which public opinion
was forming, and the right and custom of public discussion and the
expression of popular opinion, developing. It demonstrated at the
same time the urgent necessity that existed for the letting in of
light on the official procedure of the colony.</p>

<p>It was not till five years after the Sudds tragedy that its
author left Sydney, but that event was not forgotten. He left amid
the execrations of the populace. On his arrival in England, the
enquiry into the case was commenced after an even longer delay than
that into the Bligh affair. Nearly two years after the crime was
committed&mdash;in 1835&mdash;a Committee of the House of Commons
met to review the circumstances under which it occurred. Darling
was befriended by the party in power. The propertied classes in the
colony were his friends to a man, as his rule had favoured their
party and repressed their opponents. Facts were distorted, and
black indictments toned down. One victim was dead, indeed, and the
other had been temporarily insane. But the Pure Merinos had got
over greater difficulties than these. A dead man or a madman more
or less made little difference in Botany Bay in those days. The
result of the enquiry was a foregone conclusion from the first. The
accused was acquitted. As a special mark of royal favour and of the
influence of his friends in the Ministry, he was knighted
immediately after for his chivalry by the King. Had Governor
Darling been well and truly tried before a fearless jury of his
countrymen for his atrocious crime, he would assuredly have been
hanged by the neck.</p>

<h2><a name="ch26" id="ch26"></a>Chapter XXVI. Garotting the
Press.</h2>

<p>There is a fine crusted story told of a certain bold free tyrant
in old days whose innocent delights at the expense of a virtuous
peasantry were sadly interfered with by a tendency on the part of a
meddlesome clutch of prophets who dwelt in caves in the
neighbourhood, to break out into the most rabid spasms of
soothsaying, and other ungentle recreations. The periodical
outbursts of these cataleptic persons set the whole district by the
ears for a time, and the deluded people hatched under their
influence a fleeting kind of public opinion, which is said to have
taken the form of pikestaves and hayforks when the emissaries of
the bold free tyrant swooped down. But he was a thoughtful person,
this oppressor; and when not imagining new wickednesses he could
always put his quivering digits on the springs of these popular
disturbances. He was humane, too, in his capricious way, when not
in the vein for promiscuous slaughter. "Let us hang a few
prophets!" he would say in his light way, and the result was always
the return of the peasantry to a more dutiful frame of mind. He
thus cut off public opinion at its source. His method has always
been very much in favour with rulers who find themselves out of
sympathy with the bent of the popular mind, and when public opinion
is going against them. Only instead of hanging a few prophets the
policy is nowadays to gag the public Press.</p>

<p>This, as we have seen, is what Governor Darling proceeded to try
to do. So long as the official paper, the <i>Gazette</i>, merely
chronicled such of the official acts as would bear the light,
without daring to comment in even the mildest form on the
iniquities and irregularities that went on every day, and which it
is everywhere the duty of the public journal to decry and expose,
the Press, such as it was, went on its way unmolested. But when
public opinion, directed by capable heads and hands, began to
declare itself in a non-official publication, vested interests were
aroused, and a serious danger to good government was at once
discovered. This was striking at the roots of Law and Order, and
undermining the foundations of society. It was necessary to hang a
few prophets, or at least to gag the Press. This was the congenial
task to which Governor Darling addressed himself. When the
prosecutions against Dr. Wardell failed, and the official fangs
were drawn by a properly-constituted jury, the proceedings had been
undertaken under some Acts specially prepared by this respectable
man and his advisers.</p>

<p class="b">Page 40</p>

<p>An infallible sign of an unhealthy state of public business and
of the presence of a suspicious element in things generally, is an
official attempt to stifle public enquiry. As the people look to
the Press for their information as well as for the publication of
their judgment on facts laid before them, the best and shortest
method to render that judgment nugatory is to deprive it of the
knowledge of facts to go upon first, and of public expression
afterwards. Public opinion is nothing without public expression,
and opinion cannot exist if the publication of facts is rendered
hazardous or unreliable. This is what is meant by the liberty of
the Press&mdash;not a claim to any privilege that the public does
not possess, and no special powers or prescriptive rights in any
direction, but simply the liberty to make known what is going on,
and to express a candid judgment such as every individual is at
liberty to form thereon. Wentworth, Wardell, and Hall claimed no
more than this. But this was exactly the liberty of which Governor
Darling was most anxious to deprive them. At this point the old
convict officialdom and the awakening power of public opinion first
came into conflict.</p>

<p>The Governor had already written home to Earl Bathurst, who was
then Secretary of State for the Colonies, complaining bitterly of
the attacks made on him in the public Press. In that communication
the case was put strictly from the official point of view, and from
the names of the first Legislative Council already before the
reader, there will be no difficulty in believing that the
Governor's advisers most cordially concurred with him in his
statement of the case. The result was that a despatch was received
from Earl Bathurst in November, 1826, in which a suggestion was
made to pass some colonial enactments to deal with this vexed
question. On April 25 following, a Bill was prepared and passed by
the Council, "for preventing the mischiefs arising from the
printing and publishing newspapers, and papers of a like nature, by
persons not known, and for regulating the printing and publication
of such papers in other respects, and also for restraining the
abuses arising from the publication of blasphemous and seditious
libels." Transportation was the penalty for a second offence under
this Act. On May 3 another Act was proposed, imposing a duty "upon
all newspapers and papers of a like nature printed to be dispersed
to the public."</p>

<p>It will be remembered that, under the Constitution introduced by
Chief Justice Forbes, that official had the privilege of a vote in
the Council, and after a measure was carried there, it became his
further duty to certify or not to its provisions as he thought fit,
before it became law. Judge Forbes was not at the meeting of the
Council at which this last measure was adopted, and on its
presentation to him for signature he refused his certificate on the
ground of its manifest illegality. The Governor again and again
endeavoured to persuade or intimidate the Chief Justice to give
way, but always without success. A bitter conflict ensued, in which
the Chief Justice nobly espoused the cause of justice and the
popular right, and honoured himself by his public-spirited and
disinterested action. What the Governor failed to do by threats or
persuasion he now attempted by slandering the Judge to the Colonial
Office, but Forbes met and repelled all his charges. "I have been
appointed," he said in one of his letters to the Colonial Office,
"to discharge a sacred duty. I refused to certify the Governor's
Bills, because I thought them repugnant to law, because I felt I
should compromise my oath and my honour if I sanctioned them. What
legal right has the Governor to press me further, or to endeavour
to alarm me into compliance? Does the correspondence which passed
between, us in April and May last, present the calm, the temperate,
the courteous application of one high officer to another...or is it
the mandate of a superior to an inferior, intimating his duty and
warning him of the peril of disobedience? When the three judges of
Bombay were brought to the consideration of the same question they
discussed its merits in open Court and decided against it, in the
heart of the Mahommedan country. I was called upon alone, under the
bondage of secrecy&mdash;I will not pursue the contrast!"</p>

</p>

<p class="caption">News versus noose.</p>

<p>The Chief Justice found himself in conflict, not only with the
Governor, but with the rest of the Legislative Council as well.
When this body was established, partly in deference to the
exertions of Sir James Macintosh and ex-Governor Brisbane, the
intention on the part of the Home Authorities was to give the
population of the colony some share in the Government, which had
hitherto rested in the irresponsible hands of the Governors alone.
The members of Council were nominated by the Crown, and a Governor
like Macquarie, or Brisbane during the last year of his rule, might
have exercised this right of nomination judiciously, and with good
results to the colony at large. No such results were to be expected
from Darling, however, and the first Legislative Council was,
therefore, merely a body composed of Crown officials and
representatives of that Vested Interest class which first blossomed
into being under the shelter of the New South Wales Corps. When we
read of the attempt to stifle discussion at this stage, and to gag
the infant Press, we naturally look for the name of the man in this
connection who has hitherto been always prominent whenever the
Vested Interests he helped to build up had an opportunity to
exercise their influence. And those who look for the name of the
übiquitous John Macarthur in this connection will not be
disappointed. He is such a necessary part of everything that is
sinister in the history of Botany Bay that the episode now under
notice would scarcely be recognisable without him. He was Governor
Darling's most active lieutenant in the Council, and the proposals
to stifle the newspapers in their birth had his most enthusiastic
concurrence. He out-heroded Herod in this matter, and even went
further than the Governor himself; for he actually proposed a
crushing tax of <i>one shilling</i> each on every copy of every
newspaper published in the colony. This was too much even for
Darling's distorted sense of justice. It was a flight of
imagination that required a trained Botany Bay intellect to soar up
to. So the tax was reduced to threepence. Macarthur died during the
term of the next Governor, so that we will meet with him no
more.</p>

<p>Through all this business, it is valuable to note the fact that
every proposal to cripple the advance of the colony either emanated
from, or received the most cordial support of, the Vested Interest
class, as represented in the Legislative Council. Just as it
opposed the introduction of the jury system, so it supported the
attack on the freedom of the Press, and so it will be found
consistently opposing and distorting every manifestation of
progressive public opinion to the end of the chapter. Of such are
the Botany Bay "patriots." It is satisfactory to have to add that
after the correspondence on the newspaper tax had been digested by
the Colonial Office at home, a despatch was at length received
informing the Governor that "the law officers of the Crown have
reported their opinion that in refusing to grant his certificate to
the Act for licensing newspapers, Mr. Forbes correctly executed his
duty, and that the reasons assigned by him for that decision were
valid and sufficient." This despatch was a well-merited rebuff for
the Governor and his myrmidons, and the Gagging Acts fell into
abeyance. But the harassing nature of this conflict between his
sense of duty on the one hand and the Vested Interest class and the
Governor on the other, proved a severe strain on the health of
Chief-Justice Forbes. He paid a visit home, and, strangely enough,
considering the way such honours were usually apportioned, he was
knighted in recognition of his high character and services. He
returned to the colony and died soon after. Sir Francis Forbes was
succeeded by Chief-Justice Dowling.</p>

<p class="b">Page 41</p>

<p>In this way was the process of garotting the Press begun in New
South Wales. The official mind had so accustomed itself to handing
convicts over to the hangman or the flogger for disciplinary
treatment, that it naturally prescribed the same remedy for any
evidence of outspoken criticism, or of public opinion through the
Press. However, the grasp of the law was only partially successful
in its attempt to strangle the freedom of public opinion in its
infantile stages. We have now outgrown the time when the same
measures could be applied by authority. Yet the spirit of the old
convict-system is as active as of old, and without changing its
views on the subject of the liberty of the Press, it has merely
changed its mode of procedure and legal forms.</p>

<p>Before he left, Governor Darling succeeded in making himself
offensive to almost every class in the community. This man was
certainly the most unpopular Governor who ever held rule in New
South Wales. At a dinner given by the Turf Club in December, 1827,
some speeches were made reflecting in the most severe and direct
manner on his administration and on himself. When the Governor's
health was proposed, according to custom, the band played the
significant air of "Over the hills and far away." The insult was
marked, and even Governor Darling could not fail to take it. He
withdrew his patronage from the club, and himself from the colony
in October, 1831. The populace, which received him on his arrival
in silence, hailed his departure with cheers. Some of the more
demonstrative among the lower classes of the population sailed
round the vessel in which Darling and his family had taken their
passage, and these victims of his misrule insulted him with their
taunts there as the vessel lay at anchor. Bonfires blazed along the
shores of the harbour as the ship sailed away. The more reputable
inhabitants were not so actively demonstrative, but the general
feeling at Ralph Darling's departure was one of a profound sense of
gratification and relief.</p>

<p>With the departure of this Governor the second period of the
history of Botany Bay may be said to close. In the first we saw the
foundation of the colony, and its beginnings taking shape. From the
moment that any form was discernible in the inchoate material out
of which the settlement was first fashioned, the squalid tyranny
and oppression of the New South Wales Corps on the one hand and the
hopeless misery of the convict classes on the other were distinctly
apparent. The first 20 years was one chapter of conflict between
the Corps and the Governors, ending in the temporary triumph of the
Corps by the deposition of Bligh. How the victory was used it is
not necessary to repeat. The chief point to be observed is the
foundation of a Vested Interest class. The manner in which that
interest formed and developed requires no further explanation. With
the arrival of Macquarie came the second historical period. The
Corps was drummed out, but the Vested Interests remained. All
through this second period we find them at every turn opposing
first the Governor's progressive policy and then every successive
movement made in the direction of popular development and advance.
Trial by jury, the freedom of the Press, the right of public
opinion, enquiry into the iniquities of the convict system, and
every other essay at progress was consistently opposed by the
Vested Interest class. At the same time there began to appear the
first indications of public intelligence&mdash;two popular
newspapers, the Patriotic Association, and capable and recognised
leaders of the people. In this manner the way was prepared for the
stage that was to follow.</p>

<p>In the third stage of the colony's history we will see the
popular cause taken up by the best Governor who ever held office in
New South Wales. As Macquarie succeeded the misrule of the Corps,
so Bourke succeeded Darling. He taught the people to rely on their
own power, by allowing them to feel their influence under favouring
conditions. He prepared the way in the most direct manner for the
abolition of transportation, and he effected sweeping reforms in
the convict system, pruning it of some of its brutalities, and
stripping it of some of its most repulsive accessories of horror.
From his time onward the process of advance to the granting of
partial and then complete Responsible Government is marked and
regular, until the first elected Parliament was called together in
1856, This will conclude the third part of our story, and will lead
up to the fourth period, which has lasted to the present time.
Every day the indications become stronger that there is a fifth
stage still in reserve, to which this present is but the
antechamber. Perhaps, some day we shall look back to the present
stage of our history with the same historical interest as that with
which we now regard the first, the second, or the third.</p>

<h2><a name="ch27" id="ch27"></a>Chapter XXVII. Governor
Bourke.</h2>

<p>One of the most difficult of the twelve labours of Hercules was
the slaying of the hydra. Whenever the son of Alcmena crushed one
of the seven heads of the reptile of the Lernaean lake, several
others grew in its place. Then he bethought himself of smearing
with pitch the place of the heads as he destroyed them, and soon
the "loathly worm" was discomfited. The task that lay before Sir
Richard Bourke on his arrival was an equally difficult one. If he
did not perform it so thoroughly it was only because his powers
were not Herculean, and because the labour was too great for any
one man. Lieutenant-General Bourke was born in the year the colony
was founded, and had served in the Peninsula, as well as in Holland
and South America. He was Lieutenant-Governor at the Cape for six
years before he came to Botany Bay. Before entering the army he was
educated for the Bar, and it is, perhaps, due to this fact that his
rule in New South Wales was not marked by any of the narrow
obstinacy and usual crassness of the professional soldier. He seems
to have forgotten for the time his drum-head-and-triangle
traditions, if he had ever been influenced by them, and to have set
his face against their perpetuation in the colony. He dealt
liberally with the people, and readily recognised the simple
justice of their demands. He sympathised, too, with their
aspirations after free institutions, and entered into the spirit
which led them to look into the future for the destiny of the
settlement growing up round them. Of course such a Governor as this
was a pre-ordained victim to the Vested Interest class from the
start. But though this class triumphed in the end, it was not until
he had set a force in motion that might be temporarily stayed, but
never finally stopped until its work was done.</p>

<p>One of the most important acts of Governor Bourke's term of rule
was the granting of the complete right of trial by jury. This was
directly due to the Governor himself. We have seen how Judge Forbes
directed the empannelling of the first civil jury in 1824, and how
through the machinations of the obstructive class the reform was
defeated by the fact that the sheriff placed no names of members of
the Emancipist class on his list. The appeal was dismissed on a
technical point, and nothing more was officially heard of the
matter until Bourke opened it up again. During the last years of
Darling's term the Patriotic Association called the people together
on several occasions in public meeting to address the Throne on the
subjects of self-government and trial by jury. The two matters were
taken together. Thus on the anniversary of the foundation of the
colony, in 1827, a meeting was held at the Court House at which
Wentworth spoke in support of a petition proposed for adoption.
"The first topic contained in the petition," he said, "is a request
for trial by jury. A great part of the population is held not
eligible to sit as jurors. We urge that if it were more extended in
the colony its beneficial effects would be most generally known."
Sir James Macintosh presented this petition to the House of
Commons, as already stated. In 1829 an Act of Council established
juries in civil cases, and next year another meeting was held to
prepare a popular petition. In 1831, when news arrived of the
accession of William IV., the usual loyal and characteristically
vapid address of the colonists contained at least one paragraph
that meant something. It was a request that the new King would
extend to the only colony of Great Britain bereft of the rights of
a full participation of the benefits and privileges of the British
Constitution. This was inserted in the petition by an amendment on
the original address.</p>

<p class="b">Page 42</p>

<p>In this manner the way was prepared for some decisive step. The
condition of the lower classes and the masses excited the sympathy
of Governor Bourke from the first. When most of his predecessors
had been either actively tyrannical or passively acquiescent,
Bourke at once made earnest and open efforts to turn the tide. One
by one he scotched the hydra's heads, and he succeeded in all but
completely strangling the convict system. In 1833, the Governor
himself proposed a Bill in the Legislative Council, declaring
Emancipists qualified to serve on criminal juries, provided they
possessed £30 of yearly income, or personal property to the amount
of £300. He referred this measure to the three judges who then held
seats on the Bench&mdash;Forbes, Dowling, and Burton&mdash;for an
opinion as to its legality. They replied to the effect that the
step proposed was in accordance with English law, under which
offenders were allowed to sit as jurors in criminal cases on the
completion of the term of their sentences. The Bill was then
submitted to the Council, and in the absence of two of its
members&mdash;Archdeacon Broughton and Mr. Robert Campbell,
senior&mdash;that body divided equally on the question as to
whether Emancipists were to be allowed to sit as jurors or not. The
Governor had a vote in the Council as a sitting member, and another
casting vote in the event of an equal division. The casting vote of
Governor Bourke, in this instance, turned the scale and introduced
the jury system&mdash;for that is what his action then meant. This
further advance in the direction of popular reform was in a measure
forced on the colony by the Governor, in the teeth of the bitterest
opposition of the Vested Interest class.</p>

<p>Up to this time juries in criminal cases were exclusively
composed of seven naval or military officers, eked out perhaps by
civil officials. Before the Forbes Charter a majority of five
voices in seven was sufficient for a conviction, even in capital
cases. The prosecutor in those more early days pleaded his own
case, the Judge-Advocate framing the indictment and practically
conducting the prosecution; while the accused was always
undefended! The starting-point in Botany Bay criminal jurisprudence
was that everyone was held to be guilty until his innocence was
made clear a few days after he had been hanged. Our enemies say
that this is one of the features of the old system that still
survive in a very slightly modified form.</p>

<p>The difference between the results of criminal cases before and
after the Bourke Jury Law is sufficiently evidenced by a few
figures. To take capital cases alone: 95 persons were hanged out of
the small population on the shores of Sydney Cove in the first six
years after Phillip's landing, but so wild and reckless was the
process of the disposal of human life that no complete return of
those who died on the gallows is available up to 1825. This is an
eloquent blank. We gather from the records and <i>Gazette</i> files
of the time that this laxity was due to the number of executions,
and the indiscriminate and irresponsible manner in which they were
ordered. It was easier to hang a man than to keep a record of the
fact. At the Criminal Sessions in October, 1822, 34 persons were
herded in the dock and sentenced to death&mdash;a noble subject for
an Australian historical picture. During Darling's rule we know
that 184 persons were hanged, and of the busiest year, 1828, no
record has been kept. During the first four years of Bourke's term,
and before the jury law was passed or had time to get into fair
working order, 197 persons perished by the hangman's hands. But by
this time the people had become accustomed to the exercise of the
jury right, and the number of executions fell rapidly away, until
in the year Bourke left the colony only 12 persons were hanged.
During the nine years of which we have record between 1826 to 1839
the public executions averaged nearly one a week. For the nine
subsequent years the average was about one in four months. Yet the
moral tone of the community was higher, and law and order were
daily taking firmer shape. So much for capital punishment as a
deterrent.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/48-page-42.jpg" alt=

</p>

<p class="caption">What Governor Bourke did.</p>

<p>The jury-law reform was bitterly opposed. The class that
monopolised the privilege of serving on juries protested strongly
against the innovation, and unscrupulously attacked it in its
working after it was introduced. The treatment the lower classes of
the population had received was not of the kind to make them the
best citizens or the best jurors, and it was some time before the
actual command of the new privilege familiarised the people with
its use. Those who had the compiling of the lists were careful,
with the view of bringing the new law into greater contempt, to put
thereon the names of Emancipists of notoriously bad character, or
who had been convicted of the most heinous offences. Thus one man
was called who was released on bail, being charged with
cattle-stealing; another, who was under sentence of transportation
for life to Moreton Bay; and a third, who had been hanged a short
time before. The gross clumsiness of these melancholy artifices,
however, defeated their own object, and proved nothing beyond the
fact that if the Emancipists were sometimes unfit to serve as
jurors, they were not more so than the unscrupulous wretches who
resorted to such means to discredit the progress of reform.</p>

<p>The first Act was introduced as an experiment for a period, and
in 1836 a letter was addressed by the Governor to the three Judges,
asking their opinion on the working of the law. Chief Justice
Forbes and Judge Dowling both replied in its favour, and it is not
likely that these two experienced men, with their exceptional
opportunities for studying the working of the system, would have
given such an answer had they not been satisfied of its truth. It
is true that Judge Burton gave an adverse opinion. But this judge
was a conservative of the purest water, and one of his last acts in
the country was to resign his seat as President of the Legislative
Council as a protest against the growing power of the people. The
law was therefore confirmed, and as the enquiry elicited quite
sufficient evidence of the venal character of those who compiled
the jury-lists, and the trickery they resorted to to prove their
case, a circular letter was addressed by the Governor and the Chief
Justice to all the magistrates of the colony, cautioning them to be
careful in the future to see that the discharge of this duty in the
respective districts was not made a means to defeat the law, and
bring it into contempt, by the choice of improper persons.</p>

<p>Dr. Lang, who acquired a repute for popular sympathies that he
only half earned, was a rabid opponent of the jury-bill, as he was
of Wardell and Wentworth, and the Patriotic Association, from the
beginning of their work. He "entirely concurred with Mr. Justice
Burton in his opinion on the measure;" he says in his "History;" he
regarded it as one of the blots on the administration of Bourke,
and said that the Emancipists claimed it because they were "taught
and incited to do so by certain news-writers of their own class and
origin, as well as by certain lawyers of inferior respectability,
who depended chiefly on emancipist and convict practice, and who
willingly pursued the arts of petty agitation to acquire an
importance in society, which they had no other means of attaining."
The venom in this extract is apparent on the surface; the
newswriters and lawyers of inferior respectability being, of
course, Wentworth and Wardell. In this respect the interest of the
worthy Doctor appears to have led him astray. Looking back at the
matter from the standpoint of the present we recognise that,
whatever the objections to the granting of the jury-right may have
been, and whatever the character of the persons who first advocated
or exercised it, the fact remains that it was the first great
instalment of popular right the people of the colony received, and
that the persons who obtained it were the real leaders of
subsequent democratic development. The names of Sir Richard Bourke,
Sir Francis Forbes, Dr. Wardell, and William Wentworth are most
closely connected with this first step towards the free institution
of to-day. This was the crushing of the first of the heads of the
hydra.</p>

<p class="b">Page 43</p>

<p>Another iniquity which Bourke lost no time in minimising was the
Assignment System. Those who favoured Darling's rule wrote of that
Governor that "under him the anti-convict system was introduced,
and a commencement of real penal discipline made, amidst great
outcry...He introduced and strengthened the laws for the management
of the felon population, and...discipline was maintained with a
firm hand." Lang says that his subordinate agents treated the
convicts with great severity under his direction, "and with a
reckless indifference to their feelings as men which their
situation as criminals never would have warranted." The gaolers and
overseers took their tone from their chief, of course. Darling
established an Assignment Board which effectually controlled the
appointment of white labour. So well was the work done that any
person ill-affected towards the person or the acts of the Governor
stood little or no chance of having his request for assigned
servants attended to. All this Bourke resolved to correct, as soon
as he realised the state of things into the midst of which he had
been precipitated. He determined to introduce a more humane spirit
into the convict system itself, and to new-model the Assignment
system. He therefore framed a code of regulations for the latter
purpose, under which the number of assigned convict servants was to
be proportioned to the land held and under cultivation by the
applicant. But even this reform called forth a howl of execration
from the slave-masters. It throws a strong light on the condition
of the time when we find that some of these people complained of
the new assignment regulations because they permitted no more than
70 convicts to any one person. It was no uncommon thing to see
these wretches placed in batches of 50 and 60 at the practically
irresponsible mercy of avaricious ruffians who knew of no other
method of suasion than that of the flogger or the iron-gang.</p>

<p>But one of the very first acts of the Governor, as soon as he
saw the kind of people he had to deal with, was one that raised him
a plentiful crop of enemies. Stories of the cruelties of masters
towards their servants, encouraged under Darling's sanguinary rule,
reached his ears nearly every day. One most atrocious instance
occurred in 1834. Six men were charged with taking part in a mutiny
of assigned servants on the estate of Major Mudie&mdash;the person
who afterwards wrote the scurrilous lampoon called the "Felonry of
New South Wales." This man had a particularly bad reputation for
his treatment of assigned servants, and in the present instance the
six men did not deny their part in the mutiny, but "persisted in
the statement that they had been goaded on to their crime by the
tyranny and ill-treatment which they had been subject to on the
station." Five of the men were hanged&mdash;to encourage the
others, probably. Their statements made such an impression,
however, that a Commission was appointed to enquire into the
treatment of the white labour on Major Mudie's
property&mdash;"Castle Forbes" was what this aspiring creature
called his estate&mdash;and enough was elicited to lead the
Governor to strike his name off the Commission of the Peace. These
and other similar instances determined the Governor to do something
for the wretches who could only call attention to their miseries at
the risk of the gallows. He found on enquiry that magistrates
sentenced each other's assigned servants to indescribable tortures
with the lash on the smallest provocation, and without other rule
or system than their own cruel caprice. He therefore proposed to
the Council a measure which became known as the Magistrates' Act,
limiting the sentences which magistrates had power to inflict to 50
lashes for each offence. Some idea of the nature of the sentences
complained of may be gathered from the liberal nature of this
limit. Fifty lashes to-day would be regarded as barbarism and
savage torture; then, such limit to the powers of petty magistrates
was looked upon as a piece of capricious interference on the part
of the Governor, and mawkish and ill-judged lenity. The measure was
passed, after bitter opposition, and the hydra of convictism
received another crushing blow.</p>

<p>The year after the right of trial by jury was won witnessed the
untimely death of Dr. Wardell. That public-spirited man, whose
talents were as great as his popular sympathies were progressive
and wide, and to whose memory Australia must always owe an
inextinguishable public debt, was murdered near his own home on the
Parramatta Road on September 7, 1834. Some bushrangers waylaid him,
and he called upon them to surrender. They failed to recognise him,
and one of them shot him dead. The assassins, when they knew their
victim, had the grace to cover the body with branches to protect it
from the native dogs. A boy who was one of the number gave
information, and the two others were arrested and executed. In Dr.
Wardell's death the colony lost an invaluable public servant, in
the highest sense of the word. The man whose name was so closely
connected with his up to this stage lost a guide and friend, and a
contrast between his previous and his subsequent career bears
evidence of the value of the influence at so untimely an hour
withdrawn.</p>

<h2><a name="ch28" id="ch28"></a>Chapter XXVIII. How the Convict
System Worked.</h2>

<p>If we can conceive of a writer in cold blood addressing himself
to the compilation of a collection of tales of horror drawn from
all sources, it is not difficult to set down a list of the places
from which he might draw the materials for his gruesome and grisly
task. There are the tales of the slave-trade in the Spanish
settlements and in the Southern States of America and on the Guinea
coast; the early excesses of the French Revolution; the felonry of
Siberia; and the oubliettes and iron cages of the feudal ages. Any
of these will give the most avaricious sensationalist whatever he
may reasonably require, but for Australians there will never be any
necessity to go outside their own borders, or beyond the limits of
their own brief history. It would indeed be strange if a Governor
had not at length arrived to find the state of things he was called
to rule too much for his commonest instincts of humanity.</p>

<p>To get a clear view of the merit of Bourke's action, it is
necessary to look at things for a moment as he saw them. The tales
of convict life at this time had lost nothing in cruelty while
events were progressing so far. The period of Darling's and
Bourke's rule is fruitful in an abundant crop of harrowing stories.
There is one told by an eye-witness which is so graphic and
realistic that we cannot do better than repeat it almost in his own
words. He was sent for one day to Bathurst Courthouse, he says, to
identify a man who was supposed to have been driven by cruel
treatment into the bush from the farm of which the person quoted
was one of the overseers. On his way into court he had to pass the
triangles, where the floggers had been busy wielding the lash
incessantly for hours.</p>

<p>"I saw a man," he says, "walk across the yard with the blood
that had run from his lacerated flesh squashing out of his shoes at
every step he took. A dog was licking the blood off the triangles,
and the ants were carrying away great pieces of human flesh that
the lash had scattered about the ground. The scourger's foot had
worn a deep hole in the ground by the violence with which he
whirled himself round on it to strike the quivering and wealed
back, out of which stuck the sinews, white, ragged, and swollen.
The infliction was 100 lashes, at about half-minute time, so as to
extend the punishment through nearly an hour. The day was hot
enough to overcome a man merely standing that length of time in the
sun, and this was going on in the full blaze of it. However, they
had a pair of scourgers who gave each other spell and spell about,
and they were bespattered with blood like a couple of
butchers."</p>

<p class="b">Page 44</p>

<p>The photographic eye of this witness has struck off a picture
that may stand at the head of our imaginary writer's grisly
collection. The idle triangles, and the dog that, like those in the
story of Jezebel, licks up the new spilled blood; the "man" who has
been tortured, with the blood "squashing" out of his boots as he
walks away; the sinews standing out from his back, white and ragged
and swollen; and the tell-tale mark of the scourger's
foot&mdash;here we have all the elements of a picture that should
be painted and hung on the walls of every Australian gallery of art
as a popular educator and an historical and political lesson. There
is a passage in one of Thackeray's books which speaks of the
reading of certain old familiar tales, the delight of "sweet girls
and their gentle mothers" who have followed the adventures of the
hero and wept and smiled with the heroine from one generation to
another. But who will dare to tell the story of social life in
Australia in a candid way for girls and gentlewomen to read, when
it is made up of chapters such as this? Yet all this time, while
every court-yard witnessed such horrors, sweet girls and their
gentle mothers were the daughters and wives of the men who
sanctioned and ordered these atrocities that had place every day
under women's and children's unpitying eyes.</p>

<p>"The fact is," says the same speaker, "that such a sight is so
common in this country that no one thinks anything of it. I have
seen young children practising flogging on a tree, as children in
England play at horses."</p>

<p>That was the way the system worked. People grew accustomed to
what they daily saw around them, as we are accustomed to the idea
of a man being strangled by process of law. Children grew up to
look upon what they saw as the natural and proper state of things.
The children of 50 and 40 years ago are the decaying generation of
to-day. It is only natural and logical, therefore, and in no wise
strange and wonderful, that so many of the old convict-period
traditions and spirit survive amongst us still.</p>

<p>These remarks quoted were published in a certain magazine called
"Meliora," in 1861. From the article we take also the following
little instance. It was a common thing&mdash;and nothing shows more
clearly the relentless barbarity of the men who administered the
law and exacted the last pound of flesh the brutal regulations
permitted&mdash;to call the same act by as many as five different
names in the charge, and for five separate and distinct sentences
to be passed on the accused for that one act. One instance given is
that of a convict servant of a certain magistrate. This man had
been given a glass or two of spirits by a travelling hawker. His
master's son, an ill-conditioned Australian lad of the period and
formed under the system, began to curse and threaten the servant.
The man retorted. A constable was at once sent for, and the
convict, realising his position and driven mad with terror, knocked
him down and escaped into the bush. On his way he rushed into his
own hut and took with him, as his only provision, three-fourths of
a damper he had by him ready baked. He was captured presently, as a
matter of course. The young slave-master prosecuted him for
drunkenness, insolence, theft (for the piece of damper was regarded
as the master's property until it was consumed), and bushranging.
Then the magistrates made the constable prove the assault. From the
spirited proceedings of the young man in this matter, and his
ingenuity in proving the charge of theft, we may argue that he was
a particularly apt pupil of his parents and guardians and a
promising property-holder in the future.</p>

<p>This convict's story is worth following a stage or two further.
He was sentenced to 25 lashes for drunkenness, 25 for insolence, 50
for bushranging, six months in an iron-gang for stealing the piece
of damper, and three months for assaulting a police-officer in the
execution of his duty. He got the lashes and joined the chain-gang,
accordingly. While there he committed some trifling offence, real
or imaginary, for which he was sentenced to receive more lashes.
But he had a regardful memory of his previous experience in this
direction, so he declined this further attention, and again
succeeded in decamping into the bush. Here he found some
bushrangers this time, for his previous experience had rather
disgusted him of any closer acquaintance with the law. The
bushrangers carried arms, and he assisted in several robberies with
them. He was taken with arms in his hands after a time, and
adroitly hanged up by the neck. He expired in that picturesque
attitude.</p>

<p>"The man was a quiet, hard-working, honest fellow," we are told,
"but he would not stand flogging and he was fond of liquor. The
crime he was sent here for he had committed when drunk, and it was
perhaps the only one he had to answer for. That man was murdered;
and so hundreds upon hundreds have been, and are being, every year
in this cursed country." The speaker was a labour-overseer,
remember, and was speaking of what he saw and knew.</p>

<p>"Great tyranny was exercised even at the seat of government; but
in the thickly-populated districts public opinion in some degree
shielded the convict from the extremity of oppression." It is no
matter of wonder, then, that the Vested Interest party howled down
any attempt to express public opinion by free speech or by a free
Press. The cruelty in Sydney, though bad enough, sank to a trifle
when compared with the cruelty perpetrated up the country. But the
system was the same, whatever its modifications might be. As
instances of this, there are cases like the following:</p>

<p>"Here is an offence called by three different names, three
several charges are made upon it, three several trials, three
several sentences, and three several punishments following. A man
gets drunk, has his clothes stolen, and is afraid to go home to his
master. He is tried first for drunkenness, a second time for making
away with his clothing, and a third time for absconding. His
sentence is in sum total 100 lashes, which, with the
cat-o'-nine-tails, is really 900 lashes."</p>

<p>There is a man mentioned here who received 2600 lashes in five
years, and another who received 1200 lashes in 12 months. The
planet had little in the way of real enjoyment to offer these
wretches after this.</p>

<p>These instances will indicate what Bourke found on his arrival.
The Act for restraining magistrates from ordering more than 50
lashes to convict servants was imperatively called for in the
circumstances. Yet that Vested Interest class which was largely
formed now of landed proprietors was, as usual, loud in its
opposition. These people clamoured loudly against their deprivation
of unlimited power, alleging that it was necessary to keep the
convict element in check, and to get fair work out of their white
labour. They threatened the colony with impending anarchy and
destruction, and a general rising on the part of the convict
population. Then they set to work to prepare petitions which were
signed by many magistrates and landed proprietors, and sent to
England, urging on the Home Authorities the necessity that existed
for their being granted increased power to flog and torture the
unfortunates who had been placed at their mercy by some cruelly
whimsical caprice of fate. Their action in this matter is
significant of their whole attitude when there was any question of
progress or reform. Lang, whose honesty is often stronger than his
prejudices, states the position neatly enough:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was not civil and religious liberty&mdash;that pearl of
inestimable price in the eyes of our forefathers in the early days
of emigration to America&mdash;for which these Australian worthies
petitioned; it was for a somewhat different species of liberty, the
liberty to lash; and long and deep were the groans they uttered
through their favourite organ when they found it denied them."</p>

<p>For the same reason Bourke reformed the assignment system, and
curtailed materially the amount of white labour any one proprietor
was allowed to own. The very fact that under the new regulations 70
was the maximum throws light on the state of things existing in
connection with convict assignment. This measure, with the jury law
reform and the Magistrates' Act just referred to, made Bourke
extremely unpopular with the Vested Interest class. The persons who
formed that class maintained that their labour and their services
had opened up the country, and developed its pastoral and
agricultural resources. Their capital, they said, had made the
colony what it was. They claimed that they were the only persons
entitled to consideration in any measure of Government that might
be proposed, for on them the prosperity of the country rested, and
if they were driven out the colony might relapse into primitive
barbarism. Their expenditure of capital and their labour in the
past, they said, gave them a Vested Interest in the state of things
under which they had done their work and laid out their capital.
They therefore objected strongly on the strictest grounds of equity
and justice to any newfangled notions the Governor might introduce,
or to any interference with their undoubted rights and privileges.
This was the case for the Vested Interest party.</p>

<p class="b">Page 45</p>

<p>But the popular instinct, led by the Patriotic Association,
regarded the question from another point of view. In the first
place, no rational man could look on unmoved from day to day at the
saturnalia of cruelty going on around him unless his disgust was
allayed by a Vested Interest in the state of things that produced
these miseries. To the popular mind these Vested Interests were the
bonds and props that kept the fabric of the convict-system
together. Just as the walls of the great cotton warehouses of
Liverpool were once said to be cemented by negro blood, so might
the colonial fabric be said to be built up by the bodies of convict
men and women, and cemented with their blood. Looking back at the
way in which the foundations of these Vested Interests were
laid&mdash;as the process has already been described in these
pages&mdash;the popular mind realised that from the very outset the
great proprietorial fortunes of the colony had been begun in fraud
and spoliation, and perpetuated in oppression and cruelty. It was
clear from every incident in Botany Bay history up to this, that
the Interests thus formed had nothing in common with the future of
the colony or its ambition in the direction of progress. As for the
capital the proprietors had expended, with the exception of that
brought by later arrivals everyone knew how <i>that</i> was
acquired. And as for their expenditure of work and energy, it was
well enough known that the opening up of the country was due to the
white labour of the iron-gangs and the herds of assigned
convict-workmen, toiling like negro slaves in Georgia or Virginia,
under the convict whips of their relentless and greedy masters.
Such was the aspect of affairs from the popular point of view.</p>

<p>All the efforts of Sir Richard Bourke to sweep away the
barbarism of the time and to reconcile these two views in some
degree, only demonstrated the utter futility of any labour of the
kind while the practice of transportation continued. Sir Richard
saw what the future of the colony might become, and the
impossibility of its realisation so long as the Convict System was
perpetuated. There was but one remedy for what he saw around him on
every side, and that was the cessation of transportation
altogether. He sent a dispatch to this effect to the Secretary for
the Colonies, and the first step was taken in earnest at last.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch29" id="ch29"></a>Chapter XXIX. An Apologist for
Vested Interests.</h2>

<p>Long before this the Vested Interest class had recognised Bourke
for an enemy. He had made a friend of Wentworth, who was a frequent
guest at the Governor's table, and his private words and public
acts showed the exclusionists that their interests were in danger
at his hands. They therefore revived all those agencies of attack
which they and their predecessors had brought to bear so often
before on previous Governors&mdash;the anonymous letter, the
scurrilous lampoon, the private slander, the public charges to the
Colonial Office, and all those miserable adjuncts of the art they
had been at such persistent pains to cultivate. It is unnecessary
to pursue the ramifications of this business, and the purpose of
this paper will be as well served by one case as by fifty. We will
select a typical one; and nothing we know of more clearly shows the
character of the people who opposed Bourke than the book called
"The Felonry of New South Wales," by Major Mudie, before alluded
to.</p>

<p>We have seen how this man so cruelly ill-treated his convicts
that some of them broke out into open mutiny as their only chance
of escape from this chartered ruffian. Five of these men, it will
be remembered, were hanged for their part in this mutiny, and the
Governor was so struck by the state of things disclosed at the
enquiry that he removed Major Mudie from the Commission of the
Peace. This mild punishment appears to have excoriated the Major's
tender sensibilities to such a degree that he became one of
Bourke's bitterest opponents in his own small way, and the book
just named is the result. Major Mudie became the mouthpiece of the
class to which he belonged, and of which he was such a worthy
member. The object of this vile production was, in his own words,
to "arraign at the bar of public opinion the conduct of the
Governor, and that of several of his functionaries in the
government of New South Wales, and particularly as regards his and
their spirit of favouritism towards the convicts&mdash;it may even
be politically said, criminal collusion with convicts." From this
extract it will be seen that the gallant Major was readier with the
lash than the pen, but of course something must be allowed for
continual practice. Then the story goes on.</p>

<p>Under the influence of pernicious principles respecting popular
rights and popular institutions, he continues, Bourke easily fell
into the hands of Judge Forbes and Mr. Wentworth, and other
politically dangerous men in the community. Of these "the most
dangerous, both from his position and his insidiousness, was the
Chief Justice. A Bermudan by birth and educated in an American
college, Mr. Chief Justice Forbes is a known Republican...From the
first he assumed and performed the part of the protector of the
felonry." This was the verdict of the class Major Mudie represented
on the character of our first Chief Justice, and the man who
introduced the beginning of Constitutional Government. Careful as
they always professed themselves to be of the interests of law and
order, when these terms meant the preservation of their own power,
they were unscrupulous enemies of both order and law and those who
were appointed to preserve it under what they called "felonial"
government. When Wentworth was appointed a magistrate the cup of
their bitterness was filled to overflowing. His policy was
described as one of "eagerness to gain popularity by hollow
pretence to convictism and emancipitism," and, says the injured
Major, "he had taken a part in colonial politics so violent and
peculiar, besides that there were other circumstances regarding him
to which it is not necessary to advert, he was the very last free
man in the colony who should have been placed on the Commission of
the Peace. It gave to this hot-brained and intemperate political
partisan a right to interfere still more than he had done in the
affairs of the colony, and particularly with the proceedings of the
magistracy." This extract will throw some light on the subsequent
career of Wentworth.</p>

<p>"One of the many grave charges against Sir Richard Bourke," says
the Major again with the utmost seriousness, "is that he has
exhibited an undue, an unwise, an impolitic and a dangerous
leniency towards the convict population of the colony, and that he
has not only manifested this disgraceful propensity in the acts of
his Government, but that he has taken into his special grace and
favour the well-known apologists and advocates of the convicts,
while he has averted his countenance from the disciplinarians who
have presumed to oppose his frantic experiments, or to remonstrate
against the lax and demoralising tendency of his system." This good
Major is clearly one of those people who have been counselled not
to play with edged tools. A pen in this man's hand is as dangerous
to the class of which he is the mouthpiece as a petard or a
torpedo. In this extract, this disciplinarian whose men were glad
to escape him even through the trap-door of a gallows admits the
whole case against the Vested Interest class, and throws away the
mask. No man was better qualified to speak on behalf of the
disciplinarians than this writer. Before the mutiny on his estate
occurred a story was told in which he figured rather unpleasantly,
and which perhaps had a great deal to do with what happened
afterwards. One of his assigned servants took to the bush, and
travelled on foot one hundred and forty miles, presented himself at
Government House, and complained of the outrageous tyranny and
oppression of his master, Major Mudie. The Governor's son and
private secretary saw the runaway, heard his story, comforted and
advised him, and sent him back to his master with a letter, begging
that the unfortunate man might not be too severely visited for his
error in taking to the bush to lay his case in person before the
authorities. It is Major Mudie himself who tells the story, and he
unblushingly adds the sequel. He charges the Governor's son in his
book with unlawfully and criminally harbouring a bushranger, and
immediately on the return of the man he handed him over to a bench
of his neighbour magistrates, who promptly sentenced him to labour
in the chain-gang as a bushranger&mdash;"in conformity with law,"
adds the Major. There were at that time one hundred free and
convict labourers on Mudie's estate, and it may easily be believed
that the unlucky result of this man's application for help from the
authorities, and their master's action in the matter, precipitated
the mutiny that followed.</p>

<p class="b">Page 46</p>

<p>It would be tedious to follow this writer in his defence of the
class of which he was such a worthy member. His book is nothing
more or less than a foul collection of villainous charges against
Bourke and those of his officials who assisted him in drawing the
fangs of the propertied classes. Some filthy stories about the
private lives of successful Emancipists have been carefully
garnered up, and Major Mudie devoted his congenial talents to the
collection of all the incidents of this kind that delighted his
delicate fancy. Utter unscrupulousness and literary larrikinism are
evidenced in every page; but the result of the whole is merely to
place the class he spoke for in a worse light, if possible, than
before. Of course the Governor was the chief mark for his slanders,
and the very line of attack his scurrilous assailant takes is,
perhaps, Bourke's best apology. After explaining with approval how
Governor Darling prohibited the convicts from directly addressing
themselves to the Government on any pretence, and confined them to
making their complaints or applications to the nearest bench of
magistrates, he charges Bourke with the flagrant crime of
encouraging "the correspondence of convicts with himself and his
functionaries, receiving the secret accusations of any of the
ruffians of the colony against their masters, and even comforting
and advising runaways who repaired to him for consolation."</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/52-page-46.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">Survival of the fittest.</p>

<p>The good faith of this accusation and its maker may be judged
from the fact that the complaints of convicts were usually against
the cruelty of their masters. It has been already explained that
the magistrates were the convict-masters, and were in the habit of
obliging each other by the torture of the assigned servants brought
before them. This was a reciprocal favour; the magistrate who
sentenced his friend's servant to the lash to-day might ask a
similar favour from the friend the day after, or even the same day.
It was a pleasant system, based on the polished amenities and
graceful sense of the duty of mutual obligation which is the
invisible bond of all polite society, and it is much to the credit
of Governor Darling's proper taste that he recognised this feature
in the higher circle of colonial life, and paid its members the
delicate attention to which Major Mudie so appreciativly refers.
was no coarse and brutal interference with vested rights on
Darling's part, therefore, when he commanded that if a convict had
any complaint against his master he should make it known to his
master's friend. Botany Bay etiquette required this. It was
nothing, of course, to the convict that any chance of redress was
denied him, for he had no vested rights except in the lash, and he
could not be expected to appreciate the amenities of polite
society. But Bourke had the excessively bad taste to listen to
complaints that reached him, and even to encourage the oppressed to
make their condition known. Worse than that, he actually
endeavoured to extend to these miserables a certain measure of
protection and redress.</p>

<p>Major Mudie was righteously indignant, therefore, at these
horrible solecisms.</p>

<p>"So high-minded, indeed, under this childishly-foolish system
have the felon population become," he says, "that convicts are
quite indignant at being called convicts, and insolently deny the
right of anyone to treat them with disrespect."</p>

<p>This was another attempt to deny to the Vested Interest class
one of its most cherished privileges, but Major Mudie was not the
man to endure this kind of thing without a murmur. He would not
submit, he says, "either to their folly or caprices, or to their
insolence or their tyranny." He "not only kept his convicts in
their proper place and at their proper distance, and compelled them
to wear the regular convict dress, but he had the dress of each
branded with a number and with his own name as the assignee
master." What with that which the disciplinarian Major has told us
of his treatment of his white labour, and what he omitted to tell
but which has come to us from other and perhaps more reliable
sources, we get quite a pleasant picture of slave-life on the
estate of "Castle Forbes." When the assigned servants mutinied,
they endeavoured to express to him their deep sense of the trouble
he had taken in their interests, and had the Major not been so
exceedingly deft at running away he would certainly have had no
cause to complain of their ingratitude. They took possession of his
house while he was away, and though they refrained from
assassinating its mistress, they pillaged the place of what arms,
ammunition, and food they could, and took to the road in search of
their master.</p>

<p>They found that good man, and were pleasantly preparing to flog
him to death with his own cat-o'-nine-tails, when he jumped into
the river and escaped amid a shower of shot and curses. One is apt
to experience a tender regret here that these clumsy convicts did
not give him some lashes&mdash;just a few&mdash;before his modest
diffidence led him to decline that testimonial. We scarcely know
where to bestow our astonishment&mdash;on the strange revulsion of
feeling which led the Major to condemn the use of the lash in this
single instance, or on the <i>gaucherie</i> of the uncultivated
Boeotians who allowed him to make his escape.</p>

<p class="b">Page 47</p>

<p>The moral obliquity which would make the state of things
existing under the assignment system decently tolerable is almost
incredible at even this short distance of time. But the records of
actual occurrences set down by one who believed and was an active
agent in that system put the circumstances of the time out of the
region of incertitude. This is the value&mdash;and the only
value&mdash;of Major Mudie's slanderous book. The only touch of
colour wanting to what has been already described will be found
perhaps in the fact that the souls and bodies of convict men and
women were committed to the irresponsible care of men like one
whose character and personality are candidly painted by himself in
his own shameless book. It is almost impossible to doubt that the
man was sincere&mdash;that he believed as emphatically as the men
who approve and administer the penal laws of to-day, in the justice
of the system of which he formed a part. The hypocrisy which would
allow a man to write as this man has written if he did not hold the
views he sets forth would be too fiendish or too melodramatic to
pass ordinary criticism. And the fact that the lives of men and
women were at the mercy of such merely mechanical instruments of
torture as this man describes himself to be only goes to prove the
worst that has been said about the convict system.</p>

<p>"The scorching glow of conscious shame&mdash;and the groan of
the convict's agony&mdash;are more appropriate," wrote the Major
referring to Bourke and his officials, "to the feelings of men thus
indelibly stamped with the guilt of public delinquency, and held up
to derision, contempt, and scorn for their mental incapacity and
folly. "</p>

<p>This fantastic sentence reads almost like the words of a man who
really believes in what he says.</p>

<p>The Governor could not take any notice of the slanders in this
book, but it was just as well, perhaps, that the gallant Major
slandered someone who could give him his attention, and from whom
it would seem that sturdy disciplinarian could not run away. Most
of Major Mudie's libels were perpetrated on safe men&mdash;on men
who had been hanged, for instance, or on the Governor who could not
reply, or on officials who were advanced in years. But in one of
his slanders Major Mudie caught a Tartar. Mr. Kinchela, afterwards
Judge, held office as Attorney-General in his time. That gentleman
had displayed a certain amount of humanity in the discharge of the
duties of his office&mdash;was, perhaps, concerned in the enquiry
into the "Castle Forbes" mutiny. Major Mudie referred to him in his
book in these terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Deficient in legal knowledge, he has not even the address or
manners, or the language of a gentleman. His utterance is bad, and
strongly tinctured with the brogue of Kilkenny; and, to crown the
whole, he is excessively deaf&mdash;a defect necessarily subjecting
him to the most mischievous or the most ludicrous mistakes."</p>

<p>The Attorney-General could not resent this scurrilous
blackguardism. But he had a son. The young fellow interviewed Major
Mudie with a horsewhip. He had talked the matter over with his
friends, and they decided that something like fifty lashes would
about meet the Major's case. So the young man stepped airily up to
that gallant and high-spirited officer one day, and with cool
precision proceeded to carry out the sentence. There was no river
for the Major to jump into this time, and he could not run away. So
he had to take his punishment with the best grace he had, and
content himself with the usual threats of redress in the courts of
law. He took his case into court, and as there was no denying
either the assault or the events that led up to it, young Kinchela
was mulct in the sum of £50, being at the rate of £1 for every
stroke of the whip. The young fellow paid the money with pleasure,
and expressed an opinion that the entertainment was a very cheap
one at the price.</p>

<p>Enough of Major Mudie. He and his book have served their
purpose, and that brave man himself has gone to his own
place&mdash;a place, perhaps, where he will have no reason to
complain of the severity of the penal discipline. We have used him
and his book to throw light on the character of the class to which
he belonged, and on the nature of their opposition to Bourke and
his policy. What has been said in this and the preceding paper will
give the reader an idea of what the work of reform really meant.
One cannot fail to be struck at the similarity of the things
described to that which existed under the New South Wales Corps in
the first years of settlement. There was the same division of
classes and the same cruelty and oppression on one side, and
suffering and despair on the other. Major Mudie is the legitimate
successor of Captain Macarthur, and the seed that pioneer sowed had
by this time brought forth a plentiful harvest crop after its kind.
The settlement had now been in existence for nearly 50 years, and
the only mark of development or progress yet shown so far as
administrative detail was concerned, was that mentioned above. The
scene described as having taken place in the Bathurst Courthouse
may be read side by side with another, elsewhere treated, which
occurred at Parramatta at the beginning of the century. On that
occasion two floggers set to work on the victim at once, so that
the torture was comparatively short. This was a crude and unrefined
method, with no element of the artistic about it. But on this last
occasion the executioners relieved each other, and the lashes were
given at half-minute time, so that the suffering wretch might miss
no twinge or throb of his torture. This was progress, indeed. It
was one of those thoughtful attentions which had their origin in
that more polished society of the "colonial aristocracy" into which
the ruder conditions of the New South Wales Corps had been
translated. It would be pleasant to speculate as to the further
results in the way of refinement of cruelty these ingenious
wretches would have devised had Bourke not prematurely crushed the
whole system out of existence altogether.</p>

<h2><a name="ch30" id="ch30"></a>Chapter XXX. Under the
Microscope.</h2>

<p>If these things moved Bourke to vigorous action, how much more
may they not be supposed to have goaded men like Wentworth and
Wardell, and the Patriotic Association they led? The case of
Wentworth was a singular one. Born at Norfolk Island, the very
hot-bed and centre of all that was horrible in the convict-system,
he went home at a sufficiently early age to leave his mind open to
other impressions. His character was formed on something that
differed widely from Botany Bay models, by the time he returned to
Australia in the company of the man who influenced his future
action so nobly. These men personify for us the intelligent
patriotic sentiment of the time. They saw with a more sympathetic
eye than Bourke the details of the working of the convict-system.
Occupying no official position they were in a measure identified
with the colony and its larger interests, as distinguishable from
the Vested Interests against which they unrestingly fought. The
terrible social results of the convict rule were always before
their eyes, and they saw shipload after shipload of rustic
transportees discharged from prison-ships at Circular Quay, to be
dragooned and tortured into hopeless criminals and duly fitted and
trained for their end&mdash;the gallows. Instances might be
multiplied indefinitely to show how surely and fatally the system
worked to transform the raw import into the finished article. It
will not be necessary to go into detail to demonstrate this,
however, and we will be content in this case, as in others, to
select a typical case and let it stand as representative of
all.</p>

<p>Quite a large proportion of those who were sent out to Australia
in prison-ships were convicted of poaching. From the time of
William the Conqueror, when men's eyes were put out for killing a
hart, the game-laws have always been among the most priceless
treasures of British criminal jurisprudence. The young man who shot
a hare or a partridge was sent to Botany Bay in the same ship with
the murderer or the habitual criminal. A love for sport and a
borrowed gun have sent more good colonists to New South Wales than
any other impelling power save the goldfields. We have now before
us the police history of one of those juvenile poachers, drawn up
in the Convict Superintendent's office for some purpose of which we
have no present indication, in 1851. The name at the head of this
faded document is "Hugh Doogan," and it appears from the record
that he was convicted in Dublin, 1838, of snaring pheasants, and
sentenced to transportation beyond the seas for a term of seven
years. God knows what history of domestic woe is summarised in
these three or four official lines, but that there was something of
the kind we may be certain, for the lad was only eighteen years of
age. Like thousands more he was huddled below deck out of sight,
and floated away in due course into what he and the thousands like
him doubtless regarded as the veritable under-world. He arrived in
1839, took his place among the working-convicts, and proceeded to
exemplify the working of the system in his own microscopic way. It
may be here remarked as a singular circumstance amply borne out by
facts and figures that these young Irish convicts, sent out for
petty offences, formed the class out of which the convict-system
produced its worst and most characteristic results. It is
well-known that the nationality of these men subjected them to a
great deal of harsh treatment, and their own impulsive temperament
seems to have added whatever was necessary to make them promising
raw material for the operation of such a system.</p>

<p class="b">Page 48</p>

<p>This Hugh Doogan was in the colony just nine months&mdash;about
long enough, we may suppose, to give his fetters time to
bite&mdash;when we find him, by this record, sentenced to 36 lashes
for being absent without leave. After this first step the descent
to hell was easy. Six months later we find him sentenced to 50
lashes for disorderly conduct, and 12 months after that to 50
lashes for neglect of work. Six months later he was locked up in
the cells for 14 days for drunkenness, and as this treatment does
not appear to have recommended itself to his capricious approval,
we find him absconding as soon as he got out of his exquisite
little cell. He was captured and sent to the treadmill for two
months, and six months after he finished his arduous labours in
that capacity he achieved six months in irons for drunkenness and
assault. Six months after his release again&mdash;the insect we
have now under the lens seems to have generally kept within bounds
for six months at a time&mdash;he was sent to Cockatoo Island for
the remainder of his sentence. There is no reason given in the
record before us for this step, but perhaps the authorities thought
it a pity to neglect such a promising instance of the success of
the system by leaving its development to mere chance. He was quiet
again for just six months, when the record says he was sentenced to
seven days' cells for disorderly conduct; but this does not seem to
have discouraged him, for we find him nine days later sentenced to
two months at the treadmill, also for disorderly conduct. Two
months after that was over he took it into his mind to assault
someone&mdash;a keeper, perhaps, for he was sentenced to nine
months in irons for his little freak. Sent to Blackheath, he ran
away from the stockade there when his period was over, and there is
no sentence recorded. It would be useless to speculate why. But at
the end of 1846 we find him sentenced to twelve months in irons for
repeatedly absconding, which was a bad habit. Six months after that
he again ran rapidly away, though in what miraculous manner he did
so this time the dry record before us disdains to tell. At all
events, he was sentenced to twelve months in irons for his feat a
week later, so we may guess that Mr. Doogan did not succeed in
running away very far.</p>

<p>Bearing up under his difficulties, he made another attempt to
add to his record three months later, when he was sentenced to 14
days' cells for bad and abusive language, which was wrong and no
doubt thoroughly inexcusable. But two months later we find him
dancing with a light heart on the treadmill again for two months
because he once more tried to run away. He does not appear to have
taken the same interest in the experiment of which he was the
subject as the reader does, possibly, but then some allowance must
be made for the personal equation in these matters. Bad and abusive
language, four months later, sent him for 14 days to the retirement
of his little cell, and in two months more we find him at the
treadmill again for another eight weeks for absconding. Then for
nine months we hear nothing further of him. We have now brought
this specimen up to the end of 1847. His original sentence was for
seven years, but he has already spent nine in penal servitude, so
that we may infer that at about this stage Hugh Doogan was
released. During the period of his servitude we can count 16
subordinate sentences recorded against this man, who came to the
colony a mere boy whose crime was the snaring of pheasants. One
hundred and thirty-six lashes are recorded here, five weeks in the
cells, six months at the treadmill, and three years and three
months in irons. Add to this the miseries of the ordinary convict's
lot when not "under punishment," and we get a fair idea of the
educative agencies brought to bear on this poor wretch, who
entailed on himself a career of life-long misery for stealing a
brace or two of birds.</p>

<p>Turned adrift at the expiration of his term, as we suppose, it
is not difficult to realise his position. This item of humanity had
had no experience whatever of life, outside his 18 years of rustic
boyhood and his nine years under the convict-system. Of the outer
world he knew nothing. Had Mr. Doogan been hanged at this point in
his career, and his mental state diagnosed by an autopsy of the
brain&mdash;supposing the operation effectual for such a
purpose&mdash;it would doubtless have been found that the universe
for him consisted of a squire and a gamekeeper, a judge and a court
of justice, a prison-ship, and the chain-gang. This suggests a
pretty metaphysical study, which we will not pursue. Only it might
be pointed out that, whatever the scheme of Creation may be, a
creature in the position of this Hugh Doogan could have no part or
hope in it. Under the circumstances what was he to do&mdash;cut
adrift, as he was, among people who had nothing in common with him
except in one point? He solved that question in the only way open
to him, and joined the only people who had anything in common with
himself. He didn't take long about it, either. For in September,
1848, just seven months after he completed his last sentence, we
find him tried at the Maitland Criminal Court for horse-stealing,
and sentenced to ten years' hard labour on the roads or other
public works of the colony. This was a signal triumph for the
system as a manufactory of criminals. It was as certain and as sure
in its operation as the grinding of the mills of God, and the boy
who entered under the yoke emerged at the end of his sentence a
graduated and hopeless felon, ripe for the gibbet, and unfit for
anything else in the existing state of the criminal law.</p>

<p>And just here occurs a singular entry in the police history
before us, which is susceptible of at least one explanation, and we
can think of no other. On the same day that the last sentence was
recorded, Doogan, who arrived by the convict-ship <i>Waverley</i>,
was charged in the name of Henry Herbert, per ship <i>Maugles</i>,
and sentenced to 12 lunar months in Sydney gaol for horse-stealing.
Unless Mr. Doogan was imported in sections, in two different ships,
there was clearly something wrong here. But in the face of so much
that was flagrantly wrong there is no room left for astonishment at
any trifling detail of this kind. At any rate our specimen took his
place again among the convicts, and one month later we find him
going to the cells for 14 days for refusing to work and threatening
the overseer. For 12 months he is quiet again, when we find him
discharged of an imputation that he had been fighting in the
mess-shed. Five months after that he is sentenced to 14 days' cells
again for outrageous conduct in the office; and so far as this
record shows or is concerned that is his last appearance on that or
any other stage. Whether he died under the system, or was released
and reclaimed; or if this ink-faded and patched
document&mdash;bearing date February 11, 1851&mdash;was compiled
for the information of a judge whose duty it may have been to
sentence Hugh Doogan to the last penalty of the law: there is no
evidence before this writer to show. The rest of this man's dismal
story is lost among the tens of thousands of life-stories that lost
themselves blindly among the horrors of the convict-system, as
feeble summer creeks in the Australian interior trickle and lose
themselves amongst the desert sands.</p>

<p>This, then, is the story of a convict in the forcing-bed of
crime which is meant when we speak of the convict-system. We have
seen him pass through all the stages, just as a college-bred youth
passes through all his academical degrees to become a doctor of
divinity, or a piece of crude ore through its processes to come out
a needle or an anchor. And just as these mechanical processes could
not produce a fish, for instance, but must needs result in a needle
or an anchor according to the design of the artificer, so even this
rustic lad could not emerge from the system through which he was
passed in any other form than that of a confirmed criminal. Such a
system would have sufficed to barbarise a philosopher; and
assuredly this poor pheasant-filcher was not such. His ultimate
end, therefore, was as fixed as fate and as unavoidable, and though
the record is silent as to what became of Hugh Doogan, it leaves
very little room for speculation on the subject. So far as
essentials are concerned the system is the same to-day. The
criminal chooses his career in the first instance, and so far the
responsibility rests with circumstances over which he has more or
less control. But once his choice is made there is no escape from
it. Even to this very day we have every appliance for punishing and
distinguishing those who break the law, but none for reforming
them. All authorities on prison discipline admit the fact, and
their only reason or excuse is based on considerations of expense.
By-and-bye someone will discover that this ground is untenable, and
that law-breaking may be minimised under an enlightened and
philosophic system which will recognise the fact that crime is a
necessary evil, but that its propagation is not a necessary State
function. In that Utopian day perhaps the money-vote for the
maintenance of the Department of Prisons will be more intelligently
employed.</p>

<p class="b">Page 49</p>

<p>No doubt such cases as the one we have individualised came daily
and hourly under the observation of Wentworth and Warded, and it is
a significant fact that up to the death of the latter, these men
were always in the front of any movement that tended to do away
with the first cause of all these things. As time went on, and Dr.
Wardell himself fell a victim to the state of things he denounced,
the action of Wentworth became less single-minded. He gradually
left behind him most of his popular sympathies, until at last he
actually left the colony altogether rather than live under the free
institutions he is credited with having brought into existence. The
stages of this falling-off will be seen as this account goes on;
but in the meantime this is the place to note the appearance of
another liberal leader. Dr. Bland, whose name is one of the
best-known of the popular party, was himself a transportee. He was
a distinguished physician's son, and became himself a surgeon in
the navy. He fought a duel with the purser of his ship on an East
Indian station, and killed his man at the first shot. Then he
challenged one of the lieutenants for imputing unfairness. The men
met, but neither was injured. A little later both were arrested,
and, on being tried at Calcutta, were sentenced to seven years'
transportation. William Bland was sent to Botany Bay in 1814, and
within a year obtained a free pardon and entered on the practice of
his profession. He was imprisoned for twelve months and fined £50
for libelling Governor Macquarie, and on his release he showed that
his enforced opportunities for closely observing the working of the
convict-system had not been lost on him. He at once entered on the
career in which he persevered until his death in 1868, at the age
of seventy-nine years; and one of the most striking sights in
Sydney for some years before that event was the spectacle of this
white-haired and benevolent old man, the greater part of whose long
life had been spent in doing good, and in unswerving devotion to
the popular cause. Such a life as his stands out against the
squalid story of Botany Bay like the shadow of a great rock in a
thirsty land.</p>

<p>Bland was one of the first members of the Patriotic Association.
He brought to the popular cause the aid of his voice and pen, and
he also laboured with most benevolent zeal in his professional
capacity among the poorest and most friendless of the population.
It would be impossible to reproduce the feelings of the people in
his regard without the use of words that might lead to a suspicion
of exaggeration. The public charities were his especial care, and
whatever is best in them we owe to the philanthropy of Dr. William
Bland, whose name is one of the worthy few we are so rapidly
forgetting. Some day, perhaps, some popular speaker will make a
popular speech and recall to the minds of those who can remember
him, the venerable figure of this old-time hero, and all the good
work that he has left after him as a pleading memory.</p>

<p>A series of letters written by Bland to Charles Bulwer, M.P.,
England, on the rights of colonists in Australia, placed him in the
front rank of the popular advocates. In his speeches at the
meetings held from time to time to advocate the views of the
Patriotic Association and its claim for free institutions, Bland
was always well in accord with the most enlightened aspirations of
the class that eventually gained the responsible government that
came after. He was a strong opponent of Vested Interests in the
convict-system and all that sheltered under that unclean thing, and
he unsparingly pointed out how those Interests were opposed to the
prospects of the colony, and an obstacle in the way of progress. In
one of his best known speeches he dwelt on the rights of the
native-born, claiming that the possession of talent was more
important than the possession of ill-acquired acres, and stating
that for his part he knew of no "stake in the country" save that of
liberty and life. For this he earned the scurrilous enmity of the
Vested Interest party on the one hand, and on the other was elected
in due time one of the first members of the Legislature for Sydney,
when the first measure of self-government was introduced.</p>

<p>It will be unnecessary to do more than give a brief synopsis of
the results of Governor Bourke's rule. We have seen what the colony
was when he came into it. He practically established the jury
system. He gave up the privilege of assigning convict servants into
the hands of a Board. He amended the brutal and barbarous prison
discipline, and struck the names of 33 convict-master magistrates
off the list at one blow. He issued regular accounts of State
receipts and expenditure for the first time; before his coming the
Governors did as they thought fit with the revenues. He established
a system of free immigration. He did away with a State Church, and
with the law which gave it one-seventh of the lands of the colony
as its dowry. He established religious equality. He founded
Victoria. He acknowledged the liberty of the Press. This skeleton
list is more eloquent and effective than volumes of eulogy to fix
Bourke's place in Australian history. It only remains to add that
the Vested interests drove him out of the country. The Governor had
nominated Mr. Roger Therry (afterwards Judge) to the Chairmanship
of Quarter Sessions. His candidature was opposed by Mr. Riddell,
one of the Vested Interest class and Colonial Treasurer. The latter
was successful. Bourke removed him from the Executive Council for
his official irregularity in opposing the Governor's will. The
matter was referred home, and Riddell was reinstated. The Governor
tendered his own resignation, which Earl Grey begged him to
withdraw. He remained firm, however, and retired from the colony
which he had so ably governed&mdash;a victim to the unscrupulous
and unrelenting opposition which has consistently pursued every
friend of popular measures before and since.</p>

<p>Bourke continued to hold office as Governor of New South Wales
from 1830 to 1837. No Imperial ruler has deserved better of the
country than he. A statue stands in the Sydney Domain to remind the
people of the mother-colony of his services, and of the condition
of things against the survival of which they have to guard. His
endeavours were not entirely successful; it had been a miracle if
they were. But that statue in the Sydney Domain is a mile-stone for
the people on their way from the state of things he found on his
arrival towards that fair prospect to which his liberal rule
pointed the way.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch31" id="ch31"></a>Chapter XXXI. The Transportation
Question.</h2>

<p>Sir George Gipps arrived at the beginning of 1838. He had been a
captain in the Engineers, and afterwards private secretary to a
Cabinet Minister by whose influence be was made one of three
Commissioners sent to Canada before the little rebellion there in
1837. Gipps was a clever and experienced man, a good speaker, and
Lang says "his moral sense was somewhat obtuse." But then Lang was
in the habit of making Gaelic remarks about everyone who did not
favour the claims of the Scots' Church. However, Gipps arrived in
the colony just after a masterful predecessor, and it is
proverbially a difficult task to fit the prophet's mantle to his
successor's shoulders.</p>

<p>For some years after Bourke's departure the results of his
policy followed each other in rapid succession. We have said that,
appalled at the magnitude of the evils of the convict-system, and
the hopelessness of any attempt to remedy them from within the
colony, he sent a despatch to the Colonial Office urging on the
authorities the discontinuance of the transportation system
altogether. In 1836 that correspondence in which Dr. Bland took
part was opened up with Mr. Lytton Bulwer, and the abolition of
transportation became one of the test-points of the Patriotic
Association. The Governor's despatch gave the agitators a definite
ground to go upon, but two years after his departure the Vested
Interest party held a large meeting in Sydney&mdash;February,
1839-to advocate the continuance of the convict-system, to which
that party was so much attached. In October of the following year
Gipps informed his Council that the Home Government, moved,
doubtless, by Bourke's powerful representations, had decided to
stop the custom of transporting criminals to New South Wales, and
next month the <i>Eden</i>, which the colonists regarded as the
last prison-ship that would bring its freight of sorrow and sin to
Botany Bay, sailed down the harbour and discharged its convicts at
Circular Quay. But the struggle was not to end so easily as that.
It was not to be expected that the vile and degrading custom that
had obtained from 1788 to 1840, from which so many unique results
had been obtained, and on which the Vested Interest party had
fattened and grown wealthy from year to year, was to be allowed to
die out without a gallant fight.</p>

<p class="b">Page 50</p>

<p>Lang says that the strongest advocates for the revival of
transportation were the proprietors of flocks and herds in the
interior&mdash;that is to say, the squatters. These men "disliked
the advances that were evidently making by the middle and
industrious classes of the free emigrant population around them,
and felt that their own dignity and self-importance would be much
more easily maintained in the country if there were no middle class
in the country at all&mdash;nothing, in short, between the master
and the slave." These squatters and proprietors were often men who
had brought out some capital to adventure it in the colonies and
return to England with the proceeds. But the class that led the
clamour in this matter were the descendants of the men whose career
has occupied so much of these pages, and who were ready to ally
themselves with any and every person or force that could hold back
the colony on the path of progress, and plunge it hopelessly in the
squalor of the old convict days.</p>

<p>These people had been brought up under the convict-system, and
at a time when theatres and places or opportunities of public
entertainment were infrequent in the colony, it was their practice
to refresh themselves with the sight of public executions, and the
flogging of men and women.</p>

<p>"They had acquired," says Lang, "a liking for the system;
especially for the arbitrary power which it virtually confided to
the master, and the summary punishment to which it subjected the
slave&mdash;the 50 lashes, for instance, for insolence, laziness,
or disobedience, or any of the other imaginary or constructive
crimes and misdemeanours of the convict code."</p>

<p>These people, then, met together to discuss the dreadful
disaster that had fallen upon them. They could foresee quite
plainly the time when the supply of convicts would die
out&mdash;and then what would there be to replace the white labour
which made their fortunes for them, and what would become of the
gallows and the "cat," the spiked iron collars, and the fetters of
the chain-gang? The contingency was a dreadful one. But these
questions have answered themselves since then. Convict labour has
been replaced by something that certain people would like to see
made equally hopeless. And as for the gibbet and the "cat" and the
other barbarous relics of our savage stage, these little trifles
are still in active use, and, so far as they were concerned, the
Vested Interest, party would seem to have agitated itself without
reason. We still hang boys of tender years.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/56-page-50.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">A measure of decision.</p>

<p>A petition was prepared by the people who organised the meetings
of the party. It prayed for the revival of transportation, and gave
some most excellent and indisputable reasons why the continuance of
the convict-system was absolutely necessary to the existence of New
South Wales as a self-supporting colony. No doubt the petitioners
believed all they said in this precious document, for we can easily
believe that they found it impossible to realise a Botany Bay in
which, to quote the words of Phillip, "there should be no slavery,
and consequently no slaves." The petition excited a great deal of
public attention. It found advocates later on in the Legislative
Council, of course. Amongst the people at large it was condemned
with one voice, and the petitioners gibbetted for popular
execration under the name of the "Banditti Party." The leader of
the Banditti Party in the Legislative Council a little later was
Mr. William Charles Wentworth.</p>

<p>It is not to be thought that the shocking enormities of the
convict-system had escaped censure in England. The men who
advocated the Reform Bill of 1832, and the abolition of slavery,
were not likely to allow these things to pass in silence after they
had once been brought under their notice. By the Grace of God the
were always humane men there who lifted up strong voices against
its crying iniquities. Among these was Bishop Hinds, who wrote in
1832 condemning the system in unmeasured terms in the name of
religion, humanity, and morality&mdash;national and private. This
man looked into the future, and made an honest effort to gauge the
influence on colonial social conditions of the institution he
condemned. His conclusions were not favourable ones. "Begin by
breaking up the system," was the only advice he could offer. "There
is no chance for the colony unless that preliminary step be taken."
But this was not all. So convinced had he become of the extent to
which the traditions and spirit of the system had sunk into and
leavened the whole of colonial society, that he could see no
reasonable hope for the future so long as those traditions were
allowed to cling. This conviction has been amply borne out by
events. Every association that could reveal the past was dangerous,
he thought. "There should be a change of place," he
recommended&mdash;"a transfer, if possible, of the seat of
Government to some site within the colony as yet untainted with the
defiling associations of crime and infamy." This language is
strong, but just.</p>

<p>This writer dreaded that, even if the plague-spot were to be
removed, the public sentiment would continue to be charged with the
disease so long as the infection of association remained. We must
look into our criminal code, and the traditional spirit that
underlies our social conditions to find how far his dread was
justified. But this honest bishop might have gone a logical step
further, and recommended the complete removal of all officials and
others trained under and associated with the convict-system, or
officially formed on the models of the men who administered it.
These were the men into whose souls the iron had entered.</p>

<p class="b">Page 51</p>

<p>Archbishop Whately, speaking in the House of Lords some years
later&mdash;in 1840, namely&mdash;used even stronger words. A
committee of the House of Commons on transportation, which met in
1837, had in the meantime collected a startling body of damnatory
evidence. Its publication struck horror into the minds of all who
read it, and many voices were raised against the abomination that
had been nursed into being under the British flag. Said Whately,
voicing the public sentiment on the subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Better, far better would it have been that the lands of New
South Wales should have remained till the end of time in their
primitive wildness, better for the mother-country, for the
aborigines, for the settlers themselves, that the whole region
should have been swallowed up in the ocean, than that it should
have been erected into such a monument of national folly and
perversity, such a stronghold and seminary of wide-spreading and
moral corruption as it now exhibits."</p>

<p>These scarifying words represent the verdict of an English
Archbishop on the working of that so-called "designs of Providence"
theory which, as we saw in the first of these papers, was announced
as having given the Australian continent&mdash;the "great lone,
melancholy island that had lain for thousands of years asleep in a
summer sea"&mdash;to the civilisation of Britain as its
inheritance.</p>

<p>It cannot be too often repeated in this connection that such
invective as this was intended to apply, not so much to the actual
convict, whom, indeed, it was proposed to recall (<i>sic</i>), but
still more, and with far greater reason, as their influence for
evil was the stronger, to the class built up by the exercise of the
gaoler's authority. Dr. Whately understood as well as any man the
true character of this element in the Australian community. He knew
what he was talking about when he spoke these words. For in the
years that preceded 1838 he was instrumental in collecting evidence
to put a stop to that Assignment System under which the evil had
grown up, and which he had been engaged in unsparingly exposing for
some years before.</p>

<p>Listen to Dr. Whately again:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To persevere, I say, knowingly and deliberately, in thus
creating a profligate nation, and by continual fresh supplies
making and keeping it from generation to generation the most
hopelessly corrupt community that ever the sun shone upon, would be
a national crime and folly which I do trust there is too much good
feeling and good sense among us to endure."</p>

<p>And to Bishop Hinds, in choral response:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Think of what stuff this people will have been made of; and who
it is that posterity will then curse for bringing this mildew on
the social intercourse of the world; who it is that will be
answerable for the injury done by it to human virtue and human
happiness, at a tribunal more distant, but more awful even than
posterity."</p>

<p>Truly, the opinions of experts on the subject of the designs of
Providence were beginning seriously to differ!</p>

<p>What side Dr. Wardell would have taken in this dispute, of
course it is now impossible to say with certainty. Certain it is,
however, that Mr. Wentworth became one of the leaders of the
"Banditti Party," and an advocate for the continuance of the state
of things against which he was understood to be lighting up to the
present stage. He had by this time become largely interested in
squatting and an employer of convict labour, and as he grew richer
and began to acquire a Vested Interest of his own in the system, he
exchanged his popular and patriotic sympathies for a price which
few patriots, at least in these modern times, and certainly in
Australia, have been found able to resist. The ambition to become a
larger landed proprietor and territorial magnate of Botany Bay was
too much for Mr. Wentworth's patriotism, although he still
continued to take an active part in the agitation for responsible
government, which, as we shall see presently, had been going on all
this time.</p>

<p>"Not satisfied with being one of the largest speculators in land
and stock in New South Wales," says Lang, "that gentleman had fixed
his eye on a principality in New Zealand."</p>

<p>Mr. Wentworth had a fondness for titles and dignities, and it
will be seen when we come to speak about the Constitution that a
proposal to create a peerage of colonial dukes, earls, and barons
was actually inserted by him in his first draft of the
Constitution. Something similar seems to have moved him in the case
to which Lang refers, which is interesting for the strong light it
throws on the personal character of the man. The first colonists
visited New Zealand just after the beginning of the century, but it
was not until many years afterwards that colonisation set in there.
Some time previous to 1840, Wentworth had bought from a few of the
Maori chiefs, whose tribes were sparsely scattered through the
Middle Island, an expanse of territory covering twenty millions of
acres&mdash;nearly the whole of the island. The treaty of purchase
was drawn up by a few Maori chiefs on the one side, who ceded the
territory, and William Charles Wentworth, who paid over the
stipulated price in blankets, muskets, powder, and some store goods
from Sydney. The instrument or deed was made in Maori and English,
and signed by the chiefs and Mr. Wentworth, in the presence of
regular witnesses.</p>

<p>This sale the authorities in Sydney disputed, and Wentworth
appeared before the old nominee Council and advocated his claim in
person, "proudly displaying his parchment with the signs-manual and
seals of the independent and sovereign chiefs aforesaid," and
concluding by asking nothing from the generosity or charity, but
demanding everything from the justice of England. Gipps saw through
this pseudo-patriot. "He showed up the claim of Wentworth in a
torrent of sarcasm which it is no marvel," said Lang, "that that
gentleman has never been able to forget," and "concluded by
literally overwhelming Mr. Wentworth and his notorious attempt to
appropriate, for his own private benefit, the country which might
otherwise become the happy home of myriads of his
fellow-countrymen." Clearly, Mr. Wentworth was a man of large
views, but it appears to have escaped the notice of those who
condemned this vigorous stroke that there was no difference in
principle to the "myriads of his fellow-countryman" between the
fact of his taking up all this country alone, and its being taken
up by 40 or 50 monopolists in the same terms. The myriads are just
as badly off in any case, and the bulk of the freehold lands of
Australia are just as securely locked up in the hands of less than
100 capitalists as if a proprietorship had been claimed by one. The
difference is, of course, a great one to the hundred individuals
who divide the spoil, but nothing whatever to the myriads who are
equally shut out in either case.</p>

<p>"If all the jobs which have been done since the days of Sir
Robert Walpole were collected into one job they would not make so
big a job," said Gipps in his speech in the Council, "as the one
Mr. Wentworth asks me to lend a hand in perpetrating; the job, that
is to say, of making to him a grant of twenty millions of acres, at
at the rate of 100 acres for a farthing! The Land Company of New
South Wales has been said to be a job; one million of acres at
eighteen pence an acre has been thought to be a pretty good job;
but it absolutely vanishes into nothing by the side of Mr.
Wentworth's job."</p>

<p>That speech finished the patriot's business. It burst up his
scheme for a principality in New Zealand, while at the same time it
conclusively demonstrated the impossibility of ever again trusting
Mr. Wentworth in the position of a popular leader. Public
confidence fell away, though the masterful character of the man
still kept him well in front of the popular movement until
Constitutional Government was obtained. Meantime, after this
instance, there is no occasion to explain the application of the
term "Banditti Party" to the people of whom Wentworth was now the
recognised leader.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch32" id="ch32"></a>Chapter XXXII. Constitutional
Development.</h2>

<p>For a time the anti-transportation question remained in
abeyance. A larger question absorbed public interest, and kept the
minds of all parties abundantly occupied. The movement towards
Responsible Government and a popular Constitution had been going on
all this time, but, as the issue became more and more certain, the
popular will grew more vague and nebulous in its expression, and
the public demands more blurred and ill-defined. The absence of
capable and trustworthy leaders became more marked, as Wentworth's
work which promised so well broke off short like one of those
fractured columns, once part of a noble pile, that now glitter
vacuously and meaninglessly in the white light of an Eastern
sun.</p>

<p class="b">Page 52</p>

<p>When, 20 years before, Governor Brisbane awoke from his
contemplation of the stellar system to a knowledge of his immediate
surroundings, he saw that the people required to be protected from
the rapacity of certain among themselves. He saw that their evils
came, not from Downing-street, but from the people in immediate
authority in the colony itself. On his departure, as we have seen,
he took with him a strong desire to serve the future interests of
the settlement he had at first neglected, and a deputation of
colonists which waited on him before he set sail to express their
regret at his leaving, took the opportunity in the address they
presented to state their desire for taxation by representation
through an elective Assembly of 100 members. This, the first
recorded request for Parliamentary institutions, and the first
public meeting for the purpose, took place on 21st October, 1825.
The deputation that presented this address consisted of Messrs.
D'Arcy and William Charles Wentworth, Thomas Raine, W. J. Browne,
and Daniel Cooper. As far back as 1812 the Select Committee
appointed to enquire into the affairs of the colony recommended
that the Governor should be assisted in his duties by the advice of
a Council. This was in Macquarie's time. That official knew too
well, as Brisbane and Bourke afterwards discovered, that the class
from which such a Council would be drawn&mdash;the official and
propertied element&mdash;had no sympathies in common with the
settlement at large, and that the colony rather asked and required
protection from these gentry than representation through them. His
own efforts for the general advancement were frustrated by the men
who would have been called upon to form a Council had it been then
established. The Macarthur element would have proved a sorry
protector and director of the young commonwealth. He opposed the
recommendation, therefore, and in doing so did wisely. When the
approval of the Secretary of State was refused he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I feel great satisfaction at the determination of his Majesty's
Government in not acceding to the recommendation of the Select
Committee of the House of Commons is regard to the Governor of this
colony being assisted by a Council. I indulge a fond hope that this
measure will never be resorted to in this colony."</p>

<p>This was in 1813. Now, the sincerity and purity of Macquarie's
motives no honest man will question. It is clear, therefor, that
his opinion of the people who "were not convicts, but who should
have been so," was a very strong one. It is abundantly clear now,
too, that the objections he foresaw were afterwards borne out by
facts.</p>

<p>Towards the end of Brisbane's term, however, a Legislative
Council was appointed to advise the Governor. It first met on
August 11, 1824. Purely a nominee and official Council, it
consisted of the Governor; William Stewart, Lieutenant-Governor;
Francis Forbes, Chief Justice; Frederick Goulburn, Colonial
Secretary; John Oxley, Surveyor-General; James Bowman, Principal
Colonial Surgeon; and last, but by no means least, John Macarthur,
of Camden, by this time a territorial magnate and an indisputable
lord of the soil. Thus the person whom history presents to us as
the wiliest enemy of the people and the most restless opponent of
every popular advance, was the first man "of the people" chosen to
advise a Governor, one of whose predecessors he had deposed for
interfering with him and his class; four of whom, according to his
own boast, he had induced the English Government to recall; while
each one had denounced him as a turbulent colonist, a merciless
opponent of good government, and an oppressor of the people. The
single-minded devotion of this able man to one clear and definite
end would, had that end been a good one, have made him the father
of his country. As that end was a selfish one, his evil methods and
politically immoral means did not prevent their issuing in the
successful aggrandisement of himself.</p>

<p>The first Act of Parliament passed in Australia was no
weak-minded sentimental abstraction, commemorative of the dawning
of the legislative function&mdash;that highest exercise of the
faculties of man&mdash;in a virgin country. It was simply a measure
to make promissory notes and bills of exchange payable in Spanish
dollars available as if they had been drawn payable in sterling
coin of the realm. This was on 28th September, 1824.</p>

<p>Governor Darling appointed a new Council on December 20, 1825.
Besides Messrs. Forbes and Goulburn, it included Attorney-General
Saxe-Bannister; Solicitor-General John Stephen, father of Sir
Alfred Stephen; Sheriff Mackaness; John Carter, Master-in-Equity;
and D'Arcy Wentworth, Police Magistrate of Sydney. Archdeacon
Scott, Alexander Macleay, Robert Campbell, senior, and Charles
Throsby, were afterwards added. Two years later than this, on
January 26, 1827, a public meeting, elsewhere referred to in
connection with the agitation for the jury-right, was held in
Sydney to ask for representative rights. A memorial, signed by 24
emigrant settlers and emancipists, representing a million sterling,
asked Sheriff Mackaness to call a meeting to petition the Home
Government on the two subjects named. The meeting is said to have
been the largest held up to that time. It was convened in the
Court-house, and Mr. Wentworth and Sir John Jamison proposed and
seconded a resolution for the adoption of the petition. A
deputation consisting of the Sheriff, Mr. Blaxland, and Mr.
Wentworth, waited on Governor Darling to request him to forward it
to the King. Copies were also sent to Sir James Macintosh and to
Sir Thomas Brisbane for presentation to the Commons and Lords. It
was for tolerating language "offensive to Church and State" at this
meeting, that Sheriff Mackaness was suspended from office, as we
have seen, by Governor Darling. Next year, March, 1828, a new
Legislative Council was appointed, consisting of the same members
as the other, with the exception of Messrs. Carter, D'Arcy
Wentworth, Stephen, Saxe-Bannister, Mackaness, and Goulburn, who
had been succeeded by Alexander Macleay as Colonial Secretary; and
with the addition of the ubiquitous John Macarthur. On July 13 of
the following year a Royal Charter arrived, appointing new
Executive and Legislative Councils. The former consisted of
Archdeacon Scott, the Colonial Secretary, and the Commander of the
Forces. The Legislative Council included these officials, with
Francis Forbes, Chief Justice; Alexander Macduff Baxter,
Attorney-General; Michael Cully Cotton, Collector of Customs;
William Lithgow, Auditor-General; John Macarthur, Robert Campbell,
Alexander Berry, Richard Jones, John Blaxland, Captain P. P. King,
and Edward Charles Close&mdash;the Governor presiding. In this
Council the Civil Jury Bill was passed. Archdeacon Broughton
succeeded Archdeacon Scott on his arrival in September of the same
year. This Council sat through the period of Bourke and Gipps, up
to 1843. The first expression of local popular opinion on the
question of the Civil List was given by Mr. John Blaxland in 1834,
who entered formal protests against the amounts of the salaries of
the Colonial Secretary (£2000 per annum), of the Archdeacon (£2000
per annum), and of the resident at New Zealand (£500 per annum).
Copies of these protests were sent to the Secretary of State. In
the same year measures were passed fixing the recoverable rate of
interest at 8 per cent.; legalising marriages by Catholic and
Presbyterian ministers; and appropriating reverted grants hitherto
held by the defunct Church and School Corporation, to the expenses
of orphanages and to general education. Next year, besides certain
postage regulations and the establishment of a Criminal Court at
Norfolk Island, a sum of £55,040 was voted for the maintenance of
the police and gaols of the colony. This was an important step, and
was taken by command of the Home Government, which devoted the
surplus land revenues of the colony after the emigration vote had
been deducted to meet this outlay. It is a highly significant fact
that this measure&mdash;the first step towards making the colonies
self-supporting&mdash;was only carried after a strenuous opposition
by the non-official members, by a majority of seven to six. Only
one non-official member voted with the majority. Three years later,
on June 6, 1838, the proceedings of the Council were thrown open to
the Press and public for the first time, and from this date the
business of the House was regularly reported in the newspapers.</p>

<p class="b">Page 53</p>

<p>But the Nominee Council was never in harmony with the people,
as, indeed, it was never expected to be. As Macquarie foresaw, its
sympathies were class sympathies and its legislation was class
legislation, except when a masterful man like Bourke controlled its
actions and shamed or forced it into incidental lapses of
liberalism. As our story has shown, every step of the kind was
bitterly and determinedly opposed. And with each step gained the
popular cause grew stronger, and its outlook more hopeful. On
February, 9, 1830, another popular meeting was held to ask for the
jury-right and a Representative Legislature. Sheriff McQuoid took
the chair, and the resolutions passed were transmitted to Sir James
Macintosh and the Marquis of Sligo for presentation, Mr. Stuart
Donaldson being asked to act as agent for the colony. When the news
of the accession of William IV. arrived next year Mr. Wentworth
inserted that amendment in the address quoted in reference to the
jury-right, asking for the general recognition of colonial civil
rights. On January, 26, 1833, a public meeting was again held under
the presidency of the Sheriff, at which a petition was adopted,
requesting a Representative Assembly to consist of not less than 50
members, which should have the right of imposing and appropriating
its own taxes. The petition was moved and seconded by Messrs.
Wentworth and Lawson, and unanimously carried. On this occasion a
paid representative for the colony was first proposed, it being
agreed to memorialise the Governor for a grant of £1000 per annum
for a Parliamentary agent, to be chosen every three years by the
landholders and householders. Two years later the sum of £l400 was
placed at the disposal of Mr. Lytton Bulwer for this purpose. At
this meeting, also, Messrs. Bulwer, Robinson, and Joseph Hume were
thanked for their services to the colony in the British
Parliament.</p>

<p>Many indications showed about this time that a favourable issue
to the popular agitation was at last within measureable distance.
The basis on which the representative institutions asked for should
be formulated now became an anxious subject for discussion, but it
is humiliating to see how, up to the very drafting of the present
Constitution, popular ignorance and vested interests split up the
all-important question. A meeting of the Patriotic Association was
held on December 8, 1835, to discuss the form of legislature and
the electoral qualification. Two forms were discussed, one being
for two Houses&mdash;Upper and Lower&mdash;and the second for a
single elective Chamber of 50 members, 10 to be nominated by the
Government. Six years later, in 1841, the Land and Emigration
Commissioners published their first report, and in September of
that year a meeting was held, under the presidency of the
high-minded Dr. Bland, to consider the same.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/59-page-53.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">The first Sydney policeman.<br>
(From a very, very old print.)</p>

<p>The result was that the meeting decided that the Legislature of
the colony, as it at that time existed, had not shown itself
"either capable or desirous of supplying the wants or representing
the feelings of the colony." A petition was thereupon adopted
praying the Queen to give the people a government based on popular
representation. The movement was taken up in the country, and
petitions to the same effect generally adopted. The agitation again
gathered way. Foiled by the influence of an unpatriotic and selfish
class within the colony so far, the popular demand became more
earnest and more pressing as its temporary leaders&mdash;of whom
Dr. Bland deserves most honourable mention&mdash;forced upon the
people the conviction that the enemies of their cause were the very
persons whose misgovernment called forth the present protest. This
idea, once taken up, was not allowed to sleep. Six months after the
last meeting another great gathering was held to press on the
request for Representative Government. The meeting was adjourned,
in the midst of a stormy debate, to a future day at the Sydney
College, where, on February 16, another petition was adopted, in
which the following facts were categorically set forth:&mdash;</p>

<p>That the colonists were free subjects, forming a population of
130,000; that their property amounted to £30,000,000; that the
annual increment was £2,500,000; that the maritime commerce for the
years preceding touched £22,500,000; that the annual revenue raised
was £350,000; that they had spent £1,250,000 to relieve the British
Islands of 57,000 of their surplus population; and that, meanwhile,
the people had no control over taxation or their own public
business, no representation in Parliament, and almost none of those
free institutions which every Briton prized.</p>

<p>But while these proceedings were going on in Sydney, the same
subject was occupying the attention of the Imperial Government, and
in July 29, 1842, the new Constitution Act was passed by Lord
Stanley, then Secretary of State for the Colonies, which introduced
the principle of elective representation into the legislature of
New South Wales. The Act was received in Sydney on January 5, 1843.
It constituted a new Council to sit for five years, and consisting
of 36 members, of whom 24 were elective, and 12 to be nominated by
the Governor. Six of these latter were to be official
members&mdash;the Colonial Secretary, Treasurer, Auditor-General,
Attorney-General, the Commander of the Forces, and the Collector of
Customs, constituting an irresponsible Cabinet. The electoral
qualification was a £200 freehold, or a £20 rental; that for a
member of Council was £2000 or an income from real estate of £100
per annum. Steps were promptly taken to form the Council, and the
election of two members for Sydney was made by open voting on Hyde
Park, June 13, five members being nominated. A riot ensued, in
which life and property was destroyed. Messrs. Wentworth and Bland
were elected, Messrs. O'Connell, Cooper, and Hustler being the
rejected candidates. In July, Governor Gipps was able to inform
Lord Stanley that the elections were completed and the House
formed. As nominee members it included, besides the officials,
Messrs. R. Jones, Blaxland, Hamilton, Berry, Icely, and Elwin. The
elected members were Messrs. Wentworth, Bland, H. H. Macarthur,
Bowman, D'Arcy Wentworth, Lawson, Cooper, Foster, Bradley, Coghill,
Murray, Suttor, Lord, Dumaresq, R. Windeyer, Macleay, Panton,
Therry; and for Port Phillip, Lang, Thomson, Nicholson, Walker,
Ebden, and Condell.</p>

<p class="b">Page 54</p>

<p>On August 1, 1843, the House was inaugurated by Mr. Deas
Thomson, Colonial Secretary, and Mr. Macleay, then in his 77th
year, was elected Speaker by 17 votes to 13 over Mr. Hamilton, a
Crown nominee. These numbers show the strength of the old leaven in
the new House by no means conclusively, as Mr. Macleay was himself
an old official of the Darling period. He was succeeded by Sir
Charles Nicholson as Speaker on his resignation in 1846. The
measures brought forward in the Council claim attention. Of these,
Wentworth proposed three. The fate of the first illustrates a
feature. The Lien on Wool Act was passed by the Council to enable
the pastoralist to give a mortgage over a forthcoming woolclip. It
was not confirmed in London, on the ground that the principle of
granting a mortgage on a growing crop was not recognised by law.
The difficulty was overcome by re-passing the Bill, which, having
the force of law in the colony until its rejection was announced by
the Secretary of State, gave local pastoralists the temporary
benefit of the measure for the season. The Solvent Debtors' Bill
and the Usury Bill were rejected by the Council. The former was
intended to place a legal obstacle in the way of creditors who
wished to rush a debtor's estate to a forced sale&mdash;a practice
by no means unfamiliar in the past. The latter measure proposed to
fix the rate of interest recoverable on loans and mortgages at 5
per cent., to apply to all existing mortgages.</p>

<p>The two proposals directly hit two blots on our early commercial
and business record, the characters of which have already been
sufficiently explained. They came into existence under the
uncontrolled domination of the class whose power it was hoped to
limit by a partially elective Legislature. But the result of the
very first election held in the country, certainly under a
restricted franchise, showed that the public spirit was scarcely
intelligent enough to discern what it wanted, or to put forward the
proper candidates to represent its wants, if known. It is not
reassuring to note the motives, so characteristic of the narrow
spirit in which the task of self-government was entered on, which
were attributed to the mover of these measures. It was openly
alleged by his opponents that all Wentworth's proposals tended
directly to his own pecuniary profit. But whether this was so or
not matters little.</p>

<p>Another proposal gives us the first instance we can find of the
exercise of the Governor's power to refuse his assent to a measure.
A committee's report was adopted by the Council recommending a
uniform postage rate of twopence for the colony. Sir George Gipps
vetoed the proposal. He also refused his concurrence to a vote in
favour of a National System of Education. One very important action
taken by the Council was in respect of its attempt to control
without reserve the local public expenditure. We have seen how one
step had been already conceded in this direction in 1835. Mr.
Richard Windeyer, a man of liberal sympathies, moved a reduction of
the future Governors' salaries by £l000&mdash;from £5000 to
£4000&mdash;and, on the motion being passed, the Governor informed
the House that his instructions did not allow of his assenting to
its act. At this time the Civil List reserved from local revenues
by the English authorities amounted to upwards of £8l,000, and it
was held by those who wished to see the colony self-governed as far
as possible, that such a sum was disproportioned to a population of
130,856, as shown in the census of 1841. But it was claimed that
even the sum asked for was too small. The Council was asked to
supplement it in certain particulars. Some of the members took the
opportunity to question some of the original items. But here the
Governor interfered, and withdrew the Estimates on the plea that
they were fixed by the Secretary of State, and were above revision.
The additions were not voted, but the claim to the right of control
on the part of the Council was defeated.</p>

<p>This gives the story of the growth of the Legislature up to the
time of Governor Gipps. It is instructive, as proving that the
interests of the colony, as a general rule, required protection
rather from the first legislators themselves than from any outside
official power. Some of the Governors were bad enough in all
conscience, and some of the efforts of Downing-street authority to
control colonial affairs in the wrong direction were baneful to the
last degree. But the singular fact about our history is that in all
these instances it was the local members of Council who suggested
these misdirected efforts of authority, and who aided and abetted
the Governors in the work they tried to do. The plea on which the
agitators founded their appeal for Responsible Government was
embodied in this fact&mdash;the fact, as they themselves said, that
the local Legislature had not shown itself "either capable or
desirous of supplying the wants or representing the feelings of the
colony." The logical corollary from this position would have been
the sweeping away, utterly, and root and branch, of every adjunct
of the system they objected to, when the moment came for reform. We
will see that this was not done. The reformers forgot what they set
themselves to reform. They were about to have a chance to do all
that Bishop Hinds recommended. But they neglected to take the
chance when it came.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch33" id="ch33"></a>Chapter XXXIII. The March of
Events.</h2>

<p>During the period of Governor Gipps' rule the relations between
the public and the ruling classes the Governor represented became
still more strained. The principal points of opposition had
reference to the appropriation of large salaries from the revenues
by the home authorities, and also the fluctuations in the price of
land, which rose and fell at the mere will of the Governor. The
whole question of the uses to which the revenue of the country
should be put also formed a standing subject of public agitation,
and it began to be generally held that the practice of
transportation, which rendered necessary such enormous outlays on
the police and prison system of the colony, should be done away
with.</p>

<p>Gipps came into collision with public opinion chiefly over the
land, and it is instructive to note how the power of the popular
agitation was directed from its legitimate ends by Wentworth and
others, to play into the hands of a class. The price per acre in
1843, when the first elective Council met, was £l. This caused the
most intense dissatisfaction among those who hoped to get land at
5<i>s</i>., and build up estates to last for all time.</p>

<p>Distress followed on dissatisfaction. The Bank of Australia
failed, live-stock became unsaleable, and the colony was only saved
from financial ruin by the device of a squatter named O'Brien, of
Yass, who began to slaughter his stock and boil the carcases down
for tallow. In this form they realised more than the living animal.
It was at this unhappy juncture that Gipps proposed to increase the
taxation of land, and establish a number of regulations and
restrictions of a somewhat harassing kind.</p>

<p>The squatters formed an Association for their protection. The
leader was the notorious Ben Boyd, a gentleman of the London Stock
Exchange, of unlimited credit and aristocratic connections, who
came to the colony in his own yacht, with the avowed purpose of
acquiring the ownership of a million sheep and founding a
phenomenal fortune in Australia. He brought money to the colony at
the period of its greatest distress, in 1841. For a time he had
everything his own way. The squatters of the colony followed his
lead as their own flocks followed the bell-wether. He knit them
together into an organisation, and devised a number of plans to
carry on pastoral operations with the aid of as few shepherds as
possible, and the employment of no more than the very minimum of
labour. It was part of his policy to cut the wages of his shepherds
down to 3<i>s</i>. 10<i>d</i>. per week.</p>

<p>Hitherto these shepherds had been allowed by their masters,
rations of meat, flour, tea, and sugar. Boyd proposed to save the
two last items, which he regarded as unnecessary waste and
extravagance. In his evidence before a committee of the Council in
1843 he gave it as his opinion that any more wages than £10 per
year only drove men to the public-houses. He imported a great
number of islanders from the South Seas, giving them a Scotch cap
and a blanket, and sixpence per head, for their services as
shepherds. But they died off rapidly. He engaged in whaling
pursuits, and in nearly everything else he could turn his active
hands to. But he came to a mysterious end in some remote island in
the South Seas while away on one of his enterprising cruises, and
the name of Ben Boyd was heard no more. The squatters' movement
went on badly without him, although Wentworth threw into the scale
in the squatters' favour all the weight of his influence, obtained
as a representative of the interests of the people of the colony at
large.</p>

<p class="b">Page 55</p>

<p>The matter of immigration also began to attract attention.
Bourke commenced the custom of devoting a portion of the revenues
of the colony to this purpose. He decided that the best way to
check the preponderance of the convict element and the influence of
the convict-masters, would be to introduce a new leaven of free men
and women by a system of assisted immigration. The matter was badly
managed by the agents in England, however, who aimed at securing
the bounty offered them at all costs, making the type of emigrant
sent out an entirely secondary matter. The results of this state of
things were of the most disastrous character. The streets of Sydney
were soon flooded by an influx of friendless females of good
character, and females whose reputations were anything but
spotless. In 184041 the total number of respectable females who
were unable to obtain employment counted up to 600. These women
rapidly fell away into immorality, for which, indeed, they were
abundantly prepared by their experience on board the licentious
immigrant ships.</p>

<p>The name of Caroline Chisholm demands mention here. This
philanthropic lady threw herself nobly into the work of assisting
the friendless immigrants, and rescuing these unfortunates from the
necessity of sleeping in the parks and gardens of the city rather
than succumb to temptations of their position. She established for
their reception the Sydney "Immigrants' Home." This institution
began with a store-room 7ft. square, and the work went on until it
developed into an agency for the supply of servants, dealing with
thousands of cases of otherwise friendless and homeless immigrants.
This noble lady well earned her title of "The Immigrants' Friend."
She instituted proceedings against the captains of immigrant ships
whose conduct on the voyage had been particularly atrocious, forced
the immigration officers to introduce some method and order into
their work, and though she had had little or no money to start with
she succeeded in the space of about four years in providing for
upwards of 11,000 friendless new-comers who would otherwise have
been thrown on the streets with no means of subsistence other than
their own poor resources.</p>

<p>Sir George Gipps left the colony in July, 1846. His term of rule
is remarkable as witnessing a wonderful measure of increased
activity in the public life of the colony, consequent, no doubt, on
the introduction of the elective principle into the Constitution of
the Legislature. The way was now cleared for the transportation
question, which was finally dealt with in the term of the next
Governor.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch34" id="ch34"></a>Chapter XXXIV. The Last of the
Convict System.</h2>

<p>Two months after the arrival of Governor Fitzroy the
Anti-transportation Question was revived. A despatch on the subject
had been received from Mr. Gladstone, then Secretary for State, and
Mr. Wentworth moved for and obtained a Select Committee of the
Legislative Council to inquire into and report upon the renewal of
transportation. The inquiries of a committee framed in this way
could only tend to one result, of course, and no one was surprised
to find, when the report of the committee was brought up, that its
finding was strongly in favour of the continuance of the practice.
Mr. Macarthur, following the traditions he had inherited from his
father, distinguished himself by his earnest advocacy of the
transportation and convict systems. But the public opinion of the
country had already been formed on this subject. Large popular
meetings were held to protest against the finding of the committee.
At the first of these, held in the City Theatre, Mr. Charles Cowper
presided, and moved a resolution expressing the sense of regret and
alarm felt at the proposal to renew transportation after it had
practically been in abeyance for six or seven years. The Rev. John
McEncroe, who was soon to become a prominent leader in this and the
constitutional agitation, also addressed the meeting, and a
petition was adopted to which 2000 signatures were appended. On the
last day of the session, October 22, 1846, this document was
presented to the House, and no stronger commentary is required on
the unrepresentative character of that Chamber than the fact that
the motion for its being printed was summarily rejected by the
nominee and elected members.</p>

<p>This action of the House, and its prorogation just after, was an
affront to the public meeting which had drawn up the petition that
could not be allowed to pass over in silence. The Report of the
House favouring transportation was in readiness to be sent to
England, and it was important that the document should not be
allowed to tell its story unquestioned. An anti-transportation
committee was therefore formed, and a memorial to the Governor
drawn up asking that officer to send an official copy of the
petition to England with the Report, and to interest himself in the
agitation on the side of the expressed will of the people. Sir
Charles Fitzroy promised to forward the petition, but declined to
interfere or to use any influence in the matter. The partial
success of this move encouraged the opponents of transportation to
organise meetings throughout the colony, and elicit expressions of
opinion on the subject from all large centres of population. These
began to come in day by day, declaring unanimously against the
perpetuation of the convict-system. With this movement the
anti-transportation agitation in its second phase may be said to
have been fairly launched.</p>

<p class="b">Page 56</p>

<p>Another great popular demonstration took place in the Victoria
Theatre on February 13, 1849, at which the Secretary of State's
despatch was again considered and condemned. Charles Cowper, Robert
Lowe (now Lord Sherbrooke), and Dean McEncroe delivered strong
speeches on the subject, and a petition was adopted stating on the
part of the colonials that "they felt bound humbly but firmly to
represent to her Majesty that it was their duty and their
determination, by every legal and constitutional means, to oppose
the revival of transportation in any shape." A similar meeting was
held in Melbourne on the same day, and the provincial towns
followed the example thus set. Another popular meeting took place
next month, March 9, at the Victoria Theatre, the Mayor presiding,
and the same speakers addressed the people. This increased activity
was caused by the receipt of news that a ship laden with convicts
for Australia had been detained in port owing to the accident of
cholera having broken out on board. The circumstance still more
strongly excited the popular mind.</p>

<p>On June 8, 1849, the last of the convict ships arrived in Sydney
Harbour. The Hashemy, a vessel of 936 tons, commanded by Captain
Ross, passed through the Heads on that day with 212 transported
prisoners. Popular excitement reached its highest pitch. A great
meeting was convened three days later at Circular Quay to discuss
the situation, and protest against the action of Earl Grey and the
Colonial Office. About 4000 persons assembled, and the authorities
were so alarmed at the serious manifestation of public feeling that
the guards of Government House were doubled and a ship-of-war then
in port was brought up the bay and ordered to train her guns on the
place where the people's meeting was held. Mr. Robert Campbell
presided, and among the speakers were Messrs. Robert Lowe, G. A.
Lloyd, Flood, Lamb, Wilshire, Grant, Peek, and Fullerton. On this
occasion, too, Mr. Henry Parkes made his first important public
appearance. He was then an obscure agitator among the herd, with no
stake or interest in the country; but his amorphous Democratic
sympathies had already made him known in his own sphere, and he had
become a member of the League, formed, as we have seen, in 1835.
Mr. Lamb moved a resolution at this meeting in which the loyal
inhabitants of Sydney protested against the transportation of
British criminals to New South Wales on the grounds that it was in
violation of the will of the majority; that many colonists had
emigrated on the faith of the Government that the practice had for
ever ceased; because the practice was incompatible with our
existence as a free colony desiring self-government; because it was
unjust to sacrifice the social and political interests of the
colony at large to the pecuniary profit of a fraction of the
inhabitants; and because that act of injustice would tend to
alienate the affections of the colony from the mother country.</p>

<p>A deputation of six was formed to present the petition to the
Governor. They asked that the ship in port might be sent back, but
this request was refused. A week later a meeting adopted a petition
praying that Earl Grey, having forfeited the confidence of the
colonists by his perfidy to the pledge given, should be removed
from her Majesty's councils. On Tuesday, June 19, paragraphs in the
Sydney papers informed the public that the convicts were to be
removed from the ship that day. Forty-five were sent to Moreton
Bay, for hire by the settlers. The men were not to be employed in
the county of Cumberland. The name of Mr. Lawson was given as one
of the hirers of this last batch of convict labour. It is
remarkable how strongly the old taint clung to these men. This
man's name is an easy link between the early days of grisly horror
and the last manifestations of the convict-system in New South
Wales. In the course of the same year the Governor visited Port
Phillip, and the colonists there took the opportunity to request
him to use his influence to preserve that part of the country from
the evils of the convict-system. A promise was obtained that any
vessels that might arrive at Port Phillip would be ordered on to
Sydney. Later, but still in the same year, another despatch on the
transportation question was received, stating that the re-adoption
of the system had been decided on, but limited to convicts who
might be entitled to conditional freedom on their arrival. Next
year, 1850, saw further developments. During its course
transportation ceased to Moreton Bay (May 12), and commenced to
Western Australia. On September 16 another popular and
uncompromising protest was recorded by a meeting of 6000 persons on
Barrack Square. The Revs. Archdeacon McEncroe, Ross, Beareer,
Boyce, and West, with Messrs. Lamb, Mort, Bowman, Holden, Weeks,
and Piddington, spoke on the occasion, and the New South Wales
Anti-Transportation Association was formed.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/62-page-56.jpg" alt=

</p>

<p class="caption">The beginning of the end.</p>

<p>In the meantime some person had discovered, among some
Parliamentary papers sent out to the Sydney Free Library, a
despatch from Governor Fitzroy to Earl Grey in relation to the
great meeting at the Circular Quay in the previous year. The
Governor described that gathering as one of the mob alone&mdash;an
"assemblage of a few hundred people of questionable character." It
went on to say that most of those present were idlers attracted by
curiosity, who took no part in the proceedings; while of those
actively concerned there was scarcely one person who occupied any
position of influence in the community&mdash;contentions remarkably
similar to those which have so often been used in later times by
the colonial Tory or "Jingo" party for the purpose of endeavouring
to discredit democratic movements or demonstrations. The
publication of this document revived all the elements of incipient
disaffection. An indignation meeting was at once called, and 4000
persons adopted a petition to the Queen, in which the Governor was
charged with maligning the great majority of the colonists,
misrepresenting public facts to his official superiors, and
betraying the interests of the colony. It further set forth the
incapacity of the Governor, and demanded his recall; expressed the
general distrust of Earl Grey, demanded the revocation of the Order
in Council proclaiming New South Wales a penal settlement, and
asserted that responsible institutions were an absolute requisite
for the safe government of the colony.</p>

<p>Mr. John Lamb, a nominee member of the Legislative body, but
whose popular sympathies on this particular question at least are
sufficiently evidenced by his part in the agitation, brought the
question about this time under the notice of the Council, and moved
a resolution to the effect that an address might be presented to
the Queen, asking for the revocation of the obnoxious Order in
Council. The opponents of the popular will, led by Mr. Wentworth,
affected to misunderstand the demonstrations of public opinion on
the question, and their majority was sufficient to postpone the
motion for a month to enable the people to give their desires
definite expression This was a transparent trick, unworthily
resorted to as a means to gain time to organise the interest which
favoured the continuance of transportation. But it defeated its own
object and resulted in an occurrence which put the question out of
the region of debate at once and for ever. The transportation party
collected their strength and prepared a petition in favour of
perpetuating this public disgrace, in their own selfish interests.
They secured 525 signatures in all to this flagitious document. A
popular meeting was held, and a popular petition prepared. It bore
36,589 signatures, representative of all classes in the community
but one. It was presented to the Council. A debate ensued, which
was followed with the keenest interest throughout Australia
wherever an adventurous settler had penetrated or a knot of people
had collected together. This time the opponents of the popular will
and the advocates of one of the direst disgraces to civilisation of
which the world's history has record, were about to be outnumbered
in the division. But they were consistent to the last. When the
question was about to be put they rose in a body and left the
Chamber, while the remnant of the House carried the Address in
their absence.</p>

<p>This episode in our history shows us the old Vested Interest of
the colony, which we have seen form and grow under the most
distressing circumstances of squalor and corruption, driven from
its last ditch as an organised force, openly leading in the
struggle between the people and a class. Henceforth its members
betook themselves to a more dangerous and more congenial guerilla
warfare, shooting their bolts from behind hedges and blind walls,
and bribing the weak, the ill-informed, and the venal among the
popular party with Greek gifts&mdash;crumbs of the treasure their
unpatriotic selfishness in the past had enabled them to
acquire.</p>

<p class="b">Page 57</p>

<p>The Address thus carried was sent on, and presented in due
course to the Queen. The responsible advisers of the Crown could
not but acknowledge the legislative rights they had themselves
conferred. There could be but one result. So far as New South Wales
was concerned it was conceded that the practice of convict
transportation must cease. The Order in Council was revoked. Yet
the Colonial Office still had nefarious designs on other parts of
the continent. But Australia was now on the eve of an event which
was destined to completely change the whole face of this and
kindred questions. On February 12, 1851, Edward Hargraves announced
his discovery of gold in New South Wales, and by that act, in the
words of Mr. Wentworth, "precipitated the colony into a nation."
The colony was not prepared for its dazzling apotheosis. Its
suddenness took the popular mind by surprise, and prevented our
grasping the matured fruits of such a golden seed-sowing of
national fortune.</p>

<p>In January of the same year the agitation had been carried on
with enthusiasm, gathering strength from the fact that
transportation to Van Diemen's Land was still in force. At a
meeting held it was proposed to constitute one General League, the
members of which should covenant together to take every means to
discourage and discountenance the practice of convict
transportation. The Anti-Transportation Association was
incorporated into the General League, and delegates were sent
throughout Australia to organise public opinion on the subject. The
League described itself as "bound by every obligation of duty mid
affection to protect the children of the country from the dangers
incident to the transportation of offenders to these colonies," and
its members "united in a solemn appeal to the humanity and justice
of the Sovereign and people of Great Britain on behalf of the
rising generation." This is the first recorded public recognition
of the fact that some others besides the adventurers who had
settled in the country for the fortunes they secured there, had a
claim on the Australia of the present and of the future&mdash;the
race, namely, that was to be born and cradled there. On February 8,
1851, the petition of the colonists against transportation was
presented to the House of Commons by Mr. Molesworth. Five days
after that date a great meeting on the same subject was held in St.
Patrick's Hall, Melbourne.</p>

<p>On July 9 a muster of the General League was called, and a
meeting held under the chairmanship of Mr. Charles Cowper, in view
of an announcement from Earl Grey that, in order to meet the
objections of colonists, the Moreton Bay district should be erected
into a separate colony, to which convicts might be sent. The
popular Archdeacon McEncroe, with Messrs. Norton, Wright, Kemp,
Holden, Lamb, Campbell, Josephson, and Parkes were the speakers. A
petition to the Queen was adopted, requesting the dismissal of Earl
Grey, and "entreating her Majesty to redeem the honour of the
British Crown by fulfilling the pledge touching transportation,
repeatedly given to the colonists." Animadverting on the conduct of
the Minister responsible in the eyes of the colonists for this
breach of faith, the petition went on to say that "the petitioners
felt compelled, humbly but firmly, to represent to her Majesty in
person that the subterfuges, equivocations, and breaches of faith
practised towards these colonies by Earl Grey had unhappily
destroyed all confidence in his administration of colonial
affairs."</p>

<p>On April 2, 1852, one of the most remarkable of all the
demonstrations on this subject took place in Sydney. By this time
the added influence of the gold discovery began to make itself
felt, and the speeches took a freer tone. It was thought by many
that the colonies were on the eve of independence. One special
point in the address of Archdeacon McEncroe, clearly showing the
temper of men's minds, was thus commented on by the <i>Empire</i>
newspaper next day in a leading article:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At this numerous, influential, and earnest meeting, convened by
public announcement in the largest city in the Australian colonies,
where any man could attend and express his own sentiments or his
dissent from those of any other man&mdash;at this meeting the
Secretary of State is plainly told, for the first time in serious
earnestness, that 'the colonists, rather than surrender their
rights in this struggle, will "cut the painter" and drift away from
the mother-country in their frail bark of freedom.' And the
venerable Archdeacon, who spoke these words, was stopped by the
meeting with tremendous cheering. This 'cutting of the painter' was
the master-thought&mdash;the all-pervading idea, running its
electric light through the varied tissues of every speech, and
diffusing its influences like a moral atmosphere round that
congregated body." The <i>Empire</i> had been started by Mr. Henry
Parkes in 1850, and was contributed to by Robert Lowe, Edward
Butler, James Martin, William Forster, Deniehy, Mitchell, and
others. The new journal became an intelligent and advanced advocate
of Liberalism. No man reading its columns nearly 40 years ago, with
an impossible prescience of the part some of the members of its
contributing staff were to individually act in the public life of
this country, would have foreseen the hybrid social conditions and
inconsequent and anomalous political system which has since been
evolved in Australia under their eccentric guidance. A cynical
person, however, whose allusions have been corroded by experience,
might look at the matter from another point of view, and find
little difficulty in accounting for this distressing infidelity to
first principles on the lines laid down by a certain sarcastic
Spanish proverb.</p>

<p class="caption">A thumb-nail sketch.</p>

<p>Let us finish this chapter with a thumbnail sketch of one of the
actors in the little drama we have just gone over. Among the
strangers who haunted the public gallery of the Legislative Council
after one obscure figure might have been often seen, He was tall,
this young fellow, and somewhat gaunt; with hollow features and
eyes, and all the indications of a highly sanguine temperament.
Tire early legislative proceedings seemed so have a fascinating
interest for this unnoticed observer, dressed as a workman, and
with the marks of toil common to his class about him. Fresh from
Birmingham with its crowded fight for life, he had starved on the
streets of Sydney, sought and obtained hard work as an immigrant in
the colony, and, later on, established himself as a maker of toys
in Hunter-street. When not at work he was discussing politics among
persons of his class, following a taste he had acquired at Chartist
meetings "at home," His knowledge of men and things was acquired in
the workshops and from his perch in the old Legislative Council
Chamber, and from a dame's school at Stoneleigh which he left in
his eleventh year. Now, in 1845, Henry Parkes is just 30 years of
age. Fate will capriciously place within his hands a marvellous
opportunity by-and-bye. And because he has not been trained to
exercise such an opportunity, he will fatuously throw it away.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch35" id="ch35"></a>Chapter XXXV. The Man Who Was
Chained to a Rock.</h2>

<p>We have now seen the last of the convict system, but, before the
subject is finally closed, it will be well to illustrate what has
been said about its iniquities by one striking characteristic
instance. To tell the whole story in its naked horror would be
impossible, and our purpose in this, as in other instances, will be
served just as well by selecting one example as a type or standard.
Meantime, it is as well to add that between the years 1840 and 1845
no less than 17,000 convicts were sent out to Tasmania.</p>

<p class="b">Page 58</p>

<p>The case we now take is that of a transportee named Charles
Anderson, and his career will illustrate the working of the old
penal system of the colonies for us before we close this inquiry
into the causes that have influenced our later development. Nothing
so clearly fixes the impression of the general character of these
early influences than a representative instance displaying the
system in its working and in its effects. Charles Anderson was one
of the tens of thousands who fell under the merciless penal laws of
their country, and were sent out to Botany Bay. His father was a
sailor who was drowned, leaving a wife and two boys, of whom this
individual was one. The mother died and the two children found
their way to the workhouse, and from that enlightened and painfully
benevolent institution they were sent to sea. At the age of 9 years
Charles was apprenticed to a collier, served his term, and then
joined a man-of-war. He was at the battle of Navarino, where he
received a wound in the head. Now, neither the collier nor the
workhouse were good schools for getting a clear grasp of
socio-economical questions, and whatever airy perceptions this good
fellow had of these matters were further considerably knocked askew
by that unkind buffet he got in the service of the King. The
consequence of this was that when a little excitement or less rum
overset the balance that held him between right and wrong, he
incontinently toppled over into evil courses. He was with a party
of drunken sailors in a Devonshire seaport town one evening, and in
the street row that naturally followed some shops were broken into.
Charles Anderson was arrested, convicted, and sentenced to seven
years' transportation to Botany Bay. The wound received in the
service of the King was of little avail for him on that or any
other occasion.</p>

<p>Charles Anderson was now 18 years of age. No one said a word in
his favour, and not a step was taken in his behalf. When he
recovered from his semi-lunatic state he had no recollection of
what had taken place. The judicial proceedings simply dazed him. He
perhaps knew of no crime that he had committed, and for a lad whose
life had been spent in the workhouse and at sea the action of the
Courts was, likely enough, an absolute mystery. Before he realised
what was going on he was at sea again; not this time wearing the
King's uniform but the fetters of a convict hulk. On his arrival at
Sydney, after a voyage of which the miseries need not be repeated,
he was sent to Goat Island. This unhallowed spot, which has a
history of its own in the records of convict discipline, was a
place of detention for English or first-convicted prisoners. The
mental state of Charles Anderson at this stage is thus described in
an article printed in an English magazine some years later, "Doomed
to a punishment involving the deepest degradation," says this
writer, "for a crime of the committal of which he was not
conscious, the bitterest hostility against his kind took possession
of his breast." This remark embodies the experience of every
observer of the system, which embruted the men it was supposed to
reform. "Utterly ignorant both mentally and morally," this article
goes on to add, "he had little idea of patient submission, which,
indeed, physical disease rendered impossible. No wonder, then, that
violence created violence. His floggings were almost innumerable;
but, sturdy and staunch for good or evil, punishment had no effect
on him. His was no spirit to give in to harshness, and kindness was
never dreamt of." Under these conditions, this man may be regarded
as having made a fair start.</p>

<p>Goat Island kept Anderson two months, when he elected to retire.
His views respecting penal discipline did not at all coincide with
those of the humorous individuals who held sway in Goat Island. He
absconded, therefore, eluded his keepers, and, braving the sharks
that were induced by judicious feeding to "swarm around the island,
swam ashore, and made his escape. From this point his real
enjoyment of the situation may be said to commence. He was caught,
taken to the Sydney Barracks, and presented with 100 lashes for his
activity. Then he was sent back to Goat Island, where the
authorities, scorning to be deprived of the wholesome fun that was
justly theirs by any precipitancy on the part of the people at the
Barracks, generously gave Charles Anderson 100 more lashes for the
same offence, and in a spirit of philanthropic reform added a
sentence of 12 months in irons&mdash;also for the same offence.
During that 12 months he received exactly 100 lashes a month, being
1200 in all, for offences which are recorded in the register as
"looking round from his work," "gazing at a boat in the river," and
other such atrocious outrages. At the end of the 12 months he shed
his irons, and obnoxiously made use of the first chance opportunity
offered to take his chance among the sharks once more. He escaped,
and, of course, was arrested again. Remember, the original sentence
of this 18-year-old boy was for seven years.</p>

<p>The Goat Island people acted with splendid decision this time.
It is solemnly recorded that they first incontinently gave Charles
Anderson 200 lashes for absconding, then had him tried for the same
offence, gave him 100 lashes more, and then sentenced him to be
chained to a rock on the island for two years. This humorous device
was carried out.</p>

<p>"With barely a rag to cover him, he was fastened by his waist to
the rock with a chain 26 feet long, and with trumpet-irons on his
legs. A hollow scooped out in the rock, large enough to admit his
body, served for his bed, and his only shelter was a wooden lid
perforated with holes, which was placed over him and locked in that
position at night, being removed in the morning."</p>

<p>Chained up like a recalcitrant chimpanzee in this way, the
unhappy youth was left such liberty as his 26 feet of linked iron
afforded to feed the aesthetic side of his nature with
uninterrupted views of such matchless scenery as our beautiful
harbour affords; the other food he required was "pushed" at him, we
are told, on the end of a long pole. Sometimes one of the other
prisoners would so far close their eyes to the humour of this novel
situation that they would be led insanely enough to pity their
comrade.</p>

<p>One brutalised individual, who had been a messmate of the
Chimpanzee, actually gave him a piece of tobacco. For this the Good
Samaritan received 100 lashes at the hands of his gaolers, who
could not understand such an abnormal eccentricity of sympathy
towards a fellow-creature.</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/64-page-58.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">Feeding the creature.</p>

<p>The humanising effects of the system on the general public were
finely illustrated by the case of Charles Anderson. The good people
made up little picnics and pleasant water-parties to see the
Chimpanzee. They regarded him as a wild beast, we are plainly told,
and when they passed in boats would throw lots of bread and biscuit
at him as at a bear or a real Chimpanzee, to see him bolt the
morsels, or to hear the creature swear. But we had better let an
extract tell the rest of this part of the disgusting story. This is
what we find in the English magazine we have referred to: "Exposed
to all weathers, and without clothing on his back and shoulders,
which were covered with sores from repeated floggings, the maggots
rapidly engendered in a hot climate feeding upon his flesh, he was
denied even water to bathe his wounds, such denial being not an
infrequent portion of the punishment to which he had been
condemned; and when rain fell, or by any other means he could
obtain liquid, he would lie and roll in it in agony." On such
occasions doubtless the water-parties would offer extra
attractions. No word need be added to this except to remind the
reader that this took place, not in some remote convict-pandemonium
on a distant station in the interior, or away on a lonely rock in
the vast Pacific, but on an island in the fairway of Port Jackson
within a stone's throw almost of Government House; and not in the
time of Governor Phillip or of the New South Wales Corps, but under
the rule of Governor Darling and not much more than 50 years
ago!</p>

<p>When Bourke arrived in the colony and heard of this horror, he
lost no time in visiting Goat Island and personally enquiring into
the circumstances. He saw the Chimpanzee and tried to reason with
him, offering to release him if he would promise to go back to
work. But things had gone too far. Anderson refused to work, for be
said that "if he worked he would be punished and if he did not work
he would be punished the same." Bourke released him, however, and
sent him to work at Port Macquarie away from the Goat Island
associations. Here the gaolers devised new tortures. He was put to
work carrying lime in baskets on his back from the kilns to some
Government barges lying off the settlement. His overseer, Anthony,
threatened that the lime and salt water should burn the flesh off
his back, "and in effect," we learn, "it did burn off the skin,
causing excruciating agony." Anderson demurred, and accepted an
early opportunity that presented itself to run fleetly away from
the uncongenial society of Mr. Anthony. He travelled several
hundred miles on foot, suffering cruel hardships that were
endurable to him since they did not come from his fellow-creatures.
He joined some aboriginal tribe, who were pursued by the police for
having attacked and killed some settlers. These police captured
Anderson and sent him back to Port Macquarie, where Anthony gave
him 200 lashes and returned him to his labour gang.</p>

<p class="b">Page 59</p>

<p>But the monotony of these proceedings became simply fatiguing,
and eventually palled on Anderson. He lost all interest in Mr.
Anthony's personal welfare, and when a fellow-convict invited him
to kill the overseer, Anderson accepted the invitation with
effusion. He was tired of life, he said&mdash;and no wonder; he
said "he would do the deed, and be hanged for it." So on a pleasant
morning, when the sun was bright on the sleeping water, he smote
Mr. Anthony on the ear with a spade, and that excellent man
expired. The soldiers spitted Anderson with their bayonets, and
when he was taken to the hospital he was found to be wounded in
five places. He was cured, tried in Sydney, sentenced to death,
but, some meddlesome fellow having most inopportunely made some
remark about the case and its circumstances, the man was snatched
from the gallows and sent to work in chains on Norfolk Island for
the term of his natural life. Here we lose sight of him, but only
for a time. His record shows that during his residence at Norfolk
Island he still continued to furnish encouraging results to the
working of the system, insomuch that this Charles Anderson may be
regarded as one of the best representative types the operation of
the penal laws affords.</p>

<p>Captain Maconochie was the next person to interest himself in
Anderson, and on his arrival to take charge of Norfolk Island he
found his record to be 10 convictions for violent assault, three
times scheming to avoid labour, and many charges of insolence and
insubordination. Anderson was at this time 24 years of age, but,
adds the record significantly, he looked 40. He was now a desperate
character, had been so for some time, in fact. According to
official appraisal he was just the kind of convict for which
Norfolk Island was established&mdash;that is, the utterly reprobate
and hopelessly beyond reform. The justification for the existence
of that island of horror was the phenomenally bad character of the
people found there, but the story of Anderson and of hundreds like
him shows that these outcasts were regularly and systematically
developed by the convict-system, and cultivated up to the
phenomenal pitch of rascality which was the effect of the system
and not its reason or cause. When Captain Maconochie arrived he was
told Anderson was "cranky," and his fellow-prisoners amused
themselves, after the manner of their gaolers towards themselves,
by teasing him and making him vicious. This was shopped, and
Maconochie took the case in hand. There were some wild bullocks
running about the island, and Anderson was placed in charge of
these. He went by the nickname of "Bony" now, and a good many
people thought mad Bony and his wild bullocks would come to grief.
No one was allowed to interfere with him, however, and soon a
marked change made itself apparent in the man.</p>

<p>"He became less wild," we read, "felt himself of some value, and
won praise for his good conduct and successful management of his
bullocks. He and they grew tractable together." But what a contrast
between this poor wretch's treatment of his bullocks and his own
treatment by his gaolers! Maconochie had heard of his being chained
to the rock on Goat Island before he saw Anderson at all, and he
humanely resolved to do his best to give him his chance among the
rest of humanity; there were occasionally exceptions among the
gaolers of the convict system. He watched his lunatic herdsman, and
"often were the anxious watchers of the experiment amused by the
first insight into criminal discipline which Anderson displayed in
the treatment of his charge." The watchers were "amused"; but the
experiences of the herdsman that taught him what he knew were
probably not of an amusing character. No more blasting censure
could be passed on the system than the story of this benighted and
God-forsaken creature, thus turned from an honest sailor-lad, who
had, in his own ignorant way, served his country under fire, to
this mad herdsman on this faraway abode of despair. The experiment
went on successfully, however, and it was observed that he and the
bullocks seemed to understand each other, and that "he knew
instinctively that high and strong tempers will not bend to the
lash." Constant occupation strengthened and steadied his mind
again, and as he improved the old longing for something of his
sailor-life came back to him.</p>

<p>Captain Maconochie found that his physical liability to
excitement continued, and he was afraid to let him mix with his
fellows. His constitution, too, was so shattered as to unfit him
for heavy work. It occurred to Maconochie to erect a signal-station
on Mount Pitt, the highest point of the island, and place Anderson
in charge. His delight was extreme, for he now felt himself a man
again, and, dressed in his sailor's costume, he soon regained the
bearing of a man-of-war's man. The top of Mount Pitt was cleared, a
hut built, and a staff with a complete code of signals provided.
Anderson got a little patch of garden-ground to till and keep in
order, he grew the best potatoes on the island, and every giver of
a new flower was a benefactor. He showed his gratitude to Captain
Maconochie by bringing every day a fresh basketful of potatoes for
the use of his dinner-table, and the signals was so well attended
that the settlement at once knew if a sail was in sight.</p>

<p>There is a story that Sir George Gipps visited Norfolk Island
about three years after Maconochie arrived, and while driving one
day Anderson was seen tripping along in his trim sailor dress, full
of importance, with his telescope under his arm. "What smart little
fellow may that be?" said Gipps. "Who do you suppose? That is the
man who was chained to the rock in Sydney Harbour," came the reply.
"Bless my soul, you don't mean to say so?" was the Governor's
astonished rejoinder.</p>

<p>We will let an extract tell the rest of this story of Charles
Anderson, leaving the reader to look for himself behind the curtain
which in this perfectly-authentic biographical sketch we have drawn
aside for a moment from the vision of horror it covers up and
conceals. From this and other instances we have given the reader
may judge of the whole system, and this story of one-man's life is
not told with any sensational object, but with the view to point a
political moral that has a direct interest for every voting unit of
the population. The days of the convict-system have gone. But our
institutions are branded deep with the old mark, and the story of
the past is the explanation of the present and the key and guide to
popular action in the future. The extract which follows tells us
the last we know of this victim of British laws that were highly
approved of in their day, but which have been partially reformed in
the light of Democratic progress, just as the anomalies of the
present will disappear one by one before the intelligence of the
future.</p>

<p>"As he regained his self-respect Anderson revealed a noble,
generous heart, and a gay and sociable disposition; but his
excitability eventually became madness, and not long after the
benefactor who had restored him and hundreds like him to the
feelings and duties of humanity was peremptorily recalled from the
scene of his philanthropic labours Anderson was seen in a lunatic
asylum by one whom he had known as a friend of the captain in
Norfolk Island, The poor fellow recognised his visitor and spoke of
nothing but Captain Maconochie and his family." Here his story
finishes, and no blacker condemnation of the unspeakable
Convict-System and its agents at Botany Bay could be imagined or
found.</p>

<h2><a name="ch36" id="ch36"></a>Chapter XXXVI. The Island of
Horror</h2>

<p>It is impossible to tell the story of Norfolk Island. No writer
would dare to put in words one tithe of the record of that
unexampled hell upon earth. Such was the tiger-like ferocity of the
gaolers, on the one hand, and of their caged victims on the
other-such the bestiality and savagery that ruled, the cruelty, the
misery, and the unspeakable horror of that accursed plague-spot in
the Pacific, that the task would be easier to describe an island of
lepers than that civilised and enlightened moral experiment. No one
has yet ventured to tell the truth, the whole truth, about Norfolk
Island, and probably no one ever will. Marcus Clarke, in his tale,
has given a glimpse of what went on there; but, even for the
purposes of realistic fiction, the material that island has to
supply is too brutal and too revolting for the most courageous
realist to use. This inquiry into the origin of our social and
political system necessitates some historical mention of Norfolk
Island, but we will not linger on the unsavoury subject.</p>

<p>We have already described how Lieutenant King founded the
settlement at Norfolk Island in March, 1788, and was relieved by
Major Ross two years later. The very first lines of the island's
story, like that of Botany Bay proper, are written in blood, for,
under Major Ross, it will be remembered, men and women alike who
would not work were "adjudged to suffer death." Towards the end of
the following year King resumed the chief-gaolership, and in 1800
Major Foveaux went there as Lieutenant-Governor of the island. This
worthy was one of the officers of the infamous New South Wales
Corps, and under him the place really began to produce its most
refreshing results. There is some information on this subject in
certain papers placed at the writer's disposal, from which we
gather, amongst other things, that Norfolk Island was already
regarded as "the dwelling place of devils in human shape, the
refuse of Botany Bay, the doubly-damned, and a place of horrid
banishment and cruel treatment."</p>

<p>Major Foveaux was the undisputed despot of the place. He began
by taking a fancy to the wife of one of his non-commissioned
officers. Sergeant Sherwin did not fall into his Major's domestic
plans very readily at first, and hesitated about handing his wife
over. But Major Foveaux locked the Sergeant up for this
insubordination, at the same time confiscating his wife. Under this
gentle suasion the Sergeant was brought to a proper frame of mind,
and induced to think it better to save his life and lose his wife
than to lose both. "He was wise enough," we are told, "to perceive
that it is very foolish to quarrel with the judge where there is no
jury, for no man will give a verdict against himself." So Ann
Sherwin remained with the Major, and the Sergeant left the island
as soon as he could shake the dust off his feet, showing his sense
of the trouble that had been taken to impress his mind with moral
views by marrying another wife soon after. It is an ill wind that
blows nobody good, however; and Ann Sherwin seems to have been a
woman with an honest womanly heart, strangely out of place as it
was among her surroundings. She acquired an influence over the
"tigerly Major," and she was always ready to use it on the side of
the oppressed. Many thousands of lashes were diverted from intended
victims by her interference, it is said, and the prayers of men who
never prayed before were made for this gaoler's mistress. But in
Norfolk Island little regard was ever paid to the morality of women
or the lives of men. Governor King introduced a system which did
away at once with any conventional prejudices. He sold
convict-women to the highest bidder. This is what we are told of
him: "Governor King's proceedings respecting the poor convict women
on their arrival in the colony was abominable. They were disposed
of by Potter, the bellman, as so much live-stock. I have seen them
afterwards sold, some of them for a gallon of rum, others for £5,
and so on; and thus they were transferred from one brutal fellow to
another, without remedy or appeal."</p>

<p>How the convict lived in those days on the island will not bear
detailed description to anyone who cares to preserve any remnant of
his original faith in human nature. But the order of the day's
proceedings was something like this: The convicts were locked up
all night together in compartments, where their berths were hung
one above another with the one object of crowding as many men into
a given space as possible. Two hours before daylight in winter
these wretches were called out; each one then tied up his bed and
carried it out into the yard where it lay all day in the rain or
sun as chance ruled. Convicts were then paraded before the head
gaoler's door, and the gangs would then be taken out by overseers,
and each man apportioned his work. Some of them would work hard to
save some time in which they might work for themselves to earn some
provisions, as five pounds of flour per week was the maximum
allowed them. It was a pleasant diversion to the overseers to watch
for industrious people of this class in their gangs, and send them
to work in the surf as soon as they were done their task. There
they usually remained till 10 o'clock at night, being without food
all day.</p>

<p>"I have myself with them experienced this treatment," says one
of them, "and have been sent back to gaol with the gang wet from
head to foot, in which condition we have been turned in and
reckoned like a flock of sheep, without time being allowed us to
prepare our food. The next morning, when the bell rang at 5
o'clock, the order for every one to get up was given in these
words: 'Get up, you damned souls!' We had then to look for our wet
rags; and if the slightest grumbling escaped the lips of anyone the
order was 'To the triangle!' where the flogger was ready to give
the unfortunate wretch 25 lashes, after receiving which he had to
go back to his work as usual. I ask," continues this victim of what
he describes, "whether hanging or shooting, which puts a man out of
his misery at once, is not infinitely preferable to this kind of
treatment?"</p>

<p>The case is given of a young man, an Irish political prisoner,
who was compelled to walk about and work with a chain weighing 12
pounds on his legs, and while suffering from dysentery was driven
into the sea to carry packages ashore from the boats. He became too
weak to work, and had his irons knocked off when too late, for he
died soon after. There was really only one check on the
irresponsible cruelty of the gaolers, and that lay in their sense
of the fact that a convict could at any moment escape from their
gangs and revenge himself at the same time by knocking them on the
head. This was very often done, and the wild justice of revenge was
very frequently invoked by some overwrought victim of the system,
as we have already seen.</p>

<p>"If I could have bought or borrowed a pistol," wrote one of
these convicts afterwards, "the world, I think, would soon have
been rid of this man-killer, Foveaux; for, why should any man, with
the means of placing himself on equal terms, and exchanging life
for life without the endurance on his part of protracted misery,
allow himself to be murdered by a lingering death, and see his
murderer rejoicing before him?"</p>

<p>This most natural question doubtless suggested itself more or
less definitely many thousands of times to the victims of the
convict-system, and the wonder is that the impulse was not acted on
more frequently. "There are cases in which a man who shudders at
the idea of murder may be obliged to become an assassin in
self-defence," continues this embryonic cutthroat, reflectively;
"and did not tyrants feel and tremble at this power which an act of
self-sacrifice can accomplish, there would be, I believe, more
despotism and injustice in the world than already exists." This
convict-philosopher has not had his confidence in his fellowmen
increased by his observations, but there is a merciless truth about
his logic that must commend itself to everyone who feels the
slightest spark of the tine fire of assassination in his soul.</p>

<p>Foveaux's best achievement was a little Sabbath observance he
went through one Sunday. Of course there was no limit to the
Governor's power to hang or shoot any of his happy family when he
felt so disposed, but sometimes the fancy seized him at
unconscionable times. It is quite easy to understand that his
duties in Norfolk Island sometimes palled on the Major, and a
little stimulating excitement on such occasions would be like the
morsel of Gruyere that brings out the real flavour of your wine. So
one Sunday Foveaux took two men out of church, where they sat
listening to the parson's prayers, put them in a cell, and two
hours later hanged them without trial, and without wearying them
with any idle explanation of his freak. The charge was the usual
one of conspiring to mutiny, but probably the Major had found the
parson's prayer slow or his sermon dull. It is unfair to criticise
the Major's action without being acquainted a with his motives. Yet
this is what some good people had the excessively bad taste to do,
and Foveaux was actually recalled to explain his conduct in hanging
these two men. His disgust at the worry about such a trifle was
extreme, as if no one had ever been shot or hanged or flogged to
death before. But justice held her unrelenting sway. In the absence
of prosecutor, plaintiff, evidence, or public opinion, Major
Foveaux was acquitted without a stain on his soul or a blot on his
character. The order of St. Michael and George had not been devised
as a reward for colonial merit in those benighted days, but the
Major was made a Lieutenant-Colonel, and allowed to return to the
colony.</p>

<p class="b">Page 61</p>

<p>This kind of thing continued until 1805, when the island was
evacuated and the settlers sent to Van Diemen's Land, where they
settled on Norfolk Plains, named after the island they left. The
prisoners went with them. It was not until August 15, 1826, that
Norfolk Island was again proclaimed a place of detention for
convicts reconvicted in New South Wales. At this point its history
re-commences, and from that time until the convict-system was
finally broken up, the saturnalia of crimes against humanity went
on again. In 1834, Judge Burton, who once wrote an absurd book on
the "State of Religion and Education in New South Wales" (and who
died in England in August, 1888, aged 93) went there to hold a
session of his Court for the trial of some convicts who had made an
ineffectual attempt at revolt, and what he elicited at that trial
and published thereupon in his ridiculous book shows what progress
had been made in the island of horror during the ten years since it
was re-opened as a convict settlement. At this trial 87 witnesses
were examined, and, in the words of the Judge who tried the case,
their evidence "revealed to the Court such a picture of depravity,
as it may be assumed no human Judge ever had revealed to him
before." Most of the evidence against the prisoners was given by
convict informers, and these people were cross-examined by the
prisoners with a view to rendering their testimony valueless by
demonstrating the characters of the men who gave it. This brought
out a mass of appalling facts relating to the state of affairs on
the island. Herded together like pigs as they were, and with all
the hopes and feelings of men crushed out of them, these
disclosures revealed a condition of things to which the state of
pigs was preferable. Thirty of the prisoners were sentenced to
death, and it is recorded that some of these men showed signs of
capacity and education, and some hid wives and families belonging
to them in the outer world from which they had been cut off.</p>

<p>When these 30 men were sentenced to death, and their last hope
was taken from them, the judge tells us that they "completed the
abominable revelation by commenting to the judge, in earnest, deep,
but calm expostulation, on the crimes committed there." It was so
long since these derelict wretches had seen the slightest human
interest exhibited in their miseries that they strong, and the
facts themselves are so recent, that no room is left for doubt, and
the inevitable must be perforce accepted. Judge Burton was struck
with horror at what he heard and saw there. His description of what
he saw on visiting the gaols where the convicts were hived one
above the other in tiers of hammocks, or chained in rows to beams
running down the centre of the apartment, is suggestive of nothing
more than some of those efforts of horror of the Florentine who
drew from his lurid imagination those pictures of the Malebolge
pool. Burton described the island, in his quaint, old-fashioned
way, as "a cage full of unclean birds, full of Crimes against God
and Man, Murders and Blasphemies, and all Uncleanness."</p>

<p>When Dr. Ullathorne visited the Island to prepare some of the
condemned men for the death that awaited them, he went into the
crowded cell to announce his mission and read the names of those
who were finally adjudged to die. No scene in the whole history of
the convict-times is more appalling than the one that good man
describes as taking place in that miserable abode on that occasion.
One by one the condemned men fell on their knees as their names
were read out for death, and deliberately and calmly thanked God
that the gallows was about to deliver them from that horrible and
unspeakable place. What a subject for an historical picture by some
Australian artist of the future, when men's minds are free to feel
a natural horror at these triumphs of civilisation and law!</p>

<p>Such was the horror that the name of Norfolk Island inspired in
the minds of the most desperate convicts that many stories are told
of attempts to escape from the vessels that took them down to the
island. In 1827 a serious outbreak occurred in the settlement, and
50 escaped to Phillip Island, seven miles away, but were either
killed or re-captured by the governor of Norfolk Island, who took
their place of refuge by assault. A brig was seized and taken away
by prisoners in 1827. In 1842 the convicts rose on the island and
captured the <i>Governor Phillip</i>, which carried supplies. The
convict boats crew who wore employed between the vessel and the
shore disarmed the sentry at a pre-concerted signal, forced some of
the vessel's crew to jump overboard, and secured the captain, mate,
and soldiers below dock. The captain and mate managed to break
through a partition, joined with the soldiers, and tired with
effect through the crevices at the convicts. They then rushed on
deck, engaged in a hand-to-hand struggle, and soon re-captured the
vessel after five convicts had been killed and two wounded, and one
soldier killed and five wounded. Four convicts were hanged for
their share in this affair. The notorious Knatchbull, the
"Jamieson-street murderer," was also concerned in a mutiny on the
way to the settlement. From the first day that Norfolk Island was
set apart as a penal station until the convicts were finally
removed, that accursed spot in the wide Pacific held its wretches
who were marooned there in a state of torment as fierce as Tophet
and as hopeless as hell.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch37" id="ch37"></a>Chapter XXXVII. Vandemonia.</h2>

<p>Van Diemen's Land is as infamous for old-time horrors as any
other part of Australia, even including Norfolk Island. The pretty
little southern colony seemed destined by nature to be a garden and
beauty-spot for the continent, but its first rulers turned it into
an abode of despair and misery, and of men who were worse than
fiends. "Vandemonia" was the sinister name it became known by in
those old days, and no better step could have been taken when its
people had shuffled off its convict coil than to change its
ill-omened name to Tasmania.</p>

<p>The first convicts were taken to Van Diemen's Land by Lieutenant
Bowen in 1803. He brought with him a surgeon and ten male and six
female prisoners. Next year came Collins, who abandoned an attempt
to found a convict-settlement on the shores of Port Phillip, and
discharged his convicts at the head of Sullivan's Cove, now Hobart,
on January 30, 1804. From that date this spot was the scene of the
usual sights and sounds of the convict system, which has already
been described in sufficient detail. It is here and at Port Arthur
and Macquarie Harbour that Marcus Clarke lays the scene of the
earlier chapters of his novel, "For the Term of his Natural Life."
It is possible that some of the stories that are told about these
places surpass in their cold-blooded horror anything that is
recorded of any other part of the convict settlements. A return of
the sentences at Macquarie Harbour, during the five years between
1822 and 1826, shows that while the roll of convicts never reached
300 there, and in one year was less than 200, the total number of
lashes administered was upwards of 33,000.</p>

<p class="b">Page 62</p>

<p>There was a small rock off the settlement in Macquarie Harbour
which was used as a place of punishment for refractory convicts.
They were sent to sleep there, and "it seldom happened that an
individual could land upon the rock without getting wet, with the
result that he must either sleep in his clothes or go without
clothing; the greater part of them slept in their clothes, and
particularly those who had chains on; nine-tenths of those who
slept on this small island were in heavy irons." This is from the
evidence of a witness before the Committee of the House of Commons
in 1838. The same witness described the peculiar kind of "cat" with
which the 33,000 lashes were inflicted. It was a double
cat-o'-nine-tails, each tail of which was of a double twist of
whipcord, and each tail contained nine knots, forming a much more
formidable instrument than the ordinary cat-o'-nine-tails.
Deponent, who resigned his position at Macquarie Harbour rather
than continue to live among the horrors of that dreadful place,
says that he never knew a convict benefited by flagellation, and
that the punishment always had the effect of demoralising the
recipients to the lowest possible degree. They were so much
degraded by the punishment, he says, that they often told him they
would never rest satisfied till they had been executed for some
further offence. He gives an instance of one man who received 100
lashes a few days after his arrival for attempting to steal a boat.
"After he was taken down from the halberds he immediately turned
round to me and said, 'It is the first time I have been punished by
the cat, and it shall be the last;' he added that the first
opportunity he had of committing a crime which would send him
before a criminal court would be one which should hang him; and the
man's words were verified, for he was executed for an offence
committed at Macquarie Harbour, and that offence was the murder of
his constable, and I believe that three or four out of the same
party, who were punished that day for the same offence, were
executed for the same murder."</p>

<p class="cp"><img src="2300091h-images/68-page-62.jpg" alt=
"Illustration" title="Illustration">
</p>

<p class="caption">"And they were very hungry."</p>

<p>The same witness, in answer to a question by one of the
Committee, assured his questioner that the convicts looked upon
execution as a means of escape from the settlement. The ceremony
produced a feeling, he said, of the most disgusting description
among the convicts. "The convicts were assembled round the gallows
for the purpose of witnessing the execution, and so buoyant were
the feelings of the men about to be executed, and so little did
they care about it, that they absolutely kicked their shoes off
among the crowd as they were about to be executed, in order, as the
term expressed by them was, that they might die game; it seemed, as
the sheriff described it, more like a parting of friends who were
going a distant journey on land, than of individuals who were about
to separate from each other for ever; the expressions that were
used on that occasion were, 'Good bye, Bob,' and 'Good bye, Jack,'
and expressions of that kind among those in the crowd to those
about to be executed." Crimes were very frequent at Macquarie
Harbour among convicts who desired to be sent for trial to Hobart
Town, and sentenced to death. Others attempted to escape, and out
of 116 who absconded between 1822 and 1827, 75 are supposed to have
died in the bush, one was hanged for murdering and eating his
companion, two were shot by the military, eight were known to have
been murdered by their companions and of these six were eaten, 13
were hanged for bush-ranging and two for murder.</p>

<p>"Of these six were eaten." Cannibalism was one of the
developments of the convict-system, and you will remember how
Gabbett, in Marcus Clarke's book, evolved a scheme for escape, and
took with him provisions for his flight in the shape of two or
three living comrades. Among the papers put before the Committee in
1838 is a report of the case of a man named Pierce, who is
described as having lived on part of a comrade's body for two days.
But this man was a fastidious epicure, for he became a cannibal
although at the time he had some pork and bread in his pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. Pierce escaped with seven others, who "made it up for to
take a boat and proceed to Hobart Town." They did so, and landed to
walk across the island. After being without provisions for two
days, they were very cold and hungry. "Bill Cornelius says, 'I to
so weak that I could eat a piece of a man.' The next morning after
this there were four of us tor a feast. Bob Greenhill was the first
who introduced it, and said he had seen the like done before." But
to here give details would be too revolting. Suffice it to say that
Marcus Clarke's hideous story of Gabbett, of whom Bob Greenhill was
the original, is in nearly all respects absolutely true. Anyone who
has the nerve and the inclination to read the ghastly narrative of
Pierce will find it given in full in the Appendix to the Report of
the British Parliamentary Commission on Penal Settlements, dated
1838. After killing and eating the last of his companions Pierce
lived on some pieces of opossum he found, and some birds he caught,
until at length he came across a flock of sheep. He had killed a
lamb and was eating it raw when the shepherd came up and recognised
him. Then the story goes on until he was at length captured, tried
for his escape and other crimes, and duly hanged in 1823.</p>

<p>This is the authentic original of one of the stories of the
convict days in "His Natural Life," and we epitomise it here to
prove that the worst that has been said about the effects of the
convict-system is true. No more need be said on the subject, though
volumes might be written. Had mere sensationalism been the object
much that has been carefully left out would probably have been
retained. No limit exists to the horrors of Macquarie Harbour and
Port Arthur, and if we stop here it is because, as before stated,
the purpose of these papers will be as well served by one
representative instance as by 60. These matters are adduced in
illustration of our contention that the convict-system was
radically and abominably cruel and bad, and that everything we
inherit in our prison system of to-day, in the traditions of our
public policy, and in the officialism trained and formed under the
old convict-system, is demonstrably bad in a proportionate
degree.</p>

<p class="b">Page 63</p>

<p>We wonder every now and then that our criminal law is so harsh
and cruel, that men are flogged in the police stations at the
corners of Australian cities at mid-day, that the spirit of
officialism is so strong, and that public opinion is so
weak&mdash;and these papers are intended to give the answer. Take
any one single instance of what we refer to, and trace it back from
precedent to precedent in the history of our criminal law or public
policy, and we venture to say that in every one single instance the
origin of what we are ashamed of will be found in the state of
things which, in these representative instances that have been
quoted, have been indicated rather than described.</p>

<h2><a name="ch38" id="ch38"></a>Chapter XXXVIII. The End of the
Story.</h2>

<p>This history of Botany Bay reaches its last episode in the
granting of Responsible Government in 1856 The reader has seen how
the settlement developed from stage to stage in the earlier
chapters of this story, and he may now be said to be thoroughly
acquainted with the people, the officials, and the system of these
early days. In the time of Bourke we saw the beginning of the
changes, and later on the break-up of the convict-system and the
cessation of transportation. Then came the gold discovery, and with
it the influx of new population made up of men and women who had
not been broken in to the convict-system and the spirit of
gaoler-officialism, on the one hand, and to that tone of cringing
subservience on the other which it necessarily engendered. New
blood came into the country at the rate of 90,000 arrivals per
annum, and all this time the convict element was at first gradually
and then rapidly dying out. It was practically a new people that
won the fight against the old conditions which they had no act or
part in producing, and which they were determined not to
tolerate.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe how the process of development went
on from this point. The new people were not satisfied with the
social conditions of the colony as they found them, but they had
not, at the same time, any definite conception of that which was to
take their place. There was no Adams or Jefferson among them to
reenact the splendid historical role played by these great men of
bold and original mind in the old American colonies. The half
emancipated immigrants who began to fill the towns of the colony
had no one to open their minds to a conception such as that
embodied in the opening lines of the American declaration of
independence, which sets forth the equality of men and their equal
rights to equal chances in the battle of life. On the contrary, the
designers of the feeble patchwork of the Colonial Constitution were
blinded by their early training and traditions, and had not yet
forgotten to pull the forelock to the squire, or cringe to the
colonial imitator whom they found ready here to take his place.
They embodied their timid spirit in their Constitution, and with it
all those feudal traditions which the framers of the American
Constitution, in a wise spirit of philosophic statesmanship, lost
no time in lopping off at the roots.</p>

<p>Mr. Wentworth is usually credited with the authorship of the
Constitution of New South Wales, on which that of the other
colonies is modelled. But this is only half true. A great deal that
he advocated was too much even for the amorphous popular
intelligence as it then existed, and his proposals were very
seriously altered before they became the letter of the
Constitution. At the same time it is to be observed that if Mr.
Wentworth had exercised his great force of character and influence
in the right direction&mdash;if he had been a man of original
philosophic mind, capable of grappling with the problems to be
presented in the history of a young country, he might have given
the colonies constitutions of a much broader and more liberal caste
than those which are usually credited to his origination.</p>

<p>The events relating immediately to the granting of the
Constitution and Responsible Government date from 1851. In that
year Mr. Wentworth, in his place in the Council, moved a resolution
that the House was prepared to grant a Civil List to the Queen, on
condition of receiving responsible control of the lands and revenue
of the country. Some months later a minute was entered on the
Proceedings, setting forth the sense of the House that the Imperial
Parliament should not have the power to impose colonial taxes, and
that the public lands and revenues, official appointments, and
legislative powers should be at the command of the colonial
authorities, and not at that of the Secretary of State for the
Colonies. In 1852 a committee was appointed to draft a Constitution
for the colony. It consisted of Messrs. Wentworth, Donaldson,
Deas-Thomson (then Colonial Secretary), Attorney-General Plunkett,
J. Macarthur, Cowper, Lamb, Martin, Murray, and Dr. Douglas, In
September of the same year two Bills were laid on the table of the
House&mdash;to confer a Constitution on the colony, and to grant a
Civil List to the Queen.</p>

<p>Next year saw considerable progress. Sir John Pakington, then
Secretary of State for the Colonies, transmitted an official
despatch to the Governor, announcing that it had been decided, on
the representation of the Council, that the revenue and taxation
should be entrusted to the local legislature, that transportation
to Tasmania should cease forthwith, and that a Parliament should be
called together in New South Wales on the basis of an elective
Assembly and a nominee Council. The Governor reported the despatch
to the Council, which at once appointed a committee to draw up a
Constitution. The members of this committee were ballotted for, and
Messrs. Wentworth, Deas-Thomson, Macarthur, Plunkett, Cowper,
Martin, Donaldson, Macleay, Thurlow, and Murray were chosen. Mr.
Wentworth was elected chairman of this Constitution Committee, from
the proceedings of which the present Constitution was evolved. When
Mr. Wentworth brought up his report it was found that the framers
so utterly misconceived their office and the desires of the people,
as to advocate the creation of a peerage for members of the Upper
House, with hereditary titles. This was a scheme worthy of the time
of the Norman Conquest, or of a gang of South Sea Island
freebooters, and it was received on the part of the public with all
the contempt it deserved. Unspeakable ridicule was poured out on
the devoted heads of the Baron of Woolloomooloo and the Duke of
Vaucluse, as the ambitious creatures who devised this notable
project were called.</p>

<p>Public meetings took the matter up and began to discuss this
peerage question with a good deal of acrimony. An advertisement was
issued to the public calling attention to the proposed creation of
Botany Bay peers out of the representatives of the old New South
Wales Corps and the officialdom of the convict-system. The
formation of an Upper House in which the people would have no voice
was condemned, and a protest entered against the plot "to fix
irrevocably on the people this oligarchy in the name of free
institutions, so that no future Legislature can reform it even by
an absolute majority." A great meeting was called at the Royal
Hotel in George-street, Sydney, in August, 1853, to express the
popular mind on this subject. Messrs. John Bayley Darvall, Johnson,
Henry Parkes, Mort, Deniehy, McEncroe, Piddington, Flood, and
others addressed the gathering and spoke up manfully against the
mushroom peerage proposals. It was decided by the meeting that the
Bill was radically defective, and the populace bound themselves to
oppose every attempt to foist a Constitution on the colony so
distinctly inimical to the wishes and interests of the people.</p>

<p>The Constitution Committee, however, went on with their measure.
Mr. Wentworth proposed the second reading of the Constitution Bill
in its objectionable form, and after a debate of seven days its
adoption was carried by a majority of 34 votes to 8. This action of
the Legislative Council showed the public that their interests were
not safe in the hands of its members, and the fact excited them to
still stronger measures of agitation. A great gathering took place
at the Circular Quay to petition the Queen against the Constitution
Bill, and the attempt of the old leaven to wreck the prospects of
free institutions just as they seemed to be at the point of
realisation. The People's Constitution Committee was here declared
in permanent session to take steps to protect the popular rights
from the Committee of the Council. The peerage proposals were
withdrawn, and when the House was moved into Committee on December
6, to consider the Bill, the other clause conferring life
membership on the existing Government was dropped in deference to
these manifestations, and the third reading passed by 27 votes to 6
on December 21, 1853, amid a great demonstration of applause from
the members of the Legislative Council. The Constitution created
two Houses, the Assembly to sit for five years and the Council for
life. Messrs. Wentworth and Deas-Thomson were sent to England to
pilot the measure through the British Parliament, and on its final
passing there and receiving the warranty of the Royal Assent,
returned with the news to New South Wales. Immediate steps were now
taken for the election of the first Parliament, and all the
business was completed and the elections over by May, 1856. On the
22nd of that month the first popular Parliament sat in the old
Council Chambers in Macquarie-street, Sydney, for the first
time.</p>

<p>There is no necessity to pursue this record any further. We have
now seen the latest stages in the development of the political
institutions of the colony, and the circumstances show exactly the
same conflict of vested interests and old-time traditions against
the popular sentiment that every stage in the colony's history has
exhibited. Manhood suffrage came later, and it may now be said
that, with this and the free institutions we possess, the political
future of the Australian system is in the hands of the people
themselves.</p>

<p>It may be so. It may be that for what we have we must blame or
praise ourselves-that the power for good or evil is in the people's
hands, and that they can do whatever they will. But if the reader
who has followed the progress of the story we have undertaken to
here set down without exaggeration or extenuation, will compare the
things of to-day with the occurrences of the time antecedent to
forty or fifty years ago, he will not fail to note the distinct
survival of some of the worst features of the worst period of
Botany Bay, They have been veneered over and hidden from ready view
by the change of manners and the lapse of years, but the essentials
of our criminal law, the official mind, and the spirit of our
political action and outlook are much the same. Our criminal law,
we are often told, is more bloody and brutal than any other on the
face of God's earth to-day. Every death sentence recorded in our
courts of law shows that the gallows is only reft of its victim
after the most violent and strained relations between the popular
sentiment and the official mind, if the lunatic criminal or the
practically irresponsible boy is ever rescued from the grip of the
hangman at all. The lash and the flogging laws are still in active
operation in the Australasian colonies, and the penal system is
still to all intents and purposes as powerless for reform as ever
it was in the instances we have individualised in the pages that
have gone before.</p>

<p>The official mind is the last refuge and resting-place of what
remains of the past. When Dr. Whately and his fellow-workers spoke
against the convict-system fifty years ago, as we quoted those
earnest and thoughtful men some chapters back, they recommended the
break-up of the convict system as the least of the steps to be
taken to eradicate the evils it had caused. They were still more
earnest in advocating the removal of the centre of settlement from
the scenes of early misery and horror, and from anything that could
suggest the past to the popular mind. The old officialism, too,
should be swept away root and branch; and this with the view of
leaving no influence in existence which would operate to preserve
any of the spirit of the old days of degradation.</p>

<p>But the influence that had been built up through so many years
in the colony had too much power to allow itself to be swept away.
As the men of the new period brought out by Responsible Government
rose in the political scale, they were absorbed by the
"Conservative" class in the community. Our history is full of
instances of men who began their careers in sympathy with the
indefinitely-expressed popular sentiment and ended them as
tinselled knights of a flimsy colonial order. But our history is
passing through an intermediate stage, and the period of transition
is still to come. Indications are forthcoming every day that a new
race is growing up in Australia, which is not Colonial but
Australian, and which only requires to be put on the right track
and trusted to its honest instincts to work out Australia's future
on bright and popular national lines which will not have their
starting-point in the miserable episodes of old-time squalor, or
their vanishing-point in Federation or Imperialism. It is for the
guidance of this instinct, and to assist the popular mind' in
coming to broad conclusions on national questions, that this
political pamphlet on the beginnings of Australian colonisation has
been written.</p>
